				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
IL-18 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION<br>
COMPRISING THE ANTAGONIST<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an interleukin-18 receptor antagonist and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the antagonist. More specifically, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for preventing and/or treating an interleukin-18-related disorder, particularly skin thickening due to ultraviolet, which comprises an antibody against the interleukin-18 receptor a subunit and/or an antibody against the p subunit, and a pharmaceutical composition for treating a stress-related disease.<br>
Background Art<br>
Skin disorders due to ultraviolet are attracting attention both from the viewpoint of aesthetics and from the viewpoint of cancer control. Epithelial keratinized cells (keratinocytes), which account for the majority of the epithelium, are observed to have abnormalities in the growth and/or differentiation thereof in various dermatitides that occur as complications in psoriasis, ichthyosis, collagen disease and the like. From this fact, it is thought that controlling the growth and/or differentiation of keratinocytes is extremely important to the health of living organisms.<br>
The skin is an organ configured by the epidermis, which consists of overlain epithelial cells, and the dermis, which consists of dense connective tissue, forming the barrier between the outer environment and the inside of the body. The epidermis is a tissue about 1 mm in thickness that forms the outermost layer of the skin, being in direct contact with the atmosphere and protecting<br>
the inside of the skin against various stimuli (for example, solar rays, dryness, dust and the like).<br>
The upper layer of the human skin, which confers elasticity and the barrier characteristic to the skin, that is, the epidermis, consists of four cell types defined by distinct differentiation stages (basal cell layer, which is the border of the junction between the dermis and the epidermis, prickle cell layer, granular layer, and keratinized layer).<br>
Of the cells that constitute the epidermis, 80% are keratinized cells (keratinocytes). Keratinocytes, which have the capability of cell division, are present in the basal cell layer and move to the prickle cell layer, granular layer, and keratinized layer with the progress of differentiation. Terminal cells of the corneal layer, which are called corneocytes, are already dead. The epidermis is a constantly renewed tissue, and the program for cell cleavage and progress to finally differentiated corneocytes is very strictly controlled. In the basal cell layer, cell division occurs constantly; the resulting cells move while changing the shape thereof, and about 28 days later, they drop off from the corneal layer as dirt.<br>
As such, the differentiation of the epidermis, which turns over in a 28-day cycle, is important to the conferment of the essential function of the skin, that is, the conferment of the protective barrier against the outer environment, and the prevention of the loss of water from the body.<br>
The skin is sensitively influenced by temperature/humidity, ultraviolet, cosmetics, aging, disease, stress, dietary habits and the like; as a result, various troubles, including deterioration of the above- described skin functions and skin senescence, occur.<br>
Ultraviolet (UV) has a sterilizing action and has effects of promoting bone formation by vitamin D and<br>
improving the immune function of the skin, and on the other hand produces skin thickening, wrinkle or pouch formation, pigmentation and the like.<br>
As acute reactions due to ultraviolet in the skin, sunburns and photosensitive dermatitis can be mentioned; as chronic reactions, skin pigment abnormalities (exacerbation of stains and freckles) and promotion of skin senescence can be mentioned. When the skin is exposed to ultraviolet, an enzyme system of the arachidonic acid cycle is induced in skin cells, resulting in the generation of prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 has a function to inflame skin cells, causing red swelling (erythema) and sunburns. Sunburns in turn cause stains and thicken epidermal cells. As such, epidermal thickening leads to the onset of skin cancer.<br>
Because epidermal thickening is an abnormal growth of keratinocytes, epidermal thickening can be suppressed by suppressing this growth to promote the differentiation thereof.<br>
As major attempts to prevent or ameliorate troubles that occur in the skin, a method of preventing the dryness of the skin and increasing the moisture retention potential of the skin by applying a synthetic or natural moisturizer, a method of improving blood flow by applying a blood circulation promoter, and the like have been performed.<br>
However, these methods pose various problems in terms of prophylactic and ameliorating effects on various skin troubles, the persistency thereof, drug stability and safety, and the like. Specifically, because these methods are generally to replenish water in the epidermis, particularly in the corneal surface, or to supplement part of moisturizer, the indications and effects thereof are transient so that a permanent amelioration of the skin has been unexpectable.<br>
Hence, there is a demand for the development of a substance having a remarkable suppressive action on epidermal thickening, insufficient keratinization of the skin, lipid metabolism abnormalities and the like.<br>
Generally, the growth or differentiation of cells requires a particular growth factor or differentiation factor. Also, the immune responses exhibited by living organisms to bacterial and/or viral infections, tumors and cytotoxicity are regulated by direct or indirect interactions between immunocompetent cells. Cytokines (for example, interleukins, colony stimulating factors, TNFs (tumor necrosis factors), interferons) have been shown to be involved in the differentiation, growth and immune responses of cells.<br>
Interleukin-18 (IL-18) was identified as a novel protein that induces the production of IFN-y in immunocompetent cells (see, for example, patent document 1) . Currently, IL-18 is known to induce not only the production of interferon-y, which is an inflammatory cytokine, but also the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (for example, interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-13) (see, for example, non-patent document 1).<br>
IL-18 protein is produced as the 24-kDa inactive form (precursor) and cleaved by caspase-1 into the 18-kDa active form, after which it is released out of the cells (see, for example, non-patent document 4). In cultured cells, the IL-18 precursor is expressed in activated macrophages, cerebral microglia, keratinized cells of the skin, Langerhans' cells, corneal epithelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells, uterine gland cells, osteoblasts and the like (see, for example, non-patent document 5). Also, IL-18 protein is known to increase locally in lesions in Alzheimer's disease, Sjoegren's syndrome, Crohn's disease, osteoarthritis, rheumatic arthritis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, atherosclerosis,<br>
and the like (see, for example, non-patent document 6).<br>
IL-18 receptor consists of the a subunit and the P subunit (see, for example, non-patent document 7), and is classified in the IL-ip receptor/TLR family based on the amino acid sequence thereof (see, for example, non-patent documents 5, 6, and 8). The IL-18 activated form protein is known to elevate NF-KB-dependent transcriptional activity and AP-l-dependent transcriptional activity via the IL-18 receptors (see, for example, non-patent document 5) . The latter is known to be involved by JNK and p38 MAPK (see, for example, non-patent document 9). The mRNA of the IL-18 receptor a subunit is expressed in the brain, thymus, uterus, adrenal, liver, pancreas, lung, spleen, skeletal muscle, NK cells, T cells and the like (see, for example, non-patent document 6).<br>
Regarding the relationship between IL-18 and disease, it is known that in schizophrenia, neonatal brain hypoplasia, panic disorder, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), allergic asthma,<br>
hyperthyroidism, type I diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, renal insufficiency, septicemia, atopic dermatitis, premature amniorrhexis, HIV infection, malaria infection and the like, IL-18 protein in patient serum exhibits high values (see, for example, non—patent document 6), and that in patients with endometriosis in chronic stage, the IL-18 protein concentration in ascitic fluid rises (see, for example, non-patent document 10). According to an analysis using animal models, in models of multiple sclerosis or rheumatic arthritis, IL-18 administration worsens the condition, whereas administration of an anti-IL-18 antibody ameliorates or mitigates the condition (see, for example, non-patent documents 11 and 12) . On the other hand, in a model of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), IL-18 administration reduces TNFa production and lowers the mortality rate, whereas administration of an anti-IL- 18 antibody increases the mortality rate (see, for example, non-patent document 13).<br>
As stated above, there is no definite relationship between IL-18 and disease. This represents the multi- functionality of IL-18, making it more difficult to understand the functions of IL-18 in living organisms.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention Problems to Be Solved by the Invention<br>
The present inventors found that when activated form IL-18 was added to the culture medium of keratinocytes cultured at high density, contact inhibition was blocked, which led to the overgrowth of the cells. Furthermore, the present inventors found that when IL-18 was added to the culture supernatant of differentiation-induced cultured keratinocytes, the differentiation thereof was promoted, and that when an anti-IL-18 antibody was further added, this promotion of differentiation was suppressed. Hence, the present inventors found that IL-18 was capable of controlling epidermal thickening by being involved in the growth and/or differentiation of keratinocytes.<br>
However, currently available antibodies against the IL-18 receptors cannot be used for immunohistochemistry, tissues in which a receptor protein is actually expressed are unknown, and it is difficult to confirm that IL-18 functions actually in a living organism. The research into the expression of the IL-18 receptors that has been conducted to date is to analyze the expression at the nucleic acid level,- and does not clearly show in which tissues an IL-18 receptor protein is expressed actually.<br>
The present invention has been developed in view of the above-described problems, and is intended to provide an IL-18 receptor antibody that functions as an IL-18 receptor antagonist and is usable for immunohistochemistry. In other words, an object of the present invention is to supply an antibody that binds to an IL-18 receptor to inhibit a function of IL-18 in a living organism, and to prevent and/or treat an IL-18-dependent disorder, particularly skin thickening caused by ultraviolet, using the antibody.<br>
Furthermore, the present inventors found that the<br>
blood IL-6 level rose due to the stress-dependent elevation of blood IL-18 level, and that as a result, the pathology/condition of stress-related disease exacerbated. Based on this finding, an object of the present invention is to supply an antibody that binds to an IL-18 receptor to inhibit a function of IL-18 in a living organism, and to treat or prevent an IL-18/IL-6-dependent disorder, particularly a stress-related disease, using the antibody.<br>

Best Mode for Embodying the Invention<br>
[1: IL-18 receptor antagonists]<br>
The present inventors investigated whether or not epidermal thickening could be controlled via the IL-18- related signal transduction pathway, using IL-18 receptor antagonists.<br>
Specifically, the present inventors prepared antibodies against IL-18 receptors that remarkably inhibit<br>
the IL-18-dependent production of interferon-y, and analyzed the relationship between IL-18 and epidermal thickening using these antibodies as the IL-18 receptor antagonists.<br>
(a) IL-18 receptor antibodies<br>
The present invention provides an antibody that binds specifically to the IL-18 receptor a subunit. In one mode of embodiment, the antibody of the present invention preferably binds specifically to a polypeptide consisting of the 120th to 140th positions (SEQ ID NO:5) or the 142nd to 162nd positions (SEQ ID NO:6) of the amino acid sequence of the human IL-18 receptor a subunit (GenBank accession number U43672 (SEQ ID NO:l)), or the 99th to 116th positions (SEQ ID NO:7) or the 252nd to 270th positions (SEQ ID NO:8) of the amino acid sequence of the mouse IL-18 receptor a subunit (GenBank accession number U43673 (SEQ ID NO:2)).<br>
The present invention further provides an antibody that binds specifically to the IL-18 receptor p subunit. In one mode of embodiment, the antibody of the present invention preferably binds specifically to a polypeptide consisting of the 21st to 42nd positions (SEQ ID NO:9) or the 164th to 190th positions (SEQ ID NO:10) of the amino acid sequence of the human IL-18 receptor p subunit (GenBank accession number AF077346 (SEQ ID NO:3)).<br>
Although an antibody according to the present invention is preferably elicited using one of the above- described peptides as the antigen, it is also preferable to use these peptides in mixture as the antigen.<br>
As used herein, the term "antibody" means an immunoglobulin (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM and Fab fragments, F (ab')2 fragments, and Fc fragments thereof); examples thereof include polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, single-chain antibodies, anti-ideotype<br>
antibodies and humanized antibodies, but are not limited thereto. An antibody according to the present invention can be useful in selecting a biological material that expresses an IL-18 receptor.<br>
An "antibody" can be prepared according to various known methods (for example, HarLow et al., "Antibodies: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York (1988)", Iwasaki et al., "Monoclonal antibody hybridomas and ELISA, Kodansha (1991)").<br>
A peptide antibody is prepared by a method widely known in the relevant field. See, for example, Chow, M. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 910-914; and Bittle, F.J. et al., J. Gen. Virol. 66: 2347-2354 (1985) (herein cited for the sake of reference). Generally, an animal can be immunized with a free peptide; however, an anti-peptide antibody titer can be boosted by coupling the peptide to a polymeric carrier (for example, keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or tetanus toxoid). For example, a cysteine- containing peptide can be coupled to a carrier using a linker like m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), whereas other peptides can be coupled to a carrier using a more common linking agent like glutaraldehyde. Animals like rabbits, rats, and mice can be immunized with any of a free or carrier-coupled peptide by, for example, intraperitoneal and/or intradermal injection of an emulsion comprising about 100 ng of peptide or carrier protein and Freund's adjuvant. Some booster injections can be required at intervals of, for example, about 2 weeks, in order to provide, for example, an anti-peptide antibody of useful titer that can be detected by ELISA assay using a free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of the anti-peptide antibody in serum from an immunized animal can be increased by choosing an anti-peptide antibody, for example, using adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the antibody chosen by a<br>
method widely known in the relevant field.<br>
As used herein, the term "antibody that binds specifically to an IL-18 receptor" encompasses that a complete antibody molecule and antibody fragment (for example, Fab and F(ab')2 fragments) capable of binding specifically to an IL-18 receptor. The term "IL-18 receptor", unless otherwise stated herein, is intended to mean both or either of the a subunit and P subunit of the receptor. The Fab and F(ab')2 fragments lack the Fc portion of the complete antibody, is more quickly eliminated by circulation, and can hardly have the nonspecific tissue binding of the complete antibody (Wahl et al., J. Nucl. Med. 24: 316-325 (1983) (herein cited for the sake of reference)). Therefore, these fragments are preferable.<br>
Furthermore, an additional antibody capable of binding to a peptide antigen of an IL-18 receptor can be produced by 2-step procedures through the use of an anti- ideotype antibody. Such a method utilizes the fact that an antibody per se is an antigen, and therefore enables to obtain an antibody that binds to a secondary antibody. According to this method, an antibody that binds specifically to an IL-18 receptor is used to immunize an animal (preferably a mouse). Next, splenocytes of such an animal are used to produce hybridoma cells, and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify a clone that produces an antibody whose capability of binding to an antibody that binds specifically to an IL-18 receptor can be blocked by an IL-18 receptor peptide antigen. Such antibodies include anti-ideotype antibodies against an antibody that binds specifically to an IL-18 receptor, and can be used to immunize an animal for inducing the formation of an antibody that binds specifically to an additional IL-18 receptor.<br>
It is evident that Fab and F(ab')2 and other<br>
fragments of an antibody according to the present invention can be used according to a method disclosed herein. Such a fragment is produced representatively by cleavage due to proteolysis using an enzyme like papain (resulting in an Fab fragment) or pepsin (resulting in an F(ab')2 fragment). Alternatively, an IL-18 receptor binding fragment can be produced by applying recombinant DNA technology or by synthetic chemistry.<br>
Hence, it can be said that an antibody according to the present invention only need to have at least an antibody fragment that recognizes an IL-18 receptor peptide antigen according to the present invention (for example, Fab and F(ab')2 fragments). Therefore, it should be noted that an immunoglobulin consisting of an antibody fragment that recognizes an IL-18 receptor peptide antigen according to the present invention and an Fc fragment of a different antibody molecule is also included in the present invention.<br>
Hence, an object of the present invention resides in the provision of an antibody that recognizes an IL-18 receptor according to the present invention, and does not reside in the kinds of individual immunoglobulins (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM), chimeric antibody preparation method, peptide antigen preparation method and the like described specifically herein. Therefore, it should be noted that an antibody acquired by methods other than the above-described methods is also encompassed in the scope of the present invention.<br>
(b) Antigen peptides<br>
The present inventors found that a polypeptide consisting of a particular region of IL-18 receptor protein elicited an antibody usable for the immunohistochemistry of IL-18, and capable of functioning as an IL-18 receptor antagonist, and completed the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention provides a polypeptide consisting of the 120th to 140th positions (SEQ ID NO:5) or the 142nd to 162nd positions (SEQ ID NO:6) of the amino acid sequence of the human IL-18 receptor a subunit (GenBank accession number U43672 (SEQ ID NO:l)), or the 99th to 116th positions (SEQ ID NO:7) or the 252nd to 270th positions (SEQ ID NO:8) of the amino acid sequence of the mouse IL-18 receptor a subunit (GenBank accession number U43673 (SEQ ID NO:2)), or a polypeptide consisting of the 21st to 42nd positions (SEQ ID NO:9) or the 164th to 190th positions (SEQ ID NO:10) of the amino acid sequence of the human IL-18 receptor P subunit (GenBank accession number AF077346(SEQ ID NO:3)).<br>
As used herein, the term "polypeptide" is used interchangeably with "peptide" or "protein". A polypeptide according to the present invention may also be isolated from a natural source, or produced by recombinant technology, or chemically synthesized.<br>
The term "isolated" polypeptide or protein is intended to mean a polypeptide or protein taken out from the natural environment thereof. For example, a polypeptide and protein produced by recombinant technology, expressed in host cells, are thought to have been isolated in the same manner as a natural or recombinant polypeptide and protein substantially purified by an optionally chosen appropriate technology.<br>
Polypeptides according to the present invention include products produced from natural purified products, products of chemical synthesis procedures, and prokaryotic hosts or eukaryotic hosts (including, for example, bacterial cells, yeast cells, higher plant cells, insect cells, and mammalian cells) by recombinant technology.<br>
A polypeptide according to the present invention may be in a state wherein the a polynucleotide according to<br>
the present invention described below (gene that encodes a polypeptide according to the present invention) is introduced to a host cell, and the polypeptide is expressed in the cell, or may also be isolated and purified from a cell, tissue and the like. Also, a polypeptide according to the present invention may be a chemically synthesized one.<br>
Also, a polypeptide according to the present invention may be one comprising an additional polypeptide. As examples of the additional polypeptide, polypeptides labeled with an epitope such as His, Myc, and Flag can be mentioned. In a preferred mode of embodiment, a polypeptide according to the present invention can be recombinantly expressed in an altered form like a fusion protein. For example, to improve the stability and persistency during purification or during subsequent operation and storage in host cells, a region of additional amino acids, particularly chargeable amino acids, of a polypeptide according to the present invention, can be added to the N-terminus of the polypeptide.<br>
A synthetic peptide can be synthesized using a known method of chemical synthesis. For example, Houghten describes a simple method for the synthesis of a large number of peptides, like 10 to 20 mg of 248 different 13- residue peptides showing a single amino acid modification of the HA1 polypeptide segment, that are prepared and characterized in less than 4 weeks. Houghten, R.A., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 5131-5135 (1985). This "Simultaneous Multiple Peptide Synthesis (SMPS)" process is further described in US Patent No. 4,631,211 of Houghten et al. (1986). In this procedure, individual resins for the solid phase synthesis of various peptides are contained in separate solvent-permeable packets, and enable the optimum use of many of the same repetitive steps concerning the solid phase method. The complete<br>
manual procedures enable the simultaneous performance of 500 to 1000 or more syntheses (Houghten et al., ibidem, 5134). These documents are herein cited for the sake of reference.<br>
A polypeptide according to the present invention is useful in a method and kit for preparing an antibody that is effective for immunohistochemistry and capable of functioning as an IL-18 receptor antagonist.<br>
Hence, it can be said that a polypeptide according to the present invention may be any one comprising at least a peptide consisting of any one of SEQ ID NO:5 to 10. Therefore, it should be noted that a polypeptide consisting of a peptide consisting of any one of SEQ ID NO:5 to 10 and an optionally chosen amino acid sequence having a particular function (for example, tag) is also included in the present invention. Also, a peptide consisting of any one of SEQ ID NO:5 to 10 and the optionally chosen amino acid sequence may be joined via an appropriate linker peptide in a way that does not inhibit the respective functions.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention resides in the provision of a polypeptide for preparing an antibody that is useful for immunohistochemistry and capable of functioning as an IL-18 receptor antagonist, and does not reside in the polypeptide preparation methods and the like specifically described herein. Therefore, it should be noted that a polypeptide enabling the preparation of an antibody that is effective for immunohistochemistry and capable of functioning as an IL- 18 receptor antagonist, acquired by methods other than the above-described methods, is also encompassed in the scope of the present invention.<br>
(c) Polynucleotides that encode antigen peptides<br>
The present invention provides polynucleotides that<br>
encode the above-described polypeptides according to the present invention. As used herein, the term "polynucleotide" is used interchangeably with "nucleic acid" or "nucleic acid molecule", and is intended to mean a polymer of nucleotide. As used herein, the term "base sequence" is used interchangeably with "nucleic acid sequence" or "nucleotide sequence", and is shown as a sequence of deoxyribonucleotide (abbreviated as A, G, C and T).<br>
A polynucleotide according to the present invention may be produced as a cleavage fragment of a longer polynucleotide (for example, a polynucleotide consisting of the full-length cDNA that encodes an IL-18 receptor protein), or chemically synthesized. Referring to the present description, because the base sequence shown by SEQ ID NO:2 is provided, those skilled in the art can easily prepare a DNA fragment based on SEQ ID NO:2. For example, restriction endonuclease cleavage or shearing by sonication can easily be used to prepare fragments of various sizes. Alternatively, such a fragment can be prepared synthetically. An appropriate fragment (oligonucleotide) is synthesized using the 392 model synthesizer of Applied Biosystems Incorporated (ABI, 850 Lincoln Center Dr., Foster City, CA 94404) and the like.<br>
As the method of acquiring a polynucleotide according to the present invention, a method using a means of amplification such as PCR can be mentioned. For example, by preparing respective primers from among the 5' side and 3' side sequences (or complementary sequences thereto) of cDNAs of a polynucleotide in the present invention, and performing PCR and the like using these primers with a genomic DNA (or cDNA) and the like as the template to amplify the DNA region sandwiched between the two primers, a DNA fragment comprising a polynucleotide according to the present invention can be acquired in a large amount.<br>
Also, a polynucleotide according to the present invention can be fused to a polynucleotide that encodes the above-described tag label (tag sequence or marker sequence) on the 5' side or 3' side thereof.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention resides in the provision of a polynucleotide that encodes an antigen polypeptide capable of eliciting an antibody that is effective for immunohistochemistry and capable of functioning as an IL-18 receptor antagonist, and does not reside in the polynucleotide preparation method and the like described specifically herein. Therefore, it should be noted that polynucleotides that encode the above- described polypeptides, acquired by methods other than the above-described methods, are also encompassed in the scope of the present invention.<br>
(d) Production of antigen peptides [1] Polypeptide production method<br>
The present invention provides a production method for a polypeptide according to the present invention.<br>
In one mode of embodiment, a production method for a polypeptide according to the present invention is characterized by using a vector comprising a polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide according to the present invention.<br>
In one aspect of this mode of embodiment, a production method for the polypeptide according to this mode of embodiment preferably employs a recombinant expression system. When a recombinant expression system is used, a method comprising inserting a polynucleotide according to the present invention to a recombinant expression vector, then introducing the vector to a host in a way that enables the expression thereof by a known method, and purifying the above-described polypeptide obtained as a result of translation in the host, and the like can be adopted. The recombinant expression vector may or may not be a plasmid, as long as it enables the introduction of the desired polynucleotide to the host. Preferably, the production method for the polypeptide according to this mode of embodiment comprises a step for introducing the above-described vector to a host.<br>
When an exogenous polynucleotide is introduced to a host as described above, the expression vector preferably incorporates a promoter that functions in the host in a way that enables the expression of the exogenous polynucleotide. Although the method for purifying the recombinantly produced polypeptide differs depending on the host used and the properties of the polypeptide, it is possible to relatively easily purify the desired polypeptide by means of a tag and the like.<br>
A production method for the polypeptide according to this mode of embodiment preferably further comprises a step for purifying a polypeptide according to the present invention from a cell or tissue extract comprising the polypeptide. The step for purifying the polypeptide is preferably a step for preparing a cell extract from cells or tissue by a widely known method (for example, a method comprising disrupting cells or tissue, then performing centrifugation and recovering the soluble fraction), and then purifying the polypeptide from this cell extract by a widely known method (for example, ammonium sulfate precipitation or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography, and lectin chromatography), but is not limited thereto.<br>
In another mode of embodiment, a production method for a polypeptide according to the present invention is characterized by chemically synthesizing a polypeptide according to the present invention. Those skilled in the<br>
art easily understand that a polypeptide according to the present invention can be chemically synthesized by applying a widely known chemical synthesis technology on the basis of the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide according to the present invention described herein.<br>
Hence, it can be said that a production method for a polypeptide according to the present invention may be any one at least using a known commonly used technology on the basis of the amino acid sequence of an IL-18 receptor protein or the base sequence of a polynucleotide that encodes an IL-18 receptor protein.<br>
Hence, an object of the present invention resides in the provision of a production method for a polypeptide according to the present invention, and it should be noted that production methods comprising a step other than the above-described various steps are also encompassed in the scope of the present invention.<br>
[2] Vector and cells for recombinant expression<br>
The present invention provides a vector used to produce an antigen polypeptide capable of eliciting an antibody that is effective for immunohistochemistry and capable of functioning as an IL-18 receptor antagonist. Preferably, a vector according to the present invention can be a vector used for recombinant expression.<br>
A vector according to the present invention is not subject to limitation, as long as it comprises one of the above-described polynucleotides according to the present invention. Examples of the method of preparing a recombinant expression vector include methods using a plasmid, phage, or cosmid and the like can be mentioned, but are not limited thereto.<br>
The specific kind of the vector is not subject to limitation, as long as a vector expressible in the host cells is chosen as appropriate. Hence, a promoter sequence<br>
is selected as appropriate to ensure the expression of a polynucleotide according to the present invention, according to the kind of the host cells, and a vector prepared by incorporating this and a polynucleotide according to the present invention into various plasmids may be used as the expression vector.<br>
The expression vector preferably comprises at least one selection marker. As such a marker, dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, and the tetracycline resistance gene or the ampicillin resistance gene for culture in E. coli and other bacteria, can be mentioned.<br>
Using the above-described selection marker, it is possible to confirm whether or not a polynucleotide according to the present invention has been introduced to the host cells, and whether or not the same is accurately expressed in the host cells. Alternatively, a polypeptide according to the present invention may be expressed as a fusion polypeptide.<br>

Specifically, for example, bacteria such as Escherichia coli, yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe), Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus laevis oocytes and the like can be mentioned, but are not limited thereto. Appropriate culture media and conditions for the above-described host cells are widely known in the relevant field.<br>
The method for introducing the above-described expression vector into host cells, that is, the transformation method, is not subject to limitation; conventionally known methods such as electroporation, calcium phosphate method, liposome method, and DEAE dextran method can be used suitably. Also, for example, when a polypeptide according to the present invention is<br>
transfer-expressed in an insect, an expression system using baculovirus may be used.<br>
Hence, it can be said that a vector according to the present invention may be any one comprising at least a polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide according to the present invention. Therefore, it should be noted that vectors other than expression vectors are included in the technical scope of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention i resides in the provision of a vector comprising a<br>
polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide according to the present invention, and does not reside in the individual vector species and cell species, as well as vector preparation methods and cell introduction methods described specifically herein. Therefore, it should be noted that vectors acquired using a vector species and vector preparation method other than those described above are also encompassed in the scope of the present invention.<br>
The present invention further provides cells i introduced a polynucleotide that encodes an antigen polypeptide capable of eliciting an antibody that is effective for immunohistochemistry and capable of functioning as an IL-18 receptor antagonist. The cell preparation method (production method) is not subject to<br>
&gt;	limitation; for example, a method comprising introducing the above-described recombinant vector into a host to transform the host can be mentioned.<br>
Confirmation of whether or not the gene has been introduced to the cell can be performed by PCR, Southern<br>
&gt;	hybridization, Northern hybridization and the like. For example, DNA is prepared from transformant cells, DNA- specific primers are designed, and PCR is performed. The PCR can be performed under the same conditions as those used to prepare the aforementioned plasmid. Subsequently,<br>
&gt;	by subjecting the amplification product to agarose gel<br>
electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis and the like, staining with ethidium bromide, SYBR Green solution and the like, and detecting the amplification product as a single band, the fact of transformation can be confirmed. Also, it is possible to perform PCR using a primer previously labeled with a fluorescent dye, and to detect the amplification product. Furthermore, a method comprising binding the amplification product to a solid phase such as a microplate, and confirming the amplification product by fluorescence or an enzyme reaction and the like, can also be adopted.<br>
An object of the present invention resides in the provision of cells introduced a polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide according to the present invention, and does not reside in the individual vector species and introduction methods described specifically herein. Therefore, it should be noted that cells acquired using a vector species and cell species, as well as vector preparation method and cell introduction method other than those described above are also encompassed in the scope of the present invention.<br>
[2: Pharmaceutical composition comprising IL-18 receptor antagonist]<br>
The present inventors found that administration of an IL-18 receptor antagonist to the skin after ultraviolet irradiation was effective in avoiding epidermal thickening. The present inventors further found that in mouse keratinocytes showing thickening after UV irradiation, the expression levels of IL-18 (6 to 12 days after UV irradiation), IL-18 receptor a subunit (9 to 12 days after UV irradiation), and |3 subunit (6 to 9 days after UV irradiation) increased.<br>
By applying an antibody that inhibits a function of<br>
IL-18 or an IL-18 receptor antagonist to a mouse at 4 days after UV irradiation, the UV-dependent keratinocyte thickening otherwise formed in the subsequent 5 days was suppressed.<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an IL-18 receptor antagonist, more specifically a pharmaceutical composition for preventing and/or treating an IL-18-related disorder, particularly for preventing and/or treating skin thickening, which comprises an antibody against the IL-18 receptor a subunit and/or an antibody against the (3 subunit. Furthermore, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting the growth of keratinocytes in the human skin, and a method of increasing the differentiation of keratinocytes. As used herein, the term "IL-18-related disorder" is intended to mean a disease, disorder, or illness that develops with the involvement of an IL-18-dependent intracellular signal transduction mechanism. Therefore, an "IL-18-related disorder" is characterized by the presence of activated form IL-18.<br>
An IL-18 receptor antagonist according to the present invention has actions to suppress epidermal cell DNA synthesis, promote differentiation induction, and suppress epidermal thickening. Accordingly, an IL-18 receptor antagonist according to the present invention has an action to normalize the abnormal keratinization of skin epidermal cells, and can be used as a keratinization ameliorating agent. The keratinization ameliorating agent can be administered by internal, external application and any other methods; also, as active ingredients, in addition to an IL-18 receptor antagonist according to the present invention, anti-inflammatory agents, vitamins and the like in common use can be formulated as appropriate where necessary.<br>

(f) Involvement of IL-18 in stress-related disease<br>
It has been shown to date that the nervous system, the endocrine system and the immune system interact with each other to constitute a major host defense network. It has been proposed that controlling these interactions could be an important therapeutic strategy for autoimmune disease and inflammatory disease.<br>
The present inventors found, as described above, that by UV irradiation, that is, oxidative stress, the expression of IL-18 was facilitated at the irradiation site, and that by an IL-18 receptor antagonist, disorders caused by the oxidative stress were suppressed. This suggests that the expression of IL-18 may increase in response to various stresses, not limited to UV irradiation, and stress-related disease may occur as a result of the expression of IL-18.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors examined how IL-18 is involved in various stress loads. As a result, the present inventors found that IL-18 was involved in the<br>
interactions among the nervous system, the endocrine system and the immune system. Specifically, the present inventors found that a large amount of activated form IL- 18 (18-kD protein) was secreted in the plasma of mice exposed to immobilization stress.<br>
As used herein, the term "stress-related disease" is intended to mean a disease or disorder resulting from a non-infectious, non-chemical or non-injurious invasion from the outer world, and a response of an individual thereto (that is, stress), specifically a disease that can occur, exacerbate and/or progress due to physical, physiological, psychological, mental, or age-related invasion, and a disease the risk of onset thereof increases due to these invasions.<br>
As the disease suggested to be associated with stress, psychosomatic disorder, appendicitis, peptic ulcers, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, peritonitis, pancreatitis, ulcerative, pseudomembranous, acute and ischemic colitis, diverticulitis, epiglottitis, achalasia, cholangitis, cholecystitis, hepatitis, Crohn's disease, enterocolitis, Whipple's disease, asthma, allergies, anaphylactic shock, immune complex disease, ischemia of organs, repurfusion injury, necrosis of organs, hay fever, sepsis, septicemia, endotoxin shock, cachexia, hyperpyrexia, eosinophilic granuloma, granulomatous, sarcoidosis, septic abortion, epididymitis, vaginitis, prostatitis, urethritis, bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, pneumoconiosis, alveolitis, bronchiolitis, pharyngitis, pleurisy, sinusitis, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus infection, herpes infection, HIV infection, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection, disseminated bacteremia, dengue fever, candidiasis, malaria, filariasis, amebiasis, hydatid cysts, burns, dermatitis, dermatomyositis, sunburns, urticaria, warts, wheals, angiitis, vasculitis, endocarditis, arteritis,<br>
atherosclerosis, thrombophlebitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, periarteritis nodosa, rheumatic fever, Alzheimer's disease, celiac disease, congestive heajt failure, adult respiration distress syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, cerebral infarction, cerebral apoplexy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, neuritis, neuralgia, spinal injury, paralysis, uveitis, arthritic eruption, arthralgia, osteomyelitis, fasciitis, Paget's disease, gout, periodontal disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), synovitis, myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Goodpasture's syndrome, Behcet's syndrome, graft rejection in allotransplantation, graft-versus-host disease, type I diabetes mellitus, ankylosing spondylitis, Buerger's disease, type II diabetes mellitus, ankylosing spondylitis, Buerger's disease, Reiter's syndrome, Hodgkin's disease, SLE, liver cirrhosis, renal insufficiency, allergic asthma, nephritis, myocardial infarction, Sjoegren's syndrome, contact-type dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, depression, eating disorders, allotriophagy, dysgeusia, acne vulgaris, pemphigus, ichthyosis, psoriasis, burns, photosensitivity, ultraviolet dermopathy, or radiation disorders, carbon monoxide poisoning, hypoxia or deuteropathy thereto and the like can be mentioned.<br>
In these stress-related diseases, particularly in rheumatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, acne vulgaris, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, Sjoegren's syndrome, depression, and psychosomatic disease, it has been suggested that IL-6, which is a kind of cytokine, may be involved. In these diseases, the IL-6 concentration in serum rises according to the stress. Particularly in rheumatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis, it has been<br>
reported that the illness is ameliorated' by using an anti- IL-6 receptor antibody in experiments using respective animal models. However, when an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody is applied to a human (patient), the effect does not persist and a drawback of inconsistent effect occurs.<br>
The elevation of the concentration of blood IL-18 released due to stress originates from the adrenal. In patients with the above-described stress-related disease, it has been reported that irrespective of stress, IL-18 &gt; has risen (rarely decreased in atopic dermatitis). It has been shown that the promoter site for activation of IL-18 production differs between the elevation of IL-18 released due to stress and the elevation of IL-18 released due to inflammation or infection; therefore, it has been totally unknown whether or not the elevation of IL-18 observed in stress-related disease is due to stress.<br>
(g) Effects of IL-18 receptor antagonists on stress- related disease i	The present inventors found that if further stress<br>
was exerted on animal models (wild type, model mouse of collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus), a significant elevation of IL-18 in plasma was observed within several hours, and that this elevation i was suppressed by superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme for elimination of active oxygen, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, a caspase-11 inhibitor, and a caspase-1 inhibitor. This shows that a particular pathway for upregulating IL-18 exists, and that irrespective of the severity of j underlying inflammatory disease, this pathway is activated. Also, this result shows that unless ACTH secretion capability, adrenocortical function, and/or general protein synthesis capability is originally disordered, the blood IL-18 concentration rises due to stress in all ; diseases.<br>
In model mouse of multiple sclerosis, Sjoegren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), elevations of blood IL-18 concentration and subsequent elevations of blood IL-6 concentration were observed before the symptoms and signs exacerbated. Particularly, when model mouse of collagen- induced rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus were loaded with 3 hours of stress every two days, the completion of the pathology was speeded and the symptoms and signs exacerbated. Also, in a group receiving IL-18 receptor antagonists (anti-a antibody + anti-p antibody) intraperitoneally at 25 fig/kg (12.5 y.g of each antibody) immediately before stress (10 minutes before), amelioration of exercise and/or gait in RA, and significant amelioration of lupus nephritis (BUN and urinary albumin) in SLE were observed, and stress-related exacerbation was avoided. Although the same result was observed also when a commercially available anti-IL-6 antibody (Santa Cruz 1265) and anti-IL-6 receptor antibody (Santa Cruz 660) were used, the IL-18 receptor antagonists were more effective than the anti-IL-6 antibody or anti- IL-6 receptor antibody.<br>
Also, in experiments using wild type mouse and a model mouse of systemic lupus erythematosus, a suppression of the elevation of blood IL-6 concentration was observed when IL-18 receptor antagonists (anti-a antibody + anti-p antibody) were administered 30 minutes after the start of stress.<br>
From the results above, it was shown that in stress- related disease, a stress-induced elevation of blood IL-18 concentration and a subsequent elevation of blood IL-6 concentration occurred and the symptoms and signs exacerbated, that using an IL-18 receptor antagonist (particularly an anti-receptor antibody), the blood concentration not only of IL-18, but also of IL-6, could<br>
be suppressed, and that using an IL-18 or IL-6 receptor antagonist, it was possible to suppress the blood concentrations thereof, and as a result to suppress the exacerbation of symptoms and signs.<br>
Blood IL-18 has a very longer half-life than that of blood IL-6. Therefore, targeting IL-18 in the treatment of stress-related disease (that is, treating using an anti- IL-18 receptor antibody) is more effective than treating stress-related disease using an anti-IL-6 antibody or anti-IL-6 receptor antibody. This agrees with the fact that anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies (anti-a antibody + anti-p antibody) were more effective than anti-IL-6 antibody or anti-IL-6 receptor antibody in the treatment of stress-related disease.<br>
As described above, an IL-18 receptor antagonist according to the present invention enables to treat stress-related disease. Therefore, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition for treating a stress-related disease, which comprises an IL-18 receptor antagonist according to the present invention.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may be the above-described dermatological external preparation, cosmetic composition, or another drug composition. The dosage form and administration form of a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, and the carrier contained in the composition may be chosen as appropriate from among those described in the above-described sections for dermatological external preparation, cosmetic composition, or other drug composition.<br>
As used herein, the term "IL-18/IL-6-related disorder" is intended to mean a disease, disorder, or illness characterized by an elevation of blood IL-18 level and elevation of blood IL-6 level, like a stress-related disease.<br>
[3: Pharmaceutical composition comprising IL-18] (a) Effects of IL-18 on apoptosis<br>
The present inventors found as a new function of IL- 18 identified as an interferon y inducing factor to suppress and/or inhibit apoptosis.<br>
Usually, normal cultured cells undergo inhibition of the growth thereof due to cell contact prevention when subjected to mono-layer culture, but in cells with abnormal cell cycles like cancer cells, cell contact prevention does not occur and the cells continue to grow.<br>
The present inventors found that when activated form IL-18 was added to the culture medium for keratinocytes cultured at high density, apoptosis due to cell contact prevention was suppressed. Furthermore, the present inventors found that when an anti-IL-18 antibody was added to the culture supernatant of differentiation-induced cultured keratinocytes, apoptosis occurring in the differentiation process was suppressed. Hence, the present inventors investigated to determine whether or not apoptosis could be controlled via an IL-18-related signal transduction pathway.<br>
As the dermopathy after UV irradiation, inflammatory reactions in the acute stage, epidermal gene disorders, occurrence of skin thickening and desquamation due to overgrowth of keratinocytes, and suppression of tissue immunity can be mentioned. It was found that on the above- described disorders, IL-18 had the following effects:<br>
•	in the acute stage, IL-18 prevented epithelial loss due to excess apoptosis;<br>
•	in the middle and late stages, IL-18 caused overgrowth of keratinocytes and elicited immunosuppression in skin tissue (induction of IL-4 and IL-10).<br>
From the results of experiments using cultured keratinocytes, IL-18 causes signal transduction via p38<br>
MAPK and MEK3/6 to cells in the initial stage of differentiation induction. IL-18 exhibits functions as a survival factor, differentiation-inducing factor, and growth inducing factor in the respective stages of differentiation. On the other hand, by inhibiting IL-18 using an IL-18 receptor antagonist, skin hyperplasia or keloid formation was prevented.<br>
Because a pharmaceutical composition comprising IL-18 according to the present invention acts to promote the keratinization of the skin, it has an ameliorating effect on skin pigmentation (whitening effectiveness) by accelerating the metabolism of melanin, which is the causal substance for skin pigmentation caused by sunburns and the like, and can be used as a whitening agent. The keratinization ameliorating agent and whitening agent can be administered by internal, external application and any other methods, and can be formulated as appropriate with anti-inflammatory agents, vitamins and the like in common use, in addition to IL-18, as active ingredients as required.<br>
In one mode of embodiment, the present invention provides a composition having anti-apoptosis action, which comprises IL-18. As used herein, the term "anti-apoptosis- action" is intended to mean that the number of apoptotic cells decreases, that is, apoptosis is suppressed and/or inhibited.<br>
It can be said that a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may be any one comprising at least IL-18. Therefore, it should be noted that pharmaceutical compositions comprising other ingredients are also included in the technical scope of the present invention.<br>
[4: Pharmaceutical composition for preventing and/or treating IL-18-related disorder]<br>
As described above, the present inventors found that when further stress was exerted on animal models (wild type, model mouse of collagen-induced rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus), a significant elevation of IL-18 in plasma was observed within several hours, and that this elevation was suppressed by superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme for elimination of active oxygen, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, a caspase-11 inhibitor, and a caspase-1 inhibitor. Furthermore, by IL-18 receptor antagonists, the stress-dependent elevation of blood IL-18 concentration was suppressed. From these facts, it was found that superoxide dismutase (SOD), a p38 MAPK inhibitor, a caspase-11 inhibitor, or a caspase-1 inhibitor was effective in treating an IL-18-related disorder, preferably stress-related disease.<br>
In one aspect, a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is characterized by comprising superoxide dismutase for preventing and/or treating an IL- 18-related disorder.<br>
In another aspect, a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is characterized by comprising a p38 MAPK inhibitor for preventing and/or treating an IL-18-related disorder.<br>
In still another aspect, a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is characterized by comprising a caspase-1 inhibitor for preventing and/or treating an L-18-related disorder.<br>
In still yet another aspect, a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is characterized by comprising a caspase-11 inhibitor for preventing and/or treating an IL-18-related disorder.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may be the above-described dermatological external preparation, cosmetic composition, or other drug composition. The dosage form and administration form of a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention and the carrier contained in the composition may be chosen as appropriate from among those described in the above-described sections for dermatological external preparation, cosmetic composition, or other drug composition.<br>
It can be said that a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may be any one comprising at least superoxide dismutase (SOD), a p38 MAPK inhibitor, a caspase-11 inhibitor, or a caspase-1 inhibitor. Therefore, it should be noted that pharmaceutical compositions comprising other ingredients are also included in the technical scope of the present invention.<br>
The present invention is hereinafter described in more detail by means of the following Examples, but is not to be limited thereto.<br>
Examples<br>
(Example 1: Generation of anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies)<br>
According to an anti-peptide antibody experimental protocol (Shujunsha, 1994), antibodies against the IL-18 receptor a subunit and p subunit were produced. Specifically, peptides having the amino acid sequences shown by SEQ ID NO:5 to 10 were prepared (MBL Company), and these synthetic peptides were coupled with KLH (Calbiochem (374805)) using the MBS method, after which each coupled antigen (200 jig) was suspended in 1.5 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant (IATRON LABORATORIES) to prepare an antigen liquid, and a rabbit (Japanese White) were immunized with this antigen liquid by subcutaneous injection to the back thereof.<br>
(Table 1: Peptide antigens for generating anti-receptor antibodies)<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Subsequently, the above-described coupling antigen (200 fig) was suspended in 1.5 ml of Freund's incomplete adjuvant (IATRON LABORATORIES) to prepare an additional antigen liquid. One week after the first antigen liquid injection, this additional antigen liquid for booster immunization was subcutaneously injected 5 times at 1-week intervals. One week later, venous blood (20 ml or 100 ml) was drawn from the subaural vein using a 22-G indwelling needle. The venous blood drawn was allowed to stand at 37°C for 1 hour, after which it was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 30 minutes (4°C), and a serum fraction was extracted to obtain antisera containing the desired antibodies (anti-a antisera (A to D) and anti-p antisera (E and F)).<br>
As required, using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) columns coupled with respective antigen peptides, the antibodies were affinity-purified from the antisera.<br>
(Example 2: Investigation of anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies)<br>
As anti-IL-18 receptor a subunit antibodies, ACRIS Company's MsAgGl (H44 clone: anti-human) and GT Company's 70625<br>
14-P398 (anti-human) and 112624 14-P398 (anti-human) are currently commercially available, whereas no anti-IL-18 receptor p subunit antibody is commercially available.<br>
The anti-a antisera obtained in Example 1 (A to D) were compared with a commercially available anti-IL-18 receptor a subunit antibody.<br>
The above-described commercially available anti-IL-18 receptor a subunit antibodies are used for flowcytometry in cultured KG-1 cell samples, Western blot and ELISA in cultured KG-1 cell samples, neutralization of the IFN-y productivity of IL-18 secreted by cultured KG-1 cells, and the like, but cannot be used for immunohistochemistry of tissue specimens and Western blot of tissue extract.<br>
Recombinant human IL-18 (40 ng/ml) was added to a culture medium for commercially available human keratinocyte KG-1 cells (Cambrex Company, USA) at 1 x 105 cells/plate. As the recombinant human IL-18, the recombinant protein described in J. Immunol. 156: 4274-9 (1996) and Nature 378: 88-91 (1995) was used.<br>
Using a commercially available anti-IL-18 receptor a subunit antibody (ACRIS Company's MsAgGl) and the anti-a antisera obtained in Example 1 (A to D) at the same protein content, the neutralization of recombinant IL-18-dependent IFN-y productivity in KG-1 cells was compared.<br>
The neutralizing activities of all of the anti-a antisera obtained in Example 1 were nearly the same as the neutralizing activity of the commercially available a subunit antibody. These anti-a antisera (A to D) were found to have a neutralizing activity sufficiently more potent than that of the commercially available a subunit antibody because they contain antibodies other than a subunit antibodies. Also, all of the anti-p antisera obtained in Example 1 (E and F) had nearly the same levels of neutralizing activity as those of the anti-a antisera (A to D).<br>
Next, using these anti-a antisera (A to D) and anti-p<br>
antisera (E and F), flowcytometry, immunoprecipitation, Western blot, ELISA (brain homogenate soluble fraction, cultured KG-1 cells, and mouse peritoneal macrophage), and immunohistochemistry (OCT frozen, fresh frozen, paraffin- embedded sections) were performed. Whatever the antiserum used, clear results were obtained in the above-described experiments.<br>
Furthermore, antisera obtained by immunization using a mixed antigen of peptide a-A and peptide a-B, a mixed antigen of peptide a-C and peptide a-D, and a mixed antigen of peptide P~E and peptide p-F were further affinity-purified (anti-human a antibody, anti-mouse a antibody and anti-p antibody, respectively). Using these antibodies, as with the above- described antisera, clear results were obtained in the above- described experiments. Particularly, in Western blot analysis, the backgrounds were lower than those obtained using the above- described antisera; even when the protein content of the sample used in the analysis was 1/10, clear results were obtained. In the ELISA analysis, even when the protein contents of the samples used in the analysis was 1/5 to 1/2 compared to those obtained using the above-described antisera, clear results were obtained. Furthermore, all of the anti-human a antibody, anti- mouse a antibody and anti-p antibody had an affinity for antigen not less than 5 times higher than that of the commercially available antibody, and significantly inhibited the interferon-y production by IL-18 in KG-1 cells (ND50 (50% neutralization dose): 0.075 to 0.2 ng/ml: not less than 3 times higher than that of the commercially available antibody).<br>
Recently, an antibody against the IL-18 receptor p subunit was launched in the market (GT Company's 132016 14-P398 i (anti-human)). The data sheet thereof states that the antibody permits ELISA, Western blot, and neutralization of IL-18- dependent IFN-y productivity, and that the ND50 is 0.3 to 1.0 Hg/ml.<br>
However, it should be noted that the recombinant human ; IL-18 used by the present inventors used at the time of<br>
measuring the neutralizing activity (ND50) has an IFN-y production effect not less than 5 times higher than that of a commercially available rat IL-18 (GT Company) (data not shown). This is thought to be due to a difference in the protein folding occurring at the time of generation of the recombinant IL-18. Therefore, provided that the determination is performed using the recombinant human IL-18 used by the present inventors, the ND50 value of GT Company's anti-IL-18 receptor p subunit antibody should be greater than the value shown in the data sheet.<br>
As stated above, all of the anti-a antisera and anti-p antisera prepared in Example 1 could be used for the neutralization of the IFN-y productivity by IL-18, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, flowcytometry, and immunoprecipitation of tissue specimens, and Western blot of cultured cell samples and tissue extract. Furthermore, the anti-a antibodies and anti-p antibodies elicited by immunization with mixtures of a plurality of peptides were found to be superior to the anti-a antisera and anti-p antisera prepared in Example 1.<br>
(Example 3: Expression of IL-18 and IL-18 receptor in UV- irradiated mouse keratinocytes)<br>
In the Example below, the above-described anti-a antibodies and anti-p antibodies were used.<br>
After a wild type mouse (C57/B6: male) had the back shaven, 300 mJ of ultraviolet (UV) was irradiated. Changes in skin thickness in the back of the mouse after the UV irradiation were examined, and the expression of IL-18 and IL- 18 receptor was examined by immunohistochemistry using an anti- IL-18 antibody (MBL) and the anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies (anti-a antibodies and anti-p antibodies) prepared in Example 2.<br>
After anesthetization with diethyl ether, the mouse was died from blood loss by cutting the carotid. After the mouse was fixed by perfusion with a phosphate-buffered aqueous<br>
solution (pH 7.4) containing 4% para-formaldehyde, the skin (including the dermal layer and subcutaneous tissue) in the back of the mouse was collected. The skin was immersed and fixed in a phosphate-buffered aqueous solution (pH 7.4) containing 4% para-formaldehyde for 48 hours, after which it was dehydrated and immersed in paraffin to obtain paraffin- embedded tissue.<br>
The embedded skin tissue was sliced into sections 4 |am in thickness so that the cross-section was at a right angle with respect to the skin surface, and securely adhered onto a silane-coated slide glass. The following operation was performed on the section securely adhered onto the slide glass.<br>
The section was sequentially immersed in xylene, 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 80% ethanol, and 70% ethanol to deparaffin and hydrophilicize the section. Subsequently, this section was treated in 0.01% aqueous hydrogen peroxide to inactivate endogenous peroxidase, and washed with distilled water, after which blocking was performed in a phosphate- buffered aqueous solution containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (liquid A) for 1 hour.<br>
Next, this section was incubated in each primary antibody reaction liquid prepared using the above-described liquid A (containing 5 jig/ml of anti-IL-18 antibody, anti-a antibody or anti-p antibody, respectively) at 4°C for 24 hours. After the primary antibody reaction, the section was washed with phosphate-buffered aqueous solution, and incubated in a secondary antibody reaction liquid consisting of liquid A containing horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-goat IgG, anti-mouse IgG, or anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Company) (1 1 jig/ml) at room temperature for 3 hours. After the secondary antibody reaction, the section was washed with phosphate- buffered aqueous solution.<br>
Using a 0.05 M Tris-buffered saline containing 20 mg of 3-3-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Katayama Chemical Industries), the section was allowed to develop a color after the above- described reaction. After the color development was stopped, the section was washed, sequentially immersed in ethanol (70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 100%) and xylene for dehydration, and sealed with cover glass using a soft mount (Wako Pure Chemical).<br>
The results of an examination of the immunohistological specimens obtained using a light microscope are shown in Fig. 1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that at the UV irradiation site, keratinocytes grew to high degrees, and that the expression levels not only of IL-18, but also of the IL-18 receptor a subunit and |3 subunit increased (6 to 12 days later, 9 to 12 days later, 6 to 9 days later, respectively).<br>
(Example 4: Effects of anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies on mouse skin disorder due to UV irradiation)<br>
A wild type mouse (C57/B6: male) had the back shaven, 300 mJ of ultraviolet (UV) was irradiated; 4 days later, anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies (anti-a antibody and anti-p antibody used in mixture) were applied to the UV irradiation site (250 pg/cm2) , and 5 days later, skin thickness was measured.<br>
The epidermal thickening observed in untreated mice after 4 days following UV irradiation was suppressed by application of an anti-IL-18 receptor antibody (Fig. 2A).<br>
When UV irradiation was performed on IL-18 knockout (KO) mice in the same manner, epidermal thickening, observed after 4 days following UV irradiation in the wild type, was not seen (Fig. 2B).<br>
These results show that IL-18 is involved in epidermal thickening following UV irradiation, and that the anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies suppress epidermal thickening following UV irradiation.<br>
Next, an examination was performed to determine which of anti-a antibody and anti-p antibody provided the above- described results.<br>
As described above, a wild type mouse had the back shaven, and 300 mJ of ultraviolet (UV) was irradiated; 4 days later, an anti-IL-18 receptor antibody (anti-a antibody, anti-p antibody, or mixture) was applied to the OV irradiation site (250 pg/cm2) . Although skin thickening at the mouse irradiation site was suppressed whatever the anti-IL-18 receptor antibody used, the anti-a antibody was more effective than the anti-p antibody (Fig. 3) . In the mixed application of the anti-a antibody and the anti-p antibody, the thickness before UV irradiation was maintained; the mixed application was found to be the most effective.<br>
(Example 5: Changes in mouse keratinocytes due to ultraviolet irradiation)<br>
After a mouse had the back shaven, 300 mJ of ultraviolet (UV) was irradiated; after the irradiation, the processes of skin loss, thickening, and repair were examined with a focus on keratinocytes.<br>
When ultraviolet was irradiated to a wild type mouse (C57/B6: male), the following changes were observed in the epidermis:<br>
1)	Early changes (observed within 24 hours)<br>
(a)	Swelling and reddening of epidermis<br>
(b)	Apoptotic epidermal keratinocyte layer loss<br>
2)	Midterm changes (observed on days 2 to 5)<br>
(c)	Occurrence of epidermal keratinization and desquamation<br>
(d)	Increase in expression levels of IL-18 receptor protein and IL-18 protein<br>
(e)	Activation of growth and/or differentiation of keratinocytes, and accompanying epithelial thickening<br>
3)	Late changes (observed on days 5 to 15)<br>
(f)	Epithelial thickening (reached a peak on day 10)<br>
(g)	Hair re-development (after day 12).<br>
Likewise, when ultraviolet was irradiated to IL-18 (-/-) mice (C57/B6 background: male), the above-described (b) was remarkably increased, but (c), (e), and (f) were mild and (g) was observed on days 4 to 6.<br>
(Example 6: Activation of intracellular signal transduction molecules at OV irradiation site)<br>
In the skin of wild type mice (C57/B6: male) after OV irradiation, signal transduction molecules involved in growth and/or differentiation (MEK3/6 and p38 MAPK) accumulate along with skin thickening. Also, in the skin after the UV irradiation, cyclin Dl, which is a cell cycle marker protein, is highly produced. However, in IL-18 (-/-) mice (C57/B6 background: male), these phenomena are not observed (Fig. 4A, Fig. 5A and Fig. 6A) . These facts suggested that in the keratinocytes after UV irradiation, the signal transduction pathway mediated by MEK3/6 and p38 MAPK might be activated IL- 18 -dependent ly to express cyclin Dl, and that the growth and/or differentiation of the keratinocytes might be controlled. Hence, in the UV-irradiated wild type and IL-18 KO mice, using an antibody against MEK3/6, an antibody against p38 MAPK (both anti-phosphorylated protein antibodies that recognize the activated form), and an antibody against cyclin Dl, the activation of these signal transduction molecules in the keratinocytes at the UV irradiation site was examined.<br>
In the same manner as Example 3, changes in mouse back skin thickness after the UV irradiation were examined, and immunohistochemical specimens concerning the above-described signal transduction molecules were prepared.<br>
Specifically, except that an anti-cyclin Dl antibody (400 fold, cell signaling technology), an anti-phosphorylated MEK3/6 antibody (400 fold, SantaCruz), an anti-p38 MAPK antibody (100 fold, Cell Signaling Technology) and an anti-phosphorylated p38 MAPK antibody (400 fold, Cell Signaling Technology) were used as the primary antibodies, immunohistological specimens were prepared in the same manner as the technique performed in Example 3.<br>
In the wild type, the phosphorylation of MEK3/6 and p38 MAPK occurred, whereas in the IL-18 KO mice, the<br>
phosphorylation of MEK3/6 and p38 MAPK did not occur, and the expression level of cyclin Dl decreased compared to the wild type (Fig. 4B, Fig. 5B and Fig. 6B).<br>
Furthermore, the IL-18-dependent activation of MEK3/6 and ; p38 MAPK and the expression of cyclin Dl due to UV irradiation were suppressed by applying an anti-IL-18 receptor antibody to the irradiation site (Fig. 4B, Fig. 5B and Fig. 6B).<br>
From the results above, it was shown that at the UV irradiation site of mouse keratinocytes, the IL-18-dependent i activation of MEK3/6 and p38 MAPK and the expression of cyclin Dl occurred, and as a result the growth and/or differentiation of the keratinocytes occurred.<br>
(Example 7: Effect of IL-18 receptor antagonist on hair re- i growth at UV irradiation site)<br>
In the same manner as Example 3, after wild type mice (C57/B6: male) and IL-18 (-/-) mice (C57/B6 background: male) had the back shaven, 300 mJ of ultraviolet (UV) was irradiated; immediately after the UV irradiation, an anti-IL-18 antibody ) was applied to the irradiation site or administered intraperitoneally.<br>
Mouse back skin (2 x 2.6 cm) after the UV irradiation was collected periodically. Each skin specimen collected was divided into 2-mm squares under a stereoscopic microscope, and &gt; the percentage of hair growth area in each division was<br>
examined microscopically. The percentages of hair growth areas in all divisions were statistically processed, and the data were evaluated to determine the percentage of hair growth area in the skin specimen. 3	At the UV irradiation sites of the mice applied with the<br>
anti-IL-18 receptor antibody immediately after the UV irradiation (250 pg/cm2) , hair re-growth was promoted. Specifically, hair re-growth observed after 12 days following UV irradiation was observed 7 days after the UV irradiation 5 with the application of the anti-IL-18 receptor antibody.<br>
Similar results were obtained by intraperitoneal administration at 2000 pg/mouse (Fig. 7) .<br>
The above-described results show that by inhibition of the function of IL-18, hair growth is promoted.<br>
Comparing the effects of the application and intraperitoneal administration in this Example, intraperitoneal administration was slightly more effective, but the effects differed by changing the base used for application. From this fact, a similar effect to that obtained with intraperitoneal administration can be expected, provided that a base is chosen, even in the case of application.<br>
(Example 8: Effect of IL-18 on cultured human keratinocytes)<br>
Commercially available human keratinocyte KG-1 cells (Cambrex Company, USA) were sown to a 6 cm plate in diameter having a keratinocyte growth medium (Kurabo Industries) dispensed thereto (2 x 105 cells/plate). The cells were grown for 10 days, after which recombinant IL-18 was added to the medium (final concentration 500 pg/ml). As the recombinant IL- 18, the recombinant protein described in J. Immunol. 156: 4274- 9 (1996) and Nature 378: 88-91 (1995) was used. Without the addition of the recombinant IL-18 or with the addition of PBS, apoptosis due to contact inhibition was induced in the keratinocytes. However, when IL-18 was added, apoptosis due to contact inhibition was suppressed for at least 10 more days (results not shown).<br>
Next, the effect of IL-18 on differentiated keratinocytes was examined. As described above, KG-1 cells were sown to a 6 cm plate in diameter having a keratinocyte growth medium (Kurabo Industries) dispensed thereto (2 x 10s cells/plate). After the cells were grown for 6 days until they reached 70% confluency, 1.2 mM CaCl2 was added to the medium, and the cells were allowed to differentiate. When an anti-IL-18 antibody (MBL Company) was added to the medium (final concentration 1 jig/ml) at the time of differentiation induction, apoptosis of<br>
differentiated keratinocytes observed without the addition of anti-IL-18 antibody was suppressed (Fig. 8).<br>
At the time of differentiation induction, IL-18 (final concentration 500 pg/ml) or an anti-IL-18 antibody (final concentration 500 pg/ml) was added to the medium; 12 days later, TUNEL-stained cells were counted, and the number of cells having apoptosis induced therein was calculated. The results are shown in Fig. 9.<br>
Without the addition of IL-18 or the anti-IL-18 antibody or with the addition of PBS (negative control), in the differentiated keratinocytes, cells having apoptosis induced therein (apoptotic cells) were observed even after day 12 following differentiation induction were observed, but when IL- 18 was added, the number of apoptotic cells observed decreased significantly.<br>
Also, when the anti-IL-18 antibody was added, the number of apoptotic cells observed increased significantly. When the differentiation of keratinocytes was induced, IL-18 was produced in a large amount and secreted in the culture supernatant (results not shown). Therefore, it can be thought that the anti-IL-18 antibody inhibited the function of IL-18 secreted with the differentiation induction of keratinocytes.<br>
From the results above, it was shown that IL-18 inhibited apoptosis induced in human keratinocytes, whether in undifferentiated state or differentiated state.<br>
(Example 9: Effect of IL-18 on UV-dependent or radiation- dependent apoptosis of keratinocytes)<br>
As shown in Example 8, apoptosis in cultured keratinocytes was suppressed by IL-18. Hence, the effect of IL- 18 on apoptosis dependent on DNA damage due to UV in UV- irradiated mouse keratinocytes was examined.<br>
A skin section prepared in the same manner as Example 3 was subjected to a proteolytic treatment using Proteinase K liquid at 37°C for 5 minutes. After the section was washed with<br>
en<br>
PBS(-), the DNA terminus exposed due to fragmentation by apoptosis was labeled in TdT liquid (at 37°C for 2 hours). After washing, this section was incubated in a reaction liquid comprising an HRP-conjugated anti-TdT antibody (at 37°C for 30 minutes) to bind peroxidase to the DNA cleavage end resulting from apoptosis. After incubation, the section was washed, and allowed to develop a color in the same manner as Example 3, after which it was dehydrated and embedded.<br>
An evaluation of the number of apoptosed cells was performed by TUNEL staining. Using an apoptosis detection kit (Wako Pure Chemical) according to the instructions thereof, TUNEL staining was performed. The number of apoptotic cells can be counted as TUNEL staining-positive cells. The number of apoptotic cells was obtained by counting six visual fields in the same section under a light microscope (x 100), and the mean number for the six visual fields was used as the number of apoptotic cells in the section.<br>
As shown in Example 5, when ultraviolet was irradiated to wild type mice (C57/B6: male), an apoptotic loss of epidermal keratinocyte layer ((b) above) was observed as an early change in the epidermis (observed within 24 hours), and when ultraviolet was irradiated to IL-18 (-/-) mice (C57/B6 background: male), this phenomenon was remarkably enhanced (Fig. 10) .<br>
In the mice having IL-18 applied (500 pg/cm2) immediately after the UV irradiation, apoptotic cells decreased significantly (Fig. 11A). Similar results were obtained by application at 250 pg/cm2 and intraperitoneal administration at 2000 pg/mouse. Also, in the IL-18 KO mice, the induction of apoptosis by UV irradiation occurred at high levels (Fig. 11A).<br>
Radiation (4 Gray) was irradiated in place of UV, and apoptotic cells were examined in the same manner. In the mice applied (500 pg/cm2) with IL-18 immediately after radiation irradiation, apoptotic cells decreased significantly (Fig. 11B) . Similar results were obtained by intraperitoneal administration<br>
at 1500 pg/mouse. Also, in the IL-18 KO mice, the induction of apoptosis by UV irradiation occurred at high levels (Fig. 11B).<br>
These results show that using IL-18, epithelial skin disorders to the skin caused by UV or radiation (particularly apoptotic loss of epithelium) can be prevented and/or treated.<br>
For mouse skin disorders after UV irradiation, recombinant IL-18 was applied or intraperitoneally administered, and the effects thereof were examined. Specifically, when IL-18 was applied to the skin (250 pg/cm2) or intraperitoneally administered (1000 pg/mouse) to mice immediately after the UV irradiation, all of the changes (a) to (g) shown in Example 6, except the occurrence of desquamation, mitigated.<br>
When IL-18 at the above-described concentration was applied for a long time (3 weeks or more), slight skin thickening not accompanied by skin hardening occurred (desquamation due to promoted keratinocyte differentiation was prevalent). However, skin disorders due to UV irradiation were slightly mitigated.<br>
From the results above, it was shown that it was appropriate to apply or intraperitoneally administer a low concentration of IL-18 immediately after irradiation of UV or radiation.<br>
(Example 10: Effects of IL-18 on stress-related disease)<br>
It has been shown to date that the nervous system, the endocrine system and the immune system interact with each other to constitute a major host defense network. It has been proposed that controlling these interactions could be an important therapeutic strategy for autoimmune disease and inflammatory disease. The present inventor found that IL-18 was involved in the interactions among the nervous system, the endocrine system and the immune system.<br>
The involvement of nitrogen oxide (NO) on mouse plasma IL-18 was examined. Mice (wild type or iNOS (NO synthase) knockout mice) were given restraint stress, and N02/3 levels<br>
and IL-18 levels in plasma were examined. Also, the time course of plasma IL-18 level in iNOS knockout mice injected with recombinant IL-18 were examined. In the wild type mice, the N02/3 concentration in plasma rose, whereas in the iNOS knockout mice, the concentration did not rise. In the wild type mice, the IL-18 level in plasma rose from 50 pg/ml to 1000 pg/ml, and in the iNOS knockout mice, the level rose to 3000 pg/ml. From the results of immunoblotting, the IL-18 protein in plasma was the 18-kD activated form. When changes in plasma IL- 18 level were compared between the iNOS knockout mice and the wild type mice, there was a difference in the reduction in plasma IL-18 level.<br>
From the results above, it was shown that (1) in mice exposed to restraint stress, the N02/3 concentration in plasma rose, and that (2) in mice exposed to restraint stress, the activated form IL-18 level in plasma rose. iNOS was found to particularly inhibit the upregulation of stress-induced plasma IL-18 levels.<br>
Furthermore, the effect of restraint stress on mouse plasma IL-18 level was examined. The effects of ACTH and anti- ACTH antibody on plasma IL-18 levels in stressed mice were also examined. Using immunoblotting, IL-18 proteins in plasma and in the adrenal were characterized. Due to restraint stress, IL-18 protein levels in plasma and in the adrenal increased (&gt;1000 pg/ml). The anti-ACTH antibody significantly suppressed the above-described increase in the level of IL-18 protein. With ACTH administration, the IL-18 protein level in the adrenal increased, but with the induction of ACTH per se, the IL-18 protein level in plasma did not rise. From the results of immunoblotting, it was found that the IL-18 protein in the adrenal was mainly the 24-kD inactivated form, and the IL-18 protein in plasma was the 18-kD activated form.<br>
From the results above, it was shown in mice exposed to restraint stress that (1) activated form IL-18 was upregulated via the HPA axis in plasma, that (2) in the adrenal,<br>
inactivated form (24 kD) IL-18 was induced, cleaved and secreted in blood as the 18-kD activated form, and that (3) the cleavage from the inactivated form to the activated form was an important factor concerning the upregulation of IL-18 in plasma. Hence, it was shown that IL-18 was involved in the interactions among the nervous system, the endocrine system and the immune system.<br>
(Example 11: Effect of NADPH oxidase antagonist on plasma IL-18 concentration with stress load)<br>
Wild type mice (C57/B6: male) and CYBB (NADPH oxidase gene) (-/-) mice (C57/B6 background: male) were restrained in plastic tubes (27 millimeters in diameter) for 6 hours, after which cardiac blood was drawn under anesthesia. Plasma was collected via centrifugation, and IL-18 concentrations in plasma were measured using an ELISA method (Quantikine R&amp;D Company). To one group of wild type mice, 1 hour after the start of stress loading, DIPHENYLENEIODNIUM (DPI: NADPH oxidase inhibitor) was administered intraperitoneally at 30 jig/animal, and the effect thereof was examined (Fig. 12).<br>
The elevation of IL-18 concentration in plasma was suppressed to 400 pg/ml by DPI administration in the wild type, but in the mice lacking the CYBB gene, it remained at 300 pg/ml. These results show that by suppressing NADPH oxidase, the stress-dependent elevation of plasma IL-18 can be suppressed. Also, regarding the elevation of plasma IL-18 due to stress, it was shown that the NADPH oxidase antagonist, which is an antagonist of active oxygen, functioned as a suppressant. (**; p
Also, a similar experiment was performed by intravenous injection, and similar results were obtained (data not shown).<br>
(Example 12: Effect of anti-IL-18 receptor antibody on stress- dependent elevation of serum IL-6 level)<br>
Wild type mice (C57/B6: male) and IL-18 (-/-) mice (C57/B6 background: male) were restrained by the same method as Example 11, after which they were liberated individually into cages. Six hours after the liberation, serum was collected by the same method as Example 11, and IL-6 concentrations in serum were measured (Fig. 13) .<br>
It was shown that in the IL-18 (-/-) mice, the elevation of IL-6 in serum was at an extremely low level, and that IL-18 was involved in the stress-dependent elevation of serum IL-6 level.<br>
Note that although the data are not shown in the figure, the elevation of IL-6 level caused by 3 hours of stress was suppressed by intraperitoneally administering anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies (anti-a antibody + anti-p antibody) at 25 jig/kg 10 minutes before stress loading.<br>
(**; p
(Example 13: Stress-dependent elevation of serum IL-18 level in disease model mice)<br>
As mice that spontaneously develop nephritis and/or arthritis and the like, MRL/lpr mice (Charles River Japan Inc., 12 weeks), which are widely recognized as a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus, were loaded with stress in the same manner as Example 11, after which serum IL-18 levels were examined (Fig. 14).<br>
In the MRL/lpr mice, an stress-dependent elevation of serum IL-18 level was observed. Although the data are not shown in the figure, this elevation, as in the wild type mice, was suppressed by SOD, DPI, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, a caspase 1 inhibitor, and a caspase 11 inhibitor. (**; p
(Example 14: Stress-dependent elevation of plasma IL-6 level in disease model mice)<br>
The MRL/lpr mice (12 weeks) used in Example 13 were loaded with 3 hours of stress, after which plasma IL-6 levels were examined. Furthermore, a variety of anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies were administered 10 minutes before the start of restraint, and the effects of these antibodies were examined. As the anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies, an anti-a antibody, an anti-p antibody, and mixtures thereof were used (Fig. 15).<br>
Although the plasma IL-6 level rose due to stress, this elevation of plasma IL-6 level was suppressed by intraperitoneally administering anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies (anti-a antibody + anti-p antibody) at 25 jig/kg 10 minutes before stress loading. Although suppression was obtained by administration of the anti-a antibody or anti-p antibody alone, administration of the mixture was more effective.<br>
(Example 15: Effect of anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies on the stress-dependent elevation of urinary albumin level in disease model mice)<br>
The MRL/lpr mice used in Example 13 (12 weeks) were stressed for 3 hours every two days for 3 weeks, and albumin contents in one-day pool of urine after the stress loading were measured. Also, 10 minutes before the start of restraint, anti- IL-18 receptor antibodies (anti-a antibody + anti-p antibody) were intraperitoneally administered at 25 jig/kg, and the effects of the antibodies were examined. Furthermore, an anti- IL-6 antibody (Santa Cruz Company, SC1265) was administered, and its effect was examined (Fig. 16).<br>
In the MRL/lpr mice, the urinary albumin content rose due to stress loading, and the urinary albumin content in the antibody administration group was suppressed. The urinary albumin content in the anti-IL-18 receptor antibody administration group was lower than that in the anti-IL-6 antibody administration group, and this was similar to the level in the non-stress-loaded group.<br>
(**; p
(Example 16: Effects of anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies on stress-dependent elevation of BON in disease model mice)<br>
BUN (blood urea nitrogen) in MRL/lpr mice (12 weeks) was measured in the same manner as Example 15 (Fig. 17).<br>
In the MRL/lpr mice, BUN rose in the stress-loaded group, but the elevation of BUN was suppressed in the antibody administration group. The BUN in the group receiving anti-IL-18 receptor antibodies (anti-a antibody + anti-p antibody) at 25 Hg/kg by intraperitoneal administration 10 minutes before stress loading was lower than that of the anti-IL-6 antibody administration group, and this was similar to the level in the non-stress-loaded group. (**; p
