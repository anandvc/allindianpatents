				<td>Semifinished Textile Product With at Least One Surface Provided With an<br>
Adhesive<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a semifinished textile product with at least one<br>
surface provided with an adhesive according to the preamble of claim 1. It is known<br>
to give self-adhesive properties to textiles used as reinforcing materials for the<br>
production of fiber-reinforced components - so-called composites. In particular in the<br>
automotive industry, boat construction or in the field of rotors for wind turbine<br>
generators, where relatively large and complex preforms of dry reinforcing materials<br>
are to be produced, there is an interest in fixing the individual textile layers. For this<br>
purpose, usually, a so-called textile binder, for example a hot melt adhesive on the<br>
basis of epoxy resins or polyamides or similar meltable strong resins, are applied on<br>
the surface of the textiles. These self-adhesive textiles can then be placed in a mold<br>
and held on the mold or on a layer already fixed thereon, by the adhesive.<br>
Also, in the construction of sandwich components, there is often the need to ensure<br>
the adhesion of textile layers on the core material used. This is usually balsa wood or<br>
foams of polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP),<br>
polyurethane (PUR), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polymethacrylimide<br>
(RohacellÂ®).<br>
A drawback of the hot melt adhesives hitherto used is that they are not tacky in<br>
ambient temperature and therefore have to be heated for activation, or that with<br>
adhesives that are sufficiently tacky at room temperature, the tackiness of the textiles<br>
is reduced after just a short period of time, so that the textile cannot be stored over a<br>
longer period of time without losing tackiness. This is due to the affinity of such melt<br>
adhesives with respect to the coating of the fibers used, in particular if they are<br>
formulated on the basis of epoxy resin, and to the capillary effect of the filaments.<br>
These effects cause that the adhesive applied to the surface of the reinforcing<br>
material migrates into the interior of the textile after a short period of time. Other<br>
textile binders applied in powder form are not tacky at room temperature, but must be<br>
superficially melted in order to achieve fixing of the layers.<br>
Furthermore, it is known to apply styrene-dissolvable rubber or rubber emulsions on<br>
the textiles to make their surfaces tacky.<br>
Since rubber can only be dissolved with difficulty in the matrix resins used for<br>
composite production, rubber remains a foreign material within the fiber-reinforced<br>
component.<br>
The consequences are bad surface quality of the fiber composite components, and a<br>
non-tolerable reduction of the mechanical strength values of the components by<br>
more than 25%.<br>
The present invention is therefore based on the object to suggest a semifinished<br>
textile product with a tacky surface, which can be stored over longer periods of time<br>
and that has, if possible, no deleterious influence on the strength of the fiber<br>
composite components made thereof, in spite of its tackiness.<br>
According to the present invention, the object is achieved by the characterizing<br>
features of claim 1. Advantageous embodiments are defined in the dependent<br>
claims.<br>
By partially crosslinking at least one constituent of the adhesive subsequent to the<br>
application of the adhesive on the semifinished textile product, the adhesive is<br>
immobilized. By immobilizing the adhesive on the surface of the semifinished textile<br>
product, further entering and/or soaking of the adhesive into the semifinished textile<br>
product can be avoided so that the adhesive is almost completely present on the<br>
surface even after long periods of storage time.<br>
The partially crosslinked constituent of the adhesive is the product of a partial<br>
crosslinking of at least one monomer containing double bonds, wherein the partial<br>
crosslinking is initiated by a well dosed application of energy on the surface of the<br>
semifinished product, so that the partial crosslinking can take place after application<br>
of the adhesive on the semifinished product.<br>
A partial ester produced by converting an epoxy resin with an unsaturated carboxylic<br>
acid is used as the monomer containing double bonds. This has the advantage that<br>
an intermolecular link of the network resulting from the polymerization of the double<br>
bonds with the network resulting from a later crosslinking of existing epoxy groups<br>
(so-called interpenetrating networks) is enabled.<br>
To produce the partial esters, preferably bisphenol A , bisphenol F epoxy resins<br>
and/or particularly preferably epoxidized novolaks are used. The unsaturated<br>
carboxylic acid can be selected from C1 to C12 carboxylic acids, wherein the use of<br>
acrylic and methacrylic acids is particularly preferred, because they are available in<br>
sufficient quantities as cheap standard chemicals and have a suitable reactivity with<br>
respect to the epoxy group.<br>
The partial ester is advantageously made by means of an incomplete conversion of<br>
an epoxy resin with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, wherein the incomplete reaction<br>
is controllable by the stoichiometry of the starting materials. This reaction is<br>
described in Publication of German Patent Application DE 10223313 A1,<br>
incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
The adhesive preferably further includes at least the following further constituents: an<br>
epoxy resin, a rubber component and an initiator.<br>
A preferred composition of the adhesive contains, with reference to the weight of the<br>
entire mixture, about 25 - 40% rubber, 5 - 10% epoxy resin and 40 - 60% partial<br>
ester. Moreover, the adhesive formulation includes a suitable initiator in the usual<br>
concentration from 0.2 - 3% (particularly preferably 1 - 2%). Furthermore, the<br>
adhesive can include the usual additives, such as pigments, processing aids or<br>
additives to improve wetting of surfaces.<br>
Particularly preferably the initiator is a photoinitiator able to be activated by UV light,<br>
or a peroxide, because this enables the extent of the chemical partial crosslinking of<br>
the adhesive to be controllable.<br>
An epoxy resin according to the prior art can be used for the semifinished textile<br>
product according to the present invention, wherein it is advantageous if the epoxy<br>
resin is a bisphenol A resin, a bisphenol F resin, tetraglycidyl methylene dianiline<br>
(TGMDA), triglycidyl paraaminophenol (TGPAP) and/or an epoxidized novolak. The<br>
advantages of these epoxy resins are that they are compatible with the other<br>
components of the adhesive, have excellent mechanical properties and ensure good<br>
tackiness.<br>
Furthermore, at least one rubber component, which can be a synthetic or natural<br>
rubber, is necessary for the semifinished textile product according to the present<br>
invention. Particularly suitable is amine and/or carboxy-terminated butadiene-nitrile<br>
rubber (Hycar CTBN or ATBN) with a mean molecular weight of 2000 to 6000<br>
g/mole, preferably mixed with NBR having a molecular weight of 20000 g/mole to<br>
2000000 g/mole, particularly preferably 50000 g/mole to 1000000 g/mole, because it<br>
has optimum tackiness and good compatibility with epoxy resins. By the prior<br>
conversion of the rubber component with epoxy resins, also referred to as adducting,<br>
the product properties can be additionally optimized. Carboxy-functionalized<br>
butadiene rubbers with a molecular weight of 2000 to 10000 g/mole, which can be<br>
produced, for example, by converting the homopolymerisates with maleic anhydride,<br>
are also suitable.<br>
Particularly advantageously the adhesive used for the production of the semifinished<br>
product according to the present invention is capable of swelling and/or capable of<br>
partial solution in reaction resin mixtures containing epoxy resins, because this<br>
results in particularly close mixing of the adhesive with the resin matrix. This is<br>
essential for the resulting mechanical strength of the component made thereof.<br>
As the textile base for the manufacture of the semifinished textile product according<br>
to the present invention, advantageously layers of fibers, woven, knitted and/or non-<br>
woven fabrics are used alone or in combination. These reinforcing materials can be<br>
of glass, carbon, aramid, natural fibers, such as flax, hemp, sisal or basalt fibers.<br>
Other textile materials and constructions known from the prior art are also possible.<br>
The application of the adhesive on the textile base is preferably by means of sprayin<br>
a solution or melt of the adhesive, wherein an amount of 2 to 50 g/m2, particularly<br>
preferably 4 to 15 g/m2, are applied to achieve optimum adhesive tackiness.<br>
The semifinished textile products according to the present invention can be<br>
preferably used for the production of fiber-reinforced plastic materials, wherein the<br>
reaction resin used herein preferably includes an epoxy resin, or is an epoxy resin.<br>
The particular advantage of the adhesive according to the present invention is the<br>
chemical reaction of the epoxy groups contained in the adhesive with the epoxy<br>
group of the reaction resin used and the resulting advantageous strength properties<br>
of the fiber composite component.<br>
The semifinished textile products according to the present invention have stable<br>
surface tackiness over a period of more than 4 months up to several years. Even at<br>
temperatures of about 60Â°C, good tackiness is maintained for a period of several<br>
weeks to months.<br>
Moreover, the semifinished textile products according to the present invention have<br>
the advantage that textile reinforcement layers can be excellently positioned in a<br>
component mold and repositioned multiple times as needed, and thus enable the<br>
manufacture of complex three-dimensional preform geometries. The semifinished<br>
textile products according to the present invention are particularly suitable for the<br>
production of fiber-reinforced components in vacuum infusion and resin injection<br>
processes (such as in resin infusion, resin transfer molding etc).<br>
Furthermore, the semifinished textile products according to the present invention<br>
have the advantage that the adhesive used does not significantly affect the<br>
mechanical strength values of the fiber-reinforced component.<br>
The properties achieved enable the semifinished textile products according to the<br>
present invention to be used for the manufacture of lightweight structures in the field<br>
of automotive engineering, aerospace, boat and ship building, sports articles and<br>
rotor blades for wind turbine generators.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following with reference to two<br>
