This invention relates to a fluid diverter valve assembly which is particularly, though not exclusively useful for a liquid dispensing device such as water filter and purifier assembly. Flow of the fluid through the valve body is channelized by the operation of the valve elements housed within the valve body.<br>
Description hereinafter is directed to the fluid diverter valve assembly in association with a water filter and purifier. However it should be understood that the valve assembly of this invention may be connected to any known fluid dispenser. The valve may be installed on the main water line, to divert the water supply to the water purifier without affecting the normal water supply through the tap. Installation of this assembly on the main line enables back flush operation of a sediment filtration unit of the water purifier by diverting the water flow through the sediment filtration unit in the direction opposite to the normal direction. This increases the filtration efficiency and the life of the sediment filter unit as back flush operation may be carried out as frequently as desired by rotation of the knob provided in the valve assembly. Yet another advantage of using the diverter valve in the existing water dispensing unit is in integrating back flushing without disturbing the existing interconnecting tubes.<br>
Accordingly, this invention relates to a fluid diverter valve assembly which comprises a valve enclosure body having a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet, at least a first and a second opening for diverting fluid flow there through, said first and second opening connectable respectively to a back flush arrangement and fluid dispensing arrangement of a known fluid dispenser, a spring loaded sealing means for sealing said first opening and a regulator for regulating the flow of fluid through said second opening. This invention also includes a water purifier and filtration device provided with a diverter assembly as described herein above.<br><br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the figures in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. I is the cross sectional view of the fluid diverter valve assembly.<br>
Reference numeral 1 indicates the valve body enclosure. Numerals 2 and 3 indicate the knob with the back flush sealing assembly and the regulator for regulating the flow of the fluid respectively. Numeral 4 indicates the first opening which is scalable by the sealing assembly and numeral 5 shows the second opening for fluid flow which can be regulated by the regulator indicated by numeral 3. Letters A and B indicate the direction of fluid flow.<br>
Fig. II is a sectional view of the spring loaded sealing means for sealing the first opening (4) of the diverter valve assembly. Reference numeral 6 indicates the rotatable knob which houses the spring loaded sealing assembly. Spring of this assembly is indicated by 9. Number 7 is a lock pin while reference numeral 8 shows the sealing member of the spring loaded assembly. Reference numeral 10 indicates another sealing member which closes the first opening when the spring loaded assembly is activated by rotating the knob 6. This figure shows the sealing assembly in a closed position.<br>
Fig, III is yet another view of the sealing assembly. This figure shows the open position of the first opening achieved by the rotation of knob 6.<br>
Fig. IV is a sectional view of the regulator means of valve assembly. Numeral 5 indicates the second opening of the valve assembly. Numeral 11 indicates the fluid flow regulator. Numeral 12 represents the fluid sealing means while numeral 13 shows the water flow regulating seal.<br><br>
Method of operating the device will be herein after described with respect to a water purifier and filtration device though it may be applied to any fluid dispensing device.<br>
The valve assembly of this invention is connected to the supply line and to the water filter through the threaded provided at the inlet and outlet of the body. The first opening (4) is sealed by rotating the knob (2). This allows water from the tap to flow through the second opening (5) to the water purifier.<br>
During back flushing operations, the unit should be switched off Back flushing operation required for cleaning sediment filtration unit of the water purifier, the knob pulled up and rotated to reposition the lock pin 7 which is held in position by the spring (9). Water flows through the first opening which is connected to the sediment filter in the reverse direction. This cleans the sediment filtration unit and removes particles adhered to its surface. The dislocated particles will be flushed out through the inlet of the water filter unit through a tap fixed to the diverter valve assembly which is not shown in the drawings.<br>
Once back flushing operation is complete, the first opening of the diverter valve is closed and the other is directed to the sediment filter through the second opening.<br>
Water flow regulator is used for controlling the flow of water through the filter and purifier assembly and this is achieved by turning the regulator knob. Seals are provided for sealing any water leaks during its operation.<br>
Though this invention has been described herein before with a specific embodiment particularly relating to water filtration and purifying device, it m.ay be applied to any fluid dispenser which requires back flushing operation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A fluid diverter valve assembly comprising a valve enclosure body (1) having a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet (A &amp; B), at least a first and a second opening (4 &amp; 5) for diverting fluid flow therethrough, said first and second opening connectable respectively to a back flush arrangement and fluid dispensing arrangement of a known fluid dispenser, a spring loaded sealing means (8) for sealing the first opening, and a regulator (11) for regulating the flow of fluid through said second opening.<br>
2.	The fluid diverter valve assembly as claimed in claim 1 wherein a rotatable knob houses said spring loaded sealing assembly means.<br>
3.	The fluid diverter valve assembly as claimed in claims 1 and 2 wherein said sealing means is provided with a lock pin, sealing means for closing said first opening and sealing means to prevent fluid leakage.<br>
4.	The fluid diverter valve assembly as claimed in claims 1 to 3 wherein said regulator is rotatable and is provided with sealing means for preventing fluid leakage and for closing said second opening.<br>
5.	The fluid diverter valve assembly as claimed in claims 1 to 4 wherein said valve assembly is provided with a tap provision for draining back flushed fluids.<br><br>
A water purifier and filtration device provided with a sediment filtration mode provided with a diverter valve assembly as claimed in any of the claims 1 to 4 wherein said first opening is connected to the sediment filtration mode to allow the fluid flow in the reverse direction, said second opening is connected to the inlet of said water purifier and filtration unit.<br>
A fluid diverter valve assembly substantially as herein described with particular reference to the figure in the accompanying drawings.<br>
A water purifier and filtration device having a sediment filtration mode provided with a fluid diverter valve assembly as claimed in claims 1 to 5 substantially as herein described.<br><br></td>
