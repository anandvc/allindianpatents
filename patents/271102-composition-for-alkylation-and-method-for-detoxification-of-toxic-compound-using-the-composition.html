A COMPOSITION FOR THE ALKYLATION AND A METHOD FOR DETOXIFYING A HARMFUL COMPOUND BY USING THE COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for the alkylation and a method for<br>
detoxifying a harmful compound by using the composition.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
The heavy metal material such as arsenic, antimony and selenium is widely used<br>
as an industrial material, for example, semiconductor, but the influence on the<br>
organism by being flowed it out into an environment is concerned, since it is<br>
harmful material for the organism.<br>
[0003]<br>
In the past, as a method for treating these heavy metal, a method wherein a<br>
flocculating agent such as polychlorinated aluminum (PAC) is added into the<br>
wastewater containing an inorganic arsenic such as a harmful arsenous acid, and<br>
then the inorganic arsenic is removed by the filtration after the inorganic arsenic<br>
is aggregated, adsorbed to the flocculating agent and iron contained in a raw<br>
water and then precipitated, or a method wherein an arsenic compound etc. is<br>
adsorbed by using an activated alumina, cerium based flocculating agent, are<br>
generally known.<br>
[0004]<br>
On the other hand, it is known in nature that an inorganic arsenic is stored in sea<br>
food such as a seaweed, and then a part of the inorganic arsenic is converted to<br>
an organic arsenic compound such as dimethyl arsenic by the physiological<br>
response (Nonpatent literature 1 : Kaise et al., 1998, Organomet. Chem., 12 137-<br>
143).    And it is generally known that these organic arsenic compound has lower<br>
toxicity than that of the inorganic arsenic for the mammal.<br>
[0005]<br>
Nonpatent literature 1 : Kaise et al., 1998, Organomet. Chem., 12 137-143<br><br>

Problems to be resolved by the invention<br>
[0006]<br>
However, in the above method of removing the heavy metal    characterized by<br>
the use of the filtration and adsorption, it is necessary to store or reclaim a<br>
polluted sludge containing the harmful compound such as the inorganic arsenic<br>
which is still harmful, and an absorbent to which the harmful compound is<br>
absorbed, under the condition of sealing off the harmful compound with the use<br>
of the concrete etc., in order to prevent it from being leaked to the outside.<br>
Therefore, there is problem that the mass disposal is difficult since a storage<br>
place or a large space for a reclaimed area are required.<br>
[0007]<br>
Moreover, it is internationally recognized that an arsenic contained in the sea<br>
food is a harmless arsenobetaine, in the present invention, it is possible to attain<br>
the detoxification by chemically converting the highly toxic inorganic arsenic to<br>
the harmless arsenobetaine.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention [0053]<br>
The composition for the alkylation according to the present invention contains a cobalt complex.    The cobalt complex used herein is not particularly limited, but an organometallic complex having a cobalt- carbon bond etc., may be recited as an example. [0054]<br>
As an example of the organometallic complex having a cobalt- carbon bond may be mentioned below. That is, methylcobalamin (methylated vitamin B12, official name: Coa-[a-5,6- dimethylbenz-lH- imidazole-1-yl-Cop-methylcobamide]) is preferably used. Furthermore, mention may be made of at least one selected from the groups comprising the methyl complex of at least one compound selected from vitamin 312 such as cyanocobalamin, cobalt(II) acetyl acetonate, cobalt(ni) acetyl acetonate, cobalt carbonyl (dicobalt octacarbonyl), cobalt(II)l,1,1,5,5,5- hexafluoro acetyl acetonate, cobalt(II) meso-tetra phenyl porphin, hexafluoro phosphoric acid bis (pentamethyl cyclopenta dienyl) cobalt, N, N'-bis (salicylidene) ethylene diamine cobalt(II), bis (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato) cobalt(II), (chlorophthalocyaninnato) cobalt(II), chlorotris (triphenylphosphine) cobalt(I), methyl complex of cobalt(II) acetate, cobalt(II) benzoate, cobalt(II) cyanide, cyclohexane cobalt(II) butyrate, 2-cobalt(II) ethylhexanoate, meso-tetramethoxyphenyl porphyrin cobalt(II), cobalt naphthenate, cobalt(II) phthalocyanine, methyl cobalt(III) protoporphyrin IX, cobalt stearate, cobalt(II) sulfamate, (IR, 2R)-(-)-l,2-cyclohexanediamino-N,N'-bis (3,5-di-t-butylsalicylidene) cobalt(II), (IS, 2S)-(+)-l,2-cyclohexanediamino-N,N'-bis (3, 5-di-t-buty!salicylidene) cobalt(II), cyclopentadienyl bis (triphenylphosphine) cobalt(I), cyclopentadienyl cobalt dicarbonyl, dibromo bis (triphenylphosphine) cobalt(II), (tetraaminochloro phthalocyaninnato) cobalt(II), (tetra-t-butyl phthalocyaninnato) cobalt(II), or at least one selected from the groups comprising cobalt-methyl complex formed by allowing the cobalt compound to coexist with the alkyl halide, especially methyl halide. Methylcobalamin is preferable as the organometallic complex having a cobalt-<br><br>
carbon bond, from the viewpoint that it is possible to make it relatively easy to<br>
alkylate the harmful compound containing a harmful inorganic arsenic etc., and<br>
covert it to an organic material which has a less toxic.<br>
[0055]<br>
That is, in the composition for the alkylation according to the present invention,<br>
it is possible to alkylate the harmful compound containing at least one element<br>
selected from the groups comprising arsenic, antimony and selenium by using the<br>
organometallic complex.    The term "the harmful compound" used herein means<br>
a compound which gives any adverse affect to the organism when it is flowed out<br>
into the environment and exposed to the organism.<br>
[0056]<br>
As  a  harmful  compound  containing arsenic  among the  harmful  compound,<br>
mention may be made of arsenious acid, arsenic pentoxide, arsenic trichloride,<br>
arsenic  pentachloride,  arsenic  sulfide  compound,  cyano  arsenic  compound,<br>
chloro arsenic compound, and other arsenic inorganic salt and or the like.    In<br>
these arsenic, for example, LD5o(50% of the fatal dose in mouse) is less or equal<br>
to 20, and therefore, it is generally a poisonous value for the organism.<br>
[0057]<br>
Further, as a harmful compound containing antimony, mention may be made of<br>
antimony  trioxide,  antimony  pentoxide,  antimony  trichloride,  and  antimony<br>
pentachloride and or the like.<br>
[0058]<br>
Further, as a harmful compound containing selenium, mention may be made of<br>
selenium dioxide and selenium trioxide.<br>
[0059]<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the composition of the present invention may further<br>
contain a reducing agent to reduce at least one metal selected from the groups<br>
comprising arsenic, antimony and selenium.    The presence of the reducing agent<br>
makes it possible to further accelerate the alkylation.    Although it is thought<br>
that a reducing ability for the arsenic or the transmethylation reaction are likely<br>
to be a rate controlling in the conversion to the arsenobetaine, it is thought that<br>
the conversion to the arsenobetaine etc., may be accelerated by adding those<br><br>
reducing agents. As the reducing agent like this, for example, a material having the SH group may be mentioned, which may be specifically at least one selected from the groups comprising glutathione, reduced glutathione (GSH), cysteine, S-adenosyl cysteine, sulforaphane, homocysteine and thioglycol. Moreover, any combination of these materials having the SH group may be used. For example, combinations of glutathione + homocysteine, or glutathione + thioglycol etc., may be mentioned. [0060]<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment of the composition for the alkylation according to the present invention, a ratio between a molarity [Reducing Agent] of the reducing agent to reduce at least one metal selected from the groups comprising arsenic, antimony and selenium and a molarity [Metal] of the metal selected from arsenic, antimony and selenium, that is, a [Reducing Agent] / [Metal] is greater or equal to 1000. More preferably, the ratio is greater or equal to 10000. This is because in such conditions, it is possible to attain the alkylation in a high rate, and then to attain the detoxification of the harmful compound containing arsenic etc., effectively when the composition of the present invention is applied to the method of detoxifying the harmful compound as mentioned later. [0061]<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment of the composition for the alkylation according to the present invention, a ratio between a molarity [Co complex] of the Co complex and a molarity [Metal] of the metal selected from arsenic, antimony and selenium, that is, a [Co complex] / [Metal] is greater or equal to 100. More preferably, the ratio is greater or equal to 1000. This is because in such conditions, it is possible to attain the alkylation in a high rate, and then to attain the detoxification of the harmful compound containing arsenic etc., effectively when the composition of the present invention is applied to the method of detoxifying the harmful compound as mentioned later. [0062]<br>
According to the molarity ratio as mentioned above, it is possible to attain one of the primary objective of the present invention, that is, which an extremely-<br><br>
poisonous inorganic arsenic (Acute toxicity value: LD50 0.03g/kg) etc., can be converted high - efficiently to a methylated arsenic etc., having a lower toxicity by the methylation of the inorganic arsenic. The methylated arsenic etc., having a lower toxicity which is an objective product are trimethylarsineoxide (Acute toxicity value; LD50 I0.6g/kg) or arsenobetaine (Acute toxicity value; LD50 lO.Og/kg) etc. It is possible to reduce a toxicity up to 1/300 compared with that of the inorganic arsenic etc., these harmless arsenic etc., can be obtained at 10% or more, preferably at 50% or more, more preferably at 90% or more at relative yield. [0063]<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment of the composition for the alkylation according to the present invention, the composition further contains a methylating additive factor having S-Me group. The presence of the methylating additive factor having S-Me group makes it possible to produce more alkyl groups, and thereby, to attain more alkyation, and consequently more detoxification. As the methylating additive factor, mention may be made of at least one selected from the groups comprising methionine and S-adenosyl methionine. [0064]<br>
Furthermore, the composition for the alkylation according to the present invention may further contain a buffer solution. Those generally used for the isolation, purification or preservation of the biomedical materials may be used for the buffer solution, and those are not particularly limited, but mention may be made of the buffer solution such as a tris buffer, a phosphate buffer, a carbonic acid buffer, and a boric acid buffer. Furthermore, in a viewpoint that it is possible to attain the detoxification more safely, a pH of the buffer solution is preferably in the range of 5-10, A pH of the composition for the alkylation is more preferably less than 9. The composition for the alkylation of the present invention may further contain H2O2. That is, H2O2 may be added in a viewpoint that an acute toxicity can be decreased by enhancing the oxidation state (from trivalent to pentavalent). [0065]<br><br>
Furthermore,   the   composition   for  the   alkylation   according  to   the   present<br>
invention may further contain an organic halide compound.    In a viewpoint that<br>
it is possible to make it easy to convert a dimethyl compound and/or a trimethyl<br>
compound to arsenobetaine, methyl halide may be recited as the organic halide<br>
compound.    In a viewpoint of a high reactivity of the methylation, as the methyl<br>
halide mention may be made of at least one selected from the groups comprising<br>
methyl iodide, methyl bromide and methyl chloride.<br>
[0066]<br>
In addition, in a viewpoint of a high reactivity of the alkylation, as the organic<br>
halide mention may be made of at least one selected from the groups comprising<br>
iodoacetic acid, iodoethanol, bromoacetic acid, bromoethanol and iodopropionic<br>
acid.<br>
[0067]<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the organic halide is the halogenated acetic acid.    As<br>
an example of the halogenated acetic acid, mention may be made of at least one<br>
selected from the groups comprising chloroacetic acid, bromoacetic acid and<br>
iodoacetic acid.<br>
[0068]<br>

mention may be made of at least one selected from the groups comprising methyl<br>
chloride, methyl bromide, methyl iodide, chloroacetic acid, bromoacetic acid,<br>
iodoacetic acid, chloroethanol, bromoethanol, iodoethanol, chloropropionic acid,<br>

bromoacetic acid ethyl ester and iodoacetic acid ethyl ester.<br>
[0069]<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, the organic halide compound may be the<br>
Grignard reagent represented by the following chemical formula 1:<br>
Chemical formula I:	RMgX<br>
(wherein R=Me, CH2COOH or CH2COOC2H5, X=C1, Br or I).<br>
[0070]<br>
Moreover, the use of the organic halide compound as mentioned above is mainly<br>
explained in a viewpoint that it is possible to methylate the harmful compound.<br><br>
in more detail, to make it easy to convert dimethyl compound and/or trimethyl<br>
compound to stable arsenobetaine.<br>
[0071]<br>
On the  other  hand,  an  organic  halide  compound  as  mentioned  below  is<br>
exemplified  as those  capable of being object for the  detoxification by the<br>
dehalogenation  in  a  method  of detoxifying  the  organic  halide  compound<br>
according to the present invention as described later.<br>
[0072]<br>
That is,  as  an  organic  halide compound which may  be  intended  for the<br>
detoxification,   mention  may  be  made  of those  selected  from  the  groups<br>
comprising a pesticide, a fire retardant, dioxin, PCB, DDT, trihalomethane,<br>
trichloroethyl and chloroform.    In the case that these materials are not purified,<br>
these materials may be used as appropriate forms (regardless of a liquid, a gas or<br>
a solid) capable of introducing them into the reaction system in the conventional<br>
procedure such as an extraction and the separation etc.     Since the cobalt<br>
complex is existed in the composition for the alkylation according to the present<br>
invention, the catalytic action of the cobalt complex makes it possible to<br>
dehalogenate the above harmful organic halide, and thereby, to detoxify the<br>
harmful organic halide by the dehalogenation.<br>
[0073]<br>
The composition for the alkylation according to the present invention may further<br>
contain   a   reducing  agent  to   reduce   the   cobaU   complex.      This   has   an<br>
advantageous effect that it is possible to convert the oxidation state of the cobalt<br>
complex to an active oxidation state thereof by the presence of the reducing agent,<br>
as described later.<br>
[0074]<br>
The reducing agent like this is not particularly limited as long as it can make the<br>
cobah complex become activated, but for example, mention may be made of at<br>
least one selected from the groups comprising titanium oxide and ruthenium<br>
complex.<br>
[0075]<br>
Next, the method of detoxifying the harmful compound according to the present<br><br>
invention is explained. Namely, the method of detoxifying the harmful compound according to the present invention is characterized in that a harmful compound containing at least one element selected from the groups comprising arsenic, antimony and selenium is detoxified by the alkylation of the harmful compound, in the presence of the composition for the alkylation according to the present invention as described above. The composition for the alkylation according to the present invention, and the harmful compound used herein mean those explained above, these explanation may be applicable for the method of detoxifying the harmful compound according to the present invention. [0076]<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment of the method of detoxifying the harmful compound according to the present invention, in the viewpoint that the 50% of an inhibition of cell growth concentration (IC50) or the 50% of a lethal dose (LD50) is greater, and therefore it is possible to attain more detoxification, the detoxification of the harmful compound is preferably attained by increasing the oxidation number of a valence of the one element contained in the above harmful compound. Specifically, it is possible to increase the oxidation number of a valence of the one element by the alkylation with the use of the composition of the present invention as described above as a catalyst for the reaction. Moreover, it is preferable to convert a trivalent of the oxidation number of a valence to a pentavalent in the case that the element is arsenic or antimony, and it is preferable to convert a tetravalent of the oxidation number of a valence to a hexavalent in the case of selenium. [0077]<br>
In the present invention, the detoxification of the harmful compound is carried out by alkylating the harmful compound.    At this moment, the present invention may attain the detoxification by alkylating at least one bond of the one element contained in the above harmful compound. [0078]<br>
Specifically, it is possible to alkylate at least one bond of the one element by carrying out the reaction with the use of the composition for the alkylation of the present invention as described above.    As an alkyl group added to the one<br><br>
element, mention may be made of a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group<br>
etc. In a viewpoint that it is possible to attain the detoxification more effectively,<br>
a methyl group is preferable as an alkyl group.<br>
[0079]<br>
In the method of detoxifying the harmful compound according to the present<br>
invention, in a viewpoint of the safety for the living organism, the 50% of a<br>
lethal dose (LD50) (an oral toxicity which render a 50% of the fatal dose in<br>
mouse) of the compound detoxified by the above alkylation is preferably greater<br>
or equal to lOOOmg/kg, more preferably greater or equal to 5000mg/kg.<br>
[0080]<br>
Furthermore, in the method of detoxifying the harmful compound according to<br>
the present invention, in a viewpoint of the safety for the living organism, the<br>
50% of an inhibition of cell growth concentration (IC50) of the compound<br>
detoxified by the above alkylation or arylation is preferably greater or equal to<br>
lOOOfiM, more preferably greater or equal to 3000^M.    The term "the 50% of an<br>
inhibition of cell growth concentration (IC50)" used herein means a numerical<br>
value which gives a necessary concentration of certain substance in order to<br>
block or inhibit a 50% of the 100 cell proliferation with the use of the substance.<br>
It shows that smaller the numerical value of IC50, the larger the cytotoxicity.<br>
Moreover, IC50 was calculated from a result of examination of the cytotoxicity<br>
which gives a plasmid DNA damage under the condition at 37°C, for 24 hours.<br>
[0081]<br>
At this moment, IC50 of each arsenic compound is shown in table 1<br>
[0082]	[Table 1]<br><br>
24h, 37°C<br><br>
[0083]<br>
From  the  table   1,   it  is  revealed  that  arseno  sugar(III)  having  a  trivalent<br>
arsenic(III)   has   higher  cytotoxicity  than   those   of monomethylated  arsenic<br>
(MMA) and dimethylated arsenic (DMA) having a pentavalent arsenic, but has<br>
lower cytotoxicity than those of monomethylated arsenic (MMA), dimethylated<br>
arsenic (DMA) having a trivalent, and arsenious acid.    On the other hand, it is<br>
recognized that monomethylated arsenic (MMA), dimethylated arsenic (DMA)<br>
having a trivalent arsenic has higher cytotoxicity than that of arsenious acid<br>
(trivalent and pentavalent), but as a whole, the arsenic (V) compound having a<br>
pentavalent arsenic has higher safety for the living organism than that of the<br>
arsenic   (III)   compound   having  a  trivalent  arsenic   in  a  viewpoint  of the<br>
cytotoxicity.<br>
[0084]<br>
Moreover, LD50 of each arsenic compound is shown in table 2<br>
[0085]<br>
[Table 2]<br><br>
[0086]<br>
Furthermore, in the method of detoxifying the harmful compound according to the present invention, a biological half-life of the compound detoxified by the above alkylation is preferably less or equal to 8 hours in a viewpoint of the safety for the living organism. In the method of detoxifying the harmful compound according to the present invention, it is preferable to convert the harmful compound to the dimethyl compound or the trimethyl compound by means of the<br><br>
methylation in a viewpoint that they are safer and has a lower toxicity. As the dimethyl compound mention may be made of dimethyl arsonyl ethanol (DMAE), dimethyl arsonyl acetate (DMAA), dimethylarsinic acid or arseno sugar. As the trimethyl compound mention may be made of arsenocholine, arsenobetaine, trimethyl arseno sugar or trimethyl arsine oxide. [0087]<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment of the method of detoxifying the harmful compound according to the present invention, the method is characterized that the organic halide selected from the groups comprising a pesticide, a fire retardant, dioxin, PCB, DDT, trihalomethane, trichloroethyl and chloroform is detoxified by the dehalogenation of the organic halide in the presence of the composition according to the present invention as mentioned above. [0088]<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment of the method of detoxifying the harmful compound according to the present invention, it is possible to detoxify the organic halide selected from the groups comprising a pesticide, a fire retardant, dioxin, PCB, DDT, trihalomethane, trichloroethyl and chloroform by the dehalogenation of the organic halide in the presence of the composition according to the present invention as mentioned above, and then to detoxify the harmful compound containing at least one element selected from the groups comprising arsenic, antimony and selenium by the alkylation thereof in the presence of cobalt complex obtained by the reaction. [0089]<br>
That is, if an inherently harmful organic halide, such as a pesticide, a fire retardant, dioxin, PCB, DDT, trihalomethane, trichloroethyl and chloroform is reacted in the presence of the composition for the alkylation according to the invention, the dehalogenation of the organic halide comes about, whereas an organic cobalt complex is also came about by the reaction, as a result, an organic material in the organic cobalt complex may be one of the resource of the aikyl groups for the alkylation of the harmful heavy metal. In other words, it is possible to convert the harmful compound such as the  inorganic arsenic to<br><br>
harmless substances, that is, the organic arsenic, with the use of the resource of<br>
the alky] groups thus obtained.<br>
[0090]<br>
Furthermore,  in a preferred embodiment of the method of detoxifying the<br>
harmful  compound according to the present invention,  the  method further<br>
comprises the step of exposing to the light in the presence of the reducing agent<br>
to reduce the cobalt complex.    The exposure to the light makes it possible to<br>
convert the cobalt(II) complex to a cobalt(I) complex with an active oxidation<br>
state.    The cobalt complex(I) has an advantageous effect that the organic halide<br>
compound is detoxified by the dehalogenation by reacting the complex with the<br>
harmful organic halide compound to be dehalogenated, whereas the organic<br>
material may be also obtained which may become the resource of the alkyl<br>
groups.<br>
[0091]<br>
The reducing agent like this, is not particularly limited as long as it can make the<br>
cobalt complex active, but for example, mention may be made of at least one<br>
selected from the groups comprising titanium oxide and ruthenium complex.<br>
[0092]<br>
Next, the explanation of the method of detoxifying the organic halide according<br>
to the present invention is as follows.<br>
[0093]<br>
That is, the method of detoxifying the organic halide according to the present<br>
invention is characterized in that an organic halide selected from the groups<br>
comprising a pesticide, a fire retardant, dioxin, PCB, DDT, trihalomethane,<br>
trichloroethyl and chloroform is detoxified by the dehalogenation of the organic<br>
halide in the presence of the composition according to the present invention as<br>
described above.    In the case that the organic halide selected from the groups<br>
comprising a pesticide, a fire retardant, dioxin, PCB, DDT, trihalomethane,<br>
trichloroethyl and chloroform is some forms which can not be introduced into the<br>
reaction system, these materials may be used as appropriate forms (regardless of<br>
a liquid, a gas or a solid) capable of introducing them into the reaction system<br>
according to the conventional procedure such as an extraction, the separation and<br><br>
purification etc.     According to the  present method,  cobalt complex  in the<br>
composition of the present invention makes a contribution to the alkylation as<br>
well as the dehalogenation of the organic halide, and then makes it possible to<br>
attain  the   detoxification   of the   organic   halide.     As just  described,   the<br>
composition of the present invention is extremely valuable.    As is the case with<br>
the method of detoxifying the harmful compound of the present invention as<br>
described above, the composition may be exposed to the light in the presence of<br>
the reducing agent to reduce the cobalt complex.    The explanation of the method<br>
of detoxifying the harmful compound may be also directly applicable for an<br>
explanation about the reducing agent etc., used in the method of detoxifying the<br>
organic halide.<br>
[0094]<br>
Moreover, Figure 30 shows a mechanism concerning the methylation of arsenic<br>
trioxide in the case of vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin: CH3-Cob(III)) as an<br>

It was confirmed that the methylation was further proceeded, as a result, dimethylated arsenic (DMA) was also generated in Example 2. The remarkable effects was confirmed that the harmful inorganic arsenic was detoxified by being converted it to methylated arsenic having a lower toxicity in the presence of MeCo. [0105]<br><br>
Further, the methylation of selenium was also examined.    Fig. 31 gives a HPLC-<br>

[0113]<br>
[Table 4]<br><br>
[00114]<br>
As shown in Examples 3-1 to 3-3, the concentration of dimethyl arsenic (DMA)<br>
increased as time advances.    The generation of DMA was not observed in the<br>
comparative example 2.    As shown in Examples 4-1 to 4-3, the concentration of<br>
trimethyl arsenic (TMAO) increased, it was revealed that an arsenic substrate<br>

(1) Culture of the microalgae<br>
The microalgae, chlorella {Chlorella vulgaris 1AM C-629strain) cultivated in<br>
advance until a logarithmic growth phase was inoculated so as to obtain a 1 x 10^<br>
cells/mL in 150mL Bold's Basal (BB) medium and was cultured with static<br>
culture   method   under   exposure   to   the   fluorescent   light   (4000Lux,   24hr<br>
illumination), at 25°C.    In this case, a culture medium was prepared by adding<br>
lOmM of glucose or lOmM of sodium acetate as a carbon source to the culture.<br>
[0125]<br>
(2)Accumulation test of the arsenic<br>
The accumulation test of the arsenic was carried out by adding arsenous acid to<br>
the culture medium to obtain 1 ppm as a metal arsenic after the inoculation, and<br>
then culturing the microalgae for 284 hours after the addition of arsenic.<br>
[0126]<br>
(3)	Measurement of the content of arsenic<br>
The qualitative and quantitative analysis concerning inorganic arsenic and organic arsenic contained in alga body was carried out by using the inductively-coupled plasma ion mass spectroscope (Agilent 7500ce) directly connected to the high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent 1100) online with the retention time of the standard sample compared with that of the reaction product. [0127]<br>

[0129]<br><extraction of the arsenic compound from microalgae in which is></extraction>
accumulated&gt;<br>
A microalgae extract (wherein chlorella is treated to extract it with methanol, and<br>
then methanol is removed by the evaporation) was prepared.    To this added a<br>
purified water to dilute  it and to obtain a solution having a concentration<br>
described   in the  following table  6.     Moreover,  the  component  of an  UN<br>
(Unknown) I and UN6 was belonged as a compound corresponding to arseno<br>
sugar (Figure 1).    Figure 1 gives a HPLC-ICP-MS analysis of a chlorella extract<br>
(Upper: standard sample, Lower: sample).    Table 6 shows a concentration (ppm)<br>
of arsenic compound of the chlorella extract.<br>
[0130]<br>
[Table 6]<br><br><br>
[0131]<br><conversion to ab><br>
Into an Eppendorf tube with 1.5mL volume 740^L of a reaction buffer solution (20mM Tris-HCl ( pH7.6 ) ) was added. To this was added 220 |iL of 20mM GSH aqueous solution, stirred with Voltex for 30 seconds, and then allowed at 37X for 30 minutes. To this was added 100 ^L of the chlorella extract and stirred for 30 seconds. To this was added 135 |j,L of 7.4 mM methylcobalamin (MeCo) aqueous solution. To this was added 68mg of MIAA (0.35 |JM) to dissolve them. This was reacted in a constant temperature bath maintained at 37°C, the increasing amount of the product obtained with sampling at regular intervals was examined. As shown in Figure 2, the generation of AB could be confirmed in the case that GSH, MeCo and MIAA are existed. Figure 2 gives a HPLC-ICP-MS analysis of a chlorella extract (Upper: standard sample. Middle: GSH addition (NE 14-7), Lower: MeCo + GSH + MIAA addition (NE 15-7)).<br><br><conversion of arseno sugar to dma><br>
100|iL of the chlorella extract was mixed with 4N of NaOH aqueous solution<br>
(ImL), and allowed at 80°C overnight.    The conversion of arseno sugar to DMA<br>
was confirmed since DMA was generated(Figure 3).<br>
[0134]<br><conversion of dma to ab><br>
The experiment was carried out in the same manner as in Examples 1-7.    Figure<br>

15-4) are added to the chlorella extract, respectively, and NaOH treatment<br>
(lower) are subject to the chlorella extract.    Furthermore, Figure 4 shows a<br>
condition in the case that GSH + MeCo + MIAA are added to DMA (NE 9-4).<br>
[0135]<br><br>
Example 10<br>
Further, the experiment was carried out by using methylcobalamin as a cobalt<br>
complex.    At first, into a 1.5mL of Eppendorf tube lOmg of methylcobalamin<br>
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. ) was added.    To this was added 1 mL of<br>
an  ultrapure  water (18Mfi / cm)  to  dissolve  methylcobalamin  (7.4mmol/L)<br>
(Solution A).    Into a 1.5mL of Eppendorf tube 30.7 mg of glutathione (reduced<br>
form) was added to dissolve it with ImL of the ultrapure water (lOOmmol/L)<br>
(Solution B).    Arsenous acid aqueous solution (for an atomic absorption :<br>
lOOppm : as metal arsenic) was prepared (Solution C).    Selenious acid aqueous<br>
solution (for an atomic absorption : lOOOppm : as metal selenium) was prepared<br>
(Solution D).    lOOmmol/L of Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.8, O.Olmol/L, pH<br>
was adjusted by using hydrochloric acid solution) was prepared (Solution E).<br>
Into a 1.5mL of Eppendorf tube 720 |xL of the solution E, 20(j.L of the solution C,<br>
220 \LL of the solution B were added respectively, and allowed at 37°C for 1 hour.<br>
To this were added 20 j^L of the solution A and 20 f^L of the solution D, and then<br>
reacted in a constant temperature bath maintained at 37°C.    The condition of the<br>
reaction is as follows:<br>
[0136]<br><condition of the reaction><br>
Concentration of the substrate : [As]=30|imol/L<br>
Concentration of native vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) : [MeCo]=150|xmol/L<br>

[0137]<br>
A qualitative and quantitative analysis was carried out by using a HPLC-ICP-MS<br>
method at regular time intervals with sampling 50 p.L to dilute it by ten times<br>
with the ultrapure water (No. 1-8 of the table 7).<br>
[0138]<br>
[Table 7]<br><br><br>
[0139]<br>
Figure 7 shows a variation per hour of the concentration of the arsenic compound<br>
in the reaction solution (which is in graph form of the result of the table 7).<br>
Moreover, with sampling 50 ^L from the reaction solution to obtain a sample,<br>
and the obtained sample was treated with 50 ^L of hydrogen peroxide solution<br>
(37°C, 1 hour) to dilute it by ten times with the ultrapure water so that the<br>
reaction product could be analyzed in a similar way (No. 9-11 of the table 7).<br>
Figures 5 and 6 give a HPLC-ICP-MS chromatogram.<br>
[0140]<br>
Example 11<br>
The experiment was carried out in the same manner as in Example 10, except that<br>
the solution B was adjusted to a pH 7 in lOOmM Tris-HCl buffer solution in<br>
Example 10.<br>
[GUI]<br>
The table 8 and figures 8-17 show the results.    Approximately 50% of arsenous<br>
acid was methylated.    The table 8 shows the concentration of the arsenic<br>
compound in the reaction solution.<br>
[0142]<br>
[Table 8]<br><br><br>
*No.l-7 : before H2O2 treatment.      **No.8-I4 : after H2O2 treatment.<br>
[0143]<br>
As it is clear from the table 8, it was revealed that it is possible to render them<br>
harmless by means of converting As(III) into As(V) with a high oxidation number,<br>
that is, increasing an oxidation number, by using H2O2 treatment.<br>
[0144]<br>
Example 12<br>
The experiment was carried out in the same manner as in Example 10, except that<br>
it was carried out under the condition that a pH of the reaction solution after<br>
preparation was a value shown in table 9.<br>
[0145]<br>
The table 9 and frgures 18-29 show the results.    Approximately 50% of arsenous<br>
acid in the case of a pH 6.7 was methylated.    On the other hand, in the case of a<br>
pH 9, the methylation was not progressed.    The table 9 shows the concentration<br>
of the arsenic compound in the reaction solution.<br>
[0146]<br>
[Table 9]<br><br><br>
[0147] Example 13<br>
Next, the synthesis of [Cob(II)]C104 from cyanocobalamin was attempted. 1. Oxidation-reduction of the cobah complex, and the reaction of the methylation (1) The synthesis of [Cob(II)]C104 from cyanocobalamin <reaction scheme> [0148] [Chemical 1]<br><br><br>
[0149]<br><experiment procedure><br>
50mg of cyanocobalamin (which is Cob(III) shown in the above [chemical 1]) is<br>
dissolved in lOOmL of methanol, and then it is deaerated by a nitrogen bubbling.<br>
To this is added 400mg of NaBH4 (1.05mol) to confirm a green color originated<br>
from Co(I).    To this is added 3 mL of 60 % HC104aq.    To this is added 50 mL of<br>
water to extract with methylene chloride.    After washed it with water, h is dried<br>
with anhydrous sodium sulfate so that it might be solidified under reduced<br>
pressure.    This is re-precipitated with benzene/n-hexane to obtain a powder with<br><br>
30mg of [Cob(lI)]C104 is dissolved in lOOmL of methanol, and then it is deaerated by a nitrogen bubbling. To this is added 300mg of NaBH4 (0.788mol) to confirm a green color originated from Co(I). It is recognized that in a viewpoint of the reaction of Cob(II) to Cob(I) shown in reaction scheme 2 [Chemical 2], the cobalt(III) complex existing in the composition for the alkylation of the present invention may convert to cobalt(II) complex, thereby cobalt(II) complex thus obtained is reduced by a photocatalyst or a chemical reducing agent as described in the following Example 14 to obtain a cobalt(I)<br><br>
complex.    The cobalt (I) complex may be utilized as the substrate of the reaction<br>
of the dehalogenation.    That is to say, it is possible to detoxify the organic<br>
halide compound by using the cobalt (I) complex thus obtained.<br>
[0153]<br>
Example 14<br>
Next, the synthesis of [MeCob(II)] by reacting [Cob(I)] with CH3I (the reaction<br>
of the dehalogenation of the halide) was examined.<br>
[0154]<br>
(3)	The synthesis of [MeCob(II)] by reacting [Cob(I)] with CH3I (the reaction of<br>
the dehalogenation of the halide)<br><br>
37mg of CH3I (2.6x10"'^ mol) is added under the dark place, and stirred for 5 minutes. In this manner, the reaction of the dehalogenation is caused by the cobalt complex and the organic halide compound. That is, not only the organic halide compound which has been a harmful compound is detoxified by the dehalogenation, but the obtained cobah (III) complex may become a preferable substrate to detoxify the harmful compound such as arsenic by the methylation. [0157]<br>
(4)	The synthesis of [MeCob(III)] from [MeCob(II)]<br><br><br>
to be extracted with methylene chloride.    After washed them with water, they<br>
are dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate so as to be solidified under reduced<br>
pressure.    They are re-precipitated with benzene/n-hexane to obtain a powder<br>
with an orange color, that is, methylcobalamin.<br>
[0160]<br>
In this manner, it is possible to detoxify the organic halide compound or the<br>
harmful compound such as arsenic by utilizing the oxidation state of the cobalt<br>
complex existing in the composition for the alkyiation of the present invention.<br>
In other words, it is also possible to detoxify the harmful compound by the<br>
methylation through the reaction of the cobalt (III) complex with the harmful<br>
compound (which contains arsenic etc.) with the use of the cobalt (III) complex<br>
obtained by the dehalogenation reaction of the organic halide compund with<br>
cobalt (I) complex.<br>
[0161]<br>
On the other hand, if the generated cobalt (II) complex is reduced through.any<br>
reaction, a cobalt (I) complex may be obtained, thereby the use of the cobalt<br>
complex  thus   obtained   making  it  possible   to  detoxify  the   organic  halide<br>
compound again.<br><br>
[0162]<br>
Example 15<br>
Next, under given conditions, with the use of GSH and methylcobalamin, the<br>
most efficient case capable of converting to TMAO was examined.<br>
[0163]<br>
At first, into a 0.2mL of Eppendorf tube GSH (60mg, 0.195mmol), lOmg of<br>
methylcobalamin (MC) (7.44 ^mol), Tris-HCI buffer solution (pH 8, 50 ^L) were<br>
added.    To this was added 2 (iL of arsenic standard solution (for an atomic<br>
absorption : lOOppm as arsenic), thereby set on an aluminium block heater heated<br>
at 125°C to react them for predetermined time.    The product of a reaction was<br>
diluted with 10% of hydrogen peroxide solution by 10-30 folds so that the<br>
product might be analyzed by the HPLC-ICP-MS.    The result of this is shown in<br>
tables 10 and 11.<br>
[Table 10]<br><br>
[Table 11]<br><br>
[0164]<br>
The tables 10 and 11 show a result of the HPLC-ICP-MS analysis in the case that<br>
the concentration of GSH, the concentration of arsenic and temperature etc., are<br><br>
changed.    The table 10 is expressed in the concentration, and the table 11 is<br>
expressed in the percentage.<br>
[0165]<br>
As a result, under the condition of the present Example, it is revealed that MC115<br>
of the table 10 and 11 is the best data which makes it possible to convert the<br>
harmful compound into approximately 100% of TMAO by using GSH.<br>
[0166]<br>
Example 16<br>
Next, the effect was examined with the use of cysteine (Cys) instead of GSH.<br>
At first, into a 0.2mL of Eppendorf tube, cysteine (20mg, 0.165mmol) as the<br>
reducing agent instead of GSH, methylcobalamin (MC) (20mg, 14.9 jimoL),<br>
phosphate buffer solution (pH 6, 100 |xL) were added.    To this was added 4 ^L<br>
of arsenic standard solution (for an atomic absorption :  lOOppm as arsenic),<br>
thereby set on an aluminium block heater heated at llO^'C to react them for<br>
predetermined time.    The product of a reaction was diluted with  10% of<br>
hydrogen peroxide solution by 10-30 folds so that the product might be analyzed<br>
by the HPLC-ICP-MS.    The result of this is shown in table 12.<br>
[Table 12]<br><br><br>
[0167]<br>
The table 12 shows a result of the HPLC-ICP-MS analysis in the case that the<br>
concentration of cysteine, the concentration of arsenic and temperature etc., are<br>
changed.    It is revealed that an excellent result is produced in the same as GSH<br>
even if cysteine instead of GSH is used.    Especially, if the ratio of TMAO is<br>
noted, MC157-3p of the table 12 has an excellent result.<br>
[0168]<br>
Example 17<br>
Next, the effect was also examined with the use of homocysteine instead of GSH.<br>
At first, into a 0.2mL of Eppendorf tube, homocysteine (HCys) (5mg, 16.3|imoL)<br>
as the reducing agent instead of GSH, methylcobalamin (MC) (20mg,   14.9<br>
|imoL), phosphate buffer solution (pH 6,  100 jxL) were added.    To this was<br>
added 4 |xL of an arsenic standard solution (for an atomic absorption : lOOppm as<br>
arsenic), thereby set on an aluminium block heater heated at 120°C to    react<br>
them for predetermined time.    The product of a reaction was diluted with 10%<br>
of hydrogen peroxide solution by  10-30 folds so that the product might be<br>
analyzed by the HPLC-ICP-MS.    The result of this is shown in table 13.<br>
[0169]<br>
[Table 13]<br><br><br>
[0170]<br>
The table 13 shows a result of the HPLC-ICP-MS analysis in the case that the<br>
concentration of homocysteine, the concentration of arsenic and temperature etc.,<br>
are changed.    It is revealed that an excellent result is obtained in the same as<br>
GSH even if homocysteine instead of GSH is used.    Especially, if the ratio of<br>
TMAO is noted, MC163-2p of the table 13 has an excellent resuh.<br>
[0171]<br>
Example 18<br>
Next, the effect was also examined with the use of thioglycol in addition to GSH.<br>
That is, the effect in the case of the addition of a high boiling point solvent was<br>
examined.	Specifically,     thioglycol	(TG,    HSCH2CH2OH,     boiling<br>
point :157°C ) with the SH group and dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO, ( CH3)2SO,<br>
boiling point : I89°C ) with no SH group were used.<br>
[0172]<br>
At first, into a 0.2mL of Eppendorf tube, GSH (4mg, 13 (imoL) as the reducing<br>
agent, methylcobalamin (MC) (Img, 0.74 ^moL), TG (5^L), Tris-HCI buffer<br>
solution (pH 8, 5  |xL) were added.    To this was added 2 ^L of an arsenic<br>
standard solution (lOppm as arsenic), thereby set on an aluminium block heater<br>
heated at 120°C to react them for predetermined time.    The product of a reaction<br>
was diluted with 10% of hydrogen peroxide solution by 10-30 times so that the<br>
product might be analyzed by the HPLC-ICP-MS (the explanation of MC179 etc.,<br>
of the tables Hand 15).<br>
[0173]<br>
Moreover, concerning MCI80 of tables 14 and 15, into a 0.2mL of Eppendorf<br>
tube, GSH (4mg, 13 |xmoL) as the reducing agent, methylcobalamin (MC) (Img,<br>
0.74 |imoL), DMSO (5^L), Tris-HCI buffer solution (pH 8, 5 ^L) were added.<br>
To this was added 2 ^iL of the arsenic standard solution (lOppm as arsenic),<br>
thereby set on an aluminium block heater heated at 120°C to react them for<br>
predetermined time.    The product of a reaction was diluted with  10% of<br>
hydrogen peroxide solution by 10-30 folds so that the product might be analyzed<br>
by the HPLC-ICP-MS.    The results of these are shown in tables 14 and 15.<br><br><br>
[0175]<br>
The tables 14 and 15 show a result of the HPLC-ICP-MS analysis in the case of<br>
the use of TG, DMSO in addition to GSH (in tables 14 and 15, GSH : glutathione<br>
(reduced form), MC : methylcobalamin, TG : thioglycol, DMSO : dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide.).    The table 14 is those expressed in the concentration, and the table<br>
15 is those expressed in the percentage.    It is revealed that an excellent result<br>
can be obtained in the same as the case of the use of GSH by itself, even if in the<br>
case that TG and DMSO are used.<br>
[0176]<br>
Example 19<br>
Next, the effect was further examined with the use of Cysteine (Cys) as the<br>
reducing agent in the same manner as the above example.    The table 16 shows a<br>
methylation reaction (Acid condition) (Reacting substance) of arsenic trioxide<br>
[iAs(III)]byMC.<br>
[Table 16]<br><br><br>
[0177]<br>
The table 17 shows a methylation reaction (Acid condition) (Reaction condition and product of a reaction) of arsenic trioxide [iAs (III)] by MC. In the table, GSH: reduced glutathione, MC: methylcobalamin. As: starting material (It is trivalent arsenic: iAs (III).), MMA: monomethylated arsenic acid, DMA : dimethylarsineoxide, TMAO : trimethylarsineoxide and TeMA: tetramethyl arsenic, respectively, a value was calculated as a conversion ratio = 100% ([iAs (V)] + [MMA] + [DMA] + [TMAO] + [TeMA]) / [iAs (III)]). [Table 17]<br><br>

The  table   18   shows   a  methylation  reaction  (Neutral  condition)   (Reacting<br>
substance) of arsenic trioxide [iAs (III)] by MC.<br>
[Table 18]<br><br><br>
[0179]<br>
The  table   19   shows   a  methylation   reaction   (Neutral   condition)   (Reaction condition and product of a reaction) of arsenic trioxide [iAs (III)] by MC. [Table 19]<br><br>
[0180]<br>
The   table   20   shows   a   methylation   reaction   (Alkali   condition)   (Reacting<br>
substance) of arsenic trioxide [iAs (III)] by MC.<br>
[Table 20]<br><br><br>
[0181]<br>
The table 21 shows a methylation reaction (Alkali condition) (Reaction condition<br>
and product of a reaction) of arsenic trioxide [iAs (III)] by MC.<br>
[Table 21]<br><br>
[0182] Example 20<br>
Next, a detoxification of antimony was examined in the same manner as the above mentioned example. Figure 32 gives a HPLC-ICP-MS chromatogram (Measurement element : Sb, m/z 121). In the figure, A: standard sample [iSb (III)], B: sample after the reaction (MC + GSH), C: sample after the reaction (Only MC). The table 22 shows a methylation reaction (Reacting substance and reaction condition) of an inorganic antimony. [Table 22]<br><br><br>
[0183]<br>
The table 23 shows a methylation reaction (Product of a reaction) of an inorganic<br>
antimony.<br>
[Table 23]<br><br>
[0184]<br>
As it is clear from Figure 32, it was revealed that the Ul, U2, U3 and U4<br>
attributing to the methylated antimony were generated by reacting the trivalent<br>
inorganic antimony with methylcobalamin.    Therefore, it is recognized that it is<br>
also possible to obtain more harmless methylated antimony concerning antimony.<br>
[0185]<br>
Example 21<br>
Next, the effects were examined which a mole fraction of each component of the<br>
composition for alkylation gives.    Specifically, experiment was carried out in<br>
the same manner as the above mentioned example with the use of GSH as the<br>
reducing agent, arsenic as the harmful compound and methylcobalamin as the<br>
cobalt complex.    The resuh of this is shown in the tables 24 and 25.    The table<br>
24 shows a methylation reaction (Reacting substance) of arsenic trioxide [iAs<br><br><br>
[Table 25]<br>
(Ill)] by MC. The table 25 shows a methylation reaction (Reaction condition and product of a reaction) of arsenic trioxide [iAs (III)] by MC. In table, [GSH]: Molarity of the reducing agent (GSH), [MC]: Molarity of methylcobalamin, [As]: Molarity of arsenic trioxide which is a starting material, respectively. Furthermore, in the table, GSH: reduced glutathione, MC: methylcobalamin, As: starting material (It is trivalent arsenic here: iAs (III).), MMA: monomethylated arsenic acid, DMA : dimethylarsineoxide, TMAO : trimethylarsineoxide and TeMA: tetramethyl arsenic, respectively, a value was calculated as a conversion ratio = 100% ([iAs (V)] + [MMA] + [DMA] + [TMAO] + [TeMA]) / [iAs (III)]). Further, Figure 33 gives a reaction condition in the production of trimechyl arsenic (TMA) from arsenic trioxide according to methylcobalamin. [Table 24]<br><br>
As it is clear from the tables 24 and 25, in relative ratio, 90% or more of the harmless trimethylarsineoxide can be obtained in the case that 10000 folds or more of the reducing agent, GSH compared with arsenic is added and 1000 folds<br><br>
or more of methylcobalamin compared with arsenic is added.    That is, it was<br>
revealed that in relative ratio, 90% or more of the harmless trimethylarsineoxide<br>
can be obtained in the case that it is [GSH] / [As] &gt; 1000, [MC] / [As] &gt; 100,<br>
more preferably, [GSH] / [As] &gt; 10000, [MC] / [As] &gt; 1000.<br>
