				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
BASE STATION APPARATUS AND RADIO COMMUNICATION METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a base station<br>
apparatus that performs bi-directional radio<br>
communications with terminal stations using a TDD (Time<br>
Division Duplex) system in which time slots with the same<br>
radio frequency are used to communicate alternately over<br>
the uplink and downlink, and more particularly, to a base<br>
station apparatus that performs communications using an<br>
OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)<br>
system.<br>
Background Art<br>
As a duplex system in a mobile communication system<br>
using CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) , a TDD system<br>
is conventionally known. The TDD system uses the same<br>
frequency band for transmission and reception, called<br>
a ping-pong system, and is a system where time slots with<br>
the same radio frequency are used to communicate<br>
alternately over the uplink and downlink.<br>
FIG.1 illustrates an example of a configuration of<br>
a communication frame in the TDD system. The<br>
communication frame illustrated in FIG.l is divided into<br>
a plurality of times slots . In this communication frame,<br>
downlink time slots (downlink slots 1 to n) are configured<br>
in the first half of the frame, while uplink time slots<br>
(uplink slots 1 to n) are configured in the latter half<br>
of the frame. FIG.1 illustrates an example where the<br>
uplink slots 1 to n are assigned corresponding uplink<br>
bursts 1 to n, while the downlink slots 1 to n are assigned<br>
corresponding downlink bursts 1 to n.<br>
When a base station performs radio communications<br>
with terminal station apparatuses using thus configured<br>
communication frames, each terminal station apparatus<br>
is assigned an uplink slot and downlink slot contained<br>
in the communication frame. Based on a timing signal<br>
shown in FIG.l, the base station apparatus switches<br>
between transmission processing and reception processing.<br>
A terminal station apparatus performs transmission<br>
processing and reception processing at timings of an<br>
uplink slot and downlink slot assigned to the terminal<br>
station apparatus, respectively.<br>
Structures of an uplink burst and downlink burst<br>
will be described below with reference to FIGs.2 and 3.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a structure of a downlink<br>
burst, and FIG.3 is a diagram illustrating a structure<br>
of an uplink burst. At a beginning of the downlink burst<br>
is disposed a propagation path estimation preamble that<br>
is a known signal and used in propagation path estimation.<br>
The propagation path estimation preamble is followed by-<br>
data (downlink data #1 and #2) to a terminal station.<br>
Downlink bursts are transmitted at respective<br>
predetermined timings from a base station apparatus, and<br>
therefore, never collide with one another . Accordingly,<br>
the downlink burst is not provided with a guard time.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown in FIG.3, the uplink burst is<br>
provided at its beginning with a guard time to prevent<br>
the collision with an adjacent burst, and the guard time<br>
is followed by a sync/AGC preamble used in detection of<br>
synchronization and AGC (Automatic Gain Control). The<br>
sync/AGC preamble is followed by a propagation path<br>
estimation preamble that is a known signal and used in<br>
propagation path estimation. The propagation path<br>
estimation preamble is followed by data (uplink data #3<br>
and #4) to the base station.<br>
In the communication frame illustrated in FIG.1,<br>
configuring downlink bursts collectively shifts a<br>
reception timing of an uplink burst from a predetermined<br>
reception timing, and thereby prevents the collision with<br>
the downlink burst. In this way, since the need is<br>
eliminated of providing a downlink burst with a guard<br>
time, the rate of the guard time to the communication<br>
frame is decreased to improve the transmission<br>
efficiency.<br>
In the mobile communication field, since the quality<br>
of received signals significantly deteriorates due to<br>
fading, the diversity processing is used to reduce the<br>
deterioration in the quality of received signals due to<br>
fading. The diversity processing is a technique of<br>
preventing drops in power of received signalsona receiver<br>
side, but in order for a communication terminal apparatus<br>
such as a mobile station to implement the diversity, there<br>
are limitations in processing capability,<br>
miniaturization, etc. Therefore, transmission<br>
diversity has been studied in order for a transmitter<br>
side to implement the diversity which is originally to<br>
be implemented on a receiver side.<br>
The transmission diversity will be described which<br>
is performed between a base station and terminal station<br>
when the base station communicates with the terminal<br>
station using communication frames shown in FIG.1. It<br>
is assumed that each of the base station and terminal<br>
station has an IFFT circuit, and performs OFDM<br>
communications over both the uplink and downlink.<br>
The base station receives uplink bursts using a<br>
plurality of antenna elements, and detects received<br>
levels for each antenna element. The detection of<br>
received levels is performed for each subcarrier of a<br>
received signal. Based on a result of detection of<br>
received levels, the base station assigns a subcarrier<br>
composing a downlink burst to an antenna element with<br>
the highest received level with respect to the subcarrier.<br>
Such transmission diversity has a premise that in<br>
the TDD system, propagation path characteristics are<br>
approximately the same over the downlink and the uplink.<br>
Based on this premise, in the transmission diversity,<br>
a downlink signal is transmitted from a branch with the<br>
highest uplink received power, whereby it is aimed to<br>
maximize the downlink received power in a terminal<br>
station.<br>
However, in the frame configuration where downlink<br>
slots and uplink slots are respectively collected and<br>
arranged, since an uplink slot is spaced apart from a<br>
downlink slot (inother words, alarge time interval exists<br>
between reception of an uplink slot and transmission of<br>
a downlink slot), the channel condition at the time of<br>
receiving the uplink slot is greatly different from the<br>
channel condition at the time of receiving the downlink<br>
slot. Accordingly, the premise that propagation path<br>
characteristics are approximately the same over the<br>
downlink and the uplink crumbles, and there arises a<br>
problem that the capability of diversity of improving<br>
the received quality deteriorates.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a base station apparatus and radio communication method<br>
enabling enhanced effects of improving received quality<br>
due to transmission diversity without degrading the<br>
transmission efficiency.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The inventor of the present invention found out that<br>
with attention focused on a slot configuration of a<br>
communication frame (see FIG.1) in a TDD system in which<br>
downlink slots and uplink slots are configured<br>
collectively, configuring an uplink slot and downlink<br>
slot adjacent to one another (i.e., decreasing an<br>
open-loop period) improves effects of improving<br>
communication quality due to transmission diversity on<br>
bursts assigned to the slots configured adjacent to one<br>
another. Further, the inventor of the present invention<br>
found out that by setting a ratio of a second region to<br>
the entire frame properly, an uplink burst and downlink<br>
burst are configured adjacent to one another, and it is<br>
thereby possible to suppress the deterioration of<br>
transmission efficiency caused by a guard time needed<br>
to be added to a downlink burst to a range of not affecting<br>
the transmission efficiency required in a system.<br>
In other words , it is a gist of the present invention<br>
to provide a communication frame with a second region<br>
with a short open-loop period, and perform diversity<br>
combining on transmission signals assigned to slots of<br>
the second region to transmit.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
specifically described below with reference to<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
(First embodiment)<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating a<br>
configuration of base station 10 according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment<br>
it is assumed that base station 10 performs radio<br>
communications with terminal stations #1 to #n not shown.<br>
It is further assumed that base station 10 performs<br>
bi-directional communications with terminal stations #1<br>
to #n using the TDD system. A case is explained as an<br>
example where eachofbasestation 10 and terminal stations<br>
#1 to #n is provided with an OFDM modulator and OFDM<br>
demodulator (either is not shown), and OFDM<br>
communications are performed over the uplink and<br>
downlink.<br>
In FIG.4 receiving section 19 performs<br>
predetermined reception processing such as<br>
downconverting and A/D conversion on a received signal<br>
received from corresponding antenna element 17.<br>
Receiving section 20 performs predetermined reception<br>
processing such as downconverting and A/D conversion on<br>
a received signal received from corresponding antenna<br>
element 18. In addition, the received signals received<br>
from antenna elements 17 and 18 are OFDM signals<br>
transmitted from either of terminal stations #1 to #n.<br>
Based on output signals from receiving sections 19<br>
and 20, level detecting section 21 detects a received<br>
level of each subcarrier composing the received OFDM<br>
signal for each antenna . In other words, level detecting<br>
section 21 detects received levels of subcarriers<br>
composing the OFDM signal received from antenna 17 based<br>
on the output signal from receiving section 19, while<br>
detecting received levels of subcarriers composing the<br>
OFDM signal received from antenna 18 based on the output<br>
signal from receiving section 20.<br>
Reception diversity section 22 refers to received<br>
levels detected in level detecting section 21, and<br>
performs diversity combining on received signals output<br>
from receiving sections 19 and 20. Specifically,<br>
reception diversity section 22 refers to a result detected<br>
in level detecting section 21, and performs selective<br>
combining of selecting a subcarrier with a higher level<br>
as a received signal.<br>
In addition, diversity combining in reception<br>
diversity section 22 is not limited to the selective<br>
combining. For example, reception diversity section 22<br>
may shift phases of signals output from receiving sections<br>
19 and 20 to be in phase for each subcarrier, perform<br>
weighting on the in-phase received signals based on<br>
respective received levels, and perform maximal-ratio<br>
combining on the weighted signals. Further, reception<br>
diversity section 22 may shift phases of signals output<br>
from receiving sections 19 and 20 to be in phase for each<br>
subcarrier, and perform equal-gain combining on the<br>
in-phase received signals.<br>
The received signals subjected to the diversity<br>
combining in reception diversity section 22 are output<br>
to reception buffer section 2 3 . Reception buffer section<br>
23 performs processing such as FFT (Fast Fourier<br>
Transform) on the output signal of reception diversity<br>
section 22 to obtain received data. Reception buffer<br>
section 23 further performs error detection on the<br>
received data, and outputs received data with no error<br>
detected therein as final received data to following<br>
circuitry.<br>
Base station 10 has sections for reception as<br>
configured described above. A configuration of sections<br>
for transmission will be described below.<br>
Transmission buffer section 11 performs IFFT<br>
(Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) on transmission data<br>
to generate an OFDM signal, and holds the signal until<br>
the time of receiving control to output from band assigning<br>
section 13.<br>
Timing generating section 12 generates a rectangle<br>
timing signal with rising edges and falling edges, and<br>
outputs the generated timing signal to band assigning<br>
section 13. The timing signal is generated based on a<br>
slot configuration of a communication frame predetermined<br>
under the system.<br>
Band assigning section 13 refers to the timing signal<br>
output from timing generating section 12 (particularly,<br>
by detecting the rising edge and falling edge), and<br>
recognizes the slot configuration in the communication<br>
slot. Then, based on the result of detection of received<br>
levels in level detecting section 21, band assigning<br>
section 13 assigns an uplink slot and downlink slot<br>
configured at predetermined positions in the<br>
communication frame to each of terminal stations #1 to<br>
#n. Band assigning section 13 controls transmission<br>
buffer section 11 according to the slot assignment, and<br>
instructs the section 11 to output the OFDM signal held<br>
in the section 11 to transmission diversity section 14<br>
as a downlink burst.<br>
Based on the result of detection of received levels<br>
in level detecting section 21, transmission diversity<br>
section 14 performs transmission diversity processing<br>
on the downlink burst output from transmission buffer<br>
section 11. In other words, transmission diversity<br>
section 14 selects an antenna element with a higher<br>
received level for each subcarrier, and outputs a signal<br>
assigned to the subcarrier to a transmitting section<br>
(transmitting section 15 or 16) corresponding to the<br>
selected antenna. For example, with respect to<br>
subcarrier S1 with predetermined frequency f1 of OFDM<br>
signals output from antenna elements 17 and 18, when the<br>
received level of the received signal from antenna element<br>
17 is higher that from antenna element 18, transmission<br>
diversity section 14 outputs subcarrier S1 with f 1 among<br>
OFDM signals output from transmission buffer section 11<br>
to transmitting section 15 corresponding to antenna<br>
element 17 to transmit from antenna element 17.<br>
Thus, in the OFDM signals, since propagation path<br>
characteristics are different for each subcarrier, base<br>
station 10 according to this embodiment performs the<br>
transmission diversity for each subcarrier.<br>
Transmitting sections 15 and 16 perform<br>
predetermined radio transmission processing such as<br>
upconverting and D/A conversion on output signals from<br>
transmission diversity section 14. The signals thus<br>
having undergone radio transmission processing are<br>
transmitted from antenna element 17 or 18.<br>
While base station 10 according to this embodiment<br>
is provided with two antenna elements, i.e., antenna<br>
elements 17 and 18, to perform diversity processing, the<br>
present invention allows base station 10 to have a<br>
plurality of antenna elements to perform diversity.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram to explain an example of a slot<br>
configuration of a communication frame used in the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in<br>
FIG.5, in this embodiment, a general communication frame<br>
in which downlink slots and uplink slots are collectively<br>
configured is provided with an interval at which uplink<br>
slots and downlink slots are configured so that uplink<br>
and downlink slots are adjacent to each other.<br>
Hereinafter, in the specification, the interval in a<br>
communication frame at which uplink and downlink slots<br>
are configured adjacent to each other is referred to as<br>
a "second region" . Further, in the communication frame,<br>
the other region except the second region is referred<br>
to as a "first region". In an example shown in FIG.5,<br>
the second region is composed of uplink slots #1 to #k<br>
and downlink slots #1 to #k, while the first region is<br>
composed of uplink slots #k+1 to #n and downlink slots<br>
#k+1 to #n.<br>
FIG.5 shows, as an example of configuring uplink<br>
and downlink slots adjacent to each other, a case where<br>
an uplink slot is configured immediately after a downlink<br>
slot. In other words, in the second region of the<br>
communication slot shown in FIG.5, an uplink slot for<br>
a terminal station and a downlink slot for the terminal<br>
station are configured as a pair of unit.<br>
The operation of base station 10 with the above<br>
configuration will be described below.<br>
The operation of sections for reception in base<br>
station 10 will be described first.<br>
OFDM signals transmitted from terminal stations #1<br>
to #n are received in antenna elements 17 and 18. The<br>
OFDM signals received in antenna elements 17 and 18 are<br>
subjected to predetermined radio reception processing<br>
respectively in receiving sections 19 and 20, and output<br>
to level detecting section 21 and reception diversity<br>
section 22.<br>
Level detecting section 21 detects received levels<br>
for each subcarrier composing a received OFDM signal.<br>
Results of the detection of received levels for each<br>
subcarrier are output to reception diversity section 22,<br>
transmission diversity section 14 and band assigning<br>
section 13. Reception diversity section 22 refers to<br>
input received levels, and performs diversity combining<br>
for each subcarrier. Reception buffer section 23<br>
performs FFT on the resultant of diversity combining to<br>
obtain received data.<br>
Next, the operation of sections for transmission<br>
in base station 10 will be described next.<br>
Timing generating section 12 generates a rectangle<br>
timing signal composed of rising edges and falling edges,<br>
according to the slot configuration as shown in FIG.5.<br>
The timing signal is generated, for example, as shown<br>
in FIG.5, so that each rising edge indicates a switching<br>
timing from an uplink slot to a downlink slot, while each<br>
falling edge indicates a switching timing from a downlink<br>
slot to an uplink slot.<br>
Band assigning section 13 assigns downlink bursts<br>
(downlink burst 1 to n) respectively for terminal stations<br>
#1 to into slots in the communication frame, corresponding<br>
to the result of the detection of received levels in level<br>
detecting section 21. The configuration of slots is set<br>
in advance under the system, and for example, the slots<br>
are configured as shown in FIG.5.<br>
The slot assignment for downlink burst is performed<br>
in consideration of effects on communication quality<br>
caused by difference in configuration method between<br>
slots configured in the second region and slots configured<br>
in the other region except the second region, and<br>
particularly, in consideration of effects on<br>
communication quality of the downlink channel in<br>
controlling the downlink channel based on channel<br>
conditions (for example, received levels) on the uplink<br>
channel, (i.e., performing open-loop control). In the<br>
open-loop control, predetermined processing is performed<br>
on a downlink transmission signal based on an estimation<br>
result of the uplink channel condition. For example,<br>
in transmission diversity processing that is an example<br>
of open-loop control, as described above, downlink bursts<br>
are subjected to diversity combining based on received<br>
levels of uplink slots.<br>
In other words, in the second region, since a<br>
downlink slot is configured immediately after an uplink<br>
slot, a time (in the specification, also referred to as<br>
an "open-loop period") elapsed between reception of an<br>
uplink slot and transmission of a downlink slot<br>
corresponding to the received uplink slot (in other words ,<br>
a downlink slot on the same channel as of the received<br>
uplink slot) is shorter than an open-loop period in the<br>
first region. Accordingly, in performing open-loop<br>
control, assigning a slot in the second region allows<br>
higher accuracy in performing predetermined processing<br>
(for example, diversity combining) on a downlink<br>
transmission signal than assigning a slot in the first<br>
region.<br>
Thus, by performing open-loop control using a slot<br>
configured in the second region, it is possible to use<br>
channel estimation results with higher accuracy than<br>
performing communications using a slot assigned to the<br>
first region. It is thus possible to control signals<br>
to transmit over the downlink appropriately. For example,<br>
when the transmission diversity is performed, the<br>
diversity effect can be improved.<br>
Accordingly, band assigning section 13 refers to<br>
received levels detected in level detecting section 21,<br>
and assigns the second region preferentially to a terminal<br>
station of low received level (i.e., poor channel<br>
condition), whereby it is possible to improve the<br>
communication quality of the terminal station in poor<br>
channel condition.<br>
Meanwhile, in order to assign slots to the second<br>
region, since uplink and downlink slots are adjacent to<br>
each other, the need arises of providing a downlink slot<br>
with a guard time. Accordingly, an increased ratio of<br>
the second region to the communication frame may cause<br>
the transmission efficiency to deteriorate. Therefore,<br>
the number of slots (the number of channels) configured<br>
in the second region is determined corresponding to the<br>
transmission efficiency. For example, when it is assumed<br>
that a frame length is 2 ms, a guard time is 4µs, and<br>
slots corresponding to five channels (in other words,<br>
five slots for each of uplink and downlink channels , i.e.,<br>
total 10 slots) are configured in the second region, an<br>
increase in guard time is 5x µ 4s=20 µ s, which is<br>
one-thousandth of the frame length, 2 ms. Thus, it is<br>
possible to suppress the deterioration in transmission<br>
efficiency in the entire frame caused by providing the<br>
second region to an extremely small extent.<br>
Band assigning section 13 controls transmission<br>
buffer section 11 according to the slot assignment for<br>
each terminal as described above. For example, when a<br>
communication frame is configured as shown in FIG.5, the<br>
section 13 detects afirstrisingedgeofthetimingsignal,<br>
and performs control for outputting downlink burst #1<br>
at a timing of detecting the rising edge. In this way,<br>
a second slot from the beginning (left end viewed in the<br>
figure) of a frame is assigned the downlink burst.<br>
Subsequently, downlink bursts #2 to #n are output from<br>
transmission buffer section 11 at predetermined timings<br>
in the same way as in the control of downlink burst #1.<br>
The downlink bursts output from transmission buffer<br>
section 11 are subjected to transmission diversity<br>
processing in transmission diversity section 14, then<br>
to predetermined radio transmission processing in<br>
transmitting section 15 or 16, and transmitted from<br>
corresponding antenna element 17 or 18.<br>
FIG.6 illustrates simulation results of the<br>
relationship between Eb/No(dB) measured in base station<br>
10 as described above and an error rate in a terminal<br>
station. Simulation conditions are as described below.<br>
PDU size: 54 BYTES;<br>
FFT sample rate: 20MHz;<br>
Guard interval length: 800ns<br>
Frame length: 2ms;<br>
Modulation scheme: 16AM;<br>
Error correction: Convolutional coding/Viterbi<br>
decoding (where the constraint length is 7 and coding<br>
rate is 9/16);<br>
Delay deviation: 150ns; and<br>
Maximum Doppler frequency: 50Hz.<br>
In FIG.6, black squares indicate simulation results<br>
of the case of using the present invention (inother words,<br>
a communication frame is provided with the second region) ,<br>
black circles indicate simulation results of the case<br>
of using a conventional base station (the case of<br>
performing transmission diversity) , and black triangles<br>
indicate simulation results of the case of using a<br>
conventional base station (the case of not performing<br>
transmission diversity).<br>
Thus, the simulation results of the present<br>
invention show great improvements in Eb/No needed to<br>
obtain a predetermined error rate, as compared to the<br>
simulation results of the case of performing conventional<br>
transmission diversity. For example, when the error rate<br>
in a terminal station is 10-2, Eb/No is improved by about<br>
1.5dB.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment,<br>
a communication frame is provided with a second region<br>
having a short open-loop period and transmission signals<br>
assigned to slots in the second region are subjected to<br>
diversity combining, whereby it is possible to improve<br>
the diversity effect with the transmission efficiency<br>
hardly degraded.<br>
(Second embodiment)<br>
This embodiment is a modification of the first<br>
embodiment, and provides a different communication frame<br>
configuration from that in the first embodiment. FIG.7<br>
is a diagram to explain an example of a slot configuration<br>
of a communication frame used in the second embodiment<br>
of the present invention. As shown in FIG.7, in the<br>
communication frame used in this embodiment, downlink<br>
slots except slots assigned to the second region are<br>
configured collectively at a beginning portion of the<br>
frame, while uplink slots except slots assigned to the<br>
second region are configured collectively at an end<br>
portion of the frame. The second region is sandwiched<br>
between thus collectively configured downlink slots and<br>
uplink slots.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, downlink slots except<br>
slots assigned to the second region are configured<br>
collectively at a beginning portion of a frame, while<br>
uplink slots except slots assigned to the second region<br>
are configured collectively at an end portion of the frame.<br>
In this way, an interval between the uplink slot and a<br>
downlink slot in the next frame is shorter than in the<br>
frame configuration shown in FIG.5. Accordingly, when<br>
the channel condition is estimated using an uplink slot<br>
of a last frame and based on the estimation result,<br>
transmission diversity is performed, it is possible to<br>
further enhance the effect of improving the received<br>
quality due to diversity, as compared to the case<br>
illustrated in the first embodiment.<br>
(Third embodiment)<br>
This embodiment is a modification of the first<br>
embodiment, and provides a different slot configuration<br>
in the second region from that in the first embodiment.<br>
FIG.8 is a diagram to explain an example of the slot<br>
configuration of a communication frame used in the third<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG.8,<br>
in the second region of the communication frame used in<br>
this embodiment, among slots configured in the second<br>
region, uplink slots are collectively configured at the<br>
first half of the second region, while downlink slots<br>
are collectively configured at the latter half of the<br>
second region.<br>
The number of slots configured in the second region<br>
is predetermined in advance under the system so that a<br>
time interval between an uplink slot in the second region<br>
and a downlink slot corresponding to the uplink slot is<br>
shorter than a time interval between an uplink slot out<br>
of the second region and a downlink slot corresponding<br>
to the uplink slot. It is preferable to set the number<br>
of slots configured in the second region so as to<br>
sufficiently obtain the effect of improving the<br>
communication quality in a terminal station due to the<br>
transmission diversity. For example, when a burst length<br>
is 24µS, assuming five uplink slots and five downlink<br>
slots are configured in the second region results in the<br>
time interval of 12 µs between anuplinkslot in the second<br>
region and a downlink slot corresponding to the uplink<br>
slot. 120µs is 1/20 of the frame length (2ms), and is<br>
adequately short to obtain the effect of improving the<br>
received quality due to the transmission diversity.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, since uplink slots and<br>
downlink slots are configured separately and collectively<br>
in the second region, it is possible to decrease the number<br>
of switching processing times between the transmission<br>
and reception processing in a predetermined time as<br>
compared to the first embodiment. Further, it is<br>
possible to perform the switching processing at a lower<br>
rate than in the first embodiment. It is thereby possible<br>
to reduce the power consumption required for the switching<br>
processing between the transmission and reception<br>
processing and to miniaturize an apparatus.<br>
Inthefirstand second embodiments , all the downlink<br>
bursts contained in the second region need to be provided<br>
with a guard time. In this embodiment, providing only<br>
a downlink burst at the beginning of the second region<br>
with a guard time is capable of preventing the collision<br>
of bursts. Therefore, by using the communication frame<br>
in this embodiment, it is possible to further prevent<br>
decreases in the transmission efficiency as compared to<br>
cases illustrated in the first and second embodiments.<br>
(Fourth embodiment)<br>
This embodiment is a modification of the third<br>
embodiment, provides a guard interval between an interval<br>
at which uplink slots are collectively configured in the<br>
second region and an interval at which downlink slots<br>
are collectively configured in the second region, and<br>
in this respect, is different from the third embodiment.<br>
FIG. 9 is a diagram to explain an example of a slot<br>
configuration of a communication frame used in the fourth<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in<br>
FIG.9, in the second region of the communication frame<br>
used in this embodiment, as in the third embodiment, among<br>
slots configured in the second region, uplink slots are<br>
collectively configured at the first half of the second<br>
region, while downlink slots are collectively configured<br>
at the latter half of the second region. A guard interval<br>
to which any burst for transmitting information is not<br>
assigned is provided between the first half of the second<br>
region in which uplink slots are collectively configured<br>
and the latter half of the second region in which downlink<br>
slots are collectively configured.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, by providing a guard<br>
interval between the first half of the second region in<br>
which uplink slots are collectively configured and the<br>
latter half of the second region in which downlink slots<br>
are collectively configured, it is possible to perform<br>
the switching processing between the transmission and<br>
reception processing at a lower rate than in the third<br>
embodiment. It is thereby possible to further reduce<br>
the power consumption required for the switching<br>
processing between the transmission and reception<br>
processing and to miniaturize an apparatus.<br>
(Fifth embodiment)<br>
This embodiment is a modification of the first<br>
embodiment, and it is a feature of this embodiment to<br>
preferentially assign a signal with a high priority such<br>
as a control signal and repeat signal to the second region.<br>
FIG.10 is a block diagram illustrating a configuration<br>
of base station 70 according to the fifth embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In addition, in FIG.10, the same<br>
structural elements as in FIG.4 are assigned the same<br>
reference numerals to omit detailed descriptions thereof .<br>
Further, a communication frame used in this embodiment<br>
is the same as that illustrated in FIG.5.<br>
The signal with a high priority is such a signal<br>
that requires a high error rate, and for example, includes<br>
a control signal and repeat signal. The signal(s) with<br>
a high priority is defined under the system in advance,<br>
and band assigning section 13 obtains information on the<br>
signal with a high priority as channel information.<br>
InFIG.10, selectingsection 71 refers to the channel<br>
information held in band assigning section 13, selects<br>
the signal with a high priority from transmission signals ,<br>
and outputs the selected signal to transmission buffer<br>
section 72. Selecting section 71 further outputs signals<br>
except the signal with a high priority to transmission<br>
buffer section 73.<br>
Selecting section 74 refers to the channel<br>
information, reads the signal with a high priority from<br>
transmission buffer section 72, and assigns the signal<br>
to a slot configured in the second slot of the<br>
communication frame illustrated in FIG.5.<br>
Band assigning section 13 assigns signals except<br>
the signal with a high priority to slots configured at<br>
the region except the second region. Band assigning<br>
section 13 controls transmission buffer section 73<br>
according to the slot assignment, so that the transmission<br>
buffer section 73 outputs signals stored therein to<br>
transmission diversity section 14 through selecting<br>
section 74.<br>
In this way, according to this embodiment, a signal<br>
with a high priority (i.e. , signal requiring a high error<br>
rate) is preferentially assigned to a slot configured<br>
in the second region. Since the signal assigned to a<br>
slot configured in the second region takes an advantage<br>
of higher effect of improving the communication quality<br>
due to the diversity, and it is possible to improve the<br>
error rate of the signal with a high priority.<br>
(Sixth embodiment)<br>
This embodiment is a modification of the fourth<br>
embodiment, and provides a different communication frame<br>
configuration from that in the forth embodiment. FIG. 11<br>
is a diagram to explain an example of a slot configuration<br>
of a communication frame used in the sixth embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
AsillustratedinFIG.1l, in the communication frame<br>
used in this embodiment, a slot next to the second region<br>
(i.e., a first one of the downlink slots collectively<br>
configured at the region except the second region) is<br>
defined as downlink slot X, while a last slot of the<br>
communication frame (i.e. , a last one of the uplink slots<br>
collectively configured at the region except the second<br>
region) is defined as uplink slot X. The uplink slot<br>
X configured in such a position is assigned burst X, and<br>
the downlink slot X configured in such a position is<br>
assigned burst X. In addition, the uplink slot X<br>
corresponds to a target uplink slot as described in the<br>
claims, while the downlink slot X corresponds to a target<br>
downlink slot as described in the claims.<br>
Bursts assigned to the downlink and uplink slots<br>
X are selected based on channel quality information such<br>
as RSSI and CRC detection result in band assigning section<br>
13. For example, based on the channel quality<br>
information, band assigning section 13 selects a burst<br>
in the poorest channel condition from among bursts that<br>
cannot be assigned to the second region.<br>
According to the slot configuration as described<br>
above, an interval between the uplink slot X and the<br>
downlink slot X of the next frame is shorter than an<br>
interval between an uplink slot assigned to the region<br>
except the second region and a downlink slot in the next<br>
frame corresponding to the uplink slot (for example, an<br>
interval between uplink slot k+1 and downlink slot k+1<br>
in the next frame). Accordingly, the channel condition<br>
is estimated using uplink slot X of a last frame and based<br>
on the estimation result, the transmission diversity is<br>
performed, whereby using a slot (herein, slot X)<br>
configured in the first region also enhances the effect<br>
of improving the communication quality due to the<br>
diversity.<br>
(Seventh embodiment)<br>
This embodiment is a modification of the first<br>
embodiment, and it is a feature of this embodiment that<br>
base station 90 performs transmission gain control in<br>
addition to the transmission diversity. FIG.12 is a<br>
block diagram illustrating a configuration of base<br>
station 90 according to the seventh embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In addition, in FIG.12, the same<br>
structural elements as in FIG.4 are assigned the same<br>
reference numerals to omit detailed descriptions thereof.<br>
Further, a communication frame used in this embodiment<br>
is the same as that illustrated in FIG.5.<br>
In FIG.12, gain control section 91 calculates<br>
transmission power based on the result in detection of<br>
received levels of uplink slots in level detecting section<br>
21, and amplifies a downlink burst output from<br>
transmission buffer section 11 to the calculated<br>
transmission power. Specifically, gain control section<br>
91 compares a received level (hereinafter referred to<br>
as a "detection level") detected in level detecting<br>
section 21 with a received level (hereinafter referred<br>
to as a "target level") indicative of a predetermined<br>
target level. When the detection level is higher than<br>
the target level, the section 91 decreases the<br>
transmission power. On the other hand, when the<br>
detection level is lower than the target level, the section<br>
91 increases the transmission power.<br>
Gain control section 91 performs transmission power<br>
control for each subcarrier. In other words, the target<br>
level is determined for each subcarrier, and by comparing<br>
the target level with the detection level detected for<br>
each subcarrier, the transmission power control is<br>
performed for each subcarrier.<br>
The transmission power control for each subcarrier<br>
will be described with reference to FIGs.13 and 14.<br>
FIG.13 is a diagram illustrating transmission power of<br>
a downlink burst for each subcarrier, and FIG.14 is a<br>
diagram illustrating received power of the downlink burst<br>
illustrated in FIG.13 in a terminal station.<br>
The downlink burst illustrated in FIG.13 has been<br>
amplified ingaincontrol section 91 illustrated in FIG.12.<br>
As illustrated in FIG.13, subcarriers in good channel<br>
conditions (for example, third and eighth subcarriers<br>
from the left viewed in the figure) are transmitted with<br>
low transmission power, while subcarriers in poor channel<br>
conditions ( for example, first and fifth subcarriers from<br>
the left viewed in the figure) are transmitted with high<br>
transmission power.<br>
The downlink burst transmitted in this way is<br>
received in a terminal station as illustrated in FIG.14.<br>
As illustrated in FIG.14, each subcarrier is attenuated<br>
on the transmission path, and is received with<br>
approximately the same power as one another.<br>
By thus performing the transmission power control<br>
for each subcarrier, it is possible to hold the received<br>
power of subcarriers at approximately the same level.<br>
A subcarrier with a falling received level is considered<br>
as a dominant factor that degrades the error rate of an<br>
OFDM signal. Therefore, holding the received power of<br>
subcarriers at approximately the same level prevents the<br>
received level from falling down. It is thereby possible<br>
to improve the error rate performance.<br>
(Eighth embodiment)<br>
This embodiment is a modification of the first<br>
embodiment, and it is a feature of this embodiment that<br>
base station 120 performs communications according to<br>
an OFDM-CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) system.<br>
FIG.15 is a block diagram illustrating a configuration<br>
of base station 120 according to the eighth embodiment<br>
of the present invention. In addition, in FIG.15, the<br>
same structural elements as in FIG.4 are assigned the<br>
same reference numerals to omit detailed descriptions<br>
thereof. Further, a communication frame used in this<br>
embodiment is the same as that illustrated in FIG.5. The<br>
OFDM-CDMA system is to perform CDMA communications in<br>
multicarrier, and has a feature of multiplexing chips<br>
assigned subcarriers, and thereby performing the<br>
frequency division multiplexing.<br>
In FIG. 15, spreading section 121 performs spreading<br>
on a transmission signal output from transmission buffer<br>
section 11, and thereby assigns each of subcarriers<br>
composing the transmission signal to spreading chips.<br>
The transmission signal with each subcarrier assigned<br>
the chips is subjected to diversity combining in<br>
transmission diversity section 14, and the resultant<br>
radio signal is transmitted from corresponding antenna<br>
element 17 or 18 through transmitting section 15 or 16,<br>
respectively.<br>
In this way, according to this embodiment, since<br>
the diversity effect is improved on slots configured in<br>
the second region, it is thereby possible to decrease<br>
deterioration in the orthogonality between spreading<br>
codes. As a result, since the number of spreading chips<br>
usable in the frequency division multiplexing increases ,<br>
it is possible to improve the transmission efficiency.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment,<br>
a communication frame is provided with a second region<br>
having a short open-loop period, and transmission signals<br>
assigned to slots in the second region are subjected to<br>
the diversity combining , whereby it is possible to improve<br>
the diversity effect while hardly degrading the<br>
transmission efficiency.<br>
