				<td>STRUCTURE FOR CATHODIC FINGERS OF CHLOR-ALKALI DIAPHRAGM<br>
CELLS<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The production of chlorine by electrolysis of solutions of alkali halides,<br>
particularly of sodium chloride solutions, is nowadays the electrochemical<br>
process by far of greatest industrial relevance: it can be carried out by means of<br>
three different technologies, namely membrane, diaphragm and mercury<br>
cathode electrolysis.<br>
The first technology, which is the most advanced and most recently established,<br>
is characterised by lower energy consumption resulting from lower cell voltage<br>
and reduced use of steam required for caustic soda concentration. The two<br>
other techniques are negatively affected to a large extent by the substantially<br>
greater energy consumption due to the higher cell voltage and, in the case of<br>
diaphragm cells, to the considerable amount of steam required for concentrating<br>
caustic soda up to the commercial value of 50% by weight. However, despite<br>
the obvious advantage, the membrane technology is still characterised by a<br>
lower than expected market penetration, having only been used up to now for<br>
the construction of few new plants and the replacement of diaphragm and<br>
mercury cathode plants already obsolete and of hard maintenance. This<br>
situation is practically due to the fact that the existing diaphragm and mercury<br>
cathode plants have essentially no capital costs, since all of them were built in<br>
the seventies and eighties, later experiencing continuous improvements, which<br>
have essentially solved the problems of environmental pollution associated with<br>
the release of asbestos fibres and mercury, meanwhile improving their<br>
energetic consumption and thereby reducing their gap versus the membrane<br>
technology.<br>
In the specific case of diaphragm plants, the diaphragms consisting of asbestos<br>
fibres bonded with perfluorinated polymers were overcome by the diaphragms<br>
consisting of perfluorinated polymer fibres hydrophilised by means of various<br>
additives, for example fibres or particles of zirconium oxide. Furthermore, the<br>
conventional expandable anodes made of titanium activated by platinum group<br>
metal oxides were substantially improved thanks to a so-called zero gap<br>
version, provided with devices capable of exerting an elastic pressure and<br>
bringing the anode movable surface in direct and extended contact with the<br>
diaphragm as described in US patent 5,534,122; moreover said anodes have<br>
been equipped with double expanders, in other words connections allowing the<br>
passage of electric current from the movable surfaces of the anodes to the<br>
current distributing bars, with appreciable ohmic drop reduction, as illustrated in<br>
US patent 5,993,620. Furthermore, the anodes can be advantageously provided<br>
with devices allowing a significant increase of the internal recirculation of brine<br>
with a consequent advantage in terms of lower voltage and decreased oxygen<br>
evolution, two factors both allowing to reduce the energy consumption per ton of<br>
produced chlorine: this latter improvement is described in US patent 5,066,378.<br>
Finally, the replacement of the rubber linings used to protect the copper bases<br>
whereon the anodes are fixed with titanium sheets, and the use of new types of<br>
elastic seals between cathode body and anode supporting base and between<br>
each anode and its supporting base as indicated in WO 01/34878 have allowed<br>
to considerably extend the operating lifetime of the individual cells which<br>
constitute an electrolysis plant: this resulted in a further reduction of<br>
maintenance costs and a greater production capacity with unchanged cell<br>
design.<br>
A very clear description of the operation of the chlor-alkali diaphragm cells is<br>
given in Ullmann"s Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 5a Ed., Vol. A6, pp.<br>
424 - 437, VCH, while details of the internal structure of these cells are<br>
exhaustively illustrated in the figures of US 5,066,378.<br>
As it can be noticed, the several proposals made in the years to improve the<br>
operation of the diaphragm cells are essentially directed to finding more or less<br>
drastic modifications of diaphragms and anodes with the relevant way of their<br>
fixing to the supporting base, whereas substantially poor attention was devoted<br>
to the cathodes, both as concerns the cathode body with the relevant electrical<br>
connections and the structure of the active cathodic surface whereon the<br>
hydrogen evolution reaction and the formation of caustic soda take place. In<br>
particular, the latter element, namely the active cathodic area, consists of a<br>
conductive surface provided with holes, such as a mesh of interwoven wires or<br>
a perforated sheet both made of conductive material, generally carbon steel,<br>
shaped as to form prism-like structures with rather flattened rectangular section<br>
fixed by welding to a perimetrical chamber, equally consisting of interwoven<br>
wires or of a perforated sheet, connected to the side walls of the cathodic body<br>
and provided with at least one nozzle on the bottom to provide an outlet for the<br>
solution containing the product caustic soda and the depleted sodium chloride,<br>
and with at least one nozzle on the top for the hydrogen discharge. On these<br>
structures, known to the experts in the field as "fingers", the diaphragm is<br>
deposited by means of vacuum suction from an aqueous suspension containing<br>
the polymer fibres and particles which, as previously mentioned, constitute the<br>
diaphragm itself. In the diaphragm cell structure, the diaphragm-coated fingers<br>
are intercalated with the anodes and the surface thereof can either be in contact<br>
with that of the diaphragms or spaced therefrom by few millimetres. In both<br>
cases the fingers shall not undergo any flexure that would cause abrasions on<br>
the diaphragm with consequent deterioration thereof. Moreover, during<br>
operation the current must be transmitted as uniformly as possible to the entire<br>
surface of the fingers: a non uniform distribution would involve an increase in<br>
the cell voltage and a decrease in the efficiency of caustic soda generation with<br>
simultaneous higher oxygen content in chlorine. As a consequence, for the best<br>
result, the fingers must be provided with adequate stiffness and at the same<br>
time with high electric conduction.<br>
According to US patent 4,138,295 granted to Diamond Shamrock Technologies<br>
SA, Switzerland and to the more recent patent application WO 00/06798 filed by<br>
Eltech Systems Corp., USA, the fingers are provided with a longitudinally<br>
corrugated internal sheet made of carbon steel or copper: the mesh of<br>
interwoven wires or the perforated sheet is fixed, preferably by welding, to the<br>
vertices of the corrugations well solving the problems of the homogeneous<br>
current distribution and of the stiffness. However the corrugations, developed as<br>
mentioned in the longitudinal direction, do not allow the hydrogen bubbles to<br>
rise freely in the vertical direction, to subsequently gather along the upper<br>
generatrix of the fingers and enter therefrom the perimetrical chamber equipped<br>
as said with at least one outlet for the gases. The longitudinally corrugated<br>
sheet forces hydrogen to gather below each of the corrugations and to flow<br>
longitudinally along each corrugation until exiting through appropriate openings<br>
into the perimetrical chamber: since this flow can hardly be equalised, the<br>
amount of hydrogen present under each corrugation is variable and occludes to<br>
a different extent the corresponding facing zone of the diaphragm. Hence, it can<br>
be concluded that the longitudinally corrugated internal sheet causes an<br>
inevitable unbalance of the electric current distribution. This unbalance, in its<br>
turn, leads to an inhomogeneous concentration of the caustic soda with a<br>
negative impact on both the faradic efficiency and the oxygen content in<br>
chlorine.<br>
Also US patent 4,049,495 granted to O. De Nora Impianti Elettrochimici S.p.A,<br>
Italy, describes the use of corrugated internal sheets, but with vertically<br>
arranged corrugations: in this case it is obvious that hydrogen can freely gather<br>
in the upper portion of the fingers, but its flow towards the perimetrical chamber<br>
is hindered by the upper portion of the corrugations. Furthermore, for a given<br>
electric current distribution, the stiffening effect of the vertical corrugations may<br>
be unsatisfactory.<br>
US patents 3,988,220 and 3,910,827, both granted to PPG Industries Inc., USA,<br>
disclose designs for the element inside the fingers similar to those just<br>
considered, respectively horizontal strips of perforated sheet and longitudinal<br>
conductive bars provided with vertical strips of sheet welded thereto. Though<br>
undoubtedly ensuring an appropriate stiffness, the latter solution entails the<br>
problem of the difficult hydrogen release discussed in the case of US 4,049,495.<br>
The design of US 3,988,220, on the contrary, represents a satisfactory answer<br>
to the requirements of stiffness, homogeneous current distribution and free<br>
hydrogen discharge, but only by means of a complex structure, difficult to be<br>
made and therefore unacceptably expensive. Moreover the structure of US<br>
3,988,220 does not allow the upward movement of hydrogen bubbles to create<br>
an appropriate recirculation of the product caustic soda inside the fingers: as a<br>
consequence of this missed recirculation, pockets of caustic soda at higher<br>
concentration may be present, particularly in case of anomalies in the electric<br>
current distribution and of diaphragm porosity, with negative impacts on the<br>
faradic efficiency and the oxygen content in chlorine.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel finger<br>
structure particularly suitable for chlor-alkali diaphragm electrolysis cells,<br>
characterised by substantial stiffness and uniformity of electric current<br>
distribution, and capable of overcoming the drawbacks of the structures of the<br>
prior art.<br>
Under a first aspect the present invention consists of a finger structure for chlor-<br>
alkali diaphragm cells provided with high conductivity and capable of ensuring a<br>
substantial homogeneity of electric current distribution on the whole surface of<br>
the fingers.<br>
Under a second aspect the structure of the present invention is characterised by<br>
the necessary stiffness to prevent flexures capable of inducing abrasions<br>
against the anodes of said chlor-alkali diaphragm cells and possibly of<br>
damaging the diaphragm deposited on said fingers.<br>
Under a third aspect the structure of the present invention allows the free<br>
upward motion of the hydrogen bubbles and the free flow of hydrogen,<br>
separated along the upper generatrix of the fingers, in the longitudinal direction<br>
towards the perimetrical chamber of the cells.<br>
Under a further aspect the structure of the present invention facilitates the<br>
internal natural recirculation of caustic soda, induced by the upward motion of<br>
the hydrogen bubbles, ensuring a substantially uniform concentration inside the<br>
fingers.<br>
These and other consequent advantages will be made clearer by the following<br>
detailed description of the invention.<br>
The present invention consists of a novel structure for fingers of diaphragm<br>
electrolytic cells, particularly useful for chlor-alkali diaphragm cells.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the novel finger structure comprises a hollow<br>
portion defining an internal volume in fluid communication with a perimetrical<br>
chamber, the hollow portion housing a current distributing reinforcing element<br>
comprising a sheet or multiplicity of sheets provided with projections.<br>
The invention will be described making reference to chlor-alkali diaphragm<br>
electrolysis cells for the sake of simplicity, but it is understood that the structure<br>
of the present invention can be applied to all diaphragm cells equipped with<br>
fingers; the structure of the invention allows to simultaneously achieve:<br>
a) a uniform distribution of electric current on the whole surface of the fingers<br>
and therefore of the diaphragm deposited thereon,<br>
b) an appropriate stiffness such as to prevent flexures capable of causing<br>
rubbing between fingers and anodes, which in said cells are intercalated to<br>
the fingers, with possible damage to the diaphragm due to abrasion,<br>
c) a free ascensional movement of the hydrogen bubbles generated on the<br>
surface of the mesh or perforated sheet made of conductive material<br>
constituting the fingers with equally free longitudinal flow of hydrogen<br>
towards the perimetrical chamber of said cells,<br>
d) an optimal recirculation inside the fingers of the caustic soda formed<br>
simultaneously with hydrogen on the surface of said meshes or perforated<br>
sheets with consequent homogenisation of the concentration even in case of<br>
local inhomogeneity of the diaphragm porosity and anomalies in the electric<br>
current distribution.<br>
This set of advantages is achieved according to a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention using at least one current distributing<br>
reinforcement sheet longitudinally inserted inside each finger, wherein said<br>
sheet is provided with projections on both sides.<br>
As shown in figures 1 and 2, where a portion of sheet (1) according to the<br>
invention and two cross sections are respectively illustrated, the projections are<br>
preferably arranged according to a quincuncial pattern and are similar to<br>
spherical caps obtained by plastic deformation of the original flat sheet 1. The<br>
projections (2) protruding towards the observer are indicated by a continuous<br>
line, whereas the projections (3) protruding towards the opposite side are<br>
indicated by a dotted line. Figure 2 shows the two cross sections of figure 1<br>
according to the X - X and Y - Y lines: in both cases, the thickness of sheet in<br>
section is identified by hatching.<br>
Although the realisation of the projections by plastic processing, for example by<br>
deformation of the sheet using a suitable tool in an appropriate press, is the<br>
particularly preferred manufacturing process, manufacturing methods based on<br>
welding or brazing of projections, separately obtained, onto the flat sheet can<br>
also be used, and it is understood that the structures thus obtained fall within<br>
the scope of the present invention. However it is clear to the experts of the field<br>
that these methods require a labour commitment which makes them intrinsically<br>
slow and definitely more expensive than the method of plastic processing.<br>
Although in figures 1 and 2 the projections are equivalent to spherical caps,<br>
different shapes are also possible, for example elliptic caps, as indicated in<br>
figure 3, or prismatic sections as indicated in figure 4: in these figures the<br>
projections protruding towards the observer ((4) and (6) respectively) are again<br>
indicated by continuous lines, whereas those protruding towards the opposite<br>
directions ((5) and (7) respectively) are identified by dotted lines. Other shapes<br>
are further conceivable even if those allowing production by plastic deformation<br>
of the original flat sheets are preferred, as this process can be easily automated<br>
with a far reduced manpower.<br>
A particularly preferred aspect of the present invention is the arrangement of the<br>
projections according to a quincuncial pattern or the like, wherein no completely<br>
flat vertical portions of sheet are present: as made clear by figure 1, each<br>
vertical section of the sheet affects at least a portion of some projections, which<br>
therefore effectively cooperate to provide a high stiffness, defined as the<br>
tendency of the sheet to counteract a transverse bending. This aspect is critical<br>
to avoid flexures during the assembling of the cathodic body provided with<br>
fingers with the conductive base provided with anodes that must be intercalated<br>
to the fingers, or even during operation where differential thermal expansions or<br>
turbulences of the brine induced by the ascensional motion of gaseous chlorine<br>
bubbles may occur. Considering that fingers lined with diaphragm and anodes,<br>
once intercalated, are in direct contact to each other or in any case spaced by<br>
few millimetres, any inflection of the fingers may easily cause abrasion against<br>
the anodes capable of damaging the diaphragm with consequent operation<br>
shut-down.<br>
As a comparison with the quincuncial arrangement of figure 1, figure 5 shows<br>
another sheet provided with spherical cap-shaped projections according to a<br>
less preferred embodiment of the invention, with distance between centres and<br>
bending radii on the extrados and intrados as in the previous case, but arranged<br>
according to a square mesh pattern; the various elements are identified by the<br>
same reference numbers as used in figure 1. In the case illustrated just now,<br>
the stiffness obtained expressed in terms of bending resistance is sensibly<br>
lower than in the sheet of figure 1.<br>
Figure 6 shows a partially cutaway side view of a portion of the assembly<br>
according to the invention consisting of a finger made of interwoven wire mesh<br>
(8) with a sheet positioned inside (1) provided with projections (2) and (3) in the<br>
form of spherical caps arranged according to the quincuncial pattern of figure 1<br>
and obtained by plastic deformation, for example by pressing. It is quite<br>
possible for each finger according to the invention to be also equipped with two<br>
superimposed sheets. The diaphragm is identified by (10).<br>
With reference to figure 6, it can be immediately noticed that the surfaces of the<br>
finger consisting of interwoven wire mesh are secured onto the apex (9) of each<br>
projection, preferably by welding: being the projection arrangement repetitive,<br>
the welding process can be easily automated with considerable saving of time,<br>
manpower and manufacturing costs. The fixing of the surfaces of each finger<br>
onto the apex (9) of the projections generates a plurality of equivalent ohmic<br>
paths which are necessary to have the electric current carried by the sheet (1)<br>
distributed in a very uniform and predetermined manner to the surface of the<br>
interwoven wire mesh of each finger (8). Moreover, the fixing (9) ensures<br>
optimal support and stiffness to the finger (8)-pressed sheet (1) assembly.<br>
Since the welding of the interwoven wire meshes or the perforated sheets gives<br>
the assembly a greater stiffness than that of the sheet alone, it is also possible<br>
to use pressed sheets provided with projections wherein completely flat vertical<br>
sections are present, as schematically shown in figure 5, despite the fact that<br>
this type of sheet, characterised by lower stiffness as previously discussed,<br>
does not represent a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In a further embodiment, the sheet provided with projections on both sides may<br>
be replaced by a couple of mutually contacting sheets, each provided with<br>
projections on the surface opposite to the contact surface.<br>
As figure 7 schematically indicates by arrows in a portion of the finger - mesh -<br>
pressed sheet assembly according to the invention, the use of the sheet<br>
provided with projections entails a free ascensional movement of the hydrogen<br>
bubbles (11) generated during operation inside each finger. As a consequence,<br>
hydrogen gathering along the finger upper generatrix (12) can freely flow<br>
towards the perimetrical chamber provided in the chlor-alkali diaphragm cells to<br>
be discharged therefrom towards the general manifold through the nozzle<br>
located on the top of the perimetrical chamber.<br>
The sheet provided with projections according to the invention subdivides the<br>
internal volume of each finger into two portions and the thickness thereof is<br>
practically nearly half the thickness of the finger wherein the sheet is installed.<br>
The volume of each portion is only partially occupied by the sheet projections,<br>
and therefore the ascensional movement of the hydrogen bubbles can easily<br>
generate an effective natural recirculation of caustic soda therein. This<br>
recirculation, indicated by arrows in figure 8, which schematically shows a cross<br>
view of the finger - mesh assembly according to the invention, is particularly<br>
useful in that it allows to maintain a substantially uniform concentration of<br>
caustic soda inside each finger during electrolysis, even in case of<br>
inhomogeneous porosity of the diaphragms and anomalous local distribution of<br>
electric current: actually in this case, in the absence of an effective recirculation,<br>
a local increase in the caustic soda concentration would occur with a negative<br>
impact on the faradic efficiency of the process and a consequent increase of<br>
oxygen content in chlorine. As known to the experts in the art, a number of<br>
chlorine users, as for example plants producing dichloroethane and other<br>
chlorinated derivatives, require an oxygen content in chlorine not exceeding<br>
specific critical limits, over which chlorine purification through liquefaction and<br>
subsequent re-evaporation becomes necessary: therefore all those devices,<br>
such as the structure for fingers of the present invention, which installed in the<br>
cells ensure a high qualitative level of produced chlorine, offer an obvious<br>
advantage.<br>
Though not strictly necessary, openings, not shown in the figures, can be made<br>
in correspondence to the residual flat areas of the sheets provided with<br>
projections according to the present invention: these openings are directed to<br>
favour the mixing of the caustic soda present in the two portions of volume<br>
formed inside each finger by the sheet of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
In order to allow a comparative evaluation of the validity of what disclosed in the<br>
present invention, two cells of a line of diaphragm cells of a chlor-alkali<br>
industrial plant fed with a current of 100 kA have been modified. The cells of the<br>
concerned line were provided with a cathodic body comprising fingers<br>
consisting of carbon steel interwoven wire mesh housing a 6 mm thick sheet,<br>
longitudinally corrugated as described in US 4,138,295 and WO 00/06798: two<br>
of these cells, whose cathodic body after some years of operation showed an<br>
already worn out finger mesh, were subjected to the necessary procedures of<br>
replacement in a service site with reconstruction of the fingers by means of the<br>
same type of interwoven wire mesh previously used, but with modification of the<br>
internal sheet that was replaced in one of the two cells, hereinafter defined as<br>
cell A, by a couple of sheets provided with projections according to the present<br>
invention, and in the other cell, hereinafter defined as cell B, by the strips of<br>
perforated sheet described in US 3,988,220. In particular the sheets according<br>
to the invention had a thickness of 6 millimetres and were provided with<br>
projections similar to spherical caps with an arrangement according to the<br>
quincuncial pattern of figure 1, with distance between the centres of two<br>
adjacent projections equivalent to 57.7 millimetres and with each projection<br>
characterised by radii of extrados and intrados equivalent to 20 and 14<br>
millimetres respectively. The indicated dimensions have been chosen according<br>
to a preferred embodiment of the invention; in general, sheets having thickness<br>
between 5 and 7 millimetres are preferred, whereas it was found that the<br>
optimal distance between the projections is ranging from 50 to 65 millimetres,<br>
with radii of extrados and intrados ranging from 17 and 22 and from 12 and 16<br>
millimetres respectively.<br>
The strips of perforated sheet of the fingers of the cell B having thickness of 6<br>
millimetres have been inserted into each finger in such a number as to obtain a<br>
section for the electric current passage similar to that of the couple of sheets<br>
according to the invention installed in each finger of the cell A. The openings,<br>
made on each strip on three rows, had a diameter of 8 millimetres.<br>
No additional modification was made on the remaining parts of cells A and B,<br>
except for the obvious installation of a new set of sealing gaskets between<br>
cathodic body - anodic base, cathodic body - cover, nozzles - pipes, and a<br>
new diaphragm.<br>
After a few weeks of operation considered necessary for the stabilisation of the<br>
different components and particularly of the diaphragms, cell voltage, faradic<br>
efficiency of caustic soda production and oxygen content in the product chlorine<br>
were determined with the following results:<br>
- unmodified cells of the plant: voltage 3.6 volt, faradic efficiency 93%, oxygen<br>
content in chlorine 3%<br>
- cell A according to the present invention: voltage 3.5 volt, faradic efficiency<br>
95%, oxygen content in chlorine 2.3%<br>
- cell B according to US 3,988,220: voltage 3.55 volt, faradic efficiency 94%,<br>
oxygen content in chlorine 2.7%<br>
The above description is not to be intended as limiting the invention, which can<br>
be practised according to different embodiments without departing from its<br>
scope, and whose domain is solely defined by the appended claims.<br>
In the description and claims of the present application, the word "comprise"<br>
and variations thereof such as "comprising" and "comprises" are not intended to<br>
