				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a toothbrush having needle-shaped<br>
bristle, and in particular, to a toothbrush tufted with 13 to 18mm long needle-<br>
shaped bristles tapered only on one end, and a manufacturing method thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Since the introduction of a toothbrush tufted with tapered bristles for<br>
effective plaque removal and prevention of damage to gums during teeth<br>
brushing, its verified effectiveness has recently made this toothbrush popular.<br>
For fabrication of such a traditional toothbrush, 28 to 33mm long bristles,<br>
which are needle-shaped on one end t and non-needle-shaped on the other end<br>
n, are folded over such that the needle-shaped portion is longer than the non-<br>
needle-shaped portion, as illustrated in FIGs. 1A and 1B. The folded portions are<br>
picked up by means of a cut wire and fixedly inserted into fixing holes in the<br>
head of the toothbrush. The toothbrush manufacturing method is disclosed in<br>
Japanese Patent Open-Laid No. Sho 61-10495.<br>
As illustrate in FIG. 2, another traditional toothbrush is made by folding<br>
needle-shaped bristles, which are 28 to 33mm long and tapered 4 to 8mm on<br>
both ends, in two equal halves and planting them in the above-described<br>
manner. This toothbrush manufacturing technique is disclosed in Japanese<br>
Patent Open-Laid No. Hei 5â€”15834.<br>
In Korea Patent No. 311360, the present inventor disclosed a toothbrush<br>
tufted with ordinary bristles tapered on both ends and at least one 1 to 10mm<br>
longer bristle 62 of the same shape.<br>
The above techniques, though they have their own benefits and drawbacks,<br>
commonly boast excellent plaque removal and improved health of gums.<br>
However, they suffer from the same shortcomings of complex manufacturing,<br>
high interior goods rate, and thus high production cost, for the following reasons.<br>
(1) In order to shape ordinary polyester bristles into needles, the tips of the<br>
bristles are treated with a chemical such as caustic soda or sulphuric acid. During<br>
this process, the total length and tapered length of the bristles are difficult to<br>
control, thereby resulting in many inferior bristles. (2) In the case of a today"s<br>
popular needle-shaped toothbrush tufted with bristles tapered on both ends,<br>
both tips of the bristles are treated in the above-described manner, for needle<br>
shaping. Even if one tip of a bristle is successful tapered, the failure of the other<br>
tip leads to the whole failure of the bristle. (3) There are no appropriate<br>
applications for utilizing bristles having wrong lengths.<br>
Besides, the traditional toothbrush bristles are planted in simple patterns and<br>
not tightly fixed, as illustrated in FIG.4. As a result, the bristles often fall out of<br>
the brushes. The cause is identified that the bristles are folded by half, picked up<br>
with a wire, and pushed into fixing holes 10 by inserting the wire itself.<br>
WO 01/32053 discloses a toothbrush which uses a synthetic monofilament (18)<br>
having a taper having a ratio p specified by the formula: p = s/So = a. x? (0.85 -<br>
a) (0.05 = a = 0.65) wherein s represents when three dimensional coordinates<br>
(x, y, z) are set with an origin point (0, 0, 0) at the tip of the monofilament and<br>
the central axis of the monofilament is conformed to the +x axis of said<br>
coordinates, a cross-sectional area in the direction of the yz plane at an arbitrary<br>
position in the range of 0.1 mm to 8.0 from the tip in the tapered part (20) of<br>
the monofilament, and SO represents the cross sectional area in the direction of<br>
the yz plane at the position of the monofilament showing the maximum<br>
diameter. The toothbrush has filament tips being easy to enter between teeth<br>
and into a pocket portion around a tooth and a triangle portion between teeth.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a toothbrush<br>
tufted with needle-shaped bristles, which is manufactured in a simplified process<br>
at a diminished failure rate.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of utilizing<br>
bristles having wrong lengths for manufacture of a toothbrush.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of fixing<br>
bristles more tightly in a toothbrush.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method of freely<br>
designing a bristle planting pattern and adjusting the number of bristles for a<br>
toothbrush.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The above objects are achieved by a toothbrush tufted with needle-shaped<br>
bristles. The bristles are formed of polyester resin. The bristles are 0.1 to 0.2mm<br>
thick before tapering, 13 to 18mm long, tapered 4 to 8mm only on one end with<br>
a tapered tip thickness of 0.01 to 0.08mm, and planted to be 7 to 13mm high in<br>
the toothbrush.<br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described herein below<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-<br>
known<br>
functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the<br>
invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
A toothbrush according to the present invention is comprised of one-end tapered<br>
bristles formed of polyester resin to be 13 to 18mm in total length and 4 to 8mm in tapered<br>
length. To manufacture the toothbrush, the non-tapered portions of the bristles are pushed<br>
down into through holes arranged in a planting pattern in a bristle holder. The bottom of<br>
the bristle holder is thermally fused to thereby fix the bristles to the bristle holder. The<br>
bristle holder is then attached to the head of the toothbrush.<br>
FIG. 5 is a side view of a single needle-shaped bristle 60 13 to 18mm in length<br>
and 4 to 8mm in tapered length according to the present invention. As compared to a<br>
traditional both-end tapered bristle, the bristle 60 is tapered only on one end and shorter by<br>
half with the same tapered length. The one-end tapering diminishes a bristle failure rate<br>
involved with tapering.<br>
Since the bristle 60 is planted 5 to 6mm deep in a toothbrush head, it is then 7 to<br>
13 mm high from the surface of the toothbrush head.<br>
The tapered tip of the bristle 60 is 0.01 to 0.08mm thick. The tapered tip thickness<br>
is preferably 0.01 to 0.03mm to allow the bristles to reach deep between teeth and into gum<br>
pockets., and 0.03 to 0.08mm for thorough cleansing. Both features can be obtained by<br>
planting the two types of bristles in combination, or grinding bristles by means of a mesh<br>
paper (i.e. sandpaper) after planting, which will be described later.<br>
It is preferable to form the bristles of polyester resin, specifically PET<br>
(Polyethylene Terephthalate) or PBT (Polybuthylene Terephthalate) resin. It is because<br>
other materials such as Nylon, acryl, and PP (Polypropylene) resin are inferior in terms of<br>
water resistance, durability, and strength, and bristles formed of such a material are<br>
entangled when they are immersed in a strong acid or alkaline solution, for tapering. Thus,<br>
processing is difficult.<br>
FIG. 6 is a view illustrating the bristles 60 loaded vertically in a cylindrical plastic<br>
container 61. The loaded bristles 60 are held in a primary bristle holder 20 as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 7, transferred to a secondary bristle holder 30 as illustrated in FIG. 8, and then<br>
transferred to a head insert 50 as illustrated in FIG. 9. The primary bristle holder 20, the<br>
secondary bristle holder 30, and the head insert 50 include through holes 21 of the same<br>
shape. The primary and secondary bristle holders 20 and 30 are formed of a metal, whereas<br>
the head insert 50 is preferably formed of plastic though a metal can be used.<br>
Since the primary and secondary bristle holders 20 and 30 function to transfer the<br>
bristles 60 to the head insert 50, they are of a metal due to its excellent durability. The head<br>
insert 50 is formed of plastic because it is attached to a toothbrush body 70, with the<br>
bristles 60 planted therein.<br>
The bristles 60 are held in the primary bristle holder 20 by pushing the bristles 60<br>
into the primary bristle holder 20 with a pusher 40 having inserting poles 41 matching the<br>
through holes 21 of the primary bristle holder 20, as illustrated in FIG. 10.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, the bristles 60 are then transferred from the primary bristle<br>
holder 20 to the head insert 50 through the secondary bristle holder 30 by pushing the<br>
bristles 60 held in the primary bristle holder 20 to the secondary bristle holder 30 and then<br>
the head insert 50 with the pusher 40, while matching the through holes 21, in alignment,<br>
of the primary and secondary bristle holders 20 and 30 and the head insert 50. Here, the<br>
non-tapered portions of the bristles 60 are upward.<br>
Referring to FIG. 12, the bristles 60 protruding from the head insert 50 are<br>
thermally fused, thereby being fixed firmly to the head insert 50.<br>
During this process, the length of the bristles 60 is controllable to some extent.<br>
That is, short bristles 60 are thermally fused while they are protruded to a short length, for<br>
example, lmm or less, and long bristles 60, while they are protruded to a long length, for<br>
example, about 3mm. In the case of very long bristles, they are thermally fused in the<br>
above manner and then their tips are cut, followed by grinding with a mesh paper.<br>
Therefore, an available length range for the one-end tapered bristles 60 is widened.<br>
When the bristles differ in length after planting, the tips of longer ones are cut and<br>
ground by a mesh paper. Thus, the length and tip thickness of the bristles are controlled. In<br>
this case, bristles having a tip thickness of 0.01 to 0.03mm coexist with ones having a tip<br>
thickness of 0.03 to 0.08mm. As a result, the bristles reach deeper between teeth and into<br>
gum pockets and clean the surfaces of the teeth thoroughly.<br>
To reach deeper into the gum pockets, the bristles can be planted such that they<br>
differ in length by 1 to 10mm. That is, the planting of long bristles and short bristles with a<br>
1 to 10mm length difference makes the longer ones reach further between teeth or into<br>
gum pockets.<br>
The head insert 50 having the bristles 60 fixed thereto is attached to the head of<br>
the toothbrush body 70 by an adhesive, ultrasonic bonding or high frequency bonding.<br>
Considering product yield, the ultrasonic or high frequency bonding is more <br>
preferable. In this case, a head insert opening 51 is preferably formed in the head of the<br>
toothbrush body 70, so that the head insert 50 can be mounted in the head insert opening<br>
51, as illustrated in FIG. 13. The thus-completed toothbrush is illustrated in FIG. 14.<br>
An alternative way of fixing the head insert 50 with the bristles 60 to the<br>
toothbrush body 70 is, as illustrated in FIG. 15, to combine a lower metal mold 90 to an<br>
upper metal mold 80 with the bottom of the head insert 50 fixed thereto, injecting resin<br>
into the lower metal mold 90 through an inlet 91, so that the head and handle of the<br>
toothbrush are integrally formed and at the same time, the head insert 50 is tightly<br>
combined with the toothbrush head. This fixing method advantageously enables<br>
manufacture of various types of toothbrushes using metal molds for the toothbrush head<br>
and handle of different shapes, increases process efficiency, prevents introduction of<br>
foreign materials due to formation of no junction gaps, and makes it possible to reduce the<br>
thickness of the toothbrush head, thus allowing easy thorough teeth brushing.<br>
Another way of planting the bristles 60 in a toothbrush body is that the non-<br>
tapered portions of the bristles 60 are inserted into through holes in the lower metal mold<br>
90, protruding 2 to 5 mm from the metal mold 90, these protrusions are thermally fused,<br>
an upper metal mold (not shown) is combined with the lower metal mold 90, and then<br>
resin is injected so that the bristles 60 are attached directly to the toothbrush body, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 16. This method also offers the benefits that the toothbrush head is<br>
integrated into the toothbrush handle, product yield is increased, no junction gaps are<br>
produced to thereby prevent introduction of foreign materials, and reduces the thickness<br>
of the toothbrush head.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As described above, the toothbrush according to the present invention is tufted<br>
with needle-shaped bristles tapered only on one end, as compared to the traditional<br>
toothbrush having both-end tapered bristles. Therefore, an inferior goods rate is<br>
remarkably dropped and thus product cost can be reduced by 30% or more.<br>
Furthermore, a bristle planting pattern and the number of the needle-shaped<br>
bristles can be freely controlled, thereby enabling the bristles to clean away hard-to-reach<br>
plague. The use of thermal fusion instead of a cut wire leads to tighter fixing of the bristles.<br>
Even needle-shaped bristles which are failed in length control can be utilized for<br>
fabrication of the toothbrush.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain<br>
preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
