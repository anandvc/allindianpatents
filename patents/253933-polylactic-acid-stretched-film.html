3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
TECHNICAL HELD<br>
The present invention relates to a polylactic acid stretched film having biodegradability and excelling in transparency and heat resistance.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Biodegradable films have attracted attention as a means for facilitating waste processing of plastic films, and a variety of biodegradable films have been developed. Biodegradable films are subjected to hydrolysis or biodegradation in soil or water, the films are gradually destructed or decomposed, and eventually they are converted by action of microorganisms into nonhazardous decomposition products. Films molded from aromatic polyester resins, aliphatic polyester resins such as polylactic acid and polybutylene succinate, polyvinyl alcohol, acetate cellulose, starch, and the like are known as such films.<br>
Because biaxially stretched films comprising polylactic acid, which is a biodegradable resin, excel in transparency, they started finding application as films for packaging, but such films have poor heat resistance.<br>
A large number of methods comprising blending poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) with poly-D-lactic acid (PDLA) and forming a stereocomplex have been suggested (for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H9-25400 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 2000-17164; and Macromolecules, 20,904 (1987)).<br>
However, even when a composition obtained by simple melt kneading of PLLA and PDLA is molded into a film, a stereocomplex is not easily formed and although the film formed is improved in heat resistance, the film is brittle and difficult to use as a film for packaging or the like.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to develop a polylactic acid stretched film having biodegradability and excelling in transparency and heat resistance.<br>
The present invention provides a polylactic acid stretched film comprising a polylactic acid composition containing poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid, wherein a peak ratio (peak 1/peak 2) of a peak height (peak 1) of a maximum endothermic peak of endothermic peaks within a range of 150 to 200°C to a peak height (peak 2) of a maximum endothermic peak of endothermic peaks within a range of 205 to 240°C in DSC measurements is equal to or less than 0.2.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Poly-L-lactic acid<br>
Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) that is one component of the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention is a polymer comprising a structural component based on L-lactic acid at a ratio preferably equal to or greater than 95 mol%. A polymer with a L-lactic acid content of less than 95 mol% can degrade heat resistance of a stretched film obtained by stretching a polylactic acid composition obtained by melt kneading with the below-described poly-D-lactic acid (PDLA).<br>
A molecular weight of PLLA is not particularly limited, provided that a polylactic acid composition obtained by mixing with the below-described poly-D-lactic acid can be molded into a layer such as a film, but poly-L-lactic acid with a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) within a range of 6,000 to 3,000,000, preferably 6,000 to'2,000,000 is usually preferred.<br>
A stretched film obtained when the weight-average molecular weight of PLLA is less than 6,000 can have poor strength. Meanwhile, when the molecular weight exceeds 3,000,000, melt viscosity is high and film processability can deteriorate.<br>

Poly-D-lactic acid (PDLA) that is one component of the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention is a polymer comprising a structural component based on D-lactic acid at a ratio preferably equal to or greater than 95 mol%. A polymer with a D-lactic acid content of less than 95 mol% can degrade heat resistance of a stretched film obtained by stretching a polylactic acid composition obtained by melt kneading with the above-described poIy-L-lactic acid.<br>
A molecular weight of PDLA is not particularly limited, provided that a polylactic acid composition obtained by mixing with the above-described poly-L-lactic acid can be molded into a layer such as a film, but poly-D-lactic acid with a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) within a range of 6,000 to 3,000,000, preferably 6,000 to 2,000,000 is usually preferred. A stretched film obtained when the weight-average molecular weight of PDLA is less than 6,000 can have poor strength.

-9-<br><br>
the vicinity of 12 degrees, 21 degrees, and 24 degrees are peaks (Psc) based on crystals of the so-called stereocomplex produced by co-crystallization of PLLA and PDLA.<br>
The wide-angle X-ray diffraction peak (20) in the present invention is the angle (degree) of the diffraction peak detected by measurements using an X-ray diffraction device (automated X-ray diffraction device RINT-2200 or RINT-2500 manufactured by Rigaku Corp.). Each diffraction peak area based on crystals was calculated by cutting out an area of each diffraction peak (20) in the vicinity of 17 degrees and 19 degrees for (SPL) and in the vicinity of 12 degrees, 21 degrees, and 24 degrees for (Ssc) from a recording paper and measuring the weight thereof, wherein a total area (entire area) for a diffraction angle (29) of 10 to 30 degrees surrounded by the base line (intensity; 0 cps) of the recording paper and the X-ray diffraction intensity curve was taken as 100%. A broad portion originating in a non-crystalline portion was taken as "amorphous portion". When (SPL) and (Ssc) were measured, the diffraction curve (background) associated with the amorphous portion was taken as a baseline, and a portion above it was measured.<br>
As for thermal melting properties of the polylactic acid stretched film in accordance with the present invention, Q100 manufactured by TA Instrument was used as a DSC (differential scanning calorimeter), about 5 mg of a sample was accurately measured, the sample was heated from 0°C to 250°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min under a nitrogen gas inflow rate of 50 ml/min in conformance with JIS K 7121 and JIS K 7122, a DSC curve during heating was obtained, a melting point Tm of the stretched film, an endothermic amount (AHm) of an endothermic peak within a range of 205 to 240°C, and a peak ratio (peak 1/peak 2) of a peak height (peak 1) of a maximum endothermic peak of endothermic peaks within a range of 150 to 200°C to a peak height (peak 2) of a maximum endothermic peak of endothermic peaks within a range of 205 to 240°C were found from the obtained DSC curve, the temperature was maintained at 250°C for 10 min, the sample was then cooled to 0°C at a cooling rate of 10°C/min and crystallized, a DSC curve during cooling was obtained, and an exothermic amount (He) during crystallization of the stretched film was found from the obtained DSC curve.<br>
The peak height was found as a height from a baseline obtained by connecting a baseline in the vicinity of 65°C to 75°C and a baseline in the vicinity of 240°C to 250°C.<br>
The thickness of the polylactic acid stretched film in accordance with the present invention is usually within a range of 5 to 500 µm, preferably 10 to 100 µm.<br>

Furthermore, the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention desirably has thermal properties such that a peak ratio (peak 10/peak 20) of a peak height (peak 10) of a maximum endothermic peak of endothermic peaks within a range of 150 to 200°C of a DSC curve obtained in the DSC measurements of the composition during second heating (cooling is performed at 10°C/min after 10 min at 250°C and then heating is carried out again at 10°C/min from 0°C) to a peak height (peak 20) of a maximum endothermic peak of endothermic peaks within a range of 205 to 240°C is preferably equal to or less than 0.5, more preferably equal to or less than 0.3, and even more preferably equal to or less than 0.2. This is apparently because this composition has selectively formed stereocomplex crystals.<br>
When the peak ratio (peak 10/peak 20) is larger than 0.5, the amount of individual crystals of PLLA and PDLA after crystallization can be large and kneading of poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid can be insufficient.<br>
Because the composition with the peak ratio (peak 10/peak 20) larger than 0.5 has a large amount of formed a crystals (individual crystals of PLLA or PDLA) after crystallization, the heat resistance can be poor even after stretching.<br>
-11-<br><br>
YuTtheimore, in the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention, an endothermic amount (AHm) of an endothermic peak of 205 to 240°C during second heating in DSC is preferably equal to or greater than 35 J/g.<br>
Thermal melting properties of the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention were found in conformance with JIS K 7121 and JIS K 7122 by using Q100 manufactured by TA Instrument as a DSC (differential scanning calorimeter) and accurately weighing about 5 mg of a sample by a method identical to the above-described method for finding thermal melting properties of the polylactic acid stretched film. Properties during cooling and second heating were found as thermal melting properties of the polylactic acid composition.<br>
The polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention is composed of or prepared with preferably 25 to 75 parts by weight, more preferably 35 to 65 parts by weight, still more preferably 45 to 55 parts by weight, and even more preferably 47 to 53 parts by weight of the aforementioned PLLA and preferably of 75 to 25 parts by weight, more preferably 65 to 35 parts by weight, still more preferably 55 to 45 parts by weight, and even more preferably 53 to 47 parts by weight of PDLA (PLLA + PDLA = 100 parts by weight).<br>
The polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention is desirably prepared by kneading from poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid such that the weight-average molecular weight of either of the poly-L-lactic acid and the poly-D-lactic acid is within a range of 6,000 to 3,000,000 and the weight-average molecular weight of either the poly-L-lactic acid or the poly-D-lactic acid is within a range of 30,000 to 2,000,000.<br>
Furthermore, the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention can be obtained by melt kneading these PLLA and PDLA at 230 to 260°C with a twin-screw extruder, a twin-screw kneader, a Banbury mixer, a blast mill, or the like.<br>
When the composition has a PLLA amount outside the aforementioned range, a film produced by stretching the composition obtained includes α-crystal crystalline substance and can have insufficient heat resistance even when the composition is kneaded by the above-described method.<br>
The polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention excels in heat resistance apparently because the aforementioned composition forms a stereocomplex structure and the stereocomplex structure is composed of equal amounts of PLLA and PDLA.<br>
The temperature during melt kneading of PLLA and PDLA performed for obtaining the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention is preferably 230 to 260°C, more preferably 235 to 255°C. Where the temperature of melt kneading is below 230°C, the stereocomplex structure can be present in an<br>
-12-<br><br>
unmelted state, and where the temperature is higher than 260°C, the polylactic acid can decompose.<br>
Furthermore, it is desirable that PLLA and PDLA be sufficiently melt kneaded during preparation of the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention. The melt kneading time depends on the melt kneader used, but usually may be equal to or longer than 10 min.<br>
In the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention, crystallization of stereocomplexes proceeds rapidly and a region in which stereocomplex crystallization is possible is large. This is apparently why the formation of individual crystals of PLLA or PDLA (a crystals) is difficult.<br>
As mentioned hereinabove, where a peak caused by crystallization (exothermic amount AHc) in DSC measurements (10°C/min) during cooling after 10 min at 250°C is equal to or greater than 20 J/g in the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention, crystallization of the polylactic acid composition will occur rapidly.<br>
Furthermore, where the exothermic amount caused by crystallization is less than 20 J/g, the crystallization rate is low and the kneading can be insufficient.<br>
The weight-average molecular weight of the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention is not particularly limited. However, the polylactic acid composition in accordance with the present invention preferably has a weight-average molecular weight of 10,000 to 1,500,000, more preferably a weight-average molecular weight of 50,000 to 500,000. Where the weight-average molecular weight is outside this range on a high-molecular side, the formation of stereocomplex is insufficient and it is possible that heat resistance will not be attained. Where the weight-average molecular weight is outside this range on a low-molecular side, the strength of a polylactic acid composition layer obtained can be insufficient.<br>
Method for Manufacturing a Polylactic Acid Stretched Film<br>
A polylactic acid stretched film in accordance with the present invention, which excels in heat resistance and transparency, is obtained by using a polylactic acid composition comprising the poIy-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid, extrusion molding, and stretching the film or sheet obtained, preferably by a factor of two or more, more preferably by a factor of 2 to 12, and even more preferably by a factor of 3 to 6 in one direction. The upper limit of stretching factor is not particularly limited, provided that stretching can be performed, but the film is usually ruptured and stable stretching cannot be performed when the stretching factor exceeds 12.<br>
A stretched film (biaxially stretched film) that excels in heat resistance and transparency can be also obtained by stretching a film or sheet obtained by extrusion molding, preferably by a factor of two or more in the longitudinal direction and by a<br>
-13-<br><br>
factor of two or more in the transverse direction, more preferably by a factor of 2 to 7 in the longitudinal direction and by a factor of 2 to 7 in the transverse direction, and even more preferably by a factor of 2.5 to 5 in the longitudinal direction and by a factor of 2.5 to 5 in the transverse direction. The upper limit of stretching factor is not particularly limited, provided that stretching can be performed, but the film is usually ruptured and stable stretching cannot be performed when the stretching factor exceeds 7.<br>
Heat resistance of the polylactic acid stretched film in accordance with the present invention can be further improved by heat treating the film, preferably for 1 sec or longer, more preferably for 3 to 60 sec at a temperature preferably of 140 to 220°C, more preferably 150 to 200°C<br>

Moisture permeability was found in conformance with JIS Z0208. A sample was taken from the film, a bag with a surface area of about 100 cm2 was produced, an appropriate amount of calcium chloride was introduced into the bag, and the bag was sealed. The bag was allowed to stay for three days in an atmosphere at 40°C and 90% RH (relative humidity), and moisture permeability (water vapor permeability) was found from the increase in weight.<br>

A polylactic acid composition was obtained by weighing PLLA-1 and PDLA-2 at a ratio of 50 : 50 (parts by weight), using a twin-screw kneading extruder, and melt kneading at a melt temperature of 250°C for a kneading time of 1 min. Then, a sheet of the polylactic acid composition with a thickness of about 300 µm was obtained with a T-die sheet molding machine.<br>
The twin-screw kneading extruder has a capacity of 40 kg/h, but the extrusion amount thereof is produced in about 10 sec.<br>
Because kneading in such an interval was insufficient, the kneading time was extended to 1 min by reducing the extrusion amount to 7 kg/h.<br>
Thermal melting properties of the polylactic acid composition were measured by the above-described method.<br>
A polylactic acid stretched film was then obtained by stretching the sheet by a factor of three at a stretching temperature of 65°C in the longitudinal direction and stretching by a factor of three at a stretching temperature of 70°C in the transverse direction in a biaxial stretching machine manufactured by Bruckner and performing heat setting for about 40 sec at 180°C in a tenter.

As follows from Table 1, in the thermal melting properties of the biaxially stretched film composed of the polylactic acid composition obtained in Example 1, an endothermic peak (amount of absorbed heat) within a range of 150 to 200°C is very small, an endothermic peak within a range of 205 to 240°C is large, the endothermic amount (AHm) is as large as 66.1 J/g, and the exothermic amount (AHc) during cooling is 49.7 J/g. Furthermore, in the thermal melting properties of the polylactic acid composition (sheet) serving as a base material for the biaxially stretched film, the exothermic amount (AHc) during first cooling is 20.3 J/g, and during second heating, no endothermic peak is observed in a range of 150 to 200°C and the endothermic amount (AHm) of the endothermic peak in a range of 205 to 240°C is 51.0 J/g. Furthermore, the biaxially stretched film composed of the polylactic acid composition obtained in Example 1 excels in transparency and heat resistance, has low moisture permeability and oxygen permeability, has barrier ability, and also has<br>
-19-<br><br>
a peak area (Ssc) in the vicinity of 12 degrees, 21 degrees, and 24 degrees in wide-angle X-ray measurements of 50.9%, that is, more than 20%, based on the entire area and a peak area (SPL) in the vicinity of 20 of 17 degrees and 19 degrees of 0.0%, that is, less than 5%, based on the entire area. Therefore, it is clear that the crystallized portion is a stereocomplex structure and the fraction ratio thereof is large.<br>
By contrast, in the biaxially stretched film composed of PLLA-1 that was obtained in Comparative Example 1, only an endothermic peak of a range of 150 to 200°C is present, no endothermic peak is present in a range of 205 to 240°C, and the exothermic amount (ΔHc) during cooling is 0.4 J/g and less than that of the biaxially stretched film composed of the polylactic acid composition obtained in Example 1. Furthermore, in the thermal melting properties of the PLLA-1 (sheet) serving as a base material for the biaxially stretched film, the exothermic amount (AHc) during first cooling is 0, and during second heating, no endothermic peak is present in a range of 205 to 240°C, only a peak of a range of 150 to 200°C is present, and the endothermic amount (ΔHm) is 32.1 J/g. Furthermore, the biaxially stretched film composed of PLLA-1 obtained in Comparative Example 1 excels in transparency, but has poor heat resistance and barrier capacity and also has a peak area (Ssc) in the vicinity of 12 degrees, 21 degrees, and 24 degrees in wide-angle X-ray measurements of 0.0% based on the entire area and a peak area (SPL) in the vicinity of 20 of 17 degrees and 19 degrees of 57.3% based on the entire area. Therefore, it is clear that the crystallized portion does not include a stereocomplex structure.<br>

As shown in Examples 2 to 6 in Table 2, in all the polylactic acid stretched films in accordance with the present invention, a peak ratio (peak 1/peak 2) of a maximum endothermic peak (peak 1) of endothermic peaks within a range of 150 to 200°C to a maximum endothermic peak (peak 2) of endothermic peaks within a range of 205 to 240°C in DSC measurements is 0.06 to 0.18, that is, less than 0.2, the endothermic amount of endothermic peaks within a range of 205 to 240°C is 45.0 to 62.4 J/g, that is, more than 40 J/g, and the exothermic amount during cooling is 46.1 to 71.4 J/g, that is, more than 40 J/g, and the films excel in heat resistance. Furthermore, it is clear that in order to obtain a polylactic acid stretched film having these thermal melting properties, it is preferred that the exothermic amount during first cooling of the polylactic acid composition be large and that a polylactic acid composition be used in which a peak ratio (peak 10/peak 20) of a maximum endothermic peak (peak 10) of endothermic peaks within a range of 150 to 200°C during second heating to a maximum endothermic peak (peak 20) of endothermic peaks within a range of 205 to 240°C be equal to or less than 0.5.<br>
Furthermore, in Examples 2 to 6, a peak area (Ssc) in the vicinity of 12 degrees, 21 degrees, and 24 degrees in wide-angle X-ray measurements is 24 to 32%, that is, more than 20%, based on the entire area and a peak area (SPL) in the vicinity of 20 of 17 degrees and 19 degrees is 0.0%, that is, less than 5%, based on the entire area. Therefore, it is clear that the crystallized portion is a stereocomplex structure and the fraction ratio thereof is large.<br>
Although the stretched films of Comparative Examples 2 to 5 use poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid having the same mixing ratio as that in Examples 2, 4, 5, and 6, a peak ratio (peak 1/peak 2) of a maximum endothermic peak (peak 1) of endothermic peaks within a range of 150 to 200°C to a maximum endothermic peak (peak 2) of endothermic peaks within a range of 205 to 240°C in DSC measurements is 0.73 to 1.39, that is more than 0.2, and the films have poor heat resistance. Furthermore, a peak ratio (peak 10/peak 20) of a maximum endothermic peak (peak 10) of endothermic peaks within a range of 150 to 200°C during second heating to a maximum endothermic peak (peak 20) of endothermic peaks within a range of 205 to 240°C of a mixture (press sheet) used as a base material for the stretched films of Comparative Examples 2 to 4 is 1.50 to 4.00, that is, above 0.5.<br>
In addition, in Comparative Examples 2 to 5, a peak area (Ssc) in the vicinity of 12 degrees, 21 degrees, and 24 degrees in wide-angle X-ray measurements is 5 to 19%, that is, less than 20%, based on the entire area and a peak area (SPL) in the vicinity of 20 of 17 degrees and 19 degrees is 18%, that is, more than 5% in Comparative Example 2 and 0% in Comparative Examples 3 to 5, based on the entire area. Therefore, it is clear that the crystallized portion was not sufficiently converted into a stereocomplex structure or was converted, but at a small fraction ratio.<br>
-28-<br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The composition in accordance with the present invention has specific thermal properties. This is apparently because a stereocomplex structure is formed selectively and uniformly in a simple manner. For this reason, the present stretched film is superior in heat resistance and toughness and also superior in surface smoothness, transparency, and thermal stability to the conventional molded products such as polylactic acid stretched films.<br>
This is because a stereocomplex structure is selectively formed during crystallization from an amorphous state. Furthermore, with the composition in accordance with the present invention, crystallization treatment can be easily performed.<br>
