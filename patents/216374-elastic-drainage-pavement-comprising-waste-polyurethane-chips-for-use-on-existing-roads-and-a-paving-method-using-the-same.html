				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an elastic drainage pavement comprising<br>
wastc-polyurethane chips for use on existing roads and a paving method using the same.<br>
This pavement uses a binder specially developed to secure the binding between an<br>
upper polyuretbane chip layer and a lower existing pavement layer as well as the<br>
binding among the wastc-polyurcthanc chips, resulting in excellent strength and<br>
durability, and uses recycled waste-polyurethane chips to provide elasticity and draining<br>
property suitable for sports activities, walking, outdoor exercises and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
When a heavy rain falls on conventional existing asphalt or concrete<br>
pavement, the rain docs not sink into the ground, but flows through roadside drainage<br>
system to river, stream, waste water treatment plant or public water area. However/ in :<br>
case of a localized torrential downpour for a short period of time or a heavy rain for a<br>
long period of time during the rainy season, the drained rain and water may overflow :<br>
the river and stream, causing very dangerous and unstable situation. Also, as the rain<br>
and water cannot permeate into the conventional existing road or pavement, it obstructs<br>
safe passage and causes a lot of inconvenience to pedestrians.<br>
Therefore, in order to overcome such disadvantages of the eopyentipnal<br>
asphalt or concrete pavement, a permeable concrete pavement comprising aggregates of<br>
the size generally less than 13 mm to maintain suitable porosity and strength, and <br>
allowing water to seep into the ground through a surface layer and a base layer of the <br>
pavement has been suggested and used. <br>
Specifically, the permeable concrete allows rain or water to seep into the; <br>
ground through pores among the aggregates, fostering the growth of trees and plains, <br>
and also prevents flooding of the river by allowing heavy or torrential rain to flow under <br>
tho earth. Further, as the rain or water does not stay on the permeable concrete <br>
pavement, it provides less slippery and much safer walking, jogging or driving <br>
conditions. <br><br>
For these reasons, the permeable concrete pavement has come into use. more <br><br>
widely, especially on trails at parks, bicycle paths, tracks for in-line skating, golf-course<br>
trails, etc. <br><br>
Conventional permeable pavements are divided into permeable asphalt <br>
concrete and permeable cement concrete. However, the asphalt concrete has <br>
disadvantages in that the surface deforms considerably due to high temperatures during <br>
the summer season and the pores get clogged up due to the viscosity of the asphalt. Also, <br>
the cement concrete is so rigid that people get hurt when they fall on it. <br>
In addition, the conventional permeable-concrete pavement is covered with <br>
epoxy pigments for cosmetic view of the surface, but a ramp covered with, such epoxy <br>
pigments is more slippery than a normal concrete pavement, which causes problems in<br>
safety.<br>
Further, because the surface of the concrete pavement is rugged, the surface <br>
can peel or break off and when the pores are covered with dust, the pavement"s <br>
permeability deteriorates, requiring additional maintenance costs for declogging the <br>
pores, i.e. removal of the dust.<br>
As an example to improve the di sadvantages of the conventional permeable<br>
concrete, Korean Patent No. 404679 (patented on October 27,2003 entitled "pavement<br>
using waste tire chips") discloses an clastic permeable pavement which comprises a<br>
land layer, a filter layer, a rubble layer, a permeable concrete layer, a<br>
waste-polyurethane chip layer, and a surface layer from the bottorn to the top.<br>
Specifically, the filter layer is constructed by spreading small aggregates (sand), and the<br>
rubble layer is constructed by pouring and hardening concrete rubbles of the patticlo<br>
size 25mm or less onto the filter layer. The permeable concrete layer is made by<br>
blending aggregates of the particle size 5-13mm, cement and admixture products with<br>
water, and pouring this mixture on the rubble layer and curing it. As a result, the <br>
permeable concrete layer has the compresaivc strength of 100 kg/cm2 or more and the<br>
permeability coefficient of 1x1O-3 cm/soc or more. Further, the waste_tire chip layer is<br>
formed by pouring and spreading in the thickness of 10-20mm a inixturo including ,<br>
waste-tire chips of particle size 2.5-7mm; a binder comprising 10-25g of urcthane rosin,<br>
epoxy resin or acrylic resin based on lOOg of the waste tixe chipsj, and l-4g of an<br>
inorganic pigment on the same base. Furthermore, the surface layer is colored by<br>
spraying with the urethane resin, cpoxy resin or acrylic resin on the waste-tire chip<br>
layer.<br>
The olastic permeable pavement as disclosed in the, above, patent allows rain<br>
or water to penetrate into the ground, and the pavement is resistant to slipping and<br>
reduces diffused light-reflection resulted from the water staying on. tho pavement, thus<br>
securing safe passage of pedestrians and providing comfortable vision. Also, as using<br>
waste tires which have been one of the environmental pollutants, the pavement not only<br>
absorbs impact on foot, but also contributes to the protection of environment and <br>
recycling of resources. <br>
However, since the waste tire"s smell of rubber lasted for a, long time, the<br>
pavement using the waste tire could not provide a pleasant sense of smell. Further, since<br>
the urothane, opoxy and acrylic resin binders used in the above patent were those<br>
available in the market, there have been demands for a special binder which enhances<br>
the adhesive strength among pavement materials and maintains the strength and <br>
durability of the pavement for a long time.<br>
Further, since the clastic permeable pavement in the above patent used a <br>
method of piling up the land layer, the filter layer, the rubble layer, the permeable<br>
concrete layer, the waste-polyurethane chip layer and the surface layer from the bottorn,<br>
in a case where it was not necessary to dig open an existing pavement to newly pavp it <br>
again, or in a case where there was no sufficient budget for such a pavement, such a<br>
pavement construction method of piling up the layers would not be economical in terms<br>
of process, time and cost.<br>
Instpad, although the existing pavement is not permeable, if it is covered<br>
with a permeable pavement so that the rain can pass through the permeable pavement<br>
and drain, it would not only be possible to prevent the overflow of the rivor or stream, :<br>
but also be very economical since the existing pavement can be used as it is.<br>
Therefore, the inventor of the present invention studied and researched into<br>
materials and binders for the elastic permeable pavement, and as a result, the inventor<br>
completed the present invention by using waste-polyurethane chips in place of waste-<br>
tire chips as a main component of the elastic pavement and developing a binder to<br>
secure the binding between an upper polyurethane-chip layer and a lower existing-<br>
pavement layer as well as the binding among the waste-polyurethanc chips.<br>
I<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an plastic drainage<br>
pavement, which uses waste-polyurethane chips obtained from soles of shoes, parts of<br>
toys, parts of refrigerators, parts of vehicles, and decrepit recycled-polyuretbane<br>
resilient pavement to solve the smelling problem of waste tires, nurse resources and<br>
prevent environmental pollution, and which is elastic and permeable to provide corn fort<br>
and shock absorption in walking as well.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an elastic drainage "<br>
pavement and its paving method, which, uses a binder specially developed to secure, the<br>
binding between an upper waste-polyurothanc chip layer and a lower exisring-pavement<br>
layer as well as the binding among the waste-polyurethane chips, resulting in excellent<br>
strength and durability.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an clastic drainage<br>
pavement for use on existing roads and its paving method, which comprises forming a<br>
permeable wastc-polyurcthanc chip layer on the existing pavement, to provide<br>
comfortablo vision due to the reduction of diffused light-reflection caused by water<br>
staying on the pavement, and to provide safer walking jogging or driving conditions,<br>
and also to prevent flooding of the river or stream due to heavy rain.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an elastic drainage<br>
pavement and its paving method, which is economical by using the existing pavement <br>
as it is. <br>
In order to achieve the above objects, the elastic drainage pavement for use<br>
on existing pavements according to the present invention comprises a primer layer<br>
which is spread on the existing pavement and comprises 10-20 % by weight of PPG<br>
(polypropylene glycol), 5-10 % by weight of TMP (trimethylol propane), 5-10 % by<br>
weight of 1,3-BG (1,3-butylene glycol), 15-25 % by weight of TDI (toluene<br>
diisocyanate), 49-64.9 % by weight of a solvent (xylene or methylethylketone), and<br>
0.1-1.0% by weight of an additive (defoaming agent); which is a combination of 1% by weight<br>
of polysiloxane solution and 99% by weight of diisobutylketone and an elastic drainage layer<br>
binder in the weight ratio of 3:1 to 4:1, the waste-polyurethane chips having the size of<br>
1 to 5 mm and the binder comprising 50-70 % by weight of PPG, 5-10 % by weight of<br>
PBG (polybutadiene glycol), 3-5 % by weight of 1,3-BG, 20-30 % by weight of MDI<br>
(methylene diisocyanate) and 2-5 % by weight of TDI.<br>
In addition, according to the present invention, a method of paving the<br>
elastic drainage pavement on existing pavement is provided, which comprises cleaning<br>
the existing pavement; paving it with a primer layer and then an elastic drainage layer,<br>
wherein the primer layer comprises 10-20 % by weight of PPG, 5-10 % by<br>
weight of TMP, 5-10 % by weight of 1,3-BG, 15-25 % by weight of TDI, 49-64.9 % by<br>
weight of a solvent (xylene or methylethylketone), and 0.1-1.0 % by weight of an<br>
additive (defoaming agent),<br>
and the elastic drainage layer is prepared by mixing waste-polyurethane<br>
chips and a binder in the weight ratio of 3:1 to 4:1 and pouring the mixture onto the<br>
primer layer in situ, the waste-polyurethane chips having the size of 1 to 5 mm and the<br>
. binder comprising 50-70 % by weight of PPG, 5-10 % by weight of PBG, 3-5 % by<br>
weight of 1,3-BG, 20-30 % by weight of MDI and 2-5 % by weight of TDI;<br>
pressing with a roller of 20-30 kg heated to temperatures of 50-80 °C and<br>
trowelling the elastic drainage layer in the same temperature; and then<br>
curing for about 5 to 24 hours.<br>
The waste-polyurethane chips used in the present invention are obtained by<br>
collecting waste-polyurethane scraps from soles of shoes, parts of toys, parts of<br>
refrigerators and vehicles, decrepit polyurethane resilient pavement, etc. and separating<br>
the scraps according to their colors; removing impurities attached on the scraps;<br>
pulverizing the waste-polyurethane scraps in a predetermined size; mixing the scraps<br>
with 0.3-1.0kg of stearic acid, 20-30kg of heavy calcium carbonate, 0.1-2.0kg of<br>
titanium dioxide as a decolorant and white pigment and 5kg or less of a pigment, based<br>
on 100kg of the pulverized waste-polyurethane scraps by stirring; heating and extruding<br>
the mixture; and then condensing and cutting the extruded mixture into a predetermined<br>
size.<br>
In the present invention, a photoluminescent pigment, which emits light at<br>
night or darkness in case of rain by using the energy that has been accumulated during<br>
the daytime, can be used as the pigment, and zinc sulfide compounds can be used for<br>
this purpose. In this case, the amount of the photoluminescent pigment used is 20-40%<br>
by weight of the scraps.<br>
For instance, waste-polyurethane chips made by using the photoluminescent<br>
pigment can be prepared separately from the chips made by using a normal pigment for<br>
example iron oxide as red pigment, chromium oxide as green pigment and phthalocyanine<br>
as organic pigment, in a predetermined ratio, and they can be mixed with the binder<br>
respectively at a construction site, so that they be distributed and spread in their respective<br>
positions that have been designed previously.<br>
If a flame retarding property is required in preparing the waste-polyurethane chips, a flame<br>
retardant such as melamine polyphosphate (MPP) in the range of 1-2% by weight of the scraps can<br>
be added to the mixture.<br>
Further, depending on usages of the elastic drainage pavement, a foaming agent such as<br>
sodium hydrogen carbonate can be used to adjust the hardness of the waste-polyurethane chips. For<br>
example, the waste-polyurethane chips made by using a relatively large amount of the foaming<br>
agent can be used for sidewalks and trails, while the relatively hard polyurethane chips<br>
made by using less amount of the foaming agent can be used for bicycle paths and<br>
tracks for in-line skating.<br>
The size of the waste-polyurethane chips can vary according to their usage,<br>
e.g., in l-2mm, 2-3mm, 3-4mm, l-5mm, etc. Smaller ones can be used for bicycle paths<br>
and tracks for in-line skating, and larger ones for sidewalks and trails. In particular, the<br>
polyurethane chips for trails maybe formed in part or entirely in the shape of a strand<br>
having the length of 10-30mm and the thickness of 1-3mm, so that the chips can form<br>
large pores, providing more cushion and enhancing the permeability.<br>
The waste-polyurethane chips in the elastic drainage layer can be replaced<br>
in part or entirely with new polyurethane chips. The new polyurethane chips are<br>
prepared by mixing 1 part by weight of liquid polyurethane with 0.5-1.2 parts by weight<br>
of heavy calcium carbonate, and 0.01 part by weight or less of a pigment or 0.1-0.4<br>
parts by weight of a photo luminescent pigment by stirring; pouring the mixture into a<br>
mold and curing in a sheet form; and then cutting and pulverizing the polyurethane<br>
sheet into a predetermined size. The new polyurethane chips manufactured as such are<br>
very clear in color.<br>
In addition, the binder used in the present invention is to secure the binding<br>
between the clastic drainage layer and the existing pavement and also among the<br>
waste-polyurethane chips in tho elastic drainage layer. Usually, compounds having <br>
molecular weight of 1,000-5,000 and having moro than two hydroxy groups (-OH) or<br>
multi-functionalisocyanate compounds (-NCO) arc used as the binder.<br>
For cxamplo, TDI and MDI are used as the chip binders. However, the<br>
adhesive property and the coefficient of expansion of the binders arc variable depending<br>
on thoir molar ratio. Therefore, the inventor of the present invention developed a binder <br>
suitable for achieving the objects of the invention and having the elasticity and the <br>
coefficient of expansion similar to those of the polyurethane chips to provide an<br>
excellent adhesive property among the chips. This specially developed binder according<br>
to the present invention comprises 50-70 % by weight of PPG, 5-1Q % by weight of<br>
PBG, 3-5 % by weight of 1,3-BG, 20-30 % by weight of MDI and 2-5 % by weight of <br>
TDI, wherein PPG is to provide toughness and 1,3-BG is used as a chain extender to<br>
form a polymer having higher molecular weight than a simple compound produced, by<br>
the reaction between PPG and MDI, The binder of the present invention, therefore, docs<br>
not only have a high adhesiveness and coefficient of expansion, but also has tensile <br>
strength and pliability from a primary reaction with MDI and a secondary reaction with<br>
TDI.<br>
It is preferable that tho polyurethane chips and the binder arc blended in the ,<br>
weight ratio of 3:1 to 4:1. This is because use of the binder less than 20% by weight<br>
results in poor adhesivo property, and use of more than 40% causes the, pores to be<br>
clogged or the binder to be blown up during the curing step, <br>
Further, the composition and tho composition ratio of the primer layer are<br>
the optimum values that have been obtained by tho inventor as a result of a long time <br>
research.<br><br>
The clastic drainage pavement according to the present invention is<br><br>
economical since it can be applied upon the existing street or pavement without<br>
scratching or digging out the existing pavement. It is only necessary to clean up the<br>
existing pavement by removing impurities thcrofrom, since the existence of such <br>
impurities may be an obstacle to the primer layer"s adhering to the existing payement. If<br>
the existing pavement is made up of tiles having smooth surface, it is preferable to use a<br>
strong cpoxy or grind the surface before coating the primer layer.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The principal of the present invention will be described in more detail below<br>
with reference to the embodiments, but the scope of the invention is not limited within<br>
the embodiments.<br>
1. Preparation of wasto-polyurothano chips <br>
As a preliminary step, waste-polyurethane scraps were collected from spies<br>
of shoes, parts of toys, parts of refrigerators and vehicles, decrepit pplyurethane reslient<br>
pavement, etc., and separated according to their colors. From the separated<br>
waste-polyurethanc scraps, impurities stuck thereto were removed by cutting.<br>
Then, the waste-polyurethane scraps were pulverized in a crusher into the <br>
particle diameter of3-30mm, and transported to a mixer.<br>
Based on 100kg of the pulverized wastc-polyurethanc scraps, 0.5kg of<br>
stcaric acid, 25kg of heavy calcium carbonate, 0.2kg of tianium dioxide and 1,5kg of a<br>
pigment were added and mixed by stirring. <br>
Then, the mixture was transported through a conveyor to an extruder where<br>
the mixture was extruded in the form of a plate.<br>
The extruded waste-polyurethane was passed to a second crusher and a<br>
cutter to be cut in the particle size of l-5mm, resulting in the production of<br>
waste-polyurethane chips.<br>
In this embodiment, if the flame retarding property is required, a flame <br>
rctardant in the range of 1-2% by weight of the scraps can be added to the mixture.<br>
2. Preparation of binder<br>
30kg of PPG and 5kg of PBG were prepared as polyol cpmpounds. Also,<br>
13kg of MDI and 2kg of TDI as multi-functional isocyanate compounds and 2kg of<br>
1,3-BG as a chain extender were prepared.<br>
The above compounds were mixed with an accelerator and reacted to<br>
produce a binder having the following physical properties;<br>
Tensile strength (kg/cnf) 10 ±5 <br>
Tear strength (kg/cm) 7±3<br><br>
3. Site preparation;<br>
(1) The existing pavement was cleaned up and impurities thereon were removed.<br>
(2) In order to pave the elastic drainage pavement on the existing tiles, the smooth<br>
surface of the tiles was grounded. <br>
4. Primer layer <br>
A primer composition prepared by mixing 5kg of PPG, 3kg of TMP, 2kg of<br>
1,3-BG, 7kg of TDI, 17kg of xylene as a solvent and 0.3kg of a defoaming agent was<br>
spread on the existing pavement and the tiles as prepared above.<br>
5. Elastic drainage pavement<br>
[Embodiment 1] <br>
100kg of the waste-polyurethane chips having the si ze of 1 to 3mm and <br>
30kg of the binder were blcndod in situ,<br>
This mixture was poured onto the primer layer which has been spread on the<br>
existing pavement or the tiles in the thickness of 10-20mm, and the spread mixture was <br>
pressed with a roller of 30 kg which has been heated to temperatures of abput 80C and <br>
trowelled at the same temperature.<br>
Then, the pavement was cured for about 24 hours, during which the <br>
construction site was closed to traffic.<br>
The clastic drainage pavement obtained as such had the strength and<br>
elasticity suitable for bicycle paths and tracks for in-line skating. <br>
Change of pigments of the waste-polyurcthane chips made it possible to<br>
diversify the appearance of the elastic drainage pavement by having various colors and<br>
shapes. <br>
[Embodiment 2] <br><br>
In order to form an elastic drainage pavement suitable for walking, the<br>
waste-polyurcthanc chips having the size of 3 to 5mm on aycrage and those having the<br>
length of 15mm and the thickness of 1 mm in a strand shapp were prepared and<br>
respectively blended with the binder in the ratio of 3; 1.. The mixture was proceeded in<br>
the same manner as in Embodiment 1.<br>
As a result, the elastic drainage pavement suitable fpr walking was obtained,<br>
and this pavement had pores larger than that produced in Embodiment 1 and was softer<br>
and more effective in drainage. <br>
[Embodiment 3]<br>
In this embodiment, the waste-polyurethane chips having the size of 3 to<br>
5mm on average were prepared by using a normal pigment and the chips having the<br>
same size were separately prepared by using a photoluminescent pigment ,(zinc sulfide),<br>
each of which were then blended with the binder in the ratio of 3:1 in situ, <br>
The waste-polyurcthane chip mixture using the normal pigment was poured <br>
in the thickness of 10-20mm outside of a frame, e.g. a star shape frame, which has been<br>
preliminarily placed on. the primer layer, and the waster-polyurothane chip mixture using<br>
I<br>
the photoluminesccnt pigment was poured inside of the frame, Then, tho both poured<br>
chips were pressed with a roller of 30 kg heated to temperatures of about 800C and<br>
trowelled at the same temperature.<br>
As a result, the elastic drainage pavement obtained on. the existing pavement<br>
had the strength and optimum elasticity suitable for trails, and the pavement obtained on<br>
the existing tiles had the strength and elasticity suitable for walking and for other<br>
various usages. <br>
Further, as the photoluminescent polyurethanc chips could be disposed in<br>
various constellations, the chips emit light in the evening or at night (darkness),<br>
providing visual pleasure for pedestrians and helping students or children to study<br>
constellations. <br>
[Embodiment 4] <br>
50kg of the waste-polyurethane chips obtained from the above Embodiment<br>
1 was used together with 50kg of polyurethane chips prepared by using new<br><br>
polyutethanc material to be blended with the binder.<br>
The urethanc chips using the new polyurethanc material were prepared by<br>
mixing 50kg of liquid polyurcthane with 35kg of heavy calcium carbonate arid 0,5kg of <br>
a pigment in a high-speed stirrer of more than lOOOrpm, pouring and curing the mixture<br>
in a frame in the shape of a plate, and then pulverizing the cured, mixture into the<br>
particle size of 3-5mm.<br>
The other procedures were the same as in Embodiment 1, and as &amp; result the i<br>
elastic drainage pavement in much clearer color was .obtained.<br>
As described above, the elastic drainage pavement according to the present<br>
invention, which uses wastc-polyurethane chips obtained from soles of shoes, parts of<br>
toys, parts of refrigerators and vehicles and decrepit recyclcd-polyurethane resilient<br>
pavement, solves tho smelling problem of wasto tires, nurses resources and prevents<br>
environmental pollution. The drainage pavement is also elastic and permeable so that it<br>
can provide comfort and shock absorption in walking.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, the clastic drainage pavement <br>
and its paving method use the binder specially developed to secure the binding between <br>
the polyurethane-chip layer and the existing-pavement layer as well as the binding<br>
among the waste-polyurcthane chips, resulting in excellent strength and durability.<br>
Furthermore, the clastic drainage pavement for use on existing roads <br>
according to the present invention, which comprises forming a permeable <br>
wastc-polyurcthane chip layer on the existing pavement, provides comfortable vision<br>
due to the reduction of diffused light-reflection resulted from the water staying on the <br>
pavement and provides safer walking, jogging or driving conditions. Also, the pavement <br>
prevents flooding of the river or stream due to heavy rain. <br><br>
In addition, the present invention provides clastic drainage pavement and its<br>
paving method, which is economical by using the existing pavement as it is.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and<br><br>
scope of the invention. The present invention covers the modifications and variations <br><br>
thereof provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their<br><br>
