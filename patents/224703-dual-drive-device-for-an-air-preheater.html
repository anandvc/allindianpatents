				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a Dual Drive system for Rotary Regenerative<br>
Airpreheaters. The present invention particularly relates to Rotary Regenerative<br>
heat exchangers generally used as Airpreheaters and more particularly relates to<br>
a novel Dual Drive device for the Airpreheater to avoid the stoppage of<br>
Airpreheater due to failure of the main Rotor Drive system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rotary Regenerative Airpreheaters are used in Thermal power stations/Industrial<br>
applications to transfer the heat from the flue gas leaving boiler/furnace to the<br>
combustion air entering through regenerative heat transfer surface in a rotor, the<br>
heat transfer surface continuously turning through the air and gas streams.<br>
The rotor is divided into compartments by a number of radially extending plates<br>
referred to as diaphragms. These compartments are adapted to hold modular<br>
heat exchange baskets which contain the mass of heat absorbent material<br>
commonly formed of stacked plate-like elements.<br>
In a typical Rotary Regenerative heat exchanger, the hot flue gas and the<br>
combustion air enter the rotor shell from opposite ends and pass in opposite<br>
directions over the heat exchange material housed within the rotor.<br>
Consequently, the cold air inlet and the cooled gas outlet are at one end of the<br>
heat exchanger, referred to as the cold end, and the hot gas inlet and the heated<br>
air outlet are at the opposite end of the heat exchanger, referred to as the hot<br>
end.<br>
The Airpreheater is divided into a flue gas sector and a<br>
plurality of combustion air sectors formed by sector plates.<br>
Flexible radial seals on the rotor, usually mounted on the top<br>
and bottom edges of the diaphragms, disposed in close proximity<br>
to the sector plates and minimize leakage of gas and air between<br>
the sectors, thereby separating the air and the flue gas streams<br>
from each other. Likewise a rotor shell is mounted to the<br>
outboard end of the diaphragms, forming the periphery of the<br>
rotor, which prevents the air and gas streams from flowing<br>
through the peripheral ends of the sectors and bypassing the heat<br>
transfer surface. Circumferential seals seal the gap between the<br>
rotor and the rotor housing to prevent bypass flow through the<br>
annulus formed between the rotor and the rotor housing.<br>
The Rotary Regenerative Airpreheater consists of Rotor assembly,<br>
Rotor drive, support Bearing assembly, Guide Bearing assembly,<br>
Connecting plates and Rotor housing. The housing surrounding the<br>
rotor is provided with duct connections at both ends and<br>
adequately sealed by radial and axial sealing members.<br>
Regenerative Airpreheater is rotated by the drive system. The<br>
drive system consists of an Electric motor, an Air Motor, a<br>
Speed reducer, a Pinion, a Fluid coupling and a Bibby coupling.<br>
The driving force for 'turning the rotor' is applied at its<br>
periphery. A pinion attached to the low speed shaft of a power<br>
driven speed reducer engages a pin rack mounted on the rotor<br>
shell. The Auxiliary drive motor (Air Motor) is operated as and<br>
when the electric power supply to the electric motor gets failed.<br>
This ensures the continuous opeation of the Airpreheater. The<br>
Auxiliary drive motor also used to operate the rotor during water<br>
washing of the heating surface. The speed reducer is provided<br>
with an auxiliary high speed shaft extension, thus permitting the<br>
installation of the auxiliary drive motor at any time. If any<br>
one of the components fails during the operation, then the<br>
Airpreheater is to be stopped to rectify the problem in the drive<br>
system. Due to the stoppage of one Airpreheater, the Boiler load<br>
will come down. To overcome the above disadvantage of stoppage<br>
of Airpreheater, it is necessary to provide dual drive device, so<br>
that the other drive can be engaged to operate the Airpreheater<br>
with out stopping. Thus, the problem of rectification of a failed<br>
component can be undertaken without stoppage of the Airpreheater.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
dual drive device for an Airpreheater which eliminates all the<br>
disadvantages of the psrior art Rotor Drive system in the<br>
Airpreheaters.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a dual drive device<br>
for an Airpreheater which does not require stoppage of the<br>
Airpreheater to rectify the defects due to failure in the drive<br>
system.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a dual drive<br>
device for an Airpreheater which is easy to maintain.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a dual<br>
drive device for an Airpreheater which reduces the down time of<br>
the Boiler.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
 Accordingly there is provided a Dual drive device for an<br>
Airpreheater comprising a speed reducer having a base, at least<br>
two input shafts eccentrically disposed, and an output shaft, the<br>
base being mounted on the Airpreheater rotary housing an electric<br>
motor coupled to one end of the input shaft via a fluid coupling an<br>
air motor coupled to the other end of the input shaft via a Bibby coupling; a<br>
pinion rack rigidly fixed on the rotor of the Airpreheater; a pinion centrally<br>
mounted on the output shaft of the speed reducer adaptable to engage or<br>
disengage with the pinion rack. A sliding means comprising atleast one crank<br>
mounted on the base, is provided which accommodates the output shaft such<br>
that a rotation of the crank causes forward or backward movement of the speed<br>
reducer in reference to the Airpreheater thereby allowing engagement or<br>
disengagement of the pinion with the pinion rack. Thus, in the present invention<br>
two separate drive means are installed for one Airpreheater. Only one drive<br>
means is engaged at a time for operation of the Airpreheater. If any problem<br>
arise in the drive means, then the drive means can be disengaged from the rotor<br>
for maintenance. Simultaneously, the other drive means can be engaged for<br>
operation of the Airpreheater, thereby stoppage of the Airpreheater can be<br>
avoided and the down time of the boiler reduced.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURE<br>
Figure 1 - Shows a dual drive device in an Airpreheater according to the<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
According to present invention, the Regenerative Airpreheater have two separate<br>
drive means. One drive means is operated at a time. The other drive means is<br>
kept stand by. The Regenerative Airpreheater is rotated by the drive device. The<br>
drive device consists of an Electric motor, Air motor, Speed reducer, Pinion,<br>
Reducer base, Sliding means, Fluid coupling and Bibby coupling.<br>
As illustrated in figure 1, the constructive features of the Dual drive device is that<br>
a speed reducer (03) has two input shaft and one output shaft and is mounted<br>
on a sliding means (09). The sliding means (09) consists of screw, slides and<br>
crank (10) being mounted on a base (08) of the speed reducer. An electric motor<br>
(01) is coupled with the input shaft of the reducer at one end via a Fluid coupling<br>
(02). Similarly, an air motor (07) is coupled with the input shaft of the reducer at<br>
other end via a Bibby coupling (06). A pinion (05) is mounted on an output shaft<br>
of the speed reducer and is engaged with a pin rack (04) in a rotor shell during<br>
operation of the Airpreheater. The pinion (05) is covered with a pinion cover to<br>
avoid settling of the ash particles on the pinion and to avoid the leakage of air<br>
through the pin rack (04) from the Airpreheater. The reducer base (08) is fixed<br>
on a housing of the Airpreheater rotor. By rotating the crank (10) in the sliding<br>
means (09), the speed reducer (03) can be moved from / towards the<br>
Airpreheater for disengagement / engagement between the pinion (05) and the<br>
pin rack (04). The typical Dual Drive device is shown in the accompanying<br>
drawing.<br>
