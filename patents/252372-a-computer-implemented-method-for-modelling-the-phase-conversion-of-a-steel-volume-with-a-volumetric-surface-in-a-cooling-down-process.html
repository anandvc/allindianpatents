Description<br>
Computer-assisted modelling method for the behavior of a steel<br>
volume having a volumetric surface<br>
The present invention relates to a computer-assisted modelling<br>
method for the behavior of a steel volume having a volumetric<br>
surface,<br>
in which a computer, based on an instantaneous initial<br>
state of the steel volume and at least one instantaneous<br>
influence quantity operating via the volumetric surface on<br>
the steel volume, by resolving an equation of thermal<br>
conduction and a phase change equation, determines a subsequent state of the steel volume,<br>
in which the at least one influence quantity comprises at<br>
least one local influence in each case for a number of<br>
surface elements of the volumetric surface and the local<br>
influences operate via the relevant surface element on the<br>
steel volume,<br>
in which the initial state and the subsequent state for a<br>
number of volume elements of the steel volume each comprise<br>
local elements of modelled phases of the steel and a<br>
quantity describing the local energy content of the steel,<br>
in which the modelled phases of the steel comprise<br>
austenite and a first further phase into which austenite<br>
can be changed and which can be changed into austenite.<br>
 This type of mode]ling method is known for example from DE-A-<br>
101 29 565. In this publication in particular an attempt was<br>
made tor the first time to resolve the Fourier thermal<br>
conductivity equation itself and not to resolve an incorrect<br>
variation of this thermal conductivity equation, in order to<br>
correctly describe the thermodynamic behavior of a steel band.<br>
This publication is thus included by reference it in the<br><br>
disclosed content of the present invention.<br>
Such a modelling method is also described in the older German<br>
Patent Application 102 51 716.9 not published at the time of<br>
the present application. With this modelling method an attempt<br>
is made to model the phase conversion of the steel on the<br>
basis of the Gibbs free enthalpies of the steel. This<br>
publication too is thus included by reference to it in the<br>
disclosed content of the present invention.<br>
This type of modelling method is also known from the paper<br>
"Numerische Simulation der Warmeleitung in Stahlblechen -<br>
Mathematik hilft bei der Steuerung von Kiihlstrecken"<br>
(numerical simulation of thermal conductivity in steel sheets<br>
- mathematics helps in the control of cooling lines) by W.<br>
Borchers et al., published in the University periodical of the<br>
Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg, Volume 102,<br>
October 2001, 27th year.<br>
Finally traditional approaches in accordance with the Scheilen<br>
rule, according to Johnson-Mehl-Avrami and Brimacombe, are<br>
known.<br>
The exact modelling of the temperature curve of steel over<br>
time during cooling down, especially of steel bands, is<br>
decisive for the control of the required water or coolant<br>
amounts of a cooling line for steel. This is because the<br>
transformation of the steel which occurs during cooling down<br>
decisively influences the thermal behavior of the steel as it<br>
cools down. Major material properties of the steel are also<br>
influenced by the cooling down process. Since the cooling down<br>
does not occur in thermal equilibrium however, it is not<br>
possible to describe the transformation simply by suitable<br>
adaptation of the thermal capacity. Thus an exact modelling of<br>
the phase change of the steel is also required in order to<br><br>
enable the cooling line to be controlled correctly.<br>
In practice the traditional approaches of the prior art do not<br>
operate without errors in all cases. In particular they<br>
exhibit a series of systematic disadvantages. First of all<br>
separate parameters must be set for each material.<br>
Interpolations between different materials are not possible or<br>
at least only possible to a restricted extent. Secondly only<br>
two phases are considered in the traditional method of the<br>
prior art. An expansion to more than two phases is not<br>
possible for system reasons. Thirdly the traditional prior art<br>
methods only deliver a good match between model and reality<br>
for a complete change of the metal observed. Fourthly the<br>
traditional prior art methods do not provided any information<br>
about the heat released during the phase change. The knowledge<br>
of the phase change heat is however an absolute necessity for<br>
a correct solution of the thermal conduction equation.<br>
The methodologies according to DE-A-101 29 565 and the<br>
technical paper "Numerische Simulation ..." already represent<br>
a significant advance by comparison with such methods, since<br>
they at least describe the thermal conduction completely<br>
correctly. The older German Patent Application additionally<br>
improves the modelling of the phase change. In particular it<br>
supplies the change heat which occurs during the phase change.<br>
However these methods are also not capable of improvement.<br>
The object of the present invention is to create a modelling<br>
method for a metal which delivers better modelling results.<br>
The object is achieved,<br>
by the initial state and the subsequent state for at least<br>
one of the volume elements also including a local<br>
concentration distribution of at least one mobile alloy<br>
element in the steel,<br><br>
within the context of the change equation it is determined<br>
for at least one volume element which concentrations of the<br>
at least one mobile alloy element are present on both sides<br>
of a first phase boundary between austenite and the first<br>
further phase,<br>
by resolving a first Stefan problem it is determined whether<br>
and how the concentration in distribution of the at least<br>
one mobile alloy element changes in the austenite zone of<br>
the volume element concerned and whether and by what<br>
proportion the first phase boundary is thereby displaced,<br>
and<br>
the local proportions of the phases are determined on the<br>
basis of a position of the first phase boundary specified by<br>
the extent of the shift of the first phase boundary.<br>
The mobile alloy element in steel is as a rule carbon. As an<br>
alternative or in addition however it is also possible for the<br>
alloy element to be nitrogen. It can also be another alloy<br>
element which is preferably arranged in steel at intermediate<br>
grid locations.<br>
This modelling method already allows a clear advance compared<br>
to the known prior art. This is because, with this process -<br>
depending on whether the further phase is ferrite or cementite<br>
- the change behavior of austenite into ferrite or austenite<br>
into cementite and vice versa can be modelled very<br>
realistically.<br>
Preferably the modelled phases of the steel also comprise a<br>
second further phase into which austenite can be converted and<br>
which can be converted into austenite. This is because it is<br>
then especia11y possible,<br>
that, for the volume element considered, it is also<br>
determined within the context of the change equation which<br><br>
concentrations of the at least one mobile alloy element are<br>
present on both sides of a second phase boundary between<br>
austenite and the second further phase,<br>
through additionally resolving a second Stefan problem it is<br>
determined whether and how the concentration distribution of<br>
the at least one mobile alloy element changes in the<br>
austenitic zone of the volume element considered and whether<br>
and by what extent the second phase boundary' is thereby<br>
displaced,<br>
the Stefan problems are coupled to each other,<br>
square measures are assigned to the phase boundaries,<br>
a proportion of the square measure assigned to the second<br>
phase boundary of the total of the square measures is<br>
determined and<br>
the local proportions of the phases also depend on the<br>
proportion of the square measure of the total of the square<br>
measures assigned to the second phase boundary.<br>
With this method not only can the change between austenite on<br>
the one side and ferrite or cementite on the other be<br>
described very realistically, but especially also the change<br>
of austenite into perlite and vice versa. This means that<br>
total significant change behaviors of steel in the fixed state<br>
can be described correctly. Furthermore this procedure makes<br>
it possible to establish whether perlite is formed or not.<br>
The proportion of the square measure of the total of the<br>
square measures assigned to the second phase boundary can be<br>
determined by the phase boundaries always remaining arranged<br>
next to each other. Alternatively it is however also possible<br>
to adjust this proportion such that the phase boundaries tend<br>
towards each other. On the basis of this proportion it can<br>
then also be deduced whether austenite only changes in the<br>
first further phase, only in the second further phase or both<br><br>
into the first and also into the second further phase.<br>
In principle it is also possible to determine the embodiment<br>
of the first phase boundary three-dimensionally. However this<br>
demands a significant computing effort. Preferably the<br>
computation is thus undertaken one-dimensionally. This is<br>
possible more simply if the volume element is a space-filling<br>
Aristotle body, especially a cuboid It is also preferable,<br>
for the observed volume element to be embodied as a cuboid<br>
and to have three' basic dimensions,<br>
for the first phase boundary to be embodied as a rectangle<br>
with a first longitudinal side and a first transverse side<br>
and<br>
for the first longitudinal side- to correspond to the first<br>
of the basic dimensions, for the first transverse side to<br>
run in parallel to a second of the basic dimensions and for<br>
displacements of the first phase boundary to occur in<br>
parallel to the third of the basic dimensions.<br>
If the second further phase is also taken into account then<br>
the following applies,<br>
that the second phase boundary is embodied as a rectangle<br>
with a second longitudinal side and a second transverse side<br>
and<br>
that the second longitudinal side corresponds to the first<br>
of the basic dimensions, the second transverse side runs in<br>
parallel to the second of the basic dimensions and<br>
displacements of the second phase boundary occur in parallel<br>
to the third of the basic dimensions.<br>
If the sum of the transverse sides of the phase boundaries is<br>
approximately equal to 1.5 to 3 times a critical lamella<br>
spacing in which an energy balance which on the on hand takes<br>
account of the phase changes of the steel corresponding to the<br><br>
displacement of the phase boundaries and on the other hand<br>
takes account changes to the surface of a boundary layer<br>
between the first and the second further phase corresponding<br>
to the displacement of the phase boundaries, the grain spacing<br>
of the perlite can also be determined using the model. The<br>
lamella spacing (meaning the sum of the transverse sides of<br>
the phase boundaries) can in this case especially be<br>
approximately equal to double the critical lamella spacing.<br>
Despite the only one-dimensional computation, the inventive<br>
modelling method delivers very realistic results if the<br>
proportion of austenite based on a non-linear function<br>
determines the position of the phase boundary or of the phase<br>
boundaries.<br>
If the concentrations in which the at least one mobile alloy<br>
element are present on both sides of the first phase boundary<br>
or on both sides of the first and on both sides of the second<br>
phase boundary are determined on the basis of the Gibbs free<br>
enthalpies of the phases, the determination of the<br>
concentrations of the at least one mobile alloy element at the<br>
phase boundaries is especially simple.<br>
It is possible to always resolve the coupled Stefan problems<br>
and to deduce from this which phases are formed in what<br>
volume. In many cases this is even irrefutable. Sometimes<br>
however it is possible, before resolving the phase change<br>
equation, on the basis of the phases already available in the<br>
initial state and on the basis of the Gibbs free enthalpies,<br>
to determine in advance, whether both austenite and also the<br>
first further phase are present or whether in addition to<br>
austenite and the first further phase: the second further<br>
phase is present.<br>
In individual cases the number of volume elements can be<br><br>
small. In an extreme case they are equal to one. Usually<br>
however the steel volume comprises a plurality of volume<br>
elements. If the Stefan problem or the Stefan problems are<br>
only resolved for a. part of the volume elements and the local<br>
proportions of the phases of the other volume elements are<br>
determined on the basis of the local proportions of the phases<br>
of the part of the volume element, the computing power<br>
required for modelling the behavior of the steel volume can<br>
thus be greatly reduced without having any great detrimental<br>
effect on the expressiveness of the model computation. The<br>
thermal conduction equation on the other hand is generally<br>
resolved individually for each volume element.<br>
The modelling method can alternatively be executed online and<br>
in real time but also offline.<br>
It is possible for example,<br>
for an initial status and at least one desired end quantity<br>
to be specified to the computer,<br>
for the above modelling method to be applied iteratively,<br>
for the initial state of the first iteration to correspond<br>
to the initial state and the initial state of each further<br>
iteration to correspond to the subsequent state determined<br>
immediately beforehand, and<br>
that, on the basis of the subsequent state determined after<br>
a last iteration an expected final quantity is determined<br>
and is compared with the desired final quantity.<br>
In this case the inventive modelling method can be<br>
alternatively executed online and in real time or offline.<br>
With offline execution in particular it is possible in this<br>
case that the influence quantities of the iteration correspond<br>
in their totality to a sequence of influence quantities, that<br>
the computer on the basis of the comparison of the expected<br><br>
end quantity with the desired end quantity varies the<br>
influence quantity sequence and starting from the initial<br>
status again, executes the above modelling method until at<br>
least the expected end quantity corresponds to the desired end<br>
quantity.<br>
It is however also possible for the computer to determine the<br>
influence quantities on the basis of an initial quantity<br>
determined from the initial state and a desired subsequent<br>
quantity and to control an influence device such that the<br>
steel volume is influenced in accordance with the influence<br>
quantity determined. In this case the modelling method must be<br>
executed online and in real time. The influencing device can<br>
be controlled in this case alternatively immediately or in the<br>
subsequent iteration.<br>

In accordance with FIG 1 a steel band 1 for example is to be<br>
cooled off so that it assumes specified final properties. To<br>
this end the steel band 1 is treated in a cooling line 2 with<br>
a cooling medium 3 - as a rule water.<br>
The steel band 1 has a breadth b and a depth d. It also has -<br>
basically' any - band length. It passes through the cooling<br>
line 2 at a velocity v.<br>
The band velocity v is continuously recorded and fed to a<br>
computer 4 which controls the cooling line 2. The computer 4<br>
is thus able in a known way to implement a path trace of the<br>
steel band 1. The zones of the steel band 1 which are affected<br>
are also known to the computer 4 if the cooling medium 3 is<br>
applied to the steel band 1 by means of delivery devices 5 of<br>
the cooling line 2.<br>
The computer 4 is programmed with a computer program 6 which<br>
is supplied to the computer 4 via a data medium 7, e.g. a CD-<br>
ROM 7. The computer program 6 is stored in (exclusively)<br>
machine-readable form on the data medium 7. The computer<br><br>
program 6 is accepted by the computer 4 and stored in bulk<br>
storage 8, e.g. on a hard disk 8, of the computer 4. This<br>
enables the computer 4, when the computer program 6 is called,<br>
to execute a modelling method for the steel band 1 or for its<br>
individual zones (= the steel volume 1) which will be<br>
described in more detail below.<br>
As shown in FIG 2 the steel volume 1 is broken down within the<br>
computer 4 into volume elements 9. Where a volume element 9 is<br>
not surrounded in this case on all sides by other volume<br>
elements 9, one or two surface elements 10 are assigned to the<br>
relevant volume element 9. The surface elements 10 in their<br>
entirety form a volumetric surface of the steel band 1 or of<br>
the zone of the steel band 1 observed<br>
On the basis of the programming with the computer program 6<br>
the computer 4 especially implements a mode in which for each<br>
volume element 9 the thermal couplings with its environment<br>
are taken into account. Each volume element 9 in this case -<br>
see FIG 3 - is embodied in the shape of a cube It thus has<br>
three basic dimensions A, B, C which as a rule are oriented in<br>
parallel to the direction of the band velocity v, the band<br>
breadth b and the band depth d.<br>
In a first embodiment of the inventive modelling method the<br>
computer 4 is supplied in accordance with FIG 4 in a step S1<br>
with a first state Z. The first Z comprises for each volume<br>
element 9 of the steel band 1 initially local proportions p1,<br>
p2, p3 of modelled phases of the steel. The phases can<br>
especially be ferrite (proportion p1), cementite (proportion<br>
p2) and austenite (proportion p3).<br>
The first state Z also comprises for each volume element 9 of<br>
the steel band 1 a quantity H which describes the local energy<br>
content of the 'steel of the volume element 9. For example this<br><br>
quantity H can be the enthalpy H of the volume element 9.<br>
Alternatively the temperature or the entropy are also<br>
considered .<br>
Finally the first state Z, for at least one of the volume<br>
elements 9 of the steel band 1, preferably for each volume<br>
element 9 of the steel band, also comprises a local<br>
distribution in concentration K of at least one mobile alloy<br>
element in the steel. The mobile alloy element can in<br>
particular be carbon. Nitrogen can also be considered for<br>
example as a alternative or in addition.<br>
As part of step S1 the computer 4 is further supplied with at<br>
least a desired end value f'*. If necessary the computer 4 can<br>
also be supplied as part of step S1 with intermediate<br>
quantities, so that if necessary even a desired timing curve<br>
of the quantity can be specified to the computer 4.<br>
In accordance with FIG 4 an influence quantity sequence is now<br>
defined in a step S2. The influence quantities sequence<br>
comprises an influence quantity W for a plurality of directly<br>
consecutive points in time. The influence quantity W<br>
corresponds for example to the volume of coolant to be applied<br>
to the steel volume 1 (i.e. the steel band or its observed<br>
zone) taking into account other influences on the steel volume<br>
such as the transport rollers, heat convection, heat radiation<br>
etc. for example. It comprises a local influence in each case<br>
for the plurality of surface elements 10 of the steel volume 1<br>
(see FIG 2). The local influences then operate via the<br>
relevant surface element 10 on the steel volume 1.<br>
In accordance with FIG 4, in a step S3 an initial state ZA of<br>
the steel volume 1 is now set equal to the first state Z and a<br>
time base t at a start time t0. The start time tO as a rule<br>
corresponds in this case to the point in time at which the<br><br>
observed steel volume 1, that is a section of the steel band 1<br>
for example enters the cooling line 2.<br>
Then in a step S4, on the basis of the influence quantity<br>
sequence, the influence quantity to be applied at the point<br>
determined by the time base t is determined. In a step S5 the<br>
computer 4 then determines on the basis of the instantaneous<br>
initial state ZA of the steel volume 1 and of the<br>
instantaneous influence quantity W operating over the<br>
volumetric surface on the steel volume 1 a subsequent state ZF<br>
of the steel volume The computer 4 resolves a thermal<br>
conduction equation and a phase change equation in this case.<br>
The subsequent state ZF comprises these same elements K, p1,<br>
p2, p3, H as the initial state ZA.<br>
Then in a step S6 the time base t is incremented by the time<br>
increment Δt. Next', in a step S7 a check is made as to whether<br>
the time base t has reached an end time tl. The end time t1 in<br>
this case generally corresponds to the time at which the<br>
observed steel volume 1 leaves the cooling line 2 again.<br>
If end time tl is not yet reached, in a step S8 the initial<br>
state ZA is set equal to the subsequent state ZF determined<br>
immediately beforehand and then a branch is made back to step<br>
S4.<br>
If on the other hand the end time tl was reached, the program<br>
exits from the loop consisting of steps S4 to S8. If no<br>
further measures are taken thereafter, only a so-called<br>
process observer is realized. Preferably however, as shown in<br>
FIG 4, an expected final value f', e.g. the temperature or the<br>
material hardness is determined in a step S9 on the basis of<br>
the subsequent state ZA now determines and is compared to the<br>
desired final quantity f'*. If the expected final quantity f'<br>
does not correspond to the desired final quantity f'* -<br><br>
provided the corresponding computing power is available - the<br>
sequence of the influence quantities W is varied in a step<br>
S10. A branch is then made back to a step S3. Otherwise the<br>
required coolant amount sequence is determined so that the<br>
computer 4 can now accordingly control the cooling line 2 in a<br>
step Sll.<br>
For the sake of completeness it should be mentioned here that<br>
the computer 4, if as well as the desired end quantity f'*,<br>
desired intermediate quantities are also specified to it,<br>
obviously determines the coolant sequence up to the first<br>
desired intermediate quantity, then up to the second desired<br>
intermediate quantity etc., until the entire coolant amount<br>
sequence up to the desired end quantity f'* is determined.<br>
In accordance with FIG 1 and 4 the model method described<br>
above is executed online and in real time. An offline<br>
execution is obviously easily possible too. This is indicated<br>
in FIG 1 by the fact that the connection of the cooling line 2<br>
to the computer 4 is shown as an openable connection, that is<br>
there does not have to be a direct control of the cooling line<br>
2. Furthermore step Sll in FIG 4 is only shown by dashed<br>
lines ..<br>
The procedure in accordance with FIG 4 demands a very great<br>
computing effort. If the computing power required for<br>
execution of the method in accordance with FIG 4 is not<br>
available, but online control using the inventive modelling<br>
method is still to be undertaken, a method is executed online<br>
and in real time which is described below in greater detail in<br>
conjunction with FIG. 5.<br>
In accordance with FIG 5 the computer 4 accepts the first<br>
state Z in a step S12 similar to step S1. In a step S13<br>
similar to step S3 the computer 4 sets the initial state ZA<br><br>
equal to the first state Z and the time base t to time t0.<br>
Then the computer 4 in a step S14 determines a desired<br>
subsequent quantity f* or accepts this quantity.<br>
In a step S15 similar to step S9 the computer 4 determines an<br>
initial quantity t on the basis of an initial state ZA. On the<br>
basis of the initial quantity f and the desired subsequent<br>
quantity f* determined in step S15, the computer 4 then<br>
determines the influence quantities W in a step S16. In a step<br>
S17, which corresponds to the step Sll, the computer 4 finally<br>
controls the cooling line 2 in accordance with the influence<br>
quantity W determined. In this case the control is preferably<br>
undertaken immediately, as in FIG. 5. If necessary however an<br>
activation can also be undertaken in the next cycle.<br>
The subsequent steps S18 to S21 correspond to the steps S5 to<br>
S8 of FIG 4. A detailed description of these steps S18 to S21<br>
is thus dispensed with.<br>
The method in accordance with FIG 5 a is preferably used for<br>
example for a control of a steel band 1 running through the<br>
cooling line 1 for expiry of the desired subsequent quantity<br>
f* . In this case the method described above in connection with<br>
FIG 5 must obviously be executed individually for each<br>
individual section of the steel band 1. Also for each section<br>
those of the supply devices 5 must be activated in the area of<br>
influence of which the observed section is currently located.<br>
This is guaranteed by the path tracing mentioned at the start.<br>
The method in accordance with FIG 5 is in this case<br>
furthermore executed in parallel for all the sections of the<br>
steel band 1 located in the cooling line 2.<br>
The desired subsequent quantity f* in each case can be<br>
explicitly specified to the computer 4. It is however also<br>
possible for the computer merely to have the desired<br><br>
subsequent quantity f* specified to it, e.g. on exit of the<br>
steel band 1 from the cooling line 2 or on reaching a coiler<br>
on which the steel band 1 is coiled. In this case the computer<br>
4 determines independently on the basis of a pre-specified<br>
determination specification the desired subsequent quantities<br>
f* for the individual iterations.<br>
The controlling in accordance with FIG 5 can of course also be<br>
structured in a different manner, as is described in the older<br>
DE 103 21 792.4 for example.<br>
As mentioned in the steps S5 and S18 a thermal conduction<br>
equation and a phase change equation are resolved.<br>
An example of a thermal conduction equation and of a phase<br>
change equation are shown in FIG 6. A one-dimensional approach<br>
for thermal conduction is adopted there. For bands however<br>
this approach can in every likelihood also be simplified to<br>
the one-dimensional approach depicted in FIG 7, since the heat<br>
flow in the longitudinal band direction and the transverse<br>
band direction is negligible. 5/ 5x is in this case the local<br>
derivation in the band breadth direction.<br>
The thermal conduction equation and the phase change equation<br>
are evidently coupled to one another. To resolve the thermal<br>
conduction equation and the phase change equation (step SS,<br>
S18) the procedure in accordance with FIG 8 is thus as<br>
follows:<br>
The local temperature T is first determined in a step S22. The<br>
temperature is determined on the basis of the enthalpy H and<br>
the proportions p1, p2, p3 of the phases ferrite, cementite<br>
and austenite. Because of the small size of the observed<br>
volume element 9 it can namely be assumed that the local<br>
temperature T is constant within the volume element 9. This<br><br>
means that the phases of the steel within this volume element<br>
9 also exhibit this same local temperature T. The enthalpy H<br>
of the volume element 9 can thus be written as<br>
H = p1H1(T) + p2H2(T) + p3H3(T)	(1)<br>
Since furthermore for each of the phases of the enthalpies H1,<br>
H2 or H3 the relevant phase as function of the local<br>
temperature T - where necessary for austenite taking into<br>
consideration the proportion of carbon - are uniquely<br>
determined, the local temperature T is able to be easily<br>
determined by the equation 1.<br>
For the local temperature T determined in the step S22 the<br>
Gibbs free enthalpies G 1 to G3 of the individual phases are<br>
then determined in a step S2 3 - separately for the phase<br>
ferrite, cementite and austenite - as a function of the<br>
proportion of the mobile alloy element. Examples of these<br>
types of curve are shown in FIG 9 and 10. In the example<br>
depicted in FIG] 9 the local temperature T in this case lies<br>
above the temperature at which austenite changes into perlite,<br>
in the example depicted in FIG. 10 it lies below this<br>
temperature.<br>
It is possible to always assume that all three phases ferrite,<br>
cementite and austenite are present and only later - see the<br>
explanations for FIG 18 below - to decide which phases are<br>
present and which phase changes are taking place. In<br>
accordance with FIG 8 however the number of phases to be<br>
observed is initially determined in a step S24. This is done<br>
using the following procedure:<br>
Initially the system ferrite-austenite is extracted. A check<br>
is made for this system whether the overall proportion of the<br>
mobile alloy element present in the volume element 9 is purely<br><br>
ferritic, purely austenitic or mixed stable and which phase<br>
distribution is present in the stable state where necessary.<br>
The overall proportion of the mobile alloy element can easily<br>
be determined on the basis of the concentration in<br>
distribution.<br>
The stable phase(s) is (are) determined and if necessary<br>
distributed by an attempt being made to determine a minimum<br>
for the total Gibbs free enthalpy G of such a system. The<br>
concrete procedure is produced in this case as described on<br>
pages 16 to 18 of the older German Patent Application 102 51<br>
716.9. This procedure simultaneously also delivers<br>
concentrations K1 and K3 in which the mobile alloy element - a<br>
typically carbon - is present at any phase boundary 11 between<br>
ferrite and austenite in the ferritic or the austenitic zone.<br>
The mixture systems ferrite-cementite (=perlite) and<br>
austenite-cementite are then investigated in a similar manner.<br>
The investigation of the mixture system austenite-cementite<br>
simultaneously also delivers concentrations K2 and K4 in this<br>
case in which the mobile alloy element is present at any phase<br>
boundary 12 between cementite and austenite in the cementitic<br>
or the austenitic zone.<br>
The three Gibbs free enthalpies G determined for the three<br>
two-phase systems are compared to one another and the two-<br>
phase system with the overall minimum Gibbs free enthalpy G is<br>
obtained. If this two-phase system contains austenite, it is<br>
possible to determine on the basis of the Gibbs free<br>
enthalpies whether the stable state comprises one or two<br>
phases, which phase this might necessarily be or which phases<br>
these might necessarily be and which concentrations k1, k3 or.<br>
k2, k4 of the mobile alloy element are present on both sides<br>
of the phase boundary 11 from austenite to ferrite or the<br><br>
phase boundary 12 from austenite to cementite in each case.<br>
It is further known from initial state ZA which phases are<br>
initially present for which proportions p1 to p3.<br>
If the two-phase system with the minimum Gibbs enthalpy G<br>
contains austenite, it can thus be determined by looking at<br>
the initially present phases and the phases determined as<br>
stable where they are a pure system with only one of the<br>
phases ferrite, austenite and cementite or a mixed system with<br>
two or even three of the phases ferrite, austenite and<br>
cementite have to be observed. Because of the fact that it can<br>
also be determined on the basis of the Gibbs free enthalpies<br>
G, G1 which phase is stable or which phases are stable in<br>
addition the direction of any phase change is also known.<br>
If the two-phase system with the total minimum Gibbs free<br>
enthalpy G is the perlite system and the initial state ZA does<br>
not contain any austenite (p3 = 0), a completely changed<br>
framework, that is a two=phase system ferrite-cementite is<br>
present that is not subject to any further phase change, if on<br>
the other hand the initial state ZA contains austenite (p3 &gt;<br>
0) and the perlite system features the minimum Gibbs free<br>
enthalpy G it cannot simply be decided whether one or both of<br>
the phases ferrite and cementite will now be formed, in this<br>
case it is thus provisionally assumed that both phases are<br>
formed, that is that a three-phase system ferrite-cementite-<br>
austenite is to be observed.<br>
A next check is made in a step S25 as to whether there is more<br>
than one phase present in the observed volume element 9. If<br>
this is not the case, there is obviously no phase change.<br>
Despite this, in a step S26 a diffusion equation for the<br>
mobile alloy element is started and resolved for the volume<br>
element 9 in order to compensate for any concentration<br><br>
variations of the mobile alloy element within the observed<br>
volume element 9. This process is especially of significance<br>
for austenite, in which the carbon content can vary greatly.<br>
The approach and the solution of such a diffusion equation is<br>
generally known to those skilled in the art. The use of the<br>
diffusion equation and its solution will thus not be dealt<br>
with in any greater detail here.<br>
If there is more than one phase present in the observed volume<br>
element 9, a check is made in a next step S27 as to whether<br>
all three phases are present. If they are not the system is a<br>
two-phase system. In this case a check is made in a step S28<br>
whether one of the two phases present is austenite. If this is<br>
not the case, the system is a complete perlite system, that is<br>
a layer structure made from ferrite and cementite. This<br>
structure is essentially stable. In this case no further<br>
measures must thus be taken.<br>
If on the other hand one of the phases is austenite and thus<br>
the other phase is ferrite or cementite, a phase boundary 11<br>
exists between austenite and ferrite (see FIG 11 and 12) or a<br>
phase boundary 12 between austenite and cementite (see FIG. 11<br>
and 13). In this case it is assumed as a simplifying measure<br>
that the phase boundary 11 or 12 is embodied as a rectangle<br>
which has a longitudinal side and a transverse side. The<br>
longitudinal side and the transverse side of the rectangle<br>
correspond in this case to the basic dimensions A and B of the<br>
observed volume element 9. Displacements of the phase boundary<br>
11, 12 occur in this case, as is especially evident from FIG<br>
11, in parallel to basic dimension C.<br>
As is generally known to those skilled in the art, and can<br>
also be seen from FIG 12, only very little carbon is contained<br>
in ferrite. By contrast, at the phase boundary 11 to the<br><br>
austenitic zone there is a jump in concentration. The<br>
concentrations k1, k3, in which the mobile alloy element is<br>
present at the phase boundary 11 are in this case the<br>
concentrations k1, k3, which were determined above in the step<br>
S24 for the ferrite-austenite system.<br>
If, as shown in FIG 12, a change is to take place from<br>
austenite into ferrite, the "concentration peak" of the mobile<br>
alloy element must diffuse down in the austenitic zone in the<br>
vicinity of the phase boundary 11. Conversely, if a change is<br>
to occur from ferrite into austenite, the "concentration<br>
trough" of the mobile alloy element in the austenitic zone in<br>
the vicinity of the phase boundary 11 must be constantly<br>
filled up. The numerical or analytical solution to this task<br>
is generally known as the Stefan problem. It is undertaken in<br>
a step S29. In the present case the Stefan problem can be<br>
formulated as follows:<br>
K't-DK'xx=0		(2)<br>
D is in this case the - where necessary temperature-dependent<br>
- diffusion constant of the mobile alloy element in the<br>
austenite. K' is the concentration K. The indices t and x mean<br>
the derivation according to the time or the location in the<br>
direction of displacement of the phase boundary 11. The<br>
displacement direction of the phase boundary 11 in this case<br>
does not necessarily have to be the band breadth direction.<br>
The initial conditions for the equation 2 are defined by the<br>
local distribution in concentration K' of the mobile alloy<br>
element in the initial state ZA. For resolution of the Stefan<br>
problem only the peripheral conditions then have to be<br>
considered, that in the ferritic or austenitic zone at the<br>
phase boundary 11 the concentrations kl or k3 are present,<br>
that the mobile alloy element cannot leave the volume element<br><br>
9 concerned and that the displacement δx' of the phase<br>
boundary 11 in accordance with the Stefan condition produces<br><br>
with 5t being the timing step sizes used in the resolution of<br>
the Stefan problem. In this case this can be a fraction (1/2,<br>
1/3, 1/4 ...) of the time step width At or equal to the time<br>
step width Δt.<br>
By resolving the Stefan problem in the step S29 it is also<br>
determined whether and how the distribution in concentration K<br>
or. K' of the mobile alloy element changes in the austenitic<br>
zone of the volume element 9 observed. At the same time it is<br>
also determined in this case, whether and by what extent δx'<br>
the phase boundary 11 is displaced thereby. <br>
If the further phase is not ferrite, but cementite is,<br>
basically the same type of approach to the solution is<br>
produced and also basically a solution of the same type. The<br>
difference is only that for the. formation of cementite carbon<br>
is greatly enriched in the cementite and in the austenitic<br>
zone in the vicinity of the phase boundary 12 carbon is<br>
degraded from the cementite. This too is generally known to<br>
persons skilled in the art and is shown in FIG 13. The<br>
peripheral conditions thus change. The displacement δx" of the<br>
phase boundary 11 in accordance with the Stefan condition in<br>
this case is produced for<br><br>
K" is in this case again the concentration K.<br>
If on the other hand in the step S28 it was established that<br>
all three phases are present or could be present, a more<br>
complicated problem is produced. The approach which must then<br><br>
be selected is that a layer structure exists, which - see FIG<br>
14 and 15 - consists of an alternate ferrite layer 13 and a<br>
cementite layer 14. The layer structure borders an austenitic<br>
zone 15. FIG 16 and 17 each show a curve of the concentration<br>
K' or. K" of the mobile alloy element in a ferrite layer 13 or<br>
a cementite layer t 14 and in the austenitic zone 15 in front<br>
of these layers 13, 14.<br>
Within the framework of the model it is still assumed in this<br>
case, that the phase boundaries 11, 12 are embodied as<br>
rectangles each having a longitudinal side and a transverse<br>
side. The longitudinal sides continue to correspond to the<br>
first basic measurement A. The transverse sides still run in<br>
parallel to the second basic dimension B. It is also still<br>
assumed that displacements of the phase boundaries 11, 12<br>
occur in parallel to the third basic dimension C.<br>
For each of the phase boundaries 11 and 12 a Stefan problem is<br>
now formulated and resolved in a step S30. The step S30 is<br>
shown in greater detail in FIG 18.<br>
The Stefan problem for the phase boundary 11 between ferrite<br>
and austenite obeys in accordance with FIG 18, see step S31<br>
there, the following law:<br><br>
K' is in this case the concentration of the mobile alloy<br>
element before the phase boundary 11.<br>
The Stefan problem for the phase boundary 12 between cementite<br>
and austenite obeys the following law:<br><br>
K" in this case - like K' - is the concentration of the mobile<br><br>
alloy element before the phase boundary 12.<br>
L1 and L2 are coupling terms. They are - see FIG 14 -<br>
functions of a lamella spacing 1 of the layer structure and of<br>
a proportion q of the cementite phase at the layer structure<br>
as well as its time derivation. Written out they can for<br>
example be as follows:<br><br>
As can be seen from the equations 5 to 8, the two Stefan<br>
problems are coupled to each other because of the coupling<br>
terms L1, L2 on the right side of the equations 5 and 6.<br>
In the equations 5 to 8 as well the indices t and x again<br>
stand for the derivation in accordance with the time or the<br>
location in the direction of displacement of the phase<br>
boundary 11 or 12.<br>
The Stefan conditions continue to apply for the displacements δx', 6x" of the phase boundaries 11, 12 (see equations 3 and<br>
4). It is thus possible to set the displacements δx', δx"<br>
equal in accordance with the equations 3 and 4 in a step S32 .<br>
The proportion q is then to be determined such that the<br>
displacement 6x' of the phase boundary 11 in accordance with<br>
equation 3 and the displacement δx" of the phase boundary 12<br>
in accordance with equation 4 assume the same value. The<br>
proportion q in this case is also to be defined such that the<br>
phase boundaries 11, 12 always remain arranged next to one<br>
another.<br>
The equivalence of the displacements δx' , δx" of the phase<br><br>
boundaries 11, 12 can also be obtained by the proportion q of<br>
the cementite phase in the layer structure of the perlite<br>
being suitably selected. One can also determine - e.g. by<br>
trial and error, for which proportion q of the cementite phase<br>
the displacements δx', δx" of the phase boundaries 11, 12<br>
match.<br>
On the basis of the proportion q thus determined it can also<br>
then be determined, whether perlite will actually be formed or<br>
whether only one of the two phases ferrite and cementite will<br>
be formed. Perlite will only be formed if the proportion q<br>
lies between zero and one. If the proportion q on the other<br>
hand is greater than one, exclusively cementite is formed. If<br>
on the other hand it is less than zero, exclusively ferrite is<br>
formed.<br>
The proportion q can with the procedure assume any values for<br>
numeric reasons, that is especially also less than zero or<br>
greater than one. These values however make no sense<br>
physically. The proportion q is thus corrected accordingly in<br>
steps S33 to S36 where necessary.<br>
The procedure according to step 32 can lead to numerical<br>
problems. Alternatively it is thus possible to allow differing<br>
displacements δx', δx". In this case the proportion q of the<br>
cementite in the layer structure in accordance with<br><br>
is adjusted in steps S32a and S32b so that the positions of<br>
the phase boundaries 11, 12 tend towards one another. The<br>
steps S32a and S32b are executed in this case in accordance<br>
with FIG 18 instead of step S32. a is a suitable<br>
proportionality constant. Its value is greater than zero.<br><br>
In this case an average displacement 5x the phase boundaries<br>
11, 12 for<br><br>
is defined.<br>
Regardless of which of these two procedures (step S32 or steps<br>
S32a, S32b) is followed, in both case however it is only<br>
determined and deduced from the determination of the<br>
proportion q which phases will be formed in what volume.<br>
If perlite will be formed proportion q thus lies between zero<br>
and one, the lamella spacing 1 must still be determined. This<br>
is done in accordance with FIG 19 as follows:<br>
With the displacement 5x the phase boundaries 11, 12 and the<br>
proportion q it is known which phase changes take place and in<br>
which proportions they take place. The phase changes deliver<br>
an amount 5E1 for energy balance. The amount 5E1 depends on<br>
the volume in which the phase changes occur. The following<br>
thus applies<br><br>
(3 is in this case a proportionality constant that can be<br>
determined in advance.<br>
This further produces a change of the surface of a boundary<br>
layer 16 between ferrite and cementite. The change of this<br>
surface also delivers an amount δE2 for energy balance. This<br>
amount δE2 is proportional to the change in the surface of the<br>
boundary layer 16. The following thus applies<br><br><br>
γ is in this case again a proportionality constant that can be<br>
determined in advance. The factor 2 is produced by the fact<br>
that, for each phase boundary 11, 12 or for each layer 13, 14<br>
one boundary layer 16 respectively is present and two phase<br>
boundaries 11, 12 or two layers 13, 14 are observed.<br>
On the basis of the equations 11 and 12 it is thus possible to<br>
determine a critical lamella spacing 1', in which the energy<br>
balance, which takes account of the two amounts 5E1 and δE2 is<br>
balanced. The following then applies for this critical lamella<br>
spacing 1'<br><br>
The lamella spacing 1, that is the sum of the layer<br>
thicknesses 11 and 12, is now set to appr. one and a half<br>
times to three times this critical lamella spacing 1', e.g. to<br>
appr. twice The layer thicknesses 11 or 12 are then produced<br>
for<br><br>
The layer thicknesses 11, 12 are proportional to square<br>
measures F1, F2, which the phase boundaries 11, 12 exhibit.<br>
Each one of the square measures Fl, F2 in FIG 14 is<br>
highlighted accordingly by shading.<br>
If in one of the steps S2 9, S30 a displacement δx', δx" of a<br>
phase boundary 11, 12, was determined, the position of the<br>
phase boundary 12 has thus changed. I this case in a step S37<br>
(obviously taking account of the leading sign of the average<br>
displacement 6x) a new position of the phase boundaries 11, 12<br>
or 11 and 12 is determined. In a step S38, on the basis of a<br><br>
non-linear function the position of the phase boundary 11, 12<br>
or the phase boundaries 11, 12 of the proportion p3 of the<br>
austenite is determined. The non-linear function in this case<br>
especially takes account of the fact that the Stefan problem<br>
of the step S29 or the Stefan problem of the step S30 were<br>
started and resolved one-dimensionally but in reality a three<br>
dimensional change occurs.<br>
In a step S39 the changes of the proportions p1, p2 of the two<br>
other phases ferrite and cementite will then be determined. If<br>
in this case the steps S37 to S39 are reached from step S29,<br>
the proportion q is obviously one or zero.<br>
With the average displacement 5x of the phase boundaries 11,<br>
12 and the proportion q of the cementite in the layer<br>
structure (0 
manner which changes are produced for the proportions p1, p2,<br>
p3 of the phases of the steel as regards the volume element 9<br>
observed.<br>
Despite the simplifying assumptions of the above modeling<br>
methods a significant computing effort is produced. Thus in<br>
accordance with FIG 8 before step S22 steps S40 and S41 and<br>
after step S39 a step S42 are inserted.<br>
In the step S40 the volume element 9 is assembled into groups.<br>
For example there can be a grouping together of a number of<br>
volume elements 9 which in the direction of the band breadth<br>
b, the band depth d and/or the band velocity v adjoin each<br>
other. Combinations of these are also possible. In the step<br>
S41 a single one of the volume elements 9 in each case is then<br>
selected per group of volume elements 9. Only for the selected<br>
elements of the volume elements 9 are in steps S22 to S39 the<br>
differential equation, the Stefan problem or the Stefan<br>
problems resolved and the proportions p1 p2, p3 of the phases<br><br>
computed.<br>
In accordance with FIG 8, for each group the solution result<br>
of the volume element 9 observed is accepted in the step S42<br>
for the other volume elements 9 of the relevant group. This<br>
represents the simplest procedure. It would however also be<br>
conceivable to determine the proportions p1, p2, p3 of the<br>
phases of volume elements 9, for which the phase distribution<br>
has not been explicitly computed through linear or non-linear<br>
interpolation.<br>
Because of the circumstance, namely that for each group of<br>
volume elements 9 only the distribution in concentration K of<br>
one of the volume elements 9 is calculated and for the<br>
resolution of the thermal conduction equation not the<br>
concentration in distribution K, but only the proportions p1,<br>
p2, p3 of the available phases are needed if necessary the<br>
concentration in distribution K can only be specified for this<br>
one volume element 9 of each group.<br>
The thermal conduction equation on the other hand is resolved<br>
in a step S43 individually for each of the volume elements 9.<br>
The step S43 can in this case alternatively be executed before<br>
or after the resolution of the phase change equation in the<br>
steps S22 to S42.<br>
The resolution of the thermal conduction equation is possible<br>
in any event. This is because the temperatures T of the<br>
individual volume elements 9 - see above explanations for step<br>
S22 - can be determined in any event, so that their location<br>
gradient can also be determined immediately. Since the<br>
proportions p1, p2, p3 of the phases of the individual volume<br>
elements 9 are also known, the thermal conductivity A of the<br>
individual volume elements 9 can also be easily determined.<br>
Since finally the density p is essentially a constant and the<br><br>
 enthalpy H of the individual volume elements 9 is given<br>
directly the thermal conduction equation is thus also soluble<br>
as a whole.<br>
Using the present invention a physical model is thus created<br>
in which, on the basis of the Gibbs free enthalpy G and of the<br>
diffusion law (Stefan problem) the change process as regards<br>
phase proportions p1, p2, p3 arising and speed of change can<br>
be described with very high accuracy. Generally valid results<br>
are made possible which also allow the handling of as yet<br>
unknown substances and materials. The approaches can also be<br>
used not only for temperature calculation, but also for<br>
computing the framework structure and particle size.<br>
The inventive modelling method can be employed at any point,<br>
that is especially for example also for cooling processes<br>
between roller frames of a roller track or with so-called<br>
ferrite rollers. It is also suitable for description of the<br>
change back when the steel is heated up.<br><br>
