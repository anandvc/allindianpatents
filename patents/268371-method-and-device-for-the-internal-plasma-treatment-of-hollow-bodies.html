				<td>Method and Device for the Internal Plasma Treatment of<br>
Hollow Bodies<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates in general to the internal plasma<br>
treatment of substrates in the form of hollow bodies,<br>
particularly substrates with small diameters, such as<br>
typical pharmaceutical packaging.<br>
EP 1 206 389 Bl discloses a method and a device for the<br>
sterile packaging of substances in plastic containers. A<br>
plasma treatment is carried out in this case, for example<br>
plasma sterilization, in which the plasma is excited<br>
selectively as a function of position and/or time in<br>
various zones of the walls of the container. The method and<br>
the device are intended to make it possible to carry out<br>
aseptic packaging, and even pyrogen-free packaging in the<br>
case of pharmaceutical products, of liquids in plastic<br>
containers such as ampoules, bottles or vials, and to<br>
combine this with further processing steps.<br>
EP 1 251 190 Al describes a method for the uniform coating<br>
of hollow bodies, wherein one open end of the hollow body<br>
is hermetically sealed by a lid, the hollow body is placed<br>
in a plasma-induced CVD reactor, a vacuum is applied to the<br>
hollow body, a coating temperature is set up and the<br>
plasma-induced coating is carried out.<br>
Furthermore, DE 196 29 877 CI discloses a CVD method and a<br>
device for the internal coating of hollow bodies, in which<br><br>
2<br>
the coating quality can already be predicted during<br>
production. A pulsed plasma method is used, in which the<br>
plasma is ignited by a chronological sequence of ignition<br>
pulses, and the time correlation of the light pulses of an<br>
oxygen plasma, as well as the intensity of at least one<br>
emission line of the coating gas, are measured and<br>
evaluated both during the heating phase and during the<br>
coating phase.<br>
DE 196 34 795 C2 describes a plasma CVD system having an<br>
array of microwave plasma electrodes and a control circuit.<br>
Two neighboring plasma electrodes are respectively exposed<br>
by the control circuit to microwave pulses at different<br>
times, the duration of the pulse being short compared with<br>
the duration of a pulse conventionally used for pulsed<br>
plasma CVD methods.<br>
DE 44 3 8 3 59 C2 discloses a plastic container with a<br>
barrier coating, the barrier coating consisting of a layer<br>
stack with sequentially arranged barrier layers of<br>
inorganic material consisting of one or more inorganic<br>
oxides, nitrides or oxynitrides or a mixture thereof, and<br>
an organic polymer material. The layer stack in this case<br>
contains at least two barrier layers made of the inorganic<br>
material. The layers are preferably deposited by means of<br>
plasma polymerization.<br>
It is an object of the invention to improve the plasma<br>
treatment of small and/or elongate hollow bodies with<br>
narrow cross sections. The coating of such workpieces in<br>
the form of hollow bodies is a technical challenge which<br>
has to date been resolved only unsatisfactorily.<br><br>
3<br>
This object is directly achieved in an extremely<br>
surprisingly simple way by the subject-matter of the<br>
independent claims. Advantageous configurations and<br>
refinements of the invention are specified in the dependent<br>
claims.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method for the plasma<br>
treatment of workpieces, particularly workpieces in the<br>
form of hollow bodies, in which a treatment zone in a<br>
reactor chamber is at least partially evacuated, a process<br>
gas is introduced into the treatment zone, for instance the<br>
cavity of the workpiece, and a plasma is ignited by means<br>
of injected electromagnetic energy in the process gas<br>
introduced into the treatment zone, wherein the process gas<br>
flows through the treatment zone between opposite ends of<br>
the zone during the plasma treatment.<br>
A corresponding device for the plasma treatment of<br>
workpieces, which is in particular adapted to carry out the<br>
method as defined above, comprises a reactor chamber, a<br>
treatment zone in the reactor chamber, an instrument for at<br>
least partially evacuating the treatment zone in the<br>
reactor chamber, an instrument for injecting<br>
electromagnetic energy into the treatment zone in order to<br>
generate a plasma in the process gas introduced in the<br>
treatment zone and an instrument for introducing process<br>
gas into the treatment zone, wherein the instrument for<br>
introducing process gas and the instrument for evacuating<br>
the treatment zone are arranged so that the process gas<br>
flows through the treatment zone between opposite ends of<br>
the zone during operation. The evacuation instrument is<br>
also used to discharge the process gas.<br><br>
4<br>
Workpieces which have dielectric properties at least in a<br>
local zone are preferably treated by the invention. The<br>
effect achieved by this is that the electromagnetic<br>
radiation cannot be shielded by conductive surfaces of the<br>
workpiece.<br>
The plasma treatment may be carried out exclusively on the<br>
inside or exclusively on the outside of the workpiece of<br>
the hollow body. Two-sided plasma treatment, i.e. both on<br>
the inside and on the outside of the hollow body, may<br>
likewise be carried out. The plasma treatments may also<br>
advantageously be different on the inside and the outside<br>
of the hollow body, or affect the surfaces in different<br>
ways. This is possible, for example, by introducing<br>
different process gases into the surroundings and into the<br>
cavity.<br>
The invention particularly advantageously allows the plasma<br>
treatment of small workpieces, which may furthermore be<br>
highly elongate. Thus, according to a refinement of the<br>
invention, workpieces may be treated which are shaped<br>
cylindrically or quasi-cylindrically and have a maximum<br>
external diameter of between 1 mm and 50 mm, preferably<br>
between 3 mm and 3 0 mm, preferably from 5 mm to 2 0 mm and a<br>
height of from 10 mm to 200 mm, preferably from 30 mm to<br>
150 mm, particularly preferably from 50 mm to 100 mm.<br>
According to another refinement of the invention,<br>
cylindrically or quasi-cylindrically shaped workpieces with<br>
a maximum internal diameter of between 1 mm and 50 mm,<br>
preferably between 2 mm and 29 mm, particularly preferably<br>
from 4 mm to 20 mm and a height of from 10 mm to 200 mm,<br>
preferably from 30 mm to 150 mm, particularly preferably<br><br>
5<br>
from 50 mm to 100 mm and a wall thickness of from 0.2 mm to<br>
10 mm, preferably from 0.3 mm to-8 mm, particularly<br>
preferably from 2 mm to 5 mm are plasma-treated. In<br>
particular, such workpieces may be treated along their<br>
entire length or at least the entire length of the cavity<br>
of the workpieces.<br>
The workpieces may comprise a second cylindrical or quasi-<br>
cylindrical, for example slightly conical appendage with a<br>
smaller diameter and a shorter length, which are preferably<br>
20% less than the maximum diameter and the height. Such an<br>
appendage may for example be the connection element for the<br>
cannula, for example a Luer cone or a nozzle of a syringe<br>
body. This second cylindrical or quasi-cylindrical<br>
appendage with a smaller diameter and a shorter length may<br>
have a preferably narrow, cannula-like internal diameter of<br>
between 0.01 and 15 mm, particularly preferably between<br>
0.05 and 4 mm. Workpieces with such geometries, which thus<br>
comprise different sections with very different diameters,<br>
may for the first time be treated satisfactorily by the<br>
through-flow principle according to the invention.<br>
Accordingly, the invention is in particular also suitable<br>
for small workpieces with a volume in the range of 0.1 -<br>
100 ml, preferably in the range of 0.2 - 40 ml,<br>
particularly preferably 0.5 - 20 ml.<br>
It has been found that by means of the through-flow<br>
principle according to the invention, coatings can be<br>
deposited very uniformly on all the surfaces, in particular<br>
internally. If barrier coatings are deposited, it is<br>
thereby possible to ensure that a barrier effect is<br>
achieved surface-wide. In the case of a cylindrical or<br>
quasi-cylindrical workpiece with a first cylindrical or<br><br>
6<br>
quasi-cylindrical surface and a cylindrical or quasi-<br>
cylindrical appendage with a second cylindrical or quasi-<br>
cylindrical surface, at least one thin layer with a layer<br>
thickness D1 may thus be applied on the first cylindrical<br>
or quasi-cylindrical surface and the layer may be applied<br>
with a thickness D2 on the second quasi-cylindrical<br>
surface, the relation 0.2 
D2/D1 
being satisfied for the ratio of the thicknesses Dl and D2.<br>
For syringes in which the cylindrical or quasi-cylindrical<br>
appendage represents the nozzle or the luer cone, a coating<br>
with a sufficient barrier effect can thereby also be<br>
deposited inside the nozzle.<br>
It is likewise possible to deposit a scratch protection<br>
layer by means of the through-flow reactor according to the<br>
invention. This may be deposited internally and/or in<br>
particular externally.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides a method for<br>
the plasma treatment of workpieces in the form of hollow<br>
bodies, in which the cavity of the workpiece is at least<br>
partially evacuated, a process gas is introduced into the<br>
cavity of the workpiece, and a plasma is ignited by means<br>
of injected electromagnetic energy in the process gas<br>
introduced into the cavity, the workpiece in the form of a<br>
hollow body furthermore comprising at least one opening<br>
leading into the cavity at a first end of the workpiece and<br>
the cavity being evacuated through this opening, wherein<br>
the process gas is put into the cavity at a position which<br>
lies at least half the longitudinal extent of the cavity<br>
away from the opening at the first end of the workpiece.<br><br>
7<br>
To this end a device according to the invention for the<br>
plasma treatment of workpieces in the form of hollow<br>
bodies, which is suitable in particular for carrying out<br>
the method, comprises a holder in a reactor chamber for at<br>
least one workpiece in the form of a hollow body with a<br>
connection instrument to connect an evacuation instrument,<br>
for at least partially evacuating the cavity of the<br>
workpiece, to an opening leading into the cavity at a first<br>
end of the workpiece, an instrument for injecting<br>
electromagnetic energy into the cavity in order to ignite a<br>
plasma in process gas which can be introduced in the<br>
cavity, and an instrument for introducing process gas at a<br>
position in the cavity which lies at least 2/3 of the<br>
longitudinal extent of the cavity away from the opening at<br>
the first end of the workpiece.<br>
The process gas is therefore respectively put in<br>
essentially opposite to the opening of the cavity which is<br>
used for the evacuation. The process gas thus flows through<br>
at least the majority of the cavity in a directed movement.<br>
This configuration has proven particularly advantageous for<br>
achieving a uniform plasma treatment on the inner surface<br>
of the workpiece.<br>
It is even more advantageous for the process gas to be put<br>
into the cavity by means of a suitably designed instrument<br>
at a position which lies at least 2/3, more desirably 3/4,<br>
preferably 9/10, particularly preferably 95/100 of the<br>
longitudinal extent of the cavity away from the opening at<br>
the first end of the workpiece.<br><br>
8<br>
To this end the process gas may be put into the cavity-<br>
through a cannula, the opening of which lies at least 2/3,<br>
more desirably at least 3/4, preferably 9/10, particularly<br>
preferably 95/100 of the longitudinal extent of the cavity<br>
away from the opening at the first end of the workpiece.<br>
Dielectric material, in particular ceramic, is preferably<br>
used for the cannula.<br>
In order to be able to plasma-treat the surface of elongate<br>
and/or small workpieces with narrow cross sections<br>
uniformly, the invention also provides a method and a<br>
device in which a treatment zone in a reactor chamber is at<br>
least partially evacuated by means of an evacuation<br>
instrument, a process gas is introduced into the treatment<br>
zone, particularly into the cavity of the workpiece, and a<br>
plasma is ignited by means of injected electromagnetic<br>
energy in the process gas introduced into the treatment<br>
zone, wherein the process gas is put into the treatment<br>
zone through at least one cannula, the internal opening<br>
diameter of which is between 0.1 and 5.0 mm, preferably<br>
between 0.2 mm and 3.0 mm, particularly preferably between<br>
0.3 mm and 2.0 mm and the wall thickness of which is<br>
between 0.05 mm and 3.0 mm, preferably between 0.1 mm and<br>
2.0 mm, particularly preferably between 0.15 mm and 1.0 mm.<br>
According to another particularly preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, the workpiece is evacuated through an<br>
opening at a first end and the process gas is introduced<br>
through another opening at a second end of the workpiece,<br>
which lies opposite the first end. The openings may also<br>
have different cross sections in this case. This achieves<br>
flow of the process gas through in a direction between the<br>
two openings. In order to achieve particularly homogeneous<br><br>
9<br>
deposition, according to a refinement, the electromagnetic<br>
energy may additionally be input in the axial direction,<br>
particularly preferably axisymmetrically to the workpiece.<br>
By means of the invention, a continuous directed gas flow<br>
is achieved which flows through the zone of the reactor in<br>
which the plasma is ignited, in particular through the<br>
cavity to be treated. In contrast to this, dead zones in<br>
which there is scarcely any flow may be formed in<br>
previously known coating devices when filling with the<br>
process gas. This becomes commensurately more critical as<br>
the cross sections to be coated are narrower. Exchange of<br>
the process gas is thereby at least retarded in these<br>
zones, which inter alia may have a detrimental effect on<br>
the coatings being applied.<br>
Irrespective of whether the process gas is fed in through a<br>
cannula or through a second opening of the workpiece, in a<br>
preferred refinement of the invention an axisymmetric flow<br>
of the process gas through the cavity of the workpiece is<br>
established in order to achieve uniform coating. In general<br>
it is favorable, especially for the preferred small<br>
dimensions of the workpieces, for the electromagnetic<br>
energy to be input into the cavity or the surroundings of<br>
the workpiece in the axial direction of the workpiece,<br>
particularly preferably axisymmetrically. This allows a<br>
maximally homogeneous field distribution in the region of<br>
the workpiece surface to be coated, and therefore more<br>
homogeneous coating. In the case of syringe bodies, the<br>
input is therefore preferably carried out axisymmetrically<br>
with its cylinder axis.<br><br>
10<br>
The plasma treatment may in particular comprise plasma<br>
coating, and furthermore plasma activation, plasma<br>
pretreatment, plasma cleaning, plasma immersion or plasma<br>
modification. Furthermore, a plurality i.e. at least two of<br>
these treatment steps may advantageously be carried out by<br>
means of the method according to the invention, or the<br>
corresponding device.<br>
A layer which contains at least one of the substances SiOx,<br>
SiOxCy, SiOxNy, SiNy, TiOx, AlxOyNz, A1XNZ, AlxOy, CxHy,<br>
CxFy, TiNx may be deposited by the plasma treatment. The<br>
layer thicknesses are preferably greater than 5 nanometers,<br>
in particular greater than 20 nanometers, particularly<br>
preferably greater than 50 nanometers.<br>
The method according to the invention, or the corresponding<br>
device according to the invention, may furthermore be<br>
integrated into a production and/or treatment line. Thus,<br>
the plasma treatment can already achieve advantageous<br>
properties on the workpiece within the process line, which<br>
are directly manifested within the subsequent process line<br>
for example by obviating further treatment steps or by a<br>
better achievable yield, for example a sterile or scratch-<br>
resistant surface. The invention is suitable in particular<br>
for the various types of pharmaceutical packaging. For<br>
instance, the cavity of the workpiece may also particularly<br>
advantageously be sterilized during the plasma treatment.<br>
The plasma treatment may also serve the sole purpose of<br>
sterilization in this case. If the cavities of the<br>
workpieces are sterilized, then in an advantageous<br>
refinement of the invention the plasma treatment may also<br>
be followed by further processing steps in a sterile<br><br>
11<br>
environment. These may extend up to the form of the<br>
workpieces ready for dispatch or--sale, for example filling<br>
the workpieces with medicaments and/or sterilely packaging<br>
them.<br>
For such integration of the method according to the<br>
invention into a production line to produce packaged<br>
pharmaceutical products, a production or treatment line may<br>
for example contain the following steps: production of the<br>
workpiece (for example injection molding, blow molding, hot<br>
molding, for example in the hot molding of raw glass),<br>
cleaning the workpiece, plasma treatment, siliconizing,<br>
filling, sterilizing, packaging. In another advantageous<br>
embodiment of the invention, additional sterilization may<br>
also be obviated if the sterilization achieved by the<br>
plasma treatment is already sufficient and the subsequent<br>
steps take place in a sterile environment.<br>
The plasma treatment according to the invention offers an<br>
advantage even before use of the product (i.e. for example<br>
before use of a prefilled syringe or opening the<br>
packaging), particularly preferably already within the<br>
industrial manufacturing line, since inter alia at least<br>
one of the properties: storage stability of the product<br>
with which the packaging is filled, sterility or scratch<br>
resistance, can be improved.<br>
In particular for the plasma treatment of pharmaceutical<br>
containers as well, it has proven advantageous to generate<br>
a pulsed plasma for the plasma treatment. To this end, the<br>
instrument for injecting electromagnetic energy into the<br>
cavity comprises an instrument for generating pulsed<br>
electromagnetic energy. Using a pulsed plasma, process<br><br>
12<br>
waste gases can be discharged in the pulse pauses. In this<br>
way, for example during plasma coating, it is possible to<br>
prevent sizeable particles of the coating material from<br>
being formed in the plasma and being able to deposit on the<br>
surface of the cavity of the workpiece. Substantially<br>
higher peak powers can furthermore be used compared with a<br>
continuous plasma, which in turn accelerates or<br>
substantially improves the sterilization.<br>
Particularly for small pharmaceutical packaging with narrow<br>
cross sections, it has surprisingly been found that uniform<br>
coating is not necessarily achieved only when the<br>
electromagnetic energy can penetrate through the cavity<br>
with minimal impediment. Rather, it has been found that at<br>
least local shielding may be provided, which encloses the<br>
workpiece and locally shields zones of the cavity of the<br>
workpiece against injected electromagnetic energy. The<br>
shielding can prevent a particularly hot plasma from being<br>
formed locally in the cavity, which may detrimentally<br>
affect the coating and in particular the workpiece.<br>
In order to improve the product properties of<br>
pharmaceutical packaging in particular, at least one<br>
barrier layer is particularly preferably deposited by the<br>
plasma treatment. Such a barrier layer may be a barrier<br>
against ingress or egress of gases such as oxygen, hydrogen<br>
or C02. It is furthermore possible to deposit at least one<br>
barrier layer which has a barrier effect against<br>
constituents from the workpiece, for example initial or<br>
byproduct or final compounds from the production of the<br>
workpiece. For instance, a suitable barrier layer may<br>
prevent or at least retard the migration of substances from<br>
the substrate. The ion leaching of glasses or the<br><br>
13<br>
dissolving of substances from polymers, for example from<br>
plastic containers, may also be avoided or retarded. At<br>
least one barrier layer with a chemical barrier effect may<br>
furthermore be deposited.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention relates to a device<br>
and a method for the internal plasma treatment of syringe<br>
bodies. Owing to their generally elongate cylindrical shape<br>
and the attached Luer cone or nozzle, onto which the<br>
cannula is fitted, these are difficult to coat. By means of<br>
the invention, in which the process gas essentially flows<br>
in an axial direction through the syringe body, it is<br>
however possible to achieve good, uniform results in the<br>
plasma treatment.<br>
Owing to the very narrow cross sections of syringes,<br>
especially in the region of the Luer cone or the nozzle,<br>
(internal) coating of syringes is a technical challenge<br>
which has not been resolved by the prior art to date.<br>
Ignition of a plasma in the narrow cross section, and<br>
uniform coating, have not yet been achieved by conventional<br>
coating technology owing to the narrow cross sections.<br>
Particularly in embodiments of syringes with asymmetric<br>
cross sections, for example with a geometry in which the<br>
mid-axes of the nozzle and the cylinder body are mutually<br>
offset laterally, the technical challenge is particularly<br>
great.<br>
It is in this case particularly expedient for the cavity of<br>
the syringe to be evacuated through its plunger opening. To<br>
this end, a device according to this embodiment of the<br>
invention accordingly comprises a connection instrument to<br><br>
14<br>
connect an evacuation instrument onto the plunger opening<br>
of the syringe.<br>
In order to achieve an inventive flow of the process gas<br>
through in the axial direction, it is furthermore<br>
particularly advantageous for the process gas to be<br>
delivered through the Luer cone on the opposite side from<br>
the plunger opening, or through the nozzle. The reverse<br>
configuration is nevertheless also possible, in which case<br>
the process gas is accordingly delivered through the<br>
plunger opening of the syringe body.<br>
It may furthermore be expedient to carry out external<br>
coating of the workpiece. To this end, a device which is<br>
adapted for external coating of workpieces accordingly<br>
comprises an instrument for at least partially evacuating<br>
the surroundings of a workpiece in the reactor chamber.<br>
Like internal coating, the external coating may also be<br>
carried out by plasma coating. In this case, an instrument<br>
is provided for introducing process gas into the vicinity<br>
of the workpiece in the reactor chamber. Other coating<br>
methods, in particular PVD methods, for instance sputtering<br>
or evaporation coating, may nevertheless also be used.<br>
Possible functional layers are for example scratch<br>
protection layers, or hard material layers. Such functional<br>
layers are advantageous for example in the case of very<br>
scratch-sensitive cyclo-olefinic polymers and copolymers.<br>
Absorbent or reflective coatings for particular<br>
wavelengths, preferably in the IR, visible or UV ranges,<br>
may furthermore be deposited. Inter alia, these may also<br>
have a decorative effect.<br><br>
15<br>
Many substrates, in particular plastics, age under exposure<br>
to ultraviolet light. Applying a selective reflection layer<br>
against UV irradiation or a UV absorber layer on the outer<br>
surface of the substrate makes it possible to prevent<br>
degradation of the substrate. A further applied scratch<br>
protection layer may protect the optical functional layer<br>
and the substrate against scratching. In a refinement of<br>
the invention, a UV reflecting and/or absorbing layer,<br>
which protects the content of the workpiece or the<br>
workpiece per se against degradation by ultraviolet light,<br>
may accordingly be deposited internally and/or externally.<br>
According to another refinement of the invention, a<br>
coloring layer, preferably a blue-colored layer is<br>
deposited. Pharmaceutical products are often radiation-<br>
sterilized, for example with gamma radiation. Owing to the<br>
irradiation, the substrate (for example plastic or glass)<br>
changes its color impression. For example, plastics often<br>
experience yellowish discoloration under gamma irradiation.<br>
According to the prior art a dye, for example a blue dye,<br>
is therefore added to the plastic in order to compensate<br>
for this discoloration by a green hue which is acceptable<br>
on the market. According to the invention, this dye may be<br>
at least partially or entirely replaced by an optional<br>
functional layer, for example a layer design which causes a<br>
blue color impression, so as to similarly compensate for<br>
the yellow color impression after irradiation and<br>
discoloration of the plastic, or so that the color<br>
perception becomes much less than in the case of dyed<br>
plastics.<br><br>
16<br>
In order inter alia to obtain a more attractive appearance,<br>
a mirroring or blooming layer may furthermore be deposited.<br>
Like a coloring layer which reflects UV or infrared light,<br>
such a layer may also be deposited as a multilayer<br>
dielectric interference layer system.<br>
The invention may very advantageously be used to treat a<br>
plastic surface of the workpiece, preferably a plastic<br>
workpiece. Plastics are being used more and more for<br>
pharmaceutical packaging, although in respect of various<br>
properties plastics are inferior for example compared with<br>
glass. For instance, the barrier properties of plastic are<br>
not comparable with glass, and plastics are more difficult<br>
to print on or coat with other plastics. These<br>
disadvantages may however be compensated for by suitable<br>
plasma treatments, in particular the deposition of suitable<br>
coatings or activation of the surfaces. Plastic surfaces of<br>
workpieces, which contain at least one of the following<br>
materials, are preferably treated: polycyclic hydrocarbons,<br>
for example cyclic polymers or copolymers, preferably<br>
cyclopolyolefinic copolymers or polymers, particularly<br>
preferably COC, preferably Topas® or COP (cyclo-olefinic<br>
polymer), in particular Zeonor®, polycarbonates, preferably<br>
autoclavable polycarbonates such as Apec® or particularly<br>
preferably Makrolon®, polyesters such as polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET) or PETG (glycol-modified PET<br>
copolyester), polystyrene, polyethylene such as MDPE<br>
(medium density polyethylene), but in particular HDPE (high<br>
density polyethylene) or LDPE (low density polyethylene),<br>
polypropylene and oriented polypropylene (o-PP), or<br>
biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), polymethyl<br>
methacrylate, PES (polyether sulfone), polyethylene<br>
naphthalate (PEN), SAN (styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer),<br><br>
17<br>
polymers containing fluorine, preferably<br>
polychlorotrif luoroethylenes (PCT-FE) , particularly<br>
preferably Aclar®, EVOH, polyamide, preferably Nylon6®,<br>
PVC, PVDC (polyvinylidene chloride), PMMI, PA, ABS, MABS,<br>
PMP, PSI.<br>
Glass workpieces or glass surfaces of workpieces may also<br>
be plasma-treated by the invention. Glasses containing<br>
alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals or aluminum are<br>
preferred in this case, preferably borosilicate glasses,<br>
for instance Fiolax glass, and metallurgical glass, for<br>
example soda-lime glass. Besides glass workpieces, it is<br>
also possible to plasma-treat glass-ceramic or ceramic<br>
workpieces.<br>
The device according to the invention is preferably adapted<br>
so that it can be integrated into a production line. In<br>
particular, the device may be operated at least partially<br>
in a sterile environment. In a further configuration, the<br>
device comprises a plurality of coating locations. These<br>
may be configured in a mobile fashion, so that the<br>
workpieces are inserted into reactors at a delivery<br>
position, the reactors are transported on a transport path<br>
to an extraction position and extracted there, the<br>
workpieces being plasma-treated between the delivery and<br>
extraction positions. Accordingly, a device for this<br>
configuration of the invention comprises reactors mobile<br>
along a transport path for the plasma treatment of<br>
workpieces, a delivery position for delivering the<br>
workpieces to the reactors, an extraction position for<br>
extracting the workpieces from the reactors, and a plasma<br>
treatment instrument between the delivery and extraction<br>
positions having an instrument for injecting<br><br>
18<br>
electromagnetic energy into the cavity. The device is<br>
preferably configured as a rotary machine or as a linear<br>
machine. In the case of a rotary machine, the reactors are<br>
conveyed on a revolving transport path, for example on a<br>
carousel, while in the case of a linear machine the<br>
reactors are transported in a straight line between the<br>
delivery and extraction positions.<br>
In order to be able to carry out simultaneous plasma<br>
treatment of a plurality of workpieces, in such a<br>
multilocation treatment device it has proven highly<br>
advantageous for the plurality of coating locations<br>
respectively to comprise separate energy sources for the<br>
provision of electromagnetic energy. It is also favorable<br>
for the device to comprise separate antechambers for the<br>
coating locations, which are connected to the coating zones<br>
and are joined to a common vacuum generation instrument,<br>
preferably through a further chamber, in which case<br>
instruments for exciting the process gas, which are<br>
respectively attached to separate second energy sources,<br>
are respectively arranged in the antechambers.<br>
In order to inject electromagnetic energy into the process<br>
gas, according to another configuration of the invention<br>
the instrument for injecting electromagnetic energy<br>
comprises at least one of the instruments:<br>
-	a coaxial cable,<br>
-	a waveguide, preferably a rectangular waveguide,<br>
-	a slot for injection into a coating reactor,<br>
-	an antenna, which can be inserted into the cavity of a<br>
workpiece,<br>
-	a combination of the instruments above, preferably a<br><br>
19<br>
rectangular waveguide and a coaxial cable connected thereto<br>
on the output side.<br>
Since the field distribution is often critical,<br>
particularly in the case of workpieces with a narrow cross<br>
section of the cavity, it is furthermore recommendable to<br>
provide tuning elements for optimizing the injection.<br>
Accordingly, the instrument for injecting electromagnetic<br>
energy furthermore preferably comprises at least one of the<br>
tuning elements: a stub tuner (3-pin tuner), a short-<br>
circuit slider, displaceable components which modify the<br>
electromagnetic field distribution.<br>
The aforementioned tuning elements and injection<br>
instruments are suitable in particular for microwave<br>
sources as energy sources for generating the plasma in the<br>
process gas. Besides a microwave source, it is nevertheless<br>
also possible to use a high-frequency source (HF source) or<br>
radiofrequency source (RF source). Microwaves are in this<br>
case intended to be understood as electromagnetic waves<br>
with a frequency above 1 GHz. For high-frequency sources<br>
(HF source) or radiofrequency sources (RF source),<br>
electrodes may be used to inject electromagnetic energy<br>
into the cavity, in which case energy is injected by<br>
applying an (alternating) current to the electrodes.<br>
Impedance matching instruments, for example a matchbox with<br>
a control circuit and variable impedances (capacitors or<br>
inductors) may also be provided for HF or RF sources.<br>
Inter alia carrier or reaction gases, such as carrier gases<br>
containing oxygen or nitrogen or containing hydrogen,<br>
preferably from the group oxygen, ozone, nitrogen, ammonia,<br>
nitrogen oxides, hydrogen, may be used as process gases.<br><br>
20<br>
In order to deposit coatings, the following process gas<br>
components are preferably used:<br>
inorganic or organic silicon compounds, preferably HMDSO or<br>
HMDSN, or TMDSO or TMCTS or TEOS or TMS or SiCl4, SiH4 or<br>
tetraisocyanatosilane,<br>
organic or inorganic aluminum compounds, preferably<br>
aluminum chloride,<br>
organotitanium compounds, preferably TIPT,<br>
inorganic titanium compounds, preferably TiCl4,<br>
hydrocarbons, preferably acetylene, methane, propane,<br>
butane,<br>
fluorine compounds, preferably fluorinated hydrocarbons,<br>
noble gases such as argon, helium, xenon, krypton.<br>
A device according to the invention in this case preferably<br>
comprises a gas supply instrument having at least two<br>
containers for different gases, the mixture of which is<br>
used for the plasma treatment.<br>
In order to avoid ignition of a plasma in the feed lines to<br>
the reactor chamber, according to a refinement of the<br>
invention a shield for the electromagnetic energy is<br>
provided to decouple the feed line of the reactor chamber<br>
to the evacuation instrument.<br>
In a preferred configuration, the device furthermore<br>
comprises an antechamber before the reactor space, the<br>
evacuation instrument being connected to the antechamber.<br>
With such an antechamber, the device can be adapted rapidly<br>
for different workpieces to be coated by mounting<br>
respectively adapted holding instruments on the<br>
antechamber.<br><br>
21<br>
The device may for example comprise an antechamber or<br>
subspace before the reactor space as a component of the<br>
delivery line. This will then be at least partially<br>
decoupled from the reactor space by the shielding. The<br>
decoupling is carried out for example using an electrically<br>
conductive separating piece. Inter alia a grid or a metal<br>
body with gas inlets is possible for this.<br>
Decoupling means in particular that no energy for the<br>
production/coating process employed reaches the subspace<br>
before the reactor space, or only so little energy that a<br>
plasma cannot be ignited there by the energy source.<br>
Decoupling of the gas source may likewise be carried out.<br>
The gas is discharged into the reactor space, to and<br>
through the antechamber or subspace or otherwise configured<br>
feed lines to the evacuation instrument. After ignition of<br>
the plasma in the cavity of the workpiece, the substance<br>
concentration of the starting gas in the subspace is then<br>
significantly reduced, so that a plasma can no longer be<br>
ignited in the feed lines, particularly in the antechamber.<br>
In general, a combination of shielding the electromagnetic<br>
energy and the gas decrease in the feed lines is used so<br>
that coating can primarily take place only in the reactor<br>
space, i.e. the subspace is coated not at all or<br>
significantly less than the workpiece.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that reliable ignition of<br>
the plasma is achievable by such an ignition instrument,<br>
which is not in fact arranged in the region of the plasma<br>
thereby ignited. Such an ignition instrument may generally<br>
also be used in other reactor types and methods for the<br>
plasma treatment of workpieces. Accordingly, the invention<br><br>
22<br>
also provides a method for the plasma treatment of<br>
workpieces in which at least one zone of a reactor chamber<br>
is at least partially evacuated, a process gas is<br>
introduced into the zone and a plasma is generated by means<br>
of injected electromagnetic energy in the vicinity of at<br>
least a part of the surface of the workpiece in the process<br>
gas being introduced, the plasma being ignited by<br>
excitation of gas in a space separate from the reactor<br>
chamber while the electromagnetic energy for generating the<br>
plasma is injected into the process gas being introduced.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also provides a method for the<br>
plasma treatment of workpieces in which at least one zone<br>
of a reactor chamber is at least partially evacuated, a<br>
process gas is introduced into the zone and a plasma is<br>
generated by means of injected electromagnetic energy in<br>
the vicinity of at least a part of the surface of the<br>
-workpiece in the process gas being introduced, the plasma<br>
being ignited by excitation of gas in a space separate from<br>
the reactor chamber. In particular, the plasma may be<br>
ignited by excitation of gas in a space separate from the<br>
reactor chamber while the electromagnetic energy for<br>
generating the plasma is injected into the process gas<br>
being introduced, in which case the excitation leads to the<br>
formation of energetic species in the form of excited<br>
particles and energetic radiation and assists the ignition<br>
of the plasma.<br>
A corresponding device, in particular for carrying out this<br>
method, accordingly comprises a reactor chamber for<br>
receiving a workpiece to be coated, an instrument for at<br>
least partially evacuating at least one zone of the reactor<br>
chamber, an instrument for injecting electromagnetic energy<br><br>
23<br>
into the reactor chamber as well as a space separate from<br>
the reactor chamber, and an instrument for igniting the<br>
plasma in the reactor chamber, the ignition instrument<br>
comprising an instrument for exciting gas in the space<br>
separate from the reactor chamber.<br>
A glow discharge is preferably ignited in the separate<br>
space in order to ignite the plasma. By means of an<br>
instrument for generating a glow discharge in the space<br>
separate from the reactor space, gas can be highly excited<br>
in a particularly straightforward way. In order to ignite<br>
such a glow discharge, for example, an ignition electrode<br>
may be provided to which a high voltage is preferably<br>
applied as a DC or AC voltage. The voltage is applied<br>
either before the plasma treatment, or at the latest at the<br>
start of the coating, and it leads to ignition of the glow<br>
discharge. This glow discharge on its own does not yet<br>
however ignite a plasma in the reactor; rather, excited<br>
species are provided in the zone in which the plasma is<br>
intended to be ignited. This may be done both by ions,<br>
electrons, excited neutral particles diffusing from the<br>
glow discharge, and by photoionization due to UV light<br>
which results from the glow discharge. Easier ignition of<br>
the plasma is facilitated owing to the free charge<br>
carriers.<br>
Only by applying the energy from the energy source, for<br>
instance a microwave source, does ignition of the plasma<br>
take place. In a refinement of the invention, the glow<br>
discharge may be controlled by a preferably optical<br>
monitoring instrument.<br><br>
24<br>
The glow discharge is in this case preferably ignited by<br>
one of the following parameters:<br>
i) a high voltage in the range of 0.1 kV - 100 kV<br>
ii) an alternating current with a frequency of 0.2 kHz -<br>
100 MHz, preferably 1 kHz - 100 kHz<br>
iii) an rms alternating current in the range of 0.01 mA -<br>
2A, preferably in the range of from 0.1 mA to 500 mA.<br>
The separate space is particularly preferably connected to<br>
the reactor chamber by vacuum technology. This space may in<br>
particular be an antechamber as described above, through<br>
which the reactor chamber is connected to the evacuation<br>
instrument. For separation, shielding may be provided which<br>
prevents microwaves from entering the antechamber and/or<br>
the feed lines to the evacuation instrument.<br>
Roots pumps and rotary disk pumps are preferably used as<br>
components of the evacuation instrument, and also<br>
turbomolecular, oil diffusion or cryo pumps for lower<br>
pressures to be achieved, for instance for PVD coatings.<br>
In order to control the plasma treatment process, in a<br>
refinement of the invention and the light emission of the<br>
antechamber and/or the treatment chamber may be measured.<br>
To this end a photodiode may respectively be used. A<br>
wavelength filter may be used to filter out certain<br>
characteristic emission lines of the plasma or of a glow<br>
charge for igniting the plasma. When workpieces in the form<br>
of hollow bodies are being treated, then the interior of<br>
the workpiece and its surroundings in the reactor chamber<br>
may be monitored separately in the reactor chamber.<br>
Particularly for small workpieces, such as typical<br>
pharmaceutical packaging, a compact arrangement may also be<br><br>
25<br>
selected in which the light emitted by the plasma is sent<br>
through a glass fiber or a glass fiber bundle to an optical<br>
detector.<br>
Particularly for the treatment of small workpieces, for<br>
example pharmaceutical products such as syringe bodies,<br>
vials, blood sampling tubes or carpules, a particularly<br>
compact arrangement may furthermore be achieved when the<br>
instrument for injecting electromagnetic energy into the<br>
reactor chamber comprises a coaxial cable, the coaxial<br>
cable comprising an axially extending channel through which<br>
the process gas can be delivered. At the same time,<br>
therefore, the electromagnetic energy can be delivered<br>
through the coaxial cable and process gas can be delivered<br>
through its inner conductor. Additional arrangement of a<br>
gas delivery may be obviated in this way. In an alternative<br>
refinement of the invention, the electromagnetic energy may<br>
also be injected through a coaxial cable and the treatment<br>
zone may be evacuated through the coaxial cable. In another<br>
configuration another ignition instrument, particularly an<br>
ignition electrode for generating a glow discharge, may<br>
also be provided in the channel through the inner<br>
conductor. It is particularly preferable to arrange the<br>
coaxial cable in the axial direction of the workpiece to be<br>
treated, so that the coaxial cable extends in the axial<br>
direction of the workpiece. In the case of a cylindrical or<br>
quasi-cylindrical workpiece, for instance a syringe body,<br>
the coaxial cable therefore preferably extends in a<br>
direction along the mid-axis of the cylinder of the syringe<br>
body. In this way, a maximally symmetrical field<br>
distribution is accordingly achieved in or on the syringe<br>
body.<br><br>
26<br>
A filler body may furthermore be provided, which at least<br>
partially fills a cavity of a workpiece to be treated. By<br>
at least partially filling a cavity of a workpiece to be<br>
treated with a filler body, the temperature distribution on<br>
the workpiece can be kept more uniform during and after the<br>
plasma treatment, compared with a plasma treatment without<br>
such a filler body. The filler body may at the same time be<br>
a fixing and/or vacuum sealing element for a further cavity<br>
of the workpiece. In some syringe bodies, for example,<br>
there is an edge which encloses the Luer cone or the nozzle<br>
and forms a cavity. Under certain circumstances, an<br>
undesirable plasma may also be formed in this cavity. This<br>
effect can be prevented by such a filler body. In<br>
particular, to this end the filler body may be designed to<br>
absorb or reflect high-frequency electromagnetic energy.<br>
The filler body in this case preferably prevents ignition<br>
of a plasma in the immediate vicinity of the filled zone.<br>
Inter alia polymer, ceramic or metallic materials are<br>
suitable for the filler body - optionally in combination.<br>
At the same time, the filler body may seal the cylinder of<br>
the syringe body as a further cavity and/or fix the<br>
workpiece, so that the filler body acts as a sealing or<br>
fixing element. In particular, such a filler body may be<br>
integrated into a coaxial inner conductor. The filler body<br>
need not be a separate part in this case, and it may also<br>
be formed at least partially by a section of the inner<br>
conductor material. Inter alia rigid polymers, for example<br>
PTFE, POM or polycarbonate are suitable as plastics for the<br>
filler body. If the filler body is also intended to act as<br>
a sealing element, then elastomers such as silicone,<br>
bromobutyl elastomer or polyisoprene-bromobutyl elastomer,<br><br>
27<br>
may in particular also be used in addition or as an<br>
alternative.<br>
Surprisingly, it could furthermore be shown that the plasma<br>
deposition of functional layers on pharmaceutical packaging<br>
with a narrow cross section, for example syringe bodies,<br>
vials, blood sampling tubes or carpules, could be achieved<br>
with very low average powers. In particular, such<br>
containers could be coated in a pulsed plasma with average<br>
powers of at most 3 00 watts, or even at most 10 0 watts.<br>
As an alternative or in addition, the workpiece may also be<br>
cooled by a gas flow during the plasma treatment. If<br>
internal coating is carried out, for example, the workpiece<br>
may be cooled externally by a gas flow - in the simplest<br>
case a flow of air at atmospheric pressure. Also in the<br>
case of external coating, cooling may likewise be carried<br>
out by passing a gas flow through the cavity of the<br>
workpiece.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below with<br>

appended drawings. References which are the same in the<br>

In what follows, a through-flow reactor is intended to mean<br>
a device according to the invention in which a treatment<br>
zone is at least partially evacuated in a reactor chamber,<br>
a process gas is introduced into the cavity of the<br>
workpiece and a plasma is ignited by means of injected<br>
electromagnetic energy in the process gas introduced into<br>
the treatment zone, the process gas flowing through the<br>
treatment zone between opposite ends of the zone during the<br>
plasma treatment.<br>
In the context of the invention, a reverse flow reactor is<br>
furthermore intended to mean a reactor in which the process<br>
gas is put in not at a further opening, opposite to the<br>
opening at the first end connected to the vacuum system,<br>
but inside the cavity to be coated. In this case, however,<br>
the position at which the gas flows in preferably lies at<br>
least 2/3 of the longitudinal extent of the cavity away<br>
from the opening at the first end of the workpiece. The<br>
process gas is in this case preferably put in using a<br>
cannula inserted into the cavity.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic cross section of a through-flow<br>
reactor 1, which is designed for the internal coating of<br>
workpieces in the form of hollow bodies. In particular, the<br>
reactor 1 is adapted for the coating of pharmaceutical<br>
packaging, for instance syringe bodies or carpules. To this<br>
end, Fig. 1 shows a syringe body 10 arranged in the reactor<br>
chamber 2 of the reactor 1. The syringe body 10 comprises a<br>
cylinder 11, which opens into a plunger opening 12 and<br>
encloses a cylindrical cavity 13. At the opposite end of<br>
the cylinder 11 from the plunger opening, it is provided<br>
with a cover element 14 having a second cylindrical or<br>
quasi-cylindrical, for example slightly conical appendage<br><br>
30<br>
with a smaller diameter and a shorter length in the form of<br>
a Luer cone 15 with a second opening 16. When the syringe<br>
is being used, the cannula is fitted onto the Luer cone 15.<br>
The length and height of the Luer cone 15 are preferably at<br>
least 20% less than the maximum diameter and the height of<br>
the syringe body 10. The Luer cone 15 has a narrow,<br>
cannula-like inner diameter of between 0.01 and 15 mm,<br>
particularly preferably between 0.05 and 4 mm.<br>
The device 1 represented in Fig. 1 is designed in<br>
particular for the internal plasma treatment of such<br>
syringe bodies 10. The material of the syringe body 10 at<br>
least locally has dielectric properties in this case. The<br>
syringe body is shaped cylindrically or guasi-<br>
cylindrically, and typically has a maximum outer diameter<br>
of between 1 mm and 50 mm, preferably between 3 mm and 3 0<br>
mm, and a height of from 10 mm to 2 00 mm, preferably from<br>
30 mm to 150 mm.<br>
In this example, the electromagnetic energy for generating<br>
a plasma is delivered by means of a coaxial cable. Fig. 1<br>
showing only the inner conductor 2 0 of the coaxial cable.<br>
Using the inner conductor 20 and a sealing element 22<br>
attached thereto, the syringe body 10 is both fixed and<br>
sealed off from the surrounding regions of the reactor<br>
chamber 2. In this embodiment of the invention, in<br>
particular, the electromagnetic energy is delivered through<br>
the coaxial cable and the process gas is delivered through<br>
an axially extending channel 24 in the inner conductor 20<br>
of the coaxial cable.<br>
The inner conductor 2 0 furthermore presses the syringe body<br>
10 onto a further sealing element 25, which encloses an<br><br>
31<br>
opening 27 in a separating plate 26. By means of the<br>
separating plate 26, the reactor:chamber 2 is separated<br>
from an antechamber 28 connected to an evacuation<br>
instrument (not shown). The sealing element 25 around the<br>
opening 2 7 in the base plate in this case accordingly forms<br>
a connection instrument to connect an evacuation<br>
instrument, for at least partially evacuating the cavity 13<br>
of the workpiece 10, onto the plunger opening of the<br>
syringe.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 1 the cavity of the syringe body<br>
10 is evacuated through an opening at a first end - here<br>
accordingly the plunger opening 12 - and the process gas is<br>
introduced through a further opening, i.e. the opening 16<br>
in the Luer cone 15 - at a second end of the syringe body<br>
10, which lies opposite the first end. During the coating,<br>
the process gas therefore flows through the cavity 13 in an<br>
axial direction along its entire length. Owing to the<br>
axisymmetric arrangement of the Luer cone 15, the cylinder<br>
wall and the plunger opening, an axisymmetric flow of the<br>
process gas takes place through the cavity 13 of the<br>
syringe body 10.<br>
The plasma in the treatment zone, i.e. here the cavity 13,<br>
is furthermore ignited by means of an ignition instrument.<br>
The ignition instrument comprises an instrument for<br>
exciting gas in the antechamber 28 separated from the<br>
reactor chamber. In particular, the ignition instrument is<br>
in this case an ignition electrode 29 arranged in the<br>
antechamber 28, by which a glow discharge is ignited and<br>
gas contained in the antechamber is thereby excited.<br>
Ignition in the coating zone i.e. here the interior of the<br>
syringe body 10, can however take place only if<br><br>
32<br>
electromagnetic energy, for example microwaves with a<br>
frequency of 2.45 GHz, is simultaneously injected through<br>
the coaxial cable. Astonishingly, ignition by the glow<br>
discharge burning in the antechamber 28 takes place even<br>
though the antechamber 2 8 and the reactor chamber are<br>
separated from each other by the separating wall 26, and<br>
the gas flow travels in the opposite direction owing to the<br>
evacuation. Another shield 3 0 for the electromagnetic<br>
energy is furthermore provided to decouple the feed line of<br>
the reactor chamber 2 to the evacuation instrument, which<br>
suppresses entry of the electromagnetic waves into the<br>
antechamber 28 in order to avoid ignition of a plasma in<br>
this region. Ignition by means of the glow discharge is<br>
unaffected, or at least not substantially affected, even by<br>
such shielding. A monitoring instrument 23 may<br>
advantageously be used to check whether a glow discharge<br>
has been ignited. It may for example comprise one or more<br>
photodiodes, which optically record the light of the glow<br>
discharge.<br>
Figs 2 and 3 represent alternative arrangements of a<br>
through-flow reactor 1 as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In the example represented in Fig. 2, the process gas is<br>
likewise delivered through the Luer cone 15, i.e. the<br>
narrower of the two openings 12, 16. The connection<br>
instrument for connecting the treatment zone in this<br>
embodiment of the invention, here likewise the interior 13<br>
of the syringe body 10, comprises a connection element 31<br>
connected to the inner conductor 20 of a coaxial cable and<br>
having a sealing element 25, which seals the plunger<br>
opening 12 of the syringe body 10 off from the rest of the<br>
reactor space 2. The process gas is accordingly not<br><br>
33<br>
delivered through the coaxial cable in this case, rather it<br>
is discharged, and the interior of the syringe is<br>
evacuated, through this.<br>
In the example represented in Fig. 3, the electromagnetic<br>
energy is fed through with a waveguide 33, preferably a<br>
rectangular waveguide and a gap 34 opening into the reactor<br>
space 2, instead of a coaxial cable. A dielectric tube<br>
seals the inner part of the reactor chamber 2 with the<br>
syringe body 10 off from the outer part, while the<br>
electromagnetic waves emerging from the gap 34 can pass<br>
through the tube 36. Instead of or in addition to the<br>
dielectric tube 36, it is also possible to use a dielectric<br>
window in the gap 34. The injection of electromagnetic<br>
waves takes place not in the axial direction of the syringe<br>
body 10 here, but instead laterally. An HF or RF source is<br>
preferably used in conjunction with the waveguide.<br>
The Luer cone 15 of the syringe body 10 is connected<br>
hermetically by a connection element 31 and a sealing<br>
element 22 to a gas supply. In other regards, the structure<br>
with an antechamber 28 connected to an evacuation<br>
instrument, an ignition electrode 29 and a shield 30, is<br>
similar to the example represented in Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a variant of a through-flow reactor 1 for the<br>
external coating of workpieces. Here again a syringe body<br>
10 is represented as a workpiece to be coated, although<br>
other types of workpieces, even workpieces not in the form<br>
of hollow bodies, may also be plasma-treated, in particular<br>
plasma-coated by such an arrangement. For the external<br>
coating, the syringe body is sealed off both at the plunger<br>
opening and at the Luer cone by sealing elements 42 and 44,<br><br>
34<br>
respectively, from the rest of the reactor space 2 which in<br>
this case constitutes the treatment zone. In particular,<br>
the cavity 13 of the syringe body 10 may remain at<br>
atmospheric pressure during a plasma treatment, while the<br>
surrounding reactor space 2 is evacuated through the<br>
evacuation instrument connected to the antechamber 28.<br>
In this example, the antechamber 2 8 is separated from the<br>
reactor space 2 not by a separating wall, but only by a<br>
shield 30.<br>
The process gas is introduced into the treatment zone via<br>
two or more supply channels 3 8 with gas distributors 3 9<br>
connected thereto, and it is sucked through the shield 3 0<br>
and the antechamber 28 by the evacuation instrument. The<br>
electromagnetic energy is delivered from the same direction<br>
as the process gas in this example. A dielectric window 4 0<br>
seals the reactor chamber 2 hermetically, but transparently<br>
for the electromagnetic waves being introduced. In this<br>
example as well, the process gas flows through the<br>
treatment zone between two opposite ends.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a variant of the example represented in Fig.<br>
4. In this variant, the process gas for an external<br>
treatment, for example external coating of the workpiece,<br>
is delivered laterally. To this end lateral openings 46 are<br>
formed in the reactor chamber 2, and they are provided with<br>
shields 4 8 against entry of the electromagnetic waves into<br>
the gas delivery system. As an alternative or in addition,<br>
the shields may also act as gas distributors.<br>
The variant represented in Fig. 6 is again designed as a<br>
through-flow reactor. The gas delivery and the vacuum<br><br>
35<br>
system with an antechamber 2 8 and a shield 3 0 correspond to<br>
the example represented in Fig. 4. In contrast to the<br>
example shown in Fig. 4, however, microwave energy is<br>
delivered through a coaxial cable 19 with an inner<br>
conductor 20 and an outer conductor 21. The syringe body is<br>
connected hermetically by means of a sealing element 25 to<br>
the waveguide 19 by the plunger opening 12. An antenna 50,<br>
which is inserted into the cavity 13 of the syringe body<br>
10, is connected to the inner conductor 2 0 of the waveguide<br>
19. The antenna 50 ensures better introduction and more<br>
homogeneous distribution of the electromagnetic fields.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a reactor 1, which is designed both for<br>
internal and for external coating of the syringe body 10.<br>
The internal coating is carried out in this case with a<br>
process gas flowing through between opposite ends of the<br>
inner treatment zone, i.e. the cavity 13 of the syringe<br>
body. In particular, the Luer cone 15 of the syringe body<br>
10 is filled with the process gas for the internal coating<br>
through a connection element 31 with a supply channel and a<br>
sealing element 22, and it is sucked out again at the<br>
opposite end, i.e. the plunger opening 12. To this end the<br>
plunger opening 12 is connected by a sealing element 25 to<br>
a tube 52, which extends through the antechamber 28 and is<br>
connected to a first evacuation instrument "Vacuum 1". In<br>
order to suppress entry of the electromagnetic fields into<br>
the tube, a separate shield 32 is arranged in the tube.<br>
The gas delivery and discharge for the process gas for an<br>
external treatment, introduced into the surroundings of the<br>
syringe in the reactor space, and the delivery of<br>
electromagnetic energy through a vacuum-tight window 4 0<br><br>
36<br>
which is transparent for RF, HF or microwaves, correspond<br>
here to the example shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a variant of a through-flow reactor similar to<br>
the examples shown in Fig. 1 or 3. Process gas flows in the<br>
axial direction through cavity 13 of the syringe body 10<br>
between the Luer cone 15 and the plunger opening 12, as in<br>
the examples shown in Fig. 1 or 3. Instead of injecting the<br>
electromagnetic energy through coaxial cables or waveguides<br>
as in the example shown in Fig. 8, however, an<br>
electromagnetic field is generated between two electrodes<br>
56, 58 which are connected to a high-frequency generator<br>
54. One or more other tuning elements 6 0 may be provided in<br>
addition. The reactor chamber may, as in this example, be<br>
formed by the cavity 13 of the syringe body 10 itself.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a variant of the arrangement shown in Fig. 8<br>
which is adapted for external coating of workpieces, such<br>
as the syringe body 10 depicted. This variant is also<br>
designed as a through-flow reactor, the process gas being<br>
introduced into the treatment zone on one side of the<br>
reactor chamber 2 through two or more supply channels 38<br>
with gas distributors 39 connected thereto, and it is<br>
sucked out again through openings arranged in the opposite<br>
separating plate between the reactor chamber 2 and the<br>
antechamber 28. The side walls of the reactor chamber are<br>
formed by a dielectric tube 36, or may alternatively<br>
comprise dielectric wall elements, so that the high-<br>
frequency field radiated by the electrodes 56, 58 can<br>
penetrate through the reactor space 2. The cavity 13 of the<br>
syringe is sealed by sealing elements 42, 44 and may be<br>
kept at atmospheric pressure while the treatment zone, i.e.<br><br>
37<br>
the regions of the reactor chamber 2 which enclose the<br>
syringe body 10, is evacuated.<br>
Figs 10a and 10b show two variants of reverse flow<br>
reactors. The reactor shown in Fig. 10a is similar in<br>
structure to the through-flow reactor shown in Fig. 1. In<br>
contrast to the example shown in Fig. 1, however, the<br>
process gas is not introduced into the cavity 13 through<br>
the Luer cone 15. Rather, the Luer cone is sealed off from<br>
the rest of the reactor chamber 2 by a sealing element in<br>
this example. The delivery of process gas takes place<br>
through a cannula 64 here, which penetrates through the<br>
plunger opening 12 into the cavity 13. The cannula<br>
protrudes into the syringe body by at least 3/4, preferably<br>
9/10, particularly preferably 95/100 of the longitudinal<br>
extent of the cavity 13.<br>
Regions of the cavity 13 are also locally shielded at least<br>
partially against the injected electromagnetic energy by<br>
means of a metal shield enclosing the base of the syringe<br>
body with the plunger opening. This prevents a particularly<br>
hot-burning plasma, which may damage the syringe body 10,<br>
from being able to form locally at this position. This<br>
measure may of course also be used in the other embodiments<br>
represented in the figures.<br>
The example shown in Fig. 10b represents a reactor which is<br>
adapted for internal and external coating of syringe bodies<br>
10. The reactor resembles the example shown in Fig. 7 in<br>
its structure, the process gas for the internal treatment<br>
being delivered through a cannula 64 protruding into the<br>
cavity 13 in the example shown in Fig. 10b.<br><br>
38<br>
Fig. 15 shows details of a reactor with delivery of<br>
electromagnetic energy through a coaxial cable. The outer<br>
conductor is not represented for the sake of simplicity.<br>
The inner conductor 2 0 comprises an axially extending<br>
channel 70, through which process gas can be introduced via<br>
the opening 16 into the cavity or interior 13 of the<br>
syringe body 10. In order to establish a hermetic<br>
connection to the opening 16 of the Luer cone 15, an<br>
internal sealing element 72 sealing the channel 70 is<br>
provided. This, like the other sealing elements, is<br>
preferably made of flexible material, in particular<br>
elastomer material such as silicone rubber, bromobutyl<br>
elastomer or polyisoprene-bromobutyl elastomer.<br>
Such a coaxial cable may then be used for example for the<br>
reactor represented in Fig. 1. The treatment zone may<br>
nevertheless also be evacuable through the coaxial cable,<br>
in which case the axially extending channel 70 will be<br>
connected to an evacuation instrument.<br>
In this example, the syringe body 10 also comprises a<br>
further cavity 80 which is formed between an edge 82<br>
encircling the cover element 14 of the syringe body and the<br>
Luer cone 15. This cavity can be pumped out only with<br>
difficulty. An undesirable plasma may therefore also be<br>
formed in this cavity 80 when electromagnetic waves are<br>
injected for the plasma coating. In order to avoid this,<br>
the inner conductor 2 0 comprises an integrated filler body<br>
84 which is inserted into the cavity 80 when fitting the<br>
inner conductor 2 0 and fixing the syringe body 10, and at<br>
least partially fills it. The filler body 84 may for<br>
example be made of a dielectric material such as plastic,<br><br>
39<br>
or polymers, or ceramic or even metallic material, in order<br>
to absorb or reflect high-frequency electromagnetic energy<br>
and thus prevent ignition of a plasma in the immediate<br>
vicinity of the filled zone. The filler body 84 makes the<br>
temperature distribution on the workpiece more uniform<br>
during and after the plasma treatment, compared with a<br>
plasma treatment without such a filler body.<br>
The inner conductor 2 0 furthermore comprises another collar<br>
86, which encloses the cylinder 11 of the syringe body 10<br>
along a part of its axial length. This collar acts as<br>
shielding, in order to shield regions of the cavity of the<br>
workpiece locally against injected electromagnetic energy.<br>
This prevents too hot a plasma from burning in the narrow<br>
Luer cone 15, which may damage the workpiece.<br>
In the variant represented in Fig. 12, the filler body 84<br>
simultaneously forms a sealing element for sealing off the<br>
cavity 13 and hermetically connecting to the channel 70.<br>
The filler body 84 is preferably made of elastomer material<br>
in this case, in particular silicone rubber, bromobutyl<br>
elastomer or polyisoprene-bromobutyl elastomer.<br>
In the further variant shown in Fig. 13, a separate sealing<br>
element 74 is provided similarly as in the example<br>
represented in Fig. 11. In contrast to the example<br>
represented in Fig. 11, however, the annular sealing<br>
element 74 is in this case placed not on the Luer cone 15<br>
but on the circumferential edge 82.<br>
The filler body 84 is not a separate part in the variant<br>
shown in Fig. 14, rather it is formed by a section of the<br>
inner conductor material itself.<br><br>
40<br>
Fig. 15 shows an exemplary embodiment of the coating with a<br>
reverse flow reactor, such as is represented for example in<br>
Fig. 10a. The cannula for delivering the process gas is not<br>
represented in this example for the sake of simplicity.<br>
The inner conductor comprises a cavity 88, which is formed<br>
by a collar 86 as in the previous examples. The syringe<br>
body 10 is inserted with the Luer cone 15 into the cavity,<br>
so that the collar 86 partially encloses the cylinder 11<br>
and partially shields the region of the cavity 13 in the<br>
Luer cone 15. The opening 16 in the Luer cone 15 is sealed<br>
by a sealing element 44 as in the example shown in Fig.<br>
10a. Filling of the cavity 80 may be obviated in this<br>
example, since the environment of the syringe body 10<br>
remains at atmospheric pressure and it is evacuated only<br>
internally.<br>
Fig. 16 shows an exemplary embodiment of a device according<br>
to the invention designed as a multilocation coating<br>
system. A multilocation coating system, such as is<br>
represented as an example in Fig. 16, may be adapted for<br>
simultaneously coating a plurality of workpieces. The<br>
example shown in Fig. 16 comprises in particular four<br>
reactors 100, although two or more reactors may for example<br>
also be used. The reactors are preferably designed as<br>
through-flow reactors. The system comprises a supply source<br>
100 with a control instrument for providing a fluid or<br>
fluid mixture, preferably of two different fluids, or<br>
process gas mixtures. In this way, for example, an adhesion<br>
promoter coating and a barrier coating may sequentially be<br>
deposited by means of plasma coating. The gases or gas<br>
mixtures provided by the supply source 110 may be<br><br>
41<br>
introduced separately into the reactors 100 through the<br>
valves 112 on the reactors. In-order to provide the fluid<br>
mixtures, the supply instrument comprises a plurality of<br>
gas containers 95 which are connected by mass flow<br>
regulators 97 to two control valves 99. The reactors 100<br>
with the coating locations respectively comprise separate<br>
energy sources 101. This prevents cross-contamination<br>
during the simultaneous coating. A separate antechamber 2 8<br>
with an ignition instrument (not shown) is furthermore<br>
provided for each reactor 100. The ignition instrument is<br>
preferably an ignition electrode as represented in Fig. 1.<br>
The ignition instruments are in turn likewise equipped with<br>
respectively separate energy sources for exciting the glow<br>
discharge in the respective antechambers. This also<br>
prevents cross-contamination between the reactors. The<br>
antechambers 28, and therefore also the reactors 100, are<br>
connected together through a further chamber 105 to a<br>
vacuum generation instrument, which reduces the equipment<br>
outlay without causing cross-contamination during<br>
simultaneous coating. A regulating instrument 92 regulates<br>
the pump power of the instrument 90. In order to monitor<br>
the evacuation and the process gas decrease, pressure<br>
meters 93 are provided in the common chamber 105 and in the<br>
feed line to the vacuum generation instrument 90.<br>
The invention will be further explained below with the aid<br>
of exemplary embodiments of coating methods.<br>
In the exemplary embodiments presented below, a glow<br>
discharge, which does not yet lead to layer deposition on<br>
the substrate, is initially ignited in a subspace. Only by<br>
injecting high-frequency energy into the coating chamber is<br>
the plasma ignited in the coating reactor by means of this<br><br>
42<br>
glow discharge. In said examples, a current in the range of<br>
5 mA - 50 mA and a frequency in the range of 10 - 2 5 kHz<br>
are used for the glow discharge. The glow discharge is<br>
current-regulated'. The high voltage used lies between 0.5 -<br>
2 kV.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment la: PECVD method, internal coating<br>
with through-flow reactor<br>
A syringe made of COC (cyclic olefinic copolymer), 1 ml<br>
volume with a cylinder height of 54 mm and a cylinder inner<br>
diameter of 6.5 mm, a total height of 64.5 mm and a Luer<br>
cone according to DIN 594 with a length of 10 mm and with<br>
an internal opening diameter of 2 mm is put in the reactor<br>
described in Fig. 1 with the large cross section downward<br>
and the narrow cross section (Luer cone) upward. The<br>
syringe initially rests on the sealing surface on the lower<br>
side of the reactor. The upper side of the reactor is<br>
subsequently lowered, and the syringe is hermetically<br>
sealed on the upper side when the reactor is closed. The<br>
counterpressure ensures that the syringe also rests<br>
hermetically on the lower side. The interior of the syringe<br>
is subsequently evacuated until a base pressure 
is reached. The exterior remains at atmospheric pressure<br>
throughout the treatment process. While the connection to<br>
the vacuum at the lower side is maintained, the gas inlet<br>
valve is opened and a first gas mixture of oxygen and<br>
hexamethyldisiloxane with an HMDSO flow rate of 3.4 seem<br>
and an oxygen flow rate of 16.6 seem at a pressure of 0.55<br>
mbar is introduced through the side with the narrow cross<br>
section, i.e. at the Luer cone of the syringe. In this<br>
through-flow operation, a continuous flow is set up in<br>
which the gas flows parallel to the symmetry axis from the<br><br>
43<br>
narrow cross section to the wide cross section. A glow<br>
discharge is ignited in the subspace by means of the<br>
ignition device, although this does not yet lead to layer<br>
deposition on the inside of the syringe. A plasma is not<br>
ignited in the interior of the syringe until the time at<br>
which pulsed microwave energy is input into the reactor<br>
space from the microwave source with a frequency of 2.45<br>
GHz and an average pulse power of 57 watts through the<br>
waveguide, while no plasma is ignited externally owing to<br>
the atmospheric pressure.<br>
During the process, the syringe is coated internally with a<br>
first adhesion promoter layer for a first coating time of<br>
1.0 s and with an average layer thickness of 40 nm. Toward<br>
the end of the first coating, the microwave energy is<br>
turned off. This is followed by a gas change phase, during<br>
which a second gas mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO)<br>
and oxygen with an HMDSO flow rate of 0.2 seem and an<br>
oxygen flow rate of 39.8 seem at a pressure of 0.8 mbar is<br>
fed into the interior of the syringe.<br>
As soon as pulsed microwave energy is introduced into the<br>
reactor space from the microwave source with a frequency of<br>
2.45 GHz and with an average microwave power of 3 0.8 W<br>
through the waveguide, a plasma is ignited internally in<br>
the syringe and a second inorganic barrier layer is applied<br>
for a second coating time of 55.4 s and with an average<br>
layer thickness of 30 nm. Toward the end of the coating<br>
process, the microwave energy is turned off and the supply<br>
of process gas is terminated. In a cooling phase, the<br>
coating is terminated and the syringe is cooled to room<br>
temperature. After re-evacuation, a 3rd inorganic barrier<br>
layer is subsequently applied with the same process<br><br>
44<br>
parameters and the same average layer thickness of 3 0 run,<br>
so that the total average barrier thickness is 6 0 nm.<br>
Toward the end of the process, the interior of the syringe<br>
is flushed to atmospheric pressure.<br>
The coated syringes exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.0018<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar) at 23°C and 50% rel. humidity, while<br>
uncoated syringes have an oxygen permeation of 0.0074<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar), so that the barrier improvement for<br>
oxygen is better than a factor of 4.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment lb: Through-flow reactor, coating of<br>
the Luer cone:<br>
A 1 ml COC syringe is coated internally in the through-flow<br>
reactor similarly as in Example la.<br>
Step 1:<br>
A first gas mixture of oxygen and hexamethyldisiloxane with<br>
an HMDSO flow rate of 3.4 seem and an oxygen flow rate of<br>
16.6 seem at a pressure of 0.55 mbar is introduced at the<br>
Luer cone of the syringe. A glow discharge is ignited in<br>
the subspace by means of the ignition device, although this<br>
does not yet lead to layer deposition on the inside of the<br>
syringe. A plasma is not ignited in the interior of the<br>
syringe until the time at which pulsed microwave energy is<br>
input into the reactor space from the microwave source with<br>
a frequency of 2.45 GHz and an average pulse power of 57<br>
watts through the waveguide, while no plasma is ignited<br>
externally owing to the atmospheric pressure. During the<br>
process, the syringe is coated internally with a first<br>
adhesion promoter layer for a first coating time of 0.9 s.<br><br>
45<br>
Toward the end of the first coating, the microwave energy-<br>
is turned off.<br>
Step 2:<br>
This is followed by a gas change phase, during which a<br>
second gas mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) and<br>
oxygen with an HMDSO flow rate of 0.6 seem and an oxygen<br>
flow rate of 3 9.4 seem at a pressure of 0.15 mbar is fed<br>
into the interior of the syringe. As soon as pulsed<br>
microwave energy is introduced into the reactor space from<br>
the microwave source with a frequency of 2.45 GHz and with<br>
an average microwave power of 3 0.8 W through the waveguide,<br>
a plasma is ignited internally in the syringe and a second<br>
inorganic barrier layer is applied for a second coating<br>
time of 47 s.<br>
Toward the end of the coating process, the microwave energy<br>
is turned off and the supply of process gas is terminated.<br>
In a cooling phase, the syringe body is flushed internally<br>
with nitrogen and subsequently re-evacuated. Step 2 is<br>
subsequently repeated while maintaining the same coating<br>
time. Toward the end of the process, the interior of the<br>
syringe is flushed to atmospheric pressure.<br>
By means of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth<br>
profiling, the syringe body coated in this way was examined<br>
at 3 positions. To this end, Figs 17 to 19 show the SIMS<br>
intensity-sputter time profiles at three different<br>
positions of the coated syringe body. Fig. 17 shows such a<br>
profile in the region of the large-diameter opening<br>
("Position 15 mm"), Fig. 18 shows such a profile in the<br>
region of the middle of the syringe cylinder ("Position 40<br>
mm") and Fig. 19 shows such a profile in the narrow channel<br><br>
46<br>
of the Luer cone of the syringe ("Position 59 mm"). The<br>
profiles for the elements/compounds C, Si, 02 and the C8<br>
chain are represented. The junction of the layer system<br>
with the substrate can be seen with the aid of the<br>
intensity drop in the Si and 0 sputter time profiles. The<br>
different shapes for the C and C8 sputter time profiles are<br>
due to the adhesion promoter layer containing carbon.<br>
Based on the data of the depth profilings as represented in<br>
Figs 17 to 19, the relative local layer thickness of the<br>
overall system is determined. To this end the sputter time<br>
x in which the Si or O SIMS-sputter time profiles in the<br>
layer have fallen to half intensity is determined. The<br>
relative, normalized layer thickness drel is given by the<br>
ratio of the times xx and xref which are found:<br>
drei = Di /D„£ = TiA^,<br>
where D1 and Dref correspond to the absolute local layer<br>
thicknesses. The "Position 40 mm" was selected as a<br>
reference position in this case.<br>
The following are obtained as relative thicknesses:<br><br>
Position	Relative thickness drel<br>
(%)<br>
15 mm (opening)	60<br>
4 0 mm (middle)	100<br>
59 mm (Luer cone)	93<br>
In particular, these analyses reveal that the narrow Luer<br>
channel of the syringe can be coated internally and that a<br>
very good layer uniformity is achieved in the through-flow<br>
reactor: the thickness difference between the Luer cone (59<br><br>
47<br>
mm) and the middle of the cylinder (40 mm) is only<br>
93%/l00%.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment lc: PECVD method, internal coating<br>
with through-flow reactor, multiple alternating layers<br>
i) Layer System I:<br>
A syringe made of COC (cyclic olefinic copolymer), 1 ml<br>
volume with a cylinder height of 54 mm and a cylinder inner<br>
diameter of 6.5 mm, a total height of 64.5 mm and a Luer<br>
cone according to DIN 594 with a length of 10 mm and with<br>
an internal opening diameter of 2 mm is put in the reactor<br>
described in Fig. 1 with the large cross section downward<br>
and the narrow cross section (Luer cone) upward. The<br>
syringe initially rests on the sealing surface on the lower<br>
side of the reactor. The upper side of the reactor is<br>
subsequently lowered, and the syringe is hermetically<br>
sealed on the upper side when the reactor is closed. The<br>
counterpressure ensures that the syringe also rests<br>
hermetically on the lower side.<br>
Step 1) The interior of the syringe is subsequently<br>
evacuated until a base pressure 
exterior remains at atmospheric pressure throughout the<br>
treatment process. While the connection to the vacuum at<br>
the lower side is maintained, the gas inlet valve is opened<br>
and a first gas mixture of oxygen and hexamethyldisiloxane<br>
with an HMDSO flow rate of 3.4 seem and an oxygen flow rate<br>
of 16.6 seem at a pressure of 0.55 mbar is introduced<br>
through the side with the narrow cross section, i.e. at the<br>
Luer cone of the syringe. A glow discharge is ignited in<br>
the subspace by means of the ignition device, although this<br>
does not yet lead to layer deposition on the inside of the<br><br>
48<br>
syringe. A plasma is not ignited in the interior of the<br>
syringe until the time at which pulsed microwave energy is<br>
input into the reactor space from the microwave source with<br>
a frequency of 2.45 GHz and an average microwave power of<br>
57 watts through the waveguide, while no plasma is ignited<br>
externally owing to the atmospheric pressure.<br>
During the process, the syringe is coated externally with a<br>
first adhesion promoter layer with an average layer<br>
thickness of 40 nm. Toward the end of the first coating,<br>
the microwave energy is turned off.<br>
Step 2:<br>
This is followed by a gas change phase, during which a<br>
second gas mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) and<br>
oxygen with an HMDSO flow rate of 0.6 seem and an oxygen<br>
flow rate of 39.4 seem at a pressure of 0.15 mbar is fed<br>
into the interior of the syringe.<br>
As soon as pulsed microwave energy is introduced into the<br>
reactor space from the microwave source with a frequency of<br>
2.45 GHz and with an average microwave power of 3 0.8 W<br>
through the waveguide, a plasma is ignited internally in<br>
the syringe and a second inorganic barrier layer is applied<br>
with an average layer thickness of 100 nm. Toward the end<br>
of the coating process, the microwave energy is turned off<br>
and the supply of process gas is terminated.<br>
The 2-layer system produced as described above (40 nm/100<br>
nm) exhibits the following properties:<br>
The coated syringes exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.0004<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar) at 23°C and 50% rel. humidity, while<br>
uncoated syringes have an oxygen permeation of 0.0074<br><br>
49<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar), so that the barrier improvement for<br>
oxygen is a factor of 20.<br>
Measurements of the water vapor permeation at 38°C, 90%<br>
relative humidity, reveal that the coated syringes have a<br>
water vapor permeation of 0.05 mg/(Pckg. d) , while uncoated<br>
syringes have a water vapor permeation of 0.11 mg/(Pckg.<br>
d) , so that the barrier improvement for water vapor is a<br>
factor of 2.<br>
ii) Layer System II, 6-level Multilayer<br>
(40 nm / 100 nm / 40 nm / 100 nm / 40 run / 100 nm) :<br>
The layers are applied similarly as for layer system I,<br>
although steps 1) and 2) are repeated a further two times<br>
so that an alternating layer system of 3 organic and 3<br>
inorganic layers is applied overall.<br>
The coated syringes exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.00011<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar) at 23°C and 50% rel. humidity, while<br>
uncoated syringes have an oxygen permeation of 0.0074<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar), so that the barrier improvement for<br>
oxygen is a factor of 70. Consequently, the oxygen barrier<br>
is improved substantially more highly by the multilayer<br>
coating with 6 layers of layer system II other than with<br>
layer system I, which consists of 2 layers.<br>
Measurements of the water vapor permeation at 38°C, 90%<br>
relative humidity, reveal that the coated syringes have a<br>
water vapor permeation of 0.041 mg/(Pckg. d). Conversely,<br>
uncoated syringes have a water vapor permeation of 0.11<br><br>
50<br>
mg/(Pckg. d) so that the barrier improvement for water<br>
vapor is a factor of 2.7.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment Id: PECVD method, internal coating<br>
with through-flow reactor, low flow rate, higher water<br>
vapor barrier<br>
A syringe made of COC (cyclic olefinic copolymer), 1 ml<br>
volume with a cylinder height of 54 mm and a cylinder inner<br>
diameter of 6.5 mm, a total height of 64.5 mm and a Luer<br>
cone according to DIN 594 with a length of 10 mm and with<br>
an internal opening diameter of 2 mm is put in the reactor<br>
described in Fig. 1 with the large cross section downward<br>
and the narrow cross section (Luer cone) upward. The<br>
syringe initially rests on the sealing surface on the lower<br>
side of the reactor. The upper side of the reactor is<br>
subsequently lowered, and the syringe is hermetically<br>
sealed on the upper side when the reactor is closed. The<br>
counterpressure ensures that the syringe also rests<br>
hermetically on the lower side.<br>
Step 1: The interior of the syringe is subsequently<br>
evacuated until a base pressure 
exterior remains at atmospheric pressure throughout the<br>
treatment process. While the connection to the vacuum at<br>
the lower side is maintained, the gas inlet valve is opened<br>
and a first gas mixture of oxygen and hexamethyldisiloxane<br>
with an HMDSO flow rate of 3.4 seem and an oxygen flow rate<br>
of 16.6 seem at a pressure of 0.55 mbar is introduced<br>
through the side with the narrow cross section, i.e. at the<br>
Luer cone of the syringe. A glow discharge is ignited in<br>
the subspace by means of the ignition device, although this<br>
does not yet lead to layer deposition on the inside of the<br><br>
51<br>
syringe. A plasma is not ignited in the interior of the<br>
syringe until the time at which pulsed microwave energy is<br>
input into the reactor space from the microwave source with<br>
a frequency of 2.45 GHz and an average pulse power of 57<br>
watts through the waveguide, while no plasma is ignited<br>
externally owing to the atmospheric pressure. During the<br>
process, the syringe is coated externally with a first<br>
adhesion promoter layer with an average layer thickness of<br>
40 nm. Toward the end of the first coating, the microwave<br>
energy is turned off.<br>
Step 2:<br>
This is followed by a gas change phase, during which a<br>
second gas mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) and<br>
oxygen with an HMDSO flow rate of 0.3 seem and an oxygen<br>
flow rate of 19.7 seem at a pressure of 0.15 mbar is fed<br>
into the interior of the syringe.<br>
As soon as pulsed microwave energy is introduced into the<br>
reactor space from the microwave source with a frequency of<br>
2.45 GHz and with an average microwave power of 30.8 W<br>
through the waveguide, a plasma is ignited internally in<br>
the syringe and a second inorganic barrier layer is applied<br>
with an average layer thickness of 100 nm for a second<br>
coating time of 245.4 s. Toward the end of the coating<br>
process, the microwave energy is turned off and the supply<br>
of process gas is terminated.<br>
Step 3 :<br>
A third gas mixture of oxygen and hexamethyldisiloxane with<br>
an HMDSO flow rate of 14 seem and an oxygen flow rate of 6<br>
seem at a pressure of 0.55 mbar is introduced. A glow<br>
discharge is ignited in the subspace by means of the<br><br>
52<br>
ignition device, although this does not yet lead to layer<br>
deposition on the inside of the syringe. A plasma is not<br>
ignited in the interior of the syringe until the time at<br>
which pulsed microwave energy is input into the reactor<br>
space from the microwave source with a frequency of 2.45<br>
GHz and an average pulse power of 57 watts through the<br>
waveguide, while no plasma is ignited externally owing to<br>
the atmospheric pressure.<br>
During the process, the syringe is coated internally with a<br>
third organosilicon layer with an average layer thickness<br>
of 100 nm. Toward the end of the first coating, the<br>
microwave energy is turned off.<br>
The coated syringes exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.0016<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar) at 23°C and 50% rel. humidity, while<br>
uncoated syringes have an oxygen permeation of 0.0074<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar), so that the barrier improvement for<br>
oxygen is a factor of 4.8.<br>
Measurements of the water vapor permeation at 38°C, 90%<br>
relative humidity, reveal that the coated syringes have a<br>
water vapor permeation of 0.02 mg/(Pckg. d). Conversely,<br>
uncoated syringes have a water vapor permeation of 0.11<br>
mg/(Pckg. d) so that the barrier improvement for water<br>
vapor is a factor of 5.5.<br>
As a further reference, syringes were coated just as in<br>
this exemplary embodiment but the second inorganic barrier<br>
layer is deposited with a total flow rate of 40 seem in<br>
Step 2 while maintaining the same HMDSO concentration and<br>
while maintaining the layer thickness. At 38°C, 90%<br><br>
53<br>
relative humidity, the water vapor permeation of this layer<br>
is 0.05 mg/(Pckg. d). The water vapor barrier is therefore<br>
significantly inferior than in the case of the barrier<br>
coating with the smaller total flow rate of 2 0 seem in the<br>
second process step.<br>

the syringe and a second inorganic barrier layer is applied<br>
with an average layer thickness of 100 run for a second<br>

discharge is ignited in the subspace by means of the<br>
ignition device, although this does not yet lead to layer<br>
deposition on the inside of the syringe. A plasma is not<br>
ignited in the interior of the syringe until the time at<br>
which pulsed microwave energy is input into the reactor<br>
space from the microwave source with a frequency of 2.45<br>
GHz and an average pulse power of 57 watts through the<br>
waveguide, while no plasma is ignited externally owing to<br>
the atmospheric pressure. During the process, the syringe<br>
is coated internally with a third organosilicon layer with<br>
an average layer thickness of 100 nm. Toward the end of the<br>
first coating, the microwave energy is turned off.<br>
The coated syringes exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.0017<br>

uncoated syringes have an oxygen permeation of 0.0074<br>
cm^/(Pckg d 0.21 bar), so that the barrier improvement for<br>
oxygen is a factor of 4.5.<br>
At 38°C, 90% relative humidity, the coated syringes exhibit<br>
a water vapor permeation of 0.03 mg/(Pckg. d), while<br>
uncoated syringes have a water vapor permeation of 0.11<br>

Exemplary Embodiment 2: Through-flow reactor, internal<br>
coating with lower average power<br>
A syringe is coated internally in the through-flow reactor<br>
similarly as in Example 1. The same adhesion promoter layer<br>
is applied. On the other hand, however, a second barrier<br>
layer is subsequently deposited with a much lower microwave<br>
power:<br>
After having applied the 40 nm thick adhesion promoter<br>

Exemplary Embodiment 3: Through-flow reactor, barrier<br>
coating of a glass syringe<br>
A Fiolax glass syringe, 1 ml volume, is introduced into the<br>
reactor described in Fig. 2 with the large cross section<br>
upward and the narrow cross section (Luer cone) downward.<br>
The syringe initially rests on the sealing surface on the<br>
lower side of the reactor. The upper side of the reactor is<br>
subsequently lowered, and the syringe is hermetically<br>
sealed on the upper side when the reactor is closed. The<br>
counterpressure ensures that the syringe also rests<br>
hermetically on the lower side. The interior of the syringe<br>
is subsequently evacuated until a base pressure 
is reached. The exterior remains at atmospheric pressure<br>
throughout the treatment process.<br><br>

While the connection to the vacuum at the lower side is<br>

this through-flow operation, a continuous flow is set up in<br>
which the gas flows parallel to the symmetry axis from the<br>
narrow cross section to the wide cross section.<br>
A glow discharge is ignited in the subspace by means of the<br>
ignition device, although this does not yet lead to layer<br>
deposition on the inside of the syringe. A plasma is not<br>

space from the microwave source with a frequency of 2.45<br>
GHz and an average pulse power of 167 watts through the<br>
waveguide, while no plasma is ignited externally owing to<br>
the atmospheric pressure. During the process, the syringe<br>
is heated internally to a temperature of 250°C for a<br>
treatment time of 19 s.<br>
Toward the end of the heating process, the microwave energy<br>
is turned off. This is followed by a gas change phase,<br>
during which a second gas mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane<br>
and oxygen with an HMDSO flow rate of 1.2 seem and an<br>
oxygen flow rate of 40 seem at a pressure of 2.5 mbar is<br>
fed into the interior of the syringe. Before the start of<br>
the coating, the syringe is at a temperature of 205°C.<br>
As soon as pulsed microwave energy is introduced into the<br>
reactor space from the microwave source with a frequency of<br>
2.45 GHz and with an average microwave power of 167 W<br>
through the waveguide, a plasma is ignited internally in<br><br>
61<br>
the syringe and a second inorganic barrier layer is applied<br>
for a coating time of 13 s and with an average layer<br>
thickness of 100 nm. Toward the end of the coating process,<br>
the microwave energy is turned off and the supply of<br>
process gas is terminated. Toward the end of the process,<br>
the interior of the syringe is flushed to atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
The coated syringes are filled with 0.1 mol HCl and<br>
autoclaved at 121°C for 6 hours. After the autoclaving, the<br>
sodium leaching is measured. Compared with uhcoated glass<br>
syringes, the sodium leaching is reduced significantly and<br>
is less than 0.3 ppm.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 4a: Reverse flow reactor syringe<br>
coating<br>
A syringe body made of COC (cyclic olefinic copolymer),<br>
1 ml volume with a cylinder height of 54 mm and a cylinder<br>
inner diameter of 6.5 mm, a total height of 64.5 mm and a<br>
Luer cone according to DIN 594 with a length of 10 mm and<br>
with an internal opening diameter of 2 mm is put in the<br>
reactor described in Fig. 10a with the large cross section<br>
downward and the narrow cross section (Luer cone) upward.<br>
The syringe initially rests on the sealing surface on the<br>
lower side of the reactor and a gas feed (supply channel)<br>
consisting of stainless steel, with an outer diameter of 2<br>
mm, an inner diameter of 1.5 mm, projects into the syringe<br>
with a penetration depth of 34.5 mm. The syringe is<br>
hermetically closed with sealing material on the side with<br>
the narrow cross section (Luer cone). The upper side of the<br>
reactor is subsequently lowered, and a mechanical<br>
counterpressure ensures that the syringe rests hermetically<br><br>
62<br>
on the lower side. The interior of the syringe is<br>
subsequently evacuated until a base pressure 
reached. The exterior remains at atmospheric pressure<br>
throughout the treatment process. While the connection to<br>
the vacuum at the lower side is maintained, the gas inlet<br>
valve is opened and a first gas mixture of oxygen and<br>
hexamethyldisiloxane with an HMDSO flow rate of 3.4 seem<br>
and an oxygen flow rate of 16.6 seem at a pressure of 0.4<br>
mbar is introduced through the gas feed. A continuous flow<br>
is thereby set up. A glow discharge is ignited in the<br>
subspace by means of the ignition device, although this<br>
does not yet lead to layer deposition on the inside of the<br>
syringe. A plasma is not ignited in the interior of the<br>
syringe until the time at which pulsed microwave energy is<br>
input into the reactor space from the microwave source with<br>
a frequency of 2.45 GHz and an average pulse power of 57 W<br>
through the waveguide, while no plasma is ignited<br>
externally owing to the atmospheric pressure. During the<br>
process, the syringe is coated internally with a first<br>
adhesion promoter layer for a first coating time of 1.2 s<br>
and with an average layer thickness of 4 0 nm. Toward the<br>
end of the first coating, the microwave energy is turned<br>
off. This is followed by a gas change phase, during which a<br>
second gas mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane and oxygen with<br>
an HMDSO flow rate of 0.44 seem and an oxygen flow rate of<br>
39.6 seem at a pressure of 0.4 mbar is fed into the<br>
interior of the syringe. As soon as pulsed microwave energy<br>
is introduced into the reactor space from the microwave<br>
source with a frequency of 2.45 GHz and with an average<br>
microwave power of 84.9 W through the waveguide, a plasma<br>
is ignited internally in the syringe and a second inorganic<br>
barrier layer is applied for a second coating time of 15.3<br>
s and with an average layer thickness of 2 0 nm. Toward the<br><br>
63<br>
end of the coating process, the microwave energy is turned<br>
off and the supply of process gas is terminated. The<br>
substrate is subsequently cooled in a cooling phase, and<br>
the coating process for the barrier layer is repeated three<br>
times after evacuation, the same process parameters being<br>
used and equally thick barrier layers being deposited as in<br>
Step 2. The overall barrier thickness of the 3 successively<br>
applied barrier layers 60 run. Toward the end of the<br>
process, the interior of the syringe is flushed to<br>
atmospheric pressure.<br>
The coated syringes exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.0033<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar) at 23°C and 50% rel. humidity, while<br>
uncoated syringes have an oxygen permeation of 0.0074<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar), so that the barrier improvement for<br>
oxygen is better than a factor of 2.5.<br>

The syringe initially rests on the sealing surface on the<br>
lower side of the reactor and a gas feed (supply channel)<br>
consisting of stainless steel, with an outer diameter of 2<br>
mm, an inner diameter of 1.5 mm, projects into the syringe<br>
with a penetration depth of 17.5 mm. The syringe is<br><br>
64<br>
hermetically closed with sealing material on the side with<br>
the narrow cross section (Luer cone) . The upper side of the<br>
reactor is subsequently lowered, and a mechanical<br>
counterpressure ensures that the syringe rests hermetically<br>
on the lower side. The interior of the syringe is<br>
subsequently evacuated until a base pressure 
reached. The exterior remains at atmospheric pressure<br>
throughout the treatment process. While the connection to<br>
the vacuum at the lower side is maintained, the gas inlet<br>
valve is opened and a first gas mixture of oxygen and<br>
hexamethyldisiloxane with an HMDSO flow rate of 3.4 seem<br>
and an oxygen flow rate of 16.6 seem at a pressure of 0.4<br>
mbar is introduced through the gas feed. A continuous flow<br>
is thereby set up. A glow discharge is ignited in the<br>
subspace by means of the ignition device, although this<br>
does not yet lead to layer deposition on the inside of the<br>
syringe. A plasma is not ignited in the interior of the<br>
syringe until the time at which pulsed microwave energy is<br>
input into the reactor space from the microwave source with<br>
a frequency of 2.45 GHz and an average pulse power of 57 W<br>
through the waveguide, while no plasma is ignited<br>
externally owing to the atmospheric pressure. During the<br>
process, the syringe is coated internally with a first<br>
adhesion promoter layer for a first coating time of 2.1 s<br>
and with an average layer thickness of 4 0 nm. Toward the<br>
end of the first coating, the microwave energy is turned<br>
off. This is followed by a gas change phase, during which a<br>
second gas mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane and oxygen with<br>
an HMDSO flow rate of 0.38 seem and an oxygen flow rate of<br>
24.6 seem at a pressure of 0.4 mbar is fed into the<br>
interior of the syringe. As soon as pulsed microwave energy<br>
is introduced into the reactor space from the microwave<br>
source with a frequency of 2.4 5 GHz and with an average<br><br>
65<br>
microwave power of 214 W through the waveguide, a plasma is<br>
ignited internally in the syringe and a second inorganic<br>
barrier layer is applied for a second coating time of 3 s<br>
and with an average layer thickness of 6.4 run. Toward the<br>
end of the coating process, the microwave energy is turned<br>
off and the supply of process gas is terminated. The<br>
substrate is subsequently cooled in a cooling phase, and<br>
the coating process for the barrier layer is repeated ten<br>
times after evacuation, the same process parameters being<br>
used and equally thick barrier layers being deposited as in<br>
Step 2. The overall barrier thickness of the 11<br>
successively applied barrier layers is 70 nm. Toward the<br>
end of the process, the interior of the syringe is flushed<br>
to atmospheric pressure.<br>
The coated syringes exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.0012<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar) at 23°C and 50% rel. humidity, while<br>
uncoated syringes have an oxygen permeation of 0.0074<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar), so that the barrier improvement for<br>
oxygen is better than a factor of 6.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 5: Reverse flow reactor, coating of<br>
vials<br>
A vial made of COC (cyclic olefinic copolymer), 12 ml<br>
volume, is put in the reactor described in Fig. 10a. The<br>
vial initially rests on the sealing surface on the lower<br>
side of the reactor and a gas feed made of metal projects<br>
into the vial. The upper side of the reactor is<br>
subsequently lowered, and the interior of the vial is<br>
subsequently evacuated until a base pressure 
reached. The outer region of the reactor chamber,<br><br>
66<br>
surrounding the vial, remains at atmospheric pressure<br>
throughout the treatment process.<br>
While the connection to the vacuum at the lower side is<br>
maintained, the gas inlet valve is opened and a first gas<br>
mixture of oxygen and hexamethyldisiloxane with an HMDSO<br>
flow rate of 4.25 seem and an oxygen flow rate of 20.75<br>
seem at a pressure of 0.4 mbar is introduced through the<br>
gas feed. A continuous flow is thereby set up, in which the<br>
gas is distributed axisymmetrically. A glow discharge is<br>
ignited in the subspace by means of the ignition device,<br>
although this does not yet lead to layer deposition on the<br>
inside of the vial. A plasma is not ignited in the interior<br>
of the vial until the time at which pulsed microwave energy<br>
is input into the reactor space from the microwave source<br>
with a frequency of 2.45 GHz and an average pulse power of<br>
57 W through the waveguide, while no plasma is ignited<br>
externally owing to the atmospheric pressure.<br>
During the process, the vial is coated internally with a<br>
first adhesion promoter layer for a first coating time of<br>
0.4 s and with an average layer thickness of 2 0 nm. Toward<br>
the end of the first coating, the microwave energy is<br>
turned off. This is followed by a gas change phase, during<br>
which a second gas mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane and<br>
oxygen with an HMDSO flow rate of 0.75 seem and an oxygen<br>
flow rate of 50 seem at a pressure of 0.4 mbar is fed into<br>
the interior of the vial.<br>
As soon as pulsed microwave energy is introduced into the<br>
reactor space from the microwave source with a frequency of<br>
2.45 GHz and with an average microwave power of 214 W<br>
through the waveguide, a plasma is ignited internally in<br><br>
67<br>
the vial and a second inorganic barrier layer is applied<br>
for a second coating time of 34 s and with a layer<br>
thickness of 100 ran. Toward the end of the coating process,<br>
the microwave energy is turned off, the supply of process<br>
gas is terminated and the interior of the vial is flushed<br>
to atmospheric pressure.<br>
The coated vials exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.001<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar) at 23°C and 50% rel. humidity, while<br>
uncoated vials have an oxygen permeation of 0.0283<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar). The resolution limit of the<br>
permeation measuring instrument is reached, so that the<br>
barrier improvement improved for oxygen is better than a<br>
factor of 28.<br>
At 38°C, 90% relative humidity, coated vials exhibit a<br>
water vapor permeation of 0.16 mg/(Pckg. d), while uncoated<br>
vials have a water vapor permeation of 0.3 mg/(Pckg. d).<br>
The barrier improvement achieved for water vapor is<br>
therefore a factor of 1.9.<br>
Storage stability:<br>
During a storage test, the vials were filled with i)<br>
distilled water and ii) 0.1 molar hydrochloric acid and<br>
stored for 1 week at 60 °C. After emptying and drying, the<br>
oxygen permeation was again measured at 23°C and 50% rel.<br>
humidity. After the storage test, in both cases i) and ii)<br>
the oxygen permeation was still at the resolution limit of<br>
0.001 cm3 / (Pckg d 0.21 bar). An oxygen barrier<br>
improvement by a factor of more than 28 therefore still<br>
remains.<br><br>

Exemplary Embodiment 6: Internal coating of syringe with<br>
barrier layer, outer coating with scratch protection layer<br>
a) A COC syringe, 1 ml volume, is coated in a reactor<br>
corresponding to Fig. 7. The syringe is first coated<br>
internally with an adhesion promoter layer and a barrier<br>
layer using "Vacuum 1" and delivery of the process gas<br>
through "Gas 1" according to Exemplary Embodiment 1. After<br>
flushing the interior of the syringe to atmospheric<br>
pressure, the reactor exterior is evacuated through "Vacuum<br>
2" to a base pressure 
hexamethyldisiloxane and oxygen is subsequently delivered<br>
into the exterior through the gas distributor device "Gas<br>
2", while sustaining the continuous gas flow through<br>
"Vacuum 2". Pulsed microwave energy with a frequency of<br>
2.45 GHz is subsequently input into the reactor space using<br>
the microwave source, and a plasma is now ignited in the<br>
exterior. A 100 nm thick scratch protection layer is<br>
applied on the outer wall of the substrate.<br>
b) A COC syringe, 12 ml volume, is coated in a reactor<br>
corresponding to Fig. 10b. The syringe is first coated<br>
internally with an adhesion promoter layer and a barrier<br>
layer using "Vacuum 1" and delivery of process gas through<br>
"Gas 1" according to Exemplary Embodiment 4. After flushing<br>
the interior of the syringe to atmospheric pressure, the<br>
reactor exterior is evacuated through "Vacuum 2" to a base<br>
pressure 
oxygen is subsequently delivered into the exterior through<br>
the gas distributor device "Gas 2", while sustaining the<br>
continuous gas flow through "Vacuum 2".<br><br>
69<br>
Pulsed microwave energy with, a frequency of 2.45 GHz is<br>
subsequently input into the reactor space using the<br>
microwave source, and a plasma is now ignited in the<br>
exterior. A 100 nm thick scratch protection layer is<br>
applied on the outer wall of the substrate.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 7a: Barrier layer of amorphous carbon<br>
on organosilicon bonding layer, deposition on a COC syringe<br>
A syringe made of COC (cyclic olefinic copolymer), 1 ml<br>
volume with a cylinder height of 54 mm and a cylinder inner<br>
diameter of 6.5 mm, a total height of 64.5 mm and a Luer<br>
cone according to DIN 594 with a length of 10 mm and with<br>
an internal opening diameter of 2 mm is put in the reactor<br>
described in Fig. 1 with the large cross section downward<br>
and the narrow cross section (Luer cone) upward. The<br>
syringe initially rests on the sealing surface on the lower<br>
side of the reactor. The upper side of the reactor is<br>
subsequently lowered, and the syringe is hermetically<br>
sealed on the upper side when the reactor is closed. The<br>
counterpressure ensures that the syringe also rests<br>
hermetically on the lower side. The interior of the syringe<br>
is subsequently evacuated until a base pressure 
is reached. The exterior remains at atmospheric pressure<br>
throughout the treatment process.<br>
Step 1: While the connection to the vacuum at the lower<br>
side is maintained, the gas inlet valve is opened and a<br>
first gas mixture of oxygen and hexamethyldisiloxane with<br>
an HMDSO flow rate of 3.4 seem and an oxygen flow rate of<br>
16.6 seem at a pressure of 0.55 mbar is introduced through<br>
the side with the narrow cross section, i.e. at the Luer<br>
cone of the syringe. A glow discharge is ignited in the<br><br>
70<br>
subspace by means of the ignition device, although this<br>
does not yet lead to layer deposition on the inside of the<br>
syringe. A plasma is not ignited in the interior of the<br>
syringe until the time at which pulsed microwave energy is<br>
input into the reactor space from the microwave source with<br>
a frequency of 2.45 GHz and an average pulse power of 57<br>
watts through the waveguide, while no plasma is ignited<br>
externally owing to the atmospheric pressure.<br>
During the process, the syringe is coated internally with a<br>
first organosilicon adhesion promoter layer with an average<br>
layer thickness of 4 0 nm. Toward the end of the first<br>
coating, the microwave energy is turned off.<br>
Step 2: Next, acetylene gas at a pressure of 0.2 mbar and<br>
with a flow rate of 4 0 seem is fed in during a gas change<br>
phase. A glow discharge is ignited in the subspace by means<br>
of the ignition device, although this does not yet lead to<br>
layer deposition on the inside of the syringe. A plasma is<br>
not ignited in the interior of the syringe- until the time<br>
at which pulsed microwave energy is input into the reactor<br>
space from the microwave source with a frequency of 2.45<br>
GHz and an average microwave power of 3 0.8 W through the<br>
waveguide, while no plasma is ignited externally owing to<br>
the atmospheric pressure. During the process, the syringe<br>
is coated internally with a barrier layer of amorphous<br>
carbon for a coating time of 10 s. Toward the end of the<br>
coating process, the microwave energy is turned off, the<br>
supply of process gas is terminated and the interior of the<br>
syringe is flushed to atmospheric pressure.<br>
Compared with the uncoated substrate, a barrier improvement<br>
is achieved for oxygen:<br><br>
71<br>
The coated syringes exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.007<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar) at 23°C and 50% rel. humidity, while<br>
uncoated syringes have an oxygen permeation of 0.008<br>
cm-V (Pckg d 0.21 bar) . The barrier improvement for oxygen<br>
is a factor of 1.2.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 7b: Barrier layer of amorphous carbon<br>
on organosilicon bonding layer, deposition on CQC vials:<br>
A vial made of COC (cyclic olefinic copolymer), 12 ml<br>
volume, is put in the reactor described in Fig. 10a. The<br>
vial initially rests on the sealing surface on the lower<br>
side of the reactor and a gas feed made of metal projects<br>
into the vial. The upper side of the reactor is<br>
subsequently lowered, and the interior of the vial is<br>
subsequently evacuated until a base pressure 
reached. The outer region of the reactor chamber,<br>
surrounding the vial, remains at atmospheric pressure<br>
throughout the treatment process.<br>
Step 1: While the connection to the vacuum at the lower<br>
side is maintained, the gas inlet valve is opened and a<br>
first gas mixture of oxygen and hexamethyldisiloxane with<br>
an HMDSO flow rate of 4.25 seem and an oxygen flow rate of<br>
20.75 seem at a pressure of 0.4 mbar is introduced through<br>
the gas feed. A glow discharge is ignited in the<br>
antechamber by means of the ignition device, although this<br>
does not yet lead to layer deposition on the inside of the<br>
syringe. A plasma is not ignited in the interior of the<br>
vial until the time at which pulsed microwave energy is<br>
input into the reactor space from the microwave source with<br>
a frequency of 2.45 GHz and an average pulse power of 57 W<br><br>
72<br>
through the waveguide, while no plasma is ignited<br>
externally owing to the atmospheric pressure.<br>
During the process, the vial is coated internally with a<br>
first adhesion promoter layer for a first coating time of<br>
0.5 s and with a thickness of 2 0 run. Toward the end of the<br>
first coating, the microwave energy is turned off.<br>
Step 2: Next, acetylene gas at a pressure of 0.2 mbar and<br>
with a flow rate of 80 seem is fed in during a gas change<br>
phase. A glow discharge is ignited in the subspace by means<br>
of the ignition device, although this does not yet lead to<br>
layer deposition on the inside of the vial. A plasma is not<br>
ignited in the interior of the vial until the time at which<br>
pulsed microwave energy is input into the reactor space<br>
from the microwave source with a frequency of 2.45 GHz and<br>
an average microwave power of 72.7 W through the waveguide,<br>
while no plasma is ignited externally owing to the<br>
atmospheric pressure. During the process, the vial is<br>
coated internally with a barrier layer of amorphous carbon<br>
for a coating time of 10 s. Toward the end of the coating<br>
process, the microwave energy is turned off, the supply of<br>
process gas is terminated and the interior of the vial is<br>
flushed to atmospheric pressure.<br>
The coated vials exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.0006<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar) at 23°C and 50% rel. humidity, while<br>
uncoated vials have an oxygen permeation of 0.0283<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar), so that the barrier improvement<br>
achieved for oxygen is better than a factor of 40. This<br>
high barrier improvement could be detected by a high-<br>
resolution permeation measurement method in this case.<br><br>
73<br>
At 38°C, 90% relative humidity, coated vials exhibit a<br>
water vapor permeation of 0.23 mg/(Pckg. d), while uncoated<br>
vials have a water vapor permeation of 0.4 mg/(Pckg. d).<br>
The barrier improvement achieved for water vapor is<br>
therefore a factor of 1.8.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 7c: Barrier layer of amorphous carbon<br>
on organosilicon bonding layer, deposition on COC vials<br>
A vial made of COC (cyclic olefinic copolymer), 12 ml<br>
volume, is put in the reactor described in Fig. 10a. The<br>
vial initially rests on the sealing surface on the lower<br>
side of the reactor and a gas feed made of metal projects<br>
into the vial. The upper side of the reactor is<br>
subsequently lowered, and the interior of the vial is<br>
subsequently evacuated until a base pressure 
reached. The outer region of the reactor chamber,<br>
surrounding the vial, remains at atmospheric pressure<br>
throughout the treatment process.<br>
Step 1: Next, acetylene gas at a pressure of 0.2 mbar and<br>
with a flow rate of 50 seem is fed in during a gas change<br>
phase. A glow discharge is ignited in the subspace by means<br>
of the ignition device, although this does not yet lead to<br>
layer deposition on the inside of the vial. A plasma is not<br>
ignited in the interior of the vial until the time at which<br>
pulsed microwave energy is input into the reactor space<br>
from the microwave source with a frequency of 2.45 GHz and<br>
an average microwave power of 214 W through the waveguide,<br>
while no plasma is ignited externally owing to the<br>
atmospheric pressure. During the process, the vial is<br>
coated internally with a barrier layer of amorphous carbon<br><br>
74<br>
for a coating time of 30 s. Toward the end of the coating<br>
process, the microwave energy is turned off, the supply of<br>
process gas is terminated and the interior of the vial is<br>
flushed to atmospheric pressure.<br>
The coated vials exhibit an oxygen permeation of 0.0008<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar) at 23°C and 50% rel. humidity, while<br>
uncoated vials have an oxygen permeation of 0.0283<br>
cm3/(Pckg d 0.21 bar), so that the barrier improvement<br>
achieved for oxygen is better than a factor of 30. This<br>
high barrier improvement could be detected by a high-<br>
resolution permeation measurement method in this case.<br>
At 38°C, 90% relative humidity, coated vials exhibit a<br>
water vapor permeation of 0.22 mg/(Pckg. d), while uncoated<br>
vials have a water vapor permeation of 0.4 mg/(Pckg. d).<br>
The barrier improvement achieved for water vapor is<br>
therefore a factor of 1.8.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 8: External coating with barrier layer<br>
A syringe made of COC (cyclic olefinic copolymer), 1 ml<br>
volume with a cylinder height of 54 mm and a cylinder inner<br>
diameter of 6.5 mm, a total height of 64.5 mm and a Luer<br>
cone according to DIN 594 with a length of 10 mm and with<br>
an internal opening diameter of 2 mm is put in the reactor<br>
described in Fig. 4 with the large cross section downward<br>
and the narrow cross section (Luer cone) upward. The<br>
syringe is sealed hermetically at both openings: the<br>
syringe initially rests on the sealing surface on the lower<br>
side of the reactor and is sealed from the vacuum at the<br><br>
75<br>
bottom. On the upper side, the narrow cross section (Luer<br>
cone) is covered and is also vacuum-tight.<br>
The exterior of the syringe is subsequently evacuated until<br>
a base pressure 
remains at atmospheric pressure throughout the treatment<br>
process. While the connection to the vacuum at the lower<br>
side is maintained, the gas inlet valve is opened and a<br>
first gas mixture of oxygen and hexamethyldisiloxane with<br>
an HMDSO flow rate of 3.4 seem and an oxygen flow rate of<br>
16.6 seem at a pressure of 0.55 mbar is introduced through<br>
the gas distributor device. In this through-flow operation,<br>
a continuous flow is set up in which the gas flows parallel<br>
to the symmetry axis. A glow discharge is ignited in the<br>
subspace by means of the ignition device, although this<br>
does not yet lead to layer deposition on the inside of the<br>
syringe. A plasma is not ignited in the exterior of the<br>
reactor until the time at which pulsed microwave energy is<br>
input into the reactor space from the microwave source with<br>
a frequency of 2.45 GHz and an average microwave power of<br>
57 watts through the waveguide, while no plasma is ignited<br>
internally owing to the atmospheric pressure. During the<br>
process, the syringe is coated externally with a first<br>
adhesion promoter layer for a first coating time of 1.1 s<br>
and with a thickness of 4 0 nm. Toward the end of the first<br>
coating, the microwave energy is turned off. This is<br>
followed by a gas change phase, during which a second gas<br>
mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane and oxygen with an HMDSO<br>
flow rate of 0.8 seem and an oxygen flow rate of 39.2 seem<br>
at a pressure of 0.8 mbar is fed into the exterior of the<br>
reactor. As soon as pulsed microwave energy is introduced<br>
into the reactor space from the microwave source with a<br>
frequency of 2.45 GHz and with an average microwave power<br><br>
76<br>
of 7 6.9 W through the waveguide, a plasma is ignited in the<br>
exterior and a second inorganic barrier layer is applied<br>
for a second coating time of 15.7 s and with a thickness of<br>
15 run. Toward the end of the coating process, the microwave<br>
energy is turned off and the supply of process gas is<br>
terminated. The substrate is subsequently cooled in a<br>
cooling phase, and the coating process for the barrier<br>
layer is repeated four times after evacuation, the same<br>
process parameters being used and equally thick barrier<br>
layer is being deposited as in Step 2. The overall barrier<br>
thickness of the four successively applied barrier layers<br>
is 60 nm. Toward the end of the process, the interior of<br>
the syringe is flushed to atmospheric pressure. Compared<br>
with the uncoated syringe, the coated syringe has a barrier<br>
improvement for oxygen.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 9: Internal coating with decorative<br>
layer (layer with selective reflection in the visible<br>
spectral range)<br>
A syringe made of COC (cyclic olefinic copolymer), 1 ml<br>
volume with a cylinder height of 54 mm and a cylinder inner<br>
diameter of 6.5 mm, a total height of 64.5 mm and a Luer<br>
cone according to DIN 594 with a length of 10 mm and with<br>
an internal opening diameter of 2 mm is put in the reactor<br>
described in Fig. 1 with the large cross section downward<br>
and the narrow cross section (Luer cone) upward. The<br>
syringe initially rests on the sealing surface on the lower<br>
side of the reactor. The upper side of the reactor is<br>
subsequently lowered, and the syringe is hermetically<br>
sealed on the upper side when the reactor is closed. The<br>
counterpressure ensures that the syringe also rests<br>
hermetically on the lower side. The interior of the syringe<br><br>
77<br>
is subsequently evacuated until a base pressure 
is reached.<br>
The exterior remains at atmospheric pressure throughout the<br>
treatment process.<br>
Step 1: Deposition of a high refractive index layer<br>
While the connection to the vacuum at the lower side is<br>
maintained, the gas inlet valve is opened and a first gas<br>
mixture of titanium chloride and oxygen with a TiCl4 flow<br>
rate of 0.2 seem and an oxygen flow rate of 19.8 seem at a<br>
pressure of 0,2 mbar is fed into the interior of the<br>
syringe through the side with the narrow cross section,<br>
i.e. at the Luer cone of the syringe. As soon as pulsed<br>
microwave energy is introduced into the reactor space from<br>
the microwave source with a frequency of 2.45 GHz and with<br>
an average microwave power of 90 W through the waveguide, a<br>
plasma is ignited internally in the syringe and a first<br>
high refractive index layer is applied for a first coating<br>
time of 27 s and with a thickness of 3 0 nm.<br>
Step 2: Deposition of a low refractive index layer<br>
This is followed by a gas change phase, during which a<br>
second gas mixture of hexamethyldisiloxane and oxygen with<br>
an HMDSO flow rate of 0.2 seem and an oxygen flow rate of<br>
9.8 seem at a pressure of 0.15 mbar is fed into the<br>
interior of the syringe. As soon as pulsed microwave energy<br>
is introduced into the reactor space from the microwave<br>
source with a frequency of 2.45 GHz and with an average<br>
microwave power of 15.7 W through the waveguide, a plasma<br>
is ignited internally in the syringe and a second inorganic<br>
barrier layer is applied for a second coating time of 93 s<br>
with an average layer thickness of 40 nm.<br><br>
78<br>
Steps 1 and 2 are repeated 8 times, the layer thicknesses<br>
and the coating times being adapted for the layer design.<br>
Toward the end of the coating process, the microwave energy<br>
is turned off, the supply of process gas is terminated and<br>
the interior of the syringe is flushed to atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
A decorative effect is achieved by the alternating layer<br>
system of high and low refractive index layers: the layer<br>
reflects the incident light selectively (i.e. wavelength-<br>
dependently). The layer design is adapted so that the layer<br>
system has a bluish effect.<br>
Furthermore, owing to the additional barrier effect of the<br>
titanium oxide layer, the barrier improvement for oxygen is<br>
significantly better than in Exemplary Embodiment 2.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 10: Mirroring<br>
The layers are applied similarly as in Exemplary Embodiment<br>
9.	12 layers are used, however, and the design is adapted<br>
so that the visible light spectrum is reflected<br>
selectively.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 11: Layer with selective reflection in<br>
the infrared wavelength range<br>
The layers are applied similarly as in Exemplary Embodiment<br>
10.	14 layers are used, however, and the design is adapted<br>
so that light of the infrared wavelength range is reflected<br>
selectively.<br><br>
79<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 12: Layer with selective reflection in<br>
the infrared wavelength range<br>
The layers are applied similarly as in Exemplary Embodiment<br>
10. 14 layers are used, however, and the design is adapted<br>
so that light of the infrared wavelength range is reflected<br>
selectively.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 13: External coating with a UV<br>
reflection layer and scratch protection layer<br>
The UV reflection layer is a layer with selective<br>
reflection in the ultraviolet wavelength range.<br>
The layers are deposited similarly as in Exemplary<br>
Embodiment 8, and the layer sequence is similar to<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 9. 16 layers are used, however, and<br>
the design is adapted so that light of the ultraviolet<br>
wavelength range is reflected selectively. A 100 nm thick<br>
scratch protection layer is additionally applied as a final<br>
layer, with a coating process similar to Exemplary<br>
Embodiment 6.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment 14: External coating with decorative<br>
