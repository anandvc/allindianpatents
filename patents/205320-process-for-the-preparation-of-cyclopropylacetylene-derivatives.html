				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF CYCLOPROPYLACETYLENE DERIVATIVES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to process for the preparation of a cyclopropylacetylene derivative and a cyclopropylacrylic acid derivative which is an intermediate in synthesis of the cyclopropylacetylene derivative - A cyclopropylacetylene derivative produced by the present invention is useful as an intermediate in synthesis for a compound having a cyclopropane skeleton, for example a benzoxazinone derivative (L-743726), which has an anti-HIV activity (Tetrahedron Letters, vol. 36, p. 8937 (1995)) and the like.<br>
Discussion of the Related Art<br>
Recently, many physiologically active substances having a cyclopropane skeleton have been discovered. Well known methods of producing a cyclopropylacetylene derivative, for example cyclopropylacetylene, which is useful for an intermediate in synthesis for these compounds, are:<br>
(1) a method in which cyclopropyl methyl ketone is reacted with phosphorus pentachloride in carbon tetrachloride to produce 1,1-dichloro-1-cyclopropylethane, which is dehydrochlorinated by potassium tert-butoxide (Synthesis, p. 703, (1972) and Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 41, p. 1237 (1976));<br>
-1A-<br><br>
(2)	a method in which 5-chloropentyne is reacted with n-butyl<br>
lithium in cyclohexane (Tetrahedron Letters, vol. 36, p. 8937<br>
(1995)); and<br>
(3)	a method in which cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde is reacted with<br>
carbon tetrabromide in the presence of triphenylphosphine by<br>
Wittig reaction to produce 1, 1-dibromo-2-cyclopropylethylene,<br>
followed by the reaction with methyllithium (Tetrahedron, vol.<br>
45, p. 363 (1989)).<br>
However, the method (1) affords many by-products and a yield of the target compound is low, the method (2) requires use of expensive n-butyl lithium or lithium diisopropylamide and the method (3) produces large amount of triphenylphosphine oxide as a by-product which is troublesome to separate. Therefore, these methods are hard to evaluate as being industrially useful methods for cyclopropylacetylene.<br>
On the other hand, as methods to construct a cyclopropane skeleton, known are: a Simmons-Smith method in which olefin is reacted with carbene that is produced by the reaction of 1, 1-dihalo-compound and zinc copper alloy (New Experimental Chemistry Lecture Course, vol. 14, p. 84 (1977)); a method in which sulfur ylid is reacted with olefin (New Experimental Chemistry Lecture Course, vol. 14, p. 91 (1977)); a method using a decomposition reaction of an azo compound (New Experimental Chemistry Lecture Course, vol. 14, p. 82 (1977)); and an intramolecular cyclization reaction of a butanoic acid derivative having a leaving group at 7-position (New<br>
-2-<br><br>
Experimental Chemistry Lecture Course, vol. 14, p. 93 (1977)). As methods to construct an acetylene structure, known are: a coupling reaction of a metal acetylide (a metallic salt of acetylene) with a compound having a leaving group (New Experimental Chemistry Lecture course, vol. 14, p. 271 (1977)); a reaction of a halogeno compound with a base (The fourth edition: Experimental Chemistry Lecture Course, vol. 19, p. 298 (1992)); a reaction of a nitrogen-containing compound such as hydrazone with a mercury compound or a base (The fourth edition: Experimental Chemistry Lecture Course, vol. 19, p. 310 (1992)); and an isomerization of an acetylene compound by a base (The fourth edition: Experimental Chemistry Lecture Course, vol. 19, p. 312 (1992)).<br>
However, if a method mentioned above to construct a cyclopropane skeleton is applied to synthesis of a cyclopropylacetylene derivative, there arise problems that a side-reaction between carbene and acetylene occurs and many stages in a process are required in construction of a acetylene<br>
structure.<br>
In addition to the above mentioned methods, it is known that an aldehyde derivative having a naphthalene ring is transformed by way of an acrylic acid derivative, to a vinyl derivative and to an acetylene derivative (Comptes Rendus, vol. 229, p. 660 (1949) and Justus Liebigs Annalen der Chemie, vol. 387, p. 257 (1912)). But a cyclopropane ring has a high distortion, at which point the ring is different from a naphtalene ring, to cause<br>
-3-<br><br>
a ring-opening reaction by electrophile (Journal of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan, vol. 41, p. 22 (1983)). Therefore, it is thought that if such a method is applied to synthesis of a cyclopropylacetylene derivative, a side reaction which is represented by a ring-opening of a cyclopropane ring by bromine has a high probability to occur (Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English, vol. 15, p. 762 (1976)).<br>
As a method of production of a cyclopropylacrylic acid derivative, known are the following methods: (4) a method in which cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde is reacted with malonic acid using pyridine as a solvent and a base (Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, vol. 8, p. 883 (1997) and Journal of the American Chemical Society, vol. 73, p. 3831 (1951)); (5) a method in which cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde is reacted with phosphonic acid derivative in the presence of a base to synthesize cyclopropylacrylate ester (Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 59, p. 6476 (1994), Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 55, p. 3088 (1990), Journal of the American Chemical Society, vol. 91, p. 6432 (1969) and Journal of the American Chemical Society, vol. 90, p. 3769 (1968)); and (6) an addition reaction of an acetylenecarboxylate with dicyclopropyl copper derivative prepared from cyclopropyl halide (Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 41, p. 3629 (1976)).<br>
However, it is difficult that these methods are applied to an industrial production of a cyclopropylacrylic acid derivative by following reasons; according to the method (4),<br>
-4-<br><br>
since pyridine is used as a solvent, removal and recovery of pyridine are problematic in an industrial scale of synthesis and moreover, a reaction requires a long time of period; according to the method (5), it is necessary to use expensive n-butyllithium or sodium hydride; and according to the method (6), it is necessary to employ many stages in synthesis of a starting material.<br>
Under such circumstances, desired is a method in which a cyclopropylacetylene derivative and a cyclopropylacrylic acid derivative, which is an intermediate in synthesis of the cyclopropylacetylene derivative, can be produced in good yields under moderate conditions and thereby advantageously on an industrial scale.<br>

-15-<br><br>
cyclopropylacrylic acid derivative (I) are obtained.<br>
Thus obtained cyclopropylacrylic acid derivative (I) can be isolated and purified in a common method which is used for isolation and purification. For example, a reaction mixture is poured into a saline solution or water, and subjected to extraction with an organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride or the like.  If necessary, an extract is washed with a dilute hydrochloric acid solution, water, a saline solution or the like in order to remove a basic substance and a water soluble substance, the extract is further dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, anhydrous sodium sulfate or the like and thereafter the extract is further concentrated and the obtained crude product can be, if necessary, purified by distillation, chromatography, recrystallization or the like. If necessary, a protecting group of a cyclopropylacrylic acid derivative (I) may be deblocked. Without an after-treatment, a reaction solution may be provided for next reaction.<br>
A cyclopropylpropionic acid derivative (VI) can also be isolated and purified in a common method which is used for isolation and purification. For example, a reaction mixture is poured into a saline solution or water, and subjected to extraction with an organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride or the like. If necessary, an extract is washed with a dilute hydrochloric acid solution, water, a saline solution or the like in order to remove a basic substance and a water soluble substance, thereafter the extract is further<br>
-16-<br><br>
concentrated and the obtained crude product can be, if necessary, purified by distillation, chromatography, recrystallization or the like. Without an after-treatment, a reaction solution may be provided for next reaction.<br>
Thus obtained cyclopropylpropionic acid derivative (VI) can be subjected to an elimination reaction in the presence of a base so as to be transformed to a cyclopropylacrylic acid derivative (I).<br>
Examples of the bases used here includes amines such as pyridine, triethylamine or the like; carbonates such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate or the like; metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or the like; and metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium tert-butoxide or the like. Amount of a base is preferably in the range of 0.01 equivalent to 100 equivalents of a cyclopropylpropionic acid derivative (VI).<br>
A reaction may be conducted in any solvent as far as it gives no adverse influence on the reaction. Examples of the solvents include hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, petroleum ether, benzene, toluene, xylene or the like; ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tert-butylmethyl ether, anisole, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyleneglycol dimethyl ether, triethyleneglycol dimethyl ether or the like; halogenatedhydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, trichloroethane,<br>
-17-<br><br>
bromopropane, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene or the like; acetates such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, tert-butyl acetate or the like; dimethyl sulfoxide; or a mixture solvent thereof. Any of the above mentioned bases which are in a liquid state may be used as a solvent. Generally, amount of a solvent is preferably in the range of 1 to 200 times as much as a weight of a cyclopropylpropionic acid derivative (VI).<br>
A reaction is conducted by adding a base or its solution to a cyclopropylpropionic acid derivative (VI) or its solution, or the cyclopropylpropionic acid derivative (VI) or its solution to the base or its solution. A temperature of the reaction is preferably in the range of -200°C to 100°C, or more preferably in the range of -20°C to the boiling point of a solvent used. Water or alcohol produced in the reaction may be removed outside the reaction system using means such as azeotropic distillation or the like.<br>
Thus obtained cyclopropylacrylic acid derivative (I) can be subjected to the above mentioned isolation and purification.<br>
Step 1-2:<br>
Next, a step of reacting a cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde derivative (V) with malonic acid in the presence of a base to obtain a cyclopropylacrylic acid derivative (1-1) will be described.<br>
-18-<br><br>
In a process, the reaction is conducted by removing water, which is produced by the reaction, to outside of the system. A method to remove the produced water to outside of the system is not specially restrictive and, for example, a solid dehydrating agent such as silica gel, molecular sieve, anhydrous sodium sulfate or the like can be used. From a view point of an industrial practice, a simpler method is removal of water by azeotropic distillation using an organic solvent.<br>
An organic solvent used here may be used as far as it does not give an adverse effect to a reaction of the present invention and gives azeotropic mixture with water.
