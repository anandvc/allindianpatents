				<td>PHOSPHORUS CONTAINING COMPOUNDS FOR REDUCING<br>
ACETALDEHYDE IN POLYESTERS POLYMERS<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention pertains to a process for reducing acetaldehyde formation in polyesters susceptible to the formation of acetaldehyde, i.e., those containing -OCH2CH2O- in a repeat unit and in particular to polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") and to PET prepared thereby. Polyesters can be prepared by melt polycondensation, with or without subsequent solid state polymerization.<br>
2.	Background Art<br>
Polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") is used extensively in packaging applications, in particular as beverage containers. In these applications, it is important that the PET have a relatively high molecular weight, generally expressed as inherent viscosity ("IhV") or intrinsic viscosity ("It.V."), and low amounts of acetaldehyde.<br>
There are two types of acetaldehyde (AA) to be concerned about. The first is residual or free AA contained in the pellets or particles sent to preform molders. The second type of AA is preform AA or the AA generated when the PET pellets are melt processed to make bottle preforms. AA precursors in the pellets can be converted to AA upon melting and give unacceptable levels of AA in the preforms. Melt processing also forms more AA precursors, which can liberate AA. Acetaldehyde has a noticeable taste and can be detected by human taste buds at low levels. When the preforms are blown into bottles, unacceptably high AA levels are those that adversely impact the taste of the beverage contained in the said bottles.<br>
Relatively tasteless beverages such as water are particularly negatively impacted by the strong taste of AA. Many water bottle applications require lower levels of perform AA than carbonated soft drink ("CSD") bottle applications. Converters who take polyester particles and make bottle preforms would like to have one resin that could be used to make preforms for both water and CSD applications. This would simplify the materials handling process at the converter by allowing for one feed silo or one type of feed silo, one product storage area or one type of product storage area etc. Most resins sold into water bottle markets have a lower It.V. than those resins sold into CSD markets. A dual use resin would have to a high enough It.V. for CSD applications and a low enough AA generation rate upon melting for water bottle applications.<br>
In order to use one resin, some converters are adding AA scavengers to CSD resins to get acceptable perform AA for the water market. AA scavengers add significant cost to the container and often negatively impact the color of the container by making it either more yellow or darker as compared to an analogous container without AA scavenger added.<br>
The conventional PET production process begins with esterification of predominantly terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, or ester exchange of predominantly dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol. The esterification need not be catalyzed. Typical ester exchange catalysts, which may be used separately or in combination, include titanium alkoxides, tin (II) or (IV) esters, zinc, manganese or magnesium acetates or benzoates and/or other such catalyst materials that are well known to those skilled in the art. The resulting mixture is then subjected to polycondensation in the melt at elevated temperature, for example 285°C, in the presence of a suitable catalyst. Compounds of Sn, Sb, Ge, Ti, or others have been used as polycondensation catalysts.<br>
Following melt phase polycondensation, which generally achieves an inherent viscosity in the range of 0.5 to 0.65, the polyester is extruded, cooled, and cut into granules, which are then subjected to a crystallization process wherein at least the exterior of the granules becomes crystalline. This crystallinity is necessary to prevent sintering and agglomeration in a subsequent solid state polymerization. Crystallization and annealing take place in a fluidized bed at temperatures of, for example 160-220°C, for several hours, as discussed by WO 02/18472 A2, and U.S. Patents 4,161,571; 5,090,134; 5,114,570; and 5,410,984.<br>
Solid state polymerization or "solid stating" takes place in a fluidized bed over a period of from 10 to 20 hours, at a temperature which is preferably in the range of 180°C to a temperature which is lower than the crystalline melt temperature by at least 10°C. Volatiles are removed in vacuo or by a flow of inert gas (e.g., nitrogen), or at lower temperatures, e.g. 180°C or lower, by means of a flow of air. A variation in this process is disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,393,871 where nitrogen containing water vapor is flowed through the solid stater.<br>
Solid stating has the advantage that relatively high inherent viscosities can be achieved. It has the further advantage that acetaldehyde content of the polymer is lowered substantially by the removal of acetaldehyde by volatilization. Solid stating has the considerable disadvantages of high energy usage and long processing time. Finally, solid state polymerization causes the pellets to develop shell-to-core molecular weight gradients, which results in a loss in inherent viscosity during the molding of articles that is theorized to be due to re-equilibration in the melt.<br>
It would be desirable to eliminate solid stating, but to do so would require more extended melt-phase polycondensation. In the absence of solid stating, removal of acetaldehyde present at the end of the melt phase polycondensation needs to be addressed. The situation is further complicated by the presence of acetaldehyde precursors which may later generate acetaldehyde, i.e., during injection molding of PET bottle preforms. Without solid stating,<br>
acetaldehyde precursors may remain at the concentration present after the melt-phase polycondensation.<br>
When antimony catalysts are used for polycondensation, phosphorous compounds have been added to assist in lowering acetaldehyde and acetaldehyde precursors. However, antimony is not the most active catalyst, and deactivation of antimony with phosphorus compounds, if not performed carefully, may generate haze in the product. Titanium compounds are known to be much more active polycondensation catalysts, and can reduce the polycondensation time significantly. However, titanium compounds, when employed in PET production, often produce polymers with higher residual acetaldehyde, and can also result in greater generation of acetaldehyde downstream from polymer production per se, for example during the molding of preforms. Titanium catalysts also impart a distinct yellow cast to the product as well.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,656,716 discloses use of high surface area titanium catalysts followed by addition of triphenyl phosphate. Without the triphenyl phosphate, a high inherent viscosity but distinctly yellow product was obtained, while with triphenyl phosphate, less colored products are obtained, but only at a low inherent viscosity, thus requiring solid stating of these products with its disadvantages.<br>
In WO 02/079310 A2, polyesters are stabilized against generation of aldehydes through addition of one of a diverse population of stabilizers, including sterically hindered amines such as Tinuvin® 123 or Tinuvin® 622 during initial esterification or transesterification. However, no salts of phosphorus-containing acids with these stabilizers are disclosed, nor is their addition late in a melt-phase polycondensation process.<br>
In U.S. published application 2002/0198297 A1, nitrogenous stabilizers selected from hydroxylamines, substituted hydroxylamines, nitrones, and amine oxides are employed to scavenge acetaldehyde generated during extrusion of polyesters or polyamides. No salts made from these nitrogenous-stabilizers with phosphorus-containing acids are disclosed, nor is addition late in the melt-phase polycondensation stage of polyester production.<br>
In World published application 2004/074365 A1, salts are made of hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) derivatives and organophosphorus acids. Addition of amine salts to polyesters during the melt-phase manufacturing is not disclosed, nor is reduction of acetaldehyde.<br>
In copending U.S. application Serial Nos. 10/639,712; 10/772,121; and 10/393,475, the disclosures of which are each incorporated herein fully by reference, phosphorus-containing acid salts of various amines and hindered amines are added during extrusion and disclosed as useful in maintaining polycarbonate molecular weight during extrusion of polyester/polycarbonate blends, while reducing color as well. Addition of amine salts to polyesters during the melt-phase manufacturing is not disclosed, nor is reduction of acetaldehyde.<br>
It would be desirable to be able to produce PET and other polyesters with an inherent viscosity suitable for production of food and beverage containers, without the necessity for solid stating, which exhibit lower content of acetaldehyde, and/or which generate reduced levels of acetaldehyde during further processing. It would further be desirable to produce PET in shorter reaction time, due to a more active catalyst than antimony, while maintaining or improving upon the AA properties of the product, with or without solid state polymerization.<br>
3.       Summary Of The Invention t<br>
It has now been surprisingly discovered that polyesters susceptible to acetaldehyde formation can be continuously produced in a melt phase process to have high inherent viscosity and low acetaldehyde content without solid stating polymerizing the polyester by polycondensing hydroxyl end groups of an ester linkage containing melt in the presence of a titanium polycondensation catalyst followed by adding a class of additives comprising phosphorus-containing acid salts of amines, preferably hindered amines containing both piperidine and triazine rings, late in the melt-phase polycondensation stager, i.e. after the It.V. of the polymer melt reaches 0.45 dL/g or higher, preferably 0.60 dL/g or higher, most preferably 0.75 dL/g or higher and prior to solidifying, eg. cutting into pellets. For example, the additives may be added anywhere between the last reactor and a pelletizer, such as after agear pump and prior to a filter. The additive may also be added near the end of last reactor. The additive may be introduced as a polymer concentrate or in a liquid carrier, or may be added neat (without dilution). The color of the Ti-catalyzed product is not adversely affected by the presence of the additives. If desired, the inherent viscosity may be further elevated by solid state polymerization.<br>

5.       Detailed Description Of The Invention<br>
f<br>
Suitable polyesters are generally known in the art and may be formed from aromatic or aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, esters of dicarboxylic acids, anhydrides of dicarboxylic acids, acid chlorides of dicarboxylic acids, glycols, epoxides and mixtures thereof. More preferably the polyesters are formed from diacids such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, and 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, and mixtures thereof, and diols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,4-butanediol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The process of the present invention can produce PET polyesters, which includes "modified" polyesters. Examples of suitable polyester polymers made by the process include polyalkylene terephthalate homopolymers and copolymers modified with one or more modifiers in an amount of 40 mole% or less, preferably less than 15 mole%, most preferably less than 10 mole%. Unless otherwise specified, a polymer includes both its homopolymer and copolymer variants. The preferred polyester polymer is a polyalkylene terephthalate polymer, and most preferred is polyethylene terephthalate polymer. By "modified" it is meant that the preferred diacid component and/or diol component are substituted in part with one or more different diacid and/or diol components.<br>
For example, the preferred diol component, e.g., ethylene glycol in the case of PET, may be substituted in part with one or more different diol components, and/or the preferred dicarboxylic acid component, e.g., terephthalic acid, in the case of PET, may be substituted in part with one or more different dicarboxylic acid components. The mole percentage for all the diacid component(s) totals 100 mole%, and the mole percentage for the entire diol component(s) totals 100 mole%.<br>
For example, the dicarboxylic acid component of the polyester may optionally be substituted with up to about 20 mole percent of one or more different<br>
dicarboxylic acids. Such additional dicarboxylic acids include aromatic dicarboxylic acids preferably having 8 to 14 carbon atoms, aliphatic dicarboxylic acids preferably having 4 to 12 carbon atoms, or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids preferably having 8 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of dicarboxylic acids to be included with terephthalic acid include: phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 1,3-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, stilbene dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexanediacetic acid, 1,12-dodecanedioic acid, diphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, mixtures thereof and the like. Polyesters may be prepared from two or more of the above dicarboxylic acids. Moreover, the foregoing dicarboxylic acids, which exist as stereoisorners, may be in their c/s-form, frans-form, or as mixtures thereof.<br>
In addition, the glycol component may optionally be substituted with up to about 20 mole percent, of one or more diols other than ethylene glycol. Such additional diols include cycloaliphatic diols preferably having 6 to 20 carbon atoms or aliphatic diols preferably having 3 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of such diols include: diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, propane-1,2-diol, propane-1,3-diol, butane-1,4-diol, pentane-1,5-diol, hexane-1,6-diol, 3-methylpentane-2,4-diol, 2-methylpentane-1,4-diol, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane-1,3-diol, 2-ethylhexane-1,3-diol, 2,2-diethylpropane-1,3-diol, hexane-1,3-diol, 1,4-di(hydroxyethoxy)-benzene, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-propane, 2,4-dihydroxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethylcyclobutane, 2,2-bis-(3-hydroxyethoxyphenyl)-propane, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxypropoxyphenyl)-propane, 1,2-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanediol, mixtures thereof and the like. Polyesters may be prepared from two or more<br>
of the above diols. Moreover, the foregoing diols, which exist as stereoisorners, may be in their c/'s-form, trans-form, or as mixtures thereof. It should be noted in this respect that presence of ethylene glycol residues, -OCH2CH2O-, is paramount, since in the absence of such residues, acetaldehyde generation is not problematic.<br>
The resins may optionally contain polyfunctional monomers, e.g., trifunctional or tetrafunctional comonomers such as trimellitic anhydride, trimellitic acid, trimethylolpropane, pyromellitic dianhydride, pentaerythritol, and the like. However, these are not generally preferred, and when used, are generally used in most minor amounts.<br>
The polyester compositions of the invention can be prepared by polymerization procedures known in the art sufficient to effect esterification and polycondensation. Polyester melt phase manufacturing processes include condensation of at least one dicarboxylic acid with at least one diol, optionally in the presence of esterification catalysts in an esterification zone, followed by polycondensation in the presence of a polycondensation catalyst in a polymerization zone which may in some instances be divided into a prepolymer zone and in the finishing zone; or ester exchange, usually in the presence of a transesterification catalyst in the ester exchange zone, followed in the presence of a polycondensation catalyst by a prepolymerization zone and finishing zone. Each of the polymers obtained may optionally be solid stated according to known methods.<br>
To further illustrate, a mixture of one or more dicarboxylic acids, preferably aromatic dicarboxylic acids, or ester forming derivatives thereof, and one or more diols, are continuously fed to an esterification reactor operated at a temperature of between about 200°C and 300°C, typically between 240°C and 290°C, and at a pressure of between about 1 psig up to about 70 psig. The residence time of the reactants typically ranges from between about one and five hours. Normally, the dicarboxylic acid(s) is/are directly esterified with diol(s) at elevated pressure and at a temperature of about 240°C to about 270°C. The esterification reaction is continued until a degree of esterification of at least 60% is achieved, but more typically until a degree of esterification of at least 85% is achieved to make the desired monomer and/or oligomers. The monomer and/or<br>
gligomer reaction(s) are typically uncatalyzed in the direct esterification process and catalyzed in ester exchange processes.<br>
Polycondensation catalysts may optionally be added in the esterification zone along with esterification/ester exchange catalysts. If the catalyst forms an insoluble salt with the dicaroxylic acid(s), the catalyst is added after the esterification zone. If a polycondensation catalyst was added to the esterification zone, it is typically blended with the diol and fed into the esterification reactor. Typical ester exchange catalysts which may be added to the ester exchange zone or reactor(s), and which may be used separately or in combination, include titanium alkoxides, tin (II) or (IV) esters, manganese, or magnesium acetates or benzoates and/or other such catalyst materials as are well known to those skilled in the art. Phosphorus containing compounds and some colorants may also be present in the esterification zone. Phosphorus containing compounds are not recommended to be present in an ester exhange zone as&gt;the ester exchange catalysts will be deactivated prematurely. To maximize rate and the effectiveness of the salt, it is preferable to wait and add all the phosphorus in the form of the salt near or at the end of the melt-phase process.<br>
The resulting products formed in the esterification zone include bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) monomer, low molecular weight oligomers, DEG, and water (or alcohol in the case of ester exchange) as the condensation by-product, along with other trace impurities formed by the reaction of the catalyst, if any, or by the reaction of starting materials and other compounds such as colorants, impurities in the starting materials or the phosphorus-containing compounds, if any. The relative amounts of BHET and oligomeric species will vary depending on whether the process is a direct esterification process in which case the amount of oligomeric species are significant and even present as the major species, or an ester exchange process in which case the relative quantity of BHET predominates over the oligomeric species. The water is removed as the esterification reaction proceeds to drive the equilibrium toward products. The esterification zone typically produces the monomer and oligomer<br>
mixture, if any, continuously in a series of one or more reactors. Alternately, the monomer and oligomer mixture could be produced in one or more batch reactors. It is understood, however, that in a process for making PEN, the reaction mixture will contain the monomeric species bis(2-hydroxyethyl)naphthalate and its corresponding oligomers, in lieu of BHET and its corresponding oligomers which will be present when making PET.<br>
Once the desired degree of esterification is completed, the reaction mixture is transported from the esterification reactors in the esterification zone to the polycondensation zone, which may comprise a prepolymer zone and a finishing zone. Polycondensation reactions are initiated and continued in the melt phase in the prepolymerization zone and finished in the melt phase in the finishing zone, after which the melt is solidified into product, or optionally precursor, solids in the form of chips, pellets, or any other shape. The solids can be optionally crystallized before or after cutting.<br>
Each zone may comprise a series of one or more distinct reaction vessels operating at different conditions, or the zones may be combined into one reaction vessel using one or more sub-stages operating at different conditions in a single reactor. That is, the prepolymer stage can involve the use of one or more reactors operated continuously, one or more batch reactors, or even one or more reaction steps or sub-stages performed in a single reactor vessel. In some reactor designs, the prepolymerization zone represents the first half of polycondensation in terms of reaction time, while the finishing zone represents the second half of polycondensation. While other reactor designs may adjust the residence time between the prepolymerization zone to the finishing zone at about a 2:1 ratio, a common distinction in many designs between the prepolymerization zone and the finishing zone is that the latter zone frequently operates at a higher temperature and/or lower pressure than the operating conditions in the prepolymerization zone. Generally, each of the prepolymerization and the finishing zones comprise one or a series of more than one reaction vessel, and<br>
the prepolymerization and finishing reactors are sequenced in a series as part of a continuous process for the manufacture of the polyester polymer.<br>
In the prepolymerization zone, also known in the industry as the low polymerizer, the low molecular weight monomers and oligomers are polymerized via polycondensation to form polyethylene terephthalate polyester (or PEN polyester, etc.) in the presence of a catalyst. If the polycondensation catalyst was not added in the esterification stage, the catalyst is added at this stage to catalyze the reaction between the monomers and low molecular weight oligomers to form prepolymer and split off the diol as a by-product. Other compounds such as phosphorus containing compounds, cobalt compounds, and colorants can also be added in the prepolymerization zone. These compounds may, however, be added in the finishing zone instead of or in addition to the prepolymerization zone and esterification zone. In a direct esterification process, phosphorus containing compounds are preferably added near the end or at the end of the melt-phase process in the form of salts of the invention. In a typical DMT-based process, those skilled in the art recognize that other catalyst material and points of adding the catalyst material and other ingredients such as phosphorus compounds vary from a typical direct esterification process.<br>
In the present application, polycondensation takes place in the presence of a titanium catalyst, preferably in the presence of from about 3 ppm (parts per million) to about 35 ppm of titanium from the catalyst, more preferably about 6-15 ppm titanium from the catalyst, in each case based on the weight of titanium in the polymer. During the polycondensation, preferably following completion of 90% or more of the total polycondensation time, an amine salt of a phosphorus-containing acid is added, preferably in amounts to supply of about 250 ppm phosphorus or less, more preferably about 5 to 90 ppm, and most preferably 15 to 80 ppm. The amounts are calculated in terms of the weight of elementalphosphorus relative to the weight of the polymer. The mole ratio of phosphorus to Ti (regardless of oxidation state) is preferably from about 1 to about 15, more preferably from 2.5 to 13.<br>
The titanium catalyst may be any titanium compound which exhibits a reasonable polycondensation rate. Preferably, the catalyst exhibits at least the same rate of polycondensation as is achieved using antimony triacetate or antimony trioxide, and more preferably exhibits a considerably greater rate of polycondensation in the absence of phosphorus compounds, for example a rate from 10 to 50 times higher than antimony triacetate or antimony trioxide, based in part on the weight of the catalytic element relative to the weight of the polymer. It has been found, for example, that a polyester of suitable inherent viscosity can be produced under similar conditions in shorter time than in an antimony catalyzed polycondensation, while also using much less catalyst. The titanium catalyst can be added anywhere in the melt phase process, such as into the esterification zone or the polycondensation zone. It is preferably added after at least 90% conversion in the esterification zone, or after completing esterification (which includes ester exchange), or between the esterification zone and the polycondensation zone, or to the beginning of polycondensation, or during prepolymerization.<br>
Preferred titanium catalysts include, in general, titanium (IV) compounds which are alkoxides, glycolates, acetates, oxalates, etc. Alkoxides and mixed glycolate alkoxides are preferred. Titanium (IV) isopropoxide is an example of a preferred catalyst. Many such catalysts are available commercially, i.e., under the trademark Tyzor® titanates from DuPont. Solid titanium compounds which serve as heterogenous catalysts are also suitable, including those disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,656,716, incorporated herein by reference. Titanium oxides and hydrated oxides may become solubilized during the course of the polymerization, for example by complexation and/or reaction with the glycol . component. If catalysts remain insoluble, at least in part, catalytic activity would be a concern, as would haze (lack of clarity). Soluble catalysts are preferred, more preferably, those catalysts which are soluble at the outset of the reaction. The titanium catalysts may be introduced into the reaction in any convenient manner. A solution of the catalyst in alcohol or a slurry of the catalyst in ethylene<br>
glycol may be used, for example, as may be a solution or slurry of the catalyst in an oligomer mixture. The catalyst may also be added alone, and distributed by agitation, i.e., by mechanical mixing or by use of a static mixer.<br>
This prepolymer polycondensation stage generally employs a series of one or more vessels and is operated at a temperature of between about 250°C and 305° C for a period between about five minutes to four hours. During this stage, the It.V.of the monomers and oligomers is increased up to about no more than 0.48 dL/g. The diol byproduct is removed from the prepolymer melt using an applied vacuum ranging from 4 to 70 torr to drive the reaction to completion. In this regard, the polymer melt is sometimes agitated to promote the escape of the diol from the polymer melt. As the polymer melt is fed into successive vessels, the molecular weight and thus the inherent viscosity of the polymer melt increases. The pressure of each vessel is generally decreased to allow for a greater degree of polymerization in each successive vessel or in each successive zone within a vessel. To facilitate removal of glycols, water, alcohols, aldehydes, and other reaction products, the reactors are typically run under a vacuum or purged with an inert gas. Inert gas is any gas which does not cause unwanted reaction or product characteristics at reaction conditions. Suitable gases include, but are not limited to argon, helium and nitrogen.<br>
Once an It.V. of no more than about 0.48 dL/g is obtained, the prepolymer is fed from the prepolymer zone to a polycondensation finishing zone where the polycondensation is continued further in one or more finishing vessels generally, but not necessarily, ramped up to higher temperatures than present in the prepolymerization zone, to a value within a range of from 270°C to 305°C until the It.V. of the melt is increased from the It.V. of the melt in the prepolymerization zone (typically 0.20 to 0.30 dL/g but usually not more than 0.48 dL/g) to an It.V in the range of from about 0.54 dL/g to about 1.2 dL/g. The final vessel, generally known in the industry as the "high polymerizer," "finisher," or "polycondenser," is operated at a pressure lower than used in the prepolymerization zone, e.g. within<br>
a range of between about 0.2 and 4.0 torr.  Although the finishing zone typically<br>
r<br>
involves the same basic chemistry as the prepolymer zone, the fact that the size of the molecules, and thus the viscosity differs, means that the reaction conditions also differ. However, like the prepolymer reactor, each of the finishing vessel(s) is operated under vacuum or inert gas, and each is typically agitated to facilitate the removal of ethylene glycol.<br>
Once the desired It.V. is obtained in the finisher, the melt is generally processed to convert the molten PET into amorphous solid pellets. The technique used for making a pellet is not limited. A suitable It.V. from the melt phase can range from 0.5 dL/g to 1.15 dL/g. However, one advantage of the present process is that the solid stating step can optionally be avoided. Solid stating is commonly used for increasing the molecular weight (and the It.V.) of the pellets in the solid state, usually by at least 0.05 units, and more typically from 0.1 to 0.5 units. Therefore, in order to avoid a solid stating step, a preferred It.V. from the rnelt phase, which can be measured on the amorphous pellets, is from at least 0.7 dL/g, or at least 0.72 dL/g, or at least 0.75dL/g, or at least 0.78 dL/g, and up to about 1.15 dL/g to 1.20 dL/g.<br>
The method and equipment for converting molten polymer in the melt phase reactors to pellets is not limited, and any conventional system used for making pellets is suitable in the practice of the invention. For example, strands of the polyester polymer melt are at least surface cooled to below the Tg of the polymer to form a cooled polyester polymer, followed by pelletizing the cooled polyester polymer to form solid amorphous pellets. These pellets may be optionally crystallized. Alternatively, the molten polymer may be extruded through a die and instantly cut into pellets before the polyester polymer cools below its Tg. These pellets may be optionally crystallized before the polymer cools below its T9.<br>
Preferably, the It.V of a polyester of this invention is from about 0.70 dL/g to about 1.2 dL/g. The It.V. can be determined from the inherent viscosity is<br>
measured at 25° C. using 0.50 grams of polymer per 100 ml_ of a solvent f consisting of 60% by weight phenol and 40% by weight 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity is typically reported as the It.V. of the polymer, which is a number calculated from the measured Ih.V. according to the equation set forth in the Example section.<br>
Also, although not required, additives normally used in polyesters may be used if desired. Such additives include, but are not limited to colorants, pigments, carbon black, glass fibers, fillers, impact modifiers, antioxidants, stabilizers, flame retardants, reheat aids, and the like.<br>
In addition, certain agents which color the polymer can be added to the melt. A bluing toner can be added to the melt in order to reduce the b* of the resulting polyester polymer melt phase product. Such bluing agents include blue inorganic and organic toners. In addition, red toners can also be used to adjust the a* color.<br>
Organic toners, e.g., blue and red organic toners, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,372,864 and 5,384,377, which are incorporated by reference in their entirety, can be used. The organic toners can be fed as a premix composition. The premix composition may be a neat blend of the red and blue compounds or the composition may be pre-dissolved or slurried in one of the polyester's raw materials, e.g., ethylene glycol.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition to, inorganic bluing agents can also be added to the melt to reduce its yellow hue. Cobalt (II) compounds, such as cobalt (II) carboxylates, are one of the most widely used toners in the industry to mask the yellow color of polymers. When direct esterification is not being used, the cobalt carboxylate can be added to the ester exchange reactor to also act as an ester exchange catalyst.<br>
The total amount of toner components added depends, of course, on the amount of inherent yellow color in the base polyester and the efficacy of the toner. Generally, a concentration of up to about 15 ppm of combined organic toner components and a minimum concentration of about 0.5 ppm are used. The total amount of bluing additive typically ranges from 0.5 to 10 pprn.<br>
The toners can be added to the esterification zone or to the polycondensation zone. Preferably, the toners are added to the esterification zone or to the early stages of the polycondensation zone, such as to a prepolymerization reactor.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the subject process differs substantially from prior processes in that it is capable of producing a product of sufficiently high inherent viscosity directly in the melt phase, without involving any necessity for a subsequent solid state polymerization, usually termed "solid stating." Avoidance of solid stating also may even allow direct molding from the melt. These advantages are achieved through the use of<br>
titanium catalysts in conjunction with amine salts of phosphorus-containing acids, which are added late in the polycondensation stage. It has been surprisingly discovered that the present method allows a reduced polycondensation time, creates a product of suitable inherent viscosity without solid stating, and produces a solid product exhibiting reduced acetaldehyde content and reduced acetaldehyde generation upon melting.<br>
The amine component of the amine salts of a phosphorus-containing acid can be chosen from all organic amines capable of salt formation, i.e. primary, secondary, and tertiary organic amines. The amines may be cyclic or acyclic, may be monomeric, oligomeric, or polymeric, and should be selected so as to minimize haze and/or solubility when the latter are issues. The organic constituents of the amine may in principle be any organic group. Organic groups which bear toxicologically suspect groups, or which decompose into toxic<br>
substances are generally undesirable. Groups which generate odiferous substances upon heating, or which cause excessive coloration, are also generally not desirable. Ammonia and related compounds like ammonium hydroxide are also suitable for use in the invention. When used in Ti-catalyzed polyesters containing - OCH2CH20 - in the repeat unit, some salts are more effective than others in terms of the % reduction in AA generation upon melting relative to a control (no additive). The selection of a salt and its amount for a given application depends on the required % reduction in AA generation upon melting. In general, the selected salt is the least expensive one that will give the required % reduction in AA generation upon melting, and the amount of salt is the lowest that will give the desired % reduction in AA generation upon melting. If reduced AA content rather than AA generation is the requirement, selection proceeds in an analogous manner.<br>
Suitable organic groups on the amine include linear and branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, heteroaryl, etc. Each of these<br>
types of organic groups may be substituted or unsubstituted, i.e. with hydroxy, carboxy, alkoxy, halo, and like groups. The organic groups may also contain carbonate, keto, ether, and thioether linkages, as well as amide, ester, sulfoxide, sulfone, epoxy, and the like. This list is illustrative and not limiting.<br>
Preferred amines are cyclic amines having a 5 to 7 membered ring, preferably a six membered ring. These rings may constitute a single "monomeric" species, or may be part of a larger oligomer or polymer.<br>
Preferred cyclic amines are hindered amines which have organic groups substituted at ring positions adjacent to the ring nitrogen. The ring nitrogen itself may also be substituted, i.e. by alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, and other groups. The hindered amines may also comprise a portion of an oligomeric moiety or polymeric rnoiety.<br>
Another type of preferred amines are amino acids. Amino acids with decomposition points at or above polymerization temperatures are especially preferred. The L-enantiomer, the D-enantiomer or any mixture thereof, including racemic mixtures, may be used. The amine group and the carboxylic acid group do not have to be attached to the same carbon. The amino acids may be alpha, beta or gamma. Substituted amino acids may be used. Amino acids with some solubility in water are especially preferred as this allows the synthesis of the salt to be done in water, i.e., without VOC's (volatile organic compounds).<br>
The carboxylic acid group of the amino acid opens up the possibility that the compound might be reacted into the polyester chain. Reaction into the polyester chain should result in less volatility and less extractability. Reaction into the polyester chain can also be accomplished if the organic portion of the salt contains a hydroxyl and/or a carboxyl group. If there is only 1 carboxyl or hydroxyl group, the salt could function as an end-capper. If there are a total of 2 reactive groups (carboxyl or hydroxyl), the salt may not always be at the end of the chain.<br>
The addition point of the phosphorous salt is desirably late in the melt-phase polymerization process. The late addition of the phosphorus salt occurs when the It.V. of the polymer is at least 0.45 dL/g. As the It.V. target of the product increases, the It.V. of the polymer when the salt is added also increases due to rate concerns. Various more specific embodiments include adding the salt:<br>
a.	at a location near the end of the finishing reactor or after the<br>
finishing reactor and before the cutter;<br>
b.	after the It.V. of the polymer has risen to to 0.5 dL/g, or to 0.6 dL/g,<br>
or to 0.68 dL/g, or to 0.72 dl/g, or to 0.76 dl/g, or to 0.80 dL/g<br>
c.	following at least 75% of the polycondensation time, or at least 80%,<br>
or at least 90%, or even at least 95%, of the polycondensation time.  The<br>
polycondensation time is the total time starting from initiating polycondensation to the point in time at which polycondensation is terminated or when the desired It.V. is obtained. For purposes of measuring time in this embodiment, when vacuum is released and the polymer melt exits the final reactor, the final It.V. is obtained even though it is recognized that a very minor It.V. lift or break may occur between the final reactor and cutter;.<br>
d.	to the polyester melt in the melt phase process at a point within 0.03 dl/g,<br>
or within 0.015 dL/g, of the final It.V. exiting the melt phase process; or<br>
e.	at a point within 10 minutes of less of solidifying the melt.<br>
Satisfying any of the conditions of these embodiments is deemed to also satisfy the condition that the amine salt is added at a point when the It.V. of the polymer melt is at least 0.45 dL/g.<br>
If the additive is added too early in the polymerization process, as defined by the ItV of the polymer, it may be more difficult or impossible to reach a high target ItV in a reasonable process time. Thus, as stated earlier, the additive is incorporated at a late stage in the polycondensation, preferably in the finisher or just prior to pelletization or other means of solidification from the melt to reduce the AA content in the formed solids.<br>
The precursor to the phosphorous moiety of the phosphorus salt may be any oxyphosphorus acid, including but not limited to hypophosphorous acid, phosphorous acid, phosphoric acid, polyphosophoric acid, polyphosphorous acids, pyrophosphoric acid, phosphinic acids, phosphonic acids, phosphate monoesters, phosphate diesters, phosphonate monoesters, pyrophosphate monoesters, pyrophosphate diesters, pyrophosphate triesters, or salts or compounds which still bear at least one acid hydrogen, etc. The hydrogen on any OH group bound directly to the P=0 group is acidic. Compounds with more than one acidic hydrogen may have one or more acidic hydrogens substituted with<br>
organic groups such as alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, etc., by polyether oligomers, polyester oligomers, etc. At least one salt-forming acidic hydrogen must remain, however. Oxyphosphorus acids with one or more hydrogen bound directly to the P=0 group may have one or more of these hydrogens substituted with organic groups such as alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, etc. 'Examples of these compounds include but are not limited to alkylphosphonic acids, alkylphosphinic acids and dialkylphosphinic acids. As with the amines, the organic groups may be substituted.<br>
The amines must contain at least one nitrogen capable of salt formation with a phosphorus-containing acid. In hindered amines containing N-alkylated piperidinyl moieties, for example, salt formation may involve the piperidinyl nitrogen, generating species such as (but not limited to):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
When there is one nitrogen in the amine compound that can form a salt, one mole of phosphorus-containing acid is used per mole of amine compound. When there are two or more nitrogen atoms in the amine compound that can form salts, two or more moles of acid can be used per mole of amine compound, up to an amount of acid, which creates salts having no remaining neutralizable nitrogen, or slightly in excess of this amount.<br>

Additionally, the hindered amine light stabilizers having above formulas (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18) and (19) wherein radical R10 is hydrogen or C1 - C22 alkyl and formula (15) wherein at least one of R15 and R16 represents radical A wherein R10 is hydrogen or C1 - C22 alkyl are particularly preferred as the basic organic component of a salt with an<br>
oxyphosphorus acid, which can be used to lower residual AA in pellets and/or AA generation upon melting for polyester compositions containing -OCH2CH2O- in a repeat unit.<br>
Examples of suitable amines include ammonia and its salts, alkyl and cycloalkyl amines such as methylamine, ethyl amine, n-propylamine, i-propylamine butylamine, n-hexylamine, 2-ethylhexylamine, dimethylamine, diethylamine, di(n-propyl)amine, di(i-propyl)amine, di-(n-hexyl)amine, di(n-octyl)amine, cyclopentylamine, dicyclopentylamine, cyclohexylamine, dicyclohexylamine, cycloheptylamine, cyclooctylamine, adamantane amine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri(n-butyl)amine, ethylene diamine, 1,3-propylenediamine, triethylenediamine, and polyalkylenepolyamines in general, diethanolamine, dipropanolamine, triethanolamine, tripropanolamine, fatty amines, di(fatty)amines, and the like.<br>
Hetrocyclic amines include piperine, piperidine, morpholine, aminopyridine, and in particular, heterocyclic, non-aromatic amines substituted in one or more ring positions adjacent to the ring nitrogen, for example 2,6-dimethylpiperidine, 2-methyl-6-ethylpiperidine, 2,6-di(isopropyl)piperidine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine, and the like. The same types of substitution patterns are useful with other cyclic amines. The substituent and substituent patterns are illustrative and not limiting.<br>
In general, it is preferred that the amines used be of relatively high vapor pressure, and thus it is not preferred to employ low molecular weight alkylamines such as methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylamine, and the like, since they may be lost due to volatility when the position of the equilibrium results in the unsalted form and/or these might pose a migration problem. Low molecular weight alkylamines that are substituted with carboxy and/or hydroxyl functionality(ies), which may react into the polyester chain, are preferred. Amino acids are examples of this class of compounds. The<br>
inner salt nature of amino acids results in high melting/decomposition points and, in some cases, gives some solubility in water, which eliminates volatile organic compounds (VOC) during the salt synthesis.<br>
By utilizing the process of the present invention, polymers with suitably high It.V. may be obtained in relatively short overall process times, and produce polyester product, for example in the form of pellets, which not only do not require the expense and increased process time of solid stating, but also contain less AA and generate less AA during future processing. If yet higher It.V. polymers are desired, the molecular weight may be increased further by solid stating. While this additional process step does involve extra time and expense, this is partially compensated by reduction in overall polymerization time in the melt phase; Moreover, solid stating will further reduce the AA content. Immediately following the finishing reactor and before pelletization, the amine salts of the invention may be added to molten polyester and blended with a static mixer or any effective mixing apparatus. Alternatively, the amine salts may be added near the end of the finisher reactor. In either case, the amine salts may be added neat (without dilution), in a slip stream of molten polyester, as a master batch in polyester pellets, i.e. a concentrate, or in a liquid carrier. The polyesters according to the present invention can be used in forming a variety of articles including sheets, films, tubing, profiles, preforms, fibers, woven and shaped articles, such as containers, and thermoformed articles such as trays and the like.<br>
Having generally described this invention, a further understanding can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples which are provided herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified.<br>
Examples<br>
Free acetaldehyde content in the polymer following addition of the respective additives is assessed as follows. Following the end of the array or lab preparation, the polymer is cooled for about 15 min., separated from the glass flask, cooled for about 10 min. and then placed immediately into liquid nitrogen. The polymer is ground cryogenically to pass a 3 mm screen. The residual or free AA sample is kept frozen.<br>
For  preforms,   it   is   sufficient   to   use   ASTM   #   F2013-00 describedbelow.  Since the polymer is melted in an extruder prior to injection molding, there is an opportunity for any AA precursors to be converted to AA. When experimental PET samples are prepared in the laboratory, there is usually not enough material to mold performs to test AA.  Experimental PET samples prepared in the laboratory are in the form of pellets or powders (most common).  In the case of PET pellets or powders, there has been no melting after the manufacturing; therefore to give the samples a melt heat history, pellets or powders are melted during the AA generation test described below prior to testing free AA byASTM # F2013-00.   The AA level from ASTM # F2013-00 on preforms cannot be compared directly to the AA level from the AA generation test on  pellets or powders;  however,  two  methods are correlated, and similar trends should be seen in each test.   A commercial polyester sold to make carbonated soft drink ("CSD") bottles (CB-12) is submitted every time the AA generation test is done on experimental samples. The AA level in preforms made from commercial pellet samples is usually well known at typical processing conditions and considered acceptable for CSD applications.   The AA generation results on the commercial polyester are considered as a benchmark: AA generation rates less than or equal to the AA generation value of the commercial pellets should indicate an acceptable level of preform AA for CSD applications at the time that the testing was done. The water bottle market can necessitate lower AA generation rates than those acceptable in the CSD bottle market.<br>
The acetaldehyde generation rate can be measured on the solid particles and the free AA can be measured on solid particles or preforms. The following method is used to measure acetaldehyde generation on solid particles.<br>
The method used to determine the level of free AA in the polyester polymer composition is the test method ASTM # F2013-00.   This test method is used to measure the level of free acetaldehyde in particles, powders, preforms, bottles, and any other form the polyester polymer composition may take. For purposes of measuring residual or free acetaldehyde, the sample is tested according to the method described below. However, for purposes of measuring the acetaldehyde generation, the sample has to undergo a second melt history in order to determine the level of acetaldehyde generated. If the sample is a particle or powder which has not undergone a melt step in addition to a prior melt phase polycondensation step, the sample is first treated according to the Sample Preparation procedure described below, after which the sample is submitted to the ASTM # F2013-00 test method for analysis.<br>
The test procedure for measuring the level of free acetaldehyde on a sample, whether a preform, pellet, powder, or other form is the ASTM # F2013-00 test method. Samples are cryogenically ground through a Wiley Mill equipped with a 1.0 mesh screen. The final ground material has a particle size less than 800 urn. A portion of a sample (0.20 g) is weighed into a 20-mL head-space vial, sealed and then heated at 150 °C for sixty minutes. After heating, the gas above the sealed sample of PET polymer is injected onto a capillary GC column. The acetaldehyde is separated, and the ppm of acetaldehyde present in the sample is then calculated. The amount of<br>
acetaldehyde calculated represents the amount of free or residual acetaldehyde present in the sample.<br>
To obtain the acetaldehyde generation rate, the ASTM<br>
#	F2013-00 test method as described above is also used, except that prior to<br>
testing the sample by the ASTM # F2013-00 test method, it undergoes a melt<br>
history in addition to the previous melt phase polycondensation. For<br>
measuring the acetaldehyde generation rate on preforms, it is sufficient to use<br>
this ASTM # F2013-00 Method as described above without subjecting the<br>
preforms to a further melt history since by virtue of making a preform, the<br>
pellets are melted in an extruder prior to injection molding. By melt extruding<br>
or injection molding, AA precursors in the polymer melt have the opportunity<br>
to covert to acetaldehyde. In the event that the sample is a particle or a<br>
powder which has not seen a subsequent melt history, the sample is prepared<br>
according the Sample Preparation method, and then submitted to the ASTM<br>
#	F2013-00 test. Sample Preparation: For the purpose of measuring the<br>
acetaldehyde generation rate, and if the sample has not seen a melt history<br>
subsequent to melt phase polycondensation, it is prepared according to this<br>
method prior to submitting the sample to the ASTM # F2013-00 test. Samples<br>
of polymer powder ground to pass a 3 mm screen are heated in an oven at<br>
115°C under vacuum (25-30 in. Hg) with a 4 SCFH nitrogen purge for at least<br>
48 h. Although overnight drying would be sufficient for water removal alone,<br>
this extended oven treatment also serves to desorb to about 1 ppm or less the<br>
residual AA present in the high IV powder after melt-phase-only synthesis and<br>
prior to AA generation testing. It would take longer to desorb residual AA from<br>
pellets to about 1 ppm or less, due to the larger particle size (longer diffusion<br>
path). Any suitable acetaldehyde devolatization technique can be employed<br>
on pellets which reduces the level of free acetaldehyde down to about 1 ppm<br>
or less, including passing hot inert gas over the pellets for a time period<br>
sufficient to reduce the residual acetaldehyde to the desired level. The<br>
acetaldehyde devolatization temperature should not exceed 170°C. The<br>
sample is then packed in a preheated Tinius Olsen extrusion plastometer<br>
using a steel rod. The orifice die is calibrated according to ASTM D 1238. A small amount of material is purged out the bottom, which is then plugged. The piston rod assembly is put in the top of the barrel. A 225 g weight may be placed on top of the piston rod to hold the rod down inside of the barrel. The polymer is held at 295°C for 5 min. The orifice plug is then removed from the bottom of the barrel. Via a large weight and operator pressure, the extrudate is pushed out of the barrel into an ice water bath. The extrudate is patted dry, sealed in a bag and placed in a freezer until the ASTM # F2013-00 test is performed.<br>
Alternatively, a CEAST Model 7027 Modular Melt Flow instrument is used. An AA generation program is initiated that will maintain a temperature of 295°C and will extrude the melted PET material in 5 minutes at a constant flow rate as defined in the firmware of the instrument. As the extrudate is pushed out of the barrel and into an ice water bath, the sample is collected, patted dry, sealed in a bag and placed in a freezer until the ASTM # F2013-00 test is performed.<br>
Acetaldehyde can be generated in polyester resins with the Ceast Model 7027 Modular Melt Flow or any similar extrusion plastometer instrument. The automated functions of this instrument reduce test variability by maintaining consistent contact times for the polymer inside the extrusion barrel. This particular model of instrument incorporates automated packing of the resin at the start of the test procedure. The instrument is equipped with a motorized platform that will push the material out of the barrel until the piston is at a specified height above the bottom of the barrel. The platform will then hold the piston rod in place, allowing the resin to heat up and generate acetaldehyde. At the end of the specified hold time, the platform extrudes the remainder of the resin out of the barrel while traveling at a constant speed. These steps eliminate the possibility of variability in results from packing the material through the final extrusion step. Variability in loading the polymer is reduced with the design of the barrel, but is not automated.<br>
Acetaldehyde can be generated in the above manner over a temperature range of 265°C to 305°C. The most consistent results are obtained between 285°C and 295°C. The length of time the resin is held inside the barrel shows good results when between 2 and 15 minutes. The range of 5 to 10 minutes shows the best repeatability and distinction between materials. For the AA generation numbers stated for this invention, 295°C and 5 minutes were used.<br>
Use of this method of acetaldehyde generation and testing allows for screening of polyester resins for acetaldehyde generation without needing large amounts of material for evaluations such as molding of bottle preforms. As little as 10 grams of material may be used in this process making it ideal for testing laboratory samples.<br>
Other polymer parameters may be measured by standard methods.<br>
The measurements of L*, a* and b* color values are conducted on polyester polymers ground to a powder passing a 3 mm screen. Color measurements were performed in reflectance (specular included) using a HunterLab UltraScan XE (Hunter Associates Laboratory, Inc., Reston VA), which employs diffuse/80 (illumination/view angle) sphere optical geometry. Results were reported using the CIELAB scale with the D65 illuminant and 10° observer. The spectrophotometer is standardized regularly and UV control was employed and maintained in calibration following the HunterLab recommendations. An optional glass port plate is installed at the reflectance port to minimize contamination of the sphere. Powders are placed in an optical glass cell. ,The optical-grade glass is recessed from the front of the cell by 0.062" and the glass itself is 0.092" thick. The sample area is 0.71" deep, 1.92 " wide, 2.35" tall. , The powders are allowed to settle by vibrating the sample for 20 seconds using a laboratory Mini-Vortexer (VWR<br>
International, West Chester, PA). The glass cell is maintained flush against the reflectance port and covered with a black opaque cover. A single cell packing is evaluated and the cell is removed and replaced for three replicate measurements for each sample. The reported value should be the average of the triplicates.<br>
The It.V. values described throughout this description are set forth in dL/g units as calculated from the inherent viscosity measured at 25°C in 60% phenol and 40% 1 ,1 ,2,2-tetrachloroethane by weight. Polymer samples are dissolved in the solvent at a concentration of 0.25 g/50 ml. The viscosity of the polymer solutions is determined using a Viscotek Modified Differential Viscometer. A description of the operating principle of the differential viscometers can be found in ASTM D 5225. The inherent viscosity is calculated from the measured solution viscosity.

Comparative Example A<br>
A sample of PET oligomer prepared from terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, and also containing about 1.5 mole percent of about 35% cis/65% trans 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol was employed in the polycondensation. The oligomer also contains about 1.2 weight percent of diethylene glycol, which was generated during esterification. This oligomer has about 95% conversion of acid groups via NMR/titration of acid groups, a Mn of about 766 g/mole, and a Mw of 1478 g/mole.<br>
For polycondensation, ground oligomer (103 g) is weighed into a half-liter, single-necked, round-bottomed flask. The catalyst employed is titanium tetrabutoxide and it is added to the flask. A 316 L stainless steel paddle stirrer and glass polymer head were attached to the flask. After attaching the polymer head to a side arm and a purge hose, two nitrogen purges are completed. The polymerization reactor is operated under control of a CAMILE™ automation system, programmed to implement the following array (Table 1).<br>
Table 1 (Table Removed)<br><br>
A molten bath of Belmont metal is raised to surround the flask, and the CAMILE™ array is implemented. In this array, a "ramp" is defined as<br>
a linear change of vacuum, temperature, or stir speed during the specified stage time. The stirring system is automatically calibrated between stages 4 and 5. After stage 6 ends, the vacuum level was ramped up to 140 torr, and then a 2 minute phosphorus addition stage (stage 8) begins. A phosphorus compound (not the amine salt of the present invention) is only added to the Sb controls. The finisher stage (13) is terminated when the stirrer torque is such that it reaches the target (predetermined for a given temperature and polymer rig) three times. The finisher stage time is referred to as "Time to IV." Following the end of the array or lab preparation, the polymer is cooled for about 15 min., separated from the glass flask, cooled for about 10 min. and then placed immediately into liquid nitrogen. The polymer is ground cryogenically to pass a 3 mm screen. The residual or free AA sample is kept frozen.<br>
The ground polymer is analyzed for acetaldehyde generation rate (AAGen), inherent viscosity, L*, a*, and b* color. The data can be seen in Table 2. The contour plot of Figure 1 indicates the acetaldehyde generation rate (at 295°C for 5 minutes) for different combinations of titanium levels and polycondensation temperatures at a vacuum level of 1.1 torr. The average AAGen of commercial PET pellets at the same time was 25.5 ppm. None of these are subject invention Examples; all are Comparative examples.<br>

Example A<br>
To make the phosphorous acid salts of CyasorbUV 3529, two moles of phosphorous acid were used per mole of CyasorbUV 3529, and reacted per the following procedure. The salts can be manufactured according to the description in per copending U.S. application Serial Nos 10/39,2575 ), which is fully incorporated herein by reference<br>
To a 5-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermocouple, and a heating mantle is added 411.76 g of Cyasorb UV-3529 and 945 g of toluene. Cyasorb UV-3529 is a polymeric hindered amine light stabilizer believed to conform generally to the compounds of amine formula (12) set forth above R6 = R? = RS = Rg = RIO = methyl; l_t is hexamethylene; and (R3)(R4)N- collectively represent a morpholino group. The slurry is<br>
heated to 60°C and stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained. Isopropyl alcohol (370 g) is added to the reaction vessel. A solution of 115.46 g (1.41 mol) of phosphorous acid dissolved into 370 g of isopropyl alcohol is added in a small steady stream (fast dropwise) via an addition funnel to the Cyasorb UV-3529 solution with rapid stirring over approximately 30 minutes. A homogeneous solution is obtained and stirred for 15 min once the addition is complete. The reaction mixture was pumped at about 5 mL/min into a 12 L reaction vessel that contained about 7 L of rapidly stirred heptane (4768 g) over a period of approximately 50 minutes. The feed rate of the reaction mixture into the heptane-containing vessel has some affect on the particle size of the final product. Slow feeds tend to produce a finer powder while higher feed rates will results in a larger particle that almost appears to be agglomerated. This needs to be balanced by the tendency for the salt to get sticky in the drowning vessel if the feed rate is too rapid. After addition was complete, the resulting slurry was stirred for about 60 minutes. The precipitate was collected by suction filtration. The filter cake was washed twice with 137 g of heptane and then sucked dry on the filter paper overnight. The solid was placed in a metal pan and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 50°C with a slight ingress of dry nitrogen. The dry product weighed approximately 531.8 g (101 % of theory). Typical bulk density of the dry salt has been between 0.4 and 0.6 g/mL.<br>
To test the phosphorous acid salts of Cyasorb UV3529, melt blending in a glass flask achieves a uniform distribution of additive within the polymer simulating the mixing of an additive near the end of or after the final polycondensation reactor. The polyester powders prepared above are weighed into 500 ml round bottom flasks. The powders are dried at 120°C under full vacuum overnight (about 16 hours) in a vacuum oven. After cooling the flask to about room temperature in a desiccator (about 1.5 hours), the additive is weighed into the flask. The additive was targeted at the 0.1 wt. % level. The blending parameters are set forth in Table 3.<br>
For mixing the amine salts with the polymers of Table 2, a polymer head with stirrer is attached and the flask purged twice with nitrogen. The CAMILE™ automation system is programmed for the following array, as set forth in Table 3.<br>
Table 3  (Table Removed)<br><br>
*= ramp<br>
A moderate nitrogen purge was employed at all times. During Stages 2 and 3, the stirrer is turned slowly by hand. Following the end of the array, the polymer is cooled, chopped, and ground to pass a 3 mm screen. The ground polymer is analyzed for acetaldehyde generation rate, inherent viscosity, L*, a*, and b* color. Inherent viscosity is measured at 25°C on a 0.50 g sample dissolved in 100 ml of 60% by weight phenol and 40% by weight 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. The results are presented in Table 4<br>
Table 4  (Table Removed)<br>
The contour plot of Figure 2 illustrates the AA generation rates at 295°C after 5 minutes, after blending about 0.1 wt. % of the phosphorous acid salts of Cyasorb UV 3529 into PET made with various Ti levels, temperature and vacuum levels. This contour plot demonstrates the dramatic improvement in AA generation rate with the additive present as compared to the previous contour plot (Fig. 1), which was prior to blending in the additive. Reductions in the AA generation rate ranged from 75 to 83%. These were calculated per the method described in Example B. The average AAGen of commercial PET pellets tested at the same time was 24.8 ppm, much higher than the examples with the additive. The examples with the additive have low enough AA generation rates upon melting to be used in water bottle applications and/or or dual water/CSD applications. A slight improvement in yellowness or b* color was seen with about 0.1 wt.% of the additive present.<br>
Examples B<br>
These examples use the melt-blending procedure outlined in Table 3 for the previous examples, and utilized 100 g of PET modified with about 2.6 mole % isophthalic acid and about 4.2 mole % diethylene glycol. This PET was produced on a production scale line with 10 ppm Ti and 0 ppm P. Examples prefaced with the letter "C" are comparative examples.<br>
The % reduction in AA generation at 295°C for 5 minutes (AA GEN 295/5) was calculated as follows: 1) an average AAGen for the runs with no additive was calculated to be 35.68 ppm, 2) the AAGen for a given run was divided by 35.68 ppm, 3) the quotient was multiplied by 100, and 4) the product was subtracted from 100. As can be seen from the Table 5, % reduction in AA GEN 295/5 was around 75% for around 55 ppm P from phosphorous acid salts of Cyasorb UV 3529 ("Cyasorb UV 3529-H3PO3"). The average AAGen of production control PET pellets tested at the same time was 23.5 ppm, much higher than the 8.5-9.3 ppm in the examples with an additive of this invention. The average L* color of the blends with phosphorus-containing additives were brighter by about one L* unit than the average of those without the additive. The average a* color of the blends with phosphorus-containing additives were more green by about 0.4a* unit than those without the additive. The average b* color of the blends with phosphorus-containing additives were less yellow by about one b* unit than the average of those without additive. On average, the inherent viscosities dropped moderately (
Example C<br>
This example uses the melting blending procedure in Table 3 and the polymer described in Example B.<br>
A further series of polymers were prepared, employing the same phosphorous acid salt of CYASORB UV 3529 as used in the previous Example A and Example B. The results are presented in Table 6.<br>
     Table 5  (Table Removed)<br><br>
                Table 6  (Table Removed)<br><br>
             Table 7   (Table Removed)<br><br>
Table 6 indicates that even at the very low concentration of 0.02 weight percent, the phosphorous acid salts of Cyasorb UV 3529 provides for a dramatic lowering (&gt; 70% reduction relative to no additive) of both residual acetaldehyde as well as acetaldehyde generated upon melting.<br>
Example D<br>
To make the phosphoric acid salts of CyasorbUV 3529, two moles of phosphoric acid are used per mole of CyasorbUV 3529, and reacted according to the following procedure.<br>
To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, thermocouple, and a heating mantle is added 41.18 g of Cyasorb UV-3529 and 94.51 g of toluene. Cyasorb UV-3529 is a polymeric hindered amine light stabilizer believed to conform generally to the compounds of amine formula (12) set forth above R6 = R7 = R8 = R9 = R10 = methyl; L1 is hexamethylene; and (R3)(R4)N- collectively represent a morpholino group. The slurry is<br>
heated to 60°C and stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained. A solution of 16.23 g (0.141 mol) of phosphoric acid dissolved into 37.01 g of<br><br>
isopropyl alcohol is added in a small steady stream (moderate dropwise) via an addition funnel to the Cyasorb UV-3529 solution with rapid stirring over approximately 100 minutes. If the addition is too rapid, big chunks of solids form and make it difficult to stir. A slurry with light-colored solids is obtained and is stirred for 15 min once the addition is complete. The precipitate is a mixture of a fine white powder and sticky amber globules coated with white powder and is collected by suction filtration. The filter cake is washed with seven 40 ml portions of heptane and then sucked dry on the filter paper for 2 h. The solid is placed in a metal pan and dried over the weekend at 50°C with a slight ingress of dry nitrogen. The dry product weighs approximately 36.48 g (66% of theory; fines in filtrate were not isolated).<br>
A further series of polymers were prepared, employing the phosphoric acid salt of CYASORB UV 3529 ("Cyasorb UV 3529-H3P04"). These examples use the melt-blending procedure outlined in Table 3 and the polymer described in Example B. For Example 23, the phosphorous acid salt of CYASORB UV 3529 is one described in Example A. Table 7 indicates that the levels of residual AA and AA generated upon melting were very similar for both the phosphoric acid salts of Cyasorb UV 3529 and the phosphorous acid salts of Cyasorb UV 3529. The average AAGen of production control PET pellets tested at the same time was 22.6 ppm. The runs with the phosphoric acid salt turned out to have a somewhat higher P level. The b* color, or yellowness, of the blends with the phosphoric acid salts may be slightly higher.<br>
Example E<br>
Further    inventive    additives    were    also    employed:    the phosphorous acid salt of N-methylpiperidine ("NMP-H3P03"), the phosphorous<br>
acid salt of ammonia ("Ammonia- H3PO3"), and the phosphoric acid salt of N-methylpiperidine ("NMP-H3PO4").<br>
To make the phosphorous acid salts of N-methylpiperidine, one mole of phosphorous acid are used per mole of N-methylpiperidine, and reacted according to the following procedure.<br>
To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, thermocouple, and a heating mantle is added 7.0 g of 1-methyl-piperidine (0.0704 mol) and 94.5 g of toluene. The slurry is heated to 60°C and stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained. A solution of 5.8 g (0.0704 mol) of phosphorous acid dissolved into 37 g of isopropyl alcohol is added in a small steady stream (fast dropwise) via an addition funnel to the 1-methyl-piperidine solution with rapid stirring over approximately 55 minutes. The reaction mixture was pumped at about 5 mL/min over a period of approximately 40 minutes into a 2 L reaction vessel, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, that contained about 700 ml of rapidly stirred heptane (476.8 g). After addition was complete, the resulting solution was stirred for about 50 minutes. Suction filtration was initiated and then stopped when the product was determined to be a yellow oil containing some fine white solids. The solvent was rotavapped off using a vacuum pump and 55°C water bath. The filter paper and flask were rinsed with heptane. The solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator. The oil was dried over night and then for about 5 hours at about 50°C with a slight ingress of dry nitrogen. The product weighed 7.5 g (12.75 g theory).<br>
To make the phosphorous acid salts of ammonia, one mole of phosphorous acid are used per mole of ammonia, and reacted according to the following procedure.<br>
To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, thermocouple, and a heating mantle is added 8.5 g of 28-30% ammonium hydroxide and 94.5 g of toluene. The slurry is heated to 60°C and stirred until<br>
a homogeneous solution was obtained. A solution of 5.8 g (0.0704 mol) of phosphorous acid dissolved into 37.1 g of isopropyl alcohol is added in a<br>
small steady stream (fast dropwise) via an addition funnel to the ammonium hydroxide solution with rapid stirring over approximately 25 minutes. The solution is stirred for 15 min once the addition is complete. The reaction mixture was pumped at about 5 mL/min over a period of approximately 35 minutes into a 2 L reaction vessel, fitted with a mechanical stirrerthat contained about 700 ml of rapidly stirred heptane (476.8 g). After addition was complete, the resulting solution was stirred for about 60 minutes. The solvent was rotavapped off using a vacuum pump and 55°C water bath. White semisolids were visible after all the solvent was removed. The flask was rinsed with heptane, isopropyl alcohol &amp; Millipore water. The solvents were removed on a rotary evaporator. The white solid is dried over night at 50°C with a slight ingress of dry nitrogen. The product weighed 7.3 g.<br>
To make the phosphoric acid salts of N-methylpiperidine, one mole of phosphoric acid are used per mole of N-methylpiperidine, and reacted according to the following procedure.<br>
To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, thermocouple, and a heating mantle is added 7.0 g of 1-methyl-piperidine and 94.5 g of toluene. The slurry is heated to 60°C and stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained. A solution of 8.1 g (0.0704 mol) of 85% phosphoric acid dissolved into 37 g of isopropyl alcohol is added in a small steady stream (fast dropwise) via an addition funnel to the 1-methyl-piperidine solution with rapid stirring over approximately 50 minutes. A yellow liquid with a white ring of solids is obtained and is stirred for 15 min once the addition is complete. After scraping sticky solids out of flask, the precipitate was collected by suction filtration. The filter cake is washed with eight approximately 40 ml_ portions of heptane and then sucked dry on the filter paper for 3 h. The solid is placed in a metal pan and dried over night and<br>
most of the next day at 50°C with a slight ingress of dry nitrogen. The product weighed 12.1 g.<br>
Per Table 8, the salts of the smaller, simpler bases had about half the reduction in AA generation of the UV 3529-H3PO3; however, the simpler salts are much less expensive.<br>
In addition to the further inventive additives, a run was also made to investigate the use of an amine additive itself, and not its salt. The results are presented in Table 8 below. The average AAGen of production control PET pellets tested at the same time was 22.0 ppm. Cyasorb UV 3529 did not reduce residual AA much; however, there was around a slight reduction in AA generation (10-15%). The amines alone are much less effective at lowering acetaldehyde than the amine salts made with a phosphorus-containing acid. Of the salts shown in Table 8, the ones with the smaller, simpler organic bases had about half of the reduction in AA generation than that of the Cyasorb UV 3529-H3PO3 salt.<br>
Table 8  (Table Removed)<br>
While the amine portion of the salt may scavenge some AA as shown in Example C20 in Table 8, without being bound to a theory, it is thought that the predominant mechanism is thought to be catalyst deactivation.<br>
Example F<br>
Choosing an amino acid as the organic base offers the possibility that the carboxylic acid group of the amino acid may react into the PET chain.<br>
To make the phosphoric acid salts of L-histidine, two moles of phosphoric acid are used per mole of L-histidine, and reacted according to the following procedure.<br>
To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar, thermocouple, and a heating mantle is added 10.94 g of L-histidine and 143.97 g of Millipore water. The slurry is heated to 60°C and stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained. A solution of 16.397 g of phosphoric acid dissolved into 37 g of Millipore water is added in a small steady stream (fast dropwise) via an addition funnel to the L-histidine solution with rapid stirring over approximately 35 minutes. The solution is stirred for about 35 min once the addition is complete. The clear solution was transferred to a single-necked, 500 mL round-bottomed flask. The aqueous solvent was removed by freeze drying. The liquid was frozen while manually rotating in a dry ice/acetone bath. A lyophilizer was used for 3 days, 4 hours and 17 min. The white solid weighed 24.829 g (theory 24.722 g). By XRF, wt./wt. % P in the white solid was 17.17% (theory 17.6%).<br>
To make the phosphoric acid salts of L-alanine, one mole of phosphoric acid are used per mole of L-alanine, and reacted according to the following procedure.<br>
To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, thermocouple, and a heating mantle is added 6.275 g of L-alanine and 94.5 g of Millipore water. The slurry is heated to 60°C and stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained. A solution of 8.201 g of phosphoric acid dissolved into 37.01 g of Millipore water is added in a small steady stream (fast dropwise) via an addition funnel to the L-alanine solution with rapid stirring over approximately 17 minutes. The solution is stirred for at least 15 min once the addition is complete. The clear solution was transferred to a single-necked, 500 ml round-bottomed flask. The aqueous solvent was removed by freeze drying. The liquid was frozen while manually rotating in a dry ice/acetone bath. A lyophilizerwas used for 1 days, 19 hours and 15 min. The clear, viscous oil weighed 14.808 g (theory 13.17 g). By XRF, wt./wt. % P in the clear oil was 11.92% (theory 16.6%).<br>
A further series of polymers were prepared, employing the phosphoric acid salt of L-histidine, phosphoric acid salt of L-alanine, both described above in this example, and the phosphoric acid salt of CYASORB UV 3529 ("Cyasorb UV 3529-H3P04") described in Example D. These examples use the melt-blending procedure outlined in Table 3 and the polymer described in Example B.<br>
Table 9 indicates the two amino acid salts of phosphoric acid reduce residual AA by 79-83% and AA generation upon melting by 65-66%. The CYASORB UV 3529 salt of phosphoric acid reduces residual AA by about 87%, AA generation upon melting by about 75%, and has the best color. While the % reduction in AA generation is about 10% less for the amino acid salts than for the Cyasorb UV 3529 salt, the amino acids are less expensive, copolymerizable (less extractability), and water soluble (no VOC during salt preparation). The color and clarity are better for Example 34 with the L-alanine salt than for Example 33 with the L-histidine salt. L-alanine is also more water soluble than L-histidine, which requires more dilute conditions to<br>
get it into aqueous solution. The phosphoric acid salt of L-alanine is an oil, which may make it more economical to add than a solid salt like the phosphoric acid salt of L-histidine.<br>
