The taxonomical properties of the above strains are as follows.<br>
(The taxonomical properties of the F-1529 strain)<br>
(1)	Morphological characteristics<br>
On each plate of oatmeal agar (hereinafter abbreviated as OA as the case may be), malt agar (2% malt extract + 1.5% agar: hereinafter abbreviated as MEA as the case may be) and potato dextrose agar (hereinafter abbreviated as PDA as the case may be), the colony had a floccose form and the color of the hyphae was white, exhibiting white (1A-1) tone. As to the<br>
growth when the strain was cultured at 25°C for one week, the colonies reached 75 mm in diameter on the OA plate, 75 to 80 mm in diameter on the MEA plate and 75 to 80 mm in diameter on the PDA plate. The colony had a zonate shape. Neither backside coloring nor the production of soluble pigment was not observed. The the color tone was described according to "Methuen Handbook of Colour (Kornerup &amp; Wanscher, 1978)".<br>
As a result of the observation using an optical microscope, the vegetative hyphae were colorless, had a smooth surface, were provided with no septum and had a width of 4 to 5 j^m. A swelled structure like that of a thick wall spore having a spherical form and a size of about 26.5 to 33 ^m was observed in a part of the hypahe. In the culture media to be subjected to the test, any structure that seems to be a genital organ was not formed even by culturing for a term not exceeding 3 weeks.<br>
(2)	18S rRNA gene analysis<br>
A mycelia of the F-1529 strain cultured on an agar plate<br>
was subjected to DNA extraction using Fast Prep FP120 (manufactured by Q-BIO gene) and Fast DNA Kit (manufactured by Q-BIO gene). PCR was practiced using puRetaq Ready-To-Go PCRbeads (manufacturedbyAmershamBiosciences) and PCRprimers NS1 and NS8 shown in Tables 1 and 2.  The PCR products were refined using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN) and then treated with ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Kit (manufactured by Applied Biosystems). As the sequencing primers, NS1, NS2, NS3, NS4, NS5, NS6, NS7 and NS8 shown in Tables 1 and 2 were used. The reaction products were refined using a Dye EX 2 . 0 Spin Kit (manufacturedby QIAGEN) and subjected to sequence analysis using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (manufactured by Applied Biosystems). Then, the sequenced fragments were combined together by using an Auto Assembler (manufactured by Applied Biosystems) to obtain the full length nucleotide sequence.<br>
Table 1 Primers used to determine nucleotide sequence of 18s rRNA gene (forward direction)<br><br>
Table 2 Primers used to determine nucleotide sequence of 18s rRNA gene  (reverse direction)<br>
Thus obtained 18S rRNA gene of the strain has a nucleotide sequence described in Sequence No. 9.<br>
The DNA sequence of a known strain was obtained from Japan DNA Data Bank (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/) to examine the homology of the 18S rRNA genes. As a result, this 18S rRNA gene had 99% (upstream 803 bases) homology with the 18S rRNA gene of Mortierella hyalina (GenBank, accession no. AY157493), 98% (full length) homology with the 18S rRNA gene of Mortierella chlamydospora (GenBank accession No. AF157143) and 98% (full length) homology with the 18S rRNA gene of Mortierella multidivaricata (GenBank accession No. AF157144).<br>

On each plate of oatmeal agar, malt agar and potato dextrose agar, the colony had a cottony form and the color of the hyphae was white, exhibiting white (1A-1) tone. As to the growth when the strain was cultured at 25°C for one week, the strain reached 80 to 85 mm in diameter on the OA plate, 85 mm in diameter on the MEA plate and 85 mm in diameter on the PDA plate. The colony<br>
nod a zonate shape. Neither backside coloring nor the production of soluble pigment was not observed. The color tone was described according to "Methuen Handbook of Colour (Kornerup &amp; Wanscher, 1978)).<br>
As a result of observation using an optical microscope, vegetative hyphae were colorless, had a smooth surface, were provided with no septum and had a width of 2 . 5 to 5 |J.m. A swelled structure like that of a thick wall spore, having a spherical<br>
form and a size of about 10 urn is observed in a part of the hyphae.  In the culture media to be subjected to the test, any structure that seems to be a genital organ was not formed even by culturing for a term not exceeding 3 weeks. (2) 18S rRNA gene analysis<br>
The 18S rRNA gene of the F-1530 strain was analyzed in the same manner as in the case of the F-1529 strain. Thus obtained 18S rRNA gene of the F-1530 strain had a nucleotide sequence described in Sequence No. 10.<br>
The DNA sequence of a known strain was obtained from Japan DNA Data Bank (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/) to examine the homology of the 18S rRNA genes. As a result, this 18S rRNA gene had 100% (upstream 803 bases) homology with the 18S rRNA gene of Mortierella hyalina (GenBank, accession no. AY157493), 98% (full length) homology with the 18S rRNA gene of Mortierella chlamydospora (GenBank accession No. AF157143) and 98% (full length) homology with the 18S rRNA gene of Mortierella multidivaricata (GenBank accession No. AF157144).<br><br>

(5)	Chemotaxonomy<br>
Meso-type diaminopimelic acid was detected from the cell wall of the AB-1896 strain. As major structural sugars of whole mycelia, xylose and mannose were detected. The type of acyl in peptide glycan of the cell wall was a glycolyl type. Mycolic acid was not detected. As major menaquinone components, MK-9(H4), MK-9(H6), MK-10(H4) andMK-10(H6) were detected.<br>
(6)	Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene<br>
A culture broth of the AB-1896 strain was collected and then subjectedto DNA extract ion us ing Fast DNA kit (manufactured by Q-BIO gene) . PCR was carried out in a reaction condition of 96°C/20 seconds, 50°C/20 seconds and 72°C/one minute in 30 cycles in total. As the primers,<br>
9F(5'-GTGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3' ) (sequence No. 11) and 536R (5'-GTATTACCGCGGCTGCTG-3') (sequence No. 12) were used.  The PCR product was refined using a MinElute PCR Purification Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN) to provide a sequencing sample.<br>
The sequencing was carried out using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (manufactured by Applied Biosystems) and a BigDye Terminator kit according to their standard protocols. As the<br>
primers, 9F and 536R were used.<br>
Thus obtained about 500 nucleotide sequenece on the 5' terminal side of the 16s rRNA gene of the present strain is described in the sequence no. 13.<br>
The DNA sequences of known strains were obtained from Japan DNA Data Bank (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/) to examine the homology of 400 to 500 bases on the 5' terminal side of the 16s rRNA genes. As a result, this 16s rRNA gene had 98% homology with the 16s rRNA gene of Micromonospora sp. DSM44396 (GenBank, accession no. AJ560637), 98% homology with a gene of Micromonospora purpureochromogenes (GenBank accession No. X92611) , 95% homology with a gene of M. Chalcea IF012135 (GenBank, accession no. D85489) which is a type strain of genus Micromonospora and 95% homology with a gene of Verrucosispora gifhornensis (GenBank, accession no. Y15523) which is a type strain of genus Verrucosispora.<br>
Although the AB-1896 strain had almost the same characteristics as the genus Micromonospora, it corresponded imperfectly to the genus Micromonospora in the point that arabinose was not detected but mannose was detected as the major structural sugar of the wholemycelia. Also, the AB-1896 strain did not correspond perfectly to the genus Verrucosispora in the point that the spores peculiar in Verrucosispora gifhornensis were not observed on the medium used to identify the strain. The present inventors of the present invention decided that the AB-1896 strain is actinomycetes belonging to<br>
the family Micromonosporaceae in consideration of the above taxonomical properties.<br>
According to the present invention, first in the process (A) , the macrolide compound 11107B which is starting material (substrate) is incubated in the presence of the above strains or products prepared by its cultured mycelia and further in the presence of oxygen. This treatment may be carried out by adding the substrate in the culture broth when culturing the above strains in an aerobic condition or, as the case may be, by adding the substrate in a suspension solution of the cultured mycelia of the above strains as it is or of a product prepared by homogenizing these cells with flowing gas containing oxygen, for example, air.<br>
The substrate may be added to the culture broth before culturing or when a fixed time passes after the start of culturing. The above mycelia may be produced by inoculating any one of the above strains into a medium containing a nutrient and culturing aerobically. The culturing of the strain for producing mycelia preparations or the culturing of the strain which is carried out in the situation where the substrate is added may be performed according to a method of culturing general microorganisms fundamentally.  However, in general, the culturing is preferably carried out in an aerobic condition by, forexample, flaskshaking culture and tankculture according to liquid culture.<br>
As the medium used for culturing, any medium may be used<br>
insofar as it contains a nutrient which microorganisms belonging to the genus Mortierella, the genus Streptomyces or the family Micromonosporaceae can utilize, and various synthetic media, semi-synthetic media and natural media may be all utilized. As themediumcomposition, various carbon sources such as glucose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, fructose, glycerin, dextrin, starch, molasses andsoybeanoilmaybeusedeither independently or in combinations.<br>
As the nitrogen source, there can be used a single or a combination of organic nitrogen sources such as pharma media, peptone, meat extract, soybean meal, fish meal, gluten meal, casein, dry yeast, amino acid, yeast extract, NZ-case and urea, and inorganic nitrogen sources such as sodium nitrate and ammonium sulfate. Additionally, for example, there can be added andusedsalts suchas sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate copper sulfate, iron sulfate, manganese chloride or cobalt chloride; heavy metal salts; vitamins such as vitamin B or biotin; and inclusion agents such as cyclodextrins, if necessary.  Further, when foaming is remarkable during culture, various defoaming agents can be appropriately added in the medium as necessary. When the defoaming agent is added, it is required to set at a concentration for not adversely affecting the production of an objective substance.<br>
The culture condition can be appropriately selected within<br>
the range at which themicrobial strain grows well and can produce the above-mentioned substance. For example, the pH of a medium is about 5 to 9, and preferably nearby neutral in general. The temperature of fermentation is usually kept at 20°C to 40°C and preferably 24°C to 30°C. The fermentation period is about 1 to 8 days, and usually about 2 to 5 days. The above-mentioned fermentation conditions can be suitably changed in accordance with the kind and property of microorganism used, external conditions and the like, and it is needless to say that an optimum condition can be selected.<br>
Also, the culture mycelia preparation is prepared by suspending mycelia separated by centrifugation or filtration or homogenized in a proper solution after the culturing is finished. Examples of the solution used for the suspension of the mycelia include the above-mentioned medium or buffer solutions such as tris-acetic acid, tris-hydrochloric acid, sodium succinate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate and potassium phosphate either singly or in combinations. The pH of the buffer solution is 5.0 to 9.0 and preferably 6.0 to 7.5.<br>
The 11107B substance as the substrate may be added in a culture broth or a suspension solution of mycelia either as a powder as it is or as a solution dissolved in a water-soluble solvent, for example, ethanol, methanol, acetone or dimethylsulfoxide. The amount of the 11107B substance added is preferably 50 to 5000 mg per 1 L of the culture broth in the case of the culture broth. After the addition of the<br>
substrate, procedures such as flask shaking or tank culture are conducted at 20 to 3*°C for about 1 to 5 days to run a reaction in an aerobic condition, whereby the 11107B substance as the substrate can be converted into the 11107D substance.<br>
Next, in the process (B) , the target 11107D substance is recovered from the incubated solution obtained in the above process (A) .  Suitable methods are selected from various known purification methods which are usually used to isolate microorganism metabolites and used in combination to isolate the 11107D substance from the reaction mixture in the process (A).  For example, extraction by an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, chloroform or toluene; various kinds of ion-exchange chromatography; gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex LH-20; the treatment of adsorption and desorption by absorption chromatography using a hydrophobia adsorbing resin such as Diaion HP-20, active carbon or silica gel, or thin layer chromatography; or high-performance liquid chromatography using a reverse phase column and so on may be used independently or in combinations or used repeatedly whereby the 11107D substance can be separated and purified.<br>

After the reaction, the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC under the analytic condition (c) described in Example 4 to give F-1529 strain (FERM BP-8547) and F-1530 strain (FERM BP-8548) which both had the peak of the 11107D substance in HPLC. Example 7 Conversion by F-1529 strain in a flask scale<br>
One loopful of the slant culture (potato dextrose agar)<br>
of Mortierella sp. F-1529 strain (FERM BP-8547) was inoculated<br>
into a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 25 mL of a seed medium<br>
(2.0% of potato starch, 1.0% of glucose, 2.0% of a soybean meal<br>
(ESUSAN-MEAT manufactured by Ajinomoto Co., Ltd.), 0.1% of<br>
potassium dihydrogenphosphate and 0.05% of magnesium sulfate<br>
heptahydrate) , and it was cultured at 25°C for two days on a<br>
rotary shaker to give a seed culture broth.  Further, 0.6 mL<br>
of the seed culture broth was inoculated into each of a 500<br>
mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 60 mL of a production medium<br>
(2.0% of potato starch, 1.0% of glucose, 2.0% of a soybean meal<br>
(ESUSAN-MEAT manufactured by Ajinomoto Co., Ltd.), 0.1% of<br>
potassium dihydrogenphosphate and 0.05% of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate) , and it was cultured at 25°C for three days on a rotary shaker.<br>
Each resulting culture broth ( 60 mL/500 mL Erlenmeyer flask, 18 flasks) was subjected to centrifugation conducted out at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to collect microorganism cells and then suspended in 60 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0). Next, a 100 mg/mL solution of the substrate 11107B substance in dimethyl sulfoxide was prepared, and each 0.6 mL of the solution was added. After the addition, it was shaken<br>
at 25°C for 22 hours to conduct conversion reaction. After the completion of the reaction, the culture broth was separated into the supernatant and the mycelia by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 minutes. The supernatant was extracted with 1 L of ethyl acetate. The mycelia was extracted with 500 mL of acetone and filtered to give an acetone extract solution. The acetone extract solution was evaporated to remove acetone and then extracted with 1 L of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers were respectively washed with water, dehydrated and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then combined with each other and evaporated, to give 1.21 g of a crude fraction including the 11107D substance. The crude fraction including the 11107D substance was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (Kiesel gel 60, 50 g) , eluted with 1200 mL of a mixture of ethyl acetate and n-hexane (90:10; v/v), to give 369 mg of a fraction containing the 11107D substance.<br>
The resulting fraction was subjected to preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) under the preparative HPLC condition (C) described in Example 4 to give an eluted fraction containing the 11107D substance. Then, the solvent was removed to give 180 mg of the 11107D substance. Example 8 Conversion by F-1530 strain in a flask scale<br>
One loopful of the slant culture (potato dextrose agar)<br>
of Mortierella sp. F-1530 strain (FERM BP-8548) was inoculated<br>

(2.0% of potato starch, 1.0% of glucose, 2.0% of a soybean meal<br>
(ESUSAN-MEAT manufactured by Ajinomoto Co., Ltd.), 0.1% of<br>
potassium dihydrogenphosphate and 0.05% of magnesium sulfate<br>
heptahydrate) , and it was cultured at 25°C for two days on a rotary shaker to give a seed culture broth.  Further, 0.6 mL of the seed culture broth was inoculated into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 60 mL of a production medium (2.0% of potato starch, 1.0% of glucose, 2.0% of a soybean meal (ESUSAN-MEAT manufactured by Ajinomoto Co., Ltd.), 0.1% of potassium dihydrogenphosphate and 0.05% of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate) , and it was cultured at 25°C for three days on a rotary shaker.<br>
Each obtained culture broth (60 mL/500 mL Erlenmeyer flask, 18 flasks) was subjected to centrifugation conducted at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes to collect microorganism cells and then suspended in 60 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0). Next, a 100 mg/mL solution of the substrate 11107B<br>
_ubstance in dimethyl sulfoxide was prepared, and each 0.6 mL of the solution was added. After the addition, it was shaken<br>
at 25°C for 22 hours to conduct conversion reaction. After the completion of the reaction, the culture broth was separated into the supernatant and the mycelia by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 minutes. The supernatant was extracted with 1 L of ethyl acetate. The mycelia was extracted with 500 mL of acetone and filtered to give an acetone extract solution. The acetone extract solution was evaporated to remove acetone and then extracted with 1 L of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers were respectively washed with water, dehydrated and dried using anhydrous sodium sulf ate and then combined with each other and evaporated to give 0.89 g of a crude fraction including the 11107D substance. The crude fraction including the 11107D substance was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (Kiesel gel 60, 50 g) , eluted with 1200 mL of a mixture of ethyl acetate and n-hexane (90:10; v/v) and then with 500 mL of ethyl acetate, to give 163 mg of a crude fraction containing the 11107D substance. The resulting fraction was subjected to preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) under the HPLC condition (C) described in Example 4 to give an eluted fraction containing the 11107D substance. Then, the solvent was removed to give 30 mg of the 11107D substance. Example 9 Isolation of AB-1896 strain<br>
