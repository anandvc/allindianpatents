Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fiber (Aromatic polyamide fiber 1414) is a structure fiber with general formula as follow:<br><br>
It can be prodiurti by a process comprising following steps: terephthalyl chloride and p-phenylene dumine as raw material, are polycondensed in NMP - CaCl2 as solvent under low temperature to poly (p-phenykm1 terephthal amide) resin, then undergoing liquul crystal spinning, being  cut to length us required, or is precipitated directly to shun fiber. The fiber has outstanding high strength (the highest tensile strength 200 OSHXMX. shearing 0.2V, elongation nt rupture 3%), high modulus of elasticity (up to 67 KN/mm2), high hot resistance (decomposition point 500°C), resistivity against fire, burning resistance, resistance to chemical corrosion and excellent property of insulation, therefore the synthetic fiber paper made of poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) as a main component of structural fiber also has the above-mentioned outstanding excellent properties.<br>
Because of insufficient binding force of the synthetic fibers, the synthetic fibers can not be papermaking shaping as a plant fiber docs. Binding of the synthetic fibers depends mainly on adhesion of melted liber. However the poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fiber docsn' t have a distinct melting point, therefore during papermaking shaping some fiber having lower melting point present as crosslinking fiber has to be added. When the paper blank of synthetic fiber is rolled at nearly melting point of the crosslinking fibei. the soft and meited crosslinking fiber binds the unmelted poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fiber to form net-like material, so as to be finalized. In ihis invention the polyethylene glycol terephthalate fiber (polyester fiber) is used as the<br>
3<br><br>
crosslinking fibre. Its structural formula:<br><br>
The sonening point of the noer is 238 - 2410C, melting point is 255 - 260°C. The fiber has higher softening temperature than using temperature of the synthetic fiber paper 220°C, and higher strength, excellent electric insulation. That the polyethylene glycol terephthalate fiber is added properly as a crosslinking fiber doesn't drop the physical mechanical index and electric insulation of the synthetic fiber paper too much. While stuffing is used, the amount of the crosslinking fiber used in the present invention preferably increases to 40 - 50 parts by weight, most preferably increases to 30 parts by weight.<br>
When the synthetic fiber paper is used in place where there are high-voltage and frequent or uninterrupted corona discharge being used, it is necessary to add and mix the powdered mica while papermaking, the ability for products resisting to corona discharge is strengthened by stuffing of powdered mica. The proportion of stuffing level depends on its uses, varying'from 0 to 50 parts by weight. While the stuffing level reaches 50 parts by weight (high stuffing), the product also has the properties of mica besides the properties of original high strength and high-temperature resistance etc.<br>
In the process for preparing the synthetic fiber paper of the present invention in order to increase dispersion of fiber in water, while mixing and pulping, a micro level of high viscosity material should be added to gets the pulp slurry to have some viscosity increases the movement resistance of fiber in the pulp, delays the twining and flocculating of fiber, so as to improve dispersing and suspending of the fiber in pulp, finally achieves the aim of increasing homogeneity of the synthetic fiber paper.<br>
The micro-level of residual viscosity increaser in the paper blank for papermaking shaping makes the fiber some adhesion, so that it makes the paper blank retain initial strength before finalizing, and will not get rupture in the process of transporting pulling apart from a foundation fabric. The process of papermaking can run smoothly.<br>
The viscosity increaser used in this invention can be selected from a group consisting of inorganic gel SM and polyethylene glycol Oxide PO. They can be either used separately, or as combination. The amount of it is about 0.3 - 0.8%. It can be able to be adjusted, depending on the viscosity of viscosity increaser, the type, gauge of paper and the type of papermaking machine. In general, the use level for thick paper is adequately more than for thin. The use level for stuffing paper is more than for no<br>
4<br><br>
- stuffing.<br>
In order to improve the homogeneity of paper blank for papermaking, it is very necessary for the poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fiber to have surface-preparation. This surface-preparation changes the properties of fiber surface, enhances an affinity of fiber to~water, so that the dispersing and suspending fiber in water persists for a longer time. There are many process for treating poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fiber. Here is a mechanical process or a mechanico-chemical combined process is used. It means that the poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fiber is beaten by a beater, then it will be shorn and torn to reduce the length of fiber and to make its surface roughness. While beating the micro-level of processing additives also can be added, after that it will be mixed and beaten, it is what is called the mechanico-chemical combined process. In practical production, it is also possible to apply poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fiber in two different lengths combined (especially suitable for super short fiber which is directly produced by precipitating process). Same effect result can be achieved.<br>
Because the synthetic fiber paper should have both a better tensile strength,<br>
elongation rate, density, and a higher tearing strength, initial tear, at the same time, it also<br>
should have the property of the best homogeneity in the process of papermaking, in order<br>
to resolve the contradiction between demanding fiber length of the tearing strength and of<br>
tensile strength, in present invention, a certain amount of untreated poly (p-phenylene<br>
terephthal amide) (long fiber) as skeleton of paper blank compounded in part of treated<br>
poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fiber (short fiber) is compounded in part and stuffed<br>
in the skeleton of the poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fiber to be untreated the<br>
interweaving of long fiber with short fiber trends further towards homogeneity thereby<br>
enhances of papermaking homogeneity of the paper blank and the interweaving density<br>
of fibers.	<br>
S<br>
Table-1. The effects of physical, mechanical properties of paper blank by compounding proportion of two types of poly (p-phynvlene terephthal amide) fibers<br><br><br>
It can be noted from table I that the tearing strength and initial tear increase as the use level of treated fibers increases, the tensile strength reduces as the use level of untreated fibers increases. The ratio of two types of poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fibers is preferably adjusted to 1: 0.34 thereby all relative properties are kept with satisfaction. When there are some special demands for the tearing strength and the tensile strength of paper due to different use, a satisfied products still can be produced through adjusting the ratio of two kinds of poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) fibers based on the indication shown in table 1.<br>
After the synthetic fiber paper is dried, because of weak adhesive force between fibers, the fiber of paper blank is slack, its mechanical properties are weak, accordingly, it has to be given treated by the hot-rolling setting to make the crosslink fiber (short cut filament of polyester) with low melt point soften, melt, and under the pressure it will be made to bind with (he fiber net made of untreated poly (p-phenylene terephthal amide) liber and lo be finalized, thereby il will be made to have required properties.<br>
In order to make the paper blank have sufficient mechanical strength to bear the strong tensile and prevent il fioin being rupture when hot-rolling at high pressure. More the step of hot-rolling at high pressure, the paper blank should be passed through the preheating roller to preheat it to the softening point of crosslinking fiber, and a lower prepressing pressure should he exerted on to make paper blank has sufficient mechanical strength<br>
Table 2. Hot-rollinu temDeniiurc and Dressure<br><br>
The higher the hot-rolling pressure is, the greater the density of the synthetic fiber paper will be. By means of changing the pressure of roller (linear pressure), a various types of products with different density can be obtained .<br>
When stuffing is being filled, in order to make the stuffing attain has enough adhesion, more crosslinking fiber should be made to be melted, at the same time the hot-rolling temperature should be properly to 265°  C.<br>
The process can be operated smoothly by mixing the stuffing (powered mica) with micro-level of processing additives while stirred at high speed to form pulp, then the<br>
6<br><br>
result mixture was compounded into the pu!p of fiber paper.<br>
In order to prevent the crosslinking fiber from being over melted and the technical properties of synthetic fiber paper being affected. The temperature of preheating and hot-rolling should be controlled precisely at a point of temperature selected, the error in temperature is ±1 °C.<br>
Because the heat conductivity coefficient of paper blank is lower, its heat conduction is slow, the thicker the synthetic fiber paper is, the longer the preheating lime will be.<br>
The synthetic fiber paper of the present invention is a kind of new synthetic imitciial with high performance. It is a paper-like material made of the synthetic fiber of iititmalic   polyamide   as   main   component   and   produced   by   special   papermaking 111 imology. It has high-temperature resistance (suitable used to be at—190 - 310°C, and i an be used for long time below 220 °C), high strength, low-deformability, resistivity -1'iiinsi fire, burning resistance, resistivity to chemical corrosion and excellent property 1 electric insulation. The low-density, middle-density, high-density paper of synthetic IM-I can he produced by the means of changing the character of fiber, the ratio of two itris. hot-rolling pressure  as required according to the different use.<br>
