				<td>The present invention relates to a herbal composition for the treatment of animal bites especially snake bite and early stages of hydrophobia and a process of preparing the same.<br>
Background<br>
In the far-flung rural areas vaccines and cures for bites inflicted by animals especially snake bite are not easily available. Besides, these medicines, both prophylactic as well as curative medicines are expensive and more often than not unavailable at the time of emergency. Moreover, these medicines are not effective once the symptoms of hydrophobia have started taking effect.<br>
The vaccines, which are generally available, are of animal origin. Chinese Patent no. CN1111998 discloses a herbal medicine preparation for the treatment of trauma and snake bite, which is prepared from Chinese medicinal materials including strigose hydrangea root, common embolic fruit, puberulous glochidion fruit etc.<br>
Another Chinese patent number CN1172661 describes a quick acting medicated herb wine for treating fracture and injury wound snake bite, bee bite with includes 14 Chinese-medicinal materials such as croton seed, common securidaca root, springleaf pricklyash rot, ford dutchmanspipe, cinnamon twigs etc.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a herbal remedy, which can be administered to victim of animal bite including those of snakes, monkey, fox, jackal, dog and scorpion. This said herbal remedy can also be used for treating early stages of hydrophobia.<br>
Summary<br>
To achieve the aforesaid object, the present invention provides a herbal composition for the treatment of animal bites, especially snake bites and early stages of hydrophobia comprising the extracts of Crotalaria prostrata, Solatium suratiense, Cassia occidentalis and Menispermaceae in the ratio of 4:1:1:1<br>
The present invention also includes a process for preparing the herbal composition comprising<br><br>
washing  and   drying  Crotalaria prostrata,   Solatium  suratiense,   Cassia<br>
occidentalis and Menispermaceae in the ratio of 4:1:1:1.<br>
pounding the parts together to bruise the cell wall until the parts are<br>
pounded to a pulp<br>
soaking the said pulp in water for a predetermined period<br>
decanting the solution to obtain the sediment which is stored for use<br>
in treatment.<br>
The quantity of water used is 24:1 v/w in proportion to the quantity of Crotalaria prostrata<br>
The pulp in soaked in water for 20 to 28 hours in a cool place.<br>
The sediment obtained after decanting the solution is 1:6 w/v to the quantity of water<br>
The extract of Crotalaria prostrata is prepared from the entire plant. The extract of Solanum stiratiense is prepared from the entire plant The extract of Cassia occidentalis is prepared from the leaves. The extract of Menispermaceae is prepared from leaves. Detailed description:<br>
Crotalaria prostrata is a herb with spreading branches which grows abundantly in forest and open places and is widely found in the sandy places all over India. C. prostrata is used in the treatment of rheumatism and according to CIMAP (Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants), Lucknow, it is also used for stomach disorder, pains in joint, high fever and nausea. C. prostata belongs to the family Papilionaceae (Karshimayi Ghas, Sanjivani of Kaliyug), is found in the plains in India and is also known as Chhota ]unjhuni or Vishnu Kamadi (karma).<br>
Cassia occidentalis also known as Kaasmard or Kasaudi is a four feet high herb, which is commonly found during the monsoon season in the plains. It is normally<br><br>
used to cure cough and congestion as well as skin elements. The leaves are also used to bring down fever. This plant is found in eastern UP in sandy areas and plains.<br>
Solatium suratiense is widely found in most part of India. This creeper is normally used as a blood purifier.<br>
Menispermaceae also known as Guruch is a perennial plant, which is normally found at 1000 ft. above sea label. Inis creeper is normally found growing on Neem trees. It is used in treating fever, cough and cramps.<br>
The herbal composition of the instant invention is prepared by washing the parts of Crotalaria prostrata, Solanum suratiense, Cassia ocddentatis and Menispermaceae in the ration 4:1:1:1. The parts are then dried to drain off excess water. The plant parts are pounded in a mortar and pestle until the cell wall is bruised and the beaten mass forms a pulp. The whole plant of Crotalaria prostrata is used along with the leaves of Menispermeaceae the full plant of Solanum suratiense and the leaves of Cassia ocddentalis.<br>
The pulp is the immersed in water for 24 hours in a place away from sun.<br>
The proportion in which these plant are used are now in the ratio of 4:1:1:1: i.e. four parts of Crotalaria prostrata for one part each of the other plants. The amount of water used for soaking the pounded pulp is in the ratio of 24 parts by volume of water to one part by weight of Crotalaria prostrata.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the foregoing example:<br>
Example<br>
One kg. of Crotolaria prostrata was washed and dried to take off excess water. 250 gms of entire plant of Solanum suratiense, leaves of Cassia ocddentalis, leaves of Menispermaceae are also washed and dried to remove excess water. All these ingredients are put in a mortar and pounded with a pestle until it formed a pulp and thereby in the process bruising the cell wall of the plants. The pulp so<br><br>
 obtained is soaked in 24 liters of waters and kept in a cool place in a covered container for 24 hours. The solution is decanted and the sediment which makes approximately 4 litres, is stored in 20 ml bottle for use for treatment.<br>
Dosage<br>
Patients of animal bites especially snake bite are given first dose followed by a second dose of 20 ml of the decanted solution after 15 minutes. It has been observed that the patients usually recover.<br>
In case of hydrophobia where hydrophobia has onset and is not in advanced stage, the patients are dosed 3 times a day, each being 20 ml. Patients are known to recover within a few days.<br><br><br><br>
