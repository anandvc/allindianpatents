This application claims priority to Provisional Patent Application serial number 60/876,200 filed on December 21, 2006 and entitled &amp;quot;Process for Manufacturing Large Volumes of an Ophthalmic Oil-in-water Emulsion&amp;quot;. This Provisional Application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br><br>
Oil-in-water emulsions are widely used in ophthalmic products. Typical preparations of oil-in-water emulsions involve dissolving water-soluble components in an aqueous phase and dissolving oil-soluble components in an oil phase. The oil phase is then vigorously dispersed into the aqueous phase, for example, by mixing at several thousand revolutions per minute (r.p.m) for minutes to several hours. This process is called emulsification. Emulsification is an energy-consuming process, in which thermal and kinetic energies are invested in order to disperse the oil phase into numerous droplets of very small size but having a large total surface area.<br><br>
Ocular comfort is of critical importance for commercial success in ophthalmic products. Emulsions containing a high concentration of oil (i.e., generally more than 6% v/v oil) are way too uncomfortable to be suitable for ophthalmic uses. Therefore, the ophthalmic industry produces highly diluted oil-in-water emulsions.<br><br>
Producing large volumes of diluted ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsions requires significant investment in capital equipment, and is both time and energy consuming. Emulsifying large batch sizes requires very high energy input, as only a small amount of the invested energy is actually used to emulsify the oil, the major part of the energy being dissipated in the large volume of aqueous phase. Moreover, yields of emulsification are generally not optimal. <br><br>
For large volumes, this above-described suboptimal process results in very long emulsification procedures with a potential negative impact on the chemical stability of emulsion components.<br><br>
Therefore, there is still a need in the art for new approaches for the preparation of oil-in-water emulsions for ophthalmic applications. Particularly desirable is the development of processes of preparation that overcome the above-mentioned problems and limitations associated with currently used processes.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention The present invention relates to an improved strategy for the preparation of ready-to-dilute oil-in-water emulsions. In particular, methods of preparation are provided that can be performed using equipments suitable for small to medium batch sizes. Compared to currently available processes, the methods provided herein exhibit satisfactory yields, require limited amounts of energy, and reasonable processing times.<br><br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to processes for manufacturing ophthalmic oil-in-water microemulsions or submicroemulsions . Such processes generally comprise steps of: (1) manufacturing a pre-concentrate of an emulsion, and (2) diluting said pre-concentrate emulsion with a diluting aqueous solution to obtain the desired oil-in-water emulsion .<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the pre- concentrate is in the form of an emulsion, which may be a cationic emulsion, an anionic emulsion or a non-ionic emulsion. In certain preferred embodiments, a pre-concentrate of the present invention is a cationic emulsion pre-concentrate.<br><br>
Processes according to the present invention aim at manufacturing thermodynamically stable oil-in-water microemulsion or submicroemulsions containing dispersed <br><br>
droplets, preferably having a mean size generally of more than about 10 ran and less than about 500 nm. For example, the mean size of the droplets may be of more than about 10 nm and less than about 300 nm, preferably less than about 200 nm. In certain preferred embodiments, microemuisions or submicroemulsions obtained using a process of the present invention are stable over periods of time in excess of about 12 months, preferably in excess of about 24 months, more preferably in excess of about 36 months. In another aspect, the present invention relates to processes for manufacturing pre-concentrates of ophthalmic oil- in-water emulsions, preferably of ophthalmic oil-in-water microemuisions or submicroemulsions. Such processes generally comprise a step of emulsifying an oil phase with an aqueous phase and at least one surface-active agent to obtain a pre- concentrate of an oil-in-water emulsion. A pre-concentrate prepared by such a process generally has a content in oil that is higher than the content in oil of the final oil-in-water emulsion prepared by dilution of the pre-concentrate. According to a preferred embodiment, a pre-concentrate of the present invention is not suitable for direct administration to the eye of a patient, but becomes suitable for ophthalmic use after dilution .<br><br>
More specifically, in processes of the present invention, a pre-concentrate of a desired oil-in-water emulsion is produced by emulsifying an oil phase comprising at least one oil that is suitable for ophthalmic use, with an aqueous phase and at least one surfactant. Oils that are suitable for ophthalmic use include, for example, castor oil, MCT, vegetal oils, mineral oils, and any combinations of these oils that are suitable for administration to the eye. In certain embodiments, the average hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of the surface- <br><br>
active agent (s) is advantageously substantially equal to the HLB or average HLB emulsion requirement of the oil or oils of the oil phase used in the preparation process.<br><br>
In certain embodiments, the oil phase may comprise one or more pharmaceutically active substances, including prodrugs. For example, pharmaceutically active substances may be selected from the group consisting of antibiotics, antiviral agents, antifungals, intraocular pressure lowering agents, antiinflammatory agents, steroids, anti-allergic compounds, anti- angiogenic compounds, biological agents, immunomodulating agents, cytostatics, antioxidants, UV-filter compounds, fatty acids, and the like.<br><br>
An advantage of the processes provided by the present invention is that they allow production of large volumes of emulsions without having to scale-up the emulsifying step.<br><br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to processes for preparing a desired ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsion by diluting a pre-concentrate obtained as described above. Such processes include diluting one volume of a pre- concentrate with 2 to 50 volumes of a diluting aqueous solution, such that the resulting ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsion has a content in oil of 5% v/v or less, preferably of 3% v/v or less, more preferably of 2% v/v or less, even more preferably of 1% v/v or less. Preferably, dilution is performed using 2 volumes of diluting aqueous solution for 1 volume of the pre- concentrate. More preferably, dilution is performed using 10 volumes of diluting aqueous solution for 1 volume of the pre- coπcβπtrdtθ<br><br>
One advantage of such inventive processes is that oil- in-water emulsions obtained by dilution of pre-concentrates are formed with a lower energy input than that required in currently used processes. <br><br>
In certain embodiments, the diluting aqueous solution comprises surfactants and/or additives, e.g., tonicity agents, viscosifying agents, buffering agents, preservatives, antioxidants, colorants or a micellar solution. Alternatively or additionally, the diluting aqueous solution comprises benzalkonium chloride. Alternatively or additionally, the diluting aqueous solution comprises one or more water-soluble therapeutic agent.<br><br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides pre- concentrates of ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsions prepared by an inventive process. In the context of the present invention, a pre-concentrate is defined as an emulsion which may form a diluted emulsion by dilution which may form an emulsion (e.g., a microemulsion or submicroemulsion) by dilution in an aqueous medium, preferably on dilution of 1:1 to 1:50 (v/v) , more preferably on dilution of 1:2 to 1:10 (v:v) . Thus, a pre- concentrate may be in a liquid form or in a gel form, or in any form suitable in view of its further dilution in an aqueous medium. A pre-concentrate in the meaning of this invention is an emulsion comprising a content in oil higher than the content in oil of the final ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsion. In certain embodiments, a pre-concentrate of an ophthalmic oil-in- water emulsion is not suitable for administration to a patient.<br><br>
In certain embodiments, a pre-concentrate of the present invention comprises droplets having a size substantially equal to the size to the final ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsion droplet size, e.g., greater than about 10 nm and less than about<br><br>
500 nm, less than about 300 nm, or preferably less than about<br><br>
2CO nm, preferably less than about 150 nm, typically less than about 100 nm.<br><br>
In certain embodiments, a pre-concentrate of the present invention is stable for periods of time in excess of 24 <br><br>
hours, preferably in excess of 3 days, more preferably in excess of 7 days .<br><br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsions obtained by dilution of a pre- concentrate as described herein.<br><br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of an oii-in-water emulsion prepared according to an inventive process disclosed herein. In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to the use of an oil-in-water emulsion prepared according to an inventive process disclosed herein for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of an eye disease or condition. In a related aspect, the present invention also relates to medicament comprising an oil-in-water emulsion prepared according to an inventive process disclosed herein.<br><br>
In still another aspect, the present invention provides methods for the treatment of an eye disease or condition in a subject. Such methods generally comprise a step of administering to the subject an effective amount of an ophthalmic oil-in-water emulsion prepared by an inventive process described herein. Administration may be by topical, intraocular or periocular routes. Such methods may be used to treat any eye disease or condition such as, for example, glaucoma, ocular inflammatory conditions such as keratitis, uveitis, intra-ocular inflammation, allergy, and dry eye syndrome ocular infections, ocular allergies, ocular infections, cancerous growth, neo-vessel growth originating from the cornea, retinal oedema, macular oedema, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, degenerative diseases of the retina (macular degeneration, retinal dystrophies), and retinal diseases associated with glial proliferation. <br><br>

Detailed Description of Certain Preferred Embodiments<br><br>
As mentioned above, the present invention relates to processes for the preparation of oil-in-water emulsions that<br><br>
■c have the advantage of producing emulsions suitable for use in ophthalmic applications with satisfactory yields and in <br><br>
reasonable times, and that can be performed using equipment small to medium batch sizes.<br><br>
I - Processes for the Preparation of Ophthalmic Oil-in-water Emulsions Processes provided by the present invention generally comprise steps of: (1) manufacturing a pre-concentrate of an oii-in-water emulsion, and (2) diluting the pre-concentrate obtained in step (1) with a diluting aqueous phase to obtain an oil-in-water emulsion that can be used in ophthalmic applications.<br><br>
A. Pre-concentrates of Oil-in-water Emulsions and Preparation thereof<br><br>
Methods of manufacturing a pre-concentrate of an oil- in-water emulsion according to the present invention generally comprise a step of emulsifying an oil phase with an aqueous phase and at least one surface-active agent to obtain the pre- concentrate. In such methods, the oil phase comprises at least one oil suitable for ophthalmic use.<br><br>
In the methods of the present invention, the step of emulsification may be performed by any suitable method including, but not limited to, methods using colloid mills, rotor/stator homogenizers, high pressure homogenizers, and sonicating homogenizers. In general, the emulsifying step requires an energy input lower than required in methods currently used for the preparation of a diluted ophthalmic oil- in-water emulsions. In certain embodiments, the emulsifying step requires an energy input which is between about 2 and about 50 times lower than that required in currently available methods. For example, the energy input may be between about 2 and about 10 times lower, between about 5 and about 25 times lower, or between about 10 and about 50 times lower. <br><br>
Oils suitable for ophthalmic use include, but are not limited to, castor oil, MCT, mineral oils, vegetal oils, and any comoinations of these oils that are well tolerated at the eye level. As used herein, the term &amp;quot;MCT&amp;quot; refers to medium chain triglycerides. Medium chain triglycerides generally have a high solubility in water, are not significantly susceptible to oxidation, and are well suited for ophthalmic applications. Examples of vegetal oils include, but are not limited to, cotton seed, ground nut, corn, germ, olive, palm, soybean, and sesame oils. Examples of mineral oils include, but are not limited to, silicone and paraffin.<br><br>
Methods of the present invention yields a pre- concentrate having a content in oil of between about 3% and about 50% v/v. For example, in certain embodiments, methods of the present invention yields a pre-concentrate having a content in oil of between about 6% and about 30% v/v. In other embodiments, methods of the present invention yields a pre- concentrate having a content in oil of between about 10% and about 20% v/v. In methods of the present invention, the step of emulsification which leads to the formation of a pre-concentrate is performed in the presence of an oil phase, an aqueous phase, and at least one surface-active agent (or surfactant). Surfactants suitable for use in processes of the present invention may be non-ionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, or anionic surfactants. Examples of non-ionic surfactants that can be used in processes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, poloxamers, tyloxapol, polysorbates [e.g., poiysorbate 80), polyoxyethyiene castor oil derivatives, derivatives of cremophors {e.g., cremophor EL, and cremophor RH), sorbitan esters, polyoxyl stearates, cremophors (e.g., cremophor EL, and cremophor RH), and combinations <br><br>
thereof. Examples of cationic surfactants that are suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, C10-C24 primary alkylamines, tertiary aliphatic amines, quaternary ammonium compounds selected from the group comprising iauralkonium halide, cetrimide, hexadecyl-trimethylammonium halide, tetradecyltrimethyl-ammonium halide, dodecyltrimethyl- ammonium halide, cetrimonium halide, benzethonium halide, behenalkonium halide, cetalkonium halide, cetethyldimonium halide, cetylpyridinium halide, benzododecinium halide, chlorallyl methenamine halide, myristalkonium halide, stearaikonium halide or a mixture of two or more thereof, halide being preferably chloride or bromide, cationic lipids, amino alcohols, biguanide salts selected from the group comprising or consisting of chlorhexidine and salts thereof, polyaminopropyl biguanide, phenformin, alkylbiguanide or a mixture of two or more thereof, cationic compounds selected from 1 , 2—dioleyl—3— trimethyl-ammoniumpropane, 1 , 2—dioleoyl—sn—glycerophosphatidyl- ethanolamine, cationic glycosphingo-lipids or cationic cholesterol derivatives, and any combinations thereof. Examples of anionic surfactants that are suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, lecithin, bile salts, fatty acids, and any combinations thereof.<br><br>
In certain embodiments, the average hydrophilic- lipophilic balance (HLB) of the surface-active agent (s) is of the order of the required HLB or average HLB (RLHB) of the oil or oils of the oil phase used for the preparation of a pre- concentrate. Preferably, the RLHB value of the oil(s) of the oil phase and the HLB value of the surface-active agent (s) are substantially equal. As used herein, the term &amp;quot;hydrophilic- lipophilic balance or HLB&amp;quot; has its art understood meaning. When used in reference to a surfactant, it refers to a measure of the degree to which the surfactant is hydrophilic or lipophilic, <br><br>
determined by calculating values for the different regions of the molecule. The meaning of HLB value and RHLB value is discussed, for example, in &amp;quot;Encyclopedia of Emulsion Technology&amp;quot;, P. Becher (Ed.), 1383, Marcel Dekker, 1: 217-220, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
