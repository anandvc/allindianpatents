				<td>New antimicrobial compounds, their synthesis and their use for<br>
treatment of mammalian infections<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to novel benzothiazin derivatives and their<br>
use as antibacterial agents in infectious diseases of mammals (humans<br>
and animals) caused by bacteria, especially diseases like tuberculosis<br>
(TB) and leprosy caused by mycobacteria.<br>
Thiazinone, their derivatives and their use as antibacterial agents,<br>
especially against mycobacteria (TB), laid open for public in AR 24 25<br>
67 Al, AU 37 04 400 Al, CA 13 22 551 Cl or EP 0 245 901 B1 for<br>
instance.<br>
As known, there is a threatening worldwide increase in tuberculosis<br>
infections with mycobacteria which developed resistance against the<br>
available therapeutics (B.R.Bloom, J.L.Murray, Tuberculosis:<br>
commentary on a reemergent killer. Science 1992, 257, 1055-1064).<br>
Extremely dangerous is the development of multidrug resistant (MDR)<br>
mycobacteria. These are mycobacteria, resistant at least against two of<br>
the most active tuberculosis drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin, but also<br>
against streptomycin, pyranzinamid and ethambutol. The proportion of<br>
MDR-TB in some countries is already more than 20%. Even more<br>
threatening became the situation since the first cases of XDR-TB<br>
(extremly resistant TB) were diagnosed last year in South Africa. Now<br>
XDR-TB is already spread over all continents. Mycobacteria causing<br>
XDR-TB are resistant against the first line TB drugs Rifampicin,<br>
Isoniazid, Pyrazinamid, Ethambutol and additionally against the second<br>
line chinolones and aminoglycosides. (Nature Med. 2007,13, 295-298)<br>
Together with the increased number of TB diseases generally, worldwide<br>
it causes about 2.000.000 deaths annually.<br>
For the treatment of such diseases, like (TB) or leprosy, there is an<br>
urgent need for new drugs with new mechanisms of actions, especially to<br>
overcome drug resistance and to overcome the known dramatic side<br>
effects of the available drugs.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The present invention aims at the generation of new compounds with<br>
activity against mycobacteria as potential new tuberculosis drugs to<br>
overcome problems concerning resistance and drug intolerance.<br>
Solution of the technical problem<br>
This aim has been solved by providing compounds of the formula I<br>

R3 and R4 are, independently of each other, H, a saturated or unsaturated,<br>
linear or branched aliphatic radical having 1-3 chain members, F, Cl, Br,<br>
lower alkoxy;<br>
R5 is H, a saturated or unsaturated, halogenated or unhalogenated, linear<br>
or branched aliphatic radical having 1-7 chain members;<br>
R6 is a radical:<br>
<br>
wherein X is saturated or unsaturated, halogenated or unhalogenated,<br>
linear or branched aliphatic radical having 1-5 chain members, or<br>
R5 and R6 together represent bivalent radicals wherein n is 1-4:<br>
<br>
R7- R13 are, independently of each other H or a saturated or unsaturated,<br>
halogenated or unhalogenated, linear or branched aliphatic radical<br>
having 1-5 chain members, phenyl, benzyl or R7 and R8 together, R10 and<br>
R11 together, R12 and R13 together represent a linear or branched aliphatic<br>
bivalent radical having 1-7 chain members;<br>

aliphatic radical having 1-5 chain members, F, Cl, Br, NO2, NH2, CF3.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the invention concerns compounds of the<br>

We used 4 different methods for the synthesis of new and novel 1,3-<br>
benzothiazin-4-one derivatives. Methods A, B and C propose to use as<br>
starting material well known polysubstituted 2-chloro(bromo)-<br>
benzcarboxamides, many of them described in the literature or can be<br>
easily prepared by analogues methods (Isaew S. G. Farm. Zh. (Kiev),<br>

R.W., Molloy B.B., Day W.A., Roush B.W., March M.M., J. Med.<br>
Chem., 1973, 16, 101 and many others).<br>
<br>
Method A<br>
The starting 2-chlorobenzcarboxamides were treated by 1,0-1,2<br>
equimolar quantity of the metal salts of dithiocarbamates in alcohols,<br>
aceton or in their mixture under 0-50°C for a period of about one quater<br>
of an hour to about 24 hours. Preferably, this reaction is conducted in<br>
alcohol at room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted by water<br>
and solid 2-dithiocarbamoylbenzcarboxamide was filtered off. For the<br>
next step it is possible to use crude product or to recrystallize it from a<br>
suitable organic solvent. 2-Dithiocarbamoylbenzcarboxamide was<br>
treated by light alkaly (e.g. Na2HPO4, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, etc) in water,<br>
alcohols or in a mixture of water/alcohol at a temperature of 50-100°C<br>
for 2-36 hours. Preferably, this reaction is conducted in a mixture of<br>
water/alcohol at 50-75°C for about 24 hours. When the reaction is<br>
complete, the 2-substituted-4H-1,3-benzothiazin-4-one is obtained by<br>
conventional recovery procedures, e.g. trituration with ethylacetate or<br>
dilution with water, filtration and recrystallization from a suitable<br>
organic solvent.<br>
Method B<br>
This method proposes to use excess of metal dithiocarbamate as light<br>
alkaly in the benzothiazinone cyclization and not to isolate 2-<br>
dithiocarbamoylbenzcarboxamide. So, the starting 2-<br>
chlorobenzcarboxamides can be treated with a 1,2-2,5 equimolar<br>
quantity of the metal salts of dithiocarbamates in alcohols, aceton or in<br>
their mixture at 20-80°C for a period of about 3-36 hours. Preferably,<br>
this reaction is conducted in alcohol or in a mixture of water/alcohol at<br>
50-75°C for about 24 hours. The aimed 2-substituted-4H-1,3-<br>
benzothiazin-4-one is obtained by recovery procedures from method A.<br>
Method C<br>
<br>
Method C<br>
This method uses as starting material 2-chlorobenzencarboxamides.<br>
These compounds were treated with 1,1-2,0 fold excess of metal salts of<br>
alkylxantogenate, for example commercial available potassium<br>
ethylxantogenate, at a temperature of 20-100°C in different alcohols,<br>
acetone, acetonitrile or other suitable organic solvents for a period of<br>
about one half hour to about 24 hours. Preferably, this reaction is<br>
conducted in alcohol at room temperature for about 24 hours. The<br>
isolated 2-alkoxy-4H-1,3-benzothiazin-4-one was treated with the<br>
corresponding amine HNR5R6 in acetic acid, alcohols, ethylacetate,<br>
DMF, aceton or acetonitril for a period of up to 48 hours for full<br>
exchange of the alkoxy group to the corresponding amine. After the<br>
process is completed the reaction mixture can be evaporated and diluted<br>
by water or it can be diluted by water directly. The aimed 2- NR5R6-4H-<br>
1,3-benzothiazin-4-one is recovered by customary isolation procedures,<br>
e.g. filtration and recrystallization from a suitable organic solvent.<br>
Method D<br>
The classical method of l,3-benzothiazin-4-one synthesis by use of the<br>
reaction of thiocyanate salts with 2-chloroarylchloroanhydride and a<br>
subsequent treatment of the reaction mass with the corresponding amine<br>
is usable too. This method is well described in the scientific literature,<br>
for example: J. Imrich, P. Kristian, Coll. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1982,<br>
47, 3268-3282; D. Koscik, P. Kristian, J. Gonda, E.Dandarova,<br>
Coll. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1983, 48, 3315-3328; D. Koscik,<br>
P. Kristian, O. Forgac, Coll. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1983, 48, 3427-<br>
3432; T. H. Cronin, H. - J .E. Hess, Pat. US 3522247.<br>
Surprisingly the compounds of the invention exhibit strong antibacterial<br>
activity, especially against mycobacteria with minimal inhibitory<br>
concentrations (MIC) in the range of 
growing mycobacteria, of 
including multiresistant strains, determined by the classical method and<br>
of 2.0 - 50.0 ng/ml for M. tuberculosis H37Rv determined by the<br>
Alamar Blue method. Surprisingly the compounds of the invention<br>
demonstrate a high level of selectivity for mycobacteria only which<br>
reduces the potential for adverse side effects dramatically.<br>
The compounds of the invention are non-mutagenic at 5 mg/ml in the<br>
SOS chromotest (M.Isidori, M. Lavorgna, A.Nardelli, L.Pascarella, A.<br>
Parella, Sci. Total Environ., 2005, 346, 87-98; M. Bombardier, N.<br>
Bermingham, R. Legault, A. Fouquet, Chemosphere, 2001, 42, 931-44;<br>
D.A. Widdick, D.I. Edwards, Mutat. Res., 1991, 259, 89-93).<br>
Thus, the compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of<br>
tuberculosis infections and other mycobacterial infections, in humans<br>
and in animals.<br>
Accordingly, the invention concerns pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising a compound of the formula I.<br>
The invention relates furthermore to a compound of the formula I for use<br>
in a method for the treatment of bacterial infections in mammals.<br>
Preferred compounds of the formula I for use in such method are those<br>
specifically listed above.<br>
The compounds of the invention are formulated for use by preparing a<br>
diluted solution or suspension in pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous,<br>
organic or aqueous-organic medium for topical or parenteral<br>
administration by intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection,<br>
or for intranasal application; or are prepared in tablet, capsule or aqueous<br>
suspension form with conventional excipients for oral administration or<br>
as suppositorium.<br>
The compounds can be used in dosages from 0.001 - 1000 mg/kg body<br>
weight.<br>
The examples which follow in the subsequent experimental part serve to<br>
illustrate the invention but should not be construed as a limitation<br>
thereof.<br>
The structures of the compounds of the invention were established by<br>
modes of synthesis and elementary analysis, and by nuclear magnetic<br>
resonance and mass spectra.<br>
Embodiments<br>
Starting materials<br>
Chemicals and solvents were purchased from Alfa-Aesar (GB) or from<br>
Aldrich Co. (Sigma-Aldrich Company, St-Louis, US) and were used in<br>
the synthesis without additional purification. Melting points were<br>
determined according to the BP procedure and are uncorrected<br>
(Electrothermal 9001, GB). If analyses are indicated only by the symbols<br>
of the elements, analytical results are within ±0.3% of the theoretical<br>
values (Carlo-Erba 5500, Italy). NMR spectra were determined with a<br>
Varian Unity Plus 400 (USA). Shifts for 1H NMR are reported in ppm<br>
downfield from TMS (5). Mass spectra were obtained using a Finnigan<br>
SSQ-700 (USA) instrument with direct injection. Reactions and purity of<br>
compounds were controlled by TLC using Silicagel 60 F254 aluminium<br>
sheets (Merck Co, Germany).<br>

Example 11<br>
Determination of the in vitro inhibitory activity of the compounds of the<br>
invention against mycobacteria.<br>
The antibacterial activities of the compounds against Mycobacterium<br>
smegmatis SG 987, M. aurum SB66, M. vaccae MET 10670 and M.<br>
fortuitum B were tested by determination of minimal inhibitory<br>
concentrations (MIC) by the broth micro dilution method in Mueller-<br>
Hinton broth (Difco) according to the NCCLS guidelines [National<br>
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards: Methods for dilution<br>
antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically; 5th<br>
Ed.; Villanova, Ed.; Approved standard Document M7-A5. NCCLS,<br>
(2000)]. The results are presented in Table 1.<br>
<br>
Example 12<br>
Activity against M. tuberculosis H37Rv was tested by the following<br>
method for determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC)<br>
and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC):<br>
Strains were inoculated onto solid Lowenstein-Jensen medium. After 21<br>
days, the cultures grown were used to prepare an inoculum suspension<br>
corresponding to 5 x 108 microbial cells/ml. With 0,2 ml of that<br>
suspension tubes with 2 ml liquid Shkolnikova medium, containing<br>
corresponding concentrations of compounds under study - from 100,0 to<br>
0,195 µg/ml, were inoculated. After 14 days of incubation at 37 °C the<br>
tubes with liquid medium were centrifuged for 15min. at 3000 RPM.<br>
After discarding the supernatant, the sediment was resuspended in 0,8 ml<br>
of sterile 0,9% NaCl. 0,1 ml of the suspension was used to prepare<br>
smears subsequently stained by the Ziehl-Neelsen method. The<br>
remaining sediment was inoculated in 0,2 ml volumes into three tubes<br>
with solid drug free Lowenstein-Jensen medium to determine minimal<br>
bactericidal concentrations (MBC). The results were read after 21-28<br>
days of cultivation at 37 °C. Controls were tubes cultured with test-<br>
strains not treated with the studied agents.<br>
Minimal bactericidal concentration of drugs (MBC) was considered as<br>
the drug concentration completely inhibiting the growth of mycobacteria<br>
on the solid medium. The bacteriostatic effect (MIC) was characterized<br>
by the presence of only individual mycobacteria in the smear and a<br>
strong decrease in the number of colonies grown on solid media<br>
compared to the controls. The results are presented in Table 2.<br>
