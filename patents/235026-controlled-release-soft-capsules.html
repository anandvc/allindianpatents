				<td>CONTROLLED RELEASE PREPARATIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to controlled release preparations and soft capsules. The invention relates further to emulsions and suspensions, including compositions and methods of manufacturing controlled release capsules where the fill contains a suspension and/or an emulsion.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Controlled release preparations have been a vital development in healthcare sciences. One advantage of such medicaments is improved patient compliance, especially where patients are under multiple or chronic treatments. Regarding the need to increase compliance rates, it is noted that the growing population of elder people further increases the demand for controlled release medication. Elderly patients often have particular difficulty with compliance for multiple daily dosages, especially in the context of a multiplicity of required medications.<br>
While patient compliance is an immediate benefit of controlled release products, minimization of side effects of potent medicines is also a desirable advantage of controlled release preparations. For example, tachycardia, a well-known side effect of the cardiovascular drug nifidipine, can be significantly controlled when the drug is administered in a controlled release form. In fact, using controlled release preparations helps avoid sudden high drug concentrations of drugs in the systemic circulation and reduces subsequent adverse effects or toxicity.<br>
Oral controlled release technologies are classified generally as of "matrix" or "film" nature. The matrix type is mainly used in tablets using polymeric or lipid materials that control both penetration of water and the release of the active ingredient to the surrounding environment. For example, U.S. Pat No 4,882,167 describes tablet compositions containing a hydrophobic carbohydrate polymer, e.g. ethyl cellulose and a wax material such as camauba wax and made by direct compression. Despite of the apparent simplicity of the direct compression technique, it has limitations when applied to low dose, potent active ingredients. The low amounts of potent drugs are hardly well distributed in a directly compressed matrix due to the<br><br>
uncontrolled differences in particle size and density between the drug and matrix particles. Such differences usually lead to lack of homogeneous distribution of the drug in the matrk and lack of content uniformity. To overcome the limitations of direct compression matrk manufacture, a wet granulation technique is often applied. An example of the wet granulation procedure is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,572,889 to Quo where granulation of active materials such as cabamazepine is performed in presence of water and polymeric substances. While wet granulation basically improves the distribution of an active material in a matrix, it is still considered a tedious and time-consuming technique.<br>
The second major technology for oral controlled release preparations is applying coating or films to control the drug release from particles (e.g., pellets or microcapsules) or unit doses such as tablets. U.S. PatNos. 5,871,776 and 4,572,833 provide details of preparing controlled release particles that can be filled into hard gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. While pellets or microcapsules are fairly popular in controlled release products, they are considered an intermediate product that requires additional manufacturing steps to produce as a useful dosage form, suitable for direct consumption by patients. On the other hand, coating unit doses such as tablets seems to be a more direct approach to manufacture oral controlled release Pharmaceuticals. Tablet coating for controlled release purposes has been quite well known in the pharmaceutical industry for a long period of time and is well illustrated in standard pharmaceutical text books (see for example Remington's Pharmaceutical Industries, 18th edition, Pages 1666 to 1675. Alfonso Gennaro, editor, Mack Publishing Co. Easto, PA, 1990). As experienced persons in the art would expect, unit dose coating has many drawbacks that may lead to performance failures due to defects in the coat, such as pinholes and sticking.<br>
Soft capsules have been tested as a controlled drug delivery system by Cohen, et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,795,642), where an aqueous fill of the polysaccharide gum sodium alginate forms a gel in presence of cationic elements such as heavy metal ions. However, the manufacture of soft capsules is presently the least utilized technique for producing oral controlled release preparations.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides numerous matrix systems based on lipids and lipophilic materials either alone or in presence of a hydrophilic phase. The described matrices have a hydrophobic surface in contact with the hydrophilic capsule shell to minimize any potential shell-fill interactions, as described elsewhere when soft capsules are filled with hydrophilic materials such as polyethylene glycol or similar vehicles.<br>
This invention provides compositions of controlled release products and methods of preparation thereof. The present invention also provides compositions and methods of manufacture of controlled release medicaments in the soft gel dosage form. The invention also provides methods for manufacture of the fill of a controlled release soft gel in the form of a suspension, where part or all of the active ingredient or drug is suspended or dissolved in a matrix. Also provided are compositions and methods where the active ingredient or drug of a medicament is incorporated in a one-phase or two-phase matrix.

In yet another aspect, the invention relates to controlled release hard shell capsules containing the matrix fills of the invention, hi particular embodiments, the matrix fills of the invention are encapsulated in two-piece hard shell capsules.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Generally, the controlled release soft capsules according to the invention comprise a shell and a matrix fill. The matrix fill can be a suspension-type matrix or an emulsion-type matrix.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention having a suspension-type matrix fill, the active ingredient or drug is incorporated in the matrix fill as solid particles in lipid or lipophilic materials such as vegetable oils, hydrogenated vegetable oils, fatty acids, waxes, or fatty acid esters, or a combination thereof. The matrix composition may further contain a release regulator to modify the release profile to suit an optimum therapeutic requirement. The release regulator can be a surface-active agent that enhances water penetration into the lipid or lipophilic matrix to increase drug release. Examples of release regulators are fatty acid slats, fatty acid esters, or fatty acid polyoxyethylene derivatives. Surfactants having HLB values between about 3 and about 40 can be selected as release regulators. The hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) characteristic of surfactants can be determined in accordance with "Physical Pharmacy: Physical Chemical Principles in the Pharmaceutical Sciences," Fourth Edition, pp. 371-373, A. Martin, Ed., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia (1993).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention having a suspension-type matrix fill, the matrix, at room or body temperature, can be in a fluid or structured solid state (solid, semi-solid, or gel). The drug can be partially soluble hi the matrix while the rest of the drug is in a solid form. The presence of drug in two physical forms, solid particles and solution, can be useful by providing dual release patterns where one drug state is released faster than the other form.<br>
In addition to suspension-type matrix fills, the invention also includes emulsion-type fills. Such fills are described herein as "emulsion-type" fills because they comprise an emulsion. The matrix fills for these embodiments can be characterized generally as emulsion-type fills, even though the active ingredient or<br><br>
drag can be present as a suspension in one or more phases of the emulsions of embodiments as described herein.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the soft gel matrix fill comprises two phases in the form of an emulsion (emulsion-type matrix). The emulsion can be a water-in-oil type emulsion. The internal phase comprises aqueous or hydrophilic materials, such as polyethylene glycol of molecular weight ranging from about 200 to about 8000. The internal phase can also be an aqueous or hydro-alcoholic solution comprising cellulose derivatives, polyacrylates, or polyvinyl polymers. Examples of such polymers include methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, polymethylmethacrylate, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The internal phase state can be "fluid" or "structured." A "fluid" internal phase, as used herein, means a completely flowable liquid whose globules can aggregate to make a larger globule. A "structured" internal phase, as used herein, means a solid, semisolid or a gel whose shape is relatively stable and does not usually aggregate to form a large globule. A structured internal phase therefore provides more controlled drug release and stabilizes the physical state of the matrix.<br>
The external phase of the matrix fill emulsion comprises lipid or lipophilic materials similar to those described above. The active ingredient or drug can be dispersed in the internal phase as a solution and/or as a suspension. The emulsion matrix can contain a surfactant or combination of surfactants having HLB values ranging from about 2 to about 20. The HLB range can also be from about 5 to about 15.<br>
In another embodiment, the matrix fill is of an emulsion type, where the drug is distributed in both external and internal phases. One portion of the active ingredient or drug in form of solid particles can be incorporated in the internal phase, while another portion is dispersed in the external phase as solid particles.<br>
This invention also provides methods for making controlled release products in a soft capsule form. The methods are applicable for production of controlled release preparations of low dose (potent) drugs that are highly water-soluble. The methods are also suitable for preparing controlled release products of relatively less potent, moderately water-soluble drugs.<br>
The suspension-type matrix fill compositions can be used for drugs that are moderately water-soluble at a dosage of between about 25 mg to about 500 mg. Such<br><br>
drugs include non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-asthmatics, e.g., diclofenac, naproxene, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, celecoxib, and theophylline.<br>
On the other hand, the emulsion-type matrix fill can be used for highly water-soluble molecules such as anti-asthmatics, narcotic analgesics, and analgesic antagonists as well as cardiovascular drugs, e.g., diltiazem, nifidipine, oxycodone, morphine, morphine analogues, and morphine antagonists.<br>
The suspension-type matrix fill can be manufactured by mixing the active ingredient or drug with the lipid or lipophilic matrix ingredients using mechanical or ultrasonic forces. Applying heat while or prior to mixing has the benefit of reducing the matrix viscosity. Reduced matrix viscosity in turn results in more efficient mixing. The matrix materials can be heated to temperature at or close to the melting point of the matrix composite. The melting point of the composite matrix is workable in the range of from about 25°C to about 70°C. The melting point range of the matrix composition can also be from about 30°C to about 50°C. The drug-to-matrix ratio can be concentrated enough to provide a low total mass per unit dose, yet can still be flowable to allow encapsulation using a rotary die encapsulation machine. A workable drug-to-matrix ratio range is from about 1:9 to about 1:1 by weight. The drug-to-matrix ratio range can also be from about 1:8 to about 1:1 by weight.<br>
The emulsion-type of matrix fill can be manufactured by dispersing the active ingredient or drug in the internal phase to provide a clear solution or suspension.  The active ingredient or drug can be dispersed using propeller or homogenizer mixers. The internal phase materials can then be added to the molten external phase containing surfactant from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight. The emulsion can be made using mechanical forces generated by a propeller mixer, a homogenizer, or a microfluidizer. The matrix is then cooled to a temperature of from about 20°C to about 35°C for encapsulation using a rotary die encapsulation machine. The internal-to-external phase workable ratio is in the range of from about 0.5:10 to about 1:1 by weight. The ratio range can also be from about 1:9 to about 1:1 by weight. The workable drug-to-matrix ratio can be from about 1:100 to about 1:2 by weight. The range of the drug-to-matrix can also be from about 1:50 to about 1:3 by weight.<br>
In an alternative aspect, the matrix fills of the invention are encapsulated in hard shell capsules. Guidance regarding hard shell, liquid filling technology can be. found in Walker, S.E., et a!., "The filling of molten and thixotropic formulations into<br><br>
