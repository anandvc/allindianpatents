				<td>PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
The present invention relates to design &amp; development of a double compartment winch with two ropes system, it is primarily designed to launch and retrieval of the Telescopic structural frames.<br><br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The Launch &amp; Recovery System will launch an object at a required depth in the sea from ship &amp; will retrieve it when required. The object will be launched in sea at a proper depth depending upon height of the deck of ship. The Launch &amp; Recovery System comprises Sliding platform, Telescopic launch frame, Tilting platform, Launch pad &amp; Hydraulic systems.<br>
&gt;	Base Frame structure assembly which is fixed on the ship.<br>
&gt;	The Sliding platform assembly which slides over the entire length of Base frame structure by Rack &amp; Pinion arrangement using hydraulic motor.<br>
&gt;	The Telescopic launch frame for the Launch &amp; Recovery system of an object is made in three segments to achieve the desired depth of Launch position.<br>
They are:<br>
•	Base segment<br>
•	Middle segment<br>
•	End segment<br><br>
&gt;	The base segment of Telescopic structural frames hinged to Sliding Platform.<br>
&gt;	Mid segment connects the base segment and the end segment.<br><br>
&gt;	The end segment holds the tilting platform with Launch pad in<br>
desired position with the help of two Hydraulic cylinders.<br>
&gt;	A hydraulic winch and rope-pulley arrangement is required to extend and retract the Telescopic structural frames up to a maximum of 7 meter during launch &amp; retrieval of the object respectively. The segments will come out sequentially.<br>
&gt;	The middle and end segments slide inside the standard rails of base and mid segments respectively with the help of combination roller bearings for their easy movements.<br>
&gt;	Two hydraulic cylinders hold the entire Telescopic structural frame assembly in desired position with respect to sliding platform during launching &amp; retrieval operations.<br>
&gt;	The object will be placed over the launch pad during launching &amp; retrieval. Rollers are fitted on the launch pad over which the object will be resting.<br>
&gt;	The launch pad can move back and forth on the tilting platform rails. Two links are provided to connect the launch pad with the Telescopic launch frame to move the launch pad in relation to Telescopic launch frame.<br><br>
During launching &amp; retrieval operation, the winch is required to ensure the controlled movement of the Telescopic structural frames sequentially. The connected structures are required to be operated without having slackness In the ropes.<br><br>
The Launch &amp; Retrieval operation requires two winches, i.e., one for launching and another for retrieval, along with an external control system to synchronize the operation of both winches. This will increase the cost of the system and space required for its installation. Due to space constraints and also to reduce the cost of the winch system, it was necessary to design &amp; develop a double compartment winch with rope system.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A double compartment winch is designed to operate Telescopic structural frames during launching and retrieval operations. A partition in the winch drum is created to accommodate the launch and retrieval ropes. The design is such that rope in the launch &amp; retrieval compartment unwinds &amp; winds simultaneously and vice-versa.<br><br>
The rope routing in double compartment winch is carried out with adequate tension in the wire ropes by using tension pulleys and idler pulleys at various places. Because of this, it was possible to meet the objective of synchronized sequential operation during Launching &amp; retrieval. The usage of modified single winch in turn, resulted in considerable saving of space by almost 50% and also brought about cost savings to the tune of about 38% as against the proposal for using of dual winches of same capacity &amp; external control system for synchronization.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The design of double compartment winch was taken up for this purpose. The partition was designed to separate the single winch into two compartments, i.e., one for launching and other for retrieval. Partition was created in an existing winch to accommodate the launching and retrieval ropes which were wound on the winch drum in opposite direction. The rope in the launching compartment unwinds then subsequent winding takes place at retrieval compartment and vice-versa, which ensures the synchronized control movement of Telescopic structural frames.<br><br>
The number of rope turns in each compartment was calculated for maintaining uniform velocity. The ropes were wound in opposite direction in each compartment, such that:<br><br>
•	During launching, the number of rope turns in launch compartment and retrieval compartment were nine and three respectively.<br>
•	During retrieval, the number of rope turns in launch compartment and retrieval compartment were three and nine respectively.<br><br>
Double compartment winch rope routing was carried out to create adequate tension in wire ropes and eliminate the slackness by using the tension and idler pulleys at various places.<br><br>
ROPE LENGTH CALCULATION<br>
ROPE FOR LAUNCHING COMPARTMENT:<br><br>
Condition 1: Launching (Open Condition)<br>
(A)	Length Routed in the system = 12878 mm<br>
 (*Assumption: Two extra turns considered)<br>
(B)	Extra turns to wound on the drum = 2 turns<br>
Length of one turn = TT * 290 = 910.6 mm<br>
 For 2 extra turns  = 910.6*2 = 1820 mm Total Rope length required = (A + B) = 12878 + 1820 = 14698 ~ 15 m<br><br>
Condition 2: Retrieval (Closed Condition)<br>
(A)	Length Routed in the system from flg-3 = 18836 mm<br>
(B)	Extra turns to wound on the drum = 2 turns<br>
Length of one turn = TT * 290 = 910.6 mm<br>
 For 2 extra turns  = 910.6*2 = 1820 mm <br>
Total Rope length required = (A + B) = 18836 + 1820 = 20656 - 21 m<br><br>
Hence, Length of rope meeting the conditions 1 &amp; 2 = 21 m<br><br>
ROPE FOR RETREVING COIVIPARTIMENT:<br><br>
Condition 1: Launching (Open Condition)<br>
 (A) Length Routed in the system from fig-2 = 7055 mm <br>
(B) Extra turns to wound on the drum = 2 turns<br>
Length of one turn = TT * 290 = 910.6 mm<br>
For 2 extra turns  = 910.6*2 = 1820 mm<br>
Total Rope length required = (A + B) = 7055 + 1820 = 8875 -9m<br><br>
Condition 2: Retrieval (Closed Condition) (A) Length Routed in the system from fig-3 = 1089 mm (B) Extra turns to wound on the drum = 2 turns<br>
Length of one turn = TT * 290 = 910.6 mm<br>
For 2 extra turns  = 910.6*2 = 1820 mm<br>
 Total Rope length required = (A + B) = 1089 + 1820 = 2909<br><br>
Hence, Length of rope meeting the conditions 1 &amp; 2 = 9 m<br><br>
CALCULATION OF NUMBER OF ROPE TURNS<br><br>
ROPE IN LAUNCH COMPARTMENT:<br>
Condition 1: Launching (open condition)<br>
Total Length = 21 meter<br>
In the Routed system= 12878 mm<br>
Length in the drum = 21000 -12878 = 8122 mm<br>
For Per turn in the drum = 910 mm<br>
No of turns = 8122 / 910 = 8.9 turns ~ 9 turns<br><br>
Condition 2: Retrieval (Closed Condition)<br>
Total Length = 21 meter<br>
In the Routed system= 18836 mm<br>
Length in the drum = 21000 -18836 = 2164 mm<br>
For Per turn in the drum = 910 mm<br>
No of turns = 2164 / 910 = 2.37 turns  3 turns<br><br>
ROPE IN RETRIEVAL COMPARTMENT:<br><br>
Condition 1: Launching (open condition)<br>
Total Length = 9 meter<br>
In the Routed system= 7066 mm<br>
Length in the drum = 9000 -7055 = 1945 mm<br>
For Per turn In the drum = 910 mm<br>
No of turns = 1945 / 910 = 2.1 turns 3 ~ turns<br><br>
Condition 2: Retrieval (Closed Condition)<br>
Total Length = 9 meter<br>
In the Routed system= 1089 mm<br>
Length in the drum = 9000 -1089 = 7911 mm<br>
For Per turn in the drum = 910 mm<br>
No of turns = 7911 / 910 = 8.69 turns ~ 9 turns<br><br>
CALCULATION OF THE VELOCITY OF ROPE:<br>
Dia of rope in 1st  layer = Drum dia + (2* dia of rope)<br>
                                      = 290+(2*18)<br>
                                      = 326 mm<br>
Speed (N)	              = 5.5 rpm<br>
Velocity (V)	              =n*D*N<br>
                                      = n * 326E-3* 6.5<br>
                                      = 5.63m/min<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:<br><br>
Referring to Drawing (Fig.1), it can be seen that, the routing details of system during launch. Tension and idler pulleys for the routing. The routing detail during retrieval is depicted in Fjg.2. If the winding takes place in the launch compartment then subsequent unwinding will occur at retrieval compartment. And also, at any point of time in the operation, both the ropes are in same layer to maintain uniform velocity. The same has figured out at Fig No.3 &amp; Fig.No.4 respectively. The partition is at the equal-distant in the winch drum since the no. of turns in the launch &amp; retrieval compartments during launch and retrieval operations is same. BEML Ltd had developed double compartment winch as shown Fig.5 and installed in the assembly and tested successfully for the intended operation.<br><br><br><br><br>
We claim,<br>
1.	The design &amp; development of double compartment winch with rope<br>
system was unique.<br>
A partition in the winch drum is created to accommodate the launch and retrieval ropes (Fig 3 &amp; 4). No. of rope turns in each compartment was arrived to ensure launching of the object with uniform velocity. The rope In each compartment was routed using tension and Idler pulleys (Fig 1 &amp; 2) to eliminate slackness in wire ropes. The design and development of the double compartment winch (Fig 5) with rope system resulted in considerable saving of space by almost 50% and also brought about cost savings to the tune of about 38% as against the proposal for using of dual winches of same capacity &amp; external control system. By using the double compartment winch (Fig 5), the operator's comfort and efficiency will be increased as he is not required to monitor the sequential operation critically.<br><br>
2.	The design &amp; development of double compartment winch with rope system for sequential operation of telescopic structural frames was unique as claimed in claim 1.<br><br>
3.	Partition created in the winch drum, which was equi-distant from its end to accommodate the number of turns in one layer only as claimed in claim1.<br><br>
4.	The number of rope turns in each compartment was arrived, to ensure the Launching of the object with uniform velocity as claimed in claim 1 at the required depth.<br><br>
5.	Rope routing was carried out using tension &amp; idler pulleys, to<br>
eliminate the slackness, as claimed in claim 1, in the wire ropes<br>
connecting Telescopic structural frames.<br><br>
6.	Design &amp; development of double compartment winch with rope<br>
system reduced the required space and cost by eliminating the<br>
need for a second winch and external control system as claimed in<br>
claim 1.<br><br>
7.	Operator's comfort and efficiency is increased as claimed in claim<br>
1, as he is not required to monitor the sequential operation<br>
critically, with the usage of double compartment winch, which<br>
ensures the synchronized control movement of Telescopic<br>
structural frames.</td>
