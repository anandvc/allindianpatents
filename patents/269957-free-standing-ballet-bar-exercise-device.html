				<td>BACKGROUND Field Of The Invention<br>
This patent relates to an exercise device. More particularly, this patent relates to a free standing ballet bar exercise device that can be collapsed for easy transport and storage.<br>
Description Of The Related Art<br>
Conventional ballet bars usually are mounted to walls, and so are limited to rooms in which a bar can be mounted to a wall. For home users of exercise bars this limits the choice of rooms in which to exercise.<br>
Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide an exercise bar that is free standing.<br>
Another object of the invention is provide a free standing exercise bar that is easy to set up and can be collapsed for easy transport and storage, for example in a closet or under a bed.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide an exercise bar that can be raised or lower to a desired height.<br>
Further and additional objects will appear from the description, accompanying drawings, and appended claims.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
The present invention is a free standing ballet bar exercise device that can be collapsed for easy transport and storage. In a preferred embodiment the<br><br>
device comprises a pair of legs and a pair of support arms pivotally attached to the legs at the legs' distal ends, an exercise bar mounted between the support arms at a height convenient to the user, a first lower cross bar connecting the legs intermediate their ends, an upper cross bar connecting the support arms, and a backboard attached to the upper cross bar and to the first lower cross bar to support the exercise bar in a free standing position. A second lower cross bar connects the legs at their distal ends. A floor board is hingedly attached to the backboard and adapted to lay flat on a floor to support the weight of the user. The floor board may be joined to the bottom edge of the backboard by one or more hinges. The hinges are releasably attached via a snap fit to the first lower cross bar and may be locked into place to the first lower cross bar by a spring loaded cammed handle. Cushioned mats cover the floor board and preferably the backboard as well.<br>
The support arms are telescopic and can be extended or retracted to enable the height of the ballet bar 16 to be adjusted. Spring loaded knobs mounted at either end of the upper cross bar adjacent the support arms are used to lock the support arms at the desired height. Likewise, the legs can be telescopically extended to enhance the stability of the unit.<br>
To use the exercise device, the user may stand, kneel, sit or otherwise rest on the floor board and stretch or perform exercises using the exercise bar. Because the floor board is attached to the backboard which is indirectly connected to the exercise bar, the user's weight and any downward force applied to the floor board maintains the ballet bar in position during use, even when the exercise bar is subjected to an upward force by the user.<br>
The unit is easy to set up and can be folded into a relatively flat, compact shape for convenient shipping and storage.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Turning to the drawings, there is shown in Figure 1 a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a free standing ballet bar exercise device 10. The device 10 comprises a pair of telescoping legs 12, each leg 12 having a proximal end which includes an optional rubber stabilizing foot 31 and a distal end 15 disposed away from the proximal end, telescoping support arms 14 pivotally attached to the legs 12 at the legs' distal ends 15, a height adjustable horizontal exercise bar 16 mounted between the support arms 14, a first lower cross bar 18 connecting the legs 12 intermediate their ends, a second lower cross bar 19 connecting the legs 12 at their distal ends 15, an upper cross bar 20 connecting the support arms 14, a backboard 22 pivotally attached to the upper cross bar 20 and releasably attached to the first lower cross bar 18, and a floor board 24 hingedly attached to the backboard 22. Preferably the backboard 22 and floor board 24 are covered by soft mats 25 as shown in Figure 2.<br>
Each leg 12 comprises an inner leg member 26 that slides within a sleeve or outer leg member 28. Detents 30 attached to the outer leg members 28 can be used to lock the inner leg member 26 in an extended position. To collapse the leg 12, the user pushes the inner leg member 26 inside the outer leg member 28. This releases the detent and the inner leg member 26 can be retracted inside the outer leg member 28. Feet 31 with rubber pads may be attached to the proximal ends of the inner leg members 26 for better stability.<br>
Similarly, each support arm 14 comprises an inner arm member 32 that slides within a sleeve or outer arm member 34. The exercise bar 16 is mounted between the upper ends of the inner arm members 32. Preferably, the exercise bar 16 is inserted through openings in the support arms 14 and held in place by set screws. The height of the exercise bar 16 can be<br><br>
adjusted by sliding the inner arm members 32 within the outer arm members 34 and locking the inner arm members 32 into the desired position. As best shown in Figures 4-6, each inner arm member 32 is locked into position by means of a spring loaded knob 36 mounted at either end of the upper cross bar 20 adjacent the outer arm members 34. To adjust the height of the exercise bar 16, the spring loaded knobs 36 are retracted (pulled away from the support arms 14), which allows the inner arm members 32 to slide freely within the outer arm members 34. The exercise bar 16 can then be adjusted to the desired height. When the bar 16 is at the desired height the spring loaded knobs 36 are engaged as shown in Figure 5. Preferably, the inner arm members 32 are angled toward the user as shown in the figures to better position the bar 16 over the floor board 24.<br>
As perhaps best shown in Figures 3,3A, 10 and 11, the floor board 24 is joined to the bottom edge of the backboard 22 by metal hinges 46 and arcuate connecting member 48. The backboard 22 is pivotally attached to the upper cross bar 20 and therefore indirectly to the exercise bar 16. The arcuate connecting member 48, and thus the backboard 22 and floor board 24, mates with the first lower cross bar 18 and is held or locked in place by a spring loaded cammed handle 38 (Figure 10). To release the backboard 22 and floor board 24 from the first lower cross bar 18, the spring loaded handle 38 must be retracted as shown in Figure 11. The floor board 24 may include more than one board hingedly connected together as shown in Figures 1 and 2 for a larger exercise surface.<br>
Figure 7 is another close up view of the ballet bar exercise device 10, and Figures 8 and 9 are close up views of one of the telescoping legs 12. An optional leg strap 40 may be connected to the outer member 28 of each leg 12 and used to secure the unit 10 when it is folded, as explained in more detail below.<br><br>
To set up the unit 10, the user starts with the unit 10 lying on the floor with the rear surface of the backboard 22 facing up as shown in Figure 16. First, leg straps 40 are undone. The user then lifts up on the wooden exercise bar 16 to unfold the unit 10. After unfolding the unit 10, the backboard 22 is locked into a vertical position by attaching it to the lower cross bar 18 via the hinges 46 and ensuring that the spring loaded handle 38 locks in place over the hinge 46. The floor board 24 should lay flat against the floor. The telescoping legs 12 can be fully extended for greater stability. The exercise bar 16 can be adjusted to the desired height by retracting the spring loaded knobs 36 mounted at each end of the upper cross bar 20 adjacent the support arms 14 and then pulling up on the bar 16. Before using the device 10 the user should make sure the spring loaded knobs 36 are locked into position.<br>
To use the exercise device 10, the user may stand, kneel, sit or otherwise rest on the floor board 24 and stretch or perform exercises using the exercise bar 16. Because the floor board 24 is attached to the backboard 22 and indirectly to the exercise bar 16, the user's weight and any downward force applied to the floor board 24 maintains the device 10 in position during use, even when lifting up on the exercise bar 16.<br>
The unit 10 can be folded into a relatively flat, compact shape for convenient shipping and storage. To fold the unit 10, the legs 12 are first collapsed telescopically. Next, the floor board 22 and backboard 24 are unsnapped from the lower cross bar 18 after retracting the spring loaded cammed handle 38. With the boards 22, 24 disconnected from the first lower cross bar 18, the boards 22, 24 can be swung rearward by pivoting the boards 22, 24 around the upper cross bar 20 until the backboard 22 is approximately are aligned with the support arms 14 as shown in Figure 12. Next, as shown in Figures 12 and 13, the user can grab the exercise bar 16 and lower the support arms 14 until they are aligned with the legs 12.<br><br>
Figure 14 is a perspective view of the free standing ballet bar exercise device 10 after the arms 14 have been lowered. In this position, the user may secure the arms and legs together with the leg straps 40. Figure 15 is a close up view of the right side leg 12 and support arm 14 shown strapped together. The inner leg members 26 may be collapsed inside the outer leg members 28.<br>
As shown in Figure 16, a nylon retaining strap 42 is permanently attached to the second lower cross bar 19 and the upper cross bar 20. This strap holds the boards 22, 24 in place when the unit is being transported.<br>
The folded unit 10 shown in Figures 16-18 has a depth of only about six inches and is light enough to be easily carried by one person. Optional wheels 44 attached to the ends of the legs 12 where the legs 12 are connected to the second lower cross bar 19 allow the unit 10 to be rolled from place to place. The folded unit 10 can be stored in a small area, such as in a closet or under a bed.<br>
Preferably, the exercise bar 16 is made of wood, the boards 22, 24 are made of plywood, and the legs 12 and arms 14 are made of metal or plastic. The mats 25 that cover the boards 22, 24 may be made of any suitable cushioned material.<br>
Other modifications and alternative embodiments of the invention are contemplated which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the foregoing teachings and appended claims. It is intended that the claims cover all such modifications that fall within their scope.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
