ENGINE OIL CHANGE DETECTION SYSTEMS AND METHODS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to engine control systems and<br>
methods.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Motor oil is a type of liquid oil used for lubrication by various<br>
types of motors. In particular, internal combustion engines use motor oil to<br>
provide lubrication between mechanical components. The motor oil also serves<br>
as a cooling system to the engine. The motor oil dissipates heat generated by<br>
friction between the mechanical components.<br>
[0004] Motor oil eventually becomes saturated with particulates. The<br>
motor oil should be changed at regular intervals to prevent damage to the<br>
engine. Most car manufacturers specify the appropriate interval to change the<br>
oil. Some drivers neglect to change their engine oil on regular intervals, if at all.<br>
Therefore, it is beneficial for car manufactures and purchasers to know if and<br>
when the oil has been changed.<br>
[0005] Current methods of detecting an oil change require user<br>
interaction. For example, the engine control system may monitor a pedal<br>
position while the engine is off to detect an oil change event.    For example,<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
three consecutive pedal pumps by the driver indicates to the engine contro!<br>
system that the engine oil has been changed. Once the ignition is turned on, the<br>
engine control system turns off the change engine oil light. Some drivers reset<br>
the change engine oil light without physically changing the oil. Therefore, the<br>
system may not be reliable.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, an engine oil change detection control system is<br>
provided. The system includes an armature position module that monitors a<br>
solenoid armature position based on a position signal. A solenoid control module<br>
selectively generates a solenoid control signal and estimates a delay time based<br>
on the solenoid control signal and the armature position. An engine oil change<br>
detection module detects an engine oil change event based on the delay time.<br>
[0007] In other features, an engine oil change detection system for an<br>
engine is provided. The system includes a solenoid disposed within an engine oil<br>
sump wherein the solenoid includes an armature. A passage routes to the<br>
armature including an orifice to allow fluids to flow through the passage. A<br>
control module energizes and de-energizes the solenoid, monitors a position of<br>
the armature based on the energizing and the de-energizing of the solenoid,<br>
estimates a delay time based on the position, and detects an engine oil change<br>
event based on the delay time.<br>
[0008] In still other features, an oil change detection system for an<br>
engine is provided.    The system includes an engine oil sump.    A switch is<br>
2<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
disposed within the engine oil sump. A removable drain plug including a<br>
magnetized material is disposed within the engine oil sump. A capacitor<br>
electrically connects with the switch. The switch discharges the capacitor based<br>
on a position of the removable drain plug including the magnetized material. A<br>
control module detects an engine oil change event based on a voltage of the<br>
capacitor.<br>

Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
[0021] Referring now to Figure 1, an engine system 10 includes an<br>
engine 12 that combusts an air and fue! mixture to produce drive torque. Air is<br>
drawn into an intake manifold 14 through a throttle 16. The throttle 16 regulates<br>
mass air flow into the intake manifold 14. Air within the intake manifold 14 is<br>
distributed into cylinders 18. Although four cylinders 18 are illustrated, it can be<br>
appreciated that the engine 12 can have a plurality of cylinders including, but not<br>
limited to, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders. Although the cylinders 18 are<br>
shown to be in an inline configuration, it can be appreciated that the cylinders 18<br>
can alternatively be in a V-shaped configuration.<br>
[0022] A fuel injector 20 injects fuel that is combined with the air as it is<br>
drawn into the cylinder 18 through an intake port. An intake valve 22 selectively<br>
opens and closes to enable the air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder 18. The<br>
intake valve position is regulated by an intake camshaft 24. A piston (not shown)<br>
compresses the air/fuel mixture within the cylinder 18. A spark plug 26 initiates<br>
combustion of the air/fuel mixture, driving the piston in the cylinder 18. The<br>
piston drives a crankshaft (not shown) to produce drive torque. Combustion<br>
exhaust within the cylinder 18 is forced out through an exhaust manifold 28 when<br>
an exhaust valve 30 is in an open position. The exhaust valve position is<br>
regulated by an exhaust camshaft 32. The exhaust is treated in an exhaust<br>
system.<br>
[0023] An engine oil sump 36 couples to the engine 12 and serves as a<br>
reservoir for engine oil. An engine oil pump (not shown) circulates oil through<br>
passages of the engine 12 to provide lubrication as well as to cool the engine 12.<br>

Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
A solenoid 38 is disposed within the engine oil sump 36. Alternatively, a<br>
magnetic switch 72 shown in Figure 5a is disposed within the engine oil sump 36.<br>
A control module 40 controls the solenoid 38 or reads the switch 72 (Figure 5a)<br>
and detects a change of engine oil. The control module 40 detects the change<br>
based on a response time of the solenoid 38 or a state of the switch 72 (Figure<br>
5a) and one or more sensory inputs.<br>
[0024] More particularly, an oil temperature sensor 42, or equivalent<br>
algorithm, generates an oil temperature signal based on a temperature of oil<br>
within the engine 12. An engine speed sensor 44 generates an engine run signal<br>
based on an operational state of the engine 12. A voltage sensor 46 senses a<br>
voltage of the engine system 10 provided by a power source 48. A solenoid<br>
current sensor 50 senses the current of the solenoid and generates a solenoid<br>
current signal. Alternatively, a hall effect sensor senses a changing magnetic<br>
flux of the solenoid 38 or a position sensor senses a position of an armature 54<br>
(Figure 2) of the solenoid 38 as will be disccussed in further detail below. The<br>
control module 40 receives the above mentioned signals and detects an engine<br>
oil change as will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0025] Referring to Figure 2, a cross-sectional view of an exemplary<br>
solenoid 38 having a fluid sensitive damper is shown. The solenoid 38 generally<br>
includes an electromagnetic coil (not shown) and an armature 54 that is disposed<br>
coaxially within the coil. The armature 54 is biased to a first position relative to<br>
the coil by a biasing force. The biasing force can be imparted by a biasing<br>
member, such as a spring (not shown).    The solenoid 38 is energized by<br>
6<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
supplying current to the coil, which induces magnetic force along the coil axis.<br>
The magnetic force induces linear movement of the armature 54 to a second<br>
position. The solenoid 38 is disposed within proximity of a removable drain plug<br>
58. A passage 60 is routed to the face of the armature 54. Oil flows through the<br>
passage 60 to provide a resistance that lengthens the response time of the<br>
armature 54. When removed, the drain plug 58 allows engine oil to flow out of<br>
the engine oil sump 36 and passage 60. The sensor 50 (Figure 1) senses the<br>
movement of the armature 54 based on one of a magnetic flux, solenoid current,<br>
and armature position. For ease of the discussion, the remainder of the<br>
disclosure will be discussed in the context of the solenoid current. As can be<br>
appreciated, the remainder of the disclosure is equally applicable to other<br>
methods of sensing the armature movement.<br>
[0026] By altering the presence of oil in the passage 60, the solenoid<br>
38 is able to react in a respective fashion. The solenoid current signal defines<br>
the fluid characteristics in the passage 60. In various embodiments, the passage<br>
60 includes a conduit that is turned vertically with an orifice 62 included at the<br>
end opposite of the armature 54. Near the face of the solenoid 38 is a vent port<br>
63 that is normally closed off when the solenoid 38 is in the off position. A<br>
second vent port 64 is sealed off by the drain plug 58 when inserted. Removal of<br>
the drain plug 58 drains oil from the fluid passage 60. Air then fills the passage<br>
60. After the oil has been completely drained, the engine oil sump 36 is filled<br>
with new oil. In doing so, an air bubble is trapped in the fluid passage 60. With<br>
the solenoid armature 54 now exposed to air, the solenoid current signal is<br>
7<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
measurably different due to the minimal flow-resistance of the air. Repeated<br>
cycling of the valve will allow the air to be purged, filling the passage with oil, thus<br>
again changing the response of the solenoid. From the change in response time,<br>
a change in engine oil can be inferred.<br>
[0027] Figure 3 is a cross-sectional view of various other embodiments<br>
of the fluid passage whereby two spring loaded check valves 66, 68 are installed<br>
at the face of the solenoid 38. The arrangement of the valves 66,68 is such that<br>
by cycling the solenoid 38, the armature 54 serves as a positive displacement<br>
pump that physically pushes the trapped air bubble out of the fluid passage 60.<br>
Otherwise, the engine oil detection system behaves as previously described.<br>
Utilizing the valves may provide for a quicker response. It can be appreciated<br>
that reed valves can similarly be implemented in place of the check valves.<br>
[0028] Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of various embodiments of an<br>
engine oil detection system whereby two buoyant check balls 69, 71 are<br>
disposed within the passage 60. The location of the passage 60 is such that the<br>
drainage of the passage 60 does not rely on the position of the drain plug 58. As<br>
shown, two buoyant check balls 69, 71 act to seal and unseal the passage based<br>
on the flow of fluids.<br>
[0029] Referring now to Figures 5a and 5b, a cross-sectional view of a<br>
switch 72 disposed within the engine oil sump 36 is shown. As can be<br>
appreciated, a magnetic switch 72 can be disposed within the engine oil sump 36<br>
in place of the solenoid 38 of Figures 2 and 3. The drain plug 58 includes a<br>
magnet 70 located a distance "D" from the switch 72 so as to not trigger the<br>
8<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-0G0465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
switch 72 when in place. A change in engine oil is detected based on a change<br>
in voltage of a capacitor 74 shown in Figure 5b. Figure 5b is a schematic<br>
illustrating an engine oil detection system including a switch 72 in more detail. A<br>
supply voltage will stay active for many minutes after the engine 12 is shut off.<br>
Immediately after shutting the engine 12 down, a second controlled switch 73 is<br>
commanded closed for a specified amount of time (e.g. 1 second) thus, charging<br>
the capacitor 74. The controlled switch 73 is then commanded open.<br>
[0030] If removed, the magnet 70 in the drain plug 58 will cause the<br>
first switch 72 disposed within the engine oil sump 36 to close thus, discharging<br>
the capacitor 74 to the grounded engine oil sump 36. The capacitor 74 will be<br>
discharged to zero Volts. Immediately after the engine starts up, the voltage on<br>
the capacitor 74 is read. If it is near 0.0 Volts, the drain plug 58 was removed<br>
and it is inferred that the engine oil was changed.<br>
[0031] Referring now to Figure 6 and with continued reference to<br>
Figures 2, 3, an 4, a graphical representation of exemplary current flowing<br>
through the solenoid 38 is shown. The top graph 80 corresponds to actual<br>
current signals flowing through the solenoid 38. The bottom graph 82<br>
corresponds to digital current readings. In the top graph, a solenoid current<br>
signal generated after no oil drainage is shown at 88. A solenoid current signal<br>
generated after oil drainage is shown at 90. In both graphs 80 and: 82, a trigger<br>
signal 84 indicating the start of energizing the solenoid 38 occurs at<br>
approximately 50 ms and "valleys" shown generally at 86,87 exists at<br>
approximately 60 ms. The "valleys" 86,87 in the current readings corresponds to<br>
9<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-3G8937-PTE-CD<br>
the armature 54 of the solenoid 38 hitting a mechanical stop. The time delay is<br>
the difference in time between the trigger signal 84 and the "valleys" 86,87 of the<br>
current readings<br>
[0032] In the bottom graph 82, state 0 describes the state of the<br>
solenoid 38 before the trigger signal 84 is commanded, state 1 describes the<br>
state of increasing solenoid current, state 2 describes decreasing solenoid<br>
current, and state 3 describes increasing solenoid current after the armature 54<br>
of the solenoid 38 has hit the mechanical stop. The time delay is the time<br>
elapsed between the state 0 to state 1 transition and the state 2 to state 3<br>
transition.<br>
[0033] The time of the state 0 to state 1 transition is the time that the<br>
trigger signal 84 is activated. However, the time for the remaining transitions is<br>
calculated by inspection of the current signal. In state 1, the current signal<br>
increases and has a positive slope. In state 2, the current signal decreases and<br>
has a negative slope. The state 1 to state 2 transition is when the current slope<br>
changes from positive to negative. Since state 3 has an increasing slope, the<br>
state 2 to state 3 transition is determined by the time at which the current slope<br>
changes from negative to positive.<br>
[0034] As is commonly known, the derivative of a function represents<br>
the slope of the function. In a discrete domain, an adequate approximation of the<br>
derivative of the solenoid current signal can be calculated in order to determine<br>
the slope. Several numerical methods may be employed to achieve this<br>
objective.  The simplest is a two-point backward difference approximation of the<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
derivative.  The two-point backward difference approximation uses the following<br>
equation:<br><br>
where y' is the approximate derivative of the current signal, yn is the present<br>
sample of the current signal, yn-1 is the previous sample of the current signal,<br>
and h is the time between samples of the current signal.<br>
[0035]      The   two-point   backward   difference   approximation   of   the<br>
derivative may be sensitive to signal noise.    Approximations with a smaller<br>
degree of error can be calculated, but they generally use additional samples to<br>
achieve accuracy or use non-realtime processing.  Therefore, it is preferable to<br>
calculate the derivative of a moving average of the current signal rather than the<br>
current signal directly.   Although the moving average of the samples will help<br>
smooth out noise, it is still possible for slight increases and decreases in the<br>
derivative of the slope to prematurely indicate that the current signal has<br>
changed direction.   Thus, it is preferable for a change in slope to persist for<br>
several consecutive samples before it is reported.    If the state 2 to state 3<br>
transition is not detected within a predetermined period, a maximum time (e.g.,<br>
50 ms) is reported as the response time of the solenoid 38.<br>
[0036] Referring now to Figure 7, a dataflow diagram illustrates various<br>
embodiments of an engine oil change detection control system that may be<br>
embedded within the control module 40. Various embodiments of engine oil<br>
change detection control systems according to the present disclosure may<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
include any number of sub-modules embedded within the control module 40.<br>
The sub-modules shown may be combined and/or further partitioned to similarly<br>
detect a change in engine oil. Inputs to the engine oil change detection control<br>
system may be sensed from the engine system 10 (Figure 1), received from<br>
other control modules (not shown), and/or determined by other sub-modules (not<br>
shown) within the control module 40. In various embodiments, the control<br>
module 40 of Figure 7 includes an enable module 100, a solenoid control module<br>
102, an engine oil change detection module 104, and a position monitor module<br>
105.<br>
[0037] The enable module 100 selectively enables the solenoid control<br>
module 102 to control the solenoid 38 (Figure 1) based on enable parameters.<br>
Such enable parameters include, but are not limited to, engine oil temperature<br>
106 and system voltage 108. For example, if the engine oil temperature 106 is<br>
within a predetermined oil temperature range and the system voltage 108 is<br>
within a predetermined voltage range, an enable flag 110 is set to TRUE.<br>
Otherwise, the enable flag 110 remains FALSE. The position monitor module<br>
105 monitors a position signal 116 to determine an armature position 117. In<br>
various embodiments, the position signal 116 indicates solenoid current and the<br>
position 117 is determined as discussed above.<br>
[0038] The solenoid control module 102 selectively commands a<br>
solenoid control signal 112 to energize and de-energize the solenoid 38 (Figure<br>
1) based on the enable flag 110 and an engine run status 114. For example,<br>
immediately after the engine run status 114 indicates that the engine 12 (Figure<br>
12<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
1) has shutdown, the solenoid control module 102 commands the solenoid 38<br>
(Figure 1) energized via the solenoid control signal 112. After commanding the<br>
solenoid 38 to be energized, the solenoid control module 102 measures a first<br>
time delay 118 based on the position 117 to verify proper operation of the<br>
solenoid 38 (Figure 1). The solenoid 38 is then commanded to be de-energized.<br>
Once the engine run status 114 indicates the engine is running again, the<br>
solenoid control module 102 again commands the solenoid 38 (Figure 1) to be<br>
energized. The solenoid control module 102 measures a second time delay 120<br>
based on the position 117. The solenoid 38 is then commanded to be de-<br>
energized.<br>
[0039] If the drain plug 58 (Figure 2) was removed and the oil drained<br>
out of the engine oil sump 36 (Figure 2), the second time delay 120 will be a<br>
small value compared to the case where the drain plug 58 (Figure 2) was not<br>
removed. If the second time delay 120 is a small value, there is an air bubble in<br>
the passage 60 (Figure 2). The solenoid control module 102 purges the air out of<br>
the passages 60 (Figure 2) by cycling the solenoid control signal 112. After<br>
cycling the solenoid control signal 112 a predetermined number of times, the<br>
solenoid control module 102 commands the solenoid 38 (Figure 1) energized and<br>
measures a third time delay 122 based on the position 117. A large value for the<br>
third time delay 122 indicates that the engine oil sump 36 (Figure 2) was refilled<br>
with oil and therefore an oil change has occurred.<br>
[0040]     The engine oil change detection module 104 detects an oil<br>
change and sets oil change indicator flags based on the first time delay 118, the<br>
13<br><br>

GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
second time delay 120, and the third time delay 122. If the first time delay 118 is<br>
normal (within a predetermined range), the engine oil change detection module<br>
104 evaluates the second time delay 120. If the second time delay 120 is less<br>
than a predetermined time, then an oil drain flag 124 is set to TRUE. Otherwise,<br>
the oil drain flag 124 is set to FALSE. If the second time delay 120 is less than a<br>
predetermined time and the third time delay 122 is less than a predetermined<br>
threshold, an oil change flag 126 is set to FALSE. Otherwise, the oil change flag<br>
126 is set to TRUE.<br>
[0041] Referring now to Figure 8, a flowchart illustrates various<br>
embodiments of an engine oil change detection method that may be performed<br>
by the control module 40. The method may be run periodically. At 200, the<br>
engine run status is evaluated. If the engine run status indicates that the engine<br>
has shutdown within a predetermined time period "A" at 200, the enable<br>
conditions are evaluated at 202. Otherwise, continues to evaluate the engine run<br>
status at 200. If the engine oil temperature is within a predetermined oil<br>
temperature range and the system voltage is within a predetermined voltage<br>
range at 202, a first time delay is measured at 204 to 210. Otherwise, control<br>
loops back to evaluate the engine run status at 200.<br>
[0042] At 204, the solenoid is energized. A predetermined time period<br>
"B" elapses at 206 before processing the first time delay at 208. Once the first<br>
time delay is processed at 208, the solenoid is de-energized at 210. If the first<br>
time delay is within a time delay range, indicating a normal response at 212,<br>
control proceeds to wait until the engine run status indicates the engine is<br>
14<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. 8540P-000465<br>
GM. Ref. No. GP-308937-PTE-CD<br>
running at 214. Otherwise, control loops back and continues to evaluate the<br>
engine run status for the next shutdown event at 200. If the engine run status<br>
indicates the engine is running at 214, a delay occurs at 215 and enable<br>
conditions are evaluated at 216. If the engine oil temperature is within a<br>
predetermined oil temperature range and the system voltage is within a<br>
predetermined voltage range at 218, a second solenoid time delay is measured<br>
at 218 to 224. Otherwise, control loops back to evaluate the engine run status at<br>
200. Alternatively (flow not shown), instead of providing a delay at 215, the<br>
enable conditions are continually monitored while the engine is running at 216. If<br>
the engine shuts down, control proceeds to evaluate engine run status at 200.<br>
[0043] At 218, the solenoid is energized. A predetermined time period<br>
elapses at 220 before processing the second time delay at 222. Once the<br>
second time delay is processed at 222, the solenoid is de-energized at 224. If<br>
the second time delay is less than a predetermined time threshold, the oil drain<br>
flag is set to TRUE at 228. Otherwise, the oil drain flag is set to FALSE at 227<br>
and the oil change flag is set to FALSE at 229. Once the oil drain flag is set to<br>
TRUE at 228, the solenoid is cycled a predetermined number of times C by<br>
energizing and de-energizing the solenoid. Once the solenoid has been cycled C<br>
times, a third time delay is measured at 232 to 238. If the third time delay is less<br>
than a predetermined time threshold, the oil change flag is set to FALSE.<br>
Otherwise, the oil change flag is set to TRUE. Thereafter, control proceeds to<br>
the end.<br>
