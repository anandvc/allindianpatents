This invention relates to a steam pressure regulating device for a pressure cooker.<br>
An objective of the device proposed herein is to close ah aperture in the lid of the pressure cooker, to enable normal steam pressure build-up at the start of the cooking operation. In the event of subsequent excessive build-up of steam pressure within the pressure cooker, the known dead weight pressure release valve opens to let out steam| however, if this valve malfunctions, the said device operates to let out steam<br>
and thus relieve the cooker of excessive pressure.<br>
.» On  the  other  hand, should  a  negative  pressure  be<br>
created within the cooker, the said device permits  air<br>
from  atmosphere to enter the cooker and thus  equalize<br>
the pressure.<br>
Thus, the said device regulates the pressure within  the cooker in conditions of excessive positive or  negative pressure.<br>
The   device   proposed  herein  is  simple   in   its<br><br>
construction yet quick and efficient in operation.<br>
Various  other  advantages of this  invention  wil 1  be apparent from th£ following description.<br>
The steam pressure regulating device, according to thin invention, comprise® a valve housing made of ft  flexible material for insertion into, and engagement with   the rim of,  an  aperture in the lid  of  the  cooker,  the housing  having  a passage with a mouth it the first end thereof  and An opening at its second ehd)   at least  one lateral  hole running through the wall of the  passage, connecting  the  passage to atmosphere)  &amp;  valve  stem having  a plug at its first end and a collar  at  its second end, the circumference of the plug and that of the collar being larger than that of thfc mouth end that  of the  opening,   but smaller than that of  the  passage, such that the collar is forcibly insertable through the mouth  and passage, and thence through the opening,  to emerge thereat, the stem being thus located within the passage,  leaving  the  plug  and  collar  outside  the passage*<br><br>
This invention will now be described with reference  to the  accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example*  and not by way of limitation, on* of  various possible embodiments of the device proposed herein,<br>
Fig. 1 illustrating a view of the embodiment alone with the plug of the valve stem closing the mouth of the passage<br>
Fig. 2 illustrating a view of the embodiment alone with the plug of the valve stem opening the mouth of the passage<br>
Fig. 3  illustrating a sectional view of the  vi*w  in Fig.l<br>
Fig. 4 illustrating a sectional view of the view in Fig. 2.<br>
Fig.  S  illustrating a sectional view of  the  housing engaged  with  the aperture in the lid  of  the  pressure cooker,  a circumferential groove on the periphery of the housing engaging with the rim of the aperture, with the plug closing the mouth of the passage<br><br>
Fig.  6  illustrating a sectional viiw of  the  housing engaged  with  the aperture in the lid  of  tht  pressure cooker,  a circumferential groove on the  periphery of the housing engaging with the rim of the aperture, with the plug opening the mouth of the passage<br>
Fig. 7 illustrating a separate sectional view of the housing and passage (without the stem)<br>
and<br>
Fig.  8  illustrating a separate view of the ' stem.<br>
The valve housing H is made of flexible material such as si 1 icon rubber, which does not harden during use, that is » to say, which exhibits the same or substantially the same properties even after constant use.<br>
The  housing  H  is intended for  insertion  into,  and engagement with, the aperture A in the lid L of th# pressure cooker.   The insertion is made from beneath the the  lid  L of the pressure cooker. The housing  has  a peripheral  groove S which engages with the rim  R  of<br><br>
the aperture A.<br>
The housing H hate a passage P with i mouth H at its first end and an opening 0 At its second end With one or more lateral holes B running through the Wil1 W of the passage, connecting the passage to atmosphere. The holes are, preferably, disposed at a downward angle * such that escape of steam thereat is directed downwardly, thus avoiding any possibility of scalding the user.<br>
A valve stem V, has a plug T at its first end J and a collar C at its second end F, the circumference of  the<br>
plug  and that of the collar being larger than that  of<br>
.»<br>
the mouth M and that of the opening 0, but smal ler than that of the passage P. The collar is forcibly thrust through the mouth and passage, and thence through the opening, to emerge thereat. The stem is thus located within the passage, leaving the plug and collar outside the passage at either end thereof.<br>
Although the circumference of the collar C is larger than that of the mouth M and that of the opening 0, the collar  can  still  be made to enter  the  mouth  M  by<br><br>
forcibly thrusting the former into the 1&amp;tter9 the entry being rendered possible by reason of the flexibility of the material of which the housing is made. Similarly, the collar can also be further thrust through the opening 0 to emerge at the said opening, that  is  to say, to come out  of  the  passage.<br>
Such location of the stem in the passage serves to achieve free and guided movement of the stem.<br>
With the lid L of the pressure cooker closed and the cooker in operation, the normal build-up of steam in the cooker causes the plug T (which is outside the passage P and exposed to the interior of the cooker) to push the plug against the mouth M to close the said mouth. Consequently, no steam can enter the passage P and the pressure build-up of steam within the cooker continues to take place in the normal way.<br>
In the event of excessive build-up of pressure, whin the known dead weight pressure release valve fails to operate, such pressure pushes the plug T forcibly through  the mouth M into the passige P,  although  the<br><br>
circumference of the plug is larger thmn that Of trie mouth. This is rendered possible by reason of the flexibility of the material of which the housing is made. Once the plug enters the passage P, the gap between the plug and the wall W of the passage causes steam, from the cooker, to enter the passage and escape through the holes B to atmosphere, thus relieving the cooker of excessive pressure. The plug T has a tapered periphery at fc to facilitate the creation of the gap between the plug and the wall of the passage, immediately the plug enters the passage. Once  the excessive pressure has been released and  the<br>
pressure drops to Ambient in the cooker the plug can be<br>
&gt;<br>
pushed back to its original position and re-set for further use.<br>
On the other hand, if there is negative pressure created within the cooker such as by rapid cooling, th# ambient air, which has direct access to the passage P through the holes B, pushis the plug T (which in it* normal position closes the mouth li) away from the mouth Mf to open it, and thus enter the cooker* to equalize the pressure therein, thus preventing an implosion.<br><br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description, as such term© and expressions do not exclude any equivalents of the features i1lustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the device proposed herein Are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention-<br><br><br><br>
