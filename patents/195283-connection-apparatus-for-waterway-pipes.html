				<td>BACKGROUND  OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a connection apparatus for waterway pipes, and in particular to a connection apparatus which is capable of fabricating a lengthypipe by connectinga plurality of pipes each having, a certain length.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Generally, a waterway is used for continuously providing water from a water body like river, lake, a water reservoir, etc. to a crop area like rice field.<br>
The waterway is formed by digging certain area using a channel shaped<br>
concrete structure.	<br>
Therefore, it likes a long time for forming_the waterway, and the cost for forming the waterway is increased. In addition, the waterway is formed on the ground adversely affecting the nature and the environment.<br>
Attempts were made to overcome the problems narrated above by providing a plurality of metal pipes for forming a waterway. Such metal pipes of certain length are connected by coupler which surrounds each end of the pipes and then both ends of the coupler are connected using a bolt and a nut.<br>
While connecting both ends of the coupler, one of the bolts and the nut are fixed, and the other end of the bolt and nut is rotated. It has been found to be difficult to maintain a fixed, steady state, and additional manpower is needed for maintaining a fixed state of the pipes.<br>
-2 -<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a connection apparatus for a waterway pipe which overcomes the problems encountered during a conventional coupler connection work.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a connection apparatus for a waterway pipe which is capable of automatically fixing one of a bolt and a nut which are used for connecting the both ends of a coupler, so that it is possible to easily rotate the other one of the bolt and the nut. Therefore, a person is not additionally used for fixing one of the bolt and the nut.<br>
In order to achieve the above objects, there is provided a connection apparatus for waterway pipes comprising :<br>
a coupler extending around longitudinally opposed ends of the pipes, the coupler having opposed connection members at opposite ends thereof;<br>
at least one pair of connection holes in the connection members , at least one of said connection holes being polygonal ;<br><br>
an engaging member projecting through the pair of connection holes, <br><br>
a coupling member threadably engaging an end portion of the engaging member extending into the polygonal recess of one of the connecting holes, said coupling member having an outer polygonal surface engaged in and corresponding in shape to one of the polygonal holes so that when the engaging member is rotated, the coupling member is blocked in rotations, the said coupling member having a pair of generally parallel grooves on opposite sides thereof, and a U-shaped fixing member having opposite legs engaged in the grooves for retaining said coupling member with the connection member with the polygonal shaped hole.<br>
The connection groove formed at the connection member is polygonal.<br>
The engaging member includes a support member contacting with one side of the connection member, an engaging hole formed at a center portion of the support member and threadedly engaged with the support member, and a rotation prevention member integrally formed with one side of the support member and<br>
-3-<br><br>
having an outer surface corresponding to an inner surface of a polygonal connection<br>
groove.<br>
The rotation prevention member includes a vertical cut-away groove formed at both sides of the center portion of the same, and a fixing member inserted into the cut-away groove.<br>
Additional advantages, objects and features of the invention will become more apparent from the description which follows.<br>
ACCOMPANYING BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE/DRAWINGS<br>

Figure 4 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a state for connecting a waterway pipe and connection portions of the same using s coupler according to a second embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 5 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a connection state of a first embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
-4-<br><br>
Figure 6 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a connection state of a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 depict a state of prior art in which 100 shows a metal pipe, 200 is a coupler connecting the pipes surrounding each end of the pipes 100. The coupler 200 surrounds each end of the pipes 100 and both ends of the coupler 200 are connected using a bolt 300 and a nut 400.<br>
To connect both ends of the coupler 200, one of the bolt 300 and the nut 400 is fixed, and the other bolt 300 and the nut 400 are rotated.<br>
As shown in Figures 3 and 5, a connection apparatus for waterway pipe includes a coupler 20 which surrounds the connection portions of a pipe 10 which is connected.<br>
The coupler 20 includes a connection member 21 having both ends protruded, and a plurality of connection grooves 22 are formed at a portion of the connection member 21. The construction of the coupler 20 is similar to the construction of the conventional coupler 200.<br>
An engaging member 30 (or bolt) passes through the connection grooves 22 formed at the coupler 20. The engaging  member 30 is fixed by a coupling member 40 (or nut).<br>
One end of the coupling member 40 is inserted by the connection grooves 22, and the other end of the same contacts with one side of the connection member 21, so that the coupling member 40 moves forward and backwardly by the rotation force when rotating the engaging member 30. Therefore, the coupler 20 is tightened and loosened thereby.<br>
As shown in Figures 3 and 5, the connection grooves 22 of one side formed at the connection member 21 is polygonally formed. The coupling member 40 includes a support member 41 supported by one side of the connection member 21, an engaging hole 42 formed at the center portion of the support member 41 and<br>
-5-<br><br>
threadely engaged with the engaging member 30, and a rotation prevention member 43 having an outer surface corresponding to an inner surface of the connection groove 22 and preventing a rotation by its polygonal structure.<br>
As shown in Figures 4 and 6, the rotation prevention member 43 includes a vertical cut-away groove 44 at both sides of the center portion, and the fixing member 45 is inserted into the cut-away groove 44.<br>
The operation of the present invention will be explained.<br>
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, each pipe 10 is arranged in series, and then the coupler 20 surrounds the connection portions of the pipe.<br>
When the installation preparation of the coupler 20 is completed, the engaging member 30 passes through the connection groove 22 formed at one side of the connection member, and the engaging member 30 is protruded from the outer side of the polygonal connection groove 22 formed at the connection member 21.<br>
When the installation of the engaging member 30 is completed, the coupling member 40 which has the same function as the nut is installed to correspond with the engaging member 30 protruded to the other side of the connection member 21.<br>
Namely, when the coupling member 40 is installed to correspond with the engaging member 30, the support member 41 formed at one end of the coupling member 40 contacts with the outer surface of the connection member 21, and the rotation prevention member 43 provided at one side is inserted into the polygonal .connection groove 22 formed at the connection member 21 of the other side.<br>
When the installation preparation of the connection apparatus for a waterway pipe according to the present invention is completed, as shown in Figures 5 and 6, one end of the engaging member 30 is rotated using a spanner, and the rotation prevention member 43 of the coupling member 40 inserted in the polygonal<br>
6<br><br>
connection groove 22 moves backwardly and forward by based on the prevented rotation.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to easily install the coupler 20 for the connection of the pipes 10.<br>
 In the conventional art, since the waterway pipes are continuously connected using the coupler in a state that one of the bolt and the nut is fixed, and then the coupler is installed. The work process is complicated, and the work time is extended, and more workers are used. However, in the present invention, one of the bolt and the nut which is an engaging member is automatically fixed when engaging the both ends of the coupler, so thaVthe other one of the bolt and the nut is easily rotated, and the workers for fixing the engaging member are not needed.<br>
