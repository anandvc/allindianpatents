Electric lamp<br>
The Invention relates to an electric lamp in=ascendance-The lamp has a metal holding in which the is fixed.<br>
I. Prior art Such an electric lamp is described, for example, in Patent Application PCT/DE96/01982. This patent application describes a cementlessly capped electric lamp for use in a motor vehicle headlight. This lamp has a lamp cap constructed from metal parts and plastic parts. The lamp cap has a metal holding part in which the lamp bulb is fixed, a metal support sleeve supporting the holding part, and a plastic cap part, which is provided with the electric terminals of the lamp and in which the support sleeve is anchored. The metal support sleeve of the lamp is constructed in the shape of a ring and matched to the fitting diameter of the opening, constructed as a lamp-holder, of the headlight reflector, and equipped with at least one pressure spring which, after the lamp has been installed in the reflector, bears against the reflector wall in the region of the lamp holder. This at least one pressure spring ensures the lamp is firmly seated in the lampholder of the reflector, and balances slight tolerances in the manufacture of the lamp cap and in the opening, constructed as lampholder, of the headlight reflector. The at least one pressure spring is designed as a caunbered leaf spring whose ends bear against the inner wall of the metal, ring-shaped support sleeve. Moreover, the at least one leaf spring has an outwardly cambered section which reaches through a cutout in the support sleeve and, after the lamp has been installed in the reflector, bears against the reflector wall in the region of the lampholder, as well as two inwardly cambered sections, which are arranged on both sides of the outwardly cambered section of the leaf spring.<br><br>
-2-<br>
II. Representation of the invention<br>
It   is   the  object  of  the  invention  to  provide   an electric lamp with a metal holding part in which the bulb of the lamp is fixed, which has an improved pressure spring.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention toy means of the outwardly cambered section of the leaf spring having a region constructed in the shape of a V, and the connecting piece which connects the twos V limbs of the V—shaped region reaching through the cutout in the support sleeve. Particularly advantageous embodiments of the invention are also described hereunder.<br>
In the electric lamp according to the invention, the lamp cap is fitted with at least one pressure spring which, after the lamp has been installed in the headlight reflector, bears against the reflector wall in the region of the lampholder and ensures that the lamp is seated firmly in the lampholder of the reflector. The pressure spring is constructed as a cambered leaf spring. It has an outwardly caebered section, which reaches through a cutout in the support sleeve and, after the lamp has been installed in the headlight reflector, bears against the reflector wall, and which is provided according to the invention with a V-shaped region. At least the connecting piece connecting the two V limbs reaches through the cutout in the support sleeve, with the result that, after the lamp has been installed in the<br><br>
-2A-<br>
headlight  reflector, it bears resiliently against the  reflector<br>
wall  constructed  as the lampholder. The spring  action  of  the<br>
pressure  spring  is improved by comparison with  the  prior  art<br>
quoted above by means of the V—shaped region. The V-shaped region<br>
of the outwardly cambered section reduces the contact area between<br>
the  lamphoider  and the pressure spring by comparison  with  the<br>
prior  art, and increases the contact pressure. In this case,  the<br>
angle which the two V limbs of the V—shaped region form with one<br>
another  is  advantageously selected such that it is  between  80<br>
degrees and 110 degrees.   In order to avoid scratch traces on the<br>
lamphoider  when  assentling  the  lamp  in  the  headlight,  the<br>
connecting  piece  connecting the two V limbs  is  advantageously<br>
rounded- The two inwardly	<br><br>
-3-<br>
cambered sections of the leaf spring are advantageously constructed in the shape of a U. As a result, by comparison with the prior art the pressure acting on the leaf spring after the lamp has been mounted can be better absorbed by a reversible deformation of the inwardly cambered sections, that is to say by a reversible compression of the U-shaped sections of the leaf spring.<br>
III. Description of the preferred exemplary embodiment The invention is explained in more detail below with the aid of a preferred exemplary embodiment. In the accompanying drawing: Figure 1  shows a diagrammatic side view of an electric<br>
lamp according to the invention. Figure 2 shows a top view of the plastic cap part and the metal support sleeve, injected therein, of the electric lamp illustrated in Figure 1, and Figure 3 shows a side view of the pressure spring according to the invention.<br>
In the preferred exemplary embodiment of the electric lamp according to the invention, it is a single-filament halogen lamp which is provided for use in a motor vehicle headlight. This lamp has an essentially cylindrical glass lamp bulb 50 with a tightly pinched end 50a which is termed the pinched foot 50a. The dome 50b of the lamp bulb 50 is provided with a black, light-absorbing coating. The light source is an incandescent filament 50c, which is aligned parallel to the lamp bulb axis and is connected in an electrically conducting fashion to lead-in wires 51 brought out of the pinched foot 50a. The lamp bulb 50 is fixed with its pinched foot 50a in a metal holding part 52 constructed as a fixing ring. The fixing ring 52 is supported by a metal intermediate ring 58, which is equipped with three integrally formed, angled-away welding lugs 58a. For its part, the intermediate ring 58 is welded to a metal support sleeve 53 by LASER. In addition to the metal fixing ring 52, the intermediate ring 58 and the metal support sleeve 53, the lamp cap also has a plastic cap part 54, which is<br><br>
-4-<br>
provided with the electric terminals 55 of the lamp and in which the support sleeve 53 is anchored. The electric terminals 55 of the lamp are respectively welded to one of the lead-in wires 51. The plastic cap part 54 is an injection-moulded part into which the metal support sleeve 53 is injected.<br>
The support sleeve 53 has three integrally formed reference noses 53a, which are arranged equidistantly along a circular circumference and are used to adjust the incandescent filament 50c and to fasten the lamp in the reflector (not illustrated) of the headlight. The reference noses 53a are angled away from the support sleeve 53 and lie in a common plane. The welding lugs 58a of the intermediate ring 58 are welded to these reference noses 53a by LASER. The intermediate ring 58 offers additional possibilities of adjustment in the reference plane defined by the reference noses 53a.<br>
The plastic cap part 54 has a circumferential, conically designed groove 54b which is in the shape of a ring and in which a sealing ring (not illustrated) made from rubber or silicon is arranged. The sealing ring bears against the outside of the reflector wall and seals the opening, constructed as lampholder, of the reflector. The inside diameter of the sealing ring is matched true to size to the conically designed groove 54b, and varies linearly with the height of the sealing ring. A cambered leaf spring 1 (Figure.3) which serves to fasten the lamp in the headlight, projects through a cutout 53b, arranged below one of the three reference noses 53a, in the wall of the support sleeve 53 in the shape of a ring. The ends 11, 12 of the leaf spring 1 bear against the inner wall of the support sleeve 53 and against in each case one stop 59a, 59b constructed in one piece with the plastic cap part 54, with the result that the leaf spring 1 is fixed clamped between these two stops 59a, 59b designed as a holder.<br><br>
-5-<br>
The three reference noses 53a, the sealing ring arranged in the groove 54b, and the pressure spring 1 serve to fasten the lamp in the lampholder of the headlight reflector. The lamp cap and the lampholder form a bayonet catch. In order to install the lamp in the reflector, the lamp is inserted, with the lamp bulb 50 in front, into the opening, constructed as lampholder, of the reflector, the three reference noses 53a respectively reaching through a true-to-size recess in the edge of the opening. Thereafter, the lamp is turned in the lampholder as far as a stop, with the result that the reflector wall is arranged seated clamped between the reference noses 53a and the sealing ring. The pressure spring 1 bears resi-liently against the edge of the opening, constructed as lampholder, of the reflector. In order to prevent the lamp from being erroneously installed in the reflector, all three reference noses 53a are of different shape. The same also holds, of course, for the recesses, matched to the reference noses 53a, in the opening constructed as lampholder. Details of the pressure spring 1 are represented in Figure 3.<br>
The pressure spring 1 is constructed as a cambered leaf spring. It has two slightly curved ends 11, 12 which, after they are mounted, bear against the inner wall of the support sleeve 53 in the shape of a ring. Moreover, two stops 59a, 59b which are designed in one piece with the plastic cap part 54 and against which the ends 11, 12 abut are used to fix the leaf spring 1. The leaf spring 1 is thereby held clamped between these stops 59a, 59b (Figure 2). It has an outwardly cambered section 10 wxth a V-shaped region 100 which, after the leaf spring 1 has been mounted, reaches through the cutout 53b in the support sleeve 53 and, after the lamp has been installed in the headlight bears in a clamped fashion against the reflector opening constructed as lampholder. The V limbs 101, 102 of the V-shaped region 100 form angle of approximately 96 degrees with one another and are connected to one another by a rounded connecting piece 103.<br><br>
-6-<br>
The cutout 53b is represented in the top view of Figure 2 only with dashed lines, since it is covered by one o£ the reference noses 53a. The outwardly cambered section 10 of the leaf spring 1 is respectively connected by means of two inwardly cambered, U-shaped sections 13 or 14 to one of the leaf spring ends 11 or 12. The leaf spring 1 consists of a spring steel sheet of 0.25 mm thickness. The reference numeral 60 in Figure 2 denotes the bushings for the lead-in wires 51 of the lamp in the plastic cap part 54.<br><br>
