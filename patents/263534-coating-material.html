				<td>DESCRIPTION COATING MATERIAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a coating material provided as a coating composition and a primer for non-treated polyolefin resin films/sheets or molded products, or a coating composition and a primer for metals such as a steel plate and aluminum, to give a coated film.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, since a polyolefin resin in general has many advantages such as having good productivity and being excellent in various kinds of moldability, as well as being lightweight, and having a corrosion resistance and an impact resistance, it has been widely used as for interiors and exteriors of automobiles or ships, household electric appliances or household furnishings, miscellaneous goods, and building materials. Such polyolefin-based resin molded product differs from a synthetic resin having a polarity, which is generally typified by a polyurethane resin, a polyamide resin, an acrylic resin, and a polyester resin, that the polyolefin resin is a non-polar and<br>
crystalline resin .  Thus, with the generalized resin composition, it is extremely difficult to perform coating or adhering thereto.<br>
[0003]<br>
Accordingly, when coating or adhering is performed on the polyolefin-based resin molded product, its surface has been activated with chromic acid, flame, corona discharge, plasma, or a solvent, such to enhance the adhesion to the surface. For example, for a bumper of automobiles, the surface is treated by etching with a halogen-based organic solvent such as trichloroethane, such to increase the adhesivity with a coated film, or a pretreatment such as a corona discharge treatment, a plasma treatment, and an ozone treatment is performed followed by carrying out the aimed coating or adhesion.  In addition, the method of treating a surface of the substrate such as molded articles with a primer has chosen, and for example, there proposed a composition in which the polyolefin is introduced with maleic acid (Patent Document 1) or a composition in which chlorinated modified polyolefin is employed as a main component (Patent Document 2).<br>
[0004]<br>
Metals such as a steel plate is also used in a wide range of fields such as interiors and exteriors for automobiles or ships, household electric appliances or household furnishings, miscellaneous goods, and building materials.  The surface of a<br>
steel plate is coated for the main purposes of improving the appearance and giving an anti-corrosive property.  In particular, it is important to prevent the cracks and abrasion of a coated film which are caused by a distortion due to an external force or an impact of materials.  Currently, in order to prevent the problems, the thickness of a coated film is increased, or ones coated with a modified propylene-ethylene copolymer (Patent Document 3) obtained by graft copolymerizing maleic acid or anhydrides thereof are employed.  However, since those include an organic solvent such as toluene and xylene, there has been a concern about the problems of safety and environment pollution. For such reason, there proposed a substance obtained by dispersing a composition, in which chlorinated modified polyolefin is employed as a main component, in water (Patent Document 4), and a substance obtained from an olefin polymer and a petroleum-based hydrocarbon resin (Patent Document 5). [0005]<br>
However, since those substances employ a large amount of surfactant to be a water-based substance, problems arise in that the water resistance of a coated film and adhesivity to a substrate decrease and that the stickiness is generated due to its bleeding out to the surface. When the used amount of the surfactant which is the cause of above problems is reduced, problems arise in that the aqueous base cannot be formed or that the stability of an<br>
aqueous resin composition is poor.  Further, there is a problem that the most of them cannot exhibit a sufficient adhesivity against a substrate.<br>

The melting point Tm is usually below 120°C, preferably below 100CC, more preferably in the range of 45 to 95°C, and even more preferably in the range of 50 to 90°C. When the melting point Tm is within the above range, in particular, a coating material excellent in<br>

Particularly in the elastomer comprising a propylene component, an ethylene component, and an α-olefin component, the propylene-ethylene-a-olef in copolymer contains preferably in the amount of 45 to 98 mol% of the propylene component, 1 to 30 mol% of the ethylene component, and 1 to 30 mol% of the α-olefin component, more preferably in<br>

The propylene-ethylene-a-olefin copolymer (A-3) containing such amount of structural units derived from propylene and if necessary such amount of structural units derived from ethylene and structural units derived from α-olefin having 4 to 20 carbon atoms, has good compatibility with the isotactic polypropylene<br>
(A-4), and thus obtained propylene-based polymer composition tends to exhibit a sufficient transparency, flexibility, heat resistance, and scratch resistance.<br>
[0035]<br>
The intrinsic viscosity [n] of the<br>
propylene-ethylene-a-olefin copolymer (A-3) as measured in decalin at 135°C is desirably within the range of usually from 0.01 to 10 dl/g and preferably from 0.05 to 10 dl/g. When the intrinsic viscosity [n] of the propylene-ethylene-a-olefin random copolymer is in the above range, a propylene-ethylene-a-olefin random copolymer having excellent properties of weather resistance, ozone resistance, thermal aging resistance, low temperature<br>
characteristic, and resistance to dynamic fatigue can be obtained. [0036]<br>
The crystallinity of the propylene-ethylene-a-olef in copolymer (A-3) measured by X-ray diffraction is usually 20% or less and preferably from 0 to 15%.  In addition, the<br>
propylene-ethylene-a-olef in copolymer (A-3) has single glass transition temperature, and the glass transition temperature Tg measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is desirably within the range of usually -10°C or below and preferably -15°C or below. When the glass transition temperature Tg of the<br>
propylene-ethylene-a-olef in copolymer is in the above range, excellent cold resistance and low temperature characteristic are provided.<br>
[0037]<br>
In addition, the molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn, in terms of polystyrene, Mw: weight average molecular weight, Mn: number average molecular weight) as measured with GPC is preferably 4.0 or less, more preferably 3.0 or less, and more preferably 2.5 or less, and the propylene-ethylene-a-olef in copolymer (A-3) can be produced in a metallocene catalyst system which includes a metallocene compound as a catalyst component, but may not be limited by this.<br>
[0038]<br>
The propylene-ethylene-α-olef in copolymer (A-3) useful in<br>
the invention has the melting point determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of preferably below 100°C in usual and more preferably has no observed melting point. The "no observed melting point" means that there is no observed crystalline melting peak having a heat of crystalline fusion of 1 J/g or more within the range of -150 to 200°C. The measurement conditions are as described in Example. [0039]<br>
The triad tacticity (mm fraction) of the propylene-ethylene α-olef in copolymer (A-3) measured by 13C-NMR is preferably 85% or more, more preferably 85 to 97.5% or less, more preferably 87 to 97%, and particularly preferably 90 to 97%. When the triad tacticity (mm fraction) is in the above range, a balance between the flexibility and the mechanical strength is particularly excellent, thus it is suitable for the invention.

The isotactic polypropylene (A-4) can be exemplified by a propylene homopolymer or a copolymer of propylene and at least one α-olefin having 2 to 20 carbon atoms excluding propylene.

The obtained thermoplastic elastomer (A) and/or the thermoplastic elastomer (B) in which at last one moiety is modified with a functional group can be dispersed in water using a salt of acid-modified polyolefin (J) and/or a salt of higher fatty acid (K) in accordance with the following method. [0057]<br>
The salt of the acid-modified polyolefin (J) useful in the invention is the olefin-based resin which contains a salt group of carboxylic acid (in the case of partially neutralized material and partially saponified material, carboxylic acid is included) bonded to a polymer chain of the polyolefin in the concentration of 0.05 to 5 mmol and preferably 0.1 to 4 mmol per 1 gram of the resin as a -COO- group. [0058]<br>
The acid-modified polyolefin (J), for example, can be obtained by graft copolymerizing polyolefin formed from α-olefin or the like with a monomer having a neutralized or non-neutralized carboxylic acid group and/or a monomer having saponified or non-saponified carboxylate ester.<br>
Regarding to the molecular weight of the acid-modified polyolefin (J) , a polymer of α-olefin alone or a copolymer of two or more kinds of α-olefin having the number average molecular weight (Mn) measured with GPC in the range of 500 to 10,000 is<br>

Here, the ethylene-based unsaturated carboxylic acid can be exemplified by (metha) acrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tetrahydro phthalic acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, crotonic acid, isocrotonic acid, or the like, the anhydrides thereof can be exemplified by nadic acid™ (endocis-bicyclo[2,2,1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid), maleic anhydride, citraconic anhydride, or the like, and the unsaturated carboxylate ester can be exemplified by monoesters<br>
or diesters such as methyl, ethyl, and propyl, of the ethylene-based unsaturated carboxylic acid.  The monomers can be employed alone or in plural kinds. [0062]<br>
In order to produce a modified product by graft copolymerizing a graft monomer selected from the above monomers to a polymer to be grafted, various kinds of conventionally well-known methods can be employed.  For example, a method which comprises melting a polymer to be grafted to add a graft monomer and subjecting to a graft copolymerization, a method which comprises melting in an organic solvent to add a graft monomer and subjecting to a graft copolymerization, and the like can be mentioned.  In any case, it is preferable to carry out the reaction in the presence of a polymerization initiator to effectively graft copolymerize the graft monomer. [0063]<br>
The graft reaction is carried out at the temperature of usually 60 to 350°C.  The proportion of the polymerization initiator used is usually in the range of 0. 01 to 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the polymer to be grafted. As the polymerization initiator, the polymerization initiator (1-1) mentioned above can be exemplified. Among the polymerization initiator, dialkyl peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide, di-tert-butylperoxide,<br>

1,4-bis(tert-butylperoxy isopropyl)benzene are preferable.<br>
[0064]<br>
The basic substance useful for neutralization and saponification can be exemplified by alkali metals such as sodium and potassium, inorganic amines such as hydroxyl amine and ammonium hydroxide, organic amines such as methylamine and ethanolamine, ammonia, sodium oxide, sodium peroxide, oxides of alkali metals and alkali earth metals, hydroxide, and weak acid salts of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals such as sodium carbonate. [0065]<br>
As the carboxylic acid group or the carboxylate ester group neutralized or saponified with the basic substance, alkali metal salts of carboxylic acids such as sodium carboxylate and potassium carboxylate, and ammonium carboxylate are preferable. Among these, potassium carboxylate is preferable. [0066]<br>
As the salts of higher fatty acid (K) useful in the invention, preferably salts of fatty acid having 25 to 60 carbon atoms, more preferably alkali metal salts, alkali earth metal salts, and amine salts, of fatty acid having 25 to 40 carbon atoms, can be exemplified.  Preferred examples include alkali metal salts of<br>
montanic acid and oleic acid.  In addition, the salts of higher fatty acid (K) may include higher fatty acid and/or esters of higher fatty acid, in addition to the higher fatty acid salt.  The alcohol residue constituting ester has preferably 2 to 30 carbon atoms, and particularly preferably 6 to 20 carbon atoms.  The residue may be in any of linear and branched forms, and may be a mixture of ones having different number of carbon atoms. Specific examples of the alcohol residue include residues of higher alcohol such as cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and oleyl alcohol.  Here, ester wax of montanic acid and montan wax are particularly preferable. [0067]<br>
The salt of higher fatty acid (K) can be obtained by neutralizing the above higher fatty acid and/or saponifying the above ester of higher fatty acid.  In this case, partially neutralized product or partially saponified product where non-neutralized or non-saponified fatty acid or fatty acid ester is coexisted may also be employed. As the basic substance capable of being used for neutralization and saponification, the above-mentioned basic substances can be exemplified. [0068]<br>
In order to improve the stability of dispersion in water, various surfactants (L) can also be used.  Examples include anionic surfactants such as alkyl naphthalenesulfonate and<br>
metallic soaps (Zn, Al, Na, and K salts); nonionic surfactants such as fatty acid monoglyceride; alkylammonium chloride; amphoteric surfactants; and water-soluble polyvalent metal salts. These surfactants can be used alone or as a mixture of two or more kinds.  The amount of the surfactant (L) used is preferably from about 0.05 to 40 wt%, more preferably from 0.1 to 20 wt%, and particularly preferably from 0.1 to 10 wt%, to the resin formed with the thermoplastic elastomer and the copolymerizable monomer including a monomer having an a, p-monoethylenic unsaturated group and other copolymerizable monomer. [0069]<br>
The water-based composition of the thermoplastic elastomer (A) and/or the thermoplastic elastomer (B) in which at least one moiety is modified with a functional group, useful in the invention desirably contains each component in a certain range of quantitative ratio.  That is, it is desirable that a salt of the acid-modified polyolefin (J) and/or a salt of the higher fatty acid (K) are/is included from 0.5 to 30 parts by weight and preferably from 1 to 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic elastomer (A) and/or the thermoplastic elastomer (B) in which at least one moiety is modified with a functional group. [0070]<br>
In addition, the surfactant (L) which is added when desired<br>
is preferably blended in the range of 0.1 to 40 parts by weight and particularly preferably 0.2 to 20 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic elastomer (A) and/or the thermoplastic elastomer (B) in which at least one moiety is modified with a functional group. [0071]<br>
Further, the content of water is from 1 to 25 wt% and preferably from 1 to 20 wt%, to the thermoplastic elastomer (A) and/or the thermoplastic elastomer (B) in which at least one moiety is modified with a functional group. When the water content is below 1 wt%, the phase inversion (inversion of resin solid from continuous phase to dispersed phase due to water) hardly occurs, and thus preferred aqueous dispersion cannot be obtained.  When the content exceeds 25 wt%, the aqueous dispersion tends to have a flow property.  In other words, the solid-look aqueous dispersion can be obtained in the range of 1 to 25%. [0072]<br>
The such mentioned water-based composition can be produced with the use of the thermoplastic elastomer (A) and/or the thermoplastic elastomer (B) in which at least one moiety is modified with a functional group, and the acid-modified polyolef in and/or the higher fatty acid preferably according to the methods such as a method in which the thermoplastic elastomer (A) and/or the thermoplastic elastomer (B) in which at least one moiety is<br>
modified with a functional group are/is melt-kneaded with the acid-modified polyolefin and/or the fatty acid and/or the fatty acid ester, then a basic substance and water are added thereto, the mixture is further melt-kneaded, then subjected to neutralization and/or saponification, and allowed a dispersion (phase inversion) of the thermoplastic elastomer (A) and/or the thermoplastic elastomer (B) in which at least one moiety is modified with a functional group to an aqueous phase; and a method in which water is preliminarily added as a basic substance to the acid-modified polyolefin and/or the fatty acid and/or the fatty acid ester, the mixture is neutralized and/or saponified, the resultant is melt-kneaded with the thermoplastic elastomer (A) and/or the thermoplastic elastomer (B) in which at least one moiety is modified with a functional group, then further melt-kneaded by adding more water to allow the dispersion (phase inversion) of the thermoplastic elastomer (A) and/or the thermoplastic elastomer (B) in which at least one moiety is modified with a functional group to an aqueous phase. [0073]<br>
The former method is simpler and forms a small and uniform particle size, thus is preferable. The melt-kneading means used for the phase inversion may be any well known ones, but preferably can be exemplified by a kneader, a banbury mixer, or a multiscrew extruder.<br>
The proportion of the basic substance added for neutralization or saponification is from 60 to 200% and preferably from 80 to 170%, of total carboxylic acid or carboxylate ester. In addition, the aqueous dispersion obtained by the melt-kneading and the phase inversion includes 1 to 25% of water. This water content can be either used as it is or water may be further supplied to lower the viscosity. [0075]<br>

isocyanates such as<br>
4,4' -dimethylbenzenesulfonyl-ethylenediamine-4,4'-diisocyanat<br>

In addition, their alkyl substituent, alkoxy substituent, and nitro substituent; a prepolymer modified product with polyvalent alcohol, a carbodiimide modified product, an urea modified product, and a burette modified product; or a dimerized or trimerized reaction product, may be used, but polyfunctional isocyanate compounds other than the above-mentioned compounds may also be used. These polyfunctional isocyanate compounds may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more kinds. [0077]<br>
Among the above compounds, from the points of yellowing resistance, heat stability, photo stability of the coating formed by coating the obtained resin, or from easy availability of polyfunctional isocyanate compound, aliphatic polyisocyanate and alicyclic polyisocyanate compounds are preferable, and of these,<br>

When the used amount is below 50 parts by weight, the feeling property of coating obtained from an aqueous coating material tends to deteriorate, and when it is above 98 parts by weight, coating strength and rigidity tends to decrease.  These compounds each may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more kinds. [0080]<br>
In order to stabilize as a water-based resin composition of the urethane resin (U) useful in the invention, well known materials and stabilizing techniques may be used, but the molecule includes preferably one or more kinds of carboxyl group, sulfonyl group, and ethylene oxide group, and more preferably one or more of carboxyl groups and/or sulfonyl groups.

According to the introduction of those atomic groups into a molecule, the mechanical stability of the resin and the mixing stability with other component are likely to improve. [0082]<br>
The preferred amount when using the above carboxyl group and/or sulfonyl group-containing compound is such that the acid value in terms of the solid content of the water-based resin composition of the urethane resin (U) is within the range of 2 to 35 KOHmg/g, and more preferably 3 to 30 KOHmg/g. When it is below the range of that acid value, the mechanical stability of the resin tends to reduce. [0083]<br>
The production method of a water-based resin composition of the urethane resin (U) is not particularly limited, but the following methods can be exemplified. There are a method which comprises reacting a polyfunctional isocyanate compound, a compound having an active hydrogen group capable of reacting with the isocyanate group in the active hydrogen compound, and a<br>
compound having an active hydrogen group capable of reacting with the isocyanate group in the compound and having at least one of carboxyl group, sulfonyl group and ethylene oxide group in the molecule, where reacted in an equivalent ratio such that the isocyanate group is excessive and in the presence of or without a suitable organic solvent, so as to produce a urethane prepolymer having an isocyanate group at the molecular end, next neutralizing the ones having a carboxyl group and/or a sulfonyl group in the above prepolymer with the use of a neutralizing agent such as tertiary amine, subsequently charging this neutralized prepolymer in an aqueous solution containing a chain extender for carrying out the reaction, and then removing the organic solvent when present in the system, to obtain the composition; a method which comprises charging the non-neutralized urethane prepolymer obtained according to the previous method into an aqueous solution containing a neutralizing agent and a chain extender, and subjecting to the reaction to obtain the composition; a method which comprises adding an aqueous solution containing a chain extender to the neutralized urethane prepolymer obtained according to the previous method, and subjecting to the reaction to obtain the composition; and a method which comprises adding an aqueous solution containing a neutralizing agent and a chain extender to the non-neutralized urethane prepolymer obtained according to the previous method, and subjecting to the reaction<br>
to obtain an aqueous solution of dispersion.<br>
[0084]<br>
The neutralizing agent useful in the invention is not particularly limited, but can be exemplified by alkanolamines such as N,N-dimethylethanolamine and N,N-diethyl ethanolamine; tertiary amines such as N-methylmorpholine, N-ethylmorpholine, pyridine, N-methylimidazole, ammonia, trimethylamine, and triethylamine; alkali metal compounds such as lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and aluminum hydroxide; and quaternary ammonium compounds such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide.

[0086]<br>
Examples of the chain extender useful in the invention include water, ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, NBDA<br>
(product name, manufactured by Mitsui Chemicals, Inc.),<br>
N-methyl-3,3'-diaminopropylamine, and polyamines such as an adduct of diethylenetriamine with acrylate and hydrolyzed product thereof.<br>
[0087]<br>
As the solvent used during the process of obtaining the water-based resin compositing of the urethane resin (U) , ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone and acetone, esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate, and tetrahydrofuran can be exemplified, but is not particularly limited as long as the solvent has the boiling point of 100°C or below. These solvents may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more kinds. Using the solvent having a boiling point of above 100°C, that is higher than the boiling point of water, makes difficult to completely distill off only a solvent from the solution after forming an aqueous dispersion, and the solvent with high boiling point remains in the coating thereby affecting the property. Therefore, when such solvent is unavoidably used to exhibit the performance, it is preferably used in the amount of 10 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of a water-based resin composition of the urethane resin<br>
(U) .<br>
[0088]<br>
The water-based resin composition of the urethane resin (U) useful in the invention can be reacted with the other component such as other monomers and resin components so as to be used as<br>

The production method of a water-based resin composition of the resin (G) useful in the invention, which is formed from the copolymerizable monomer (G-1) including a monomer having an α,ß-monoethylenic unsaturated group and other copolymerizable monomer is not particularly limited, but can be produced according to the well-known method such as a method which comprises adding a basic substance and ion-exchange water to a resin solution obtained by solution polymerizing the copolymerizable monomer<br>
(G-1) and the polymerization initiator (1-1) in the organic solvent (H) , and then removing the organic solvent; and a method which comprises emulsion polymerizing the copolymerizable monomer (G-1) in water in the presence of the surfactant (L) and the polymerization initiator (1-2) described below.<br>
[0092]<br>
Of the methods in the invention, for obtaining the water-based resin composition of the resin (G) formed from the copolymerizable monomer (G-1) which includes a monomer having an<br>
a, (3-monoethylenic unsaturated group and other copolymerizable monomer, it is necessary in the former method that the<br>
copolymerizable monomer (G-1) has an acidic group which can be neutralized with a basic substance.  Specifically, the synthesis is carried out under conditions of using the carboxyl group-containing vinyls mentioned for the copolymerizable monomer (G-1) and providing an acid value of the resin of 10 mgKOH/g or more. The acid value of the resin is preferably 10 mgKOH/g or more, and more preferably 15 mgKOH/g or more.  When the acid value is less than 10 mgKOH/g, the hydrophilicity reduces, thus hardly becomes waterborne resin.  The acid value described is a value for the resin (solid) excluding the solvent. [0093]<br>
In addition, the organic solvent (H) used is not particularly limited as long as the boiling point is 100°C or below, and these solvents may be used alone or as in the form of a mixture of two or more kinds.  Using the solvent having a boiling point of above 100°C, that is higher than the boiling point of water, makes difficult to completely distill off only a solvent from the solution after forming an aqueous dispersion, and the solvent with high boiling point remains in the coating thereby affecting the property.  Therefore, when such solvent is unavoidably used to exhibit the performance, it is preferably used in the amount of 10 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of a water-based resin composition of the urethane resin (U) formed from the copolymerizable monomer (G-1) which includes a monomer<br>

[0095]<br>
As the basic substance used for synthesizing the water-based resin composition of the resin (G) of the invention formed from the copolymerizable monomer (G-l) which includes a monomer having<br>

Onto the coated film, a white coating composition (produced by Nippon Bee Chemical Co., Ltd., mixed in the proportion of product name; R278 (base resin) / R271 (curing agent) = 8/2) for top coating was coated to give a dried film thickness of 80 urn, and a coated film was formed.  Thus formed coated film was allowed to stand for 10 minutes at room temperature, then placed in an oven at 80°C, and treated for 30 minutes to prepare test pieces.  With the use of the test pieces, a cross cut peeling after 24 hours was tested. The evaluated results obtained from Examples are shown in Table-1, Table-3, and Table-5, and results obtained from Comparative Examples are shown in Table-2, Table-4, and Table-6. [0225]<br>
Cross Cut Peeling Test<br>
A test piece having cross cuts was prepared in accordance with a method for cross cut peeling test as defined in JIS-K-5400, and a cello tape (registered trademark) was adhered to the cross<br>
cuts.  Thereafter, the tape was drawn quickly at a direction of 90° to peel it off and the number of cross cuts from which the coated film was not peeled off was counted within 100 cross cuts for evaluation. [0226]<br>
Peeling Strength Measurement<br>
A coating film was formed on a substrate and a cut having a 1 cm width was formed, and then the edge thereof was released. Thereafter, the released edge was pulled at a direction of 180° at a rate of 50 mm/min and the peeling strength was measured. The peeling strength of 800 g/cm or more is shown as O, and the peeling strength of less than 800 g/cm is shown as x. For Examples 37 to 52 and Comparative Examples 10 to 13, the peeling strength of 1,000 g/cm or more is shown as O, and the peeling strength of less than 1,000 g/cm is shown as x. [0227]<br>
Weather Resistance Test<br>
After the accelerated weathering test was carried out in accordance with the disclosure in JIS-K-5400 by means of a carbon-arc sunshine lamp for 1000 hours, the cross cut peeling test and gloss retention were evaluated. [0228]<br>
Gloss Retention Measurement<br>
The gloss retention of the measured value obtained from the<br>
60° specular gloss (JIS-K-5400) before and after the treatment was calculated by the equation: gloss retention (%) = (gloss after treatment / initial gloss) X 100. The gloss retention of 80% or more and no observed color change is evaluated as O, the gloss retention of 60% or more and under 80% is evaluated as A, and under 60% is evaluated as x. [0229]<br>
Hot Water Resistance Test<br>
The above test pieces were immersed for 240 hours in hot water adjusted to 40°C, and only such treated pieces were subjected to the evaluation of a coated film appearance and cross cut peeling test. [0230]<br>
Coated Film Appearance<br>
The coated film after the test was subjected to an evaluation of observing whether or not the blister is formed, and the coated film with no change is shown as O, and having a change such as forming blister is shown as x. [0231]<br>
