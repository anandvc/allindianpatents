COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
SATIETY ENHANCING FOOD COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009300<br><br>
Satiety Enhancing Food Compositions<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to food composition having an<br>
5  enhanced satiety effect, particularly aqueous liquid or   spoonable compositions comprising a biopolymer thickening    agent.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
10 The incidence of obesity and the number of people considered<br>
overweight in countries where a so-called Western diet is adopted has drastically increased over the last decade. Since obesity and being overweight are generally known to be associated with a variety of diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes,<br>
15 hypertension and arthereosclerosis, this increase is a major health concern for the medical world and for individuals alike. Furthermore, being overweight is considered by the majority of the Western population as unattractive.<br>
20 This has led to an increasing interest by consumers in their<br>
health and has created a demand for products that help to reduce or control daily caloric intake and/or control body weight and/or bodily appearance.<br>
25 Several solutions have been proposed to help individuals to control their weight. Among these solutions is the use of drugs e.g. to suppress the activity of enzymes in the digestive system. However the use of drugs is often not preferred unless strictly required for medical purposes.<br>
30<br>
Another proposed solution is to prescribe the individuals a specific diet, for example, a diet with a restricted caloric intake per day. A problem with these diets is that often they do<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009300<br><br>
2<br>
not provide a healthy nutritional balance and/or they are difficult to accommodate in modem lifestyles.<br>
Meal replacer products have also been proposed as part of a <br>
5 healthy diet in order to control or reduce body weight.  For example, US 5,688,547 discloses a nutritional meal replacement composition comprising dietary fibre, protein, a cellulose gum and gel.<br>
10 	These meal replacer products are generally products that are intended to be consumed as a single-serving food product, such as a bar, drink etc to replace one or two meals per day. The meal replacer products are designed such that on the one hand they provide a restricted caloric intake, but on the other hand<br>
15 they provide a healthy balance of nutritional ingredients and are convenient to incorporate into an individual's daily diet.<br>
However, a general problem with products intended to be used in a weight loss or weight maintenance plan, e.g. meal replacer<br>
20 products or low-calorie snacks, is that feelings of hunger may occur sooner than desired after consumption and/or the feeling of satiety obtained may not be as great as desired.  Both of these considerations may render it difficult for the individual to adhere to the plan or it may make it and/or the products used<br>
25 therein less appealing to consumers.<br>
Recognising the demand for effective and convenient satiety-  inducing food products, research has been carried out to try to address the problems associated with the above approaches to<br>
 30 controlling or reducing body weight.<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009300<br><br>
3<br>
One approach to addressing the aforementioned problems has been to investigate the use of satiety agents in food products in order to increase the satiety effect obtained from consuming a food product comprising the satiety agents.<br>
5<br>
	WO 01/17541 discloses a composition comprising proteins, high 	levels of calcium, medium or long chain fatty acids and a 	source of a proteinase inhibitor extracted from potatoes to 	promote satiety. <br>
10<br>
	WO 99/02041 discloses a food composition giving a prolonged 	feeling of satiety and comprising a mixture of specific 	triglyceride oils and a food emulsifier.<br>
15 		WO 01/17377 discloses uronic acid-containing polysaccharides 	cross-linked to each other to form a sponge-like structure 	that dissolves poorly in water and gastro-intestinal fluids, 	and which are poorly reabsorbed, in order to provide a 	satiety effect.<br>
20<br>
	Another approach to reduce the feeling of hunger which has 	been suggested is to use the principle of the ileal brake. The 	ileal brake principle itself is described by Gregg W. Van 	Citters in The Ileal Brake: A fifteen-year progress report. 	Current<br>
25 		Gastronenterology Reports 1999, 1:4040-409 and which concerns 	the delivery of satiety agents to parts of the gut e.g the 	ileum, duodenum or jejunum.<br>
	However, the above developments are generally complicated 	and/or <br>
30 	expensive and/or not as effective as is desired.<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009300<br><br>
4<br>
Another problem in the formulation of the above types of food   products is that it is often not desirable to include ingredients which may create a negative impression on the consumer when declared on the pack, or, which are not suitable for<br>
5   incorporation in food products e.g. certain synthetic polymers.<br>
To provide simpler solutions to the problem of providing good  satiety effects, natural fibres have been disclosed for use in food compositions for the purpose of enhancing satiety.  US<br>
10  4,198,400 discloses the use of dietary fibres in juice and soup compositions to aid a feeling of satiety.<br>
WO 02/096223 discloses a method of blunting the post-prandial glycemic response in humans by feeding an induced viscosity fibre<br>
15 system. The system comprises a lightly hydrolysed starch, a  soluble dietary fibre source and acid-soluble multi-valent cations. Digestive enzymes act upon the lightly hydrolysed starch to produce an increase in viscosity of the system.  Gel strength determined using the gel strength test described herein<br>
20   was found to be less than 2000 Pa.<br>
US 5 866 190 discloses beverages comprising up to 0.2%wt of a  mixture of pectin and alginate as a stabiliser.  The acidic beverages disclosed have a very low viscosity and do not form<br>
25	gels at pH 2.0.<br><br>
WO 92/09212 discloses liquid compositions consisting of a surfactant, water and a water soluble, non-ionic cellulose ether having a cloud point of no greater than 35°C. The composition are <br>
30 	disclosed to be suitable for use as a slimming aid.<br><br>

5<br>
US 5 283 076 and US 5 324 526 disclose beverage formulations that may be used as health foods. The beverages preferably comprise 5-20%wt of low molecular weight alginates. Use of these alginates in the prevention of obesity is proposed. Very weak <br>
5 	gels are formed at pH 2.0 using the gel strength test described herein and the gels are too soft to be measured.<br>
US 5,688,547 discloses shakes, puddings or mousses comprising protein, cellulose gel and gum and dietary fibres including<br>
10 	pectin, alginate, gum arabic and guar gum.<br>
EP-A-323,510 discloses a food composition comprising water-soluble edible fibres and proteins which are reported to be useful for the prevention of over-eating. The dietary fibres and<br>
15	proteins are used in a ratio such that a weak, gel is formed when an aqueous solution of the composition is in contact with gastric juice. The gel strength of the composition is less than 10 Kpa according to the gel strength test of the present invention.<br><br>
20 	WO 01/56404 discloses that 0.01 to 5%wt of a low molecular weight polymannuronate derived from alginate may be used in a functional beverage.<br><br>
US 2003/0013679 and WO 02/096353 disclose a method of blunting<br>
25 	the post-prandial glycemic response in humans by feeding an<br>
induced viscosity fibre system. The systems comprise a lightly hydrolysed starch and a soluble dietary fibre source in amounts of at least 10%wt. Digestive enzymes act upon the lightly hydrolysed starch to produce an increase in viscosity of the<br>
30 	system.<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>

6<br>
WO 00/67592 discloses methods of producing low viscosity glucomannan comprising compositions by mixing maltodextrin with konjac flour. This is said to provide for the conversion of a food or beverage product from an initial low viscosity substance <br>
5 	to a high viscosity end-product.<br>
Marciani et al in the paper "Assessment of antral grinding of a model solid meal with echo-planar imaging', 2001 American Journal Physiology-Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology, pg<br>
10 	844-G849 disclose that the maximum force exerted by the gastric antrum is close to 0.65N. The sense of fullness after ingesting a low viscosity meal containing pre-formed agar beads directly correlated with increasing bead hardness. The objective of the invention described herein is the formation of<br>
15 	gelled particles in the stomach after consumption of a liquid or spoonable composition.<br>
Wolf et al in the paper "Glycemic and insulinemic responses of non-diabetic healthy adult subjects to an experimental acid-<br>
20 	induced viscosity complex incorporated into a glucose beverage", Nutrition, Volume 18, numbers 7/8, 2002, disclose an acid induced viscosity complex comprising alginates. The viscosity of the compositions tested (which did not comprise protein) rose between pH 5 and 4 but then showed a sharp<br>
25	decrease in viscosity at below 4.<br><br>
EP-A-333,858 discloses a food composition having a reduced amount of carbohydrate and containing water soluble edible fibers and proteins in such an amount that when an aqueous solution of the <br>
30 	food comes into contact with a gastric juice the solution will gel. The compositions have been found to only form a weak gel on contact with gastric juice.<br><br>

US 2002/0193344-A1 discloses a method of blunting the post prandial glycemic response to a meal by feeding an acid controlled induced fibre system comprising an anionic soluble<br>
5   	fibre and water- insoluble, acid-soluble multivalent cations. The compositions have been found to only form a weak gel according to the gel strength test of the present invention.<br>
US 2003/118712-A1 and US 2003/0198726-A1 disclose liquid<br>
10 	compositions having a pH of more than 6 and comprising pectin   and/or alginate, calcium and indigestible oligosaccharide. The  compositions have been found to form a very weak gel, if any at all, according to the gel strength test of the present invention<br>
15 	WO 02/096223 discloses a method of blunting the post- prandinal glycemic response to. a meal by feeding a dual induced viscosity fibre system. The system comprises soluble fibre and water-insoluble, acid-soluble multivalent cations. The compositions have been found to only form a weak gel according to the gel<br>
20 	strength test of the present invention.<br>
JP 04/023,968 discloses food compositions comprising a water- insoluble dietary fibre and calcium compound which in insoluble in a neutral region. An aqueous solution comprising the<br>
25 	compositions are said to gel when contacting gastric juice. The compositions comprise very low levels of protein, if any.<br>
Alginates are known for use in food products as a gelling agent. See for example: FR-A-2,649,299, GB-A-1,428,362, GB-A-1,369,199<br>
 30 	and GB-A-1,531,219.<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009300<br><br>
8<br>
However, the satiety effect obtained by the above compositions is often not optimal and thus there is still a need in the art for edible compositions that provide a good satiety effect for consumers, especially those wishing to control their calorie<br>
5 	intake and/or body weight.<br>
In particular, there is a need for compositions which provide good satiety effects, which are of acceptable taste and texture for the consumer, which are convenient and/or economical to<br>
10	manufacture and which are stable during manufacture and storage. This is especially applicable to meal replacement products or other calorie-controlled products intended to be consumed as part of a weight loss or weight control plan.<br>
15 	The present invention seeks to address one or more of the above-mentioned problems.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the invention to provide food products that have a good satiety effect. It is also an object of <br>
20 	the invention to provide food products to be used in a method of preventing or treating obesity, especially human obesity.<br><br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide food products which address one or more of the above mentioned problems and<br>
25 	which comprise conventional, preferably natural, food ingredients.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide food products, especially meal replacer products and products to be used in a<br>
30	weight loss or weight control plan, that have an improved satiety effect compared to conventional types of such food products.<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCT7EP2004/009300<br><br>
9<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a method, and food products to be used therein, to aid an individual adhere to a weight loss or weight control plan (e.g. a calorie controlled diet) , and/or to control body weight and/or to<br>
5	improve or maintain the perception of body image or body weight.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide food products which can be prepared by, and which are not substantially <br>
10 	negatively affected by, conventional food processing and food preparation techniques.<br>
In particular, there is a need for food products, especially meal replacer products and food products to be used as part of<br>
15 	a weight loss or weight control plan which address one or more of the above problems.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
20 		Surprisingly we have now found that by including biopolymers in food compositions comprising protein and controlling the gel strength of those compositions under gastric conditions excellent results are obtained, especially with respect to satiety effects.<br>
25<br>
Thus according to a first aspect, the present invention provides an aqueous liquid or spoonable edible composition comprising at least 1% wt protein and from 0.1 to 5%wt of a biopolymer thickening agent which is not denatured or<br>
30 	hydrolysed between pH 2 and 4, and wherein the composition has a gel strength at 37°C and pH 2 of at least 10 KPa.<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009300<br><br>
10<br>
According to a second aspect, the invention provides The use of a biopolymer thickening agent which is not denatured or hydrolysed between pH 2 and 4 in the manufacture of an aqueous liquid or spoonable edible composition comprising at least 1% <br>
5 	wt and having a protein gel strength at 37°C and pH 2 of at least 10 KPa, for use in providing an enhanced feeling of satiety to a person consuming the edible composition and/or to aid adherence to a weight loss or weight control plan and/or in a method of preventing or treating obesity or being overweight.<br>
10<br>
According to a third aspect, the invention provides a method for inducing satiety in a human or animal, the method comprising the step of administering to a human or animal an aqueous liquid or spoonable edible composition comprising at<br>
15 	least 1% wt protein and from 0.1 to 5%wt of a biopolymer<br>
thickening agent which is not denatured or hydrolysed between pH 2 and 4, the edible composition having a gel strength at 37°C and pH 2 of at least 10 KPa.<br>
20 	Depending upon the type of food product, it is preferred that the edible composition has a maximum gel strength at 37 °C and pH 2 of 100 KPa.<br>
It is further preferred that the edible composition comprises a <br>
25   polysaccharide continuous phase, which continuous phase<br>
comprises at least a part of the biopolymer thickening agent, preferably from 0.5 to 10% wt of the based on the weight of the polysaccharide continuous phase.<br>
30 	It has been found that the presence of proteins in the edible compositions of the invention aids in the formation of the required gel strength according to the invention.  Furthermore, the presence of both the protein and the biopolymer thickening<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCIYEP2004/009300<br><br>
11<br>
agent is believed to have beneficial effects upon satiety, possibly, through changes to nutrient delivery in the small intestines. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the claimed gel strength is formed in the stomach<br>
5 	of the person consuming the edible composition of the<br>
invention, and leads to distension of the stomach which may lead to an increased satiety effect.<br>
Preferably the biopolymer thickening comprises an ionic non-<br>
10 	starch polysaccharide, most preferably selected from alginates, pectins, carrageenans, amidated pectins, xanthans, gellans, furcellarans, karaya gum, rhamsan, welan, gum ghatti, gum arabic and salts or mixtures thereof. Alginates having a L-guluronic acid content of at least 60% are the most preferred<br>
 15 ionic non-starch polysaccharides.<br><br>
Preferably the edible composition is a meal replacer or other food composition intended to be used in a weight loss or weight control plan.<br>
20<br>
The present invention provides an effective and convenient method of providing good satiety effects to food compositions, especially those intended to be used in a weight loss or weight control plan. Furthermore, the products can be manufactured by<br>
25 	conventional techniques and are economical to produce. They are also stable upon storage.<br><br>
The advantages of the present invention include a good 	satiety effect after consumption of a food composition 	according to the<br>
30 	invention; for example an enhanced feeling of satiety, feeling satiated sooner whilst eating and/or remaining satiated for a longer period of time after eating.  These advantages are especially beneficial for the compliance with weight loss or<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009300<br><br>
12<br>
weight control plans and/or the control or maintenance of body weight and/or body perception. There are also longer-term advantages associated with helping in the prevention of diseases related to being overweight. <br>
5<br>
The term "meal replacer" or "meal replacement products" as used herein refer to products (compositions) which are intended to replace one or more conventional meals a day as part of a weight loss or weight plan; they are of a controlled calorie<br>
10 	content and are generally eaten as a single product or portion.<br><br>
The term "comprising" is not meant to be limiting to any subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In <br>
15 		other words the listed steps, elements or options need not be exhaustive.  Whenever the words "including" or "having" are used, these terms are meant to be equivalent to "comprising" as defined above.<br><br>
20 		Spoonable edible compositions according to the invention typically display at 20°C the following characteristics:<br>
(a)  a yield value (also called: yield stress) of more than 50 Pa extrapolated from shear rates between 100 and 300 s"1 (Bingham)<br>
25 		(b)  a Bingham viscosity of less than 500 mPa.s between shear rates of 100 and 300 s-1.<br><br>
Yield stress and Bingham viscosities may be determined 	utilising the Carrimed Rheometer. Measurements are performed 	at <br>
 30 	5°C using 4°C cone and plate geometry. The shear stress is<br>
increased from zero at a rate of 60 Pa/min and shear rates are measured until values in excess of 600 s"1 are achieved. The measurement is then terminated. A graph of shear stress vs.<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009300<br><br>
13<br>
shear rate is plotted and a straight line fitted to the curve   between the shear rates of 100 to 300 s"1. The slope of this line is the Bingham viscosity. The yield stress is determined by extrapolation of this line back to zero shear rate. <br>
5<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be<br>
10 	understood as modified by the word * about.*' All amounts are by weight, based on the total weight of the relevant product, unless otherwise specified.<br>
Unless stated otherwise or required by context, the terms "fat" <br>
15 	and "oil" are used interchangeably herein.<br>
A feeling of satiety as referred to herein means a greater or enhanced feeling of satiety (satiation) after eating and/or a longer lasting feeling of satiety after eating. Such effects<br>
20 	typically reduce feelings of hunger and/or extend the time between food intake by an individual and can result in a smaller amount of food and/or fewer calories consumed in a single or subsequent sitting. The references herein to satiety include both what is strictly referred to as satiation and<br>
25 	satiety, including end of meal satiety and between meals<br>
satiety. Satiety may also be perceived by an individual as 	a feeling of ‘fullness', reduced hunger and/or reduced 	appetite.<br><br>

5 Detailed description of invention<br>
Gel strength<br>
It has been found, according to the present invention, that <br>
10 	when liquid or spoonable edible compositions comprise a certain amount of protein and biopolymer thickening agents and have a certain gel strength as hereindefined, advantageous satiety effects are obtained.<br>
15 The edible compositions according to the invention have a gel strength at 37°C and pH 2 of at least 10 KPa, preferably of at least 11 KPa, most preferably of at least 15 KPa, such as of at least 20 KPa.<br>

1.	325ml of the edible composition is placed in a beaker,<br>
maintained at 37°C and stirred using a suitable stirrer,<br>
e.g. a magnetic stirrer.<br>
2.	The composition is acidified instantaneously to pH 4.8<br>
5     using 1M hydrochloric acid. 10ml of the gastric juice<br>
described in point 3 below is added to represent the conditions found in a fasting stomach.<br>
3.	A peristaltic pump is set up so as to deliver two<br>
solutions, each at a pre-set rate of 0.523ml/min over a<br>
10 	period of about 30 minutes so that the pH of the edible composition is in the range of from 3.4 to 4.0 after 30 minutes.<br>
-	Solution 1: A mixture of 1M hydrochloric acid and 500 kU<br>
Pepsin per litre (Sigma Product No P7012; Activity: 2,500-<br>
15     3,500 units per mg protein).<br>
-	Solution 2: An artificial gastric juice mixture<br>
consisting of the following salts (per litre); 0.22g CaCl2,<br>
2.2g KC1, 5g NaCl, 1.5g NaHCO3.<br>
4.	After the pH in point 2 is reached, 110ml of the edible<br>
20   composition is removed and the viscosity measured using a<br>
Physica UDS 200 rheometer having a measuring cup of 24.4 mm radius and a roughened concentric cylinder having a radius of 22.5 mm and a length of 67.5 mm and an apex (available from Physica Meptechnik GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany) . The<br>
25   roughened surface prevents slip occurring during testing to provide a more accurate measurement of viscosity. Viscosity is determined by incrementally increasing the shear stress over the range 0.1-100 Pa and maintaining the temperature at 37°C using a temperature-controlled water bath. Viscosity-<br>
30   shear rate flow curves are generated for samples over<br>
approximately seven decades of shear (-10-4  to 10-3 s-1 )<br><br>

depending on properties of the edible composition. The viscosity at 0.1 s-1  and 37°C is taken from these flow curves.<br>
5	The ‘viscosity of the composition' value referred to herein is the viscosity of the composition measured according to the method in step 4. Thus the same rheological conditions are used but the composition is not subjected to the acidification step that is used to determine the gastric viscosity of the product. <br>
10<br>
Typically a meal replacement beverage has a viscosity before consumption (i.e. ‘viscosity of the composition') in the range<br>
of from 0.005 to 0.5 at 0.1 s-1 and 37°C.<br>
15 The edible compositions of the invention are liquid or spoonable compositions which when consumed thicken in the stomach due to the acidic pH therein.<br>
The gastric viscosity of the edible composition should be <br>
20 greater than viscosity of the composition. This means that the<br>
composition increases in viscosity at 0.1 s-1  at 37°C when<br>
undergoing acidification as would occur in the stomach upon consumption of the composition.  This increase in viscosity to within the limits according to the present invention has been<br>
25 found to give good satiety benefits.<br>

Satiety and consumption of the composition<br>
Consuming a composition according to the invention is intended to enhance and/or prolong the feeling of satiety for the consumer and/or extend the time interval between meals and/or<br>
5  reduce the amount of calories consumed in the following meal. This in turn aids the individual concerned to better adhere to a weight loss or weight control plan.<br>
The consumption of a composition according to the invention may occur as a part of a dietary plan, such as those to reduce or <br>
10 control body weight.<br>
The edible composition of	the present invention may be consumed<br>
as desired.  Preferably a	composition is consumed at least<br>
daily in order to provide	advantageous satiety effects, more<br>
15  preferably at least twice	daily.<br>
The food composition may be consumed by a human or an animal in connection with any one or more of the following; the treatment or prevention of obesity or being overweight; to improve or<br>
20 maintain the perception of body image; aiding compliance with a dietary plan e.g. to control, reduce or maintain body weight, including maintenance of desired body weight following previous weight loss; to extend the time elapsed between taking meals; to control, maintain or reduce daily calorie intake; to<br>
25 suppress appetite. The subject following that plan may be thus better able to reduce, control or maintain their body weight, e.g. by following the dietary plan for a longer period of time and/or adhering more closely to the plan as they feel less temptation to snack or over-eat.<br>
30<br>
The term "weight control or weight loss plan' as used herein includes regimes, plans and diets followed for controlling body weight and also those followed for medical reasons e.g. to<br><br>

10 Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
1.75% Protanal LF5/60TM  (alginate with an L-guluronic acid <br>
15 	content of 69 % and a weight average molecular weight of 1.0-1.2 x 105 , available from FMC Biopolymer) was added to a commercially available meal replacement beverage (US Slim*Fast™ Chocolate Royale Ready-to-drink beverage, purchased in cans from the same batch) by the method given below, such that 325ml<br>
20 	of the beverage contained 5.69g of the alginate. The meal replacement beverage comprised about 6.6g of protein.<br>
The cans were shaken, opened and weighed and brought over in a Wolff food processor. The alginate, lactulose (5g, added for<br>
25 intestinal transit time calculation) and tricalcium phosphate (10% wt based on the weight of alginate) were blended and mixed in at a speed of 1500 rpm for 2 minutes at ambient temperature. The mixture was then vacuumed and mixed for a further 5 minutes. The Wolff jacket was heated with steam until the<br>
30 content was at 60°C and mixed at this temperature for 15 minutes at 1500 rpm.  The mixture was then poured in a UHT plant premix tank and slowly stirred during further processing. UHT processing was carried out by heating to 78-85 °C, sterilisation<br><br>

at 140 °C for 9 seconds and cooling to 9 °C in two steps without a homogenisation step.  The drink was then filled in aseptic transparent bags containing approximately 1.0-1.5 kg. The sample bags were then stored at 5-7 °C until use. <br>
5<br>
The gel strength of the edible composition was determined according to the gel strength test defined above in the detailed description.  The gel strength at 37°C and pH 2 was 16 KPa.<br>
10<br>
The Protanal was determined to be present in the polysaccharide continuous phase of the composition by Confocal Microscopy and Raman Spectroscopy.  The amount of Protanal in the polysaccharide continuous phase was estimated by Confocal<br>
     15 	Scanning Laser Microscopy (CSLM) using suitable image analysis software, as is readily available, to be about 4.05%wt, based on the weight of the polysaccharide continuous phase.<br>
The satiety effect of the edible composition was tested upon 25 <br>
20 	human volunteers using the following test conditions. The<br>
volunteers entered the study centre at 11.30am, after consuming a standard breakfast at their own home.  The edible composition was consumed at 12:00 and satiety was determined before consumption and for five hours following consumption of <br>
25        25	the test meal. A VARS (Visual Analogue Rating Scale) questionnaire was used in order to determine a number of satiety parameters (fullness, hunger, appetite).<br><br>
A control test meal was also consumed by the same volunteers on <br>
30 	a different day.  The control test meal was the same<br>
commercially available meal replacement beverage but without the added alginate and tricalcium phosphate. The gastric viscosity of the control test meal was determined according to<br><br>
WO 2005/020719<br><br>
PCT7EP2004/009300<br><br>
37<br>
the gastric viscosity test defined above in the detailed description. The gel strength of the control meal at 37°C and pH 2 was approximately 370 Pa.<br>
