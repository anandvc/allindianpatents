				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication system, and in<br>
particular, to an interlaced rate control (IRC) method and apparatus for efficiently<br>
controlling reverse traffic.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Generally, in a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) mobile communication system,<br>
multimedia service is supported using the same frequency band. Mobile stations<br>
simultaneously transmit data to a base station, and identification of the mobile stations<br>
is achieved through spreading codes uniquely assigned to the mobile stations.<br>
Reverse data transmission from a mobile station to a base is performed over a reverse<br>
packet data channel (R-PDCH) by the physical layer pocket (PLP), and a packet length is<br>
fixed. A data rate is variable for each packet, and a data rate of each packet is<br>
controlled depending on a power of a mobile station transmitting the corresponding<br>
packet, a total amount of transmission data, and a rate control bit (RCB) provided from<br>
a base station over a forward rate control channel (RCCH).<br>
A base station determines reverse rates of mobile stations using Rise over Thermal<br>
(RoT), which is a ratio of the total reception power to thermal noises, or a load obtained<br>
from signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of mobile stations in service. When RoT is used, a<br>
reverse rate of a mobile station is controlled so that RoT of the corresponding mobile<br>
station approaches a reference RoT, and when RoT is unavailable, a reverse rate of a<br>
mobile station is controlled so that a load of the corresponding mobile station<br>
approaches a reference load. That is, a base station determines whether to increase,<br>
decrease, or hold a data rate of each mobile station based on the RoTs of all mobile<br>
stations in service, the total amount of transmission data, and power status. If the rate<br>
of a mobile station is efficiently controlled, throughput of the entire system can be<br>
increased.<br>
Information for the rate control of a mobile station determined by a base station is<br>
transmitted to the corresponding mobile station in the form of a reverse	<br><br>
control bit (RCB). If an RCB value received from a base station is '+1' indicating 'rate<br>
up', a mobile station increases a reverse rate in the next transmission interval. If the<br>
RCB value is '-1' indicating rate down', the mobile station decreases the reverse rate in<br>
the next transmission interval. If the RCB value is '0' indicating rate hold', the mobile<br>
station holds the current reverse rate in the next transmission interval.<br>
In certain systems, a base station controls a traffic-to-pilot power ratio (TPR) of a mobile<br>
station instead of controlling a data rate of the mobile station. In a conventional mobile<br>
communication system, reverse transmission of a mobile station is power-controlled by a<br>
base station. In the power control process, a mobile station directly controls power of<br>
the pilot channel according to a power control command received from a base station,<br>
and controls channels other than the pilot channel depending on the TPR, which has a<br>
fixed value. For example, if the TPR is 3dB, this indicates that a power ratio of a traffic<br>
channel to a pilot channel transmitted by a mobile station is 2:1. Therefore, a mobile<br>
station determines a power gain of the traffic channel so that the traffic channel should<br>
be two lines higher than the pilot channel in terms of power.<br>
Even for other types of channels, a gain of the corresponding channel has a fixed value<br>
compared with a gain of a pilot channel. In a method of controlling TPR by a base<br>
station, in controlling reverse transmissions by a plurality of mobile stations of a base<br>
station through scheduling, a system informs TPR allowed for each mobile station<br>
instead of directly informing the scheduled result as a data rate. Here, TPR is increased<br>
according to an increase in a data rate. For example, if a data rate is increased two<br>
times, power assigned to a traffic channel by a mobile station is increased about two<br>
times, which means TPR is doubled.<br>
In a conventional mobile communication system, a relationship between a data rate of a<br>
reverse traffic channel and TPR is previously known to a mobile station and a base<br>
station from an information table. In practice, therefore, controlling a data rate of a<br>
mobile station is equivalent to controlling a TPR of a mobile station. Herein, a<br>
description will be made of only a method for controlling a data rate of a mobile station<br>
by a base station.<br>
Figure 1 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of determining a reverse rate by a mobile<br>
station according to the prior art. The mobile station can support at least 9.6 Kbps, 19.2<br>
Kbps, 38.4 Kbps, 76.8 Kbps, 153.6 Kbps, and 307.2 Kbps for R-PDCH, and increases,<br>
decreases, or holds a reverse rate step by step	<br><br>
according to a rate control bit (RCB).<br>
Referring to Figure 1, in step 110, a mobile station receives a rate control bit (RCB) and<br>
analyzes the received rate control bit. In step 120, the mobile station determines<br>
whether a value of the rate control bit indicates rate up'. If a value of the rate control<br>
bit is '+1', indicating rate up' in step 130, the mobile station sets a rate to be used in<br>
the next time interval to a value (or rate) increased one step higher than a rate for the<br>
current time interval, and then proceeds to step 170.<br>
However, if a value of the rate control bit is not '+1', indicating rate up', the mobile<br>
station determines in step 140 whether a value of the rate control bit indicates rate<br>
down'. If it is determined that a value of the rate control bit is '-1', indicating rate<br>
down', in step 150, the mobile station sets a rate to be used in the next time interval to<br>
a value decreased one step lower than a rate for the current time interval, and the<br>
proceeds to step 170.<br>
However, if it determined that a value of the rate control bit is not '-1', indicating rate<br>
down', in step 160, the mobile station sets a rate to be used in the next time interval to<br>
the same value as a rate for the current time interval. In step 170, the mobile station<br>
transmits a data frame in the next time interval according to the determined rate.<br>
Figure 2 is a timing diagram illustrating an operation of determining a reverse rate by a<br>
mobile station according to the prior art. The RCB is transmitted one time from a base<br>
station to a mobile station for each transmission interval. The RCB is used to control a<br>
reverse rate of R-PDCH for the next transmission interval of a mobile station.<br>
Referring to figure 2, in a time interval t0, a mobile station transmits a data frame over<br>
a packet data channel (PDCH) at a rate of 9.6 Kbps (see 210). In the time interval t1, a<br>
base station determines whether to increase, decrease, or hold a data rate of a mobile<br>
station in consideration of an RoT, a buffer status, and a power status of the<br>
corresponding mobile station, generates an RCB according to the determination result,<br>
and transmits the generated RCB to the mobile station (see 220). Then the mobile<br>
station receives the RCB, analyzes the RCB, and determines whether to increase,<br>
decrease, or hold a rate of PDCH in the next time interval t2.<br><br>
However, in such a rate control method, due to a delay between a time where RCB is<br>
generated in a base station and a time where the RCB is actually applied in a mobile<br>
station, a base station cannot efficiently perform rate control on its mobile stations.<br>
For example, in a time interval t5, a base station receives a data frame from a mobile<br>
station at a rate of 153.6 Kbps, and in the same time interval, the base station<br>
determines to increase a data rate of the mobile station by one step from the current<br>
rate of 153.6 Kbps according to conditions of other mobile stations, generates a<br>
corresponding RCB(+), and transmits the generated RCB(+) to the mobile station.<br>
Actually, however, however, because the RCB(+) is transmitted for a time interval t6, a<br>
time interval where the RCB(+) is actually applied becomes t7 taking into account a time<br>
required when the mobile station receives the RCB(+) and analyzes the RCB(+). As a<br>
result, in the time interval t7, the mobile station sets a rate 614.4 Kbps, which is<br>
increased one step higher than a rate 307.2 Kbps for the previous time interval t6.<br>
When several mobile stations simultaneously transmit reverse data, data transmitted by<br>
other mobile stations acts as interference to a signal of a particular mobile station.<br>
Therefore, a base station performs a control operation in such a manner that all rates or<br>
all RoT values of data transmitted by mobile stations in the cell should not exceed a<br>
particular threshold. In this case, when the base station increases a data rate of a<br>
particular mobile station, the based station must decrease data rates of the other base<br>
stations. Accordingly, data throughputs of mobile stations receiving a data service from<br>
a particular base station depend upon the efficiency of the reverse rate control.<br>
However, as illustrated in Figure 2, a mobile station determines whether to increase,<br>
decease, or hold a next data rate in comparison with a data rate used in the previous<br>
time interval, depending on an RCB received from a base station. In this case, due to a<br>
delay between a time when the RCB is generated in a base station and a time when the<br>
RCB is actually applied in a mobile station, reverse rate control cannot be efficiently<br>
performed, leading to deterioration in data throughput of the entire system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described in detail herein below with reference to the annexed drawings. In the<br>
following description, a detailed description of known functions and<br>
configurations incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The present invention is directed to controlling a reverse data rate using a<br>
rate control bit (RCB), wherein a mobile communication system determines a<br>
reference time where a base station generates an RCB and a mobile station<br>
applies the RCB, taking a predetermined delay time into consideration. Herein,<br>
the "delay time" is referred to as "rate control delay (RCD)." Rate control based<br>
on the RCD is also expressed as rate control based on ACID (ARQ (Automatic<br>
Repeat reQuest) Channel Indicator). That is, in determining a data rate of a<br>
mobile station, an RCB is analyzed on the basis of a rate of packet data<br>
corresponding to a previous ACID and then a rate of transmission packet data<br>
corresponding to the same ACID is determined.<br>
In addition, a method of controlling a data rate of a mobile station is<br>
actually equivalent to a method of controlling a TPR of a mobile station.<br><br>
Therefore, a description will be made of only the method for controlling a data<br>
rate of a mobile station by a base station. However, the method of controlling the<br>
TPR can also be applied to the rate control method proposed in the present<br>
invention.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating an apparatus for controlling a<br>
reverse rate according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in<br>
FIG. 3, the rate control apparatus comprises a forward rate control channel (F-<br>
RCCH) receiver 10, a controller 20, and a reverse packet data channel (R-PDCH)<br>
transmitter 30. For each time interval, the F-RCCH receiver 10 receives an RCB<br>
by performing despreading, demodulation, and decoding on a signal received<br>
from a base station using a spreading code assigned to F-RCCH, and provides the<br>
received RCB to the controller 20.<br>
The controller 20 analyzes a value of the RCB to determine whether a<br>
base station is requiring an increase in a reverse rate or a decrease in a reverse<br>
rate, and determines a new reverse rate according to the determination result.<br>
Then the R-PDCH transmitter 30 transmits a data frame according to the<br>
determined data rate, under the control of the controller 20. Here, the RCB is not<br>
a value determined by matching a rate for the next time interval to a previous time<br>
interval, but a value determined by matching the rate for the next time interval to<br>
a time interval that goes a predetermined rate control delay (RCD) ahead of the<br>
current time interval.<br>
More specifically, assuming that a mobile station transmits one data<br>
frame for each time interval, the RCD is a delay from a time where an i* frame is<br>
transmitted when RCB determined based on the ith frame is received. The RCD is<br>
determined by an agreement between a base station and a mobile station when the<br>
base station and the mobile station initiate communication with each other.<br>
Alternatively, the RCD can be determined by a mobile station. In another case,<br>
the RCD can be determined by a base station and then notified to a mobile station.<br>
In yet another case, the RCD can be previously determined between a base station<br>
and a mobile station.<br>
Accordingly, upon receiving an ith frame, a base station generates an RCB<br>
based on the received ith frame, and transmits the generated RCB over the R-<br>
RCCH. The mobile station receives the RCB, determines a rate of the next frame<br>
according to a rate of the ith frame, and transmits the next frame at the determined<br>
rate.<br><br>
As mentioned above, a rate is also controlled based on an ACID. Let's<br>
assume that a mobile station sequentially transmits packet data corresponding to<br>
ACIDs having values of 00, 01, 10 and 11 for 4 different time intervals. In this<br>
case, assuming that a rate of current packet data corresponding to ACID=00 is<br>
19.2 Kbps and an RCB(+) is received, the mobile station can transmit the next<br>
packet data corresponding to ACID=00 at 38.4 Kbps. That is, in determining a<br>
rate of current transmission packet data, the mobile station determines a rate of<br>
the next transmission packet data based on a rate of previous packet data<br>
corresponding to the same ACID.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of determining a reverse<br>
rate by a mobile station according to an embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
mobile station supports at least 9.6 Kbps, 19.2 Kbps, 38.4 Kbps, 76.8 Kbps, 153.6<br>
Kbps, and 307.2 Kbps for R-PDCH, and increases, decreases, or holds a reverse<br>
rate step by step according to a rate control bit (RCB).<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, in step 310, a mobile station receives and analyzes a<br>
rate control bit (RCB) for an nth time interval. In step 320, the mobile station<br>
determines whether a value of the RCB indicates 'rate up'. If a value of the rate<br>
control bit is '+1', indicating 'rate up', in step 330, the mobile station sets a rate<br>
R(n+1) to be used in the next time interval 'n+1' to a value (or rate), which is<br>
increased one step higher than a rate R(n-RCD) for a time interval occurring a<br>
predetermined RCD ahead of the current time interval, and then proceeds to step<br>
370. This can be expressed as shown below in Equation 1.<br><br>
If it is determined in step 320 that a value of the RCB is not '+1',<br>
indicating 'rate up', in step 340, the mobile station determines whether a value of<br>
the RCB indicates 'rate down'. If it is determined that a value of the RCB is '-1',<br>
indicating 'rate down', in step 350, the mobile station sets a rate R(n+1) to be<br>
used in the next time interval 'n+1' to a value which is decreased one step lower<br>
than a rate R(n-RCD) for a time interval occurring a predetermined RCD ahead<br>
of the current time interval, and then proceeds to step 370. This can be expressed<br>
as shown below in Equation 2.<br><br>
If it is determined in step 340 that a value of the RCB is not '-1',<br><br>
indicating 'rate down', in step 360, the mobile station sets a rate R(n+1) to be<br>
used in the next time interval 'n+1' to the same value as a rate R(n-RCD) for a<br>
time interval occurring a predetermined RCD ahead of the current time interval.<br>
This can be expressed as shown below in Equation 3.<br><br>
In step 370, the mobile station transmits a data frame in the next time<br>
interval 'n+F according to the determined rate R(n+1).<br>
In the present invention, a rate control delay (RCD) is a time required<br>
when a mobile station transmits one frame in a reverse direction considering a<br>
processing delay in a base station and a mobile station. Thereafter, a base station<br>
transmits an RCB in a forward direction, and the mobile station receives the RCB<br>
and applies the received RCB to a data rate of the next frame. The RCD is<br>
designated by the frame. For example, the RCD can be set with one or two frames.<br>
FIG. 5 is a timing diagram illustrating an operation of determining a<br>
reverse rate by a mobile station for RCD = 1 frame (or 1 time interval) according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5, in a time interval<br>
tO, a mobile station transmits a data frame over PDCH at a rate of 9.6 Kbps (see<br>
410). For a time interval tl, a base station determines whether to increase,<br>
decrease, or hold a data rate of the mobile station based on an RoT, a buffer status,<br>
and a power status of the mobile station, generates an RCB according to the<br>
determination result, and transmits the generated RCB (see 420).<br>
The RCB is received at the mobile station in the time interval tl, and the<br>
mobile station determines a data rate to be applied in a time interval t2 according<br>
to the received RCB. In determining a data rate to be applied in the time interval<br>
t2, the mobile station determines the data rate not based on a rate for a previous<br>
time interval tl, but based on a rate for a time interval tO that occurs a<br>
predetermined RCD, or one frame, ahead of the current time interval. Such rate<br>
control is called "interlaced rate control" because rate control is separately<br>
performed on even-numbered frames and odd-numbered frames as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 5.<br>
For example, a mobile station uses a rate of 9.6 Kbps in a time interval tl.<br>
A base station determines to increase a rate of the mobile station according to<br>
status information of mobile stations in the time interval tl, generates RCB(+)<br><br>
according to the determination result, and transmits the generated RCB(+) to the<br>
mobile station. The RCB(+) is received at the mobile station in a time interval t2,<br>
and based on the received RCB(+), the mobile station sets a rate to be used in a<br>
time interval t3 to a rate 19.2 Kbps, which is increased one step higher than a rate<br>
9.6 Kbps for the time interval tl, i.e., a time interval that occurs an RCD ahead of<br>
the current time interval.<br>
As another example, a mobile station uses a rate of 38.4 Kbps in a time<br>
interval t5. A base station determines to increase a rate of the mobile station<br>
according to status information of mobile stations in the time interval t5,<br>
generates RCB(+) according to the determination result, and transmits the<br>
generated RCB(+) to the mobile station. The RCB(+) is received at the mobile<br>
station in a time interval t6, and based on the received RCB(+), the mobile station<br>
sets a rate to be used in a time interval t7 to a rate 76.8 Kbps, which is increased<br>
one step higher than a rate 38.4 Kbps for the time interval t5, i.e., a time interval<br>
that occurs an RCD ahead of the current time interval.<br>
FIG. 6 is a timing diagram illustrating an operation of determining a<br>
reverse rate by a mobile station for RCD = 2 frames (or 2 time intervals)<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, in a<br>
time interval tO, a mobile station transmits a data frame over PDCH at a rate of<br>
9.6 Kbps (see 510). For a time interval tl, a base station determines whether to<br>
increase, decrease, or hold a data rate of the mobile station based on an RoT, a<br>
buffer status, and a power status of the mobile station, generates an RCB<br>
according to the determination result, and transmits the generated RCB (see 520).<br>
The RCB is received at the mobile station in a time interval t2, and the<br>
mobile station determines a data rate to be applied in a time interval t3 according<br>
to the received RCB. In determining a data rate to be applied in the time interval<br>
t3, the mobile station determines the data rate not based on a rate for a previous<br>
time interval t2, but based on a rate for a time interval tO that occurs a<br>
predetermined RCD, or 2 frames, ahead of the current time interval.<br>
For example, a mobile station uses a rate of 9.6 Kbps in a time interval tl.<br>
A base station determines to increase a rate of the mobile station according to<br>
status information of mobile stations in the time interval tl, generates RCB(+)<br>
according to the determination result, and transmits the generated RCB(+) to the<br>
mobile station. The RCB(+) is received at the mobile station in a time interval t3,<br>
and based on the received RCB(+), the mobile station sets a rate to be used in a<br><br>
time interval t4 to a rate 19.2 Kbps, which is increased one step higher than a rate<br>
9.6 Kbps for the time interval tl, i.e., a time interval that occurs an RCD ahead of<br>
the current time interval.<br>
As another example, a mobile station uses a rate of 38.4 Kbps in a time<br>
interval t5. A base station determines to decrease a rate of the mobile station<br>
according to status information of mobile stations in the time interval t5,<br>
generates RCB(-) according to the determination result, and transmits the<br>
generated RCB(-) to the mobile station. The RCB(-) is received at the mobile<br>
station in a time interval t7, and based on the received RCB(-), the mobile station<br>
sets a rate to be used in a time interval t8 to a rate 19.2 Kbps, which is decreased<br>
one step lower man a rate 38.4 Kbps for the time interval t5, i.e., a time interval<br>
that occurs an RCD ahead of the current time interval.<br>
In FIG. 5, because the RCD = 1 frame, rate control is separately<br>
performed on two parts (even-numbered frames and odd-numbered frames). In<br>
FIG. 6, because the RCD = 2 frames, rate control is separately performed on three<br>
parts (first frames, second frames, and third frames.<br>
In the interlaced rate control method according to the present invention, a<br>
mobile station applies information for an increase (+), a decrease (-), or a hold (0)<br>
to an RCB, based on a rate used when a base station generates the RCB, so a<br>
reverse rate control error caused by a delay between a base station and a mobile<br>
station is removed. Therefore, using the interlaced rate control method, a mobile<br>
station accurately applies a rate calculated during scheduling by a base station,<br>
thereby efficiently controlling reverse rates of mobile stations.<br>
In order to describe an operation of determining a reverse rate of<br>
a mobile station by applying the interlaced rate control method in a system using<br>
energy reduction technology, it is necessary to first describe Hybrid Automatic<br>
Retransmission Request (HARQ) technology.<br>
The HARQ technology is commonly used to increase reverse throughput<br>
in a mobile communication system for wireless packet supporting a multimedia<br>
service. HARQ technology is technology performed on a physical layer packet.<br>
An operation of transmitting a frame in a reverse direction using such HARQ<br>
technology will now be described herein below.<br>
A base station informs a mobile station whether a physical layer packet is<br><br>
successfully received, through a forward acknowledgement (ACK) channel in<br>
response to the physical layer packet received from the mobile station. If physical<br>
layer packet is successfully received, the base station transmits an ACK signal<br>
indicating successful receipt of the physical layer packet over an ACK channel.<br>
However, if reception of physical layer packet is failed, the base station transmits<br>
a negative acknowledgement (NAK) signal indicating reception failure of the<br>
physical layer packet over the ACK channel. The mobile station analyzes a signal<br>
received over the ACK channel to determine whether the physical layer packet<br>
has been successfully transmitted. If an ACK signal is received, the mobile station<br>
transmits a new packet, and if a NAK signal is received, the mobile station<br>
retransmits the previously transmitted packet.<br>
If decoding of a packet previously received from the mobile station is<br>
failed, the base station combines the retransmitted packet with the previously<br>
received packet before attempting to decode, thereby contributing to an increase<br>
in a decoding success rate.<br>
In a system using HARQ technology, a mobile station uses energy<br>
reduction technology in order to determine a reverse rate. In the energy reduction<br>
technology, when a mobile station attempts retransmission upon receipt of a NAK<br>
signal from a base station after performing initial transmission in a system using<br>
HARQ technology, energy of the retransmitted packet is set to a lower value than<br>
that of the initially transmitted packet. That is, in this technology, a traffic channel<br>
for the retransmitted packet has a lower gain than the initially transmitted packet.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a base station in a system<br>
employing HARQ technology and energy reduction technology according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 8 is a timing diagram<br>
illustrating an operation of determining a reverse rate by a mobile station in a<br>
system employing HARQ technology and energy reduction technology according<br>
to another embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 8, the height of a packet<br>
data channel denotes a channel gain.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 7 and 8, if a mobile station transmits a packet over<br>
PDCH for a time interval tO, in step 700, a base station receives the packet<br>
transmitted by the mobile station over the PDCH and attempts demodulation on<br>
the received packet. In step 710, the base station determines whether<br>
demodulation of the packet is successful. If it is determined that the demodulation<br><br>
is successful, in step 715, the base station transmits an ACK signal to the mobile<br>
station over an ACK channel in order to receive the next packet. Simultaneously,<br>
the base station transmits an RCB or a traffic-to-pilot ratio control bit (TPRCB).<br>
However, if it is determined that the demodulation has failed, in step 720,<br>
the base station transmits a NAK signal 701 to the mobile station over an ACK<br>
channel. At this time, the base station does not transmit RCB 702 because a data<br>
rate for a retransmission packet is not different from a data rate for an initially<br>
transmitted packet and TPR control is unnecessary.<br>
Upon receiving the NAK signal 701, the mobile station attempts<br>
retransmission for a time interval t2. At this point, as illustrated in FIG. 8, a packet<br>
retransmitted over PDCH for the time interval t2 is applied the energy reduction<br>
technology. Therefore, RCB 702 is not received from the base station, and the<br>
retransmitted packet is lower in energy than a packet initially transmitted for the<br>
time interval tO. Transmission energy of the retransmitted packet can be reduced<br>
to 1/2 or 1/4 compared with that of the initially transmitted packet.<br>
In step 730, the base station receives the retransmitted packet from the<br>
mobile station over PDCH for the time interval t2. In step 740, the base station<br>
combines the initially transmitted packet received for the time interval tO, i.e., a<br>
packet received for a time interval that occurs two RCDs ahead of the current<br>
time interval, with the currently retransmitted packet and demodulates the<br>
combined packet. Thereafter, in step 750, the base station determines whether the<br>
demodulation is successfully achieved. If it is determined that the demodulation<br>
has failed, the base station transmits a NAK signal in step 755, and then returns to<br>
step 730 to receive the retransmitted packet.<br>
For the convenience of explanation, in FIG. 7, the base station continues<br>
to wait for a retransmitted packet when it transmits a NAK signal in step 755.<br>
Actually, however, the base station stops retransmission when the number of<br>
retransmissions exceeds a predetermined retransmission number. Preferably, the<br>
predetermined retransmission number is set to 3 or lower, including the initial<br>
transmission.<br>
If it is determined in step 750 that the retransmitted packet is successfully<br>
demodulated, in step 760, the base station, although not illustrated in FIG. 8,<br>
transmits an ACK signal for the time interval t2 to inform the mobile station that<br>
the packet has been successfully received. At the same time, the base station<br><br>
transmits RCB 702 in order to control a rate or TPR of the mobile station.<br>
A description will now be made of an operation of controlling a reverse<br>
rate or TPR by a mobile station in a system employing HARQ technology and<br>
energy reduction technology. It should be noted that the operation is identical in<br>
principle to the operation described in connection with FIGs. 5 and 6.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 8, upon receiving RCB 702, a mobile station<br>
determines whether to increase, decrease, or hold a data rate or TPR according to<br>
a command of the RCB 702. The mobile station controls a rate or TPR of a packet<br>
to be transmitted for a time interval t4, based on information on rate<br>
up/down/hold for a packet transmitted for a time interval t2. Because an RCD<br>
corresponds to two time intervals as illustrated in FIG. 5, the mobile station<br>
follows the operation described in connection with FIG. 5. Therefore, a detailed<br>
description thereof will be omitted for simplicity. In this case, an operation of<br>
controlling a reverse rate by a mobile station is identical to the operation<br>
described in connection with FIG. 4.<br>
However, in an alternative method, a mobile station can control a rate or<br>
TPR of a packet to be transmitted for a time interval t4 based on information on<br>
up/down/hold for a packet transmitted for a time interval tO. Here, when the<br>
mobile station controls a rate or TPR of a packet to be transmitted for a time<br>
interval t4 based on information on up/down/hold for a packet transmitted for a<br>
time interval tO, such an operation should not violate an operational principle of<br>
the embodiment described in connection with FIGs. 5 and 6. More specifically,<br>
because the energy reduction technology is used, gains of respective packet data<br>
channels are set to different values, but packets transmitted for time intervals tO<br>
and t2 by the mobile station have the same rate. Therefore, based on a rate for the<br>
packet transmitted for the time interval tO, a rate for the time interval t4 is<br>
increased according to RCB(+) 702.<br>
In a system not employing the energy reduction technology, a mobile<br>
station, based on the method proposed by the present invention, always increases,<br>
decreases, or holds a rate based on a packet transmitted for a time interval that<br>
occurs an RCD head of the current time interval.<br>
In addition, although a base station transmits a TPRCB, a mobile station<br>
increases, decreases, or holds a rate of a packet to be currently transmitted not<br>
based on a rate caused by TPR during retransmission for a time interval t2, but<br><br>
based on a rate caused by TPR during initial transmission for a time interval tO.<br>
A method for transmitting a current packet data frame using an ACID can<br>
be expressed as shown below in Equation 4.<br>
FIG. 9 is a diagram for explaining a method for controlling a TPR for<br>
each HARQ channel according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In a common HARQ operation, there are several HARQ channels and<br>
each HARQ channel is identified by an ARQ Channel Identifier (ACID). For<br>
example, if there are 4 HARQ channels, the HARQ channels corresponds to<br>
ACID=0, ACID=1, ACID=2 and ACID=3, respectively, and an HARQ operation<br>
is independently performed for each ACID. Though the specification describes<br>
the HARQ channel as a different channel by seperating each ACID, the HARQ<br>
channel can be each different frame of one packet data channel.<br>
For better understanding, an operation of a conventional HARQ system<br>
using a frame length of 10 ms will be described in detail herein below.<br>
A mobile station transmits initial transmission packets over a series of<br>
HARQ channels beginning at a particular start time t=0. That is, at t=0, the<br>
mobile station transmits initial transmission packet data over an ACID=0 HARQ<br>
channel which is a first HARQ channel. At t=10 ms, the mobile station transmits<br>
initial transmission packet data over an ACID=1 HARQ channel which is a<br>
second HARQ channel. At t=20 ms, the mobile station transmits initial<br>
transmission packet data over an ACID=2 HARQ channel which is a third HARQ<br>
channel. At t=30 ms, the mobile station transmits initial transmission packet data<br>
over an ACID=3 HARQ channel which is a fourth HARQ channel.<br>
The mobile station receives ACK or NAK from a base station in response<br>
to the initial transmission packet transmitted over the ACID=0 HARQ channel,<br>
and if NAK is received, the mobile station performs retransmission through the<br>
ACID=0 HARQ channel at t=40 ms. If NAK is received from the base station in<br>
response to the initial transmission packet transmitted over ACID=1 HARQ<br>
channel, the mobile station retransmits the packet over the ACID=1 HARQ<br>
channel at t=50 ms.<br>
As stated above, a common HARQ operation is performed using several<br>
HARQ channels. The interlaced rate control method proposed in the present<br>
invention is equivalent to controlling a rate of a mobile station or a TPR of a<br>
mobile station for each HARQ channel, or ACID, in the HARQ operation.<br>
Because in the HARQ operation, a rate control delay (RCD) is defined by<br>
a time period between HARQ channels corresponding to the same ACID,<br>
controlling a rate or a TPR for each HARQ channel corresponding to the same<br>
ACID is equivalent to controlling a rate for a time interval occurring a RCD<br><br>
ahead of a current time interval according to a received rate control bit (RCB).<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a procedure for controlling a TPR for each HARQ<br>
channel, or ACID, as described above. For example, in FIG. 9, the number of<br>
HARQ channels is 4. Therefore, as illustrated in FIG. 9, ACID=0, 1, 2, and 3. For<br>
the convenience of explanation, in an example of FIG. 9, response signals such as<br>
ACK or NAK for supporting HARQ are omitted. Although the ACK or NAK is<br>
applied, the rate control operation of FIG. 9 is performed in the same manner<br>
except that a retransmission packet is transmitted in response to NAK.<br>
In order to perform a TPR control operation for each HARQ channel, or<br>
ACID, as described in connection with FIG. 9, the mobile station can use an<br>
internal parameter authorizedtpr. The authorizedtpr refers to a parameter<br>
managed by the mobile station to update its maximum TPR value allowed by the<br>
base station in order to control its own rate, and this is updated for each ACID.<br>
Therefore, in this example, the authorized_tpr becomes arrangement size of 4 as<br>
authorized_tpr[4]. Here, authorized_tpr[0] is used for TPR control by a mobile<br>
station for ACID=0 HARQ channel; authorized_tpr[l] is used for TPR control by<br>
a mobile station for ACID=1 HARQ channel; authorized_tpr[2] is used for TPR<br>
control by a mobile station for ACID=2 HARQ channel; and authorized_tpr[3] is<br>
used for TPR control by a mobile station for ACID=3 HARQ channel.<br>
In FIG. 9, reference numeral 901 denotes a series of TPRCBs transmitted<br>
from a base station to a mobile station, and reference numeral 902 denotes a<br>
series of R-PDCHs transmitted in a reverse direction by a mobile station. Further,<br>
numerals 19.2 and 38.4 denote data rates in a unit of Kbps. Moreover, in FIG. 9,<br>
reference numeral 903 denotes an identifier for passage of a time in a unit of 10<br>
ms, and reference numeral 904 denotes ACID which is an identifier for each<br>
HARQ channel.<br>
With reference to FIG. 9, operations of a base station and a mobile station<br>
will be described in detail.<br>
A mobile station transmits a 19.2-Kbps packet over an ACID=0 HARQ<br>
channel at t=t0. At this point, the mobile station sets a value of authorized_tpr[0]<br>
to a TPR value corresponding to 19.2 Kbps. The mobile station transmits a 38.4-<br>
Kbps packet over an ACID=1 HARQ channel at t=tl. At this point, the mobile<br>
station sets a value of authorized_tpr[l] to a TPR value corresponding to 38.4<br>
Kbps. The mobile station transmits a 38.4-Kbps packet over an AOD=2 HARQ<br>
channel at t=t2. At this point, the mobile station sets a value of authorized_tpr[2]<br>
to a TPR value corresponding to 38.4 Kbps. In addition, the mobile station<br>
receives a TPRCB indicating 'UP' from the base station at t=t2.<br>
Therefore, the mobile station updates a value of authorized_tpr[0] to a<br>
TPR value corresponding to 38.4 Kbps. Because the mobile station transmitted a<br><br>
19.2-Kbps packet over the ACID=0 HARQ channel and then received a TPRCB<br>
indicating 'UP' in response thereto, the mobile station increases authorized_tpr[0]<br>
corresponding to the same ACID by one step.<br>
The mobile station transmits a 76.8-Kbps packet over an ACID-3 HARQ<br>
channel at t=t3. At this point, the mobile station sets a value of authorized_tpr[3]<br>
to a TPR value corresponding to 76.8 Kbps.<br>
In addition, the mobile station receives a TPRCB indicating 'UP' from<br>
the base station at t=t3. Therefore, the mobile station updates a value of<br>
authorized_tpr[l] to a TPR value corresponding to 76.8 Kbps. Because the mobile<br>
station transmitted a 38.4-Kbps packet over the ACID=1 HARQ channel and then<br>
received a TPRCB indicating 'UP' in response thereto, the mobile station<br>
increases authorized_tpr[l] corresponding to the same ACID by one step.<br>
In controlling a rate or a TPR of a packet to be transmitted over an<br>
ACID=0 HARQ channel at t=t4, because a value of authorized_tpr[0] is a value<br>
corresponding to 38.4 Kbps, the mobile station can transmit a 38.4-Kbps packet.<br>
In the example of FIG. 9, the mobile station transmits a 38.4-Kbps packet. Such<br>
an operation is continuously repeated. As described above, the mobile station<br>
controls a TPR for each HARQ channel, or ACID. In addition, as shown in the<br>
example, the mobile station can control its own TPR value for each HARQ<br>
channel using the internal parameter authorized_tpr.<br>
There is a current transmission packet data frame corresponding to the<br>
same ACID among a plurality of previous transmission packet data frames and<br>
there is a rate of the corresponding packet data frame. As mentioned above, a rate<br>
of a packet data frame can be used in the same expression as a TPRCB. Here, a<br>
TPRCB allowed for a rate of a previous transmission packet data frame will be<br>
referred to as TPRCB{ACID(P)}, where P stands for 'previous'.<br>
In addition, a rate of a next transmission packet data frame will be<br>
referred to as TPRCB{ACID(N)}, where N stands for 'next'. The mobile station<br>
determines whether to increase, decrease, or hold a rate based on control<br>
information received from a base station.<br>
The foregoing description can be expressed as shown below in Equation<br>
4.<br>
TPRCB{ACID(N)} = TPRCB {ACID(P)} + Delta 	(4)<br><br>
That is, a rate of current transmission packet data is increased or<br>
decreased by Delta on the basis of a rate of a packet data frame corresponding to<br>
the same ACID among the previous transmission packet data frames. Here,<br>
"Delta" refers to a value increased or decreased base on control information<br>
received from a base station.<br>
As can be appreciated from the foregoing description, a mobile station<br>
applies an RCB based on a rate used when a base station generates the RCB,<br>
thereby preventing a reverse rate control error caused by a processing delay<br>
between the base station and the mobile station. Therefore, using the interlaced<br>
rate control method according to the present invention, a mobile station<br>
accurately applies a rate calculated during scheduling by a base station, thereby<br>
efficiently controlling reverse rates of mobile stations.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to a certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled<br>
in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
