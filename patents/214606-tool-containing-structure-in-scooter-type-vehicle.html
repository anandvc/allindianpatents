				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a tool containing device provided in a scooter type vehicle<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Techniques of this type for scooter type motorcycles have been known, for example, from Japanese Utility Model Laid-open No. Hei 3-32576 titled "Inner Box for Scooter Type Vehicle", in which as shown in Fig. 3 of this document, shelves 17, 17 (note: reference numerals are cited from this document hereinafter) are provided in a containing chamber 12 of an inner box for partitioning an internal space of the containing chamber 12 with the shelves 17, 17, whereby a tool or the like can be placed on the shelves 17, 17. [0003]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The structure disclosed in the above document, however, has a problem that a tool only placed on each shelf 17 is possibly moved, for example, by vibration caused during running of the vehicle and it strikes the inner box, leading to breakage of the inner box and/or uncomfortable noise caused by the striking of the tool to the inner box.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a tool containing structure in a scooter type vehicle, which is configured to prevent a tool contained in an inner box<br>
from being moved, for example, by vibration caused during<br>
running of the vehicle.<br>
[0004]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
To achieve the above object, according to an invention described in claim 1, there is provided a tool containing structure provided in a scooter type vehicle for containing a tool in an inner box, including: a partitioning wall defining a tool containing space in the inner box; a reinforcing rib serving as a member for restricting movement of the tool toward a wall surface of the partitioning wall, the reinforcing rib being provided on the partitioning wall; and a pressing means, provided in the containing space on an inlet side thereof, for preventing the tool from being slipped off backward. [0005]<br>
With this configuration, a partitioning wall defines a tool containing space in an inner box and a reinforcing rib provided on the partitioning wall restricts movement of a tool contained in the containing space toward a wall surface of the partitioning wall, and further a pressing means presses the tool for restricting movement of the tool in the longitudinal direction, thereby preventing the tool from being slipped off backward.<br><br>
Accordingly, the tool contained in the inner box can be restricted from being moved, for example, by vibration caused during running of the vehicle.<br>
In addition, the reinforcing rib provided on the partitioning wall, which increases the strength of the partitioning wall, prevents the partitioning wall from being curvedly deformed. Accordingly, the tool is more effectively restricted from being moved toward the wall surface of the partitioning wall.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a tool containing device provided in a scooter type vehicle for containing a tool in an inner box, characterized by:<br>
a partitioning wall defining a tool containing space in said inner box;<br>
a reinforcing rib serving as a member for restricting movement of said tool toward a wall surface of said partitioning wall, said reinforcing rib being provided on said partitioning wall;<br>
a pressing means, provided in said containing space on an inlet side thereof, for preventing said tool from being slipped off backward; and<br>
wherein optionally said partitioning wall is removably mounted in said inner box.<br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, the partitioning wall is removably mounted in the inner box.<br>
Since the partitioning wall is removably mounted in the inner box, it can be removed as needed for containing a large sized baggage and the like in the inner box.<br><br>

[0012]<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective rear view of the scooter type motorcycle of the present invention, showing a state in which a lid of the inner box is opened.<br>
The front inner cover 14 is integrated at an upper portion thereof with an inner box 40. The inner box 40 is composed of containing chambers 42, 43 positioned on both sides of a projection 41 covering the down tube 6 shown in Fig. 1, and a lid 44 for opening and closing the right and left containing chambers 42, 43.  The left containing chamber 42 includes a tool containing structure 50 of the present invention.<br>
Reference numeral 45 indicates a lock for locking the lid 44, and 46 is a key to be inserted in the lock 45. [0013]<br>
Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken on line 3-3 of Fig. 2, showing the tool containing structure 50 of the present invention as seen from the side surface thereof.<br>
The tool containing structure 50 is composed of a partitioning wall 53 mounted in the left containing chamber 42 for defining a containing space 52 for containing a tool 51 (see Fig. 4); upper and lower guide rails 54, 55 for<br>
removably mounting the partitioning wall 53 in the left containing chamber 42; a reinforcing rib 56 for reinforcing the partitioning wall 53 while serving as a member for restricting vertical movement of the tool 51; and a pressing means 60 provided in the containing space 52 on an inlet 52a side for preventing the tool 51 from being slipped off backward. [0014]<br>
The upper guide rail 54 has an upper groove 54a in an upper wall 40a of the inner box 40 (see Fig. 5), and the lower guide rail 55 has a lower groove 55a formed in a lower wall 4 Ob of the inner box 40 (see Fig. 5).<br>
The reinforcing rib 56 is composed of upper and lower horizontal ribs 57a, 57b extending along the upper and lower walls 40a, 40b of the inner box 40, and vertical ribs 58 extending perpendicularly to the upper and lower horizontal ribs 57a, 57b.  An intermediate portion 58a (between the upper horizontal rib 57a and the lower horizontal rib 57b) of each vertical rib 58 is lower in height than the other portions of the vertical rib 58 (see Fig. 4). [0015]<br>
Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken on line 4-4 of Fig. 2, in which an imaginary line indicates the tool 51.<br>
The pressing means 60 is composed of locking pieces 61, 61 (only the upper locking piece 61 is shown in Fig. 3) formed at the rear end portion of the partitioning wall 53, a hook 63 mounted on the projection 41 of the inner box 40 via a vis 62, and an endless pressing rubber member 64 locked with the locking pieces 61, 61 and the hook 63.<br>
Reference numeral 53a indicates a peripheral edge rib provided around the peripheral edge of the partitioning wall 53, and 65 is a vis for fixing the partitioning wall 53. [0016]<br>
Hereinafter, a procedure for mounting the tool containing structure of the present invention will be described in association with the function of the tool containing structure.<br>
Fig. 5 is a view illustrating the mounting procedure of the tool containing structure of the present invention.<br>
The pressing rubber member 64 is first mounted on the locking pieces 61, 16.  Next, an upper side 53b and a lower side 53c of the partitioning wall 53 are respectively inserted in the upper groove 54a of the upper guide rail 54 and the lower groove 55a of the lower guide rail 55 and pressed in the direction shown by a white arrow .  Then,<br>
the vis 65 is moved in the direction shown by an arrow ® to be inserted in a hole 40c of the inner box 40, and is screwed with a leading end portion of the partitioning wall 53. The partitioning wall 53 is thus mounted in the inner box 40, to form the containing space 52. [0017]<br>
Subsequently, the tool 51 (including a first T-type tube spanner 5la, a second T-type tube spanner 51b, and a driver 51c) is moved in the direction shown by an arrow ®, to be inserted between the upper horizontal rib 57a and the lower horizontal rib 57b.  The pressing rubber 64 is then locked with the hook 63 (see Fig. 4).  Thus, as shown in Fig. 4, the pressing rubber 64 is brought in contact with the first T-type tube spanner 5la and the second T-type tube spanner 51b, so that the first T-type tube spanner 51a and the second T-type tube spanner 51b are pressed in the containing space 52. [0018]<br>
In this way, by pressing the tool 51 with the pressing rubber 64, longitudinal movement of the tool 51 is restricted.  As a result, the tool 51 is prevented from being slipped off backward.  The tool 51 is also restricted from being moved toward the wall surface of the partitioning wall 53 with the aid of the partitioning wall<br><br>
53 and the upper and lower horizontal ribs 57a and 57b provided on the partitioning wall 53. Accordingly, the tool 51 contained in the containing space 52 can be restricted from being moved, for example, by vibration caused during running of the vehicle.<br>
The reinforcing rib 56 provided on the partitioning wall 53, which increases the strength of the partitioning wall 53, prevents the partitioning wall 53 from being curvedly deformed. This makes it possible to more effectively restrict the movement of the tool 51 toward the wall surface of the partitioning wall 53. [0019]<br>
Since the partitioning wall 53 can be removed from the inner box 40, a large sized baggage or the like can be contained in the left containing chamber 42 after removal of the partitioning wall 53 from the inner box 40 (see Fig. 2).<br>
The partitioning wall may be provided in the horizontal direction, and the reinforcing rib may be extended in the vertical direction. [0020]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention having the above-described configuration has the following effects.<br><br>
According to the invention described in claim 1, a partitioning wall defines a tool containing space in an inner box and a reinforcing rib provided on the partitioning wall restricts movement of a tool contained in the containing space toward a wall surface of the partitioning wall, and further a pressing means presses the tool for restricting movement of the tool in the longitudinal direction, thereby preventing the tool from being slipped off backward. [0021]<br>
Accordingly, the tool contained in the inner box can be restricted from being moved, for example, by vibration caused during running of the vehicle.  This makes it possible to prevent breakage of the inner box due to movement of the tool, and to prevent occurrence of uncomfortable noise caused by striking of the tool to the inner box.<br>
In addition, the reinforcing rib provided on the partitioning wall, which increases the strength of the partitioning wall, prevents the partitioning wall from being curvedly deformed.  Accordingly, the tool is more effectively restricted from being moved toward the wall surface of the partitioning wall. [0022]<br><br>
According to an invention described in claim 2, the partitioning wall is removably provided in the inner box, and accordingly, it can be removed as needed for containing a large sized baggage and the like in the inner box.<br>
