				<td>Band stop filter<br>
The invention relates to a band stop filter implemented by coaxial resonators for filtering antenna signals particularly in base stations of mobile commurtication networks.<br>
In bidirectional radio systems of mobile communication networks, the transmitting and receiving bands are relatively close to each other. In the full duplex system, in which signals are transferred in both directions simultaneously, it must be especially ensured that a transmitting of relatively high power does not interfere in the receiving or wide-band noise of the transmitting block the receiver. The output signal of the transmitter power amplifier is therefore strongly attenuated; on the receiving band of the system before feeding to the antenna. When the transmitting band is above the receiving band, a high-pass filter is sufficient for that in pHnciple. However, if signals of some other system, the spectrum of which is below the above mentioned receiving band, are also fed to the antenna through the same antenna fitter, a band stop filter is needed for the attenuation.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an example of a known band stop filter used as an antenrta filter. The filter 100 comprises, in a unitary conductive filter housing a first R1, a; second R2 and a third R3 coaxial resonator, which have no mutual coupling. The filter housing has been drawn in Fig. 1 with its cover removed and cut open soithat the inner conductors of the resonators, such as the inner conductor 101, arje partly visible. The inner space of the housing is divided by conductive partition wjalls into resonator cavities. The lower ends of the inner conductors of the resonators join galvanically to the bottom of the housing and thus to the signal ground GNJD. Their upper ends have only a capacitive coupling to the cover of the housing land the surrounding, conductive walls, and so the resonators are quarter-wave resonators. In addition, the filter 100 comprises a coaxial transmitting line 120 land an arrangement for coupling the transmitting line to the resonators. The transmitting line runs through three coaxial T-connectors, which are galvanically fastened to one side wall 112 of the resonator housing. The first T-connector 131 is at the first resonator R1, the second T-connector 132 at the second resonator R2|and the third T-connector 133 at the third resonator R3. In the example of Fig;. 1, the electric distance between two successive connectors is a quarter; of the wavelength on the middle frequency of the filter stop band, which is an advantageous length with regard to the matching of the transmitting path. The conductive casing of the branch part of each T-connector is in galvanic contact<br><br>
with the side wall 112, and so the outer conductor of the transmitting line becomes connected to the ground GND. The inner conductor of the branch part of the first T-connector has been connected to the first coupling element 141 in the cavity of the first resonator. That element is a rigid conductor, which in thisi example extends relatively close to the upper end of the inner conductor 101 of the first resonator. In this way, the first resonator becomes electromagnetically coupled parallel with the transmitting line 120. In the same way, the second resonator becomes coupled parallel with the transmitting line by means of the coupling element 142 in the cavity of the second resonator, and the third resonator by means of the coupling element 143 in the cavity of the third resonator. The shape of the coupling element can vary, and it can be, for example, a loop conductor going round the lower end of the inner conductor of the resonator.<br>
The ends of the transmitting line 120 function as the input and output ports of the band stop filter 100. The end of the transmitting line on the side of the first resonator is, for example, the input port IN and the second end is the output port OUT. The band stop property is based on that the resonator represents at its natural frequency a short circuit as viewed from the transmitting line. ln;that case the energy fed to the transmitting line is almost entirely reflected back to the feeding source, and hardly any energy is transferred to the load coupjed to the output port. At frequencies that are clearly lower or higher than the natural frequency, the resonator is seen as a high impedance, in which case the energy of the signal is transferred to said load without any obstacle. One resonator provides a relatively narrow stop band. By using more than one resonator and by adjusting their natural frequencies to have different values but suitably close to each other, the stop band can be widened.<br>
Fig. 2 shows two examples of the amplitude response of a three-resonator band stop filter. The response curves 21 and 22 show the change of the transmitting coefficient 821 of the filter as a function of frequency. The smaller the transmitting coefficient, the higher the attenuation of the filter is. In both cases, the natural frequencies of the resonators have been arranged at the points 1925 MHz, 1950 MHz and 1975 MHz, for which reason an attenuation peak occurs at these frequencies. Between two adjacent attenuation peaks, the attenuation gets a minimum value, which is the minimum attenuation in the stop band, or more briefly, the stop attenuation. The attenuation values depend on the strengths of the electromagnetic couplings arranged by the coupling elements in the resonators. In the case of the first curve 21, the stop attenuation is arranged to the vajue 20 dB<br><br>
by the coupling elements, and to the value 40 dB in the case of the second curve 22. It can be seen from the shape of the curves that increasing the attenuation widens the transition bands of the filter. A transition band means an range between the stop band and the pass band, when the pass band is considered to be an range on which the attenuation is, for example, 1 dB at the highest. In duplex systems, the range between the transmitting and receiving barid$, or the duplex spacing, has been specified to have a certain value. The transition band of the filter must naturally be narrower than the specified duplex spacing, which means that the stop attenuation cannot be freely increased. This also appfies to filters according to the invention.<br>
One drawback of the filter according to Fig. 1 is a relatively large number of structural parts in the transmitting line structure, which increases the production costs. A large number of parts also means numerous conductive junctions, which causes harmful intermediation. Where a transmission end filter is concerned, the problem is emphasized because of the relatively high currents that occur in it. A further drawback is the difficult tuning of the filter. The tuning includes both setting the natural frequencies of the resonators and setting the strengths of the couplings between the resonators and the transmitting line. In accordance with the above-descriped, the tuning takes place by bending straight coupling elements or by shaping loop-like coupling conductors in relation to the inner conductors of the resonators. The resonators are not entirely isolated in practice, but the tuning of one influences the natural frequencies of the others through the transmitting line of the filter. This results in a number of manual iteration rounds in the tuning, which means a significant cost factor in production.<br>
The purpose of the invention is to reduce the above mentioned drawbacks of the prior art. A band stop filter according to the invention is characterized in what is set forth in the independent claim 1. Some preferred embodiments of the invention are set forth in the other claims.<br>
The basic idea of the invention is the following: The starting point is a band stop filter structure known as such, comprising a transmitting line and coaxial resonators electromagnetically coupled parallel with it, the natural frequencies of the resonators differing from each other slightly. The resonators form a unitary conductive resonator housing, the inner space of which has been divided into resonator cavities by conductive partition walls. In the invention, the center conductor of the transmitting line is placed inside the resonator housing so that it runs through all the resonator cavities, and the housing functions as the outer<br><br>
conductor of the transmitting line at the same time. The resonator cavities are thus a part of the cavity of the transmitting line. When an electromagnetic field of the same frequency as the natural frequency of a resonator occurs in the transmitting line, the resonator in question starts to oscillate, causing the field to reflect back towards the feeding source. The strength of the resonance and the width of its range of influence at the same time are set, for example, by choosing the; distance of the inner conductor of the resonator from the center conductor of the transmitting line suitably.<br>
The invention has the advantage that the number of discrete structural parts in the band stop filter is significantly smaller than in corresponding known filters, in wnich case the manufacture is cheaper and the reliability of the complete product is better. In addition, the invention has the advantage that less interrnodulation takes place in a filter according to it than in corresponding known filters. This is due to the fact that the number of metallic junctions is smaller because of the smaller number of structural parts. In addition, the invention has the advantage that the tuning of the filter is relatively simple. Furthermore, the invention has the advantage that other functional units, such as a low-pass filter or a directional coupler can be easily integrated into the structure of the band stop filter.<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in more detail. Reference will be made to the accompanying drawings, in which<br>

Fig. 6       presents the significance of the place of the inner conductor of a single resonator in a band stop filter according to the invention, and<br>
Fig. 7       shows an example of a transmitting conductor, which enables an additional function in a structure according to the invention.<br><br>
Figs. 1 and 2 were already explained in connection with the description of the prior art.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an example of a band stop filter according to the invention. The filter 300 comprises in a unitary conductive filter housing, a first R1, a second R2 and a third R3 coaxial resonator, like in Fig. 1. The filter housing 310, which comprises a bottom, side walls, end walls and a cover, has been drawn in Fig. 3 with its cover removed and cut open so that the inner conductors of the resonators, such as the inner conductor 301 of the first resonator, are partly visible. The inner space of the housing is divided by two conductive partition walls into resonator cavities. The lower ends of the resonator inner conductors join galvanically to the bottom of the housing and thus to the signal ground GND. Their upper ends have only a capacitive coupling to the cover of the housing and the surrounding, conductive walls, and so the resonators are quarter-wave resonators. In addition, the filter 300 comprises a transmitting conductor 321. This is located inside the housing 310, running across the resonator cavities from the end wall of the housing to the opposite end wall through openings in them and in the partition walls. The transmitting conductor is insulated from the end and partition walls by a djelectric medium, which can be air or some solid substance. In the former case, the transmitting conductor rests on its galvanic end connections, and in the latter case, the medium forming a bushing-like piece supports the transmitting conductor in place. Fig. 3 shows such an insulation bushing 325 on the end wall on the side of the third resonator R3.<br>
The transmitting conductor 321 and the housing 310 form a transmitting line 320. The transmitting conductor is thus the center conductor of the transmitting line 320, the resonator housing functions as the outer conductor of the transmitting line at the same time, and the cavity of the transmitting line consists of the resonator cavities. The transmitting line 320 continues from the side of the filter output port OUT as an ordinary coaxial cable 365. Its center conductor is connected by a coaxial connector at the end wall of the housing to the transmitting conductor 321, and the sheath-like outer conductor to the end wall of the housing. A similar connector functioning as the input port IN of the filter is at the end wall of the housing on the side of the first resonator R1.<br>
Following from the structure described above the field of the transmitting line 320 and the field of a single resonator are in the same air space, in which case there is clearly an electromagnetic coupling between the transmitting line and each<br><br>
resonator. In the example of Fig. 3, the transmitting conductor 321 is beside the resonator inner conductors, close to the open upper end of the resonators, where there prevails an electric field while the resonator is oscillating. The coupling is therefore predominantly capacitive. The transmitting conductor can as well be placed lower; the lower it is, the greater is the proportion of the magnetic field in the coupling. The principle of the function of the filter is the same as wasiexplained in connection with Fig. 1. The transmitting conductor itself corresponds to the coupling elements 141, 142, 143 of Fig. 1. The strengths of the couplings can be chosen by arranging the distances of the resonator inner conductors from the transmitting conductor as suitable at the manufacturing stage. Trie natural frequencies of the resonators are arranged in a known manner to haV® slightly different values by varying primarily the electric length of the inner conductor. In that case each resonator causes an attenuation peak in the amplitude response curve at its natural frequency, and the response curve becomes like the one shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a second example of a band stop fitter according to the! invention. The filter 400 is similar to the filter 300 of Fig. 3 with the difference that the transmitting conductor 421, or the center conductor of the transmitting line 420, is now above the inner conductors of the resonators, between the inner conductors and the cover of the housing. A coaxial connector 450 functioning as the input port IN of the filter at the end wall of the housing on the side of the first resonator R1 is also seen in the figure.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a third example of a band stop filter according to the invention. The filter 500 differs from the filters shown in Figs. 3 and 4 in that the transmitting conductor 521 is now galvanically coupled to the bottom of the resonator housing. In the cavity of the first resonator R1, there is a coupling conductor 541 extending from the transmitting conductor to the bottom of the housing, in the cavity of the second resonator R2 a second coupling conductor 542 extending! from the transmitting conductor to the bottom of the housing, and in the cavity of the third resonator R3 a third coupling conductor 543 extending from the transmitting conductor to the bottom of the housing. The coupling conductors 541, 542 and 543 strengthen the inductive coupling between the transmitting line and the ifesonators. The coupling conductors can be manufactured so that they are of the same piece with either the transmitting conductor or the bottom of the housing, without junctions. The cover of the resonator housing is also seen as cut in Fig. 5.<br><br>
By comparing the structures presented in Figs. 2 to 5 to the one in Rig. 1, it becomes obvious how the invention provides a simplification of the structure. Similarly, it can be seen that the number of conductive junctions included in the structure is reduced to a small part of the original.<br>
Fig. 6 indicates the significance of the place of the inner conductor of a single resonator in a band stop filter according to the invention. The figure presents a resonator R3 from above as horizontally cut open. The transmitting conductor 621 belonging to the filter runs through the partition walls confining the resonator R3 and beside its inner conductor 603. As mentioned, the distance between the inner conductor and the transmitting conductor has an effect on the strength of the coupling between the transmitting line and the resonator. The coupling adjustment CA is thus implemented by choosing the place of the inner conductor in the perpendicular direction to the transmitting conductor.<br>
The impedance of a transmitting line structure, which at the same time is a band stop filter, does naturally not remain exactly at its nominal value in the whole operating band of the device using the filter. The electric lengths of the portions of the transmitting line between the resonators have an effect on the constancy of the impedance value. The electric length between two successive resonators changes if the distance between their inner conductors is changed, although the dimensions of the structure remain otherwise unchanged. The impedance matching adjustment MA can thus be implemented by choosing the place of the inner conductor 603 in the direction of the transmitting conductor. In the optimum matching, the distances between the inner conductors of the successive resonators can vary slightly.<br>
When the inner conductors are of the same piece with the resonator housing (without cover), their optimal places must be determined already before the housing is manufactured.<br>
Fig. 7 presents an example of a transmitting conductor, which enables an additional function in a structure according to the invention. Here the additional function is low-pass filtering. The transmitting conductor 770 has a relatively long portion 771 of even thickness, which corresponds to the transmitting conductors shown in Figs. 3 to 6. In addition, the transmitting conductor 770 has five cylindrical and relatively short extensions, the axes of which join the axis of the long portion 771. The diameters of the first 772, the third 774 and the fifth 776 extension in order are significantly greater than the diameter of the long portion.<br><br>
The diameters of the second 773 and the fourth 775 extension in order ;again are significantly smaller than the diameter of the long portion. The part of the transmitting conductor formed by the extensions is placed in the filter housing in a cavity reserved for it outside the band stop filter, the walls confining that cavity functioning as the signal ground GND: The substantial characteristic of the first, third and fifth extensions is their capacitance with respect to the ground, and the substantial characteristic of the second and the fourth extensions is their inductance. These inductive portions are galvanically coupled in series through the thicker portions. The extensions together with the signal ground thus correspond to a low-passing LC chain made with discrete components, in which there are by turns a capacitor transversally and a coil in series. The values of the inductances and the capacitances naturally depend on the dimensioning of the portions, by which the response of the low-pass filter thus is determined.<br>
An alternative way to integrate the low-pass filter into the structure according to the invention is to leave the thickness of the transmitting conductor even for its whole length and make thickenings in the walls of the cavity of the low-pass filter, extending relatively close to the transmitting conductor. The transverse capacitances are implemented by these.<br>
It is also possible to integrate a directional coupler in the structure according to the invention by arranging a suitable electromagnetic coupling to the transmitting conductor by some manner known as such. Further, if DC isolation is needed in the band stop filter, no discrete components are required for it. The end of the transmitting conductor can be made hollow and continue the center conductor of the input or output line to the space created so that a sufficient capacitance is formed between the center conductor and the transmitting conductor.<br>
In this description and the claims, the qualifiers "lower" and "upper", as well as "from above" and "beside" refer to the position of the filter shown in figures 3 to 5, and they have nothing to do with the position in which the filter is used.<br>
