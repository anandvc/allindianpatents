				<td>Carbon black, method for the production thereof, and use<br>
thereof<br>
The invention relates to a carbon black, to a process for<br>
production of the same, and also to the use of the same.<br>
Carbon blacks are conventionally used as pigments or<br>
reinforcing fillers or other fillers, and for a wide<br>
variety of other applications. By way of example, carbon<br>
blacks are used as reinforcing fillers in rubber mixtures<br>
which can be used as a starting material for tire treads.<br>
It is well known that the specific surface area of carbon<br>
black has considerable effect on the reinforcing behavior<br>
of carbon black in rubber mixtures. The higher the specific<br>
surface area here, the better the reinforcing behavior and<br>
in particular the abrasion behavior of tire treads<br>
[G. Kraus, Angewandte Makromolekulare Chemie [Applied<br>
Macromolecular Chemistry], Volume 60/61 (1977), page 215] .<br>
However, high specific surface area has the disadvantage<br>
that the rubber mixture has high hysteresis, a consequence<br>
of which is that the tire treads have increased rolling<br>
resistance [W.M. Hess et al., Rubber Chemistry and<br>
Technology, Volume 56, page 390]. Higher rolling resistance<br>
of tire treads causes higher fuel consumption and thus high<br>
energy consumption and/or carbon dioxide emission. This is<br>
undesirable, for economic and environmental reasons.<br>
It is therefore desirable, for environmental and economic<br>
reasons, to achieve a further decrease in hysteresis of<br>
rubber mixtures and thus the rolling resistance of tire<br>
treads, for a given specific surface area. It is known that<br>
this can be achieved, for a given specific surface area, by<br>
broadening the aggregate-size distribution [W.M. Hess et<br>
al.,Rubber Chemistry and Technology, Volume 56, page 390].<br>
However, when the aggregate-size distribution is broadened<br>
there is a simultaneous reduction in the tint strength of<br>
the carbon black [C.J. Stacy et al., Rubber Chemistry and<br>
Technology, Volume 48, page 538]. It is moreover known<br>
that, in particular when high stress levels are involved, a<br>
broadened aggregate-size distribution of carbon black<br>
impairs the abrasion behavior of rubber mixtures and<br>
therefore impairs the abrasion behavior of tire treads<br>
[W.M. Hess et al., Rubber Chemistry and Technology, Volume<br>
56, page 390]. Broadening of aggregate-size distribution is<br>
therefore advantageous for rolling resistance, but is<br>
generally associated with poorer abrasion behavior.<br>
US 2005/0256249 discloses a carbon material with AD50/M<br>
greater than 0.9 and with heterogeneity index greater than<br>
2.3.<br>
EP 0754735 discloses furnace blacks which, when compared<br>
with carbon blacks having identical CTAB surface area,<br>
feature lower rolling resistance together with identical or<br>
better wet-skid performance, when incorporated into SSBR/BR<br>
rubber mixtures. They can be produced in conventional<br>
carbon-black reactors, by conducting the combustion process<br>
in the combustion chamber in such a way that carbon-black<br>
nuclei form and are immediately brought into contact with<br>
the feedstock used for the carbon black.<br>
A disadvantage of the carbon blacks disclosed in EP 0754735<br>
is that abrasion resistance is too low, while rolling<br>
resistance is simultaneously low (loss factor tan 8) in<br>
rubber mixtures.<br>
EP 0949303 discloses carbon blacks which, when compared<br>
with the carbon blacks of EP 0754735, have an aggregate-<br>
size distribution with smaller proportions of large-<br>
diameter aggregates. This leads to improved abrasion<br>
behavior in rubber mixtures. The carbon-black reactors are<br>
run in such a way that carbon-black nuclei form and are<br>
immediately brought into contact with the feedstock used<br>
for the carbon black, with a suitable increase in the<br>
supply of combustion air and the feedstock used for the<br>
carbon black.<br>
A disadvantage of the carbon blacks disclosed in EP 0949303<br>
is the reduction in tint strength and a non-ideal balance<br>
between abrasion resistance and rolling resistance,<br>
although abrasion resistance is better than that of the<br>
carbon blacks of EP 0754735, while rolling resistance is<br>
simultaneously low (loss factor tan 8) .<br>
EP 1783178 discloses a furnace-black process in which a<br>
feedstock used for the carbon black is introduced in a<br>
first stage and is combined with a stream of hot gases, in<br>
order to form a precursor, consisting essentially of a<br>
carbon black in a reaction stream, and further amounts of<br>
the feedstock material used for the carbon black are then<br>
introduced to said precursor, with the aim of thus<br>
partially quenching the reaction stream and subsequently<br>
completely quenching the entire reaction stream. The stream<br>
of hot gases in EP 1783178 can be produced in the form of<br>
combustion gas from the reaction of a fuel with an oxidant,<br>
such as air, and the ratio of air to fuel here can vary<br>
from 1:1 (stoichiometric) up to an infinite ratio. The fuel<br>
can be a solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
carbon black which, in rubber mixtures, provides a good<br>
balance of high abrasion resistance (= low abrasion) with<br>
low rolling resistance.<br>
The invention provides a carbon black, characterized in<br>
that the CTAB surface area is from 100 to 160 m2/g,<br>
preferably from 100 to 149 m2/g, particularly preferably<br>
from 100 to 144 m2/g, very particularly preferably from 105<br>
to 140 m2/g, the quartile ratio is greater than 1.60,<br>
preferably from 1.65 to 2.30, particularly preferably from<br>
1.7 0 to 2.30, very particularly preferably from 1.75 to<br>
2.30, with particular preference from 1.80 to 2.30,<br>
extremely preferably from 1.85 to 2.25, and the FP index is<br>
&gt; 0, preferably &gt; 0.5, particularly preferably &gt; 1.0, very<br>
particularly preferably &gt; 1.5.<br>
The FP index is calculated from the following equation:<br>
FP index = tint strength - (65 + (1.057 g/m2) * CTAB -<br>
(0.002745 g2/m4) * CTAB * CTAB - (25.96 g/cm3) * COAN -<br>
(0.201 g/m2) * (NSA - CTAB)) + 6.57502 - 847817 *<br>
EXP(- 6.94397 * (quartile ratio)).<br>
The CTAB value is measured to ASTM D3765-04.<br>
The NSA value is measured to ASTM D6556-04, using the<br>
following parameters: relative pressures: section 10.4.4.<br>
The COAN value is measured to ASTM D3493-06, using the<br>
following parameters: Oil: paraffin; method for end-point<br>
determination: procedure A.<br>
The tint strength is measured to ASTM D3265-06, using the<br>
following parameters: Hoover Muller paste preparation,<br>
Erichsen tint tester - film drawdown method.<br>
The quartile ratio is calculated from the aggregate-size<br>
distribution.<br>
The aggregate-size distribution here is determined to the<br>
ISO 15825 standard, first edition, 2004-11-01, with the<br>
following modifications:<br>
Supplement to section 4.6.3 of the ISO 15825 standard: The<br>
mode relates to the curve of distribution by mass (mass<br>
distribution curve).<br>
Supplement to section 5.1 of the ISO 15825 standard: The<br>
equipment used comprises a BI-DCP Particle Sizer with<br>
associated dcplw32 evaluation software, Version 3.81, all<br>
of which is obtainable from Brookhaven Instruments<br>
Corporation, 750 Blue Point Rd., Holtsville, NY, 11742.<br>
Supplement to section 5.2 of the ISO 15825 standard: The<br>
equipment used comprises a GM22 00 ultrasound control unit,<br>
a UW2200 acoustic transducer, and a DH13G sonotrode. The<br>
ulstrasound control unit, acoustic transducer, and<br>
sonotrode are obtainable from Bandelin electronic GmbH &amp;<br>
Co. KG, Heinrichstrasse 3-4, D-12207 Berlin. The values set<br>
here on the ultrasound control unit are as follows: Power<br>
% = 50, Cycle = 8. This corresponds to a nominal power<br>
level set at 100 watts and to pulse levels set at 80%.<br>
Supplement to section 5.2.1 of the ISO 15825 standard:<br>
Ultrasound time is set at 4.5 minutes.<br>
The definition given in section 6.3 of the ISO 15825<br>
standard is varied by defining "surfactant" as follows:<br>
"surfactant" is Nonidet P 40 Substitute, which is an<br>
anionic surfactant from Fluka, obtainable from Sigma-<br>
Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Industriestrasse 25, CH-9471 Buchs SG,<br>
Switzerland.<br>
The definition of spin fluid given in section 6.5 of the<br>
ISO 15825 standard is varied by defining spin fluid as<br>
follows: The spin fluid is produced by taking 0.25 g of<br>
Nonidet P 40 Substitute surfactant from Fluka (section 6.3)<br>
and making this up to 1000 ml with demineralized water<br>
(section 6.1). The pH of the solution is then adjusted to<br>
from 9 to 10 by using 0.1 mol/1 NaOH solution. The spin<br>
fluid has to be used at most 1 week after it has been<br>
produced.<br>
The definition of dispersion fluid given in section 6.6 of<br>
the ISO 15825 standard is varied by defining dispersion<br>
fluid as follows: The dispersion fluid is produced by<br>
taking 2 00 ml of ethanol (section 6.2) and 0.5 g of Nonidet<br>
P 40 Substitute surfactant from Fluka (section 6.3) and<br>
making this up to 1000 ml with demineralized water (section<br>
6.1). The pH of the solution is then adjusted to from 9 to<br>
10 by using 0.1 mol/1 NaOH solution. The dispersion fluid<br>
has to be used at most 1 week after it has been produced.<br>
Supplement to section 7 of the ISO 15825 standard: The<br>
material used is exclusively pelletized carbon black.<br>
The instructions in sections 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 of the<br>
ISO 15825 standard are together replaced by the following<br>
instruction: The pelletized carbon black is gently crushed<br>
in an agate mortar. 20 ml of dispersion solution (section<br>
6.6) are then admixed with 20 mg of carbon black in a 3 0 ml<br>
beaded-rim bottle (diameter 28 mm, height 75 mm, wall<br>
thickness 1.0 mm) and treated with ultrasound (section 5.2)<br>
in a cooling bath (16°C +/- 1°C) for a period of 4.5<br>
minutes (section 5.2.1) so that the carbon black becomes<br>
suspended in the dispersion solution. After the ultrasound<br>
treatment, the specimen is measured in the centrifuge<br>
within a period of 5 minutes.<br>
Supplement to section 9 of the ISO 15825 standard: The<br>
carbon black density value to be entered is 1.86 g/cm3. The<br>
temperature for the temperature to be entered is determined<br>
in accordance with section 10.11. The option "aqueous" is<br>
selected for spin-fluid type. This gives a value of 0.997<br>
(g/cc) for spin-fluid density and a value of 0.917 (cP) for<br>
spin-fluid viscosity. The light-scattering correction is<br>
applied by using options selectable in the dcplw 32<br>
software: file = carbon.prm; Mie correction.<br>
Supplement to section 10.1 of the ISO 15825 standard:<br>
Centrifuge speed is set to 11 000 r/min.<br>
Supplement to section 10.2 of the ISO 15825 standard:<br>
0.85 cm3 of ethanol (section 6.2) is injected instead of<br>
0.2 cm3 of ethanol (section 6.2).<br>
Supplement to section 10.3 of the ISO 15825 standard:<br>
Exactly 15 cm3 of spin fluid (section 6.5) are injected.<br>
0.15 cm3 of ethanol (section 6.2) is then injected.<br>
The instruction in section 10.4 of the ISO 15825 standard<br>
is omitted completely.<br>
Supplement to section 10.7 of the ISO 15825 standard:<br>
Immediately after the start of data recording, the spin<br>
fluid in the centrifuge is covered with 0.1 cm3 of dodecane<br>
(section 6.4).<br>
Supplement to section 10.10 of the ISO 15825 standard: If<br>
the measurement curve does not return to the base line<br>
within a period of one hour, the measurement is terminated<br>
after precisely 1 hour of measurement time, rather than<br>
restarting with a different centrifuge-rotation rate.<br>
Supplement to section 10.11 of the ISO 15825 standard:<br>
Instead of using the method described in the instructions<br>
for determining the measurement temperature, the<br>
measurement temperature T to be entered into the computer<br>
program is determined as follows:<br>
T = 2/3 (Te - Ta) + Ta,<br>
where Ta is the temperature of the measurement chamber<br>
prior to measurement and Te is the temperature of the<br>
measurement chamber after measurement. The temperature<br>
difference should not exceed 4°C.<br>
The fraction of the particles &gt; 150 nm in the aggregate-<br>
size distribution can be smaller than 20% by weight,<br>
preferably smaller than 14% by weight, particularly<br>
preferably smaller than 10% by weight.<br>
The fraction &gt; 150 nm is the proportion by weight of the<br>
aggregates having a Stokes diameter greater than 150 nm,<br>
and is likewise obtained from the aggregate-size<br>
distribution in accordance with the ISO 15825 standard<br>
described above.<br>
The ratio calculated from the AD-50 value and the mode can<br>
be greater than 1.0, preferably greater than 1.05, very<br>
particularly preferably greater than or equal to 1.10.<br>
The AD-50 value and the mode are likewise obtained form the<br>
aggregate-size distribution in accordance with the<br>
ISO 15825 standard described above.<br>
Tint strength can be greater than 110, preferably greater<br>
than 114, particularly greater than 117, very particularly<br>
greater than 120.<br>
The COAN value can be from 90 to 130 cm3/100 g.<br>
The carbon black can be a gas black, channel black, lamp<br>
black, or furnace black.<br>
The carbon black of the invention can be a carbon black<br>
which has not undergone surface modification and which has<br>
not undergone post-treatment.<br>
The pH of the carbon black of the invention can be &gt; 5.<br>
The invention further provides a process for producing the<br>
carbon black of the invention in a furnace-black reactor<br>
which comprises, along the reactor axis, a combustion zone,<br>
a reaction zone, and a termination zone, via production of<br>
a stream of hot exhaust gas in the combustion zone via<br>
combustion of a fuel in an oxygen-containing gas and<br>
passage of the exhaust gas from the combustion zone via the<br>
reaction zone into the termination zone, mixing to<br>
incorporate a feedstock used for the carbon black into the<br>
hot exhaust gas in the reaction zone, and termination of<br>
carbon-black formation in the termination zone via<br>
introduction of water spray, characterized in that from 60<br>
to 90% by weight, preferably from 75 to 85% by weight, of<br>
the feedstock used for the carbon black are introduced<br>
through a nozzle within the first third of the reaction<br>
zone, and the remaining amount of the feedstock used for<br>
the carbon black is introduced through a nozzle upstream at<br>
at least one further point into the reactor, and the fuel<br>
is conducted in such a way that on first encounter with the<br>
feedstock used for the carbon black from 90 to 100% by<br>
weight, preferably from 99 to 100% by weight, of the fuel<br>
has vaporized, and 5 ms prior to encountering the feedstock<br>
used for the carbon black from 80 to 99% by weight,<br>
preferably from 90 to 99% by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 92 to 98% by weight, of the fuel has<br>
vaporized.<br>
The fuel atomizer used can comprise either atomizers<br>
operating purely by using pressure (one-fluid atomizer) or<br>
else two-fluid atomizers using internal or external mixing.<br>
The fuel can be conducted in accordance with the invention<br>
either by using atomizers operating purely by using<br>
pressure (one-fluid atomizers) or else by using two-fluid<br>
atomizers with internal or external mixing, by selecting<br>
the conditions in such a way as to balance the following<br>
factors: the droplet size achieved during the atomization<br>
process, the residence time of these droplets prior to<br>
encountering the feedstock used for the carbon black, and<br>
the reaction temperatures. In particular, use of two-fluid<br>
atomizers and of liquid fuel permits control of droplet<br>
size within a wide range independently of throughput, and<br>
thus allows this to be balanced with the residence time of<br>
the fuel prior to encountering the feedstock used for the<br>
carbon black, and with the reaction temperatures.<br>
Droplet-size distribution can be determined with the aid of<br>
optical methods. Various commercial nozzle manufacturers<br>
supply these measurements as a service, an example being<br>
Diisen-Schlick GmbH, Hutstrasse 4, D-96253<br>
Untersiemau/Coburg, Germany (www.duesen-schlick.de). The<br>
residence time of the droplets, and the reaction<br>
temperatures within the process, can be determined on the<br>
basis of computer-aided rheological simulation<br>
calculations. By way of example, "Fluent", Version 6.3,<br>
from Fluent (Fluent Deutschland GmbH, Birkenweg 14a, 64295<br>
Darmstadt) is commercial software which can simulate the<br>
furnace reactor used and, after input of all of the ingoing<br>
process streams, inclusive of the measured droplet-size<br>
distribution, can use its underlying chemical model to<br>
calculate the residence times and the vaporization rates of<br>
the fuel droplets, and the reaction temperatures.<br>
The fuel can be a liquid fuel or a fuel which is to some<br>
extent liquid and to some extent gaseous.<br>
The feedstocks used for the carbon black can be introduced<br>
through nozzles by means of radial lances. The number of<br>
radial lances used can be from 2-32, preferably from 4-16,<br>
particularly preferably from 4-8.<br>
The feedstock used for the carbon black can be a liquid or<br>
gaseous feedstock or a feedstock which is to some extent<br>
liquid and to some extent gaseous.<br>
The liquid feedstock used for the carbon black can be<br>
atomized by pressure, by steam, by compressed air, or by<br>
the gaseous feedstock.<br>
Liquid feedstocks that can be used for the carbon black are<br>
liquid aliphatic or aromatic, saturated or unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbons, or a mixture thereof, or coal-tar<br>
distillates, or residual oils produced during the catalytic<br>
cracking of petroleum fractions or during olefin production<br>
via cracking of naphtha, or of gas oil.<br>
The gaseous feedstock used for the carbon black can be<br>
gaseous aliphatic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons, a<br>
mixture thereof, or natural gas.<br>
The "K factor" is often used as a variable to characterize<br>
the excess of air. The K factor is the ratio between the<br>
amount of air needed for stoichiometric combustion of the<br>
fuel and the actual amount of air introduced into the<br>
combustion process. A K factor of 1 therefore means<br>
stoichiometric combustion. If there is an excess of air,<br>
the K factor is smaller than 1. K factors that can be used<br>
here are from 0.2 to 0.9, as is the case with known carbon<br>
blacks. Preferred K factors used are from 0.6 to 0.8.<br>
The process described is not restricted to any particular<br>
reactor geometry, but rather can be adapted to various<br>
reactor types and reactor sizes.<br>
The atomizers for the feedstock for the carbon black can be<br>
either atomizers operating purely by using pressure (one-<br>
fluid atomizers) or else two-fluid atomizers with internal<br>
or external mixing, and the atomizing medium used can be<br>
the gaseous feedstock used for the carbon black.<br>
Two-fluid atomizers can be used for atomizing liquid<br>
feedstock used for the carbon black. In the case of one-<br>
fluid atomizers, a change in throughput can also lead to a<br>
change in droplet size, but in the case of two-fluid<br>
atomizers the droplet size can be controlled substantially<br>
independently of throughput.<br>
If the feedstock used for the carbon black simultaneously<br>
comprises oil and gaseous hydrocarbons, e.g. methane, the<br>
gaseous hydrocarbons can be injected separately from the<br>
oil by way of a dedicated set of gas lances into the stream<br>
of hot exhaust gas.<br>
The carbon blacks of the invention can be used as<br>
reinforcing filler or other filler, UV stabilizer,<br>
conductive carbon black, or pigment. The carbon blacks of<br>
the invention can be used in rubber, plastic, printing<br>
inks, inkjet inks, other inks, toners, lacquers, paints,<br>
and in paper, and in bitumen, concrete, and other<br>
construction materials. The carbon blacks of the invention<br>
can be used as reducing agents for metallurgical purposes.<br>
The carbon blacks of the invention can be used as<br>
reinforcing carbon black in rubber mixtures.<br>
The invention further provides rubber mixtures<br>
characterized in that they comprise at least one rubber,<br>
preferably at least one diene rubber, particularly<br>
preferably at least natural rubber, and at least one carbon<br>
black of the invention.<br>
The amounts that can be used of the carbon black of the<br>
invention are from 10 to 150 phr (parts per hundred<br>
rubber), preferably from 2 0 to 100 phr, particularly<br>
preferably from 30 to 90 phr, very particularly preferably<br>
from 3 0 to 80 phr, based on the amount of the rubber used.<br>
The rubber mixture of the invention can be comprise silica,<br>
preferably precipitated silica. The rubber mixture of the<br>
invention can comprise organosilanes, such as<br>
bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) polysulfide or (mercaptoorganyl)-<br>
alkoxysilanes.<br>
The rubber mixture of the invention can comprise rubber<br>
auxiliaries.<br>
Materials suitable for production of the rubber mixtures of<br>
the invention are not only natural rubber but also<br>
synthetic rubbers. Preferred synthetic rubbers are<br>
described by way of example in W. Hofmann,<br>
Kautschuktechnologie [Rubber technology], Genter Verlag,<br>
Stuttgart 1980. They encompass inter alia<br>
- polybutadiene (BR),<br>
- polyisoprene (IR),<br>
- styrene/butadiene copolymers, such as emulsion SBR<br>
(ESBR) or solution SBR (SSBR), preferably having<br>
styrene content of from 1 to 60% by weight,<br>
particularly preferably from 2 to 50% by weight, based<br>
on the entirety of the polymer,<br>
- chloroprene (CR),<br>
- isobutylene/isoprene copolymers (IIR),<br>
- butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers, preferably having<br>
acrylonitrile content of from 5 to 60% by weight,<br>
preferably from 10 to 50% by weight, based on the<br>
entirety of the polymer (NBR),<br>
- partially or fully hydrogenated NBR rubber (HNBR),<br>
- ethylene/propylene/diene copolymers (EPDM)<br>
- ethylene/propylene copolymers (EPM) or<br>
- abovementioned rubbers additionally having functional<br>
groups, such as carboxy, silanol, or epoxy groups,<br>
examples being epoxidized NR, carboxy-functionalized<br>
NBR, or silanol- (-SiOH) or siloxy-functionalized<br>
(-Si-OR) SBR,<br>
and also mixtures of these rubbers.<br>
Production of truck-tire treads can in particular use<br>
natural rubber, or else a mixture thereof with diene<br>
rubbers.<br>
Production of car-tire treads can in particular use SBR, or<br>
else a mixture thereof with other diene rubbers.<br>
The rubber mixtures of the invention can comprise further<br>
rubber auxiliaries, such as reaction accelerators,<br>
antioxidants, heat stabilizers, light stabilizers,<br>
antiozonants, processing aids, plasticizers, tackifiers,<br>
blowing agents, dyes, pigments, waxes, extenders, organic<br>
acids, retarders, metal oxides, and also activators, such<br>
as diphenylguanidine, triethanolamine, polyethylene glycol,<br>
alkoxy-terminated polyethylene glycol, or hexanetriol,<br>
these being known in the rubber industry.<br>
The amounts used of the rubber auxiliaries can be<br>
conventional, depending inter alia on the intended use.<br>
Examples of conventional amounts can be amounts of from 0.1<br>
to 5 0 phr, based on rubber.<br>
Crosslinking agents that can be used are sulfur, organic<br>
sulfur donors, or free radical generators. The rubber<br>
mixtures of the invention can moreover comprise<br>
vulcanization accelerators.<br>
Examples of suitable vulcanization accelerators can be<br>
mercaptobenzthiazoles, sulfenamides, guanidines, thiurams,<br>
dithiocarbamates, thioureas and thiocarbonates.<br>
The amounts that can be used of the vulcanization<br>
accelerators and crosslinking agents are from 0.1 to<br>
10 phr, preferably from 0.1 to 5 phr, based on rubber.<br>
The blending of the rubbers with the filler, and if<br>
appropriate with rubber auxiliaries, and if appropriate<br>
with the organosilanes, can be conducted in or on<br>
conventional mixing assemblies, such as rolls, internal<br>
mixers, and mixing extruders. Rubber mixtures of this type<br>
can usually be produced in an internal mixer, beginning<br>
with one or more successive thermomechanical mixing stages<br>
in which the following are incorporated: the rubbers, the<br>
carbon black of the invention, if appropriate the silica,<br>
and if appropriate the organosilanes, and the rubber<br>
auxiliaries, at from 100 to 170°C. The sequence of addition<br>
and the juncture of addition of the individual components<br>
can have a decisive effect here on the properties obtained<br>
from the mixture. The crosslinking chemicals can then<br>
usually be admixed with the resultant rubber mixture in an<br>
internal mixer or on a roll system at from 40 to 130°C,<br>
preferably from 50 to 120°C, the mixture then being<br>
processed to give what is known as the crude mixture for<br>
the process steps that follow, examples being shaping and<br>
vulcanization.<br>
The vulcanization of the rubber mixtures of the invention<br>
can take place at temperatures of 80 to 200°C, preferably<br>
from 130 to 180°C, if appropriate under pressure of from 10<br>
to 200 bar.<br>
The rubber mixtures of the invention are suitable for<br>
production of moldings, e.g. for the production of<br>
pneumatic or other tires, tire treads, cable sheathing,<br>
hoses, drive belts, conveyor belts, roll coverings, shoe<br>
soles, sealing rings, profiles, and damping elements.<br>
An advantage of the carbon black of the invention is good<br>
abrasion resistance together with good rolling resistance<br>
in rubber mixtures.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1 (production of carbon black):<br>
A series of carbon blacks of the invention are produced in<br>
the carbon-black reactor shown in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through the furnace<br>
reactor. The carbon-black reactor has a combustion chamber<br>
5, in which the hot process gas for the pyrolysis of the<br>
carbon black oil is produced via combustion of fuel with<br>
introduction of an excess of atmospheric oxygen. The<br>
inventive carbon black is produced by using carbon black<br>
oil as fuel. The comparative carbon black is produced by<br>
using natural gas as fuel.<br>
The combustion air is introduced by way of a plurality of<br>
apertures 2, distributed concentrically around the circular<br>
end wall of the combustion chamber. The fuel is introduced<br>
by way of the axial burner lance 1 into the combustion<br>
chamber. The burner lance can be displaced axially in order<br>
to optimize conduct of the process in the invention. The<br>
combustion chamber narrows conically in the direction of<br>
the narrowest section 6. The feedstock used for the carbon<br>
black is introduced through nozzles by way of radial lances<br>
3 at or prior to the narrowest section. Once the narrowest<br>
section has been passed, the reaction-gas mixture expands<br>
into the reaction chamber 7.<br>
A, B, and C indicate various positions for the injection of<br>
the carbon black oil into the hot process gas by means of<br>
the oil lances 3. At the head of the oil lances there are<br>
suitable spray nozzles. At each injection position there<br>
are at least four injectors distributed across the<br>
periphery of the reactor.<br>
In the termination zone, water spray is introduced via the<br>
quench-water lance 4.<br>
Combustion zone, reaction zone, and termination zone are<br>
characterized in Figure 1 by the Roman numerals I to III.<br>
The exact axial dimensioning of these depends on the<br>
respective positioning of the burner lance, of the oil<br>
lances, and of the quench-water lance.<br>
The dimensions of the reactor used can be found in the<br>
following list:<br>
<br>
measured from the entry to the narrowest section<br>
(+: after entry -: prior to entry)<br>
To produce the carbon blacks of the invention, a carbon<br>
black oil having 92% by weight carbon content and 6% by<br>
weight hydrogen content is used as fuel and feedstock. To<br>
produce the comparative carbon black, natural gas is used<br>
as fuel and a carbon black oil having 92% by weight carbon<br>
content and 6% by weight hydrogen content is used as<br>
feedstock.<br>
The reactor parameters for production of the carbon blacks<br>
of the invention are listed in Table 1. 5 different carbon<br>
blacks are produced (carbon blacks 1 to 4 of the invention<br>
and comparative carbon black 5). The production conditions<br>
differ in particular in relation to the amount of the<br>
feedstock injected at and, respectively, prior to the<br>
narrowest section.<br>
The carbon blacks produced are subjected to the<br>
conventional wet pelletization process prior to<br>
characterization and incorporation into the rubber<br>
mixtures.<br>
Measured from the start of the narrowest section<br>
The proportion of vaporized fuel 5 ms prior to first<br>
encounter with the feedstock, and of vaporized fuel on<br>
encounter with the feedstock, are calculated using version<br>
6.3 of the "Fluent" program, using a computer-aided<br>
rheological simulation calculation.<br>
Table 2 lists the analytical data for the carbon blacks<br>
produced:<br>
Comparative carbon black 1 is Corax® N 121 from Evonik<br>
Degussa GmbH. Comparative carbon black 2 is Ecorax® 172 0<br>
from Evonik Degussa GmbH. Comparative carbon black 2 is<br>
produced by the process described in EP 0949303.<br>
Comparative carbon black 3 is Corax® N 22 0 from Evonik<br>
Degussa GmbH. Comparative carbon black 4 is Corax® N 134<br>
from Evonik Degussa GmbH.<br>
Example 2 (vulcanizate tests in natural rubber):<br>
Table 3 below gives the formulation used for the natural<br>
rubber mixtures. The unit phr here means parts by weight,<br>
based on 100 parts of the crude rubber used.<br>
The general method for the production of rubber mixtures<br>
and vulcanizates thereof is described in the following<br>
book: "Rubber Technology Handbook", W. Hofmann, Hanser<br>
Verlag 1994.<br>
Table 3:<br>
<br>
SMR10 natural rubber, ML4 = from 60-70, is SMR10 which is<br>
masticated on a roll mill by the usual methods prior to<br>
the incorporation mixing process, with at least 24 hours,<br>
but at most 1 week, of intermediate storage at room<br>
temperature after the mastication process. The ML 1+4<br>
(100°C) value for this masticated SMR10 is in the range<br>
from 60 to 70. The ML 1+4 value is measured to<br>
DIN 53523/3.<br>
Vulkanox® 402 0 is the antioxidant 6PPD from Lanxess AG.<br>
Vulkanox® HS is the antioxidant TMQ from Lanxess AG.<br>
Protektor® G3108 is an antiozonant wax from Paramelt B.V..<br>
Rhenogran® TBBS-80 is a TBBS-type vulcanization accelerator<br>
from Rhein-Chemie GmbH, comprising 80% of active<br>
ingredient.<br>
The rubber mixtures were produced in an internal mixer in<br>
accordance with the mixing specification in Table 4.<br>
Table 6 shows the results of vulcanizate testing. The<br>
vulcanization time for the mixtures is 17 minutes.<br>
The higher the DIN abrasion (mm3) value, the poorer the<br>
abrasion resistance of the rubber mixture. The abrasion-<br>
resistance index is therefore calculated for each carbon<br>
black within the respective carbon black group, as follows:<br>
Abrasion-resistance index = (DIN abrasion of reference<br>
carbon black within the group / DIN abrasion) * 100.<br>
The reference carbon black within group 1 is comparative<br>
carbon black 1, the reference carbon black within group 2<br>
is comparative carbon black 3, the reference carbon black<br>
within group 3 is comparative carbon black 4 and the<br>
reference carbon black within group 4 is comparative carbon<br>
black 5.<br>
An abrasion-resistance index &gt; 100 therefore indicates<br>
improved abrasion resistance, and values 
impaired abrasion resistance, relative to the respective<br>
reference carbon black within the group.<br>
The higher the needle temperature (°C) value, the higher<br>
the level of heat generation and therefore the higher the<br>
hysteresis on dynamic stress within the rubber mixture, the<br>
expected rolling resistance therefore being poorer. The<br>
rolling-resistance index is therefore calculated as follows<br>
for each carbon black within the respective carbon black<br>
group:<br>
Rolling-resistance index = (needle temperature of reference<br>
carbon black within the group / needle temperature) * 100.<br>
A rolling-resistance index &gt; 100 therefore indicates<br>
improved, i.e. reduced, rolling resistance, and values<br>

respective reference carbon black within the group.<br>
The results in Table 6 show that each of the carbon blacks<br>
of the invention, with FP index &gt; 0, has a better balance<br>
of abrasion resistance and rolling resistance than the<br>
comparative carbon blacks with FP index 
of a balanced general vulcanizate property profile.<br>
Example 3 (vulcanizate testing in ESBR):<br>
Table 7 below gives the formulation used for the ESBR<br>
mixtures.<br>
Table 7:<br>
<br>
Krynol® 1712 ESBR is an ESBR from Lanxess AG, extended with<br>
37.5 phr of oil.<br>
Vulcanization accelerator Vulkacit® CZ/EG-C is CBS from<br>
Lanxess AG. Vulcanization accelerator Perkacit TBZTD-PDR-D<br>
is TBZTD from Flexsys N.V.<br>
The rubber mixtures are produced in an internal mixer in<br>
accordance with the mixing specification in Table 8.<br>
Table 9 shows the results of vulcanizate testing. The I<br>
vulcanization time for the mixtures is 13 minutes. I<br>
The reference carbon black within group 5 is comparative<br>
carbon black 1, the reference carbon black within group 6<br>
is comparative carbon black 3, the reference carbon black<br>
within group 7 is comparative carbon black 4 and the<br>
reference carbon black within group 8 is comparative carbon<br>
black 5.<br>
The results in Table 9 show that each of the carbon blacks<br>
of the invention, with FP index &gt; 0, has a better balance<br>
of abrasion resistance and rolling resistance than the<br>
comparative carbon blacks with FP index 
of a balanced general vulcanizate property profile.<br>
