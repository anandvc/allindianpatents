Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the technical field of network communications, in<br>
particular, to a method and a system for content charging.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
With the rapid development of the Internet, content services become more and more<br>
abundant. Correspondingly, Internet Content Providers (ICPs) for getting profit by providing<br>
contents come on the scene. By cooperating with the ICP, service providers may increase the<br>
income of the access service by expanding the scale of network users on one hand, and earn<br>
the profit sharing of content income of the ICP on the other hand. At the same time, the ICP<br>
may obtain a low-cost channel for selling its content service rapidly.<br>
The content platform of the service provider is developed on such background. The<br>
general mode of the content platform is as follows: The service provider provides a technical<br>
platform, and the ICP issues its content service via this platform. The service provider<br>
performs advertising, authentication, charging for the use of the content service via the<br>
platform. The user uses the content service provided by each ICP via the platform. The<br>
content platform records various fees caused by the user, and all of the fees will be recorded<br>
on a content account provided to the user by the service provider. With this content platform,<br>
the user does not need to settle accounts with each ICP; instead, the user only needs to settle<br>
accounts with the service provider.<br>
The existing content charging solution for this content platform is usually implemented as<br>
follows:<br>
A user connects to the network, logs in a portal website Portal Server, and connects to a<br>
Content Server of an ICP via a content channel. If the user is interested in a content provided<br>
by the ICP, then he/she clicks the button "OK", and the ICP Content Server will send an<br>
authentication request to the content platform of the service provider. If the authentication is<br>
passed, the right to use the content is assigned to the user and a charging start message is<br>
sent to the content platform.<br>
To ensure the accuracy of the charging, the Content Server of the ICP sends an<br><br>
intermediate charging message to the content platform at a certain time interval during<br>
the usage of the content. When the user logs out the Content Server, the Content Server of<br>
the ICP sends a charging completion message to the content platform.<br>
The content platform processes the charging message in real time, and performs rating<br>
and accounting on the content consumption of the user according to the information in the<br>
charging message such as service number, time length, traffic flow, etc., together with the<br>
charging policy of the service.<br>
In the prior art, strict requirements are laid on the interconnection technology between<br>
the content platform and the ICP. The ICP has to carry out customized development<br>
according to the content platform authentication and charging interface provided by the<br>
service provider, and joint debugging and testing should be performed after the<br>
development. Services may only be formally issued after the testing is passed Thus, the<br>
cost is very high.<br>
Some small-scale ICPs are weak in technical strength and they are not able to carry out<br>
customized development according to the charging interface. Some other ICPs purchase<br>
their service contents, such as multiplayer-fighting games, from other software company, so<br>
they have no source code for interface development, and are not able to implement content<br>
charging for such services.<br>
Quality of Service (QoS) is required for some content services. For example, Video On<br>
Demand (VOD) service requires a broad bandwidth. However, in the mode aforementioned,<br>
the bandwidth may not be dynamically adjusted according to the service, and it is<br>
disadvantageous for operation and management.<br>
In the actual operation of the ICP, it is difficult for the service provider to control the<br>
correctness of the service number, traffic flow and time length in the charging message, thus<br>
accurate charging may not be performed.<br>
US2002/066033 A1 discloses a method in which content resources are managed. A request<br>
is received from a user for access to a source of content resources. It is determined that the<br>
user is authorized for access to the source. A portal Web page is generated based on a set<br>
of content element data applicable to the subscriber. The portal Web page is returned to<br>
the user. It is further disclosed that a system for use in managing content resources has a<br>
switch for receiving requests from Web browsers, a content resource management engine in<br><br>
communication with the switch, and a billing system in communication with the content<br>
resource management engine.<br>
US 2004/254999 A1 discloses a content distribution system including a content source and a<br>
plurality of consumer networks including a controller and a consumer storage device. A<br>
distribution network couples the content source to the controllers of the consumer networks.<br>
The distribution network includes network storage devices and network processors. A grid<br>
computing platform includes the controllers, the network processors, the consumer storage<br>
devices and the network storage devices. The grid computing platform provides storage of<br>
the content across network storage devices and consumer storage devices and distribution<br>
of the content to one or more of the consumer networks.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
To make the principle, characteristics and advantages of the invention clearer, the<br>
invention will now be described in detail hereinafter in conjunction with the embodiments and<br>
the drawings of the invention.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the system for content charging according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention includes a Portal Server, a Policy Server, a Content Control Gateway (CCG) and a<br>
Content Server. Wherein, the Policy Server is connected with the Portal Server and the<br>
content control gateway, for delivering or canceling a service policy message, and performing<br>
rating and charging according to the service usage information reported by the CCG, such as<br>
traffic flow and time length. The CCG is connected with the Content Server, for controlling the<br>
access to the Content Server of the user, counting the service consumption information, and<br>
periodically reporting the related data to the Policy Server for charging. The Portal Server<br>
provides a portal for user access, and provides the user with functions such as login, service<br>
channel, service selection, self-help service. The Content Server is a server through which<br>
the ICP provides contents. There may be a plurality of Content Servers connected with a CCG,<br>
and various contents may also be issued on a Content Server. The servers on which the<br>
contents exist may be different, and the service ports of the contents, i.e. Transmission<br>
Control Protocol/User Data Protocol (TCP/UDP) ports may be different. The CCG<br>
distinguishes between the content data flows according to the server on which the contents<br>
exist or the service port of the content, and controls the content data flows and collects data<br>
respectively for executing the policy.<br>
The service policy message may be regarded as an indication message for the service<br>
data flow rules, which comprises parameters such as the source IP address, destination IP<br>
address, destination port, service resource information and traffic flow information of a<br>
network packet. For example, when a Content Server provides a game service, if a user<br>
wants to access the game server, the content of the corresponding service policy message<br>
may include the following information: the source IP address (which may be the IP address of<br>
the user), the IP address of the game server, the port of the game server (which may refer to<br>
the TCP/UDP port), the upstream bandwidth, the downstream bandwidth, the Universal<br><br>
Resource Locator (URL), etc. Thus, if the Policy Server delivers the policy and notifies the<br>
CCG, the CCG grants the user the right to access the game server after applying the policy. If<br>
the Policy Server instruct", the CCG to remove the policy, the current user will lose the right to<br>
access the game server.<br>
If the user wants to access a streaming server, the content of the corresponding service<br>
policy message may include the following information: the source IP address, the IP address<br>
of the streaming server, the port of the streaming server, the upstream bandwidth, the<br>
downstream bandwidth and the URL. The Policy Server delivers a policy and notifies the CCG,<br>
and the CCG grants the user the right to access the streaming server after applying the policy<br>
and reserves a designated bandwidth for the video/audio stream. If the Policy Server instructs<br>
the CCG to remove the policy, then the current user will lose the right to access the streaming<br>
server.<br>
Similarly, if the user wants to access a download server, the content of the corresponding<br>
service policy message may include the following information: the source IP address, the IP<br>
address of the download server, the port of the download server, the upstream bandwidth, the<br>
downstream bandwidth, and the path of the download file. The Policy Server delivers a policy<br>
and notifies the CCG, and the CCG grants the user the right to access the download server<br>
after applying the policy and reserves a designated download bandwidth. If the Policy Server<br>
instructs the CCG to delete the policy, then the current user will lose the right to access the<br>
download server.<br>
Each service and its corresponding service policy are stored in the form of a correlation<br>
table between the service and the service policy.<br>
The internal structure of the Policy Server is as shown in Figure 2, which may include a<br>
central control module, a charging engine, a portal interface module, a device interface<br>
module, a database interface module and a local memory database (Built-in-Memory).<br>
The central control module is the core module of the Policy Server, and is mainly<br>
responsible for scheduling and controlling other modules in the system. The central control<br>
module receives a service activation request sent from the portal interface module, converts it<br>
into a service policy message corresponding to the service, and sends the service policy<br><br>
message to the CCG via the device interface. If the policy is executed successfully, the CCG<br>
will periodically report the user service consumption information (mainly including time length<br>
and traffic flow information), and the central control module invokes the charging engine<br>
module for performing rating after receiving the original charging information from the device<br>
interface module.<br>
The portal interface is responsible for interconnecting with the Portal Server, sending the<br>
service activation request or the service deactivation request to the central control module,<br>
and returning the service request execution result to the Portal Server.<br>
The device interface module is responsible for interconnecting with the CCG, forwarding<br>
the policy information delivered by the central control module to the CCG, and reporting the<br>
policy execution information and service usage information to the central control module.<br>
The charging engine is the charging component of the Policy Server. The central control<br>
module invokes the charging engine for performing rating and accounting according to the<br>
user service consumption record.<br>
The database interface enables other subsystems to access the database and the<br>
memory database.<br>
The memory database is an optional component, which may be regarded as a buffer for<br>
the external database. The memory database is mainly adapted to store policy data, charging<br>
data, configuration data and user session data. By using the memory database, the<br>
performance of the system may be improved greatly. The central control module periodically<br>
sends an instruction to the memory database for reading the policy data, charging data,<br>
configuration data from the external database and refreshing the local memory data.<br>
The CCG is adapted to control the access to the Content Server of the user, count the<br>
service consumption information, and periodically report related data to the Policy Server for<br>
performing charging. As shown in Figure 3, the internal structure of the CCG includes a<br>
central control module, a flow classification module, a content filtration module, a charging<br>
collection module and an interface module.<br>
The central control module is responsible for receiving the policy sent from the Policy<br>
Server and interpreting and executing the policy. During the execution of the policy, the<br><br>
central control module needs to interact with and control the flow classification module, the<br>
content filtration module and the charging collection module.<br>
The flow classification module checks, classifies and controls the information such as the<br>
source IP, the destination IP, the destination port of the network packet, on the IP layer. The<br>
network flow that conforms to the policy may pass.<br>
The content filtration module checks, classifies and controls the resources to be accessed<br>
by the network packet, such as the URL address applied by the HTTP, the file path applied by<br>
the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and the RTICP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) path applied<br>
by the stream media, on the application layer. The network flow that conforms to the policy<br>
may pass.<br>
The charging collection module collects the time length and the traffic flow information of<br>
the network flow, and reports the original charging data to the central control module. The<br>
central control module reports the original charging data to the Policy Server.<br>
In the method according to an embodiment of the invention, Portal Server receives a<br>
service request from a user, and sends a service activation request to Policy Server. The<br>
Policy Server determines the corresponding service policy message according to the service<br>
after receiving the service activation request, and delivers the service policy message to CCG.<br>
The CCG executes the policy message, permits the user to use the service, and periodically<br>
reports the user service consumption information to the Policy Server. The Policy Server<br>
performs rating and charging according to the consumption information.<br>
Specifically, as shown in Figure 4, the method includes following steps.<br>
(1)	A user sends a login request to the Portal Server, and the Portal Server authenticates<br>
the identity of the user.<br>
(2)	If the authentication is passed, the Portal Server receives the service selection data<br>
input by the user.<br>
(3)	The Portal Server sends a service activation request, which carries information such<br>
as the user IP, destination IP, service resources, to the Policy Server.<br>
(4)	The Policy Server determines the corresponding service policy message according to<br><br>
the service after receiving the service activation request, and delivers the service policy<br>
message to the CCG. Each service and its corresponding service policy are stored in the form<br>
of a correlation table between the service and the service policy. This table may be stored on<br>
the Policy Server or on a third party device. The Policy Server determines the policy<br>
corresponding to the service by querying the correlation table according to the activation<br>
request, extracts the parameters needed by the policy according to the activation request and<br>
the service policy, fills the parameters in the policy message and delivers the policy message.<br>
For example, for a game service, the content of the corresponding service policy message<br>
may include the following information: the source IP address (which may be the IP address of<br>
the user), the IP address of the game server, the port of the game server (which may refer to<br>
the TCP/UDP port), the upstream bandwidth, the downstream bandwidth and the URL.<br>
(5)	The CCG receives the service policy message, executes the service policy according<br>
to the instruction of the message, releases the access right from the user IP (which may be a<br>
source IP) to the destination IP destination port or destination URL, and controls the network<br>
flow according to the bandwidth parameters in the policy. The CCG sends the policy<br>
execution result to the Policy Server after executing the policy.<br>
(6)	The Policy server informs the Portal Server of the service activation result.<br>
(7)	The Portal Server displays the service activation result to the user.<br>
(8)	If the service is activated, the user starts an application client end and performs<br>
content consumption, after knowing from the Portal Server that the service is available.<br>
(9)	The CCG periodically reports the service consumption information to the Policy Server<br>
during the content service used by the user.<br><br>
(10)	The Policy Server processes the service consumption information reported by the<br>
CCG in real time, and performs rating for the user content consumption.<br>
(11)	The Portal Server receives a request for stopping the service from the user when the<br>
user wants to logout the Content Server<br>
(12)	The Portal Server sends a service deactivation request to the Policy Server.<br>
(13)	The Policy Server delivers a policy cancellation request to the CCG.<br><br>
(14)	The CCG cancels the policy and returns the policy cancellation result to the Policy<br>
server.<br>
(15)	The Policy server informs the Portal Server of the service cancellation result.<br>
(16)	The Portal Server displays the service cancellation result to the user.<br>
(17)	The CCG reports the last service consumption information of the user to the Policy<br>
Server.<br>
(18)	The Policy Server processes the service consumption information, performs rating,<br>
and settles accounts on the current content consumption according to each rating<br>
information.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the content control gateway does not need to<br>
periodically report the user service consumption information to the Policy Server. Instead, the<br>
content control gateway reports the total service consumption information of the user to the<br>
Policy Server at a time after receiving the policy cancellation request delivered by the Policy<br>
Server. The Policy Server performs rating and accounting according to the consumption<br>
information.<br>
The invention provides a novel content charging solution, by means of which the<br>
interconnection difficulty and the interconnection cost between the ICP Content Server and<br>
the content platform of the service provider may be lowered greatly, and the ICP may be<br>
effectively prevented from falsifying data, and accurate charging data may be provided. In the<br>
meanwhile, the corresponding network QoS may be ensured according to the requirements<br>
of a certain content service.<br><br>
