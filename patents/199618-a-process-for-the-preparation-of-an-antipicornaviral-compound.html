				<td>RELATED APPLICATION DATA:<br>
This application relates to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/150,358, filed on August 24,1999.<br>
This application also relates to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/150,365 (Attorney Docket No. 0125.0027), also filed August 24, 1999, entitled "Efficient Methods For The Preparation Of Rhinovirus Protease Inhibitors, Key Intermediates And A Continuous Membrane Reactor Useful For The Preparation Of The Same" having named as inventors: J. Tao, S. Babu, R. Dagnino, Jr., Q. Tian, T. Remarchuk, K. McGee, N. Nayyar, and T. Moran. The aforementioned application also relates to synthetic routes for the preparation of rhinovirus protease inhibitors, as well as key intermediates useful in their preparation. The above-mentioned applications are relied upon and incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of ethyl-3-{(5'-methylisoxazole-3'-carbonyl)-L-Val(COCH2)-L-(4-F-Phe)-L-((S)-Pyrrol-Ala)}-E-propanoate, (also referred to as AG7088), its analogs and of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The present invention also includes a novel group of key intermediate compounds to be used in the above process. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Picomaviruses are a family of tiny non-enveloped positive-stranded RNA-containing viruses that infect humans and other animals. These viruses include the<br>
human rhinoviruses, human polioviruses, human coxsackieviruses, human echoviruses, human and bovine enteroviruses, encephalomyocarditis viruses, meningitis viruses, foot and mouth viruses, hepatitis A virus, and others. The human rhinoviruses are a major cause of the common cold.<br>
Proteolytic 3C enzymes are required for the natural maturation of the picomaviruses. Thus, inhibiting the activity of these proteolytic 3C enzymes should represent an important and useful approach for the treatment and cure of viral infections of this nature, including the common cold.<br>
Some small-molecule inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of picomaviral 3C protease (i.e., antipicornaviral compounds) have been recently discovered. See, for example: U.S. Patent Application No. 08/850,398, filed May 2, 1997, by Webber et al.; U.S. Patent Application No. 08/991,282, filed December 16, 1997, by Dragovich et al.; and U.S. Patent Application No. 08/991,739, filed December 16, 1997, by Webber et al. These U.S. patent applications, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, describe certain antipicornaviral compounds and methods for their synthesis.<br>
More recently, an especially potent group of antipicornaviral agents have been discovered as set forth in U.S. Patent Application No. 60/098,354, (the '354 application) filed August 28, 1998, by Dragovich et al., which is herein incorporated by reference. This application discloses, inter alias, a group of antipicornaviral agents of general formula I. A particularly promising compound, AG7088, falling within the scope of this group, exhibits excellent antiviral properties against a plethora of Rhinoviral serotypes and is currently in human clinical trials. The '354 application also discloses methods and intermediates useful for synthesizing these compounds.<br>
For example, General Method V therein discloses a general method for synthesizing the compounds of formula I involving subjecting a carboxylic acid of general formula BB to an amide-forming reaction with an amine of general formula P to provide a final product CC, as shown below.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The '354 application further discloses methods for synthesizing the intermediates of general formulae BB and P, and teaches methods for carrying out the amide-forming reaction referred to above. Thus, the '354 application teaches suitable methods for synthesizing the compounds of general formula I from a carboxylic acid BB (within the scope of the compounds of general formula II referred to below) and the compounds of general formula P (the same as the compounds of general formula HI referred to below.) Similarly, two recent publications by Dragovich et al. disclose antipicornavirus agents and suitable synthetic methods for their synthesis. See<br>
Structure-Based Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Irreversable Human Rhinovirus 3C Proteases Inhibitors. 3. StructureActivity Studies of Ketomethylene-Containing Peptidomimetics, Dragovich et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, ASAP, 1999; and Structure-Based Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Irreversable Human Rhinovirus 3C Proteases Tnhibitors. 4. Incorporation of Pi Lactam Moieties as L-Glutamine Replacements, Dragovich et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, ASAP, 1999. These aforementioned articles are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
However, there is still a desire to discover improved, more efficient, processes and novel intermediates for use in the syntheses of the compounds of the group of antipicornaviral agents. In particular, there is a need for improved methods for synthesizing the compounds of general formulae JJ and III. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to the discovery of a cost effective and efficient process for the preparation of the antipicornaviral agents of formula I, such as compound AG7088, as well as intermediates which are useful in that synthesis. The antipicornaviral agents of formula I comprise:<br>

or Z and Zj, together with the atoms to which they are bonded, form a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl group, where Z and Z\ are as defined above except for moieties that cannot form the cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl group.<br>
As discussed below, these antipicomaviral agents of formula I may be synthesized by subjecting a compound of general formula II together with a compound<br>
of general formula III to a suitable amide-forming reaction. The process of the present invention, not only reduces the number of steps required to synthesize the compound of formula III, but more importantly, it also employs less expensive starting materials and reagents.<br>

The phases were separated and the aqueous phase was charged with 2.0 kg of sodium chloride and 4.0 L of ethyl acetate. The phases were separated, and<br>
the organic phases were combined, washed with brine (1X370 L), concentrated on a rotary evaporator to afford a crude material (440 g), which was used directly in the following hydrolysis reaction. To a solution of the crude material (440 g, 1 equiv.) in methanol (800 mL) was added/?-toluensulfonic acid monohydrate (4.0 g, 0.015 equiv.). The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (2.0 L), washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate (2X100 mL). The combined aqueous phases were extracted with ethyl acetate (2X200 mL). All the organic phases were combined, concentrated on a rotary evaporator to afford 275 g of the crude product, which was charged with a solution of 2.5% methanol (20 mL) in water (780 mL) and stirred at ambient temperature overnight. The granular solid (chiral auxiliary) was removed by filtration and the filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (1.5L), dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to afford a viscous oil. The oil was further purified through a titration process using 1: 1 ethyl acetate (1 L) and hexanes (1 L) to afford 5 as a white solid (104 g, 47% overall yield from 4). Preparation of 5 from 9 (Scheme 3)<br>
To a stirring solution of 9 (1.75 g, 6.10 mmol) in THF (40 mL) was added LLBH4 (270 mg, 12.2 mmol, 2 equiv.) in several portions at 0°C in an Argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 10 minutes, then allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirred for additional 2 hours. The reaction was quenched by the dropwise addition of 0.5 M HCl (24 mL) with cooling in an ice bath (Note: formation of gases was observed). The solution was diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL) and H2O (50 mL). The phases were split, and the aqueous layer was<br><br>
extracted with ethyl acetate (6 x 150 mL). The combined organic phases were dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated on rotovapor to give a light brown oil. Flash chromatography afforded a white solid (5, 1.308 g, 5.06 mmol, 83%): 1H NMR (CDC13) δ 1.46 (s, 9 H), 1.61-1.67 (m, 1 H), 1.82-1.91 (m, 1 H), 1.94-2,00 (m, 1 H), 2.43-2.48 (m, 1 H), 2.49-2.55 (m, 1 H), 3.32-3.34 (m, 3 H), 3.58-3.66 (m, 2 H), 3.68-3.79 (m, 2 H), 5.47 (d, J= 7.0 Hz, 1 H), 6.24 (s, 1 H); 13C NMR (CDCl3) δ 28.8, 32.9, 38.4, 40.8, 51.5, 66.3, 79.8, 157.0, 181.3; HRMS m/z 258.1652 (calculated for C13H22N2O5, 258.1650). Preparation of 1 from 5 Procedure A (Scheme 2)<br>
To a solution of 5 (50.0 g, 0.184 mol, 1 equiv.) methylsulfoxide (500 mL) was added triethylamine (116 mL). The resulting solution was cooled to 5°C with an ice bath, followed by addition of sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex (132 g). The reaction was stirred at that temperature for 15 min. The cold bath was removed and the reaction was stirred for additional 1 hour. (Carboethoxymethylenetriphenyl)-phosphorane (112 g) was added in one lot and the reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 3 hours. The reaction was quenched by addition of saturated brine (3.0 L), extracted with ethyl acetate (3X1.5 L). The combined organic phases were washed with saturated brine (3X1.5 L), dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to afford a dark red oil. The oil was purified through a chromatography, followed by a titration process using ethyl acetate (60 mL) and excess of hexanes (240 mL). 1 was obtained as a white solid (36.0 g, 60%). Procedure B (Scheme 3)<br>
To a solution of 5 (1.0 g, 3.87 mmol, 1 equiv.) in CH2Cl2 (80 mL) was added benzoic acid (1.89 g, 15.5 mmol., 4 equiv.),<br>
(carboethoxymethylenetriphenyl)phosphorane (5.39g, 15.5 mmol, 4 equiv.) and DMSO (4.8 mL). Dess-Martin periodinane (4.1 g, 9.17 mmol, 2.5 equiv.) was added in several portions to the solution, and the reaction mixture was then stirred for 5 hours at ambient temperature until the disappearance of the starting material 5. Saturated NaHCC&gt;3 solution was added, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. A white solid precipitated out, which was then filtered off. The organic phase of the filtrate was separated, washed with brine (250 mL), and concentrated on rotovapor to give a brown oil, which was purified by flash chromatography to produce a light brown foam (0.956 g). The foam was dissolved in ethyl acetate (3 mL). Excess hexanes (12 mL) was added gradually to the stirring solution and a white solid precipitated out. The solid was filtered and dried in vacuum oven overnight to afford 1 (0.69g, 2.11 mmol, 55%). Chiral HPLC: 97% pure, 98% de and 100% E isomer; 1H NMR (CDC13) δ 1.22 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 3 H), 1.38 (s, 9 H), 1.53-1.58 (m, 1 H), 1.66-1.84 (m, 1H), 1.85-2.00 (m, 1 H), 2.30-2.50 (m, 2 H), 3.20-3.37 (m, 2H), 4.13 (q, J= 7.2 Hz, 2 H), 4.20-4.35 (m, 1 H), 5.13 (d, J= 7.5 Hz, 1 H), 5.68 (s, 1 H), 5.90 (dd, J = 1.8, 15.6 Hz, 1 H), 6.80 (dd, J = 5.1, 15.6 Hz, 1 H); HRMS m/z 326.1846 (calculated for C^NjOe, 326.1840). Preparation of AG7088 from 1 and 2 (Scheme 1).<br>
751 mg of compound 1 was dissolved in DCM (10 mL/g of 1) in a single neck round bottom flask and cover with a septum. The flask was then purged with nitrogen followed by the addition of 1.4 mL TFA via syringe while the solution was being stirred. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC using 5% MeOH in DCM until after about 4 hours the starting material disappeared. The solvent and excess<br>
TFA were "removed under vacuum at pressure of 
Compounds 1A and 2 were dissolved in DMF (7 mL/g of 2) in a single neck flask covered with a septum and fitted with a temperature probe. The flask was purged with nitrogen. The resulting solution was divided into two portions. In a first portion was added 1.6 mL n-methylrnorpholine via syringe and cooled to 0°C ± 5°C. In a second portion of the solution 281 mg CDMT was dissolved. This CDMT solution was then added dropwise via syringe to the first portion of the solution, maintaining the reaction temperature of 0°C ± 5°C. The resulting reaction mixture was then allowed to warm to room temperature. The reaction was monitored for about 1 hour by TLC (7:3:1 hexanes:EtOAc:IPA) until the compound 2 disappeared. Once the reaction was complete the product AG7088 was precipitated out of solution by the slow addition of water to reaction mixture. The resulting slurry was filtered to obtain a yield of &gt;85% white granular crystals of compound AG7088 having a purity of &gt;97%. The product may then be recrystallized by dissolving it in hot MeOH:EtOAc 1:1 followed by slow addition of hexanes (2 vols.)<br>
