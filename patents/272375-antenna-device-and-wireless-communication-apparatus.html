ANTENNA DEVICE AND WIRELESS COMMUNICATION APPARATUS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an antenna device and a<br>
wireless communication apparatus that are capable of varying a<br>
resonant frequency over a certain range.<br>
Background Art<br>
As an antenna device of this type, for example, a<br>
frequency-variable antenna disclosed in Patent Document 1 has<br>
been available. The antenna device has a configuration in which<br>
a feed electrode and a single radiation electrode are formed on<br>
a substrate and a single frequency-variable circuit is disposed<br>
between the feed electrode and the radiation electrode.<br>
With this configuration, varying a control voltage to be<br>
applied to a variable-capacitance diode contained in the<br>
frequency-variable circuit varies a resonant frequency of the<br>
antenna.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2006-060384<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
However, the above-described antenna device has the<br>
problems described below.<br>
Since the antenna device includes a feed electrode, a<br>
frequency-variable circuit, and a single radiation electrode,<br>
only a single resonant frequency can be obtained. In addition,<br>
 <br>
although the resonant frequency can be varied using the<br>
frequency-variable circuit, since the frequency-variable<br>
circuit, which has only a single variable-capacitance diode, is<br>
used, the resonant frequency cannot be varied over a wide range.<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, an object<br>
of the present invention is to provide an antenna device and a<br>
wireless communication apparatus that are capable of obtaining<br>
a plurality of resonant frequencies and varying the plurality<br>
of resonant frequencies over a wide range.<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, according<br>
to the invention of Claim 1, an antenna device includes a first<br>
antenna unit including a feed electrode connected to a feed unit,<br>
a first radiation electrode, and a first frequency-variable<br>
circuit connected between the first radiation electrode and the<br>
feed electrode; and a second antenna unit including the feed<br>
electrode, a second radiation electrode, and a second<br>
frequency-variable circuit connected between the second<br>
radiation electrode and the feed electrode. The first<br>
frequency-variable circuit includes a first reactance circuit<br>
connected to the feed electrode, the first reactance circuit<br>
including a first variable-capacitance diode whose capacitance<br>
is variable using a control voltage; and a second reactance<br>
circuit connected between the first reactance circuit and the<br>
first radiation electrode, the second reactance circuit<br>
including a second variable-capacitance diode whose capacitance<br>
 <br>
is variable using the control voltage. The second<br>
frequency-variable circuit includes the first reactance circuit;<br>
and a third reactance circuit connected between the first<br>
reactance circuit and the second radiation electrode, the third<br>
reactance circuit including a third variable-capacitance diode<br>
whose capacitance is variable using the control voltage.<br>
With this configuration, when electric power is supplied<br>
from the feed unit to the feed electrode, the first antenna unit<br>
resonates with electric power at a frequency and transmits an<br>
electric wave at the frequency. In addition, the second antenna<br>
unit resonates with electric power at a frequency that is<br>
different from the resonant frequency of the first antenna unit<br>
and transmits an electric wave at the different frequency. That<br>
is, the antenna device according to the present invention is<br>
capable of achieving a two-resonant state exhibiting a resonant<br>
frequency of the first antenna unit and a resonant frequency of<br>
the second antenna unit. In addition, since the capacitance of<br>
the second variable-capacitance diode of the second reactance<br>
circuit, as well as the capacitance of the first<br>
variable-capacitance diode of the first reactance circuit, can<br>
be varied using a control voltage, a large reactance change for<br>
two variable-capacitance diodes can be achieved by the first<br>
frequency-variable circuit. As a result, the resonant frequency<br>
of the first antenna unit can be varied over a wide range. In<br>
addition, since the capacitance of the first<br>
 <br>
variable-capacitance diode of the first reactance circuit and<br>
the capacitance of the third variable-capacitance diode of the<br>
third reactance circuit are controlled using the control voltage,<br>
a large reactance change for two variable-capacitance diodes can<br>
be achieved by the second frequency-variable circuit. As a<br>
result, the resonant frequency of the second antenna unit can<br>
also be varied over a wide range.<br>
According to the invention of Claim 2, in the antenna device<br>
according to Claim 1, the second variable-capacitance diode of<br>
the second reactance circuit and the third variable-capacitance<br>
diode of the third reactance circuit may be disposed so as to<br>
associate with the first variable-capacitance diode of the first<br>
reactance circuit, cathodes of the first to third<br>
variable-capacitance diodes may be connected to each other, and<br>
the control voltage may be applied to a portion where the cathodes<br>
are connected to each other.<br>
With this configuration, the three variable-capacitance<br>
diodes of the first to third variable-capacitance diodes can be<br>
varied at the same time using the control voltage.<br>
According to the invention of Claim 3, in the antenna device<br>
according to Claim 1 or 2, the first reactance circuit may be<br>
a series resonant circuit or a parallel resonant circuit<br>
including the first variable-capacitance diode, the second<br>
reactance circuit may be a series resonant circuit or a parallel<br>
resonant circuit including the second variable-capacitance diode,<br>
 <br>
and the third reactance circuit may be a series resonant circuit<br>
or a parallel resonant circuit including the third<br>
variable-capacitance diode.<br>
With this configuration, when all the first to third<br>
reactance circuits are configured as series resonant circuits,<br>
a large gain can be obtained without greatly increasing variable<br>
ranges of the resonant frequency of the first antenna unit and<br>
the resonant frequency of the second antenna unit. When all the<br>
first to third reactance circuits are configured as parallel<br>
resonant circuits, variable ranges of the resonant frequency of<br>
the first antenna unit and the resonant frequency of the second<br>
antenna unit can be increased although a large gain is not obtained<br>
Thus, when at least one of the first to third reactance circuits<br>
is configured as a series resonant circuit and the others of the<br>
first to third reactance circuits are configured as parallel<br>
resonant circuits, the amount of change in the resonant frequency<br>
of the first antenna unit can be made different from the amount<br>
of change in the resonant frequency of the second antenna unit.<br>
According to the invention of Claim 4, in the antenna device<br>
according to Claim 3, each of the first to third reactance circuits<br>
may be configured as a parallel resonant circuit in which a coil<br>
is connected in parallel to a series circuit including the<br>
corresponding variable-capacitance diode, and at least one of<br>
the coils of the first to third reactance circuits may be set<br>
as a choke coil and the corresponding reactance circuit including<br>
 <br>
the coil may serve substantially as a series resonant circuit.<br>
With this configuration, when the coil of the parallel<br>
resonant circuit is used as a choke coil, a reactance circuit<br>
including the coil is substantially capable of serving as a series<br>
resonant circuit. Thus, design can be easily changed without<br>
requiring reconfiguration of a parallel resonant circuit portion<br>
into a series resonant circuit.<br>
According to the invention of Claim 5, in the antenna device<br>
according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, an internal resistance<br>
of at least one of the first to third variable-capacitance diodes<br>
may be different from internal resistances of the others of the<br>
first to third variable-capacitance diodes. When the internal<br>
resistance of a variable-capacitance diode is reduced, although<br>
a gain is increased, a variable-capacitance range becomes<br>
narrower. In contrast, when the internal resistance is increased,<br>
although a gain is reduced, a variable capacitance range becomes<br>
wider. Thus, with this configuration, when the internal<br>
resistance of at least one of the first to third<br>
variable-capacitance diodes is made different from the internal<br>
resistances of the others of the first to third<br>
variable-capacitance diodes while considering which of a<br>
frequency variable range or a gain is to be emphasized,<br>
characteristics of the first antenna unit and the second antenna<br>
unit can be obtained according to the situation.<br>
According to the invention of Claim 6, in the antenna device<br>
 <br>
according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, at least the first antenna<br>
unit may be formed on a dielectric substrate.<br>
With this configuration, the capacitance of at least the<br>
first antenna unit can be increased, and the reactance of the<br>
first antenna unit can be increased.<br>
According to the invention of Claim 7, in the antenna device<br>
according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, an additional radiation<br>
electrode may be connected to a stage subsequent to the first<br>
reactance circuit, which is connected to the feed electrode, and<br>
an additional antenna unit may be formed by the additional<br>
radiation electrode, the feed electrode, and the first reactance<br>
circuit, which is a frequency-variable circuit.<br>
With this configuration, the resonant frequency of the<br>
additional antenna unit, as well as the resonant frequencies of<br>
the first and second antenna units, can be obtained. Thus,<br>
electric waves of more resonant frequencies can be handled. In<br>
addition, the resonant frequencies of the first and second<br>
antenna unit and the resonant frequency of the additional antenna<br>
unit can be varied at the same time.<br>
According to the invention of Claim 8, in the antenna device<br>
according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, a plurality of additional<br>
antenna units may be provided, and in at least one of the plurality<br>
of additional antenna units, an additional reactance circuit<br>
including a variable-capacitance diode whose capacitance is<br>
variable using the control voltage may be connected between the<br>
 <br>
first reactance circuit and the corresponding additional<br>
radiation electrode, and a frequency-variable circuit of the at<br>
least one of the plurality of additional antenna units may be<br>
formed by the additional reactance circuit and the first<br>
reactance circuit.<br>
With this configuration, since the frequency-variable<br>
circuit of the additional antenna unit is formed by the additional<br>
reactance circuit and the first reactance circuit, the resonant<br>
frequency of the additional antenna unit can be varied over a<br>
wide range.<br>
A wireless communication apparatus according to Claim 9<br>
includes the antenna device according to any one of Claims 1 to<br>
8.<br>
As described above, since the antenna device according to<br>
the present invention includes a plurality of antenna units, an<br>
excellent advantage of obtaining a plurality of resonant<br>
frequencies can be achieved. Moreover, since a<br>
frequency-variable circuit of each of the plurality of antenna<br>
units includes two reactance circuits each including a<br>
variable-capacitance diode, a large reactance change for two<br>
variable-capacitance diodes can be achieved. As a result, the<br>
resonant frequency of each of the plurality of antenna units can<br>
be varied over a wider range.<br>
In addition, in the antenna device according to the<br>
invention of Claim 3, a large gain can be obtained when all the<br>
 <br>
first to third reactance circuits are configured as series<br>
resonant circuit, and a wide variable range of a resonant<br>
frequency can be achieved when all the first to third reactance<br>
circuits are configured as parallel resonant circuits . When both<br>
a series resonant circuit and a parallel resonant circuit are<br>
used, the amount of change in the resonant frequency and the gain<br>
of the first antenna unit can be made different from the amount<br>
of change in the resonant frequency and the gain of the second<br>
antenna unit. As a result, optimal characteristics can be<br>
achieved according to the use state.<br>
In addition, in the antenna device according to the<br>
invention of Claim 4, there is no need to reconfigure a parallel<br>
resonant circuit portion into a series resonant circuit. Thus,<br>
a design change from a parallel resonant circuit into a series<br>
resonant circuit can be performed easily.<br>
In addition, in the antenna device according to the<br>
invention of Claim 5, characteristics of the first antenna unit<br>
and the second antenna unit can be obtained according to the<br>
situation.<br>
In addition, in the antenna device according to claim 6,<br>
the reactance of at least the first antenna unit can be increased.<br>
Thus, the resonant frequency of the first antenna unit can be<br>
reduced.<br>
In addition, in the antenna device according to the<br>
invention of Claim 7, a larger number of resonances can be obtained<br>
 <br>
Moreover, the resonant frequencies can be varied at the same time.<br>
In particular, according to the invention of Claim 8, the<br>
resonant frequencies of the additional antenna units can be<br>
varied over a wide range.<br>
In addition, in the wireless communication apparatus<br>
according to the invention of Claim 9, transmission and reception<br>
can be performed such that a frequency change can be achieved<br>
over a wide range for multi-resonances.<br>

The best mode for carrying out the present invention will<br>

First Embodiment<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view showing an antenna device<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
An antenna device 1 according to this embodiment is provided<br>
in a wireless communication apparatus, such as a cellular phone.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the antenna device 1 is formed in a<br>
 <br>
non-ground region 101 of a circuit board 100 of the wireless<br>
communication apparatus. The antenna device 1 transfers<br>
high-frequency signals to and from a transmitter/receiver 110,<br>
which is provided in a ground region 102 and serves as a power-feed<br>
unit. A reception-frequency controller 120 provided in the<br>
transmitter/receiver 110 applies a direct-current control<br>
voltage Vc to the antenna device 1.<br>
The antenna device 1 includes a first antenna unit 2 and<br>
a second antenna unit 3.<br>
The first antenna unit 2 includes a feed electrode 4, a<br>
first radiation electrode 5, and a first frequency-variable<br>
circuit 6-1 connected between the feed electrode 4 and the first<br>
radiation electrode 5.<br>
More specifically, a matching circuit including coils 111<br>
and 112 is formed in the non-ground region 101, and the feed<br>
electrode 4, which is a conductive pattern, is connected to the<br>
transmitter/receiver 110 through the matching circuit.<br>
The first radiation electrode 5 is a conductive pattern<br>
having a loop shape. An open end 50 of the first radiation<br>
electrode 5 faces the feed electrode 4 with a gap G therebetween.<br>
The gap G causes a capacitance between the feed electrode 4 and<br>
the first radiation electrode 5. By varying the size of the gap<br>
G, the reactance of the first antenna unit 2 can be set to a desired<br>
value. A ground coil 51, which is provided for resonant frequency<br>
adjusting, is connected in the middle of the first radiation<br>
 <br>
electrode 5.<br>
The first frequency-variable circuit 6-1 includes a first<br>
reactance circuit 6A (represented by "jX1" in Fig. 1) , which is<br>
connected to the feed electrode 4, and a second reactance circuit<br>
6B (represented by "jX2" in Fig. 1), which is connected between<br>
the first reactance circuit 6A and the first radiation electrode<br>
5. The first reactance circuit 6A includes a first<br>
variable-capacitance diode, which is not shown. When a control<br>
voltage Vc is applied to the first variable-capacitance diode,<br>
the capacitance of the first variable-capacitance diode<br>
increases or decreases, resulting in a change in the reactance<br>
of the first reactance circuit 6A.<br>
The second reactance circuit 6B includes a second<br>
variable-capacitance diode, which is not shown. When a control<br>
voltage Vc is applied to the second variable-capacitance diode,<br>
the capacitance of the second variable-capacitance diode<br>
increases or decreases, resulting in a change in the reactance<br>
of the second reactance circuit 6B.<br>
A connection point P between the first reactance circuit<br>
6A and the second reactance circuit 6B is connected to the<br>
reception-frequency controller 120 through a high-frequency<br>
cutoff resistor 121 and a DC-pass capacitor 122.<br>
With this configuration, when the reception-frequency<br>
controller 120 applies a control voltage Vc to the connection<br>
point P, the reactances of the first and second reactance circuits<br>
 <br>
6A and 6B increase or decrease in accordance with the size of<br>
the control voltage Vc, resulting in a change in the reactance<br>
of the entire first frequency-variable circuit 6-1, as described<br>
above. That is, applying the control voltage Vc to the first<br>
frequency-variable circuit 6-1 varies the electrical length of<br>
the first antenna unit 2, thus varying the resonant frequency<br>
of the first antenna unit 2.<br>
The second antenna unit 3 includes the feed electrode 4,<br>
a second radiation electrode 7, and a second frequency-variable<br>
circuit 6-2 connected between the feed electrode 4 and the second<br>
radiation electrode 7.<br>
More specifically, the second radiation electrode 7 is a<br>
conductive pattern having a line shape. A ground coil 71, which<br>
is provided for resonant frequency adjusting, is connected to<br>
an end of the second radiation electrode 7.<br>
The second frequency-variable circuit 6-2 includes the<br>
first reactance circuit 6A and a third reactance circuit 6C<br>
(represented by "jX3" in Fig. 1) , which is connected between the<br>
first reactance circuit 6A and the second radiation electrode<br>
7.<br>
Similarly to the first reactance circuit 6A, the third<br>
reactance circuit 6C includes a third variable-capacitance diode,<br>
which is not shown. When a control voltage Vc is applied to the<br>
third variable-capacitance diode, the capacitance of the third<br>
variable-capacitance diode increases or decreases, resulting in<br>
 <br>
a change in the reactance of the third reactance circuit 6C.<br>
The third reactance circuit 6C is also connected to the<br>
connection point P between the first reactance circuit 6A and<br>
the second reactance circuit 6B. When the reception-frequency<br>
controller 120 applies a control voltage Vc to the connection<br>
point P, the reactances of the first and third reactance circuits<br>
6A and 6C increase or decrease in accordance with the size of<br>
the control voltage Vc, resulting in a change in the reactance<br>
of the entire second frequency-variable circuit 6-2. That is,<br>
applying the control voltage Vc to the second frequency-variable<br>
circuit 6-2 varies the electrical length of the second antenna<br>
unit 3, thus varying the resonant frequency of the second antenna<br>
unit 3.<br>
Operations and advantages of the antenna device according<br>
to this embodiment will be described.<br>
Fig. 2 is a chart illustrating a variable state of two<br>
resonances.<br>
As described above, the first antenna unit 2 includes the<br>
feed electrode 4, the first frequency-variable circuit 6-1, and<br>
the first radiation electrode 5, and the second antenna unit 3<br>
includes the feed electrode 4, the second frequency-variable<br>
circuit 6-2, and the second radiation electrode 7. With this<br>
configuration, a two-resonant state exhibiting a resonant<br>
frequency f 1 of the first antenna unit 2 and a resonant frequency<br>
f2 of the second antenna unit 3 can be achieved.<br>
 <br>
For example, when the length of the first radiation<br>
electrode 5 is set to be longer than the length of the second<br>
radiation electrode 7, the resonant frequency f1 of the first<br>
antenna unit 2 is lower than the resonant frequency f2 of the<br>
second antenna unit 3. In this case, a return-loss curve S1<br>
represented by a solid line shown in Fig. 2 is obtained.<br>
When a control voltage Vc is applied to the first<br>
frequency-variable circuit 6-1, the reactances of the first and<br>
second reactance circuits 6A and 6B increase or decrease in<br>
accordance with the size of the control voltage Vc, resulting<br>
in a change in the reactance of the entire first<br>
frequency-variable circuit 6-1. Thus, the electrical length of<br>
the first antenna unit 2 is changed, and the resonant frequency<br>
fl of the first antenna unit 2 is changed.<br>
In parallel to this, the reactances of the first and third<br>
reactance circuits 6A and 6C of the second frequency-variable<br>
circuit 6-2 also increase or decrease in accordance with the size<br>
of the control voltage Vc, resulting in a change in the reactance<br>
of the entire second frequency-variable circuit 6-2. Thus, the<br>
electrical length of the second antenna unit 3 is changed, and<br>
the resonant frequency f2 of the second antenna unit 3 is changed.<br>
As a result, as shown by a return-loss curve S2 represented<br>
by a broken line shown in Fig. 2, the resonant frequency fl of<br>
the first antenna unit 2 moves by the amount of change d1, which<br>
corresponds to the size of the control voltage Vc, and reaches<br>
 <br>
a frequency f1'. At the same time, the resonant frequency f2<br>
of the second antenna unit 3 moves by the amount of change d2,<br>
which corresponds to the size of the control voltage Vc, and<br>
reaches a frequency f2'.<br>
At this time, the amount of change d1 (d2), by which the<br>
resonant frequency f1 (f2) is changed to the resonant frequency<br>
f1' (f2') by the first frequency-variable circuit 6-1 (the second<br>
frequency-variable circuit 6-2), is obtained not only from the<br>
amount of change in the capacitance of the first<br>
variable-capacitance diode included in the first reactance<br>
circuit 6A but also from the amount of change in the capacitance<br>
of the second variable-capacitance diode (the third<br>
variable-capacitance diode) included in the second reactance<br>
circuit 6B (the third reactance circuit 6C). Thus, the large<br>
amount of change dl (d2) can be obtained. As a result, the<br>
resonant frequency fl (f2) of the first antenna unit 2 (the second<br>
antenna unit 3) can be varied over a wide range.<br>
In the antenna device of the related art, only a single<br>
resonance appears and a resonant frequency is varied by a<br>
frequency-variable circuit including only a single<br>
variable-capacitance diode. Thus, in order to vary the resonant<br>
frequency over a wide range from fl to f2', as shown in Fig. 2,<br>
a large control voltage Vc is necessary. Such an antenna device<br>
is not suitable for a wireless communication apparatus, such as<br>
a cellular phone, which requires a lower voltage specification.<br>
 <br>
In contrast, in the antenna device 1 according to this<br>
embodiment, the resonant frequencies f1 and f2 in the<br>
two-resonant state can be varied at the same time by a<br>
predetermined control voltage Vc, as described above. Thus, a<br>
resonant frequency can be varied over a wide range from fl to<br>
f2' by the application of a low control voltage Vc. Thus, the<br>
antenna device 1 according to this embodiment is suitable for<br>
a wireless communication apparatus, such as a cellular phone,<br>
which requires a lower power-supply voltage.<br>
Second Embodiment<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic plan view showing an antenna device<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The antenna device according to this embodiment is provided<br>
in which a concrete series resonant circuit is applied to each<br>
of the first reactance circuit 6A, the second reactance circuit<br>
6B, and the third reactance circuit 6C used in the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the first reactance circuit 6A, the<br>
second reactance circuit 6B, and the third reactance circuit 6C<br>
are configured as a series resonant circuit including a first<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61A, a series resonant circuit<br>
including a second variable-capacitance diode 61B, and a series<br>
resonant circuit including a third variable-capacitance diode<br>
 <br>
61C, respectively.<br>
More specifically, a series resonant circuit including the<br>
first variable-capacitance diode 61A and a coil 62A is used as<br>
the first reactance circuit 6A. The coil 62A is connected to<br>
the feed electrode 4. The cathode of the first<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61A is connected to the connection<br>
point P. A series resonant circuit including the second<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61B and a coil 62B is used as the second<br>
reactance circuit 6B. The coil 62B is connected to the first<br>
radiation electrode 5. The cathode of the second<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61B is connected to the connection<br>
point P. A series resonant circuit including the third<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61C and a coil 62C is used as the third<br>
reactance circuit 6C. The coil 62C is connected to the second<br>
radiation electrode 7. The cathode of the third<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61C is connected to the connection<br>
point P.<br>
That is, the second variable-capacitance diode 61B of the<br>
second reactance circuit 6B and the third variable-capacitance<br>
diode 61C of the third reactance circuit 6C are disposed so as<br>
to associate with the first variable-capacitance diode 61A of<br>
the first reactance circuit 6A. The cathodes of the first to<br>
third variable-capacitance diodes 61A to 61C are connected to<br>
each other. A control voltage Vc is applied to a portion where<br>
the cathodes are connected to each other.<br>
 <br>
Operations and advantages of the antenna device according<br>
to this embodiment will be described.<br>
Fig. 4 is a chart illustrating a variable state of two<br>
resonances.<br>
As shown by a return-loss curve S1 represented by a solid<br>
line shown in Fig. 4, in the antenna device according to this<br>
embodiment, a two-resonant state exhibiting a resonant frequency<br>
f1 of the first antenna unit 2 and a resonant frequency f2 of<br>
the second antenna unit 3 can be achieved. Applying a control<br>
voltage Vc to each of the first frequency-variable circuit 6-1<br>
and the second frequency-variable circuit 6-2 varies the resonant<br>
frequency f 1 of the first antenna unit 2 and the resonant frequency<br>
f2 of the second antenna unit 3 at the same time.<br>
In the series resonant circuit including the first<br>
variable-capacitance diode and the coil, the reactance with<br>
respect to the control voltage Vc varies substantially linearly.<br>
Thus, although the amount of change dl (d2) from the resonant<br>
frequency f1 to the resonant frequency f1' (f2 to f2') by the<br>
first frequency-variable circuit 6-1 (the second<br>
frequency-variable circuit 6-2) is not very large, a large gain<br>
can be achieved. Consequently, in a case where all the first<br>
to third reactance circuits 6A to 6C are configured as series<br>
resonant circuits as in this embodiment, an antenna device in<br>
which a gain is emphasized can be achieved.<br>
Since the other configurations, operations, and advantages<br>
 <br>
of the antenna device according to this embodiment are similar<br>
to those of the antenna device according to the first embodiment,<br>
the description of those similar configurations, operations, and<br>
advantages will be omitted.<br>
Third Embodiment<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic plan view showing an antenna device<br>
according to the third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The antenna device according to this embodiment is provided<br>
in which a concrete parallel resonant circuit is applied to each<br>
of the first reactance circuit 6A, the second reactance circuit<br>
6B, and the third reactance circuit 6C used in the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 5, the first reactance circuit<br>
6A, the second reactance circuit 6B, and the third reactance<br>
circuit 6C are configured as a parallel resonant circuit<br>
including the first variable-capacitance diode 61A, a parallel<br>
resonant circuit including the second variable-capacitance diode<br>
61B, and a parallel resonant circuit including the third<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61C, respectively.<br>
More specifically, a parallel resonant circuit in which<br>
a series circuit including a coil 63A and a common capacitor 64<br>
is connected in parallel to the series circuit including the first<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61A and the coil 62A is used as the<br>
 <br>
first reactance circuit 6A. A parallel resonant circuit in which<br>
a series circuit including a coil 63B and the common capacitor<br>
64 is connected in parallel to the series circuit including the<br>
second variable-capacitance diode 61B and the coil 62B is used<br>
as the second reactance circuit 6B. A parallel resonant circuit<br>
in which a coil 63C is connected in parallel to the series circuit<br>
including the third variable-capacitance diode 61C and the coil<br>
62C is used as the third reactance circuit 6C.<br>
Operations and advantages of the antenna device according<br>
to this embodiment will be described.<br>
Fig. 6 is a chart illustrating a variable state of two<br>
resonances.<br>
As shown by a return-loss curve S1 represented by a solid<br>
line shown in Fig. 6, the antenna device according to this<br>
embodiment achieves a two-resonant state exhibiting a resonant<br>
frequency f 1 of the first antenna unit 2 and a resonant frequency<br>
f2 of the second antenna unit 3, as in the first embodiment.<br>
Applying a control voltage Vc to each of the first<br>
frequency-variable circuit 6-1 and the second frequency-variable<br>
circuit 6-2 varies the resonant frequency f 1 of the first antenna<br>
unit 2 and the resonant frequency f2 of the second antenna unit<br>
3 at the same time.<br>
In the parallel resonant circuit in which a series circuit<br>
including a variable-capacitance diode and a coil is connected<br>
in parallel to another coil, the reactance with respect to the<br>
 <br>
control voltage varies nonlinearly. Thus, although a large gain<br>
is not obtained, a significantly large amount of change d1 (d2)<br>
from the resonant frequency f1 to the resonant frequency f1' (f2<br>
to f2') by the first frequency-variable circuit 6-1 (the second<br>
frequency-variable circuit 6-2) can be achieved. Consequently,<br>
in a case where all the first to third reactance circuits 6A to<br>
6C are configured as parallel resonant circuits as in this<br>
embodiment, an antenna device that is capable of varying a<br>
frequency over a wide range can be achieved.<br>
Since the other configurations, operations, and advantages<br>
of the antenna device according to this embodiment are similar<br>
to those of the antenna devices according to the first and second<br>
embodiments, the description of those similar configurations,<br>
operations, and advantages will be omitted.<br>
Fourth Embodiment<br>
A fourth embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
Fig. 7 is a schematic plan view showing an antenna device<br>
according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The antenna device according to this embodiment is provided<br>
in which both a series resonant circuit and a parallel resonant<br>
circuit are applied to the first reactance circuit 6A, the second<br>
reactance circuit 6B, and the third reactance circuit 6C used<br>
in the first embodiment.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 7, the first reactance circuit<br>
 <br>
6A and the second reactance circuit 6B are configured as a parallel<br>
resonant circuit including the first variable-capacitance diode<br>
61A and a parallel resonant circuit including the second<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61B, respectively. The third<br>
reactance circuit 6C is configured as a series resonant circuit<br>
including the third variable-capacitance diode 61C.<br>
Operations and advantages of the antenna device according<br>
to this embodiment will be described.<br>
Fig. 8 is a chart illustrating a variable state of two<br>
resonances.<br>
As shown by a return-loss curve S1 represented by a solid<br>
line shown in Fig. 8, the antenna device according to this<br>
embodiment also achieves two resonances f 1 and f2 caused by the<br>
first and second antenna units 2 and 3. Applying a control<br>
voltage Vc to each of the first and second frequency-variable<br>
circuits 6-1 and 6-2 varies the resonant frequency f 1 of the first<br>
antenna unit 2 and the resonant frequency f2 of the second antenna<br>
unit 3 at the same time.<br>
In the first frequency-variable circuit 6-1 including the<br>
first reactance circuit 6A and the second reactance circuit 6B,<br>
which are configured as parallel resonant circuits, the reactance<br>
with respect to the control voltage Vc varies nonlinearly, as<br>
described above. Thus, although a large gain is not achieved,<br>
the amount of change d1 from the resonant frequency f1 to the<br>
resonant frequency f1' is significantly large, as shown in Fig.<br>
 <br>
8. In the third reactance circuit 6C, which is a series resonant<br>
circuit, the reactance with respect to the control voltage Vc<br>
varies linearly. Thus, although a large amount of change in the<br>
reactance is not achieved, a large gain can be obtained. As a<br>
result, the amount of change d2 from the resonant frequency f2<br>
to the resonant frequency f2' by the second frequency-variable<br>
circuit 6-2, which includes the first reactance circuit 6A<br>
configured as a parallel resonant circuit and the third reactance<br>
circuit 6C configured as a series resonant circuit, is small.<br>
That is, according to this embodiment, an antenna device<br>
that is capable of achieving a large amount of change d1 of the<br>
resonant frequency f1 and ensuring a certain amount of change<br>
d2 of the resonant frequency f2 while obtaining a large gain can<br>
be achieved.<br>
The antenna device including the first reactance circuit<br>
6A and the second reactance circuit 6B, which are configured as<br>
parallel resonant circuits, and the third reactance circuit 6C,<br>
which is configured as a series resonant circuit, has been<br>
explained in this embodiment. However, the present invention<br>
is not limited to this. Determination of which reactance circuit<br>
is to be configured as a parallel resonant circuit and<br>
determination of which reactance circuit is to be configured as<br>
a series resonant circuit can be performed in accordance with<br>
which of the variation width of a resonant frequency band or the<br>
gain is to be emphasized.<br>
 <br>
Since the other configurations, operations, and advantages<br>
of the antenna device according to this embodiment are similar<br>
to those of the antenna devices according to the second and third<br>
embodiments, the description of those similar configurations,<br>
operations, and advantages will be omitted.<br>
Fifth Embodiment<br>
A fifth embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
Fig. 9 is a schematic plan view showing an antenna device<br>
according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention. Fig.<br>
10 is a chart illustrating a variable state of two resonances.<br>
The antenna device according to this embodiment has a<br>
configuration in which both a series resonant circuit and a<br>
parallel resonant circuit are applied to the first reactance<br>
circuit 6A, the second reactance circuit 6B, and the third<br>
reactance circuit 6C, as in the fourth embodiment. However, the<br>
antenna device according to this embodiment is different from<br>
the antenna device according to the fourth embodiment in that<br>
a series resonant circuit is formed using a choke coil.<br>
That is, as shown in Fig. 9, the first reactance circuit<br>
6A, the second reactance circuit 6B, and the third reactance<br>
circuit 6C are configured as parallel circuits. By using a choke<br>
coil as a coil of the second reactance circuit 6B, the second<br>
reactance circuit 6B is substantially capable of serving as a<br>
series resonant circuit.<br>
 <br>
More specifically, the second reactance circuit 6B is<br>
formed by connecting a series circuit including the common<br>
capacitor 64 and a coil 63B' in parallel to the series circuit<br>
including the second variable-capacitance diode 61B and the coil<br>
62B. The coil 63B' is set as a choke coil for cutting off electric<br>
power having an in-band frequency of the first antenna unit 2.<br>
The coil 63B' can be set as a choke coil by adjusting the inductance<br>
of the coil 63B'. That is, the second reactance circuit 6B is<br>
substantially configured so as to function as a series resonant<br>
circuit including the first variable-capacitance diode 61A and<br>
the coil 62B.<br>
With this configuration, as shown by a return-loss curve<br>
S1 represented by a solid line and a return-loss curve S2<br>
represented by a broken line shown in Fig. 10, the first<br>
frequency-variable circuit 6-1 achieves a large gain while<br>
ensuring a certain amount of change d1 of the resonant frequency<br>
f 1 and the second frequency-variable circuit 6-2 achieves a large<br>
amount of change d2 of the resonant frequency f2.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, all the<br>
first to third reactance circuits 6A to 6C are designed as parallel<br>
circuits, and one of the coils 63A to 63C is set as a choke coil<br>
by adjusting the inductance of the one of the coils 63A to 63C<br>
according to the situation. Thus, a parallel circuit including<br>
the choke coil functions substantially as a series resonant<br>
circuit. Consequently, design can be changed easily without<br>
 <br>
requiring reconfiguration of a parallel circuit portion into a<br>
serial resonant circuit.<br>
Since the other configurations, operations, and advantages<br>
of the antenna device according to this embodiment are similar<br>
to those of the antenna device according to the fourth embodiment,<br>
the description of those similar configurations, operations, and<br>
advantages will be omitted.<br>
Sixth Embodiment<br>
A sixth embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
Fig. 11 is a schematic plan view showing an antenna device<br>
according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the antenna device according to this embodiment, all<br>
the first reactance circuit 6A, the second reactance circuit 6B,<br>
and the third reactance circuit 6C are configured as parallel<br>
resonant circuits, as in the third embodiment. However, the<br>
antenna device according to this embodiment is different from<br>
the antenna devices according to the third to fifth embodiments<br>
in that functions similar to functions attained in a case where<br>
a series resonant circuit and a parallel resonant circuit are<br>
applied to the first to third reactance circuits 6A to 6C can<br>
be attained by using an internal resistance of a<br>
variable-capacitance diode.<br>
Fig. 12 is a chart illustrating the relationship between<br>
the frequency and the gain when a variable-capacitance diode has<br>
 <br>
a large internal resistance. Fig. 13 is a chart illustrating<br>
the relationship between the frequency and the gain when a<br>
variable-capacitance diode has a small internal resistance.<br>
Each variable-capacitance diode has an internal resistance<br>
that is characteristic of the diode. As shown in Fig. 12, the<br>
larger the internal resistance of a variable-capacitance diode<br>
is, the smaller the gain is. However, when such a<br>
variable-capacitance diode is used, a variable-capacitance range<br>
is increased. In contrast, the smaller the internal resistance<br>
is, the larger the gain is, as shown in Fig. 13. However, when<br>
such a variable-capacitance diode is used, a variable capacitance<br>
range is reduced.<br>
The antenna device according to this embodiment utilizes<br>
such characteristics of variable-capacitance diodes. The<br>
internal resistances Ra, Rb, and Re of the first<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61A, the second variable-capacitance<br>
diode 61B, and the third variable-capacitance diode 61C are set<br>
to Ra &gt; Rb &gt; Re.<br>
With this configuration, the first frequency-variable<br>
circuit 6-1 is capable of varying the resonant frequency f1 of<br>
the first antenna unit 2 over a wide range and the second<br>
frequency-variable circuit 6-2 is capable of varying the resonant<br>
frequency f2 over a predetermined range and obtaining a large<br>
gain.<br>
In this embodiment, the internal resistances Ra, Rb, and<br>
 <br>
Re of the first variable-capacitance diode 61A, the second<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61B, and the third<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61C are set to Ra &gt; Rb &gt; Re. The values<br>
of the internal resistances can be determined depending on which<br>
of a frequency variable range or a gain is to be emphasized.<br>
Thus, when all the internal resistances Ra to Re are set<br>
to the same large value, the first and second frequency-variable<br>
circuits 6-1 and 6-2 are capable of achieving a wide variable<br>
range for the resonant frequencies f1 and f2. When all the<br>
internal resistances Ra to Re are set to the same small value,<br>
a large gain can be achieved in each of the first antenna unit<br>
2 and the second antenna unit 3. In addition, when at least one<br>
of the internal resistances Ra to Re is set to be different from<br>
the others of the internal resistances Ra to Re in an appropriate<br>
manner, optimal characteristics of the first and second antenna<br>
units 2 and 3 can be achieved according to the situation.<br>
Since the other configurations, operations, and advantages<br>
of the antenna device according to this embodiment are similar<br>
to those of the antenna devices according to the second to fifth<br>
embodiments, the description of those similar configurations,<br>
operations, and advantages will be omitted.<br>
Seventh Embodiment<br>
A seventh embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
Fig. 14 is a perspective view showing an antenna device<br>
 <br>
according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 14, the antenna device according to this<br>
embodiment is different from the antenna devices according to<br>
the first to sixth embodiments in that the first antenna unit<br>
2 and the second antenna unit 3 are formed on a dielectric<br>
substrate 8.<br>
More specifically, the dielectric substrate 8 is a<br>
rectangular parallelepiped and includes a front face 80, side<br>
faces 81 and 82, an upper face 83, a lower face 84, and a rear<br>
face 85. The dielectric substrate 8 is provided in the non-ground<br>
region 101 of the circuit board 100.<br>
The feed electrode 4 of the first antenna unit 2 is<br>
pattern-formed on the front face 80 and the upper face 83 of the<br>
dielectric substrate 8 . A pattern 113 is formed in the non-ground<br>
region 101. One end of the feed electrode 4 is connected to the<br>
transmitter/receiver 110 through the pattern 113 and the coil<br>
111. The other end of the feed electrode 4 is connected to the<br>
first frequency-variable circuit 6-1. Each of the first<br>
reactance circuit 6A and the second reactance circuit 6B of the<br>
first frequency-variable circuit 6-1 is a series resonant circuit.<br>
The first variable-capacitance diode 61A (the second<br>
variable-capacitance diode 61B) and the coil 62A (62B) are chip<br>
components and are connected to each other through a pattern 65<br>
provided on the upper face 83 of the dielectric substrate 8.<br>
The first radiation electrode 5 is connected to the coil<br>
 <br>
62B of the first frequency-variable circuit 6-1. The first<br>
radiation electrode 5 extends rightward in an upper portion of<br>
the upper face 83 of the dielectric substrate 8, goes down along<br>
the side face 81, extends leftward along the lower face 84, and<br>
goes up along the side face 82. Then, the open end 50 of the<br>
first radiation electrode 5 is positioned at a corner of the upper<br>
face 83.<br>
A pattern 72 is extracted from the connection point P of<br>
the first frequency-variable circuit 6-1. The pattern 72 extends<br>
along the upper face 83 and the front face 80, and is connected<br>
to a pattern 123, which is formed in the non-ground region 101<br>
and reaches the reception-frequency controller 120. The<br>
high-frequency cutoff resistor 121 and the DC-pass capacitor 122<br>
are connected in the middle of the pattern 123.<br>
The second radiation electrode 7 of the second antenna unit<br>
3 is pattern-formed on the upper face 83 of the dielectric<br>
substrate 8 and faces a direction perpendicular to the pattern<br>
72. The second radiation electrode 7 is connected to the pattern<br>
72 through the second frequency-variable circuit 6-2.<br>
The third reactance circuit 6C of the second<br>
frequency-variable circuit 6-2 is a series resonant circuit. The<br>
third variable-capacitance diode 61C and the coil 62C are chip<br>
components and are connected to each other through a pattern 73<br>
provided on the upper face 83 of the dielectric substrate 8.<br>
With this configuration, the capacitance between the open<br>
 <br>
end 50 of the first radiation electrode 5 and the feed electrode<br>
4 of the first antenna unit 2 and the capacitance between the<br>
first radiation electrode 5 and the second radiation electrode<br>
7 can be increased. Thus, by changing the dielectric constant<br>
of the dielectric substrate 8 in an appropriate manner, the<br>
reactances of the first and second antenna units 2 and 3 can be<br>
adjusted.<br>
In this embodiment, all the first antenna unit 2 and the<br>
second antenna unit 3 are formed on the dielectric substrate 8.<br>
However, at least the first antenna unit 2 can be formed on the<br>
dielectric substrate 8. Thus, the second antenna unit 3 may be<br>
formed in the non-ground region 101 of the circuit board 100.<br>
Since the other configurations, operations, and advantages<br>
of the antenna device according to this embodiment are similar<br>
to those of the antenna devices according to the first to sixth<br>
embodiments, the description of those similar configurations,<br>
operations, and advantages will be omitted.<br>
Eighth Embodiment<br>
An eighth embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
Fig. 15 is a schematic plan view showing an antenna device<br>
according to the eight embodiment of the present invention. Fig.<br>
16 is a chart illustrating a variable state of multi-resonances.<br>
As shown in Fig. 15, the antenna device according to this<br>
embodiment is different from the antenna devices according to<br>
 <br>
the first to seventh embodiments in that another antenna unit<br>
is added.<br>
That is, an additional radiation electrode 9, to which a<br>
ground coil 91 for adjusting a resonant frequency is connected,<br>
is connected to the connection point P through a coil 92 and is<br>
disposed in the subsequent stage of the first reactance circuit<br>
6A.<br>
Thus, an additional antenna unit 3-1 is formed by the feed<br>
electrode 4, the first reactance circuit 6A, which is a<br>
frequency-variable circuit, and the additional radiation<br>
electrode 9.<br>
With this configuration, as shown in Fig. 16, a resonant<br>
frequency f3 of the additional antenna unit 3-1, as well as the<br>
resonant frequencies f1 and f2 of the first and second antenna<br>
units 2 and 3, can be obtained.<br>
By changing the reactances of the first and second<br>
frequency-variable circuits 6-1 and 6-2 and the first reactance<br>
circuit 6A due to the application of a control voltage Vc, the<br>
resonant frequencies f1, f2, and f3 of the first and second antenna<br>
units 2 and 3 and the additional antenna unit 3-1 can be changed<br>
at the same time by the amounts of change dl, d2, and d3 to the<br>
resonant frequencies f1', f2', and f3'.<br>
Although an example in which the additional antenna unit<br>
3-1 including the additional radiation electrode 9 is provided<br>
has been described in this embodiment, a plurality of additional<br>
 <br>
radiation electrodes 9 may be connected in parallel to each other<br>
to the connection point P so that a plurality of additional antenna<br>
units 3-1 to 3-n can be formed.<br>
Since the other configurations, operations, and advantages<br>
of the antenna device according to this embodiment are similar<br>
to those of the antenna devices according to the first to seventh<br>
embodiments, the description of those similar configurations,<br>
operations, and advantages will be omitted.<br>
Ninth Embodiment<br>
A ninth embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described.<br>
Fig. 17 is a schematic plan view showing an antenna device<br>
according to the ninth embodiment of the present invention. Fig.<br>
18 is a chart illustrating a variable state of multi-resonances.<br>
As shown in Fig. 17, the antenna device according to this<br>
embodiment is different from the antenna device according to the<br>
eighth embodiment in that a reactance circuit is added to n<br>
additional antenna units 3-1 to 3-n.<br>
That is, n additional antenna units 3-1 to 3-n are provided,<br>
and an additional reactance circuit is provided in at least one<br>
of the n additional antenna units 3-1.<br>
More specifically, an additional reactance circuit 6D<br>
including a variable-capacitance diode 61D whose capacitance can<br>
be varied by a control voltage Vc is connected between the first<br>
reactance circuit 6A and an additional radiation electrode 9-1,<br>
 <br>
and a frequency-variable circuit is formed by the first reactance<br>
circuit 6A and the additional reactance circuit 6D. That is,<br>
the additional antenna unit 3-1 is formed by the<br>
frequency-variable circuit, the additional radiation electrode<br>
9-1, and the feed electrode 4.<br>
In the additional antenna unit 3-2, the coil 92 is connected<br>
to an additional radiation electrode 9-2, as in the eighth<br>
embodiment, however no additional reactance circuit is connected.<br>
Thus, the additional antenna unit 3-2 is formed by the feed<br>
electrode 4, the first reactance circuit 6A, and the additional<br>
radiation electrode 9-2.<br>
In the subsequent additional antenna units, an additional<br>
reactance circuit is provided when necessary. In the additional<br>
antenna unit 3-n, which is in the last stage, an additional<br>
reactance circuit 6E is connected to an additional radiation<br>
electrode 9-n. That is, a frequency-variable circuit is formed<br>
by the first reactance circuit 6A and the additional reactance<br>
circuit 6E. Accordingly, the additional antenna unit 3-n is<br>
formed by the feed electrode 4, the frequency-variable circuit,<br>
and the additional radiation electrode 9-n.<br>
With this configuration, as shown by a return-loss curve<br>
S1 represented by a solid line shown in Fig. 18, the resonant<br>
frequencies f1 and f2 of the first and second antenna units 2<br>
and 3 and the resonant frequencies f3 to fn of the additional<br>
antenna units 3-1 to 3-n can be obtained.<br>
 <br>
As shown by a return-loss curve S2 represented by a broken<br>
line, the resonant frequencies f1, f2, f3, f4, •••, and fn of<br>
the first and second antenna units 2 and 3 and the additional<br>
antenna units 3-1, 3-2, • • • , and 3-n are changed at the same time<br>
by the amounts of change dl, d2, d3, d4, • • • , and dn to the resonant<br>
frequencies f1', f2', f3', f4', •••, and fn'.<br>
Since the frequency-variable circuits of the additional<br>
antenna units 3-1 and 3-n have two reactance circuits (the first<br>
reactance circuit 6A and the additional reactance circuit 6D;<br>
and the first reactance circuit 6A and the additional reactance<br>
circuit 6E), the amounts of change d3 and dn from the resonant<br>
frequencies f3 and fn to the resonant frequencies f3' and fn'<br>
are greater than the amount of change d4 from the resonant<br>
frequency f4 to the resonant frequency f4' of the additional<br>
antenna unit 3-2, which includes only a single reactance circuit<br>
(the first reactance circuit 6A).<br>
Since the other configurations, operations, and advantages<br>
of the antenna device according to this embodiment are similar<br>
to those of the antenna device according to the eighth embodiment,<br>
the description of those similar configurations, operations, and<br>
advantages will be omitted.<br>
