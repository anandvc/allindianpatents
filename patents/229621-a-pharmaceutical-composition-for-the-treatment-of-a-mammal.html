				<td>PRSGABALIN DERIVATIVES FOR THE TREATMENT OF FIBROMYALGIA AND OTHER DISORDERS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the use of certain alpha2delta ligand for the treatment of fibromyalgia and other central nervous system disorders. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic syndrome characterized mainly by widespread pain, unrefreshing sleep, disturbed mood, and fatigue. The main symptoms fibromyalgia include pain, sleep, mood disturbances and fatigue. Syndromes commonly associated with fibromyalgia include irritable bowel syndrome, and migraine headaches, among others. Success of treating fibromyalgia with a single pharmacological agent has been characterized as modest and results of clinical trials have been characterized as disappointing. It is believed that based on current understanding of the mechanisms and pathways involved in fibromyalgia, multiple agents will be required, aimed at the major symptoms of pain, disturbed sleep, mood disturbances, and fatigue. Fibromyalgia patients are often sensitive to side effects of medications, a characteristic perhaps related to the pathophysiology of this disorder (Barkhuizen A, Rational and Targeted pharmacologic treatment of fibromyalgia. Rheum Dis Clin N Am 2002; 28: 261-290; Leventhal LJ. Management of fibromyalgia. Ann Intern Med 1999;131:850-8).<br>
While fibromyalgia is a complex disorder with multiple facets, this complexity can be well assessed (Yunus MB, A comprehensive medical evaluation of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome, Rheum Dis N Am 2002; 28:201-217). The diagnosis of FM is usually based on the 1990 recommendations of the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria (Bennett RM, The rational management of fibromyalgia patients. Rheum Dis Clin N Am 2002; 28: 181-199; Wolfe F, Smythe HA, Yunus MB, Bennett RM, Bombardier C, Goldenberg DL, et al. The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of fibromyalgia: Report of the Multicenter Criteria Committee. Arthritis Rheum 1990; 33:160-72). Evaluation, management, and pharmacological treatment of fibromyalgia have been reviewed (Barkhuizen A,<br><br>
Rational and Targeted pharmacologic treatment of fibromyalgia. Rheum Dis Glin N Am 2002; Buskila D, Fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and myofacial pain syndrome. Current opinions in Rheumatology 2001; 13: 117-127; Leventhal LJ. Management of fibromyalgia. Ann Intern Med 1999;131:S50-8; Bennett RM, The rational management of fibromyalgia patients. Rheum Dis Clin N Am 2002; 28: 181-199; Yunus MB, A comprehensive medical evaluation of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome, Rheum Dis N Am 2002; 28:201-217 ).<br>
Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) has been characterized by the minimal diagnostic criteria: (a) desire to move the extremities, often associated with paresthesias/dysesthesias; (b) motor restlessness; (c) worsening of symptoms at rest with at least temporary relief by activity, and (d) worsening of symptoms in the evening or night. Other features commonly seen in RLS include sleep disturbance, periodic limb movements in sleep and similar involuntary movements while awake, a normal neurological examination in the idiopathic form, a tendency for the symptoms to be worse in middle to older age, and, in some cases, a family history suggestive of an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. See Walters AS; Toward a better definition of the restless legs syndrome; The International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group; Mov Disord. (1995) 10(5): 634-42. See also, Bhatia M and Bhowmik D; Restless legs syndrome in maintenance haemodialysis patients; Nephrol Dial Transplant (2003) 18: 217. Restless legs syndrome can be a primary disorder, or a secondary disorder associated with, for example, renal insufficiency, heredity, pregnancy, poliomyelitis, infectious diseases, avitaminosis, different types of anemia, diabetes, and certain drugs (e.g. prochloroperazine, lithium, and mianserin).<br>

A compound of structure 30 could be prepared from a compound of structure 29 by treatment with an aqueous acid such as hydrochloric acid and alike at a temperature between room temperature and reflux. As an alternative, a compound of structure 30 can be prepared from a compound of structure 32 by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in a solvent such as CH2C12 or EtOAc and alike. Compound 32 could be prepared by base mediate hydrolysis of a Boc<br>
protected lac tarn such as compound 31 which itself could be prepared froni a compound of structure 29 by treatment with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in a solvent such as THF and alike. The treatment of the Boc-lactam 31 with aqueous sodium hydroxide for example would give rise to the acid 32.<br>
A compound of structure 29 could be prepared from compound of structure 28 (n = 0) by treatment with sodium or lithium metal in ammonia. Preferably, the reaction is carried out with sodium metal in ammonia. Alternatively, a compound of structure 29 could be prepared from compound of structure 28 (n = 1 or 2) by treatment with eerie ammonium nitrate in a mixture of acetonitrile and water. Other methods known in the literature for the removal of substituted alkoxy benzyl groups from nitrogen are described in Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, 2 ed, 1991 and could be utilized.<br>
A compound of structure 28 could be prepared from a compound of structure 27 (where LG is a suitable leaving group such as a halide or an alkyl sulphonate, preferably an iodide would be used) by carbon-carbon bond forming reactions known in the art. Several methods exist in the literature for the coupling of organohalides or organoalkyl sulphonates with organometallic reagents in the presence of various metal salts as summarized in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, volume 3:413 which could be utilized. For example, a compound of structure 28 could be prepared from a compound of structure 27 (where LG is iodide) by treatment with a suitable secondary halide (chloride or iodide) in the presence of magnesium metal, iodine and copper bromide dimethylsulphide in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and alike. Alternatively the method according to El  Marini,  Synthesis,   1992:1104  could  be  used.  Hence,   a  compound  of structure 28 could be prepared from a compound of structure 27 (where LG i$ iodide) by treatment with suitable methyl-substituted secondary' halide such as an iodide in the presence of magnesium, iodine and lithium tetrachlorocuprate in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and alike.<br>
A compound of structure 27 incorporates a suitable leaving group, which would undergo nucleophilic substitution with suitable nucleophile. Examples of such leaving groups include halides such as chloride, bromide, or iodide, and sulphonic esters such as mesylate, tosylate, Inflate, nosylate, and alike.<br>
A compound of structure 27 (where LG = iodide) could be prepared from a compound of structure 26 through treatment with iodine, triphenylphosphine, and imidazole in a solvent such as toluene and alike.<br>
A compound of structure 26 could be prepared from compound of structure 25 by treatment with a metal borohydride, such as sodium borohydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or DME and alike.<br>
Compound 25 could be prepared in a similar fashion to the procedures of Zoretic etal, J. Org. Chem., 19SO;45:810-814 or Nielsen et al /. Med. Chem., 1990;33:71-77 using an appropriate benzylamine, such as but not limited to benzylamine, 4-rnethoxybenzylamine or 2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine.<br>
As an alternative approach, a compound of structure 26 could be treated with sodium metal and ammonia to give 4-hydroxymethyl-pyrrolidinone which could be iodinated affording 4-iodomethyl-pyrrolidinone. 4-iodomethyl-pyrrolidinone could then be coupled with organometallic reagents according to the above procedures avoiding protection of the lactam nitrogen as below.<br><br><br>

Analogous to the above methods a lactam of structure 33 (see Nielsen et. al, J. Med. Chem., 1990;33:71-77 for general method of preparation) could be employed thus establishing fixed stereochemistry at C3 of the final amino acids.<br>

Compounds of structure 44 (where R2 = alkyl, branched alkyl, cycloalkyl,<br>
alkyl-cycloalkyl) could be prepared from (S)-citronellyl bromide by carbon-carbon bond forming reactions known in the art and as described in method 3. The substitution of the halide in (S)-citronellyl bromide with alkoxy anions could also be used to provide compounds of structure 44 where R = alkoxy or phenoxy ethers (and appropriate substitutions thereof as according to Formula 1). Alternatively (S)-citronellol could be utilized to afford compounds of structure 44 by treatment of (S)-citronello] with a base such as sodium hydride, and treatment of the resultant alkoxide with an appropriate alkyl halide to afford ethers. In another method (S)-citronellyl bromide (or an appropriate sulphonic ester such as, but not limited to, methanesulfonic acid (S)-3,7-dimethyl-oct~6-enyl ester) could be reduced with an appropriate metal borohydride or with an aluminum hydride species, such as LAH, to provide (R)-2,6-dimethyl~oct-2-ene.<br>
To one skilled in the art it will be appreciated that rational choice of either R- or S'-citronellol or R- or S-citronellyl bromide would give rise to the requisite isomer at C5 of the final amino acid.<br>

To one skilled in the art, the use of (R)-(+)-citronellal would afford compounds of opposite C5-stereochemistry to Example 21.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared and administered in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. Thus, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by injection, that is, intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally. Also, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention can be administered transdennally. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise as the active component, either a compound of formula 1 or a corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula 1.<br>
For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or<br>
liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.<br>
In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.<br>
i<br>
In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.<br>
The powders and tablets preferably contain from five or ten to about seventy percent of the active compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without other carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted, and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.<br>
Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.<br>
Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents as desired.<br>
Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or<br>
synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well-known suspending agents.<br>
Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 1 g according to the particular application and the potency of the active component. In medical use the drug may be administered three times daily as, for example, capsules of 100 or 300 mg. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.<br>
In therapeutic use, the compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of this invention are administered at the initial dosage of about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg daily. A daily dose range of about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg is preferred. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired.<br>
Dlustrative examples of compounds made in accordance with the present invention are tested as described in EXAMPLE 22.<br>
EXAMPLE 22<br>
RAT MODEL OF FOOTPAD TACTILE ALLODYNIA FROM PRIOR INJECTION OF ACID INTO THE GASTROCNEMTUS MUSCLE<br>
Patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) typically demonstrate widespread, chronic musculoskeletal pain, which is often accompanied by tactile allodynia (pain in response to a relatively light tactile stimulus that is normally not painful). A rat model of persistent mechanical allodynia has been developed that is consistent with the muscle tenderness found in these patients. Multiple injections of acidified saline into the gastrocnemius muscle in rats produce a long-lasting allodynia (conveniently measured at the footpad) that is thought to be centrally mediated (Sluka K, Kalra A, Moore S. Unilateral intramuscular injections of acidic saline produce a bilateral, long-lasting hyperalgesia. Muscle Nerve 2001;24:37-46; Sluka K, Rohlwing J, Bussey R, et al. Chronic muscle pain induced by repeated acid injection is reversed by spinally administered mu- and delta-, but not kappa-, opioid receptor agonists. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 2002;302:1146-50). This model was utilized to evaluate a compound of the invention for its ability to inhibit allodynia.<br>
Allodynia is induced as described by Sluka, et al. (Sluka K, Kalra A, Moore S. Unilateral intramuscular injections of acidic saline produce a bilateral, long-lasting hyperalgesia. Muscle Nerve 2001;24:37-46) with minor modifications. On Day 0, male Sprague-Dawley rats (-200 g body weight) in their dark cycle are placed in suspended wire-bottom cages and allowed to acclimate for 0.5 hours. The baseline paw withdrawal threshold is determined on the right hind paw by Von Prey monofilament hairs (bending forces of 2.0, 3.6, 5.5, 8.5, 15.1, and 28.8 g) using the Dixon Up-Down method (Dixon W. Efficient analysis of experimental observations. Ann Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 19SO;20:441-62). Von Prey hairs are applied to the plantar surface for up to 6 seconds, and a flinching of the paw during that time frame is considered a positive response. After assessment, the right gastrocnemius muscle is shaved, swabbed with<br>
alcohol, and injected with 0.1 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution acidified to pH 4 with<br>
*<br>
HC1. The injection is repeated on Day 5. Animals are manipulated with a dynamic plantar aesthesiometer (Ugo Basile, Comerio-Varese, Italy) on Days 6,7, and 8 to facilitate induction of the allodynia. To screen the rats for the development of allodynia, the 15.1 g Von Frey hair is applied to the ipsilateral paw on Day 11. Positive responders from that test are included in the compound evaluation study. On Day 12 (the day of peak allodynia), animals are assigned into treatment groups, and then their ipsilateral paw withdrawal thresholds are determined to establish the allodynia (reduction in paw withdrawal threshold) compared to baseline values. Rats are then orally dosed with 10 mL/kg vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose/0.2% Tween 80) or an indicated dose of a compound of the invention. Paw withdrawal thresholds are reassessed by Von Frey hairs in blinded fashion 2 hours after dosing for the dose-response study, and 2, 5, 8, and 24 hours after dosing in the time course experiment. The inhibition of allodynia is determined for each animal by dividing the increase in paw withdrawal threshold after treatment by the difference between baseline and pretreatment paw withdrawal values. This fraction is then converted to percent inhibition by multiplying by 100.<br>
In this manner, one or more compounds described above is evaluated for its ability to dose-dependently attenuate allodynia, and minimum effective doses of are determined). To determine the time course of inhibition, allodynia is monitored at various time points after a minimum effective dose of a compound of the invention.<br>
In this manner, it is evaluated whether administration of one or more compounds described above reduces tactile allodynia to the footpad caused by prior injection of acidic saline. The time period for sustained efficacy is also determined. The results allow evaluation of a compound of the invention for treating the allodynia associated with fibromyalgia syndrome.<br><br><br><br><br>
