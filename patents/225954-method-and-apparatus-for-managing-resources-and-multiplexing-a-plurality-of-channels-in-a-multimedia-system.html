				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING RESOURCES AND MULTIPLEXING A<br>
PLURALITY OF CHANNELS IN A MULTIMEDIA SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to communication systems and more particularly to in-<br>
home local area networking.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Communication systems are known to convey data from one entity to another. The data<br>
may be audio data, video data and/or text data. In such communication systems, the data is<br>
transmitted via one or more transmission mediums (e.g., radio frequencies, coaxial cable, twisted<br>
pair copper wire, fiber optic cabling, et cetera) in accordance with one or more data transmission<br>
protocols. The distance over which the data traverses within a communication system may be<br>
inchesffeet, miles, tens of miles, hundreds of miles, thousands of miles, et cetera.<br>
As is also known, communication systems have two basic configurations: wide area<br>
networks (WAN) and local area networks (LAN). In addition, WAN and/or LAN communication<br>
systems may use a variety of transmission types including broadcast transmissions, asymmetrical<br>
transmissions, and symmetrical transmissions. In a broadcast communication system, a network<br>
hub transmits data to a plurality of users with little or no data being transmitted from the users to<br>
the network hub. Examples of broadcast communication systems include radio systems, NTSC<br>
(national television standards committee) television systems (e.g., regular TV), high definition<br>
television systems, cable systems, and satellite systems. In each of these broadcast communication<br>
systems, a network hub (e.g., radio station, television station, et cetera) transmits a broadcast<br>
signal. Any user within range of the broadcast signal and who has an appropriate receiver (e.g.,<br>
radio, television, et cetera) can receive the broadcast signal. Such broadcast systems employ a<br>
particular data transmission protocol such as amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, ultra-<br>
high frequency, very high frequency, et cetera.<br>
Asymmetrical communication systems transmit more data in one direction than in another<br>
(i.e., one entity transmits to others more than it receives data from each of the other entities). An<br>
example of an asymmetrical communication system is the Internet, where web servers transmit<br>
substantially more data than they receive from any one user. The Internet uses TCP/IP as its data<br>
transmission protocol, while a variety of physical layer data transmission protocols may be used to<br>
access the Internet. Such physical layer data transmission protocols include asynchronous transfer<br>
mode (ATM), frame relay, integrated services digital network (ISDN), digital subscriber loop<br>
(DSL) and all derivatives thereof, and multiple packet label switching (MPLS). Such asymmetrical<br>
communication systems may be wide area networks (e.g., the Internet), or local area networks (e.g.,<br>
local server based system).<br>
Symmetrical communication systems include a plurality of users where the data flow<br>
between any of the users could be equal. Examples of symmetrical communication systems<br>
include public switch telephone network (PSTN), local computer networks, cellular telephone<br>
systems, intercom systems, private branch exchanges (PBX), et cetera. Such symmetrical<br>
communication systems use at least one data transmission protocol. For example, a computer<br>
network may utilize any one of the Ethernet standards.<br>
In any type of communication system, a user must have the appropriate receiving and<br>
possibly transmitting equipment to independently access the communication system. For example,<br>
a user of a satellite television system must have a satellite receiver and a television to receive<br>
satellite broadcast. If another television is to independently access the satellite brjoadcast, it needs<br>
its own satellite receiver. The same is true for NTSC broadcast, cable broadcast, et cetera,<br>
although currently most televisions include an NTSC tuner and/or some form of cable tuner.<br>
With the number of households having multiple television sets increasing and many users<br>
wanting the latest and greatest video viewing services. As such, many households have multiple<br>
satellite receivers, cable set-top boxes, modems, et cetera. As is further known, dependent multiple.<br>
access to satellite broadcasts may be achieved by linking slave televisions to a master television.<br>
The master television has full control of, and independent access to, the satellite receiver while the<br>
slave televisions receive whatever channel has been selected by the master.<br>
For in-home Internet access, each computer or Internet device has its own Internet<br>
connection. As such, each computer or Internet device includes a modem. As an alternative to<br>
each computer having its modem, an in-home local area network may be used to provide Internet<br>
access. In such an in-home local area network, each computer or Internet device includes a<br>
network card to access a server. The server provides the coupling to the Internet. Currently, the<br>
cost of a network card is at least as expensive as a 56K modem thus, there is no 0ost savings with<br>
such an in-home local area network.<br>
As is further known, in-home local area networks use one or more of telephone lines, radio<br>
frequencies, power lines, and/or infrared connections as the communication medium. Such in-<br>
home local area networks are typically used to facilitate an in-home computer network that couples<br>
a plurality of computers with one or more printers, facsimile machine, etc. As sush, entertainment<br>
type data transmissions (e.g., from VCRs, DVDs, et cetera) are not supported by the in-home local<br>
area network without having the home specially wired to support an in-home LAN that transceives<br>
entertainment type data.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for a method and apparatus for a communicfation system to<br>
overcome the above-mentioned issues and to offer additional services within homers.<br><br>

DETAILED DISCUSSION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Generally, the present invention provides a method and apparatus for providing multimedia<br>
services to a local area network; multiplexing a plurality of channels within a multimedia system;<br>
and managing resources within a multimedia system.<br>
Such a method and apparatus includes:<br>
a) processing that begins by receiving a plurality of channels from at least one<br>
multimedia source. For example, the plurality of channels may be received via a<br>
satellite connection, cable connection, NTSC broadcast, et cetera. The processing<br>
continues by receiving selection requests from at least one client module via a<br>
communication path. The client module is affiliated with a client device such as a<br>
television, computer, laptop computer, monitor, personal digital assistant, et cetera.<br>
The processing continues by generating a set of channel select commands from the<br>
select request. The generation of the set of channel select commands includes<br>
interpreting the selection request, verifying the authenticity of the client<br>
transmitting the request, and determining appropriate access privileges for the<br>
respective client. The processing continues by selecting a set of channels from the<br>
plurality of channels based on the set of channel select commands. As such, of all<br>
the channels received, only a few are selected, i.e., the ones chosen by the clients,<br>
to comprise the set of channels. The processing continues by mixing the set of<br>
channels into a stream of channel data. The processing then continues by<br>
transmitting the stream of channel data via the communication path to the at least<br>
one client module such that each client associated with a client module receives the<br>
channel data for the respective channels that they had selected. With such a<br>
method and apparatus, an in-home communication network is established that<br>
allows multiple client devices to have independent access to multimedia sources<br>
without requiring traditional receiving and/or transmitting equipment associated<br>
with independent access to such multimedia sources;<br>
b) processing that begins by receiving a plurality of channels from a multimedia<br>
• source. For example, the plurality of channels may correspond to channels<br>
provided via a satellite connection, cable connection, NTSC broadcast, HDTV<br>
broadcast, et cetera. In addition, or in the alternative, the plurality of channels may<br>
be provided by a group of video sources such as a VCR, DVD, laser disk player, et<br>
cetera. The processing then continues by receiving a plurality of channel selection<br>
commands from client modules. The client modules are affiliated with client<br>
devices (e.g., television, personal computer, lap top computer, etc.) that are<br>
requesting access to a particular channel of the plurality of channels. The<br>
processing continues by selecting a channel of the plurality of channels for each of<br>
the channel selection commands to produce selected channels. As such, for each<br>
channel selection command, a corresponding channel is selected from the plurality<br>
of channels. The processing continues by encoding the selected channels based on<br>
a data conveyance protocol (e.g., encoding scheme and/or modulation scheme).<br>
The encoded channel data is then conveyed to a plurality of clients. With such a<br>
method and apparatus, an in-home communication network is established that<br>
allows multiple client devices to have independent access to multimedia sources<br>
without requiring traditional receiving and/or transmitting equipment associated<br>
with independent access to such multimedia sources; and<br>
c) processing that begins by receiving a client request for a multimedia system<br>
service from one of a plurality of clients. The multimedia system service may be<br>
to access a radio station channel, television station channel, satellite channel, cable<br>
channel, Internet access, intercom communication, et cetera. The processing<br>
continues by determining whether the client's request is valid for this particular<br>
client. For example, the determination is being made as to whether to client has<br>
the authority to access this particular multimedia system service, whether the<br>
system can support such a service, et cetera. The processing continues when the<br>
request is valid by determining whether the multimedia system has sufficient<br>
resources to fulfill the client request. Such resources include resources within a<br>
tuning module, resources within a channel mixing module, bandwidth of a<br>
communication path between the plurality of clients and a multimedia server, et<br>
cetera. The processing continues when the multimedia system has sufficient<br>
resources to fulfill the client request by allocating at least some of the sufficient<br>
resources to fulfill the client request based on a multimedia system resource<br>
allocation procedure, which insures that the resources of the system are allocated<br>
in an efficient manner. With such a method and apparatus, an in-home<br>
communication network is established that allows multiple client devices to have<br>
independent access to multimedia sources without requiring traditional receiving<br>
and/or transmitting equipment associated with independent access to such<br>
multimedia sources.<br>
The present invention can be more fully described with reference to Figures 1 through 65.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a multimedia system 10 that includes a multimedia server 12, a plurality of<br>
client modules 14-22 operably coupled to a plurality of clients 26-34. The multimedia server 12 is<br>
operably coupled to receive a plurality of channels 36 from a multimedia source 24. The<br>
multimedia source 24 may be a satellite connection, cable connection, antenna connection for<br>
NTSC television broadcast, HDTV broadcast, PAL broadcast, et cetera. As one of average skill in<br>
the art will appreciate, the multimedia server 12 may be a stand-alone device, may be incorporated<br>
in a satellite receiver, set-top box, cable box, HDTV tuner, home entertainment receiver, et cetera.<br>
In addition, the multimedia server 12 may be implemented using discrete components, integrated<br>
circuits, and/or a combination thereof.<br>
The multimedia server 12 communicates with the plurality of client modules 14-22 via a<br>
communication path, which may be a radio frequency communication path, a wire line connection,<br>
an infrared connection, and/or any other means for conveying data. As such, the multimedia server<br>
12 and each of the client modules 14-22 include a receiver and/or transmitter operable to convey<br>
data via the given type of communication path.<br>
As shown, each client module is operably coupled to one of the clients. For example,<br>
client module 14 is operably coupled to client 26, which is representative of a personal digital<br>
assistant. Client module 16 is operably coupled to client 28, which is representative of a personal<br>
computer. Client module 18 is operably coupled to client 30, which is representative of a monitor<br>
(e.g., LCD monitor, flat panel monitor, CRT monitor, et cetera). Such a monitor may include<br>
speakers, or a speaker connection, control functions including channel select, volume control,<br>
picture quality, et cetera. Client module 20 is operably coupled to client 32, which may be a<br>
television set, high definition television (HDTV), standard definition television (SDTV), a home<br>
theatre system, et cetera. Client module 22 is operably coupled to client 34, which is representative<br>
of a laptop computer.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the client module 22 may be a separate<br>
device from its associated client or embedded within the client. In addition, one of average skill in<br>
the art will further appreciate that the client modules 14-22 may be implemented utilizing discrete<br>
components and/or integrated circuits.<br>
Each of the clients 26-34, via its associated client module 14-22, selects one or more<br>
channels from the plurality of channels 36. As shown, client 26 has selected channel 3 of the<br>
plurality of channels for viewing. Accordingly, client module 14 relays the channel selection of<br>
channel 3 to the multimedia server 12. The multimedia server 12 selects channel 3 from the<br>
plurality of channels 36. The data corresponding to channel 3 is then multiplexed with the data for<br>
the other channels and transmitted from the multimedia server 12 to each of the client modules 14-<br>
22. Client module 14 monitors the transmission from the multimedia server 12 and extracts the<br>
data corresponding to channel 3. The extracted data for channel 3 is then provided to the client 26<br>
for display.<br>
Client module 16, 18, 20 and 22 perform a similar function for their associated clients 28,<br>
32 and 34, respectively. As shown, client 28 has selected channel 505, client 30 has selected<br>
channel 106, client 32 has selected channel 206 and client 34 has selected channel 9. The client<br>
modules 16-22 provide }he channel selection of its respective client 28-34 to the multimedia server<br>
12. Multimedia server 12 extracts the selected channels from the plurality of channels for each<br>
selection request, multiplexes the data for each of the selected channels (for this example channel<br>
3, 9,106, 206 and 505) into a stream of data. The stream of data is then transmitted to each of the<br>
client modules. Each client module extracts the appropriate data of the selected channel for its<br>
respective client. For example, client module 16 monitors the transmitted data for data related to<br>
channel 505, client module 18 monitors for data related to channel 106, client module 20 monitors<br>
the transmission for data related to channel 206 and client module 22 monitors the transmission for<br>
data related to channel 9.<br>
From each client's prospective, the client 26-34 has independent access to the multimedia<br>
source 24. Accordingly, client 26 may at any time change its channel selection from, for example,<br>
channel 3 to channel 120. The client module 14 provides the channel selection request to the<br>
multimedia server 12, which now retrieves data related to channel 120 for client 26 as opposed to<br>
channel 3. Similarly, client 28-34 could also change their channel selection from the illustrated<br>
selection to another channel. Note that if two clients have selected the same channel, for example,<br>
client 26 and 28 both have selected channel 3, the multimedia server 12 would only extract data for<br>
channel 3 once and place in the header information of the data relating to channel 3 the identity of<br>
both client module 14 and 16. As such, client module 14 and 16 would extract the same data from<br>
the transmission by the multimedia server 12 and provide it to its respective clients.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the multimedia system of Figure 1<br>
provides each client with independent access to the multimedia source 24. As an alternate<br>
embodiment, the functionality of client modules 14-22 may vary. For example, client module 14<br>
may not provide all the independent functionality that client module 16 does. For example, client<br>
module 14 may not have independent channel selection capabilities but only selecting channels that<br>
one of the other clients have selected. Alternatively, one client module may service a plurality of<br>
clients.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a multimedia system 40 that includes a<br>
multimedia server 42, a plurality of client modules 46-54, and a plurality of clients 26-34. The<br>
multimedia server 42 is operably coupled to a wide area network (WAN) 44 and/or to a public<br>
switch telephone network (PSTN) 66. The wide area network 44 may be, for example, the Internet.<br>
The multimedia server 42 may be a stand-alone device or incorporated within a modem or within<br>
one of the clients 26-34. The functionality of multimedia server 42 may be implemented utilizing<br>
discrete components and/or integrated circuits with accompanying software.<br>
The plurality of client modules 46-54 communicates with the multimedia server 42 via a<br>
communication path. The communication path may be a radio frequency communication path,<br>
infrared communication path, and/or wire line communication path. In this system 40, the<br>
multimedia server 42 is providing independent access for each of the clients 26-34 to the public<br>
switch telephone network 66 and/or to the wide area network 44.<br>
For access to the public switch telephone network 66, each client 26-34 includes an<br>
identification code (e.g., a telephone number). The multimedia server 42 includes cordless<br>
telephone functionality such that the multimedia server 42 acts as a base station while each of the<br>
client modules 46-54 in conjunction with its respective client 26-34 functions as a handset. As<br>
such, for typical telephone communications, the multimedia server 42 is a single base station that<br>
includes a plurality of handsets, i.e., the clients 26-34 and their associated client modules 46-54.<br>
Note that if the multimedia server 42 has multiple connections to the public switch telephone<br>
network 66, multiple clients may have simultaneous telephone conversations ongoing. In addition,<br>
the multimedia server 42 may include private branch exchange (PBX) functionality such that<br>
communications between each client may occur within the system. For example, client 26 may<br>
communicate with client 34 via the multimedia server 42.<br>
For accessing the wide area network 44, multimedia server 42 includes a network<br>
connection, which may be a DSL modem, cable modem, 56K modem, ISDN modem, etc. In<br>
addition, the multimedia server 42 includes a plurality of network access applications (e.g., web<br>
browser applications, email applications, et cetera) to facilitate each client's access to the wide area<br>
network 44. In operation, the client modules 46-54, for their respective clients 26-34, provide an<br>
indication that its client desires access to the wide area network 44. Upon receiving the wide area<br>
network request, the multimedia server 42 opens a network access application (email or web<br>
browser) for the respective client based on the request. The multimedia server 42 may have<br>
multiple network access applications open for each client 26-34. When this occurs, the multimedia<br>
server 42 allocates access to the network connection amongst the clients in a predetermined<br>
manner. For example, the multimedia server 42 may utilize a token passing concept to provide<br>
access to the network connection for each of the clients.<br>
The multimedia server 42 receives data from the wide area network 44, which is destined<br>
for one or more of the clients 26-34. The multimedia server 42 multiplexes the data and provides a<br>
single transmission stream to the plurality of client modules 46-54. Each of the client modules<br>
monitors the transmission from the multimedia server 42 to extract data for its respective client 26-<br>
34. Upon detecting data for its client, the client module 46 extracts the data and subsequently<br>
provides it to its client.<br>
In this illustration, clients 30-34 are accessing the Internet thus are using a web application.<br>
For instance, client 34 has web page 56 open, client 32 has web page 58 open, and client 30 has<br>
web page 60 open. Each of these web pages appear to the respective client as if the client has<br>
direct and independent access to the wide area network. As is also shown, clients 26 and 28 have<br>
opened an email application 64 and 62, respectively. As such, client 26 and 28 may process their<br>
email via the multimedia server 42.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a multimedia system 80 that includes a<br>
multimedia server 88, a plurality of client modules 90-98, a plurality of clients 26-34, a DVD<br>
player 82, a VCR 86, and other such playback devices. Other such playback devices include laser-<br>
disk players, digital VCRs, close circuit televisions, camcorders, et cetera. In this system 80, the<br>
multimedia server 88 provides access to the playback equipment devices, e.g., DVD player 82 and<br>
VCR 86, for each of the plurality of clients. Each client may select to receive a DVD playback, a<br>
VCR playback, or playback from any one of the other video sources.<br>
In this illustration, client 26 has selected DVD playback 83. Accordingly, client 26<br>
provides an indication of its selection to client module 90. Client module 90 communicates client<br>
26's selection to the multimedia server 88. The multimedia server 88 processes the selection to<br>
provide the playback data to client module 90. As further shown in Figure 3, client 32 has also<br>
selected DVD playback 83, while clients 28, 30 and 34 have selected VCR playback 87. As such,<br>
each of the associated client modules 92-98 will provide its clients' selection to the multimedia<br>
server 88. The multimedia server 88 processes the selections to produce a stream of outgoing data.<br>
In this example, the stream of outgoing data includes a multiplexing of the DVD playback 83 data<br>
and the VCR playback 87 data. Accordingly, the transmission provided by multimedia server 88 to<br>
the client modules 90-98 identifies which packets and/or frames contain DVD playback data and<br>
which frames and/or packets contain VCR playback data. For example, the multimedia server 88<br>
may tag packets as containing DVD playback data or VCR playback data. Alternatively, the<br>
multimedia server 88 may tag the packets by including the identity of the particular client module<br>
associated with the client that provided the specific VCR or DVD playback request. In either case,<br>
the client modules 90-98 interpret the data transmitted from the multimedia server 88 to extract the<br>
appropriate data for its client. The extracted data is then provided to its client for playback.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the multimedia server 88 may be operably<br>
coupled to the client modules 90-98 via an RF connection, infrared connection and/or a wire' line<br>
connection. In addition, each of the client modules 90-98 may be separate devices and/or included<br>
within its respective client. As one of average skill in the art will further appreciate, the client<br>
modules 90-92 may be implemented in discrete circuit components and/or integrated circuits and<br>
further includes associated programming operations. Similarly, multimedia server 88 may be a<br>
stand-alone device or incorporated within the DVD player 82, VCR 86, and/or any other video<br>
source. The multimedia server 88 may be implemented utilizing discrete components, integrated<br>
circuits and associated programming operations.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a multimedia system 100 that includes a<br>
multimedia server 102, a plurality of client modules 112-120, a plurality of clients 26-34, a digital<br>
audio storage device 104, a DVD audio device 106, a radio receiver 108, and a CD player 110. In<br>
this illustration, the multimedia system 100 provides a selection of multiple audio sources to a<br>
plurality of clients without requiring an independent and direct connection to each of the audio<br>
devices.<br>
In operation, the client modules 112-120 receive a selection request from its respective<br>
clients. The selection request is selecting audio playback from the digital audio storage device 104,<br>
which may be storing MP3 files, digitized audio, et cetera, the DVD audio player 106, the radio<br>
receiver 108, the CD player 110, and/or any other type of audio source.<br>
Upon receiving the selection request, the multimedia server 102 processes the request to<br>
authenticate it and once authenticated, retrieves data from the appropriate audio source 104-110.<br>
The multimedia server 102 multiplexes the audio data from the audio sources 104-110 into a single<br>
transmission. Each of the client modules 112-120 receives the transmission and extract the<br>
relevant portions for its client.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, client 26 has selected to display audio from the digital audio storage<br>
device 104. Accordingly, the client 26 provides the selection request to client module 112, which<br>
is subsequently provided to the multimedia server 102. The multimedia server 102 processes the<br>
request and initiates the playback from the digital audio storage device 104. The audio playback<br>
data from the storage device 104 is received by the multimedia server 102, which multiplexes it<br>
with other audio playback data from other audio sources and provides the single transmission to the<br>
client modules. The transmission from the multimedia server 102 may be in packets and/or frames.<br>
Each packet and/or frame includes a header section that identifies the source of the data and/or the<br>
destination of the data. Accordingly, client module 112 monitors the transmission for data<br>
addressing it and/or identifying the digital audio storage device 104. Upon detecting such data<br>
within the transmission, the client module 112 extracts the data and provides it to the client 26 for<br>
digital audio playback 122.<br>
 Client 28 has selected DVD audio playback 124. Accordingly, client module 114 provides<br>
the selection request to multimedia server 102. Multimedia server 102 initiates the DVD audio<br>
playback via the DVD audio device 106. The DVD audio playback is multiplexed with other audio<br>
playback data and provides the multiplexed data in the single transmission to the client modules.<br>
Client module 114 extracts the DVD audio playback data and provides it to client 28. Client<br>
module 120 provides the same function for client 34.<br>
Client module 116 provides a similar function for client 30 but with respect to CD<br>
playback 126. Accordingly, client module 116 provides the CD playback request of client 30 to<br>
the multimedia server 102. The multimedia server 102 initiates the CD playback via CD player<br>
110 and multiplexes the CD playback data into the transmission stream. Client module 116<br>
extracts the CD playback data from the transmission stream and provides it to client 30.<br>
Client module 118 provides radio playback 128 connectivity to the multimedia server 102<br>
for client 32. In this example, client 32 provides an indication for radio playback and the desired<br>
radio station. Client module 118 provides the request to multimedia server 102, which interprets<br>
the request and selects one of the plurality of channels received via radio receiver 108. The data<br>
from the selected radio channel is multiplexed with the other audio data being processed by the<br>
multimedia server 102. The client module 118 extracts the appropriate radio data from the<br>
transmission and provides it to client 32.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a multimedia system 130 that includes<br>
multimedia server 132, client modules 134-142, clients 26-34, and a plurality of multimedia<br>
sources. The multimedia sources include VCR 86, DVD player 82, digital audio storage device<br>
104, DVD audio 106, radio receiver 108, CD player 110, multimedia source 24, public switch<br>
telephone network 66, wide area network 44, and/or any other type of audio and/or video source.<br>
In this system 130, the clients 26-34 may select playback from, and/or connection to, any one of<br>
the multimedia sources. The selection request from each client module would identify the desired<br>
multimedia source, the client, the desired service and any other information to assist the<br>
multimedia server 132 in processing the request. As such, one client may be accessing the Internet,<br>
while another client is watching a satellite broadcast channel, while another is listening to a CD<br>
playback, while another is talking on the telephone, and yet another is watching a DVD playback.<br>
This is all done via the multimedia server 132 without requiring the clients to have direct access to<br>
. the multimedia sources and without the requirement that each client have its own multimedia<br>
source and/or multimedia source connection. In essence, multimedia server 132 provides the<br>
functionality of one or more of multimedia server 12, 42, 88 and 102 of Figures 1-4. While client<br>
modules 134-142 provide the functionality of one or more of the client modules described<br>
generally with reference to Figures 1-4.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the multimedia server 12, 42, 88, 102,<br>
and/or 132 may be incorporated in a home theatre receiver, television set, modem, set-top box,<br>
cable receiver, satellite receiver, VCR, DVD player, et cetera to provide the networking<br>
functionality as generally described in Figures 1-5. As one of average skill in the art will further<br>
appreciate, the clients 26 - 34 of Figures 1-5 may be any one of a personal computer, a laptop<br>
computer, a personal digital system, a video telephone, a digital telephone, a cellular telephone, a<br>
monitor, a television, a high definition television, a printer, a facsimile machine, and/or any devices<br>
that includes an audio and/or video display.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a schematic block diagram of the multimedia server 12 and client<br>
modules 14-22 of the system 10 of Figure 1. The multimedia server 12 includes a tuning module<br>
150, a channel mixer 152, a transceiving module 154, and a control module 156. The multimedia<br>
server 12 is operably coupled to each of the client modules 14-22 via a communication path 192.<br>
The communication path 192 may be a wire line connection, a transmit wire line connection, a<br>
receive wire line connection, a transceiving radio frequency path, a transmit radio frequency path, a<br>
receive radio frequency path, a transceiving infrared path, a transmitting infrared path, and/or a<br>
receiving infrared path.<br>
Each of the channel modules 14-22 includes a network interface controller 168, a selection<br>
module 170, and a video and/or audio interface 172. The selection module 170 is operably coupled<br>
to receive an input from the client to produce a channel selection 178. Accordingly, if the client is<br>
a television set, the television set provides a signal to the selection module 172 indicating the<br>
channel selected. Alternately, the channel selection module 170 may include a remote control<br>
receiver such that when the remote control of the television is used to change the channel on the<br>
television set, the selection module 170 receives the control signal, interprets it, and produces the<br>
channel selection 178 therefrom.<br>
The network interface controller 168 receives the channel selection 178 and prepares it for<br>
transmission via the communication path 192 to the multimedia server 12. The processing<br>
performed by the network interface controller 168 is dependent on the type of communication path<br>
192. For example, if the communication path is a wire line connection, the channel selection 178<br>
may be processed in accordance with a type of transceiving that includes time division<br>
multiplexing (TDM), frequency division multiplexing (FDM), pulse code modulation (PCM),<br>
amplitude shift keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK),<br>
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), CSMA with<br>
collision avoidance and/or CSMA with collision detection.<br>
The network interface controller 168 provides the process channel selection 178 as a<br>
channel select request 190 to the transceiving module 154 of multimedia server 12. As one of<br>
average skill in the art will appreciate, client modules 14-20 perform a similar function as client<br>
module 22 in producing their respective channel select request 182-188. As one of average skill in<br>
the art will appreciate, the channel selection 178 may include selecting an audio channel, video<br>
channel, a particular audio source (e.g., CD playback), a particular video source (e.g., DVD<br>
player), etc. In addition, the channel select request 182-190 may further include volume adjust,<br>
picture quality settings and adjustments, displaying restrictions, purchase request, picture-in-picture<br>
activation and deactivation, picture-in-picture channel select, video pausing, reverse play, fast<br>
forward, and/or audio muting.<br>
The transceiving module 154 receives the channel select requests 182-190 from the<br>
plurality of client modules 14-22 via the communication path 192. The transceiving module 154<br>
extracts the physical layer information from the requests 182-190 to retrieve the respective channel<br>
select requests 164. The transceiving module 154 provides the channel select request 164 to<br>
control module 156. As an analogy, note that the channel selections 178 may correspond to<br>
network layer data while the channel selection request 182-190 may correspond to physical layer<br>
data of a ISO standardized communication system. As such, channel selection request utilize<br>
physical layer type identification within its header and include in its data section the channel<br>
selections 178. The channel selections include a header section and data section corresponding to<br>
the particular channel selected.<br>
The control module 156 processes the channel select request 164. The processing of the<br>
channel select request includes authenticating the request and preparing a set of channel selection<br>
commands 160 therefrom. The tuning module 150 receives the set of channel selection commands<br>
160 and extracts a set of channels 162 from a plurality of channels 158 based on the set of channel<br>
selection commands 160. The plurality of channels corresponds to channels provided via a satellite<br>
connection, a cable connection, an NTSC broadcast, an HDTV broadcast, a PAL broadcast, et<br>
cetera. The tuning module 150 provides data for each of the channels of the set of channels 162 to<br>
the channel mixer 152.<br>
The channel mixer 152 mixes (i.e., multiplexes) the set of channels 162 to produce a<br>
stream of channel data 166. The mixing of the set of channels includes converting the data of each<br>
channel into a generic data type and then converting the generic data into a specific data format for<br>
transmission as the stream of channel data 166.<br>
The transceiving module 154 transmits the stream of channel data 166 in packets of<br>
channel data 180. Alternatively, the stream of channel data 166 may be transmitted in frames of<br>
channel data. Each of the client modules 14-22 receives the packets, or frames, of channel data<br>
180 via its network interface controller 168.<br>
The network interface controller 168 of each client module interprets the header of each<br>
packet of channel data 180 to determine whether it addresses its corresponding client module. If<br>
so, the network interface controller 168 removes the physical layer portion of the packets of<br>
channel data 180 to retrieve channel data 176. The channel data 176 is provided to the video<br>
and/or audio interface 172. For example, if the channel data 176 is video data, the interface 172 is<br>
a video interface to a display input of the associated client. Alternatively, if the channel data 176 is<br>
audio data, the interface 172 is an audio interface that couples to an audio input of the associated<br>
client.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a schematic block diagram of multimedia server 42 and client modules<br>
46-54 of the multimedia system 40 of Figure 2. The multimedia server 42 includes a modem<br>
interface 202, a processing module 204, memory 206 and a transceiving module 208. The modem<br>
interface 202 is operably coupled to a network connection 200, which in turn is operably coupled to<br>
a wide area network 44. The processing module 204 is also coupled to the public switch telephone<br>
network 66. <br>
Each of the client modules 46-54 includes a network interface controller 168 and a client<br>
interface 222. In operation, the client module, via its client interface 222, receives a request that<br>
indicates the client's desire for either Internet connection via wide area network 44, to place a<br>
telephone call via the PSTN 66, or for client-to-client communication. The client interface 222<br>
provides connectivity to the client via a PCI bus interface, an AC 97 bus interface, a parallel input,<br>
a serial input, et cetera. The network interface controller 168 processes the request from its client<br>
to produce a request packet(s), which is/are transmitted to the transceiving module 208 of the<br>
multimedia server 42.<br>
The transceiving module 208 retrieves the request from the packet(s) in accordance with<br>
the data conveyance protocol used by the multimedia system. The transceiving module provides<br>
the retrieved requests to the processing module 204. The processing module 204 determines<br>
whether the request is valid. If so, the processing module 204 sets up the appropriate interface with<br>
the PSTN 66 and/or the WAN 44. The appropriate interfacing to the PSTN for a telephone<br>
connection includes the processing module 204 performing base station like functions of a cordless<br>
telephone, while the client module and/or client functions as a cordless handset. As a base station,<br>
the processing module 204 initiates a connection with the PSTN 66 to enable a telephone<br>
communication for the requesting client.<br>
If the request was for Internet access via wide area network 44, the appropriate interfacing<br>
includes the processing module activating a network access application for the requesting client.<br>
The network access application may be a web browser application, email application, et cetera.<br>
The particular network access application will be dependent upon the request provided by the<br>
client. Upon activating the network access application, the processing module determines whether<br>
the network connection 200 is actively coupled to the wide area network 44. If not, the processing<br>
module 204 establishes, via the modem interface 202, a connection to wide area network 44<br>
through the network connection 200. At this point, the respective client has access to the Internet.<br>
With the Internet access established, the client interface 222 receives Internet data from the<br>
client and provides it to the network interface controller 168. The Internet data includes inputs<br>
from the client in response to the particular network access application (e.g., web browser, email,<br>
etc.). For example, the inputs for an email application include send a message, read a message, '<br>
compose a message, etc. The corresponding processing of these inputs by multimedia server, via<br>
the network access application, is provided back to the client for display by the client. As such,<br>
from the client's prospective, the client has direct access to the Internet.<br>
The client generates the inputs via a keyboard, touch-screen, and/or other input device and<br>
provides them to the client module via the client interface 222. The client interface 222 provides<br>
the inputs to the network interface controller 168, which packetizes them to produce packets 218.<br>
The packets 218 include a header section and data section. The header section includes identity of<br>
the client module and/or client, the destination address, and other physical layer-type header<br>
information. The data section includes the input data provided by the client. Each client module<br>
46-54 produces packets 210-218 in a similar manner.<br>
The network interface controller 168 provides the packets 210 - 218 to the transceiving<br>
module 208 of the multimedia server 42 via the communication path 192. Since Internet access is<br>
typically a bi-directional communication, the communication path 192 may include a separate<br>
transmit path and a separate receive path. The transmit path may be used for transmitting packets<br>
210-218 to the multimedia server while the receiving path may be used to receive multiplexed<br>
client data 230 from the multimedia server 42.<br>
The transceiving module 208 receives packets 210-218 and removes the physical layer<br>
header information to produce retrieved requests 220. The retrieved requests 220 are provided to<br>
processing module 204, which converts them into network data 224 by executing the network<br>
access application thereon. Note that the network data 224 includes separate data for each of the<br>
clients accessing the WAN. The processing module 204 provides the network data 224 to the<br>
network connection 200, via the modem interface 202, as outbound modem data 234. Responses to<br>
the outbound modem data 234 are received via the network connection 200 as inbound modem data<br>
232. The processing module 204 receives the inbound modem data 232 as received network<br>
packets 226 via the modem interface 202.<br>
The processing module 204 interprets the received network packets 224 to identify the<br>
source and/or destination of the network packets. For each network packet that is destined for a<br>
particular client, the processing module adds header information to address the particular client<br>
thereby producing client data 228. The transceiving module 208 performs the physical layer<br>
interfacing on the client data 228 producing multiplex client data 230.<br>
Each of the client modules 46-54 receives the multiplex client data 232 via the<br>
communication path 192. The network interface controller 168 monitors the multiplex client data<br>
230 to identify packets destined for its client module and its respective client. For each packet the<br>
network interface controller 168 identifies for the corresponding client module, it strips off the<br>
physical layer information and provides the respective client data to the client interface 222. The<br>
client interface 222 provides the respective client data to the client thereby facilitating Internet<br>
access for the particular client.<br>
The multimedia server 42 may also provide intercom, or client-to-client, communications<br>
between the clients of the system 40. In this instance, the client interface 222 would receive a<br>
request for intercom communications from its client. The network interface controller 168 would<br>
packetize this request and provide it to the transceiving module 208 of multimedia server 42. The<br>
processing module 204 processes the request and determines whether the request can be fulfilled.<br>
Whether the request can be fulfilled is based on resource availability of the multimedia server,<br>
bandwidth availability of the communication path 192, and functionality capabilities of the clients<br>
involved in the intercom communication. If the request can be fulfilled, the processing module 204<br>
provides a response to the initiating client module.<br>
Once the intercom communication has been established, the initiating client provides data<br>
to the multimedia server via the network interface controller 168 in packets. The packets include a<br>
header section and a data section, wherein the header section indicates that the data section<br>
includes client-to-client data. Once the processing module 204 receives the packetized intercom<br>
data, the processing module 204 detects that this is a client-to-client communication and processes<br>
the client-to-client data 236. The processing module 204 provides the client-to-client data 236 as<br>
part of the client data 228. The client data 228 includes header information that identifies it as a<br>
client-to-client communication data, telecom data, and/or Internet communication data.<br>
The transceiving module 208 performs the physical layer packetizing of the client data 228<br>
to produce the multiplex client data 230. The targeted client module identifies the packets<br>
containing the client-to-client communication via the network interface controller 168, which strips<br>
off the physical layer portion of the packets and provides the client-to-client data to the client<br>
interface 222. The client interface 222 provides the intercom data to the respective client.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a schematic block diagram of multimedia server 88 and client modules<br>
90-98 of the multimedia communication system 80 of Figure 3. The multimedia server 88 includes<br>
a tuning module 240, a channel mixer 242, a transceiving module 246 and a control module 244.<br>
Each of the client modules 90-98 includes a network interface controller 270, a video and/or audio<br>
interface 172, and a selection module 272.<br>
In operation, the selection module 272 receives an input from a client to produce a source<br>
selection 276. The input from the client indicates the particular multimedia source that is to be<br>
accessed. In this example, the multimedia source may be a DVD player 82., a VCR 86, a<br>
compressed video source 248, closed circuit television system, and/or any other type of video<br>
source. The selection module 272 may receive the input directly from- the client and/or include<br>
circuitry to receive the communication from the remote control device of the client. As such, the<br>
selection module 272 interprets the remote control transmission of the client to produce the source<br>
selection 276. The source selection 276 includes a header section and a data section. The header<br>
section includes the identity of the client module and indicates that the data section including a<br>
request as opposed to actual data.<br>
The source selection 276 is provided to the network interface controller 270, which adds<br>
physical layer overhead onto the source selection 276 and provides it as a select requests 258-266<br>
to the multimedia server 88.<br>
The transceiving module 246 receives the select requests 258-266 and removes the<br>
physical layer overhead. The transceiving module 246 provides the select request 250, which<br>
includes the source selections 276 of the client modules, to the control module 244. The control<br>
module processes the select request 250 to authenticate the request, determine whether the server<br>
can support the request, and, if so, produces a set of selection commands 252.<br>
The tuning module 240 receives the set of selection commands 252 and selects data from<br>
one or more of the multimedia sources 82, 86, and 248 based on the corresponding selection<br>
commands 252. The tuning module 240 provides the data from the selected multimedia sources as<br>
a set of channels 254 to the channel mixer 242.<br>
The channel mixer 242 processes the set of channels 254 by converting the data of each<br>
multimedia source into generic data. The generic data is converted into a specific format video<br>
data, which is then combined into a stream of channel data 256. The transceiving module 246<br>
receives the stream of channel data 256 and packetizes it for transmission as packets of data 268.<br>
Each of the network interface controllers 270 of the client modules 90-98 receives the<br>
packets of data 268. The network interface controller 270 strips off the physical layer overhead<br>
and interprets it to determine whether the packet is destined for its respective client module. If so,<br>
the network interface controller provides the audio and/or video data 274 contained in the packet to<br>
the video and audio interface 172. The video and audio interface 172 provides the data to an audio<br>
input and/or video input of the client.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates a schematic block diagram of multimedia server 102 and client modules<br>
112-120 of multimedia system 100 of Figure 4. In this illustration, multimedia server 102 includes<br>
a transceiving module 286, a control module 284, a tuning module 280, and a channel mixer 282.<br>
Each of the client modules 120 includes a network interface controller 308, a selection module 310<br>
and an audio interface 312.<br>
In operation, the selection module 310 receives an input from its respective client. The<br>
input identifies a particular audio source, such as digital audio storage 104, CD 110, DVD audio<br>
106, radio receiver 108. The input is processed by the selection module 310 to produce a source<br>
selection 314. The source selection 314 identifies the particular source and the corresponding<br>
client. The network interface controller 308 packetizes the source selection 314 and provides it as<br>
a select request 298 - 306 to the multimedia server 102.<br>
The transceiving module 286 receives the select request 298-306 via the communication<br>
path 192 and reconstructs the source selection 314 as selection request 288. The control module<br>
284 receives the select request 288 and determines whether they can be fulfilled. The<br>
determination is based on resources available within the multimedia server 102, bandwidth<br>
availability of communication path 192, authenticity of the particular client, and privilege access<br>
for the particular client. If the selection request for the client can be processed, the control module<br>
produces a selection command 292 for each corresponding select request.<br>
The tuning module 280 receives the set of selection commands 292 and accesses the<br>
playback data from the identified audio source. The audio sources include the digital audio storage<br>
104, which may be storing digitized audio, MP3 files, CD player, DVD audio player 106 and/or a<br>
radio receiver 108. The tuning module 280 outputs the selected playback of the corresponding<br>
audio services as a set of channels 294.<br>
The channel mixer 282 receives the set of channels 294 and converts them into generic<br>
audio data. The generic audio data is then converted into a specific audio data format, which is<br>
combined into a stream of channel data 290. The channel mixer 282 provides the stream of<br>
channel data 290 to the transceiving module 286. The transceiving module 286 packetizes the<br>
stream of channel data 290 and provides it as packets of data 296 to the plurality of client modules<br>
112-120.<br>
The network interface controller 308 of the client module 112-120 receives the packets of<br>
data 296. The network interface controller 308 interprets each packet to determine whether the<br>
packet is for its respective client module 120. For each packet that is for its client module, network<br>
interface controller 308 extracts audio data 316 and provides it to the audio interface 312. The<br>
audio interface 312 provides the audio data 316 for playback to its respective client device.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates a schematic block diagram of multimedia server 132 and client<br>
modules 134-142 of the multimedia communication system 130 of Figure 5. The multimedia<br>
server 132 includes processing module 345, memory 347, channel mixer 342, transceiving module<br>
346, control module 344, and tuning module 340. Each of the client modules 142 includes a<br>
selection module 334, network interface controller 330, client interface 222, video and audio<br>
interface 172, video interface 332, and an audio interface 312.<br>
In this multimedia communication system, a client may select any one of a variety of<br>
multimedia services including client-to-client communications, viewing a channel from a satellite<br>
connection, cable connection, etc., viewing closed circuit television, viewing compressed video<br>
stored in memory, viewing a DVD, viewing a cassette from a VCR, listening to digital audio,<br>
listening to a compact disk, listening to DVD audio, listening to a radio station, accessing the<br>
Internet, and/or participating in a telephone call.<br>
To initiate one or more of these multimedia services, the selection module 334 of a client<br>
module receives an input either from the client device or a remote control device associated with<br>
the client device. The input identifies the particular client as well as identifying the particular<br>
service desired. The selection module 334 interprets the input to produce a source selection 336.<br>
The selection module 334 provides the source selection 336 to the network interface controller 330.<br>
The network interface controller 330 prepares the source selection 336 for transmission to<br>
the multimedia server 132. The preparation may be done by packetizing the source selection 336<br>
for a physical layer type transmission, placing at least a portion of the source selection 336 in an<br>
allocated timeslot in a TDM transmission scheme, responding to a polling request from the<br>
multimedia server 132, requesting and/or receiving a token ring, et cetera. Regardless of the type<br>
of access scheme used, the network interface controller 330 produces a request 320-328, which is<br>
transmitted to the transceiving module 346 of multimedia server 132.<br>
The transceiving module 346 receives the request 320-328 from the client modules 134-<br>
142. The transceiving module 346 processes the request in accordance with the transmission<br>
scheme utilized. For example, if the transmission scheme is carrier sense multiple access, the<br>
transceiving module 346 interprets the header to identify the particular client such that it may<br>
isolate the individual request 320-328. As a further example, if TDM access is utilized, the<br>
transceiving module 346 identifies the particular timeslot allocated to each client module to<br>
identify the corresponding request 320-328. Regardless of the type of transmission scheme<br>
utilized, the transceiving module 346 removes the physical layer type overhead from the requests<br>
320-328 to recapture the source selections 336. The source selections 336 are provided as select<br>
requests 350 to the control module 344.<br>
The transceiving module 346 processes requests 320-328 to identify the particular type of<br>
selection being requested. If the selection is to access one of the multimedia sources, it processes<br>
that as described above. If, however, the transceiving module 346 detects one or more of the<br>
requests 320-328 requesting client-to-client communication, the transceiving module 346 generates<br>
a client-to-client request, which is provided to processing module 345.<br>
The control module 334 interprets each of the select requests 350 in accordance with the<br>
access privileges and authentication processes for each of the client modules 134-142. If the<br>
selection request is valid and the client module has been authenticated, the control module 334<br>
generates a select command for each corresponding request 320-328. The control module 334<br>
provides the select commands as a set of commands 352 to the tuning module 340.<br>
The tuning module 340 processes each of the select commands of the set of commands 352<br>
to identify the multimedia source to be accessed. For each command received, the tuning module<br>
. 340 selects the appropriate channel of the multimedia sources. For multimedia sources that include<br>
a plurality of channels, such as a satellite connection, cable connection, radio receiver, et cetera, the<br>
tuning module 340 selects the particular source and also further selects one of the plurality of<br>
channels from such multimedia sources. The resulting isolated channels are provided to the<br>
channel mixer 342 as a set of channels 348.<br>
The processing module 345 receives client-to-client communication requests and processes<br>
the request to produce client-to-client data 236. The processing module 345 provides the client-to-<br>
client data 236 as client data 228 to the channel mixer 342.<br>
The channel mixer 342 processes the set of channels 348 and, when included, the client<br>
data 228. The channel mixer 342 converts the data of each channel of the set of channels 348 into<br>
generic data. The client data 228 is multiplexed with the generic data of the set of channels 348 to<br>
produce the stream of channel data 354. The channel mixer 342 provides the stream of channel<br>
data 354 to the transceiving module 346.<br>
The transceiving module transmits the stream of channel data 354 in accordance with the<br>
data transmission protocol incorporated by the multimedia communication system. As such, the<br>
stream of channel data 354 is framed, packetized, et cetera to produce packets of data 356 that are<br>
provided via a communication path to each of the client modules 134-142. <br>
The network interface controller 330 of each of the client modules receives the packets of<br>
data 356 and interprets overhead information within the header to determine whether this particular<br>
packet is for the corresponding client module. If so, the network interface controller strips off the<br>
overhead information and further interprets the particular type of data contained in the packet. This<br>
may be done by reading additional overhead information to identify the particular sources of<br>
information and/or accessing memory, which corresponds the anticipated packets with the source<br>
selection 336. If the packets correspond to data received from one of the multimedia sources, the<br>
network interface controller 330 provides audio and/or video data 338 to one or more of the<br>
interfaces 172, 332 or 312. If, however, the data relates to a client-to-client communication,<br>
telephone call or accessing the Internet, the network interface controller 330 provides the received<br>
data to the client interface 222.<br>
Each of the interfaces 172, 222, 332, and 312 interfaces with the respective client devices<br>
either through external ports of the client device such as a serial port, parallel port, or internal<br>
access through a PCI bus, AC 97 bus, et cetera. Once the data is received by the client device, it is<br>
displayed visual and/or audibly as if the client device had direct access to the particular multimedia<br>
source being accessed.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the mixing of data performed by channel<br>
mixer 342 may utilize a prioritization scheme depending on the type of data being mixed. For<br>
example, if the data being mixed includes real time audio and/or video data, such data may take<br>
priority over non-real time video and/or audio. Such real time video and/or audio include<br>
telephone communications, watching live broadcasts, et cetera while non-real time video and/or<br>
audio include viewing a DVD, VCR, listening to digital audio, CD, DVD audio, et cetera. The<br>
non-real time data may be transmitted in large bursts with greater time intervals between the bursts<br>
and still provide a continuous flow of display data. Conversely, real time data is transmitted in<br>
smaller bursts and more frequently.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will further appreciate, the memory 347 of multimedia<br>
server 132, or other memories in any of the multimedia server shown, may enable the multimedia<br>
server to function as a digital VCR. As such, live broadcasts may be captured from a satellite<br>
connection, cable connection, NTSC broadcast, PAL broadcast, HDTV broadcast and stored in<br>
memory for subsequent playback.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will further appreciate, the multimedia server 132 may<br>
couple to one or more of the multimedia sources shown. As such, multimedia server 132 may<br>
include the functionality of any one or all of the multimedia servers shown in Figures 1-4.<br>
Correspondingly, each client module 134-142 may include the functionality of one or more of the<br>
client modules shown in Figures 1-4.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates an alternate schematic block diagram of the multimedia<br>
communication systems shown in Figures 1-5. The multimedia server 12, 42, 88, 102 and/or 132<br>
includes a processing module 360 and memory 362. The multimedia server is operably coupled to<br>
receive one or more of multimedia sources. Such multimedia sources include a plurality of<br>
channels 158 from a satellite connection, cable connection, NTSC broadcast, PAL broadcast,<br>
HDTV broadcast, compressed video 248 from a memory device, camcorder, et cetera, DVD<br>
playback 82, VCR playback 86, stored digital audio 104, CD playback 110, DCD audio playback<br>
106, radio reception 108, internet connection 44, and/or connection to the public switch telephone<br>
network 66.<br>
The processing module 360 may be a single processing device or plurality of processing<br>
devices. Such a processing device may be a microcontroller, microprocessor, microcomputer,<br>
central processing unit, digital signal processor, programmable gate array, state machine, logic<br>
circuitry, and/or any device that manipulates signals (analog and/or digital) based on operational<br>
instructions. The memory 362 may be a single memory device or a plurality of memory devices.<br>
Such a memory device may be a read-only memory, random access memory, system memory, flash<br>
memory, magnetic tape memory, programmable memory, erasable memory, and/or any device that<br>
stores digital information. Note that when the processing module 360 .implements one or more of<br>
its functions via a state machine or logic circuitry, the memory storing the corresponding<br>
instructions is embedded within the circuitry comprising the state machine or logic circuitry. The<br>
functions performed by processing module 360 and stored in memory 362 are generally described<br>
in the logic diagrams of Figures 24-28, which will be discussed below.<br>
In general, the multimedia server provides access for a plurality of clients to one or more of<br>
the multimedia services by receiving requests 182-190, 258-266, 298-306 and/or 320-328 from a<br>
client module. The multimedia server processes the request to produce packets of data 180, 268,<br>
296 and/or 356 or multiplex client data 230 depending on the type of request. In addition, the<br>
client modules may provide packets of information 210-218, which contain data for Internet<br>
connections, telephone connections, and/or client-to-client communications. The multimedia<br>
server processes packets as described generally with reference to Figures 1-10.<br>
Client module 14-22, 46-54, 90-98, 112-120 and/or 134-142 includes a processing module<br>
364 and memory 366. The client module is operably coupled to a client 26, 28, 30, 32 and/or 34 to<br>
provide display data 368. The display data may include audio data, video data and/or text data.<br>
The type of display data 368 will depend on the particular multimedia source being accessed for<br>
the client. The processing module 364 may be a single processing device or a plurality of<br>
processing devices. Such a processing device may be a microprocessor, microcontroller,<br>
microcomputer, central processing unit, programmable gate array, state machine, logic circuitry,<br>
digital signal processor, and/or any device that manipulates signals (analog and/or digital) based on<br>
operational instructions. The memory 366 may be a single memory device or a plurality of<br>
memory devices. Such a memory device may be a read-only memory, random access memory,<br>
erasable memory, flash memory, magnetic tape memory, system memory, and/or any device that<br>
stores digital information. Note that when processing module 364 implements one or more of its<br>
functions via a state machine or logic circuitry, the memory storing the corresponding operational<br>
instructions is embedded within the circuitry comprising the state machine and/or logic circuit.<br>
The functions performed by processing module 364 and stored in. memory 366 are described in<br>
greater detail with reference to Figures 52-62 and have been generally described with reference to<br>
Figures 1-10.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates a more detailed schematic block diagram of multimedia server 12 of<br>
the multimedia communication system of Figure 1. The multimedia server 12 includes the tuning<br>
module 150, the channel mixer 152, the transceiving module 154, and the control module 156. The<br>
tuning module 150 includes a plurality of tuners 370-376, an encoding module 380, and a bus<br>
interface module 382. The channel mixer 152 includes at least one stream parsing module 390, a<br>
memory controller 394, memory 392, a processor 396, and a data transcoding module 388. The<br>
stream parsing module 390 includes a plurality of bit stream modules 398-404.<br>
In operation, the control module 156 provides the set of channel select commands 160 to<br>
the tuning module 150. As shown, each tuner receives an individual channel select command from<br>
the control module 156. Alternatively, the control module 156 provides a stream of data containing<br>
. the channel select commands 160 to the tuning module 150. The tuning module then would<br>
interpret the stream of data to identify the particular commands being received and then provide<br>
individual channel select commands to tuners 370-376. Each of the tuners 370-376 has its input<br>
coupled to receive the plurality of channels 158.<br>
The plurality of channels may be received via a satellite connection, cable connection,<br>
NTSC broadcast, PAL broadcast, HDTV broadcast, et cetera. Accordingly, each of the tuners 370-<br>
376 would include a corresponding tuner functionality and construction. For example, if the<br>
plurality of channels 158 is being received via an NTSC broadcast, each of the tuners includes a<br>
television- encoder to isolate one of the plurality of channels and produce digitized video as an<br>
output. Alternatively, if the plurality of channels 158 is received via a satellite connection, each of<br>
the tuners includes a satellite tuner as found in commercially available satellite receivers. The<br>
satellite tuner outputs, in MPEG 2 format, one or more channels of the plurality of channels.<br>
Similarly, for HDTV, cable TV, et cetera the tuners would be of a construct corresponding to the<br>
particular source of the plurality of channels. Since the construct of such tuners for each of the<br>
sources is known, no further discussion will be presented for the tuners except to further illustrate<br>
the concepts of the present invention.<br>
Each tuner 370-376 outputs a selected channel 384 and provides it to the encoding module<br>
380. The encoding module 380 encodes each of the selected channels 384 based on the encoding<br>
scheme used by the multimedia server 12 to produce encoded channel data 386. The encoding<br>
scheme may be one or more of multilevel encoding, non-return to zero encoding, Manchester<br>
encoding, block encoding and/or nB/mB encoding where in n &gt; m. For example, the nB/mB may<br>
be 4B/5B encoding where 4 bits of actual data are converted into 5 bits of encoded data. In<br>
addition, the encoding attaches a header portion, which identifies the particular channel. The<br>
encoded channel data 386 is placed on a bus coupling the tuning module 150 to the channel mixer<br>
152 by a bus interface module 382.<br>
The bus interfacing module 382 places the encoded channel data 386 on the bus in<br>
accordance with the particular data transport scheme used within multimedia server 12. For<br>
example, the data conveyance protocol may be carrier sense multi-access, TDMA, et cetera.<br>
The channel mixer 152 is operably coupled to receive the encoded channel data 386 from<br>
tuning module 150. The channel mixer 152 receives the encoded channel data 386 via the stream<br>
parsing module 390. The stream parsing module 390 includes a plurality of bit stream modules<br>
398-404. Each of the bit stream modules 398-404 monitors the bus for data corresponding to a<br>
particular channel of interest. Accordingly, each of the bit stream modules 398-404 is allocated to<br>
process data related to a particular client module. For example, bit stream module 398 may be<br>
allocated to process data for client module 14 of Figure 1, while bit stream module 400 is allocated<br>
to process data for client module 16 of Figure 1, et cetera.<br>
Each bit stream module 398-404 includes a bits interface module (not shown) to monitor<br>
the bus to detect the identity the relevant data. As one of average skill in the art will appreciate,<br>
alternatively, the channel mixer 152 may include a bus interface module that provides a single<br>
connection to receive all of the data, wherein the bus interface module interprets the data and<br>
provides it to the appropriate bit stream module 398-404. Each of the bit stream modules 398-404<br>
isolates data of its corresponding channel of interest 406 and provides the data to memory 392 via<br>
memory controller 394.<br>
As the data corresponding to each channel of interest 406 is stored in memory 392, the<br>
processing module 396 is converting the channel of interest 406 from its original format into<br>
generic data. The processor 396 causes the generic data to be stored in memory 392 via memory<br>
controller 394. For example, if the channel of interest corresponds to video data received from one<br>
of the multimedia sources, the processor converts the specific formatted video data (e.g., MPEG IT)<br>
of the multimedia source into a generic video data. Such generic video data may be formatted as<br>
MPEG video data, JPEG data, M-JPEG video data, digital RGB data and/or digital YCBCR data.<br>
If the data for the channel of interest is audio data, the processor 396 converts the<br>
formatted of audio data from its original format into generic audio data, such as MPEG formatted<br>
audio data, MP3 formatted data, and/or PCM digitized audio data.<br>
The data transcoding module 388 retrieves the generic data 392 from memory via the<br>
memory controller 394 to produce a stream of channel data 166. If the generic data is generic<br>
video data, the transcoding module 388 converts the generic video data into a specific video data<br>
format, such as MPEG II, to produce the stream of channel data 166. If, however, the generic data<br>
includes generic audio data, the data transcoding module 383 converts it into a specific audio<br>
format, such as MP3. If the data is Internet data, telecommunication data, and/or client-to-client<br>
communication data, the transcoding module 388 provides the data unaltered as part of the stream<br>
of channel data 166.<br>
The transceiving module 154 receives the stream of channel data 166 and processes it to<br>
produce packets of channel data 180. The processing performed by the transceiving module 154 is<br>
in accordance with the data conveyance protocol of the multimedia server. As such, the processing<br>
adds overhead information to identify the particular portions of the stream of channel data 166 that<br>
is destined for individual client modules.<br>
Figure 13 illustrates a more detailed schematic block diagram of multimedia server 42 of<br>
the multimedia communication system of Figure 2. As shown, the multimedia server 42 includes a<br>
modem interface 202, processing module 204, memory controller 418, transceiving module 208,<br>
memory 206, and video graphics processing applications 420. The modem interface 202 is<br>
operably coupled to a modem 426, which provides the network connection 200. Note that the<br>
modem 426 may be an xDSL modem, a wireless modem, a 56K modem, a cable modem, an ISDN<br>
modem, or a connection to a home network. In addition, the modem interface 202 provides<br>
coupling to the public switch telephone network 66. As one of average skill in the art will<br>
appreciate, the multimedia server 42 may provide one or more of the functions of an Internet<br>
connection, connection to the public switch telephone network, and client-to-client<br>
communications.<br>
The video graphics processing applications 420 may be software applications stored in<br>
memory 206 and executed by processing module 204. Alternatively, the video graphics process<br>
applications 420 may be executed by a single or multiple video graphics processors operable<br>
coupled to memory controller 418. In any implementation, the video graphics process applications<br>
420 prepare video data for display on a CRT, LCD panel, et cetera.<br>
The memory 206 stores a plurality of software applications including client service<br>
software 416, cordless telephone software 422, client-to-client software 424, modem allocation<br>
software 414, a plurality of web browser applications 410, and a plurality of email applications<br>
412. The memory 206 also stores client display data 422. The client display data 422 is processed<br>
by the video graphics process applications 420 to produce outgoing display data.<br>
In operation, the transceiving module 208 receives packets 210-218 from the plurality of<br>
client modules. Initially, the packets 210-218 include header information that identifies the<br>
particular client, information indicating that this is a service request packet, and its payload<br>
includes identity of the particular service being requested. The particular service being requested<br>
may be accessed to the Internet, participating in a telephone conversation via the PSTN, and/or<br>
client-to-client communications.<br>
When the packets are received by the multimedia server, the transceiving module 208<br>
removes the physical layer overhead information from the packets and provides retrieved requests<br>
220 to memory controller 418. Memory controller 418 causes the retrieved requests 220 to be<br>
stored in memory 206. The processing module 204 retrieves the retrieved requests 220 to initiate<br>
processing of the requests. For requests indicating a particular type of service, the processing<br>
module 204 interprets the request to identify the service being requested. As an alternative to<br>
routing received request packets through memory controller 418, the receive request packets may<br>
be placed in a buffer and directly accessed by processing module 204 from the buffer.<br>
The processing module 204 evokes the client service software 416 to interpret the received<br>
packets to identify whether the packets are requesting a particular type of service, what that service<br>
is, and/or identifying the packets as data packets. If the processing module 204 determines, via the<br>
client software 416, that the request is for a telephone conversation via the PSTN 66, the<br>
processing module 204 evokes the cordless phone software 422. If, however, the request is for<br>
client-to-client communication, the processing module 204 evokes the client-to-client software<br>
424. If, however, the request is for access to the Internet, the processing module 204 evokes either<br>
an email application 412 or a web browser application depending on the particular type of access<br>
being requested.<br>
For client-to-client communications, the transceiving module 208 receives packets<br>
containing communication data. The packets will be processed by the transceiving module to<br>
remove the physical layer overhead and provide the receive packets 220 to memory controller 418.<br>
The receive packets will be stored in the memory 206. The processing module 204, via the client-<br>
to-client software 424, retrieves the client-to-client communication data from memory 206 and<br>
processes it to produce client-to-client data 236. The processing module 204 provides the client-to-<br>
client data 236 to the memory controller 418 for storage in memory 206. The transceiving module<br>
208 causes the memory controller 418 to retrieve the client-to-client data 236 from memory 206<br>
and provide it as client data 228. The transceiving module 208 multiplexes the client data 228 for<br>
the client-to-client communication with other services being supported for the client modules to<br>
produce multiplex client data 230. The multiplex client data also includes the physical layer<br>
overhead to identify the individual packets once received by the client modules.<br>
If the service request is for a telephone conversation via the PTSN 66, the processing<br>
module 204 evokes the cordless phone software 422. Accordingly, as the processing module 204<br>
retrieves receive packets 220 from memory 206, it performs the cordless phone software 422 upon<br>
the data, In essence, the cordless phone software 422 causes the multimedia server 422 to act as a<br>
base station while the client module and/or client acts as the cordless handset. The telephone<br>
functionality utilizes a dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signaling for keying in the numbers.<br>
The transmission rate between the multimedia server 42 and the handset may utilize traditional<br>
900Mhz cordless phone frequencies, 2.4 gigahertz frequencies, and/or CDMA (code division<br>
multiple access) technology.<br>
The processing module 204, upon processing the receive packets 220, produces network<br>
data 224 which is provided to the modem interface 202. The modem interface provides the<br>
network data 224 to the PSTN 66. Accordingly, the processing module 204 includes an identifier<br>
within the network data 224 such that the modem interface 202 knows to provide it to the PSTN 66<br>
as opposed to the modem 426.<br>
For incoming telecommunication data, the modem interface 202 provides the data as<br>
received network packets 226 to the processing module 204. The processing module 204 while<br>
performing the cordless phone software 422 processes the receive network packets 226 to produce<br>
client data 228. The client data 228 is temporarily stored in memory 206 before being transmitted<br>
to the clients as part of the multiplex client data 230 by the transceiving module 208.<br>
If the requested service is to access to the Internet, the packets 210-218 received by the<br>
transceiving module 208 are temporarily stored in memory 206 as received packets 220. The<br>
processing module 204 evokes either the email application 412 or the web browser application 410<br>
depending on the particular type of Internet access requested. For web browsing access, the<br>
processing module 204 accesses the web browser application 410. For email Internet access, the<br>
processing module 204 evokes the email application 412. The email applications 412 and web<br>
browser applications 410 are known, thus no further discussion will be provided as to their<br>
functionality except to further illustrate the concepts of the present invention.<br>
For web browser access, the processing module 204 evokes the web browsing application<br>
410 to process the received packets 220. Such processing yields network data 224, which is<br>
provided to the modem interface 202. The modem interface provides the network data 224 as<br>
outbound modem data 234.<br>
Responses from the Internet are received by modem 426 and provided to the modem<br>
interface 202 as inbound modem data 232. The modem interface 202 provides the inbound modem<br>
data 232 as received network packets 226 to the processing module 204, while executing the web<br>
browser application 410 produces processed packets which are stored in memory 206. The video<br>
graphics process application 420 retrieves the processed packets from memory 206, and performs<br>
its associated video graphics processing to produce client display data 422. The memory controller<br>
418 retrieves the client display data 422 and provides it as client data 228 to transceiving module<br>
208. The transceiving module processes the client data 228 to add physical layer overhead<br>
information and multiplexes it with other client data being processed, and transmits the multiplex<br>
client data to the client modules.<br>
For email Internet access, the processing module 204 evokes the email application 412 to<br>
process the receive packets 220. The processing yields network data 224 that is provided to the<br>
modem 426 as outbound modem data 234 via the modem interface 202. Email responses are<br>
received by modem 426 and provided as inbound modem data 232 to the modem interface 202.<br>
The modem interface 202 provides the receive data as received network packets 226 to the<br>
processing module 204. The processing module 204 performs the email application 412 upon the<br>
received network packets 226 to yield the processed data. The processed data is stored in memory<br>
206 and accessed by the video graphics processing application 420. The video graphics processing<br>
application 420 performs a video graphics processing function upon the processed data to produce<br>
client display data 422. The client display data 422 is subsequently retrieved by memory controller<br>
418 and provided as client data 228 to the transceiving module 208.<br>
When only one client is accessing the Internet, the client has exclusive access to modem<br>
426, such that no allocation of the network connection is needed. In addition, when only one client<br>
is accessing the Internet, only one email application and/or one web browser application is open for<br>
the client. Once, however, two or more clients are accessing the Internet, the processing module<br>
evokes an email application and/or web browser application for each client. In addition, the<br>
processing module 204 may be executing multiple email applications and/or multiple web browser <br>
applications for multiple clients. When this is the case, allocation of the modem needs to be shared<br>
amongst the clients accessing the Internet. To do this, the processing module 204 evokes the<br>
modem allocation software 414.<br>
The modem allocation software 414 allocates access to modem 426 among the plurality of<br>
clients. The modem allocation software may be based on a TDMA function, a CSMA function,<br>
token ring passing, polling function, et cetera. Accordingly, the processing module 204 provides<br>
access to the particular client based on the modem allocation software 414 such that each client has<br>
substantially equal access to the Internet.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, by storing the email applications 412 and<br>
web browser applications 410 within the multimedia server 42, the clients appear to have<br>
independent access to the Internet, while in actuality it is shared amongst a plurality of clients. The<br>
video graphics processing applications 420, in combination with the email applications and/or web<br>
browser applications 410, cause the data corresponding to the processing of the applications to<br>
appear as if the client device was processing the applications. As one of average skill in the-art will<br>
further appreciate, if the client device includes video graphics processing, which is typically<br>
included in a personal computer, then the video graphics processing application 420 may be<br>
bypassed within the multimedia server 442. Accordingly, the processed data by the web browser<br>
application 410 or email application 412 may be packetized, without producing the client display<br>
data 422 and provided as client data 228 to the respective client device. The respective client<br>
device would then perform its own video graphics process of data to produce the display data. The<br>
overall functionality of multimedia server 42 will be described in greater detail with reference to<br>
Figures 57 - 62.<br>
 Figure 14 illustrates a schematic block diagram of multimedia server 88 of the multimedia<br>
communication system of Figure 3. The multimedia server 88 includes timing module 240,<br>
channel mixer 242, transceiving module 246, and control module 244. The tuning module 240<br>
includes a plurality of multiplexors 430-434, an encoding module 380 and a bus interface module<br>
382. The channel mixer 242 includes at least one stream parsing module 391, memory controller<br>
394, memory 392, processor 396 and a data transcoding module 388.<br>
In operation, the control module 244 receives select request 250 from the client modules<br>
and produces therefrom a set of select commands 252. Each of the select commands is provided to<br>
one of the multiplexors 430-434. The multiplexors 430-434 each have its inputs coupled to single<br>
channel video sources such as a DVD player 82, VCR 86, compressed video source 248, closed<br>
circuit television, laser disk player, camcorder, et cetera. Each of the multiplexors 430-434 outputs<br>
one of the single channel multimedia sources as a selected channel 436 based on the respective<br>
select command 252.<br>
The encoding module 380 receives the selected channels 436 from each of the multiplexors<br>
430-434 and encodes the selected channels to produce encoded channel data 438. The encoding<br>
scheme used by encoding module 380 may be multilevel encoding, non-return to zero encoding,<br>
Manchester encoding, block encoding, nB/mB encoding where n 
438 is provided to the channel mixer 242 as a set of channels 254 via the bus interface module 382.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the tuning module 240 has each of the<br>
multiplexors 430-434 processing requests from an individual client module. For example, if only<br>
one client module is accessing a single channel multimedia source, only one multiplexor is evoked<br>
to produce the selected channel. As more and more clients access single source multimedia<br>
devices, more and more multiplexors are evoked. If multiple clients are accessing the same<br>
multimedia source, such as DVD player 82, only one multiplexor is evoked wherein the processing<br>
of the selected channel for multiple clients includes the identity of the multiple clients and/or the<br>
selected channel such that each of the clients accessing the same single channel multimedia source<br>
will receive the same data.<br>
The channel mixer 242 receives the set of channels 254 via its stream parsing module 391.<br>
In particular, each of the bit stream modules 440-446 is monitoring the bus for data related to the<br>
particular channel of interest 448 it is processing. Accordingly, each bit stream module 440-446 is<br>
processing data for a particular client module. Each bit stream module 440-446 receives the set of<br>
channels 254 and produces a respective channel of interest 448. As such, the bit stream modules<br>
440-446 filter out the data of all other channels but the channel of interest. The data corresponding<br>
to each channel of interest 448 is stored in memory 392 via memory controller 394.<br>
Processor 396 retrieves the data for each channel of interest 448 and converts the specific<br>
formatted video data into a generic video data. The generic video data is stored in memory 392 via<br>
memory controller 394.<br>
The data transcoding module 388 retrieves the generic video data from memory 392 and<br>
produces therefrom a stream of channel data 256. The processing performed by the data<br>
transcoding module 388 includes converting the generic video data into specific formatted video<br>
data. The specific formatted video data comprises the stream of channel data 256.<br>
The transceiving module 246 receives the stream of channel data 256 and produces<br>
therefrom packets of data 268. The transcoding module 246 adds the physical layer overhead of<br>
the particular data conveyance protocol used by the multimedia communication system to produce<br>
the packets of data 268.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates a schematic block diagram of multimedia server 102 used in the<br>
multimedia communication system of Figure 4. The multimedia server 102 includes tuning<br>
module 208, channel mixer 282, transceiving module 286, and control module 284. The tuning<br>
module 280 includes multiplexors 456-460, tuners 450-454, an encoding module 464 and a bus<br>
interface module 382. The channel mixer 282 includes at least one stream parsing module 392,<br>
memory controller 394, memory 392, processing module 396, and a data transcoding module 388.<br>
In operation, the control module 284 receives select request 288 from a plurality of client<br>
modules. The control module 284 processes the select request 288 to produce a set of select<br>
commands 292. The select commands are provided to one or more of the plurality of tuners 450-<br>
454 and/or the plurality of multiplexors 456-460. The plurality of tuners 450-454 have a radio<br>
receiver 108 operably coupled to its inputs, where the radio receiver may be an antenna for<br>
receiving AM and/or FM radio transmissions. The tuners 450-454 are constructed of conventional<br>
circuitry to tune into a particular radio station from a plurality of radio stations. The construct of<br>
such tuners is known, as such no further discussion of the functionality or construct of the tuners<br>
450-454 will be described except to further illustrate the present invention.<br>
Based on the respective select command, each tuner 450-454 selects a particular channel of<br>
the radio channels received. The output of each tuner is an input for each of the multiplexors 456-<br>
460. Each of the multiplexors 456-460 also includes an input for other single audio channel<br>
multimedia sources. Such single audio channel multimedia sources include CD players 1.10, DVD<br>
audio players 106, digital audio storage devices 104, et cetera.<br>
Based on the respective select commands 292, each of the multiplexors 456-460 outputs a<br>
particular selected channel 462. Accordingly, the selected channel 462 may be one of the single<br>
audio channel multimedia sources or the output of one of the plurality of tuners 450-454.<br>
The encoding module 464 receives the selected channels 462 and encodes them to produce<br>
encoded channel data 468. The encoding performed by encoding module 464 may be one or more<br>
of multilevel encoding, non-return to zero encoding, Manchester encoding, block encoding, nB/mB<br>
encoding where n 
bus interface module 382.<br>
The channel mixer 282 receives the encoded channel data 468 as a set of channels 294.<br>
The stream parsing module 392 includes a plurality of bit stream modules 470 through 476, which<br>
receive the set of channels 294 and extracts data related to a particular channel of interest 478.<br>
Accordingly, each bit stream module 470-476 is supporting a particular channel selection request<br>
of a particular client module. Each of the bit stream modules 470 filters out the data of other<br>
channels such that .only the data of the channel of interest is passed. The data corresponding to the<br>
channels of interest 478 is stored in memory 392 via memory controller 394.<br>
The processing module 396 retrieves the data corresponding to the channels of interest 478<br>
from memory 392 and converts the specific formatted audio data into generic formatted audio data.<br>
The generic formatted audio data is stored in memory 392. Such generic formatted audio data may<br>
be PCM digitized audio, MP3 audio, MPEG audio, et cetera.<br>
The transcoding module 388 retrieves the generic audio data from memory and converts it<br>
into a specific audio format. Such specific audio format may be MP3 audio, MPEG audio, et<br>
cetera. The data transcoding module 388 provides the specific audio formatted data of a stream of<br>
channel data 290 to the transceiving module 286. As one of average skill in the art will appreciate,<br>
the data transcoding module 388 may process the audio data from audio sources in a similar<br>
manner as it processes audio data from multimedia sources such as a DVD player, CD player,<br>
satellite connection, et cetera.<br>
The transceiving module 286 converts the stream of channel data 290 into packets of data<br>
296. The transceiving module utilizes the data conveyance protocol of the multimedia<br>
communication system to add physical layer overhead to the data of the stream of channel data 290<br>
to produce packets. The packets are then conveyed to the plurality of client modules.<br>
Figure 16 illustrates a schematic block diagram of multimedia server 132 that may be used<br>
in the multimedia communication system of Figure 5. The multimedia server 132 includes the<br>
transceiving module 346 (not shown), the control module 344, the tuning module 340, the channel<br>
mixer 342, the processing module 345, and memory 347. The tuning module 340 includes a<br>
plurality of HDTV tuners 480, a plurality of multiplexors 430-434, a plurality of audio tuners 450-<br>
454, a second plurality of multiplexors 456-458, a modem interface 202, an audio encoding module<br>
464, a video/audio encoding module 380, and a bus interface module 382.<br>
The channel mixer 342 includes a first plurality of stream parsing modules 391, a second<br>
plurality of stream parsing modules 390, a third plurality of stream parsing modules 393, and a data<br>
transcoding module 388. The multimedia server 132 may further include, or be operably coupled<br>
to, components within the host device. The host device may be a satellite receiver, cable box, set-<br>
top box, home theatre receiver, HDTV tuner, et cetera. The host device includes a host processor<br>
482, a memory bridge 484, host memory 486, and a hard drive 488. To interface with the host<br>
components, the multimedia server 132 further comprises a direct memory access (DMA) device<br>
490.<br>
In this configuration, the control module 344 receives selection request via the host bus and<br>
produces therefrom a set of commands 352. The set of commands are provided to individual ones<br>
of the HDTV tuners 480, the multiplexors 430-434, the audio tuners 450-454, multiplexors 456-<br>
460, and/or the modem interface. As such, each of the elements of the tuning module will respond<br>
to an individual selection command accordingly.<br>
If an HDTV tuner 480 receives a select command 352, it selects a particular channel from a<br>
satellite or cable source 488. The selected channel is provided to the encoding module 380. If one<br>
of the multiplexors 430-434 receives a select command, it outputs one of the single channel<br>
multimedia video sources such as a DVD player 82, compress video 248, VCR 86. The output of<br>
the multiplexor 430-434 is provided to encoding module 380. The encoding module 380 converts<br>
the audio and video data of the single channel into encoded data as previously discussed.<br>
If one of the audio tuners 450-454 receives a select command, it selects a particular radio<br>
channel from a plurality of radio channels of radio receiver-108. The output of the tuner is<br>
provided to encoding module 464. If one of the multiplexors 456-460 receives a select command,<br>
it provides its output to the encoding module 464. As shown, the inputs to the multiplexors 456-<br>
460 include DVD audio 106, digital audio storage 104 and CD 110. The encoding module 464<br>
encodes the received audio data of a selected channel as previously discussed.<br>
The outputs of encoding module 380 and 464 are provided to the bus interface module 382.<br>
The bus interface module provides the encoded data to the channel mixing circuit. In addition, the<br>
bus interface module 382 is operably coupled to the modem interface 202 and to the public switch<br>
telephone network 66. The modem interface and PSTN connection provide the multimedia server<br>
132 the ability to service clients as previously described with reference to Figures 2, 7 and 13.<br>
The stream parsing modules 390, 391 and 393 receive the encoded channel data and filter<br>
the encoded channel data down to a particular channel of interest. The data corresponding to the<br>
particular channel of interest is stored in memory 347 via memory controller 394. The processing<br>
module 345 retrieves the data of the channels of interest from memory 347 and converts the data<br>
into generic audio data and/or generic video data. The generic audio and/or video data is stored in<br>
memory 347.<br>
The data transcoding module 388 retrieves the generic audio and/or video data from<br>
memory 347 and converts it into a specific audio format, which is then provided as a stream of data<br>
to the transceiving module 346 for conveyance to the plurality of clients.<br>
The hard drive 488 may store the digital audio, which is provided as digital audio storage<br>
104. Accordingly, the digital audio may be stored in an MP3 format, PCM audio, and/or any<br>
means for digitizing for storing digital audio signals. In addition, the hard drive 488 may function<br>
as a digital VCR such that any of the channels of the multimedia sources may be stored in hard<br>
drive 488 and subsequently played back. Accordingly, host memory 486 would include the<br>
appropriate software to enable host processor 482 to retrieve the data from hard drive 488 as a<br>
digital VCR.<br>
Figure 17 illustrates a functional diagram of a tuning module, which may be used in any of<br>
the multimedia servers as described in the previous figures. While the functional diagram of<br>
Figure 17 relates to processing data utilizing an HDTV tuner, the principles are common for<br>
processing data from any multi-channel multimedia source. For example, the plurality of channels<br>
36 shown in Figure 17 may correspond to channels received by a satellite connection, cable<br>
connection, NTSC connection, PAL connection, broadcast connection, radio receiver connection,<br>
et cetera.<br>
As shown in Figure 17, a plurality of channels 36 includes a channel identifier and the<br>
corresponding audio and/or video data. In this illustration, channel 001 includes channel 001 audio<br>
and video data, channel 002 includes channel 002 audio and video data, et cetera. As also<br>
illustrated, channel 002, channel 004 and channel 901 have been selected by different clients to be<br>
viewed. Accordingly, the set of channel selection commands 160 identifies these particular<br>
channels.<br>
HDTV tuners 376, 374 and 480 each process one of the channel select commands. As<br>
shown, HDTV tuner 376 is processing the channel select command for channel 002, HDTV tuner<br>
374 is processing the channel select command for channel 004 and HDTV tuner 480 is processing<br>
the channel select command for channel 901. As shown, each HDTV tuner 376 receives all of the<br>
plurality of channels 36. The.output of each HDTV tuner 376 is of its corresponding selected<br>
channel. As shown, HDTV tuner 376 is outputting audio and video data 500 for channel 002,<br>
HDTV tuner 374 is outputting audio and video data 502 for channel 004 and HDTV tuner 480 is<br>
outputting audio and video data 503 for channel 901.<br>
The audio/video data 500 for channel 002 includes a plurality of frames 504-518. Each<br>
frame may correspond to an I frame, a B frame, and/or a P frame of MPEG video data. The<br>
audio/video data 500 of channel 002 is provided to encoding module 380. Similarly, audio/video<br>
data 502 of channel 004 includes a plurality of frames 520-534 and audio/video data 503 of<br>
channel 901 includes a plurality of frames 540-554.<br>
The encoding module 380 encodes the audio/video data 500, 502 and 503 of the respective<br>
channels. The resulting data is encoded channel data 386, which includes a plurality of packets<br>
560, 566, and 572. As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the packets 560, 566 and 572<br>
may also be frames depending on the data conveyance protocol used within the multimedia<br>
communication system. For packet based transmission, which is illustrated in Figure 17, the<br>
encoding module 380 packetizes data'from each of the selected channels (for this example, channel<br>
002, 004 and 901) in a round-robin fashion. As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, other<br>
schemes may be used to determine which data of a particular channel of interest will be processed<br>
and in what order. For example, one channel may have priority over another, which may be the<br>
case for real time transmissions versus non-real time data transmissions.<br>
la this illustration, packet 560 includes a header portion 564 and a data payload 562. The<br>
header section 564 may include identity of the selected channel, type of data of the selected<br>
channel, identity of the multimedia source, an indication as to whether the data is encrypted or not,<br>
an indication of the type of encryption, an indication as to whether the data is compressed or not,<br>
an indication of the type of compression, and/or a packet sequence number. Accordingly, the<br>
header information 564 includes all the necessary information for the client modules to accurately<br>
retrieve the data contained in payload 562. As shown, a first portion of frame 504 of the<br>
audio/video data 500 for channel 002 is included in payload 562.<br>
Packet 566 includes header information 568 and a payload 570. The header information<br>
568 includes similar information as header 564 but directed towards data related to audio/video<br>
data 502. The payload section 570 carries data from a first portion of frame 520 of audio/video<br>
data 502. Packet 572 includes header 574 and payload 576. The header 574 includes similar<br>
header information as 564 but directed towards the audio/video data 503. The payload 576<br>
includes a portion of frame 540.<br>
The next three packets encoded by encoding module 380 will be for the second portion of<br>
each of frames 504, 520 and 540. The encoding module will continue to packetize portions of<br>
frames 504, 520 and 540 until the entire frame has been conveyed. Once the entire frame has been<br>
conveyed, the encoding module 380 encodes sections of the next frame in the sequence of the<br>
audio/video data 500, 502 and 503. The encoded channel data 386 is then conveyed as packets<br>
utilizing carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), CSMA with collision avoidance, and/or CSMA<br>
with collision detection.<br>
While Figure 17 is illustrated with respect to packetizing the encoded channel data 386,<br>
one of average skill in the art will appreciate that the encoding module 380 may utilize a TDMA<br>
concept wherein the encoded channel data 386 is prepared as frames. Accordingly, packets 560,<br>
566 and 572 will be replaced by frames where each frame includes a header section and a data<br>
section. The header section includes one or more of the identity of the selected channel, the type of<br>
data of the selected channel, the identity of the multimedia source, an indication as to whether<br>
encryption is enabled or disabled, the type of encryption used, an indication as to whether<br>
compression is enabled or disabled, an indication of the type of compression, and a frame number.<br>
As such, the header information and the timing of the frames includes sufficient information such<br>
that the client modules may accurately retrieve the data contained in the respective data sections or<br>
payloads.<br>
The encoded channel data 386 is then conveyed in frames in accordance with time division<br>
multiplexing, and/or frequency division multiplexing.<br>
Figure 18 illustrates a functional diagram of the channel mixer that may be used in any one<br>
of the multimedia servers of Figures 1-11. As shown, a set of channels 162 is received as encoded<br>
channel data 386. The encoded channel data 386 includes a plurality of packets 560, 566 and 572.<br>
Each packet 560, 566 and 572 includes a header section 564, 568, 574 and a payload section 562,<br>
570 and 576, respectively.<br>
The channel mixer includes a plurality of stream parsing modules 390A, 390B and 390C<br>
operably coupled to respective bus interfaces 580-584. The respective bus interfaces 580-584 are<br>
receiving each of the plurality of packets and reading the header section. When the bus interface<br>
module 580-584 detects that the particular packet relates to the specific channel select request 586,<br>
588 or 590, the bus interface provides the payload section and a portion of the header sectionto the<br>
remaining circuitry of the stream parsing module 390A, 390B and/or 390C.<br>
Each of the stream parsing modules 390A, B and C are extracting data 592., 594 and 596<br>
from the payload of packets corresponding to the specific channel select request 586, 588 and 590.<br>
The data 592, 594 and 596 is stored in memory 392 until the entire video frame 504, 520 and/or<br>
540 is stored.<br>
Once each of the video frames 504, 520 and 540 is stored, processor 396A, B and/or C<br>
retrieves the respective data of the corresponding video frame 504, 520 or 540 from memory and<br>
converts it into generic data 598, 600, 602. The generic data is stored in memory 392. The data<br>
transcoding module 388 retrieves the generic data 598, 600, 602 from memory 392 and converts it<br>
into a specific video and/or audio data format and conveys the converted data as a stream of<br>
channel data 166 to the plurality of clients.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the processors 3 96A, B and C may<br>
process the data of the video frames 504, 520 and 540 as the data 592, 594 and 596 is being stored<br>
in memory. In other words, the processors do not have to wait until the entire video frame is stored<br>
to begin converting the data into the generic data 598, 600 and 602.<br>
While Figure 18 is illustrated with respect to receiving packets of encoded channel data<br>
386, one of average skill in the art will appreciate that the packets may be frames of data.<br>
Accordingly, the bus interface modules 580-584 would monitor the bus for frames of data to be<br>
processed by the respective stream parsing modules 390A, B or C. The determination of the<br>
particular frames to retrieve is based on the specific channel select request 586, 588 or 590.<br>
Accordingly, any data related to the specific channel select request 586, 588, 590 is obtained by the<br>
corresponding stream parsing module 390A, B or C and converted into data 592, 594 or 596.<br>
Figure 19 illustrates a functional diagram of the tuning module of any of the multimedia<br>
servers of Figures 1-11 processing single video channel multimedia sources. As shown,<br>
multiplexors 430-434 are operably coupled to receive video data from a plurality of single channel<br>
multimedia sources. Such single channel multimedia sources include DVD players, compressed<br>
video storage devices, VCRs, camcorders, etc. As shown, video frames 614 from a DVD player 82<br>
are provided to each of the multiplexors 430-434 as well as MPEG frames 612 of compressed<br>
video 248 and digitized video data 610 from a VCR 86. Each of the multiplexors 430-434 is<br>
processing a separate channel selection request. As illustrated, multiplexor 430 is processing a<br>
channel select request for providing video frames 614 related to the DVD player 82, multiplexor<br>
432 is processing MPEG frame 612 from a compressed video source 248, and multiplexor 434 is<br>
processing the digitized video data 610 from a VCR 86.<br>
As shown, the video frame 614 includes a plurality of frames 616-630. The MPEG frame<br>
612 include a plurality of frames 632-646, while the digitized video data 610 includes a stream of<br>
digitized video data 648.<br>
The encoding module 380 receives the video frame 614, the MPEG frame 612, and the<br>
digitized video data 610 and encodes the data of these sources to produce the encoded channel data<br>
438. This may be done in a packetized manner wherein packets 648, 650 and 652 are generated to<br>
include a header section 654, 658 and 662 and a payload section 656, 660 and 664, respectively.<br>
The encoding module 380 encodes a portion of frame 616 into the payload 656 of packet<br>
648. Similarly, the encoding module 380 encodes a portion of the digitized video data 648 into the<br>
payload 660 of packet 650. The encoding module 380 also encodes a portion of frame 632 of<br>
MPEG frame 612 into payload 664 of packet 652. The header sections 654, 658 and 662 include<br>
header information as previously described with reference to Figure 17 to enable the client modules<br>
to accurately retrieve the corresponding data.<br>
While Figure 19 is illustrated with respect to transmitting the encoded channel data 348 as<br>
packets 648, 650 and 652 utilizing a CSMA type physical layer transmission, the packets 648, 650<br>
and 652 may be frames of data that are transmitted utilizing TDMA and/or FDMA physical layer<br>
data conveyance techniques. As such, the encoded channel data 438 may include a plurality of<br>
packets where each packet includes a portion of one of the video data from one of the plurality of<br>
multimedia sources and/or frames of data from one of the plurality of multimedia sources.<br>
Figure 20 illustrates a schematic block diagram of the multimedia communication system<br>
of Figures 1-5 wherein the communication path 192 is a wire line connection 670. As shown, the<br>
tuning module 150, 240, 280 and/or 340 of the multimedia server receives audio/video source<br>
inputs 674. The audio/video source input 674 may be from one or any of the multimedia sources<br>
described in any of the preceding drawings. The tuning module selects the particular channels<br>
from the audio/video sources based on select commands received from control module 156, 244,<br>
284and/or344.<br>
The control module generates the select commands based on select request received via the<br>
transceiving module 154, 208, 246, 286 and/or 346. The channel mixer 152, 242, 282 and/or 340<br>
receives the output of the tuning module and generates therefrom data for one or more of the client<br>
modules.<br>
The multimedia server also includes processing module 204 and/or 345 to process<br>
communication via telecom sources 676. The telecom sources include Internet connection, PSTN<br>
connection and/or client-to-client communications.<br>
The transceiving module 154, 208, 246, 286 and/or 346 includes a router 672. The router<br>
provides the connectivity to each of the client modules 14-22, 46-54, 90-98, 112-120 and/or 134-<br>
142. The construct and functionality of a router, such as router 672, is known, thus no further<br>
discussion will be presented except to further illustrate the concepts of the present invention.<br>
With the communication path 192 being a wire line connection, the stream of channel data<br>
and the select request are transceived utilizing a type of transceiving. The type of transceiving may<br>
be time division multiplexing, frequency division multiplexing, pulse code modulation, amplitude<br>
shift keying, phase shift keying, quadrature phase shift keying, quadrature amplitude modulation,<br>
carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), CSMA with collision avoidance and/or CSMA with<br>
collision detection. Accordingly, such a wire line connection 670 transmits and receives data over<br>
the same twisted pair, coaxial cable, in-home network; telephone lines, et cetera.<br>
Alternatively, the wire line connection 670 may include a transmit wire line connection<br>
and a receive wire line connection. The stream of channel data is transmitted via the transmit wire<br>
line connection using a type of transmission. The type of transmission includes time division<br>
multiplexing (TDM), frequency division multiplexing (FDM), pulse code modulation (PCM),<br>
amplitude shift keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK),<br>
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), CSMA with<br>
collision avoidance (CA), and/or CSMA with collision detection (CD). The received wire line<br>
communication path may be utilized to receive the channel selects from the client modules. The<br>
receive wire line connection uses a type of reception that may be TDM, FDM, PCM, ASK, PSK,<br>
QPSK, QUM, CSMA, CSMA with CA and CSMA with CD.<br>
Alternatively, if the multimedia communication system is supporting Internet connections,<br>
the transmit wire line connection and receive wire line connections are conveying data related to<br>
the telecom sources 676. Such data includes packets destined for the Internet, received packets<br>
from the Internet, telecommunication'data destined for the PSTN, data received from the PSTN,<br>
and/or client-to-client communication data.<br>
As shown, the router 672 is operably coupled -to the channel mixer, the tuning module and<br>
to the control module. The router is also operably coupled to at least one of the client modules.<br>
With such a configuration, the control module causes the stream of channel data from the channel<br>
mixer to be formatted based on the type of transceiving to produce formatted channel data. The<br>
router provides the formatted channel data to the client modules via the wire line connection. The<br>
particular type of formatting used by the channel mixer is based on the type of transceiving, which<br>
was previously described. In addition, the selection request received by the client modules will be<br>
formatted in accordance with the type of transceiving such that when the router receives it, the<br>
router appropriately de-formats the data to recapture the particular selection request. The same<br>
applies whether the wire line connection 670 is a single path that transceives data or includes a<br>
receive and a transmit path.<br>
Figure 21 illustrates a schematic block diagram of the components of a multimedia server<br>
being operably coupled to client modules via a communication path that is a radio frequency (RF)<br>
communication path 680. To facilitate the communications via the RF communications via the RF<br>
communication path 680, the transceiving module 154, 208, 246, 286 and/or 346 of the multimedia<br>
server includes an RF transceiving switch 678. Similarly, each of the client modules would include<br>
an RF transceiving switch, an RF receiver, and/or and RF transmitter. The particular radio<br>
frequencies use would be dictated by governmental agencies, such as the Federal Communications<br>
Commission (FCC)- Typically, such in-home frequencies range from the hundreds of megahertz to<br>
single digit gigahertz frequency ranges. One particular type of RF in-home application may be<br>
dictated by ITC specification 802.11a. The 802.11a specification provides the operating<br>
parameters for using radio frequencies for transceiving data within homes and/or over short<br>
distances.<br>
The RF communication path 680 may utilize a single frequency to transceive data between<br>
the multimedia server and the clients, may include a separate frequency for transmitting data and a<br>
separate frequency for receiving data, may include a plurality of frequencies for transceiving data,<br>
may include a plurality of frequencies for receiving data and a separate plurality of frequencies for<br>
transmitting data.<br>
As shown, the RF transceiving switch 678 is operably coupled to the processing module<br>
204 and/or 345, the control module 156, 244, 284 and/or 344, the tuning module 150, 240, 280<br>
and/or 340, and the channel mixer 152, 242, 282 and/or 342. As configured, the control module<br>
causes the stream of channel data, which is conveyed via the RF communication path 680 to the<br>
client modules, to be formatted based on the type of transceiving used. The type of transceiving<br>
may be time division multiplexing (TDM), frequency division multiplexing (FDM), pulse code<br>
modulation (PCM), amplitude shift keying (ASK), phase shift keying (PSK), quadrature phase shift<br>
keying (QPSK), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), carrier sense multiple access (CSMA),<br>
CSMA with collision avoidance (CA) and CSMA with collision detection (CD).<br>
The RF transceiving switch provides the formatted channel data to the clients during<br>
transmitting intervals via the radio frequency path 680. The transmission and receiving intervals<br>
will be described in greater detail with reference to Figure 26.<br>
The client module receives the formatted data via the RF path then processes it as<br>
previously discussed and will be subsequently discussed in greater detail with reference to Figures<br>
50 - 56. In addition, the client module formats the selection request based on the type of<br>
transceiving and then provides the formatted selection request to the transceiving module via the<br>
RF communication path 680. The RF transceiving switch 678 receives the selection request and<br>
provides them to the control module. The control module processes the selection request as<br>
previously described and will be subsequently described in greater detail with reference to Figures<br>
24 - 28.<br>
Figure 22 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a multimedia communication system<br>
that has the components of a multimedia server operably coupled via an infrared communication<br>
path 684 to a plurality of client modules. In this embodiment, the transceiving module 154, 208,<br>
246, 286 and/or 346 includes an infrared transceiving switch 682. Similarly, each of the client<br>
modules would include a similar IR transceiving switch. In this embodiment, data is transmitted<br>
between the multimedia server and client modules via a single IR communication path 684. As<br>
such, the IR communication path is divided into transmit portions (i.e., from the multimedia server)<br>
to the client modules, and receive portions (i.e., from the client to the server). Alternatively, the IR<br>
path may include a transmit IR path and a receive IR path.<br>
As shown, the IR transceiving switch 682 is operably coupled to the processing module,<br>
the control module, the tuning module and the channel mixer. As configured, the control module<br>
causes the stream of channel data, which is transmitted via the IR communication path 684 from<br>
the transceiving module to the client module, to be formatted based on the type of transceiving. As<br>
previously mentioned, the type of transceiving includes TDM, FDM, PCM, ASK, PSK, QPSK,<br>
QAM, CSMA, CSMA with CA, and CSMA with CD. The particular data contained in the stream<br>
of channel data is based on selection request received from the client module.<br>
The client module formats the selection request in accordance with the type of transceiving<br>
and conveys the formatted selection requests during reception intervals via the IR communication<br>
path 684 or transmits them via a separate receive DR. path. The transceiving module, upon<br>
receiving the selection request, provides the selection request- to the control module, which<br>
provides commands to the tuning module, which selects the appropriate channels from the AV<br>
sources 674 based on the commands.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the communication path 192 between the<br>
multimedia server and the plurality of clients may include one or more of the wire line<br>
communication path 670 of Figure 20, the RF communication path 680 of Figure 21 and the IR<br>
communication path 684 of Figure 22. For example, the transceiving path between each of the<br>
client modules may utilize the RF communication path while the receiving path may be an IR path.<br>
As a further example, the client modules within the same physical location as the server may be<br>
operably coupled via a wire line communication path while other client modules in different<br>
locations within a home utilize an RF communication path. Thus, a variety of communication path<br>
combinations may be utilized within the same multimedia communication system to provide the<br>
multimedia communication services.<br>
Figure 23 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a multimedia server 700 that includes<br>
the tuning module 150, 240, 280 and/or 340, the channel mixer 152, 242, 282 and/or 340, the<br>
control module 156, 240, 284 and/or 344, the transceiving module 154, 208, 246, 286 and/or 346,<br>
the processing module 204 and/or 345, and a second transceiving module 690. The transceiving<br>
module 154, 208, 246, 286 and/or 346 includes an analog multiplexor 686. In addition to<br>
performing the functions as previously described with reference to the transceiving module, the<br>
analog multiplexor 686 converts the stream of channel data into analog signals 688 representing the<br>
stream of channel data. Accordingly, the analog multiplexor 686 may be utilized to interface with<br>
client modules coupled to legacy-type analog client devices.<br>
The second transceiving module 690 enables the multimedia server to communicate with at<br>
least some of the client modules via a second communication path 692. The second<br>
communication path 692 may be a wire line connection, RF connection and/or infrared connection.<br>
The data transmitted over the second communication path may be identical to the stream of channel<br>
data transmitted by transceiving module 154, 208, 246, 286 and/or 346, or separate data. As such,<br>
the multimedia server 700 may service multiple sets of client modules from the same grouping of<br>
audio and/or video sources 674.<br>
The control module 156, 244, 284 and/or 344 includes processing means for determining<br>
client access privileges for each of the plurality of clients. Such access privileges include parental<br>
control features, time of access, quantity of access, et cetera. As such, the control module<br>
determines for each client selection request whether the request is valid before providing a<br>
selection command to the tuning module. Such a feature gives the operator of the multimedia<br>
communication system control over which A/V resources 674 each client module may access, the<br>
amount of access per day, and/or the time of access.<br>
Figure 24 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for providing multimedia services to a<br>
local area network. The method may be performed by any one of the multimedia servers illustrated<br>
and described in the previous figures. Accordingly, the operational steps illustrated in Figure 24<br>
may be performed by multimedia server 12,42, 88,102, 132 and/or 700.<br>
The processing begins when a plurality of channels are received from at least one<br>
multimedia source. The multimedia source may be a satellite connection, cable connection, NTSC<br>
antenna connection, PAL antenna connection, HDTV connection, SDTV connection, radio<br>
connection, et cetera. In addition, the plurality of channels may be from a plurality of single<br>
channel sources including a DVD player, VCR, closed circuit television, laser disk player,<br>
camcorder, digital audio storage device (e.g., MP3 player), DVD audio player, CD player, et<br>
cetera. The plurality of channels are continuously received but not processed until one or more<br>
client modules select one or more channels.<br>
The process proceeds to Step 712 where a select request is received from at least one client<br>
module via a communication path. The communication path as previously discussed in Figures 20-<br>
22 may be a radio frequency communication path, IR communication path, and/or wire line<br>
communication path. The selection request may be from one client module or a plurality of client<br>
modules, each client may be requesting access to a different channel, the same channel or any<br>
combination thereof. The selection request includes the identity of the particular client module and<br>
the identity of the particular channel and/or source for the channel. As such, the selection request<br>
includes sufficient information for the multimedia server to determine the particular audio and/or<br>
video source of the particular channel and the desired channel. For example, the selection request<br>
may indicate that channel 5 of a satellite broadcast is to be the channel of interest for a particular<br>
client module.<br>
The processing then proceeds to Step 714 where a control module within the multimedia<br>
server generates a set of channel select commands from the select request. Accordingly, for each<br>
select request received from the client modules, the control module, assuming the select request is<br>
valid, generates a corresponding select command. Thus, if only one client module has provided a<br>
select request, only one select command is generated. As one of average skill in the art will<br>
appreciate, the select command is not repeatedly generated from a select request, the select<br>
command is typically generated once and maintained until an alternate select request is received or<br>
a termination request is received.<br>
The processing of generating a set of channel select commands may further be described<br>
with reference to Steps 722-724. At Step 722, the select requests are de-formatted. As previously<br>
mentioned, the select requests are received via a communication path, which utilizes a particular<br>
data conveyance protocol. The data may be encoded utilizing one of a variety of encoding schemes<br>
such as Manchester encoding, non-return to zero encoding, multi-level encoding, block encoding,<br>
NB/MB encoding, et cetera. la addition, the encoded data is then modulated utilizing the particular<br>
modulation scheme which may be TDM, FDM, ASK, PSK, et cetera. Accordingly, to recapture<br>
the original selection requests, the data must be demodulated and decoded.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 724 where the select request is interpreted to produce<br>
the channel select command. The interpretation of the select request includes an authentication<br>
process, a verification of the particular client module, and a determination of the validity of the<br>
client module. If the client module is an authentic client module and the service being requested is<br>
within the privileges of the particular client module, the control module will generate the<br>
corresponding channel command.<br>
Returning to the main flow of Figure 24, the process continues at Step 716 where a tuning<br>
module selects a set of channels from the plurality of channels based on the set of channel select<br>
commands. For example, if only one channel select command exists, the tuning module will select<br>
a channel corresponding to this particular channel select command. If two channel select<br>
commands are being provided to the tuning module, the tuning module selects two channels, one<br>
for each selection command.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 718 where the set of channels are mixed into a stream of<br>
channel data. The channel data is mixed in such a way as to identify the particular source of the<br>
channel data, the destination of the channel data, the select request, and/or any other identifying<br>
information needed to ensure that the appropriate client module receives the appropriate data. As<br>
one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the stream of channel data may be stored on a hard<br>
drive within the multimedia server for subsequent retrieval and/or use. As such, the multimedia<br>
server, via a hard drive and appropriate software, may perform a digital VCR function or like<br>
function.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 720 where the stream of channel data is transmitted via a<br>
communication path to the plurality of client modules. As previously mentioned, the<br>
communication path may be a wire line communication path, RF communication path and/or<br>
infrared communication path. The transmitting of the stream of channel data may be further<br>
defined with reference to Step 726.<br>
At Step 726, the stream of channel data is formatted for transmission via a transceiving<br>
module of the multimedia server. The formatting of the data includes encoding the data utilizing a<br>
particular encoding scheme such as multi-level encoding, non-return to zero encoding, Manchester<br>
encoding, block encoding, an nB/mB encoding where n 
may be 4B/5B where 4 bits of original data is converted into 5 bits of encoded data. In addition,<br>
depending on the particular data conveyance protocol used within the communication system, the<br>
encoded data is then modulated utilizing one or more modulation schemes including TDM, FDM,<br>
ASK, PSK, PCM, QPSK, QAM, et cetera. The formatting of the stream of data may additionally<br>
include converting the stream of channel data into analog signals for conveyance in an analog<br>
format to one or more of the client modules. The conversion to analog signals may be done in<br>
parallel with the conveyance of the formatted stream of channel data. As such, both digital and<br>
analog signals representing the stream of channel data may be transmitted to the client modules.<br>
Accordingly, the analog signals may be transmitted over a different communication path than the<br>
digital signals. In addition, multiple communication paths may be utilized depending on the<br>
coupling between the client modules and the multimedia servers as previously discussed with<br>
reference to Figures 20-22.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, a single stream of data is provided from<br>
the multimedia server to the plurality of client modules. The stream of channel data includes the<br>
data corresponding to each selection made by the client modules. Thus, each client module<br>
receives the entire stream of channel data and extracts only the data relevant to service its particular<br>
selection request<br>
Figure 25 illustrates a logic diagram of a method that further describes Step 720 of Figure<br>
24 when the communication path is a wire line connection. The process begins at Step 730 where a<br>
determination is made regarding the transmitting intervals and the receiving intervals. The<br>
determination is made by the control module within the multimedia server and is based on the<br>
traffic loading, pre-defined allocation intervals, et cetera. In addition, the transmitting intervals and<br>
receiving intervals are dependent upon whether a single communication path is utilized to receive<br>
and transmit data or whether separate transmit and receive paths are available.<br>
The process then proceeds to Steps 732 and 736. At Step 732 the stream of channel data is<br>
formatted based on the type of transceiving. The type of transceiving corresponds to the<br>
modulation scheme utilized, which may be TDM, FDM, ASK, PCM, PSK, et cetera. The<br>
processing then proceeds to Step 734 where the formatted channel data is provided to at least one<br>
of the plurality of clients during a transmitting interval or multiple transmitting intervals, via the<br>
wire line connection.<br>
At Step 732, the multimedia server receives formatted select request during receive<br>
intervals via the wire line connection. The select requests are formatted based on the type of<br>
transceiving used within the multimedia communication system. The type of transceiving<br>
corresponds to the modulation scheme utilized, which may be TDM, FDM, ASK, et cetera.<br>
Figure 26 illustrates a graphical representation of the transmitting intervals and receiving<br>
intervals via the communication path. As shown, communication path 746 operably couples<br>
multimedia server 738 to a plurality of client modules 740-742. Note that multimedia server 738<br>
may be any one of the multimedia servers described in reference to Figures 1-11 and Figure 23.<br>
The client module 740-744 may be any one of the client modules discussed in reference to Figures<br>
1-11. The communication path 746 may be a wire line connection, radio frequency connection,<br>
and/or infrared communication path.<br>
As shown, data conveyed over the communication path 746 may be done in packets and/or<br>
frames. The transmission of packets and'or frames is divided into transmit intervals 748, 752 and<br>
756 and receive intervals 750 and 754. During the transmit intervals 748, 752 and 756, the<br>
multimedia server is transmitting the stream of channel data to the plurality of client modules 740-<br>
744. During the receive intervals 750 and 754, one or more of the client modules 740-744 is<br>
transmitting a selection request to the multimedia server.<br>
The client module 740-744 access the receive intervals 750 and 754 based on any one of a<br>
plurality of schemes such as CSMA, token ring passing, polling by the multimedia server 738,<br>
TDM' access, et cetera. Accordingly, the ratio between the transmit intervals 748 and received<br>
intervals 750 may be set or may be allocated as needed. For example, the receive interval 750 and<br>
754 may occur once for every 10-20 transmit intervals 748, 752, 756. Alternatively, the transmit<br>
intervals and receive intervals may be allocated strictly based on a CSMA concept where the<br>
multimedia server 738 and each of the client modules 740-744 monitor the communication path for<br>
transmissions. If the path is available, the particular entity transmits its data utilizing CSMA with<br>
collision avoidance and/or CSMA with collision detection. As one of average skill in the art will<br>
appreciate, there are numerous ways in which data can be conveyed via the communication path<br>
746 between multimedia server 738 and the plurality of client modules 740-744 to ensure that the<br>
stream of channel data is received by the client modules 740-744 and the client modules 740-744<br>
have adequate access to the communication path 746 to provide selection commands and/or<br>
changes to such selections. As a further example, the multimedia server 738 may broadcast within<br>
the stream of channel data, when the communication path 746 will be available for transmitting<br>
selection request by the client modules. In addition, the broadcasting by the multimedia server 738<br>
may include the identity of which client module or client modules may access the communication<br>
path at the allocated received time.<br>
Figure 27 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for further processing of Step 720 of<br>
Figure 24 when the communication path is a radio frequency communication path. The processing<br>
begins at Step 760 where the multimedia server determines the transmitting intervals and receiving<br>
intervals. This was described with reference to Figure 26. The process then proceeds to Steps 762<br>
or 766. At Step 762, the stream of channel data is formatted based on the type of transceiving. The<br>
process then proceeds to Step 764 where the formatted channel data is provided to at least one of<br>
the clients during a transmitting interval via the radio frequency communication path.<br>
At Step 766, the multimedia server receives formatted select request during receive<br>
intervals on the RF communication path. The select requests are formatted based on the type of<br>
transceiving.<br>
Figure 28 illustrates a logic diagram of a method that further describes Step 720 of Figure<br>
24 when the communication path is an infrared communication path. The processing begins at<br>
Step 770 where the transmitting intervals and receiving intervals are determined. The process then<br>
proceeds to Steps 772 and 776. At Step 772, the stream of channel data is formatted based on the<br>
type of transceiving. The process then proceeds to Step 774 where the formatted channel data is<br>
provided to at least one client module during transmitting intervals via the infrared communication<br>
path.<br>
At Step 776, the multimedia server receives formatted select request during receive<br>
intervals on the infrared communication path. The select requests are formatted based ori the type<br>
of transceiving utilized.<br>
Figure 29 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a tuning module 825 that may be<br>
utilized as the tuning module 150, 240, 280, and/or 340 as shown in Figures 12, 14-16. The tuning<br>
module 825 includes a plurality of selectors 780-786, an encoding module 804, and a bus interface<br>
806 that provides connectivity to a shared bus 824. The shared bus 824 is shared with the channel<br>
mixer processing module and other components of the multimedia servers as shown in Figures 12,<br>
14-16. The selectors 780-786 may be the plurality of tuners shown in Figure 12, the multiplexors<br>
shown in Figure 14, the combination of multiplexors and tuners shown in Figure 15 and/or the<br>
HDTV tuners shown in Figure 16. Accordingly, the selectors 780-786 are dependent on the<br>
particular source providing the plurality of channel 787.<br>
The encoding module 804 includes a plurality of buffers 808-814, an encoder 816, a buffer<br>
controller 818, and a packetizing module 820. The buffers 808-814 may be physically separate<br>
memory devices or logically separate memory devices. Each of the buffers 808-814 function as a<br>
ring buffer. The buffer controller 818 provides the management of each buffer 808-814 including<br>
head and tail pointer tracking, and read and write control.<br>
As shown, each of the plurality of selectors 780-786 is operably coupled to receive a<br>
plurality of channels 787. Based on a respective channel select command 796-802, each of the<br>
selectors 780-786 outputs an individual selected channel 788-794. The plurality of channels 787<br>
may be provided by the multimedia sources previously described with reference to Figures 1-11.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, more or less selectors 780-786 may be included in<br>
tuning module 825. In addition, one or more of the selectors 780-786 may be idle if a limited<br>
number of client modules are accessing the multimedia server. Accordingly, the encoding module<br>
804 via the buffer controller 818 is aware of which selectors 780-786 is actively providing selected<br>
channel data 788-794.<br>
The buffer controller 818 coordinates the writing of the data of the selected channel 788-<br>
794 into the respective buffers 808-814. In addition, the buffer controller 818 coordinates the<br>
reading of the data from each of the buffers 808-814 into the encoder 816. The encoder 816 may<br>
perform a particular encoding function such as multi-level encoding, non-return to zero encoding,<br>
Manchester encoding, block encoding, NB/MB encoding where N &gt; M. Typically, the encoder<br>
816 is utilized to facilitate the accuracy of data transmission from the tuning module 825 to the<br>
channel mixer of the multimedia server. As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the<br>
encoder 816 may be omitted when the data of the selected channels may be accurately transmitted<br>
to the channel mixer.<br>
The packetizing module 820 packetizes the encoded data to produce a plurality of packets.<br>
Each packet includes a header section and data section. The header section includes the identity of<br>
the selected channel, the type of data of the selected channel (e.g., audio, video, text, et cetera),<br>
identity of the particular multimedia source, whether the encryption is enabled or disabled, the type<br>
of encryption used, whether compression is enabled or disabled, the type of compression used,<br>
and/or a packet sequence number. The packets are provided to bus interface 806, which may<br>
include a receiving module 826. The bus interface provides the packets of encoded set of channels<br>
822 to the shared bus 824.<br>
In addition, the bus interface 806 via the receiving module 826 receives packet 828. The<br>
receiving module 826 processes the packets to retrieve the channel select commands 830. The<br>
channel select command 830 is comprised of the individual channel select commands 796-802.<br>
The receiving module may include a decoder to decode the data contained within the packets to<br>
recapture at least a portion of a channel select command. The decoding performed would be the<br>
inverse of the encoding used by the client module.<br>
Figure 30 illustrates a schematic block diagram of tuning module 840 which may be used<br>
in any one of the multimedia servers illustrated in Figures 12, 14-16. The tuning module 840 is<br>
very similar to tuning module 825 of Figure 29 with the difference that the encoding module 804<br>
includes a framing module 842 instead of a packetizing module 820. In addition, the bus interface<br>
806 includes a monitoring module 844 as opposed to a receiving module 826.<br>
In operation, the selectors 780-786 select a particular channel 788-794 based on a channel<br>
select command 796-802 from a plurality of channels 787. Buffers 808-814 store the data of the<br>
selected channel 788-794. The encoder 816 encodes the data to produce encoded channel data.<br>
The encoded channel data is received by framing module 842, which frames the data of each of the<br>
selected channels into frames that include a header section and data section. The header section<br>
includes the identity of the selected channel, the type of selected channel, the identity of the<br>
multimedia source, indication as to whether encryption is enabled or disabled, the type of<br>
encryption used, an indication as to whether compression is enabled or disabled, the type of<br>
compression, and/or a frame number.<br>
The bus interface 806 receives the framed data and provides it as encoded set of channels<br>
802 on to the shared bus 824. In addition, the bus interface 806 receives frames 846 from the<br>
shared bus. The monitoring module 844 interprets the frames 846 at specific time intervals to<br>
extract channel select commands 848.<br>
Figure 31 illustrates a schematic block diagram of another embodiment of the tuning<br>
module 850. The tuning module 850 may be utilized in any one of the multimedia servers<br>
illustrated in Figures 12, 14-16. The tuning module 850 includes a plurality of selectors 780-786, a<br>
data compression module 862, an encryption module 860, the encoding module 804, the bus<br>
interface 806, the bus controller 870, a decoding module 852, a decrypting module 864, and a<br>
decompressing module 868. The bus interface 806 is controlled via the bus controller 870, which<br>
controls the receiving of the channel select commands and further controls the transmitting of<br>
encoded channel data.<br>
In operation, the tuning module 850 receives select commands from the shared bus 824 via<br>
the bus interface 806. The bus interface 806 provides the received channel select commands to the<br>
decoding module 852. The decoding module 852 includes a deframer or depacketizer module 854,<br>
a decoder 856, and a buffer 858. The deframer or depacketizer 854 extracts data from a received<br>
frame or from a received packet. The deframed or depacketized data is provided to the decoder<br>
856. The decoder recaptures the original data of the selection request by utilizing. the inverse<br>
 function of the encoder within the client module. As such, if the client module used Manchester<br>
encoding, the decoder would use the inverse Manchester encoding function to recapture the data.<br>
The recaptured data is then stored in buffer 858.<br>
If the data is unencrypted and is not compressed, the recaptured data is provided to control<br>
module 156, 244, 284, and/or 344. Based on the channel select request, the control module<br>
generates a plurality of channel select commands 796-802. The control module provides the<br>
channel select commands to the plurality of selectors 780-786.<br>
If, however, the selection request is encrypted and/or compressed, the encrypted data<br>
would be provided to decryption module 864. Decryption module 864 decrypts the data based on<br>
the encryption/decryption scheme utilized. For example, if the client module utilized a data<br>
encryption standard (DES) encryption technique, the decryption module would use the<br>
corresponding decryption scheme to recapture the data.<br>
If the data is also compressed, the decrypted data or the data from buffer 858 is provided to<br>
the decompressing module 868. The decompressing module 868 utilizes the inverse function that<br>
was used to compress the data. As such, the recaptured data, which has either been decrypted<br>
and/or decompressed, is provided to the control module, which produces the corresponding channel<br>
select commands 796-802.<br>
The selectors 786-780 output a selected channel 788-794 based on the respective channel<br>
select commands 796-802 from a plurality of channels 787. The plurality of selected channels 788-<br>
794 may be provided to a data compression module 862, an encryption module 860, and/or directly<br>
to the encoding module 804.<br>
If the selected channels 788-794 are to be compressed, the data compression module 862<br>
utilizes a data compression scheme to compress the data. The data compression scheme may be a<br>
zip-type function or other known data compression techniques. If the compressed data is to also be<br>
encrypted, it is provided to encrypting module 860. Alternatively, if the compressed data is to be<br>
processed without encryption, it would be provided directly to encoding module 804.<br>
If the data is to be encrypted, encrypting module 860 utilizes an encryption scheme to<br>
encrypt the data of the selected channels 788-794. The encryption scheme utilized may be any one<br>
of a variety of known encryption schemes such as DES, PGP (pretty good protection), et cetera.<br>
The encrypted data 860 is then provided" to encoding module 804, which subsequently encodes the<br>
data and provides the encoded data to bus interface 806 for transmission on the shared bus 824. As<br>
previously mentioned, the encoder of the encoding module 804 may be omitted such that the<br>
encrypted data may be transmitted directly onto the shared bus without further encoding.<br>
Figure 32 illustrates a schematic block diagram of an alternate tuning module 880 that may<br>
be utilized in any one of the multimedia servers illustrated in Figures 12, 14-16. The tuning<br>
module 880 includes a processing module 882 and memory 884. The processing module 882 may<br>
be a single processing device or a plurality of processing devices. Such a processing device may<br>
be a microprocessor, microcontroller, microcomputer, digital signal processor, programmable gate<br>
array, central processing unit, state machine, logic circuitry, and/or any device that manipulates<br>
signals (analog and/or digital) based on operational instructions. The memory 84 may be a single<br>
memory device or a plurality of memory devices. Such a memory device may be a read-only<br>
memory device, random access memory device, flash memory, magnetic tape memory, system<br>
memory, erasable read-only memory, and/or any device that stores digital information. Note, that<br>
when the processing module 882 implements one or more of its functions via a state machine or<br>
logic circuitry, the memory storing the corresponding operational instructions is embedded within<br>
the circuitry comprised in the state machine or logic circuit. The operational instructions stored in<br>
memory 884 and executed by processing module 882 have generally been discussed with reference<br>
to the preceding figures and is further illustrated with reference to Figures 33-37.<br>
Figure 33 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for multiplexing a plurality of channels in<br>
a multimedia system via a tuning module. The processing begins at Step 890 where a plurality of<br>
channels is received from a multimedia source. The receiving of the plurality of channels may<br>
further include one or more of: receiving audio and video data for each of a plurality of channels<br>
from a satellite connection; receiving audio and video data for each of a plurality of channels from<br>
a set-top box; receiving audio and video data for each of a plurality of channels from a cable<br>
connection; receiving audio and video data for each of the plurality of channels from a high<br>
definition television receiver; receiving audio and video data for each of the plurality of channels<br>
from an antenna connection which receives NTSC broadcasts, PAL broadcasts, et cetera.<br>
Accordingly, the plurality of channels may be from a single multimedia source or a plurality of<br>
multimedia sources.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 892 where a plurality of channel selection commands<br>
are received. The plurality of channel selection commands are derived from select requests<br>
provided by a plurality of client modules wherein each of the channel select commands identifies a<br>
particular channel of the plurality of channels. The processing then continues at Step 894 where a<br>
channel of the plurality of channels is selected per channel selection command. Note that the<br>
selected channel may be from any one of a plurality of multimedia sources.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 896 where each of the selected channels is encoded<br>
based on a data conveyance protocol of the multimedia system. The encoding may be multi-level<br>
encoding, non-return to zero encoding, Manchester encoding, block encoding, and/or nB/mB<br>
encoding where n 
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, high definition television, satellite<br>
receivers, set-top boxes, et cetera typically utilize MPEG video data. As such, in the typical 6 MHz<br>
bandwidth for NTSC channel separation, compressed video includes multiple channels in the same<br>
frequency band. Thus, when a particular channel is selected from one of these multimedia sources,<br>
multiple compressed channels may be retrieved. Accordingly, each of the compressed channels<br>
may be encoded as described in Step 896. As one of average skill in the art will further appreciate,<br>
prior to the encoding of Step 896, the data may be compressed via a compression technique and/or<br>
encrypted utilizing an encryption technique.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 898 where the encoded channel data is conveyed to the<br>
channel mixer. The conveying of the encoded data may be done by framing the data from each of<br>
the selected channels into frames that include a header section and a data section. Alternatively,<br>
the encoded channel data may be packetized into packets that include a header section and a data<br>
section. The header section of either a packet or frame includes the identity of the selected<br>
channel, type of data of the selected channel, the identity of the multimedia source, whether<br>
encryption is enabled or disabled, the type of encryption used, an indication as to whether<br>
compression is enabled or disabled, the type of compression, and/or a packet or frame number.<br>
Figure 34 illustrates a logic diagram of a method that further defines the receiving of the<br>
channel select commands as described generally in Step 892 of Figure 33. The processing begins<br>
at Step 900 where the channel select requests are received from a plurality of client modules. The<br>
process then proceeds to Step 902 where the channel select requests are processed to produce the<br>
plurality of channel select commands. Each of the channel select commands include a specific<br>
channel select command, less channel selection command, next channel selection command,<br>
 previous channel selection command, favorite channel selection command, and/or select channel<br>
from a user defined list Such a command corresponds to the particular request by the client and/or<br>
a default processing scheme used within the multimedia server. Accordingly, when a particular<br>
client makes a request, the tuning module will interpret the request in light of one of these<br>
particular multimedia channel selection schemes.<br>
The processing of the plurality of selection requests may be done in one or more of Steps<br>
904-908. At Step 904, the channel select request is interpreted to identify at least one of the clients.<br>
In addition, the request is interpreted to determine the particular channel selection request being<br>
made. Based on this information, the channel command may be generated.<br>
At Step 906, the client initiating the selection request is authenticated. The authentication<br>
determines whether the client is a valid client of the multimedia server. At Step 908, the specific<br>
channel selection request made by a client is authenticated. This may be done by determining<br>
whether the client has access privileges for the particular channel being requested, whether the<br>
request is being made within an approved time of the day, and/or whether a time allotment of<br>
accessing multimedia sources has been exceeded. In addition, the authentication of the specific<br>
channel request may include determining whether the client is authorized to purchase the requested<br>
channel from one of the multimedia sources (e.g., whether the client is authorized to access pay<br>
preview channels), and/or whether the client has exceeded in the count limit established by the<br>
multimedia server.<br>
Figure 35 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for receiving the channel selection<br>
commands of Step 892 of Figure 33. The process may begin at Step 910, 916 and/or at Step 922.<br>
At Step 910, the tuning module monitors packets on a shared bus. The packets, as previously<br>
described, include a header section and data section. The process then proceeds to Step 912 where<br>
the tuning module identifies at least one of the packets as containing at least a portion of one of the<br>
plurality of channel selection commands.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 914 where the tuning module decodes the at least one<br>
packet based on the data convention protocol of the multimedia system to recapture at least a<br>
portion of one of the plurality of channel select commands. Such decoding includes interpreting<br>
the header section, extracting the data from the data section, and determining whether the extracted<br>
data contains all of the data of a channel select command or partial data of a channel select<br>
command. If the data extracted is a partial select request, it is buffered until all of the data related<br>
to the channel select command is received.<br>
. At Step 916, the tuning module monitors a shared bus at specific time intervals for frames<br>
of relevant data. The process then proceeds to Step 918 where the tuning module identifies a data<br>
frame at one or the specific time intervals to contain at least a portion of one of the plurality of<br>
channel select commands. The process then proceeds to Step 920 where the tuning module<br>
decodes the data frame based on the data convention protocol to recapture at least a portion of one<br>
of the channel select commands. The decoding includes interpreting the header section, extracting<br>
the data from the data section, and determining whether the data contains a full channel selection<br>
command or a partial one. If partial, the data is buffered until a full channel select command has<br>
been received.<br>
At Step 922, the tuning module decrypts each of the plurality of channel select commands.<br>
In addition, at Step 924, the tuning module decompresses each of the channel select commands.<br>
Figure 36 illustrates a logic diagram of an alternate method for multiplexing a plurality of<br>
channels in a multimedia system by a tuning module. The processing begins at Step 930 where a<br>
channel from a plurality of multimedia sources is received to produce a plurality of channels. The<br>
multimedia sources may be a DVD player, CD player, camcorder, VCR, DVD audio player, et<br>
cetera. The process then proceeds to Step 932 where the tuning module receives a plurality of<br>
channel select commands. The process then proceeds to Step 934 where the timing module selects<br>
a channel from the plurality of channels for each of the channel select commands received.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 936 where the tuning module encodes each of the<br>
selected channels based on a data convention protocol of the multimedia system. The encoding<br>
includes multi-level encoding, non-return to zero encoding, Manchester encoding, block encoding,<br>
and/or nB/mB encoding where n 
channel may be compressed and/or encrypted. The process then proceeds to Step 938 where the<br>
encoded channel data is conveyed to the channel mixer. The data may be conveyed as packets<br>
utilizing CSMA, CSMA with collision avoidance and/or CSMA with collision detection.<br>
Alternatively, the data may be conveyed as frames, which will be transmitted in specific time slots<br>
for time division multiplexing and/or frequency positions for frequency division multiplexing.<br>
Figure 37 illustrates a logic diagram of further processing of Step 932 of Figure 36. At<br>
Step 940, the tuning module receives the channel select request from a plurality of client modules.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 942 where the tuning module, and/or control module, processes<br>
the plurality of channel selection requests to produce the plurality of channel selection commands.<br>
The processing of the channel select request may be done as described in Steps 944, 946, and/or<br>
948.<br>
At Step 944, the control module interprets a channel select request to identify the particular<br>
client and the particular request being made. If both are valid, the channel selection command is<br>
generated.<br>
At Step 946, the control module authenticates the client that provided the specific channel<br>
selection request. The authentication of the client verifies that the client is an authorized user of<br>
the multimedia system.<br>
At Step 948, the control module authenticates the specific channel selection request. The<br>
authentication of the channel selection request includes determining parental control limits,<br>
subscription verification, account limits, time of day of the request, and/or amount of multimedia<br>
service accessing over a given duration.<br>
Figure 38 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a channel mixer 950. The channel mixer<br>
950 may be utilized in any one of the multimedia servers described in Figures 1-15. The channel<br>
mixer 950 includes a stream parsing module 951, memory controller 952, memory 956 and a data<br>
transcoding module 954.<br>
The stream parsing module 951 is operably coupled to receive the encoded channel data<br>
958 from the tuning module. The stream parsing module 951 decodes the encoded channel data<br>
958 to recapture the original data. The stream parsing module 951 then converts the data of each of<br>
the selected channels into generic data 960. The stream parsing module 951 stores the generic data<br>
960 in memory 956 via the memory controller 952.<br>
The stream parsing module 951 conveys control information 964 and data 966 with the<br>
transcoding module 954. The control information includes the channel select request 968. As<br>
such, based on the control information, which includes the channel selection request, the stream<br>
parsing module 951 processes the encoded channel data 958 to produce the generic data 960.<br>
The data transcoding module 954 retrieves the generic data 960 from memory 956 via the<br>
memory controller 952. The data transcoding module 954 converts the generic data 960 into a<br>
stream of data 962. The conversion of the generic data 960 is dependent upon the particular type of<br>
data. For example, video data may be stored as digital RGB data, digital YCRCB data, digitized<br>
video, et cetera. The transcoding module retrieves the generic video data and converts it into a<br>
specific formatted video data, such as MPEG 2, and provides that as the stream of data 962.<br>
If the data is audio data, the audio data is stored as generic PCM audio data in memory<br>
956. The data transcoding module 954 converts the generic PCM digitized audio data into MP3<br>
data, MPEG audio data, et cetera. If the encoded channel data 958 includes network data, the<br>
stream parsing module 951 passes the network data to be stored in memory 956. The data<br>
transcoding module retrieves the network data and passes it as the stream of data 962.<br>
Figure 39 illustrates a channel mixer 980 operably coupled to components of a device<br>
hosting the multimedia server. The channel mixer 980 may be any of the channel mixers used in<br>
the multimedia servers previously described. The host device includes a system bus 976, a host<br>
processor 970, a memory bridge 972 and system memory 974. The host device may be a personal<br>
computer, laptop computer, satellite receiver, set top box, home theater receiver, radio receiver,<br>
VCR, DVD, etc.<br>
The channel mixer 980 includes a plurality of stream parsing modules 951, memory<br>
controller 952, and the data transcoding module 954. The plurality of stream parsing modules 951<br>
is operably coupled to the tuning module 984. The tuning module 984 provides the encoded<br>
channel data 958 to the channel mixer 980. In this embodiment, each of the stream parsing<br>
modules 951 may be processing a particular channel selection request for a particular client<br>
module.<br>
Each of the stream parsing modules 951 provides generic data 960 to memory 956 via the<br>
memory controller 952. The transcoding module 954 converts the generic data 960 into the stream<br>
of data 962 and provides it to the transceiving module 982 via the system bus 976.<br>
The transceiving module 982 includes an encoder and modulator for preparing the stream<br>
of data 962 for transmission to the client modules. In addition, the transcoding module 982<br>
includes a demodulator and decoder for receiving the channel select commands from the plurality<br>
of client modules.<br>
The transceiving module 982 provides the channel select commands to the channel mixer<br>
980 via the system bus interface 977. As coupled, the host processor 970 may perform system<br>
operational functions for the multimedia server via algorithms stored in the system memory 970.<br>
Such system level functions may be allocation of system multimedia resources, managing Internet<br>
access, client-to-client communications, telephone communications, et cetera. As such, system<br>
level functions will be described in greater detail with reference to Figures 57-65.<br>
Figure 40 illustrates a schematic block diagram of another channel mixer 1.000 that may be<br>
utilized in any one of the previously discussed multimedia servers. The channel mixer 1000<br>
includes the stream parsing module 951 and may further include multiple stream parsing modules<br>
951, a digital to analog converter 1006, a decode instruction packet module 998, IDCT module<br>
1027, motion compensation 1023, and the transcoding module 954. The transcoding module 954,<br>
for video signals, includes a MPEG decoding module 1004 and an MPEG encoding module 1002.<br>
For audio signals, the transcoding module 954 would include a PCM decoding module and a PCM<br>
encoding module.<br>
The MPEG encoding module 1002 includes a buffered motion predictor 1018, a discrete<br>
cosigned transform module 1020, a quantizer 1022, zigzag module 1021, a Huffman encoder 1024<br>
and an output bit bucket 1026. The MPEG decoding module 1004 includes a dezigzag and<br>
dequantizer module 1010, an inverse discrete cosign transform module 1012, a macro-block buffer<br>
1014 and a motion compensation and scaling module 1016. The functionality of motion<br>
compensation and scaling module 1016 and the buffered motion predictor 1018 are further<br>
described in co-pending patent applications entitled, ADAPTIVE BANDWIDTH FOOTPRINT<br>
MATCHING FOR MULTIPLE COMPRESSED VIDEO STREAMS IN A FIXED BANDWIDTH<br>
NETWORK and DEVICE AND METHOD FOR COMPRESSION OF A VIDEO STREAM<br>
having a docket number VIXS001 and VTXS002. The remaining elements of the MPEG decoding<br>
module 1004 and MPEG encoding module 1002 are known, thus no further discussion will be<br>
provided except to further illustrate the concepts of the present invention.<br>
Each of the stream parsing modules 951 includes a processor 992, an input bit bucket 996,<br>
memory controller 952, memory 956, a plurality of bit stream modules 990, a direct memory<br>
access interface 1028 and a Huffman decoder 1008. Each of the bit stream modules 990 includes<br>
an interpreter 994. In operation, each of the bit stream modules 990 is operably coupled to process<br>
one channel of interest of the encoded channel data 958. The interpreter 994 is utilized to identify<br>
which of the channels the particular bit stream module is to process. The bit stream module then<br>
filters the channel of interest such that all others are removed. The output of each of the bit stream<br>
modules 990 is stored in memory 956 via memory controller 952.<br>
The processor 992 retrieves the data of each channel of interest from memory 956 and<br>
converts it into generic data 960. The processor 992 causes the generic data 960 to be stored in<br>
memory 956 via the memory controller. The processing 992 may utilize the input bit bucket 996 to<br>
retrieve bytes of data from the memory 956 in a bit stream fashion. As such, the input bit bucket<br>
996 performs the function of converting bytes of data, which are stored in memory, into bits of<br>
data, which are processed by processor 996. The input bit bucket 996 may be utilized to retrieve<br>
any type of data from memory 956 by processor 992.<br>
The MPEG encoding module 1002 retrieves the generic data 960 under the control of the<br>
decoder instruction packet module 998. The buffered motion predictor 1018 receives the generic<br>
data 960 and produces therefrom motion compensated data. The motion compensated data is<br>
provided to the DCT module 1020, which performs a discrete cosine transform upon the data to<br>
produce DCT data. The quantizer and zigzag module 1022 receives the DCT data and quantizes it<br>
and zigzags it before providing the processed data to a Huffman encoder 1024. The Huffinan<br>
encoder encodes the data to produce the specific formatted data, which is provided back to memory<br>
956 via the output bit bucket 1026 via memory controller 952. The output bit bucket 1026 converts<br>
the bits received from the Huffman encoder 1024 and provides it as bytes of data to memory<br>
controller 952.<br>
The memory controller 952 retrieves the MPEG encoded data from memory 956 and<br>
provides it as a stream of data 962 via the DMA interface 1028 to the system bus 976. The<br>
transceiving module retrieves the stream of data 962 from the system bus and processes it as<br>
previously discussed.<br>
The MPEG decoder module 1004 may be utilized to decode incoming MPEG data to<br>
produce the generic data 960 and/or to decode MPEG encoded data received from client modules.<br>
The MPEG decoding module 1004, under the instruction of the decode instruction packet module<br>
998 receives MPEG encoded data and dezigzags and dequantizes it via the dezigzag and<br>
dequantizer module 1010. The dezigzag and dequantized data is provided to the IDCT module<br>
1012 which performs an inverse discrete cosine transform function upon the data. The resulting<br>
data is then either provided to macroblock buffer 1014 or provided to memory 956 via memory<br>
controller 952. The motion compensation and sealer module 1016, under the control of the decoder<br>
instruction packet module 998, retrieves data either from the macroblock buffer 1014 or from<br>
memory 956 to perform a motion compensation and scaling function thereon. The resulting data is<br>
then either provided back to memory 956 or to the MPEG encoding module 1002.<br>
The digital to analog converter 1006 is operably coupled to receive the stream of data 962<br>
and convert it into analog signals 1030. The analog signals 1030 may be provided to legacy-type<br>
client devices that still transceive data in an analog format.<br>
Figure 41 illustrates a schematic block diagram of another channel mixer 1040, which may<br>
be utilized in any one of the previously described multimedia servers. The channel mixer 1040<br>
includes a processing module 1042 and memory 1044. The processing module 1042 may be a<br>
single processing device or a plurality of processing devices. Such a processing device may be a<br>
microprocessor, microcontroller, microcomputer, central processing unit, digital signal processor,<br>
programmable gate array, logic circuitry, state machine and/or any device that manipulates signals<br>
(analog or digital) based on operational instructions. The memory 1044 may be a single memory<br>
device or a plurality of memory devices. Such a memory device may be a read-only memory,<br>
random access memory, system memory, flash memory, magnetic tape memory, hard drive<br>
memory, and/or any device that stores digital information. Note that when the processing module<br>
1042 performs one or more of its functions via a state machine or logic circuitry, the memory<br>
storing the corresponding operational instructions is embedded within the circuitry comprising the<br>
state machine or logic circuitry. The channel mixer 1040 performs the functions as generally<br>
described in the preceding figures and further performs the functions described in Figures 42-49.<br>
Figure 42 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for mixing channels within a multimedia<br>
system. The process begins at Step 1050 where a set of channels is received as encoded channel<br>
data. The process then proceeds to Step 1051 where the channel mixer interprets the encoded<br>
channel data to identify a channel of interest for each specific channel selection request it is<br>
processing. For example, the set of channels may be received as packets containing the encoded<br>
channel data from a tuning module. Each packet includes a header section and a payload section.<br>
The encoded channel data may be interpreted by reviewing the header section to identify the<br>
particular channel of interest. The channel of interest may be identified based on the identity of a<br>
source of the channel data, the identity of the client requesting it, and/or the multimedia resources<br>
processing the channel request.<br>
If the channel of interest is included within a group of compressed video channels, as<br>
would be the case for MPEG 2 encoded video data, the channel of interest is retrieved from one of<br>
the group of compressed video channels based on header information contained within the packets<br>
transporting the encoded channel data. Having identified the particular channel of interest, it is<br>
isolated from the group of compressed video channels.<br>
The interpretation of Step 1051 may further be described with reference to Step 1056-<br>
1060. At Step 1056, the channel mixer interprets the encoded channel data to identify a series of<br>
channels of interest from the set of channels based on a corresponding series of channel selection<br>
request. In other words, the channel mixer is identifying each channel of interest for each channel<br>
selection request being processed. The process then proceeds to Step 1058 where the channel<br>
mixer processes data each of the series of channels of interest based on the type of channel to<br>
produce a series of generic data. The type of channel may be audio data, video data, text data,<br>
and/or a combination thereof. The processing then proceeds to Step 1060 where the series of<br>
generic data is converted into a stream of data.<br>
Returning to the main flow of Figure 42 with processing of a single channel selection<br>
request, the process continues at Step 1052 where the channel mixer processes data of the channel<br>
of interest based on the type of channel to produce generic data. The processing may include<br>
decoding the data, filtering the data to isolate the particular channel of interest and then converting<br>
the data to the generic data based on the type of data. For example, when the type of data is multi-<br>
channel compress video, the processing includes filtering the multi-channel compress video to<br>
produce the channel of interest. The channel of interest is then converted to generic data, which<br>
will be described in greater detail with reference to Figures 43 and 44.<br>
Continuing with the examples of the type of data, when the type of data is single channel<br>
compress video, the processing includes passing the single channel compress video as the channel<br>
of interest. When the type of data is multi-channel digitized video data, the multi-channel digital<br>
video data is filtered to produce the channel of interest; when the type of data is single channel<br>
digitized .video data, it is passed as the channel of interest; when the type of data is multi-channel<br>
digital audio, it is filtered to produce the channel of interest; when the type of data is single channel<br>
digital audio, it is passed as the channel of interest; and, when the type of data is network carrier<br>
data, it is passed as the channel of interest. As such, the channel of interest is then converted to the<br>
generic data. The process then proceeds to Step 1054 where the generic data is converted into a<br>
stream of data.<br>
Figure 43 illustrates a logic diagram of a method that further describes the processing of<br>
the data of the channel of interest as generally described in Step 1052 of Figure 42. The processing<br>
may be done in any one or more of Steps 1070-1082. At Step 1070, the channel mixer converts<br>
video data of the channel of interest into generic video data when the type of data is multi-channel<br>
compressed video. Typically, multi-channel compress video will be received via a satellite<br>
connection where the data is MPEG, or other MPEG standardized encoding.<br>
At Step 1072, the channel mixer converts video data of the channel of interest into generic<br>
video data when the type of data is single channel compress video. Single channel compress video<br>
may be from a DVD player or other source that produces a single channel of MPEG 2, or other<br>
MPEG standard, encoded video data.<br>
At Step 1074, the channel mixer converts video data of the channel of interest into generic<br>
data when the type of data is multi-channel digitized video data. The multi-channel digitized video<br>
data may be received from a plurality of NTSC television tuners, et cetera.<br>
At Step 1076, the channel mixer converts video data of the channel of interest into generic<br>
video data when the type of data is single channel digitized video data. The single channel<br>
digitized video data may be received as the output of a VCR, output of a DVD player to a standard<br>
antenna or cable connection of a television set, an NTSC television tuner, et cetera.<br>
At Step 1078, the channel mixer converts audio data of the channel of interest into generic<br>
audio data when the type of audio data is multi-channel digital audio. Multi-channel digital audio<br>
signals may be received from a satellite broadcast, or from multiple digital audio sources, such as a<br>
CD player, DVD audio player, et cetera.<br>
At Step 1080, the channel mixer converts audio data of the channel of interest into generic<br>
audio data when the type of audio data is single channel digital audio. The single channel digital<br>
audio may be received from a CD player, MP3 player, system memory that is storing digitized<br>
audio, DVD audio player, et cetera.<br>
At Step 1082, the channel mixer passes network data as the channel of interest when the<br>
data being processed is network data. Network data corresponds to one or more client modules<br>
accessing the Internet, participating in a telephone conversation via the PSTN, and/or client-to-<br>
client communication.<br>
Figure 44 illustrates a logic diagram that further defines the processing of the data of Step<br>
1052 of Figure 42 when the data is being converted into generic video data. This may be done in<br>
one or more of Steps 1084-1092.<br>
At Step 1084, the channel mixer converts the video data of the channel of interest into<br>
MPEG formatted video data. The video data may be the multiple compress video, the single<br>
channel compress video, the multi-channel digitized video data, and/or the single channel digitized<br>
video data.<br>
At Step 1086, the channel mixer converts the video data of the channel of interest into<br>
JPEG formatted video data. At Step 1088, the channel mixer converts the video data of the channel<br>
of interest into M-IPEG formatted video data.<br>
At Step 1090, the channel mixer converts the video data of the channel of interest into<br>
digital RGB video data. The digital RGB data may be stored in the associated memory device of<br>
the multimedia server, stored in the host system memory, et cetera.<br>
At Step 1092, the channel mixer converts the video data of the channel of interest into<br>
digital YCBCR video data. The digital YCBCR video data may be stored in the multimedia server<br>
memory, the host system memory associated with the multimedia server, et cetera.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the incoming video data from a plurality<br>
of multimedia sources may be in a variety of video formats including digitized audio MPEG 1, '<br>
MPEG 2, et cetera, analog format, et cetera. The various formatted video data is converted by the<br>
channel mixer into a generic video format, which may be MPEG, JPEG, M-JPEG, digital RGB<br>
video data, digital YCBCR video data, and/or any other conventional technique for storing video<br>
information in a digital format.<br>
Figure 45 illustrates a logic diagram of a method that further defines the processing of Step<br>
1052 of Figure 42 when audio data is being converted into generic audio data. The processing may<br>
be done by implementing one or more of Steps 1100-1104.<br>
At Step 1100, the channel mixer converts the audio data of the channel of interest into<br>
MPEG formatted audio data. At Step 1102, the channel mixer converts the audio data of the<br>
channel of interest into MP3 formatted audio data. At Step 1104, the channel mixer converts the<br>
audio data of the channel of interest into PCM digitized audio data.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, the multimedia server may receive a<br>
plurality of audio signals having various audio data formats. The channel mixer converts the<br>
various audio formats into a single audio format such as MPEG audio, MP3 audio, and/or PCM<br>
digitized audio. As one of average skill in the art will further appreciate, by converting video data<br>
and audio data into generic data formats, the multimedia server more readily processes it. The<br>
processing of the generic data has been generally described to convert the generic data into a<br>
specific formatted data (e.g., MPEG 2 video and audio), before transmission to the plurality of<br>
clients.<br>
Figure 46 illustrates a logic diagram of a method that further describes the converting of<br>
the generic data into a stream of data of Step 1054 of Figure 42. The processing begins at Step<br>
1110 where the channel mixer determines the type of data of the channel of interest. The<br>
processing then proceeds to Step 1112 where the channel mixer converts the generic data into the<br>
stream of data based on the type of data. The conversion processing at Step 1112 may be further<br>
described in one or more of Steps 1114-1126.<br>
At Step 1114, the channel mixer converts the generic video data of the channel of interest<br>
into specific video data when the original data was multi-channel compressed video. The specific<br>
video data may be in accordance with the MPEG 2 standard, MPEG 1 standard, and/or any of the<br>
other MPEG standards, or other standardized process for conveying digitized video.<br>
At Step 1116, the channel mixer converts the generic video data of the channel of interest<br>
into the specific video data when the original video data was a single channel compressed video<br>
signal. At Step 1118, the channel mixer converts the generic video data of the channel of interest<br>
into the specific video data when the original video data was multi-channel digitized video data. At<br>
Step 1120, the channel mixer converts the generic video data of the channel of interest into the<br>
specific video data when the original video data was a single channel digitized video signal.<br>
At Step 1122, the channel mixer converts the generic audio data of the channel of interest<br>
into specific audio data when the original audio data was multi-channel digital audio. At Step<br>
1124, the channel mixer converts the generic audio data of the channel of interest into specific<br>
audio data when the type of data is single channel digital audio. Note that the specific audio data<br>
may be in accordance with the MPEG 2 format, MP3 format, PCM encoded audio, et cetera.<br>
At Step 1126, the channel mixer passes network data of the channel of interest without<br>
conversion to a specific format. Accordingly, the network data is passed.via the channel mixer<br>
without conversion to a specific format, however, it is mixed with the other channels of interest to<br>
produce the stream of channel data.<br>
Figure 47 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for converting the generic video data of<br>
the channel of interest into an MPEG 2 specific video data format. The processing begins at Step<br>
1130 where the channel mixer performs a motion prediction on the generic video data to produce<br>
motion prediction data. The process then proceeds to Step 1132 where the channel mixer performs<br>
a discrete cosine transform on the motion prediction data to produce DCT data. The process then<br>
proceeds to Step 1134 where the channel mixer quantizes the DCT data to produce quantized data.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1136 where the channel mixer zigzags processes the quantized<br>
data to produce ZZ data. The process then proceeds to Step 1138 where the channel mixer<br>
Huffman encodes the ZZ data to produce the MPEG 2 specific video formatted data. As one of<br>
average skill in the art will appreciate, Steps 1130-1138 are known in the art, thus no further<br>
discussion will be presented except to further illustrate the concepts of the present invention.<br>
Figure 48 illustrates a logic diagram that further defines the processing of Step 1052 of<br>
Figure 42. The processing begins at Step 1140 where the channel mixer receives a control signal<br>
that indicates multiple channel processing, when the channel of interest is a compressed video<br>
signal and one of many compressed video channels. The process then proceeds to Step 1142 where<br>
the channel mixer decompresses the multiple compressed video channels to produce multiple<br>
channels. The process then proceeds to Step 1144 where the channel mixer processes data of the<br>
multiple channels based on the type of channel to produce multiple generic data. The process then<br>
proceeds to Step 1146 where the channel mixer converts the multiple generic data into the stream<br>
of data.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will appreciate, MPEG encoded video received via a<br>
satellite connection, or other type connection, typically includes multiple channels within a typical<br>
6Mhz band. As such, multiple channels are received within the typical single channel band. As<br>
such, the video for the channels in the single channel band are decompressed to retrieve the actual<br>
video data. From there, the channel of interest may be extracted and processed accordingly, or all<br>
of the channels within the band may be processed into the stream of data.<br>
As one of average skill in the art will further appreciate, the stream of data is essentially a<br>
multiplexing of the specific formatted video data for each of the channel of interest. As such, when<br>
two channels of interest are being conveyed to the plurality of client modules, each channel<br>
comprises approximately 50% of the stream of data. Accordingly, as the number of channels of<br>
interest is being processed, the corresponding percentage of the stream of data decreases but<br>
decreases proportionally.<br>
Figure 49 illustrates an alternate logic diagram of a method for channel mixing of signals<br>
within a multimedia communication system. The process begins at Step 1150 where a channel<br>
mixer receives a set of channels as encoded channel data. The process then proceeds to Step 1152<br>
where the channel mixer interprets the encoded channel data to identify the type of data of a<br>
particular channel of interest contained within the set of channels. The interpretation is based on a<br>
specific channel selection request received via one of the plurality of clients. The encoded channel<br>
data may be received in packets and/or frames where the packets and frames each include a header<br>
section that provides identifying information such that the channel mixer may appropriately<br>
identify the particular channel of interest. In addition, the interpretation of the encoded channel<br>
data may further include determining the filtering requirements to extract the channel of interest<br>
from a plurality of channels.<br>
The processing proceeds to Step 1154 where the channel mixer separates the channels of<br>
interest from the set of channels based on the type of data. The process then proceeds to Step 1156<br>
where the channel mixer processes the data of the channels of interest based on the type of data to<br>
produce generic data. Such processing was previously described with reference to Figures 43-46.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1158 where the channel mixer converts the generic data into a<br>
stream of data. This was previously described with reference to Figure 46 and 47.<br>
Figure 50 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a client module 1160 operably coupled<br>
to a client device. The client module 1160 may be any of the client modules illustrated in Figures<br>
1-11. The client module 1100 includes a video decoder 1162 and/or rendering module 1164,<br>
embedded dynamic random access memory (DRAM) 1168, and a network interface controller 1166.<br>
The client device includes a client system bus 1172, a client processor 1174, memory bridge 1176<br>
and client system memory 1178. The client device may be a laptop computer, personal computer,<br>
personal digital assistant, CRT monitor, flat panel monitor, television set, high definition television<br>
set, a SDTV, a home theatre system, and/or any device that has a audio and/or video display<br>
associated with it.<br>
The client module 1160 is operably coupled to the client system bus 1172 via a system bus<br>
interface 1170. The system bus interface 1170 may couple the client module 1180 to external<br>
serial and/or parallel ports of the client device and/or internal interfaces within the client device.<br>
Such external interfaces include universal serial bus (USB), serial port, IR port, parallel port, et<br>
cetera. Internal connections include PCI bus, AC 97 interface, and/or any interface that allows a<br>
peripheral component to interface with the memory bridge of a host device.<br>
The network interface controller 1166 is operably coupled to the multimedia server, which<br>
may be any one of the multimedia servers shown in Figures 1-11. The network, interface controller<br>
1166 receives packets and/or frames from the multimedia server and extract data 1186 for a<br>
channel of interest 1184. In. essence, the network interface controller 1166 monitors the packets on<br>
the communication path with the multimedia server to identify packets that are addressing the<br>
client module 1160. When such packets and/or frames are identified, the network interface<br>
controller extracts the data 1186 from the frames and/or packets and provides the data to the video<br>
decoder 1162 and/or the rendering module 1166.<br>
The video decoder 1162 decodes the data 1186 to produce display data. The display data<br>
may be stored in the embedded memory 1168. The rendering module 1164 retrieves the display<br>
data from the embedded memory 1168 and provides it as rendered video images 1188 to the client<br>
device. As such, the rendering module 1164 prepares the data for display by a display of the client<br>
device.<br>
Figure 51 illustrates a more detailed schematic block diagram of a client module 1175<br>
which may be used to implement any one of the client modules illustrated in Figures 1-11. The<br>
client module 1175 includes the rendering module 1164, a memory controller 1216, the memory<br>
device 1168, an internal bus 1201, the video decoder 1162, the network interface controller 1166, a<br>
request module 1212, a video processor 1198, a video camera 1196, at least one speaker 1214, a<br>
microphone 1194, and an audio processor 1192. The video decoder 1162 includes a Huffman<br>
decoder 1202, a dezigzag and dequantizer module 1204, an inverse discrete cosine transform<br>
module 1206, a macroblock buffer 1208, and a motion compensation and sealer 1210. The<br>
function of the video decoder 1162 is known, thus no further discussion of the video decoder or its<br>
components will be provided except to further illustrate the concepts of the present invention.<br>
The network interface controller 1166 includes a transmitting module 1190 and the<br>
receiving module 1200. The receiving module 1200 receives encoded channel data 1180, which<br>
may be in packet form, or in frames. The receiving module interprets the packets and/or frames to<br>
extract data 1186 for the particular channel of interest 1184. The extracted data is placed on bus<br>
1201 for storage and RAM 1168. The data 1186 is subsequently retrieved from memory 1168 by<br>
the video decoder 1162 to produce decoded video data. The decoded video data is stored once<br>
again in the memory 1168. The rendering module 1164 subsequently retrieves the decoded video<br>
data from memory 1168 and processes it to produce rendered video images 1188. The rendered<br>
video images 1188 are then provided onto the client system bus 1172 for subsequent display. Note<br>
that the client device includes a display, which includes a video display and/or audio display.<br>
If the encoded channel data 1180 includes frames andVor packets of audio data for the<br>
client module 1175, the receiving module 1200 provides the audio data to audio processor 1192,<br>
which prefers the audio data for display. The prepared audio data may be stored in 1168 for<br>
subsequent playback or provided to the client system bus 1172.<br>
In addition, the audio processor 1192 may receive audio signals via microphone 1194. The<br>
audio processor 1192 processes the audio signals from microphone 1194 and either provides them<br>
to the client system bus 1172 or to the memory 1168. If the audio data from microphone 1194 is to<br>
be transmitted to the multimedia server, the transmitting module 1190 subsequently retrieves the<br>
audio data from 1168 and provides it to the multimedia server.<br>
The request module 1212 receives the selection request from the client device. As<br>
previously discussed, the selection request identifies the particular channel of interest that the client<br>
desires to access from the multimedia server. The transmitting module 1190 prepares the selection<br>
request for transmission to the multimedia server via the communication path. The transmitting<br>
module 1190 utilizes an encoding and/or modulation scheme in accordance with the data<br>
conveyance protocol of the multimedia communication system.<br>
The client module 1175 may also include interfacing for receiving video signals from a<br>
video camera 1196 via video processor 1198. The video processor 1198 processes video signals<br>
from the video camera 1196 and either provides them to the client system bus 1172 or stores them<br>
in RAM 1168. If the stored video signals are to be provided to the multimedia server, the<br>
transmitting module 1190 retrieves the video data from RAM 1168 and prepares them for<br>
transmission. The preparation of video data for transmission is in accordance with the data<br>
conveyance protocol used within the multimedia communication system. As one of average skill<br>
in the art will appreciate, the memory controller 1216 controls the reading and writing of data to<br>
and from RAM 1168. As one of average skill in the art will also appreciate, the client module 1175<br>
may have interfaces for connecting to an audio processor 1192 and/or video processor 1198, where<br>
such devices may be included in the client device.<br>
Figure 52 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a client module 1220, which may be<br>
used to implement any one of the client modules illustrated in Figures 1-11. The client module<br>
1220 includes a processing module 1222 and memory 1224. The processing module 1222 may be<br>
similar to the processing module 364 used in the client module of Figure 11 and memory 1224 may<br>
be similar to memory 366 used in the client module of Figure 11. The processing module 1222<br>
may be a single processing device or a plurality of processing devices. Such a processing device<br>
may be a microcontroller, microcomputer, microprocessor, digital signal processor, central<br>
processing unit, programmable gate array, state machine, logic circuitry, and/or any device that<br>
manipulates signals (analog or digital) based on operational instructions. The memory 1224 may<br>
be a single memory device or a plurality of memory devices. Such a memory device may be a<br>
read-only memory, random access memory, system memory, floppy disk memory, hard drive<br>
memory, magnetic tape memory, flash memory, and/or any device that stores digital information.<br>
Note that when the processing module 1222 implements one or more of its functions via a state<br>
machine or logic circuitry, the memory storing the corresponding operational instructions is<br>
embedded within the circuitry comprising the state machine and/or logic circuit. The operational<br>
instructions performed by processing module 1222 and stored in memory 1224 are illustrated as<br>
logic diagrams as shown in Figures 53-56.<br>
Figure 53 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for processing data within a client<br>
module. The processing begins at Step 1240 where the client module transmits a channel selection<br>
request that identifies a channel of interest. The channel selection request is provided to a<br>
multimedia server which, subsequently responds by providing a stream of channel data that<br>
wherein at least a portion of the stream of data includes data corresponding to the channel of<br>
interest.<br>
The process continues at Step 1230 where the client module receives the set of channels as<br>
a stream of data from a multimedia server. The receiving may further include decoding the stream<br>
of data to recapture data of the channel of interest (i.e., the channel corresponding to the one<br>
requested by the client module's client). The decoding may include one or more of multi-level<br>
decoding, non-return to zero decoding, Manchester decoding, block decoding, and/or nB/mB<br>
decoding where n 
The process then proceeds to Step 1232 where the client module interprets segments of the<br>
stream of data to identify data corresponding to the channel of interest. The segments may be<br>
frames and/or packets of data that include header information. The header information includes<br>
identity of the client module, the source of the data, et cetera such that the client module may<br>
readily identify the particular packets and/or frames destined for the client module. The process<br>
then proceeds to Step 1234 where the client module interprets the data of the channel of interest to<br>
determine the type of data, where the type of data may be audio data, video data, and/or text data.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1236 where the client module processes the data of the<br>
channel of interest based on the type of data to produce processed data. The process then proceeds<br>
to Step 1238 where the client module provides the processed data to the client for display.<br>
Figure 54 illustrates a logic diagram of a method that further describes Steps 1236 and<br>
1238 of Figure 53. The processing begins at Step 1250 where the type of data is determined. The<br>
type of data may be video data, application data, and/or audio data. For video data, the process<br>
proceeds to Step 1252 where the client module converts the data of the channel of interest into<br>
YUV data and/or RGB data. When the data is received in MPEG format, the conversion may be<br>
done as shown in Steps 1260-1268. At Step 1260, the client module utilizes a Huffman decoder to<br>
decode the video. The process then proceeds to Step 1262 where the Huffman decoded data is<br>
dezigzagged.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1264 where the dezigzagged data is dequantized. The<br>
process then proceeds to Step 1266 where the dequantized data has an inverse discrete cosine<br>
transform function performed upon it. The process then proceeds to Step 1268 where motion<br>
compensation and/or scaling function is performed upon the IDCT data to produce the YUV data.<br>
The YUV data may then be converted into RGB data and stored in memory. As one of average<br>
skill in the art will appreciate, both YUV data and RGB data may be maintained for use by the<br>
client module and/or associated client device.<br>
Returning to the flow of processing video data, the process continues at Step 1254 where<br>
the YUV data and/or the RGB data is stored in a frame buffer (e.g., the memory of the client<br>
module and/or memory of the client device) as the processed data. The process then proceeds to<br>
Step 1256 where the client module retrieves the YUV data and/or RGB data from the frame buffer<br>
at a display rate to produce retrieved display data. The process then proceeds to Step 1258 where<br>
the client module renders the retrieved display data for display. The rendered data is provided to<br>
the client device for subsequent display.<br>
If the type of data is audio data, the process proceeds to Step 1280. At Step 1280, the<br>
client module converts the audio data of the channel of interest into PCM data. The process then<br>
proceeds to Step 1282 where the client module stores the PCM data in a frame buffer (e.g., the<br>
RAM within the client module and/or memory of the client device) as processed data. The process<br>
then proceeds to Step 1284 where the client module retrieves the PCM data from the frame buffer<br>
at a display rate. The process then proceeds to Step 1286 where the client module provides the<br>
retrieved display data to at least one speaker assembly either associated with the client module<br>
sad/or within the client device.<br>
If the type of data is application data, the process proceeds to Step 1270. At Step 1270, the<br>
client module stores the application data in memory as the processed data. Note that the<br>
application data corresponds to data received via an Internet connection, client-to-client<br>
communication, and/or telephone communication. The process then proceeds to Step 1272 where<br>
the client module retrieves the processed data from memory. The process then proceeds to Step<br>
1274 where the client module provides the processed data to a processor. The processor may be<br>
within the client device and/or the processor within the client device.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1276 where the processor generates video data from the<br>
processed data. The process then proceeds to Step 1278 where the video data is provided for<br>
display by the client device.<br>
Figures 55 and 56 illustrate a logic diagram of an alternate method for a client module to<br>
provide a channel selection request and receive corresponding data within a multimedia system.<br>
The process begins at Step 1290 where the client module receives an input from a client. The input<br>
signal may be received an interface with the client where the client includes at least one of a<br>
personal computer, laptop computer, personal digital assistant, video telephone, digital telephone,<br>
cellular telephone, monitor, CRT monitor, LCD monitor, television set, high definition television<br>
set, and/or any device that includes a video and/or audio display device. In addition, the interface<br>
with the client device between the client module may include a wireless communication path such<br>
that the remote control device associated with the client device provides the input signal to the<br>
client module.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1292 where the client module interprets the input signal<br>
to determine the type of signal being requested. The process then proceeds to Step 1294 where the<br>
client module determines that the type of signal as either video, audio, application or control. If the<br>
type of signal is audio, the process proceeds to Step 1296 where the client module processes the<br>
audio signal to produce generic audio data. This may be done as shown at Step 1302 where the<br>
client module converts the audio data into MPEG formatted audio data, MP3 formatted audio data,<br>
and/or PCM digitized audio data.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1298 where the client module converts the generic audio<br>
data into a stream of data. This may be done as shown in Step 1304 where the client module<br>
encodes the generic audio data based on a data conveyance protocol to produce the stream of data.<br>
The type of encoding may include one or more of multi-level encoding, non-return to zero<br>
encoding, Manchester encoding, block encoding, and/or nB/mB encoding where n 
The process then proceeds to Step 1300 where the client module transmits the stream of<br>
data to the multimedia server. The transmission of the stream of data includes packetizing and/or<br>
framing the data in accordance with the data conveyance protocol used by the multimedia<br>
communication system. In addition, the transmission of the stream of data may include utilizing a<br>
modulation scheme such as TDM, FDM, ASK, PSK, et cetera.<br>
If the client module determines that the type of signal is control signals, the process<br>
proceeds to Step 1306. At Step 1306, the client module determines whether the control<br>
information relates to a local command or a system level command. The process then proceeds to<br>
Step 1308 where the client module determines the system level or local level command. If it is a<br>
system level command, the process proceeds to Step 1310 where the client module processes the<br>
control information for conveyance to the multimedia server to produce a control message. The<br>
processing of the control information may include encoding the control message based on the data<br>
conveyance protocol of the multimedia communication system, and utilizing the data conveyance<br>
protocol which may include packetizing and/or framing the data as well as utilizing a modulation<br>
scheme such as CSMA, CSMA with collision avoidance, and/or CSMA with collision detection for<br>
packets of data and time division multiplexing and/or frequency division multiplexing for frames of<br>
data.<br>
The processing then proceeds to Step 312 where the client module transmits the control<br>
message to the multimedia server. The control message may include the channel selection request,<br>
which identifies the particular channel of interest for processing by the client module.<br>
If the type of control information relates to a local command, the process proceeds to Step<br>
1318. At Step 1318, the client module locally processes the input signal to provide the channel of<br>
interest to the client Accordingly, the client module may interpret the control information, which<br>
includes a channel selection request and determines that another client is already accessing that<br>
particular channel. As such, the client module simply extracts the channel data destined for the<br>
other client and utilizes it to service its client<br>
If the client module determines that the type of signal is application related, the process<br>
proceeds to Step 1314. At Step 1314, the client module processes the input signal to produce<br>
processed application data. The application data may be data related to a network application such<br>
as email and/or web browser, a telephone communication, and/or a client-to-client communication.<br>
Such processing for a telephone communication would include the similar functionality that the<br>
handset performs in a cordless telephone.<br>
The processing for data within the Internet access is simply functioning as a terminal to<br>
provide input selections and/or received data from the multimedia server, which performs the<br>
network applications. The process then proceeds to Step 1316 where the client module transmits<br>
the process application data to the multimedia server. The process application data is formatted in<br>
accordance with the data conveyance protocol of the multimedia communication system, which<br>
includes encoding and/or a modulation scheme.<br>
As shown in Figure 56, if the type of signal is video, the processing continues at Step 1320.<br>
At Step 1320, the client module processes the video signal to produce generic video data. This<br>
may be done in one of a variety of ways as shown in Steps 1328-1336. At Step 1328, the client<br>
module converts the video signal of the channel of interest into MPEG formatted video data. At<br>
Step 1330, the client module converts the video signal of the channel of interest into JPEG<br>
formatted video data. At Step 1332, the client module converts the video signal of the channel of<br>
interest into MPEG formatted video data. At Step 1334, the client module converts the video<br>
signal of the channel of interest into digital RGB video data. At Step 1336, the client module<br>
converts the video signal of the channel of interest into digital YCBCR video data. As one of<br>
average skill in the art will appreciate, the client module is performing a similar function as the<br>
multimedia server performs when conveying video and/or audio data to the multimedia server.<br>
Returning to the main processing of video data, the process continues at Step 1322 where<br>
the client module converts the generic video data into a stream of data. This may be done as shown<br>
at Step 1326 where the client module encodes the generic video data based on a data conveyance<br>
protocol of the multimedia communication system. The data conveyance protocol may include a<br>
particular type of encoding such as Manchester encoding, multi-level encoding, et cetera and also a<br>
corresponding modulation scheme such as FDMA, TDMA, CSMA, CSMA with collision<br>
avoidance, or CSMA with collision detection. The process then proceeds to Step 1324 where the<br>
stream of data is transmitted as either packets or frames to the multimedia server.<br>
Figure 57 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for a multimedia server to act as a hub<br>
based network access module for a plurality of client modules. The processing steps shown in<br>
Figure 57 as well as in Figures 58-62 may be performed by the multimedia server of Figure 2, 7<br>
and/or 11. The processing begins at Step 1340 where the multimedia server receives packets from<br>
at least one of a plurality of clients. The process then proceeds to Step 1342 where the multimedia<br>
server determines whether a network access application is active for the particular client If not,<br>
the process proceeds to Step 1344 where the multimedia server opens a network access application<br>
for the client.<br>
Once the network access application is open, or if the application was already open, the<br>
process proceeds to Step 1346. At Step 1346, the multimedia server processes data of at least one<br>
of the packets in accordance with the network access application to produce network data. The<br>
network access application may be an email application, web browser application, and/or any<br>
application that allows a user to access the Internet or other wide area network. The process then<br>
proceeds to Step 1348 where the multimedia server determines how to access a network connection<br>
(e.g., a modem) for transmission of the network data. Accessing the network connection is based<br>
on a "client access to network connection scheme", which will be subsequently discussed. The<br>
process then proceeds to Step 1350 where the multimedia server transports the network data via the<br>
network connection to a wide area network based on the determined network access.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1352 where the multimedia server logs a destination<br>
address and/or source address for each packet of network data transmitted via the network<br>
connection. The logging enables the multimedia server to accurately track the appropriate<br>
destination within the multimedia communication system for the received data when it receives a<br>
response via the wide area network. The process then proceeds to Step 1354 where the multimedia<br>
server receives network packets via the network connection. The process then proceeds to Step<br>
1356 where the multimedia server interprets a header section of the network packets to identify a<br>
response to the network data. The response includes an identifier that, identifies the particular<br>
destination within the multimedia communication system. The process then proceeds to Step 1358<br>
where the multimedia server provides the network packets to the particular client associated with<br>
the network data.<br>
Figure 58 illustrates a logic diagram mat further defines the determination of whether the<br>
network access application is active as shown in Step 1342 of Figure 57. The processing begins at<br>
Step 1360 where the multimedia server interprets a header section of at least one of the packets<br>
received from the client to identify the individual client. The process then proceeds to Step 1362<br>
where the multimedia server interprets the header section to determine the particular type of<br>
network access being requested. The process then proceeds to Step 1364 where the multimedia<br>
server determines whether the network application is active based on the identity of the particular<br>
client and the type of network access being requested.<br>
Figure 59 illustrates a logic diagram for the determination of the particular type of network<br>
access of Step 1362 of Figure 58. This may be done at either Step 1366 or Step 1368. At Step<br>
1366, the multimedia server interprets the header section of the at least one packet to determine<br>
email network access. At Step 1368, the multimedia server interprets the header section of the<br>
packet or packets to determine a web browser network access.<br>
Figure 60 illustrates a logic diagram of a method that further describes the determination of<br>
access to the network connection of Step 1348 of Figure 57. This may be done in one or more of<br>
Steps 1370-1378. At Step 1370, the multimedia server utilizes a time division multiplexing<br>
accessing scheme to provide access to the network connection for each of the clients that currently<br>
have an active network access application. At Step 1372, the multimedia server utilizes a carrier<br>
sensed multiple access process to determine the access to the network connection among the clients<br>
that currently have an active network access application.<br>
At Step 1374, the multimedia server utilizes a token passing scheme among the clients that<br>
currently have an active network access application to determine access to the network connection.<br>
At Step 1376, the multimedia server utilizes a queuing scheme of the network data for each client<br>
that has a currently active network access application open. The queuing scheme may be based on<br>
a first-in first-out buffering arrangement. At Step 1378, the multimedia server responds to a<br>
request for access to the network connection from the resources within the channel mixer<br>
processing the particular request.<br>
Figure 61 illustrates a logic diagram of an alternate method for a multimedia server to act<br>
as a hub based network access connection for a plurality of clients. The processing begins at Step<br>
1380 where the multimedia server receives packets from at least one of a plurality of clients. The<br>
process then proceeds to Step 1382 where the multimedia server interprets each packet to<br>
determine whether the packet is a client-to-client packet or network packet. The interpretation is<br>
done by reviewing the header section of the packet, which includes an indication as to whether it is<br>
client-to-client data or network data.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1384 where the multimedia server determines whether<br>
the packet relates to client-to-client data or network data. For client-to-client data, the process<br>
proceeds to Step 1386 where the multimedia server processes the packet to produce processed<br>
client packets. Such processing includes packetizing the client-to-client communication for<br>
subsequent transmission to one or more other clients within .the multimedia communication system.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1388 where the multimedia server multiplexes the<br>
process client packets for transmission to the plurality of clients, which yields multiplex client<br>
packets. The process client packets are also multiplexed with network data destined for clients,<br>
video data destined for clients and/or audio data destined for clients. The process then proceeds to<br>
Step 1390 where the multimedia server transmits the multiplex client data to the plurality of clients<br>
in accordance with the data conveyance protocol used within the multimedia communication<br>
system.<br>
If the packet corresponds to network data, the process proceeds to Step 1392 where the<br>
multimedia server identifies at least one of the clients from the packet. The process then proceeds<br>
to Step 1394 where the multimedia server determines whether a network access application is<br>
active for the particular client. If not, the process proceeds to Step 1396 where the multimedia<br>
server opens a network access application (e.g., email and/or web browser application) for the<br>
particular client.<br>
Once a network application is open or has been opened, the process proceeds to Step 1398<br>
where the multimedia server processes data of the network packets in accordance with the network<br>
access application to produce network data. The process then proceeds to Step 1400 where the<br>
multimedia server determines access to the network connection for transmission of the network<br>
data based on the client access to network connection scheme. The process then proceeds to Step<br>
1402 where the multimedia server transports the network data via the network connection to a wide<br>
area network based on the determine network access. The determination of Step 1400 has been<br>
explained in greater detail with reference to Figure 60 and the determination of Step 1394 has been<br>
explained in greater detail with reference to Figures 58 and 59.<br>
Figure 62 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for a multimedia server to function as a<br>
 hub base network access for a plurality of clients. The process begins at Step 1420 where the<br>
multimedia server receives network packets via a network connection. The network packets are<br>
received from a wide area network system such as the Internet in response to information provided<br>
by the multimedia server on behalf of one or more clients. The process then proceeds to Step 1422<br>
where the multimedia server determines identity of at least one client that is a target of the network<br>
packet. This may be done by interpreting a header section of the network packet where the header<br>
section includes the destination address, which corresponds to an individual client. As such, each<br>
 network packet that is received, the multimedia server may readily determine the appropriate client.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1424 where the multimedia server determines whether a<br>
network access application is active for the particular client. The network application may be an<br>
email application and/or a web browser application. If the particular network access application is<br>
not active, the process proceeds to Step 1426 where the multimedia server opens one for the<br>
particular client.<br>
With a network access application open, the process proceeds to Step 1428 where the<br>
multimedia server processes data of the network packets to produce client data. The processing of<br>
the data may include preparing display data corresponding to the execution of the network<br>
application upon the incoming network packets and storing the resulting data as client data. The<br>
process then proceeds to Step 1430 where the multimedia server multiplexes client data for<br>
transmission to the plurality of clients. The client data may be multiplexed with other data destined<br>
for the clients, such other data includes video data, audio data, and/or other application data. The<br>
process then proceeds to Step 1432 where the multimedia server transmits the multiplex client data<br>
to the plurality of clients in accordance with the data conveyance protocol of the multimedia<br>
communication system.<br>
The processing continues at Step 1434 where the multimedia server receives client-to-<br>
client packets from at least one client. The process then proceeds to Step 1434 where the-<br>
multimedia server processes the client-to-client packets to produce processed client packets. The<br>
process then proceeds to Step 1438 where the multimedia server multiplexes the processed client<br>
packets with other client data for transmission to the plurality of clients. The process then proceeds<br>
to Step 1440 where the multimedia server transmits the multiplex client data to the plurality of<br>
clients.<br>
Figure 63 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for managing resources within a<br>
multimedia system. The processing illustrating in Figure 63, as well as those illustrated in Figures<br>
64 &amp; 65, may be executed by any one of the multimedia servers illustrated in Figures 1-11. The<br>
processing begins at Step 1450 where the multimedia server receives a client request for a<br>
multimedia service. The multimedia system service includes one or more of accessing a channel<br>
from a satellite connection, cable connection, NTSC broadcast connection, HDTV broadcast<br>
connection, SDTV broadcast connection, output of a VCR DVD radio receiver, CD player, MP3<br>
player, et cetera.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1452 where the multimedia server determines whether<br>
the client request is valid. The determination of whether the client request is valid may be based on<br>
whether the particular client has access to the particular video program that is being requested,<br>
determining whether the particular channel that is being selected exceeds parental control settings,<br>
and/or determining whether the clients request is received during an assigned access time.<br>
Accordingly, the assigned access time period corresponds to the time of day in which the user of<br>
the particular module may access services from the multimedia server. If the client request is not<br>
valid, the process proceeds to Step 1456 where the multimedia server denies the request.<br>
If, however, the request is valid, the process proceeds to Step 1458. At Step 1458, the<br>
multimedia server determines whether the multimedia system has sufficient resources to fulfill the<br>
client request. The determination of whether the multimedia system has sufficient resources<br>
includes determining whether the tuning module has the capacity to accommodate the client<br>
request, the channel mixer has sufficient processing resources to process the client request, and/or<br>
whether the communication path between the multimedia server and the plurality of clients has<br>
sufficient bandwidth to accommodate the client request.<br>
The process then proceeds to Step 1460 where a determination is made as to whether<br>
sufficient resources exist. If they do, the process proceeds to Step 1462. At Step 1462, the<br>
multimedia server allocates at least some of the resources to fulfill the client request based on a<br>
multimedia system resource allocation procedure. The multimedia system resource allocation<br>
procedure includes allocating the resources in a first-come-first-serve basis, allocating the<br>
resources in a trunked manner, and/or allocating the resources based on a predetermined<br>
assignment of particular resources to a particular client. Accordingly, a particular tuner, stream<br>
parsing module may be allocated to a particular client. As such, these resources would remain idle<br>
unless the particular client desires access to the multimedia system.<br>
In addition to allocating the resources as shown in Step 1462, the multimedia system may<br>
also provide the functionality as shown in Steps 1464-1468. At Step 1464, the multimedia server<br>
determines whether the system has access available resources. If not, the process reverts to Step<br>
1462. If so, the process proceeds to Step 1466 where the multimedia server determines whether the<br>
client has enhance feature privileges. The enhance feature privileges allow the client's favorite<br>
channels to be selected and processed by the multimedia server, previous-channel, next-channel,<br>
picture-in-picture, et cetera. If the client does not have the enhance features, the process reverts to<br>
Step 1462. If, however, the client has advanced features, the process proceeds to Step 1468. At<br>
Step 1468, the multimedia server allocates further resources to support the enhance features of the<br>
client.<br>
If sufficient resources are not available, the process proceeds to Figure 64, which provides<br>
a variety of alternatives for handling insufficient resources. One such approach is to remove the<br>
enhance features provided to particular clients to make resources available. Alternate processes are<br>
shown at Steps 1464, 1474 and 1478.<br>
At Step 1464, the multimedia server determines whether an alternate multimedia service is<br>
available for the particular client. This may be done as shown in one or more of Steps 1466-1472.<br>
At Step 1466, the multimedia server, for a video program, adjusts the resolution of the display to a<br>
default resolution, which reduces the processing requirements. At Step 1468, the multimedia<br>
server, for a video program, adjusts the video quality to a default video quality, which reduces the<br>
processing requirements to prepare the video data for the client.<br>
At Step 1470, the multimedia server queries the client to select an alternative multimedia<br>
service. The query may include a listing of channels currently being serviced and requesting that<br>
the client select one of those, and/or select an alternate resolution, video quality, et cetera. At Step<br>
1472, the multimedia server automatically selects an alternative multimedia service based on pre-<br>
programmed alternate selections. In essence, the client may pre-program its default settings or<br>
alternate multimedia services as opposed to being directly queried.<br>
At Step 1474, the multimedia server determines whether the client request has priority over<br>
currently serviced other client request. If so, the process proceeds to Step 1476 where the<br>
multimedia server preempts currently serviced client(s) to obtain the resources to fill the present<br>
client request. If the current client request does not have priority over at least one other currently<br>
serviced client, the present client's request is denied, and the client may be requested to access an<br>
alternative multimedia service.<br>
At Step 1478, the multimedia server determines whether allocation of resources can be<br>
reallocated to fill the client request. The process then proceeds to Step 1480 where the multimedia<br>
server adjusts allocation of the resources to fulfill the client request when the resources can be<br>
reallocated. The determination of whether resources can be reallocated is further described in<br>
Steps 1482 and 1484. At Step 1482, the multimedia server monitors the use of the resources in<br>
comparisons of the capabilities of the resources. The process then proceeds to Step 1484 where the<br>
multimedia server adjusts the allocation of resources when the use of at least some of the resources<br>
is not optimal. For example, if a particular resource is most efficient when processing compressed<br>
video from an HDTV source, satellite source, et cetera and is currently processing audio signals,<br>
the resource may be reallocated to process video signals while another resource is used to process<br>
the audio signals.<br>
Figure 65 illustrates a logic diagram of a method for managing resources within a<br>
multimedia -system. The process begins at Step 1490 where a multimedia server receives a client<br>
request for a multimedia service from a client. The multimedia service includes one or more of<br>
accessing a video source such as a channel of a satellite connection, channel of a cable connection,<br>
DVD player, VCR, and/or an audio source such as a CD player, DVD audio player, et cetera. The<br>
process then proceeds to Step 1492 where the multimedia server determines whether the client<br>
request is valid. If the client request is not valid as indicated at Step 1494, the process proceeds to<br>
Step 1496 where the multimedia server denies the request.<br>
If, however, the request is valid, the process proceeds to Step 1498 where the multimedia<br>
server determines whether the multimedia system has sufficient resources available to fulfill the<br>
client request. The process then proceeds to Step 1500 where the multimedia server branches<br>
based on whether sufficient resources exist. If sufficient resources exist, the process proceeds to<br>
Step 1502. At Step 1502, the multimedia server allocates best-matched resources to fulfill a client<br>
request. If sufficient resources do not exist, the processing at Figure 64 is utilized.<br>
To determine the best match resources to fulfill the client request, Steps 1504-1508 may be<br>
utilized. At Step 1504, the multimedia server maintains a listing of resource capabilities for each<br>
of the plurality of resources. The process then proceeds to Step 1506 where the multimedia server<br>
determines the type of resources needed to support the client request. The process then proceeds to<br>
Step 1508 where the multimedia server performs a best match analysis to identify the best match<br>
resources based on the resource capabilities and the type of resources needed. For example,<br>
resources within a tuning module and/or channel mixer may be most efficient when processing<br>
compressed video data from a satellite connection while others may be more adept at processing<br>
audio signals. As such, when a request for access to compressed video signal is received, the<br>
multimedia server attempts to allocate the resources that are best fitted to process the compressed<br>
video. Correspondingly, when a request for access to an audio source is received, the multimedia<br>
server attempts to allocate the best resources to fulfill the audio request.<br>
The preceding discussion has presented a method and apparatus for a multimedia<br>
communication system. The multimedia communication system allows a plurality of clients to<br>
have apparent direct access to a variety of audio sources, video sources, the internet, the public<br>
switch telephone network, et cetera without the typical receiving and transmitting circuitry<br>
associated with conventional direct access to such services. As one of average skill in the art will<br>
appreciate, other embodiments may be derived from the teaching of the present invention, without<br>
deviating from the scope of the claims.<br>
