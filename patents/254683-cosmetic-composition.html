COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS WITH ETHYLENE BRASSYLATE<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2008/028900<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/059220<br><br>
COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS WITH ETHYLENE BRASSYLATE<br>
5      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention concerns cosmetic compositions with aesthetics providing a silky afterfeei<br>
to the skin. 10<br>
The Related Art<br>
Proper aesthetics are essential to any successful skin cream or lotion. Without the proper<br>
feel, consumers would not buy or use even those products with the most proven<br>
dermatological benefits. 15<br>
Silkiness is known to be imparted by a variety of silicone materials. Yet the silicones do<br>
not transform compositions into a powdery afterfeei.   Typical disclosures of silicone<br>
materials for cosmetics are found in US 5 972 359 (Sine et al.) and US 6 524 598 B2<br>
(Sunkel et al.) 20<br>
Starches have been employed to enhance viscosity of liquid formulations.  For instance,<br>
US 5 824 323 (Fishman) reports skin lotion compositions with non-greasy skinfeel.<br>
These formulas can contain a variety of starches including tapioca to provide body and<br>
thickness to the lotions. 25<br>
US 2006/0034876 A1 (Cheney et al.) reports on combinations of tapioca starch and<br>
polyacrylic beads which deliver a silky rub-in aesthetic transforming into a powdery drier<br>
skin afterfeei.<br>
30 Although solutions have been suggested to solve the problem of delivering silky feel to the skin, there still remains the challenge of formulating a cosmetic that in a much greater variety of formulations can achieve the aesthetically required silky smooth skin afterfeei.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
15<br>
Now there is provided a cosmetic composition of exceptionally pleasant aesthetics. The composition delivers a silky afterfeel to skin. The afterfeel aesthetics are achieved with a combination of tapioca starch and ethylene brassylate.<br>
20 Tapioca starch is a first component of the present invention. Tapioca, also known as Cassava or Manioc, is a root or tuber extract. The plant is a perennial that grows eight to twelve feet high and the roots can be as much as three feet long and five to ten inches in diameter. Cells of the tuber carry the tapioca starch. This starch is recovered by wet grinding the washed roots and continuous re-washing, resulting in a pure carbohydrate.<br>
25 Particularly preferred is a powder source with a median particle size ranging from 1 to 100 micron (1000 nm to 100,000 nm), preferably from 5 to 15 micron, optimally from 10 to 30 micron.<br>
The starch is commercially available under the tradename Tapioca Pure (28-1810) from 30      the National Starch &amp; Chemical Company, Division of ICI. An alternative source is TIStar Tapioca Starch sold by the Multi-Kern Corporation.<br>
Amounts of tapioca starch may range from 0.1 to 10%, preferably from 0.5 to 5%, optimally from 0.3 to 1 % by weight of the composition. 35<br><br>

10       EXAMPLE 15<br>
A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate skinfeel performance through instrumentation. Various combinations of tapioca starch and ethylene brassylate were evaluated for slip friction as a function of time. This procedure measures friction during the  first  ten   minutes  of drying  after  application.     The  test  is  conducted   in  an<br>
15 environmentally controlled chamber at 2TC and 20% relative humidity. Sample size of 100 microliters is spread on a Lucite table over a 6 by 5 inch area (2.54 cm to the inch). The table is attached to the cross-head of an Instron Model 4501  Materials Testing<br><br>
WO 2008/028900<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/059220<br><br>
System. A 3 by 1 inch aluminum sled covered with a 100% rayon non-woven is pulled across the same area at a rate of 10 cm/min, starting one minute after application and repeated each minute for ten minutes. The integral of force vs. a distance of 50 mm (i.e. amount of work, units of gram-mm) is calculated for each of the intervals. Three runs are 5     made of each product.<br>
Table VIII identifies the amounts of tapioca and ethylene brassylate for each sample in a base formula similar to that of example 1 (water varied in accordance with levels of tapioca starch, ethylene brassylate and com starch).  Slip friction results are reported in 10     table IX.<br>
TABLE VIII<br><br>
Sample	Tapioca (weight %)	Ethylene Brassylate (weight %)	Com Starch (weight %)<br>
A	0	2.0	0<br>
B	0.5	1.5	0<br>
C	2.0	0	0<br>
D	1.0	1.0	0<br>
E	1.5	0.5	0<br>
F	0	1.0	1.0<br>

B	743.8<br>
C	742.3<br>
D	662.9<br>
E	633.1<br>
F	728.5<br>
The results shown in table IX demonstrate that a combination of ethylene brassylate and tapioca starch (samples D and E) provide better slip results (lower friction) than either of 20 the separate materials (samples A and C). Further, the results of ethylene brassylate with tapioca are much better than the ethylene brassylate combination with corn starch. Compare sample C to sample F.<br><br>
