TITLE<br>
"Process for Improved D-spacing of Nanoclay."<br>
APPLICANT<br><br>
North Maharashtra University, Umavi Nagar, Jalgaon.<br>
The  following  specification  particularly describes  the  invention  and  the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
-2-"Process for Improved D-spacing of Nanoclay."<br>
Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for Improved D-spacing of Nanoclay.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Clay silicates like montomorillonite (MMT), hectonite, and bentonite have been used as reinforcing fillers for polymers because of their high aspect ratio. Out of these, the current preferred nano clay is montomorillonite. The crystal lattices consist of two-dimensional layers where a central octahedral sheet of either aluminum or magnesium is fused to two external silica of the tetrahedral sheet by their tips so that the oxygen ions of the octahedral sheet also belong to the tetrahedral sheet. The thickness of the layer is around 1 nm and the lateral dimension of these layer may vary from 300 angstroms to several microns or even larger, depending on the particular silicate. The layers are stacked by a weak dipole force and exhibit a net negative charge on the lamellar surface; the interlayer between the galleries are normally occupied by cations such as Na+ and Ca+. As the forces that hold the stacks together are relatively weak, the interaction of small molecules between the layers is easy.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Due to its hydrophobic nature, montomorillonite is not compatible with most of the polymers and must be chemically modified to make its surface more hydrophobic. Out of the different methods used, the most popular surface treatment uses organic ammonium cations, which can be exchanged with cations existing on clay surface.<br>
There are a few methods available for preparation of highly hydrophobic and dispersed clay. US Patent No. 7,081,491 describes a method for fabricating polybenzoxazole/clay nanocomposite materials. Similarly, US Patent 7,238,751 describes a method for preparation of multi¬layer nanoparticles and its applications. Patents WO2005095506, EP1801158, WO2005068365 all describe methods for preparation of nanoclays. However, in all processes existing so far, there are chances of agglomeration of the clay and hence the d-spacing may not be achieved. The lumps that are formed in the existing processes need to be crushed before use.<br>
The present invention therefore uses a method wherein metal cations of the interlayer can be exchanged with weak ammonium salt of short chains, thus producing treated clay with less ionic or polar surface. This modification of the surface of nano clay improves compatibilization between the surface of the nanoclay and the hydrophobic polymer matrix, and the chains of polymer thus penetrate more easily into<br><br>
-4-galleries due to increase in galleries spacing. The main advantage of the process described herein is that the modified nanoclay is obtained directly in powdered form. There is a significant reduction in the time required to carry out the entire process and there is no variation in the uniformity of the product.<br>
In spite of the wide use, commercial process holds many drawbacks. This technique usually requires very large amount of intercalent, and it is used rarely for improvement in d-spacing of nanoclay. This process produces nanoclay with improved d-spacing with a high purity and good yield at a very low cost.<br>
Compare to the prior art, there is need for developing a technique for improvement in d-spacing of nanoclay, wherein, the method could produces uniform improved d-spaced nanoclay. This technique provides surface modified nanoclay with a high purity and with good yield. The d-spacing obtained using this technique is approx 22-24 A0<br>
Object of Invention<br>
The main object of this invention is to develop a process for uniform improved D-spacing in between two plates of nanoclay.<br><br>
-5-Other object is to develop a process to produce High purity and cheaper nanoclay with improved chemical affinity with well dispersion in polymer matrix.<br>
Another object is to develop a process for producing nanoclay with high volume with a low cost and reproducible quality.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a simple, economic and rapid process for the preparation of highly dispersed nanoclay.<br>
Further object is to develop a process for improved D spacing of Nanoclay wherein a good hydrophobic surface is available.<br>
Other object is also to develop a method for manufacturing chemically modified nanoclay wherein metal cations of the interlayer are exchanged with weak ammonicem salt of short chains, thus producing treated clay with less on or polar surface, there by improving compatibilization between the surface of the nanoclay and the hydrophobic polymer matrixcaesing chains of polymers to penetrate more easily into galleries due to increase in galleries spacing.<br>
Another object is also to produce nanoclay with good hydrophobic surface to be used as extenders for promoting hiding power of paints,<br><br>

-9-With respect to figure 1, tank (9) contains clay slurry and tank (10) contains the intercalent solution of long or short chain amines. Both these solutions are allowed to pass through the membrane (4). The purpose of this membrane is for supporting and uniform flushing. These solutions pass through the membrane onto the resin column (3) and are allowed to react for 10 to 15 minutes so that there is uniform ion exchange between the clay and intercalent. After this process is complete, the slurry is collected into collector (5). This solution is now passed through the nylon filter mesh (7) to remove all impurities and water and collected into tank (8) and freeze dried with help of vacuum pump (6) to yield the modified organoclay.<br>
