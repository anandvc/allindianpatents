ANTENNA ARRANGEMENT WITH INTERLEAVED ANTENNA ELEMENTS<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to an antenna arrangement with<br>
interleaved antenna elements for multiple frequency band<br>
operation, especially for mobile communication systems, as<br>
defined in the preamble of claim 1, The invention also relates<br>
to an antenna system being adapted to communicate through a<br>
communication link with a base station.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Present antenna arrays used for transmitting and receiving RF<br>
(Radio Frequency) signals in mobile communication systems are<br>
normally dedicated to a single frequency band or sometimes two<br>
or more frequency bands. Single frequency band antennas have<br>
been used for a long time and normally include a number of<br>
antenna elements arranged in a vertical row. A second row of<br>
antenna elements needs to be,added beside the first row if the<br>
operator in a network wants to add another.frequency band<br>
using single frequency band antennas. However, this requires<br>
enough space to implement and the arrangement may also be<br>
sensitive to interference between the RF signals in the<br>
different frequency bands.<br>
These drawbacks have been partially resolved by prior art<br>
arrangements 10 which are schematically shown in figures 1A<br>
and IB.<br>
In figure 1A two types of antenna elements 11, 12 have been<br>
arranged alternatively in a column. A first antenna element 11<br>
is a dual band antenna element which operates in two different<br>
frequency bands F3X and F32, a second antenna element 12 is an<br>
antenna element which operates in only one frequency band FBi.<br><br>
2<br>
A drawback with this prior art embodiment is that the<br>
frequency bands FBi and FB2 will couple to each other due to<br>
the closeness of the parts making up the antenna element 11.<br>
Therefore, this kind of configuration is only suitable when<br>
the frequency bands have a big separation, for example if FB2<br>
is approximately twice the frequency as FBi_. If the frequency<br>
bands are too close, filters with high Q values, for example<br>
cavity filters which consume space and are relatively<br>
expensive and heavy, must be used very close to the antenna<br>
elements.<br>
The prior art arrangement shown in figure IB, as disclosed in<br>
US 6,211,841 (Nortel), is formed by an array including first<br>
antenna elements, 11a, which are positioned in two parallel<br>
columns 13a, 14a and operate in a first, lower frequency band,<br>
and second antenna elements 12a, which are alternately located<br>
in two adjacent columns 13a, 15a and operate in a second,<br>
higher frequency band. One of these adjacent columns (13a) is<br>
the same as one of the columns accommodating the first antenna<br>
elements 11a, whereas the other column 15a is located between<br>
the columns 13a, 14a. By locating the antenna elements 11a,<br>
12a in parallel, spaced apart columns side by side, it has<br>
been made possible to achieve the desired low coupling even<br>
between frequency bands which are relatively close to each<br>
other, namely up to a quotient of about 2/3.<br>
In US 6,844,863 B2 (Andrew Corporation), an arrangement with<br>
interleaved arrays of antenna elements is disclosed. Here, the<br>
various arrays deliberately couple to each other in a common<br>
frequency band.<br>
Accordingly there is a need for a new antenna arrangement that<br>
will operate in two or more frequency bands with a reduced<br>
coupling between the frequency bands without using filters<br><br>
3<br>
close to the elements or, if filters are needed, using filters<br>
with low Q values, such as micro strip or strip line filters,<br>
which are small in size and relatively cheap to implement.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
An object with the present invention is to provide a multiple<br>
frequency band antenna arrangement, and an antenna system,<br>
that will reduce the coupling between different frequency<br>
bands while at the same time minimizing the space needed<br>
compared to prior art antennas.<br>
The object is achieved for a multiple frequency band antenna<br>
arrangement which is connectable to a transceiver for<br>
transmitting and receiving RF signals in at least two separate<br>
frequency regions. The antenna arrangement has at least two<br>
sets of antenna elements arranged on a reflector. A first set<br>
of antenna elements is arranged in a column and operates in a<br>
first frequency region, whereas a second set of antenna<br>
elements is likewise arranged in a 'column and operates in a<br>
second frequency region. According to the present invention,<br>
the first and second sets of antenna elements are interleaved<br>
along and positioned on a straight line so as to form a single<br>
column, said first and second frequency regions including<br>
first and second frequency bands, respectively, which are<br>
separate and substantially non-overlapping but relatively<br>
close to each other, and the distance between adjacent antenna<br>
elements in said column, operating in different frequency<br>
bands, are substantially the same along said column and is<br>
smaller than the wavelength X of the centre frequency of the<br>
highest one of said first and second frequency bands.<br>
The object is also achieved by an antenna system being adapted<br>
to communicate through a communication link with a base<br>
station, wherein the antenna system comprises an antenna<br><br>
4<br>
arrangement, and means for controlling the phase and amplitude<br>
of transmitting signals and receiving signals to/from antenna<br>
elements in said antenna arrangement.<br>
An advantage with the present invention is that an isolation<br>
of more than 30 d3 between the frequency bands can be<br>
obtained, without the use of cavity filters even if the<br>
frequency bands are close to each ether.<br>
Another advantage with the present invention is that it is<br>
easy to configure an antenna having a desired selection of<br>
frequency bands.<br>
Still another advantage with the present invention is that the<br>
size of the antenna arrangement is maintained small compared<br>
to prior art arrangements.<br>
Further objects and advantages are obvious by a skilled person<br>
from the detailed description below.<br>

Detailed description of the preferred embodiments<br>
The prior art antenna arrangements shown in figures 1A and IB<br>
have been described above in the background to the invention.<br>
Figure 2A shows a schematic representation of a dual band<br>
antenna arrangement 20, according to the present invention,<br>
operating in two frequency regions including first and second<br>
frequency bands FBX and FB2 which are separate and<br><br>
6<br>
substantially non-overlapping but relatively close to each<br>
other. The antenna elements 21 (marked with continuous lines)<br>
operating in the lower frequency band FBi is of a first type<br>
and the antenna elements 22 (marked with dashed lines)<br>
operating in the higher frequency band FB2 is of a second type.<br>
The modified version of the dual band antenna arrangement 25,<br>
shown in figure 2B, is basically the same as the one shown in<br>
figure 2A, the only difference being that cross polarised<br>
antenna elements 26 are interleaved with linear y polarised<br>
antenna elements 27,<br>
In figure 2C there is illustrated how the two frequency bands<br>
are "substantially non-overlapping". The input reflection<br>
coefficient for the antenna elements 21 (figure 2A) in the<br>
lower frequency range is represented by the S-parameter Sa,<br>
whereas the input reflection coefficient for the antenna<br>
elements 22 in the higher frequency range is represented by<br>
the C-parameter S22- In practice, the reflection coefficient<br>
should be less than -15 dB (Rmax) • Moreover, the cross-coupling<br>
coefficient between the two frequency ranges should also be<br>
low, say less than -20 dB (Cmax) . By the use of these criteria,<br>
we can define the operative frequency bands FBi and FB2, as<br>
shown schematically in figure 2C. Thus, although the<br>
respective frequency does in fact overlap partially, the<br>
selected frequency bands FBi and FB2 are separate and distinct<br>
from each other.<br>
The first and second frequency bands should have centre<br>
frequencies being related as follows:<br>
2/3 
and typical examples of possible centre frequencies are<br>
fl = 850 MHz, f2 = 900 MHz;<br>
fl = 1800 MHz, f2 = 2000 MHz;<br><br>
7<br>
fl = 1900 MHz, f2 = 2100 MHz;<br>
fl = 2000 MHz, f2 = 2500 MHz.<br>
The antenna elements could be patches, dipoles, cross<br>
polarized antenna elements, dielectric resonator antennas<br>
(DRA) or any other type of antenna elements available to the<br>
skilled, person. The essential feature of the invention is that<br>
each antenna element operates in only one frequency band and<br>
that they are arranged on a reflector in an interleaved<br>
configuration along a straight line, in a single column, as<br>
illustrated in figure 2.<br>
Figures 3, 4 and 5 show different embodiments of the schematic<br>
representation in figure 2.<br>
Figure 3 shows a dual band antenna arrangement 30 having a<br>
first type of antenna elements 31 implemented as a- double<br>
patch antenna element transmitting and receiving within a<br>
lower frequency band FBi. A second type of antenna element 32<br>
is implemented as a patch antenna element transmitting and<br>
receiving within a higher frequency band FB2. An example of a<br>
lower frequency band could be 1710-2170 MHz and an example of<br>
a higher frequency band could be 2.5-2.7 GHz. Both types of<br>
antenna elements are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
An intermediate distance "x", between the centres of two<br>
adjacent antenna elements, is substantially the same for all<br>
antenna elements in the array, which for the frequency bands<br>
exemplified above is in the range 0.3-0.7 X {X = the wavelength<br>
of the centre frequency of the highest one of the two<br>
frequency bands) or 28-54 mm. A first distance "y", between<br>
antenna elements 31 that operate within the same frequency<br>
band, namely the lower frequency band, is in the range of a<br>
distance that corresponds to 0.5-0.9 lambda (X) of the centre<br><br>
8<br>
frequency of that (lower) frequency band. Likewise, a second<br>
distance "z", between antenna elements 32 that operate within<br>
the higher frequency band, is in the range cf a distance-that<br>
corresponds to 0.5-0.9 lambda (A.) of the centre frequency of<br>
that (higher) frequency band. The distance y may be different<br>
from the distance z, out since this will give rise to un-<br>
desired effects, it is preferred that the distance y is equal<br>
to z. As an example y and z are selected to be approx. 100 mm<br>
each.<br>
The embodiment described in connection with figure 3 contains<br>
types of antenna elements that are rather large and there may<br>
be a problem concerning the appearance of grating lobes that<br>
will occur when two antenna elements are placed too far from<br>
each other.<br>
This effect has been considered in the embodiments illustrated<br>
in figures 4 and 5.<br>
In figure 4, a perspective view of a second embodiment of a<br>
dual band antenna array 40 is shown. The dual band antenna<br>
array 40 contains two types of antenna elements, a first type<br>
41 for'the lower frequency band and a second type 42 for the<br>
higher frequency band. As an example, the first type of<br>
antenna elements 41 only receives RF signals within a range of<br>
1920-1980 MHz and the second type of antenna elements 42 only<br>
transmits RF signals within a range of 2110-2170 MHz, which<br>
leaves a suppressed frequency band of 130 MHz therebetween.<br>
Thereby a traditional antenna for the UMTS band is replaced by<br>
a dual band antenna with separate antenna elements for the Rx<br>
band and Tx band, respectively, so that simplified Tx and Rx<br>
radio chains can be realized.<br>
Both types 41 and 42 of antenna elements are made of a DRA<br>
(Dielectric Resonator Antenna) which are considerable smaller<br><br>
9<br>
than conventional patch antennas. The drawback with the DRA is<br>
that they might have a narrow bandwidth compared to other<br>
types cf antenna elements, but if used only for reception or<br>
transmission they will operate in a desired way. The size of<br>
the DRA compared to patches, as described in connection with<br>
figure 3, will minimize the appearance of grating lobes since<br>
the antenna elements can be placed closer together compared to<br>
the antenna elements described in connection with figure 2.<br>
In figure 5, a perspective view of a third embodiment of a<br>
dual band antenna array 50 is shown. The dual band antenna<br>
array 50 contains two types of antenna elements, a first type<br>
51 for the lower frequency band and a second type 52 for the<br>
higher frequency band. As an example, the first type of<br>
antenna elements 51 transmits and receives RF signals within a<br>
range of 1710-2170 MHz, which is similar to the antenna<br>
element 31 described in connection with figure 3. The second<br>
type of antenna elements 52 transmits and receives RF signals<br>
within a range of 2.5-2.7 GHz, which is the same frequency<br>
band as antenna element 32 (fig. 3) operated within.<br>
A difference between the previously described antenna element<br>
32 and the antenna element 52 is the type of antenna element<br>
being used. In the third embodiment described in connection<br>
with figure 5, a DRA is used as the second type of antenna<br>
element. Although the DRA might have a narrow bandwidth, the<br>
second antenna element will be sufficient to ensure proper<br>
operation. To reduce the coupling between adjacent antennas<br>
elements (and thereby lower the requirements/need of filters),<br>
a shielding wall 53 is provided between each antenna element<br>
51, 52, with the distances (x, y and z) maintained as<br>
described in connection with figure 3.<br><br>
10<br>
Dielectric Resonator Antennas (DRA) are preferably used for<br>
the higher frequency band due to the narrow bandwidth.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show an embodiment of a multi band antenna<br>
array 60 of the present invention including three different<br>
frequency bands. This embodiment includes three types of<br>
antenna elements, a first type 61 for a lower frequency band<br>
F3i a second type 62 for a middle frequency band FB2 and a<br>
third type 63 for a higher (or even lower) frequency band FB3.<br>
As examples, the following combinations of centre frequencies<br>
fl, f2, f3 are possible:<br>
fl	= 8 50 MHz,	f2 = 900 MHz,	f3	=	1800	MHz;<br>
fl	= 850 MHz,	f2 = 900 MHz,	f3	=	1900	MHz;<br>
fl	= -850 MHz,	f2 = 900 MHz,	f3	=	2000	MHz;<br>
fl	= 1800 MHz,	f2 = 2000 MHz,	f3	=	2500	MHz;<br>
fl	- 1800 MHz,	f2 = 2000 MHz,	f3	=	2500	MHz;<br>
fl	= 2000 MHz,	f2 = 2500 MHz,	f3	=	900	MHz.<br>
There are five patch antenna elements 61 with three square-<br>
shaped DRA 62 interleaved with the three of the lowest patch<br>
antenna elements 61, and three circular-shaped DRA 63<br>
interleaved with the three of the highest patch antenna<br>
elements 61. This results in a single column with eleven<br>
.interleaved antenna elements operating at three separate<br>
frequency bands. The presence of DRA makes it possible to<br>
include shielding walls 64 between each antenna element in the<br>
column to minimize the grating lobes.<br>
The distances between adjacent antenna elements are<br>
substantially the same as discussed in connection with figure<br>
3. An intermediate distance "x", between the centres of two<br>
adjacent antenna elements, is substantially the same for all<br>
antenna elements in the colum. A first distance "y", between<br>
two antenna elements 61 that operate within the lower<br><br>
11<br>
frequency band, is preferably a distance that corresponds to<br>
0.5-0.9 lambda of the centre frequency of the lower frequency<br>
band, i.e. 1940 MKz in this example. A second distance "z",<br>
between two antenna elements 62 that operate within the middle<br>
frequency band, is preferably a distance that corresponds to<br>
0.5-0.9 lambda of the centre frequency, i.e. 2.35 GHz in this<br>
example, of the middle frequency band. A third distance v,w'v,<br>
between two antenna elements 63 that operate within the higher<br>
frequency band, is preferably a distance that corresponds to<br>
0.5-0.9 lambda of the centre frequency, i.e. 2.6 GHz in this<br>
example, of the higher frequency band.<br>
The distances y, z and w may be differ somewhat from each<br>
other, but since this will give rise to undesired effects, it<br>
is preferred that the distances y, z and w are equal to each<br>
other.<br>
Figure 8 shows a block diagram illustrating the signal path in<br>
an antenna system 80 according to the present invention. The<br>
signal path can be divided into a transmission path Tx and a<br>
reception path Rx that are connected to a separate antenna<br>
element 81 and 82 for each path as illustrated in the drawing<br>
or a common antenna element (not shown).<br>
The reception path Rx comprises a band pass filter BPi to<br>
filter out the desired Radio frequency (RF) band connected in<br>
series with an optional low pass filter LP to remove spurious<br>
resonances before the filtered RF signal is fed into a Low<br>
Noise Amplifier LNA. The amplified RF signal is frequency<br>
shifted to an IF (Intermediate Frequency) signal using a Local<br>
Oscillator LO and a mixer 83. The IF signal is thereafter<br>
converted to a digital signal using an arrangement including<br>
an Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC).<br><br>
12<br>
There are three different arrangements shown in figure 8. The<br>
first option includes a Wideband A/D Converter W/ADC that<br>
converts the complete RF band into a digital stream of 16 s/c<br>
(samples/chip). The second option includes several single<br>
carrier A/D Converter SC/ADC that together converts the<br>
complete RF band into a digital stream of 16 s/c.<br>
The 16 s/c digital signal in the first and second option is<br>
thereafter fed into a digital filter DF and a Digital Down<br>
Converter DDC. The DDC converts the 16 s/c signal to a 7 s/c<br>
signal which is fed to a digital phase shifter DPS which<br>
receives control signals, preferably in digital form. The<br>
control signals are received from a connected base station<br>
(not shown) through a communication line, such as a fibre 85.<br>
DPS controls the phase cp and amplitude a of the digitized IF<br>
signal: The signal from the DPS is fed into a summation module<br>
84 together with signals from other optional antenna elements.<br>
The third option for converting the IF signal to a digitized<br>
signal include an analogue phase shifter APS, to which control<br>
signals, preferably in analogue form, are fed that are<br>
received from a connected base station (not shown) through a<br>
communication line, such as a fibre 85. APS controls the phase<br>
p and amplitude a of the IF signal which is digitized using a<br>
following Analogue-to-Digital Converter ADC which converts the<br>
signal into a digital stream of 16 s/c. The 16 s/c digital<br>
signal in the third option is thereafter fed into a digital<br>
filter DF and a Digital Down Converter DDC. The DDC converts<br>
the 16 s/c signal to a 7 s/c signal and is fed into the<br>
summation module 84 together with signals from other optional<br>
antenna elements.<br><br>
13<br>
Digital I and Q signals of 2 s/c are thereafter sent to the<br>
base station through the fibre 85. Communication through the<br>
fibre may use CPRI-standard communication protocols.<br>
The base station also supplies a digital I and Q signal of 1<br>
s/c for transmission to a splitter 86. The signal can be<br>
controlled in a digital or an analogue way, both being<br>
described in connection with figure 8.<br>
In a digital option the signal from the splitter 8 6 is fed to<br>
a Digital Phase Shifter DPS, which is supplied with digital<br>
control signals for controlling the phase cp and amplitude a of<br>
the transmission signal from .the base station through the<br>
fibre 85. The signal is then fed to a device 87 for Digital Up<br>
Conversion DUC, a Digital Predistortion PDP and Crest Factor<br>
Reduction CFR is thereafter connected to the digital<br>
transmission signal. The DUC converts the signal to 16 s/c<br>
from 7 s/c. The DPD is used to obtain a linear signal after<br>
the signal is amplified and CFR is used to limit the peak in<br>
the signal to optimize the performance of the amplifier AMP.<br>
The digital signal is thereafter processed in a<br>
Digital/Analogue Converter DAC to an IF transmission signal.<br>
In an analogue option the signal is fed to a device 87 for<br>
Digital Up Convertion DUC, a Digital Predistortion PDP and<br>
Crest Factor Reduction CFR is thereafter connected to the<br>
digital transmission signal. The digital signal is thereafter<br>
processed in a Digital/Analogue Converter DAC to an IF<br>
transmission signal, and is thereafter fed to an Analogue<br>
Phase Shifter APS, which is supplied with analogue control<br>
signals for controlling the phase cp and amplitude a. of the<br>
transmission signal from the base station through the fibre<br>
85.<br><br>
14<br>
The signal is then frequency shifted to a RF transmission<br>
signal using a local oscillator LO and a mixer 88. The. RF<br>
transmission signal is amplified in' an amplifier AM? with a<br>
following optional filter F. A band pass filter BF2 completes<br>
the transmission path, where the desired radio frequency band<br>
is selected before transmission via the antenna element 82.<br>
The RF signal is sensed before the band pass filter 3F2 and<br>
frequency shifted to an IF feedback signal using a local<br>
oscillator LO and a mixer 89. The IF feedback signal is<br>
converted to a digital signal, using a Digital-to-Analogue<br>
Converter DAC, and fed into the DPD in the device 87. The same<br>
local oscillator LO is used for the transmission path.<br>
In the,example, different antenna elements 81, 82 are used for<br>
transmission and reception of the signals, but naturally a<br>
common'antenna element may be used for both transmission and<br>
reception.<br>
Figure 9 shows a schematic representation of a second<br>
embodiment of a multi band antenna array 110 including<br>
additional filters LP, BP, and HP to provide a better<br>
isolation between the operating frequency bands FBi, FB2, and<br>
FB3 for the antenna arrangement.<br>
The antenna arrangement 110 comprises two types of antenna<br>
elements, where a first antenna element 111 is a dual band<br>
antenna element receiving RF signals in a first frequency band<br>
FBi, and transmitting RF signals in a second frequency band<br>
FB2. The RF signals received in the first frequency band FBi is<br>
fed to a low pass filter LP, or a band pass filter for low<br>
frequencies, and thereafter to a first transceiver circuit Tl.<br>
Transmitting RF signals from the first transceiver circuit Tl<br>
are fed to a band pass filter 3P and thereafter to the dual<br>
band antenna element 111.<br><br>
15<br>
The second type of antenna element 112 is operating within a<br>
third, higher frequency band FB3, i.e. both receiving and<br>
transmitting RF signals within FB3. RF signals to/from the<br>
antenna element 112 is fed through a high pass filter HP, or a<br>
band pass filter for high frequencies, to/from a second<br>
transceiver circuit 72 . Transceiver circuits Tl and T2 are<br>
connected to a base station BS (not shown).<br>
Suppression means in the form of metallic strips 113 are<br>
arranged between each antenna element 111, 112,. to shield the<br>
antenna elements from each other. Each metallic strip is<br>
fastened to the reflector 114 in an isolating way, e.g. using<br>
a dielectric material disposed therebetween. The filters will<br>
provide an increased isolation of more than 30 dB, whereas the<br>
construction in itself may only give an isolation of 15-20 dB.<br>
Only one filter is provided for all antenna elements operating<br>
within a frequency band in this embodiment, and in figure 14<br>
another embodiment is illustrated wherein a separate filter is<br>
used for each antenna element.<br>
Figure 10 shows a schematic representation of a third<br>
embodiment of a multi band antenna arrangement 115, comprising<br>
three types of DRA antenna elements 116, 117, and 118. These<br>
elements are interleaved in such a way that two antenna<br>
elements of different type are arranged between two antenna<br>
elements of the same type. The distances y, z, and w are<br>
preferably the same as described in connection with figure 6<br>
and the distances x between adjacent antenna element 116, 117<br>
and 118 is preferably equal to each other.<br>
A suitable means to further increase the isolation between the<br>
frequency bands in a multi-band antenna is illustrated in<br>
figure 11. The figure shows a communication system 100 having<br>
a dual band antenna arrangement 101, such as any of those<br><br>
16<br>
illustrated in connection with figures 2A, 2B, 3, 4, and 5,<br>
with a low pass filter, (or band pass filter), L? between each<br>
antenna element 102 operating in the low frequency band and<br>
the transceiver circuitry Tl for the low frequency band, and a<br>
high pass filter, (or band pass filter), HP between each<br>
antenna element 10 3 operating in the high frequency band and<br>
the transceiver circuitry T2 for the high frequency band. Each<br>
transceiver circuitry Tl, T2 is illustrated in connection with<br>
figure 8 and is connected to a base station BS, which is<br>
connected to the PSTN as is well-known to a person skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
The antenna system. 100 also includes a device for Remote<br>
Electrical Tilt RET, which is controlled by the base station<br>
BS. RET controls an actuator 104 that will change the<br>
electrical tilt of the lobes from the antenna 101, as is well-<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
If the antenna arrangement 101 includes an antenna arrangement<br>
with more than two frequency bands, such as the embodiment<br>
shown in figures 6, 7, and 13, then each antenna element<br>
operating at an intermediate frequency band is provided with a<br>
band pass filter to increase the isolation to the lower and<br>
higher frequency bands. The filters will provide an increased<br>
isolation of more than 30 dB, whereas the construction in it<br>
self may only give an isolation of 15-20 dB.<br>
The feeding of the antenna elements may include probe feeding,<br>
aperture feeding for all types of contemplated antenna<br>
elements, such as Patch antennas, DRA, Dipole antennas, cross<br>
polarized antennas.<br><br>
