COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"FITTING STRUCTURE OF STEERING HANDLE AND ACCESSORY IN<br>
MOTORCYCLE"	<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains]<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement in the fitting structure of a steering handle and an accessory in a motorcycle, in which the steering handle and the accessory such as a speed meter disposed on the front side of the steering handle are fitted to an upper end portion of a steering stem of a front fork steerably supported by a head pipe.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In such a fitting structure in the prior art, as disclosed for example in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 10-29585, a fitting substrate is fixed to the upper end of a steering stem supported by the head pipe, and a bar-type steering handle—and- a speed meter—are- fitted to a left-right pair of handle holders provided on the fitting substrate.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br><br>
Meanwhile, in order to enhance the visual recognizability for the driver of the accessory such as a speed meter disposed on the immediate front side of the steering handle, it is desirable that the accessory is disposed as close as possible to the driver.  In the conventional structure, however, the accessory cannot be disposed sufficiently close to the driver because it is spatially blocked by the steering handle.<br>
[0004]<br>
The present invention has been made in consideration of the above circumstances. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a fitting structure of a steering handle and an accessory in a motorcycle in which the accessory such as a speed meter can be disposed sufficiently close to the driver without being spatially blocked by the steering handle.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the above object, the present invention is characterized firstly in that a left-right pair of handle posts so bent as to direct their tips rearwards are provided in connection with the upper end of a steering stem of a front fork steerably supported by a head pipe, a bar-type steering handle is fitted to the<br><br>
tips of the handle posts, and an accessory turned together with the steering handle is disposed between the handle posts in proximity to a front surface of the steering handle.<br>
[0006]<br>
According to the first characteristic feature, the steering handle is supported by the tips of the left-right pair of handle posts bent rearwards, so that it is set off to the rear  side from the axis of the handle stem. Therefore, the accessory disposed between the handle posts in proximity to the front surface of the steering handle can be disposed close to the driver together with a support portion of the steering handle, whereby it is possible to contrive enhancement of the visual recognizability of the accessory for the driver.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to a second characteristic feature of the present invention, in addition to the first characteristic feature, the accessory is disposed roughly on the axis of the steering stem. Therefore, even at the time of a steering operation of the steering handle, displacement of the accessory from the axis of the steering stem is little, so that the visual recognizability of the accessory is further enhanced.<br><br>
[0008]<br>
Further, the present invention is characterized thirdly in that, in addition to the first or second characteristic feature, a windscreen turned together with the steering handle is disposed on the immediate front side of the accessory.<br>
[0009]<br>
According to the third characteristic feature, by the rearward  displacement  of   the  steering handle as mentioned above, the windscreen can be easily disposed in a condition of forwardly downward inclination in continuity with a front surface of a front cover, without being interfered with by the steering handle, so that a reduction in air resistance during running and enhancement of appearance can be contrived.<br>
[0010]<br>
The above-mentioned accessory corresponds to a speed meter 24 in an embodiment of the present invention which will be described later.<br>
[0011]<br>
[Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
A mode for carrying out the present invention will be described below based on one embodiment of the present invention shown in the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
[Brief Description of the Drawings] [FIG. 1]<br>

[0012]<br>
FIG. 1 is a side view of a motorcycle having a structure according to the present invention, FIG. 2 is a plan view of the motorcycle, FIG. 3 is a plan view of the motorcycle, FIG. 4 is a perspective view as viewed from the rear side of the motorcycle, FIG. 5 is an enlarged vertical sectional view taken along line 5-5 of FIG. 1, FIG. 6 is a view taken along arrow 6 of FIG. 5, FIG. 7 is a sectional view taken along line 7-7 of FIG. 3, and FIG. 8 is an enlarged view of portion 8 of FIG. 1.<br>
[0013]<br>
First, in Figs. 1 to 4, a motor scooter type motorcycle 1 includes a body frame 2 having integrally a head pipe 2a at the front end thereof, and a steering stem 3a of a front fork 3 for shaft-supporting a front wheel 4f is steerably supported by the head pipe 2a. A power unit 5 integrally unitizing an engine and a transmission is vertically swingably fitted to an intermediate portion of the body frame 2 through a turnable shaft (not shown), and a rear wheel 4r driven by the transmission is supported on a rear end portion of the power unit 5.<br>
[0014]<br>
A step floor 6 which is disposed on the rear side<br><br>
of a lower portion of the head pipe 2a and a seat 7 which is disposed on the rear side of the step floor 6 and on the upper side of the power unit 5 are fitted to the body frame 2.<br>
[0015]<br>
A leg shield 8 for covering the head pipe 2a and an upper portion of the front fork 3 from the rear side is provided in connection with the front end of the step floor 6, and a front cover 9 inclined forwardly downwards for covering the head pipe 2a and the upper portion of the front fork 3 from the front side is connected to the leg shield 8. Lower portions of the leg shield 8 and the front cover 9 constitute a front fender 10 for covering an upper portion of the front wheel 4f.<br>
[0016]<br>
An engine cover 12 rising toward the periphery of a bottom surface of the seat 7 and covering an engine portion (not shown) of the power unit 5 is provided in connection with the rear end of the step floor 6, and a rear cover 13 functioning also as a rear fender for covering an upper portion of the rear wheel 4r is provided in connection with the rear end of the engine cover 12.<br>
[0017]<br><br>
As clearly shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, a communication tube 16 of a fitting substrate 15 fitted to the outer circumference of an upper end portion of the steering stem 3a projected to the upper side of the head pipe 2a is fixed to the upper end portion by a bolt 17. A pair of handle posts 18, 18 arranged on the left and right sides with the axis A of the steering stem 3a therebetween are integrally erected on the fitting substrate 15, and the handle posts 18, 18 are so bent as to direct their tips rearwards. The handle posts 18, 18 are integrally provided with handle holders 19, 19 at the tips thereof, and a bar-type steering handle 22 arranged bridgingly between the handle holders 19, 19 is clamped and fixed by the handle holders 19, 19 and holder caps 20, 20 connected to the handle holders 19, 19 by bolts 21.<br>
[0018]<br>
A speed meter 24 is fitted to an upper surface of the fitting substrate 15 through a support tube 23.  In this case, the speed meter 24 is disposed between the left and right handle posts 18, 18 so as to be proximate to a front surface of the steering handle 22, and desirably disposed roughly on the axis A of the steering stem 3a.<br>
[0019]<br><br>
Since the steering handle 22 is supported by the tips of the left-right pair of handle posts 18, 18 bent rearwards, a support portion of the handle 22 is set off to the rear side from the axis A of the handle stem 3a. Therefore, the speed meter 24 disposed in proximity to the front surface of the steering handle 22 between the handle posts 18, 18 can be disposed close to the driver of the motorcycle 1 together with the support portion of the steering handle 22, whereby the visual recognizability of the speed meter 24 for the driver is enhanced. Particularly, where the speed meter 24 is disposed on the axis A of the steering stem 3a, displacement of the speed meter 24 from the axis A of the steering stem 3a is little even at the time of steering of the steering handle 22, so that the visual recognizability of the speed meter 24 is further enhanced. [0020]<br>
A left-right pair of stays 26, 26 projecting skewly forwards by penetrating through a downward circumferential wall 15a formed at the circumference of the fitting substrate 15 are fixed to a lower surface of the fitting substrate 15, and a windscreen 25 is clamped and fixed by screen holders 27, 27 provided at the tips of the stays 26, 26 and clamp members 28, 28 connected to<br><br>
the screen holders 27, 27 by bolts 29. The windscreen 25 is continuous with a front surface of the front cover 9 and is so formed as to cover the fitting substrate 15, the speed meter 24 and a central portion of the steering handle 22 from the front side.<br>
[0021]<br>
By the above-mentioned rearward offset of the support portion of the steering handle 22, the windscreen 25 can be easily disposed in a condition of forwardly downward inclination in continuity with the front surface of the front cover 9 without being interfered with by the steering handle 22, whereby a reduction in air resistance during running can be contrived, and good appearance can be obtained.<br>
[0022]<br>
In FIGS. 3, 6 and 7, a head lamp 30 is fitted at a central portion of the front cover 9, and a lens of the head lamp 30 is formed in continuity with the front surface of the front cover 9.<br>
[0023]<br>
Both left and right side portions of the front surface of the front cover 9 are bent rearwards, and a left-right pair of front winker lamps 31, 31 rising from both left and right side portions of the head lamp 30 are<br><br>
fitted to the left and right side portions of the front surface of the front cover 9. Namely, as shown in FIG. 7, a lamp case 31a for containing and holding a bulb 31c of each front winker lamp 30 is fixed by a small screw 39 to a boss 38 projected on a rear surface of the front cover 9, a lens 31b adjoined to a front surface of the lamp case 31a is in continuity with the front surface of the front cover 9, has an upper end portion extended to the upper edge of the front cover 9 (See FIG. 6), exposed in both left and right outside directions of the windscreen 25, and contained in the front visual field of the driver.<br>
[0024]<br>
Each lens 31b is formed in a vertically elongate form with left-right width reduced toward the upper side, and its inside surface is provided with a multiplicity of longitudinal streaks extending in the vertical direction.<br>
[0025]<br>
When the bulb 31c of the front winker lamp 31 is made to blink, light is intermittently emitted also at an upper end portion of the lens 31a located at the upper end of the front cover 9, so that the driver can directly look at this and confirm the operating conditions. Therefore, it is possible to find a misoperation or bulb failure without depending on a special blink indicator,<br><br>
so that the blink indicator is unnecessitated, and a reduction in cost can be contrived. [0026]<br>
Particularly, since the lens 31b is formed in a vertically elongate form with left-right width reduced toward the upper side, at the time of blinking of the bulb 31c, the lens 31b functions to condense light upwards and the upward light condensation is promoted by the multiplicity of longitudinal streaks on the inside surface of the lens 31b, whereby visual recognizability of the blinking of the bulb 31c for the driver is further enhanced. [0027]<br>
Naturally, since the lens 31b is roughly in continuity with the front surface of the front cover 9, the structure can contribute to a reduction in air resistance during steering and enhancement of appearance, in the same manner as in the conventional structure. [0028]<br>
In Figs. 1 and 2, a cavity is formed between the front cover 9 and the leg shield 8, and a left-right pair of long thing containers 33, 33 inclined forwardly downwards and opening at an upper portion of the leg shield 8 are provided by utilizing the cavity. Lids 32<br><br>
for opening and closing the inlets of the long thing containers 33, 33 are fitted to the leg shield 8. [0029]<br>
Again in Figs. 1, 2 and 4, a luggage box 34 is formed in the inside of the rear cover 13, and a luggage box lid 35 for closing an upper opening surface of the luggage box 34 is rearwardly openably hinged to the rear end of an upper portion of the rear cover 13.  The luggage box lid 35 is formed with a forwardly upward inclination with a central portion in the left-right direction curved upwards. By this, a large effective volume of the luggage box 34 is secured, and a large-type luggage such as a helmet H can be contained in the luggage box 34. [0030]<br>
A seat back 36 disposed to rise from a rear end portion of the seat 7 is fitted to the front end of the luggage box lid 35. Namely, the luggage box lid 35 functions also as a support member for the seat back 36. [0031]<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a side wall of the engine cover 12 is provided with heat-discharging louvers 37, 37, and the heat inside the engine cover 12 is drawn out through the louvers 37, 37 by a running wind flowing on the outside surface of the engine cover 12.<br><br>
[0032]<br>
As shown in Figs. 1, 4 and 8, a pair of rear winker lamps 40, 40 are fitted to both left and right side portions of a rear wall of the rear cover 13, and lenses 40a, 40a of the rear winker lamps 40, 40 are in continuity with an outside surface of the rear cover 13. A tail lamp 41 is fitted to a lower portion of the rear end of the rear cover 13, and a lens 41a of the lamp 41 is disposed at a position deviated to the front side by a predetermined distance S from the rear end of the rear cover 13. With this arrangement, even when the rear cover 13 collides against an obstacle 42 on the rear side, the tail lamp 41 can be prevented from colliding with the obstacle 42 and be prevented from being damaged.<br>
[0033]<br>
The present invention is not limited to or by the above embodiment, and various design modifications are possible within the gist of the invention.<br>
[0034]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
As has been described above, according to the first characteristic feature of the present invention, the left-right pair of handle posts so bent as to direct their tips rearwards are provided in connection with the<br><br>
upper end of the steering stem of the front fork steerably supported by the head pipe, the bar-type steering handle is fitted to the tips of the handle posts, and the accessory turned together with the steering handle is disposed between the handle posts in proximity to the front surface of the steering handle. Therefore, by the rearward bend of the handle posts, the steering handle is set off to the rear side from the axis of the handle stem, and the accessory disposed between the handle posts is disposed close to the front surface of the steering handle, whereby the accessory can be disposed close to the driver together with the support portion of the steering handle, which can contribute to enhancement of the visual recognizability of the accessory for the driver.<br>
[0035]<br>
In addition to the first characteristic feature, the present invention is characterized in that the accessory is disposed roughly on the axis of the steering stem. Therefore, even at the time of steering of the steering handle, displacement of the accessory from the axis of the steering stem is little, so that the visual recognizability of the accessory is further enhanced.<br>
[0036]<br><br>
Further, according to the third characteristic feature, in addition to the first or second characteristic feature, the windscreen turned together with the steering handle is disposed on the immediate front side of the accessory.  Therefore, by the above-mentioned rearward displacement of the steering handle, the windscreen can be easily disposed in the condition of forwardly downward inclination in continuity with the front surface of the front cover without being interfered with by the steering handle, whereby a reduction in air resistance during running and enhancement of appearance can be contrived.<br><br>
