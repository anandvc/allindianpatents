				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to telecommunication networks and in<br>
particular to resource allocation in such networks.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A general concern in telecommunication networks of today is how to allocate<br>
resources, such as transmit power and frequency, in an appropriate manner. The<br>
resources are limited and as the number of links and subscribers continuously<br>
increases, the network complexity is increased, whereby more sophisticated<br>
solutions are needed. Typically, efficient resource utilization and reliable<br>
transmissions are aimed at.<br>
Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) are<br>
widely used in data transmission to keep the transmission quality. ARQ<br>
retransmits the data blocks when a NACK feedback is received to indicate an<br>
incorrect receiving. The receiver discards the failed blocks immediately. The<br>
principle of HARQ is instead to buffer the data blocks that were not received<br>
correctly and combine the buffered data with retransmissions. The soft combining<br>
procedure normally depends on which type of HARQ combining scheme that is<br>
used, e.g. Chase combining (HARQ-CC) or Incremental Redundancy (HARQ-IR) [1].<br>
Existing solutions like the above-mentioned ARQ/HARQ mechanisms are<br>
associated with a number of problems. ARQ/HARQ tries to keep the transmission<br>
quality, but cannot guarantee successful transmissions. Even with the maximum<br>
number of retransmissions, the block may not be received correctly in a bad<br>
transmission environment. A higher limit of the maximum retransmission times<br>
will increase the transmission reliability, but will require larger buffer size and<br>
cause longer transmission delay.<br>
To reach higher transmission efficiency, some studies have been done on<br>
HARQ/Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) scheduling based on channel<br>
prediction [2]. The main concern of HARQ/AMC is to adapt or counteract the<br>
2<br><br>
uncertainty of wireless channel variation and the most common measure is using<br>
the required average signal-to-noise ration as the metric. HARQ/AMC requires<br>
exhaustive simulation of all possible channel variations, which is a formidable task.<br>
Accordingly, the handling of resources during transmission in conventional tele-<br>
communication systems is far from satisfactory and there is a considerable need for<br>
an improved resource allocation mechanism.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A general object of the present invention is to achieve improved handling of<br>
resources in wireless telecommunication networks. A specific object is to ensure<br>
transmission reliability and transmission efficiency. Another object is to reduce the<br>
resource waste in the networks. Still another object is to provide an improved<br>
resource allocation mechanism suitable for use with ARQ/HARQ.<br>
These objects are achieved in accordance with the attached claims.<br>
Briefly, the present invention proposes a new method of adapting resource<br>
allocation parameters to reach one or more quality targets with improved accuracy.<br>
New quality indicators based on the so-called mutual information (MI), preferably<br>
at block-level, are introduced in the resource allocation. The Mi-based quality<br>
indicators of a previous transmission, the channel prediction of a subsequent<br>
transmission and optionally one or more additional quality requirements, are used<br>
to determine the amount and type of resources, e.g. time, frequency and power<br>
resources, that are to be used for the subsequent transmission. The resource<br>
allocation preferably comprises power allocation and/or link adaptation. The latter<br>
can for example include adaptive selection of modulation-mode, coding rate,<br>
and/or source data rate based on the channel conditions. It also includes channel<br>
allocation among a plurality of users. In particular, the invention enables an<br>
advantageous implementation where link-adaptation and power allocation are<br>
performed simultaneously based on the same measurement. The proposed method<br>
is very useful in connection with ARQ/HARQ retransmissions.<br>
3<br><br>
According to other aspects of the invention a communication unit and a<br>
communication system with means for resource allocation are provided.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
A list of abbreviations follows at the end of this section.<br>
The present invention involves defining new information measurements and<br>
parameters based on which resource allocation (such as power allocation or link<br>
adaptation) to communication links in telecommunication networks is performed.<br>
Before the invention and example embodiments are described in detail, some<br>
underlying concepts and definitions will be explained in order to understand the<br>
principles thereof.<br>
New link-to-system interface and information parameters<br>
The present invention is based on the recognition of a new, improved link-to-<br>
system (L2S) interface, also referred to as a quality model, which gives practically<br>
optimal resource allocation rules/requirements (with or without ARQ / HARQ)<br>
provided that good channel estimations/predictions and measurements can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic block diagram illustrating an example embodiment of such a<br>
quality model in accordance with the invention. The quality model 100 describes<br>
the mapping relationship between link information measurements 11 (SIR in Fig. 1)<br>
and the final quality indicators or estimations (BLER and FI in Fig. 1). It comprises<br>
a modulation model 12 and a coding model 13, respectively. As will be further<br>
described below, a very advantageous feature of the proposed quality model 100 is<br>
that it presents a linear interface between the modulation model 12 and the coding<br>
model 13.<br>
The quality of service requirement can be expressed by different quality indicators:<br>
BLER (block error rate), throughput, delay, as well as through one or more new<br>
indicators defined in accordance with the invention. These indicators can be<br>
obtained by statistics or based on link information measurements, such as SIR and<br>
5<br><br>
rawBER, and play an important role in the resource allocation procedure of the<br>
invention. The new quality indicators will be derived in the section "Block-level<br>
mutual information" below but first the mutual information concept, on which the<br>
indicators are based, will be explained at symbol-level.<br>
Symbol-level mutual information<br>
Seen from the decoder, the information from the source is carried by the soft<br>
outputs of the demodulator. A classical information value from information theory<br>
is the so-called mutual information (MI) between channel input and output, i.e.<br>
between encoder-output bit and decoder-input soft bit. The channel coding<br>
theorem states that an ideal codec (i.e. coder/decoder system) is capable of<br>
transmitting reliably at a coding rate equal to the mutual information of the<br>
channel [3]. The information measure based on the channel capacity can be<br>
expressed as the modulated symbol-level mutual information (SI) value. With y}<br>
representing the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) at time j, i.e.<br><br>
, where the modulated symbol X belongs to a certain modulation constellation, and<br>
the received symbol Y = (YRH*YI) e C, where C is the set of complex numbers [4]. In<br>
Equation (2), P(X) is the a-priori probability of X.  P(Y\X,γ) is the probability<br>
density function of Y conditioned on transmit symbol X and parameterized by<br>
channel state γ1<br>
6<br><br>
There are also approximations of the symbol information that can sometimes be<br>
used instead of Equation (2). For example, based on the Union Chernoff bound for<br>
coded transmission, the exponential effective SIR mapping (EESM) information<br>
expression for a M-symbol modulation:<br><br>
where ym is the modulation adjusting factor for a given constellation.<br>
Other approximate mutual information expressions can for instance be based on<br>
the BPSK cutoff rate:<br><br>
There can also be still other approximate expressions, such as<br>
or on the unified Shannon information theory, i.e. the AWGN capacity with real<br>
Gaussian inputs:<br><br><br>
where {a,β} is the modulation compensation exponent for a given constellation.<br>
With good training, (6) gives a very good match.<br>
Block-level mutual information<br>
The behavior of a certain codec can be expressed as the mutual information per<br>
coding block.<br>
For a (N, K) coding block, where K denotes the number of information bits and N<br>
denotes the number of coded bits within one coding block, which corresponds to J<br>
modulated symbols, the channel capacity is the cumulation of the SI:s within the<br>
7<br><br>
block. Assuming that the received coding block experiences multiple channel states<br>
{yl,y2,...,yJ}the mutual information is, in accordance with the present invention,<br>
further defined at different levels as the following quality indicators:<br>
For an M-order modulation, I(Y,) 
- Received coded block information (RBI):<br><br><br>
where RSI denotes received slot information, SI is the symbol information, i.e. /,<br>
and S is the number of symbols in one slot.<br>
RBI is the total received encoded-bits (rawbit) information before decoding.<br>
- Received coded block information rate (RBIR), i.e. normalized RBI:<br><br>
-	Block error rate (BLER) i.e. the ratio of the number of the error blocks over the<br>
total number of the transmitted blocks.<br>
-	Frame information (FI):<br><br>
FI is the received decoded bit information within one coding block and can be<br>
interpreted as the quantized throughput, i.e. the number of correctly received<br>
bits per coding block.<br>
- Block success rate (BSR), i.e. normalized FI:<br>
8<br><br><br>
, where Rjnfobits is the transmission rate of the information bits, and Tcodlngblock<br>
is the period of one coding block.<br>
Mutual-information based quality indicators like RBI, RBIR, FI and BSR represent<br>
the quality of service and can be used to express transmission<br>
requirements/constraints, for example FItarget or RBItarget- By comparing the target<br>
with the corresponding measured values, e.g. FImeasurement or RBImeasurement, it can be<br>
determined whether the requirement is satisfied. The indicators based on mutual<br>
information are independent of channel pattern and variation, which makes them<br>
easier to use than conventional QoS parameters when it comes to resource<br>
allocation.<br>
It should be noted that other mutual-information based quality indicators, such as<br>
other types of normalized FI and RBI parameters, for instance, also lie within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
Modulation model by mutual information<br>
The modulation model (12 in Fig. 1) deals with the symbol-level mutual information<br>
SI for different modulation constellations.<br>
According to Shannon information theory [5], the channel capacity for an AWGN<br>
channel without bandwidth limit is:<br><br>
For digital modulation the mutual information SI denotes the capacity of a discrete-<br>
input and continuous-output channel. The capacity of an M-order constellation<br>
9<br><br>
cannot be higher than log2M, but it can be quite close to Shannon channel capacity<br>
at very low SIR values in case of a perfect knowledge of γ1- In addition, given a<br>
channel state γ1, SI is larger for a higher-order modulation in case of a perfect<br>
knowledge of the channel. However, it can be expected in case of imperfect channel<br>
estimation that the information content will be limited by the estimation of γ1.<br>
Coding model by mutual information<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the coding model 13 for a multi- state channel includes<br>
functionality for symbol information combining 14 and quality mapping 15.<br>
The quality model 100 for a multi-state channel can for instance be implemented<br>
through look-up tables of mutual information and include the following steps:<br>
[1] For a set of soft outputs of the demodulator with the multiple channel states<br>
{γ1, γ2,.-.,γ3}, {SI, Sl2, ..., Slγ} are calculated by checking the look-up table of<br>
mutual information for a certain constellation, as described by the above<br>
modulation model 12.<br>
[2] Select the look-up tables for a codec. The tables are generated based on AWGN<br>
simulation results, which should not depend on modulation mode. For<br>
example, the look-up tables of RBI to FI and RBIR to BLER can be selected.<br>
[3] Collect RBI or RBIR by (7) or (8). This functionality is in Fig. 1 performed at<br>
unit 14. To simulate the codec behavior in case of non-optimal decoding<br>
algorithm, a modification is needed in (7) by introducing a correctness for RBI,<br>
in the form of a RBI adjusting factor RBIood, as follows:<br><br><br>
[4]   Get  the  quality  indicators  by  checking  the  AWGN  look-up  tables.   This<br>
functionality is in Fig. 1 represented by unit 15.<br>
The introduction of a block-level mutual-information based parameter like RBI (or<br>
RBIR) in the L2S interface enables having separate modulation and coding models,<br>
respectively, and the interface between the modulation model 12 and the coding<br>
model 13 is linear. The linear interface feature makes it comparatively<br>
straightforward to access the estimations of different quality indicators based on<br>
the link information measurements.<br>
The above-described quality model proposed in accordance with the present<br>
invention is associated with the advantage of being more accurate than<br>
corresponding L2S interfaces in the prior art.<br>
A new resource allocation procedure<br>
In accordance with the present invention, it is suggested to use rich feedback of the<br>
above-described kind, which carries the channel condition information and the<br>
transmission information requirement, to achieve an improved resource allocation<br>
procedure. The resource allocation preferably comprises power allocation (power<br>
control) and/or link adaptation. Basically, MI-based quality indicators of a previous<br>
(current) transmission, the channel prediction of a subsequent transmission ("the<br>
next try" in case the invention is used for retransmission improvements) and<br>
generally also one or more quality requirements, are used to determine how much<br>
resources, including time, frequency and power resources, that should be used for<br>
the subsequent transmission ("the second try").<br>
Thus, the present invention introduces new quality measures in the resource<br>
allocation, whereas resource allocation in the prior art is based on conventional<br>
measurements, e.g. SIR or BLER. As will be evident in the following, the new MI-<br>
based indicators are associated with some advantageous features, enabling a more<br>
reliable and efficient packet transmission over communication links.<br>
For the purpose of this disclosure resource allocation refers to<br>
allocation/distribution/setting/control of resources such as transmit power or<br>
11<br><br>
link-defining resources (e.g. related to frequency or time) to a communication link.<br>
Allocation of link-defining or link-related resources for example includes adaptive<br>
selection of modulation-mode, coding rate, and/or source data rate based on the<br>
channel conditions. It also includes channel allocation in the frequency domain,<br>
time domain, spatial domain and/or code domain. Allocation of link-defining<br>
resources will hereafter generally be referred to as link adaptation.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a communication (sub) system 200 in which the present invention<br>
can be used. A base station 21 communicating with mobile nodes 22 (user<br>
equipment, mobile stations, etc) over respective communication links 23 is<br>
illustrated. The invention is particularly advantageous for (although not limited to)<br>
packet-based communication over wireless links and addresses situations where a<br>
transmitting unit transmits or tries to transmit a signal to a receiving unit over a<br>
communication link. The receiving unit monitors the link and based on measured<br>
link information, it is determined how to allocate resources to the link. Generally,<br>
all participating units 21, 22 are transceivers, comprising both receiving and<br>
transmitting functionality. For the purpose of the invention the "receiving" or<br>
"transmitting* unit may be a base station 21, a mobile node 22, or any other<br>
suitable communication node/unit.<br>
Fig. 3 is a flow chart of a method for allocating resources in accordance with an<br>
example embodiment of the present invention. In a first step SI, a signal is sent<br>
from a transmitting unit to a receiving unit over a communication link. A current<br>
value of a quality indicator/link measure (e.g. FI, RBI) for the signal is determined<br>
based on a mutual information relationship/formula (step S2). For this, an<br>
information-based quality model can be used which simplifies the modulation<br>
mode selection and coding rate adaptation, by allowing modulation mode selection<br>
and coding rate adaptation to be performed separately. The quality indicator is a<br>
parameter (directly or indirectly) representative of the block-level mutual information<br>
of the signal. It can for example represent the total coded bit information of a<br>
received block, such as RBI or RBIR, or represent the total decoded bit information<br>
of a received block, such as FI or BSR. Link information (e.g. SIR) of the signal<br>
measured at the receiving unit is preferably used as input in the step of<br>
determining the quality indicator.<br>
12<br><br>
The step of determining the quality indicator preferably comprises modeling mutual<br>
information parameters at symbol-level using a modulation model with a<br>
representation of the signal-to-interference ratio as input, and combining the<br>
mutual information parameters into block-level mutual information. This coded<br>
block-level mutual information can be transformed into an decoded quality<br>
indicator at block-level using a coding model independent of said modulation<br>
model. For example, step S2 can involve mapping of received modulation symbol<br>
signal-to interference (SIR) to symbol information (SI); mapping of the SI value to<br>
received block information (RBI); and mapping the RBI value to block error rate<br>
(BLER) and/or frame information (FI).<br>
Still referring to Fig. 3, it is decided how resources are to be allocated to the<br>
communication link in response to the current value of the quality indicator in step<br>
S4. The quality indicator is typically input to a resource allocation function, and<br>
resources are then distributed based on the output of the function. Normally, the<br>
resource allocation involves or is preceded by a comparison between the current value<br>
of the quality indicator and a target value thereof (step S3).<br>
The resource allocation can thus be performed through a resource allocation<br>
parameter, such as power or coding rate. Performing the actual resource allocation<br>
normally  involves   setting  one  or  more  of the  following  parameters  at  the<br>
transmitting unit:<br>
i)        transmission bandwidth and its spectral location<br>
ii)       timing of transmission<br>
iii)      transmit power<br>
iv)      formats of a packet or subpacket in a hybrid automatic repeat<br>
request (H-ARQ) session<br>
v)       number of retransmissions in a H-ARQ session<br>
When the resource allocation is used to determine the transmission bandwidth and<br>
its spectral location (i), it for example comprises setting the location and the<br>
number of transmitted subcarriers in a multi-carrier system, and/or the number of<br>
code channels in a code division multiplexed system. When the resource allocation<br>
is used to determine the timing of transmission (iij, it can for example comprise<br>
setting the time instant of transmitting a packet or a subpacket in an H-ARQ<br>
13<br><br>
session, and the duration of a transmitted packet or subpackets in an H-ARQ<br>
session. When the resource allocation is used to determine formats of a packet or<br>
multiple subpackets in a H-ARQ session (if), it for example comprises selecting one<br>
or more of the following parameters: the modulation order, the forward error<br>
correction (FEC) rate, the type of FEC code, and the type of H-ARQ combining.<br>
By means of the invention it is often possible to use a single look-up table for a<br>
certain coding scheme, which is independent of the modulation mode. This leads to<br>
straightforward implementations of the resource allocation functionality.<br>
It should be mentioned that the resource allocation decision sometimes may imply<br>
that transmission is not to take place, i.e. that no resources are to be allocated to the<br>
link. This is typically regulated through the transmission timing; if the current<br>
channel condition or the near future is so bad that (re)transmission is deemed<br>
useless, the transmission can be suspended and resumed later.<br>
As for the QoS criteria, normally at least one QoS criterion directly related to the<br>
quality indicator criteria (e.g. RBItarget or Fltaret) should be included when<br>
determining the resource distribution. This is typically the case with the block error<br>
rate or a per link throughput criterion. However, there may also be optional<br>
criteria, such as BLER, packet transmission delay, delay jitter or residue block<br>
error rate (BER), which can be used to determine the service priority of individual<br>
users. In either case, when at least one QoS criterion uses a quality indicator like<br>
RBI or FI, the invention improves the accuracy of the resource allocation function.<br>
The present invention results in a number of advantages. It can increase the<br>
transmission reliability by allocating resources based on channel conditions and<br>
quality requirements. Moreover, in case of a transmission failure, the proposed<br>
resource allocation will increase the probability of a successful retransmission. This<br>
means that there will not be as many retransmissions as with the conventional<br>
technology, i.e. the transmission delay caused by incorrect retransmission is<br>
reduced.<br>
Furthermore, by means of the invention, the transmission efficiency can be<br>
increased. Mutual-information based link-adaptation and power control enables<br>
14<br><br>
allocation of appropriate resources for retransmission and hence the resource<br>
waste can be reduced. The resource is allocated just above enough to support the<br>
quality requirement. Even though a margin of resource allocation is needed to<br>
ensure robustness against the channel variation and estimation errors, the<br>
resource waste will be less than for example in the traditional ARQ/HARQ that<br>
supports the same transmission quality and delay.<br>
In particular, by introducing power control and/or link-adaptation based on rich<br>
feedback, an improvement of transmission/retransmission mechanisms like<br>
ARQ/HARQ can be achieved. For example, by means of the proposed link-<br>
adaptation a flexible coding rate-selection, i.e. variable retransmission block-sizes,<br>
can be provided and hence the transmission efficiency will be increased compared<br>
to e.g. the current HARQ/AMC in HSDSCH. (Conventional ARQ/HARQ with<br>
ACK/NACK feedback can only provide a certain type of coding rates. Consequently,<br>
waste of some resource cannot be avoided sometimes, even with AMC scheduling.)<br>
There may be embodiments of the invention in which the resource allocation<br>
involves either power allocation or link adaptation. However, the invention also<br>
enables implementation of a particular preferred embodiment with cooperative<br>
power allocation and link adaptation. By means of the information-based quality<br>
model described above, link-adaptation and power allocation can be performed<br>
based on the same measurement (i.e. the mutual-information based quality<br>
indicator) simultaneously to reach the QoS requirement more exactly. Such<br>
cooperative power allocation and link adaptation is combined-designed by<br>
considering the total system resource. More flexible power allocation will then<br>
typically be used in case of limited channel resources, and more flexible link<br>
adaptation will be used in case of a strict limitation of the transmit power or<br>
interference level. Such 'cooperation' has been shown to outperform the traditional<br>
independent power allocation and link adaptation.<br>
It should be noted that, although there are systems that perform both link-<br>
adaptation and power allocation in the prior-art, in these systems the link-<br>
adaptation and power allocation are designed independently and are not<br>
cooperative. For instance, WCDMA AMR has a slot-wise inner-loop power control<br>
15<br><br>
based on slot-level SIR estimate, a TTI (transmit time interval)-wise outer-loop<br>
power control based on BLER, and a TTI-wise link-adaptation based on TTI-level<br>
SIR estimate. Another example is HSDPA, which uses quick TTI-wise link-<br>
adaptation according to channel condition and QoS requirement, together with a<br>
quite slow power control, which is not targeting any QoS requirements.<br>
The new measurements and procedures are thus very useful in connection with<br>
link-adaptation and power allocation for a given user. As mentioned, they are also<br>
useful for channel allocation or scheduling where channel resources are distributed<br>
among different users. In other words, for the purpose of this disclosure,<br>
"communication link" can refer both to a sublink in a set of sublinks forming a<br>
link/channel to a particular user and to the respective links/channels associated<br>
with respective users. In the frequency domain, channel allocation refers to<br>
allocation of carriers (FDMA) or sub-carriers (OFDM|OFDMA). In the time domain,<br>
it refers to allocation of time slots (TDMA). Similarly, in the spatial domain channel<br>
allocation refers to allocation of antenna links (e.g. MIMO), whereas in the code<br>
domain it refers to allocation of spreading codes (CDMA).<br>
As mentioned in the background section, conventional HARQ/AMC solutions<br>
typically use the required average SIR as the metric in the task of counteracting the<br>
uncertainty of wireless channel variation. The traditional method relies on the<br>
average SIR-BLER relationship. If the current transmission does not reach the<br>
desired BLER, the strategy is to retransmit at a power level or with a different<br>
modulation or coding format such that the total received SIR will be sufficient for<br>
the desired BLER. However, the average SIR-BLER characterization depends on the<br>
rate and pattern of channel variation. Different rates and patterns of channel<br>
variation result in different average SIR-BLER curves, even with the same<br>
modulation and coding. HARQ/AMC requires exhaustive simulation of all possible<br>
channel variations, which is a formidable task. The invention overcomes these<br>
difficulties by introducing an information measure characterization (Mi-based<br>
quality indicators) that translates the varying SIR values to a unified quantity that<br>
is independent of the rate and pattern of channel variation.<br>
Fig. 4A-C are schematic block diagrams illustrating various arrangements of the<br>
quality indicator determining functionality in communication units according to<br>
16<br><br>
example embodiments of the present invention. All three illustrated resource<br>
allocation mechanisms 400 present a receiving unit 41 with link monitoring<br>
functionality 43 and a transmitting unit 42 with functionality 45 for performing the<br>
actual resource allocation.<br>
In a first embodiment (Fig. 4A), the quality indicator is calculated at the quality<br>
indicator calculator 44 of the receiving unit 41. The receiver 41 also comprises<br>
means (not shown) for deciding what resources that are to be allocated to the link<br>
in question. A resource allocation control command is sent from the receiving unit<br>
41 to the transmitting unit 42 and the transmitting unit allocates resources in<br>
accordance with this command.<br>
In a second embodiment (Fig. 4B), the quality indicator calculator 44 is instead<br>
located at the transmitter side. The receiver 41 simply transmits link information<br>
for calculation of the quality indicator to the transmitter 42, whereupon the quality<br>
indicator is calculated at the transmitter, which determines and executes the<br>
resource allocation.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4C, there may also be embodiments where the quality<br>
indicator(s) are calculated at a location that is neither the actual receiver unit nor<br>
the transmitter unit, for example at a separate higher-level control unit 46. In this<br>
case, link information for calculation of the quality indicator is sent from the<br>
receiver 41 to the external control unit 46. The control unit 46 computes the<br>
quality indicator and transmits a resource allocation control command to the<br>
transmitter 42. As in Fig. 4A, the resource allocation functionality 45 of the<br>
transmitter 42 then performs the resource allocation according to the control<br>
command.<br>
To avoid confusion, the units 41 and 42 are in Fig. 4 denoted as receiver and<br>
transmitter. Of course, the normal situation would be that each unit comprises<br>
both receiving and transmitting functionality, i.e. is a transceiver unit.<br>
Quality indicator determining - example implementations<br>
As mentioned, the invention has some advantageous applications in connection<br>
with ARQ/HARQ retransmissions.<br>
17<br><br>
In HARQ, the source rate is fixed, i.e. constant K and as mentioned in the<br>
background section, the procedure of soft combining depends on which HARQ<br>
combining scheme that is used. In HARQ-CC, the receiver always combines the full<br>
retransmission of the failed block; i.e. the amount of data in the receiver buffer<br>
remains the same. In HARQ-IR, the receiver buffers coded symbols, which<br>
introduce new information to the block transmitted first; i.e. the amount of data to<br>
be buffered increases with consecutive retransmissions.<br>
Consequently, there are three types of ARQ/HARQ schemes: the traditional ARQ<br>
(type I); HARQ - Chase combining (type II); and HARQ - Incremental Redundancy<br>
(type III). The resource allocation in the different types can be explained through<br>
the different factors that are adjusted/determined:<br>
•	For type I 8s II, i.e. traditional ARQ and HARQ-CC, since the coding rate is<br>
fixed, the BLERurget or FItarget can be translated to RBItarget. Therefore,    the<br>
retransmission adaptation will be to minimize the power cost by adjusting<br>
power to reach RBItarget, i.e. power allocation. Typically, the aim is to determine<br>
the power required to achieve the received SIR that corresponds most closely<br>
to the RBItarget using HARQ-CC.<br>
•	For type III, i.e. HARQ-IR, the issue will typically be to minimize the occupied<br>
channel resource and reach FItarget, i.e. coding rate adaptation. The coding rate<br>
varies according to the re-transmission times and strategies.  After each<br>
retransmission, the HARQ-IR system will correspond to a certain code scheme,<br>
the RBItarget of which can be easily obtained from FItarget. It is also possible to<br>
combine the coding rate adaptation with power allocation. Hereby, the aim can<br>
be to determine the code rate required to achieve the received RBI that is<br>
closest to the RBItarget using HARQ-IR.<br>
In addition, for all the cases modulation adaptation might be performed based on<br>
the instantaneous channel quality. The modulation adaptation would normally be<br>
optional in the sense that manufactures can select not to do modulation<br>
adaptation.<br>
18<br><br>
For a coding block with K information bits Equation (15) provides the frame<br>
information (FI) of the ith transmission as:<br><br>
According to the BLER target (or other QoS requirements) the FI requirement is<br>
derived as:<br><br>
For a certain coding mode, there is an exclusive mapping between FI and the coded<br>
(received) block information RBI. The RBI for the ith received block is denoted RBI,.<br>
Accordingly, RBI targets for different coding modes can be obtained.<br>
19<br>
Based on the information measurements of the failed /-times receptions, the<br>
difference to the information target of successful reception can be calculated and<br>
fed back to the transmitter as the information requirement of the next<br>
retransmission. For ARQ, the information requirement for the for the i +1th try of<br>
retransmission is:<br><br><br><br>
∆RBI can be further mapped to ASIR for a given modulation mode.<br>
Generally, the FI expressions are used for coding mode selection, whereas RBI<br>
expressions are used for modulation mode selection and power control.<br>
The following paragraphs  give  examples  on power control,  modulation  mode<br>
selection and coding rate selection for the ARQ/HARQ schemes.<br>
Power control 8B modulation mode selection with given coding mode<br>
Given coding mode, the FI requirement AFI can be calculated. For both ARQ and<br>
HARQ-IR, the RBI requirement for the next try of retransmission is calculated by:<br><br>
where ∆Ni+1 is the number of coded bits within the coding block for the coming<br>
(i' + l)th retransmission, which equals to N for ARQ and HARQ-CC. The transmitted<br>
power of the (i + l)th retransmission shall be decided by both ∆SIRM and the<br>
channel prediction.<br>
For HARQ-CC with maximum ratio combining (MRC), the SIR requirement for the<br>
next try of retransmission is:<br><br><br>
with the corresponding RBI requirement:<br><br>
The SIR requirement is the effective SIR target for power control in the next try of<br>
retransmission, i.e. power shall be allocated to reach ∆RBI with a given<br>
modulation mode.<br>
Fig. 5 contains a diagram exemplifying the power allocation for an HARQ-CC system.<br>
An RBI vs. SIR mapping function is shown. SIRE,i~t-i is the effective combined SIR of<br>
the previous l~(t-l) transmissions, and SIRE,i-t is the desired effective combined SIR<br>
of all the t transmissions. SIRE,t is the SIR target of the t-th transmission, based on<br>
which the allocated power is decided. RBItarget gives the requirement of the final<br>
combined SIRtarget. The combined SIR can be obtained based on the measurements of<br>
all the received transmissions. The differences between SIRtarget and the<br>
measurements, together with the channel quality prediction, give the power<br>
requirement.<br>
As for the modulation mode, for a given effective SIR target, which could be limited<br>
by the maximum power threshold, it should be selected to satisfy the ∆RBI<br>
requirement for the coming (retransmitted) block.<br>
The present invention offers the possibility of modulation-adaptation within a<br>
coding block to maximize the channel capacity. This constitutes still another<br>
advantage thereof. By introducing the Mi-based quality model, multiple modulation<br>
modes can be used within a coding block, and with a properly designed algorithm<br>
the mixed-modulation scheme may be better than the single-modulation scheme.<br>
Coding rate selection<br>
Coding rate selection is primarily used with HARQ-IR.<br>
In case of limited transmission power and given modulation scheme, the coding<br>
rate for the next try of retransmission shall be determined to satisfy the ∆FI<br>
requirement.<br>
21<br><br>
Let Rpatuoss denote the channel path loss ratio of the i + 1th transmission channel<br>
prediction over that of the ith failed try, then:<br><br>
where Pt and PM are the transmitted power for the Ith retransmission and the<br>
i + lth retransmission respectively, and  SIR,  and  SIRM  are the corresponding<br>
received effective SIR values. Accordingly, the averaged symbol information (SI) can<br>
be calculated by:<br><br>
After the (/ +1)th retransmission try in HARQ-IR, the coding rate will change from<br>
(N,,K) to (NM,K), i.e. the (/ + l)th try will transmit ∆N = Nt+1-Ni coded bits. The<br>
mapping function FI2RBIcodM( ) for the (i + l)th try is determined by the coding<br>
rate. The coding rate should be selected to satisfy:<br><br>
Fig. 6 contains a diagram illustrating the coding rate selection for an HARQ-IR<br>
system. A number of mapping functions between FI and RBI for different coding<br>
rates A are shown. The information requirement (RBI requirement) of the next<br>
transmission for each coding rate can be calculated from Fltarget and the measured<br>
received RBI. Based on channel prediction and corresponding power allocation, the<br>
RBI of the next transmission can be predicted. The highest coding rate that<br>
satisfies the FItarget will be selected. In the illustrated example, this means that A1/2<br>
will be selected. N is then decided by the final rate of the t and (t-1) transmissions.<br>
22<br><br>
Alternatively, for a selected coding rate, the power can be determined by the RBI<br>
requirement and channel quality.<br>
Fig. 7 is a schematic block diagram of a system for resource allocation with HARQ-<br>
CC according to an example embodiment of the present invention. The example<br>
illustrates a system/mechanism 700 for combined power allocation and link<br>
adaptation comprising a quality mapping unit 70; a (re)transmission unit 71; a<br>
channel 72; a receiver 73, a unit for channel prediction 74; units 75, 76 for SIR<br>
combination and RBI calculation; a unit 77 for RBI comparison; a resource<br>
allocation decision unit 78; and a unit 79 for power control (allocation) and link<br>
adaptation.<br>
The quality mapping unit 70 is provided with or has access to a number of coding<br>
performance lookup tables (e.g. RBI-BLER or RBIR-BLER for a number of coding<br>
modes). The inputs to the quality mapping unit 70 include at least one quality<br>
requirement, such as BLERtarget and information about the coding mode, e.g. coding<br>
rate and block size. By means of these inputs the quality mapping unit can check<br>
out the information requirement/quality indicator for each coding block. In Fig. 7,<br>
the target value of the quality indicator RBI, RBItarget, is output from the quality<br>
mapping unit 70.<br>
Turning to the line containing transceiver functionality and where the channel<br>
measurements take place, an information bit sequence is input to a transmitter<br>
unit 71. The transmitter unit 71 normally has means for first transmission as well<br>
as for retransmissions and includes a code/modulation/buffer subunit 71A and a<br>
power allocation subunit 71B. The cod/mod/buffer unit 71A receives inputs<br>
comprising the information bit sequence and MCS signals (modulation mode,<br>
coding rate, etc.) and outputs a modulated symbol sequence. The modulated<br>
symbol sequence is forwarded to the power allocation unit 71B, to which the<br>
current transmitted power is also provided. The unit 71B provides the transmitted<br>
symbol sequence with the allocated power level.<br>
The transmitted base-band symbol sequence is passing a channel before entering a<br>
receiver unit 73 at the receiving side. For a real system, the channel unit 72 of Fig.<br>
7 represents the radio transmission in the air, while for simulation purposes it can<br>
23<br><br>
be a channel model introduced to model some typical wireless propagation<br>
channels.<br>
In the receiver unit 73, the base-band received symbol sequence are subject to<br>
measurement and estimation functions, which are used to carry out the link-<br>
adaptation and power control. The outputs from the receiver unit 73 include<br>
channel impulse response estimations that are transferred to a channel prediction<br>
unit 74 and SIR-related information, such as SIR estimates for each transmission<br>
unit (e.g. time slot) or the SIR distribution, normally transferred to the channel<br>
prediction unit 74 as well as to a SIR combination unit 75. The channel prediction<br>
unit 74 predicts the SIR distributions of the coming transmissions from the SIR<br>
estimates/distribution (for each transmission unit) of the previous (several) TTIs<br>
and the channel impulse response estimation of the previous TTIs.<br>
Turning to the SIR combination unit 75, maximum-ratio-combination (MRC) is<br>
assumed and inputs comprising the SIR estimates for each transmission unit of the<br>
previous (several) TTIs are combined into the effective SIR (SIRi) after MRC<br>
combination. In the subsequent RBI calculation unit 76, the equivalent RBI for the<br>
total i transmission tries is calculated based on the equivalent SIR of the total<br>
lst~ith time transmission and the modulation mode.<br>
The system 700 further comprises functionality for comparing the target value of<br>
the quality indicator (RBI) with the measured/estimated value thereof. This<br>
functionality is in Fig. 7 represented by a RBI comparison unit 77 that basically<br>
performs the calculation: ARBI = RBItarget-RBIi. The result of the comparison is<br>
turned into a ARBI-decision in the ARBI decision unit 78. In the example, if ARBI s<br>
0 the resource allocation will not be further increased but, on the other hand, if<br>
ARBI &gt; 0 the RBI requirement of the next transmission (e.g. expressed through<br>
ARBI) is transferred to the power control/link adaptation unit 79. This unit 79 for<br>
resource allocation is thus provided with the RBI requirement of the next<br>
transmission and with the SIR statistics prediction of the next transmission. Based<br>
on these inputs, it can perform MCS selection and power allocation such that the<br>
transmission conditions are improved.<br>
24<br><br>
Normally, resource allocation like the described mechanism is an iterative process,<br>
where the outputs of the power allocation/link adaptation unit 79 are transferred<br>
back to the quality mapping unit 70 and the transmitter unit, respectively, and<br>
continuous measurements are performed on the received symbol sequence in order<br>
to improve the resource distribution and transmission settings.<br>
Fig. 8 is a schematic block diagram of a system for resource allocation with HARQ-<br>
IR according to an example embodiment of the present invention. The example<br>
illustrates a system/mechanism 800 for combined power allocation and link<br>
adaptation comprising a quality mapping unit 80; a (re)transmission unit 81; a<br>
channel 82; a receiver 83, a unit for channel prediction 84; a units 85 for RBI<br>
calculation; a unit 87 for RBI comparison; a ARBI decision unit 88; and a unit 89<br>
for power control (allocation) and link adaptation.<br>
Most of the functionality of Fig. 8 corresponds more or less directly to the<br>
functionality described above with reference to Fig. 7. However, while Fig. 7 is for<br>
HARQ-CC, Fig. 8 illustrates HARQ-IR. This means that in Fig. 7, the coding rate is<br>
fixed for all the retransmission times, i.e. the quality map (RBI-BLER) is fixed for<br>
HARQ-CC. Therefore, the RBItaret need to be checked out only once. However, in<br>
Fig. 8, the coding rate decreases with more retransmission tries due to the<br>
increasing redundancy bits. Therefore, the RBI-BLER map varies according to the<br>
re-transmission times and the strategies. Consequently, RBItarget needs to be<br>
checked for each retransmission try.<br>
Moreover, the output of the receiver units 73; 83 are different. In the HARQ-CC<br>
case, SIR estimation and the channel estimation are required. HARQ-IR uses one<br>
further estimation - the quality indicator (RBI) estimation.<br>
As for the MCS selection in the transmitter unit 71; 81, with HARQ-CC only a<br>
certain MCS is used in all the retransmission tries, therefore the encoding and<br>
modulation are only implemented once for a certain information block, and the<br>
buffered modulated symbol sequence will allocated to different power levels, i.e.<br>
controlled by power allocation in the retransmissions. With HARQ-IR, on the other<br>
hand, both cod-rate &amp; modulation-mode selection will be implemented at any<br>
retransmission tries, as well as the power allocation.<br>
25<br><br>
With modifications obvious to the person skilled in the art, the schemes illustrated<br>
by Fig. 7 and 8 may be used for example to perform separate power allocation or<br>
separate link adaptation. RBI can be replaced by another quality indicator based<br>
on mutual information, such as the block-level parameters described above.<br>
Furthermore, it should be understood that the blocks of Fig. 7 and 8 represent<br>
functionality that preferably are present in a resource allocation system according<br>
to the invention. Different embodiments may have the functionalities differently<br>
implemented and two or more of the blocks may very well be implemented together<br>
at the same physical unit.<br>
Considering the coding rate limit associated with HARQ-IR, i.e. less combining gain<br>
for lower coding rate, the cooperative power allocation would be a good complement<br>
in this case. (The problem is serious for Turbo code, because most of the existing<br>
system use 1/3 rate Turbo code as the mother code, and use rate-matching to<br>
control the final coding rate. It is known that HARQ-IR has quite small gain over<br>
HARQ-CC for coding rate lower than 0.5.)<br>
The above models for ARQ/HARQ-CC and HARQ-IR are useful to reduce the<br>
retransmission delay.<br>
From the above examples it is evident that the procedure according to the invention<br>
is very useful in cases where there has been transmission failure and<br>
retransmission is performed. However, it should be emphasized that is equally<br>
applicable to provision what resources are required for new packet transmission.<br>
For example, for links without H-ARQ (such as the current voice traffic), the rich<br>
feedback can be used to adjust the power of the next packet to maintain a desirable<br>
performance level. Even when the current packet is received successfully, the rich<br>
feedback can tell the system if there are enough resources to maintain the<br>
desirable performance level for future packets. In a particular preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, comparisons with target values and adjustments of<br>
the allocated resources are performed continuously to increase the transmission<br>
reliability and efficiency.<br>
26<br><br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific illustrated<br>
embodiments, it should be emphasized that it also covers equivalents to the<br>
disclosed features, as well as modifications and variants obvious to a man skilled in<br>
the art. Thus, the scope of the invention is only limited by the enclosed claims.<br>

A method of adapting resource allocation parameters to reach one or more quality<br>
targets with improved accuracy is proposed. New information measurements based<br>
on the so-called mutual information, preferably at block-level, are introduced. The<br>
MI-based information measurements of a previous transmission, the channel<br>
prediction of a subsequent transmission and one or more quality requirements, are<br>
used to determine the amount and type of resources, e.g. time, frequency and<br>
power resources, that are to be used for the subsequent transmission. The resource<br>
allocation can for example comprise power allocation and/or link adaptation and<br>
the invention enables an advantageous implementation with cooperative link-<br>
adaptation and power allocation. The proposed method is useful in connection with<br>
ARQ/HARQ retransmissions.<br></td>
