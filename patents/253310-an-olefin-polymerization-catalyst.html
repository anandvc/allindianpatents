				<td>SUPPORTED ANTISTATIC POLYMERIZATION CATALYST<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The polymerization of olefins using supported catalyst systems is<br>
well known. It will also be recognized by those skilled in the art that the<br>
use of such supported catalysts is often associated with the development<br>
of static charges within the polymerization reactor and subsequent reactor<br>
fouling, particularly in gas phase or slurry polymerization reactors. Severe<br>
reactor fouling may cause such problems as poor heat transfer; the<br>
formation of polymer agglomerates or sheets which adhere to the reactor<br>
walls; plugging of the polymer discharge system; and in severe cases, the<br>
development of large "chunks" which can force a reactor shut down.<br>
Efforts to mitigate reactor fouling problems are widely reported in<br>
the patent literature.<br>
The use of a salt of a carboxylic acids, especially aluminum<br>
stearate, as an antifouling additive to olefin polymerization catalyst<br>
compositions is disclosed in United States Patent (USP) numbers<br>
6,271,325 (McConville et al.; to Univation); and 6,281,306 (Oskam et al.;<br>
to Univation).<br>
The preparation of supported catalysts using an amine antistatic<br>
agent, such as the fatty amine sold under the trademark KEMANINE AS-<br>
990, is disclosed in USP 6,140,432 (Agapiou et al.; to Exxon) and<br>
6,117,955 (Agapiou et al.; to Exxon).<br>
Antistatic agents are commonly added to aviation fuels to prevent<br>
the buildup of static changes when the fuels are pumped at high flow<br>
rates. The use of these antistatic agents in olefin polymerizations is also<br>
known.<br>
For example, an aviation fuel antistatic agent sold under the<br>
trademark STADIS™ composition (which contains a "polysulfone"<br>
copolymer, a polymeric polyamine and an oil soluble sulfonic acid) was<br>
originally disclosed for use as an antistatic agent in olefin polymerizations<br>
in USP 4,182,810 (Wilcox, to Phillips Petroleum). The examples of the<br><br>
Wilcox '810 patent illustrate the addition of the "polysulfone" antistatic<br>
agent to the isobutane diluent in a commercial slurry polymerization<br>
process. This is somewhat different from the teachings of the earlier<br>
referenced patents - in the sense that the carboxylic acid salts or amine<br>
antistats of the other patents were added to the catalyst, instead of being<br>
added to a process stream.<br>
The use of "polysulfone" antistatic composition in olefin<br>
polymerizations is also subsequently disclosed in:<br>
1)	chromium catalyzed gas phase olefin polymerizations, in<br>
USP 6,639,028 (Heslop et al.; assigned to BP Chemicals Ltd.);<br>
2)	Ziegler Natta catalyzed gas phase olefin polymerizations, in<br>
USP 6,646,074 (Herzog et al.; assigned to BP Chemicals Ltd.); and<br>
3)	metallocene catalyzed olefin polymerizations, in USP<br>
6,562,924 (Benazouzz et al.; assigned to BP Chemicals Ltd.).<br>
The Benazouzz et al. patent does teach the addition of STADIS™<br>
antistat agent to the polymerization catalyst in small amounts (about 150<br>
ppm by weight).<br>
However, in each of the Heslop et al. '028, Herzog et al. '074 and<br>
Benazouzz et al. '924 patents listed above, it is expressly taught that it is<br>
preferred to add the STADIS™ antistat directly to the polymerization zone<br>
(i.e. as opposed to being an admixture with the catalyst).<br>
We have discovered that supported olefin polymerization catalysts<br>
prepared with large amounts of a polysulfone-containing antistat provide<br>
surprisingly good polymerization activity and excellent antistatic<br>
performance.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an olefin polymerization catalyst<br>
comprising a porous metal oxide, a transition metal catalyst system and an<br>
antistatic additive, wherein said antistatic additive comprises a polysulfone<br>
and a solvent for said polysulfone and wherein said catalyst is further<br>
characterized in that said antistatic additive is added to said porous metal<br><br>
oxide in an amount of from 5,000 to 50,000 parts per million by weight<br>
based on the weight of said porous metal oxide.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Part A:	Catalyst System<br>
As used herein, the phrase "catalyst system" includes at least one<br>
"transition metal catalyst" (also referred to herein as a "catalyst<br>
compound") and may also include a cocatalyst or activator.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "catalyst compound" includes any<br>
compound that, once appropriately activated, is capable of catalyzing the<br>
polymerization or oligomerization of olefins. The catalyst compound<br>
comprises at least one Group 3 to Group 15 metal atom (preferably a<br>
Group 4 to 12 transition metal, most preferably titanium, zirconium or<br>
hafnium) or lanthanide or actinide atom.<br>
Thus, the catalyst compound may include for example, the well-<br>
known "chromium" polymerization catalysts (which are typically prepared<br>
by depositing a chromium species on a metal oxide support the group<br>
consisting of silica and alumina.<br>
"Ziegler Natta" polymerization catalysts may also be employed.<br>
These catalysts typically comprise a group 4 or group 5 metal - especially<br>
titanium or vanadium - in combination with hydrocarbyl aluminum activator<br>
of the general formula:<br><br>
where Ra1 is a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms; ORb1<br>
is an alkoxy or aryloxy group where ORb1 is a hydrocarbyl fragment having<br>
from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and being bonded to oxygen; X is chloride or<br>
bromide and a+b+c = 3, with the proviso that a is greater than 0.<br>
Examples of the hydrocarbyl aluminum activator in widespread use include<br>
trimethyl aluminum, trimethyl aluminum and tributyl aluminum.<br>
However, it is preferred to use a well characterized organometallic<br>
compound as the catalyst compound in the process of this invention.<br>
These catalyst compounds typically comprise a metal atom, at least one<br>
"functional" ligand and at least one leaving group. Further details follow.<br><br>
As used herein, the phrase "leaving group" generally refers to one<br>
or more chemical moieties bound to the metal center of the catalyst<br>
compound that can be abstracted from the catalyst compound, thus<br>
producing a species active towards olefin polymerization or<br>
oligomerization.<br>
As used herein, in reference to Periodic Table "Groups" of<br>
Elements, the "new" numbering scheme for the Periodic Table Groups are<br>
used as in the CRC HANDBOOK OF CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS (David<br>
R. Lide ed., CRC Press 81st ed. 2000).<br>
As used herein, a "hydrocarbyl" includes aliphatic, cyclic, olefinic,<br>
acetylenic and aromatic radicals (i.e. hydrocarbon radicals) comprising<br>
hydrogen and carbon that are deficient by one hydrogen. A<br>
"hydrocarbylene" is deficient by two hydrogens.<br>
As used herein, an "alkyl" includes linear, branched and cyclic<br>
paraffin radicals that are deficient by one hydrogen. Thus, for example, a<br>
-CH3 group ("methyl") and a CH3CH2- group ("ethyl") are examples of<br>
alkyls.<br>
As used herein, an "alkenyl" includes linear, branched and cyclic<br>
olefin radicals that are deficient by one hydrogen; alkynyl radicals include<br>
linear, branched and cyclic acetylene radicals deficient by one hydrogen<br>
radical.<br>
As used herein, "aryl" groups includes phenyl, naphthyl, pyridyl and<br>
other radicals whose molecules have the ring structure characteristic of<br>
benzene, naphthylene, phenanthrene, anthracene, etc. For example, a<br>
C6H5" aromatic structure is an "phenyl", a C6H42- aromatic structure is an<br>
"phenylene". An "arylalkyl" group is an alkyl group having an aryl group<br>
pendant therefrom, examples of which include benzyl, phenethyl,<br>
tolylmethyl and the like; an "alkylaryl" is an aryl group having one or more<br>
alkyl groups pendant therefrom, examples of which include tolyl, xylyl,<br>
mesityl, cumyl and the like.<br>
As used herein, an "alkylene" includes linear, branched and cyclic<br>
hydrocarbon radicals deficient by two hydrogens. Thus, -CH2-<br><br>
("methylene") and --CH2CH2-- ("ethylene") are examples of alkylene<br>
groups. Other groups deficient by two hydrogen radicals include "arylene"<br>
and "alkenylene".<br>
As used herein, the phrase "heteroatom" includes any atom other<br>
than carbon and hydrogen that can be bound to carbon. A "heteroatom-<br>
containing group" is a hydrocarbon radical that contains a heteroatom and<br>
may contain one or more of the same or different heteroatoms. In one<br>
embodiment, a heteroatom-containing group is a hydrocarbyl group<br>
containing from 1 to 3 atoms selected from the group consisting of boron,<br>
aluminum, silicon, germanium, nitrogen, phosphorous, oxygen and sulfur.<br>
Non-limiting examples of heteroatom-containing groups include radicals of<br>
imines, amines, oxides, phosphines, ethers, ketones, oxoazolines<br>
heterocyclics, oxazolines, thioethers, and the like.<br>
As used herein, "heterocyclic" refers to ring systems having a<br>
carbon backbone that comprise from 1 to 3 atoms selected from the group<br>
consisting of boron, aluminum, silicon, germanium, nitrogen, phosphorous,<br>
oxygen and sulfur, unless the heteroatom (non-carbon atom) is described.<br>
As used herein, an "alkylcarboxylate", "arylcarboxylate", and<br>
"alkylarylcarboxylate" is an alkyl, aryl, and alkylaryl, respectively, that<br>
possesses a carboxyl group in any position. Examples include<br>
C6H5CH2C(O)O-, CH3C(O)O, etc.<br>
As used herein, "non-interfering" means that the ligand (or cation)<br>
being referred to does not interfere with olefin polymerization (i.e. that it<br>
does not reduce the activity of olefin polymerization by more than 50% in<br>
comparison to a polymerization conducted in the absence of the ligand or<br>
cation).<br>
As used herein, the term "substituted" means that the group<br>
following that term possesses at least one moiety in place of one or more<br>
hydrogens in any position, the moieties selected from such groups as<br>
halogen radicals (esp., CI, F, Br), hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups,<br>
carboxyl groups, amine groups, phosphine groups, alkoxy groups, phenyl<br>
groups, naphthyl groups, C1 to C10 alkyl groups, C2 to C10 alkenyl groups,<br><br>
and combinations thereof. Examples of substituted alkyls and aryls includes, but are not limited<br>
to, acyl radicals, alkylamino radicals, alkoxy radicals, aryloxy radicals, alkylthio radicals,<br>
dialkylamino radicals, alkoxycarbonyl radicals, aryloxycarbonyol radicals, carbomoyl radicals,<br>
alkyl-and dialkyl-carbamoyl radicals, acyloxy radicals, acylamino radicals, arylamino radicals,<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
As used herein, structural formulas are employed as is commonly understood in the<br>
chemical arts; lines ("--") used to represent associations between a metal atom ("M", Group 3 to<br>
Group 15 atoms) and a ligand or ligand atom (e.g. cyclopentadienyl, nitrogen, oxygen, halogen<br>
ions, alkyl, etc.) as well as the phrases "associated with", "bonded to" and "bonding", are not<br>
limited to representing a certain type of chemical bond, as these lines and phrases are meant to<br>
represent a "chemical bond", a "chemical bond" defined as an attractive force between atoms<br>
that is strong enough to permit the combined aggregate to function as a unit, or "compound".<br>
Unless stated otherwise, no embodiment of the preset invention is herein limited to the<br>
oxidation state of the metal atom "M" as defined below in the individual descriptions and<br>
examples that follow. The ligation of the metal atom "M" is such that the compounds described<br>
herein are neutral, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Part B: Transition Metal Catalyst (Or Catalyst compound<br>
In general, any transition metal catalyst compound which is activated by an aluminum<br>
alkyl or methyl aluminoxane (MAO), or an "ionic activator" (discussed in Part C, below) is<br>
potentially suitable for use in the present invention. An extensive discussion of such catalysts is<br>
provided in USP 6,720,396 (Bell et al. ; assigned to Univation Technologies) and the references<br>
cited therein. A general (non-limited) overview of such catalyst compounds follows. Such<br>
catlalysts typically contain a "bulky" functional ligand. Preferred catalyst compounds are group<br>
4 metal complexes (especially titanium or zirconium) which contain one cyclopentadienyl<br><br>
ligand ("homocyclopentadienyl complexes") or two cyclopentadienyl<br>
ligands ("biscyclopentadienyl complexes").<br>
The bulky ligands are generally represented by one or more open,<br>
acyclic, or fused ring(s) or ring system(s) or a combination thereof. The<br>
ring(s) or ring system(s) of these bulky ligands are typically composed of<br>
atoms selected from Groups 13 to 16 atoms of the Periodic Table of<br>
Elements. Preferably the atoms are selected from the group consisting of<br>
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, phosphorous, germanium, boron<br>
and aluminum or a combination thereof. Most preferably the ring(s) or ring<br>
system(s) are composed of carbon atoms such as but not limited to those<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligands or cyclopentadienyl-type ligand structures or<br>
other similar functioning ligand structure such as a pentadiene, a<br>
cyclooctatetraendiyl or an imide ligand. The metal atom is preferably<br>
selected from Groups 3 through 15 and the lanthanide or actinide series of<br>
the Periodic Table of Elements. Preferably the metal is a transition metal<br>
from Groups 4 through 12, more preferably Groups 4, 5 and 6, and most<br>
preferably the transition metal is from Group 4.<br>
In one embodiment, catalyst compounds are represented by the<br>
formula:<br><br>
where M is a metal atom from the Periodic Table of the Elements and may<br>
be a Group 3 to 12 metal or from the lanthanide or actinide series of the<br>
Periodic Table of Elements, preferably M is a Group 4, 5 or 6 transition<br>
metal, more preferably M is zirconium, hafnium or titanium. The bulky<br>
ligands, LA and LB, are open, acyclic or fused ring(s) or ring system(s) and<br>
are any ancillary ligand system, including unsubstituted or substituted,<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligands or cyclopentadienyl-type ligands, heteroatom<br>
substituted and/or heteroatom containing cyclopentadienyl-type ligands.<br>
Non-limiting examples of bulky ligands include cyclopentadienyl ligands,<br>
cyclopentaphenanthreneyl ligands, indenyl ligands, benzindenyl ligands,<br>
fluorenyl ligands, octahydrofluorenyl ligands, cyclooctatetraendiyl ligands,<br>
cyclopentacyclododecene ligands, azenyl ligands, azulene ligands,<br><br>
pentalene ligands, phosphoyl ligands, phosphinimine, pyrrolyl ligands,<br>
pyrozolyl ligands, carbazolyl ligands, borabenzene ligands and the like,<br>
including hydrogenated versions thereof, for example tetrahydroindenyl<br>
ligands. In one embodiment, LA and LB may be any other ligand structure<br>
capable of .eta.5-bonding to M, preferably .eta.3-bonding to M and most<br>
preferably .eta.5-bonding. In another embodiment, LA and LB may<br>
comprise one or more heteroatoms, for example, nitrogen, silicon, boron,<br>
germanium, sulfur and phosphorous, in combination with carbon atoms to<br>
form an open, acyclic, or preferably a fused, ring or ring system, for<br>
example, a hetero-cyclopentadienyl ancillary ligand. Other LA and LB bulky<br>
ligands include but are not limited to bulky amides, phosphides, alkoxides,<br>
aryloxides, phosphinimides, imides, carbolides, borollides, porphyrins,<br>
phthalocyanines, corrins and other polyazomacrocycles. Independently,<br>
each LA and LB may be the same or different type of bulky ligand that is<br>
bonded to M. In one embodiment of formula (I) only one of either LA or LB<br>
is present.<br>
Independently, each LA and LB may be unsubstituted or substituted<br>
with a combination of substituent groups R. Non-limiting examples of<br>
substituent groups R include one or more from the group selected from<br>
hydrogen, or linear, branched alkyl radicals, or alkenyl radicals, alkynyl<br>
radicals, cycloalkyl radicals or aryl radicals, acyl radicals, aroyl radicals,<br>
alkoxy radicals, aryloxy radicals, alkylthio radicals, dialkylamino radicals,<br>
alkoxycarbonyl radicals, aryloxycarbonyl radicals, carbomoyl radicals,<br>
alkyl- or dialkyl- carbamoyl radicals, acyloxy radicals, acylamino radicals,<br>
aroylamino radicals, straight, branched or cyclic, alkylene radicals, or<br>
combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment, substituent groups R<br>
have up to 50 non-hydrogen atoms, preferably from 1 to 30 carbon, that<br>
can also be substituted with halogens or heteroatoms or the like. Non-<br>
limiting examples of alkyl substituents R include methyl, ethyl, propyl,<br>
butyl, pentyl, hexyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, benzyl or phenyl groups and<br>
the like, including all their isomers, for example tertiary butyl, isopropyl,<br>
and the like. Other hydrocarbyl radicals include fluoromethyl, fluroethyl,<br><br>
difluroethyl, iodopropyl, bromohexyl, chlorobenzyl and hydrocarbyl<br>
substituted organometalloid radicals including trimethylsilyl,<br>
trimethylgermyl, methyldiethylsilyl and the like; and halocarbyl-substituted<br>
organometalloid radicals including tris(trifluoromethyl)-silyl, methyl-<br>
bis(difluoromethyl)silyl, bromomethyldimethylgermyl and the like; and<br>
disubstituted boron radicals including dimethylboron for example; and<br>
disubstituted heteroatom radicals including dimethylamine,<br>
dimethylphosphine, diphenylamine, methylphenylphosphine, chalcogen<br>
radicals including methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, phenoxy, methylsulfide and<br>
ethylsulfide. Non-hydrogen substituents R include the atoms carbon,<br>
silicon, boron, aluminum, nitrogen, phosphorous, oxygen, tin, sulfur,<br>
germanium and the like, including olefins such as but not limited to<br>
olefinically unsaturated substituents including vinyl-terminated ligands, for<br>
example but-3-enyl, prop-2-enyl, hex-5-enyl and the like. Also, at least<br>
two R groups, preferably two adjacent R groups, are joined to form a ring<br>
structure having from 3 to 30 atoms selected from carbon, nitrogen,<br>
oxygen, phosphorous, silicon, germanium, aluminum, boron or a<br>
combination thereof. Also, a substituent group R group such as 1-butanyl<br>
may form a carbon sigma bond to the metal M.<br>
Other ligands may be bonded to the metal M, such as at least one<br>
leaving group Q. As used herein the term "leaving group" is any ligand<br>
that can be abstracted from a bulky ligand catalyst compound to form a<br>
bulky ligand catalyst species capable of polymerizing one or more<br>
olefin(s). In one embodiment, Q is a monoanionic labile ligand having a<br>
sigma-bond to M. Depending on the oxidation state of the metal, the value<br>
for n is 0, 1 or 2 such that formula (I) above represents a neutral bulky<br>
ligand catalyst compound.<br>
Non-limiting examples of Q ligands include weak bases such as<br>
amines, phosphines, ethers, carboxylates, dienes, hydrocarbyl radicals<br>
having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, hydrides or halogens and the like or a<br>
combination thereof. In another embodiment, two or more Q's form a part<br>
of a fused ring or ring system. Other examples of Q ligands include those<br><br>
substituents for R as described above and including cyclobutyl, cyclohexyl,<br>
heptyl, tolyl, trifluromethyl, tetramethylene, pentamethylene, methylidene,<br>
methyoxy, ethyoxy, propoxy, phenoxy, bis(N-methylanilide),<br>
dimethylamide, dimethylphosphide radicals and the like.<br>
In another embodiment, the catalyst compound is represented by<br>
the following formula:<br><br>
These compounds represented by formula (II) are known as<br>
bridged, ligand catalyst compounds. LA, LB, M, Q and n are as defined<br>
above. Non-limiting examples of bridging group A include bridging groups<br>
containing at least one Group 13 to 16 atom, often referred to as a divalent<br>
moiety such as but not limited to at least one of a carbon, oxygen,<br>
nitrogen, silicon, aluminum, boron, germanium and tin atom or a<br>
combination thereof. Preferably bridging group A contains a carbon,<br>
silicon or germanium atom, most preferably A contains at least one silicon<br>
atom or at least one carbon atom. The bridging group A may also contain<br>
substituent groups R as defined above including halogens and iron. Non-<br>
limiting examples of bridging group A may be represented by R2C, R'2Si,<br>
R'2Si R2Si, R2Ge, R'P, where R' is independently, a radical group which is<br>
hydride, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl, halocarbyl, substituted<br>
halocarbyl, hydrocarbyl-substituted organometalloid, halocarbyl-<br>
substituted organometalloid, disubstituted boron, substituted chalcogen, or<br>
halogen or two or more R' may be joined to form a ring or ring system. In<br>
one embodiment, the bridged, ligand catalyst compounds of formula (II)<br>
have two or more bridging groups A.<br>
In one embodiment, the catalyst compounds are those where the R<br>
substituents on the bulky ligands LA and LB of formulas (I) and (II) are<br>
substituted with the same or different number of substituents on each of<br>
the bulky ligands. In another embodiment, the bulky ligands LA and LB of<br>
formulas (I) and (II) are different from each other.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment, catalyst compounds useful in the<br>
invention include bridged heteroatom, mono-bulky ligand compounds.<br><br>
More specifically, these highly preferred catalysts are group 4 metal<br>
(especially titanium) complexes characterized by having a bridged,<br>
bidentate cyclopentadienyl-amine ligand, as disclosed in the<br>
aforementioned USP 5,04A475. Preferred bridging groups are dialkyl<br>
silyls - especially dimethyl silyl. The amine portion of the ligand preferably<br>
has an alkyl substituent on the nitrogen atom (especially tertiary butyl) with<br>
the remaining nitrogen bands bonding to the transition metal (preferably<br>
titanium) and the silicon atome of the preferred dimethyl silyl bridging<br>
group. The cyclopentadienyl ligand is pi-bonded to the transition metal<br>
and covalently bonded to the bridging group. The cyclopentadienyl group<br>
is preferably substituted, especially tetra methyl cyclopentadienyl.<br>
Preferred catalyst compounds include dimethylsilyltetramnethyl<br>
cyclopentadienyl-tertiary butyl amido titanium di chloride (and the alkyl<br>

Part C: Activation<br>
The above described transition metal catalysts are utilized for olefin polymerization in the<br>
presence of a cocatalyst of activator.<br>
Aluminoxanes, especially methyl aluminoxane, are well known cocatalyst for<br>
organometallic catalyst compounds. Methyl aluminoxane, and near variants thereof (which<br>
typically contain small levels of higher alkyl groups) are commercially available products.<br>
Although the exact structure of these aluminoxanes is still somewhat uncertain, it is generally<br>
agreed that they are oligomeric species that contain repeating units of the general formula:<br><br>
Where R is (predominantly) methl.<br>
It is alos well known to employ so-called "ionic activators" (also referred to herein as activator<br>
compounds) with organometallic catalyst<br><br>
compounds, as described in USP 5,198,401. In general, these activators<br>
comprise a cation and a substantially non-coordinating anion.<br>
More specifically, preferred activator compounds contain a<br>
compatible anion having up to 100, and preferably up to 50 non-hydrogen<br>
atoms and having at least one substituent comprising an active hydrogen<br>
moiety. Preferred substituents comprising an active hydrogen moiety<br>
correspond to the formula:<br><br>
wherein G is a polyvalent hydrocarbon radical, T is O, S, NR, or PR,<br>
wherein R is a hydrocarbyl radical, a trihydrocarbyl silyl radical, a<br>
trihydrocarbyl germyl radical, or hydrogen, H is hydrogen, q is 0 or 1, and<br>
preferably 1, and r is an integer from 1 to 3, preferably 1. Polyvalent<br>
hydrocarbon radical G has r+1 valencies, one valency being with a metal<br>
or metalloid of the Groups 5-15 of the Periodic Table of the Elements in<br>
the compatible anion, the other valency or valencies of G being attached<br>
to r groups T-H. Preferred examples of G include divalent hydrocarbon<br>
radicals such as: alkylene, arylene, aralkylene, or alkarylene radicals<br>
containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably from 2 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms. Suitable examples of G include phenylene, biphenylene,<br>
naphthylene, methylene, ethylene, 1,3-propylene, 1,4-butylene,<br>
phenylmethylene (-C6H4-CH2-). The polyvalent hydrocarbyl portion G<br>
may be further substituted with radicals that do not interfere with the<br>
coupling function of the active hydrogen moiety. Preferred examples of<br>
such noninterfering substituents are alkyl, aryl, alkyl- or aryl-substituted<br>
silyl and germyl radicals, and fluoro substituents.<br>
The group T-H in the previous formula thus may be an -OH, --SH,<br>
--NRH, or --PRH group, wherein R preferably is a C1-18, preferably a C1-10<br>
hydrocarbyl radical or hydrogen, and H is hydrogen. Preferred R groups<br>
are alkyls, cycloalkyls, aryls, arylalkyls, or alkylaryls of 1 to 18 carbon<br>
atoms, more preferably those of 1 to 12 carbon atoms. The -OH, -SH,<br>
-NRH, or -PRH groups may be part of a larger functionality such as, for<br>
example, C(O)--OH, C(S)--SH, C(O)--NRH, and C(O)-PRH. Most<br><br>
preferably, the group T--H is a hydroxy group, -OH, or an amino group,<br>
-NRH.<br>
Very preferred substituents Gq(T-H)r comprising an active<br>
hydrogen moiety include hydroxy- and amino-substituted aryl, aralkyl,<br>
alkaryl or alkyl groups, and most preferred are the hydroxyphenyls,<br>
especially the 3- and 4-hydroxyphenyl groups, hydroxytolyls, hydroxy<br>
benzyls (hydroxymethylphenyl), hydroxybiphenyls, hydroxynaphthyls,<br>
hydroxycyclohexyls, hydroxymethyls, and hydroxypropyls, and the<br>
corresponding amino-substituted groups, especially those substituted with<br>
-NRH wherein R is an alkyl or aryl radical having from 1 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms, such as for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, i-propyl, n-, i-, or t-butyl,<br>
pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, and decyl, phenyl, benzyl, tolyl, xylyl,<br>
naphthyl, and biphenyl.<br>
The compatible anion containing the substituent which contains an<br>
active hydrogen moiety, may further comprise a single Group 5-15<br>
element or a plurality of Group 5-15 elements, but is preferably a single<br>
coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core,<br>
which anion is bulky. A compatible anion specifically refers to an anion<br>
which when functioning as a charge balancing anion in the catalyst system<br>
of this invention, does not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment<br>
thereof to the transition metal cation thereby forming a neutral transition<br>
metal compound and a neutral metal by-product. "Compatible anions" are<br>
anions that are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed<br>
complex decomposes and are noninterfering with desired subsequent<br>
polymerizations. Preferred anions are those containing a single<br>
coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core<br>
carrying a substituent containing an active hydrogen moiety which anion is<br>
relatively large (bulky), capable of stabilizing the active catalyst species<br>
(the transition metal cation) which is formed when the activator compound<br>
and transition metal compound are combined and said anion will be<br>
sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefinic, diolefinic and acetylenically<br>
unsaturated compounds or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers,<br><br>
nitrites and the like. Suitable metals for the anions of activator compounds<br>
include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold, platinum and the like.<br>
Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, phosphorus,<br>
silicon and the like. Activator compounds which contain anions comprising<br>
a coordination complex containing a single boron atom and a substituent<br>
comprising an active hydrogen moiety are preferred.<br>
Preferably, compatible anions containing a substituent comprising<br>
an active hydrogen moiety may be represented by the following general<br>

preferably dialkylamido, halide, hydrocarbyloxide, preferably alkoxide and<br>
aryloxide, hydrocarbyl, and substituted-hydrocarbyl radicals, including<br>
halo-substituted hydrocarbyl radicals, and hydrocarbyl- and<br>

portion having from 1 to 20 carbons with the proviso that in not more than<br>
one occurrence is Q halide; G is a polyvalent, having r+1 valencies and<br>
preferably divalent hydrocarbon radical bonded to M' and T; T is O, S, NR,<br>
or PR, wherein R is a hydrocarbon radicals a trihydrocarbyl silyl radical, a<br>

preferably 1; d is 1; and Q, G, T, H, q, and r are as defined for Formula (I).<br>
Preferably, z' is 1, q is 1, and r is 1.<br><br>
Illustrative, but not limiting, examples of anions of activator<br>
compounds to be used in the present invention are boron-containing<br>
anions such as triphenyl(hydroxyphenyl)borate, diphenyl-<br>
di(hydroxyphenyl)borate, triphenyl(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)borate, tri(p-<br>

preferred activator complex is tris(pentafluorophenyl)(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)borate. Other preferred anions of activator compounds are<br>
those above mentioned borates wherein the hydroxy functionality is<br>
replaced by an amino NHR functionality wherein R preferably is methyl,<br>
ethyl, or t-butyl.<br>
The cationic portion b.1) of the activator compound to be used in<br>
association with the compatible anion b.2) can be any cation which is<br>
capable of reacting with the transition metal compound to form a<br>
catalytically active transition metal complex, especially a cationic transition<br>
metal complex. The cations b.1) and the anions b.2) are used in such<br>
ratios as to give a neutral activator compound. Preferably the cation is<br>
selected from the group consisting of Bronsted acidic cations, carbonium<br>
cations, silylium cations, and cationic oxidizing agents.<br>
Bronsted acidic-cations may be represented by the following<br>
general formula:<br><br>
wherein L is a neutral Lewis base, preferably a nitrogen, phosphorus, or<br>
sulfur containing Lewis base; and (L--H)+ is a Bronsted acid. The<br>
Bronsted acidic cations are believed to react with the transition metal<br><br>
compound by transfer of a proton of said cation, which proton combines<br>
with one of the ligands on the transition metal compound to release a<br>
neutral compound.<br>
Illustrative, but not limiting, examples of Bronsted acidic cations of<br>
activator compounds to be used in the present invention are trialkyl-<br>
substituted ammonium cations such as triethylammonium,<br>
tripropylammonium, tri(n-butyl)ammonium, trimethylammonium,<br>
tributylammonium, and tri(n-octyl)ammonium. Also suitable are N,N-<br>
dialkyl anilinium cations such as N,N-dimethylanilinium, N,N-<br>

such as dihexydecylmethylammonium, dioctadecylmethylammonium,<br>
ditetradecylmethylammonium, bis (hydrogenated tallow alkyl)<br>
methylammonium and similar.<br>
Particular preferred activators of this type are alkylammonium tris<br>
(pentaflurorphenyl) 4-(hydroxyphenyl) borates. A particularly preferred<br>
activator is bis (hydrogenated tallow alkyl) methyl ammonium tris<br>
(pentafluorophenyl) (4-hydroxyphenyl) borate.<br>
A second type of suitable cations corresponds to the formula: Cwherein C+ is a stable carbonium or silylium ion containing up to 30<br>
nonhydrogen atoms, the cation being capable of reacting with a<br>
substituent of the transition metal compound and converting it into a<br>
catalytically active transition metal complex, especially a cationic transition<br>
metal complex. Suitable examples of cations include tropyllium,<br>
triphenylmethylium, benzene(diazonium). Silylium salts have been<br>
previously generically disclosed in J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm., 1993,<br>
383-384, as well as Lambert, J. B., et al., Organometallics, 1994,13,<br><br>
2430-2443. Preferred silylium cations are triethylsilylium, and<br>
trimethylsilylium and ether substituted adducts thereof.<br>
Another suitable type of cation comprises a cationic oxidizing agent<br>

wherein Oxe+ is a cationic oxidizing agent having a charge of e+, and e is<br>
an integer from 1 to 3.<br>
Examples of cationic oxidizing agents include: ferrocenium,<br>
hydrocarbyl-substituted ferrocenium, Ag+ and Pb2+.<br>
The quantity of activator compound in the supported catalyst<br>
component and the supported catalyst is not critical, but typically ranges<br>
from 0.1, preferably from 1 to 2,000 micromoles of activator compound per<br>
gram of treated support material. Preferably, the supported catalyst or<br>
component contains from 10 to 1,000 micromoles of activator compound<br>
per gram of treated support material.<br>
The supported catalyst component of the present invention as such<br>
or slurried in a diluent can be stored or shipped under inert conditions, or<br>
can be used to generate the supported catalyst of the present invention.<br>
With respect to this type of activator, a particularly preferred<br>
compound is the reaction product of an alkylammonium tris<br>
(pentafluorophenyl)-4-(hydroxyphenyl) borate and an organometallic<br>
compound, for example trimethylaluminum.<br>
Part D:	Particulate Metal Oxide Support<br>
The catalyst of this invention must be prepared with a particulate<br>
metal oxide support.<br>
The use of metal oxide supports in the preparation of olefin<br>
polymerization catalysts is known to those skilled in the art. An exemplary<br>
list of suitable metal oxides includes oxides of aluminum, silicon,<br>
zirconium, zinc and titanium. Alumina, silica and silica-alumina are metal<br>
oxides that are well known for use in olefin polymerization catalysts and<br>
are preferred for reasons of cost and convenience. Silica is particularly<br>
preferred.<br><br>
It is preferred that the metal oxide have a particle size of from about<br>
1 to about 200 microns. It is especially preferred that the particle size be<br>
between about 30 and 100 microns if the catalyst is to be used in a gas<br>
phase or slurry polymerization process and that a smaller particle size<br>
(less than 10 microns) be used if the catalyst is used in a solution<br>
polymerization.<br>
Conventional porous metal oxides that have comparatively high<br>
surface areas (greater than 1 m2/g, particularly greater than 100 m2/g,<br>
more particularly greater than 200 m2/g) are preferred to non-porous metal<br>
oxides.<br>
Highly preferred silica is further characterized by having a pore<br>
volume of from 0.1 to 5 mL/g (especially 0.5 to 3 mL/g). Average pore<br>
sizes of 50 to 500 Angstroms (A) (especially 75 to 400 A) are also<br>
preferred.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the high<br>
surface area of the preferred supports facilitates the incorporation of the<br>
high levels of antistatic agent (which are required by this invention) onto<br>
the support.<br>
The support material may be subjected to a heat treatment and/or<br>
chemical treatment to reduce the water content or the hydroxyl content of<br>
the support material.<br>
Typically chemical dehydration agents are reactive metal hydrides,<br>
aluminum alkyls and halides. Prior to its use the support material may be<br>
subjected to treatment at 100°C to 1000°C and preferably at 200 to 850°C<br>
in an inert atmosphere under reduced pressure.<br>
The support material may be further combined with an<br>
organoaluminum compound and most preferably a trialkylaluminum<br>
compound in a dilute solvent.<br>
The support material is preferably pretreated with the<br>
trialkylaluminum compound at a temperature of 20°C to 150°C and<br>
preferably at 20°C to 100°C.<br><br>

transition metal is preferably titanium or zirconium) to ionic activator<br>
employed in the method of the present invention may be in the range<br>
1:10000 to 100:1. A preferred range is from 1:5000 to 10:1 and most<br>
preferred from 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
Part E:	Antistatic "Polysulfone" Additive<br>
The antistatic polysulfone additive comprises at least one of the<br>
components selected from:<br>
(1)	a polysulfone copolymer;<br>

polysulfone copolymer.<br>
Preferably, the antistatic additive comprises at least two<br>

component of the antistatic additive (often designated as olefin-sulfur<br>
dioxide copolymer, olefin polysulfones, or poly(olefin sulfone)) is a<br>
polymer, preferably a linear polymer, wherein the structure is considered<br>
to be that of alternating copolymers of the olefins and sulfur dioxide,<br>
having a one-to-one molar ratio of the comonomers with the olefins in<br>
head to tail arrangement. Preferably, the polysulfone copolymer consists<br>
essentially of about 50 mole percent of units of sulfur dioxide, about 40 to<br>
50 mole percent of units derived from one or more 1-alkenes each having<br>
from about 6 to 24 carbon atoms, and from about 0 to 10 mole percent of<br>
units derived from an olefinic compound having the formula ACH=CHB<br>
where A is a group having the formula —(Cx H2x)—COOH wherein x is<br>
from 0 to about 17, and B is hydrogen or carboxyl, with the proviso that<br>
when B is carboxyl, x is 0, and wherein A and B together can be a<br>
dicarboxylic anhydride group.<br>
Preferably, the polysulfone copolymer employed in the present<br>
invention has a weight average molecular weight in the range 10,000 to<br><br>

from the one of more 1-alkenes are preferably derived from straight chain<br>
alkenes having 6-18 carbon atoms, for example 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-<br>
octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-hexadecene and 1-octadecene.<br>
Examples of units derived from the one or more compounds having the<br>
formula ACH=HB are units derived from maleic acid, acrylic acid, 5-<br>
hexenoic acid.<br>
A preferred polysulfone copolymer is 1-decene polysulfone having<br>
an inherent viscosity (measured as a 0.5 weight percent solution in toluene<br>
at 30°C) ranging from about 0.04 dl/g to 1.6 dl/g.<br>
The polymeric polyamines that can be suitably employed in the<br>
process of the present invention are described in U.S. Patent 3,917,466, in<br>
particular at column 6 line 42 to column 9 line 29.<br>
The polymeric polyamine may be prepared for example by heating<br>
an aliphatic primary monoamine or N-aliphatic hydrocarbyl alkylene<br>
diamine with epichlorohydrin in the molar proportion of from 1:1 to 1:1.5 at<br>
a temperature of 50°C to 100°C in the presence of a solvent, e.g. a<br>
mixture of xylene and isopropanol, adding a strong base, e.g. sodium<br>
hydroxide and continuing the heating at 50 to 100°C for about 2 hours.<br>
The product containing the polymeric polyamine may then be separated by<br>
decanting and then flashing off the solvent.<br>
The polymeric polyamine is preferably the product of reacting an N-<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbyl alkylene diamine or an aliphatic primary amine<br>
containing at least 8 carbon atoms and preferably at least 12 carbon<br>

are those derived from tall oil, tallow, soy bean oil, coconut oil and cotton<br>
seed oil. The polymeric polyamine derived from the reaction of<br>
tallowamine with epichlorohydrin is preferred. A method of preparing such<br>
a polyamine is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,917,466, column 12, preparation<br>

form polymeric products are well known and find extensive use in epoxide<br>
resin technology.<br>
A preferred polymeric polyamine is a 1:1.5 mole ratio reaction<br>

PartF:	Polymerization Process<br>
Polymerization processes suitable for this include gas phase, slurry<br>
phase process; a high pressure process or a combination thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the process of this invention is directed toward<br>
a high pressure, slurry or gas phase polymerization process of one or<br>
more olefin monomers having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to<br>
12 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The invention<br>
is particularly well suited to the polymerization of two or more olefin<br>
monomers of ethylene, propylene, butene-1, pentene-1,4-methyl-pentene-<br>
1, hexene-1, octene-1 and decene-1.<br>
Other monomers useful in the polymerization process of the<br>
invention include ethylenically unsaturated monomers, diolefins having 4<br><br>
to 18 carbon atoms, conjugated or non-conjugated dienes, polyenes, vinyl monomers and cyclic<br>
olefins. Non-limiting monomers useful in the invention may include norbornene, norbomadiene,<br>
isobutylene, isoprene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, styrenes, alkyl substituted styrene, ethylidene<br>
norbornene, dicyclopentadiene and cyclopentene.<br>
In the most preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, a copolymer of ethylene<br>
is produced, where with ethylene, a comonomer having at least one alpha-olefin having from 4 to<br>
15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to .12 carbon atoms, and most preferably from 4 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms, is polymerized in a solution polymerization process.<br>
In another embodiment of the process of the invention, ethylene or propylene is polymerized<br>
with at least two different comonomers, optionally one of which may be a diene, to form a<br>
terpolymer.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a polymerization process for polymerizing<br>
propylene alone or with one or more other monomers including ethylene, and/or other olefins<br>
having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms. Polypropylene polymers may also be produced.<br>
Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in<br>
one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle<br>
stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is<br>
removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external<br>
to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream<br>
containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence<br>
of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed<br>
and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the<br>
reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S.<br>
Patent 4,543,399)<br>
The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vary from about 100 psig (690 kPa) to about 500<br>
psig (3,448kPa), preferably in the range<br><br>
of from about 200 psig (1,379 kPa) to about 400 psig (2,759 kPa), more<br>
preferably in the range of from about 250 psig (1,724 kPa) to about 350<br>
psig (2,414 kPa).<br>
The reactor temperature in a gas phase process may vary from<br>
about 30°C to about 120°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 115°C,<br>
more preferably in the range of from about 70°C to 110°C, and most<br>
preferably in the range of from about 70°C to about 95°C.<br>
Other gas phase processes contemplated by the process of the<br>
invention include series or multistage polymerization processes.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the reactor utilized in the present<br>
invention is capable and the process of the invention is producing greater<br>
than 500 lbs of polymer per hour (227 Kg/hr) to about 200,000 Ibs/hr<br>
(90,900 Kg/hr) or higher of polymer, preferably greater than 1,000 Ibs/hr<br>
(455 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 10,000 Ibs/hr (4,540 Kg/hr),<br>
even more preferably greater than 25,000 Ibs/hr (11,300 Kg/hr), still more<br>
preferably greater than 35,000 Ibs/hr (15,900 Kg/hr), still even more<br>
preferably greater than 50,000 Ibs/hr (22,700 Kg/hr) and most preferably<br>
greater than 65,000 Ibs/hr (29,000 Kg/hr) to greater than 100,000 Ibs/hr<br>
(45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the<br>
range of from about 1 to about 50 atmospheres and even greater and<br>
temperatures in the range of 0°C to about 120°C. In a slurry<br>
polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a<br>
liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers<br>
and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension<br>
including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor<br>
where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and<br>
recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent<br>
employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from<br>
3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium<br>
employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and<br>
relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be<br><br>
Operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an<br>
isobutane medium is employed.<br>
A preferred polymerization technique of the invention is referred to as particle form<br>
polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which<br>
the polymer goes into solution. Such technique is well know in the art, and described in for<br>
instance U.S. Patent 3,248,179. Other slurry processes include those employing a loop reactor<br>
and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-<br>
limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also,<br>
other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Patent 4,613,484.<br>
In an embodiment the reactor used in the slurry process of the invention is capable of<br>
and the process of the invention is producing greater than 2,000 lbs of polymer per hour (907<br>
Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 5,000 lbs/hr (2,268 Kg/hr), and most preferably greater than<br>
10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr). In another embodiment the slurry reactor used in the process of the<br>
invention is producing greater than 15,000 lbs of polymer per hour (6,804 Kg/hr), preferably<br>
greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,340 Kg/hr) to about 100,000 lbs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
Further details are illustrated in the following non-limiting examples<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Part A- Catalyst Synthesis<br>
Catalysts<br>
Grace-Davison sylopol 948 silica was calcined dehydrated at 250°C under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere for 5 hours, prior to use in the preparation of a "passified" silica (i.e. silica treated<br>
with triethyl aluminum, "TEAL") described in the following section.<br><br>
(A.1) TEAL-Treated Silica (SiO2/TEAL)<br>
650 mL of dry, degassed heptane were added to a 1 L flask,<br>
followed by 11.25 mL of a 0.29 weight % solution of polysulfone/solvent<br>
antistatic additive sold under the trademark STADIS™ 425 (purchased from<br>
Octel Starrion L.L.C.) in heptane, and 150 g of calcined Sylopol 948 silica.<br>
The flask was placed on the rotating arm of a rotary evaporator and turned<br>
slowly for 15 minutes. 100 mL of a 25 weight (wt) % TEAL in hexane<br>
solution was added to the flask and then swirled by hand (Note: there is<br>
some heat evolution). 75 mL of 25 weight % TEAL in hexane was then<br>
added. The flask was then placed on the rotating arm of a rotary<br>
evaporator and turned slowly for 1 hour. The slurry was filtered. The filter<br>
cake was transferred back to the flask, reslurried in 350 mL of heptane<br>
and rotated for an additional 30 minutes. The slurry was filtered. The filter<br>
cake was transferred back to the flask, reslurried in 350 mL of heptane<br>
and rotated for an additional 30 minutes. The slurry was filtered a third<br>
time. The filter cake was transferred back to the flask, reslurried in 350 mL<br>
of heptane along with 11.25 mL of the 0.29 weight % solution of STADIS™<br>
425 in heptane. The flask was placed on the rotating arm of a rotary<br>
evaporator and turned slowly for 15 minutes. The solvent was then<br>
removed under vacuum while heating to 60°C to reach a final vacuum of<br>
300 millitorr.<br>
(A.2) Preparation of Supported Catalyst (Method A - "Sequential"<br>
STADIS™ Addition)<br>
Working in a glovebox under inert atmospheric conditions, 1.43 mL<br>
of a 9.58 weight % toluene solution of an activator (described in Part C of<br>
the preferred embodiments), namely<br>
[(C18H37)2CH3NH]{(C6F5)3B(C6H4OH)}) and 0.42 mL of 0.25 molar TEAL in<br>
toluene were mixed in a 100 mL round-bottomed flask and allowed to sit<br>
for 5 minutes. 1.61 g of SiO2/TEAL (from A.1) was then added and the<br>
mixture was shaken on a Lab-Line Mistral Multi-Mixer at high speed for 1<br>
hour. 1.08 mL of 8 weight % of a transition metal catalyst (or catalyst<br>
compound, as described in Part B of the preferred embodiments), namely<br><br>
(N-(tert-butyl)-l, 1 -di-p-tolyl-1 -((1,2,3,3a,7a-Ti)-3-(1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-<br>
yl)1H-inden-1-yl)silanaminato-(2-)-N-)dimethyltitanium catalyst molecule in<br>
heptane was premixed with the 0.3 mL of hexene. The catalyst<br>
molecule/hexene solution was then added to the round bottom flask<br>
containing the support/activator material. The flask was then shaken for 1<br>
hour. A (calculated) amount of a 0.29 weight % solution of STADIS™ 425<br>
in heptane to achieve the targeted total antistatic agent concentration in<br>
the final product (as shown in Tables 1 and 2) was then added to the<br>
mixture followed by an additional 15 minutes of mixing. The flask was<br>
then placed under vacuum and dried to a residual pressure of 300 millitorr.<br>
(A.3) Preparation of Supported Catalyst (Method B - "Simultaneous"<br>
STADIS" Addition)<br>
Working in a glovebox under inert atmospheric conditions, 1.43 mL<br>
of a 9.58 weight % toluene solution of<br>
[(C18H37)2CH3NH]{(C6F5)3B(C6H4OH)} and 0.42 mL of 0.25 molar TEAL in<br>
toluene were mixed in a 100 mL round-bottomed flask and allowed to sit<br>
for 5 minutes. 1.61 g of SiC^/TEAL was then added and the mixture was<br>
shaken on a Lab-Line Mistral Multi-Mixer at high speed for 1 hour. 1.08<br>
mL of 8 weight % (N-(tert-butyl)-1 ,1-di-p-tolyl-1-((1,2,3,3a,7a-n)-3-(1,3-<br>
dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)1H-inden-1-yl)silanaminato-(2-)-N-<br>
)dimethyltitanium catalyst molecule in heptane was premixed with the 0.3<br>
mL of hexene. A (calculated) amount of STADIS™ 425 to achieve the<br>
targeted total agent concentration in the final product was then added to<br>
the mixture (see Tables 1 and 2). The catalyst molecule/hexene/STADIS™<br>
solution was then added to the round bottom flask containing the<br>
support/activator material. The flask was then shaken for 1 hour. The<br>
flask was then placed under vacuum and dried to a residual pressure of<br>
300 millitorr.<br>
Part B - Batch Polymerization<br>
Ethylene polymerization experiments in Bench Scale Reactor were<br>
conducted on a 2 L, stirred, autoclave reactor in gas phase operation.<br><br>
Ethylene polymerizations were run at 80°C for 60 minutes with a total<br>
operating pressure of 300 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) under<br>
homopolymerization conditions. Ethylene partial pressure was 120 psig<br>
and nitrogen constituted the remainder of the gas phase mixture<br>
(approximately 60 mole %). During reactor conditioning and setup, 0.4 mL<br>
of a 25 weight percent solution of tri-isobutylaluminum (TiBAL) was used<br>
as an impurity scavenger to assist with purification of reactor internals and<br>
the seedbed (150 g of high density polyethylene). Catalyst (See Table 1)<br>
was loaded into an injection tube under anaerobic conditions in a glovebox<br>
and was then connected to the reactor. A portion of the nitrogen used to<br>
make up the reactor gas composition was used to push the catalyst into<br>
the reactor at the start of polymerization.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Part C - TSR Polymerization<br>
Continuous, ethylene-hexene gas phase copolymerization<br>
experiments were conducted in a larger 70L Technical Scale Reactor<br>
(TSR) in continuous gas phase operation. Ethylene polymerizations were<br>
run at 80°C with a total operating pressure of 300 pounds per square inch<br>
gauge (psig). Gas phase compositions for ethylene and hexene were<br>
controlled via closed-loop process control to values of 50.0 and 0.22 mole<br>
percent, respectively. Hydrogen was metered into the reactor in a molar<br>
feed ratio of 0.00215 relative to ethylene feed during polymerization.<br>
Nitrogen constituted the remainder of the gas phase mixture<br>
(approximately 49 mole %). Typical production rate for these conditions is<br>
2 to 2.5 of polyethylene per hour.<br>
The catalyst metering device used for administering catalyst to the<br>
reactor is equipped with a probe that measures electrostatic charge<br>
carried by the solid material passing through a monitored tube leading<br>
catalyst to the reactor.<br><br>
Two catalysts were tested on the catalyst metering system of the<br>
Technical Scale Reactor (corresponding to catalyst 1 and catalyst 3 from<br>
Table 1).<br>
The probe did not detect electrostatic charge (during a "control" run<br>
when no catalyst was passing through the tube). A large static charge<br>
was observed by the probe when catalyst 1 was passing through the tube.<br>
The probe detected substantively less electrostatic charge when catalyst 3<br>
was passing through the tube.<br>
Two catalysts (corresponding catalysts 3 and 6 from Table 1) were<br>
tested for five days in the Technical Scale Reactor under continuous<br>
copolymerization conditions. Catalyst 3 was successfully used to produce<br>
hexene/ethylene copolymer for 33 hours. Then, without interrupting the<br>
copolymerization a transition was made to the catalyst 6 and<br>
polymerization was conducted for 60 more hours. No substantial reactor<br>
fouling or agglomeration formation was observed during the experiment.<br>
In contrast, comparative experiments with catalyst 1 typically produced<br>
enough fouling to force termination of the polymerization reactions after<br>
several hours and in some cases it was not even possible to establish<br>
stable polymerization with catalyst 1 due to static/fouling conditions.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Highly active supported "single site" catalysts for the polymerization<br>
of ethylene are prepared with a porous metal oxide support and a very<br>
large amount of an antistatic agent. The use of the large amount of<br>
antistatic agent reduces the tendency of the single site catalyst to foul the<br>
polymerization reactor. The polyethylene produced with these catalysts<br>
may be used to produce a wide variety of extruded and molded goods,<br>
ranging from flexible plastic films to rigid plastic containers.<br><br>
