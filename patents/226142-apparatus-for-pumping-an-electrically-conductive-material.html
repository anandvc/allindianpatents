				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to electromagnetic pumps that move an electrically<br>
conductive fluid by interaction with magnetic fields.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002J Electromagnetic pumps can be used to pump electrically conductive fluids, such<br>
as an electrically conductive molten metal composition. An advantage of an<br>
electromagnetic pump is that the fluid can be magnetically induced to move through a<br>
tube or conduit without the use of mechanical pump components inside of the conduit.<br>
[0003] Known electromagnetic pumps are either submersed in. or integrally attached to.<br>
the source of the electrically conductive fluid, such as a metal melting and/or melt<br>
holding furnace.<br>
These pump installations are difficult to service and maintain. Therefore there is the need<br>
for an efficient and easily maintainable electromagnetic pump that is not integrally<br>
attached to the source of the electrically conductive fluid.<br>
US 4776767 discloses an outer conduit (13) in which a hollow inner conduit (16) is<br>
inserted. Magnetic core (17) is inserted within inner conduit (16) and induction coil (14)<br>
surrounds outer conduit (13). Alternating current flow causes molten metal (12) to flow<br>
through the passage formed between the inner wall of outer conduit (13) and outer wall<br>
of inner conduit (16). In the present invention an open mid tube (34) is disposed within<br>
an outer open tube (28) having a closed bottom to form an annular volume (44) between<br>
the inner wall of the outer tube (28) and outer wall of the mid tube (34). The top of the<br>
annular volume is in communication with an outlet (22) for exit of the electrically<br>
conductive material from the apparatus. An inner tube (40) is disposed within the mid<br>
tube (34) and magnetic material (46) is disposed between the outer wall of the inner<br>
tube (40) and the inner wall of the mid tube (34). Inlet (24) is provided near the top of<br>
the open inner tube (40) and is in communication with the opening in the inner tube for<br>
entry of the electrically conductive material into the open inner tube (40) via the inlet. A<br>
plurality of induction coils (12a-121) are disposed around the exterior height of the<br>
outer lube (28) and a means for supplying an alternating current to each of the plurality<br>
of induction coils (12a-121) to force the electrically conductive material up through the<br>
annular volume and the outlet (22) by the magnetic forces applied to the electrically<br><br>
conductive material by the magnetic fields created by the supply of the alternating<br>
current to each of the plurality of induction coils (12a-121).<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
[0004] In one aspect, the invention is apparatus for and method of pumping an<br>
electrically conductive material in a pump having a supply section or volume, and a<br>
magnetic force pumping section or volume. In one example of the invention the<br>
directional flow of the material through the supply section is opposite to the directional<br>
How of the material through the magnetic force pumping section. Multiple coils surround<br>
the supply and magnetic force pumping sections.<br>
Current flowing through the multiple coils creates magnetic fields that magnetically<br>
couple with a magnetic material disposed between the supply and magnetic force<br>
pumping sections so that the fields penetrate the electrically conductive material in the<br>
magnetic force pumping section substantially perpendicular to the desired flow direction.<br>
This field orientation maximizes the magnitudes of the magnetic forces applied to the<br>
electrically conductive material in the magnetic force pumping section.<br>
[0005] These and other aspects of the invention are set forth in the specification.<br>
Statement of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for pumping an electrically<br>
conductive material, the apparatus comprising an outer open tube having a closed bottom;<br>
an open mid tube disposed within the outer tube to form an annular volume between the<br>
inner wall of the outer tube and outer wall of the mid tube, the top of the annular volume<br>
in communication with an outlet for exit of the electrically conductive material from the<br>
apparatus; an open inner tube disposed within the mid tube; a magnetic material disposed<br>
between the outer wall of the inner tube and the inner wall of the mid tube; an inlet for<br>
entry of the electrically conductive material into the open inner tube, the inlet disposed<br>
near the top of the open inner tube and in communication with the opening in the inner<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0015] Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numerals indicate like elements, there<br>
is shown in the figures one example of electromagnetic pump 10 of the present invention<br>
for pumping an electrically conductive material, such as an electrically conductive molten<br>
metal. In FIG. 1. twelve induction coils (12a through 121) as further described below, are<br><br>
surrounded by a plurality of vertical magnetic shunts 14 held in place by shunt supports<br>
16. which are attached to base 18 at one end. and to yoke 20 at the opposing end. The<br>
base and yoke may optionally be formed from a magnetic material to provide bottom and<br>
top magnetic field containment. Other shunt and outer support arrangements as known in<br>
the art may be used in lieu of the shunt and support arrangements shown in FIG. I. Pump<br>
inlet 24 and pump outlet 22 in this non-limiting example of the invention, are<br>
cylindrically formed from a suitable heat-resistant material.<br>
[0016] Referring now to FIG. 3 (a), which is a side sectional of electromagnetic pump 10<br>
shown in FIG. 2, optional thermal insulator 26 separates ihe induction coils from the<br>
interior of the pump and provides a means for molten metal (melt) heat retention for melt<br>
in the pump. In this non-limiting example of the invention., the thermal insulator is<br>
substantially shaped as an open cylinder bounded by base 18 and yoke 20. Outer lube 28<br>
in this non-limiting example of the invention is a substantially cylindrically -shaped tube<br>
that has a closed rounded bottom and an opened top with a protruding lip around the<br>
opening. The outer tube's lip sits on top of yoke 20.<br>
First closing means 30 seats over yoke 20 and the protruding lip of the outer tube. Second<br>
closing means 32 seals over first closing means 30. Outlet 22 is disposed between the<br>
first and second closing means. Mid tube 34 in this non-limiting example of the invention<br>
is a substantially cylindrically-shaped tube that is opened at both ends with the upper end<br>
having a protruding lip around the opening. The mid tube's lip is seated in a recess in<br>
second closing means 32. The first and second closing means are arranged to form an<br>
outlet annular volume 42 that connects the interior passage of outlet 22 to riser annular<br>
volume 44 that is disposed between the outer wall of mid lube 34 and the inner wall of<br>
outer tube 28. Third closing means 36 seats over second closing means 32. Inner tube 40<br>
in this non-limiting example of the invention is a substantialh cylindrically-spaced tube<br>
that has an open bottom and a closed top. As best seen in FIG. 3 (e) the perimeter of the<br>
inner tube's open bottom forms a fluid light seal with the perimeter of the mid lube's<br>
open bottom. Magnetic material 46 is disposed in a volume between the outer v\all of<br>
inner tube 40 and the inner wall of mid tube 34 as further described below. Fourth closing<br>
means 38 seats over third closing means 36 and the closed top of inner lube 40. Inlet 24 is<br>
disposed between the third and fourth closing means and its interior passage is connected<br><br>
to the interior passage of inner tube 40. FIG. 3 (b) is a sectional view- that illustrates the<br>
spatial relationship of components in a horizontal plane.<br>
[0017] The above non-limiting examples of the invention provide a convenient means for<br>
assembly or disassembly of pump 10. Removal of fourth closing means .18 allows inlet<br>
24 and inner tube 40 to be raised out of the pump. Further removal of third closing means<br>
36 allows magnetic material 46 and mid tube 34 to be raised out of the pump, further<br>
removal of second closing means 32 allows removal of outlet 22. further removal of first<br>
closing means 30 allows removal of outer tube 28.<br>
[0018] The above examples of the invention provide a convenient means for changing the<br>
angular orientation between inlet 24 with outlet 22. In a particular installation, supply and<br>
outlet conduit (not shown in the drawings) that are to be connected to inlet 24 and outlet<br>
22 respectively, may not be oriented io accept the 180 degrees angular orientation<br>
(looking down on the top of the pump) between the inlet and outlet for pump 10 as shown<br>
in FIG. I. first closing means 30 and second closing means 32 may he rotated and<br>
secured into a position different from that shown in FIG. 1 to change the angular<br>
orientation of inlet 24 to outlet 22. which outlet is contained by the first and second<br>
closing means. Third closing means 36 and fourth closing means 38 may be rotated and<br>
secured into a position different from that shown in FIG. 1 to change the angular<br>
orientation of outlet 22 to inlet 24, which inlet is contained by the third and fourth closing<br>
means.<br>
[0019] Molten metal flows through pump 10 hi the direction indicated by the arrows in<br>
FIG. 3 (a). The melt enters the pump through inlet 24 and flows down the interior<br>
cylindrical passage of inner tube 40. This section of the pump is referred to as the supply<br>
section. The melt then moves by magnetic forces, as further described below, up riser<br>
annular volume 44 (the magnetic force pumping section), into outlet annular volume 42.<br>
and finally out of the pump through outlet 22. In other examples of the invention, outlet<br>
22 may connect directly to riser annular volume 44 rather than being intermediately<br>
connected to it by outlet annular volume 42 formed between the inner wall of mid tube 34<br>
and the inner annular walls of the first and second annular closing means. I he outer tube,<br>
mid tube and inner tube are formed from a suitable heal resistant material such as a<br>
ceramic composition. One non-limiting type of ceramic composition that may be used to<br><br>
cast the outer, mid and inner tubes, as well as inlet 24 and outlet 22 is a silicon-<br>
aluminum-oxynitride composition known as sialon.<br>
[0020] As disclosed above an applied magnetic force causes the electrically conductive<br>
melt to flow through pump 10. There is shown in FIG. 4 (a) one diagrammatic example<br>
of supplying power to the induction coils to cause the molten metal to flow through pump<br>
10 by magnetic force. Power supply 48 is a three-phase output power supply with<br>
variable output frequency and output voltage. One suitable type of supply is a solid state<br>
supply with a pulse width modulated output. FIG. 4 (b) is a vector diagram illustrating a<br>
six-cycle connection scheme from the power supply to the coils that is used to produced<br>
magnetic forces that act on the molten metal in riser annular volume 44 to force the melt<br>
up the riser annual volume and through outlet 22. and thus pulling molten metal through<br>
pump 10 from a suitable source of molten metal that can be connected to inlet 24. As<br>
illustrated in the diagram and vector diagram, the six-cycle scheme is created by<br>
sequentially connecting each of the three phases with alternating positive and negative<br>
phase orientation. That is phase +AB is followed by phase-BC. which is followed by<br>
phase CA. which is followed by phase-AB. which is followed by phase BC which is<br>
followed by phase-CA. The six-cycle connection scheme for induction coils 12a through<br>
121 repeats for induction coils 12g through 121. The choice of a six-cycle connection<br>
scheme is not limiting, but a six-cycle scheme (with 30 electrical degrees phase angle<br>
between voltages in adjacent coils) provides a more uniform flow rale than, for example,<br>
a three-cycle scheme (with 60 electrical degrees phase angle between voltages in adjacent<br>
coils). Since the magnitude of the output voltage of power supply 48 is directly<br>
proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic force applied to the molten metal, varying<br>
the output voltage of the power supply will vary the magnetic lilting force and flow rate<br>
of a molten metal through the pump.<br>
[0021] The magnetic forces generated in riser annular volume 44 are substantially<br>
vertical in the upwards direction since the magnetic field generated around each of the<br>
coils substantially forms a magnetic circuit with magnetic material 46 and the field path<br>
through the molten metal in the riser annular volume is substantially horizontally-<br>
oriented. If a hot molten metal is pumped b&gt; electromagnetic pump 10. magnetic material<br>
46 must have a Curie temperature (point at which the magnetic material loses its<br><br>
magnetic properties) greater than the temperature of the molten metal llowiiig through the<br>
pump. For these applications a high Curie temperature magnetic material must be used.<br>
for example, molten aluminum typicall) may flow through the pump at a temperature of<br>
ranging from 680°C to 800°C. For this application the magnetic material must have a<br>
Curie temperature of at least 850°C which is the maximum temperature of the aluminum<br>
melt plus design margin. One suitable type of high Curie temperature magnetic material<br>
46 for this application is a class of iron-cobalt alloys known as pcrmcndur.<br>
[0022] It is preferable, but not required, that each induction coil be formed as a thin-wire,<br>
multiple-turn (typically 500 or more turns) coil commonly referred to as a bobbin<br>
magnetic coil since it is formed by winding thin wire around a bobbin that is removed<br>
after winding. Since the magnitude of magnetic force created by a magnetic field is<br>
directly proportional to both current flow through the coil and the number of turns in the<br>
coil, using a coil with a large number of turns keeps the required outpu: current from<br>
power supply 48 at a low level for a given magnitude of magnetic force.<br>
[0023] If the source of molten metal to the pump is located below the horizontal level of<br>
inlet 24. pump 10 will need to be initially primed by filing the interior passage of inner<br>
lube 40 with melt. One method of accomplishing this is by attaching a vacuum pump to<br>
outlet 22 and drawing a vacuum on the melt flow passages within pump 10 to suction<br>
melt from a supply of molten metal connected to inlet 24. In other examples of the<br>
invention, the top of inner tube 40 may be open and penetrate through fourth closing<br>
means 38 in. for example, a funnel-shaped opening into which molten metal can be<br>
poured to prime the pump by filling the inner tube.<br>
[0024] When pump 10 is not in use. stationary molten metal in the pump may cool and<br>
"freeze" within the pump's internal flow passages, to prevent this from happening, a<br>
cyclical emptying and filling of riser annular volume 44 with molten metal may be<br>
electromagnetically accomplished. Reversing the direction of all phase vectors in FIG. 4<br>
(b) will create a magnetic force on molten metal in riser annular volume 44 that will force<br>
it down and push molten metal back though inlet 24 to the source of molten metal<br>
connected to the inlet. Subsequently reversing all phase vectors back to the directions<br>
shown in FIG. 4 (b) will create a magnetic force that will cause molten metal to rise up in<br>
the riser annular volume. This jogging motion of molten metal will prevent freezing of<br><br>
molten metal in the pump when it is not in use in other examples of the invention, if a<br>
three phase power supply is used, cyclically reversing two of the phases with, for<br>
example, solid state switches, can also be used to accomplish the electromagnetic jogging<br>
motion of melt in the pump. In other examples of the invention, a heating medium, such<br>
as a circulating hot gas or liquid, or an electric heating element, may be provided in the<br>
volume between thermal insulator 26 and the outer wall of outer tube 28.<br>
[0025] FIG. 5 illustrates another example of an electromagnetic pump of the present<br>
example. In this example, inlet 24a is at the bottom of the pump and molten metal is<br>
eleetromagnetically pumped direclly up riser annular volume 44 as generally described in<br>
previous examples of the invention. In this particular example since molten metal does<br>
not flow through the inner tube, the inner tube mav be a totally enclosed tube or other<br>
inner structural element that serves as a means lor containing magnetic material 46<br>
between the inner structural element and mid tube 34.<br>
[0026] Other types of power supply and distribution arrangements are contemplated<br>
within the scope of the invention. For example, multiple single phase power supplies may<br>
be used; each coil may be powered by an individual power supply; or separate power<br>
supplies may power individual groups of coils. Further although in the above examples of<br>
the invention the inner, mid and outer tubes have their longitudinal axes vertically<br>
oriented, the longitudinal axes of the tubes may be otherwise oriented without deviating<br>
from the scope of the invention.<br>
[ 0027] The examples of the invention include reference to specific electrical components.<br>
One skilled in the art may practice the invention by substituting components that are not<br>
necessarily of the same type but will create the desired conditions or accomplish the<br>
desired results of the invention. I or example, single components may be substituted for<br>
multiple components or vice versa.<br>
