3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
Field Of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a current limiting resistor for a capacitor switching duty contactor. More particularly, the invention relates to a current limiting resistor for a capacitor switching duty contactor adapted to dampen the high inrush current in the capacitor switching contactor and avoids unnecessary resistor loop overlapping thus minimizing probabilities of short circuit, flashover and fire hazards.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Over the period of time capacitor bank switching contactor have been provided with resistor or inductor in series with the line to limit the inrush current during closing of the circuit. These intended resistors normally used to be insulated sleeved heater wire either in coiled form or stretched free form. In both the cases the overall panel volume of the contactor increases due to additional space required by the resistor wire.<br>
Over the years, the capacitor switching contactor has been explored in various ways. The Basic capacitor switching duty contactor consists of a Main circuit CI and a limiting circuit LI in parallel to it. Figure 3 shows such circuit. The capacitive load Cc is connected to the distribution load via the capacitor switching contactor. As the contactor switches ON, the limiting circuit is closed first through the arcing contact system Al, which leads the Main contact system Ma. The higher inrush current is limited to the desired rating through the resistor R connected in series between the main contact and arcing contact. While opening the Capacitive load Cc, the arcing contact breaks before the main contact.<br>
Commonly known conventional current limiting resistor consists of a heater wire with insulation sleeve wrapped over it. The resistor wire depending upon the KVAR rating of the contactor, are available in stretched or coiled form. The extreme end of the wires is connected with suitable lug for fitment with the standard contactor Cs and Aux. contact block Ca. Especially for the higher KVAR rating there has been frequent field complaint of resistor burning and insulation failure at the extreme end of the resistor. Thus the scope of the conventional current limiting resistor is limited to Low KVAR rated contactor. Also to<br>
2<br><br>
maintain the resistance per pole with adequate thermal mass, the length of the sleeved heater wire becomes so high that it results in increase in the overall height of the contactor. This further increases the panel volume. To a larger extent, the contactor height is reduced by means of looping the sleeved resistor in coiled form. But due to increase in the overall diameter of the loop, the clearance in the resistors between the phases reduces. Since the sleeved heater wire is flexible, they overlap with respect to each other under actual field condition; a slight pinhole in the insulation could result to a dead short circuit and flashover across the phases. For every instant of closing operation, the resister is under severe electro dynamic stress, resulting into change in the pitch of the resistor between alternate phases. The solution for this lies in providing means for securing the resistor per phase through phase barrier guards, which always maintain the desired clearance and creepage between the phases.<br>
US6285271 and FR2735279 disclose capacitor switching duty contactor, which claims about the innovative ideas for arrangement of resistor with respect to the standard contactor and aux. contact block. In both the patents, it is claimed that part of resistors are secured inside an insulating attachment housing, and remaining part is connected via input and output contact block in between the main contact and arcing contact system.<br>
US 4595812 discloses a circuit interrupter comprising a housing including a housing wall, an interrupting mechanism including a pair of separable contacts and an operating mechanism, and an optional accessory unit used in connection with an opening operation of the interrupting mechanism. The optional accessory unit may be a unit which includes a movable member operable in connection with the opening operation of the interrupting mechanism, such as an alarm switch, an auxiliary switch, a voltage trip device or an under voltage trip device. The optional accessory unit may be a connecting terminal block connectable between an external circuit and the circuit interrupter. The housing has formed in the outer surface thereof a receptacle cavity for receiving therein the optional accessory unit. When the unit is received in the cavity, no substantial portion of the unit projects from the housing. A fastening means comprises a slider, a guide rail engaging the slider for allowing a sliding<br>
3<br><br>
movement of the optional accessory unit only in the direction of extension of the guide rail, and a screw for securing the optional accessory unit to the housing wall.<br>
US 5483213 discloses an auxiliary terminal block for an electrical switching device includes a molded block and at least one terminal for terminating the internal wiring and external wiring of the switching device. The molded block has a first wiring channel for the external wiring, a second wiring channel for the internal wiring, and a partial partition between the two wiring channels. The partition has a slot for engaging and locking the terminal after the internal wiring has been terminated. The partition may include two walls having a generally constant width therebetween. Shoulders or tabs may be disposed on each of the walls for engaging and locking the terminal to the block. Alternatively, the partition may include two walls which are at least partially resilient and which form a generally V-shaped opening between the two wiring channels. A shoulder may be disposed on each of the walls for engaging and locking the terminal to the block whenever the terminal is fully inserted within the partition. The terminal may have an L-shape, a first arm which terminates the external wiring, and a second arm having a crimp terminal or solder terminal for terminating the internal wiring. The first arm may have on opposite sides thereof two notches mating with the two walls. The two notches of the first arm form a neck which is generally freely insertable within the V-shaped opening and which is generally resisted by further insertion within the V-shaped opening until the neck is fully inserted and confined within an opening adjacent the shoulders.<br>
Hence there is a need for current limiting resistor for dampening high inrush current in the capacitor switching contactor and to avoid unnecessary resistor loop overlapping thus minimizing probabilities of short circuit, flashover and fire hazards.<br>
The present inventor have found that the insulation co-ordination and secureness of the current limiting resistors per phase at the incoming and the outgoing terminals of the capacitor switching contactor can be ameliorated providing a definite ergonomical design and construction in the current limiting resistor. Such current limiting resistor is not only compact and sturdy but also being mechanically coupled with the contactor in a way maintains constant pitch through out the life cycle of the product.<br>

Another object is to avoid unnecessary resistor loop overlapping thus minimizing probabilities of short circuit, flashover and fire hazards.<br>

The former comprises means to grip-holding the windings in predetermined position on the former. The said means comprises plurality of copper terminal clamps at the top and the bottom ends of the former such that the extreme ends of the wire windings being spot-welded with the clamp remain in position. Tinned copper conductor of desired length and diameter is spot welded to the clamp at one end and the other end is crimped with fixation means which comprises insulated ring type lug. The ring type lug when terminated in contact block of any standard contactor give fixation to the protruding conducting portions of the resistor unit. The said ring type lug and the copper conductor are partially disposed in screw terminal means operatively connected to the former via the protruding conducting portion of the resistor unit.<br>
6<br><br>
The said protruding conducting portion comprises prongs, which are guided through guided insulating channel means. The insulating channel means comprises silicon fibre based glass sleeve ergonomically designed and placed in juxtaposition with the former providing desired secureness and insulation co-ordination to the prongs. The prongs are ergonomically designed in a manner that required pitch between the resistors per phase remains unaltered providing desired secureness and insulation co-ordination between phases. This also minimizes the chances of short circuit and flashover to a greater extent since the resistors between phases are arrested in all degrees of freedom.
