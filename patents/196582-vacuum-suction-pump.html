VACUUM SUCTION PUMP<br>
KIM,  IN-SEOK  of NO. 1901, SEOCHO  DONGAH  TOWER,  1321-10, SEGCHG-DGMG,  SEOCHO-KU, SEOUL 137-857, REPUBLIC  OF  KOREA, KOREAN  National  AND  KIM, YOUMG-3UN of  NO.  1901,  SEOCHO DONGAH  TOWER, 1321-18, SEGCHO-DONG, SEOCHO-KU,  SEOUL  137-857, REPUBLIC OF KOREA, KOREAN National<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it. is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
VACUUM SUCTION PUMP BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a vacuum suction pump for pumping water or a liquid of high viscosity, and more particularly to a vacuum suction pump which can be easily disassembled, thereby allowing quick repair and which can finely crush various foreign materials included in a liquid being pumped.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In general, in order to pump water or a viscous material a pumping method has been used in which the suctioned material is pumped in response to opening and closing of a hood valve, or a pumping method has been used in which an impeller with a plurality of radial vanes is rotated with a high speed by a motor, thereby pumping the suctioned material.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, a conventional vacuum suction pump, which employs the latter of the above pumping methods, comprises: a motor 101; an inner casing 1.03 secured to one side of the motor 101; a motor shaft 102, which projects outward through the inner casing 203; an outer casing 106 which is provided with an intake port 104 and a discharge port 105, the<br>
2<br><br>
outer casing 106 being engaged with the inner casing 103 in the axial direction of the motor shaft 102; and an impeller 107, which is provided with radial vanes and interposed between the inner and outer casings 103, 106, the impeller being fitted on the motor shaft 102, wherein as the motor 101 is driven, the impeller 107 rotates in cooperation with the motor 101 and generates a vacuum within the inner space defined by the inner and outer casings 103, 106, thereby suctioning the liquid through the intake port 104 and pumping the liquid through the discharge port 105.<br>
When the conventional vacuum suction pump with the above construction is required to be repaired due to the wear or damage of the impeller 107, the outer casing 106 provided with the intake and discharge ports 104, 105 should be disassembled. However, because piping lines 108, 109 attached to the intake and discharge ports 104, 105 may be moved and distorted when disassembling the outer casing 106, the piping lines 108, 109 should be separated prior to disassembling the outer casing 106 for performing the repair operation. Therefore, there is a problem in that the repair operation is complicated because the accompanying assembling and disassembling operation is troublesome.<br>
In addition, if various foreign materials largely insoluble in the liquid being pumped are suctioned, the foreign materials disturb the rotation of the impeller 107, so that the<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    3<br><br>
pumping action cannot be sufficiently produced. In this regard, even if a filter is installed on the intake side for the liquid, there has been a problem in that it is also complicated to frequently change filters and the filtered and accumulated foreign materials result in the deterioration of pumping efficiency and the overload of the motor, thereby shortening the operational life.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a vacuum suction pump, wherein intake and discharge ports are provided in an inner casing of the pump, thereby simplifying the assembling and disassembling of the pump, and wherein at least one cutting edge is formed in the impeller so that foreign materials present in the liquid being pumped may be finely crushed.<br>
In order to accomplish this object, there is provided a vacuum suction pump comprising: a motor; inner and outer casings which are provided on a side of the motor; and an impeller fitted on a shaft of the motor within a space defined by the inner and outer casings, so that the impeller and the motor cooperate to pump a liquid, wherein the inner casing is provided with intake and discharge ports, through which the<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                     4<br><br>
liquid passes inward and outward, so that only the outer casing need be disassembled and can be disassembled simply without removing piping lines connected to the intake and discharge ports when repairing the pump due to the wear or damage of the impeller.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description and drawings, the same reference numerals are used to designate the same or similar components, and so repetition of the description for the same or similar components will be omitted.<br>
FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a vacuum suction pump according to the present invention, and FIG. 2 is a partial section view of the vacuum suction pump. As shown in the drawings, an inner casing 20 is mounted on a side of a motor, which is rotatable in the forward or reverse direction like a step motor, and an outer casing 30 is detachably mounted on the inner casing 20 via a plurality of fixing members 40 such as bolts. Within a chamber defined by the assembled inner and outer casings 20, 30, an impeller is received and detachably fitted on the shaft 11 of the motor 10.<br>
Herein, the motor shaft 11 is inserted through a center hole 51 in the impeller 50 and then a key 12 is inserted into a keyway 52, thereby fixing the impeller 50.<br>
6<br><br>
A sealing member 60 such as a gasket or a sealing ring is interposed between the inner and outer casings 20, 30 for preventing the leakage of a liquid or gas and developing a vacuum in the chamber at the time of pumping.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3a, the inner casing 20 is provided with intake and discharge ports 21, 22, which- are connected to piping lines 71, 72, respectively, wherein the inner casing 20 is also formed with intake and discharge holes 23, 24, which are communicated with the intake and discharge ports' 21, 22, respectively, and a U-shaped guide groove 31, which is extended along the outer circumferential edges of the intake and discharge holes 23, 24.<br>
The outer casing 30 is formed with a U-shaped guide groove 31 in the position which corresponds to that of the U-shaped guide groove 25 formed in the inner casing 20, as shown in FIG. 3b.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4a, the impeller 50 is provided with a plurality of radial arm-shaped blades 54 which is spaced along a circular supporting hoop 53, wherein each of the arm-shaped blades 54 is provided with cutting edges 55 at the opposite sides thereof, so that volumetrically large foreign materials can be cut regardless of the rotating direction of the impeller 50.<br>
Herein, the cutting edges for cutting volumetrically large foreign materials included in the liquid may be linearly formed<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
7<br><br>
in the longitudinal direction as shown in FIG. ' 4a. Alternatively, the cutting edges 55 may be saw-toothed as shown in FIGs. 4b and 4c, so that saw teeth 57 cut foreign materials which are pushed outward due to centrifugal force generated when the impeller 50 rotates at a high speed.<br>
In the impeller 50, a plurality of compartment spaces 56, each space being defined by the circular supporting hoop 53 and two adjacent arm-shaped blades 54, is formed in such a way that the width of each compartment space is gradually broadened outward in the radial direction.<br>
Therefore, if the impeller 50 rotates, the liquid in the intake hole 23 is pushed out into the guide grooves 25, 31. As the impeller 50 is continuously rotated, the compartment spaces 56 compressively push out air from the guide grooves 25, 31 through the discharge hole 24, while passing over the discharge hole 24.<br>
The present invention works in the following manner. Firstly, if electric power is applied to the motor 10 from an external source of electric power, the motor 10 is driven and then the impeller 50 fitted on the motor shaft 11 is rotated in a high speed in cooperation with the motor 10.<br>
As the impeller 50 is rotated in a high speed, a liquid is suctioned into the intake hole, which is communicated with the intake port 21 of the inner casing 20. The liquid suctioned due to the continuous rotation of the impeller 50 flows into<br><br><br>
8 <br><br>
the discharge hole 24 via the guide grooves 25, 31 and then pumped into the discharge port 22.<br>
Herein, even if the intake system connected to the intake port 21 is filled with air rather than a liquid, the air can be compressed by the impeller 50 and then discharged through the discharge port 22. Thereby, a vacuum is generated in the intake system and thus a liquid can be vacuum-suctioned into the intake system, so that the pump may suction and pump out a liquid, even if the pump is not filled with a liquid when the pump is initially driven. Therefore, it is very simple and convenient to use the pump.<br>
In addition, because the impeller 50 is completely symmetrically shaped and the intake and discharge holes 23, 24 and the guide grooves 25, 31 have identical shapes, respectively, a liquid can be suctioned into the discharge hole 24 and then discharged through the intake hole 23 if the motor 10 is turned in reverse; the impeller 50 thus being rotated counterclockwise.<br>
Accordingly, it is convenient to use the pump, because it is possible to freely pump out a liquid by rotating the motor 10 in the forward or reverse direction as needed. Furthermore, when the pumping of a liquid is terminated, the air is pumped out and thus no liquid is left within the liquid flow system. This prevents the fluid flow system from being frozen and rupturing in winter.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                           9<br><br>
Meanwhile, when the impeller 50 is worn or damaged, it is possible to replace or repair the impeller 50 after disengaging the fixing members 40 from the inner casing 20 and removing the outer casing 30 only.<br>
Therefore, the repair operation can be simply conducted without separating the piping lines 71, 12 (e.g., hose or pipe) from the intake port 21 and discharge port 22 of the inner casing 20.<br>
The foreign materials included in the liquid, which flows into the intake port 21, are finely crushed by the cutting edges formed in the arm-shaped blades 54 of the impeller 50. Therefore, the impeller 50 can be smoothly rotated and the blockage of liquid pumping lines, which causes the deterioration of pumping action, can be avoided.<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to avoid the trouble of separating piping lines from the intake port and discharge port of a vacuum suction pump, because it is sufficient to only remove the outer casing, which is not provided with intake and discharge ports, when repairing the interior of the pump.<br>
In addition, because the cutting edges finely crush various foreign materials, which are largely insoluble in a liquid, it is possible to avoid the functional deterioration the impeller, etc., and thus to prevent the operational life of the pump from being shortened by an overload applied to the<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
           10<br><br>
motor.<br>
Although a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described for illustrative purposes, the present. invention is not limited to the embodiment, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br>
For example, although the above embodiment is described in connection with the pumping of a liquid by way of an example, it is possible to employ the present invention in an air compression pump for compressing and pumping air.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
