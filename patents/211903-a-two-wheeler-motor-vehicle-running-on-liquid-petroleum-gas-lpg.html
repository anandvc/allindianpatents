				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a two wheeler motor vehicle running on liquid petroleum gas (LPG).<br>
although the two wheeler motor vehicle proposed herein can be made to run exclusively on LPG, from the standpoint of feasibility, it is preferred to have an alternative supply of conventional fuel, such as, petrol, so that the vehicle need not come to a complete stop, should it suddenly run out of LPG supply or if LPG cylinders are not readily available. This alternative fuel supply is achieved by a selector switch arrangement similar to that employed in four wheeler motor vehicles running on LPG and on alternative conventional fuel.<br>
Use of LPG as fuel for propulsion of automobiles offers advantages of low running costs, lower emissions, longer engine life and lower maintenance costs when compared to their gasoline/diesel counterparts. LPG as fuel has also been found to be non-carcinogenic, non-lead-bearing. It has further been found that leaner mixtures of LPG can be combusted  and higher<br><br>
compression ratios can be obtained due to the higher octane number and because the fuel is in gaseous form.<br>
LPG is being commercially used in automobiles in Australia, Japan, USA, Holland, Italy, New Zealand among other countries.<br>
Efforts are being made in India, which has a huge motor vehicle population, for use of LPG in automobiles, with adequate safeguards. The LPG commercially available in India is a mixture of butane, and. propane with traces of other hydrocarbons.<br>
This invention proposes a two wheeler motor vehicle running on LPG, the vehicle being adequately protected against all hazards which are the likely outcome of storing, carrying and utilising the said gas on a highly mobile two wheeler motor vehicle which is subject to hazards, such as, skidding, toppling and impact, like collision.<br>
This invention also proposes a vehicle as aforesaid which is highly user-friendly in the<br><br><br>
operation of the LPG system including installation and replacement of LPG cylinders in the vehicle.<br>
:wo wheeler motor vehicle will be apparent from the "^^^^^J^jj^  A^ Lf Q-following further description.<br>
The two wheeler motor vehicle, according to this invention, comprises a housing, open at its top and immovably located in a cavity under the rider"s seat of the vehicle, the housing being provided with at least one vent-hole open to atmosphere;. a replaceable - LPG cylinder accommodated within the housing and securely fastened thereto; a pipeline connecting the outlet of the cylinder to the engine of the vehicle through prescribed safety devices; and means for permitting the LPG to flow through the pipeline only when the cylinder is fully fastened within the housing and the ignition switch of the vehicle is turned ON thereafter.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of<br><br>
this Invention, wherein<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the proposed vehicle in top plan view<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed vehicle in side elevation<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the hinged seat and seat base of the proposed vehicle in open.and partly closed position, with the cross-artt in open position<br>
Fig. 4 Illustrates the housing (interior) with the seat base covering the open top of the housing annd the cross-arm clamped down and fastened.<br>
Fig.  5 illustrates the LPG  cylinder-housing, assembly  with the cross-arm in  clamped-down position<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the safety electrical circuit which includes, in series, two limit switches, a solenoid valve and the ignition switch connected through a battery.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates the replaceable cylinder, diametral member and non-rotatable nut<br><br>
and<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates the layout of the selector switch arrangement.<br>
The housing H is covered by the seat base and the seat at the top HT. It is immovably located in a cavity ^ under the rider"s seat of the vehicle.<br>
The housing is made of a strong material such as steel to protect the LPG cylinder and related fittings from shocks, impact with external objects and static and dynamic loads. The housing is provided with at least one vent-hole V , which is open to atmosphere and which allows escape of LPG in the unlikely event of a gas-leak occurring. In the drawings, the housing is shown to have two vent-holes V. Each vent-hole will be provided with flame proof gauze.<br>
The LPG cylinder C is accommodated within the housing H and securely fastened thereto. -<br>
A pipeline P connects the outlet O of the cylinder to the engine E of the vehicle. The vaporizer VA and gas carburettor GC are shown connected to the<br><br>
pipeline.<br>
Means are provided for permitting the LPG to flow through the pipeline P to the engine E only when the cylinder c is fully fastened within the housing H and the ignition switch I of the vehicle is turned ON thereafter. Where provision is made for supply of alternative conventional fuel, the further requirement of flow of LPG through the pipeline P to the engine E is subject to the selector switch SW being operated to shut off such alternative supply as will hereinafter be clear.<br>
The bottom J of the cylinder C and the base M of the housing H are provided with fastening means for securely fastening the cylinder C to the said base M.<br>
One of possible forms of such fastening means is constituted by a foot-ring F provided at the bottom of the cylinder C. The foot-ring F is rigidly attached to the bottom J of the cylinder C. A diametral member D, which diametrally spans" the foot-ring F is rigidly attached thereto. To the diametral member D a nut N is fixed such that<br><br>
it is non-rotatable. To the base M of the housing H a threaded stud T is fixed. The stud T is threadedly engageable with the nut N, for enabling the bottom J of the cylinder to be securely fastened to the base M of the housing.<br>
The housing H is provided with a pivotably movable cross-arm A (pivoted at L) for being clamped down on the top Q of the cylinder C, to totally restrain movement of the cylinder in any direction. The cross-arm is securely fastened to the housing by a bolt G.<br>
One of possible means for permitting the LP6 to flow through the pipeline P to the engine will now be described:<br>
A first normally-open limit switch SI is provided within the housing H near its base M for coming into pressure-contact with the bottom J of the cylinder, whenever the cylinder occupies its lowermost position, after the nut N and threaded stud T are fully fastened.<br>
A second normally-open limit switch 32 is provided within the housing near the top Q of the cylinder<br><br>
for coming into pressure-contact with the cross arm A after it has been fully clamped down 6n the top Q of the cylinder. A normally-closed solenoid valve Z is provided for the pipeline P, the limit switches SI, S2 and the solenoid valve Z being included, in series, in the electrical circuit of the ignition switch I of the vehicle. The arrangement is such that when the limit switches Si, S2 are actuated to close, on achieving pressure-contact with the bottom J of the cylinder and with the cross arm A respectively; and when the ignition switch I is turned ON, the said circuit is closed to energise the normally-closed solenoid valve Z to open, once open, LPG from the cylinder C flows through the pipeline P to the engine, subject to the action of the selector switch in cases where provision is made for alternative conventional fuel supply.<br>
The outlet o of the cylinder C is provided with a coupling R for connection to the pipeline P, the coupling being disposed horizontally so that the pipeline can also run horizontally within the housing and thus save housing space.<br><br>
The housing H is immovably located in the cavity K by securely attaching it to the surrounding framework of the vehicle.<br>
The base U of the rider"s seat Y rests on the open top HT of the housing to serve as a cover. The housing is uncovered, whenever required, to obtain access to the interior by raising the said seat.<br>
The base U of the rider"s seat is sufficiently rigid to provide adequate structural strength thereto. Such rigidity is obtained, for example, by providing a thick strong plastic sheet on the said base.<br>
As stated earlier, whenever there is provision for an alternative conventional fuel supply the system proposed herein will work on LPG only if, in addition to the conditions stated herein, the conventional fuel supply is shut off by the selector switch SW. So also, the system will work on conventional fuel supply only if, thfe LPG supply is shut off by the selector switch. Conveniently, the selector switch will be placed within the housing or any other suitable safe<br><br>
location, for safety.<br>
The rider"s seat is hinged at W and the seat is also provided with a lock so that it cannot be raised, by unauthorised persons, to expose the interior of the housing.<br>
In the drawings the excess flow cum shut off valve and the pressure relief valve provided for the cylinder are indicated by EF and PR respectively. The gasoline tank is indicated by GT and the gasoline solenoid valve is indicated by GS.<br>
The terms and expressions in thld specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention, in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the proposed two wheeler are possible, without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
