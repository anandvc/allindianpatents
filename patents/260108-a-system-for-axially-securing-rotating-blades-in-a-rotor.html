Description<br>
Arrangement for axially securing rotating blades in a rotor,<br>
sealing element for such an arrangement, and use of such an<br>
arrangement<br>
The invention relates to an arrangement for axially securing<br>
rotating blades in a rotor, comprising a shaft collar, on whose<br>
outer circumference rotating-blade retaining slots running in<br>
the axial direction of the rotor are provided, in which<br>
rotating-blade retaining slots respective rotating blades<br>
having blade roots corresponding to the rotating-blade<br>
retaining slots are arranged, comprising a projection which is<br>
arranged on a front-end side face of the shaft collar in the<br>
region of the retaining slots and in which an encircling slot<br>
which is open radially outward is provided, wherein sheet-<br>
metal-like sealing elements engaging in each case in the<br>
encircling slot are provided for axially securing the rotating<br>
blades, said sealing elements forming a front-end sealing ring<br>
in the circumferential direction, wherein, to secure the<br>
sealing elements against a displacement in the circumferential<br>
direction, at least one of the sealing elements comprises a<br>
sheet-metal strip fastened to said sealing element. The<br>
invention also relates to the use of such an arrangement and to<br>
a sealing element having a sheet-metal strip fastened to said<br>
sealing element.<br>
Rotors of gas turbines are known in which turbine rotating<br>
blades arranged at the outer circumference in rotating-blade<br>
retaining slots are secured against axial displacement by means<br>
of sealing plates.<br>
To this end, different constructions are known from the prior<br>
art. For example, GB 954,323 shows an arrangement of sealing<br>
plates of the generic type on a rotor. To secure the moving<br>
blades against an axial displacement inside their retaining<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- la -<br>
2 005P16096WOUSDIE/KR<br>
slot, sealing plates are provided which are hooked both to the<br>
rotor disk and to the platform underside of the rotating<br>
blades. On account of<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 2 -<br>
2005P1609 6WOUSDIE/KR<br>
the construction selected, a sealing plate lock is necessary,<br>
which has to be inserted last into the rotor slots in order to<br>
complete the ring of sealing plates. In this case, two sealing<br>
plate halves which are split transversely to the radial<br>
direction are provided. The two sealing plate halves and the<br>
adjacent sealing elements directly to the left and right of<br>
them are secured against detachment by means of a sheet-metal<br>
strip which can be placed against the sealing plate halves and<br>
can be secured in the sealing plate ring by two auxiliary<br>
elements.<br>
Furthermore, GB 2 043 796 and GB 1 209 419 disclose different<br>
sealing plate fastenings which are in each case restrained with<br>
the rotor disk via a screw or bolt on said rotor disk.<br>
In addition, fig. 1 shows a further known fastening of sealing<br>
plates on rotor disks in plan view and fig. 2 shows such a<br>
fastening in cross section along section line II-II in fig. 1.<br>
Two adjacent sealing plates 16 are provided for each rotating<br>
blade 14 to be secured against an axial displacement inside its<br>
rotating-blade retaining slot 12, said sealing plates 16 each<br>
covering half the front-end opening of the rotating-blade<br>
retaining slot 12. Each sealing plate 16 is inserted at its<br>
radially inner end 18 in a slot 2 0 provided at the front end on<br>
a rotor disk 19 and at its radially outer end 22 in a securing<br>
slot 24 which is provided on the underside 26 of a platform 28<br>
of the rotating blade 14. In order to secure each sealing plate<br>
16 against a displacement in the circumferential direction U, a<br>
rectilinear sheet-metal strip 3 0 extending essentially in the<br>
radial direction of the rotor 23 is fastened to each sealing<br>
plate 16. Each sheet-metal strip 30 ends at its radially outer<br>
end 32 in an evenly converging tip 34. There are chamfered<br>
edges 3 6 on the platforms 28 of the rotating blades 14, two<br>
opposite edges 3 6 of directly adjacent rotating blades 14 in<br>
each case forming a recess 3 8 which tapers to a point and into<br>
which the tip 34 of the sheet-metal strip 30 can project<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 3 -<br>
2 005P16096WOUSDIE/KR<br>
and come into contact for securing the sealing plates 16<br>
against a displacement in the circumferential direction U.<br>
In addition, the sealing plates 16 provide for separation of<br>
two regions 37, 3 9 in which cooling air can occur on the one<br>
hand and an undesirable hot-gas flow can occur on the other<br>
hand.<br>
To fasten the sheet-metal strips 30 to the sealing plate 16,<br>
two parallel slots 40, through which the sheet-metal strip 3 0<br>
already pre-bent in a U shape is inserted, are provided in said<br>
sealing plate 16. That end 41 of the sheet-metal strip 30 which<br>
is opposite the tip 34 is bent into the position shown in fig.<br>
2 for fastening the sheet-metal strip 3 0 before the sealing<br>
plate 16 is fitted on the rotor disk 19.<br>
After the fitting of the rotating blades 14 in the rotor disks<br>
19, the sealing plates 16 together with the pre-fitted sheet-<br>
metal strips 3 0 are fitted into the endlessly encircling slot<br>
20 arranged on the rotor disk 19 and into the securing slot 24<br>
arranged on the underside 26 of the platform 28. The sealing<br>
plates 16 are positioned along the circumference of the slot 20<br>
in such a way that each sheet-metal strip 3 0 is opposite a<br>
recess 38. The tips 34 of the sheet-metal strips 30 are then<br>
bent into the recesses 38 in order to<br>
AMENDED SHEET<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 3A-<br>
2 005P1609 6WOUSDIE/KRS<br>
rule out the possibility of a displacement of the sealing<br>
plates 16 in the circumferential direction U.<br>
An object of the present invention is to specify an alternative<br>
arrangement for securing the sealing elements against a<br>
displacement threatening to take place in the circumferential<br>
direction. A further object of the invention is to provide a<br>
sealing element which can be used for this purpose and to<br>
specify the use of such an arrangement.<br>
The object relating to the arrangement for axially securing<br>
rotating blades in a rotor is achieved by the features of claim<br>
1.<br>
The invention proposes that the sheet-metal strip be of<br>
essentially L-shaped design in its extent, wherein its first<br>
leg extending in the circumferential direction is fastened to<br>
the sealing element and its second leg extending inward in the<br>
radial direction engages in a securing pocket, which securing<br>
pocket is provided in the front-end region of the shaft collar.<br>
The invention thus deviates from the previous solution in which<br>
a displacement of the sealing elements in the circumferential<br>
direction is prevented by the sheet-metal strip bearing against<br>
the rotating blades, i.e. in the region of the radially outer<br>
end of the sealing element. In contrast, the invention proposes<br>
that the sheet-metal strip engage in a securing pocket which<br>
now lies radially on the inside with respect to the sealing<br>
element and is provided on the side face or front end of the<br>
shaft collar.<br>
The invention is based on the knowledge that, if the securing<br>
pocket were to be shifted merely from radially on the outside<br>
to radially on the inside while retaining a rectilinear sheet-<br>
metal strip, the sheet-metal strip can bend up during operation<br>
of the gas turbine on account of the centrifugal force acting<br>
on it and can thus become detached from the securing pocket. In<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 3b -<br>
2 005P16096WOUSDIE/KRS<br>
order to prevent this, the invention goes one essential step<br>
further. The sheet-metal strip is no<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 4 -<br>
2 005P16096WOUSDIE/KRS<br>
longer of rectilinear design as hitherto, but rather has, in a<br>
plane essentially parallel to the sheet-metal-like sealing<br>
element, a shape bent at right angles like an L with two legs.<br>
A first leg, extending in the circumferential direction, of the<br>
sheet-metal strip is fastened to the sealing element, for<br>
example in a manner already known, and a second leg extending<br>
inward in the radial direction engages in the fitted position<br>
in the securing pocket provided on the side face of the shaft<br>
collar. On account of the bent section of the sheet-metal strip<br>
between the two legs rectilinear per se, bending-up of the<br>
sheet-metal strip due to centrifugal force during operation of<br>
the gas turbine is effectively and reliably prevented.<br>
Since both the securing of the rotating blades against an axial<br>
displacement by means of the sealing element and the design<br>
principle of the hooking of the sheet-metal strip to the<br>
sealing element through two slots provided therein have proved<br>
successful, the principle has been retained in order to<br>
continue to be able to fit and remove the rotating blades. To<br>
this end, the sealing elements are to be displaced in the<br>
circumferential direction and the sheet-metal strips are to be<br>
correspondingly bent when fitting into the securing pocket or<br>
when removing from the securing pocket. Furthermore, there are<br>
no screwed connections or pin connections, which possibly have<br>
to be bored out during dismantling.<br>
Furthermore, each sheet-metal strip bent at right angles,<br>
compared with the sheet-metal strips known from the prior art,<br>
sits at a noncritical point for the sealing elements and thus<br>
improves the buckling behavior of the sealing elements. In<br>
addition, the temperature occurring at the sealing element<br>
during operation of the gas turbine decreases with decreasing<br>
radius, a factor which can be essentially attributed to the<br>
lower intake of hot gas at this point. Since the sheet-metal<br>
strips are now provided at the inner radius, and not as<br>
hitherto at the outer radius, of the sealing element,  said<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 4a -<br>
2 005P16 09 6WOUSDIE/KRS<br>
sheet-metal strips are also advantageously<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 5 -<br>
2 005P1609 6WOUSDIE/KRS<br>
subjected to a lower temperature. This leads to increased and<br>
improved rigidity of the sheet-metal strip and to a prolonged<br>
service life. In addition, due to the bending process, i.e.<br>
when the sheet-metal strips are being bent into the securing<br>
pocket, compressive stresses are introduced at the points of<br>
the sheet-metal strip subjected to the highest load during<br>
operation of the gas turbine, and these compressive stresses<br>
are superimposed with tensile stresses during the operation of<br>
the gas turbine and therefore at least partly neutralize one<br>
another. In the prior art, tensile stresses have been<br>
superimposed here in an adverse manner.<br>
Furthermore, once the sealing elements have been used and then<br>
removed, the construction enables said sealing elements to be<br>
used again, only the sheet-metal strips then having to be<br>
renewed.<br>
A further advantage of the subject matter according to the<br>
invention is that each rotating blade can be secured merely by<br>
one sealing element assigned to it, such that, during an<br>
exchange of an individual rotating blade of the blade ring,<br>
only one sealing element now has to be removed and not two<br>
sealing plates as in the closest prior art. This reduces the<br>
duration of maintenance work and downtimes of the gas turbine<br>
thus equipped.<br>
Advantageous configurations are specified in the subclaims.<br>
It has turned out to be especially advantageous if at least<br>
every second sealing element or every sealing element has a<br>
sheet-metal strip of identical construction to the sheet-metal<br>
strip and intended for securing against its displacement in the<br>
circumferential direction. Therefore the sealing ring formed by<br>
all the sealing elements is secured against a displacement in<br>
the circumferential direction at a plurality of positions<br>
distributed over the circumference.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 6 -<br>
2 005P16 09 6WOUSDIE/KRS<br>
In a development, the side regions of the second leg of each<br>
sheet-metal strip bear against the respective side walls,<br>
extending in the radial direction, of the securing pocket,<br>
which constitutes an effective measure against a displacement<br>
of the sealing elements in the circumferential direction. It is<br>
especially advantageous if the slot encircling at the front<br>
end, in which slot the sealing elements are held radially on<br>
the inside, is arranged radially further on the inside with<br>
respect to the rotating-blade retaining slots. A cost-<br>
effective, endlessly encircling slot which is especially simple<br>
to produce can therefore be obtained during the production of<br>
the shaft collar.<br>
According to a further configuration, the securing pocket which<br>
is provided on the end face of the shaft collar is formed by<br>
two spaced-apart teeth which are arranged at the front end and<br>
extend radially outward.<br>
A securing slot which is arranged in each rotating blade and in<br>
which the sealing element can engage radially outward is<br>
expediently provided on an underside of a platform of the<br>
rotating blade. In this way, the sealing element is securely<br>
fixed and positioned at two radially spaced-apart points.<br>
The shaft collar is expediently formed by a rotor disk.<br>
In an alternative configuration, the slot encircling at the<br>
front end is arranged radially at the level of the rotating-<br>
blade retaining slots. A further slot which is open outward is<br>
provided radially further on the inside, the sealing element<br>
engaging in both slots and in addition bearing against the root<br>
of the rotating blade at the front end. In this way, reliable<br>
hooking of the sealing element at at least two radially spaced-<br>
apart points is achieved, such that a force occurring in the<br>
axial direction due to the displacement of the rotating blade<br>
can be reliably compensated by the sealing element.<br><br>

The object which relates to the sealing element is achieved by<br>
the features of claim 9. The advantages resulting for the<br>
sealing element correspond to the advantages of the<br>
arrangement.<br>
The arrangement is used in an especially advantageous manner in<br>
an axial-flow, stationary gas turbine whose rotating blades<br>
arranged on the rotor are each secured against an axial<br>
displacement by sealing elements.<br>
The invention is explained with reference to an exemplary<br>
embodiment shown in a drawing. Further advantages and features<br>
follow from the explanation.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the arrangement for axially securing rotating<br>
blades in a rotor according to the prior art,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the cross-sectional view according to fig. 1 along<br>
section line II-II,<br>
Fig. 3 shows the sealing element according to the invention in<br>
a plan view, and<br>
Fig. 4 shows, in an alternative configuration, a further<br>
sealing element according to the invention in cross<br>
section.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a detail of the front-end plan view of the shaft<br>
collar 21, formed by a rotor disk 19, of a rotor 23 of a gas<br>
turbine. At its outer circumference 52, the rotor 23, which is<br>
rotatable about the rotation axis 50, has rotating-blade<br>
retaining slots 12 which are distributed over the circumference<br>
U and extend in the axial direction and into which a respective<br>
rotating blade 14 having a blade root 54 designed to correspond<br>
to the rotating-blade retaining slot 12 can be pushed. A<br>
rotating blade 14 is already<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 8 -<br>
2 005P16096WOUSDIE/KRS<br>
pushed into place in the rotating-blade retaining slot 12 shown<br>
centrally in fig. 3. As in the prior art shown in figs 1 and 2,<br>
an axially extending projection 58 or widened portion having an<br>
encircling slot 2 0 which is open radially outward therein is<br>
arranged on a front end of the rotor disk 19 or on a front-end<br>
side face 56 of the shaft collar 21. The slot 20 is arranged,<br>
for example, radially further on the inside than the rotating-<br>
blade retaining slots 12. The rotating blade 14 has a platform<br>
2 8 which is arranged between the blade root 54 and the profiled<br>
airfoil and on whose underside a securing slot 24, open toward<br>
the encircling slot 20, is provided and is at the same time<br>
located opposite the latter. In a manner analogous to the prior<br>
art, a sealing element 42 is inserted into the endlessly<br>
encircling slot 20 and into the securing slot 24, said sealing<br>
element securing the rotating blade 14 against a displacement<br>
along the rotating-blade retaining slot.<br>
In contrast to the closest prior art, each sealing element 42,<br>
as shown in fig. 3, completely covers the front-end opening of<br>
one of the rotating-blade retaining slots 12 and thus secures<br>
in each case the relevant rotating blade 14 against a<br>
displacement along the rotating-blade retaining slot 12.<br>
If necessary, as in the prior art, the sealing elements 42 may<br>
also be distributed over the circumference in such a way that<br>
one half of each sealing element 42 secures one of the rotating<br>
blades 14.<br>
As in the prior art, a fully fitted ring of sealing elements 42<br>
forms a sealing ring which separates a region 37 through which<br>
a coolant can flow from a further region 39 in which a hot gas<br>
can possibly appear.<br>
In order to secure the sealing element 42 against a<br>
displacement in the circumferential direction U, said sealing<br>
element 42 comprises<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 9 -<br>
2 005P1609 6WOUSDIE/KRS<br>
a sheet-metal strip 60. The sheet-metal strip 60 is preferably<br>
provided at the inner end 61 of the sealing element 42 and, in<br>
an identical manner as in the prior art, is fastened to the<br>
sealing element 42. In deviation from the prior art, however,<br>
the slots 40 necessary for this purpose and provided in the<br>
sealing element 42 extend in the radial direction. The sheet-<br>
metal strip 60 passed through these slots 40 and thus hooked to<br>
the sealing element 42 is bent at right angles and is therefore<br>
of essentially L-shaped design, provided the sheet-metal strip<br>
60 is viewed in a plane essentially parallel to the sheet-<br>
metal-like sealing element 42. In its extent, it has a first<br>
leg 62 which extends in the circumferential direction U of the<br>
rotor 23 and with which the sheet-metal strip 60 is fastened to<br>
the sealing element 42. The second leg 64, extending inward in<br>
the radial direction, of the sheet-metal strip 60 engages in a<br>
securing pocket 66 which is provided on the side face 56 of the<br>
shaft collar 21. On account of the shape of the sheet-metal<br>
strip 60 bent at right angles and of its comparatively short<br>
second leg 64, bending-up of the displacement securing<br>
arrangement under centrifugal force can be avoided.<br>
The securing pocket 66 is formed by two spaced-apart teeth 68<br>
which project radially outward on the outer edge of the<br>
projection 58. Of course, the securing pocket 66 could also be<br>
formed by a recess 69, given a corresponding length of the<br>
second leg 64.<br>
Since the side regions of the second leg 64 bear against the<br>
side walls, in each case extending in the radial direction, of<br>
the securing pocket 66 or against the teeth 68, the sealing<br>
element 42 according to the invention is reliably secured<br>
against displacement in the circumferential direction U.<br>
Although not shown, every second sealing element or also every<br>
sealing element of the sealing ring can be secured by a sheet-<br>
metal strip 60 against a displacement along<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/065512	- 10 -<br>
2 005P1609 6WOUSDIE/KRS<br>
the slot 20.<br>
In an alternative configuration,  fig. 4 shows the slot 20,<br>
encircling at the front end,  radially at the level of the<br>
rotating-blade retaining slots 12.  Radially further on the<br>
inside, a further slot 70 which is open outward is provided in<br>
a region adjacent to the shaft collar 21, for example in an<br>
adjacent rotor disk 72. The sealing element 42 is inserted into<br>
the inner slot 7 0 and has a hook 71 on its surface facing the<br>
shaft collar, said hook 71 engaging in the outer slot 20. In<br>
the process, it bears with its outer end 75 against the root 73<br>
and/or against the neck of the rotating blade 14 at the front<br>
end. In order to obtain an especially favorable configuration,<br>
the distance, as viewed in the radial direction, between the<br>
slot 2 0 and the point at which the sealing element 42 bears<br>
against the root 73 is substantially smaller than the distance<br>
of the slot 20 from the further slot 70. The force acting in<br>
the axial  direction on the sealing element  42  from the<br>
displacement of the rotating blade 14 therefore acts over a<br>
short distance or lever relative to the "pivot point" in the<br>
region of the slot 20. The long distance or lever, which in<br>
addition is locally thickened in section 74 for stiffening, is<br>
provided in order to produce a sufficient counterforce in a<br>
simple manner. In this case, the sealing element 42 is secured<br>
against displacement in the circumferential direction in a<br>
manner analogous to the configuration shown in fig. 3, the<br>
teeth for reinforcing the front-end region of the shaft collar<br>
21 being provided on the adjacent rotor disk 72.<br>
On the whole, a novel arrangement 10 and securing of the<br>
sealing elements is specified by the invention, in which the<br>
sheet-metal strips provided for preventing a displacement of<br>
the sealing elements in the circumferential direction are of L-<br>
like shape and are supported on the rotor disk in the region of<br>
the radially inner end of the sealing element.<br><br>
