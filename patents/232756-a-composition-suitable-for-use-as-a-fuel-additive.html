				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to fuel additives.  There is a need to reduce the type and amount of harmful pollutants formed in the combustion process of an internal combustion engine.  In an internal combustion engine, on Complete combustion, hydrocarbon fuels produce carbon dioxide and water vapour.  However, in most combustion systems the reactions are incomplete, resulting in unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide formation.  Moreover, particulates may be emitted as unburnt carbon in the form of soot.  Impurities in the fuel are also emitted in the form of oxides, typically sulphur oxides.  Furthermore, in the high temperature zone of the combustion system, atmospheric and fuel bonded nitrogen is oxidised to nitrogen oxides, mainly nitrogen oxides and nitrogen dioxide .<br>
The desired goal of reducing the amount of fall groups of pollutants especially HC, Pm and NOX is very difficult to achieve due to the mutually contradictory nature of the formation of these pollutants i.e. to prevent NOX formation requires a depletion of oxygen and to prevent HC, Pm requires an abundance of oxygen. It will be appreciated that it is very difficult  to establish the characteristics which are likely to enhance combustion of the fuel because of the complex nature of the combustion process.  However, to achieve a better understanding of the combustion process it is convenient to model the process into three distinct zones, namely a preheat zone, the true reaction zone and a recombination zone.  Degradation of the fuel occurs in the preheat zone where the fuel fragments leaving the zone generally comprise mainly of lower hydrocarbons, olefins and hydrogen.  In the initial stages of the reaction zone the radical concentration is very high and oxidation proceeds mainly to CO and OH.  Also in this region many other species are competing for the available atomic oxygen i.e.<br><br>
NO, SO and S02.  The CO and OH species are thermodynamically favoured in reaction with oxygen to convert into C02 and H20 and so these reactions will be essentially complete in the early stages of the flame.  If initiation occurs near the beginning of the redaction zone this will allow OH and CO species greater time to react with the available oxygen.<br>
However, shortening the ignition-delay time will allow all other species to give greater time for reaction. This would increase harmful oxide emissions - especially so in modern lean burn engines with retarded injection.<br>
Over recent years, great emphasis has been placed on reducing the regulated and visible emission.  Thus, in general, research has been directed at reducing the size of the particulates which are emitted.  While size does, of course, have an effect on the visibility of these particulates, the number of particulates is now realised to have an effect both on performance and also health.<br>
Thus particle number has been linked to a decline in crank case oil performance.  Vehicles with more advanced emission technologies such as higher injection pressures produce higher levels of soot in the lubricant.  High levels have been identified as the main contributor to viscosity increase and wear and this will, in consequence, lead to higher fuel consumption and associated emissions.<br>
The health effects associated with particulate levels have in many epidemiological studies shown significant association with a variety of human health end points, including mortality, hospital admissions, respiratory symptoms, etc.  The U.S. six cities study showed a consistent and statistically significant relationship to acute mortality and fine particles (below 2.5 microns) (PM2 5) concentrations.  Although, much research work is needed to understand the underlying biological mechanism of the association, it is nevertheless quite apparent that particle number concentration and size does have a<br><br>
significant health effect.  Reduction of total particle number would significantly improve air quality in terms of its health effects.<br>
A number of approaches to improve the emissions have already been adopted with varying degrees of cost, applicability and success.  However, the most desired and widely applicable approach involve the "clean diesel" fuels at the current specifications i.e. EM590 that produce regulated emissions under standard test cycles.  The "city diesel" fuel contains only 0.0003% sulphur.<br>
To achieve this objective, the most convenient and versatile approach is to use fuel additives.  Already, additive packages of varying performance are increasingly used in many European diesel fuels.  These additive packages give the fuel formulator added degrees of freedom in obtaining the designed fuel characteristics and performance.  As refining practices become more constrained, fuel additives will play an increasing role in ensuring that the fully formulated fuel meets and exceeds the legislative emission requirements.<br>
However, most fuel additives used at present are functional i.e. injector cleaners, corrosion inhibitors, lubricity modifiers, etc. and do not directly influence the combustion process where the emissions are essentially produced.  Those additives which have claimed performance in the combustion system have not conclusively demonstrated their effect or are metallic based.  It is apparent, though, that metallic additives are not the preferred route due to growing evidence of their deleterious effect on exhaust oxygen cells and OBD systems.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a fuel additive which affects the combustion process and thereby reduces the number of particles emitted.  According to the present invention there is provided a composition which comprises at least 40% by volume of a paraffin which is n-hexane and/or n-heptane, 1 to 20% by volume of at<br><br>
least one aliphatic amine and at least 5% by volume of a<br>
cyclic hydrocarbon which has at least 5 carbon atoms and is<br>
liquid at 20°C, said aliphatic amine and said cyclic<br>
hydrocarbon having boiling points less than that of said<br>
paraffin.	<br>
The principal component of the additive comprises n-hexane or n-heptane, straight chain hydrocarbons.  The use of C6-C7 hydrocarbons is very specific; thus the use of higher homologues is less advantageous.<br>
The aliphatic amine used in the present invention is typically a monoamine or a diamine, which is typically primary or secondary.  It will generally have 3 to 8, especially 3 to 6, carbon atoms.  The number of nitrogen atoms will generally not exceed 2.  Preferred amines include secondary monoamines and primary diamines, the former being especially preferred.  Diisobutylamine is particularly suitable.  Other suitable monoamines which may be employed include isopropyl amine and tertiary butyl amine.  These amines will typically have a boiling point from 25 to 80°C, more preferably from 40 to 60°C but this depend to some extent on the paraffin used which generally has a boiling point no greater than 200°C and preferably no greater than 160°C.  The amine is present in an amount from 1 to 20% by volume.  Generally at least 1.5%, preferably at least 2.5%, by volume is present.    A preferred concentration range is 1.5 to 10%, especially 2.5 to 5%, by volume.<br>
The preferred cyclic hydrocarbons used in the present invention have 6 carbon atoms.  They are preferably saturated.  Cyclohexane is especially preferred although aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene can be employed although are generally more expensive.  As indicated, the cyclic hydrocarbon is present in an amount of at least 5% by volume, typically 10 to 30% and especially 15 to 25% by volume.<br>
The paraffin is present in an amount of at least 40%<br><br>
by volume, typically 50 to 75% and preferably 55 to 65%. It has been found that it can be advantageous to use a mixture of hexane and heptane.  In such circumstances the hexane generally predominates such that it represents typically 30 to 40% by volume of the composition while the heptane represents 20 to 30% by volume of the composition.<br>
It will be appreciated that, in general, the composition of the present invention is in the form of a liquid solution.<br>
Higher homologues can also be used provided that they are liquid at 20°C.<br>
In addition, the composition can contain other ingredients, typically petroleum spirit or kerosene. Desirably, concentration of these additives does not exceed 20% by volume.  Such additives generally act as a carrier for the other ingredients.  There is no need for any metal-containing compounds in the composition.  The presence of alcohols is generally undesirable.<br>
A particularly preferred composition for use in the present invention is as follows:<br>
n-hexane        35%<br>
n-heptane        25%<br>
cyclohexane      20%<br>
diisobutylamine   3.5%<br>
petroleum spirit 16.5%.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the use of the compositions of this invention to diesel fuel can reduce the number of particles emitted on combustion very significantly.<br>
The additive composition of the present invention may be included by the supplier of the fuel or it may be supplied in a package to be incorporated at a later stage, for example at the retail site.  In general the additive will be employed at a treat rate of from 1:100 to 1:10,000 and preferably from 1:500 to 1:5,000, parts by volume of fuel, depending on the nature of the fuel.  Accordingly,<br><br>
the present invention also provides a fuel which comprises the additive composition of the present invention.<br>
Although the present invention is not bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the hexane and heptane will initiate the combustion reaction while the cyclic hydrocarbon will control the reaction.<br>
The present invention relates to a composition suitable for use as a fuel additive which comprises at least 40% by volume of a paraffin which is n-hexane and/or n-heptane, 1% to 20% by volume of at least one aliphatic amine and at least 5% by volume of a cyclic hydrocarbon which has at least five carbon atoms and is liquid at 20°C, said aliphatic amine and said cyclic hydrocarbon having boiling points less than that of said paraffin.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Particle Size and Distribution<br>
An investigation using the single cylinder Proteus engine (see Table II for technical data) was carried out to examine the influence of the additive of the invention on reducing the total number of particles.

Measurement Techniques<br>
Aerodynamic Diameter<br>
The aerodynamic equivalent diameter is defined as the diameter of a unit density sphere having the same gravitational settling velocity as the particle under<br><br>
analysis.  It is measured by time of flight analysers based on the assumption that particle inertia is directly linked to its size.  Thus by accelerating particles under subsonic conditions and recording particle transit times the transit aerodynamic size can be determined.  This measurement is generally used for particles between 0.lµm and 10µm.<br>
The Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS)<br>
The Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) functions on the basis of the movement of gas-borne or aerosol borne particles possessing an electrical charge towards an electrode.<br>
Particles entering the SMPS first pass through an impact ion stage to remove any particles larger than 1µm. The aerosol stream then enters a neutraliser where the particles are assigned charges.  The positively charged particles then enter the electrostatic classifier.  A given particles mobility within an electric field is proportional to its size.<br>
The SMPS is generally used for measurement of particles between lOnm and 450nm.<br>
Results<br>
The data developed in the Proteus engine demonstrates that the additive of the invention reduces the total number of particles by over 80% compared to base fuel for particles in the range of lOnm to 450nm and by over 50% for particles in the range 0.45µm to 4µm.  This is a significant reduction.  The results for particles in the range of lOnm to 450nm are shown in Figure 2.  The results for particles in the range of 0.45µm to 4µm are shown in Figure 3.<br><br>
