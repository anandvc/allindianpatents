				<td>CAMSHAFT PHASER POSITION CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to engine control and, more<br>
particularly, to camshaft position detection and control.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0003] A camshaft actuates valves of an internal combustion engine.<br>
In a dual overhead camshaft configuration, the engine includes an exhaust<br>
camshaft and an intake camshaft for each bank of cylinders. Rotation of the<br>
camshafts actuates intake and exhaust valves of the engine. Position and timing<br>
between a crankshaft and the camshafts are adjusted for proper synchronization<br>
of spark ignition and fuel injection, which improves engine efficiency in fuel<br>
consumption and pollutant exhaustion.<br>
[0004] An engine control system may include one or more camshaft<br>
phasing devices (cam phasors). A cam phasor may be used to create a<br>
continuously variable rotational offset between the exhaust camshaft and the<br>
 <br>
intake camshaft and/or the crankshaft, which alters opening and closing time<br>
between intake and exhaust valves. Typically, cam phasors receive position and<br>
timing information from a camshaft position sensor. The camshaft position<br>
sensor sends a signal to a control module. The control module develops an<br>
offset signal with respect to a commanded position signal, to control the cam<br>
phasors.<br>
[0005] A cam phasor based control system typically includes a<br>
hydraulic actuator and control valve. The control valve is used to adjust passage<br>
of hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic actuator based on a position command signal<br>
and a current camshaft position signal. Viscosity and pressure of the hydraulic<br>
fluid can vary, which affects dynamic control performance. Cam phasor based<br>
control systems tend to be sensitive to variations in engine oil temperature, age<br>
and pressure, as well as noise due to position sensor variations. The control<br>
systems also tend to have varying response times. This can negatively affect<br>
engine performance.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] A camshaft phasor control system for an engine is provided that<br>
includes a position control module. The position control module generates a<br>
position control signal based on a camshaft position signal and a gain signal. A<br>
gain calculation circuit generates the gain signal based on the position control<br>
signal and feeds the gain signal back to the position control module. The<br>
 <br>
position control module positions a camshaft of the engine based on the gain<br>
signal.<br>
[0007] In another feature, a method of operating a camshaft phasor<br>
control system for an engine is provided that includes generation of a position<br>
control signal. The position control signal is generated based on a camshaft<br>
position error signal and a gain signal. The gain signal is generated based on<br>
feedback of the position control signal. A camshaft of the engine is positioned<br>
based on the gain signal.<br>
[0008] In still another feature, a control system for an engine that<br>
includes a camshaft is provided. A camshaft sensor generates a camshaft signal<br>
that is indicative of position of the camshaft. A main control module generates a<br>
camshaft position command signal. A position control module generates a<br>
position control signal based on the camshaft signal, the camshaft position<br>
command signal and a gain signal. A gain calculation circuit receives the<br>
position control signal and generates the gain signal based on the position<br>
control signal. The position control module generates the position control signal<br>
to position the camshaft based on the gain signal.<br>

description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. As used herein,<br>
the term module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an<br>
electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that<br>
 <br>
execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic<br>
circuit, or any other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings<br>
to identify similar elements.<br>
[0017] Referring now to FIG. 1, a functional block diagram of an engine<br>
control system 10 that incorporates a camshaft phasor control system 12 is<br>
shown. An engine control system 10 includes an engine 14 that has one or more<br>
camshafts 16, 18. Position of the camshafts 16, 18 is controlled via the camshaft<br>
phasor control system 12. The camshaft phasor control system 12 is tuned<br>
based on known camshaft phasor control circuit characteristics and closed loop<br>
system performance, which maybe obtained from engine performance<br>
improvement information.<br>
[0018] The camshaft phasor system characteristics may include gain,<br>
time constants, delay times, and other camshaft phasor characteristics. The<br>
engine performance improvement information may refer to camshaft and<br>
crankshaft position information, spark ignition, fuel injection, air flow, and other<br>
engine performance parameters. The camshaft phasor control system 12 has<br>
scheduled gains for control of one or more camshaft phasors to provide closed<br>
loop phase and gain margins that satisfy a given robustness criteria.<br>
[0019] The control systems are easily and quickly tuned due to prior<br>
knowledge of the camshaft phasor system characteristics and closed loop<br>
performance. The tuning can be performed without the use of trial and error<br>
selection.<br>
 <br>
[0020] In use, the engine control system 10 allows air to be drawn into<br>
an intake manifold 20 through a throttle 22. The throttle 22 regulates mass air<br>
flow into the intake manifold 20. Air within the intake manifold 20 is distributed<br>
into cylinders 24. Although a single cylinder 24 is illustrated, it is appreciated that<br>
the camshaft phasor control system 12 may be implemented in engines having<br>
any number of cylinders.<br>
[0021] An intake valve 26 selectively opens and closes to enable the<br>
air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder 24. The intake valve position is regulated by<br>
an intake camshaft 16. A piston compresses the air/fuel mixture within the<br>
cylinder 24. A spark plug 28 initiates combustion of the air/fuel mixture, driving<br>
the piston in the cylinder 24. The piston drives a crankshaft to produce drive<br>
torque. Combustion exhaust within the cylinder 24 is forced out an exhaust port<br>
when an exhaust valve 30 is in an open position. The exhaust valve position is<br>
regulated by an exhaust camshaft 30. The exhaust is treated in an exhaust<br>
system and is released to the atmosphere. Although single intake and exhaust<br>
valves 26, 30 are illustrated, it is appreciated that the engine 14 can include<br>
multiple intake and exhaust valves 26, 30 per cylinder 24.<br>
[0022] The engine system 10 further includes an intake camshaft<br>
phasor 32 and an exhaust camshaft phasor 34 that respectively regulate the<br>
rotational timing and/or lift of the intake and exhaust camshafts 16, 18. More<br>
specifically, the timing of the intake and exhaust camshafts 16, 18 can be<br>
retarded or advanced with respect to each other or with respect to a location of<br>
the piston within the cylinder 24 or crankshaft position. The intake and exhaust<br>
 <br>
camshaft phasors 32, 34 regulate the intake and exhaust camshafts 16, 18<br>
based on signal output from one or more camshaft position sensors 36. The<br>
camshaft position sensor 36 may be in the form of a camshaft phasor position<br>
sensor and measure position of an actuator. The camshaft position sensor 36<br>
can include, but is not limited to, a variable reluctance or Hall Effect sensor. The<br>
camshaft position sensor 36 transmits output signals that indicate rotational<br>
position of the intake or exhaust camshafts 16, 18. The transmission may occur<br>
when the camshaft position sensor 36 senses the passage of a spaced position<br>
marker (e.g. tooth, tab, and/or slot) on a disc or target wheel coupled to the<br>
intake or exhaust camshafts 16, 18.<br>
[0023] A main control module 40 operates the engine based on the<br>
camshaft phasor control system 12. The main control module 40 may include a<br>
position control module, a gain scheduling module, and a gain calculation<br>
module, which are best seen in FIG. 2. The main control module 40 generates<br>
control signals to regulate engine components in response to engine operating<br>
conditions. The main control module 40 generates a throttle control signal based<br>
on a position of an accelerator pedal and a throttle position signal generated by a<br>
throttle position sensor (TPS) 42. A throttle actuator adjusts the throttle position<br>
based on the throttle control signal. The throttle actuator may include a motor or<br>
a stepper motor, which provides limited and/or coarse control of the throttle<br>
position.<br>
[0024] The main control module 40 also regulates a fuel injection<br>
system 43 and the camshaft phasors 32, 34. The main control module 40<br>
 <br>
determines the positioning and timing (e.g. phase) between the intake or exhaust<br>
camshafts (intake or exhaust valves) 16, 18 and the crankshaft based on the<br>
output of the camshaft position sensor 36 and other sensors. For example, the<br>
positioning and timing may be conditioned based on a temperature signal from a<br>
hydraulic temperature sensor 45. The temperature sensor 45 may provide<br>
temperature of oil within the engine 14 and/or in a camshaft phasor control<br>
circuit, such as that shown in FIG. 2.<br>
[0025] An intake air temperature (IAT) sensor 44 is responsive to a<br>
temperature of the intake air flow and generates an intake air temperature signal.<br>
A mass airflow (MAF) sensor 46 is responsive to the mass of the intake air flow<br>
and generates a MAF signal. A manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor 48 is<br>
responsive to the pressure within the intake manifold 20 and generates a MAP<br>
signal. An engine coolant temperature sensor 50 is responsive to a coolant<br>
temperature and generates an engine temperature signal. An engine speed<br>
sensor 52 is responsive to a rotational speed of the engine 14 and generates an<br>
engine speed signal. Each of the signals generated by the sensors is received<br>
by the main control module 40.<br>
[0026] Referring now also to FIG. 2, a functional block diagram of a<br>
camshaft phasor control system 12' is shown. The camshaft phasor control<br>
system 12' may be used as part of or in replacement of the camshaft phasor<br>
control system 12. The camshaft phasor control system 12' provides control and<br>
is mathematically described as first order with integration effect and has<br>
nonlinear drifting gain. The gain may be influenced by oil temperature, oil<br>
 <br>
viscosity, oil pressure, and aeration, as well as actuator valve electrical<br>
characteristics. Because of input nonlinearity, the camshaft phasor control<br>
system 12' has scheduled gains that are derived to provide closed loop phase<br>
and gain margins that satisfy a robustness criteria.<br>
[0027] The camshaft phasor control system 12' includes a position<br>
control module 70, a camshaft phasor actuation sub-system 72, and a gain<br>
calculation module 74. The camshaft phasor control system 12' receives an error<br>
signal E based on a camshaft position command signal CMD and a camshaft<br>
position measurement signal 76, as well as multiple input signals from the gain<br>
module 74. The position command signal CMD may be generated by the main<br>
control module 40 and based on various engine parameters, such as engine<br>
speed, load or intake pressure, phasing between a camshaft and a crankshaft,<br>
and other engine parameters. The camshaft signal 76 may be generated by the<br>
camshaft sensor 36. The position command signal CMD and the camshaft signal<br>
76 are summed via a summer 78 to generate the error signal E.<br>
[0028] The position control module 70 generates a position control<br>
signal U that is representative of a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal, which is<br>
provided to the actuation sub-system 72 for camshaft position control. The<br>
position control signal U drives a hydraulic valve actuator and is converted into a<br>
PWM signal by the actuation sub-system 72.<br>
[0029] The position control module 70 may be a proportional integral<br>
derivative (PID) control module. In one embodiment, the position control module<br>
70 is in a series form, which is sometimes referred to as an interacting form, as<br>
 <br>
opposed to being in a parallel form. The series form may include proportional<br>
derivative (PD) and proportional integral (PI) control modules that are coupled in<br>
series. The series form may, as another example, include proportional, integral,<br>
and derivative portions being in series. The position control module may be in a<br>
parallel form.<br>
[0030] A limiter 80 may be coupled between the position control<br>
module 70 and the actuation sub-system 72. The limiter 80 limits and/or clips<br>
input to the actuation sub-system 72 between a minimum value and a maximum<br>
value.<br>
[0031] The actuation sub-system 72 may be referred to as a plant and<br>
may have an associated delay. The actuation sub-system 72 may include an<br>
electrohydraulic module 82, as shown, one or more control valves, an oil supply,<br>
and other electrical and hydraulic circuit components, some examples of which<br>
are shown in FIG. 3. The electrohydraulic module 82 may convert the position<br>
control signal U into the PWM signal for operation of one or more actuators or<br>
phasors. The actuation sub-system 72 may include the camshaft position sensor<br>
36 and feedback the camshaft signal 76 to the summer 78.<br>
[0032] The gain calculation circuit 74 includes a gain scheduling<br>
module 84 and a gain calculation module 86. The gain scheduling module 84<br>
includes a signal conditioner 88, a gain scheduling device 90, and a gain<br>
scheduling table 92. The signal conditioner 88 may include and/or perform as a<br>
filter, such as a low pass filter for removal of noise. The gain scheduling device<br>
90 looks up a process gain values to generate a process gain signal KpGain<br>
 <br>
based on the position control signal Uf and a temperature input signal 94. The<br>
process gain values may be looked up in the gain scheduling lookup table 92.<br>
The temperature input signal 94 may be generated by the temperature sensor<br>
45.<br>
[0033] The gain scheduling lookup table 92 correlates position control<br>
data and temperature data with process gain data. The gain scheduling lookup<br>
table 92 may be stored in a memory 96 and be accessible by the gain scheduling<br>
device 90. An example of a gain scheduling surface plot is provided in FIG. 4.<br>
Note that axis labeled PWM of the gain scheduling surface plot represents<br>
position control signal data, such as that generated by the position control<br>
module 70, and may not be actual pulse width modulated data, as that generated<br>
by the electrohydraulic module 82.<br>
[0034] The gain calculation module 86 generates a proportional gain<br>
signal Kc based on the process gain signal   The gain calculation<br>
module 86 includes multiple inputs and outputs. The gain calculation module<br>
inputs include a system raise time input 98, a system time constant input 100, a<br>
system delay input 102, a phase margin input 104, and a process gain input 106,<br>
which respectively receive a system raise time signal Tr, a system time constant<br>
signal tau, a system delay signal SysDelay, a phase margin signal Fm, and a<br>
process gain signal KpGain. The system raise time signal Tr and the phase<br>
margin signal Fm characterize closed loop performance of the position control<br>
module. The system raise time signal Tr refers to the rate at which the control<br>
 <br>
system responds and may be, for example, in the form of timing between<br>
approximately 10% and 90% of the step input. The phase margin signal Fm is<br>
based on a closed loop control system and is indicative of robustness of the<br>
position control module. The system time constant signal tau and the system<br>
delay time signal SysDelay characterize the camshaft actuation system and<br>
through gain calculation influence controller performance.<br>
[0035] Based on the stated inputs, the gain calculation module 86<br>
generates the proportional gain signal Kc, an integration time signal Tt a<br>
derivative time signal Td, and a filtered derivative signal which are provided<br>
respectively to a proportional gain output 106, an integration time output 108, a<br>
derivative time output 110, and a filtered derivative output 112.<br>
[0036] The position control module 70 includes multiple position control<br>
module inputs, which include an error input 114, a time sample input 116, a<br>
proportional gain input 118, an integration time input 120, a derivative time input<br>
122 and a filtered derivative input 124. The error input 114 receives an error<br>
signal E from the summer 78. The time sample input 116 receives a time sample<br>
signal Tsample. The time sample signal Tsample may be a predetermined and/or set<br>
parameter and used to set a sample rate of the position control module 70. The<br>
time sample signal Tsample, as an example, may be set to approximately 12.5ms.<br>
The proportional gain input 118, the integration time input 120, the derivative time<br>
input 122 and the filtered derivative input 124 are coupled to and receive a<br>
proportional gain signal Kc, an integration time signal Ti, a derivative time signal<br>
 <br>
Td and a filtered derivative time signal respectively from the proportional<br>
gain output 106, the integration time output 108, the derivative time output 110,<br>
and the filtered derivative output 112.<br>
[0037] Referring to FIG. 3, a functional block diagram illustrating an<br>
exemplary camshaft phasor actuation sub-system 72' is shown. The actuation<br>
sub-system 72' controls position of a phasor (hydraulic actuator) 130, which may<br>
include a piston 132, to provide for linear positioning thereof along a range of<br>
motion. The piston 132 may move bi-directionally. The piston 132 may move in<br>
a first direction when hydraulic fluid pressure from passage 134 is applied to a<br>
first side 136 of the piston 132. The piston 132 may move in a reverse direction<br>
of motion when fluid pressure from second passage 138 is applied to a second<br>
side 140 of the piston 132. The piston 132 moves, as influenced by hydraulic<br>
pressure applied thereto, along a sleeve attached to the phasor 130. The phasor<br>
132 varies angular relationship between an engine crankshaft 142 and camshaft<br>
144. For example, the piston 12 may be attached, via a paired block<br>
configuration or a helical spline configuration, to a toothed wheel. A chain 146<br>
may be disposed on the toothed wheel and linked to the crankshaft 142. The<br>
phasor 130 is mechanically linked to the camshaft 144.<br>
[0038] A control valve A 150 and a control valve B 152 are positioned<br>
to admit a varying quantity of hydraulic fluid through respective first and second<br>
passages 134, 138. The relative pressure applied to the sides determines the<br>
steady state position of the piston 132. Precise piston positioning along a<br>
continuum of positions within the sleeve of phasor 130 is provided through<br>
 <br>
precise control of the relative position of control valves 150 and 152. The control<br>
valves 150, 152 receive hydraulic fluid, such as conventional engine oil, from an<br>
oil supply system 154. The oil supply system 154 may include an oil pump,<br>
which draws hydraulic fluid from a reservoir and passes the fluid to an inlet side<br>
of each of the control valves 150, 152 at a regulated pressure. The control<br>
valves 150, 152 may be three-way valves that have linear and magnetic field-<br>
driven solenoids.<br>
[0039] The control valves 150, 152 are positioned based on current<br>
provided to coils 156, 158 of solenoids. In a rest position, the control valves 150,<br>
152 are positioned to vent out fluid away from the piston 132, such that position<br>
of the piston 132 is not influenced by fluid pressure. As the control valves 150,<br>
152 are actuated away from their rest positions, a portion of the vented fluid is<br>
directed to the corresponding sides and displacement of the piston 132.<br>
[0040] PWM control is provided by current control of the coils 156,<br>
158 via a PWM driver circuit 159. The PWM driver circuit converts the position<br>
control signal U into a PWM signal 163. The coils 156, 158 are activated via<br>
transistors 160, 162. The PWM signal 163 is passed to the first transistor 160 in<br>
uninverted form, and is passed in inverted form, via an inverter 164, to the<br>
second transistor 162. The PWM signal 163 may be a variable duty cycle signal<br>
and be similar to a limited and converted version of the position control signal U.<br>
The PWM signal 163 is applied to the bases of the transistors 160, 162. The<br>
inverting of the PWM signal 163 via inverter 164 provides activation of one<br>
transistor and deactivation of the transistor.<br>
 <br>
[0041] The transistors 160, 162 are connected between a low side 170<br>
of the respective coils 156, 158 and a ground reference 172. A high side 174 of<br>
the coils 156, 158 is electrically connected to a supply voltage V+. The control<br>
valves 150, 152 are held, for a given duty cycle, in a fixed position corresponding<br>
to the average current in the coils 156,158.<br>
[0042] The position of the piston 132 is detected by the camshaft<br>
position sensor 36, and may be positioned in proximity to piston 132 to sense<br>
piston displacement. The camshaft position signal 76 is feedback to a main<br>
control module 40'. The main control module 40', through execution of periodic<br>
control operations, may generate camshaft position command signals 180 to<br>
determine hydraulic lag in the actuation sub-system 72'. The PWM signals are<br>
summed with the camshaft position signal 76 and provided to a position control<br>
module 70'. The position control module 70' is coupled to a gain circuit 74' and to<br>
a PWM driver circuit 163. The PWM driver circuit 163 generates the PWM signal<br>
163 based on a position control signal U'.<br>
[0043] The position control module 70" adjusts the position control<br>
signal U' in a controlled manner to overcome hydraulic lag, to provide a<br>
responsive position control of the piston 132 without oscillation, overshoot, and/or<br>
response delay. The position control signal U' and the camshaft position<br>
command signals 180 may be generated, for example as a predetermined<br>
function incorporating engine parameters, such as engine speed, load, and<br>
intake pressure. The PWM signal 163 is generated with an appropriate phasing<br>
between the camshaft and crankshaft. As an example, a comparison between<br>
 <br>
an amount of change in the PWM signals and resulting change in the camshaft<br>
position signal 76 over a predetermined transient response period of time may be<br>
used to generate a transient response transfer function. As another example, the<br>
rate of reduction in the position error signal may indicate system responsiveness.<br>
[0044] Referring to FIG. 5, a flow diagram illustrating a method of<br>
operating a camshaft phasor control system is shown. Although the following<br>
steps are primarily described with respect to the embodiments of FIGs. 1 and 2,<br>
they may be easily modified to apply to other embodiments of the present<br>
invention. Also, the below steps are described with respect to a single camshaft<br>
and control thereof, the steps may be applied to any number of camshafts.<br>
[0045] In step 200, a main control module, such as the main control<br>
module 40, generates a camshaft position command (reference) signal to<br>
position a camshaft of an engine. An example of a camshaft position command<br>
signal is camshaft position command signal CMD.<br>
[0046] In step 202, an error signal, such as the error signal E, is<br>
generated via a summer based on a camshaft position signal and a proportional<br>
(first) gain signal. Example camshaft position signal 76 and proportional gain<br>
signal Kc are shown in FIG. 2.<br>
[0047] In step 204, a position control module, such as the position<br>
control module 70, generates a position control signal. The position control<br>
signal is generated based on the error signal, a time sample signal, the<br>
proportional gain signal, an integration time signal, a derivative time signal, and a<br>
filtered derivative signal. Examples of the stated signals are shown in FIG. 2.<br>
 <br>
[0048] In step 206, the position control signal is limited via a limiter,<br>
such as the limiter 80. In step 208, the camshaft is positioned based on the<br>
power control signal. The limited position control signal is converted to a PWM<br>
signal and used to position a phasor, such as the phasor 130. For example, the<br>
camshaft phasor circuit may position a phasor based on the received PWM<br>
limited signal.<br>
[0049] In step 210, the position control signal is signal conditioned.<br>
The position control signal is provided to a gain calculation circuit, such as the<br>
gain calculation circuit 74, in a feedback arrangement. After reception by the<br>
gain calculation circuit, the position control signal is signal conditioned and/or<br>
filtered. In step 212, a temperature signal may be generated by, for example, the<br>
temperature sensor 45. The temperature signal may be an oil or hydraulic fluid<br>
temperature signal.<br>
[0050] In step 214, a process (second) gain signal is generated based<br>
on the filtered position control signal and the temperature signal. The process<br>
gain signal may be generated via use of a lookup table, such as the gain<br>
scheduling lookup table 92, an example representation of which is provided in<br>
FIG. 4. The surface plot of FIG. 4 is of filtered position control signal data,<br>
temperature data and output process gain data. The process gain data may be<br>
predetermined and/or adjusted during vehicle operation. The process gain data<br>
may be determined based on various known engine performance parameters,<br>
known control system characteristics, and engine system device and fluid<br>
characteristics, many of which are stated above.<br>
 <br>
[0051] Referring to FIG. 2, the camshaft control system 12' has a quick<br>
and reliable response times, regardless of the magnitude of the camshaft<br>
position command signal CMD. Since a phasor is nonlinear, when in an<br>
equilibrium state, the gain associated therewith tends to remain constant. The<br>
camshaft control system 12' accounts for this situation and adjusts and increases<br>
the gain of the control module to a large value when the gain of the system or<br>
that received by the phasor is small. Conversely, when the gain of the actuation<br>
sub-system 72 is large then the gain of the position control module 70 is reduced<br>
to a small value. For example, in view of FIG. 4, when the process gain signal is<br>
low, the proportional gain signal may be increased. Arrow 215 designates a low<br>
gain area for the process gain signal KpGain.<br>
[0052] Referring again to FIG. 5, in step 216, the proportional gain<br>
signal Kc, the integration time signal 77, the derivative time signal Td, and the<br>
filtered derivative signal  are generated by a gain calculation module. The<br>
stated signals are generated based on the process gain signal and multiple input<br>
constants, such as a system raise time, a system time constant, a system delay<br>
time, and a phase margin, as shown in FIG. 2. The input constants may be set<br>
during a tuning process. The tuning process is based on known characteristics<br>
of a camshaft phasor sub-system 72 and engine performance information. In<br>
one example embodiment, the system raise time is set to approximately 0.3s, the<br>
system time constant is set to approximately 0.07s, the system delay time is set<br>
at two (2) samples or 25ms, and the phase margin is set at approximately 60°.<br>
The stated values may vary per application.<br>
<br>
 <br>
[0053] The embodiments disclosed herein provide camshaft phasor<br>
control systems that have low sensitivity to actuation sub-system 72 parameter<br>
changes due to variation in a hydraulic actuation system caused by pressure and<br>
temperature. The setting of the phase margin, as described above, provides the<br>
low sensitivity.<br>
[0054] The gain calculation module calculates the proportional gain<br>
signal for system robustness. For example, when a phasor changes due to<br>
ageing, such as when delay of the phasor or of the camshaft phasor circuit<br>
increases, the phase margin setting assures that a corresponding camshaft<br>
closed loop control system remains stable.<br>
[0055] When the position control module is a PID controller that has<br>
series form, the position control module may have a transfer function Gc(s), as<br>
shown in equation 1.<br>
 <br>
[0056] By using a series PID control module, control gain calculation<br>
equations are provided that are easily managed. Examples of two gain<br>
equations, equations 3 and 4, are provided below. Mathematically the solutions<br>
for the proportional gain signal Kc and the integration time signal 77 are easily<br>
obtainable. Although with parallel PID control modules mathematical solutions<br>
are more complicated, parallel PID control modules may be used.<br>
 <br>
[0057] The camshaft phasor system may be considered as an electro-<br>
hydraulic system, which is a first order system with an integrator. The camshaft<br>
phasor circuit may have a transfer function G(s), as shown in equation 2.<br>
 <br>
[0058] The camshaft phasor circuit may exhibit delay L, which is equal<br>
to approximately twice a time sample h. The time sample h is a computer time<br>
increment at which the control system 12' operates and may be, for example,<br>
12.5ms. The camshaft phasor circuit includes input nonlinearity that is produced<br>
by uneven oil flow rate through a phasor, which is largest due to oil temperature<br>
changes. The nonlinearity is represented by a nonlinear system gain K(u,T).<br>
Note that the symbol * in equations 1 and 2 is multiplication. The system time<br>
constant, the nonlinear system gain K(u,T), and the system delay time may be<br>
determined, for control module tuning, simulation and control module design.<br>
The system time constant, the nonlinear system gain K(u,T), and the system<br>
delay time may be determined via one identification run, per engine class.<br>
[0059] In one embodiment, the derivative time is set equal to the<br>
system time constant. The filtered derivative time, such as Td/N, may be<br>
determined with N set equal to a value between approximately 5-20. A closed<br>
loop system bandwidth wg, which is gain margin frequency, is selected to satisfy<br>
system performance, i.e. the system raise time.<br>
 <br>
[0060] With the known transfer functions Gc(s) and G(s) and the<br>
above constraints, the proportional gain signal and the integral time signal are<br>
determined using equations 3 and 4.<br>
 <br>
The logic for equations 3 and 4 may be included in the gain calculation module.<br>
The proportional gain signal and the integral time signal may be determined<br>
through substitution of equations 1 and 2 into equations 3 and 4. The phase<br>
margin is related to damping of a system and is therefore a performance<br>
measure.<br>
[0061] In step 218, a gain margin Am and a crossover frequency wp<br>
may be determined using equations 5 and 6 to verify robustness of the camshaft<br>
control system.<br>
 <br>
The gain margin Am is indicative of an amount of change of camshaft phasor<br>
circuit characteristics prior to instability in the closed loop system. A phase<br>
margin of approximately 60° and a gain margin Am of approximately 5 may be<br>
achieved. The proportional gain signal and the integration time signal and the<br>
rates of change thereof may be constantly monitored by performance and<br>
robustness measures imbedded into the gain control module. For example, the<br>
 <br>
phase margin and the gain margin Am may be continuously determined and<br>
monitored.<br>
[0062] The above-described steps may be continuously repeated. The<br>
above-described steps are meant to be illustrative examples; the steps may be<br>
performed sequentially, synchronously, simultaneously, or in a different order<br>
depending upon the application.<br>
[0063] The above described control systems have low sensitivity to<br>
noise originating from position sensor variations. The control systems allows for<br>
compensation due to movement disturbances of a camshaft without sensitivity to<br>
noise from a camshaft position sensor. Tight control of continuous variable<br>
camshaft phasing improves engine torque response and emissions, while<br>
simultaneously improving fuel economy.<br>
[0064] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification<br>
