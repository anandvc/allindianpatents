				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a detergent surfactant composition comprising mixtures of longer alkyl chain mid-chain<br>
branched surfactants derived from mid-chain branched primary alkyl hydrophobic groups and selected hydrophilic groups, said mixtures comprising mid-chain branched primary alkyl hydrophobic groups having an average of greater than 14.5 carbon atoms, preferably greater than about 15 carbon atoms, with preferred surfactants herein being mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants and mid-chain branched primary alkyl alkoxylated sulfate surfactants. Thus, the present invention relates to mixtures of mid-chain branched surfactants useful in laundry and cleaning compositions, especially granular and liquid detergent compositions. These longer alkyl chain surfactant mixtures are also suitable for formulation with other surfactants for the purpose of providing improved surfactant systems, especially for use in detergent compositions which will be used in laundry processes involving low water temperature wash conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventional detersive surfactants comprise molecules having a water-solubilizing substituent (hydrophilic group) and an oleophilic substituent (hydrophobic group). Such surfactants typically comprise hydrophilic groups such as carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate, amine oxide, polyoxyethylene, and the like, attached to an alkyl, alkenyl or alkaryl hydrophobe usually containing from about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms. Accordingly, the manufacturer of such surfactants must have access to a source of hydrophobe groups to which the desired hydrophile can be attached by chemical means. The earliest source of hydrophobe groups comprised the natural fats and oils, which were converted into soaps (i.e., carboxylate hydrophile) by saponification with base. Coconut oil and palm oil are still used to manufacture soap, as well as to manufacture the alkyl sulfate ("AS") class of surfactants. Other hydrophobes are available from petrochemicals,<br>
including alkylaled benzene which is used to manufacture alkyl benzene sulfonatc surfactants ("LAS").<br>
The literature asserts that certain branched hydrophobes can be used lo advantage in the manufacture of alkyl sulfate detersive surfactants; sec, for example, U.S. 3,480,556 to deWitt, ct al., November 25, 1969. However, it has been determined that the beta-branched surfactants described in the '556 patent are inferior with respect lo certain solubility parameters, as evidenced by their Krafft temperatures. It has further been determined that surfactants having branching towards the center of carbon chain of the hydrophobe have much lower Krafft temperatures. See: "The; Aqueous Phase Behavior of Surfactants", R.G. Laughlin, Academic Press, N.Y. (1994) p. 347. Accordingly, it has now been determined that such surfactants are preferred for use especially under cool or cold water washing conditions (e.g., 20°C-5°C).<br>
Generally, alkyl sulfatcs are well known to those skilled in the art of detersive surfactants. Alky] sulfates were developed as a functional improvement over traditional soap surfactants and have been found to possess improved solubility and surfactant characteristics. Linear alkyl sulfates are the most commonly used of the alkyl sulfute surfactants and arc the easiest to obtain. For example, long-chain linear alkyl sulfates, such as tallow alkyl sulfate, have been used in laundry detergents. However, these have significant cleaning performance limitations, especially with the trend to lower wash temperatures.<br>
Also, as noted hereinbefore, the 2-alkyl or "beta" branched alkyl sulfate are known. In addition to U.S. 3,480,556 discussed above, more recently EP 439,316, published July 31, 1991, and EP 684,300, published November 29, 1995, describe these beta-branched alkyl sulfntcs. Other reocnt .scientific papers in the nrcn of blanched alkyl sulfales include R. Varadnraj et al., J. Phys. Chein., Vol. 95, (1991), pp 1671-1676 which describes the surface tensions of a variety of "linear Guerbet" and "branched Guerbct"- class surfactants including alkyl sulfales. "Linear Gucrbet" types are essentially "Y-shaped", with 2-po.sition branching which is a long straight chain as in:wherein Z is, for example, OSO3Na. "Branched Guerbet" types are likewise 2-position branched, but also have additional branching substitution, as in:wherein Z is, for example, OS03Na. See also Varadaraj ct al,, J. Colloid and Interface Sci., Vol. 140, (1990), pp 31-34 relating to foaming data for surfactants which include C12 and C13 alkyl sulfutes containing 3 and 4 methyl branches, respectively (sec especially p. 32).<br>
Known ulkyl sulfatcs also include:<br>
1.	Primary akyl sulfates derived from alcohols made by Oxo reaction on<br>
propylone or n-butylene oligomcrs, for example ns described in U.S. Pntcnt<br>
5,245,072 assigned to Mobil Corp.<br>
2.	Primary nlkyl sulfatcs derived from oleic-containing lipids, for example the<br>
so-called "isostcaryl" types; sec EP 401,462 A, assigned to Henkel, published<br>
December 12, 1990, which describes certain isostcnryl alcohols and cthoxylatcd<br>
isostearyl alcohols and their sulfation to produce the corresponding alkyl sulfatcs<br>
such as sodium isostearyl sulfatc.<br>

from oligomerizing propylene with an acid catalyst followed by Oxo reaction;<br>
4.	Primary alkyl sulfates derived from "Neodol" or "Dobanol" process alcohols:<br>
these are Oxo products of linear internal olcfins or are Oxo products of linear alpha-<br>
olefins. The olcfms me derived by clhylene oligomcrization to form nlphn-olcfins<br>
which are used directly or are isomcri/ed to internal olcfins and metathesi/.ed to give internal olcfins of differering chain-lengths;<br>
5.	Primary alkyl sulfates derived from the use of "Ncodol" or "Dohanol" type<br>
catalysts on internal olefins derived from feedstocks which differ from those<br>
normally used to make "Ncodol" or "Dobanol" alcohols, the internal olcfins being<br>
derived from dehydrogenation of paraffins from petroleum;<br>
6.	Primary alkyl sulfates derived from conventional (e.g., high-pressure, cobalt-<br>
catalyzed) Oxo reaction on internal olefins, the internal olcfins being derived from<br>
dehydrogenation of paraffins from petroleum;	<br>
7.	Primary alkyl sulfates derived from conventional (e.g., high-pressure, cobalt-<br>
cauilyzcd) Oxo reaction on alpha-olcfms;<br>
8.	Primary alkyl sulfates derived from natural linear fatty alcohols such as those<br>
commercially available from Procter &amp; Gamble Co.;<br>
9.	Primary   alkyl   sulfates   derived   from   Ziegler  alcohols   such   as   those<br>
commercially available from Alhcrmarlc;<br>
JO. Primary alkyl sulfates derived from reaction of normal alcohols with a Gucrbet catalyst (the function of this well-known catalyst is to dchydrogcnate two moles of normal alcohol to the coircsponding aldehyde, condense them in an aldol condensation, and dehydrate the product which is an alpha, beta- unsaturated aldehyde which is then hydrogenaied to the 2-alkyl branched primary alcohol, all in one reaction "pot");<br>
11.	Primary alkyl sulfates derived from dimcrizalion of isobutylene to form<br>
2,4,4l-trimcthyl-l-pcntene   which   on   Oxo   reaction   to   the   aldehyde,   aldol<br>
dimcrization, dehydration and reduction gives alcohols;<br>
12.	Secondary alkyl sulfates derived from sulfuric acid addition to alpha- or<br>
internal- olcfins;<br>
13.	Primary alkyl sulfates derived from oxidation of paraffins by steps of (a)<br>
oxidizing the paraffin to  form  a  fatly  carboxylic acid; and  (b) reducing the<br>
carboxylie acid to the corresponding primary alcohol;<br>
14.	Secondary alkyl sul fates derived from direct oxidation of paraffins to form<br>
secondary alcohols;<br>
15.	Primary or secondary alkyl sulfates derived from various plasticizer alcohols,<br>
typically by Oxo reaction on an olefin, aldol condensation, dehydration and<br>
hydrogenation (examples of suitable Oxo catalysts aie the conventional Co, or more<br>
recently, Rh catalysts); and<br>
16.	Primary or Rcicondany alkyl sulfates other than of linear primary type, for<br>
example phytol, farnesol, isolated from natural product sources.<br>
Beyond such known alkyl sulfates, however, is a vast array of other possible alkyl sulfate compounds and mixtures whose physical properties may or may not make them useful as laundry detergent surfactants. (I)-(XI) display just some of the possible variations (the salts are depicted only as the common sodium salts).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
These structures are also useful to illustrate terminology in this field: thus, (1) is a "linear" alkyl sulfate. (I) is also a "primary" alkyl sulfate, in contrast with (VII) which is a "secondary" alkyl sulfate. (II) is also a "primary" alkyl'sulfate -but it is "branched". The branching is exclusively in the "2-pnsition" as in the so-called "linear Gucrbet" alkyl sulfates: carbon-counting by convention starts with Cl, which is the carbon atom covalcntly attached to the sulfate moiety. (III) can be used to represent any one of a scries of branched alkyl sulfates which, when c is an integer having the value 1 or greater, have only "non-2-position branching".7<br>
According to conventional wisdom, at least for linear surfactant compounds, the hydrocarbon portion needs to have at least 12 carbon atoms, preferably more, to acquire good delergency. The indices a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q can, in principle, be adjusted to accommodate this need. Compound (Vlll) is the alkyl sulfate derived from a naturally occurring branched alcohol, pliytol. Compound (IX) is a highly branched alkyl sulfate, which can, for example, be made by sulfating an alcohol derived from dimcrizing isobutylene and performing an Oxo reaction'on the product, Compound (X), when q = 14, is an isostcaryl alkyl sulfate; another so-called "isostearyl" alkyl sulfate has the general stnicturc (III) -such compounds can be made by sulfating an alcohol derived from a monomeric<br>
•   .»<br>
by product of the dimerization of oleic acid having 18 carbon atoms, i.e., d+e=14 in (III). Compound (XI) is a "neo" alkyl sulfate. (XII) and (XIII) arc substructures depicting "vicinal" (XII) and "gemma)" or "gem" (XIII) dimethyl branching, respectively, Such substructures can, in principle, occur in alkyl sulfalcs and other surfnctants. Conventional nlkyl sulfates can, moreover, be either saturated or unsaturatcd. Sodium olcyl sulfate, for example, is an unsaturated alkyl sulfate. Unsaturatcd alkyl sulfatcs such as oleyl sulfale can be relatively expensive and/or relatively incompatible with detergent formulations, especially those containing bleach.<br>
In addition to the above structural variations, complex, highly branched primary alkyl sulfate mixtures having quaternary carbon atoms in the hydrophobe arc producible, for example by sulfation of Oxo alcohol made via acid-catalyzed polygas reaction; moreover sicrcoisomcrism, possible in many branched alkyl sulfatcs, further multiplies the number of species; and commercial alkyl sulfates can contain impurities including the corresponding alcohols, inorganic salts such as sodium sulfatc, hydrocarbons, and cyclic byproducts of their synthesis.<br>
One known material is sodium isostcaryl sulfate which is a mixture of methyl and/or ethyl blanches distributed along an otherwise linear alkyl backbone wherein the total number of cnrbons in the entire molecule are about 18. This isostcaryl "mixture" is prepared in low yield from natural source feedstocks (i.e. tall oil, soy, etc.) via a process which results in branching which occurs in an uncontrolled manner, and which can vary depending upon the source of the feedstock. EP 401,462., assigned to Hcnkcl, published December 32, 1990 describes certain isostearyl alcohols and cthoxylatcd isostcaryl alcohols and their sulfation to produce the corresponding alkyl sulfates such as "sodium isoslcaryl sulfate" (CAS 34-181-82-8, sometimes referred to ns "sodium isoocladccyl sulfate").<br>
Again, while R.G, Laughlin in "The Aqueous Phase Behavior of Surfactants", Academic Press, N.Y. (1994) p. 347 describes the observation thai as branching moves a way from the 2-alkyl position towards the center of the alkyl hydrophobe there is a lowering of Krafn temperatures (for n 15% solution), such notability observations luuch nulling  about the suifactnncy of these compounds or thcir utility for incorporation into detergent compositions. In fact, both commercial pmcticc and  the published literature arc equivocal on the desirability of branching in the mid-chain region. This includes the above-noted patent publications describing the beta-branched alkyl sulfates as the desired branching, as well as Finger ct al., "I )elcrgenl alcohols - the effect of alcohol structure and molecular weight on suilaelanl ptoperties", J. Amur. Oil Chemists' Society, Vol. 44, p. 525 (1967) or Technical Bulletin, Shell Chemical Co., SC: 364-80. These references assert, with respect to delcterious structural changes possible in a lcohol sulfalcs that "moving a C113 has a small effect". Data ptcsenlcd in a table shows n decrease in cotton detui'cticy of 29% and a decrcase in foaming of 77% relative to unbianchcd primary alcuhol sulfatel fate at the C13 chainlength. Moreover JP' 721232 describes a deiergency negative for the replacement of C11 linear primary alkyl sulfatc with branched primary alkyl sulfnte of unspecified branching.<br>
In addition, K.R. Wonnulh and S. Zushma, Langmuir, Vol. 7, (1991), pp 2048-2053 describes technical studies on a number of branched alkyl sulfatcs, especially UK- "branched Gueibel" type, derived from the highly branched "Exxal" alcohols made by Exxon. 'Phase studies establish a lipophi0le ranking that is a hydrophobe tanking, as follows: highly branched a double tail &gt; mclhyl branched &gt; linear. Asscrtedly, branched suifaclants mix oil and water less effectively than linear surfactants. The efficiency ranking is linear &gt; doublo tail &gt;&gt; mclliyl branched a  highly blanched, Mom these results, it is not immediately evident which direction to take in the development of further improvements in brajichcd alkyl sulfates.<br>
Thus, going beyond simple technical theories of how to achieve cleaning supeiioi'ity of one puie surfactant compound versus another, the developer and formulator of surfactants for laundry detergents must consider a wide variety of possibilities with limited (sonic-times inconsistent) infcum-'Jlion, and then .strive to provide overall improvements in one or more of a whole array of criteria, including<br>
performance in the presence of complex mixture.s of.surfnctanl.s, trends; to low wash<br>
tcmpenituies, fomiulation changes including builders, enzymes and bleaches, various changes in consumer habits and practices, and the need for biodcgradability. In the context provided by these preliminary remarks, the development of improved alkyl sulfatcs for use in laundry detergents and cleaning products is<br>
clearly a complex challenge.   The present invention relates to improvements in such alky! sulfate surfactant compositions,<br>
As will be seen from the disclosures hereinafter, it has now unexpectedly been determined that certain relatively long-chain alkyl sulfate compositions containing mid-chain branching are preferred for use in laundry products, especially under cool or cold water washing conditions (e.g., 20°C-5°C). Preferred arc the combination of two or more of these mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants which provide a surfactant mixture that is higher in surfactancy and has better low temperature water solubility than any single branched alkyl-sulfate. The mixtures as produced comprise the mid-chain branching desirable for use In the surfactant mixtures of the present invention or the surfactant mixtures disclosed<br>
»<br>
herein can be formulated by mixing the desired amounts of individual mid-chain branched surfactants. Such superior mixtures me not limited to combinations with other mid-chain branched surfactants but (preferably) they can be suitably combined with one or more other traditional detergent surfactants (e.g., other primary alkyl sulfates; linear alkyl benzene sulfonatcs; alkyl cthoxylatcd sulfatcs; nonionic surfactants; etc.) to provide improved surfactant systems.<br>
These mid-chain branched surfactants are obtainable in relatively high purity making their commercialization cost effective for the formulator. Suitable product mixtures can be obtained from processes which utilize fossil-fuel sources. (The<br>
&gt; '* *•<br>
terms "derived from fossil fuels" or "fossil-fuel derived" herein are used to distinguish coal, natural gas, petroleum oil and other petrochemical derived, "synthetic" surfactants from those derived from living natural resources such as livestock or plants such us coconut palms).<br>
One such'process is designed to provide branched reaction products which are primarily (85%, or greater) ulpha-olefin1;, and which are then converted Into hydrophobes in on Oxo-reaction sequence. Such branched alpha-olefins contain from about 11 to about 18 (avg.) total carbon atoms and comprise a linear chain having an average length in the 10-18 region. The branching is predominantly mono-methyl, but some di-methyl and some ethyl branching may occur. Advantageously, such process results in little (1%, or less) geminal branching, i.e., little, if any, "quaternary" carbon substitution. Moreover, little (less than about 20%) vicinal branching occurs. Of course, some (ca. 20%) of the overall feedstock used in the subsequent Oxo-process may remain unbranchcd. Typically, and preferably from the standpoint of cleaning performance and biodcgradability, this process provides alphn-olefins with: an average number of branches (longest chain basis) in the 0,4-2.5 range; of the branched material, there are essentially no<br>
branches on carbons 1, 2 or on the terminal (omega) carbon of the longest chain of the branched material.<br>
Following the formation and purification of the branched-chain alpha-olefm, the feedstock is subjected to an Oxo carbonylation process. In this Oxo-step, a catalyst (e.g., conventional cobalt carbonyl) which does not move the double bond from its initial position is used. This avoids the formation of vinylidenc intermediates (which ultimately yield less favorable surfactants) and ullow.s the carbonylation to proceed at the #1 and #2 carbon atoms.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide mid  chain branched primary alkyl sulfate surfactants with greater than 14.5 carbon atoms useful in cleaning compositions. It is also an object of the present invention to provide mixtures of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactants which are fomiulatablc with other surfactants to provide cleaning compositions having one or more advantages, including greater surfactancy at low use temperatures, increased resistance to water hardness, pivatcr efficacy in surfactant systems, improved removal of greasy or body soils from fabrics, improved compatibility with detergent enzymes, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
U.S. 3,480,556 to deWitt, et a)., November 25, 1969, EP 439,316, published by Lever July 31, 1991, and EP 684,300, published by Lever November 29, 1995, describe beta-branched alkyl sulfatcs. EP 439,316 describes certain laundry detergents containing a specific commercial C14/C15 branched primary alkyl sulfate, namely L1AL 145 sulfatc. This is believed to have 61% branching in the 2-position; 30% of this involves branching with a hydrocarbon chain having four or more carbon atoms. U.S. 3,480,556 describes mixtures of from 10 to 90 parts of a straight chain primary alkyl sulfatc and from 90 to 10 parts of a beta branched (2-position branched) primary alcohol sulfatc of formula; R2<br>
K'CHCJIjOSOjX<br>
wherein the total number of carbon atoms ranges from 12 to 20 and Rl is a straight chain alkyl radical containing 9 to 17 carbon atoms and R2 is a straight chain alkyl radical containing 1 to 9 carbon atoms (67% 2-methyl and 33% 2-elhyl branching is exemplified).<br>
As noted hereinbefore, R.G. Laughlin in "The Aqueous Phase Behavior of Surfactants", Academic Press, N.Y, (1994) p. 347 describes the observation that as branching moves away from the 2-alkyl position towards the center of the alkyl hydrophobe there is a lowering of Krufft temperatures.

EP 342,917 A, Unilever, published Nov. 23, 1989 describes laundry detergents containing a surfactant system in which the major nnionic surfactant is an alkyl sulfatc having an assertcdly "wide range" of alkyl chain lengths (the experimental appears to involve mixing coconut and tallow chain length surfactants).<br>
U.S. Patent 4,102,823 and GB 1,399,966 describe other laundry compositions containing conventional alkyl sulfatcs,<br>
G.B. Patent 1,299,966, Malheson et al., published July 2, 1975, discloses a detergent composition in which the surfactant system is comprised of a mixture of sodium tallow alkyl sulfutc arid nonlonic surfactants.<br>
Methyl- substituted sulfatcs include the known "isostearyl" sulfatcs; these are typically mixtures of isomcric sulfates having a total of 18 carbon ntoms. For example, HP 401,462 A, assigned to Henkel, published December 12, 1990, describes certain isostearyl alcohols and ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and their sulfation to produce the corresponding alkyl sulfates such as sodium isostearyl sulfate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to surfactant mixtures comprising mid-chain branched surfactant compounds as described herein before. In such compositions, certain points of branching (e.g., the location along the chain of the R,R1, and/or R2 moieties in the aboveformula) are preferred over other points of branching along the backbone of the surfactant. The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for mono-methyl branched alkyl Ab moieties useful according to the present invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)It should be noted that for the mono-methyl substituted surfactants these ranges exclude the two terminal carbon atoms of the chain and the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the -X - B group.<br>
The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range, preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for di-melhyl substituted alkyl Ab moieties useful according to the present invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)The preferred branched surfactant compositions useful in cleaning compositions according to the present invention are described in more detail hereinafter.<br>

In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl moieties within the range of from greater than 14.5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one branched primary<br>
alky) sulfate surfactant compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12 carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and further the average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5.<br>

(3) Mid-chain Branched Primary Alkyl Alkoxvlated Sulfate Surfactants<br>
The present invention branched surfactant compositions may comprise one or more (preferably a mixture of two or more) mid-chain branched primary alkyl alkoxylatcd sulfates having the formula:(Formula Removed)The surfactant mixtures of the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary alkoxylated sulfate chain backbone (i.e., the longest, linear carbon chain which includes the alkoxy-sulfated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than 20, carbon atoms. In addition, the surfactant mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alky) moieties within the range of from greater than 14.5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one alkoxylated sulfate compound having u longest linear cnrbon chain of not less than 12 carbon atoms or more than 19 carbon atoms, and the total number of carbon atoms including branching must be at least 14, and.further the average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl chains is within the range of greater than 14.5 to about 17.5.<br>
For example, a C16 total carbon (in the alkyl chain) primary alkyl alkoxylated sulfate surfactant having 15 carbon atoms in the backbone must have a methyl branching unit (cither R, R1 or R2 is methyl) whereby the total number of carbon atoms in the primary alkyl moiety of the molecule is 16.<br>

Although for the purposes of the present invention surfactant compositions the above formula does not include molecules wherein the units R, R1, and R2 are all hydrogen (i.e., linear non-branched primary alkoxylated sulfates), it is to be recognized that the present invention compositions may still further comprise some amount ol'lineai, non-binndicd primary alkoxylated sulfate. Further, this linear non-branched primary nlkoxylated sulfate surfactant may be present as the result of the process used to manufacture the surfactant mixture having the requisite mid-chain branched primary alkoxylated sulfates according to the present invention, or for purposes of formulating detergent compositions some amount of linear non-branched primary alkoxylated sulfate may be admixed into the final product formulation.<br>

alkoxylated) used to prepare the alkoxylated sulfate surfactant, or these alcohols<br>

Preparation of Mid- chain Branched Sur factants<br><br>
The following reaction scheme outlines a general approach to the preparation of the mid-chain, branched primary alcohol useful for alkoxylating and/or sulfating to prepare the mid-chain branched primary olkyl surfactants of the present invention,<br>
*(Formula Removed)<br>
An alkyl halide is converted to a Grignard reagent and the Grignard is reacted with a balokctone. After conventional acid hydrolysis, acetylation and thermal elimination of acetic acid, an intermediate olefin is produced (not shown in the scheme) which is hydrogenated forthwith using any convenient hydrogcnation catalyst such as Pd/C.<br>
This route is favorable over others in that the branch, in this illustration a 5-methyl branch, is introduccdearly in the reaction sequence.<br>
Formylation of the alkyl halide resulting from the first hydrogcnalion step yields alcohol product, MS shown in the scheme. This cnn be nlkoxylatccl using standard tecluiiqucs and/or sulfated using any convenient sulfating agent, e.g., chlorosullbnic acid, SO.Vair, or oleum, to yield the final branched primary alkyl surfactant. There is flexibility to extend the branching one additional carbon beyond that which is achieved by a single formylation. Such extension can, for example, be accomplished by reaction with cthylcne oxide. See "Grignard Reactions of Nonmetallic Substances", M.S. Kharasch and O. Reinmuth, Prentice-Hall, N.Y., 1954; J. Org. Chem., J. Cason and W. R. Winans, Vol. 15 (1950), pp 139-147; J. Org Chem., J Cason et al., Vol. 13 (1948), pp 239-248; J. Org Chem., J. Cason et al., Vol. 14 (1949), pp 147-154; and./. Org Chem., J. Cason ct al., Vol. 15 (1950), pp 135- 138 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In variations of the above procedure, alternate halokctoncs or<br>
Grignmd reagents may he used.  PHO halogcimtion of the alcohol from foimyylation or ethoxylation can be used to accomplish an iterative chain extension.<br>
The preferred mid-chained branched primary alkyl alkoxylatcd sulfates (as well us the polyoxyalkylenes and alkyl sulfates, by choosing to only alkoxylate or sulfatc the intermediate alcohol produced) of the present invention can also be, readily prepared as follows: (Formula Removed)<br>
A conventional bromoaleohol is reacted with triphcnylphosphinc followed by sodium hydride, suitably in dimethylsulfoxide/tctrahydrofuran, to form a Wittig adduct. The Wittig adduct is reacted with an alpha methyl ketone, forming an internally unsaturated methyl-branched alcoholate. Hydrogenation followed by alkoxylation and/or sulfution yields the desired mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant. Although the Wittig approach does not allow the practitioner to extend the hydrocarbon chain, as in the Grignard sequence, the Wittig typically affords higher yields. See Agricultural and Biological Chemistry, M. Horiikc et al., vol. 42 (1978), pp 1963-1965 included herein by reference.<br>
'Any alternative synthetic procedure in accordance with the invention may be used to prepare the branched primary alkyl surfactants. The mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfacatnts may, in addition be synthcsi/cd or formulated in the presence of the conventional homologs, for example any of those which may be formed in an industrial process which produces 2-alkyl branching as n result of hydroformylation. Mid-chain branched surfactant mixtures of the present invention are routinely added to other known commercial alkyl surfactants contained in the final laundry product foi mutation.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the surfactant mixtures of the present invention, especially those derived from fossil fuel sources involving commercial processes, comprise at least 1 mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant, preferably at least 2, more preferably at least 5, most preferably at least 8.<br>
Particularly suitable for preparation of certain surfactant mixtures of the present invention are "oxo" reactions wheicin a branched chain olcfin is subjected to<br>
catalytic isomcti/ation and hydroformylation prior to alkoxylation and/or sulfation. The preferred processes resulting in such mixtures utilize fossil fuels as the starting material feedstock. Preferred processes utilize Oxo reaction on linear olefins (alpha or internal) with a limited amount of branching. Suitable olefins may be made by dimeization of linear alpha or internal olefins, by controlled oligomeri/nlion of low molecular weight linear olefins, by skeletal rearrangement of detergent range olefins, by dehydrogenation/skeletal rearrangement of detergent range paraffins, or by Fischer-Tropsch reaction. These reactions will in general be controlled to:<br>
1)	give a huge proportion of olefins in the desired detergent range (white allowing<br>
for the addition of a carbon atom in the subsequent Oxo reaction),<br>
2)	produce a limited number of branches, preferably mid-chain,<br>
3)	produce C1-C3 branches, more preferably ethyl, most preferably methyl,<br>
4)	limit or eliminate gem dialkyl branching i.e. to avoid formation of quaternary<br>
carbon atoms. The suitable olefins can undergo Oxo reaction to give primary<br>
alcohols either directly or indirectly through the corresonding aldehydes. When an<br>
internal olcfm is used, an Oxo catalyst is normally used which is capable of prior<br>
pre-isomcrization of internal olefins primarily to alpha olefins. While a separately<br>
catalyzed (i.e. non-Oxo) internal to alpha isomerization could be effected, this is<br>
optional. On the other hand, if the olefin-forming step itself results directly in an<br>
alpha olefin (e.g. with high pressure Fischcr-Tropsch olefins of detergent range),<br>
then use of a non-isomm/inp, Oxo catalyst is not only possible, but preferred.<br>
The process described herein above gives the more preferred 5-methyl-hcxadecyl surfactants in higher yield than the less preferred 2,4-dimcthylpcntadccyl surfactants. This mixture is desirable under the mcies and bounds of the present ' invention in that each product comprises at total of 17 carbon atoms with linear- alkyl chains having at least 13 carbon atoms.<br>
l;or the preparation of mid-chain branched surfactants herein where X is -C(0)-, the starting material mid-chain branched carboxylic acids can be obtained from the corresponding alcohols described herein before by Jones oxidation, K. Bowdcn, I. M. Heilbron, E. R. H. Jones and B. C. L. Wccdon, J. Chem, Soc. 1946, 39, and y. O. House, Modern Synthetic Reactions (W. A. Benjamin, California, 2nd ed., pp 263-264). This is a chromic acid oxidation of the alcohol to the carboxylic acid in acidic media such as aqueous sulfuric acid. Acetone may be used to sohibilize the alcohol and enrhoxylic acid. The reaction is oflcn rapid at loom temperature.<br>

The following two analytical methods for chaiacleri/.iiift branching in the present invention surfactant compositions are useful:<br>
1) Separation and Identification of Components in Fatty Alcohols (prior to alkoxylulion or after hydrolysis of alcohol sull'ate for analytical purposes). The position and length of branching found in the precursor fatty alcohol materials is<br>
determined by GC/MS techniques [see: D. J. Harvey, Biomcd, Environ. Mass Spectrom (1989). 18(9), 719-23; D. J. Harvey, J. M. Tiffany, J. Chromatogr. (1984), 301(1), 173-87; K. A. Korlsson, B. H. Samuelsson, G. O. Steen, Chcm. Phys. Lipids (1973), 11(1), 17-38].<br>
2) Identification of Separated J;atty Alcohol Alkoxy Sulfate Components by MS/MS. The position and length of branching is also determinate by Ion Spray-MS/MS or FAB-MS/MS techniques on previously isolated fatty alcohol sulfatc components.<br>
The average total carbon atoms of the branched primary alkyl surfactants herein can bt&gt; calculated from the hydroxyl vimie of the precursor (ally alcohol mix or from the hydroxyl value of the alcohols recovered by extraction after hydrolysis of the alcohol sulfatc mix according to common procedures, such as outlined in "Bailey's Industrial Oil and Fat Products", Volume 2, Fourth Edition, edited by Daniel Swcrn, pp. 440-441.<br>

nil/vines - Enzymes arc preferably included in the present detergent compositions for a variety of purposes, including removal of protein-based, carbohydrate-based, or triglyceridc-bascd stains from substrates, for the prevention of refugee dye transfer in fabric laundering, and for fabric restoration. Suitable enzymes include .proteases, amylases, Upases, cellulases, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof ol any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Preferred selections are influenced by factors such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostability, and stability to active detergents, builders and the like. In this respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylases and proteases, and fungal cellulases.<br>
"Dctersivi: eu/.yme", as used herein, moans any en/ymc having a cleaning, stain removing or otherwise beneficial effect in a laundry, hard surface cleaning or personal care detergent composition. Preferred detersive enzymes are hydrolases such as proteases, amylases and Upases.

Enzymes arc normally incorporated into detergent or detergent additive compositions at levels sufficient to provide a "cleaning-effective amount". The term "cleaning effective amount" refers to any amount capable of producing a cleaning, stain removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or freshness improving effect on substrates such as fabrics, dishwaie mid the like. In practical terms for current commercial preparations, typical amounts are up to about 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 nig to 3 ing. of active cn?.yme per gram of the detergent ^composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01%-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation. Protease enzymes are usually present in such commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide from 0.005 to 0.1 Anson units (AU) of activity per gram of composition. For certain detergents, such as in automatic dishwashing, it may be desirable to increase the active enzyme content of the commercial preparation in order to minimize the total amount of non-catalytically active materials and thereby improve spotting/filming or other end-results. Higher active levels may also be desirable in highly concentrated detergent formulations.<br>

In spite of the large number of publications on lipase enzymes, only the lipase derived from Humicola lanuginosa and produced in Aspcrgillus oryzae as host has so far found widespread application as additive for fabric washing products. It is available from Novo Nordisk under the trade-name Lipolase'IM, as noted above. In order to optimise the stain removal performance of Lipolasc, Novo Nordisk have niude a number of variants.

Enzyme materials useful lot liquid delcigeni foiiimhitions, «nd their incorporation into such formulations, arc disclosed in U.S. 4,261,868, Hora et al, April 14, 1981. Enzymes for use in detergents CUM be stabilised by various techniques. En/yme stabilisation techniques are disclosed and exemplified in U.S. 3,600,319, August 17, 1971, Gcdgc et al, EP 199,405 and EP 200,586, October 29, 1986, Vencgas.

Enzyme Stabilizing System - The enzyme-containing compositions herein may optionally also comprise from about 0,001% to about 10%, preferably from about 0,005% to about 8%, most preferably from about 0,01% to about 6%, by weight of an enzyme stabilizing system. The enzyme stabilizing system can be any stabilizing system which is compatible with the detersive enzyme,, Such a system may be inherently provided by oilier fommlnlion sielivcn, or be nddcd separately, e.g., by the fonnulator or by a manufacturer of dclcrgcnt-rcady enzymes. Such sUibili/ing sysu-nr; can, for rxnmplc, comprise eftleiupi ion, boric »cid, propylene glycol, short chain carboxylic acids, boronic acids, and mixtures thereof, und are designed to address different stabilization problems depending on the type and physical form of the detergent composition.<br>
One stabilizing approach is the use of water-soluble sources of calcium and/or magnesium ions in the finished compositions which provide such ions to the enzymes. Calcium ions are generally more effective than magnesium ions and arc preferred herein if only one type of cation is being used. Typical detergent compositions, especially liquids, will comprise from about 1 to about 30, preferably from about 2 to about 20, more preferably from about 8 to about 12 millimoles of* calcium ion per liter of finished detergent composition, though variation is possible depending on factors including the multiplicity, type and levels of enzymes incorporated. Preferably water-soluble calcium or magnesium salts ate employed, including for example calcium chloride, calcium hydroxide, calcium formate, calcium malate, calcium malcatc, calcium hydroxide and calcium acetate; more generally, calcium sulfate or magnesium salts corresponding to the exemplified calcium salts may be used. Further increased levels of Calcium and/or Magnesium may of course be useful, for example for promoting the grease-cutting action of certain types of sui factant.<br>
Another stabilizing approach is by use of borate species. See Severson, U.S. 4,537,706. Rotate stabilizers, when used, may be at levels of up to 10% or more of the composition though more typically, levels of up to about 3% by weight of boric acid or other borate compounds such as borax or orthoborate arc suitable for liquid detergent use. Substituted boric acids such as phenylboronic acid, butaneboronic acid, p-bromophenylboronic acid or the like can be used in place of boric acid and reduced levels of total boron in detergent compositions may be possible though the use of such substituted boron derivatives.<br>
Stabilizing systems of certain cleaning compositions, for example automatic dishwashing compositions, may further comprise from 0 to about 10%, preferably from about 0.01% to about 6% by weight, of chlorine bleach scavengers, added to prevent chlorine bleach species present in many water supplies from attacking and inactivating the en/.ymes, especially under alkaline conditions. -.While chlorine levels in water may be small, typically in the range from about 0.5 ppm to about 1.75 ppm, the available chlorine in the total volume of water that comes in contact with the enzyme, for example during dish- or fabric-washing, can be relatively large; accordingly, enzyme stability to chlorine in-usc is sometimes problematic. Since perborate or pcrcmbonolc, which have the ability to rc?\ct with chlorine bleach, may present in certain of the instant compositions in amounts accounted for separately from the stabilizing system, the use of additional stabilizers against chlorine, may, most generally, not be essential, though improved results may be obtainable from their use. Suitable chlorine scavenger onions are widely known and readily<br>
available, and, if used, can be salts containing ammonium cations with sulfite, bisulfite, thiosutfite, thiosulfatc, iodide, etc. Antioxidants such as carbamate, ascorbate, etc., organic amines such as ethylencdiaminetctracetic acid (F.DTA) or alkali metal salt thereof, mcmoethanolamine (MEA), and mixtures thereof can likewise be used, Likewise, special enzyme inhibition systems can be incorporated such thai different enzymes have maximum compatibility. Other conventional scavengers such as bisulfatc, nitrate, chloride, sources of hydrogen peroxide such as sodium perborate tetrahydiate, sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonatc, as well as phosphate, condensed phosphate, acetate, benaoate, citrate, formate, laetatc, malale, tartratc, salicylatc, etc., and mixtures thereof can be used if desired. In general, since the chlorine scavenger function can be performed by ingredients separately listed under better rccogni/.ed functions, (e.g., hydrogen peroxide sources), there is no absolute requirement to add a separate chlorine scavenger unless a compound performing that function to the desired extent is absent from an enzyme-containing embodiment of the invention; even then, the scavenger is added only for optimum results. Moreover, the formulator will exercise a chemist's normal skill in avoiding the use of any enzyme scavenger or stabilizer which is nmjorly incompatible, as formulated, with other reactive ingredients. Jn relation to the use of anunonium salts, such salts can be simply admixed with the detergent composition but tiro prone to adsorb water and/or liberate ammonia during storage. Accordingly, such materials, if present, are desirably protected in a particle such as that described in US 4,652,39?,, Baginski ct nl.<br>
Builders - Detergent builders selected from aluminosilicates and silicates arc preferably included in the compositions herein, for example to assist in controlling mineral, especially, Ca and/or Mg, hardness in wash water or to assist in the removal of paniculate soils from surfaces.<br>
Suitable silicate builders include water-soluble and hydrous solid types and including those having chain-, layer-, or thiee-dimensional- structure as well as amorphous-solid or non-stnicturcd-liquid types. Preferred arc alkali metal silicates, particularly those liquids and solids having a SiO2:Na20 ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.7:1, including, pmtienliuly lor imtomittic dishwashing purposes, solid hydrous 2-ratio silicates marketed by PQ Corp. under the tradename URITESIL®, e.g., BlUTHSl'L 112O; and layered silicates, e.g., those described in U.S. 4,66-1,839, May 12, 1987, H. P. Rieck. NaSKS-6, sometimes abbreviated "SKS-6", is a crystalline layered aluminium-free 6-Na2$iO5 moiphology silicate marketed by Hocchst and is preferred especially in granular laundry compositions. See preparative methods in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. Other layered silicates, such as<br>

Layered silicates from Iloechst also include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-1), as the a, P mid y layer-silicate forms. Other silicates may also be useful, such as magnesium silicate, which caa serve as a crispening agent in granules, as a stabilising agent for bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Also suitable for use herein are synthesized crystalline ion exchange materials or hydrates thereof having chain structure and a composition' represented by the following general formula in an anhydride form: xM2OySiOz.zM'O wherein M is Na and/or K, M' is Ca and/or Mg; y/x is 0.5 to 2.0 and z/x is 0.005 to 1.0 as taught in U.S. 5,427,711, Sakaguchi et al, June 27, 1995.<br>
Aluminosilicale builders are especially useful in granular detergents, but can also be incorporated in liquids, pastes or pels. Suitable for the present purposes are those 1 awing empirical loimnlii: (Mz(Ato2)z(SiO2)vJ'xH2O wherein / and v are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to v is in the range from 1.0 to 0.5, and x is an integer from 15 to 264. Aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous, naturally-occurring or synthetically derived. An oluininosilicate production method is in U.S. 3,985,669, Krummel, ct al, October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline alumimxsilicate ion exchange materials are available as Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite X and, to whatever extent this differs from Zeolite,1?., the so-called Zeolite MAP. Natural types, including clinoptilolite, may be used. Zeolite A has the formula: Na12[(AlO2)]2(Si02)l2]'xH2O) wherein x is from 20 to 30, especially 27. Dehydrated ..zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used, Preferably, the aluminosilicate lias a particle size of 0.1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Detergent builders in place of or in addition to the silicates and aluminosiiicates described hereinbefore can optionally be included in the compositions heroin, foi example to assist in controlling mineral, especially Ca and/or Mg, hardness in wash water or to assist in the removal of paniculate soils from surfaces. Builders can operate via a variety of mechanisms including forming soluble or insoluble complexes with hardness ions, by ion exchange, and by offering a surface more favorable to the precipitation of hardness ions than are the surfaces of aitides to be cleaned. Iluildcr level can vary widely depending upon end use and physical form of the composition. Built detergents typically comprise at least about 1% builder, Liquid formulations typically comprise about 5% to about 50%, more typically 5% to 35% of builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically 15% to 50% builder by weight of the<br>
detergent composition. Lower or higher levels of builders are not excluded. For example, certain detergent additive or high-surfactant formulations can be unbuilt.<br>

.Dye.Transfer Inhibiting Agents - The compositions of the present invention may also include one or more materials effective for inhibiting the transfer of dyes from one fabric to another during the cleaning process. Generally, such dye transfer inhibiting agents include polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, polyaminc N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrohdone and N-vinylimidazole,<br><br>
manganese phthalocyonine, pwroxidasex, and mixtures thereof. If used, these agents typically cotnpiisc. from about 0,01% to about 10% by weight of the composition, preferably 1'rom about 0,01% to about 5%, and moie preferably fiom about 0.05% to about 2%.<br>
More specifically, the polyaminc N-oxide polymers pieferrcd for use herein contain units having the following structural formula: R-AX-P; wherein I' is a polynierizable unit to which an N-O group can be attached or the N-O group can form part of the polymerizable unit or the N-O group can be attached to both units; A is one of the following structures: -NC(O)-, -C(0)0-, -S-, -0-, -N=; XAB 0 or 1; and R is aliphatic, ethoxylated aliphatics, aromatics, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups or any combination thereof to which the nitrogen of the N-O group can be attached or the N-O group is part of these groups.

Examples of suitable polymeric backbones are polyvinyls, polyalkylenes, polyesters, polyethers, polyamide, polyimidcs, polyacrylatcs and mixtures thereof These polymers include random or block copolymcrs where one monomer type is an amine N-oxide and the other monomer type is an N-oxide. The uminc N-oxidc polymers typically have a ratio of amine to the amine N-oxide of 10:1 to 1:1,000,000. However, the number of amine oxide groups present in the polyamine oxide polymer can be varied by appropriate copolymerization or by an appropriate degree of N-oxidation. The polyamine oxides can be obtained in almost »ny degree of polymcriwUion. Typically, (he average molecular weight is within the rimgc of 500 to 1,000,000; more preferred 1,000 to 500,000; most preferred 5,000 to 100,000. This preferred class of m.'ttcrinls cmi IK- referred to us "PVNO".<br><br>
The most preferred polyamine N-oxide useful-in the detergent compositions herein is poIy(4-vinylpyridine-N-oxide) which as an •• average molecular weight of about 50,000 and an amine to amine N-oxide ratio of about 1 'A.<br>

PVP's are known to persons skilled in the detergent field; sec, lor example, IiP-A-262,897 and JiP-A-256,696, incorporated herein by reference. Compositions containing PVP can also contain polyethylene glycol ("PEG") having an average molecular weight from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably fiom about 1,000 to about 10,000. Preferably, the ratio of PEG to PVP on a ppm basis ' delivered in wash solutions is from about 2:1 to about 50:1, and more preferably from about 3:1 to about 10:1.<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain from about O.OO.S% to 5% by weight of certain types of hydtophilic optical biigliteners which also provide a dye transfer inhibition action. If used, the compositions herein will preferably comprise from about 0.01% to 1% by weight of such optical brightcncrs.<br>
The hydiophilie optical hrightcners useful in the present invention aie those having the structural formula: (Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R] is selected from anilino, N-2-bis-hydroxycthyl and NH-2-hydroxycthyl; R2   is   selected   from   N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl,   N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylamino,<br>
inorphilino, chloro and amino; and M is a salt-forming cation such as sodium or potassium.<br>
When in the above formula, R] is anilino, R2 is N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4',-bis[(4-anilino-6-(N-2-bis-hydroxyelhyl)-s-triazine-2-y))amino]-2(2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid and disodiuin salt. This particular briglitener species is commercially marketed under the tradename TinopaMJNPA-OX by Ciba-Gcigy Corporntion. Tmopal-UNI'A-OX is <hc preferred hydrophilic optical brightener useful in the detergent compositions herein.></hc>
When in the above formula, Rj is anilino, R2 is N-2-hydr©Kyethyl-N-2-mcthylarnino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4-anilino-6-(N-2-hydroxycthyl-N-inethylamino)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2'-stilbcnedisulfonic acid disodiuin salt.   This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the trudcnamc Tinopal 5DM-GX by Ciba-Gcigy Corporation.<br>

The specific optical brightener species selected for use m the present invention provide especially effective dye transfer inhibition performance benefits when used in combination with the .selected polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents hereinbefore described. The combination of such selected polymeric materials (e.g., 1'VNO and/or I'VI'VJ) with .such selected opticnl brighteners (e.g., Tinopal UNl'A-GX, Tinopal 5BM-GX and/or Tinopal AMS-GX) provides significantly better dye transfer inhibition-in aqueous wash solutions than docs either of these two detergent composition components when used alone. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such brighteners work this way because they have high affinity for fabrics in the wash solution and therefore deposit relatively quick on these fabrics. The extent to which brighteners deposit on fabrics in the wash solution can be defined by a parameter called the "exhaustion coefficient". The exhaustion coefficient is in general as, the. tatio  of a) the brightener mateiial deposited on fabrico b) the initial brightener concentration in the wash liquor. Brighteners with relatively high exhaustion coefficients arc the most suitable for inhibiting dye transfer in the context of the present invention.<br>
Of course, it will be appreciated that other, conventional optical brightener typos of compounds can optionally be used in the present compositions to provide<br>
conventional fabric "brightness" benefits, rather than a true dye transfer inhibiting effect. Such usage is conventional nnd well-known to detergent fotmuhlions.<br>
Chelating Agents - The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain one or more iron and/or manganese ehelatirig agents. Such chelating agents can be selected from the group consisting of amino carboxylatcs, nmino phosphonates, polyfunctionally-substituled aromatic chelating agents and mixtures therein, all as hereinafter defined. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the benefit of these materials is due in part to their exceptional ability to remove iron and manganese ions from washing solutions by formation of soluble chclates.<br>
Amino carboxylates useful as optional chelating agents include cthylenediaminetetracetates, N-hydroxyethylelhylencdiaminetriacetai.es, nitrilotri-acctalcs, ethylcnediamine letrapioprionates, tiicthylcnetctraarrnnehexacetates, dielhylcnctriaminepenlaacctatcs, and ethanoldiglycines, alkali metal, ammonium, and substituted ammonium salts therein and mixtures (herein.<br>
Amino phosphonates are also suitable" for use as chelating agents in the compositions of the invention when at lease low levels of total phosphorus are permitted in detergent compositions, and include clhylenediaminetetrakis (methylenephosphonates) as DEQUEST. Preferred, these amino phosphonates to not contain alkyl or alkenyl groups with more than about 6 carbon atoms.<br>

The compositions herein may also contain water-soluble methyl glycinc diacetic acid (MGDA) salts (or acid form) as a chelant or co-builder useful with, for example, insoluble builders such as zeolites, layered silicates and the like.<br>
If utilized, these chelating agents will generally comprise from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight of the detergent compositions herein. More preferably, if utili/ed, the chelating agents will comprise from about 0.1% to about 3.0% by weight of such compositions.<br>
.Suds Suppressors - Compounds for reducing or suppressing the formation of suds can be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention. Suds suppression can be of particular importance in the so-called "high concentration<br>
cleaning process" as described in U.S. 4,489,455 and 4,489,574 and in front-loading European-style washing machines.<br>
A wide variety of mate-rials may be used as suds suppressors, and suds suppressors .'ire well known to those skilled in the art. Sec, for example, Kirk Olhmer Eneydopwlia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7, pages 430-447 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1979). One category of suds suppressor of paiticular interest encompasses monocarboxylic fatly acid and soluble salts therein. Sec U.S. Patent 2,954,347, issued September 27, 1960 to Wayne St. John. The monocarboxylic fatty acids and salts thereof used as suds suppressor typically have hydrocarbyl chains of 10 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Suitable salts include the alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium, and lithium salts, and ammonium and alkanolammonium salts.<br>

These include, for example: high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as paraffin, fatty ncid esters (e.g., fatly acid triglyceridcs), fally acid esters of monovalent alcohols, aliphatic C18-C40 ketones (e.g., stcaronc), etc. Other suds inhibitors include N-alkylated arnino triazincs such as tri- to hexa-alkylmelamincs or di- to tclru-alkyldiaminc chloilrin/.incs formed as products of cyanuric chloride with two or three moles of a primary or secondary amine containing 1 to 24 carbon nloms, piopylonc oxide, und munostearyl phosphates such as mono.slciiryl alcohol phosphate ester and monostcaryl di-alkali metal (e.g., K, Na, and Li) phosphates and phosphate esters. The hydrocarbons such as paraffin and haloparaffin can be utilized in liquid form, The liquid hydrocarbons will be liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and will have a pour point in the range of about -40°C and about 50°C, and a minimum boiling point not less than about 110°C (atmospheric pressure). It is also known to utilize waxy hydrocarbons, preferably having a melting point below about 100°C. The hydrocarbons constitute a preferred category of suds suppressor for detergent compositions. Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,265,779, issued May 5, 1981 to Gandolfo et al. The hydrocarbons, thus, include aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, and hcterocyclic saturated or unsulutated hydrocarbons having from about 12 to about 70 carbon atoms. The term "paraffin," as used in this suds suppressor discussion, is intended lo include mixtures of tine paraffins and cyclic hydrocarbons.<br>
Another preferred category of non-surfactant suds suppressors comprises silicone suds suppressors. This category includes the use of polyorganosiloxane oils, such as polydiinethylsiloxane, dispersions or emulsions of polyorganosiloxanc oils or resins, and combinations of polyorganosiloxanc with silica particles wherein<br>
the poJyorganosiloxane is chemisorbed or fused onto the silica. Silicone suds suppressors are well known in the art and are, for example, disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,265,779, issued May 5, 1981 to Gandolfo et al and European Patent Application No. 89307851.9, published February 7, 1990, by Starch, M.

Still other perfume chemicals include phenyl ethyl alcohol, terpineol, linalool, linalyl acetate, gcraniol, nerol, 2-(l,.1dimethylcthy])-cyclohexanol acetate, benzyl acetate, and cugcnol. Carriers such as diethylphthalate can be used in the finished perfume compositions.<br>
Other.Ingrcdicnts - A wide variety of other ingredients useful in detergent compositions can he included in the compositions herein, including other active ingredients, carriers, hydrotropes, processing aids, dyes or pigments, solvents for liquid formulations, solid fillets for bar composition.';, etc, If high sudsing is desired, suds boosters such as the C10-C16 alkonolamides am be incorporated into the compositions, typically at 1%-10% levels. The C10-C14monoelhanol and dicthanol amides illustrate a typical class of such suds boosters. Use of such suds boosters with high sudsing adjunct surfactants such as the amine oxides, bctaincs and sultaines noted above is also advantageous. If desired, water-soluble magnesium and/or calcium salts such as MgCl2, MgSo4, CuCl2, CaSO4 and the like, can be added at levels of, typically, 0.1%-2%, to provide additional suds and to enhance grease removal performance.<br>
Various detersive ingredients employed in the present compositions optionally can be further stabilized by absorbing said ingredients onto a porous hydrophobic suhstiulr, then  conting, said substiate with a hydrophobic coaling. Preferably, the detersive ingredient is admixed with a surfactant before being absorbed into the porous substrate. In use, the detersive ingredient is released from the substrate into the aqueous washing liquor, where it performs its intended detersive function.<br>
To illustrate this technique in more detail, a porous hydrophobic silica (trademark S1PERNAT D10, DeGussa) is admixed with a prolcolylic enzyme solution containing 3%-5% of 013.15 ethoxylated alcohol (EO 7) nonionic surfactant. Typically, the enzyme/surfactant solution is 2.5 X the weight of silica. The resulting powder is dispersed with stirring in silicone oil (various siliconc oil<br>
viscosities in the range of 500-12,500 can be used).   The resulting siliconc oil<br>
.1  r&gt;   f,<br>
dispersion is emulsified or otherwise added to the final detergent matrix. By this means, ingredients such as the aforementioned enzymes, bleaches, bleach activators, blench catalysts, photoaeiivalors, dyes, fluorcsccrs, fabric conditioners mid hydroly/.able tunfactants can be "piotected" for use in detergents, including liquid laundry detergent compositions.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can contain water and other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by rnclhanol, cthanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydrio»alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propancdiol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and 1,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers.<br>
The determent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, dining use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pi I of between about 6.5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.5 and 10.5. Liquid dishwashing product formulations preferably have n pi I between about 6.8 and about 9.0. Laundry products aic typically nl pi I 9-11. Techniques for controlling pll at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and me well known to those skilled in (he art. Form of the compositions<br>
The compositions in accordance with the invention can take a variety of physical forms including granular, tablet, bar and liquid forms. The compositions are particularly the so-called concentrated granular detergent compositions adapted to be added to a washing machine by means of a dispensing device placed in the machine drum with the soiled fabric load.<br>
The mean particle si'/.e of the components of granular compositions in accordance with the invention should preferably be such that no more that 5% of particles arc greater than 1.7mm in diameter and not more than 5% of particles are less than 0.15mm in diameter.<br>
The term mean particle si/.e as defined herein is calculated by sieving a sample of the composition into a number of fractions (typically 5 fractions) on a series of Tyler sieves. The weight fractions thereby obtained arc plotted against the aperture size of the sieves. The mean particle size is taken to be the aperture size through which 50%.by weight of the sample would pass.<br>
The bulk density of granular detergent compositions in accordance with the prestant invention typically have a bulk density of at least 600 g/litre, more<br>
preferably from 650 g/litrc to 1200 g/litre.Bulk density is measured by means of a<br>
simple funnel mid cup device eoiisisimf, of a eonienl funnel moulded rigidly on a<br>
base and provided with a llap valve at its lower extremity to allow the contents of<br>
the funnel to be emptied into an axially aliened cylindrical cup disposed below the<br>
funnel.   The funnel is 130 mm high and has internal diameters of 130 mm and 40<br>
mm at its respective upper and lower extremities.   It is mounted so that the lower<br>
extremity is 140 mm above the upper surface of the base.   The cup has an overall<br>
height of 90 mm, an internal height of 87 mm and an internal diameter of 84 mm.<br>
Its nominal volume is 500 ml.	-*«<br>
To carry out a measurement, the funnel is filled with powder by hand pouring, the flap valve is opened and powder allowed to overfill the cup.  The filled cup is removed from the frame and excess powder removed from the cup by passing a straight edged implement eg; a knife, across its upper edge.   The filled cup is then weighed and the value obtained for the weight of powder doubled to provide a bulk density in g/Jilie.   Replicate measurements arc made as required. Mid-chain branched primary alky) surfactant agglomerate particles<br>
The mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant system herein is preferably present in granular compositions in the form of mid-chain branched primary alky) surfactant agglomerate particles, which may take the form of flakes, prills, marumes, noodles, ribbons, but preferably take the form of granules. The most preferred way to process the particles is by agglomerating powders (e.g. aluminosilicate, carbonate) with high active mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant pastes and to control the paiticle size of the resultant agglomerates within specified limits, Such a process involves mixing an effective amount of powder with a high active mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant paste in one or more iigglomerntois such as a pan agglomcrator, a Z-blade mixer or more preferably on in-line mixer such as those manufactured by Schugi (Holland) BV, 29 Chroomstraat 8211 AS, Lelystad, Netherlands, and Gcbrudcr Lodige Maschinenbau GmbH, D-4790 Paderborn 1, Elsenerslrasse 7-9, Postfach 2050, Germany. Most preferably a high shear mixer is used, such as a Lodige CB (Trade Name).<br>
A high active mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant paste comprising from 50% by weight to 95% by weight, preferably 70% by weight to 85% by weight of mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant is typically used. The paste may be pumped into the agglomerator at a temperature high enough to maintain a pumpable viscosity, but low enough to avoid degradation of the surfactants used. An operating temperature of the paste of 50°C to 80"C is typical.<br>
Machine laundry methods herein typically comprise treating soiled laundry with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an  effective amount ol a machine laundry determent composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the determent composition it is meant from 20g to 300g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 5 to 65 litres, as arc typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine laundry methods.<br>
As noted, the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactants are used herein in detergent compositions, preferably in combination with other detersive surfactants, at levels which are effective for achieving at least a directional improvement in cleaning performance. In the context of a fabric laundry composition, such "usage levels" can vary depending not only on the type and severity of the soils and stains, but also on the wash water temperature, the volume of wash water and the type of washing machine.<br>
l;oi fxriniplc, in :t (op-loading, veiiic/il axis U.S.-type automatic washing machine using about 45 to 83 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 10 to about 14 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 10°C to about 50°C, it is preferred to include from about 2 ppm to about 625 ppm, preferably from about 2 ppm to about 550 ppm, more preferably from about 10 ppm to about 235 ppm, of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant in the wash liquor. On the basis of usage rates of from about 50 nil to about 150 ml per wash load, this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant of from about 0.1% to about 40%, preferably about 0.1% to about 35%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%, for a heavy-duty liquid laundry detergent. On the basis of usage rates of from about 30g to about 950g per wash load, for dense ("compact") granular laundry detergents (density above about 650 g/1) this translates into nn in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid chain branched primary nlkyl surfactant of from about 0.1% to about 50%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 35%, and more preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%. On the basis of usage rates of from about 80 p to about 100Og per load for spray-dried granules (i.e., "fluffy"; density below about 650 g/1), this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant of from about 0.07% to about 35%, preferably from about 0.07 to about 25%, and more preferably from about 0.35% to about 11 %.<br>
For example, in a front-loading, horizontal-axis Ruropean-typc automatic washing machine using about 8 to 15 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 10 to about 60 minutes and a wash water temperature of about 30°C to<br>
about 95 °C, it is prefeired to include from about 3 ppm to about 14,000 ppm, preferably from about 3 ppm to about 10,000 ppm, more preferably from about 15 ppm to about 4200 ppm, of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant in the wash liquor. On the basis of usage rates of from about 45 ml to about 270 ml per wash load, this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant of from about 0.1% to about 50%, preferably about 0.1% to about 35%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%, for a heavy-duty liquid laundry detergent. On the basis of usage rates of from about 40 g to about 21 Og per wash load, for dense ("compact") granular laundry detergents (density above about 650 g/l) this translates into.an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant of from about 0.12% to about 53%, preferably from about 0.12% to about 46%, and more preferably from about 0.6% to about 20%. On the basis of usage rates of from about 140 g to about 400 g per load for spray-dried granules (i.e., "fluffy"; density below about 650 g/1), this translates into an in product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant of from about 0.03% to about 34%, preferably from about 0.03% to about 24%, and more preferably from about 0.15% to about 10%.<br>
For example, in a top-loading, vertical-axis Japanese-type automatic washing machine using about 26 to 52 liters of water in the wash bath, a wash cycle of about 8 to about 15 minutes and a wash water temperature of nbout 5°C to about 25°C, it is preferred to include from about 0.67 ppm to about 270 ppm, preferably from about 0.67 ppm to about 236 ppm, more preferably from about 3.4 ppm to about 100 ppm, of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant in the wash liquor. On the basis of usage rates of from about 20 ml to about 30 ml per wash load, this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant of from about 0.1% to about 40%, preferably about 0.1% to about 35%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%, for a heavy-duty liquid laundry detergent. On the basis of usage rates of from about 18 p, to about 35 g per wash load, for dense ("compact") granular laundry detergents (density above about 650 g/l) this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant of from about 0.1% to about 50%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 35%, and more preferably from about 0.5% to about 15%. On the<br>
' ^    F&gt;-<br>
basis of u.'i.'igc rules of from about 30 g to about 40 i&gt; per load for spray-dried granules (i.e., "fluffy"; density below about 650 g/l), this translates into an in-product concentration (wt.) of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactant of from about 0.06% to about 44%, preferably from about 0.06% to about 30%, and more preferably from about 0,3% to about 13%.<br>
As cim be- seen Jiom the foregoing, the amount of mid-chain branched piiniaiy alkyl surfactant used in a machine-wash laundeiing context can vary, depending on (he habits and practices of the user, the type of washing machine, and the like. In this context, however, one heretofore unappreciated advantage of the mid-chain branched primary alkyl surfactants is their ability to provide ut least directional improvements in performance over a spectrum of soils and stains even when used at relatively low levels with respect to the other surfactants (generally anionics or anionic/nonionic mixtures) in the finished compositions.<br>
In a preferred use aspect a dispensing device is employed in thc-washing method. The dispensing device is charged with the detergent product, and is used to introduce the product directly into the drum of the washing machine before the commencement of the wash cycle. Its volume capacity should be such as to be able to contain sufficient detergent product as would normally be used in the washing method.<br>
Once the washing machine has been loaded with laundry the dispensing device containing the detergent product is placed inside the drum. At the commencement of the wash cycle of the washing machine water is introduced into the drum and the drum periodically rotates. The design of the dispensing device should be such that it permits containment of the dry detergent product but then allows release of this product dining the wash cycle in response to its agitation as the drum rotates and also as a result of its contact with the wash water.<br>
To allow for release of the detergent product during the wash the device may possess a number of openings through which the product may pass. Alternatively, the device, may be made of a material which is permeable to liquid but impermeable to the solid product, which will allow release of dissolved product. Preferably, the detergent product will be rapidly released at the start of the wash cycle thereby providing transient localised high concentrations of product in the drum of the washing machine at this stage of the wash cycle.<br>
Preferred dispensing devices are reusable, and are designed in such a way that container integrity is; maintained in both the dry slate and during the wash cycle. Especially preferred dispensing devices for use with the composition of the invention have been described in the following patents; GB-B-2, 157, 717, GB-B-2, 157, 718, J-P-A-0201376, EP-A-0288345 and EP-A-02.88346. An article by J.Blund published in Manufacturing Chemist, November 1989, pages 41-46 also describes especially preferred dispensing devices for use with granular laundry products which are of a type commonly know as the "granulctte". Another preferred dispensingdevice for use with the compositions of this invention is disclosed in PCT Patent Application No. WO94/11562.<br>
Especially preferred dispensing devices arc disclosed in European Patent Application Publication Nos. 0343069 &amp; 0343070. The latter Application discloses a device comprising a flexible sheath in the form of a bag extending from a support ring defining an orifice, the orifice being adapted to admit to the bag sufficient product for one washing cycle in a washing process. A portion of the washing medium flows through the orifice into the bag, dissolves the product, and the solution then passes outwardly through the orifice into the washing medium. The support ring is provided with a masking arrangemnt to prevent egress of wetted, undissolved, product, this arrangement typically comprising radially extending walls extending from a central boss in a spoked wheel configuration, or a similar structure in which the walls have a helical form.<br>
Alternatively, the dispensing device may be a flexible container, such as a brig or pouch. The bay, may be olTihrous construction coated with a water impermeable protective material so as to retain the contents, such as is disclosed in European published Talent Application "No. 001 8678. Alternatively it may be formed of a water-insoluble synthetic polymeric material provided with an edge seal or closure designed to rupture in aqueous media as disclosed in European published Patent Application Nos. 0011500, 0011501, 0011502, and 0011968. A convenient form of water frangible closure comprises a water soluble adhesive disposed along and scaling one edge of a pouch formed of a water impermeable polymeric film such as polyethylene or polypropylene. Machine dishwashing method<br>
Any suitable methods for machine washing or cleaning soiled tableware, particularly soiled silverware fire envisaged.<br>
A preferred machine dishwashing method comprises treating soiled articles selected from crockery, glassware, hollowwiiu:, silverware and cutlery and mixtures thereof, with an aqueous liquid having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine dishwashing composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the machine dishwashing composition it is meant from 8g to 60g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 3 to 10 litres, as arc typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine dishwashing methods. Packaging for the compositions<br>
Commrirc.ially maikc-led executions of the bleaching compositions can be packaged in any suitable container including those constructed from paper,<br>
cardboard, plastic materials and any suitable laminates. A preferred packaging execution is described in European Application No.949215057.<br>

Such compositions can contain various particulatc detersive ingredients (including the bleaching agents, as disclosed hcrcinabovc) stably suspended therein. Such non-aqueous compositions thus comprise a LIQUID PHASE and, optionally but preferably, a SOLID PHASE, all as described in more detail hereinafter and in the cited references. The alkoxylated dianionic ester cleaning agent is incorporated in the compositions at the levels and in the-manner described hercinabove for the manufacture of other laundry detergent compositions. LJQUIP PUARli<br>
The liquid phase will generally comprise from about 35% to 99% by weight of the detergent compositions herein. More preferably, the liquid phase will comprise from about 50% to 95% by weight of the compositions. Most preferably, the liquid phase will comprise from about 45% to 75% by weight of the compositions herein. The liquid phase of the detergent compositions herein essentially contains relatively high concentrations of a certain type anionic surfactant combined with a certain type of nonaqueous, liquid diluent. (A) Essential. Anioiiic_Surfactan_t<br>
The anionic surfactant essentially utilized as an essential component of the nonaqueous liquid phase is one selected from the alkali metal salts of alkylbcn7,ene sullbnic: acids in which the alkyl }',ioup contains from about 10 to 16 carbon atoms,<br>
in straight chain or branched chain configuration. (Sec U.S. Patents 2,220,099 and 2,477,383, incorporated herein by reference.) Especially preferred arc the sodium and potassium linear straight chain alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) in which the average: number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group is from about 11 to 14. Sodum C'i ] -Ci/| LAS is especially preferred.<br>
The alkylbenzene sulfonate anionic surfactant will be dissolved in the nonaqucous liquid diluent which makes up the second essential component of the nonaqueous phase. To form the stiuetured liquid phase required lor suitable phase stability and acceptable rheology, the alkylbenzene sulfonate anionie surfactant is generally present to the extent of from about 30% to 65% by weight of the liquid phase. More preferably, the alkylbcn/ene sulfonate anionic surfactant will comprise from about 35% to 50% by weipht of the nonaqueous liquid phase of the compositions herein. Utili/ation of this anionic surfactant in these concentrations corresponds to an anionic surfactant concentration in the total composition of from about 15% to 60% by weight, more preferably fiom about 20% to 40% by weight, of the composition. (B) Nonaqueous Liquid Diluent<br>
To form the liquid phase of the detergent compositions, the hereinbefore described alkylbcnx.ene sulfonate anionic surfactant is combined with a nonaqueous liquid diluent which contains two essential components. These two components are a liquid alcohol alkoxylate material and a nonaqucous, low-polarity organic solvent.<br>
i)        Alcohol Alkoxylatcs<br>
One essential component of the liquid diluent used to form the compositions herein comprises an alkoxylated fatty alcohol material. Such materials are themselves also nonionie surfactants. Such materials correspond to the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)wherein K' is a r.R - C|c, nlkyl proup, m is from ? to 4, and n rnnp.es from about 2 to 12. Piefeiably R^ is an alkyl group, which may be primary or secondary, that contains from about 9 to 15 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 10 to 14 carbon atoms. Preferably also the alkoxylated fatty alcohols will he cthoxylatcd materials that contain from about 2 to 12 ethylcne oxide moieties per molecule, more preferably from about 3 to 10 ethylene oxide moieties per molecule.<br>
The alkoxylated fatty alcohol component of the liquid diluent will frequently have a hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) which ranges from about 3 to 17. More preferably, the HLB of this material will ranp,c from about 6 to 15, most preferably from about 8 to 15.<br><br>
Examples of fatly alcohol alkoxylates useful as one of the essential components of the nonaqueous liquid diluent in the compositions herein will include those which are made from alcohols of 12 to IS carbon atoms and which contain about 7 moles of clhylene oxide, Such materials have been commercially marketed under the trade names Neodol 25-7 and Neodol 23-6.5 by Shell Chemical Company. Other useful Neodols include Neodol 1-5, an ethoxylatcd fatty alcohol averaging 11 carbon atoms in its alkyl chain with about 5 moles of ethylene oxide; Neodol 23-9, an ethoxylaled primary C]2 - Cj3 alcohol having about 9 moles of ethylene oxide and Neodol 91-10, an cthoxylated €9 - C\ \ primary alcohol having about 10 moles of ethylene oxide. Alcohol ethoxylates of this type have also been marketed by Shell Chemical Company under the Dobanol tradenamc. Dobanol 91-5 is an ethoxylatcd Cq-C] \ fatty alcohol with an average of 5 moles ethylene oxide and Dobanol 25-7 is an ethoxylatecl Cj2-Ci5 fntty alcohol with an average of 7 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of fatty alcohol.<br>

The former is a mixed ethoxylation product of Cji to C]5 linear secondary alkaiiol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide and the latter is a similar product but with 9 moles of ethylene oxide being reacted.<br>
Other types of alcohol ethoxylates useful in the present compositions arc higher molecular weight nonionics, such as Neodol 45-11, which arc similar ethylene oxidt; condensation prodneH of hij'hcr Ihtly alcohols, with the higher fatty alcohol being of 14-15 carbon atoms and the number of ethylene oxide groups per mole being about 11. Such products have also been commercially marketed by Shell Chemical Company.<br>
The alcohol alkoxylate component which is essentially utilized as part of the liquid diluonl in iho nonnqucous compositions herein will generally be present to the extent of from about ]% to 60% of the liquid phase composition. More preferably, the alcohol alkoxylate component will comprise about 5% to 40% of the liquid phase. Most preferably, the essentially utilized alcohol alkoxylate, component will comprise from about 5% to 30% of the detergent composition liquid phase. Utilization of alcohol alkoxylate in these concentrations in the liquid phase corresponds to an ulcohol alkoxyltttc concentiation in the total composition of from about 1% to 60% by weight, more preferably from about 2% to 40% by weight, and most preferably from about 5% to 55% by weight, of the composition.<br>
ii)        Nonaqucous Low-Polarity Organic Solvent<br><br>
A second essential component of the liquid diluent which forms part of the liquid phase of the detergent compositions herein comprises nonaqueous, Jow-polarity organic solvent(s). The term "solvent" is used herein to connote the non-surface active carrier or diluent portion of the liquid phase of the composition. While some of the essential and/or optional components of the compositions herein may actually dissolve in the "solvcnt"-containing liquid phase, other components will be present us particulutc material dispersed within the "solvcnt'^containinp, liquid phase. Thus the term "solvent" is not meant to require that the solvent material be capable of actually dissolving all of the detergent
The nonaqueous organic materials which are employed as solvents herein are those which are liquids of low polarity. For puq&gt;oses of this invention, "low-polarity" liquids are those which have little, if any, tendency to dissolve one of the preferred types of paniculate material used in the compositions herein, i.e., the pcroxygen bleaching agents, sodium perborate or sodium pcrcarbonatc. Thus relatively polar solvents such as ethanol should not be utilized. Suitable types of low-polarity solvents useful in the nonnqueous liquid detergent compositions herein do include non-vicinal C^-Cg alkylene glycols, alkylenc glycol mono lower alkyl ethers, lower molecular weight polyethylene glycols, lower molecular weight methyl esters and amides, and the like.<br>
A preferred type of nonaqueous, low-polarity solvent for use in the compositions herein comprises the non-vicinal C4-Cg branched or straight chain alkyle.no glycols. Materials of this type include hcxylcnc glycol (4-melhyl-2,4-pentanediol), 1,6-hcxanediol, 1,3-butylenc glycol and 1,4-butylene glycol. Hcxylene glycol is the most preferred.<br>
Another preferred type of nonaqueous, low-polarity solvent for use herein comprises the mono-, di-, tri , or tetra- ^2 ('3 alkylenc glycol mono C2-C£ alkyl ethers. The specific examples of such compounds include diclhylenc glycol monobutyl ether, tctracthylenc glycol monobutyl ether, dipropylenc glycol monoelhyl ether, and dipropylcnc glycol monobutyl ether. Diethylene glycol monobutyl ether and dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether urc especially preferred. Compounds of the type have been commercially marketed under the tradenames Dowanol, Carbitol, and Cellosolvc.<br>
Another preferred type of nonaqueous, low-polarity organic solvent useful herein comprises the lower molecular weight polyethylene glycols (PEGs). Such materials are those having molecular weights of at least about 150. PRGs of molecular weight ranging from about 200 to 600 arc most preferred.<br><br>
Yet another preferred type of non-polur, nonaqucous solvent comprises lower molecular weight methyl esters. Such materials arc those of the general formula: R'C(O)-OCll3 wherein R1 ranges from 1 to about 18. Examples of suitable lower molecular weight methyl esters include methyl acetate, methyl propionatc, methyl octunoute, uiul methyl dodeamoiilc,<br>
The nonaqucous, low-polarity organic solvcnt(s) employed should, of course, be compatible and non-reactive with other composition components, e.g., bleach and/or activators, used in the liquid detergent compositions herein, Such a solvem component will generally be utilized in an amount of from about \% to 70% by weight of the liquid phase. More preferably, the nonaqueous, low-polarity organic solvent will comprise from about 10% to 60% by weight of the liquid phase, most preferably from about 20% to 50% by weight, of the liquid phase of the composition, Utilisation of this organic solvent in these concentrations in the liquid phase corresponds to a solvent concentration in the total composition of from about 1% U&gt; 5&gt;0% by weij'ht, more preferably from about 5% to 40% by wcip.ht, and most preferably from about 10% to 30% by weight, of the composition,<br>
iii)       Alcohol Alkoxvlate To Solvent Ralio<br>
The ratio of alcohol alkoxylate to organic solvent within the liquid diluent can be used to vary the Theological properties of the detergent compositions eventually formed. Generally, the weight ratio of alcohol alkoxylate to organic solvent will range from about 50:1 to 1:50, More preferably, this ratio will range from about 3:1 to 1:3.<br>
iv)        Li<iuidj jt></iuidj>
As with the concentration of the alkylbcnzene sulfonatc anionic surfactant mixture, the amount of total liquid diluent in the nonaqueous liquid phase herein will be determined by tin: type and amounts of other composition components and by the desired composition properties. Generally, the liquid diluent will comprise from about 35% to 70% of the nomiqueous liquid phase of the compositions herein, More preferably, the liquid diluent will comprise from about 50% to 65% of the nonaqucous liquid phase. This corresponds to a nonaqueous liquid diluent concentration in the total composition of from about 15% to 70% by weight, more preferably from about 20% to 50% by weight, of the composition,<br>
SOLID PHASE<br>
i.<br>
The nonaqucous detergent compositions herein also essentially comprise from about 1% to 65% by weight, more preferably from about 5% to 50% by weight, oi u solid phusc uf p;uticulat
 <br>
about 0.1 to 1500 microns.   More profciably such material will range In size from about 5 to 200 microns.<br>
The paniculate material utilixed heioin can coinpmu one or mojc types of determent composition components which in paniculate form arc substantially insoluble in the nonaqucous liquid phase of the composition.    The types of particulate materials which caj) be utilized ate described in detail as follows; COMPOSITION PREPARATION AND USE<br>
The nonaqueous liquid detergent compositions herein can be prepared by combining the essential and optional components thereof in any convenient order and by mixing, e.g., agitating, the resulting component combination to form the phase stable compositions herein. In a typical process for preparing such compositions, essential and certain preferred optional components will be combined in a particular order mul under curium conditions.<br>
In the first step of such a typical preparation process, an admixture of the alkylbeiv/enc siilfonale unlonic smfaclnni and the two c.sRcntinl components of the Donuqucom diluent is ibimed by heating a combination of these materials to « temperature from about 30°C to ) 00°C.<br>
In a second process step, the heated admixture formed as hereinbefore described is maintained under shear agitation at a temperature from about 40°C to 100°C for a period of from about 2 minutes to 20 hours, Optionally, a vacuum can be applied to the admixture at this point. This second process sicp serves to completely dissolve the anionic surfactant in the nonaqueous liquid phase.<br>
In a third process step, this liquid phase combination of materials is cooled to a temperature of from about 0°C to 35°C. This cooling step serves to form a structured, surfactant-containing, liquid base into which the particulate material of the detergent compositions herein can be added and dispersed.<br>
Particulate material is added in a fourth process step by combining the poiliciilme miiluiui with tin- liquid bust* which is maintained under conditions of shear agitation. When more than one type of paniculate material is to be added, it is preferred that a cejlain order of addition be observed. For example, while shear agitation is maintained, essentially all of any optional surfactants in solid parliculate form can be added in the form of particles ranging in size from about 0.2 to 1,000 microns. After addition of any optional surfactant particles, particles of substantially all of an organic builder, e.g., citrate and/or fatty ncid, and/or an olkalinity source, e.p,., sodium carbonate, can be added while continuing to maintain this admixture of composition components under shear agitation. Other solid form optional ingredients can then be added to the composition at this point. Agitation of the<br><br>
mixture is continued, and if necessary, can be increased at this point to form a uniform dispersion of insoluble solid phase partieulatcs within the liquid phase.<br>
After some or all of the foregoing solid materials have been added to this<br>
agitated mixture, the panicles of the bleaching agent can be added to the<br>
composition, again while the mixture is maintained under shear agitation. By<br>
adding the bleaching agent material last, or after all or most of the other components,<br>
and especially after alkalinity source particles, have been added, desirable stability<br>
benefits for the bleach can be realized. If enzyme prills arc incorporated, they are<br>
preferably added to the nonaqucous liquid matrix last.	s,H<br>
As o final process step, after addition -of all of the participate material, agitation of the mixture is continued for a period of time sufficient to form compositions having the requisite; viscosity and phase .".lability characteristics. Frequently this will involve ngitnilon for a period of from about 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
As a variation of the composition preparation procedure hereinbefore described, one or more of the solid components may be added to the agitalcd mixture as a slurry of particles premixed with a minor portion of one or more of the liquid components. Thus a premix of a small fraction of the alcohol alkoxylate and/or nonaqucous, low-polarity solvent with particles of the organic builder material and/or the particles of the inorganic alkalinity source and/or particles of a bleach activator may be separately formed and added as a slurry to the agitated mixture of composition components. Addition of such slurry premixcs should precede addition of bleaching agent and/or cn/.yme particles which may themselves be part of H premix slurry formed in analogous fashion.<br>
The compositions of this invention, prepared as hereinbefore described, can be used to form aqueous washing solutions for use in the laundering and bleaching of fabrics. Generally, an effective amount of such compositions is added to water, preferably in a conventional fabric laundering automatic washing machine, to form such aqueous laundering/blenching solutions. The aqueous washing/bleaching solution so formed is then contacted, preferably under agitation, with the fabrics to be laundered and bleached therewith.<br>
An effective amount of the liquid detergent compositions herein added to water to form aqueous laundering/bleaching solutions can comprise amounts sufficient to form from about 500 to 7,000 ppm of composition in aqueous solution.<br>
. t,<br>
More preferably, from about 800 to 3,000 ppm of the detergent compositions herein will be provided in aqueous washing/bleaching solution.<br>
