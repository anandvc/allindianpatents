This application claims priority from Japanese<br>
Patent Application No. 2007-341406 filed on December 28,<br>
2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a straddle-type<br>
vehicle, and more specifically to a supporting structure<br>
for an exhaust system including, for example, an exhaust<br>
pipe and a muffler, and a vehicle body cover that covers<br>
a vehicle body.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
There have been proposed related motorcycles each<br>
including an exhaust system configured to include, for<br>
example, an exhaust pipe and a muffler connected to an<br>
engine, and a vehicle body cover that covers a portion of<br>
the exhaust system. For example, in a motorcycle<br>
disclosed in JP-A-2003-48591, an exhaust pipe connected<br>
to a front face of an engine is provided to extend to a<br>
vehicle-body rear portion by way of a portion below the<br>
engine, and a portion of the exhaust pipe located below<br>
the engine is covered by a vehicle body cover (lower cowl<br>
in JP-A-2003-48591) . In such a vehicle, a clearance has<br>
 <br>
to be provided between the exhaust system and the vehicle<br>
body cover to discharge hot air caused by the exhaust<br>
system. In the motorcycle disclosed in JP-A-2003-48591,<br>
an air inlet for introducing air between the exhaust<br>
system and the lower cowl is provided on a front face of<br>
the lower cowl, thereby to improve the heat radiation<br>
effect of the exhaust system.<br>
However, generally, in the conventional motorcycles<br>
such as the ones described above, an exhaust system and a<br>
vehicle body cover have been separately mounted to, for<br>
example, a vehicle body frame. Hence, there have been<br>
cases in which manufacturing errors occur concerning the<br>
mounting positions of, for example, the exhaust system<br>
and the vehicle body cover, therefore making it difficult<br>
to secure a sufficient clearance between the exhaust<br>
system and the vehicle body cover.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the<br>
above-described problems, and an object of the invention<br>
is to provide a straddle-type vehicle which enables a<br>
clearance between an exhaust system and a vehicle body<br>
cover covering a vehicle body to be secured.<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, a<br>
straddle-type vehicle according to the present invention<br>
 <br>
includes an engine; a vehicle body cover that covers a<br>
vehicle body from lateral directions; and an exhaust<br>
system that includes an exhaust pipe extending to a<br>
vehicle-body rear portion from the engine on an inner<br>
side of the vehicle body cover and that discharges an<br>
exhaust gas emitted from the engine to the vehicle-body<br>
rear side. The straddle-type vehicle includes a bracket,<br>
and the bracket includes at least a mount portion to be<br>
mounted to the vehicle body, an exhaust-system support<br>
portion for mounting the exhaust system, and a cover<br>
support portion for mounting the vehicle body cover.<br>
According to the present invention, the exhaust<br>
system and the vehicle body cover are both supported by<br>
the single bracket. Hence, compared to the case where<br>
the exhaust system and the vehicle body cover are<br>
separately supported, the probability that the clearance<br>
between the exhaust system and the vehicle body cover is<br>
narrowed due to manufacturing errors can be reduced. The<br>
straddle-type vehicle is a vehicle that allows a rider to<br>
take a seat by straddling the seat, and is any one of,<br>
for example, motorcycles (including motor scooters) and<br>
four-wheel baggies.<br>

generated by driving of the engine 2 is formed in the<br>
interior of the cylinder head 2c. A front end of an<br>
exhaust pipe 41 is connected to the exhaust path.<br>
Further, as shown in FIG. 2, the rear extensional portion<br>
22b of the main frame 22 includes an engine support<br>
portion 22d in a position below the pivot support hole<br>
22c, and a rear end of the crankcase 2a is mounted to the<br>
engine support portion 22d.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2 or 3, the kick pedal 50 is<br>
provided behind the crankcase 2a. The engine 2 is<br>
started by the kick pedal 50 pivotally rotating about a<br>
pedal axle 51 provided in the crankcase 2a. More<br>
specifically, components, such as a main shaft (not<br>
shown) , to which a rotation of the crankshaft 2d is<br>
transmitted therefrom, and a counter shaft (not shown),<br>
to which a rotation of the main shaft is transmitted<br>
therefrom, are disposed in the interior of the crankcase<br>
2a, and the pedal axle 51 is provided to be operable in<br>
association with these shafts. A base portion of the<br>
kick pedal 50 is operatively connected to the pedal axle<br>
51. The kick pedal 50 moves from a position above the<br>
pedal axle 51 (hereinafter referred to as "before-<br>
operation position" (see FIG. 3)) to a position below the<br>
pedal axle 51 (hereinafter referred to as "after-<br>
 <br>
operation position" (see FIG. 2)) about the pedal axle 51.<br>
In this movement, the kick pedal 50 rotates the pedal<br>
axle 51, thereby to start the engine 2.<br>
FIG. 4 is a perspective view of the kick pedal 50.<br>
In this figure, the kick pedal 50 in the after-operation<br>

exhaust pipe 41 includes a sloped portion 41a, and a rear<br>
extensional portion 41b that is continuous to the sloped<br>
portion 41a. An upper end of the sloped portion 41a is<br>
connected to the front face of the cylinder head 2c, and<br>
 <br>
the sloped portion 41a extends in the obliquely downward<br>
direction in front of the cylinder block 2b. The exhaust<br>
pipe 41 is bent in a lower portion of a front portion of<br>
the crankcase 2a. The rear extensional portion 41b<br>
extends to the vehicle-body rear side in a lower portion<br>
of the crankcase 2a and on the inner side of the<br>
undercover 31 (central side in the vehicle width<br>
direction) (see FIG. 1, 2, or 5). Further, as shown in<br>
FIG. 5, the lower edge 31a of the undercover 31 is<br>
located on a lateral side of the rear extensional portion<br>
41b, and a clearance is provided between the rear<br>
extensional portion 41b and the lower edge 31a of the<br>
undercover 31.<br>
The undercover 31 includes a sidewall portion 31d<br>
located on the lateral side of a lower portion of the<br>
crankcase 2a. The sidewall portion 31d is extended<br>
downward on the lateral side of the crankcase 2a, and is<br>
sloped towards the central side in the vehicle width<br>
direction. Then, the sidewall portion 31d is curved in a<br>
curved portion 31g to the outer side, and is further<br>
extended therefrom.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a rear end 41c of the exhaust<br>
pipe 41 is accommodated in the muffler 42. The interior<br>
of the muffler 42 is segmented into multiple expansion<br>
chambers. Exhaust gases from the engine 2 are discharged<br>
 <br>
from the rear end 41c of the exhaust pipe 41 into the<br>
interior of the muffler 42, then are progressively<br>
expanded, and then are emitted to the outside from the<br>
rear end of the muffler 42.<br>
The exhaust pipe 41 and the undercover 31 are<br>
supported by the vehicle body frame 20. More<br>
specifically, as shown in FIG. 2 or 3, a plate-like<br>
bracket 28 is mounted to a sidewall of the rear<br>
extensional portion 22b of the main frame 22. The<br>
exhaust pipe 41 and the undercover 31 are mounted on the<br>
bracket 28, thereby being supported by the main frame 22.<br>
FIG. 6 is an exploded perspective view of the main<br>
frame 22 and the bracket 28. In this figure, also the<br>
stopper 29 for regulating the rotation of the kick pedal<br>
50 is shown. As shown in FIG. 6, the bracket 28 is a<br>
plate-like member lengthy in the front^rear direction,<br>
and includes an exhaust-system support portion 28a on a<br>
rear side thereof for mounting the exhaust pipe 41, and a<br>
cover support portion 28b on a front side thereof for<br>
mounting the undercover 31. The exhaust-system support<br>
portion 28a and the cover support portion 28b are molded<br>
integrally. More specifically, the bracket 28 is a<br>
single member, which is continuous from the front end to<br>
the rear end, and the entirety thereof is molded by, for<br>
example, die cutting or press forming.<br>
 <br>
The bracket 28 and the stopper 29 are mounted on the<br>
main frame 22 with removable fasteners. More<br>
specifically, the bracket 28 and the stopper 29 are<br>
mounted with common bolts 4 6 and 4 6 to the main frame 22<br>
(see FIG. 2). More specifically, multiple (two, in the<br>
present example) mounting holes 22e and 22e are formed<br>
below the engine support portion 22d of the rear<br>
extensional portion 22b. Further, multiple (two, in the<br>
present example) mount holes 28e and 28e by which the<br>
bracket 28 is mounted on the main frame 22 are formed in<br>
a portion close to the central portion of the bracket 28.<br>
Further, mount holes 29b and 29b are also formed in<br>
positions in the stopper 29 corresponding to the<br>
respective mount holes 28e and 28e of the bracket 28.<br>
The bolts 46 are inserted into the mount hole 28e, the<br>
mount hole 2 9b, and the mounting hole 22e of the main<br>
frame 22. In addition to the mount holes 29b and 29b, a<br>
hole 29c for weight saving of the stopper 29 is formed in<br>
the stopper 29.<br>
The exhaust-system support portion 28a and the cover<br>
support portion 28b are formed on opposite sides to each<br>
other with the mount holes 28e and 28e being interposed<br>
therebetween. More specifically, the exhaust-system<br>
support portion 28a is formed to extend rearward from the<br>
positions where the mount holes 28e and 28e are formed to<br>
 <br>
extend frontward from the positions where the mount holes<br>
28e and 28e are formed.<br>
A mounting hole 28f is formed in a leading end of<br>
the exhaust-system support portion 28a. A bracket 43<br>
protruding upward is mounted in a portion located behind<br>
the main frame 22 in the rear extensional portion 41b of<br>
the exhaust pipe 41, and a mounting hole 43a is formed in<br>
a leading end of the bracket 43. A bolt 44 is inserted<br>
into the mounting holes 28f and 43a, and the exhaust pipe<br>
41 is mounted with the bolt 44 to the exhaust-system<br>
support portion 28a (see FIG. 3). In a portion below the<br>
engine 2, the rear extensional portion 41b obliquely<br>
extends so that the rear side thereof is located more<br>
outward in the vehicle width direction than the front<br>
side thereof, and a mounting position of the bracket 43<br>
is located behind the rear extensional portion 22b.<br>
A mounting hole 28g is formed also in a leading end<br>
of the cover support portion 28b. As shown in FIG. 5, a<br>
mount portion 31f is formed in the sidewall portion 31d<br>
of the undercover 31, and a mounting hole is formed in<br>
the mount portion 31f. A bolt 45 is inserted into the<br>
mounting hole 28g and the mounting hole of the mount<br>
portion 31f, and the undercover 31 is mounted with the<br>
bolt 45 to the cover support portion 28b. Thereby, both<br>
the exhaust pipe 41 and the undercover 31 are supported<br>
 <br>
by the main frame 22 via the common bracket 28. An<br>
annular damper 34 is fitted into an inner side of the<br>
mounting hole of the mount portion 31f, and further a<br>
cylindrical collar 35 is fitted into an inner side of the<br>
damper 34. Then, the bolt 45 is inserted into the collar<br>
35.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the bracket 28 is slightly bent<br>
in a portion close to the central portion of the bracket<br>
28 so that the cover support portion 28b is located<br>
closer to the central side in the vehicle width direction<br>
than the exhaust-system support portion 28a. Further,<br>
the cover support portion 28b extends frontward on an<br>
inner side (central side in the vehicle width direction)<br>
of the undercover 31, and the exhaust-system support<br>
portion 28a is located on the outer side in the vehicle<br>
width direction of the bracket 43 (see FIG. 3).<br>
As described above, the motorcycle 1 includes the<br>
engine 2; the vehicle body cover 30 that covers the<br>
vehicle body from the lateral directions; and the exhaust<br>
system 40 that includes the exhaust pipe 41 extending<br>
from the engine 2 to the vehicle-body rear portion on the<br>
inner side of the vehicle body cover 30 and that<br>
discharges exhaust gases emitted from the engine 2 to the<br>
vehicle-body rear side. The motorcycle 1 further<br>
includes the bracket 28. The bracket 28 includes the<br>
 <br>
mount holes 28e and 28e to be mounted to the vehicle<br>
body; the exhaust-system support portion 28a to which the<br>
exhaust system 40 (the exhaust pipe 41 in the above<br>
description) is mounted; and the cover support portion<br>
28b to which the vehicle body cover 30 (the undercover 31<br>
in the above description) is mounted. Thus, in the<br>
motorcycle 1, the exhaust pipe 41 and the under cover 31<br>
are both supported by the single bracket 28. Hence,<br>
compared to the case where the exhaust pipe 41 and the<br>
under cover 31 are separately mounted to the vehicle body,<br>
the probability that the clearance between the exhaust<br>
pipe 41 and the under cover 31 is narrowed due to<br>
manufacturing errors can be reduced.<br>
Further, in the motorcycle 1, the exhaust-system<br>
support portion 28a and cover support portion 28b of the<br>
bracket 28 are provided on the sides opposite to each<br>
other with the mount holes 28e and 28e being interposed<br>
therebetween. Thereby, the forces to be exerted on the<br>
bracket 28 can be equalized, and hence support stability<br>
can be secured.<br>
Further, in the motorcycle 1, the mount holes 28e<br>
and 28e of the bracket 28 are provided to the vehicle<br>
body with the removable fasteners (the bolts 4 6 in the<br>
above description). Thereby, maintenance work of the<br>
device disposed within the main frame 22, for example,<br>
 <br>
the engine 2 can be performed by removing the bracket 2 8<br>
from the main frame 22.<br>
Further, the motorcycle 1 includes the kick pedal 50<br>
that starts the engine 2 by rotating about the pedal axle<br>
51 provided to the engine 2, and the stopper 29 that<br>
regulates the rotation of the kick pedal 50 by contacting<br>
with the kick pedal 50. The stopper 29 is mounted<br>
together with the bracket 28 to the vehicle body.<br>
Thereby, the mounting work can be simplified, compared to<br>
the case where the bracket 28 and the stopper 29 are<br>
separately mounted to the vehicle body.<br>
Further, in the motorcycle 1, the stopper 29 and the<br>
bracket 28 are mounted with the common bolts 46 and 46 to<br>
the vehicle body. Consequently, the number of components<br>
for mounting the stopper 29 and the bracket 28 can be<br>
reduced.<br>
Further, in the motorcycle 1, the bracket 28<br>
includes the multiple mount holes 28e and 28e. Thereby,<br>
the support strength of the bracket 28 can be increased.<br>
Further, in the motorcycle 1, the mount holes 28e<br>
and 28e of the bracket 28 are provided in the main frame<br>
22. Thereby, the exhaust pipe 41 and the undercover 31<br>
can be stably supported.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the<br>
motorcycle 1 described above, but various modifications<br>
 <br>
can be made. For example, according to the above<br>
description, the exhaust pipe 41 and the undercover 31 of<br>
the exhaust system 40 are mounted to the single bracket<br>
28. However, for example, the muffler 42 and a vehicle<br>
body cover provided adjacent to the muffler 42 to cover<br>
the vehicle body from the lateral directions may be<br>
mounted to a single bracket.<br>
Further, according to the above description, the<br>
bracket 28 and the stopper 29 are mounted with the bolts<br>
4 6 to the main frame 22. However, the bracket 28 and the<br>
stopper 29 may be mounted to the main frame 22 by welding.<br>
Further, according to the above description, the<br>
bracket 28 is mounted to the main frame 22. However, the<br>
bracket 28 may be mounted to a different member. For<br>
example, a stay may be provided to the engine 2, and the<br>
bracket 28 may be mounted to the stay.<br>
