BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for locating mobile terminals,<br>
and more particularly to a method for locating mobile terminals located in an area<br>
where GPS assistance information required for location determination is not<br>
provided.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
As mobile terminals have become smaller, lighter, and more simple to use<br>
and mobile communication devices and their networks have spread worldwide,<br>
users of mobile communication services carry their mobile terminals and receive<br>
mobile communication services in addition to other services through their mobile<br>
terminals even when they travel. In the environment of a global system for<br>
mobile communications, many users also desire to receive application services<br>
(e.g., information on traffic, daily life, news, weather, location, etc.) using<br>
location information of their mobile terminals. A system to allow users to obtain<br>
their location information using the mobile terminals has been commercialized in<br>
some countries, for example, Korean mobile communication areas provided by<br>
SK telecom, KTF and the like, or Japanese or Western mobile communication<br>
areas of NTT, DoCoMo, Sprint PCS, KDDI, Vodafone and the like.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram showing the configuration of a general<br>
mobile communication system (particularly, a Global System for Mobile<br>
communication (GSM) or a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System<br>
(UMTS)). As shown in this figure, the GSM or UMTS includes a Core Network<br>
(CN) 110, a plurality of Radio Network Subsystems (RNSs) 120 and 130, and<br>
User Equipment (UE) 150.<br>
The CN 110 manages information of UEs 150, and performs mobility<br>
management, session management and call management functions.<br>
The RNS 120 or 130, serves to transfer data received from the CN 110 to<br>
users via an air interface. To this end, the RNS 120 or 130, includes a Radio<br>
Network Controller (RNC), and a plurality of base stations (node B). For<br><br>
example, the RNS 120 includes an RNC 121 and base stations (node B) 123 and<br>
125, and the RNS 130 includes an RNC 131 and base stations (node B) 133 and<br>
135.<br>
The RNC 121 or 131 is classified into a serving RNC (SRNC), a drift RNC<br>
(DRNC) and a controlling RNC (CRNC) based on its operation. The SRNC is<br>
an RNC that manages information of UEs belonging to the RNC, and handles data<br>
transmission between the UEs and the CN 110 via an Iu interface. The DRNC is<br>
an RNC that intermediates data transmission between a UE belonging to a<br>
different RNC and an RNC (for example, an SRNC) to which the UE belongs.<br>
The CRNC is an RNC that controls each of the base stations. For example, in<br>
Fig. 1, if the RNC 121 manages the information of the UE 150, the RNC 121 is an<br>
SRNC of the UE 150, and if the UE 150 moves and communicates data with the<br>
RNC 121 via the RNC 131, the RNC 131 is a DRNC of the UE 150. In addition,<br>
the RNC 121, which controls the base station (node B) 125 in communication<br>
with the UE 150, is a CRNC of the base station 125. In the example of Fig. 1,<br>
information and data of the UE 150 is transmitted and received to and from the<br>
CN 110 via the RNC 121 that is an SRNC of the UE 150.<br>
There are various methods which are typically used for locating UEs in the<br>
mobile communication network. These methods are generally divided into three<br>
types which will be described below.<br>
The first is a cell-based location method in which the location of a UE is<br>
determined based on information of a cell located nearest to the UE or based on<br>
information of a cell that manages the UE. The second is a network-based<br>
location method in which a signal measured between the node B and a UE is used<br>
to calculate a Time of Arrival (TOA) or a Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)<br>
based on the intensity of the signal or based on radio wave transfer time thereof<br>
and the location of the UE is determined by triangulation using the calculated<br>
TOA or TDOA. The third is a GPS-based location method in which the location<br>
of a UE is determined using a Global Positioning System (GPS) developed by the<br>
US Department of Defense. One particular GPS-based location method, which<br>
complements and applies the GPS technology to a mobile communication<br>
network, is called Network-Assisted GPS (AGPS).<br>
In the prior art, if a Location Service (LCS) client located external to a<br>
network requests location determination of a UE, a preparatory process for<br>
locating the UE is first performed, and a signal required to locate the UE is<br><br>
measured, and then the location of the UE is calculated based on the measured<br>
signal. In the preparatory process, a privacy indicator for limiting access to<br>
personal information or the like of the UE is read, and network resources are<br>
allocated, and then a location technique is selected according to the performance<br>
of the UE and the network, and quality of Service (QoS) requested by the LCS<br>
client. The location measurement process is performed between the Universal<br>
Terrestrial Random Access Network (UTRAN) and the UE. In this process, a<br>
location measurement signal, including a signal required to measure the location<br>
of the UE, is obtained and then the location of the UE is calculated using the<br>
location technique selected in the preparatory process. Here, the UE must be an<br>
individual UE whose Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number (MSISDN) or<br>
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is already known.<br>
The above location measurement process is performed frequently when the<br>
UE moves out of a Gateway Mobile Location Center (GMLC), which is registered<br>
as a home GMLC of the UE in the CN, and it is thus located in another GMLC or<br>
when a location service for locating the UE is requested by an external LCS client<br>
or the UE itself. Here, the GMLC manages location information of UEs located<br>
in a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN). The PLMN is a geographically or<br>
logically distinguishable mobile communication network, and one PLMN may<br>
include one or more GMLCs.<br>
Fig. 2 is a process flow diagram showing a conventional method for<br>
locating mobile terminals, particularly when an external LCS client (hereinafter<br>
referred to as a "client") 160 requests location determination of a UE_A 155.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the client 160 requests a location service (LCS) of a<br>
UE, the location of which the client 160 desires to know, from a requesting<br>
GMLC 111 connected to the client 160 (S11). That is, the client 160 requests<br>
location information of the UE_A 155 from the requesting GMLC 111. The<br>
"requesting" GMLC 111 is a GMLC that "requests" location of the UE_A 155.<br>
Then, the requesting GMLC 111 requests home PLMN information of the<br>
UE_A 155 from a Home Location Register/Home Subscriber Server (HLR/HSS)<br>
115 (SI3), and receives the home PLMN information from the HLR/HSS 115<br>
(SI5). As a server storing roaming information and registrant information of<br>
UEs, the HLR/HSS 115 responds to the request from the requesting GMLC 111<br>
using the stored registrant information of the UEs. That is, in response to the<br>
request from the requesting GMLC 111, the HLR/HSS 115 provides the home<br><br>
PLMN information of the UE_A 155 to the requesting GMLC 111 (SI 5).<br>
Then, using the home PLMN information of the UE_A 155 received from<br>
the HLR/HSS 115 at step SI5, the requesting GMLC 111 requests information of<br>
a visited PLMN, where the UE_A 155 is currently located, from a home GMLC<br>
113 of the UE_A 155 (SI 7). In response to the request from the requesting<br>
GMLC 111, the home GMLC 113 requests and receives information of the visited<br>
PLMN from the HLR/HSS 115 (S21, S23, respectively) after performing<br>
authentication for privacy protection (S19). Using the visited PLMN<br>
information, the home GMLC 113 requests the location information of the UE_A<br>
155 from a GMLC 117 in the visited PLMN (S25). Since it belongs to the<br>
visited PLMN where the UE_A 155 is currently located, the GMLC 117 is<br>
referred to as a "visited GMLC".<br>
The location of the UE_A 155 is calculated in the visited GMLC 117 in the<br>
PLMN being visited by the UE_A 155, an MSC/SGSN (Mobile-services<br>
Switching Center / Serving GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) Support Node)<br>
119, a Radio Access Network (RAN) 170 and the UE_A 155 (S27).<br>
As described above, the mobile communication network generally uses<br>
three location methods, i.e., a cell ID-based location method, a TDOA location<br>
method, and an A-GPS location method. The PLMN being visited by the UE_A<br>
155 can also use one of the three location methods to measure the location of the<br>
UE_A 155. Depending on the burden on network resources or depending on<br>
where the location calculation is performed, the conventional location methods<br>
described above can be classified into the following two types. The first type is<br>
a UE-based location method in which the location of a UE is calculated by the UE<br>
itself based on pseudo range information and location assistance information.<br>
The second type is a UE-assisted location method in which a UE obtains pseudo<br>
range information using GPS assistance information (or A-GPS information)<br>
acquired from GPS satellite signals, and it then transfers the pseudo range<br>
information to an RNC managing an LCS service of the UE so that the location of<br>
the UE is calculated in the network.<br>
In the example of Fig. 2, the request for the location information of the<br>
UE_A 155 transferred to the GMLC 117 being visited by the UE_A 155 is<br>
transferred to the RAN 170 via the MSC/SGSN 119. In the UE-based location<br>
method, a serving RNC of the UE_A 155 transmits its A-GPS information to the<br>
UE_A 155 so that the UE_A 155 calculates its own location. In the UE-assisted<br><br>
location method, the UE_A 155 transmits the acquired GPS pseudo range<br>
information to an RNC so that the location of the UE_A 155 is calculated in the<br>
network.<br>
If the location of the UE_A 155 has been calculated based on one of the<br>
UE-based and UE-assisted methods at step S27, the visited GMLC 117 transfers<br>
the calculated location information of the UE_A 155 to the home GMLC 113.<br>
The home GMLC 113 transfers the location information received from the visited<br>
GMLC 117 to the client 160 via the requesting GMLC 111 (S33, S35) after again<br>
performing authentication (S31).<br>
However, when an external LCS client or a UE requests a location service<br>
of the UE located in a PLMN that includes no location calculation system such as<br>
a Location Measurement Unit (LMU) or a Serving Mobile Location Center<br>
(SMLC), the conventional methods for locating mobile terminals (i.e., UEs)<br>
cannot calculate the location of the UE. That is, if the visited PLMN, where the<br>
UE is located, provides no location assistance information, the PLMN returns a<br>
failure response to the location measurement request from the UE or the LCS<br>
client.<br>
The conventional location methods cannot obtain improved location<br>
service results over standalone GPS location measurement in a mobile<br>
communication network that provides no basic location service. For example, in<br>
the conventional location methods, an LCS client cannot obtain location<br>
information of a UE that is traveling to an accident area or is moving to a troubled<br>
area, and a UE cannot independently utilize travel or geographical information<br>
using an LCS service provided by its home PLMN, and also cannot independently<br>
check its location information to use an LCS service database stored in the UE.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above<br>
problem, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
locating mobile terminals, which can obtain location information of a mobile<br>
terminal irrespective of the area or communication network where the mobile<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with<br>
reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of<br>
known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may<br>
make the subject matter of the present invention unclear.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagram illustrating the configuration of a network for locating mobile<br>
terminals according to an embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is<br>
useful particularly when a PLMN 220 visited by a target UE 155, the location of which is<br>
to be determined, supports no location service (LCS). The target UE 155 is connected to<br>
a Core Network (CN) 210 via a Radio Access Network (RAN) such as a base station<br>
(node B) 221 or an SRNC (Serving RNC)	<br><br>
222. A plurality of data (for example, pseudo range data acquired from a GPS<br>
satellite signal, a satellite ID, and a reference time when a GPS signal is acquired)<br>
required for location determination of the UE 155 is encapsulated with an IP<br>
address. Using routing information stored in a Visitor Location Register (VLR),<br>
the encapsulated data is transferred to a home GMLC 231 in a home PLMN 230,<br>
to which the UE 155 belongs, after passing through an SGSN 223 and a GGSN<br>
(Gateway GPRS Support Node) 224 that support a packet data service.<br>
The home PLMN 230 needs to perform location service authentication,<br>
approval, and location calculation of the UE 155 using its internal resources. To<br>
accomplish this, the home PLMN 230 needs to include therein network<br>
components such as an SGSN 232, an HLR/HSS 233, a Privacy Profile Register<br>
(PPR) 234 and Mobile Location Centers (MLCs) such as a serving MLC 235 and<br>
dedicated MLC 236.<br>
If an external LCS client 240 desires to measure the location of the UE 155,<br>
the external LCS client 240 requests an LCS service from the home GMLC 231<br>
after connecting to a requesting GMLC 241 using routing information such as an<br>
IMSI, an MSISDN or an IP address.<br>
Fig. 4 is a flow diagram illustrating a method for locating mobile terminals<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In particular, this<br>
figure illustrates an example of the location method where the location of a UE_A<br>
155 is calculated in a UE-assisted method at the request of an external LCS client<br>
(hereinafter, referred to as a "client") 240 for location of the UE_A 155.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the client 240 requests a location service (LCS) of a<br>
UE, the location of which the client 240 desires to know, from a requesting<br>
GMLC 241 connected with the client 240 (S101). That is, the client 240<br>
requests location information of the UE_A 155 from the requesting GMLC 240.<br>
In this process, the client 240 transmits identification of the UE, the location of<br>
which it desires to know, to the requesting GMLC 241. The "requesting" GMLC<br>
241 is a GMLC that "requests" location of the UE_A 155.<br>
Then, using the UE identification information (for example, an IMSI or an<br>
IP address) received from the client 240, the requesting GMLC 241 requests home<br>
PLMN information (for example, routing information of a home GMLC 231) of<br>
the UE_A 155 from an HLR/HSS 233 (S103), and receives the home PLMN<br>
information from the HLR/HSS 233 (S105). As a server storing roaming<br><br>
information and registrant information of UEs, the HLR/HSS 233 responds to the<br>
request from the requesting GMLC 241 using the stored registrant information of<br>
the UEs. That is, in response to the request from the requesting GMLC 241, the<br>
HLR/HSS 233 provides the home PLMN information of the UE_A 155 to the<br>
requesting GMLC 241.<br>
Then, using the routing information of the home GMLC 231 of the UE_A<br>
155 received from the HLR/HSS 233 at step S105, the requesting GMLC 241<br>
requests location information of the UE_A 155 from the home GMLC 231 of the<br>
UE_A 155 (SI 07). In response to the request from the requesting GMLC 241,<br>
the home GMLC 213 requests and receives information of a PLMN visited by the<br>
UE_A 155 from the HLR/HSS 233 (S111, SI 13) after performing authentication<br>
for privacy protection (S109).<br>
In another embodiment, the steps of acquiring the routing information of<br>
the home GMLC 231 (SI03 and S105), and the steps of acquiring the routing<br>
information of the UE_A 155 existing in the roaming zone (S111, S113) may be<br>
implemented in two steps; one step for simultaneously requesting routing<br>
information of home GMLC 231 and routing information of UE_A 155 existing in<br>
a roaming zone and the other step for simultaneously receiving the routing<br>
information of both the home GMLC 231 and the UE_A 155 existing in the<br>
roaming zone by the requesting GMLC 241. For example, the requesting GMLC<br>
241 simultaneously requests both the information of the home GMLC 231 of the<br>
target UE_A 155 and the information (for example, the IP address of a visited<br>
GGNS) for routing to the visited PLMN where the UE_A 155 is located at the<br>
requested time.<br>
After the routing information acquisition, the home GMLC 231 checks,<br>
based on the visited PLMN information, whether the visited PLMN is a remote<br>
area (S115). That is, the home GMLC 231 checks whether the visited PLMN is<br>
an area not supporting the A-GPS function. If the visited PLMN is an area not<br>
supporting the A-GPS function, the home GMLC 231 calculates location<br>
assistance information of the UE_A 155 located in the visited PLMN (S117), and<br>
transmits a message requesting location information of the UE_A 155, together<br>
with the location assistance information, to the visited GGSN 224 in the visited<br>
PLMN (S119).<br>
At step S117, based on a cell ID received from the visited PLMN of the<br>
UE_A 155, the home GMLC 231 calculates GPS satellite orbit and geographical<br><br>
information of a corresponding cell where the UE_A 155 is present. Then, based<br>
on the calculation result, the home GMLC 231 calculates effective location<br>
assistance information (for example, GPS navigation parameters) to allow the<br>
UE_A 155 to effectively acquire GPS signals (UE-assisted LCS) and also to<br>
perform improved location calculation using acquired raw GPS data (UE-based<br>
LCS).<br>
To carry out the above step SI 17, the home GMLC 231 preferably includes<br>
a database (DB) for allowing it to obtain geographical information of each of a<br>
plurality of PLMNs using the cell ID of each of the PLMNs. For example, using<br>
approximate location information of the visited PLMN (for example, geographical<br>
information such as "Suwon" and "Daegu" (the names of some Korean cities)<br>
managed in the HLR 233, the home PLMN 231 detects the geographical<br>
information (for example, latitude and longitude) of the visited PLMN from the<br>
database (DB) and then calculates location assistance information of the visited<br>
PLMN using the detected geographical information.<br>
Some examples of the location assistance information calculated at step<br>
S117 can include the number of satellites, satellite IDs, GPS satellite reference<br>
time, ionospheric delay correction information, ephemeris and clock correction<br>
information, UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) offset, satellite almanac, an<br>
invisible satellite list, Doppler model coefficients, Doppler search window size,<br>
approximate geographical information of a cell of interest, and code phase-related<br>
information. These information items, together with the IP address, are<br>
encapsulated in a packet, which is then transferred to the visited GGSN 224.<br>
The visited GGSN 224 is a GGSN that belongs to the PLMN being visited by the<br>
UE_A155.<br>
Fig. 6A illustrates an example of the format of a message 510 transmitted<br>
from the home GMLC 231 to the GGSN 224 at the above step S119. As shown<br>
in Fig. 6a, the message 510 includes an LCS session request flag field 511, a<br>
source IP address field 512, a destination IP address field 513, a client ID field<br>
514, a location calculation type field 515 and a location assistance information<br>
field 516.<br>
The LCS session request flag field 511 stores a flag informing the UE_A<br>
155 that the message 510 is a location information request message. The source<br>
IP address field 512 stores the IP address of the home GMLC 231, and the<br>
destination IP address field 513 stores the IP address of the UE_A 155. The<br><br>
client ID field 514 stores the ID of a client requesting the location of the UE_A<br>
155, which is used for authentication of the request for location information of the<br>
UE_A 155. The location calculation type field 515 stores the type of location<br>
calculation. Specifically, the location calculation type field 515 stores<br>
information indicating whether the location calculation type is "UE-based", in<br>
which the UE_A 155 itself carries out the location calculation of the UE_A 155,<br>
or "UE-assisted type", in which the home GMLC 231 calculates the location of<br>
the UE_A 155 based on a GPS pseudorange measured by the UE_A 155. In the<br>
example of Fig. 4, since the location calculation type is UE-assisted, the location<br>
calculation type field 515 of the message transmitted at step S119 stores<br>
information indicating that the location calculation type is UE-assisted.<br>
 The location assistance information field 516 stores location assistance<br>
information of the UE_A 155 measured by the home GMLC 231. This field may<br>
also store location assistance information selected based on characteristics of the<br>
UE_A 155 that are previously determined by the home GMLC 231. When<br>
receiving the message 510 configured as shown in Fig. 6A from the home GMLC<br>
231 at step S119, the GGSN 224 transfers the message to the UE_A 155 via the<br>
MSC/SGSN 223 and the Radio Access Network (RAN) 270 (S121, S123 and<br>
S124). Here, depending on available network resources or traffic states among<br>
location assistance information stored in the home GMLC 231, the home<br>
GMLC 231 may transfer only location assistance information for acquiring an<br>
initial GPS signal to the UE_A 155, and may use the remaining available location<br>
assistance information in location calculation when a pseudorange measurement<br>
is received from the UE_A 155.<br>
The message transfer from the home GMLC 231 to the RAN 270 is<br>
performed in the same manner as packet transmission in the general GPRS<br>
support network. Specifically, the message 510 is converted into packet data<br>
(e.g., a PDP Packet Data Protocol PDU Protocol Data Unit), and the packet data is<br>
then encapsulated according to a GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP). The<br>
encapsulated packet data is transferred to the RAN 270 along a transmission path<br>
tunneled to the RAN 270, which is then transferred from the RAN 270 to an upper<br>
application layer of the UE_A 155 through the Packet Data Convergence Protocol<br>
(PDCP).<br>
Then, the UE_A 155 checks location calculation type included in the<br>
message 510, and performs processing according to the location calculation type.<br>
In the example of Fig. 4, since the location calculation type is UE-assisted, the<br><br>
UE-A 155 measures a GPS pseudorange of the UE-A 155 using the location assistance<br>
information included in the message 510 (S125). Then, the UE_A 155 transfers the<br>
calculation result to the home GMLC 231 via the RAN 270, the MSC/SGGN 223 and the<br>
visited GGSN 224 (S126, S127, S129 and S131). Here, the GPS pseudorange is routed<br>
and transferred to the home GMLC 231 after being encapsulated with the IP address of<br>
the home GMLC 231. Fig. 6B illustrates the format of a message carrying the location<br>
information of the UE_A 155.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6B, a message 520 transmitted from the UE_A 155 to the GMLC 231<br>
includes an LCS response flag field 521, a source IP address (i. e., the<br> IP address<br>
of the UE-A 155) field 522, a destination IP address (i. e., the IP . address of the home<br>
GMLC 231) field 523, a client ID field 524, a location calculation type field 525 and a<br>
GPS pseudorange (of the UE_A 155) field 526. A detailed description of data stored in<br>
these fields is omitted herein since it is similar to the description of Fig. 6A.<br>
When receiving the GPS pseudorange of the UE-A 155, the home GMLC 231 calculates<br>
the location of the UE_A 155 using the GPS pseudorange (S133), and transfers the<br>
calculation result to the client 240 via the requesting GMLC 241.<br>
Fig. 5 is a process flow diagram showing a method for locating mobile terminals<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In particular, this figure shows<br>
an example of the location method where the location of the UE_A 155 is calculated in a<br>
UE-based method at the request of an external LCS client (hereinafter, referred to as a<br>
"client") 240 for location of the UE_A 155.<br>
Steps S201 to S224 of Fig. 5 are similar to steps S 101 to S124 of Fig. 4 and thus a<br>
detailed description of steps S201 to S224 will be omitted. However, since the location<br>
calculation type is UE-based in the example of Fig. 5, part of the message 510<br>
transferred from the GMLC 231 to the UE_A 155 at steps S219 to S224 is different from<br>
that of Fig. 4. That is, the location calculation type field 515 of the message 510 of Fig.<br>
5 stores information indicating that the location calculation type is UE-based. The<br>
method for transferring the message from the home GMLC 231 to the RAN 270 at steps<br>
S219 to S224 is similar to that of Fig. 4 described above, and thus a detailed description<br>
thereof will be omitted.<br>
Then, the UE_A 155 checks location calculation type included in the message 510, and<br>
performs processing according to the location calculation type.<br><br>
In the example of Fig. 5, since the location calculation type is UE-based, the UE-A 155<br>
measures a GPS pseudorange of the UE_A 155 using the location assistance information<br>
included in the message 510, and calculates the location of the UE A 155 based on the<br>
measured GPS pseudorange (S225). Then, the UE_A 155 transfers the calculation result<br>
to the client 240 via the RAN 270, the MSC/SGGN 223 and the visited GGSN 224, the<br>
home GMLC 231 and the requesting GMLC 241 (S226, S227, S229, S231, S235 and<br>
S237). Here, the location information of the UF-A 155 is routed and transferred to the<br>
home GMLC 231 after being encapsulated with the IP address of the home GMLC 231.<br>
Fig. 6C illustrates the format of a message carrying the location information of the UE A<br>
155.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6C, a message 530 transmitted from the, UE A 155 to the GMLC 231<br>
includes an LCS response flag field 531, a source IP address (i. e., the<br> IP address<br>
of the UE-A 155) field 532, a destination IP address (i. e., the IP address of the home<br>
GMLC 231) field 533, a client ID field 534, a location calculation type field 535 and a<br>
GPS location information (of the UE-A 155) field 536. A detailed description of data<br>
stored in these fields is omitted herein since it is similar to the description of Fig. 6A.<br>
Fig. 7 is a flow diagram showing a method for locating mobile terminals according to a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention. In particular, this figure illustrates an<br>
example of the location method where the location of a UE A 155 is calculated in a UE-<br>
assisted method at the request of the UE-A 155 for location of the UE_A 155 located in an<br>
area (called a "remote area") not supporting the A-GPS function. Here, the UE_A 155 is a<br>
target UE, the location of which is to be determined. The UE_A 155 needs to request the<br>
location thereof in a remote area as in this example in the case where, in an area not<br>
supporting the A-GPS function, the UE_A 155 desires to independently know its location<br>
information to use an LCS service database stored in the UE_A 155 or to utilize travel or<br>
geographic information using an LCS service provided from the PLMN.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the UE_A 155 first needs to connect to a network to request its<br>
location. To connect to the network, the UE-A 155 requests network connection from an<br>
MSC/SGSN 223 via a Radio Access Network (RAN) 270 (S301, S303), and receives, as a<br>
response to the request, network connection approval from the MSC/SGSN 223 (S305),<br>
and then connects to the network via an authentication process with the MSC/SGSN 223<br>
(S307). If the UE_A 155<br><br>
has already been connected to the network, steps S301 to S307 can be omitted.<br>
When connected to the network, the UE_A 155 requests location<br>
information of the UE_A 155 from the MSC/SGSN 223 via the RAN 270 (S309).<br>
Then, after determining that a PLMN being visited by the UE_A 155 itself<br>
cannot provide location information (for example, it cannot support the A-GPS<br>
function), the SGSN 223 receives routing information (for example, the IP<br>
address of a home GMLC 231) of a home PLMN of the UE_A 155 from the<br>
Visitor Location Register (VLR) 225 (S311, S313), and then transmits a message<br>
requesting location information of the UE_A 155 to a GGSN 224 of the visited<br>
PLMN (S315). Here, the SGSN 223 transmits the location information request<br>
message, together with the IP address of the home GMLC 231, to the GGSN 224.<br>
Fig. 9A illustrates the format of a location information request message<br>
610 to be transferred to the GGSN 224. As shown in Fig. 9A, the location<br>
information request message 610 includes an LCS session request flag field 611, a<br>
UE_A ID (for example, an IMSI and an IP address of the UE_A 155) field 612, a<br>
cell ID field 613, and a location calculation type field 614. The location<br>
information request message 610 may further include an expiration time<br>
information field 616 indicating an expiration time of the request information and<br>
a location QoS field 615 to guarantee the quality of service.<br>
After receiving the UE_A location information request message 610 as<br>
shown in Fig. 9a, together with the IP address of the home GMLC 231, from the<br>
MSC/SGSN 223 at step S315, the GGSN 224 requests the location of the UE_A<br>
155 from the home GMLC 231 using the IP address of the home GMLC 231<br>
(S317). That is, the GGSN 224 transfers the location information request<br>
message 610 to the home GMLC 231. Here, as shown in Fig. 9A, the location<br>
information request message 610 includes cell information (for example, a cell<br>
ID) of a cell being visited by the UE_A 155, which is necessary to support the<br>
remote A-GPS function.<br>
After receiving the location information request message 610, the home<br>
GMLC 231 requests authentication of the service from the HLR/HSS 233 (S319),<br>
and in response to this request, the HLR/HSS 233 performs authentication of the<br>
service and processing for privacy protection (S321), and then transfers the<br>
authentication (e.g., an approval) result to the home GMLC 231 (S323).<br>
If the home GMLC 231 receives approval of the service at steps S319 to<br><br>
S323, the home GMLC 231 calculates location assistance information of the<br>
UE_A 115 (S325), and then transmits the calculated location assistance<br>
information to the visited GGSN 224 of the visited PLMN (S327).<br>
At step S325, based on a cell ID received from the visited PLMN of the<br>
UE_A 155, the home GMLC 231 calculates GPS satellite orbit and geographical<br>
information of a corresponding cell where the UE_A 155 is present. Then, based<br>
on the calculation result, the home GMLC 231 calculates effective location<br>
assistance information (for example, GPS navigation parameters) to allow the<br>
UE_A 155 to effectively acquire GPS signals (UE-assisted LCS) and also to<br>
perform improved location calculation using acquired raw GPS data (UE-based<br>
LCS).<br>
To carry out the above step S325, the home GMLC 231 preferably includes<br>
a database (DB) for allowing it to obtain geographical information of each of a<br>
plurality of PLMNs using the cell ID of each of the PLMNs. For example, using<br>
the cell ID of the visited PLMN, the home PLMN 231 detects the geographical<br>
information of the visited PLMN from the database (DB) and then calculates<br>
location assistance information of the UE_A 155 located in the visited PLMN<br>
using the detected geographical information.<br>
Some examples of the location assistance information calculated at step<br>
S325 are the number of satellites, satellite IDs, GPS satellite reference time,<br>
ionospheric delay correction information, ephemeris and clock correction<br>
information, UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) offset, satellite almanac, an<br>
invisible satellite list, Doppler model coefficients, Doppler search window size,<br>
approximate geographical information of a cell of interest, and code phase-related<br>
information. After receiving the location assistance information at step S327,<br>
the GGSN 224 transfers the location assistance information to the UE_A 155 via<br>
the MSC/SGSN 223 and the RAN 270 (S329, S331 and S333). Here, only<br>
location assistance information for acquiring an initial GPS signal may be<br>
transferred to the UE_A 155, and the remaining available location assistance<br>
information may be used in location calculation when a pseudorange<br>
measurement is received from the UE_A 155. The location assistance<br>
information transferred from the home GMLC 231 to the UE_A 155 is in the form<br>
of a message 620 as shown in Fig. 9B. As shown in Fig. 9, the location<br>
assistance information transfer message 620 includes a source (home GMLC) IP<br>
address field 621, a destination (UE_A) IP address field 622, a location<br>
calculation type field 623 and a location assistance information field 624. In the<br><br>
example of Fig. 7, since the location calculation type is UE-assisted, the location<br>
calculation type field 623 stores information indicating that the location<br>
calculation type is UE-assisted.<br>
After receiving the location assistance information at step S333, the UE_A<br>
155 measures a GPS pseudorange of the UE_A 155 using the location assistance<br>
information (S335). The UE_A 155 then transfers the measured GPS<br>
pseudorange to the home GMLC 231 via the RAN 270, the MSC/SGGN 223 and<br>
the visited GGSN 224 (S337, S339, S341 and S343). The GPS pseudorange is<br>
routed and transferred to the home GMLC 231 after being encapsulated with the<br>
IP address of the home GMLC 231.<br>
Fig. 9C shows an example of a message 630 for transferring the GPS<br>
pseudorange to the home GMLC 231. As shown in Fig. 9C, the GPS<br>
pseudorange transfer message 630 includes a source (UE_A) IP address field 631,<br>
a destination (home GMLC) IP address 632, a location calculation type field 633<br>
and a UE_A GPS pseudorange field 634.<br>
The message transfer at steps S337 to S343 is preferably performed in a<br>
packet data tunneling mode based on the GTP protocol as in the message transfer<br>
from the home GMLC 231 to the RAN 270 in Fig. 4. After receiving the GPS<br>
pseudorange of the UE_A 155 at steps S337 to S343, the home GMLC 231<br>
calculates the location of the UE_A 155 using the received GPS pseudorange<br>
(S345), and transfers the calculation result to the UE_A 155 via the visited GGSN<br>
224 and the MSC/SGSN 223 (S347, S349 and S351). The home GMLC 231<br>
may also transfer the calculation result (for example, location information of the<br>
UE_A) to the client 240 (S353).<br>
Fig. 9D shows an example of a message 640 for transferring the location<br>
information of the UE_A 155. As shown in Fig. 9D, the UE_A location<br>
information transfer message 640 includes a source (home GMLC) IP address<br>
field 641, a destination (UE_A) IP address 642, a location calculation type field<br>
643 and a UE_A location information field 644.<br>
Fig. 8 is a flow diagram showing a method for locating mobile terminals<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In particular, this<br>
figure illustrates an example of the location method where the location of a UE_A<br>
155 is calculated in a UE-based method at the request of the UE_A 155 for<br>
location of the UE_A 155 located in an area (called a "remote area") not<br><br>
supporting the A-GPS function. As in this example, the UE_A 155 needs to<br>
request the location thereof in a remote area in such a case as described above at<br>
the beginning of the description of Fig. 7.<br>
Steps S401 to S433 of Fig. 8 are similar to steps S301 to S333 of Fig. 7,<br>
and thus a detailed description of steps S401 to S433 will be omitted. However,<br>
since the location calculation type is UE-based in the example of Fig. 8, part of<br>
the message 610 transferred at steps S409, S415 and S417 is different from that of<br>
Fig. 7. That is, the location calculation type field 623 of the message 610 of Fig.<br>
8 stores information indicating that the location calculation type is UE-based.<br>
The method for transferring the message 610 is similar to that of Fig. 7 described<br>
above, and thus a detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
After receiving the location assistance information at step S433, the UE_A<br>
155 measures the GPS pseudorange of the UE_A 155 using the location<br>
assistance information and then calculates the location of the UE_A 155 using the<br>
measured GPS pseudorange (S435). Then, the UE_A 155 transfers the<br>
calculation result to the client 240 via the RAN 270, the MSC/SGGN 223, the<br>
visited GGSN 224 and the home GMLC 231 (S437, S439, S441, S443 and S445).<br>
The location information of the UE_A 155 is routed and transferred to the home<br>
GMLC 231 after being encapsulated with the IP address of the home GMLC.<br>
Fig. 9E shows an example of a message 650 for transferring the location<br>
information of the UE_A 155. As shown in Fig. 9E, the UE_A location<br>
information transfer message 650 includes a source (UE_A) IP address field 651,<br>
a destination (home GMLC) IP address 652, a location calculation type field 653<br>
and a UE_A location information field 654.<br>
In the first and second embodiments of the present invention, the UE_A<br>
155 is an IP support terminal that can perform both encapsulation and<br>
decapsulation.<br>
As apparent from the above description, the present invention provides a<br>
method for locating mobile terminals that has the following features and<br>
advantages. First, location information of a mobile terminal can be obtained<br>
irrespective of the area or communication network where the mobile terminal is<br>
located. It is thus possible to locate a mobile terminal in an area where no<br>
location assistance information is provided. In addition, location assistance<br>
information of a mobile terminal, the location of which is to be determined, is<br>
produced based on location information of a home communication network of the<br><br>
mobile terminal received through a packet network, thereby obtaining effective<br>
and accurate location information. Further, continuity and integrity of a location<br>
service can be provided even when the mobile terminal is roaming.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been<br>
disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing<br>
from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.<br>
Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should not be limited to the<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE: A HOME PUBLIC LAND MOBILE NETWORK(PLMN) METHOD FOR<br>
LOCATING MOBILE TERMINALS<br>
The invention relates to a home Public Land Mobile Network, PLMN, method for<br>
locating mobile terminals, comprising the steps of receiving, by a home PLMN<br>
(230) a request message (S101,S107) of location service for a target terminal<br>
(155) which is roaming; checking (S111, S113), by the home PLMN (230),<br>
information of a visited PLMN (220) visisted by the target terminal (155), in<br>
response to the request message of location service;determining (S115), by the<br>
home PLMN (230), if the visited PLMN (220) provides location assistance<br>
information using the checked information of the visited PLMN (220); if the<br>
visited PLMN (220) does not provide location assistance information, calculating<br>
(S117), by the home PLMN (230), location assistance information regarding the<br>
A-GPS positioning of the target terminal (155) using information corresponding<br>
to a cell ID of the target terminal (155) in the visited PLMN; and transferring<br>
(S135, S137), by the home PLMN (230), the location assistance information of<br>
the target terminal (155).</td>
