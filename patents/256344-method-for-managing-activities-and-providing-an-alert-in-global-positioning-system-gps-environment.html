				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to the Mobile Telecommunication and Wireless Networks. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for managing activities and providing an alert in GPS environment.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Currently the mobile phone user schedules the appointments in the scheduler by assigning date/time (when the activity needs to be completed) to the respective activity. The user is alerted for the activity at the specified time. In such a solution there is no provision where in the user can specify the appointments that she/he would like to complete once they reach a specific place (e. g. home/office/market/friends place).<br>
Following are the steps for the related art as it exists:<br>
1.	The user selects the scheduler from the user interface menu options.<br>
2.	The user inputs the activities along with the date/time when the reminder needs to be provided to the user.<br>
3.	At the specified date/time of a certain activity the software in the mobile phone alerts the user with the activity.<br><br>
A back ground process keeps on monitoring if the user has to be alerted for a specific activity at a specific time. If the user needs to be alerted then at the specified time an alert is sent to the user through the user interface along with the activity to be completed.<br>
The existing art does not provide an option of co-relating a scheduled activity with the place where it has to be completed. The current art just provides means to co-relate the time with the activity, this leaves the user with making it sure that at the designated time she/he is at the place where the scheduled activity has to be completed.<br>
Additionally if the user is at a location prior to the scheduled time, the user is not alerted for the activity to be completed at that location as the activity is linked to the time and not the location<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a solution along with the scheduler to link the activities that need to be completed at a specific place with date/time being optional.<br><br>
The proposed invention is a solution in GPS enabled mobile phone for linking the activities with the location where they need to be completed and a method for alerting the user with the scheduled activities at the specified place.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for managing activities and providing an alert in GPS enabled mobile phones when entering a specific location comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	downloading the GPS maps of the specific locations by the GPS enabled mobile phone;<br>
(b)	storing the GPS co-ordinates of the said specific locations and assigning a name to each such location stored in the mobile phone;<br>
(c)	scheduling the appointments by selecting the location along with a radius value by the user;<br>
(d)	alerting the user with the list of things to be completed at that location once the user enters the specific location.<br>
The said radius value is the radius of the region from the GPS co-ordinate of the location, entering into which the user wants to be alerted with the activities associated with that location. The step of scheduling the appointments includes preparing a list of things to be completed at the specified location. The step of scheduling the appointments includes providing a time line by the user within which each task needs to be completed. Scheduling the appointments involves the user prepares a list for each location which contains the activities to be completed at that location and optionally the time line associated with each<br><br>
activity. A user entered specific location is identified by the radius from the GPS Co-ordinate of the location. The user provides the periodicity with which the GPS co-ordinates needs to be checked with the specified location. Also the user provides a value to indicate the number of times the user needs to be alerted with the list of activities upon entering a specified location.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of this invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts the way the GPS co-ordinates of a location are stored by the user.<br>
Figure 2 This is expanded form of Figure 1 to depict the way the GPS coordinates of a location are stored by the user.<br>
Figure 3 depicts the flow chart of how the provisioning of the activities based on the location cans be done.<br>
Figure 4 is a sample GPS map downloaded from Map Software that comes along with a GPS receiver.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The proposed invention is a solution where in the activities scheduled can be coupled with the location where the activities need to be completed. The user also has an option of providing a time line along with each activity. The method for the same is depicted in the flow chart.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the way the GPS co-ordinates of a location are stored by the user. The user stores the various locations with a name attached to each such location. User along with GPS co-ordinates stores the radius of the region coming into which the user wants to be alerted. The user can find out the GPS coordinates by downloading a GPS map. It is assumed that User Interface at the mobile handset provides the facility to select a particular area (either using GPS<br><br>
map or simple txt input mechanism). User Interface also provides a mechanism to input additional required information (e.g. radius, activities to be done at the selected place).<br>
In the figure 1 it shows exemplary selection (e.g. home, office, market). User has provided radius information for all these selected areas.<br>
Figure 2 depicts the way the GPS co-ordinates of a location are stored by the user. This is same as Figure 1 with but it is shown in the expanded form to show the selected area clearly (shown as small circles in Figure 1). The user stores the various locations with a name attached to each such location. User along with GPS co-ordinates stores the radius of the region coming into which the user wants to be alerted. The user can find out the GPS co-ordinates by downloading a GPS map<br>
Figure 3 depicts the flow chart of how the provisioning of the activities based on the location cans be done and also how the user is alerted with the list of activities once she/he enters the region as specified by the radius associated with each location.<br>
Figure 2 explains the working of the invention in a flowchart.<br>
1. The user first configures and stores the list of activities to be done at each location in the GPS enabled mobile.<br>
2. The user also provides the radius value with each location co-ordinates.<br><br>
3. The GPS enabled mobile continuously or periodically monitors the current GPS location with the locations specified in the scheduler.<br>
4. Then a check is made to find out if the distance between the current and the specified location is less than the radius.<br>
5. If the said value is not less than the radius then monitoring is resumed with the interval specified by the user.<br>
6.  If the said value is less than the radius then a check is made for the number of reminders.<br>
7.  If the maximum limit for the reminder has not reached then the user is alerted with the associated list of the specified location.<br>
The invention proposes the following to link the activities with the place where they need to be completed:<br>
1. The GPS enabled mobile phone user downloads the GPS map of the locations where she/he visits frequently. This map can be downloaded from various software that provides GPS maps.<br><br>
2. The mobile user stores the GPS co-ordinates of these locations and optionally assigns a name to each such location stored in the mobile phone.<br>
3. When scheduling the appointments the user selects the location along with a radius value (this value is the radius of the region from the GPS coordinate of the location, entering into which the user wants to be alerted with the activities associated with that location) and prepares a list of things to be completed at the specified location. If desired the user can also provide a time line within which each task needs to be completed.<br>
4. In this way the user for each location prepares a list which contains the activities to be completed at that location and (optional) the time line associated with each activity. This would enable the user to provide either just Location OR just timeline OR both location and timeline.<br>
5. Once the user enters the regions (identified by the radius from the GPS Co-ordinate of the location) the user is alerted with the list of things to be completed at that location.<br>
6. The user can also provide the periodicity with which the current GPS coordinates needs to checked with the specified location in order to determine if the user has entered one of the regions where the alert has to be provided.<br><br>
7. Also the user can provide a value to indicate the number of times she/he needs to be alerted with the list of activities upon entering a specified location.<br>
Figure 4 is a sample GPS map downloaded from a Map Software that comes along with a GPS receiver.<br>
After storing the GPS co-ordinates and assigning each one of them a name the user can configure the scheduler. The following table ONLY depicts how the provisioning would appear AND might not be the actual way data gets stored in the mobile phone.<br><br><br><br>
The user can now associate the activities in the scheduler along with the location where each of them needs to be completed. . Even though the user reaches the location before time s/he can be notified with the list of activities to be completed at that location.<br>
The above-presented description is of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The manner and process of making and using it is in such a full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable to any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use this invention. New embodiments in particular, which also lie within the scope of the invention can be created, in which different details of the different examples can in a purposeful way be combined with one another.<br><br>
This invention is however, susceptible to modifications and alternate constructions from that disclosed above which are fully equivalent. Consequently, it is not the intention to limit this invention to the particular embodiment disclosed. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications and alternate constructions coming within the spirit and scope of the invention as generally expressed by the following claims which particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
