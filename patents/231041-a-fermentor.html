DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES<br>
The invention of the present invention will now be illustrated with an accompanying drawing. It is to be noted that the figures illustrates an embodiment of the present invention. The figures are not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the embodiment of the present invention. In the accompanying figures:-<br>
Fig 1:  shows the lay out of the apparatus of the present invention; Fig 2:  shows the process flow chart for preparation of bioinoculums.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION W.R.T. DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to fig.l which shows the overall apparatus of the present invention, the apparatus of the present invention, has an autoclave (2) mounted on frame (1). About 15 litre of water is kept in this autoclave at around 120°C for about half an hour. A<br><br>
fermentor (3) is mounted on the same frame (1) but at a level lower than the autoclave (2). The hotwater from this autoclave (2) is transferred to fermentor (3) via transfer valve (4) and flow meter (5). This hotwater is kept in fermentor (3) for about 3 hours for proper sterilisation of fermentaer (3) and is thereafter decanted. Growth medium separately prepared, is first subjected to sterilisation in autoclave (2) at about 120°C for about 20 minutes and is then passed into the fermentor (3). A stirrer (6) having motor (7) at its upper end, is disposed within the said fermentor (3). The medium in the fermentor (3) is cooled with a cooling system which consists of cooling tower (8) mounted on the same frame (1) (extension of frame (1) not shown in figure) but at a level higher than the level of fermentor (3). This cooling tower (8) provides cold water supply to the cooling jacket (9) provided around the fermentor (3) for cooling the medium contained in fermentor (3). The cooling tower (8) is fitted with water circulating motor (36) which circulates water through inlet (37) and outlet (38). The pH temperature and airflow are controlled with the help of pH meter (10) having a sensor, temperature controller (11) and stirrer (6) respectively. The starter culture (5% inoculum rate) and antifoaming agent are added to the media in the fermenter (3) through an inlet valve (12). The level of medium is indicated by the media level indicator (13). The mixture is allowed to render for proper incubation. The dissolved oxygen of the fermenting medium is checked intermittently with the help of dissolved oxygen meter (14).<br>
The sundried carrier material is passed through 100-200 mesh sieves and is then mixed with finely powder calcium carbonate (Ca CO3) to get requisite pH and is finally loaded in carrier containers (15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22). The carrier material is transferred into the mixing plant (23) by mechanical chain drive system (24). Before transfer into the mixing plant (23), the carrier material is mixed with distilled water at the carrier position (24). The distilled water is prepared by the distillation assembly (25) which is mounted on the<br><br>
same frame (1) (not shown in fig) but at a higher level and is fitted with heating element (43). The carrier material is mixed with distilled water from distillation assembly (25) to attain 10% moisture. The distilled water from distillation assembly (25) is also passed to water pre-heating chamber (27) through water tap (26). The pre-heated water is then passed into steam generator (28) where it is heated to generate steam. The float valve (29) and (30) regulate the inflow of water into the pre-heating chamber (27) and steam generator (28) respectively. The steam from steam generator (28) is passed through steam line (31) to the mixing plant. The carrier material is thus steam sterilised for about 90 minutes for three successive days. The cooling of the carrier material is achieved by cold water supply through water cooling line (32).<br>
The inculum from fermenter (3) is withdrawn through titre test valve (33) to check the litre value. After ascertaining the attainment of requisite titre valve, the inoculum is added to the mixing plant through flow meter (35), to the extent of l/3rd of the water holding capacity of the carrier. The blending is done by thorough mixing of inoculum and sterilised carrier in the mixing plant (23) wherein the blade assembly (42) is driven by electric three phase motor (34). After mixing the carrier material with inoculum, the mixture is kept for about 24 hours for curing. The mixture of inoculum and carrier material is then withdrawn from mixing plant (23) by mechanical outlet drive system (39), into the trolley (40) placed in UV chamber (41) where packaging is done under sterilised condition by a sealing machine. Thereafter the inoculants are incubated for about a week at the temperature which is congenial for the growth of the organisms. During this period, the bacteria are allowed to multiply so as to reach the required standard. The packets are stored in a cold storage room at temperature preferably between 4°C and 7°C from where they are distributed as required.<br><br>
It is to be noted that the apparatus of the present invention is susceptible to modifications, adaptations, changes by those skilled in the art. Such variants of the apparatus, embodying the concepts and features of the present invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
