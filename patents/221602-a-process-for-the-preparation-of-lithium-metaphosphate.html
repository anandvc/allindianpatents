				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF LITHIUM METAPHOSPHATE Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of lithium metaphosphate (LiPO3) by a solid state thermal reaction. This compound is useful as an intermediate for the preparation of lithium hexa fluorophosphates (LiPF6). This salt is a good electrolyte in aqueous, non-aqueous, solid and selected polymer medium. The present invention particularly relates to the preparation of lithium metaphosphate (LiPO3) compound which is the basic chemical for the preparation of lithium hexafluorophosphates (LiPFe) by a novel solid state method which is not hitherto attempted anywhere. Background of the invention<br>
Prior art literature on lithium metaphosphate (LiPO3) discloses the reaction of lithium<br>
salts with metaphosphoric acid, which is obtained by heating pyro-phosphoric acid or ortho-<br>
phosphoric acid. The reaction occurring for the above two thermal processes are as follows:<br>
1         H4P2O7	-»2HPO3+H2O<br>
2.        H3PO3	-»HPO3 + H2O<br>
HPO3 + LiOH -» LiPO3 + H2O Reference:<br>
Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, S. Sathiya Prakash G.D. Tuli, S.K. Basu and R.D. Radan, S. Chand &amp; Co., New Delhi, p. 988 (1998).<br>
The above methods need controlled conditions for the preparation of lithium metaphosphate. The above methods for the preparation of lithium metaphosphate also suffer from the following disadvantages:<br>
1.	More than one step is involved to prepare LiPO3.<br>
2.	Needs crystallization procedure once the product is formed from aqueous solution.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of this present invention is to provide a simple novel process for the synthesis of lithium meta phosphate (LiPO3) which obviates the draw back mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a complete solid state reaction procedure for the preparation of LiPO3.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a single step process to obtain LiPO3.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to get high yield of the product LiPO3 (&gt;90%). Summary of the invention<br>
The above and other objects have been achieved by the solid state method for the preparation of lithium metaphosphate of the invention.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of lithium metaphosphate comprising reacting a lithium source and a phosphorous source in a ratio of 1:1-2 in solid state at a temperature in the range of 300 to 650°C to obtain the desired lithium metaphosphate.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the lithium source is selected from the group consisting of Li2O, LiCO3, LiOH, LiNO3 and any mixture thereof.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the phosphorous source is selected from the group consisting of ammonium pyrophosphate, ammonium orthophosphate, diammonium hydrogen phosphate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and any mixture thereof.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the reaction is carried out in solid state in a single step.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the reaction is carried out at a temperature of 350°C for a time period of 12 hours and the lithium source is selected from Li2O, LiOH and LiNO3.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the reactive materials are heated in a muffle or in an electric furnace.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, Li2CO3 is reacted with the phosphorous source at a temperature of 600°C.<br>
In another embodiment the lithium source and the phosphorous source are mixed and ground well before being heated.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the lithium source and the phosphorous source are mixed in an equimolar ratio. Brief description of the accompanying drawing<br>
Figure 1 shows the X-ray analysis of the product obtained by the process of the present invention. Detailed description of the invention<br>
Preferably equimolar quantities of ammonium pyrophosphate/ammonium orthophosphate/ diammonium hydrogen phosphate/ammonium dihydrogen phosphate is allowed to react with Li2O/LiCO3/LiOH/LiNO3 at a temperature of 350°C in a muffle furnace for a period of 12 hours to get lithium meta phosphate (LiPO3) which was confirmed by X-ray analysis. The reaction occurring with lithium salts and ammonium salts of pyro and ortho phosphates are as follows:<br>
1.	(NH4) 4P2O7 + 2LiOH        -&gt;        2LiPO3 + 4NH3 + 3H2O<br>
2.	(NH4) 3PO4 + LiOH	-&gt;        LiPO3 + 3NH3 + 2H2O<br>
3<br><br>
3.	(NHj) 2HPO4 + LiOH         -»        LiPO3 + 2NH3 + 2H2O<br>
4.	(NH4) H2PO4 + LiOH         -»        LiPO3 + NH3 + 2H2O<br>
A novel method for the preparation of LiPOa is developed wherein equimolar quantities of LiOH/Li2CO3/Li2O/LiNO3. This mixture is ground well and then transferred into a porcelain/silica crucible. In the mixture, the lithium salt content to the phosphorous content should be in the molar ratio of 1:1. The silica crucible containing the mixture is introduced into an electric furnace. The furnace was slowly heated to 350°C and the heating was continued for 12 hours keeping the same temperature. When the reaction is over, the furnace was cooled and the product was ground well and then examined for its purity and identity.<br>
In the process of the invention for the synthesis of lithium meta phosphate lithium salt (LiOH/Li2CO3/Li2O/LiNO3) is mixed with equimolar quantities of ammonium pyrophosphate or ammonium orthophosphae or diammonium hydrogen phosphate or ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and the mixture is ground well and then transferred the mixture into a silica crucible and then the crucible containing the mixture is heated to 350°C continuously in an electric furnace to get LiPO3. The reactants are solid state materials and are heated in a muffle or in an electric furnace. Pure dry AR Li2O or LiaCOs or LiOH or LiNO3 was mixed with any one of the salts of ammonium pyrophosphate or ammonium orthophosphate or diammonium hydrogen phosphate or ammonium dihydrogen phosphate in equilmolar quantities. The Li and P content of the salt was kept in the ratio 1:1. The mixture of the lithium and the phosphate salts are ground well and then the grounded mixture was transferred into silica vessel. The vessel was then introduced into a electric furnace. The furnace was slowly heated to 350°C continuously for 12 hours and then the resultant product was powdered well and then analyzed for its purity and identity.<br>

Ammonium pyrophosphate or ammonium orthophosphate or diammonium hydrogen phosphate or ammonium dihydrogen phosphate reacts with Li salts like LiOH/LijO/LiaCOs/LiNOs such that Li salt and P salt mixture combinations are in equimolar proportion (1:1) to form LiPCb, when the temperature of heating is maintained at about 350°C for 12 hrs continuously. In the absence of Li2COs in any of the above reaction mixture with ammonium pyrophosphate or ammonium orthophosphate or diammonium hydrogen phosphate or ammonium dihydrogen phosphate the temperature is 350°C. The colour of the product is white and the particle size can be brought to any decided level. X-ray analysis confirms the LiPOs formation. The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
1.	It is a single step, thermal procedure for the preparation of LiPOs<br>
2.	It is a solid state thermal procedure.<br>
3.	Any of the lithium salts like LiOH/Li2CO3/Li2O/LiNO3 is mixed with ammonium<br>
pyrophosphate or ammonium orthophosphate or diammonium hydrogen phosphate or<br>
ammonium dihydrogen phosphate to give LiPOs.<br>
4.	This is a base material for the preparation of LiPF<br></td>
