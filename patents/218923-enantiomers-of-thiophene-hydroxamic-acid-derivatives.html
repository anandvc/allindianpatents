Transcriptional regulation is a major event in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Transcriptional activation of a set of genes determines cell destination<br><br>
and for this reason transcription is tightly regulated by a variety of factors. One of its regulatory mechanisms involved in the process is an alteration in the tertiary structure of DNA, which affects transcription by modulating the accessibility of transcription factors to their target DNA segments. Nucleosomal integrity is regulated by the acetylation status of the core histones. In a hypoacetylated state, nucleosomes are tightly compacted and thus are nonpermissive for transcription. On the other hand, nucleosomes are relaxed by acetylation of the core histones, with the result being permissiveness to transcription. The acetylation status of the histones is governed by the balance of the activities of histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Recently, HDAC inhibitors have been found to arrest growth and apoptosis in several types of cancer cells, including colon cancer, T-cell lymphoma, and erythroleukemic cells. Given that apoptosis is a crucial factor for cancer progression, HDAC inhibitors are promising reagents for cancer therapy as effective inducers of apoptosis (Koyama, Y., et al., Blood 96 (2000) 1490-1495).<br>
We have now found that certain enantiomers of thiophene hydroxamic acid derivatives show improved anti-cell-proliferation activity and HDAC inhibition activity, and surprisingly show improved physicochemical- and pharmacokinetical properties such as better solubility and improved plasma stability.<br>

Yet another embodiment of the invention is the process for the stereoselective manufacture of the (R)- and (S) enantiomers of formula I, by reacting a compound of formula III <br>
wherein R3 is a methyl group;<br>
with an enantiomerically pure (R)- or (S)-amine of the formula III-A<br>
Ar-C(R1)(R2)-NH2<br>
ni-A,<br>
wherein Ar, Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore,<br><br><br>
which is treated with hydroxylamine, or its hydrochloride, to give the respective<br>
enantiomerically pure compound of formula I; and<br>
if desired, tranforming said compound into its pharmaceutical!}" acceptable salt.<br>
The present compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salt thereof, may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compounds. Such processes, when used to prepare a thiophene hydroxamic acid derivative of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, are provided as a further feature of the invention and are illustrated by the following representative examples in which, unless otherwise stated, Ar, R-l and R2 have any of the meanings defined hereinbefore. Necessary starting materials maybe obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting examples. Alternatively necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist<br><br>
wherein Ar, Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore and R3 is a (Cl-C4)alkyl group, preferably a.methyl or ethyl group, with hydroxylamine in the presence of a suitable base. The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent or diluent such as methanol or ethanol at temperatures between 0Â°C and 100Â°C, conveniently<br><br>
at or near ambient temperature, and at a pH between 10 and 12. A suitable base is, for example, an alcoholate, for example, sodium methylate. Instead of generating hydroxylamine in situ, it can be released separately and can be applied as a solution in an organic solvent, as for example an alcohol like methanol or ethanol<br>
Compounds of formula II are prepared from compounds of the formula III wherein R3 has the meaning defined hereinbefore.<br><br>
This reaction typically involves a two-step one-pot procedure. In the first step, the carboxylate of the formula III becomes activated. This reaction is carried out in an inert solvent or diluent, for example, in dichloromethane,_ dioxane, or tetrahydrofiiran, in the presence of an activating agent. A suitable reactive derivative of an acid is, for example, an acyl halide, for example an acyl chloride formed by the reaction of the acid and an inorganic acid chloride, for example thionyl chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example an anhydride formed by the _ reaction of the acid and a chloroformate such as isobutyl chloroformate; an active ester formed by the reaction of the acid and a phenol such as pentafluorophenol; an active ester formed by the reaction of the acid and N-hydroxybenzotriazole; the corresponding carbonylimidazole to III formed by the reaction of the acid and N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole; an acyl azide formed by the reaction of the acid and an azide such as diphenylphosphoryl azide; an acyl cyanide formed by the reaction of an acid and a cyanide such as diethylphosphoryl cyanide; or the product of the reaction of the acid and a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or the product of the reaction of the acid and bis-(2-oxo-3-oxazo!idinyl)-phosphorylchloride. The reaction is carried out between -30Â°C and 60Â°C, conveniendy at or below 0Â°C. In the second step, an enantiomerically pure amine of the formula Ar-C(R1)(R2)-NH2 in which Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore is added to the solution, at the temperature used for the activation, and the temperature is slowly adjusted to ambient temperature. An appropriate scavenger base like e.g. triethylamine, or diisopropyethlyamine may be added to the reaction mixture. These methods are well known to those skilled in the art. In principle, all methods for the synthesis of amides as used in peptide chemistry as<br><br>
described in e.g. Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der organischen Chemie", Vols. XV/1 and XV/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, are also applicable.<br>
Compounds of formula III are described in the literature as for example in US 2,680,731 and J. Heterocycl. Chem. 28 (1991) 17. These monoesters are usually prepared by selective saponification of the diester or oxidation of the corresponding aldehyd, but other methods may be useful as well and are well known to those skilled in the art<br>
Enantiomerically pure amines of the formula Ar-C(R1)(R2)-NH2 in which Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore are commercially available or can be prepared by standard procedures of synthetic chemistry as described e.g. in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 64 (1942) 477; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 105 (1983j 1578; or Hanano, T., et aL&gt; Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 10 (2000) 881-884. Racemic amines of the formula Ar-C(R1)(R2)-NH2 in which Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore can be separated into their enantiomers by known procedures as, for example, enzymatic separation of racemates as described e.g. in Rasor, P., and Voss, E., Applied Catalysis A 221 (2001) 145-158, and Iglesias, L.E., et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 8 (1997)2675-2677.<br>
(b) Another preferred method for the preparation of compounds of the formula I is the deprotection of compounds of the formula IV<br><br>
wherein Y is a suitable protecting group and Ar, Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore.<br>
Compounds of the formula IV are new and included in the present invention.<br>
Suitable protecting groups may be the benzyl-, p-methoxybenzyl-, tertbutyloxyearbonyl-, trityl-, or silyl groups such as the trimethylsilyl- or dimethyl-tertbutylsilyl-group. The reactions carried out depend on the type of the<br><br>
protecting group. When the protecting group is a benzyl- or p-methoxybenzyl group, the reaction carried out is a hydrogenolysis in an inert solvent such as an alcohol like methanol or ethanol, in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as palladium on a suitable carrier such as carbon, barium sulfate, or barium carbonate, at ambient temperature and pressure. When the protecting group is the tertbutyloxycarbonyl-, trityl-, or a silyl group such .as the trimethykilyl- or dimethyl-tertbutylsilyl-group, the reaction is carried out in the presence of acids at a temperature between -20Â°C and 60Â°C, preferably between 0Â°C and ambient temperature. The acid may be a solution of hydrochloric acid in an inert solvent such as diediyl ether or dioxane, or trifluoro acetic acid in dichloromethane. When the protecting group is a silyl group such as the trimethylsilyl or dimethyl-tertbutylsilyl group, the reaction can also be carried out in the presence of a fluoride source such as sodium fluoride or tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane. Not necessarily all protecting groups Y are compatible with all groups Rl or R2. In cases where the features of these groups don't allow the usage of a certain protecting group, other protecting groups Y or other methods of preparation need to be applied.<br>
Compounds of formula IV are obtained from the reaction of compounds of formula V<br><br>
wherein Y is a suitable protecting group as described above. This reaction typically involves a two-step one-pot procedure. In the first step, the carboxylate of the formula V becomes activated. This reaction is carried out in an inert solvent or diluent, for example, in dichloromethane, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of an activating agent. A suitable reactive derivative of an acid is, for example, an acyl halide, for example an acyl chloride formed by the reaction of the<br><br>
acid and an inorganic acid chloride, for example thionyi chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example an anhydride formed by the reaction of the acid and a chloroformate such as isobutyl chloroformate; an active ester, for example an ester formed by the reaction of the acid and a phenol such as pentafluoronhenol; an active ester formed by the reaction of the acid and N-hydroxybenzotriazole; an acyl azide, for example an azide formed by the reaction of the acid and an azide such as diphenylphosphoryl azide; an acyl cyanide, for example a cyanide formed by the reaction of an acid and a cyanide such as diethylphosphoryl cyanide; or the product of the reaction of the acid and a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or the product of the reaction of the acid and bis-(2-oxo-3-oxazoIidinyl)-phosphorylchloride. The reaction is carried out between -30Â°C and 60Â°C, convenientiy at or below 0Â°C. In the second step, compound VI is added to the solution, at the temperature used for the activation, and the temperature is slowly adjusted to ambient temperature. These methods are well known to those sldlled in the art. In principle, all methods for the synthesis of amides as used in peptide chemistry as described in e.g. Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der organischen Chemie", Vols. XV/1 andXV/2 are also applicable.<br>
Compounds of the formula V are prepared from compounds of the formula II by hydrolysis. The conditions under which the hydrolysis is carried out depend on the nature of the group R3. When R3 is a methyl or ethyl group, die reaction is carried out in the presence of a base, for example, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide in an inert solvent or diluent, for example, in methanol or ethanol. When R3 is a tertbutyl group, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid, for example, a solution of hydrochloric acid in an inert solvent such as diethyl ether or dioxane, or trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane. When R3 is a benzyl group, the reaction is carried out by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as palladium or platinum on a suitable carrier, such as carbon. Not necessarily all methods of hydrolysis are compatible with all groups Rl or R2. In cases where the features of these groups do not allow the usage of a certain method of hydrolysis, other methods of preparation need to be applied.<br>
(c) Another preferred method for the preparation of compounds of the formula I is the reaction of a compound of the formula V with hydroxylamine. This reaction typically involves a two-step one-pot procedure. In the first step, the carboxylate of the formula V becomes activated. This reaction is carried out in an inert solvent or diluent, for example, in dichloromethane, dioxane, or teirahydrofiiran, in the<br><br>
presence of an activating agent. A suitable reactive derivative of an acid is, for example, an acyl halide, for example an acyl chloride formed by the reaction of the acid and an inorganic acid chloride, for example thionyl chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example an anhydride formed by the reaction of the acid and a chloroformate such as isobutyl chloroformate; an active ester, for example an ester formed by the reaction of the acid and a phenol such as pentafluorophenol; an active ester formed by the reaction of the acid and N-hydroxybenzotriazole; an acyl azide, for example an azide formed by the reaction of the acid and an azide such as diphenylphosphoryl azide; an acyl cyanide, for example a cyanide formed by the reaction of an acid and a cyanide such as diethylphosphoryl cyanide; or the product of the reaction of the acid and a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or the product of the reaction of the acid and bis-(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)-phosphorylchloride. The reaction is carried out between -30Â°C and 60Â°C&gt; conveniently at or below 0Â°C. In the second step, hydroxylamine is added to the solution, at the temperature used for the activation, and the temperature is slowly adjusted to ambient temperature. These methods are well known to those skilled in the art. In principle, all methods for the synthesis of amides as used in peptide chemistry as described in e.g. Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der organischen Chemie", Vols. XV/1 andXV/2 are also applicable.<br>
(d) Yet another preferred method for the preparation of compounds of the formula I is the synthesis of racemic compounds according to methods (a), (b), (c), or (e) applying racemic amines of the formula Ar-C(R1)(R2)-NH2 in which Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore. The racemates can be separated into both enantiomers on either the stage of the final products or the precursors of formula II. The separation can be performed by chromatography on an analytical, semipreparative or preparative scale using suitable optically active stationary phases with suitable eluents. Suitable optically active stationary phases include, but are not limited to, silica (e.g. ChiraSper,Merck; Chiralpak OT/OP, Baker), cellulose esters or carbamates (e.g. Chiracel OB/OY, Baker) or others (e.g. Crownpak, Daicel or Chixacel OJ-R, Baker). Other methods for the separation of enantiomers can also be applied, like the formation of diastereomeric compounds from compounds of the formula I together with other optically active compounds, e.g. camphorsulfonic acid or brucin, and separation of these diastereomeric compounds, followed by the .liberation from the optically active agent.<br><br>
(e) Compounds of formula I can also be prepared with methods of solid phase supported synthesis. 2,5-Thiophenedicarboxylic acid is reacted with a hydroxylamine moiety (-O-NH2) bound to a resin, e.g. a Wang resin (Wang-O-NH2 resin, supplied by EMC microcollections, Tubingen) to form a resin-bound hydroxamic acid. The second carbonic acid moiety is reacted with an amine Ar-C(R1)(R2)-NH2 by standard methods of amide bond formation as described in e.g. Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der organischen Chemie", Vols. XV'1 and XV/2. After this, the hydroxamic acid is liberated from the solid support. This can be done for example with TFA. Typically, the cleavage of the hydroxamic acids is achieved by treatment of the resin with 50% TFA in dichloromethane in the presence of triisopropyl silane at ambient temperature. The crude products can be purified by LC-MS, if necessary.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may exist in the form of their pharmaceutical]}^ acceptable salts. The term "pharmaceuticaiiy acceptable salt" refers to conventional acid-addition salts or base-addition salts that retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of formula I and are formed from suitable non-toxic organic or inorganic acids or organic or inorganic bases. Sample acid-addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid, and those derived from organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, fumaric acid, and the like. Sample base-addition salts include those derived from ammonium, potassium, sodium and, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, such as for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The chemical modification of a pharmaceutical compound (i.e., a drug) into a salt is a technique well known to pharmaceutical chemists to obtain improved physical and chemical stability, hygroscopicity, fiowability and solubility of compounds. See, e.g., Ansel, H., et al, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 6th ed., 1995, at pp. 196 and 1456-1457.<br>
An object of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions containing a pharmacologically effective amount of one or more enantiomerically pure compounds of formula I in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and/or diluents.<br><br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a medicament containing one or more enantiomerically pure compounds of the formula I as active ingredients together with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants. Such medicaments or pharmaceutical compositions may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for example as tablets, coated tablets, dragees, capsules, solutions emulsions or suspensions; for parenteral injections (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion) as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion; for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. These pharmaceutical preparations can be obtained by processing the compounds according to this invention with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acids or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oil and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
A preferred pharmaceutical preparation can be obtained by using the following procedure for a tablet formulation:<br><br>

5.	Add the Item 5 to the milled granulation Step 4 and mix for 3 minutes.<br>
6.	Compress the granulation from Step 5 on a suitable press.<br>
Compound 1 is described in Example 1.<br>
Another preferred pharmaceutical preparation is a micro-suspension of the compounds according to the invention. To obtain said micro-suspension the following materials were used:<br>
An aqueous solution of 7.5 % modified gelatine XF 20 (Braun) per injection (dissolved, filtered with a pore size of 0.45 fim and autoclaved), filters (custom made, mesh size 100 (im), filter holder, coupling, washed glass beads with a diameter of 0.25 mm and heat sterilised Retsch mills.<br>
For the preparation of a typical batch 6244 mg of compound 1, as described in example 1, were weighted into two 50 ml bottle flasks with 30 g glass beads, dispersed with a spatulum and vortexed. Then 10 ml gelatine vehicle were added to each bottle. The bottles were vortexed, capped and wrapped in aluminium foil for light protection. The contents was milled for 14 hours at 30/s in a Retsch mill. The micro-suspension was then extracted from the beads with two layers of filter (100<br><br>
(im) on a filter holder, coupled to a recipient vial by centrifugation at 400 g during two minutes and including six washing steps, to give a final volume of 130 ml.<br>
After homogenisation, the content was determined by HPLC to be 45.7 mg/ml which corresponds to a yield of 95 %. The micro-suspension was diluted with 18.6 ml to give a final concentration of 40 mg/ml. The obtained spherical, granule-like particles show diameters between 1 and 5 [im as determined by microscopy. For storage, the micro-suspension was filled into sterile vials, capped, labelled and kept at -20Â°C. Before use, the micro-suspension must be homogenised vigorously by vortex.<br>
The thiophene hydroxamic acid derivative will normally be administered to a warm-blooded animal at a unit dose within the range 5-5000 mg per square meter body area of the animal, i.e. approximately 0.1-100 mg/kg , and this normally provides a therapeutically-effective dose. A unit dose form such as a tablet or capsule will usually contain, for example 1-250 mg of active ingredient Preferably a daily dose in the range of 1-100 mg/kg is employed. However the daily dose will necessarily be varied depending upon the host treated, the particular route of administration, and the severity of the illness being treated. Accordingly the -optimum dosage may be determined by the practitioner who is treating any particular patient<br>
To show the activity of the compounds according to this invention, their effects on a human colon carninoma cell line was evaluated using a standard MTT-assay. MTT ( 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) is widely-used for the quantitative determination of cytotoxic effects or in vitro chemosen&amp;tivity of tumor cells. The assay is based on the cleavage of the yellow tetrazolium salt ( MTT ) to purple formazan crystals by metabolic active cells. For details, see Rubinstein, L.V., et aL, J. Natl. Cancer Inst 82 (1990) 1113.<br>
We proceeded as follows: HT-29 cells (human colon carcinoma cell line) were cultivated in RPMI 1640, 2.5 % FCS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin. For the assay the cells were seeded in 384 well plates, 900 cells per well, in the same medium. At the next day, the compounds (dissolved 10 mM in DMSO) were added in various concentrations ranging from 30 uM to l'.5 nM. After 5 days, the MTT assay was done mainly according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Cell proliferation kit I, MTT, from Roche Molecular Biochemicals).<br><br>
In brief: MTT labeling reagent was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, added and incubated for 4 hrs at 37 Â°C, 5% C02. During this incubation time purple formazan crystals are formed. After addition of the solubilization solution (20% SDS in 0.02 M HC1) the plates were incubated overnight at 37 Â°C, 5% C02. After careful mixing, the plates were measured in Victor 2 (scanning multiwell â€¢    spectrophotometer, Wallac) at 550 nm.<br>
A decrease in number of living cells results in a decrease in the total metabolic activity in the sample. The decrease directly correlates to the amount of purple colour resulting from the solubilization of the purple formazan crystals. Determination of IC50 was done using XL-fit.<br>
The reference compound is compound 3 of US Patent No. 5,369,108.<br><br><br><br>
To further demonstrate the activity of the compounds according to this invention as HDAC inhibitors, their effect on histone deacetylase inhibition was evaluated using the following biochemical quench assay:<br>
The function of histone deacetylase (HDAC) is the deacetylation of lysines in e.g. histone H4. A peptide of 17 amino acids derived from histone H4 was labeled with TAMRA at the C-terminus and QSY-7 at the N-terminus and was used as a substrate (TAMRA - first 17 aa of histone H4 - QSY7). Following deacetylation by HDAC, the enzyme Lys C is able to cleave the peptide after lysine. This results in a loss of the quench effect and a high fluorescence signal. Inhibition of HDAC by compounds results in low signals because Lys C could not cleave the substrate and the quench effect persists.<br>
For dose response curves, 10 concentrations were diluted 1:3 starting at 30 uM. 10 ul compound dilution were put into each well of a 384 well plate. 10 ul HDAC were added (recombinant HDAC-1 purified from HEK 293 cells; enzyme activity has to be assessed for each preparation). 10 ul peptide substrate was added (1 uM final concentration, derived from 1 mM stock solution diluted 1:1000 in test buffer). After 90 min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by addition of 20 ul test buffer including 3 ug/ml Lys C and 0.075% SDS. After overnight incubation the fluorescence signal of TAMRA was measured (Victor 2 from Wallac, absorption 544 nm, emission 590 nm). The O.D. of DMSO-treated control wells is 100 %, the % inhibition of compound treated wells is calculated in relation to 100 %. Based on 10 concentrations a IC50 curve is generated by using XL.fit3.<br><br>
Test buffer used: a mixture of 10mM Hepes pH8, 10 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 0.005 % Triton X100, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM TCEP. As plates were used 384 well plates (black, Greiner, 781077).<br><br><br><br>
Additional data to support the activity of the compounds according to the present invention were obtained, using the following in vivo testings:<br>
Determination of acetylation levels of histone H3 in tumor bearing mice<br>
The HT-29 cell line is derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma and was obtained from ATCC and kept in an in house working cell bank for pharmacological use. Cells were cultured in RPMI1640/2mM L-Glutamin medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS. For inoculation HT29 tumor cells are removed (Trypsin-EDTA, 50 U/mg) from culture flasks and transferred into culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% heat inactivated FCS), washed and resuspended in sterile PBS to achieve a final cell concentration of 5xl06/100 \A. Cell suspension was carefully mixed by regular shaking to avoid cell aggregation and filled into a 1.0 ml graded syringe. After s.c. inoculation of HT29 human colon carcinoma cells (5xl06/100fil) in the right upper quarter of ventral breast region of NMRI nude mice, animals were inspected 2-3 times per week until xenografts reached a volume of roughly 1000 mm3 or more, sufficient for analysis of histone acetylation. After single i.p. application of 400mg/kg of example 1, formulated as microsuspension in 7.5 % modified gelatin with 0.22% NaCI solution, the respective group of animals was sacrificed 3, 6, 12, and 24h after dosing. Tumors were excised for analysis of acetylated histones (H3). An aliquot of tumors (ca. 200 mg) was analyzed for acetylated H3. Histones were extracted from xenografts by standardized methods (Richon, V.M., et aL, PNAS 97 (2000) 10014-10019; Yoshida, M., et aL, J. Biol. Chem. 265 (1990) 17174^-17179), separated and acetylated H3 identified by Slot Blot and Immuno Blot techniques (SB-IB, Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany) using anti-acetyled-H3 Pabs (UpState Biotechnology, Cat. # 06-599). Histone protein was determined (Pierce Kit) and adjusted to 3 mg/ml to apply a standardized amount of l|_tg histone protein for H3 analysis in SB-IB. Quantification of acetylated H3 was performed by ECL (Enhanced Chemo Luminescence, Amersham Pharmacia, Hybondâ„¢ ECLâ„¢ Nitrocellulose membrane) measuring bioluminescence with the Lumi-Imager instrument (Roche Diagnostics). Data are expressed either as BLU/Î¼g histone protein (BLU = Bio-Luminescence-Units), or as BLU percent versus vehicle control. After single administration of example 1, there was a marked and significant increase of<br><br>
acetylated H3 lasting for up to 24h compared to the vehicle groups. The maximum acetylation was attained 6h after dosing. A tabulated summary of the mean values and percentual changes are depicted below.<br><br>
Determination of antitumor activity in a HCT116 xenograft model<br>
The HCT116 cell line (NCI line) is derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma and kept in an in house working cell bank. Cells were cultured in RPMI1640/2mM L-glutamin medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS. For inoculation HCT116 tumor cells are removed (trypsin-EDTA, 50 U/mg) from culture flasks and transferred into culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% heat inactivated FCS), washed and resuspended in sterile PBS to achieve a final cell concentration of 5xl06/100 fil. Cell suspension was carefully mixed by regular shaking to avoid cell aggregation and filled into a 1.0 ml graded syringe. Tumor cell inoculation was performed under light anesthesia (Ethrane.) in the upper ventral quarter of right flank, i.e. between axilla of forelegs and midline region of NMRI nude male mice. In this site 5xl06 HCT116 tumor cells were s.c. discharged in a volume of 100 |il PBS. All procedures were carried out under SPF conditions wearing appropriate clothings. After s.c. inoculation of tumor cells, measurable tumors developed in all animals. Mice were staged and randomized on day 10 according to the primary tumor dimensions. 21 days daily oral dosing was carried out using example 1 and compound 3 of WO 93/07148, WO 95/31977, US 5,369,108 â–  c108 patent) as test article. 75 male NMRI nude mice were divided into 5 study groups. Each group consisted of 15 male animals. The individual groups were given the test article, formulated as microsuspensions in 7.5 % modified gelatin with 0.22% NaCl solution, once daily by oral route over 29 days according to the following treatment scheme: 3 days treatment, 2 days drug holiday, 5 days treatment, 2 days drug holiday, 5 days treatment, 2 days drug holiday, 5 days treatment, 2 days drug holiday, 3 days treatment The application volume was 10 ml/kg. The oral doses chosen were 50,100, and 200 mg/kg of example 1 and 200 nig/kg of compound 3 of the '108 patent. The treatment resulted in a dose-dependent, significant tumor<br><br>
weight inhibition of 87 %, 49 %, and 40 % in the 200 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg groups, respectively. Compound 3 of the '108 patent ;200 mg/kg) showed similar results (49 % tumor weight inhibition) as the 100 mg'kg treatment group of die compound of example I.<br>
Determination .of antitumor activity in a PC-3 xenograft model<br>
PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells were originally obtained from the NCI collection and were deposited after expansion in the Roche cell bank Penzberg. Tumor cell line was routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium containing 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37Â°C in a water-saturated atmosphere at 5% CO:. Culture passage was performed with trypsin/EDTA lx (Roche Diagnostics) splitting twice a week. Cell passage 3 was used in the present study.<br>
At the day of cell injection, cells were harvested from culture flasks (Greiner T 75), transferred into 50 ml culture medium, washed once and resusoended in PBS. After an additional washing with PBS, the final cell titer was measured with a Neubauer-Chamber. The tumor cell suspension (PBS) was vortexed carefully (to reduce cell aggregation) and kept on ice. The cell suspension was filled into a 1.0 ml syringe. To generate primary tumors, 2 x 106 PC-3 tumor cells in a volume of 100Î¼lPBS were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each mouse (NMRI nude mice). After s.c. inoculation of tumor cells, measurable tumors developed in all animals. Mice were staged and randomized on day 10 according to the primary tumor dimensions. 15 days daily oral dosing was carried out using example 1 and compound 3 of the '108 patent as test article. 90 male NMRI nude mice were divided into 6 study groups. Each group consisted of 15 male animals. The individual groups were given the test article, formulated as microsuspensions in 7.5 % modified gelatin with 0.22% NaCl solution, once daily by oral route over 19 days (3 cycles of 5 days treatment and a 2-day drug free period each). The application volume was 10 ml/kg. The oral doses chosen were 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg of example 1 and 200 mg/kg of compound 3 of the '108 patent. The study was terminated on day 28 after tumor cell injection when the vehicle group reached the termination criteria. After 15 days of treatment, there was a dose-dependent, significant tumor weight inhibition of 51 % and 81 % for the 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg groups, respectively, compared to the vehicle group. Compound 3 of the '108 patent (200 mg/kg) showed similar results (53v%-tumor weight inhibition) as the 100 mg/kg treatment group of example 1. Tumor weight inhibition of the 25<br><br>
mg/kg and 50 mg/kg groups treated with example 1 were 15 % and 36 %, respectively.<br>

A suspension of 40 g (215 mmol) of methyl thiophen-2,5-dicarboxylate in thionylchloride (200 ml) is treated at reflux conditions for approx. 72 hours (end of HC1 evolution). The reaction mixture is coole-down to rt and the thionylchloride is evaporated under reduced pressure to yield the intermediate acid chloride from the starting material. A solution of (R)-l-phenylethylamine (35.5 ml, 279 mmol) and triethylamine (150 ml, 1.07 mol) in THF (320 ml) is cooled-down to -15Â°C and a cold solution (-15Â°C) of the acid chloride in THF (400 ml) is added slowly. Stirring<br><br>
is continued for 1 hour at the same temperature and after warming-up to rt for another 16 hours. The reaction mixture is filtered and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure, the resulting residue is dissolved in CH2CI2 and the product is isolated after aqueous workup and recrystallisation as white solid (mp = 131-33Â°C) in 83 % yield (52 g).<br>
b) Synthesis of (R)-Thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid 2-hydroxyamide 5-[(l-phenyl-ethyl)-amide]<br>
The intermediate methyl ester (35 g, 120 mmol) is dissolved in a solution of hydroxylamine in MeOH (605 ml, 2M) and subsequently treated with a solution of potassium hydroxide in MeOH (105 ml, 1.15 M). The solution is stirred at rt for 16 hours, treated with dry-ice and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. The solid residue is suspended in water and the pH value is adjusted to 9.

The racemic compound Thiophene-2,5-dicarboxyUc acid 2-hydroxyamide 5-[(l-thiophen-2-yl-ethyl)-amide] described in example 6 has been separated into both the (R) and (S) enantiomers by chromatographical separation using a CHIRACEL 07 CSP stationary phase, Chiral Technologies Europe, and a MeOH/water eluent to yield the enantiomerically enriched (S)-configured product (mp = 170Â°C) (determination of enantiomerical excess, purity and yield pending). Alternatively, the separation of both enantiomers can be done on the stage of 5-(l-Thiophen-2-yl-ethylcarbamoyl)-?hiOphene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester applying the same stationary phase to obtain the (S)-configured ester which is subsequently converted into the final product according to the preparation procedure of Example 5b.<br><br>

The new compounds according to this invention are inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC). Several structural classes of HDAC inhibitors have been identified and are reviewed in Marks, PA., et al., J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 92 (2000) 1210-1216. More specifically, WO 98/55449, US 5,369,108 WO 01/38322. WO 01/70675, and WO 02/22577 report alkano , alkyienâ€™, alkenylenyl, benzyl, and cinnamyl hydioxamates with HDAC inhibitory activity.<br>

Transcriptional regulation is a major event in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Transcriptional activation of a set of genes determines ceU destination<br><br>
and for this reason transcription is tightly regulated by a variety of fectors. One of its râ€™ulatory mechanisms involved in the process is an alteration in the tertiary structure of DNA, which affects transcription by modulating the accessibility of transcription fectors to their target DNA segments. Nudeosomal integrity is regulated by the acetylation status of the core histones. In a hypoacetjiated state, nudeosomes are tightly compacted and thus are nonpennissive for transcription. On the other hand, nudeosomes are rdaxed by acetjdation of the core histones, with the result being permissiveness to transcription. The acetylation status of the histones is governed by the balance of the activities of histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Recently, HDAC inhibitors have been found to arrest growth and apoptosis in severd types of cancer cdls, induding colon cancer, T-cdl lymphoma, and erythroleukemic cells. Given that apoptosis is a crudal factor for cancer progression, HDAC inhibitors are promising reagents for cancer therapy as effective inducers of apoptosis (Koyama, Y., et aL, Blood 96 (2000) 1490-1495).<br>
We have now found that certain enantiomers of diiophene hydroxamic add derivatives show improved anti-cell-proliferation activity and HDAC inhibitiory activity, and surprisinâ€™y show improved physicochemical- and pharmacoldnetical properties such as better solubility and improved plasma stability.<br>

II.<br><br>
whidi is treated with hydroxylamine, or its hydrochloride, to give the respective<br>
enantiomerically pure compound of formula I; and<br>
if desired, tranforming said compound into its phaxmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
The present compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be prepared by any process known to be apphcable to the preparation of chemically-related compovmds. Sudi processes, when used to prepare a tbiophene hydroxamic add derivative of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, are provided as a further feature of the invention and are illustrated by lie following representative examples in which, imless otherwise stated, Ar, Rl and R2 have any of the meanings defined herdnbefore. Necessary starting materials maybe obtained by standard procediires of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting examples. Altemativdy necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those lEustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist<br>
(a) One preferred method for the production of compounds of the formula I involves the reaction of compounds of the formula 11,<br>
O	'â€˜<br>

&gt;,â€™!râ€™.<br>
R3<br>
wherein Ar, Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore and R3 is a (Cl-C4)alkyl group, preferably a methyl or ethyl group, witih hydroxylamine in the presence of a suitable base. The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent or diluent such as methanol or ethanol at temperatures between Oâ€™C and 100Â°C, conveniently<br><br>
at or near ambient temperature, and at a pH between 10 and 12. A suitable base is, for ejcample, an alcoholate, for esample, sodium methyiate. Instead of generating hydroxylamine in situ, it can be released separately and can be applied as a solution in an organic solvent, as for example an alcohol like metiianol or ethanol.<br>
Compounds of formula n are prepared from compounds of the formula HI wherein R3 has the meaning defined hereinbefore.<br><br>
This reaction tj'pically involves a two-step one-pot procedure. In the first step, the carboxylate of the formula III becomes activated. This reaction is carried out in an inert solvent or diluent, for example, in dichloromethane, diosane, or tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of an activating agent A suitable reactive derivative of an add is, for example, an acyl halide, for example an acyl chloride formed by the reaction of the add and an inorganic add chloride, for example thionyl chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example an anhydride formed by the reaction of the add and a chloroformate such as isobutyi chloroformate; an active ester formed by the reaction of the add and a phenol such as pentafluorophenol; an active ester formed by -die reaction of the add and N-hydroxybenzotriazole; the corresponding carbonylimidazole to HI formed by the reaction of the add and N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole; an acyl azide formed by the reaction of the add and an azide such as diphenyiphosphorj'i azide; an acyl cyanide formed by the reaction of an add and a cyanide such as diethylphosphor)'! cyanide; or the product of the reaction of the acid and a carbodiimide such as dicydohexjicarbodiimide, or the product of the reaction of the add and bis-(2-oxo-3-oxazoHdinyi)-phosphoryichloride. The reaction is carried out between -SCC and 60Â°C, conveniently at or below 0Â°C. In the second step, an enantiomerically pure amine of the formula Ar-C(R1)(R2)-NH2 in which Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore is added to the solution, at the temperature used for the activation, and the temperature is slowly adjusted to ambient temperature. An appropriate scavenger base like e.g. triethylamine, or diisopropyethlyamine may be added to the reaction mixture. These methods are well known to those skilled in the art. In principle, all methods for the sâ€™mthesis of amides as used in peptide chemistr}' as<br><br>
described in e.g. Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der organischen Chemie", Vols. XV/1 and XV/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, are also applicable.<br>
Compounds of formula m are described in the literature as for example in US 2,680,731 and J. Heterocyd. Chem. 28 (1991) 17. These monoesters are usually prepared by sdective saponification of the diester or oxidation of the corresponding aldehyd, but other methods may be useful as well and are well known to those sldlled in ihe art<br>
Enantiomerically pure amines of the formula Ar-C(R1)(R2)-NH2 in wbidi Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore are commerdaliy available or can be prepared by standard procedures of synthetic chemistry as described e.g. in J. Am. Chem. Soc 64 (1942) 477; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 105 (1983) 1578; or Hanano, T., et aL, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett 10 (2000) 881-884. Racemic amines of the formula Ar-C(Rl)(R2)-NH2 in which Rl and R2 have tbe meaning defined hCTcinbefore can be separated into their enantiomers by known procedures as, for example, enzymatic separation of racemates as described e.g. in Rasor, P., and Voss, E., Applied Catalysis A 221 (2001) 145-158, and Iâ€™esias, Li., et al.. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 8 (1997) 2675-2677.<br>
(b) Another preferred method for the preparation of compounds of the formula I is the deprotection of compounds of the formula TV<br><br>
wherein Y is a suitable protecting group and Ar, Rl and R2 have tibe meaning defined hereinbefore.<br>
Compounds of the formula IV are new and induded in the present invention.<br>
Suitable protecting groups may be the benzyl-, p-methoxybenzyi-, tertbutyioxycarbonyl-, tritji-, or silyl groups such as the trimethjdsilyl- or dimethyl-tertbutylsiiyi-group. The reactions carried out depend on the type of the<br><br>
protecting group. When the protecting group is a ben2yl- or p-methosrybenzjd group, the reaction carried out is a hydrogenolysis in an inert solvent such as an alcohol like methanol or ethanol, in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as palladium on a suitable carrier such as carbon, barium sul&amp;te, or barium carbonate, at ambient temperature and pressure. When the protecting group is the tertbutyloxycarbonyl-, trityl-, or a silyl group such as the trimethylsilyl- or dimethyl-tertbutylsilyl-group, the reaction is carried out in the presence of adds at a temperature between -lOâ€™C and 60Â°C, preferably between C'C and ambient temperature. The add may be a solution of hydrochloric add in an inert solvent such as diethyl ether or dioxane, or trifluoro acetic add in dichloromethane. When the protecting group is a silyi group such as the trimethylsilyl or dimethyl-terLbutylsilyl group, the reaction can also be carried out in the presence of a fluoride source such as sodium fluoride or tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane. Not necessarily all protecting groups Y are compatible with all groups Rl or R2. In cases where the features of these groups don't allow the usage of a certain protecting group, other protecting groups Y or other methods of preparation need to be applied.<br>
Compounds of formula IV are obtained from the reaction of compounds of formula V<br>

with a compound of the formula VI<br>
H3N-O<br>
â€˜ (WT)<br>
wherein Y is a suitable protecting group as described above. This reaction typically involves a two-step one-pot procedure. In the first step, the carboxylate of the formula V becomes activated. This reaction is carried out in an inert solvent or diluent, for example, in dichloromethane, dioxane, or tetrahydrofiiran, in the presence of an activating agent A suitable reactive derivative of an acid is, for example, an aqd halide, for example an aqd chloride formed by the reaction of the<br><br>
add and an inorganic add diloride, for sample thionyl diloride; a mixed anhydride, for esample an anhydride formed by the reaction of the add and a chloroformate such as isobutji chloroformate; an active ester, for example an ester formed by the reaction of the add and a phenol such as pentafluorophenol; an active ester formed by the reaction of the add and N-hydroxybenzotriazole; an acyl azide, for example an azide formed by the reaction of the add and an azide such as diphenyiphosphoryl azide; an acjd cyanide, for example a cyanide formed by the reaction of an add and a cyanide sudi as diethyiphosphoryl cyanide; or the product of the reaction of tie add and a carbodiimide such as dicydohecyicarbodiimide, or the product of the reaction of the add and bis-(2-oxo-3-oxazoIidinyi)-phosphorylchloride. The reaction is carried out between -30Â°C and 60Â°C, conveniently at or bdow CC. In the second step, compound VI is added to the solution, at the temperature used for the activation, and the temperature is slowly adjusted to ambient temperature. These methods are well known to those skilled in the art In prindple, all methods for the synthesis of amides as used in peptide chemistry as described in e.g. Houben-Wejd, "Metiioden der organischen Chemie", Vols. XV/1 andXV/2 are also applicable.<br>
Compounds of the formula V are prepared from compounds of the formula II by hydrolysis. The conditions under which the hydrolysis is carried out depend on the nature of the group R3. When R3 is a methyl or ethyl group, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base, for example, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide in an inert solvent or diluent, for example, in methanol or ethanoL When R3 is a taLbutyi group, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an add, for example, a solution of hydrochloric add in an inert solvent such as diethyl ether or dioxane, or trifluoroacetic add in dichloromethane. When R3 is a benzyl group, the reaction is carried out by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as palladium or platinum on a suitable carrier, such as carbon. Not necessarily all methods of hydrolysis are compatible with all groups Rl or R2. In cases where the features of these groups do not allow the usagt of a certain method of hydrolysis, other methods of preparation need to be applied.<br>
(c) Another preferred method for the preparation of compounds of the formula I is the reaction of a compound of the formula V with hydroxyiamine. This reaction typically involves a two-step one-pot procedure. In the first step, the carboxyiate of the formula V becomes activated. This reaction is carried out in an inert solvent or diluent, for example, in dichlorometliane, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran, in the<br><br>
presence of an activating agent A suitable reactive derivative of an add is, for example, an acyi halide, for example an acyi chloride formed by the reaction of the add and an inorganic add chloride, for example thionyl chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example an anhydride formed by the reaction of the add and a chloroformate sudi as isobutyl chioroformate; an active ester, for example an ester formed by the reaction of the add and a phenol such 35 pentafluorophenol; an active ester formed by the reaction of the add and N-hydroxybenzotriazole; an acyi azide, for example an azide formed by the reaction of the add and an azide sudi as diphenylphosphoryl azide; an acyi cyanide, for example a cyanide formed by the reaction of an add and a cyanide such as diethylphosphoryl cyanide; or the product of the reaction of the add and a carbodiimide such as dicydohexylcarbodiimide, or the product of the reaction of the add and bis-(2-oxo-3-oxazoiidinyI)-phosphorylchloride. The reaction is carried out between -SOâ€™C and 60Â°C, conveniently at or bdow 0Â°C. In the second step, hydrosylamine is added to the solution, at the temperature used for the activation, and the temperature is slovdy adjusted to ambient temperature. These methods iare well known to those skilled in the art In prindple, all methods for the synthesis of amides as used in peptide chemistry as described in e.g. Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der organisdien Chemie", Vols. XV/1 andXV/2 are also applicable.<br>
(d) Yet another preferred method for the prâ€™aration of compounds of the formula I is tiie synthesis of racemic compounds according to methods (a), (b), (c), or (e) applying racemic amines of the formula Ar-C(R1)(R2)-NH2 in which Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore. The racemates can be separated into both enantiomers on either the stage of the final products or the precursors of formula U. The separation can be performed by chromatography on an analytical, semipreparative or preparative scale using suitable optically active stationary phases with suitable eluents. Suitable optically active stationary phases include, but are not limited to, silica (e.g. ChiraSperMsrck; Chiralpak OT/OP, Baker), cellulose esters or carbamates (e.g. Chiracel OB/OY, Baker) or others (e.g. CroMTipak, Daicel or Chiracel OJ-R, Baker). Other methods for the separation of enantiomers can also be applied, like the formation of diastereomeric compounds from compounds of the formula I together -with otiier optically active compounds, e.g. camphorsulfonic add or brudn, and separation of these diastereomeric compounds, followed by the liberation from the optically active â€˜ent<br><br>
(e) Compounds of formula I can also be prepared -with methods of sohd phase supported sjmthesis. 2,5-Thiophenedicarbox7lic add is reacted with a hydroxjiamine moiety (-0-NH2) bound to a resin, e.g. a Wang resin (Wang-O-NH2 resin, supplied by EMC microcoHections, Tiibingen) to form a resin-bound hydroxamic add. The second carbonic add moiety is reacted with an amine Ar-C(R1)(R2)-NH2 by standard methods of amide bond formation as described in e.g. Houben-Weyl, "Methoden der organischen Chemie", Vols. XV/1 and XV/2. After this, the hydroxamic add is liberated from the soUd support. This can be done for example with TFA, Typically, the deavage of the hydroxamic adds is adiieved by treatment of the resin with 50% TFA in dichloromethane in the presence of triisopropyl silane at ambient temperature. The crude products can be purified by LC-MS, if necessary.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention may exist in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to conventional add-addition salts or base-addition salts that retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of formula I and are formed from suitable non-toxic organic or inorganic adds or organic or inorganic bases. Sample add-addition salts indude those derived from inorganic adds such as hydrodiloric add, hydrobromic add, hydroiodic add, sulfuric add, sulfemic add, phosphoric add and nitric add, and those derived from organic adds sudi as p-toluenesulfonic add, saHcylic add, methanesulfonic add, oxaHc add, succinic add, dtric add, malic add, lactic add, fumaric add, and the like. Sample base-addition salts indude those derived from ammonium, potassium, sodium and, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, such as for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The chemical modification of a pharmaceutical compound (i.e., a drug) into a salt is a technique well known to pharmaceutical chemists to obtain improved physical and chemical stability, hygroscopicity, flowability and solubility of compounds. See, e.g., Ansd, H., eL al.. Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 6th ed., 1995, at pp. 196 and 1456-1457.<br>
An object of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions containing a pharmacologically effective amount of one or more enantiomerically pure compounds of formula I in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable exdpients and/or diluents.<br><br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a medicament containing one or more enantiomericaHy pure compounds of the formula I as active ingredients together with pharmaceuticaJly acceptable adjuvants. Such medicaments or pharmaceutical compositions may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for ejcample as tablets, coated tablets, drag6es, capsules, solutions emulsions or suspensions; for parenteral injections (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion) as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion; for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. These pharmaceutical preparations can be obtained by processing the compounds according to this invention with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers. Lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic adds or its salts and the Vke can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fiits, semi-soHd and liquid polyols and the Kke. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gdatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and sjTups are, for example, water, polyols, â€˜ycerol, vegetable oil and the lilie. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
A preferred pharmaceutical preparation can be obtained by using the following procedure for a tablet formulation:<br><br>

5.	Add the Item 5 to the milled granulation Step 4 and mix for 3 minutes.<br>
6.	Compress the granulation from Step 5 on a suitable press.<br>
Compound 1 is described in Example 1.<br>
Another preferred pharmaceutical preparation is a micro-suspension of the compounds according to the invention. To obtain said micro-suspension the following materials were used:<br>
An aqueous solution of 7.5 % modified gdatine XF 20 (Braun) per injection (dissolved, filtered with a pore size of 0.45 |im and autodaved), filters (custom made, mesh size 100 [im), filter holder, coupling, washed â€˜ass beads with a diameter of 0.25 mm and heat sterilised Retsch mills.<br>
For the preparation of a typical batch 6244 mg of compoimd 1, as described in example 1, were weighted into two 50 ml bottle flasks with 30 g glass beads, dispersed with a spatulum and vortexed. Then 10 ml gdatine vehide were added to each bottle. The botdes were vortexed, capped and wrapped in aluminium foil for hght protection. The contents was milled for 14 hours at 30/s in a Retsch mill. The micro-suspension was then extracted from tiie beads with two layers of filter (100<br><br>
pm) on a filter holder, coupled to a recipient vial by centrifiigation at 400 g during two minutes and including six washing steps, to give a final volume of 130 mL<br>
After homogenisation, the content was determined by HPLC to be 45.7 mg/ml which corresponds to a yield of 95 %. The micro-suspension was diluted with 18.6 ml to give a final concentration of 40 mg/ml. The obtained spherical, granule-like partides show diameters between 1 and 5 |Jim as determined by microscopy. For storage, the micro-suspension was filled into sterile vials, capped, labelled and kept at -20'*C. Before use, the micro-suspension must be homogenised vigorously by vortex.<br>
The fhiophene hydroxamic acid derivative will normally be administered to a warm-blooded animal at a unit dose within the range 5-5000 mg per square meter body area of the animal, i.e. approximately 0.1-100 mg/kg , and this normally provides a therapeutically-efifective dose. A unit dose form such as a tablet or capsule will usually contain, for esample 1-250 mg of active ingredient Preferably a daily dose in the range of 1-100 mg/kg is employed. However the daily dose will necessarily be varied depending upon the host treated, the particular route of administration, and the severity of the illness being treated. Accordingly the optimum dosage may be determined by the practitioner who is treating any particular patient<br>
To show the activity of the compounds according to this invention, their effects on a hiunan colon carninoma cell line was evaluated using a standard MTT-assay. IslTT (3-(4,5-dimethyithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoHum bromide) is widely used for the quantitative determination of qtotoxic effects or in vitro chemosensiti-\ity of tumor cells. The assay is based on the cleavage of the yellow tetrazolium salt ( MTT ) to purple formazan cr}â€™stals by metabohc active cells. For details, see Rubinstein, L.V., et al., J. Nafl. Cancer Inst 82 (1990) 1113.<br>
We proceeded as follows: HT-29 cells (human colon carcinoma cell Hne) were cultivated in RPMI 1640, 2.5 % FCS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin. For the assay the cells were seeded in 384 well plates, 900 cells per well, in the same medium. At the next day, the compoimds (dissolved 10 mM in DMSO) were added in various concentrations ranging firom 30 uM to 1.5 nM. After 5 days, the MTT assay was done mainly according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Cell proliferation Idt I, MTT, firom Roche Molecular Biochemicals).<br><br>
In brief: MTT labeling reagent was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, added and incubated for 4 hrs at 37 "C, 5% C02. During this incubation time purple formazan crystals are formed. After addition of the solubilization solution (20% SDS in 0.02 M HQ) the plates were incubated ovemâ€™t at 37 Â°C, 5% C02. After carefiil miring, the plates were measured in Victor 2 (scanning multiweH spectrophotometer, Wallac) at 550 nm.<br>
A decrease in niunber of living ceEs results in a decrease in the total metabolic activity in the sample. The decrease direcdy correlates to the amount of purple colour resulting from the solubilization of the purple formazan crystals. Determination of IC50 was done using XL-fiâ€™L<br>

To further demonstrate the activity of the compounds accordiiâ€™ to this invention as HDAC inhibitors, their effect on histone deacetylase inhibition was evaluated using the following biochemical quench assay:<br>
The function of histone deacetylase (HDAC) is the deacetylation of lysines in e.g. histone H4. A peptide of 17 amino acids derived from histone H4 was labeled with TAMRA at the C-terminus and QSY-7 at the N-terminus and was used as a substrate (TAMRA - first 17 aa of histone H4 - QSY7). Following deacetylation by HDAC, the enzyme Lys C is able to deave the peptide after lysine. This results in a loss of the quendi effect and a high fluorescence signal Inhibition of HDAC by compounds results in low signals because Lys C could not deave the substrate and the quench effect persists.<br>
For dose response cur\'"es, 10 concentrations were diluted 1:3 starting at 30 uM. 10 ul compound dilution were put into each well of a 384 well plate. 10 ul HDAC were added (recombinant HDAC-1 purified from HEK 293 cells; enzyme activit)' has to be assessed for each preparation). 10 ul peptide substrate was added (1 uM final concentration, derived from 1 mM stock solution diluted 1:1000 in test buffer). After 90 min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by addition of 20 ul test buffer induding 3 ug/ml Lys C and 0.075% SDS. After overnight incubation the fluorescence signal of TAMRA was measmred (Victor 2 from Wallac, absorption 544 nm, emission 590 nm). The O.D. of DMSO-treated control wells is 100 %, the % inhibition of compound treated wells is calculated in relation to 100 %. Based on 10 concentrations a IC50 cur\'e is generated by using XL.fitS.<br><br>
Test buflrer used: a mixture of lOmM Hepes pH8, 10 mM NaQ, 10% Glycerol, 0.005 % Triton XlOO, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM TCEP. As plates were used 384 well plates (black, Greiner, 781077).<br>

Determination of acetylation levek of histone H3 in tumor bearing mice<br>
The HT-29 cell line is derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma and was obtained  from  ATCC   and  kept  in   an   in  house  working   cell  bank   for pharmacological use. Cells were cultured in RPMI1640/2mM L-Glutamin medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated PCS. For inoculation HT29 tumor cells are removed (Trypsin-EDTA, 50 U/mg) from culture flasks and transferred into cultm-e medium (RPMI1640, 10% heat inactivated PCS), washed and resuspended in sterile PBS to achieve a final cell concentration of 5x10Vl 00 pi Cell suspension was carefully mixed by regular shaldng to avoid ceU aggregation and filled into a 1.0 ml graded syringe. After s.c. inoculation of HT29 human colon carcinoma cells (SxlOâ€™/lOOiil) in the right upper quarter of ventral breast region of NMRI nude mice, animals were inspected 2-3 times per week until xenografts reached a volume of roughly 1000 mmâ€™ or more, sufficient for analysis of histone acetylation. After single i.p. application of 400mgAcg of example 1, formulated as microsuspension in 7.5 % modified gelatin with 0.22% NaCI solution, the respective group of animals was sacrificed 3, 6, 12, and 24h after dosing. Tumors were excised for analysis of acetylated histones (H3). An ahquot of tumors (ca. 200 mg) was analyzed for acetyiated H3. Histones were extracted from xenografts by standardized methods (Richon, V.M., et al., PNAS 97 (2000) 10014-10019; Yoshida, M., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265 (1990) 17174-17179), separated and acetylated H3 identified by Slot Blot and Immuno Blot techniques (SB-IB, Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany) using anti-acetyIed-H3 Pabs (UpState Biotechnology, Cat. # 06-599). Histone protein was determined (Pierce Kit) and adjusted to 3 mg/ml to apply a standardized   amount  of  Ifig  histone  protein   for   H3   analysis   in   SB-IB. Quantification of acetylated H3 was performed by ECL  (Enhanced Chemo Luminescence, Amersham Pharmacia, Hybondâ„¢ ECLâ„¢ Nitrocellulose membrane) measuring    biolmninescence    with    the    Lumi-Imager    instrument    (Roche Diagnostics). Data are expressed either as BLU/|ig histone protein (BLU = Bio-Luminescence-Units), or as BLU percent versus vehicle controL After single administration of example 1, there was a marked and significant increase of<br><br>

Determination of antitumor activity in a HCT116 xenograft model<br>
The HCT116 cell line (NCI Hne) is derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma and kept in an in house working cell bank. Ceils were cultured in RPMI1640/2niM L-glutamin medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated PCS. For inoculation HCT116 tumor ceUs are removed (trypsin-EDTA, 50 U/mg) from culture flasks and transferred into culture medium (RPMI 1640, 10% heat inactivated PCS), washed and resuspended in sterile PBS to achieve a final cell concentration of 5x10â€™/100 JJL Cell suspension was carefully mixed by regular shaldng to avoid cell aggregation and filled into a I.O ml graded syringe. Tumor cdl inoculation was performed under light anesthesia (Ethrane.) in the upper ventral quarter of right flank, i.e. between axilla of fordegs and midline region of NMRI nude male mice. In this site 5x10* HCT116 tumor cells were s.c. discharged in a volume of 100 pi PBS. All procedures were carried out under SPF conditions wearing appropriate dothings. After S.C inoculation of tumor cdls, measmâ€™able tumors devdoped in all animals. Mice were staged and randomized on day 10 according to the primary tumor dimensions. 21 days daily oral dosing was carried out using example 1 and compound 3 of WO 93/07148, WO 95/31977, US 5,369,108 ('108 patent) as test artide. 75 male NMRI nude mice were divided into 5 study groups. Eadi group consisted of 15 male animals. The indiâ€™ddual groups were given the test artide, formulated as microsuspensions in 7.5 % modified gelatin with 0.22% NaCl solution, once daily by oral route over 29 days according to the following treatment scheme: 3 days treatment, 2 days drug hohday, 5 days treatment, 2 days drug hohday, 5 days treatment, 2 days drug hohday, 5 days treatment, 2 days drug holiday, 3 days treatment The application volume M'as 10 ml/1â€™. The oral doses chosen were 50,100, and 200 mg/kg of example 1 and 200 mg/kg of compoimd 3 of the '108 patent. The treatment resulted in a dose-dependent, significant tumor<br><br>
weight inhibition of 87 %, 49 %, and 40 % in the 200 mg/iâ€™, 100 mg/1â€™, and 50 mg/kg groups, respectively. Compound 3 of the '108 patent (200 mg/kg) showed similar results (49 % tumor weight itihibition) as the 100 mg/kg treatment group of the compound of example 1.<br>
Determination of antitumor activity in a PC-3 xenograft model<br>
PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells were originally obtained from the NQ collection and were deposited after expansion in the Roche cell bank Penzberg. Tiunor cell line was routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium containing 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutaroine at 37'*C in a water-saturated atmosphere at 5% COj. Culture passage was performed witii trypsin/EDTA Ix (Roche Diagnostics) splitting twice a week Cell passage 3 was used in the present study.<br>
At the day of cdtt injection, ceUs were harvested from culture flasks (Greiner T 75), transferred into 50 ml culture medium, washed once and resuspended in PBS. After an additional washing with PBS, the final cell titer was measured with a Neubauer-Chambsr. The tumor cell suspension (PBS) was vortexed carefully (to reduce cell aggregation) and kept on ice. The cell suspension was fiHed into a 1.0 ml syringe. To generate primary tumors, 2x10* PC-3 tumor cells in a volume of 100 {J PBS were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each mouse (NMRI nude mice). After s.c inoculation of tumor cdls, measurable tumors devdoped in all animals. Mice were staged and randomized on day 10 according to the primary tumor dimensions. 15 days daily oral dosing was carried out using example 1 and compoimd 3 of the '108 patent as test artide. 90 male NMRI nude mice were divided into 6 study groups. Each group consisted of 15 male animals. The iiidindual groups were given the test artide, formulated as microsuspensions in 7.5 % modified gelatin with 0.22% NaCl solution, once daily by oral route over 19 days (3 q'cles of 5 days treatment and a 2-day drug free period each). The application volume was 10 ml/kg. The oral doses chosen were 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg of example 1 and 200 mg/kg of compound 3 of the '108 patent. The study was terminated on day 28 after tumor cell injection 'when the vehicle group reached the termination criteria. After 15 days of treatment, there was a dose-dependent, significant tumor weight inhibition of 51 % and 81 % for the 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg groups, respectively, compared to the vehide group. Compound 3 of the '108 patent (200 mgfkg) showed similar results (53 % tumor weight inhibition) as the 100 mg/kg treatment group of example 1. Tumor weight inhibition of the 25<br><br>
mg/Jjg and 50 mg/kg groups treated with example 1 were 15 % and 36 %, respectivdy.<br>

The racemic compoimd Thiophene-2,5-dicarbox}'lic add 2-hydroxyaniide 5-1(1-thlophen-2-yI-ethyI)-amide] described in example 6 has been separated into both the (R) and (S) enantiomers by chromatographical separation using a CHIRACEL 07 CSP stationar)f phase, Chiral Technologies Europe, and a MeOH/water eluent to yield the enantiomerically enriched (S)-configured product (mp = 170Â°C) (determination of enantiomerical excess, purity and yield pending). Alternatively, the separation of both enantiomers can be done on the stage of 5-(l-Thiophen-2-yl-ethylcarbamoyl)-thiophene-2-carboxylic add methyl ester applying the same stationary phase to obtain the (S)-configured ester which is subsequently converted into the final product according to the preparation procedure of Example 5b.<br><br>
