				<td>COMPOUNDS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF<br>
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES<br>
Technical Field<br>
[001] The present disclosure relates to compounds, which are useful for<br>
regulating the expression of apolipoprotein A-l (ApoA-l), and their use for the<br>
treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and related disease states,<br>
including cholesterol- or lipid-related disorders, such as, for example,<br>
atherosclerosis.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
' [002] Epidemiologic data demonstrate an inverse relationship between<br>
circulating levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and the incidence<br>
of clinically significant atherosclerosis. Each 1 mg/dL increment in the HDL-C<br>
serum level is associated with a 2-3% decrement in cardiovascular risk; a 1 %<br>
reduction in LDL-C reduces coronary heart disease (CHD) risk by 2% (Gordon et<br>
al. (1997) Am. J. Med. 62, 707-714). Experimental evidence further supports the<br>
protective effect of HDL-C against cardiovascular disease. For example, in<br>
subjects with low HDL-C, administration of gemfibrozil results in a 6% increase in<br>
the HDL-C level and a corresponding 22% reduction of the CHD risk (Rubins et al.<br>
(1999) N. Engl. J. Med. 341, 410-418). Observations in genetic disorders<br>
associated with low HDL-C due to reduced ApoA-l expression, also indicate the<br>
link between elevated risk of CHD and low HDL-C.<br>
[003] HDL-C appears to exert its anti-atherogenic effect by mediating<br>
reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), in which cholesterol is recruited from<br>
peripheral tissues and transported to the liver. In addition, HDL-C also exerts anti-<br>
 <br>
inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects and promotes fibrinolysis. HDL-C particles<br>
protect against oxidation of LDL, an important initial step in promoting cholesterol<br>
uptake by arterial macrophages. HDL-C exists in two main forms, one containing<br>
both apolipoprotein A-l (ApoA-l) and apolipoprotein A-ll (ApoA-ll), and the other<br>
containing ApoA-l without ApoA-ll (Schultz et al. (1993) Nature 365, 762-764).<br>
The cardioprotective effect of HDL-C is mostly, but not exclusively, attributable to<br>
ApoA-l.<br>
[004] Clinical and experimental data suggest that the production of ApoA-l<br>
is a critical determinant of circulating HDL-C. For example, persons with familial<br>
hyperalphalipoproteinemia (elevated ApoA-l) appear to be protected from<br>
atherosclerosis, while those deficient in ApoA-l (hypoalphalipoproteinemia) show<br>
accelerated cardiovascular disease. In addition, various experimental<br>
manipulations to increase production of ApoA-l are associated with reduced<br>
atherogenicity. For example, human ApoA-l is protective in transgenic animal<br>
models (Shah et al. (1998) Circulation 97, 780-785; Rubin et al. (1991) Nature<br>
353, 265-267), and treatment with ApoA-lMilano prevents atherosclerotic lesions<br>
and leads to regression of atherosclerotic plaques in human patients (Nissen ef a/.<br>
(2003) JAMA 290, 2292-2300). Further lines of research demonstrate that ApoA-l<br>
plays a role in enhancing reverse cholesterol transport, attenuating oxidative<br>
stress, increasing paraoxonase activity, enhancing anticoagulant activity, and<br>
increasing anti-inflammatory activity (Andersson (1997) Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 8, 225-<br>
228). Accordingly, ApoA-l is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.<br>
[005] Currently available therapeutic agents that increase the plasma<br>
concentration of ApoA-l, for example, recombinant ApoA-l or peptides that mimic<br>
ApoA-l, have potential drawbacks with respect to, e.g., stability during storage,<br>
 <br>
delivery of active product, and in vivo half-life. Thus, small molecule compounds<br>
that up-regulate the production of endogenous ApoA-l, such as, for example, up-<br>
regulators of ApoA-l expression, would be very attractive as new therapeutic<br>
agents for cardiovascular disease. Such small molecule compounds have been<br>
described in WO 2006/045096.<br>
[006] The compounds of the present invention represent a major<br>
improvement over compounds disclosed in WO 2006/045096. Specifically, the<br>
compounds of the present invention are more than an order of magnitude more<br>
potent than the most active compounds described in that publication, such as 2-<br>
(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-pyrano[2,3-b]pyridin-4-one.<br>
 <br>
2-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-pyrano[2,3-b]pyridin-4-one<br>

 <br>
geometric isomers, enantiomers or diastereomers. The term "stereoisomers"<br>
when used herein consist of all geometric isomers, enantiomers or diastereomers.<br>
These compounds may be designated by the symbols "R" or "S," depending on<br>
the configuration of substituents around the stereogenic carbon atom. The<br>
present invention encompasses various stereoisomers of these compounds and<br>
mixtures thereof. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers.<br>
Mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers may be designated "(±)" in<br>
nomenclature, but the skilled artisan will recognize that a structure may denote a<br>
chiral center implicitly.<br>

be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials that<br>
contain asymmetric or stereogenic centers, or by preparation of racemic mixtures<br>
followed by resolution methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment of a mixture of<br>
enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of<br>
diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography and liberation of the<br>
optically pure product from the auxiliary, (2) salt formation employing an optically<br>
active resolving agent, or (3) direct separation of the mixture of optical<br>
enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns. Stereoisomeric mixtures can<br>
also be resolved into their component stereoisomers by well known methods,<br>
such as chiral-phase gas chromatography, chiral-phase high performance liquid<br>
chromatography, crystallizing the compound as a chiral salt complex, or<br>
crystallizing the compound in a chiral solvent. Stereoisomers can also be<br>
obtained from stereomerically-pure intermediates, reagents, and catalysts by well<br>
known asymmetric synthetic methods.<br>
 <br>
[071] Geometric isomers can also exist in the compounds of the present<br>
invention. The present invention encompasses the various geometric isomers<br>
and mixtures thereof resulting from the arrangement of substituents around a<br>
carbon-carbon double bond or arrangement of substituents around a carbocyclic<br>
ring. Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond are designated as being<br>
in the "Z' or "P' configuration wherein the terms "Z" and "E" are used in<br>
accordance with IUPAC standards. Unless otherwise specified, structures<br>
depicting double bonds encompass both the E and Z isomers.<br>
[072] Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond alternatively can<br>
be referred to as "cis" or "trans," where "cis" represents substituents on the same<br>
side df the double bond and "trans" represents substituents on opposite sides of<br>
the double bond. The arrangements of substituents around a carbocyclic ring are<br>
designated as "cis" or "trans." The term "cis" represents substituents on the same<br>
side of the plane of the ring and the term "trans" represents substituents on<br>
opposite sides of the plane of the ring. Mixtures of compounds wherein the<br>
substituents are disposed on both the same and opposite sides of plane of the<br>
ring are designated "cis/trans."<br>

Pharmaceutical Formulations and Methods of Treatment<br>
[076] The present disclosure also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising compounds as disclosed herein formulated together with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These formulations include those suitable<br>
for oral, rectal, topical, buccal and parenteral (e.g. subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intradermal, or intravenous) administration, although the most suitable form of<br>
administration in any given case will depend on the degree and severity of the<br>
condition being treated and on the nature of the particular compound being used.<br>
[077] Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented in<br>
discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a<br>
predetermined amount of the compound as powder or granules; as a solution or a<br>
suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-<br>
oil emulsion. As indicated, such formulations may be prepared by any suitable<br>
method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into association the active<br>
compound and the carrier or excipient (which may constitute one or more<br>
accessory ingredients). The carrier must be acceptable in the sense of being<br>
compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and must not be<br>
deleterious to the recipient. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, or both, and<br>
may be formulated with the compound as a unit-dose formulation, for example, a<br>
tablet, which may contain from about 0.05% to about 95% by weight of the active<br>
compound. Other pharmacologically active substances may also be present<br>
including other compounds. The formulations of the invention may be prepared by<br>
 <br>
any of the well known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of admixing<br>
the components.<br>
[078] For solid compositions, conventional nontoxic solid carriers include,<br>
for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium<br>
stearate, sodium saccharin, talc, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium<br>
carbonate, and the like. Liquid pharmacologically administrable compositions can,<br>
for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc., an active compound as<br>
described herein and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in an excipient, such as,<br>
for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to<br>
thereby form a solution or suspension. In general, suitable formulations may be<br>
prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active compound with a liquid<br>
or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
For example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or<br>
granules of the compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.<br>
Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the<br>
compound in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed<br>
with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s).<br>
Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable machine, the powdered<br>
compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
[079] Formulations suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include<br>
lozenges comprising a compound in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia<br>
or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as<br>
gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.<br>
[080] Formulations of the present invention suitable for parenteral<br>
administration comprise sterile aqueous preparations of the compounds, which<br>
 <br>
are approximately isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These<br>
preparations are administered intravenously, although administration may also be<br>
effected by means of subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal injection. Such<br>
preparations may conveniently be prepared by admixing the compound with water<br>
and rendering the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with the blood. Injectable<br>
compositions according to the invention may contain from about 0.1 to about 5%<br>
w/w of the active compound.<br>
[081] Formulations suitable for rectal administration are presented as unit-<br>
dose suppositories. These may be prepared by admixing the compound with one<br>
or more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping<br>
the resulting mixture.<br>
[082] Formulations suitable for topical application to the skin may take the<br>
form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers and<br>
excipients which may be used include Vaseline, lanoline, polyethylene glycols,<br>
alcohols, and combinations of two or more thereof. The active compound is<br>
generally present at a concentration of from about 0.1% to about 15% w/w of the<br>
composition, for example, from about 0.5 to about 2%.<br>
[083] The amount of active compound administered may be dependent on<br>
the subject being treated, the subject's weight, the manner of administration and<br>
the judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, a dosing schedule may<br>
involve the daily or semi-daily administration of the encapsulated compound at a<br>
perceived dosage of about 1 ug to about 1000 mg. In another embodiment,<br>
intermittent administration, such as on a monthly or yearly basis, of a dose of the<br>
encapsulated compound may be employed. Encapsulation facilitates access to<br>
the site of action and allows the administration of the active ingredients<br>
 <br>
simultaneously, in theory producing a synergistic effect. In accordance with<br>
standard dosing regimens, physicians will readily determine optimum dosages<br>
and will be able to readily modify administration to achieve such dosages.<br>
[084] A therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition<br>
disclosed herein can be measured by the therapeutic effectiveness of the<br>
compound. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the<br>
requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the<br>
compound being used. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount<br>
of a disclosed compound is sufficient to establish a maximal plasma<br>
concentration. Preliminary doses as, for example, determined according to animal<br>
tests,' and the scaling of dosages for human administration is performed according<br>
to art-accepted practices.<br>
[085] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard<br>
pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for<br>
determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the<br>
dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between<br>
toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as<br>
the ratio LD50/ED50. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are<br>
preferable.<br>
[086] Data obtained from the cell culture assays or animal studies can be<br>
used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. Therapeutically<br>
effective dosages achieved in one animal model may be converted for use in<br>
another animal, including humans, using conversion factors known in the art (see,<br>
e.g., Freireich et al., Cancer Chemother. Reports 50(4):219-244 (1966) and Table<br>
1 for Equivalent Surface Area Dosage Factors).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[087] The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of<br>
circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The<br>
dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed<br>
and the route of administration utilized. Generally, a therapeutically effective<br>
amount may vary with the subject's age, condition, and sex, as well as the<br>
severity of the medical condition in the subject. The dosage may be determined<br>
by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the<br>
treatment.<br>
[088] In one embodiment, a compound as disclosed herein, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof, is administered in<br>
combination with another therapeutic agent. The other therapeutic agent can<br>
provide additive or synergistic value relative to the administration of a compound<br>
of the present invention alone. The therapeutic agent can be, for example, a<br>
statin; a PPAR agonist, e.g., a thiazolidinedione or fibrate; a niacin, a RVX, FXR<br>
or LXR agonist; a bile-acid reuptake inhibitor; a cholesterol absorption inhibitor; a<br>
cholesterol synthesis inhibitor; an ion-exchange resin; an antioxidant; an inhibitor<br>
of AcylCoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT inhibitor); a tyrophostine; a<br>
sulfonylurea-based drug; a biguanide; an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, an<br>
apolipoprotein E regulator; a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, a microsomal<br>
 <br>
triglyceride transfer protein; an LDL-lowing drug; an HDL-raising drug; an HDL<br>
enhancer; a regulator of the apolipoprotein A-IV and/or apolipoprotein genes; or<br>
any cardiovascular drug.<br>
[089] In one embodiment, a method of treating or preventing<br>
cardiovascular disease, cholesterol- or lipid-related disorders, comprises<br>
administering to a mammal (e.g., a human) a therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
disclosed compound. The disclosed compound may be administered as a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable composition, comprising a disclosed compound and<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
[090] As used herein, the term "cardiovascular disease" refers to diseases<br>
and disorders of the heart and circulatory system. Exemplary cardiovascular<br>
diseases, including cholesterol- or lipid-related disorders, include, but are not<br>
limited to acute coronary syndrome, angina, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis,<br>
carotid atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular disease, cerebral infarction, congestive<br>
heart failure, congenital heart disease, coronary heart disease, coronary artery<br>
disease, coronary plaque stabilization, dyslipidemias, dyslipoproteinemias,<br>
endothelium dysfunctions, familial hypercholeasterolemia, familial combined<br>
hyperlipidemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia,<br>
hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,<br>
intermittent claudication, ischemia, ischemia reperfusion injury, ischemic heart<br>
diseases, cardiac ischemia, metabolic syndrome, multi-infarct dementia,<br>
myocardial infarction, obesity, peripheral vascular disease, reperfusion injury,<br>
restenosis, renal artery atherosclerosis, rheumatic heart disease, stroke,<br>
thrombotic disorder, transitory ischemic attacks, and lipoprotein abnormalities<br>
associated with Alzheimer's disease, obesity, diabetes mellitus, syndrome X,<br>
 <br>
impotence, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's diseases and an inflammatory<br>
diseases.<br>
[091] One embodiment provides methods for altering lipid metabolism in a<br>
patient, e.g., increasing the ratio of HDL to LDL or ApoA-l to ApoB in the blood of<br>
a patient, comprising administering to the patient a composition of the invention in<br>
an amount effective to alter lipid metabolism.<br>
[092] One embodiment provides methods for elevating the levels of ApoA-<br>
I associated molecules, such as HDL, in the blood of a mammal, comprising<br>
administering to the mammal a composition comprising a disclosed compound or<br>
composition in an amount effective to elevate levels of ApoA-l and HDL<br>
associated proteins in the mammal.<br>
[093] In one embodiment, "treatment" or "treating" refers to an amelioration<br>
of a disease or disorder, or at least one discernible symptom thereof. In another<br>
embodiment, "treatment" or "treating" refers to an amelioration of at least one<br>
measurable physical parameter, not necessarily discernible by the patient. In yet<br>
another embodiment, "treatment" or "treating" refers to inhibiting the progression<br>
of a disease or disorder, either physically, e.g., stabilization of a discernible<br>
symptom, physiologically, e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter, or both. In<br>
yet another embodiment, "treatment" or "treating" refers to delaying the onset of a<br>
disease or disorder. For example, treating a cholesterol disorder may comprise<br>
decreasing blood cholesterol levels.<br>
[094] One embodiment provides a compound for administration to a<br>
patient, such as a human, as a preventative measure against cardiovascular<br>
diseases, including cholesterol- or lipid-related disorders. As used herein,<br>
"prevention" or "preventing" refers to a reduction of the risk of acquiring a given<br>
 <br>
disease or disorder. An additional aspect provides a method for prevention of<br>
arteriosclerosis lesion development in a mammal, including the development of<br>
new arteriosclerotic lesions. In another aspect, the present invention provides a<br>
method for regressing arteriosclerosis lesions.<br>
[095] In another embodiment, the present compositions are administered<br>
as a preventative measure to a patient, such as a human having a genetic<br>
predisposition to a cardiovascular disease, including cholesterol- or lipid-related<br>
disorders, for example familial hypercholeasterolemia, familial combined<br>
hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, a dyslipidemia, a dyslipoproteinemia, or<br>
Alzheimer's disease.<br>
(096] In another embodiment, the compositions of the invention are<br>
administered as a preventative measure to a patient having a non-genetic<br>
predisposition to a cardiovascular disease, including cholesterol- or lipid-related<br>
disorders, Examples of such non-genetic predispositions include, but are not<br>
limited to, cardiac bypass surgery and percutaneous transluminal coronary<br>
angioplasty, which often leads to restenosis, an accelerated form of<br>
atherosclerosis; diabetes in women, which often leads to polycystic ovarian<br>
disease; and cardiovascular disease, which often leads to impotence.<br>
[097] Angioplasty and open heart surgery, such as coronary bypass<br>
surgery, may be required to treat cardiovascular diseases, such as<br>
atherosclerosis. These surgical procedures entail using invasive surgical devices<br>
and/or implants, and are associated with a high risk of restenosis and thrombosis.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds of the invention may be used as coatings on surgical<br>
devices (e.g., catheters) and implants (e.g., stents) to reduce the risk of restenosis<br>
 <br>
and thrombosis associated with invasive procedures used in the treatment of<br>
cardiovascular diseases.<br>
[098] . In another embodiment, the present compositions may be used for<br>
the prevention of one disease or disorder and concurrently treating another (e.g.,<br>
prevention of polycystic ovarian disease while treating diabetes; prevention of<br>
impotence while treating a cardiovascular disease).<br>
[099] Diseases and conditions associated with "diabetes mellitus" as<br>
defined herein refer to chronic metabolic disorder(s) caused by absolute or<br>
relative insulin deficiency including, but not limited to hyperglycemia,<br>
hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, impaired glucose<br>
metabolism, obesity, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, cataracts,<br>
diabetic nephropathy, glomerulosclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, erectile<br>
dysfunction, premenstrual syndrome, vascular restenosis, ulcerative colitis, skin<br>
and connective tissue disorders, foot ulcerations, metabolic acidosis, arthritis,<br>
osteoporosis and impaired glucose tolerance.<br>

[0106] To a solution of 3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy benzonitrile (1.0 g,<br>
6.79 mmol) in DMF (100 mL), were added a NaH (1.065 g, 26.63 mmol) and (2-<br>
bromoethoxy)-tert-butyl dimethyl silane (1.95 g, 8.15 mmol). The reaction mixture<br>
was stirred for 10 d at room temperature under nitrogen The reaction mixture was<br>
poured into ice-water and the products were extracted with ethyl acetate. The<br>
organic layer was separated, washed with water, dried and concentrated to give<br>
crude product, which was purified by column chromatography to give 1.9 g of the<br>
B-ring building block in 92% yield.<br>
[0107] n-Butyl lithium (2.84 mL, 7.1 mmol, 2.5 M solution in hexane) was<br>
added slowly to a solution of 2,4-dimethoxy-6-methyl benzamide (650 mg,<br>
3.1 mmol) in THF (30 mL), under nitrogen with cooling (ice-salt bath), maintaining<br>
the temperature below 20°C. After completion of addition, the mixture was stirred<br>
for 1 h at 0°C, and then cooled to -50°C and a solution of 4-(2-tert-butyldimethyl<br>
silanyloxy) ethoxy)-3,5-dimethyl benzonitrile (the B-ring building block, above)<br>

 <br>
removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and<br>
was stirred for 16 h at room temperature. A saturated NH4CI solution was added<br>
with cooling, and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with<br>
water, brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to give 1.2 g of crude product.<br>
[0108] The above crude product (1.2 g) was treated with ethanol (10 mL)<br>
and cone. HCI (2 mL) at 80°C for 1 h. The solvent was removed and the residue<br>
was dissolved in methanol and neutralized by NaHCO3. The solvent was<br>
evaporated and crude product was purified by column chromatography to give 3-<br>

 <br>
3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-7-(morpholinomethyl)isoauinolin-1(2H)-one<br>
[0109] Hydrogen bromide in acetic acid (13 mL, 33 wt%) was added to a<br>
mixture of 2-methyl benzoic acid (4.08 g, 30 mmol), paraformaldehyde (2.50 g,<br>
83.0 mmol), and o-phosphoric acid (7 mL, 85%). The reaction mixture was stirred<br>
at 115°C for 15 h. It was cooled to room temperature and poured into ice-cold<br>
water. A white precipitate was formed. The mixture was extracted with ethyl<br>
acetate (300 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (100 mL), brine<br>
(100 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Removal of solvent gave 6.84 g of a<br>
white solid, which was used in the next step without further purification. The above<br>
compound (6.8 g) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (150 mL). Oxalyl<br>
 <br>

of anhydrous DMF were added. A vigorous reaction occurred and the stirring was<br>
continued overnight. Solvent and excess oxalylchloride were removed under<br>
reduced pressure and the residue was dried under vacuum to give 7.02 g of<br>
brown liquid, which was used in the next step without further purification. The<br>
above compound (7.02 g, 28.36 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (60 mL)<br>
and cooled to 0°C. A solution of N-methylamine (2.0 M in THF, 19 mL,<br>
38.03 mmol) was added drop-wise under nitrogen. The stirring was continued for<br>
15 min at 0°C. The ice-bath was removed, and the stirring was continued at room<br>
temperature for 3 h. A white precipitate was formed. Water (100 mL) was added<br>

separated, washed with water (50 mL), saturated NaHCO3 solution (2x50 mL),<br>
water (50 mL), and brine (50 mL), and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Removal of<br>
solvent gave 5.64 g of 5-bromomethyl-2,N-dimethylbenzamide as a white solid<br>
which was used in the next step without further purification. To a solution of the<br>
above compound (2.42 g, 10 mmol) in anhydrous THF was added morpholine<br>
(1.92 g, 22 mmol) at room temperature under nitrogen. A white precipitate was<br>
formed. Stirring continued overnight. Water (100 mL) was added and the mixture<br>
was extracted with ethyl acetate (150 mL). The organic layer was separated,<br>
washed with water (50 mL) and brine (50 mL) and dried (Na2SO4). Removal of<br>

(silica gel 230-400 mesh; 0-5% methanol in CH2CI2 as eluent) to give the desired<br>
benzamide intermediate (yield 0.50 g, 20%). N-Butyl lithium (1.6 M solution in<br>
hexanes, 4.1 mL, 6.6 mmol) was added drop-wise to a solution of the benzamide<br>
(0.5 g, 2.0 mmol) in anhydrous THF (4 mL) at -10°C over a period of 10 min under<br>
 <br>
nitrogen. Stirring was continued at 0°C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to<br>
-50°C. A solution of 4-(tert-butyldimethylsilanyloxy)-3,5-dimethylbenzonitrile<br>
(0.653 g, 2.5 mmol) in anhydrous THF (3 mL) was quickly added. The cooling<br>
bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature. Stirring was continued at room temperature for 1 h. An aqueous<br>
ammonium chloride solution (5 mL) was added followed by ethyl acetate (50 mL).<br>
The organic layer was separated, washed with water (5 mL) and dried (Na2SO4).<br>
Removal of the solvent gave 1.23 g pale yellow gummy material, which was used<br>
in next step without further purification. The above compound (1.2 g) was<br>
dissolved in 10 mL anhydrous ethanol. Cone. HCI (1 mL) was added and the<br>
mixture was refluxed for 15 min, then cooled to room temperature. The solvent<br>
was removed under reduced pressure. The crude compound was basified with<br>
methanolic ammonia and purified by column chromatography (silica gel 230-400<br>
mesh; 0-5% methanol in CH2CI2 as eluent) to give 3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-<br>
dimethylphenyl)-7-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-2H-isoquinolin-1-one (35 mg) as a white<br>
solid (the free base). To a solution of the above compound (35 mg) in CH2CI2<br>
(5 mL) and MeOH (1 mL) was added drop-wise hydrogen chloride in ether<br>
(0.5 mL, 1.0 M) under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 1 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and dried<br>
under vacuum to give the hydrochloride of 3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-7-<br>
(morpholinomethyl)isoquinolin-1(2H)-one (36 mg, 93%) as a yellow solid. Selected<br>

 <br>
 <br>
2-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylDhenyl)-5.7-dimethoxyquinazolin-4(3H)-one<br>
[0110] A solution of 3,5-dimethoxyaniline (199 g, 1.30 mol) in ether (5.0 L)<br>
in a 5 L 3-necked flask was cooled to 0°C. HCI gas (227 g) was bubbled through<br>
the solution over 45 min. After 45 min at 10°C, the mixture was filtered, washed<br>
with isopropylacetate (4 L), and dried overnight on high vacuum at 45°C to give<br>
the hydrochloride (242.3 g, 98%), as a white solid. A mixture of the hydrochloride<br>
above (20 g, 0.105 mol) and oxalyl chloride (33 mL) in a 3-necked flask equipped<br>
with a reflux condenser was heated for 2 h with stirring (170°C external<br>
temperature), and the oxalyl chloride was distilled from the reaction mixture. The<br>
flask was cooled to 0°C and methanol (40 mL) was added. The reaction mixture<br>
was heated to reflux for 45 min, filtered while hot, and washed with methanol<br>
(80 mL) to give the 4,6-dimethoxyisatin (17.2 g, 79%) as a yellow-green solid. To<br>
a heated solution (external temp 70°C) of the isatin (162 g, 0.78 mol) in<br>
aqueous NaOH (40%, 1.5 L) was added H2O2 (35%, 405 mL) slowly over 2 h.<br>
After the addition of each portion of H2O2, the internal reaction temperature<br>
(initially 64°C) increased (to a maximum temp of 80°C). After the addition was<br>
complete, the foaming reaction mixture was then stirred for an additional 2 h at<br>
70°C, and the mixture was allowed to stir overnight while cooling to RT. The<br>
mixture was heated to 70°C. Additional H2O2 (75 mL) was added, and the mixture<br>
was stirred at 70°C for a further 2 h until the reaction was complete. After cooling<br>
to 10°C (bath temperature), aqueous Na2S2O3 (150 mL, saturated) was added.<br>
 <br>
The mixture was brought to pH 8 with HCI (37%, 1.6 L) and pH 6 with acetic acid<br>
(glacial, 75 mL), without allowing the reaction mixture to warm to greater than<br>
40°C. Filtration of the reaction mixture and washing with water (4 L) gave the<br>
expected amino acid as a tan solid (83.7 g, 55%). To a solution of the amino acid<br>
(82.7 g, 0.42 mol) in anhydrous THF (4.2 L) was added EDCI (89.2 g, 0.48 mol),<br>
HOBT (65 g, 0.48 mol), and NMM (51.3 mL), and the mixture was allowed to stir<br>
at RT for 3 h. Aqueous NH3 (83 mL, 50%) was added, and the mixture was stirred<br>
at RT for 16 h. Water (1.25 L) was added, and the mixture was extracted with<br>
DCM (2x250 mL). The combined extracts were then washed with water<br>
(2x500 mL). Concentration, formation of a slurry with ether (550 mL), filtration,<br>
and drying under high vacuum gave 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxybenzamide (46.7 g,<br>
57%) as a brown solid.<br>
[0111]2-Amino-4,6-dimethoxy-benzamide (1.06 g, 5.4 mmol), 3,5-dimethyl-<br>
4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (0.810 g, 5.4 mmol), K2CO3 (0.747 g, 5.4 mmol) and l2<br>
(1.645 g, 6.5 mmol) were mixed in DMF (20 mL) and the reaction mixture was<br>
heated at 80°C for 12 h. It was cooled to RT and poured into crushed ice. The<br>
solid was collected and purified by column chromatography to give 2-(4-hydroxy-<br>
3,5-dimethylphenyl)-5,7-dimethoxyquinazolin-4(3H)-one (0.9 g, 51%) as a white<br>
solid. Selected data: MP 291-293°C.<br>
 <br>
3-(4-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropoxy)-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-<br>
6,8-dimethoxyisoquinolin-1(2H)-one<br>
 <br>
[0112] To a solution of 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzonitrile (2.00 g,<br>
13.5 mmol) and 1-chloro-2-methyl propan-2-ol (8.85 g, 81.5 mmol) in ethanol<br>
(50 mL) was added potassium carbonate (7.5 g, 54 mmol) and water (5 mL). The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 24 h and cooled to RT. The precipitated<br>
solid was filtered off and washed with water. The solid was dissolved in ethyl<br>
acetate (100 mL), washed with water (50 mL), brine (50 mL), and dried over<br>
anhydrous Na2SO4. Removal of solvent gave 4-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropoxy)-3,5-<br>
dimethyl benzonitrile (2.9 g, 97%) as a white solid.<br>
[0113] To a solution of 4-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropoxy)-3,5-dimethyl<br>

6,8-dimethoxy-3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-2H-1,2-benzothiazine-1,1 -dioxide<br>
[0152] To a 3-necked, round-bottomed flask was added 3,5-<br>
dimethoxytoluene (6.088 g, 40 mmol) and cyclohexane (28 mL) under nitrogen.<br>
Dimethyl carbonate (30.3 g, 336 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was<br>
heated at 60°C. Excess chlorosulfonic acid was added over a period of 15 min.<br>
The liberated HCI gas was removed by inserting a tube into solid sodium<br>
hydroxide. On completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was heated to<br>
70-72°C for 1 h and then cooled to room temperature. The solid was filtered off<br>
and washed with dimethyl carbonate/cyclohexane (1:1, 20 mL). The solid was<br>
dried in vacuo to obtain pure material (6.13 g, 66%). To a mixture of the sulfonic<br>
acid (product from above, 4.65 g, 20 mmol) and triethyl amine (2.03 g, 2.79 mL) in<br>
acetone (40 mL) was added 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (cyanuric chloride,<br>
3.69 g; 20 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 20 h before<br>
being cooled to room temperature. The solution was passed through a Celite pad<br>
and evaporated in vacuo to leave a solid, which was filtered off and washed with<br>
hexane. The mixture of product and salt of cyanuric hydroxide and triethyl amine<br>
(7.58 g) was used for the next step without further purification.<br>
[0153] To a 3-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a condenser<br>
(acetone-dry ice cooling), was added the mixture from the step above (7.58 g) and<br>
acetone (100 mL). The reaction mixture was cooled to -78°C and ammonia gas<br>
 <br>
was bubbled through the solution for 0.5 h. The reaction mixture was kept<br>
standing overnight, allowing slow evaporation of ammonia gas, followed by the<br>
evaporation of solvent. Water was added and the product was extracted with<br>
DCM. The solvent was dried and evaporated to leave a mixture of solid and a<br>
dense liquid. The solid was filtered off and washed with hexane to leave pure<br>
sulfonamide (3.23 g, 70%).<br>
[0154] To a round-bottomed flask was added 3,5-dimethyl-4-<br>
hydroxybenzoic acid (2.99 g, 18 mmol). Anhydrous DMF (20 mL) was added,<br>
followed by sodium hydride (1.8 g, 45 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at<br>
room temperature for 1 h. p-Methoxybenzyl chloride (6.20 g, 39.6 mmol) was<br>
added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight (-20 h). The<br>
reaction mixture was poured into water, acidified with 1 N HCI and stirred for 1 h.<br>
The precipitated solid was filtered off, washed with water and hexane to obtain<br>
pure B-ring building block (6.93 g, 95%).<br>
[0155] The B-ring building block (6.93 g, 17.1 mmol) was dissolved in a<br>
mixture of methanol (50 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (50 mL). Potassium hydroxide<br>
(1.25 g, 22.2 mmol) in water (20 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was<br>
refluxed at 70°C for 24 h. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo. Water was added<br>
and the reaction mixture was acidified with 1 N HCI (pH 4-5). The solid was<br>
filtered off, washed with water and hexane. The yield was 4.61 g (94%). The<br>
product (1.932 g, 6.75 mmol) and the sulfonamide from above (1.04 g, 4.5 mmol)<br>
were taken in a 3-necked, round-bottomed flask under nitrogen. Dichloromethane<br>
(100 mL) was added with stirring. To this stirred mixture was added N-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI. HCI, 1.36 g,<br>
7.09 mmol), followed by N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (2.06 g, 16.9 mmol). The<br>
 <br>
reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h before being washed<br>
with 1 N HCI, 2.5% NaOH and saturated sodium bicarbonate solutions. The<br>
organic layers were dried and evaporated in vacuo to leave a residue, which was<br>
purified by silica gel (100 g) column chromatography, employing 20-50% ethyl<br>
acetate in hexane and 5% methanol in dichloromethane as eluents. Fractions<br>
30-66 were combined to obtain pure materials (1.35 g, 60%). The compound from<br>
the step above (0.105 g, 0.21 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran under<br>
nitrogen and cooled to -78°C. n-Butyllithium was added and the reaction mixture<br>
was allowed to warm to room temperature slowly and stirred overnight (-14 h).<br>
TLC showed incomplete conversion. The reaction mixture was quenched with<br>
saturated ammonium chloride solution and extracted with ethyl acetate. The<br>
solvent was evaporated in vacuo to leave a residue that was purified by silica gel<br>
(15 g) column chromatography, employing 20-50% ethyl acetate in hexane as<br>
eluents. The product was not pure enough, so another column was used,<br>
employing 0.5% methanol in hexane as eluent, and finally preparative TLC was<br>
employed to purify the material. The compound from the step above (0.277 g) was<br>
dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (10 mL) under nitrogen and the reaction mixture<br>
was refluxed (bath temperature 80°C) for 4 d. The solvent was evaporated in<br>
vacuo and the residue was dissolved in 0.25 N NaOH (20 mL), and acidified with<br>
acetic acid. The solid had precipitated out at this point. The solid was filtered off<br>
and washed with water, hexane and dried. From one batch, 0.005 g of pure<br>
material was isolated. From another batch, 0.060 g compound was isolated, which<br>
was not pure enough. This compound was further purified by preparative HPLC<br>
to give pure 6,8-dimethoxy-3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-2H-1,2-<br>
benzothiazine-1,1-dioxide (0.010 g). Selected data: MP 246.6-247.4°C.<br>

 <br>
3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-6,8-dimethoxy-7-<br>
(morpholinomethyl)isoquinolin-1(2H)-one<br>
[0156] Methyl acetoacetate (69.67 g, 0.6 mol) in dry THF (350 mL) was<br>
cooled to -5°C and sodium hydride in mineral oil (24.5 g, 60%) was added at -5 to<br>
0°C over 30 min. Diketene (50.4 g) in dry THF (80 mL) was added drop-wise at<br>
5°C over 20 min. The resulting solution was allowed to stir for 1.0 h at -5°C, after<br>
which it was allowed to warm to room temperature and stir overnight. Acetic acid<br>
(35 mL) was added and the THF solvent was removed. Water (200 mL) and ethyl<br>
acetate (300 mL) were added to the residue and the pH was adjusted to 5.0 by<br>
addition of HCI solution. The organic layer was separated and washed with brine<br>
and dried over sodium sulfate. After column purification and recrystalization,<br>
compound A (26.6 g, 24.3%) was obtained.<br>
[0157] Sodium hydride in mineral oil (11.2 g, 0.279 mol, 60%) was added<br>
to compound A (24.8 g, 0.136 mol) in DMF (150 mL). The reaction was cooled to<br>
-30°C and methyl iodide (21.3 mL, 0.341 mol) was added and the reaction was<br>
kept at room temperature overnight. Sodium iodide was filtered off and DMF was<br>
removed. The residue was mixed with water (100 mL) and extracted with ethyl<br>
acetate. The organic layer was washed with brine and dried over sodium sulfate.<br>
The crude mixture was purified by column chromatography to yield compound B<br>
(11.40 g, 39.9%). To a solution of compound B (11.4 g, 0.054 mole) in dry CCl4<br>
 <br>
(90 mL) was added N-bromosuccinimide (10.6 g, 0.0596 mol). The mixture was<br>
refluxed overnight and CCI4 solvent was removed. Water (100 mL) was added to<br>
the residue. After stirring for a while the solid was filtered off and washed with<br>
water, ethyl acetate (10 mL) and hexane (30 mL) to yield compound (13.1 g,<br>
83.9%). Compound C (12.5 g, 0.043 mol), chloromethyl methyl ether (81.0 g) and<br>
anhydrous zinc chloride (7.0 g, 0.051 mol) were kept at room temperature<br>
overnight. Chloromethyl methyl ether was removed and the residue was mixed<br>
with water and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 using sodium bicarbonate. The mixture<br>
was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with brine and<br>
dried over sodium sulfate. Compound D (7.39 g, 50.6%) was obtained after<br>
column chromatography. A solution of compound D (7.39 g, 0.022 mol),<br>
morpholine (7.62 g, 0.088 mol) and anhydrous THF (20 mL) was kept at room<br>
temperature overnight. The solvent was evaporated. Water and ethyl acetate<br>
were added to the residue, and pH was adjusted to 9.0 with sodium bicarbonate.<br>
The organic layer was washed with brine and dried over sodium sulfate, and<br>
concentrated. Compound E (5.4 g, 63.8%) was obtained after column<br>
chromatography. The hydrogenation reaction was carried out at 50 psi with<br>
compound E (5.4 g, 0.014 mol) in THF (100 mL) and triethyl amine (3.9 mL) with<br>
10% Pd/C (2.6 g) as a catalyst for 2 d. After the catalyst was filtered off, the<br>
organic layer was purified by column chromatography to yield product F (3.20 g,<br>
74.4%). Compound F (3.20 g, 0.0103 mol) was dissolved in ethanol (30 mL) and<br>
potassium hydroxide (2.31 g, 0.041 mol) in water (20 mL) was added and the<br>
reaction mixture was heated to 100°C overnight. The solvent was removed, pH<br>
was adjusted to 6.0 and the water was removed. The residue was further dried<br>
under high vacuum and the compound was extracted with ethanol to yield<br>
 <br>
compound G (2.95 g, 99%). Compound G (1.80 g, 6.1 mmol) with thionyl chloride<br>
(3 mL, 0.0411 mol) was refluxed for 1 h before the excess thionyl chloride was<br>
removed and the residue was dried under high vacuum. Anhydrous THF (20 mL)<br>
was added and ammonia gas was bubbled into the reaction mixture for 2 h. THF<br>
was removed and pH was adjusted to 8.0-9.0. The mixture was extracted with<br>
dichloromethane and dried over sodium sulfate to give compound H (1.30 g,<br>
72.4%).<br>
[0158] NaH in mineral oil (1.14 g, 0.0285 mol, 60%) was added to 4-<br>
hydroxy-3,5-dimethylbenzonitrile (4.0 g, 0.027 mol) in anhydrous DMF (20 mL)<br>
followed by benzyl bromide (3.27 mL, 0.027 mol). The reaction was kept at room<br>
temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was poured into water and the solid<br>
was filtered off and washed with hexane to yield Compound I (5.7 g, 89%).<br>
Compound I was used for the next step reaction without further purification. BuLi<br>
(1.60 M, 10.2 mL) was added drop-wise to compound H (0.8 g, 2.72 mmol) in<br>
anhydrous THF (25 mL) at -10°C. The reaction mixture was kept at 0°C for one h<br>
before the cooling bath was removed. The reaction mixture was stirred for 45<br>
minutes. Compound I (0.65 g, 2.72 mmol) in anhydrous THF (5 mL) was added<br>
drop-wise at -10°C and the reaction was continued for a further 45 min. Water<br>
(20 mL) was added. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The solvent<br>
was removed and the residue was purified by column chromatography to yield<br>
compound J (0.180 g, 12.8%). Compound J (180 mg) in methanol (80 mL) was<br>
hydrogenated at 50 psi for 3 h, using 10% Pd/C as the catalyst. The catalyst and<br>
solvent were removed and the residue was purified by column chromatography to<br>
yield 3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-6,8-dimethoxy-7-<br>
 <br>
(morpho,inomethyl)isoquinolin-1(2H)-one (28 mg, 18.8%) as a white solid.<br>
Selected data: MS (m/z): 424.21; MP 158-161°C.<br>
Example 38: Quantification of ApoA-l mRNA<br>
[0159] In this example, ApoA-l mRNA in tissue culture cells was quantitated<br>
to measure the transcriptional up-regulation of ApoA-l when treated with a<br>
compound of the invention.<br>
[0160] HepG2 cells (~2x1o5 per well) were placed in a 24-well plate in<br>
~400 µL MEM, supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS, 24 h before addition of the<br>
compound of interest. At time of harvesting, the spent media was removed from<br>
the HepG2 cells and immediately placed on ice (for immediate use) or at -80°C<br>
(for future use) in ApoA-l and albumin ELISAs. The cells remaining in the plate<br>
wells were rinsed in 200 µL PBS. PBS was carefully removed to avoid removing<br>
any loosely attached cells.<br>
[0161] Once the PBS was removed, 85 µL cell lysis solution was added the<br>
cells in each well and incubated for 5-10 min at room temperature, to allow for<br>
complete cell lysis and detachment. mRNA was then prepared using the "mRNA<br>
Catcher PLUS plate" from Invitrogen, according to the protocol supplied. After the<br>
last wash, as much wash buffer as possible was aspirated without allowing the<br>
wells to dry. Elution Buffer (E3, 80 µL) was then added to each well. mRNA was<br>
then eluted by incubating the mRNA Catcher PLUS plate with Elution Buffer for<br>
5 min at 68°C and then immediately placing the plate on ice.<br>
[0162] The eluted mRNA isolated was then used in a one-step real-time<br>
room temperature-PCR reaction, using components of the Ultra Sense Kit<br>
together with Applied Biosystems primer-probe mixes. Real-time PCR data was<br>
analyzed, using the Ct values, to determine the fold induction of each unknown<br>
 <br>
sample, relative to the control (that is, relative to the control for each independent<br>
DMSO concentration).<br>
[0163] An active compound is one that causes a &gt;15% increase in ApoA-l<br>
mRNA at a concentration less than or equal to 100 µM.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Example 39: ApoA-l mRNA and protein induction<br>
[0164] In this example, ApoA-l mRNA and secreted protein from tissue<br>
culture cells were quantitated. The assay can be used to determine the potency<br>
for compounds of interest, including those of the present invention.<br>
[0165] HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes (BD Gentest, lot 107)<br>
(~2*105 per well) were placed in a 24-well plate in ~400 µL MEM, supplemented<br>
with 0.5% (v/v) FBS, 24 h before addition of the compound of interest. The<br>
compounds of interest were dissolved in DMSO at 0.05% (v/v). Appropriate<br>
volumes of the stock solutions of the compounds in DMSO were then added to<br>
appropriate volumes of MEM, supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS, to achieve the<br>
desired concentration (for example, 1 µL of a compound stock into 1 mL of MEM,<br>
supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS).<br>
[0166] Just prior to compound addition to the cells, the growth media was<br>
aspirated and replaced with 300 µL of fresh MEM, supplemented with 0.5% (v/v)<br>
FBS, followed by addition of 300 µL of the compound of interest in MEM,<br>
 <br>
supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS to achieve the desired fina, compound<br>
concentration in a total volume of 600 µL The final concentration of diluent<br>
(DMSO) was 0.05% (v/v).<br>
[0167] Cells were incubated for the desired time. The cell media was then<br>
harvested, as were the cells. ApoA-l mRNA was measured as described in<br>
Example 39. Secreted ApoA-l was measured using an ApoA-l ELISA, as<br>
described below:<br>
ApoA-l ELISA<br>
[0168] In this example, the ApoA-l secreted into the media from tissue<br>
culture cells was quantitated to assess induction of endogenous ApoA-l protein<br>
secretion from cells treated with various small molecule compounds, such as<br>
<br>
those of the present invention.<br>
[0169] At time of harvesting, spent media from the HepG2 cell cultures or<br>
primary cell culture was removed and stored at -80°C in 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.<br>
[0170] For the human ApoA-l ELISA, an ELISA plate was coated with<br>
~100 µL/well human ApoA-l capture antibody diluted to -2 µg/mL in coating buffer<br>
for ~1 h at room temperature. The plate was then washed three times in wash<br>
buffer. The plate was then blocked with -200 µL/well human ApoA-l blocking<br>
buffer for at least ~30 min at room temperature.<br>
[0171] Samples for use in generating a standard curve were prepared<br>
from spent media (MEM, supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS) from HepG2 or<br>
primary cells treated with DMSO for 48 h. Serial 2 fold dilutions of the media were<br>
prepared in MEM, supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS. The unknown samples,<br>
from the cultures treated with the compounds of interest, were also diluted in<br>
 <br>
MEM, supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS. The plate was washed three times in<br>
wash buffer. The standard curve and unknown samples (100 µL/well), in<br>
triplicate, were added to the plate and it was incubated for 1.5 h at room<br>
temperature.<br>
[0172] The plate was washed three times in wash buffer. Human ApoA-l<br>
detection antibody, diluted 1:1000 in PBS, was added (100 µL/well) and the plate<br>
was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed three times in<br>
wash buffer.<br>
[0173] Goat anti-rabbit IgG H &amp; L chain specific peroxidase conjugate,<br>
diluted 1:2000 in PBS, was added (100 µL/well) and the plate was incubated for<br>
40 min at room temperature in the dark. The plate was washed six times in wash<br>
buffer.<br>
[0174] TMB liquid substrate was added (100 µL/well) and the plate was<br>
incubated on a shaker underneath tin foil during development. Once a sufficient<br>
"blue" color had been achieved, stop solution (50 µL/well, 1 M H2SO4) was added<br>
and mixed thoroughly on the plate shaker. Air bubbles were removed and the<br>
absorbance at 450 nm was determined, using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax<br>
190 Plate Reader and the human ApoA-l ELISA Softmax software.<br>

EXAMPLE 40:	In vivo efficacy<br>
[0175] To test whether the efficacy of compounds of the invention observed<br>
in vitro extended to an in vivo model, transgenic mice carrying multiple copies of<br>
the human ApoA-l gene (Bisaha et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 34,19979-88) or wild-<br>
type mice (C57BL/6 (Stock Number 000664) Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor,<br>
ME)) were exposed to compounds of the invention. In the transgenic mice, the<br>
exogenous human ApoA-l gene in these mice enables them to express the human<br>
ApoA-l protein under the control of its own promoter.<br>
[0176] Seven to eight week old male mice were housed five per cage<br>
(10"x20"x8" with aspen chip bedding) with pelleted Rodent chow [Purina 5001]<br>
and water available at all times. After an acclimation period of 1 week, animals<br>
were individually identified by numbering on tail and weighed. Mice were pre-bled<br>
via the retro-orbital plexus, and 100 µL of blood was collected in 1.5 mL<br>
 <br>
Eppendorf tube containing 5 µL of 0.5 mM EDTA and chilled on ice. Plasma was<br>
collected after centrifuging the whole blood at 14000 rpm [TOMY high speed<br>
micro-refrigerated centrifuge NTX-150] for 10 min at 4°C and frozen at -80°C.<br>
Mice were grouped based on having an average body weight of 25 g.<br>
[0177] A day following pre-bleed, mice were dosed by oral gavage or by<br>
i.p. administration daily using a 20 gauge, 11/2" curved disposable feeding needle<br>
(Popper &amp; Sons); when B.I.D., mice were gavaged morning and afternoon (8 am<br>
and 5 pm); when Q.D. mice were gavaged in morning (8 am). Compounds were<br>
prepared each day in vehicle. One day prior to necropsy mice were weighed and<br>
fasted overnight. On final day of dosing, mice were sacrificed post 2 h of dosing<br>
by inhalation of CO2 and blood was obtained via cardiac puncture (0.7-1.0 mL).<br>
Plasma was collected and frozen at -80°C. Samples were assayed for ApoA-l by<br>
ELISA, and HDL-C by HPLC (Polaris 200 with an auto sampler Prostar 410 from<br>
Varian on a Superose 6 10/30 column from Amersham). During necropsy, liver<br>
and enterocytes from the duodenum and jejunum of small intestine were<br>
collected, cleaned with cold PBS and frozen at -80°C for further analysis of<br>
compound and mRNA levels by Q-PCR.<br>
[0178] Experiment A 2-(4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-5,7-<br>
dimethoxyquinazolin-4(3H)-one (10, 30 and 60 mg/kg of body weight, mpk) were<br>
BID administered to hApoA-l transgenic mice daily for seven days by oral gavage<br>
in 1% DMSO, 2.5% Tween-80, 10% PEG-300 QS to water. Plasma was assayed<br>
for ApoA-l (Fig. 1), and HDL cholesterol (Fig. 2).<br>
[0179] Experiment B 2-(4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-5,7-<br>
dimethoxyquinazolin-4(3H)-one (10, 30 and 60 mg/kg of body weight) were BID<br>
administered to wild-type C57BL/6 mice daily for three days by i.p. administration<br>
 <br>
in 1% DMSO, 2.5% Tween-80, 10% PEG-300 QS to water. Plasma was assayed<br>
for ApoA-l (Fig. 3), and HDL cholesterol (Fig. 4).<br>
[0180] Experiment C 2-(4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-5,7-<br>
dimethoxyquinazolin-4(3H)-one (30 mg/kg of body weight) were BID administered<br>
to hApoA-l transgenic mice daily for seven days by oral gavage in 1% DMSO,<br>
2.5% Tween-80, 10% PEG-300 QS to water. Plasma was assayed for ApoA-l<br>
and tissues were assayed for mRNA (Fig. 5).<br>
[0181] These results indicate that the compounds of the invention are<br>
useful for increasing the transcription of ApoA-l in vivo, and elevating plasma<br>
levels of ApoA-l and circulating levels of HDL-C in wild-type and hApoA-l<br>
transgenic mice. These results demonstrate that compounds of the invention<br>
activate the human ApoA-l transgene in mice, leading to an increase in circulating<br>
ApoA-l.<br>
