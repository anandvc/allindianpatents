				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a novel formulation of Prasugrel.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Thienopyridines such as Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel (sold as Plavix ®.<br>
registered trademark of Sanofi-Aventis S.A) have been used for the treatment of<br>
thrombosis and related diseases. Clopidogrel in particular has found widespread use<br>
compared to the older ticlopidine.<br>
Prasugrel is a next generation thienopyridine currently undergoing clinical<br>
development for the treatment of thrombosis and/or related diseases including as an<br>
adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention procedures.<br>
US Patent 5,288,726 discloses and claims tetrahydrothienopyridine derivatives<br>
including 2-Acetoxy-5-(a-cycloprpylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydrothieno [3,2-c] pyridine.<br>
US patent 6, 693,115 B2 discloses and claims the hydrochloric acid and maleic<br>
acid salts of 2-Acetoxy-5-(α-cycloprpylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-<br>
tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine. The HC1 and maleate salt forms provide unexpected<br>
and unobvious improvements in their efficacy and stability profiles compared to Other<br>
salts and also compared to the free base molecule. The HC1 salt of 2-Acetoxy-5-(α-<br>
cycloprpylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine is also<br>
known as Prasugrel. Prolonged exposure of the HC1 salt (prasugrel) to air and<br>
moisture results in some degradation.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for further improvements in the stability, shelf life<br>
and therefore long term efficacy of individual doses of prasugrel.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
As used herein the term "Prasugrel" means the compound of formula I as<br>
shown. While the compound is also named CS-747HC1, and Prasugrel HC1 here and<br>
elsewhere, these terms mean one and the same thing, the compound of formula I as<br>
shown.<br><br>
The term, "Cardiovascular Diseases" refers to diseases treatable, preventable,<br>
or able to be ameliorated by treatment with a compound of formula I and/or by<br>
performance of cardiac interventional procedures including coronary (PCI) and non-<br>
coronary interventions. Examples of cardiovascular diseases encompassed by the<br>
invention include coronary occlusion, restenosis, stroke, acute coronary syndrome<br>
(ACS), ACS with medical management (ACS-MM), high risk vascular diseases<br>
(HRVD), cerebro vascular aneurysm (CVA). congestive heart failure, cardiac<br>
alternation, ventricular aneurysm, neural aneurysm, myocardial infarction, cardiac<br>
arrest, cardiac dysrhythmia including atrial fibrillation, cardiac edema, cardiac dyspnea,<br>
cardiac failure, tachycardia, cardiac hemoptysis, cardiac incompetence, cardiac<br>
murmur, cardiac syncope, cardiac tamponade, cerebrovascular disease and/or<br>
peripheral artery disease.<br>
"Administering" as used herein refers to an oral administration of the<br>
compound of formula I including buccal, sublingual and other forms of oral<br>
administration, which allow for the compound of formula I to perform its intended<br>
function of treating and/or preventing the occurrence or recurrence of Cardiovascular<br>
Diseases independently or as part of a combination therapy (treatment) with an<br>
interventional procedure such as a PCI procedure or as part of a combination treatment<br>
with other cardioprotective agents. Such administration by virtue of the combination<br>
treatment includes the performance of a PCI procedure e.g. the implantation of stent, or<br>
performance of balloon angioplasty.<br>
The term "treatment" as used herein refers to the amelioration, inhibition,<br>
prevention of occurrence or recurrence, reduction in severity or effect of cardiovascular<br>
diseases including but not limited to restenosis, acute coronary syndromes (ACS)<br>
including medically managed ACS, myocardial infarction, cerebro vascular aneurysm,<br>
and high risk vascular diseases by the use of a compound of formula I singly or in<br>
combination with other cardio-protective agents or as an adjunct to an interventional<br>
procedure such as PCI or other interventional procedure.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein refers to the amount<br>
of a compound of formula I necessary or sufficient in single or multiple units to treat<br>
the particular Cardiovascular Disease in a treatment regimen comprised of a compound<br><br>
of formula I as prescribed by a qualified treating physician or as approved by<br>
applicable regulatory authorities.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending on factors known to<br>
one of skill in the art (a qualified prescriber) including for example, the optional<br>
combination of compound I with aspirin or other cardioprotective agent or<br>
interventional procedure such as PCI, the use of drug coated stents, mode and regimen<br>
of administration, the size of the subject, genetic or behavioral predisposition to<br>
Cardiovascular Diseases or the severity and recurrence thereof. One of skill in the art<br>
would be able to consider these and related factors to make the appropriate<br>
determination regarding the therapeutically effective amount for a particular patient.<br>
The phrase "other cardio protective agents" as used herein refers to therapeutic<br>
agents that have been proven and approved to provide beneficial effects (treatment<br>
anaVor prevention of occurrence or recurrence) to a patient afflicted with or susceptible<br>
to Cardiovascular Diseases. Examples of cardioprotective agents include but are not<br>
limited to aspirin, effective GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, effective statins such as HMG-CoA<br>
reductase inhibitors, super statins, acyl CoA-cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT)<br>
inhibitors, effective anticoagulants, effective thienopyridines, and other effective lipid<br>
modifying agents.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to any substance or<br>
medium co-formulated with the compound of formula 1 and which allows the<br>
compound to perform its intended function. Examples of such carriers include<br>
solutions, solvents, dispersion media, delay agents, emulsions, microparticles and the<br>
like for combination therapies.<br>
The phrases "combination therapy," "combination treatment," "in conjunction<br>
with," "combination of a compound of formula I and stent," and "in conjunction with a<br>
PCI procedure" if and as used herein are synonymous and indicate that a patient who is<br>
a candidate for a PCI procedure or other interventional procedure is administered a<br>
therapeutically effective dose(s) of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, prodrug, active metabolite, racemate or enantiomer thereof, optionally<br>
in combination with aspirin at a reasonable period of time prior to and/or after PCI or<br>
other interventional procedure. A reasonable period of time for administering the<br><br>
compound of formula 1, optionally wich aspirin, prior to PCI or other interventional<br>
procedure may be up to about sixty days prior and may include no prior administration.<br>
The purpose of the prior administration is to achieve an on-going beneficial effect plus<br>
a rapid onset of an effect on platelet function prior to the intervention procedure, and<br>
over and above the rapid onset characteristic of a compound of formula I, without prior<br>
treatment (loading dose), thereby maximizing the potential benefit to the patient. The<br>
dosing of a compound of formula I prior to an interventional procedure such as<br>
stenting or balloon angioplasty may not be practical or necessary in emergency<br>
situations. For the purpose of this invention a reasonable period after PCI or other<br>
interventional procedure, for conjunctive treatment with a compound of formula I, may<br>
be a period of from about 5 days to about 700 days and preferably from about 30 days<br>
to about 365 days. Ultimately, the precise period of therapy according to this invention<br>
is a determination to be made by the treating or attending physician and tailored to the<br>
particular patient.<br>
The phrase "air and moisture impervious" as used herein means materials of<br>
appropriate thickness known to one of skill in the art or ascertainable with minimal<br>
experimentation that when sealed within specifications are likely to substantially and<br>
significantly prevent air and moisture entry and egress. One of skill in the art is aware<br>
that absolute imperviousness may be difficult to achieve and that the inventors believe<br>
that the phrase "air and moisture impervious" material or blister pack is used<br>
comparatively based on the knowledge of one skilled in the art that some materials are<br>
less impervious to air and moisture than others and that absolute imperviousness is<br>
difficult to attain. A material that is both air and moisture impervious is preferred.<br>
Examples of air and moisture impervious materials include aluminum, PCTFE<br>
(Aclar®) and Aclar®-EVOH. Aluminum foil blister packs are most preferred.<br>
The phrase "gas-inerted" as used herein means that a gas that is inert to the<br>
tablet, capsule, caplet or other solid formulation surrounds the available cavity or space<br>
other than that occupied by the tablet, caplet, or capsule in a blister pack. The gas may<br>
be an inert gas or other gas that does not adversely affect (react with) the tablet, caplet<br>
or capsule. Examples of gases useful as inciting gases include CO2, argon, nitrogen,<br>
neon, krypton, and CO (m non-lethal pharmaceutically acceptable quantities). More<br><br>
preferred as a gas useful for the practice of the invention is nitrogen or argon. Most<br>
preferred is nitrogen.<br>
The phrases "predominantly," and "predominance of an inert gas" as used<br>
herein are synonymous and are intended to mean that the volume of space surrounding<br>
the tablet, caplct or capsule in the blister pack cavity is essentially or nearly or as much<br>
as practically possible completely filled with nitrogen or other inert gas. The effect of<br>
said "predominance of an inert gas" is mat oxygen content is reduced to about less than<br>
2% to 4%.<br>
The term "base equivalent" as used herein conveys its ordinary meaning, i.e.<br>
amount of the compound of formula I (the HC1 salt) that is equivalent to the base form.<br>
One of skill in the art is able to make the conversion, and sample equivalent amounts<br>
are shown in the examples.<br>
The term "other solid formulation" as used herein include fast disintegrating,<br>
fast dissolving, quick release or other approved or approvable solid presention of a<br>
drug known to one of skill in the art.<br>
The term "formulation" as used herein includes its ordinary meaning and also<br>
includes the pharmaceutically prepared compound of formula I and the packaging of<br>
said compound of formula I according to the present invention. Thus a compound of<br>
formula I formulated eimer as the tablet, caplet. capsule, slow release or fast<br>
disintegrating (dissolving) form or other solid form packaged in a gas-inerted<br>
aluminum foil blister pack is a formulation for the purpose of the present invention.<br>
Likewise, a compound of formula I formulated either as the tablet, caplet, capsule,<br>
slow release or fast disintegrating (dissolving) form or other solid form packaged in a<br>
gas-inerted aluminum foil blister pack is an article of manufacture for the purpose of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is the provision of a pharmaceutical<br>
formulation comprising a compound of formula I wherein individual tablets, caplets or<br>
capsules of said compound are packaged in an air and moisture impervious material<br>
containing an inert gas for the purpose of improving the stability and/or extending shelf<br>
life.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the present invention provides a formulation of the<br>
compound of formula 1 wherein tablets, caplets or capsules containing the compound of<br>
formula I are packaged in aluminum foil blister packs in an atmosphere comprised<br>
predominantly of an inert gas.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the tablets, caplets or capsules of the compound<br>
of formula I are packaged in a blister pack(s) containing a gas selected from the group<br>
consisting of nitrogen, helium, neon, argon, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment the tablets, caplets or capsules of the compound<br>
of formula I are packaged in blister pack(s) inerted with a gas selected from the group<br>
consisting of nitrogen, helium, and argon. In a most preferred embodiment, the tablets,<br>
caplets or capsules of the compound of formula I are packaged in nitrogen-inerted blister<br>
pack(s). Thus a most preferred formulation comprises tablets, caplets or capsules of the<br>
compound of formula I packaged in nitrogen-inerted aluminum foil blister pack(s).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the compound of formula I packaged in an air<br>
and moisture impervious nitrogen inerted aluminum blister pack is adapted for use in<br>
treating ACS, ACS with medical management (ACS-MM), Stroke, and HRVD singly or<br>
in combination with other cardio-protective agents or as an adjunct to an interventional<br>
procedure such as PCI or other interventional procedure.<br>
The compound of formula I, analogs, salts, solvates, and enantiomer thereof may<br>
be prepared by a variety of methods, including methods described in portions or all of the<br>
disclosures of U.S. Patent Nos. 5,288,726 and 6,693,115B2 the entire contents of which<br>
are incorporated herein by reference. In particular, US patent 6,693,115 B2 discloses and<br>
claims the hydrochloric acid salt of 2-acetoxy-5-(α-cyclopropylcarbonyl-2-fluorobenzyl)-<br>
4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine), the compound of formula I, also known as<br>
Prasugrel.<br>
A solid oral dosage form can be prepared using a variety of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients, well known to one skilled in the art. Normally, one or more<br>
excipients would be selected from each of the following categories;<br>
(a) Diluents such as but not limited to mannitol, lactose monohydrate,<br>
pregelatinized starch or microcrystalline cellulose.<br><br>
(b)	Disintegrates such as but not limited to croscarmellose sodium, low substituted<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose or sodium starch glycolate.<br>
(c)	Binders including but not limited to hydroxypropyl mcthylcellulose and<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose. For tablet applications, a lubricant would also be recommended<br>
such as but not limited to magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and glyceryl behcnate.<br>
If a tablet is produced, it is often desirable to film coat the resulting tablet to<br>
provide a pharmaceutically acceptable appearance and to make said tablet easier to<br>
swallow. Commercial suppliers such as, for example, Colorcon Inc.(USA), produce a<br>
variety of film coating systems containing polymers, plasticizcrs and pigments that can be<br>
mixed with water and sprayed onto the tablets in a side vented coating pan. A particularly<br>
preferred system is marketed as Opadry II® and this film coating system (containing the<br>
additive lactose monohydrate) is especially useful in film coating debossed tablets.<br>
Conceivably, prasugrel could be blended with one or more excipients described<br>
above and filled into capsules or compressed into tablets. In order to improve the flow<br>
properties, it might be desirable to pass these blends through a roller compactor or other<br>
equipment to produce a more flowable material.<br>
Because of the stability properties of prasugrel (susceptibility to hydrolysis and<br>
oxidation), certain excipients- most notably povidone and crospovidone (usually<br>
containing trace peroxides) and manufacturing processes (e.g. wet granulation) would not<br>
be recommended. Gas inerted aluminum foil blister packaging is an advantageous and<br>
attractive solution to the problem. To further enhance product stability once<br>
manufactured, unit dose blister packaging, in particular, gas inerted aluminum foil blister<br>
packaging is an advantageous solution to the problem.<br>
Unit dose blister packaging is a convenient presentation for patients and health<br>
care providers and these cavities and packages can be prepared from a number of film<br>
forming materials. Most commonly, blisters are prepared from films comprised of PVC,<br>
PCTFE, and other additives designed to allow the cavity to be formed by heating and<br>
tooling designed to create a cavity lo hold the finished solid oral dosage form (capsule,<br>
gelcap or tablet). After the dosage form is filled into the formed cavities, a foil backing<br>
composite is applied to the top of the cavities and the backing is sealed to the blister film<br>
by the application of appropriate amount of heat. One of skill in the art is able to effect<br><br>
the above procedure including determining the appropriate amount of heat with minimal<br>
experimentation.<br>
Another type of unit dose blister packaging consists of cold form aluminum<br>
blisters. In these cases, a heavier gauge of foil with appropriate additives is formed<br>
without the application of heat into a cavity to hold the solid oral dosage form. After the<br>
dosage form is filled into the formed cavities, a foil backing composite is applied to the<br>
top of the cavities and the backing is sealed to the cavities by the application of<br>
appropriate heat. One significant advantage of this type of blister is that the aluminum<br>
foil is virtually impervious to moisture and oxygen and thus may be particularly suited to<br>
packaging dosage forms of Prasugrel (compound of formula I) requiring greater<br>
protection from moisture and air. An air and moisture impervious gas-inerted blister pack<br>
having aluminum cavity and aluminum foil covering is most preferred.<br>
The introduction of an inert atmosphere into the blister cavity can be<br>
accomplished by various means. In one instance, a vacuum may be used to evacuate the<br>
air from the formed cavities and the tablets then filled into the cavities in a chamber<br>
constructed over the blistering machine such that the atmosphere can be controlled by<br>
introduction of an inert gas thereby effectively minimizing the oxygen content.<br>
Alternatively, a gas purging station could be placed on the blistering machine to<br>
introduce pressurized inert gases into the cavities containing tablets just prior to the<br>
sealing station. By controlling the pressure of the gas purging station, the atmosphere<br>
containing oxygen can be forced out of the cavity, effectively reducing the oxygen content<br>
of the cavity containing the dosage form by predominantly filling the cavity with inert gas.<br>
Alternatively, gas-inerting may be accomplished by injecting a controlled amount<br>
of a liquified inert gas into the blister cavity just prior to the sealing station. As the gas<br>
heats up and expands, oxygen may be effectively reduced by displacement.<br>
Demonstration of the Invention<br>
The stability of tablets, capsules or caplets of the compound of formula I is<br>
affected by factors including age (length of storage), and storage conditions, such as for<br>
example, temperature and relative humidity. The proper storage conditions ensure an<br>
extended shelf life during which the potency of the tablets, caplets or capsules is more<br>
likely to be within recommended and/or approved specification limits thereby ensuring<br><br>
the chemical and pharmacodynamic integrity of the tablets, caplets or capsules<br>
administered to patients. Studies have shown that despite the improvements associated<br>
with the HCI salt of CS-747 vis-a-vis stability, etc (see U.S. Patent 6,693,115B2) there<br>
remains room for improvement. Specifically, it is now known that stored tablets<br>
containing the compound of formula 1 degrade by both hydrolytic and oxidative<br>
pathways. It is also believed that there are crossovers between these degradation<br>
pathways wherein intermediates or products of certain steps in one pathway may inter-<br>
convert or be kinetically accelerated or hindered by the concentration of product (or<br>
intermediate), air or moisture from the environment or the other pathway. A proposed<br>
schematic of degradation pathways as currently postulated is shown below in Schemes<br>
1 and 2.<br><br><br>
The inventors have been able to individually track hydrolytic degradation<br>
products OXTP1 and OXTP2, along with the oxidative degradation products Diketone<br>
and HYTP. As shown in Scheme 2. two primary degradation products, OXTP<br><br>
tautomer and iminium, are believed to react with each other to give a mixture of<br>
dimeric isomers. These dimeric isomers then can react further resulting in a complex<br>
mixture of products that have been termed "late eluting impurities" or LEIs. The level<br>
of any individual LEI is insignificant; however, when measured collectively, the<br>
amount of degradation represented by the LEIs is significant. The inventors have<br>
discovered an improved formulation by tracking the amounts of these degradation<br>
products over time under controlled temperature and humidity conditions using<br>
different packaging methods. The ideal formulation would result in minimizing the<br>
amount of all degradation products over a longer time period. However, because of the<br>
interplay of pathways of degradation and inter-conversion between degradation<br>
produces and pathways, the next best possibility is to discover a packaging or<br>
formulation that affords the least change in potency. In other words, a preferred<br>
objective is to discover a formulation that affords a composite reduction over time in<br>
most of the degradation products thereby satisfying a hitherto unmet need. Also<br>
preferred is a formulation of prasugrel comprising a packaging method/process that<br>
harnesses the potential advantage of "controlling" the mix of degradation products to<br>
produce a more favorable distribution. For example, it may be desirable to have less<br>
LEI's and more OXTP 1 and 2. OXTP 1 and 2 are (1) better "known" entities, (2)<br>
have been qualified by toxicological studies, (3) have specification limits, and (4) can<br>
be quantitated in the related substances method. The inventors have achieved the first<br>
objective of a general reduction in impurity profiles allowing for improved stability<br>
and longer shelf life. Invention have also achieved the additional objective of<br>
"controlling" the mix of degradation products to favor reduction in the amounts of<br>
LEI's which are less well-defined or unknown, largely uncharacterized, and for which<br>
specified limits have not been set.<br>
The inventors compared the effect of packaging materials and methods on the<br>
stability of a drug product containing the compound of formula I. The materials and<br>
methods compared include (1) nitrogen inerted blisterpacks comprised of 2.0 mil<br>
PCTFE (polychlorotrifluoroethylene) containing blister material and aluminum foil<br>
lidding; (2) nitrogen inerted blister packs comprised of 2.0 mil PCTFE/ethyl vinyl<br>
alcohol (EVOH) combination blister material and aluminum foil lidding; (3) non-<br><br>
inerted blister packs comprised of cold form aluminum foil blister material with<br>
aluminum foil lidding; (4) nitrogen-inerted blister packs comprised of cold form<br>
aluminum foil blister material with aluminum foil lidding; and (5) a 50 count, 75-mL<br>
bottle with a combination silica gel and carbon desiccant pack. A general packaging<br>
description and results for each described package configuration are described below.<br>
A tablet formulation containing 12.5 mg of the compound of formula T was<br>
provided for packaging into 4 separate unit dose blister pack configurations, as<br>
described above. The blister-packed tablets were then placed into controlled<br>
environment chambers having the following conditions: 25 °C at 60% relative<br>
humidity, 30 °C at 65% relative humidity, and 40 °C at 75% relative humidity.<br>
Samples were removed from these controlled chambers at various elapsed times from<br>
their initial placement in the controlled environments. The samples were submitted for<br>
chemical analysis to assess changes in potency, total related substances (TRS),<br>
OXTP1, OXTP2, Diketone, HYTP and Late Eluting Impurities (LED- Data from the<br>
various blister packed materials along with data for the same lot of tablets packaged in<br>
an HDPE bottle with desiccant are presented below.<br><br><br>
packages that were incapable of preserving a low oxygen environment or which were<br>
packaged under normal atmospheric conditioas. This was true for each of the storage<br>
conditions (25 °C, 60%RH and 30 °C, 65%RH). This trend was true at 10 and 12<br>
months.<br>
Late Eluting Impurities is a combination of peaks the identities of which have<br>
not been determined. Advantageously and unexpectedly, the present invention<br>
(particularly, the use of cold form nitrogen inerted aluminum foil blister packs) results<br>
in a significant reduction of the percentage of these combined late eluting impurities<br>
(LEI's) or degradation products. The LEI's in tablets stored in nitrogen inerted cold<br>
form aluminum foil blisters were substantially lower than for tablets stored in the other<br>
packages that were incapable of maintaining a low oxygen environment or which were<br>
packaged under normal atmospheric conditions. This was true for each of the storage<br>
conditions (25 °C, 60%RH, 30 °C, 65%RH and 40 °C, 75%RH (not shown)).<br>
During the execution of this study, empty blisters were produced with nitrogen inerting<br>
using the three blister materials; 2.0 mil PCTFE, EVOH/PCTFE and cold form<br>
aluminum blisters. At representative intervals, the oxygen content of these empty<br>
blisters was measured to determine the impact of storage time and conditions on this<br>
parameter. Representative results are presented below in figure 1:<br>
Figure 1: Oxygen Content Analyses of Blister Packs<br><br><br>
Based on the inability of the two clear blister films (2.0 mil PCTFE and<br>
EVOH/PCTFE) to maintain a low oxygen environment, these blisters (2,0 mil PCTFE<br>
and EVOH/PCTFE) were not assayed at some of the later timepoints in this study.<br>
This study showed that the cold form nitrogen inerted aluminum foil blister packs at 25<br>
p.si, 30 oC, and 65% RH contained the least amount of oxygen over time.<br>
In a subsequent formulation stability study, a tablet formulation containing 12.5<br>
mg of the compound of formula I was provided for packaging into foil pouches that<br>
were inerted with gases containing known concentrations of oxygen in nitrogen to<br>
further elucidate the impact of oxygen concentration on the formation of impurities in<br>
the formulation. The results of this study referred to herein as Multi-Vac study are<br>
presented in the following Table 2:<br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the potency of tablets stored in low oxygen environments<br>
such as those achieved with the cold form nitrogen-inerted aluminum foil blister packs<br>
was consistently higher than the potency for tablets packaged under normal<br>
atmospheric conditions or at higher oxygen environments (as shown in table above).<br>
This was true for each of the stability (tested) conditions (25 °C, 60%RH, 30 °C,<br>
65%RH and 40 °C, 75%RH).<br>
The LEI results for tablets stored in low oxygen content foil pouches (blister<br>
packs) were consistently lower than for tablets stored in packages containing normal<br><br>
atmospheric conditions or at higher oxygen environments. This was true for each of<br>
the stability conditions (25 °C, 60%RH, 30 °C, 65%RH and 40 °C, 75%RH).<br>
To examine the impact of moisture content on resultant tablet stability in<br>
nitrogen inerted or normal atmosphere blisters, tablets of formulation 2 (infra) were<br>
stored at different relative humidities and then packaged into cold form blisters, with or<br>
without nitrogen inertiug. The results are presented in the Table 3.<br><br>
As shown in Table 3, the potency of tablets exposed to lower humidities prior<br>
to packaging and then nitrogen inerted when placed into cold form aluminum blisters<br>
was consistently higher than for tablets exposed to higher humidities and then<br>
packaged under normal atmospheric conditions. This was true for each of the stability<br>
conditions (25 °C, 60%RH, 30 °C, 65%RH and 40 °C, 75%RH).<br>
Also as shown in Table 3, the LEI's in tablets exposed to lower humidities prior<br>
to packaging and then nitrogen inerted when placed into cold form aluminum blisters<br>
were consistently lower than for tablets exposed to higher humidities and then<br>
packaged under normal atmospheric conditions. This was true for each of the stability<br>
conditions (25 °C, 60%RH, 30 °C, 65%RH and 40 °C, 75%RH).<br>
Diketone Peak<br>
With respect to the assayed level of the diketone related substance peak, the<br>
invention also demonstrates a significant, unexpected and advantageous improvement<br>
over other forms of formulation. Each study (tables 1-3) illustrated that the formation<br>
of this impurity was related to oxygen concentrations. Packages such as the cold form<br>
nitrogen inerted aluminum foil blister packs containing and maintaining lower oxygen<br>
environments tended to minimize the formation of this impurity.<br><br>
HYTP Peak<br>
With respect to the amount of the HYTP peak, the invention demonstrates a<br>
significant, unexpected and advantageous improvement over other forms of<br>
formulation/packaging. Each study (Tables 1-3) illustrated that the formation of this<br>
impurity was related to oxygen concentrations. Packages such as cold form nitrogen<br>
inerted aluminum foil blister packs containing and maintaining lower oxygen content<br>
tended to minimize the formation of this impurity. In addition, as this impurity is<br>
derived from hydrolysis products (OXTP)- exposure to lower relative humidities<br>
and/or packages containing a desiccant also helped to lessen the formation of this<br>
impurity.<br>
Thus, applicants have also provided a method of advantageously controlling the<br>
distribution of impurities. The use of nitrogen-inerted blister packs reduces the<br>
amounts of impurities as discussed above, importantly, it also has the effect of shifting<br>
the distribution of impurities by particularly minimizing the amount of LEI's.<br>
Applicants by operation of the present invention have achieved control of water<br>
activity to levels from about 0.2 to about 0.4. Also applicants have achieved<br>
reductions in oxygen content in the head space of the blister pack to about less than 2%<br>
to 4%,<br>
