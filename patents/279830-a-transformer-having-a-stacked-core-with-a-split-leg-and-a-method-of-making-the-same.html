ATRANSFORMER HAVING A STACKED CORE<br>
WITH A SPLIT LEG AND A METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to transformers and more particularly, to transformers<br>
having a stacked core and methods of making the same with reduced waste.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	A stacked transformer core is comprised of thin metallic laminate plates,<br>
such as grain oriented silicon steel. This type of material is used because the grain of<br>
'the steel may be groomed-in certain directions to reduce the maqnetic field loss. The<br>
plates are stacked on too of each other to form a plurality of layers. A stacked core Is<br>
typically rectangular in shape and can have a rectangular or cruciform cross-section. A<br>
front view of a conventional three leg stacked core 10 for a three phase transformer is<br>
shown in Fig. 1. The core 10 comprises an upper yoke 12, a lower yoke 14, an inner<br>
leg 16, and first and second outer legs 18, 20. A pair of windows 22 are disposed<br>
between the inner leg 16 and the first and second outer legs 18, 20, respectively. Wire<br>
coils (not shown) are mounted to the inner leg 16 and the first and second outer legs<br>
18, 20, respectively.<br>
[0003]	The upper yoke 12 comprises a stack of plates 24, the lower yoke 14<br>
comprises a stack of steel plates 26, the first outer leg 18 comprises a stack of plates 28 '<br>
and the second outer leg 20 comprises a stack of plates 30. The plates 24,26 of the upper<br>
and lower yokes 12, 14 have opposing ends that form joints with opposing ends of the<br>
plates 28, 30 of the first and second outer legs 18, 20, respectively. A V-shaped upper<br>
notch 32 is formed in each of the plates 24 of the upper yoke 12 and a V-shaped lower<br>
notch 36 is formed in each of the plates 26 of the lower yoke 14. The upper notches 32<br>
form an upper groove 38 in the upper yoke 12, while the lower notches 36 form a lower<br>
groove 40 in the lower yoke 14. The size of the individual plates 24-30 vary depending on<br>
the stacking technique used to assemble the core 10.<br>
1<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
[0004] . The inner leg 16 comprises a stack of plates 42. Each of the plates 42 has an<br>
upper tined end 42a formed by a pair of miter cuts and a lower tined end 42b formed by a<br>
pair of miter cuts. The upper and lower tined ends 42a, b of the plates 42 provide the inner<br>
leg 16 with upper and lower tined ends 16a, b, which are adapted for receipt in the upper<br>
and lower grooves 38, 40 of the upper and lower yokes 12, 14, respectively.<br>
[0005]	The manufacture of the conventional core 10 described above results in a<br>
significant amount of steel being cut away and discarded. For example, during the<br>
manufacture of the inner leg 16, four pieces of steel must be cut away from each plate 42<br>
to provide the plate 42 with tined ends. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a<br>
stacked transformer core and a method of making the same that reduces the amount of<br>
steel that is discarded and, thus, wasted. The present invention is directed to such a<br>
transformer core and method,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	In accordance with the present invention, a transformer is provided having a<br>
stacked core. The core is provided with a first yoke formed from a stack of plates and<br>
having an outer side and an inner side with a groove formed therein. The groove extends in<br>
a stacking direction of the plates and is located inwardly from the outer side. The core is<br>
also provided with a second yoke formed from a stack of plates and having an outer side<br>
and an inner side with a groove formed therein. The groove extends in the stacking<br>
direction of the plates and is located inwardly from the outer side. A first end of an inner leg ■<br>
is disposed in the groove of the first yoke and a second end of the inner leg is disposed in<br>
the groove of the second yoke. The inner leg includes a first stack of first plates abutting a<br>
second stack of second plates. A coil winding is mounted to the inner leg of the core.<br>
[0007]	Also provided in accordance with the present invention is a method of<br>
forming a transformer with a stacked core. In accordance with the method, a plurality of<br>
first and second outer leg plates is provided. A plurality of inner leg plates and a<br>
plurality of first yoke plates are also provided. Each of the first yoke plates has an outer<br>
side and an inner side with a notch formed therein. The notch is located inwardly from<br>
the outer side. The inner leg plates, the first yoke plates and the first and second outer<br>
2<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
leg plates are stacked to form first and second outer legs, a first yoke with a first . .<br>
groove, and an inner leg having a first end disposed in the first groove. The first outer<br>
leg is formed from the first outer leg plates, the second outer leg is formed from the<br>
second outer leg plates and the first yoke is formed from the first yoke plates. The inner<br>
leg is formed from a first stack of the inner leg plates abutting a second stack of the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019]	It should be noted that in the detailed description that follows, identical<br>
components have the same reference numerals, regardless of whether they are shown<br>
in different embodiments of the present invention. It should also be noted that in order<br>
to clearly and concisely disclose the present invention, the drawings may not<br>
necessarily be to scale and certain features of the invention may be shown in<br>
somewhat schematic form.<br>
[0020]	The present invention is directed to a transformer 100 (shown in Fig. 6), such<br>
as a distribution transformer, having a stacked core 102. The transformer 100 may be an<br>
oil-filled transformer, i.e., cooled by oil, or a dry-type transformer, i.e., cooled by air. The<br>
construction of the core 102, however, is especially suitable for use in a dry transformer.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2, the core 102 has a rectangular shape and generally comprises an ■<br>
upper yoke 104, a lower yoke 106, first and second outer legs 108, 110 and an inner leg<br>
112. Upper ends of the first and second outer legs 108, 110 are connected to first and<br>
second ends of the upper yoke 104, respectively, while lower ends of the first and second<br>
outer legs 108, 110 are connected to first and second ends of the lower yoke 105. The<br>
inner leg 112 is disposed about midway between the first and second outer legs 108,110<br>
and has an upper end connected to the upper yoke 104 and a lower end connected to the<br>
lower yoke 106. With this construction, two windows 113 are formed between the inner leg<br>
112 and the first and second outer legs 108,110.<br>
[0021]	The upper yoke 104 has an inner side 104a and an outer side 104b, and the<br>
lower yoke 106 has an inner side 106a and an outer side 106b. The upper yoke 104<br>
comprises a stack of plates 114, while the lower yoke 106 comprises a stack of plates 116.<br>
Both the plates 114 and the plates 116 are arranged in groups. In one exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the groups are groups of seven. Of course, groups of<br>
different numbers may be used, such as groups of four, which are used herein for ease of<br>
description and illustration. Each of the plates 114, 116 is composed of grain-oriented<br>
4<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
silicon steel and has a thickness in a range of from about 7 mils to about 14 mils, with the<br>
particular thickness being selected based on the application of the transformer 100. The<br>
plates 114,116 each have a unitary construction and are trapezoidal in shape. In each of<br>
the plates 114,116, opposing ends of the plate 114,116 are mitered at oppositely-directed<br>
angles of about 45°, thereby providing the plate 114,116 with major and minor side edges.<br>
The plates 114 have the same width to provide the upper yoke 104 with a rectangular<br>
cross-section and the plates 116 have the same width to provide the lower yoke 106 with a<br>
rectangular cross-section. However, the lengths of the plates 114 are not a!! the same and<br>
the lengths of the plates 116 are not all the same. More specifically, the lengths within each<br>
group of plates 114 are different and the lengths within each group of plates 116 are<br>
different; The pattern of different lengths is the same for each group of plates 114 and the<br>
pattern of different lengths is the same for each group of plates 116. The difference in<br>
lengths within each group permits the formation of multi-stop lap joints with plates 120. 122<br>
of the first and second outer legs 108, 110 as will be described more fully below.<br>
[0022]	A V-shaped upper notch 124 is formed in each of the plates 114 of the upper<br>
yoke 104 by an upper interior edge 126 and a V-shaped lower notch 128 is formed in each<br>
of the plates 116 of the lower yoke 106 by a lower interior edge 130, The upper interio!<br>
edges 126 in adjacent plates 114 of the upper yoke 104 have different depths for forming '<br>
vertical lap joints with upper ends of inner leg plates 152 of the inner leg 112, as wil! be<br>
described more fully below. Similarly, the lower interior edges 130 in adjacent plates 116 of<br>
the lower yoke 106 have different depths for forming vertical lap joints with lower ends of<br>
the inner leg plates 152 of the inner leg 112, as will be described more fully beiow. The<br>
upper notches 124 form an upper groove 136 in the upper yoke 104, while the lower<br>
notches 128 form a lower groove 138 (shown best in Fig. 4) in the lower yoke 104. The<br>
upper groove 136 is located inwardly from the outer side 104b, and the lower groove 138 is<br>
located inwardly from the outer side 106b. The upper and lower grooves 136,138 extend in<br>
the stacking directions of the upper and lower yokes 104, 106, respectively.<br>
[0023]	The first outer leg 108 comprises a stack of the plates 120, while the second<br>
outer leg 110 comprises a stack of the plates 122. Both the plates 120 and the plates 122<br>
are arranged in groups of the same number as the plates 114, 116. Each of the plates<br>
5<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
120,122 is composed of grain-oriented silicon steel and has a thickness in a range of from<br>
about 7 mils to about 14 mils, with the particular thickness being selected based on the<br>
application of the transformer 100. The plates 120,122 each have a unitary construction<br>
and are trapezoidal in shape. In each of the plates 120, 122, opposing ends of the plate<br>
are mitered at oppositely-directed angles of about 45°, thereby providing the plate 120,122<br>
with major and minor side edges. The plates 120 have the same width to provide the first<br>
outer leg 108 with a rectangular cross-section and the plates 122 have the same width to<br>
provide the second outer leg 110 with a rectangular cross-section. However, the lengths of<br>
the plates 120 are not all the same and the lengths of the plates 122 are not all the same.<br>
More specifically, the lengths within each group of plates 120 are different and the lengths<br>
within each group of plates 122 are different. The pattern of different lengths is the same<br>
for each group of plaies 120 and the pattern of different lengths is the same for each group<br>
of plates 12?. The difference in lengths within each group permits the formation of the<br>
multi-step joints with the plates 114,116 of the upper and lower yokes 104,106, as will be<br>
described more fully below.<br>
[0024]	Referring now to Fig. 3 there is shown an enlarged view of a portion of the<br>
connection (represented by reference number 142) between the upper end of the first outer<br>
leg 108 and the first end of the upper yoke 104. More specifically, the ends of first,<br>
second, third and fourth plates 120a, b, c, d of the first outer leg 108 abut (form joints with)<br>
the ends of first, second, third and fourth plates 114a, 114b, 114c, 114d of the upper yoke<br>
104, respectively. The first through fourth plates 120a-d of the first outer leg 108 and the<br>
first through fourth plates 14a-d of the upper yoke 104 are successively disposed farther<br>
inwardly. The first through fourth plates 120a-d have successively longer lengths, whereas<br>
.: the first through fourth plates 14a-d have successively shorter lengths. With this<br>
construction, the first plate 114a overlaps the joint between the second plates 114b, 120b,<br>
the second plate 114b overlaps the joint between the third plates 114c, 120c and the third<br>
plate 114coverlaps the joint between the fourth plates 114d, 120d. As shown, outer points<br>
of plates 120b-d of the first outer leg 108 protrude beyond the upper yoke 104. These<br>
outer points may be removed to improve the appearance of the core 102. Although not<br>
shown, additional groups of four plates 114,120 are provided and repeat the pattern of the<br>
6<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
first through fourth plates 114a-d and the first through fourth plates 120a-d. In this manner,<br>
multi-step lap joints are formed between the plates 114 of the upper yoke 104 and the<br>
plates 120 of the first outer leg 108, with plates 114 of the upper yoke 104 overlapping<br>
plates 120 of the first outer leg 108.<br>
[0025] The other connections (represented by reference numerals 144, 146, 148)<br>
between the first and second outer legs 108,110 and the upper and lower yokes 104, 106<br>
are constructed in the same manner as the connection 142 so as to have multi-step lap<br>
joints. It should be appreciated, however, that the connections 142-148 may have a<br>
different type of construction. For example, instead of the connections 142-148 having a<br>
four step lap joint pattern, the connections 142-148 may have a seven, or other number<br>
step lap joint pattern. In addition, instead of having plates 114, 116 of the upper and lower<br>
yokes 104, 106 overlapping plates 120, 122 of the first and second outer legs 108, 110.<br>
plates 120, 122 of the first-and second outer legs 103, 110 may overlap pialos 114, 116 of<br>
the upper and lower yokes 104, 106. With this construction, outer points of the plates 114,<br>
116 would protrude beyond the first and second outer legs 108, 110, respectively.<br>
[0026]	The inner leg 112 comprises a first stack 150 of inner leg plates 152 and a<br>
second stack 154 of inner leg-plates 152, In each of the first and second stacks 150, 154,<br>
the inner ieg. plates 152 are-arranged in groups of the same number as the plates 114,<br>
116. The first and second stacks 150, 154 abut each other along a seam 158 that extends<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the inner leg 112. Upper ends of the first and second stacks<br>
150, 154 are disposed in the upper groove 136 of the upper yoke 104 and lower ends of<br>
the first and second stacks 150, 154 are disposed in the lower groove 138 of the lower<br>
yoke 106. The inner leg plates 152 form vertical multi-step lap joints with the plates 114,<br>
116 of the upper and lower yokes 104,106, as will be described further below. The inner<br>
leg plates 152 may all have the same length if the joints are offset by vertically shifting the<br>
inner leg plates 152. Alternately, the inner ieg plates 152 may have a plurality of different<br>
lengths if the joints are offset by the different lengths of adjacent inner leg plates 152.<br>
Each of the inner leg plates 152 has a unitary construction and is trapezoidal in shape. In<br>
each of the inner leg plates, opposing ends of the inner leg plate 152 are mitered at<br>
oppositely-directed angles of about 45°, thereby providing the inner leg plate with major<br>
7<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
and minor side edges. The lengths of the inner leg plates 152 are determined by the major<br>
side edges. Each of the inner leg plates 152 is composed of grain-oriented silicon steel<br>
and has a thickness in a range of from about 7 mils to about 14 mils, with the particular<br>
thickness being selected based on the application of the transformer 100.<br>
[0027]	Referring now to Fig. 4 there is shown an enlarged view of a portion of the<br>
lower end ofthe inner leg 112 spaced from the loweryoke 106. When the lower end of the<br>
inner leg 112 is disposed in the lower groove 138, the ends of first, second, third and fourth<br>
inner leg plates 152a, b, c, d of the first and second stacks 150,154 abut (form joints with)<br>
the lower interior edges 130a, b, c, d of first, second, third and fourth plates 116a, b, c, d of<br>
the loweryoke 106, respectively. In each of the first and second stacks 150,154, the first<br>
through fourth inner leg plates 152a-d are vertically offset such that lower ends thereof are<br>
located successively farther downward. In order to accommodate these differences in<br>
length, the Iower interior edges 130a-d of the- plates 116a d are cut successively deeper.<br>
With this construction, the first plate 116a overlaps the joints between the second inner leg<br>
plates 152b and the second plate 116b, the second plate 116b overlaps the joints between<br>
the third inner leg plates 152c and the third plate 116c, and the third plate 116c overlaps<br>
the joints between the fourth inner leg plates 152d and the fourth plate 116d. Although not<br>
shown, additional groups ofthe plates 116 and inner leg plates 152 are provided and<br>
repeat the pattern of the first through fourth plates 152a-d and the first through fourth<br>
plates 116a-116d. In this manner, multi-step lap joints are formed between the plates 116<br>
ofthe loweryoke 106 and the inner leg plates 152 ofthe first and second stacks 150,154,<br>
with plates 116 of the lower yoke 106 overlapping plates 152 of the first and second stacks<br>
150, 154.<br>
[0028]	Since the lower ends ofthe first through fourth inner leg plates 152a-d ofthe<br>
first and second stacks 150,154 are located successively farther downward-, upper ends of<br>
the first through fourth inner leg plates 152a-d of the first and second stacks 150,154 are<br>
located successively farther downward. As a result, the upper interior edges 126 (and,<br>
thus, the upper notches 124) of the plates 114 within each group are successively<br>
shallower, which is the inverse of the loweryoke 106. With this construction, vertical multi-<br>
step lap joints are formed between the plates 114 ofthe upper yoke 104 and the first inner<br>

leg .plates 152 of the first and second stacks 150, 154, with inner leg plates 152<br>
overlapping plates 114 of the upper yoke.<br>
[0029]	It should be appreciated that the inner leg plates 152 of the first and second<br>
slacks 150, 154 may be offset differently so as to have plates 114 of the upper yoke 104<br>
overlapping inner leg plates 152, and inner leg plates 152 overlapping plates 116 of the<br>
lower yoke 106. In addition, the inner leg plates 152 of the first and second stacks 150,154<br>
may be offset to form a seven or other number step lap joint pattern, instead of the four<br>
step lap joint pattern.<br>
[0030]	In the embodiment where the inner leg plates 152 have different lengths,<br>
such as four different lengths, vertical multi-step lap joints are formed between the plates<br>
114, 116 of the upper and lower yokes 104, 106 in a manner similar to that described<br>
above, however, the upper interior edges 126 (and thus the upper notches 124) of the<br>
plates 114 of the upper yoke 104 may have the same arrangement as the lower Interior<br>
edges 130 (and thus the lower notches 128) of the plates 116 of the lower yoke 106 with<br>
regard to depth, because there is no vertical shifting of the inner leg plates 152.<br>
[0031]	Referring now to Fin. 5, the inner leg plates 152 are formed from one or more<br>
pieces of steel 160, which are typically received from a supplier in one or more rolls 162.<br>
The steel piece(s) 160 in the roll(s) 162 is/are unrolled and cut by a cutting machine (not<br>
shown), which is operable to make two or more cuts simultaneously. !n the description<br>
below, the cutting machine is operable to make two cuts simultaneously. The cuts are<br>
made at oppositely directed angles of about 45 °and are separated so as to form an inner<br>
leg plate 152 with a length of L1, i.e., a major side length of L1. Fig. 5 shows a portion of a<br>
steel piece 160 that has been unwound from its roll 162 and is being cut by the cutting<br>
machine. The cutting machine makes a first cut 168 and a second cut 170 in the steel<br>
piece 160 simultaneously. The first and second cuts 168, 170 form a first inner leg plate<br>
152a and a scrap piece 172, which is discarded. The steel piece 160 is then further<br>
unwound and advanced (relative to the cutting machine) by the distance L1. The cutting<br>
machine makes a third cut 174 and a fourth cut 176 in the steel piece 160 simultaneously.<br>
The third and fourth cuts 174,176 form a second inner leg plate 152b and. a third inner leg<br>
plate 152c. This procedure of unwinding, advancing and cutting is continued until the<br>
9<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
required number of inner leg plates 152 is formed.<br>
[0032]	In the description of the cutting of the inner leg plates set forth above, the<br>
inner.leg plates 152 ai! have the same length L1. If the inner leg plates 152 are provided<br>
with different lengths, such as L1-L4, the requisite number of inner leg plates 152 with the<br>
length L1 may be cut first. The cutting machine may then be reconfigured to change the<br>
spacing of the cuts and the advancement distance of the steel piece 160 so as to produce<br>
plates having a length L2. The requisite number of inner leg plates with L2 may then be<br>
cut. In a similar manner, the cutting machine is reconfigured and run to produce the<br>
requisite number of inner leg plates 152 with lengths L.3 and L4.<br>
[0033]	The method of assembling the core 102 is dependent on the size of the core<br>
102. If the core 102 is large, such as would be the case if the transformer 100 was greater<br>
than 3000 kva, the core 102 is assembled with the lower yoke 106, the inner leg 112 and<br>
the first and second outer legs 108, 110 initially being disposed horizontally, i.e., the lower<br>
yoke 106, the inner leg 112 and the first and second outer legs 108, 110 are stacked in a<br>
vertical direction. In such a case the core 102 is assembled on a mounting fixture in a<br>
plurality of layers. In a first layer, a group of plates 116 is laid on the mounting fixture, with<br>
the major side edges disposed outwardly. Next, a group of plates 120 and a group of plates<br>
122 are laid on the mounting fixture, with their major side edges disposed outwardly and<br>
their ends abutting the ends of the group of plates 116,respectively, to form multi-step lap<br>
joints. First and second groups of offset inner leg plates 152 are-then laid on the mounting<br>
fixture, with the major side edges of the inner leg plates 152 of the first group abutting the<br>
major side edges of the inner leg plates 152 of the second group, and the ends of the inner<br>
leg plates 152 of the first and second groups abutting opposing portions of the lower<br>
interior edges 130 of the plates 11*6, respectively, to form two series of multi-step vertical<br>
lap joints, respectively. This laying process is repeated for each layer until a desired<br>
stacking configuration is achieved. Once the lower yoke 106, the inner leg 112 and the first<br>
and second outer legs 108, 110 have been formed, the lower yoke 106 is clamped<br>
between a pair of end frames or supports 177 and bands 178 are disposed around the<br>
inner leg 112 and the first and second outer legs 108,110, respectively, as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
The partially formed core 102 is then moved to an upright position so that the inner leg<br>
10<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
112 and the first and second outer legs 108,110 extend vertically. Coil windings 180 are<br>
then disposed over the inner leg 112 and the first and second outer legs 108, 110,<br>
respectively. The upper yoke 104 is then stacked in groups of plates 114 onto the ends of<br>
the inner leg 112 and the first and second outer legs 108, 110.<br>
[0034]	If the core 102 is smaller, such as would be the case if the transformer 100<br>
was less than 3000 kva, the core 102 is assembled in a similar manner as described<br>
above, except the core 102 is formed while being disposed vertically, i.e., the components<br>
of the core 102 are stacked in a horizontal direction.<br>
[0035]	After the core 102 with the coil windings 180 is fully constructed, the core 102<br>
is enclosed within a housing (not shown). If the transformer 100 is an oil-filled type of<br>
transformer, the core 102 is immersed in oil within a compartment in the housing. If the<br>
transformer 100 is a dry-type of transformer, the core 102 is not immersed in oil and tho<br>
housing is provided with louvers to permit air to enter the housing snd pass-ovor Uio core<br>
102 and the coil windings 180.<br>
[0036]	Although the assembly of the core 102 set forth above describes, three coil<br>
windings 180 being mounted to the core 102, such as occurs when the transformer 100 is<br>
a three-phase transformer, it should be appreciated that in another embodiment, a single<br>
coil winding 180 may be mounted to the inner ieg 112 of the core 102, such as occurs<br>
when the transformer 100 is a single phase transformer. In another embodiment, three<br>
inner legs 190 may be provided, wherein the coil windings 180 are mounted to the inner<br>
legs 190, respectively. In such a case, three upper grooves 136 would be formed in the<br>
upper yoke 104 and three lower grooves 138 would be formed in the lower yoke 106. In<br>
addition, four windows 113 would be formed.<br>
[0037]	Referring now to Fig. 7, there is shown a core 184 embodied in accordance<br>
with a second embodiment of the present invention. The core 184 has substantially the<br>
same construction as the core 102, except for the differences set forth below. The core 184<br>
comprises upper and lower yokes 186, 188 an inner leg 190 and first and second outer<br>
Iegs192,194. The inner leg 190 comprises a first stack 196 of inner leg plates 198anda<br>
second stack 200 of inner leg plates 198. The first and second stacks 196, 200 abut each<br>
other along a seam 202 that extends in the longitudinal direction of the inner leg 190. Each<br>
11<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
of the upper and lower yokes 186, 188 the inner leg 190 and the first and second outer<br>
legs 192, 194 has a cruciform cross-section, instead of a rectangular cross-section, as in<br>
the core 102. The cruciform cross-sections of these components increase the strength of<br>
the core 184 and provide the inner leg 190 and the first and second outer legs 192, 194<br>
with larger surface areas for supporting coils. The cruciform cross-sections of the<br>
components of the core 184 are formed by providing the constituent plates of the<br>
components with different widths. For example, and with reference now to Fig. 8, sections<br>
204a,b,c,d,e,f,g of the inner leg plates 198 first successively increase in width and, then<br>
after the midpoint, successively decrease in width. The sections 204a,b,c,d,e,f,g each<br>
comprise one or more groups of inner leg plates 198. Thus, the outermost inner leg plates<br>
198 in sections 204a and 204g each have a width W1, which is the smallest of the widths<br>
of the inner leg plates 198, and the. inner log plates 198 in the middle section 204d each<br>
have a width Wn, which is the larqest of the widths of the inner leg plates 198 in each of<br>
first and second stacks 196, 200, the major side edges of the inner leg plates 198 are<br>
aligned at the seam 202. The different widths, however, cause the minor.sides to be offset,<br>
which helps form the cruciform cross-section of the inner leg .190. The thickness of the<br>
sections 204a-g in the stacking direction may vary. For example, as shown, the center<br>
section 204d may be substantially thicker than the other sections 204a,b,c,e,f,g.<br>
[0038]	The components of the core 184 are cut and assembled in substantially the<br>
same manner as the components of the core 102, except for each component, a plurality<br>
of steel pieces with different widths (configured in a plurality of rolls) are cut to form the<br>
constituent plates of varying width.<br>
[0039]	Referring now to Fig. 9, there is shown a core 210 embodied in accordance<br>
with a third embodiment of the present invention. The core 210 has substantially the same<br>
construction and is constructed in substantially the same manner as the core 102, except<br>
for the differences set forth below. The core 210 comprises upper and lower yokes 212,<br>
214, an inner leg 216 and first and second outer legs 218, 220. Like the inner leg 112 of<br>
the core 102, the inner leg 216 is comprised of a pair of stacks of plates. Unlike the upper<br>
and lower yokes 104,106 in the core 102, however, the upper and lower yokes 212,214 of<br>
the core 210 are comprised of a plurality of stacks of plates. The upper and lower yokes<br>
12<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
212, 214 are constructed in a similar manner and, thus, for purposes of brevity only the<br>
-lower yoke 212 will be described.<br>
[0040] . The lower yoke 214 of the core 210 comprises an outer stack 224 of first<br>
plates 226, a first inner stack 228 of second plates 230 and a second inner stack 232 of<br>
second plates 230. As with the lower yoke 106 of the core 102, the outer stack 224 and the<br>
first and second inner stacks 228, 232 are arranged in groups of plates to form multi-step<br>
lap joints. More specifically, within each group of the second plates 230 of the first and<br>
second inner stacks 228, 232, the inner ends of the second plates 230 are offset, either by<br>
shifting the second plates 230, or by providing the. second plates 230 with different lengths.<br>
The groups in the first and second inner stacks 228, 232 are arranged in the same manner<br>
and are aligned so as to form pairs of corresponding second plates 230 (from the first and<br>
second inner stacks 228, 232 respectively). Each of the first plates 226 is unitary in<br>
structure and has an elongated trapezoidal shape, with major and minor side edges. The<br>
first plates 226 have opposing ends that form multi-step lap joints with plates of the first<br>
and second outer legs 218, 220, respectively. A portion of the first plates 226 have V-<br>
shaped notches 234 formed therein. The second plates 230. each have major and minor<br>
side edges and outer mitered ends. The first and second inner stacks 228, 232 are<br>
disposed on the outer stack 224 such that the major side edges of the second plates 230<br>
are disposed against the minor side edges of the first plates 226. The first and second<br>
inner stacks 228, 232 abut the outer stack 224 along a pair of seams 236, respectively,<br>
that extend in the longitudinal direction of the outer stack 224. The first and second plates<br>
226, 230 all have the same width and, thus, may be formed from the same piece of steel.<br>
[0041]	Referring now to Fig. 10, in each layer of the lower yoke 214, a V-shaped<br>
notch 238 is at least partially formed by inner ends of a pair of corresponding second<br>
plates 230 (from the first and second inner stacks 228, 232 respectively). In a first pair of<br>
corresponding second plates 230a, the second plates 230a have mitered inner ends that<br>
abut at a lower point, thereby forming a notch 238a. In a second pair of corresponding<br>
second plates 230b, inner ends of second plates 230b are separated by a spacing that<br>
cooperates with a notch 234b in a corresponding first plate 226b to form a notch 238b. In<br>
the remaining pairs of corresponding second plates 230, the inner ends of the second<br>
13'<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
plates 230 are also spaced apart and cooperate with notches 234 in the first plates 226 to<br>
form notches 238. In this manner, a vertical series of multi-step V-shaped inner edges 240<br>
(and, thus, the notches 238) is formed. In subsequent pairs of groups, the pattern repeats<br>
with the first pair of corresponding second plates 230 having abutting inner ends and the<br>
subsequent pairs of corresponding second plates 230 having spaced-apart inner ends. The<br>
inner edges 240 form multi-step vertical lap joints with lower ends of the inner leg plates of<br>
the inner leg.<br>
[0042]	The first and second outer legs 218, 220 may each be comprised of a single<br>
stack of plates, as in the core 102, or the first and second outer legs 218, 220 of the core<br>
210 may each be comprised of a plurality of stacks of plates, as is shown in Fig. 9. The first<br>
and second out legs 218, 220 are constructed in a similar manner and, thus, for purposes<br>
of brevity, only the first outer leg. 218 will be described.<br>
[0043]	The first outer leg 218 comprise a first stack 244 of leg plates 246 and a<br>
second stack 248 of leg plates 246. The first and second stacks 244, 248 abut each other<br>
along a seam 250 that extends in the longitudinal direction of the first outer leg 218. In<br>
both the first and second stacks 244, 248, the lea plates 246 are arranged in groups. The<br>
leg plates 246 each have a unitary construction and are trapezoidal in shape. The leg<br>
plates 246 in the first stack 244 have the same width as the leg plates 246 in the second<br>
stack 248. in each of the ieg piates 246, opposing ends of the leg plate 246 are mitered at<br>
oppositely-directed angles of about 45°, thereby providing the leg plate 246 with major and<br>
minor side edges. The first and second stacks 244, 248 abut each other such that the<br>
major side edges of the leg plates 246 of the second stack 248 are disposed against the<br>
minor side edges of the leg plates 246 of the first stack 24.4. In both the first and second<br>
stacks 244, 248, the lengths within each group of ieg plates 246 are different to permit the<br>
formation of multi-step lap joints with the plates of the upper and lower yokes 212, 214.<br>
The leg plates 246 in the first stack 244 may be formed from the same piece of steel as the<br>
leg plates 246 in the second stack 248.<br>
[0044]	A transformer core embodied in accordance with the present invention<br>
provides a number of benefits over conventional transformer cores. The construction of an<br>
inner leg of a core in a pair of stacks reduces the amount of steel that is cut away and<br>
14<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/105026	PCT/US2006/011122<br>
discarded. For example, assuming that a layer of an inner leg is formed from one piece of<br>
rectangular steel, only two pieces of steel have to be discarded if the inner leg has two<br>
stacks, while six pieces of steel have to be discarded if the inner leg has only one stack.<br>
Of course, this savings increases when more than one layer is formed from a piece of<br>
steel, which is typically the case.<br>
[0045]	In addition to saving steel, the present invention also permits a core to be<br>
manufactured in sizes larger than the cutting machine and/or the steel pieces would<br>
otherwise permit. For example, assuming that the cutting machine can only cut a 16 inch<br>
wide piece of steel, or only a 16 inch wide piece of steel is available, the present invention<br>
permits a 32 inch wide inner leg (or other core component) to be constructed.<br>
[0046]	While the invention has been shown and described with respect to<br>
particular embodiments thereof, those embodiments are for the purpose of illustration<br>
rather than limitation,and other variations end modifications of the specific-<br>
