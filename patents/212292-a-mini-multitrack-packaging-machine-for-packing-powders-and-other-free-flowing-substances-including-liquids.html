heat sealing the said end to form a pouch and<br>
passing the pouch to punch and dies means to give the desired<br>
contour.<br>
The instant invention will now be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a schematic overview of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the means for unwinding<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the splitting means<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the pulling means<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the sealing means<br>
Figure 6a to 6d illustrates alternate embodiments for the filling means<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the punch and die means<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a Programmable Logic Controller<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the unwinding means (1) for unwinding the roll of<br>
plastic/ laminate is connected to pulling means (2). The pulling means (1)<br>
pulls the film/laminate to the front of the machine from the unwinding<br>
means. The filling means (4) is connected the sealing means (3) to seals the<br>
sides of the laminate and also to the punch and die means (5). The control of<br>
this machine is connected to an electronic means having sufficient<br>
input/output capacity is provided for controlling the various operations of<br>
the system.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the unwinding means. The unwinding means comprises a<br>
reel shaft (7) mounted on the unwinding frame (8) at the back of the<br>
machine. The roll of film/laminate (6) is loaded onto the Reel shaft (7). The<br>
Unwinding Frame (8) also contains Braking means (9) for applying brakes<br>
on moving Reel Shaft (7) in order to maintain a uniform speed of the film.<br>
Dancing Roller means (10) is also provided in the unwinding means for<br>
ensuring uniform tension in the moving film which is connected to the<br>
braking means (9). The Reel Shaft (7) rotates freely on bearings (not shown)<br>
mounted on the sides of Unwinding Frame (8). As the film moves, the<br>
Dancing Roller means also moves which in turn is connected to the braking<br>
means. As the web tension of the film/ laminate reduces the Dancing Roller<br>
means makes the braking means operate. The brakes applied on Reel Shaft<br>
reduce the unwinding speed of the film roll resulting in increased tension in<br>
film. This ensures uniform tension in the film essential for smooth pouch<br>
formation.<br>
In Figure 3, the means for splitting the laminate/film in two equal parts comprises<br>
a turn bar (13) having a sharp edge splitter (13") at its center for splitting the<br>
laminate/film and aluminum rollers (13") for rolling the split film/laminate.<br>
In Figure 4 the pulling means have a plurality of silicon rubber rollers (11).<br>
These rollers are driven by Electromagnetic Clutch and Break means (12).<br>
The film passes through various aluminum alloy rollers<br>
In Figure 5, the sealing means comprises a plurality of vertical sealers (14)<br>
and horizontal sealers(16) which are mounted on the Sealing Plate (15) and<br>
horizontal sealers (16). The vertical sealers are provided with pencil heaters.<br>
Horizontal sealers are provided with cartridge heaters to heat mem. Between<br>
the horizontal sealing means, perforation blade (16") is provided for<br>
perforation and batch cutting of pouches. The Sealing means moves<br>
intermittently through two Levers (18). The lever movement is controlled<br>
through a Cam (19) and motorized drive. As per the cam contour the levers<br>
bring the sealing jaws closer so as to meet together under pressure for a<br>
particular time required for sufficient sealing. The pouch so formed is then<br>
filled with product through a filling system and released from the machine.<br>
In Figure 6a, the rotary disc adjustable filling means comprises rotary discs<br>
on a plate (20). The discs (24) consists of volumetric cups (21) for<br>
determining the amount of product to be packed. On the upper side of the<br>
rotary disc, a feeding hopper (22) is provided to feed the desired product and<br>
at its lower side a funnel (23) is provided to directing the product into the<br>
pouch.<br>
In Figure 6b, the rotary valve adjustable filling means comprises a feeding<br>
hopper (26) mounted on the main rotary valve (25). The lower end of the<br>
rotary valve has a number of volumetric pockets (27) for filling pouches.<br>
The product gets filled inside the pockets. On rotation, material which is<br>
filled inside the pockets gets deposited in the feeding funnels. The number of<br>
pockets on the valve spool and valve depends upon the number of tracks on<br>
the machine. This filling system is suitable for free flowing products such as<br>
tea, sugar, mourn refresher pan masala etc.<br>
In Figure 6c, the sliding plate filling means comprises of a set of horizontal<br>
plates (28) and a special hopper (29) is mounted over it. This hopper (29)<br>
may have more than one compartments (not shown) for filling different<br>
types of product at the same time. These products gets filled in volumetric<br>
cups (30) mounted on said plate. The plate may be a stainless steel plate.<br>
The top plate of the said plates contains at least two sets volumetric cups. As<br>
the mechanism operates, the plate reciprocates between two extreme<br>
positions. When one set of cups is being filled through one leg of the hopper,<br>
the other set of cups drops the product into the feeding funnels. The position<br>
is changed in next cycle when the filled cups comes in the centre and drops<br>
material while the earlier set of cups gets filled in another arm of the hopper.<br>
Cup volume can be changed by increasing/ decreasing the bore diameter.<br>
Adjustable plates can also be made by moving the fixed plates up and down.<br>
Fixed plate is having a acrylic covering for smooth movement. Special<br>
separators are provided in the hoppers to avoid product mixing.<br>
In Figure 6d liquid filling means comprises hopper (33), filling tubes (34),<br>
Valve (35), valve body (36), mechanical cylinders (37) and piston (38).<br>
Individual eccentric slide (39) are provided with each cylinder (37). A piston<br>
(38) is used to adjust volume to be filled in each pouch. Number of cylinder,<br>
piston and slide will depend on number of tracks on the machine.<br>
The required volume of material is sucked through valve into the cylinder<br>
and delivered to the filling tube again through valve. Product to be packed is<br>
stored in hopper (33 ) installed at the top of rotary valve (35). The rotary<br>
valve is actuated through a pneumatic cylinder (40) which is connected to a<br>
solenoid valve. Solenoid valve gets signal from proximity switch mounted<br>
on the cam. Piston in the mechanical cylinder moves mechanically through<br>
individual eccentric slide mechanism (39) connected to the main drive of the<br>
machine. The cycle consists of suction and delivery strokes.<br>
This system is used to pack free flowing liquids viz. shampoo, oil etc.<br>
Figure 7 the punch and die means comprises a set of punches and dies,<br>
depending on the number of tracks on the machine. The designs of punch<br>
(41) and die (42) depends on the shape contour to be punched on the pouch.<br>
Punch can be pneumatically or mechanically operated through a mechanism<br>
connected to the machine drive. Punching is done intermittently after the<br>
vertical sealing is completed. Alignment of punch and die is of prime<br>
importance.<br>
Once the film is secured in between sealing jaws, punch becomes<br>
operational to get a clean cut of the shape designed. Once punching is<br>
completed and punches are withdrawn, film is allowed to move further. Off<br>
cuts of the punched area can be removed pneumatically.<br>
A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) having sufficient input/output<br>
(I/O) capacity is used to control various machine operations. Input signals<br>
are received from various proximity sensors mounted on cams, photocell etc.<br>
while output signals are fed to solenoid coil, clutch/brake etc. Logic is<br>
programmed in advance and stored in the PLC.<br>
A suitable operator interface comprising of a screen display mounted on<br>
instrument panel is used to display various faults and parameters.<br>
Adjustments are possible on the screen itself. It is capable to display<br>
parameters like speed, batch cutting timing, number of pouches produced<br>
etc. Faults like low level of hopper, gears open etc. can be shown along with<br>
buzzer warning sound.<br>
According to the present invention the capability and efficiency of Form,<br>
Fill and Seal Packaging Machines will be improved significantly.<br>
