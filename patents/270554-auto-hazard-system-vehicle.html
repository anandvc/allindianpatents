The following specification describes the invention.<br><br>
COMPLETE<br>
The following specification, particularly descnbes-llieinvention and the manner in which it is to be formed.<br><br>
1<br><br>
Title<br>
Auto hazard system for vehicle<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of motor vehicles and<br>
more particularly, to a system for automatically controlling all<br>
hazard indication systems (lights, a voice messaging system,<br>
etc.) on a motor vehicle so as to avoid motor vehicle accidents.<br>
Prior art<br>
To   the   best   of  the   knowledge   of  applicant,   no   prior  art<br>
references are available releavent to the present invention.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The objective of this invention is to provide additional safety to<br>
the upcoming or to following vehicles with help of a system for<br>
switching ON all the lamps and a voice messaging system<br>
connected to the hazard system.<br>
Further to provide a system which indicate a hazrdous situation<br>
like<br>
1)	Night time if the vehicle speed is zero and bonnet is open<br>
2)	In a moving vehicle, one or any of the doors or bonnet is open<br>
3)	If sudden braking is applied<br>
Futher more objective is to provide a system for automatically<br>
controlling the hazard lights and a voice messaging system of a<br>
motor vehicle under said conditions<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The   prsesnt   invention   comprises   auto   hazard   system   for<br>
vehicle.<br>
2<br><br>
System for switching ON all the lamps and a voice messaging system connected to the auto hazard system under any of the following conditions<br>
1)	Night time if the vehicle speed is zero and bonnet is open<br>
2)	In a moving vehicle, one or any of the doors or bonnet is open<br>
3)	If sudden braking is applied<br>
The system according to the present invention comprises ECU (Electronic Controller Unit), various doors switches viz. hazard switch, vehicle speed sensor, parking lamp, brake switch, and various signal lamps provided on the vehicle. All the above said switches are connected to ECU to its input port. All lamps are connected to out put port of ECU. On receiving signals form all or any one of switches ECU sends signals to all connected lamps and lamps start blinking giving hazard signal to the personnel present in the surroundings. Description of figures:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of an auto hazard system for the automobile vehicle. Description of the embodiments<br>
The foregoing objects of the invention are accomplished and the problems and shortcomings associated with prior art techniques and approaches are overcome by the present invention as described bellow in the preferred embodiment. This invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, through out which like reference letters indicate corresponding parts in the various figures.<br>
According to the present invention hazard indication system for automobile vehicles comprises of   driver door switch (1), co-<br>
3<br><br>
driver door switch (2), rear RH door switch (3), rear LH door switch (4), tail gate door switch (5), bonnet switch (6), vehicle speed sensor (7), park lamp (8), hazard switch (9), brake switch (15) hazard indicating lamps (16), viz. front turn signal lamp (RH &amp; LH) (ll),side turn signal lamp (RH &amp; LH) (12), rear turn signal lamp (RH &amp; LH) (13), turn signal lamp inside instrument clusture (RH &amp; LH) (14); ECU (electronic controller unit) (10). All the said switches send siglnal to ECU in case their position is changed. The ECU on receipt of these signals switches on the hazard lamps (11), (12), (13) and (14) which flash on switching on. Said hazard lamps receive signals from ECU (10) by an electrical connection.<br>
The ECU used for the auto hazard system is intergal part of the ECU of the automobile vehicle. Driver door switch (1) is provided on driver door as separate switch or inbuilt in the latch. Co-driver door switch (2) is provided on the co driver door as separate switch or inbuilt in the latch. Rear (right hand) RH door switch (3) is provided on the rear RH door as separate switch or inbuilt in the latch Rear LH (left hand) door switch (4) is provided on the rear LH door as separate switch or inbuilt in the latch. Tail gate door switch (5) Bonnet switch (6) is provided on the bonnet as separate switch or inbuilt in the lock mechanism. For park lamp (15) light sensor is provided. Lamps used in the auto hazard system are normal signal lamps provided on the vehicle.<br>
Auto Hazard system is provided with inbuilt manual over ride, enabling the user to disable the auto hazard function .If the hazard switch is switched ON and OFF within pre described<br>
4<br><br>
time, auto hazard function will, get disabled. This feature is to have the flexibility to the user.<br>
It is also possible to connect the same directly to a voice messaging system if this feature is provided in the vehicle.<br>
Operation and function<br>
The enclosed block diagram shows an auto hazard system of<br>
the vehicle.<br>
Auto  hazard  system  will  start working  under the following<br>
conditions:<br>
1). If the park lamp is ON for less than few seconds OR if the<br>
light sensor detects low illumination AND vehicle speed is zero<br>
AND bonnet is open     the bonnet switch, light sensor, park<br>
lamp gives the signal to ECU and on receiving these signal ECU<br>
sends the signal to the all connected hazard lamps and all<br>
hazard lamps (16) start blinking.<br>
2)	In a moving vehicle, if any of the doors OR bonnet is open,<br>
the door switch OR bonnet switch will give signal to ECU and on<br>
receiving this signal, ECU sends the signal to the all connected<br>
lamps and all connected lamps start blinking.<br>
3)	If the de-acceleration of the vehicle is more than the<br>
specified limits, vehicle speed sensor switch will send signal to<br>
ECU and on receiving this signal, ECU sends the signal to the<br>
all connected lamps and all connected lamps start blinking.<br>
4)	In all the cases, manual over ride by switching ON and OFF, hazard switch, the auto hazard function will get disable.<br>
5)	Normal working of hazard switch and lamps connected to the same will remain as it is.<br>
5<br><br>
The ECU can be used as data storage device as well for all such conditions. This data can be used for any kind of analysis later on.<br>
The stored parameter information can be accessed via a data interface such as a data port or a RF interface.<br>
The foregoing objects of the invention are accomplished and the problems and shortcomings associated with prior art techniques and approaches are overcome by the present invention described in the present embodiment.<br>
Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein; however, it is to be understood that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or matter.<br>
The embodiments of the invention as described above and the methods disclosed herein will suggest further modification and alterations to those skilled in the art. Such further modifications and alterations may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
