FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel antigen-binding polypeptides comprising at least one non-naturally-encoded amino acid. The present invention relates generally to the field of the production and selection of antigen-binding polypeptides by the methods of molecular biology, using both chemistry and recombinant DNA.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[01]	A naturally produced antibody (Ab) is a tetrameric structure consisting of two<br>
identical immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains and two identical light chains. The heavy and light chains of an Ab consist of different domains. Each light chain has one variable domain (VL) and one constant domain (CL), while each heavy chain has one variable domain (VH) and three or four constant domains (CH). Each domain, consisting of about 110 amino acid residues, is folded into a characteristic (3-sandwich structure formed from two P-sheets packed against each other, the immunoglobulin fold. The VL domains each have three complementarity determining regions (CDR1-3) and the VH domains each have up to four complementarity determining regions (CDR1-4), that are loops, or turns, connecting P-strands at one end of the domains. The variable regions of both the light and heavy chains generally contribute to antigen specificity, although the contribution of the individual chains to specificity is not necessarily equal. Antibody molecules have evolved to bind to a large number of molecules by using randomized CDR loops.<br>
[02]	Functional substructures of Abs can be prepared by proteolysis and by<br>
recombinant methods. They include the Fab fragment, which comprises the VH-CHI<br><br>
domains of the heavy chain and the VL-CL1 domains of the light chain joined by a single interchain disulfide bond, and the Fv fragment, which comprises only the VH and VL domains, and the Fc portion which comprises the non-antigen binding region of the molecule. In some cases, a single VH domain retains significant affinity for antigen (Ward et al., 1989, Nature 341, 554-546). It has also been shown that a certain monomeric K light chain will specifically bind to its antigen. (L. Masat et al., 1994, PNAS 91:893-896). Separated light or heavy chains have sometimes been found to retain some antigen-binding activity as well (Ward et al., 1989, Nature 341, 554-546).<br>
[03]	Another functional substructure is a single chain Fv (scFv), comprised of the<br>
variable regions of the rmmunoglobulin heavy and light chain, covalently connected by a<br>
peptide linker (S-z Hu et al., 1996, Cancer Research, 56, 3055-3061), These small (Mr<br>
25,000) proteins generally retain specificity and affinity for antigen in a single polypeptide<br>
and can provide a convenient building block for larger, antigen-specific molecules. The short<br>
half-life of scFvs in the circulation limits their therapeutic utility in many cases.<br>
[04]	A small protein scaffold called a "minibody" was designed using a part of the<br>
Ig  VH domain as the template (Pessi et al., 1993, Nature 362, 367-369).   Minibodies with<br>
high affinity (dissociation constant (Kd) about 10"7 M) to interleuTrin-6 were identified by<br>
randomizing loops corresponding to CDR1 and CDR2 of VH and then selecting mutants<br>
using the phage display method (Martin et al, 1994, EMBO J. 13, 5303-5309).<br>
[05]	Camels often lack variable light chain domains when IgG-like material from<br>
their serum is analyzed, suggesting that sufficient antibody specificity and affinity can be derived from VH domains (three or four CDR loops) alone. "Camelized" VH domains with high affinity have been made, and high specificity can be generated by randomizing only the CDR3.<br>
[06]	An alternative to the "minibody" is the "diabody." Diabodies are small<br>
bivalent and bispecific antibody fragments, having two antigen-binding sites. The fragments comprise a heavy-chain variable domain (VH) connected to a light-chain variable domain (VL) on the same polypeptide chain (VH -VL). Diabodies are similar in size to the Fab fragment. By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. These dimeric antibody fragments, or "diabodies," are bivalent and bispecific. See, P. Holliger et al, PNAS 90:6444-6448 (1993).<br><br>
[07]	CDR peptides and organic CDR mimetics have been made (Dougall et al., <br>
1994, Trends Biotechnol. 12, 372-379). CDR peptides are short, typically cyclic, peptides<br>
which correspond to the amino acid sequences of CDR loops of antibodies, CDR loops are<br>
responsible for antibody-antigen interactions. CDR peptides and organic CDR mimetics have<br>
been shown to retain some binding affinity (Smyth &amp; von Itzstein, 1994, J. Am. Chem. Soc.<br>
116, 2725-2733). Mouse CDRs have been grafted onto the human Ig framework without the<br>
loss of affinity (Jones et al, 1986, Nature 321, 522-525; Riechmann et al., 1988).<br>
[08]	In the body, specific Abs are selected and amplified from a large library<br>
(affinity maturation). The processes can be reproduced in vitro using combinatorial library technologies. The successful display of Ab fragments on the surface of bacteriophage has made it possible to generate and screen a vast number of CDR mutations (McCafferty et al., 1990, Nature 348, 552-554; Barbas et al., 1991, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 88,7978-7982; Winter et al., 1994, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12, 433-455). An increasing number of Fabs and Fvs (and their derivatives) are produced by this technique. The combinatorial technique can be combined with Ab mimics.<br>
[09]	A number of protein domains that could potentially serve as protein scaffolds<br>
have been expressed as fusions with phage capsid proteins. Review in Clackson &amp; Wells, Trends Biotechnol. 12:173-184 (1994). Several of these protein domains have already been used as scaffolds for displaying random peptide sequences, including bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Roberts et al., PNAS 89:2429-2433 (1992)), human growth hormone (Lowman et al., Biochemistry 30:10832-10838 (1991)), Venturini et al., Protein Peptide Letters 1:70-75 (1994)), and the IgG binding domain of Streptococcus ((Weil et al, Techniques in Protein Chemistry V (Crabb, L,. ed.) pp. 517-524, Academic Press, San Diego (1994)), These scaffolds have displayed a single randomized loop or region. Tendamistat has been used as a presentation scaffold on the filamentous phage Ml 3 (McConnell and Hoess, 1995, J. MoL Biol 250:460-470).<br>
[10]	Receptor tyrosine kinases of the ErbB family play pivotal roles in cell growth<br>
and differentiation. Aberrant activation of these receptors is associated with human cancers, Dimerization (the pairing of receptors) is essential to the signaling activity of all ErbB receptors. Blocking the dimerization activity of ErbB2 has been shown to directly inhibit the ability of ErbB2 to dimerize with other ErbB receptor proteins. Inhibiting receptor dimerization prevents the activation of ErbB signaling pathways. An antagonistic molecule that down regulates ErbB signaling could function as an anti-tumor agent.    The ErbB<br><br>
signaling network is currently a major target in the development of anti-tumor drugs. ErbB-1 is a specific receptor for EGF, while ErbB-2 has no known natural ligand, ErbB2 is able to form heterodimers with ErbB-1 upon addition of EGF. ErbB2 also functions as the preferred dimerization partner for the kinase-dead ErbB-3 and for ErbB-4, which are both receptors for the neuregulins. The ErbB signaling network can also be activated in an indirect manner during signaling by cytokines and ligands of G-coupled protein receptors, indicating that it plays a central role in the growth control of many different cell types.<br>
[11]	The proto-oncogene c-erbB-1 encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor.<br>
Its name originates from the viral homolog v-erbB which was isolated from an avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) where it was contained as a fragment of the chicken c-ErbB-1 gene lacking the ammo-terminal ligand-binding domain. Over expression of erbB-1 genes occurs in a wide range of tumors, including squamous carcinomas of various sites and adenocarcinomas. The human c-erbB-1 gene is located in the chromosomal region 7pl4 and 7pl2.<br>
[12]	The ErbB-2 proto-oncogene (also referred to as Neu, EGFR-2 or HER-2) is a<br>
member of the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase family, which also includes EGF<br>
receptor and EGFR-3 (HER-3 or ErbB-3). ErbB-2 encodes a transmembrane receptor-like<br>
glycoprotein of 185 kDa with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Although, ErbB-2 does not<br>
have any known high-affinity ligands, its kinase activity can be activated without ligand by<br>
either over expression or hetero-association with other members of the ErbB family of<br>
receptors. Amplification of the ErbB-2 gene and over expression of its product has been<br>
detected in almost 40% of primary human breast tumors. EibB-2 over expression is also<br>
observed in ovarian, gastric, salivary and non-small cell lung carcinomas. ErbB-2 is<br>
activated by the neuregulins in heterodimers with the neuregulin receptors ErbB- 3 and ErbB-<br>
4. The humanized anti-ErbB-2 monoclonal antibody Herceptin (from monoclonal 4D5) has<br>
received FDA approval for treatment of cancers that over express ErbB-2. Another anti-<br>
ErbB2 antibody in development is Pertuzumab (from monoclonal 2C4). Specific inhibitors<br>
of the tyrosine kinase activity of ErbB-1 (EGF receptor) are also in clinical trials.<br>

[14]	Covalent  attachment  of the  hydrophilic  polymer  poly(ethylene  glycol),<br>
abbreviated PEG, is a method of increasing water solubility, bioavailability, increasing serum half-life, increasing therapeutic half-life, modulating immunogenicity, modulating biological activity, or extending the circulation time of many biologically active molecules, including proteins, peptides, and particularly hydrophobic molecules. PEG has been used extensively in pharmaceuticals, on artificial implants, and in other applications where biocompatibility, lack of toxicity, and lack of immunogenicity are of importance. In order to maximize the desired properties of PEG, the total molecular weight and hydration state of the PEG polymer or polymers attached to the biologically active molecule must be sufficiently high to impart the advantageous characteristics typically associated with PEG polymer attachment, such as increased water solubility and circulating half life, while not adversely impacting the bioactivity of the parent molecule.<br>
[15]	PEG derivatives are frequently linked to biologically active molecules through<br>
reactive chemical functionalities, such as lysine, cysteine and histidine residues, the N-terminus and carbohydrate moieties. Proteins and other molecules often have a limited number of reactive sites available for polymer attachment Often, the sites most suitable for modification via polymer attachment play a significant role in receptor binding, and are necessary for retention of the biological activity of the molecule. As a result, indiscriminate attachment of polymer chains to such reactive sites on a biologically active molecule often leads to a significant reduction or even total loss of biological activity of the polymer-modified molecule. R. Clark et al., (1996), J. Biol. Chem.. 271:21969-21977. To form conjugates having sufficient polymer molecular weight for imparting the desired advantages to a target molecule, prior art approaches have typically involved random attachment of numerous polymer arms to the molecule, thereby increasing the risk of a reduction or even total loss in bioactivity of the parent molecule.<br>
[16]	Reactive sites that form the loci for attachment of PEG derivatives to proteins<br>
are dictated by the protein's structure. Proteins, including enzymes, are composed of various sequences of alpha-amino acids, which have the general structure H2N--CHR--COOH. The alpha amino moiety (H2N--) of one amino acid joins to the cafboxyl moiety (—COOH) of an adjacent amino acid to form amide linkages, which can be represented as --(NH--CHR--CO)n --, where the subscript "n" can equal hundreds or thousands. The fragment represented by R can contain reactive sites for protein biological activity and for attachment of PEG derivatives.<br><br>
[17]	For example, in the case of the amino acid lysine, there exists an --NH2 moiety<br>
in the epsilon position as well as in the alpha position. The epsilon --NH2 is free for reaction under conditions of basic pH. Much of the art in the field of protein derivatization with PEG has been directed to developing PEG derivatives for attachment to the epsilon --NH2 moiety of lysine residues present in proteins. "Polyethylene Glycol and Derivatives for Advanced PEGylation", Nektar Molecular Engineering Catalog, 2003, pp. 1-17. These PEG derivatives all have the common limitation, however, that they cannot be installed selectively among the often numerous lysine residues present on the surfaces of proteins. This can be a significant limitation in instances where a lysine residue is important to protein activity, existing in an enzyme active site for example, or in cases where a lysine residue plays a role in mediating the interaction of the protein with other biological molecules, as in the case of receptor binding sites.<br>
[18]	A second and equally important complication of existing methods for protein<br>
PEGylation is that the PEG derivatives can undergo undesired side reactions with residues other than those desired. Histidtne contains a reactive imino moiety, represented structurally as --N(H)-- but many chemically reactive species that react with epsilon —NH2 can also react with —N(H)—. Similarly, the side chain of the amino acid cysteine bears a free sulfhydryl group, represented structurally as -SH. In some instances, the PEG derivatives directed at the epsilon --NH2 group of lysine also react with cysteine, histidine or other residues. This can create complex, heterogeneous mixtures of PEG-derivaiized bioactive molecules and risks destroying the activity of the bioactive molecule being targeted. It would be desirable to develop PEG derivatives that permit a chemical functional group to be introduced at a single site within the protein that would then enable the selective coupling of one or more PEG polymers to the bioactive molecule at specific sites on the protein surface that are both well-defined and predictable.<br>
[19]	In addition to lysine residues, considerable effort in the art has been directed<br>
toward the development of activated PEG reagents that target other amino acid side chains, including cysteine, histidine and the N-termmus. See, e.g., U.S. Pat No. 6,610,281 which is incorporated by reference herein, and "Polyetbylene Glycol and Derivatives for Advanced PEGylation", Nektar Molecular Engineering Catalog, 2003, pp. 1-17. A cysteine residue can be introduced site-selectively into the structure of proteins using site-directed mutagenesis and other techniques known in the art, and the resulting free sulfhydryl moiety can be reacted with  PEG  derivatives  that  bear  thiol-reactive  functional   groups.      This   approach  is<br><br>
complicated, however, in that the introduction of a free sulfhydryl group can complicate the expression, folding and stability of the resulting protein. Thus, it would be desirable to have a means to introduce a chemical functional group into bioactive molecules that enables the selective coupling of one or more PEG polymers to the protein while simultaneously being compatible with (i.e., not engaging in undesired side reactions with) sulfhydryls and other chemical functional groups typically found in proteins.<br>
[20]	As can be seen from a sampling of the art, many of these derivatives that have<br>
been developed for attachment to the side chains of proteins, in particular, the - NH2 moiety on the lysine amino acid side chain and the -SH moiety on the cysteine side chain, have proven problematic in their synthesis and use. Some form unstable linkages with the protein that are subject to hydrolysis and therefore decompose, degrade, or are otherwise unstable in aqueous environments, such as in the bloodstream. Some form more stable linkages, but are subject to hydrolysis before the linkage is formed, which means that the reactive group on the PEG derivative may be inactivated before the protein can be attached. Some are somewhat toxic and are therefore less suitable for use in vivo. Some are too slow to react to be practically useful. Some result in a loss of protein activity by attaching to sites responsible for the protein's activity. Some are not specific in the sites to which they will attach, which can also result in a loss of desirable activity and in a lack of reproducibility of results. In order to overcome the challenges associated with modifying proteins with polyethylene glycol) moieties, PEG derivatives have been developed that are more stable (e.g., U.S. Patent 6,602,498, which is incorporated by reference herein) or that react selectively with thiol moieties on molecules and surfaces (e.g., U.S. Patent 6,610,281, which is incorporated by reference herein). There is clearly a need in the art for PEG derivatives that are chemically inert in physiological environments until called upon to react selectively to form stable chemical bonds.<br>
[21]	Recently,  an entirely new technology in the protein sciences has been<br>
reported, which promises to overcome many of the limitations associated with site-specific modifications of proteins. Specifically, new components have been added to the protein biosynthetic machinery of the prokaryote Escherichia coli (E. coli) (e.g., L. Wang, et al., (2001), Science 292:498-500) and the eukaryote Sacchromyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) (e.g., J. Chin et al., Science 301:964-7 (2003)), which has enabled the incorporation of non-genetically encoded amino acids to proteins in vivo. A number of new amino acids with novel  chemical,  physical  or biological  properties,  including photoaffinity  labels  and<br><br>
photoisoinerizable amino acids, keto amino acids, and glycosylated amino acids have been incorporated efficiently and with high fidelity into proteins in E, coli and in yeast in response to the amber codon, TAG, using this methodology. See, e.g., J. W. Chin et al, (2002), Journal of the American Chemical Society 124:9026-9027; J. W. Chin, &amp; P. G. Schultz, (2002), ChemBioChem 11:1135-1137; J. W. Chin, et aL, (2002), PNAS United States of America 99:11020-11024; and, L. Wang, &amp; P. G. Schultz, (2002), Chem. Comnu 1-10. These studies have demonstrated that it is possible to selectively and routinely introduce chemical functional groups, such as ketone groups, alkyne groups and azide moieties, that are not found in proteins, that are chemically inert to all of the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids and that may be used to react efficiently and selectively to form stable covalent linkages.<br>
[22]	The ability to incorporate non-genetically encoded amino acids into proteins<br>
permits the introduction of chemical functional groups that could provide valuable<br>
alternatives to the naturally-occurring functional groups, such as the epsilon -NH2 of lysine,<br>
the sulfhydryl -SH of cysteine, the imino group of histidine, etc. Certain chemical functional<br>
groups are known to be inert to the functional groups found in the 20 common, genetically-<br>
encoded amino acids but react cleanly and efficiently to form stable linkages. Azide and<br>
acetylene groups, for example, are known in the art to undergo a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition<br>
reaction in aqueous conditions in the presence of a catalytic amount of copper. See, e.g.,<br>
Tornoe, et aL, (2002) Ore, Chem, 67:3057-3064; and, Rostovtsev, et aL, (2002) Angew.<br>
Chem. Int. Ed. 41:2596-2599. By introducing an azide moiety into a protein structure, for<br>
example, one is able to incorporate a functional group that is chemically inert to amines,<br>
sulfhydryls, carboxylic acids, hydroxyl groups found in proteins, but that also reacts<br>
smoothly and efficiently with an acetylene moiety to form a cycloaddition product<br>
Importantly, in the absence of the acetylene moiety, the azide remains chemically inert and<br>
unreactive in the presence of other protein side chains and under physiological conditions.<br>
[23]	The present invention addresses, among other things, problems associated<br>
with the activity and production of antigen-binding polypeptides and fragments thereof, and also addresses the production of antigen-binding polypeptides with improved biological or pharmacological properties, such as improved therapeutic half-life.<br><br>

[71]	It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular<br>
methodology, protocols, cell lines, constructs, and reagents described herein and as such may<br>
vary.    It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of<br>
describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present<br>
invention, which will be limited only by the appended claims.<br>
[72]	As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and<br>
"the" include plural reference unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.     Thus, for<br>
example, reference to an "antigen-binding polypeptide" or "ABP" is a reference to one or<br>
more such proteins and includes equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so<br>
forth.<br><br>
[73]	Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have<br>
the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the preferred methods, devices and materials are now described.<br>
[74]	All publications and patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by<br>
reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the constructs and methodologies that are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the presently described invention. The publications discussed herein are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention or for any other reason.<br>
[75]	The term "substantially purified" refers to an ABP that may be substantially or<br>
essentially free of components that normally accompany or interact with the protein as found in its naturally occurring environment, i.e. a native cell, or host cell in the case of recombinantly produced ABP. ABP that may be substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of protein having less than about 30%, less than about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, less than about 4%, less than about 3%3 less than about 2%, or less than about 1% (by dry weight) of contaminating protein. When the ABP or variant thereof is recombinantly produced by the host cells, the protein may be present at about 30%, about 25%, about 20%, about 15%, about 10%, about 5%, about 4%, about 3%, about 2%, or about 1% or less of the dry weight of the cells. When the ABP or variant thereof is recombinantly produced by the host cells, the protein may be present in the culture medium at about 5g/L, about 4g/L,  about 3g/L, about 2g/L, about lg/L, about 750mg/L, about 500mg/L, about 250mg/L, about l00mg/L, about 50mg/L, about 10mg/L, or about 1mg/L or less of the dry weight of the cells.

[76]	A "recombinant host cell" or "host cell" refers to a cell that includes an<br>
exogenous polynucleotide, regardless of the method used for insertion, for example, direct<br>
uptake, transduction, f-mating, or other methods known in the art to create recombinant host<br>
cells.    The exogenous polynucleotide may be maintained as a nonintegrated vector, for<br>
example, a plasmid, or alternatively, may be integrated into the host genome.<br>
[77]	As used herein, the term "medium" or "media" includes any culture medium,<br>
solution, solid, semi-solid, or rigid support that may support or contain any host cell, including bacterial host cells, yeast host cells, insect host cells, plant host cells, eukaryotic host cells, mammalian host cells, CHO cells or E. coli, and cell contents. Thus, the term may encompass medium in which the host cell has been grown, e.g., medium into which the ABP has been secreted, including medium either before or after a proliferation step. The term also may encompass buffers or reagents that contain host cell lysates, such as in the case where the ABP is produced intracellularly and the host cells are lysed or disrupted to release the ABP.<br>
[78]	"Reducing agent," as used herein with respect to protein refolding, is defined<br>
as any compound or material which maintains sulfhydryl groups in the reduced state and reduces intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds. Suitable reducing agents include, but are not limited to, dithiothreitol (DTT), 2-mercaptoethanol, dithioerythritol, cysteine, cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol), and reduced glutathione.

It is readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that a wide variety of oxidizing agents are suitable for use in the methods of the present invention.<br>
[80]	"Denaturing agent"  or "denaturant," as used herein, is defined as any<br>
compound or material which will cause a reversible unfolding of a protein. The strength of a denaturing agent or denaturant will be determined both by the properties and the concentration of the particular denaturing agent or denaturant. Suitable denaturing agents or denaturants may be chaotropes, detergents, organic solvents, water miscible solvents, phospholipids, or a combination of two or more such agents. Suitable chaotropes include, but<br><br>

reactions, or methods which employ at least two polypeptides which interact with each other and result in the transformation of unfolded or improperly folded polypeptides to native, properly folded polypeptides.<br>
[83]	Antibodies are proteins, which exhibit binding specificity to a specific antigen.<br>
Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end; the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain.

Hawkins et al. J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 (1992). CDR walking mutagenesis has been employed to affinity mature human antibodies which bind the human envelope glycoprotein gpl20 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HTV-1) (Barbas III et al. PNAS (USA) 91: 3809-3813 (1994); and Yang et al. J. Mol. Biol. 254:392-403 (1995)); and an anti-c-erbB-2 single chain Fv fragment (Schier et al. J. Mol. Biol. 263:551567 (1996)). Antibody chain shuffling and CDR mutagenesis were used to affinity mature a high-affinity human antibody directed against the third hypervariable loop of HIV (Thompson et al. J. Mol. Biol. 256:77-88 (1996)). Balint and Lanick Gene 137:109-118 (1993) describe a computer-assisted oligodeoxyribonucleotide-directed scanning mutagenesis whereby all CDRs of a variable region gene are simultaneously and thoroughly searched for improved variants. An αvβ3-specific humanized antibody was affinity matured using an initial limited mutagenesis strategy in which every position of all six CDRs was mutated followed by the expression and screening of a combinatorial library including the highest affinity mutants (Wu et al. PNAS (USA) 95: 6037-6-42 (1998)), Phage displayed antibodies are reviewed in Chiswell and McCafferty TIBTECH 10:80-84 (1992); and Rader and Barbas III Current Opinion in Biotech. 8:503-508 (1997). In each case where mutant antibodies with improved affinity compared to a parent antibody are reported in the above references, the mutant antibody has amino acid substitutions in a CDR.<br>
[88]	By "affinity maturation" herein is meant the process of enhancing the affinity<br>

The immunoglobulin genes include, but are not limited to, the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma (IgGl, IgG23 IgG3, and IgG4), delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Antibody herein is meant to include full-length antibodies and antibody fragments, and include antibodies that exist naturally in any organism or are engineered (e.g. are variants).<br>
[90]	By "antibody fragment" is meant any form of an antibody other than the full-<br>

Antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fc, Fab, and (Fab!) 2, single chain Fv (scFv), diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, bifunctional hybrid antibodies, CDR1, CDR2, CDR3,<br><br><br><br>
[96]	By "variant protein sequence" as used herein is meant a protein sequence that<br>
has one or more residues that differ in amino acid identity from another similar protein sequence. Said similar protein sequence may be the natural wild type protein sequence, or another variant of the wild type sequence. In general, a starting sequence is referred to as a "parent" sequence, and may either be a wild type or variant sequence. For example, preferred embodiments of the present invention may utilize humanized parent sequences upon which computational analyses are done to make variants.<br>
[97]	By "variable region"  of an antibody herein is meant  a polypeptide or<br>
polypeptides composed of the VH immunoglobulin domain, the VL immunoglobulin domains,<br>
or the VH and VL immunoglobulin domains as is shown in FIG. 1 (including variants).<br>

scFv fragment, as this region in the context of a larger antibody fragment, or as this region in<br>
the context of a full-length antibody or an alternative, non-antibody scaffold molecule.<br>
[98]	The present invention may be applied to antibodies obtained from a wide<br>
range of sources. The antibody may be substantially encoded by an antibody gene or antibody genes from any organism, including but not limited to humans, mice, rats, rabbits, camels, Hamas, dromedaries, monkeys, particularly mammals and particularly human and particularly mice and rats. In one embodiment, the antibody may be fully human, obtained for example from a patient or subject, by using transgenic mice or other animals (Bruggemann &amp; Taussig, 1997, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 8:455-458) or hitman antibody libraries coupled with selection methods (Griffiths &amp; Duncan, 1998, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 9:102-108). The antibody may be from any source, including artificial or naturally occurring. For example the present invention may utilize an engineered antibody, including but not limited to chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies (Clark, 2000, Immunol. Today 21:397-402) or derived from a combinatorial library. In addition, the antibody being optimized may be an engineered variant of an antibody that is substantially encoded by one or more natural antibody genes. For example, in one embodiment the antibody being optimized is an antibody that has been identified by affinity maturation.<br>

expression, fusions for the purpose of purification (including but not limited to, to poly-histidine or affinity epitopes), fusions for the purpose of linking ABP"s to other biologically active molecules, fusions with serum albumin binding peptides, and fusions with serum proteins such as serum albumin.<br>
[105]	The term "antigen" or "binding partner" refers to a substance that is the target<br>
for the binding activity exhibited by the ABP. Virtually any substance may be an antigen or binding partner for an ABP. Examples of antigens or binding partners include, but are not limited to, Alpha-1 antitrypsin, Angiostatin, Antihemolytic factor, antibodies, Apolipoprotein, Apoprotein, Atrial natriuretic factor, Atrial natriuretic polypeptide, Atrial peptides, C-X-C chemokines (e.g., T39765, NAP-2, ENA-78, Gro-a, Gro-b, Gro-c, IP-10, GCP-2, NAP-4, SDF-1, PF4, MIG), Calcitonin, CC chemokines (e.g., Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, Monocyte chemoattractant protein-2, Monocyte chemoattractant protein-3, Monocyte inflammatory protein-1 alpha, Monocyte inflammatory protein-1 beta, RANTES, 1309, R83915, R91733, HCC1, T58847, D31065, T64262), CD40 ligand, C-kit Ligand, Collagen, Colony stimulating factor (CSF), Complement factor 5a, Complement inhibitor, Complement receptor 1, cytokines, (e.g., epithelial Neutrophil Activating Peptide-78, GROD/MGSA, GRO, GRQ, MEM, MIP-1, MCP-1), Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Erythropoietin ("EPO"), Exfoliating toxins A and B, Factor IX, Factor VII, Factor VIE, Factor X, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), Fibrinogen, Fibronectin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, Glucocerebrosidase, Gonadotropin, growth factors, Hedgehog proteins (e.g., Sonic, Indian, Desert), Hemoglobin, Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Hirudin, Human serum albumin, Insulin, Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF), interferons (e.g., IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ), interleukins (e.g., EL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL~6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, etc.), Keratinocyte Growth Factor (KGF), Lactofenin, leukemia inhibitory factor, Luciferase, Neurturin, Neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF), oncostatin M, Osteogenic protein, Parathyroid hormone, PD-ECSF, PDGF, peptide hormones (e.g., Human Growth Hormone), Pleiotropin, Protein A, Protein G, Pyrogenic exotoxins A, B, and C, Relaxin, Renin, SCF, Soluble complement receptor I, Soluble I-CAM 1, Soluble interleukin receptors (IL-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), Soluble TNF receptor, Somatomedin, Somatostatin, Somatotropin, Streptokinase, Superantigens, i.e., Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEA, SEB, SECl, SEC2, SEC3, SED, SEE), Superoxide dismutase, Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1), Thymosin alpha 1, Tissue plasminogen activator, Tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF beta), Tumor<br><br>

BioSciences 2002 catalogue and price list), and the corresponding protein sequences and<br>
genes and, typically, many variants thereof, are well-known (see, e.g., Genbank).<br>
[107]	Additional antigens or binding partners include, but are not limited to,<br>
transcriptional and expression activators. Example transcriptional and expression activators include genes and proteins that modulate cell growth, differentiation, regulation, or the like. Expression and transcriptional activators are found in prokaryotes, viruses, and eukaryotes, including fungi, plants, and animals, including mammals, providing a wide range of therapeutic targets. It will be appreciated that expression and transcriptional activators regulate transcription by many mechanisms, e.g., by binding to receptors, stimulating a signal transduction cascade, regulating expression of transcription factors, binding to promoters and enhancers, binding to proteins that bind to promoters and enhancers, unwinding DNA, splicing pre-mRNA, polyadenylating RNA, and degrading RNA. Antigens or binding partners include, but are not limited to, expression activators such as cytokines, inflammatory molecules, growth factors, their receptors, and oncogene products, e.g., interieukins (e.g., IL-1, IL-2, IL-8, etc.), interferons, FGF, IGF-I, IGF-II, FGF, PDGF, TNF, TGF-α, TGF-, EGF, KGF, SCF/c-Kit, CD40UCD40, VLA-4/VCAM-1, ICAM-l/LFA-1, and hyalurin/CD44; signal transduction molecules and corresponding oncogene products, e.g., Mos, Ras, Raf, and Met; and transcriptional activators and suppressors, e.g., p53, Tat, Fos, Myc, Jun, Myb, Rel, and steroid hormone receptors such as those for estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, aldosterone, the LDL receptor ligand and corticosterone.<br>
[108]	Vaccine proteins may be antigens or binding partners including, but not<br>
limited to, proteins from infectious fungi, e.g., Aspergillus, Candida species; bacteria, particularly E. coli, which serves a model for pathogenic bacteria, as well as medically important bacteria such as Staphylococci (e.g., aureus), or Streptococci (e.g., pneumoniae); protozoa such as sporozoa (e.g., Plasmodia), rhizopods (e.g., Entamoeba) and flagellates (Trypanosoma, Leishmania, Trichomonas, Giardia etc.); viruses such as ( + ) RNA viruses (examples include Poxviruses e.g., vaccinia; Picornaviruses, e.g. polio; Togaviruses, e.g., rubella; Flaviviruses, e.g., HCV; and Coronaviruses), (- ) RNA viruses (e.g., Rhabdoviruses, e.g., VSV; Paramyxovimses, e.g., RSV; Orthomyxovimses, e.g., influenza; Bunyaviruses;<br><br>
and Arenaviruses), dsDNA viruses (Reoviruses, for example), RNA to DNA viruses, i.e.,<br>
Retroviruses, e.g., HIV and HTLV, and certain DNA to RNA viruses such as Hepatitis B.<br>
[109]	Antigens or binding partners may be enzymes including, but not limited to,<br>
amidases, amino acid racemases, acylases, dehalogenases, dioxygenases, diarylpropane peroxidases, epimerases, epoxide hydrolases, esterases, isomerases, kinases, glucose isomerases, glycosidases, glycosy] transferases, haloperoxidases, monooxygenases (e.g., p450s), lipases, lignin peroxidases, nitrile hydratases, nitrilases, proteases, phosphatases, subtilisins, transaminase, and nucleases.<br>
[110]	Agriculturally related proteins such as insect resistance proteins (e.g., the Cry<br>
proteins), starch and lipid production enzymes, plant and insect toxins, toxin-resistance<br>
proteins, Mycotoxin detoxification proteins, plant growth enzymes (e.g., Ribulose 1,5-<br>
Bisphosphate     Carboxylase/Oxygenase,     "RUBISCO"),     lipoxygenase     (LOX),     and<br>
Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase may also be antigens or binding partners.<br>
[111]	For example, the antigen or binding partner may be a disease-associated<br>
molecule, such as tumor surface antigen such as B-cell idiotypes, CD20 on malignant B cells, CD33 on leukemic blasts, and HER2/neu on breast cancer. Alternatively, the antigen or binding partner may be a growth factor receptor. Examples of the growth factors include, but are not limited to, epidermal growth factors (EGFs), transferrin, insulin-like growth factor, transforming growth factors (TGFs), interleukin-1, and interleukin-2. For example, a high expression of EGF receptors has been found in a wide variety of human epithelial primary tumors. TGF-a has been found to mediate an autocrine stimulation pathway in cancer cells. Several murine monoclonal antibodies have been demonstrated to be able to bind EGF receptors, block the binding of ligand to EGF receptors, and inhibit proliferation of a variety of human cancer cell lines in culture and in xenograft medels. Mendelsohn and Baselga (1995) Antibodies to growth factors and receptors, in Biologic Therapy of Cancer, 2nd Ed., JB Lippincott, Philadelphia, pp 607-623. Thus, ABPs of the invention may be used to treat a variety of cancers.<br>
[112]	The antigen or binding partner may also be cell surface protein or receptor<br>
associated with coronary artery disease such as platelet glycoprotein Iib/IIIa receptor, autoimmune diseases such as CD4, CAMPATH-1 and lipid A region of the gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Humanized antibodies against CD4 have been tested in clinical trials in the treatment of patients with mycosis fungoides, generalized postular psoriasis, severe psorisis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Antibodies against lipid A region of the gram-<br><br>
negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide have been tested clinically in the treatment of septic<br>
shock. Antibodies against CAMPATH-1 have also been tested clinically in the treatment of<br>
against refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, ABPs of the invention may be used to treat a<br>
variety of autoimmune diseases. Vaswani et al. (1998) "Humanized antibodies as potential<br>
therapeutic drugs" Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology 81:105-115.<br>
[113]	The antigen or binding partner may also be proteins or peptides associated<br>
with human allergic diseases, such as inflammatory mediator proteins, e.g. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), leukotriene receptor and 5-lipoxygenase, and adhesion molecules such as V-CAM/VLA-4. In addition, IgE may also serve as the antigen or binding partner because IgE plays pivotal role in type I immediate hypersensitive allergic reactions such as asthma. Studies have shown that the level of total serum IgE tends to correlate with severity of diseases, especially in asthma. Burrows et al. (1989) "Association of asthma with serum IgE levels and skin-test reactivity to allergens" New Engl. L. Med. 320:271-277. Thus, ABPs selected against IgE may be used to reduce the level of IgE or block the binding of IgE to mast cells and basophils in the treatment of allergic diseases without having substantial impact on normal immune functions.<br>
[114]	The antigen or binding partner may also be a viral surface or core protein<br>
which may serve as an antigen to trigger immune response of the host Examples of these viral proteins include, but are not limited to, glycoproteins (or surface antigens, e.g., GP120 and GP41) and capsid proteins (or structural proteins, e.g., P24 protein); surface antigens or core proteins of hepatitis A, B, C, D or E virus (e.g. small hepatitis B surface antigen (SHBsAg) of hepatitis B virus and the core proteins of hepatitis C virus, XS3, NS4 and NS5 antigens); glycoprotein (G-protein) or the fusion protein (F-protein) of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); surface and core proteins of herpes simplex virus HSV-1 and HSV-2 (e.g., glycoprotein D from HSV-2).<br>
[115]	The antigen or binding partner may also be a mutated tumor suppressor gene<br>
product that has lost its tumor-suppressing function and may render the cells more susceptible to cancer. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that function to inhibit the cell growth and division cycles, thus preventing the development of neoplasia. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes cause the cell to ignore one or more of the components of the network of inhibitory signals, overcoming the cell cycle check points and resulting in a higher rate of controlled cell growth-cancer. Examples of the tumor suppressor genes include, but are not limited to, DPC-4, NF-1, NF-2, RB, p53, WT1, BRCA1 and BRCA2.<br><br>
[116]	DPC-4 is involved in pancreatic cancer and participates in a cytoplasmic<br>
pathway that inhibits cell division. NF-1 codes for a protein that inhibits Ras, a cytoplasmic inhibitory protein. NF-1 is involved in neuroflbroma and pheochrornocytomas of the nervous system and myeloid leukemia. NF-2 encodes a nuclear protein that is involved in meningioma, schwanoma, and ependymoma of the nervous system. RB codes for the pRB protein, a nuclear protein that is a major inhibitor of cell cycle. RB is involved in retinoblastoma as well as bone, bladder, small cell lung and breast cancer. p53 codes for p53 protein that regulates cell division and can induce apoptosis. Mutation and/or inaction of p53 is found in a wide ranges of cancers. WT1 is involved in Wilms tumor of the kidneys. BRCA1 is involved in breast and ovarian cancer, and BRCA2 is involved in breast cancer. Thus, ABPs may be used to block the interactions of the gene product with other proteins or biochemicals in the pathways of tumor onset and development.<br><br><br>
OPGL, CA-125 tumor antigen, Staphylococci proteins, Staphylococcus epidermidis proteins, Staphylococcus aureus proteins, proteins involved Staphylococcal infection (including but not limited to, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), IL-6 receptor, CTLA-4, RSV, Tac subunit of IL-2 receptor, IL-5, and EpCam. The antigen or binding partner may be a fragment of a molecule.<br>
[118]	Examples of bispecific ABPs include, but are not limited to, those with one<br>
ABP directed against a tumor cell antigen and the other ABP directed against a cytotoxic trigger molecule such as anti-FcγRI/anti-CD 15, anti-p185HER2/FcγRin (CD16), anti-CD3/anti-malignant B-cell (1D10), anti-CD3/anti-pl85HER2,  anti-CD3/anti-p97, anti-CD3/anti-renal cell carcinoma, anti-CD3/anti-OVCAR-3, anti-CD3/L-Dl (anti-colon carcinoma), anti-CD3/anti-melanocyte stimulating hormone analog, anti-EGF receptor/anti-CD3, anti-CD3/anti-CAMAl, anti-CD3/anti-CD19, anti-CD3/MoV18, anti-neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)/anti-CD3, anti-folate binding protein (FBP)/anti-CD3, anti-pan carcinoma associated antigen (AMOC-31)/anti-CD3; bispecific ABPs with one ABP which binds specifically to a tumor antigen and another ABP which binds to a toxin such as anti-saporin/anti-Id-1, anti-CD22/anti-saporin, anti-CD7/anti-saporin, anti-CD38/anti-saporin, anti-CEA/anti-ricin A chain, anti-interferon-α (IFN-α)/anti-hybridoma idiotype, anti-CEA/anti-vinca alkaloid; bispecific ABPs for converting enzyme activated prodrugs such as anti-CD30/anti-alkaline phosphatase (which catalyzes conversion of mitomycin phosphate prodrug to mitomycin alcohol); bispecific ABPs which can be used as fibrinolytic agents such as anti-fibrin/anti-tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), anti-fibrin/anti-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA); bispecific ABPs for targeting immune complexes to cell surface receptors such as anti-low density lipoprotein (LDL)/anti-Fc receptor (e.g. FcγRI, FcγRII or FcγRIII); bispecific ABPs for use in therapy of infectious diseases such as anti-CD3/anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV), anti-T-cell receptor:CD3 complex/anti-infiuenza, anti-FcγR/anti-HIV; bispecific ABPs for tumor detection in vitro or in vivo such as anti-CEA/anti-EOTUBE, anti-CEA/anti-DPTA, anti-pl85 HER2 /anti-hapten; bispecific ABPs as vaccine adjuvants (see Fanger, MW et al., Crit Rev Immunol. 1992;12(3-4):101-24, which is incorporated by reference herein); and bispecific ABPs as diagnostic tools such as anti-rabbit IgG/anti-ferritin, anti-horse radish peroxidase (HRP)/anti-hormone, anti-somatostatin/anti-substance P, anti-HRP/anti-FITC, anti-CEA/anti-p-galactosidase (see Nolan, O et R. O'Kennedy, Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Aug l;1040(l):l-ll, which is incorporated by<br><br>
reference herein). Examples of trispecific ABPs include anti-CD3/anti-CD4/anti-CD37, anti-CD3/anti-CD5/anti-CD37 and anti~CD3/anti-CD8/anti-CD37.<br>
[119]	Various   references   disclose   modification   of polypeptides   by   polymer<br>
conjugation or glycosylation. The term "ABP" or "antigen-binding polypeptide" includes, but is not limited to5 polypeptides conjugated to a polymer such as PEG and may be comprised of one or more additional derivitizations of cysteine, lysine, N or C-terminal amino acids, or other residues. In addition, the ABP may comprise a linker, polymer or biologically active molecule, wherein the amino acid to which the linker, polymer, or biologically active molecule is conjugated may be a non-natural amino acid according to the present invention, or may be conjugated to a naturally encoded amino acid utilizing techniques known in the art such as coupling to lysine or cysteine. U.S. Pat. No. 4,904,584 discloses PEGylated lysine depleted polypeptides, wherein at least one lysine residue has been deleted or replaced with any other amino acid residue. WO 99/67291 discloses a process for conjugating a protein with PEG, wherein at least one amino acid residue on the protein is deleted and the protein is contacted with PEG under conditions sufficient to achieve conjugation to the protein. WO 99/03887 discloses PEGylated variants of polypeptides belonging to the growth hormone superfamily, wherein a cysteine residue has been substituted with a non-essential aniino acid residue located in a specified region of the polypeptide. WO 00/26354 discloses a method of producing a glycosylated polypeptide variant with reduced allergenicity, which as compared to a corresponding parent polypeptide comprises at least one additional glycosylation site.<br>
[120]	The term "antigen-binding polypeptide" also includes glycosylated ABP's,.<br>
such as but not limited to, polypeptides glycosylated at any amino acid position, N-linked or O-linked glycosylated forms of the polypeptide. Variants containing single nucleotide changes are also considered as biologically active variants of ABP. In addition, splice variants are also included. The term "antigen-binding polypeptide" also includes ABP heterodimers, homodimers, heteromultimers, or homomultimers of any one or more ABP or any other polypeptide, protein, carbohydrate, polymer, small molecule, linker, ligand, or other biologically active molecule of any type, linked by chemical means or expressed as a fusion protein, as well as polypeptide analogues containing, for example, specific deletions or other modifications yet maintain biological activity.<br>
[121]	In some embodiments, the antigen-binding polypeptides further comprise an<br>
addition, substitution or deletion that modulates biological activity of the ABP. For example,<br><br>
the additions, substitutions or deletions may modulate one or more properties or activities of<br>
the ABP, including but not limited to, modulating affinity for the antigen, modulate<br>
(including but not limited to, increases or decreases) antigen conformational or other<br>
secondary, tertiary or quaternary structural changes, stabilize antigen conformational or other<br>
secondary, tertiary or quaternary structural changes, induce or cause antigen conformational<br>
or other secondary, tertiary or quaternary structural changes, modulate circulating half-life,<br>
modulate therapeutic half-life, modulate stability of the polypeptide, modulate dose,<br>

route of administration. Similarly, antigen-binding polypeptides may comprise protease<br>
cleavage sequences, reactive groups, antibody-binding domains (including but not limited to,<br>
FLAG or poly-His) or other affinity based sequences (including but not limited to, FLAG,<br>
poly-His, GST, etc.) or linked molecules (including but not limited to, biotin) that improve<br>
detection (including but not limited to, GFP), purification or other traits of the polypeptide.<br>
[122]	The term "antigen-binding polypeptide" also encompasses ABP homodimers,<br>
heterodimers, homomultimers, and heteromultimers that are linked, including but not limited<br>
to those linked directly via non-naturally encoded amino acid side chains, either to the same<br>
or different non-naturally encoded amino acid side chains, to naturally-encoded amino acid<br>
side chains, as fusions, or indirectly via a linker. Exemplary linkers include but are not<br>
limited to, small organic compounds, water soluble polymers of a variety of lengths such as<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) or polydextran, or polypeptides of various lengths.<br>
[123]	Those   of skill   in  the   art  will   appreciate  that   amino   acid  positions<br>
corresponding to positions in a particular antigen-binding polypeptide sequence can be readily identified in a fragment of the antigen-binding polypeptide or related antigen-binding polypeptide, etc. For example, sequence alignment programs such as BLAST can be used to align and identify a particular position in a protein that corresponds with a position in a related sequence.<br>
[124]	The   term   "antigen-binding   polypeptide"   encompasses   antigen-binding<br>
polypeptides comprising one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions. Antigen-binding polypeptides of the present invention may be comprised of modifications with one or more natural ammo acids in conjunction with one or more non-natural amino acid modification. Exemplary substitutions in a wide variety of amino acid positions in naturally-occurring ABP polypeptides have been described, including but not limited to substitutions that modulate one or more of the biological activities of the antieen-bindine nolvneotide.<br><br>
such as but not limited to, increase agonist activity, increase solubility of the polypeptide,<br>
convert the polypeptide into an antagonist, etc. and are encompassed by the term "ABP."<br>
[125]	A "non-naturally encoded amino acid" refers to an amino acid that is not one<br>
of the 20 common amino acids or pyrolysine or selenocysteine. Other terms that may be used<br>
synonymously with the term "non-naturally encoded amino acid" are "non-natural amino<br>
acid/' "unnatural amino acid," "non-naturally-occurring amino acid," and variously<br>
hyphenated and non-hyphenated versions thereof. The term "non-naturally encoded amino<br>
acid" also includes, but is not limited to, amino acids that occur by modification (e.g. post-<br>
translational modifications) of a naturally encoded amino acid (including but not limited to,<br>
the 20 common amino acids or pyrolysine and selenocysteine) but are not themselves<br>
naturally incorporated into a growing polypeptide chain by the translation complex.<br>
Examples of such non-naturally-occurring amino acids include, but are not limited to, N-<br>
acetylglucosaininyl-L-serine, N-acetylglucosaminyl-L-threonine, and O-phosphotyrosine.<br>
[126]	An "amino terminus modification group" refers to any molecule that can be<br>
attached to the amino terminus of a polypeptide. Similarly, a "carboxy terminus modification group11 refers to any molecule that can be attached to the carboxy terminus of a polypeptide. Terminus modification groups include, but are not limited to, various water soluble polymers, peptides or proteins such as serum albumin, or other moieties that increase serum half-life of peptides.<br>
[127]	The terms "functional group", "active moiety", "activating group", "leaving<br>
group", "reactive site", "chemically reactive group" and "chemically reactive moiety" are used in the art and herein to refer to distinct, definable portions or units of a molecule. The terms are somewhat synonymous in the chemical arts and are used herein to indicate the portions of molecules that perform some function or activity and are reactive with other molecules.<br>
[128]	The term "linkage" or "linker" is used herein to refer to groups or bonds that<br>
normally are formed as the result of a chemical reaction and typically are covalent linkages. Hydrolytically stable linkages means that the linkages are substantially stable in water and do not react with water at useful pH values, including but not limited to, under physiological conditions for an extended period of time, perhaps even indefinitely. Hydrolytically unstable or degradable linkages mean that the linkages are degradable in water or in aqueous solutions, including for example, blood. Enzymatically unstable or degradable linkages mean that the linkage can be degraded by one or more enzymes. As understood in the art, PEG and<br><br>
related polymers may include degradable linkages in the polymer backbone or in the linker group between the polymer backbone and one or more of the terminal functional groups of the polymer molecule. For example, ester linkages formed by the reaction of PEG carboxylic acids or activated PEG carboxylic acids with alcohol groups on a biologically active agent generally hydrolyze under physiological conditions to release the agent. Other hydrolytically degradable linkages include, but are not limited to, carbonate linkages; imine linkages resulted from reaction of an amine and an aldehyde; phosphate ester linkages formed by reacting an alcohol with a phosphate group; hydrazone linkages which are reaction product of a hydrazide and an aldehyde; acetal linkages that are the reaction product of an aldehyde and an alcohol; orthoester linkages that are the reaction product of a formate and an alcohol; peptide linkages formed by an amine group, including but not limited to, at an end of a polymer such as PEG, and a carboxyl group of a peptide; and oligonucleotide linkages formed by a phosphoramidite group, including but not limited to, at the end of a polymer, and a 5' hydroxyl group of an oligonucleotide. Branched linkers may be used in antigen-binding polypeptides of the invention.<br>

"biologically active agent" when used herein means any substance which can affect any<br>
physical or biochemical properties of a biological system, pathway, molecule, or interaction<br>
relating to an organism, including but not limited to, viruses, bacteria, bacteriophage,<br>
transposon, prion, insects, fungi, plants, animals, and humans. In particular, as used herein,<br>
biologically active molecules include, but are not limited to, any substance intended for<br>
diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in humans or other animals,  or<br>
to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being of humans or animals Examples of<br>
biologically active molecules include, but are not limited to, peptides, proteins, enzymes,<br>
small molecule drugs, hard drugs, soft drugs, dyes, lipids, nucleosides, oligonucleotides,<br>

direct biologically active molecules or detectable labels to a tumor site. This can facilitate tumor killing, detection and/or localization or other effect. Diagnostic probes or imaging<br><br><br><br>
[135]	In  certain specific  embodiments, this invention contemplates the use of<br>
immunoconjugates (chimeric moieties) for the detection of tumors and/or other cancer cells. Thus, for example, the bispecific antibodies of this invention can be conjugated to gamma-emitting radioisotopes (e.g., Na-22S Cr-51, Co-60, Tc-99, 1-125, 1-131, Cs-137, Ga-67, Mo-99) for detection with a gamma camera, to positron emitting isotopes (e.g. C-l 1, N-13, O-15, F-18, and the like) for detection on a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) instrument, and to metal contrast agents (e.g., Gd containing reagents, Eu containing reagents, and the like) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), In addition, the bispecific antibodies of this invention can be used in traditional immunohistochemistry (e.g. fluorescent labels, nanocrystal labels, enzymatic and colormetric labels etc.).<br>
[136]	In   another   embodiment,   the   biologically   active   molecule   can   be   a<br>
radiosensitizer that enhances the cytotoxic effect of ionizing radiation (e.g., such as might be produced by 60Co or an x-ray source) on a cell. Numerous radiosensitizing agents are known and include, but are not limited to benzoporphyrin derivative compounds (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,439), 1,2,4-benzotriazine oxides (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,849,738), compounds containing certain diamines (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,825), BCNT (see, e.g., U.S. Pat., No. 5,872,107), radiosensitizing nitrobenzoic acid amide derivatives (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,814), various heterocyclic derivatives (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,064.849), platinum complexes (see, e.g., U.S. Pat No. 4,921,963), and the like.<br>
[137]	The biologically active molecule may also be a ligand, an epitope tag, a<br>
pep tide, a protein, or another ABP. Ligand and antibodies may be those that bind to surface markers on immune cells. Chimeric molecules utilizing such antibodies as biologically active molecules act as bifunctional linkers establishing an association between the immune cells bearing binding partner for the ligand or ABP and the tumor cells expressing the EGFR family members).<br>
[138]	Many of the pharmaceuticals and/or radiolabels described herein may be<br>
provided as a chelate, particularly where a pre-targeting strategy is utilized. The chelating<br>
molecule is typically coupled to a molecule (e.g. biotin, avidin, streptavidin, etc.) that<br>
specifically binds an epitope tag attached to the bispecific and/or multispecific ABP.<br>
[139]	Chelating groups are well known to those of skill in the art. In certain<br>
embodiments, chelating groups are derived from ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA), cyclohexyl 1,2-diamine tetra-acetic acid (CDTA), ethyleneglycol-O,O'-bist- 2-aminoethyl)-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA), N,N-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
dianthin proteins, Phytolaca americana proteins (PAPI, PAPAII, and PAP-S), momordica charantia inhibitor, curcin, crotin sapaonaria, officinalis inhibitor, gelonin, mitogellin, restrictoein, phenomycin, enomycin, and the tricothecenes. See e.g., WO 93/21232. Particularly preferred cytotoxins include Pseudomonas exotoxins (PE), Diphtheria toxins, ricin, and abrin. Pseudomonas exotoxin and Dipthteria toxin are well known. Like PE, diphtheria toxin (DT) kills cells by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2 thereby inhibiting protein synthesis.    Additional citations regarding immunotoxins include Brinkmann, U.<br>

well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Siegall et al. (1989) FASEB J., 3: 2647-2652;<br>
and Chaudhary et al. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84: 4538-4542).  All citations are<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[148]	Other suitable biologically active molecules include pharmacological agents or<br>
encapsulation systems containing various pharmacological agents.  Thus,  the targeting<br>
molecule of the chimeric molecule may be attached directly to a drug that is to be delivered<br>
directly to the tumor. Such drugs are well known to those of skill in the art and include, but<br>
are not limited to, doxirubicin, vinblastine, genistein, an antisense molecule, and the like,<br>
[149]	Alternatively, the biologically active molecule may be an encapsulation<br>
system, such as a viral capsid, a liposome, or micelle that contains a therapeutic composition such as a drug, a nucleic acid (e.g. an antisense nucleic acid), or another therapeutic moiety that is preferably shielded from direct exposure to the circulatory system. Means of preparing liposomes attached to antibodies are well known to those of skill in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,957,735, Connor et al. (1985) Pharm. Ther., 28: 341-365. Due to their antigen specificity, ABP's of the invention may be used to direct drug-loaded liposomes to their target. See Park, J.W. et al (2002) Clin. Cancer Res, 8, 1172-1181 and Shi, N, et al (2001) Pharm. Res. 18,1091-1095.<br>
[150]	ABP's of the invention may be conjugated to molecules such as PEG to<br>
improve in vivo delivery and pharmacokinetic profiles. Leong et al. describe site-specific PEGylation of a Fab' fragment of an anti-lL-8 antibody with a decreased clearance rate over the non-PEGylated form and little or no loss of antigen binding activity (Leong, S.R. et al. (2001) Cytoldne 16:106-119).<br><br>
[151]	The ABP's of the present invention may be linked to a prodrug.   The term<br>
"prodrug" as used herein means a pharmacologically inactive, or reduced activity, derivative<br>
of an active drug. Prodrugs may be designed to modulate the amount of a drug or<br>
biologically active molecule that reaches a desired site of action through the manipulation of<br>
the properties of a drug, such as physicochemical, biopharmaceutical, or pharmacokinetic<br>
properties. Prodrugs are converted into active drug within the body through enzymatic or<br>
non-enzymatic reactions. Prodrugs may provide improved physicochemical properties such<br>
as better solubility, enhanced delivery characteristics, such as specifically targeting a<br>
particular cell, tissue, organ or ligand, and improved therapeutic value of the drug. ABP's of<br>
the invention may be fused to enzymes for prodrug activation (Kousparou, C.A., et al. (2002)<br>
Int. J. Cancer 99, 138-148). (2002) Recombinant molecules may comprise an ABP and an<br>
enzyme that acts upon a prodrug to release a cytotoxin such as cyanide.<br>
[152]	The therapeutic agents may be administered as a prodrug and subsequently<br>
activated by a prodrug-activating enzyme that converts a prodrug like peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent to an active anti-cancer drug. See, e.g., WO 88/07378; WO 81/01145; U.S. Patent No. 4,975,278. In general, the enzyme component includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way as to convert it into its more active, cytotoxic form.<br>
[153]	Enzymes that may be useful include, but are not limited to,  alkaline<br>
phosphatase useful for converting phosphate-containing prodrugs into free drugs, arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate containing prodrugs into free drugs; cytosine deaminase useful for converting non-toxic 5-fluorocytosine into the anti-cancer drug, 5-fluorouracil; proteases, such as serratia protease, thermolysin, subtilising carboxypeptidases and cathepsins (such as cathepsins B and L), that are useful for converting peptide-containing prodrugs into free drugs; D-alanylcarboxypeptidases, useful for converting prodrugs that contain D-amino acid substituents; carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as β-galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs;β-lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with β-lactams into free drugs; and penicillin amidases, such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase, useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amino nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups, respectively, into free drugs.<br><br>
[154]	Alternatively, antibodies with enzymatic activity, also known in the art as<br>
"abzymes," may be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs. See e.g., Massey, (1987) 328:457-48.<br>
[155]	One of skill will appreciate that the bispecific and/or multispecific ABP of this<br>
invention and the biologically active molecule moieties can typically be joined together in any order. Thus, for example, where the targeting molecule is a single chain protein the biologically active molecule may be joined to either the amino or carboxy termini of the targeting molecule. The biologically active molecule can also be joined to an internal region of the bispecific and/or multispecific ABP, or conversely. Similarly, the bispecific and/or multispecific ABP can be joined to an internal location or a terminus of the biologically active molecule. In any case, attachment points are selected that do not interfere with the respective activities of the bispecific and/or multispecific ABP or the biologically active molecule.<br>
[156]	The bispecific and/or multispecific ABP and the biologically active molecule<br>
can be attached by any of a number of means well known to those of skill in the art. Typically the biologically active molecule is conjugated, either directly or through a linker (spacer), to the bispecific ABP. However, where both the biologically active molecule and the bispecific ABP are both polypeptides it may be desired to recombinantly express the chimeric molecule as a single-chain fusion protein.<br>
[157]	In one embodiment, the bispecific and/or multispecific ABP is chemically<br>
conjugated to the biologically active molecule (e.g., a cytotoxin, a label, a ligand, a drug, an ABP, a liposome, etc.). Means of chemically conjugating molecules are well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
[158]	The procedure for attaching an agent to an ABP or other polypeptide targeting<br>
molecule will vary according to the chemical structure of the agent Polypeptides typically contain variety of functional groups; e.g., carboxylic acid (COOH) or free amine (—NH2) groups, which are available for reaction with a suitable functional group on a biologically active molecule to bind the biologically active molecule thereto.<br>
[159]	Alternatively, the bispecific ABP and/or biologically active molecule can be<br>
derivatized to expose or attach additional reactive functional groups. The derivatization can involve attachment of any of a number of linker molecules such as those available from Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, 111.<br><br><br><br>
6,030,840, 6,028,066, 6,022,966, 6,022,523, 6,022,522, 6,017,522, 6,015,897, 6,010,682, 6,010,681, 6,004,533, and 6,001,329).<br>
[163]	Where the bispecific and/or multispecific ABP and/or the biologically active<br>
molecule are both single chain proteins and relatively short (i.e., less than about 50 amino acids) they can be synthesized using standard chemical peptide synthesis techniques. Where both components are relatively short, the chimeric moiety can be synthesized as a single contiguous polypeptide. Alternatively, a bispecific and/or multispecific ABP and the biologically active molecule may be synthesized separately and then fused by condensation of the amino terminus of one molecule with the carboxyl terminus of the other molecule thereby forming a peptide bond. Alternatively, the bispecific and/or multispecific ABP and biologically active molecules may each be condensed with one end of a peptide spacer molecule thereby forming a contiguous fusion protein.<br>
[164]	Solid phase synthesis in which the C-terminal amino acid of the sequence is<br>
attached to an insoluble support followed by sequential addition of the remaining amino acids in the sequence is the preferred method for the chemical synthesis of the polypeptides of this invention. Techniques for solid phase synthesis are described by Barany and Merrifield, Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis; pp. 3-284 in The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. Vol. 2: Special Methods in Peptide Synthesis, Part A., Merrifield, et al. J. Am. Chern. Soc.s 85: 2149-2156 (1963), and Stewart et al, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd ed. Pierce Chem. Co., Rockford, HI. (1984).<br>
[165]	A "bifunctional polymer"  refers to  a polymer comprising two  discrete<br>
functional groups that are capable of reacting specifically with other moieties (including but not limited to, amino acid side groups) to form covalent or non-covalent linkages. A bifunctional linker having one functional group reactive with a group on a particular biologically active component, and another group reactive with a group on a second biological component, may be used to form a conjugate that includes the first biologically active component, the bifunctional linker and the second biologically active component. Many procedures and linker molecules for attachment of various compounds to peptides are known. See, e.g., European Patent Application No. 188,256; U.S. Patent Nos, 4,671,958, 4,659,839, 4,414,148, 4,699,784; 4,680,338; 4,569,789; and 4,589,071 which are incorporated by reference herein. A "multi-functional polymer" refers to a polymer comprising two or more discrete functional groups that are capable of reacting specifically with other moieties (including but not limited to, amino acid side groups) to form covalent or<br><br><br><br>
isomers. The term "alkyl," unless otherwise noted, is also meant to include those derivatives of alkyl defined in more detail below, such as "heteroalkyl." Alkyl groups which are limited to hydrocarbon groups are termed "homoalkyl".<br>
[170]	The term "alkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent<br>
radical derived from an alkane, as exemplified, but not limited, by the structures -CH2CH2-and -CH2CH2CH2CH2-, and further includes those groups described below as "heteroallcylene." Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A "lower alkyl" or "lower alkylene" is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.<br>
[171]	The terms "alkoxy," "alkylamino" and "alkylthio" (or thioalkoxy) are used in<br>
their conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the<br>
molecule via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively.<br>
[172]	The term "heteroalkyl," by itself or in combination with another term, means,<br>
unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N and S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, -CH2-CH2-O-CH3, -CH2-CH2-NH-CH33 -CH2-CH2-N(CH3)-CH3, -CH2-S-CH2-CH3, -CT2-CH2,-S(O)-CH3, -CH2-CH2-S(O)2-CH3, -CH=CH-O-CH3, -Si(CH3)3, -CH2-CH=N-OCH3, and -CH=CH-N(CH3)-CH3. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, -CH2-NH-OCH3 and -CH2-O-Si(CH3)3. Similarly, the term "heteroalkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, -CH2-CH2-S-CH2-CH2- and -CH2-S-CH2-CH2-NH-CH2-. For heteroalkylene groups, the same or different heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (including but not limited to, alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, aminooxyalkylene, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula -C(O)2R'- represents both -C(O)2R'- and -R'C(O)2-.<br><br>
[173]	The   terms   "cycloalkyl"   and   "heterocycloalkyl",   by   themselves   or   in<br>
combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of "alkyl" and "heteroalkyl", respectively. Thus, a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl include saturated and unsaturated ring linkages. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, l-(l,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetxahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. Additionally, the term encompasses bicyclic and tricyclic ring structures. Similarly, the term "heterocycloalkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heterocycloalkyl, and the term "cycloalkylene" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from cycloalkyl.<br>
[174]	As used herein, the term "water soluble polymer" refers to any polymer that is<br>
soluble in aqueous solvents. Linkage of water soluble polymers to ABP can result in changes including, but not limited to, increased or modulated serum half-life, or increased or modulated therapeutic half-life relative to the unmodified form, modulated immunogenicity, modulated physical association characteristics such as aggregation and multimer formation, altered receptor binding and altered receptor dimerization or multimerization. The water soluble polymer may or may not have its own biological activity, and may be utilized as a linker for attaching an ABP to other substances, including but not limited to one or more ABP's, or one or more biologically active molecules. Suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, mono C1-C10 alkoxy or aryloxy derivatives thereof (described in U.S. Patent No. 5,252,714 which is incorporated by reference herein), monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyamino acids, divinylether maleic anhydride, A^2-Hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide, dextran, dextran derivatives including dextran sulfate, polypropylene glycol, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide copolymer, polyoxyethylated polyol, heparin, heparin fragments, polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, glycans, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, including but not limited to methylcellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose, starch and starch derivatives, polypeptides, polyalkylene glycol and derivatives thereof, copolymers of polyalkylene glycols and derivatives thereof, polyvinyl ethyl ethers, and alpha-beta-poly[(2-<br><br>
hydroxyethyl)-DL-aspartamide, and the like, or mixtures thereof.   Examples of such water<br>
soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol and serum albumin.<br>
[175]	As used herein, the term "polyalkylene glycol" or "poly(alkene glycol)" refers<br>
to polyethylene glycol (poly(ethylene glycol)), polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol, and derivatives thereof. The term "polyalkylene glycol" encompasses both linear and branched polymers and average molecular weights of between 0.1 kDa and 100 kDa. Other exemplary embodiments are listed, for example, in commercial supplier catalogs, such as Shearwater Corporation's catalog "Polyethylene Glycol and Derivatives for Biomedical Applications" (2001).<br>
[176]	The term "aryl" means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic,<br>
hydrocarbon substituent which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings) which are fused together or linked covalently. The term "heteroaryl" refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain from one to four heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1 -pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazoIyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1 -isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl3 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below.<br>
[177]	For brevity, the term "aryl" when used in combination with other terms<br>
(including but not limited to, aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term "arylalkyl" is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (including but not limited to, benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like) including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom (including but not limited to, a methylene group) has been replaced by, for example, an oxygen atom (including but not limited to, phenoxymethyl, 2-pyridyloxymethyl, 3-(l-naphthyloxy)propyl, and the like).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[184]	The term "nucleic acid" refers to deoxyribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleosides,<br>
ribonucleosides, or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally occurring nucleotides. Unless specifically limited otherwise, the term also refers to oligonucleotide analogs incuding PNA (peptidonucleic acid), analogs of DNA used in antisense technology (phosphorothioates, phosphoroamidates, and the like). Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (including but not limited to, degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et aL, Nucleic Acid Res. 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et aL, J. Biol Chem. 260:2605-2608 (1985); and Cassol et al (1992); Rossolini et aL, Mol Cell Probes 8:91-98 (1994)).<br>
[185]	The terms "polypeptide," "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably<br>
herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. That is, a description directed to a polypeptide applies equally to a description of a peptide and a description of a protein, and vice versa. The terms apply to naturally occurring amino acid polymers as well as amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residues is a non-naturally encoded amino acid. As used herein, the tains encompass amino acid chains of any length, including full length proteins (i.e., antigens), wherein the amino acid residues are linked by covalent peptide bonds.<br>
[186]	The term "amino  acid" refers  to naturally occurring and non-naturally<br>
occurring amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally occurring amino acids. Naturally encoded amino acids are the 20 common amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspaitic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, mefhionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine) and pyrolysine and selenocysteine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an a carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl  group,  an amino group,  and an R group, such as, homoserine, norleucine,<br><br>
methionine sulfoxide, methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (such as, norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid.<br>
[187]	Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three<br>
letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes.<br>
[188]	"Conservatively modified variants" applies to both amino acid and nucleic<br>
acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, "conservatively modified variants" refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are "silent variations," which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence.<br>
[189]	As to  amino acid sequences, one of skill will recognize that individual<br>
substitutions, deletions or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein<br>
sequence which alters, adds or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino<br>
acids in the encoded sequence is a "conservatively modified variant" where the alteration<br>
results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid.<br>
Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in<br>
the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude<br>
polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the invention.<br>
[190]	The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative<br>
substitutions for one another:<br><br>
1)	Alanine (A), Glycine (G);<br>
2)	Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E);<br>
3)	Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q);<br>
4)	Arginine (R), Lysine (K);<br>
5)	Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V);<br>
6)	Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W);<br>
7)	Serine (S), Threonine (T); and<br>
8)	Cysteine (C), Methionine (M)<br>
(see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties (W H Freeman &amp; Co.; 2nd edition (December 1993)<br>
[191]	The terms "identical" or percent "identity," in the context of two or more<br>
nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same. Sequences are "substantially identical" if they have a percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (i.e., about 60% identity, optionally about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, or about 95% identity over a specified region), when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window, or designated region as measured using one of the following sequence comparison algorithms or by manual alignment and visual inspection. This definition also refers to the complement of a test sequence. The identity can exist over a region that is at least about 50 amino acids or nucleotides in length, or over a region that is 75-100 amino acids or nucleotides in length, or, where not specified, across the entire sequence or a polynucleotide or polypeptide.<br>
[192]	For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence,<br>
to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated Default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.<br>
[193]	A "comparison window", as used herein, includes reference to a segment of<br>
any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from 20 to 600, usually about 50 to about 200, more usually about 100 to about 150 in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous<br><br>
positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, including but not limited to, by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1970) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482c, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) /. Mol. Biol 48:443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci USA 85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., Ausubel el al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1995 supplement)).<br>
[194]	One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence<br>
identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al (1977) Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, and Altschul et al (1990) J. Mol Biol. 215:403-410, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N—4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henilcoff (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=M, and a comparison of both strands. The BLAST algorithm is typically performed with the "low complexity" filter turned off.<br>
[195]	The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity<br>
between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Nail Acad. Sci. USA<br>
90:5873-5787). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest<br>
sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match<br>
between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a<br>
nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a<br>
comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more<br>
preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.<br>
[196]	The phrase "selectively (or specifically) hybridizes to" refers to the binding,<br>
duplexing, or hybridizing of a molecule only to a particular nucleotide sequence under<br><br>
stringent hybridization conditions when that sequence is present in a complex mixture (including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA).<br>
[197]	The phrase "stringent hybridization conditions" refers to conditions of low<br>
ionic strength and high temperature as is known in the art. Typically, under stringent conditions a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence in a complex mixture of nucleic acid (including but not limited to, total cellular or library DNA or RNA) but does not hybridize to other sequences in the complex mixture. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology—Hybridization with Nucleic Probes, "Overview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays" (1993). Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5-10° C lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH, and nucleic concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at Tm, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). Stringent conditions may be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.0 M sodium ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M sodium ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30°C for short probes (including but not limited to, 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60° C for long probes (including but not limited to, greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. For selective or specific hybridization, a positive signal may be at least two times background, optionally 10 times background hybridization- Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions can be as following: 50% fonnamide, 5X SSC, and 1% SDS, incubating at 42°C, or 5X SSC, 1% SDS, incubating at 65°C, with wash in 0.2X SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Such washes can be performed for 5,15, 30, 60,120, or more minutes.<br>

[200]	The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a mammal,<br>
most preferably a human, who is the object of treatment, observation or experiment.<br>
[201]	The term "effective amount" as used herein refers to that amount of the<br>
(modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide being administered which will relieve to some<br>
extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease, condition or disorder being treated.<br>
Compositions containing the (modified) non-natural amino acid polypeptide described herein<br>
can be administered for prophylactic, enhancing, and/or therapeutic treatments.<br>
[202]	The terms "enhance" or "enhancing" means to increase or prolong either in<br>
potency or duration a desired effect. Thus, in regard to enhancing the effect of therapeutic agents, the term "enhancing" refers to the ability to increase or prolong, either in potency or duration, the effect of other therapeutic agents on a system. An "enhancing-effective amount," as used herein, refers to an amount adequate to enhance the effect of another therapeutic agent in a desired system. When used in a patient, amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.<br>
[203]	The term "modifie"' as used herein refers to the presence of a post-<br>
translational modification on a polypeptide. The form "(modified)" term means that the polypeptides being discussed are optionally modified, that is, the polypeptides under discussion can be modified or unmodified.<br>
[204]	The  term  "post-translationally  modified"  and  "modified"  refers  to  any<br>
modification of a natural or non-natural amino acid that occurs to such an amino acid after it has been incorporated into a polypeptide chain. The term encompasses, by way of example only, co-translational in vivo modifications, post-translational in vivo modifications, and post-translational in vitro modifications.<br>
[205]	In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the (modified) non-<br>
natural arnino acid polypeptide are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at<br><br>
risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a "prophylactically effective amount." In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation (e.g., a dose escalation clinical trial).<br>
[206]	The term "protected" refers to the presence of a "protecting group" or moiety<br>
that prevents reaction of the chemically reactive functional group under certain reaction<br>
conditions. The protecting group will vary depending on the type of chemically reactive<br>
group being protected. For example, if the chemically reactive group is an amine or a<br>
hydrazide, the protecting group can be selected from the group of tert-butyloxycarbonyl (t-<br>
Boc) and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). If the chemically reactive group is a thiol, the<br>
protecting group can be orthopyridyldisulfide. If the chemically reactive group is a carboxylic<br>
acid, such as butanoic or propionic acid, or a hydroxyl group, the protecting group can be<br>
benzyl or an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, or tert-butyl. Other protecting groups known<br>

Such an amount is defined to be a "therapeutically effective amount," and will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such therapeutically effective amounts by routine experimentation (e.g., a dose escalation clinical trial).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
I	Introduction<br>
[212]	ABP molecules comprising at least one unnatural amino acid are provided in<br>
the invention. In certain embodiments of the invention, ABP with at least one unnatural amino acid includes at least one post-translational modification. In one embodiment, the at least one post-translational modification comprises attachment of a molecule including but not limited to, a label, a dye, a polymer, a water-soluble polymer, a derivative of polyethylene glycol, a photocrosslinker, a cytotoxic compound, a radionuclide, a drug, an affinity label, a photoaffinity label, a reactive compound, a resin, a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog, an antibody or antibody fragment, a metal chelator, a cofactor, a fatty acid, a carbohydrate, a polynucleotide, a DNA, a RNA, an antisense polyaucleotide, a water-soluble dendrimer, a cyclodextrin, an inhibitory ribonucleic acid, a biomaterial, a nanoparticle, a spin label, a fluorophore, a metal-containing moiety, a radioactive moiety, a novel functional group, a group that covalently or noncovalently interacts with other molecules, a photocaged moiety, a photoisomerizable moiety, biotin, a derivative of biotin, a biotin analogue, a moiety incorporating a heavy atom, a chemically cleavable group, a photocleavable group, an elongated side chain, a carbon-linked sugar, a redox-active agent, an amino thioacid, a toxic moiety, an isotopically labeled moiety, a biophysical probe, a phosphorescent group, a chemiluminescent group, an electron dense group, a magnetic group,<br><br>
an intercalating group, a chromophore, an energy transfer agent, a biologically active agent, a detectable label, a small molecule, or any combination of the above or any other desirable compound or substance, comprising a second reactive group to at least one unnatural amino acid comprising a first reactive group utilizing chemistry methodology that is known to one of ordinary skill in the art to be suitable for the particular reactive groups. For example, the first reactive group is an alkynyl moiety (including but not limited to, in the unnatural amino acid /?-propargyloxyphenylalanine, where the propargyl group is also sometimes referred to as an acetylene moiety) and the second reactive group is an azido moiety, and [3+2] cycloaddition chemistry methodologies are utilized. In another example, the first reactive group is the azido moiety (including but not limited to, in the unnatural amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine) and the second reactive group is the alkynyl moiety. In certain embodiments of the modified ABP polypeptide of the present invention, at least one unnatural amino acid (including but not limited to, unnatural amino acid containing a keto functional group) comprising at least one post-translational modification, is used where the at least one post-translational modification comprises a saccharide moiety. In certain embodiments, the post-translational modification is made in vivo in a eukaryotic cell or in a non-eukaryotic cell.<br>
[213]	In certain embodiments, the protein includes at least one post-translational<br>
modification that is made in vivo by one host cell, where the post-translational modification is not normally made by another host cell type. In certain embodiments, the protein includes at least one post-translational modification that is made in vivo by a eukaryotic cell, where the post-translational modification is not normally made by a non-eukaryotic cell. Examples of post-translational modifications include, but are not limited to, acetylation, acylation, lipid-modification, palmitoylation, palmitate addition, phosphorylation, glycolipid-linkage modification, and the like. In one embodiment, the post-translational modification comprises attachment of an oligosaccharide to an asparagine by a GlcNAc-asparagine linkage (including but not limited to, where the oligosaccharide comprises (GlcNAc-Man)2-Man-GlcNAc-GlcNAc, and the like). In another embodiment, the post-translational modification comprises attachment of an oligosaccharide (including but not limited to, Gal-GalNAc, Gal-GlcNAc, etc.) to a serine or threonine by a GalNAc-serine, a GalNAc-threonine, a GlcNAc-serine, or a GlcNAc-threonine linkage. In certain embodiments, a protein or polypeptide of the invention can comprise a secretion or localization sequence, an epitope tag, a FLAG tag, a polyhistidine tag, a GST fusion, and/or the like.   Examples of secretion signal sequences<br><br>

Examples of secretion signal sequences, include, but are not limited to, STII (prokaryotic), Fd GIII and M13 (phage), Bgl2 (yeast), and the signal sequence bla derived from a transposon.<br>
[214]	An antigen-binding polypeptide comprising a non-natural amino acid may be<br>
used to modulate the therapeutic half-life, serum half-life, or circulation time of biologically active molecules, including but not limited to, small molecules, peptides, and oligonucleotides. Such small molecules, peptides, and oligonucleotides may have biological activities that include, but are not limited to, binding and/or recognition of a target molecule or cell type, anti-tumor, anti-angiogenic, anti-viral, and apoptotic activities. In addition, the antigen-binding polypeptide comprising a non-natural amino acid may provide a desired activity, including, but not limited to, effector function such as ADCC, phagocytosis, or complement-dependent cytotoxicity, activation of prodrugs, enzymatic activity, catalytic activity, blocking of protein-protein interactions, binding to a desired antigen, and targeting of the small molecule to a desired site. The blocking of protein-protein interactions of an ABP may modulate one or more activities of the attached biologically active molecule. Small molecules may be used as antagonists to interfere with the binding activities of other proteins or molecules.<br>
[215]	The antigen-binding polypeptide and the small molecule may be joined by a<br>
linker, polymer or covalent bond. The linker, polymer, or small molecule itself may comprise a functional group that is unreactive toward the 20 common amino acids. The linker or polymer may be bifunctional. One or more bonds involved in joining the antigen-binding polypeptide via the linker, polymer, or covalent bond to the biologically active molecule may be irreversible, reversible or labile under desired conditions. One or more bonds involved in joining the antigen-binding polypeptide via the linker, polymer, or covalent bond to a molecule may allow modulated release of the antigen-binding polypeptide or other molecule. A diversity of small molecules may be generated by one skilled in the art by chemical means, isolation as natural products, or other means.<br>
[216]	Rader et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003 Apr 29;100(9):5396-400, which<br>
is incorporated by reference herein, describe a method to provide effector function and<br><br><br>
acids, including but not limited to, those amino acids containing functional groups or substituents not found in the 20 naturally incorporated amino acids, including but not limited to a ketone, an azide or acetylene moiety, into proteins in response to a selector codon and the subsequent modification of those amino acids with a suitably reactive PEG derivative. Once incorporated, the amino acid side chains can then be modified by utilizing chemistry methodologies known to those of ordinary skill in the art to be suitable for the particular functional groups or substituents present in the naturally encoded amino acid. Known chemistry methodologies of a wide variety are suitable for use in the present invention to<br><br>
incorporate a water soluble polymer into the protein. Such methodologies include but are not limited to a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition reaction (see, e.g., Padwa, A. in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, Vol. 4, (1991) Ed. Trost, B. M., Pergamon, Oxford, p. 1069-1109; and, Huisgen, R. in 1,3-Dipolar Cvcloaddition Chemistry, (1984) Ed. Padwa, A., Wiley, New York, p. 1-176) with, including but not limited to, acetylene or azide derivatives, respectively.<br>
[219]	Because the Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition method involves a cycloaddition<br>
rather than a nucleophilic substitution reaction, proteins can be modified with extremely high selectivity. The reaction can be carried out at room temperature in aqueous conditions with excellent regioselectivity (1,4 &gt; 1,5) by the addition of catalytic amounts of Cu(I) salts to the reaction mixture. See, e.g., Tornoe, et al., (2002) Org. Chem. 67:3057-3064; and, Rostovtsev, et al., (2002) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41:2596-2599; and WO 03/101972. A molecule that can be added to a protein of the invention through a [3+2] cycloaddition includes virtually any molecule with a suitable functional group or substituent including but not limited to an azido or acetylene derivative. These molecules can be added to an unnatural amino acid with an acetylene group, including but not limited to, p-propargyloxyphenylalanine, or azido group, including but not limited to p-azido-phenylalanine, respectively.<br>
[220]	The five-membered ring that results from the Huisgen [3÷2] cycloaddition is<br>
not generally reversible in reducing environments and is stable against hydrolysis for extended periods in aqueous environments. Consequently, the physical and chemical characteristics of a wide variety of substances can be modified under demanding aqueous conditions with the active PEG derivatives of the present invention. Even more important, because the azide and acetylene moieties are specific for one another (and do not, for example, react with any of the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids), proteins can be modified in one or more specific sites with extremely high selectivity.<br>
[221]	The invention also provides water soluble and hydrolytically stable derivatives<br>
of PEG derivatives and related hydrophilic polymers having one or more acetylene or azide moieties. The PEG polymer derivatives that contain acetylene moieties are highly selective for coupling with azide moieties that have been introduced selectively into proteins in response to a selector codon. Similarly, PEG polymer derivatives that contain azide moieties are highly selective for coupling with acetylene moieties that have been introduced selectively into proteins in response to a selector codon.<br><br>
[222]	More specifically, the azide moieties comprise, but are not limited to, alkyl<br>
azides, aryl azides and derivatives of these azides. The derivatives of the alkyl and aryl azides can include other substituents so long as the acetylene-specific reactivity is maintained. The acetylene moieties comprise alkyl and aryl acetylenes and derivatives of each. The derivatives of the alkyl and aryl acetylenes can include other substituents so long as the azide-specific reactivity is maintained.<br>
[223]   ABP comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid may be used in assays that<br>
utilize the specificity of antibodies. For example, ABP molecules of the invention may be used to screen a population of potential antigens.<br>
[224]	The present invention provides conjugates of substances having a wide variety<br>
of functional groups, substituents or moieties, with other substances including but not limited to a label; a dye; a polymer; a water-soluble polymer; a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a photocrosslinker; a cytotoxic compound; a radionuclide; a drug; an affinity label; a photoaffinity label; a reactive compound; a resin; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; a metal chelator; a cofactor; a fatty acid; a carbohydrate; a polynucleotide; a DNA; a RNA; an antisense polynucleotide; a water-soluble dendrimer; a cyclodextrin; an inhibitory ribonucleic acid; a biomaterial; a nanoparticle; a spin label; a fluorophore, a metal-containing moiety; a radioactive moiety, a novel functional group; a group that covalently or noncovalently interacts with other molecules; a photocaged moiety; a photoisomerizable moiety; biotin; a derivative of biotin; a biotin analogue; a moiety incorporating a heavy atom; a chemically cleavable group; a photocleavable group; an elongated side chain; a carbon-linked sugar; a redox-active agent an amino thioacid; a toxic moiety, an isotopically labeled moiety a biophysical probe; a phosphorescent group; a chemiluminescent group; an electron dense group; a magnetic group; an intercalating group; a chromophore; an energy transfer agent; a biologically active agent; a detectable label; a small molecule; or any combination of the above, or any otber desirable compound or substance). The present invention also includes conjugates of substances having azide or acetylene moieties with PEG polymer derivatives having the corresponding acetylene or azide moieties. For example, a PEG polymer containing an azide moiety can be coupled to a biologically active molecule at a position in the protein that contains a non-genetically encoded amino acid bearing an acetylene functionality.    The<br><br>
linkage by which the PEG and the biologically active molecule are coupled includes but is not limited to the Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition product.<br>
[225]	It is well established in the art that PEG can be used to modify the surfaces of<br>
biomaterials (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 6,610,281; Mehvar, R., J. Pharmaceut. Sci., 3(1):125-136<br>
(2000) which are incorporated by reference herein). The invention also includes biomaterials<br>
comprising a surface having one or more reactive azide or acetylene sites and one or more of<br>
the azide- or acetylene-containing polymers of the invention coupled to the surface via the<br>
Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition linkage. Biomaterials and other substances can also be coupled<br>
to the azide- or acetylene-activated polymer derivatives through a linkage other than the azide<br>
or acetylene linkage, such as through a linkage comprising a carboxylic acid, amine, alcohol<br>
or thiol moiety, to leave the azide or acetylene moiety available for subsequent reactions.<br>
[226]	The invention includes a method of synthesizing the azide- and acetylene-<br>
containing polymers of the invention. In the case of the azide-containing PEG derivative, the azide can be bonded directly to a carbon atom of the polymer. Alternatively, the azide-containing PEG derivative can be prepared by attaching a linking agent that has the azide moiety at one terminus to a conventional activated polymer so that the resulting polymer has the azide moiety at its terminus. In the case of the acetylene-containing PEG derivative, the acetylene can be bonded directly to a carbon atom of the polymer. Alternatively, the acetylene-containing PEG derivative can be prepared by attaching a linking agent that has the acetylene moiety at one terminus to a conventional activated polymer so that the resulting polymer has the acetylene moiety at its terminus.<br>
[227]	More specifically, in the case of the azide-containing PEG derivative, a water<br>
soluble polymer having at least one active hydroxyl moiety undergoes a reaction to produce a substituted polymer having a more reactive moiety, such as a mesylate, tresylate, tosylate or halogen leaving group, thereon. The preparation and use of PEG derivatives containing sulfonyl acid halides, halogen atoms and other leaving groups are well known to the skilled artisan. The resulting substituted polymer then undergoes a reaction to substitute for the more reactive moiety an azide moiety at the terminus of the polymer. Alternatively, a water soluble polymer having at least one active nucleophilic or electrophilic moiety undergoes a reaction with a linking agent that has an azide at one terminus so that a covalent bond is formed between the PEG polymer and the linking agent and the azide moiety is positioned at the terminus of the polymer.    Nucleophilic and electrophilic moieties, including amines,<br><br>
thiols, hydrazides, hydrazines, alcohols, carboxylates, aldehydes, ketones, thioesters and the like, are well known to the skilled artisan.<br>
[228]	More specifically, in the case of the acetylene-containing PEG derivative, a<br>
water soluble polymer having at least one active hydroxyl moiety undergoes a reaction to displace a halogen or other activated leaving group from a precursor that contains an acetylene moiety. Alternatively, a water soluble polymer having at least one active nucleophilic or electrophilic moiety undergoes a reaction with a linking agent that has an acetylene at one terminus so that a covalent bond is formed between the PEG polymer and the linking agent and the acetylene moiety is positioned at the terminus of the polymer. The use of halogen moieties, activated leaving group, nucleophilic and electrophilic moieties in the context of organic synthesis and the preparation and use of PEG derivatives is well established to practitioners in the art.<br>
[229]	The invention also provides a method for the selective modification of<br>
proteins to add other substances to the modified protein, including but not limited to water soluble polymers such as PEG and PEG derivatives containing an azide or acetylene moiety. The azide- and acetylene-containing PEG derivatives can be used to modify the properties of surfaces and molecules where biocompatibility, stability, solubility and lack of immunogenicity are important, while at the same time providing a more selective means of attaching the PEG derivatives to proteins than was previously known in the art.<br>
II.	Antigen-Binding Polypeptides<br>
[230]	There is a wide variety of ABP's.   ABPs are themselves specific for a very<br>
wide variety of antigens. There is also a large number of a very wide variety of ABP fragments that are antigen-specific. ABP therefore is intended to include any polypeptide that demonstrates an ability to specifically bind to a target molecule or antigen- Any known antibody or antibody fragment is an ABP.<br>
[231]	ABP's of the invention may comprise an Fc region or Fc-like region- The Fc<br>
domain provides the link to effector functions such as complement or phagocytic cells. The Fc portion of an immunoglobulin has a long plasma half-life, whereas the Fab is short-lived (Capon, et al. (1989), Nature, 337:525-531). When constructed together with a therapeutic protein, an Fc domain can provide longer half-life or incorporate such functions as Fc receptor binding, protein A binding, complement fixation and perhaps even placental transfer. For example, the Fc region of an IgGl antibody has been fused to the N-terminal end of<br><br>
CD30-L, a molecule which binds CD30 receptors expressed on Hodgkin's Disease tumor cells, anaplastic lymphoma cells, T-cell leukemia cells and other malignant cell types (U.S. Pat. No. 5,480,981). IL-10, an anti-inflammatory and antirejection agent has been fused to murine Fcy2a in order to increase the cytokine's short circulating half-life. Zheng, X. et al. (1995), The Journal of Immunology, 154: 5590-5600. Studies have also evaluated the use of tumor necrosis factor receptor linked with the Fc protein of human IgGl to treat patients with septic shock. Fisher, C. et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 334: 1697-1702 (1996); Van Zee, K. et al., The Journal of Immunology, 156: 2221-2230 (1996) and rheumatoid arthritis (Moreland, et al. (1997), N. Engl. J. Med., 337(3):141-147. Fc has also been fused with CD4 receptor to produce a therapeutic protein for treatment of AIDS (Capon et al. (1989), Nature, 337:525-531). In addition, the N-terminus of interleukin 2 has also been fused to the Fc portion of IgGl or IgG3 to overcome the short half life of interleukin 2 and its systemic toxicity (Harvill et al. (1995), Imraunotechnology, 1: 95-105).<br>
[232]	It is well known that Fc regions of antibodies are made up of monomeric<br>
polypeptide segments that may be linked into dimeric or multimeric forms by disulfide bonds or by non-covalent association. The number of intermolecular disulfide bonds between monomeric subunits of native Fc molecules ranges from 1 to 4 depending on the class (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgE) or subclass (e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgAl, IgGA2) of antibody involved. The term "Fc11 as used herein is generic to the monomeric, dimeric, and multimeric forms of Fc molecules. It should be noted that Fc monomers will spontaneously dimerize when the appropriate Cys residues are present unless particular conditions are present that prevent dimerization through disulfide bond formation. Even if the Cys residues that normally form disulfide bonds in the Fc dimer are removed or replaced by other residues, the monomeric chains will generally dimerize through non-covalent interactions. The term "Fc" herein is used to mean any of these forms: the native monomer, the native dimer (disulfide bond linked), modified dimers (disulfide and/or non-covalently linked), and modified monomers (i.e., derivatives).<br>
[233]	Variants, analogs or derivatives of the Fc portion may be constructed by, for<br>
example, making various substitutions of residues or sequences including non-naturally encoded amino acids. Variant (or analog) polypeptides include insertion variants, wherein one or more amino acid residues supplement an Fc amino acid sequence. Insertions may be located at either or both termini of the protein, or may be positioned within internal regions of the Fc amino acid sequence. Insertional variants with additional residues at either or both<br><br>
termini can include for example, fusion proteins and proteins including amino acid tags or<br>
labels. For example, the Fc molecule may optionally contain an N-terminal Met, especially<br>
when the molecule is expressed recombinantly in a bacterial cell such as E. coli. In Fc<br>
deletion variants, one or more amino acid residues in an Fc polypeptide are removed.<br>
Deletions can be effected at one or both termini of the Fc polypeptide, or with removal of one<br>
or more residues within the Fc amino acid sequence. Deletion variants, therefore, include all<br>
fragments of an Fc polypeptide sequence. In Fc substitution variants, one or more amino acid<br>
residues of an Fc polypeptide are removed and replaced with alternative residues. In one<br>
aspect, the substitutions are conservative in nature, however, the invention embraces<br>
substitutions that are also non-conservative. For example, cysteine residues can be deleted or<br>
replaced with other amino acids to prevent formation of some or all disulfide crosslinks of the<br>
Fc sequences. A protein may have one or more cysteine residues, and one may remove each<br>
of these cysteine residues or substitute one or more such cysteine residues with other amino<br>
acids, such as Ala or Ser, or a non-naturally encoded amino acid. As another example,<br>
modifications may also be made to introduce amino acid substitutions to (1) ablate the Fc<br>
receptor binding site; (2) ablate the complement (Clq) binding site; and/or to (3) ablate the<br>
antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) site. Such sites are known in the art,<br>
and any known substitutions are within the scope of Fc as used herein. For example, see<br>
Molecular Immunology, Vol. 29, No. 5, 633-639 (1992) with regards to ADCC sites in IgGL<br>
Likewise, one or more tyrosine residues can be replaced by phenylalanine residues as well. In<br>
addition, other variant amino acid insertions, deletions (e.g., from 1-25 amino acids) and/or<br>
substitutions are also contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Conservative amino acid substitutions will generally be preferred. Furthermore, alterations<br>
maybe in the form of altered amino acids, such as peptidomimetics or D-amino acids.<br>
[234]	Fc sequences may also be derivatized, i.e., bearing modifications other than<br>
insertion, deletion, or substitution of amino acid residues. Preferably, the modifications are covalent in nature, and include for example, chemical bonding with polymers, lipids, other organic moieties, and inorganic moieties. Derivatives of the invention may be prepared to increase circulating half-life, or may be designed to improve targeting capacity for the polypeptide to desired cells, tissues, or organs. It is also possible to use the salvage receptor binding domain of the intact Fc molecule as the Fc part of the inventive compounds, such as described in WO 96/32478, entitled "Altered Polypeptides with Increased Half-Life". Additional members of the class of molecules designated as Fc herein are those that are<br><br>
described in WO 97/34631, entitled "Immunoglobulin-Like Domains with Increased Half-Lives". Both of the published PCT applications cited in this paragraph are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[235]	Additional ABPs are likely to be discovered in the future.  New ABPs can be<br>
identified through computer-aided secondary and tertiary structure analyses of the predicted<br>
protein sequences, and by selection techniques designed to identify molecules that bind to a<br>
particular target. Such later discovered ABPs also are included within this invention.<br>
[236]	Thus, the description of ABPs is provided for illustrative purposes and by way<br>
of example only and not as a limit on the scope of the methods, compositions, strategies and techniques described herein. Further, reference to ABP's in this application is intended to use the generic term as an example of any ABP. Thus, it is understood that the modifications and chemistries described herein with reference to a specific antigen-binding polypeptide or protein can be equally applied to any antigen-binding polypeptide, including those specifically listed herein.<br>
III.	General Recombinant Nucleic AcidMethods For Use With The Invention<br>
[237]	In numerous embodiments of the present invention, nucleic acids encoding a<br>
ABP of interest will be isolated, cloned and often altered using recombinant methods. Such<br>
embodiments are used, including but not limited to, for protein expression or during the<br>
generation of variants, derivatives, expression cassettes, or other sequences derived from an<br>
antigen-binding polypeptide. In some embodiments, the sequences encoding the<br>
polypeptides of the invention are operably linked to a heterologous promoter.<br>
[238]	A nucleotide sequence encoding an antigen-binding polypeptide comprising a<br>
non-naturally encoded amino acid may be synthesized on the basis of the ainino acid sequence of the parent polypeptide and then changing the nucleotide sequence so as to effect introduction (i.e., incorporation or substitution) or removal (i.e., deletion or substitution) of the relevant amino acid residue(s). The nucleotide sequence may be conveniently modified by site-directed mutagenesis in accordance with conventional methods. Alternatively, the nucleotide sequence may be prepared by chemical synthesis, including but not limited to, by using an oligonucleotide synthesizer, wherein oligonucleotides are designed based on the amino acid sequence of the desired polypeptide, and preferably selecting those codons that are favored in the host cell in which the recombinant polypeptide will be produced. For example, several small oligonucleotides coding for portions of the desired polypeptide may<br><br>
be synthesized and assembled by PCR, ligation or ligation chain reaction. See, e.g., Barany, et aL, Proc. Nad. Acad ScL 88: 189-193 (1991); U.S. Patent 6,521,427 which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>

purposes, including but not limited to, to produce libraries of tRNAs, to produce libraries of synthetases, to produce selector codons, to insert selector codons that encode unnatural amino acids in a protein or polypeptide of interest.

Additional details on many of the above methods can be found in Methods in Enzvmologv Volume 154, which also describes useful controls for trouble-shooting problems with various mutagenesis methods.<br>
[243]	The invention also relates to eukaryotic host cells, non-eukaryotic host cells,<br>
and organisms for the in vivo incorporation of an unnatural amino acid via orthogonal tRNA/RS pairs. Host cells are genetically engineered (including but not limited to, transformed, transduced or transfected) with the polynucleotides of the invention or constructs which include a polynucleotide of the invention, including but not limited to, a<br><br>
vector of the invention, which can be, for example, a cloning vector or an expression vector. The vector can be, for example, in the form of a plasmid, a bacterium, a virus, a naked polynucleotide, or a conjugated polynucleotide. The vectors are introduced into cells and/or microorganisms by standard methods including electroporation (From et al.s Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 5824 (1985), infection by viral vectors, high velocity ballistic penetration by small particles with the nucleic acid either within the matrix of small beads or particles, or on the surface (Klein et al., Nature 327, 70-73 (1987)).<br>
[244]	The engineered host cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media<br>
modified as appropriate for such activities as, for example, screening steps, activating promoters or selecting transformants. These cells can optionally be cultured into transgenic organisms.

[245]	Several well-known methods of introducing target nucleic acids into cells are<br>
available, any of which can be used in the invention. These include: fusion of the recipient cells with bacterial protoplasts containing the DNA, electroporation, projectile bombardment, and infection with viral vectors (discussed further, below), etc. Bacterial cells can be used to amplify the number of plasmids containing DNA constructs of this invention. The bacteria are grown to log phase and the plasmids within the bacteria can be isolated by a variety of methods known in the art (see, for instance, Sambrook). In addition, a plethora of kits are commercially available for the purification of plasmids from bacteria, (see, e.g., EasyPrep™, FlexiPrep™, both from Pharmacia Biotech; StrataClean™ from Stratagene; and, QIAprep™ from Qiagen). The isolated and purified plasmids are then further manipulated to produce other plasmids, used to transfect cells or incorporated into related vectors to infect organisms. Typical vectors contain transcription and translation terminators, transcription and translation initiation sequences, and promoters useful for regulation of the expression of the particular target nucleic acid.  The vectors optionally comprise generic expression cassettes containing<br><br>
at least one independent terminator sequence, sequences permitting replication of the cassette in eukaryotes, or prokaryotes, or both, (including but not limited to, shuttle vectors) and selection markers for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Vectors are suitable for replication and integration in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, or preferably both. See, Giliman &amp; Smith, Gene 8:81 (1979); Roberts, et al, Nature, 328:731 (1987); Schneider, B., et al, Protein Expr. Purif. 6435:10 (1995); Ausubel, Sambrook, Berger (all supra). A catalogue of bacteria and bacteriophages useful for cloning is provided, e.g., by the ATCC, e.g., The ATCC Catalogue of Bacteria and Bacteriophage (1992) Gherna et al. (eds) published by the ATCC. Additional basic procedures for sequencing, cloning and other aspects of molecular biology and underlying theoretical considerations are also found in Watson et al (1992) Recombinant DNA Second Edition Scientific American Books, NY. In addition, essentially any nucleic acid (and virtually any labeled nucleic acid, whether standard or non-standard) can be custom or standard ordered from any of a variety of commercial sources, such as the Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX available on the World Wide Web at mcrc.com), The Great American Gene Company (Ramona, CA available on the World Wide Web at genco.com), ExpressGen Inc. (Chicago, IL available on the World Wide Web at expressgen.com), Operon Technologies Inc. (Alameda, CA) and many others.<br>
SELECTOR CODONS<br>
[246]	Selector codons of the invention expand the genetic codon framework of<br>
protein biosynthetic machinery. For example, a selector codon includes, but is not limited to, a unique three base codon, a nonsense codon, such as a stop codon, including but not limited to, an amber codon (UAG), or an opal codon (UGA), an unnatural codon, a four or more base codon, a rare codon, or the like. It is readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that there is a wide range in the number of selector codons that can be introduced into a desired gene, including but not limited to, one or more, two or more, more than three, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more in a single polynucleotide encoding at least a portion of ABP.<br>
[247]	In one embodiment, the methods involve the use of a selector codon that is a<br>
stop codon for the incorporation of unnatural amino acids in vivo in a eukaryotic cell. For example, an O-tRNA is produced that recognizes the stop codon, including but not limited to, UAG, and is aminoacylated by an O-RS with a desired unnatural amino acid. This O-tRNA is not recognized by the naturally occurring host's aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Conventional site-directed mutagenesis can be used to introduce the stop codon, including<br><br>
but not limited to, TAG, at the site of interest in a polypeptide of interest. See, e.g., Sayers, J.R., et al. (1988), 5\3' Exonuclease in phosphorothioate-based oligomicleotide-directed mutagenesis. Nucleic Acids Res, 791-802. When the O-RS, O-tRNA and the nucleic acid that encodes the polypeptide of interest are combined in vivo, the unnatural amino acid is incorporated in response to the UAG codon to give a polypeptide containing the unnatural amino acid at the specified position.<br>
[248]	The incorporation of unnatural amino acids in vivo can be done without<br>
significant perturbation of the eukaryotic host cell. For example, because the suppression efficiency for the UAG codon depends upon the competition between the O-tRNA, including but not limited to, the amber suppressor tRNA, and a eukaryotic release factor (including but not limited to, eRF) (which binds to a stop codon and initiates release of the growing peptide from the ribosome), the suppression efficiency can be modulated by, including but not limited to, increasing the expression level of  O-tRNA, and/or the suppressor tRNA.<br>
[249]	Selector codons also comprise extended codons, including but not limited to,<br>
four or more base codons, such as, four, five, six or more base codons. Examples of four base codons include, including but not limited to, AGGA, CUAG, UAGA, CCCU and the like. Examples of five base codons include, but are not limited to, AGGAC, CCCCU, CCCUC, CUAGA, CUACU, UAGGC and the like. A feature of the invention includes using extended codons based on frameshift suppression. Four or more base codons can insert, including but not limited to, one or multiple unnatural amino acids into the same protein. For example, in the presence of mutated O-tRNAs, including but not limited to, a special frameshift suppressor tRNAs, with anticodon loops, for example, with at least 8-10 nt anticodon loops, the four or more base codon is read as single amino acid. In other embodiments, the anticodon loops can decode, including but not limited to, at least a four-base codon, at least a five-baSe codon, or at least a six-base codon or more. Since there are 256 possible four-base codons, multiple unnatural amino acids can be encoded in the same cell using a four or more base codon. See, Anderson et al., (2002) Exploring the Limits of Codon and Anticodon Size, Chemistry and Biology, 9:237-244; Magliery, (2001) Expanding the Genetic Code: Selection of Efficient Suppressors of Four-base Codons and Identification of "Shifty" Four-base Codons with a Library Approach in Escherichia coli, J. Mol. Biol. 307: 755-769.<br><br>
[250]	For example, four-base codons have been used to incorporate unnatural amino<br>
acids into proteins using in vitro biosynthetic methods. See, e.g., Ma et al., (1993) Biochemistry, 32:7939; and Hohsaka et al., (1999) J. Am. Chem, Soc, 121:34. CGGG and AGGU were used to simultaneously incorporate 2-naphthylalanine and an NBD derivative of lysine into streptavidin in vitro with two chemically acylated frameshift suppressor tRNAs. See, e.g., Hohsaka et al., (1999) J. Am. Chem. Soc 121:12194. In an in vivo study, Moore et al. examined the ability of tRNALeu derivatives with NCUA anticodons to suppress UAGN codons (N can be U, A, G, or C), and found that the quadruplet UAGA can be decoded by a tRNALeu with a UCUA anticodon with an efficiency of 13 to 26% with little decoding in the 0 or -1 frame. See, Moore et al., (2000) J. Mol, Biol, 298:195. In one embodiment, extended codons based on rare codons or nonsense codons can be used in the present invention, which can reduce missense readthrough and frameshift suppression at other unwanted sites.<br>
[251]	For a given system, a selector codon can also include one of the natural three<br>
base codons, where the endogenous system does not use (or rarely uses) the natural base codon. For example, this includes a system that is lacking a tRNA that recognizes the natural three base codon, and/or a system where the three base codon is a rare codon.<br>
[252]	Selector codons optionally include unnatural base pairs. These unnatural base<br>
pairs further expand the existing genetic alphabet One extra base pair increases the number of triplet codons from 64 to 125. Properties of third base pairs include stable and selective base pairing, efficient enzymatic incorporation into DNA with high fidelity by a polymerase, and the efficient continued primer extension after synthesis of the nascent unnatural base pair. Descriptions of unnatural base pairs which can be adapted for methods and compositions include, e.g., Hirao, et al., (2002) An unnatural base pair for incorporating amino add analogues into protein, Nature Biotechnology. 20:177-182. Other relevant publications are listed below.<br>
[253]	For in vivo usage, the unnatural nucleoside is membrane permeable and is<br>
phosphorylated to form the corresponding triphosphate. In addition, the increased genetic information is stable and not destroyed by cellular enzymes. Previous efforts by Benner and others took advantage of hydrogen bonding patterns that are different from those in canonical Watson-Crick pairs, the most noteworthy example of which is the iso-C:iso-G pair. See, e.g., Switzer et al., (1989) J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 111:8322; and Piccirilli et al., (1990) Nature,<br><br>
343:33; Kool, (2000) Curr. Opin. Chem, Biol., 4:602. These bases in general mispair to some degree with natural bases and cannot be enzymatically replicated. Kool and co-workers demonstrated that hydrophobic packing interactions between bases can replace hydrogen bonding to drive the formation of base pair. See, Kool, (2000) Curr, Opin. Chem. Biol.. 4:602; and Guckian and Kool, (1998) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Eng.,  36, 2825. In an effort to develop an unnatural base pair satisfying all the above requirements, Schultz, Romesberg and co-workers have systematically synthesized and studied a series of unnatural hydrophobic bases. A PICS:PICS self-pair is found to be more stable than natural base pairs, and can be efficiently incorporated into DNA by Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (KF). See, e.g., McMinn et al., (1999) J. Am. Chem. Soc, 121:11586; and Ogawa et al., (2000) J. Am. Chem. Soc, 122:3274. A 3MN:3MN self-pair can be synthesized by KF with efficiency and selectivity sufficient for biological function. See, e.g., Ogawa et al., (2000) X, Am. Chem. Soc, 122:8803. However, both bases act as a chain terminator for further replication. A mutant DNA polymerase has been recently evolved that can be used to replicate the PICS self pair. In addition, a 7AI self pair can be replicated. See, e.g., Tae et al., (2001) J. Am. Chem. Soc, 123:7439. A novel metallobase pair, Dipic:Py, has also been developed, which forms a stable pair upon binding Cu(II). See, Meggers et al., (2000) J. Am. Chem. Soc, 122:10714. Because extended codons and unnatural codons are intrinsically orthogonal to natural codons, the methods of the invention can take advantage of this property to generate orthogonal tRNAs for them.<br>
[254]	A translational bypassing system can also be used to incorporate an unnatural<br>
amino acid in a desired polypeptide. In a translational bypassing system, a large sequence is incorporated into a gene but is not translated into protein. The sequence contains a structure that serves as a cue to induce the ribosome to hop over the sequence and resume translation downstream of the insertion.<br>
[255]	In certain embodiments, the protein or polypeptide of interest (or portion<br>
thereof) in the methods and/or compositions of the invention is encoded by a nucleic acid. Typically, the nucleic acid comprises at least one selector codon, at least two selector codons, at least three selector codons, at least four selector codons, at least five selector codons, at least six selector codons, at least seven selector codons, at least eight selector codons, at least nine selector codons, ten or more selector codons.<br><br>
[256]	Genes coding for proteins or polypeptides of interest can be mutagenized<br>
using methods well-known to one of skill in the art and described herein to include, for example, one or more selector codon for the incorporation of an unnatural amino acid. For example, a nucleic acid for a protein of interest is mutagenized to include one or more selector codon, providing for the incorporation of one or more unnatural amino acids. The invention includes any such variant, including but not limited to, mutant, versions of any protein, for example, including at least one unnatural amino acid. Similarly, the invention also includes corresponding nucleic acids, i.e., any nucleic acid with one or more selector codon that encodes one or more unnatural amino acid.<br>
[257]	Nucleic acid molecules encoding a protein of interest such as ABP may be<br>
readily mutated to introduce a cysteine at any desired position of the polypeptide. Cysteine is widely used to introduce reactive molecules, water soluble polymers, proteins, or a wide variety of other molecules, onto a protein of interest. Methods suitable for the incorporation of cysteine into a desired position of the antigen-binding polypeptide are well known in the art, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 6,608,183, which is incorporated by reference herein, and standard mutagenesis techniques.<br>
IK	Non-Naturally Encoded Amino Acids<br>
[258]	A very wide variety of non-naturally encoded amino acids are suitable for use<br>
in the present invention. Any number of non-naturally encoded amino acids can be introduced into ABP. In general, the introduced non-naturally encoded amino acids are substantially chemically inert toward the 20 common, genetically-encoded amino acids (i.e., alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine). In some embodiments, the non-naturally encoded amino acids include side chain functional groups that react efficiently and selectively with functional groups not found in the 20 common amino acids (including but not limited to, azido, ketone, aldehyde and aminooxy groups) to form stable conjugates. For example, antigen-binding polypeptide that includes a non-naturally encoded amino acid containing an azido functional group can be reacted with a polymer (including but not limited to, poly(ethylene glycol) or, alternatively, a second polypeptide containing an alkyne moiety to form a stable conjugate resulting for the selective reaction of the azide and the alkyne functional groups to form a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition product.<br><br>
[259]	The generic structure of an alpha-amino acid is illustrated as follows (Formula<br>
I): <br>
[260]	A non-naturally encoded amino acid is typically any structure having the<br>
above-listed formula wherein the R group is any substituent other than one used in the twenty natural amino acids, and may be suitable for use in the present invention. Because the non-naturally encoded amino acids of the invention typically differ from the natural amino acids only in the structure of the side chain, the non-naturally encoded amino acids form amide bonds with other amino acids, including but not limited to, natural or non-naturally encoded, in the same manner in which they are formed in naturally occurring polypeptides. However, the non-naturally encoded amino acids have side chain groups that distinguish them from the natural amino acids. For example, R optionally comprises an alkyl-, aryl-, acyl-, keto-, azido-, hydroxyl-, hydrazine, cyano-, halo-, hydrazide, alkenyl, alkynl, ether, thiol, seleno-, sulfonyl-, borate, boronate, phospho, phosphono, phosphine, heterocyclic, enone, inline, aldehyde, ester, thioacid, hydroxylamine, amino group, or the like or any combination thereof. Other non-naturally occurring amino acids of interest that may be suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, amino acids comprising a photoactivatable cross-linker, spin-labeled amino acids, fluorescent amino acids, metal binding amino acids, metal-containing amino acids, radioactive- amino acids, amino acids with novel functional groups, amino acids that covalently or noncovalently interact with other molecules, photocaged and/or photoisomerizable amino acids, amino acids comprising biotin or a biotin analogue, glycosylated amino acids such as a sugar substituted serine. other carbohydrate modified amino acids, keto-containing amino acids, amino acids comprising polyethylene glycol or polyether, heavy atom substituted amino acids, chemically cleavable and/or photocleavable amino acids3 amino acids with an elongated side chains as compared to natural amino acids, including but not limited to, polyethers or long chain hydrocarbons, including but not limited to, greater than about 5 or greater than about 10 carbons, carbon-linked sugar-containing amino acids, redox-active amino acids, amino thioacid containing amino acids, and amino acids comprising one or more toxic moiety.<br><br>
[261]	Exemplary non-naturally encoded amino acids that may be suitable for use in<br>
the present invention and that are useful for reactions with water soluble polymers include,<br>
but are not limited to, those with carbonyl, aminooxy, hydrazine, hydrazide, semicarbazide,<br>
azide and alkyne reactive groups. In some embodiments, non-naturally encoded amino acids<br>
comprise a saccharide moiety. Examples of such amino acids include 7V-acetyl-L-<br>
glucosaminyl-L-serine, N-acetyl-L-galactosaminyl-L-serine, Af-acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-<br>
threonine, N-acetyl-L-glucosaminyl-L-asparagine and O-mannosaminyl-L-serine. Examples<br>
of such amino acids also include examples where the natuxally-occuring N- or O- linkage<br>
between the amino acid and the saccharide is replaced by a covalent linkage not commonly<br>
found in nature - including but not limited to, an alkene, an oxime, a thioether, an amide and<br>
the like. Examples of such amino acids also include saccharides that are not commonly<br>
found in naturally-occuring proteins such as 2-deoxy-glucose, 2-deoxygalactose and the like.<br>
[262]	Many  of the  non-naturally  encoded  amino   acids  provided  herein   are<br>
commercially available, e.g., from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), Novabiochem (a division of EMD Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany), or Peptech (Burlington, MA, USA). Those that are not commercially available are optionally synthesized as provided herein or using standard methods known to those of skill in the art. For organic synthesis techniques, see, e.g., Organic Chemistry by Fessendon and Fessendon, (1982, Second Edition, Willard Grant Press, Boston Mass.); Advanced Organic Chemistry by March (Third Edition, 1985, Wiley and Sons, New York); and Advanced Organic Chemistry by Carey and Sundberg (Third Edition, Parts A and B, 1990, Plenum Press, New York). See, abo, U.S. Patent Application Publications 2003/0082575 and 2003/0108885, which is incorporated by reference herein. In addition to unnatural amino acids that contain novel side chains, unnatural amino acids that may be suitable for use in the present invention also optionally comprise modified backbone structures, including but not limited to, as illustrated by the structures of Formula II and HI:<br><br><br><br><br>
phenylalanines, where the substituent comprises, including but not limited to, a hydroxy group, a methoxy group, a methyl group, an allyl group, an aldehyde, an azido, an iodo, a bromo, a keto group (including but not limited to, an acetyl group), a benzoyl, an alkynyl group, or the like. Specific examples of unnatural amino acids that may be suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, a p-acetyl-L- phenylalanine, an O-methyl-L-tyrosine, an L-3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, a 3-methyl-phenylalanine, an O-4-allyl-L-tyrosine, a 4-propyl-L-tyrosine, a tri-O-acetyl-GlcNAc(3-serine, an L-Dopa, a fluorinated phenylalanine, an isopropyl-L-phenylalanine, a P-azido-L-phenylalanine, a p-acyl-L-phenylalanine, a p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine, an L-phosphoserine, a phosphonoserine, a phosphonotyrosine, a P-iodo-phenylalanine, a P-bromophenylalanine, a P-amino-L-phenylalanine, an isopropyl-L-phenylalanine, and a p-propargyloxy-phenylalanine, and the like. Examples of structures of a variety of unnatural amino acids that may be suitable for use in the present invention are provided in, for example, WO 2002/085923 entitled "In vivo incorporation of unnatural amino acids." See also Kiick et al., (2002) Incorporation of azides into recombinant proteins for chemoselective modification by the Staudinger ligation, PNAS 99:19-24, for additional methionine analogs.<br>
[264]	In one embodiment, compositions of ABP that include an unnatural ammo<br>
acid (such as p-(propargyloxy)-phenyalanine) are provided. Various compositions comprising P-(propargyloxy)-phenyalanine and, including but not limited to, proteins and/or cells, are also provided. In one aspect, a composition that includes the P-(propargyloxy)-phenyalanine unnatural amino acid, further includes an orthogonal tRNA. The unnatural amino acid can be bonded (including but not limited to, covalently) to the orthogonal tRNA, including but not limited to, covalently bonded to the orthogonal tRNA though an amino-acyl bond, covalently bonded to a 3'OH or a 2'OH of a terminal ribose sugar of the orthogonal tRNA, etc.<br>
[265]	The chemical moieties via unnatural amino acids that can be incorporated into<br>
proteins offer a variety of advantages and manipulations of the protein. For example, the unique reactivity of a keto functional group allows selective modification of proteins with any of a number of hydrazine- or hydroxylamine-containing reagents in vitro and in vivo. A heavy atom unnatural amino acid, for example, can be useful for phasing X-ray structure data. The site-specific introduction of heavy atoms using unnatural amino acids also provides selectivity and flexibility in choosing positions for heavy atoms.   Photoreactive unnatural<br><br>
amino acids (including but not limited to, amino acids with benzophenone and arylazides (including but not limited to, phenylazide) side chains), for example, allow for efficient in vivo and in vitro photocrosslinldng of protein. Examples of photoreactive unnatural amino acids include, but are not limited to, p-azido-phenylalanine and p-benzoyl-phenylalanine. The protein with the photoreactive unnatural amino acids can then be crosslinked at will by excitation of the photoreactive group-providing temporal control. In one example, the methyl group of an unnatural amino can be substituted with an isotopically labeled, including but not limited to, methyl group, as a probe of local structure and dynamics, including but not limited to, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance and vibrational spectroscopy. AUcynyl or azido functional groups, for example, allow the selective modification of proteins with molecules through a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction.<br>
[266]	A non-natural amino acid incorporated into a polypeptide at the amino<br>
terminus can be composed of an R group that is any substituent other than one used in the twenty natural amino acids and a 2nd reactive group different from the NH2 group normally present in a-amino acids (see Formula I). A similar non-natural amino acid can be incorporated at the carboxyl terminus with a 2nd reactive group different from the COOH group normally present in a-amino acids (see Formula I).<br>

[267]	Many of the unnatural amino acids suitable for use in the present invention are<br>
commercially available, e.g., from Sigma (USA) or Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). Those that are not commercially available are optionally synthesized as provided herein or as provided in various publications or using standard methods known to those of skill in the art.

A.	Carbonyl reactive groups<br>
[268]	Amino acids with a carbonyl reactive group allow for a variety of reactions to<br>
link molecules (including but not limited to, PEG or other water soluble molecules) via<br>
nucleophilic addition or aldol condensation reactions among others.<br>
[269]	Exemplary carbonyl-containing amino acids can be represented as follows:<br><br>
wherein n is 0-10; Ri is an alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl, or substituted aryl; R2 is H, alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl, and substituted aryl; and R3 is H, an amino acid, a polypeptide, or an amino terminus modification group, and R4 is H, an amino acid, a polypeptide, or a carboxy terminus modification group. In some embodiments, n is 1, Ri is phenyl and R2 is a simple alkyl (i.e., methyl, ethyl, or propyl) and the ketone moiety is positioned in ihepara position relative to the alkyl side chain. In some embodiments, n is 1, Ri is phenyl and R2 is a simple alkyl (i.e., methyl, ethyl, or propyl) and the ketone moiety is positioned in the meta position relative to the alkyl side chain.<br><br><br><br>
B.	Hydrazine, hydrazide or semicarbazide reactive groups<br>
[274]	Non-naturally encoded ammo acids containing a nucleophilic group, such as a<br>
hydrazine, hydrazide or semicarbazide, allow for reaction with a variety of electrophilic<br>
groups to form conjugates (including but not limited to, with PEG or other water soluble<br>
polymers).<br>
[275]	Exemplary hydrazine, hydrazide or semicarbazide -containing amino acids can<br>
be represented as follows:<br>
wherein n is 0-10; Ri is an alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl, or substituted aryl or not present; X, is O, N, or S or not present; R2 is H, an amino acid, a polypeptide, or an amino terminus modification group, and R3 is H, an amino acid, a polypeptide, or a carboxy terminus modification group.<br>
[276]	to some embodiments, n is 4, Ri is not present, and X is N.    In some<br>
embodiments, n is 2, Ri is not present, and X is not present. In some embodiments, n is 1, Ri is phenyl, X is O, and the oxygen atom is positioned para to the alphatic group on the aryl ring.<br>
[277]	Hydrazide-,   hydrazine-,   and  semicarbazide-containing   amino   acids   are<br>
available from commercial sources. For instance, L-glutamate-y-hydrazide is available from Sigma Chemical (St Louis, MO). Other amino acids not available commercially can be prepared by one skilled in the art See, e.g., U.S. Pat No. 6,281,211, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[278]	Polypeptides   containing   non-naturally   encoded   amino   acids   that   bear<br>
hydrazide, hydrazine or semicarbazide functionalities can be reacted efficiently and selectively with a variety of molecules that contain aldehydes or other functional groups with similar chemical reactivity. See, e.g., Shao, J. and Tarn, J., J. Am. Chan. Soc. 117:3893-3899 (1995). The unique reactivity of hydrazide, hydrazine and semicarbazide functional groups makes them significantly more reactive toward aldehydes, ketones and other electrophilic groups as compared to the nucleophilic groups present on the 20 common amino acids (including but not limited to, the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine or the amino groups of lysine and the N-terminus).<br>
C.	Aminooxy-containing amino acids<br><br>
[279]	Non-naturally encoded amino acids containing an aminooxy (also called a<br>
hydroxylamine) group allow for reaction with a variety of electrophilic groups to form conjugates (including but not limited to, with PEG or other water soluble polymers). Like hydrazines, hydrazides and semicarbazides, the enhanced nucleophilicity of the aminooxy group permits it to react efficiently and selectively with a variety of molecules that contain aldehydes or other functional groups with similar chemical reactivity. See, e.g., Shao, J. and Tana, J., 1 Am. Chem. Soc. 117:3893-3899 (1995); H. Hang and C. Bertozzi, Ace. Chem. Res. 34: 727-736 (2001). Whereas the result of reaction with a hydrazine group is the corresponding hydrazone, however, an oxime results generally from the reaction of an aminooxy group with a carbonyl-containing group such as a ketone.<br>
[280]	Exemplary amino acids containing aminooxy groups can be represented as<br>
follows:<br><br>
wherein n is 0-10; Ri is an alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl, or substituted aryl or not present; X is O3 N3 S or not present; m is 0-10; Y = C(O) or not present; R2 is H, an amino acid, a polypeptide, or an amino terminus modification group, and R3 is H, an amino acid, a polypeptide, or a carboxy terminus modification group. In some embodiments, n is 15 Ri is phenyl, X is O, m is 1, and Y is present. In some embodiments, n is 2, Ri and X are not present, m is 0, and Y is not present,<br>
[281]	Aminooxy-containing amino acids can be prepared from readily available<br>
amino acid precursors (homoserine, serine and threonine). See, e.g., M. Carrasco and R.<br>
Brown, J. Org. Chem, 68: 8853-8858 (2003). Certain aminooxy-containing amino acids,<br>
such as L-2-amino-4-(aminooxy)butyric acid), have been isolated from natural sources<br>
(RosenthaL, G. et al., Life Sci. 60: 1635-1641 (1997). Other aminooxy-containing amino<br>
acids can be prepared by one skilled in the art.<br>
D.	Azide and alkyne reactive groups<br>
[282]	The unique reactivity of azide and alkyne functional groups makes them<br>
extremely useful for the selective modification of polypeptides and other biological molecules. Organic azides, particularly alphatic azides, and alkynes are generally stable toward common reactive chemical conditions. In particular, both the azide and the alkyne functional groups are inert toward the side chains (i.e., R groups) of the 20 common amino acids  found in naturally-occuring polypeptides.     When brought into  close proximity,<br><br>
however, the "spring-loaded" nature of the azide and alkyne groups is revealed and they react selectively and efficiently via Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition reaction to generate the corresponding triazole. See, e.g., Chin J., et al.,  Science 301:964-7 (2003); Wang, Q., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 3192-3193 (2003); Chin, J. W., et al.,  J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124:9026-9027 (2002).<br>
[283]	Because the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction involves a selective cycloaddition<br>
reaction {see, e.g., Padwa, A., in COMPREHENSIVE ORGANIC SYNTHESIS, Vol. 4, (ed. Trost, B.<br>
M., 1991), p. 1069-1109; Huisgen, R. in 1,3-DPOLAR CYCLOADDITION CHEMISTRY, (ed.<br>
Padwa, A., 1984), p. 1-176) rather than a nucleophilic substitution, the incorporation of non-<br>
naturally encoded amino acids bearing azide and alkyne-containing side chains permits the<br>
resultant polypeptides to be modified selectively at the position of the non-naturally encoded<br>
amino acid. Cycloaddition reaction involving azide or alkyne-containing ABP can be carried<br>
out at room temperature under aqueous conditions by the addition of Cu(II) (including but not<br>
limited to, in the form of a catalytic amount of CuSCU) in the presence of a reducing agent for<br>
reducing Cu(II) to Cu(T), in situ, in catalytic amount. See, e.g.9 Wang, Q., et al.,  J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 125, 3192-3193 (2003); Tornoe, C. W., et al., J. Org. Chem. 67:3057-3064<br>
(2002); Rostovtsev, et aL9 Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41:2596-2599 (2002). Exemplary reducing<br>
agents include, including but not limited to, ascorbate, metallic copper, quinine,<br>
hydroquinone, vitamin K, glutathione, cysteine, Fe , Co , and an applied electric potential.<br>
[284]	In some cases, where a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between an azide<br>
and an alkyne is desired, the antigen-binding polypeptide comprises a non-naturally encoded gmino acid comprising an alkyne moiety and the water soluble polymer to be attached to the amino acid comprises an azide moiety. Alternatively, the converse reaction (i.e., with the azide moiety on the amino acid and the alkyne moiety present on the water soluble polymer) can also be performed.<br>
[285]	The azide functional group can also be reacted selectively with a water soluble<br>
polymer containing an aryl ester and appropriately functionalized with an aryl phosphine moiety to generate an amide linkage. The aryl phosphine group reduces the azide in situ and the resulting amine then reacts efficiently with a proximal ester linkage to generate the corresponding amide. See, e.g., E. Saxon and C. Bertozzi, Science 287, 2007-2010 (2000). The azide-containing amino acid can be either an alkyl azide (including but not limited to, 2-amino-6-azido-l-hexanoic acid) or an aryl azide (p-azido-phenylalanine).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
See, e.g., Advanced Organic Chemistry by March (Third Edition, 1985, Wiley and Sons, New York).<br>
E.	Aminothiol reactive groups<br>
[292]	The unique reactivity of beta-substituted aminothiol functional groups makes<br>
them extremely useful for the selective modification of polypeptides and other biological molecules that contain aldehyde groups via formation of the thiazolidine. See, e.g., J. Shao and J. Tain, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117 (14) 3893-3899. In some embodiments, beta-substituted aminothiol amino acids can be incorporated into ABP polypeptides and then reacted with water soluble polymers comprising an aldehyde functionality. In some embodiments, a water soluble polymer, drug conjugate or other payload can be coupled to a ABP polypeptide comprising a beta-substituted aminothiol amino acid via formation of the thiazolidine.<br>
CELLULAR UPTAKE OF UNNATURAL AMINO ACIDS<br>
[293]	Unnatural amino acid uptake by a eukaryotic cell is one issue that is typically<br>
considered when designing and selecting unnatural amino acids, including but not limited to, for incorporation into a protein. For example, the high charge density of α-amino acids suggests that these compounds are unlikely to be cell permeable. Natural ammo acids are taken up into the eukaryotic cell via a collection of protein-based transport systems. A rapid screen can be done which assesses which unnatural amino acids, if any, are taken up by cells. See, e.g., the toxicity assays in, e.g., the applications entitled "Protein Arrays," filed December 22, 2003, serial number 10/744,899 and serial number 60/435,821 filed on Decembea: 22, 2002; and Liu, D.R. &amp; Schultz, P.G. (1999) Progress toward the evolution of an organism with an expanded genetic code. PNAS United States 96:4780-4785. Although uptake is easily analyzed with various assays, an alternative to designing unnatural amino acids that are amenable to cellular uptake pathways is to provide biosynthetic pathways to create amino acids in vivo.<br>
BIOSYNTHESIS OF UNNATURAL AMINO ACIDS<br>
[294]	Many biosynthetic pathways already exist in cells for the production of amino<br>
acids and other compounds. While a biosynthetic method for a particular unnatural amino acid may not exist in nature, including but not limited to, in a eukaryotic cell, the invention provides such methods. For example, biosynthetic pathways for unnatural amino acids are optionally generated in host cell by adding new enzymes or modifying existing host cell pathways. Additional new enzymes are optionally naturally occurring enzymes or artificially<br><br>
evolved enzymes. For example, the biosynthesis of Paminophenylalanine (as presented in an example in WO 2002/085923 entitled "In vivo incorporation of unnatural amino acids") relies on the addition of a combination of known enzymes from other organisms. The genes for these enzymes can be introduced into a eukaryotic cell by transforming the cell with a plasmid comprising the genes. The genes, when expressed in the cell, provide an enzymatic pathway to synthesize the desired compound. Examples of the types of enzymes that are optionally added are provided in the examples below. Additional enzymes sequences are found, for example, in Genbank. Artificially evolved enzymes are also optionally added into a cell in the same manner. In this manner, the cellular machinery and resources of a cell are manipulated to produce unnatural amino acids.<br>
[295]	A variety of methods are available for producing novel enzymes for use in<br>
biosynthetic pathways or for evolution of existing pathways. For example, recursive recombination, including but not limited to, as developed by Maxygen, Inc. (available on the World Wide Web at maxygen.com), is optionally used to develop novel enzymes and pathways. See, e.g., Stemmer (1994), Rapid evolution of a protein in vitro by DNA shuffling, Nature 370(4):389-391; and, Stemmer, (1994), DNA shuffling by random fragmentation and reassembly: In vitro recombination for molecular evolution, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA.. 91:10747-10751. Similarly DesignPath™, developed by Genencor (available on the World Wide Web at genencor.com) is optionally used for metabolic pathway engineering, including but not limited to, to engineer a pathway to create O-methyl-L-tyrosine in a cell. This technology reconstructs existing pathways in host organisms using a combination of new genes, including but not limited to, identified through functional genomics, and molecular evolution and design. Diversa Corporation (available on the World Wide Web at diversa.com) also provides technology for rapidly screening libraries of genes and gene pathways, including but not limited to, to create new pathways.<br>
[296]	Typically, the unnatural amino acid produced with an engineered biosynthetic<br>
pathway of the invention is produced in a concentration sufficient for efficient protein biosynthesis, including but not limited to, a natural cellular amount, but not to such a degree as to affect the concentration of the other amino acids or exhaust cellular resources. Typical concentrations produced in vivo in this manner are about 10 mM to about 0.05 mM. Once a cell is transformed with a plasmid comprising the genes used to produce enzymes desired for a specific pathway and an unnatural amino acid is generated, in vivo selections are optionally<br><br>
used to further optimize the production of the unnatural amino acid for both ribosomal protein synthesis and cell growth.<br>
POLYPEPTIDES WITH UNNATURAL AMINO ACIDS<br>
[297]	The incorporation of an unnatural amino acid can be done for a variety of<br>
purposes, including but not limited to, tailoring changes in protein structure and/or function, changing size, acidity, nucleophilicity, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobicity, accessibility of protease target sites, targeting to a moiety (including but not limited to, for a protein array), adding a biologically active molecule, attaching a polymer, attaching a radionuclide, modulating serum half-life, modulating tissue penetration (e.g. tumors), modulating active transport, modulating tissue, cell or organ specificity, modulating immunogenicity, modulating protease resistance, etc. Proteins that include an unnatural amino acid can have enhanced or even entirely new catalytic or biophysical properties. For example, the following properties are optionally modified by inclusion of an unnatural amino acid into a protein: toxicity, biodistribution, structural properties, spectroscopic properties, chemical and/or photochemical properties, catalytic ability, half-life (including but not limited to, ssnnn half-life), ability to react with other molecules, including but not limited to, covalently or noncovalently, and the like. The compositions including proteins that include at least one uunnatural ami-no acid are useful for, including but not limited to, novel therapeutics, diagnostics, catalytic enzymes, industrial enzymes, binding proteins (including but not limited to, antibodies), and including but not limited to, the study of protein structure and SmetioiL See, e.g., Dougherty, (2000) Unnatural Amino Acids as Probes of Protein Structure and Function, Current Opinion in Chemical Biology, 4:645-652.<br>
[298]	In one aspect of the invention, a composition includes at least one protein with<br>
at least one, including but not limited to, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, at least seven, at least eight, at least nine, or at least ten or more unnatural amino acids. The unnatural amino acids can be the same or different, including but not limited to, there can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more different sites in the protein that comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more different unnatural amino acids. In another aspect, a composition includes a protein with at least one, but fewer than all, of a particular amino acid present in the protein is substituted with the unnatural amino acid. For a given protein with more than one unnatural amino acids, the unnatural amino acids can be identical or different (including but not limited to, the protein can include two or more different types of unnatural<br><br>
ammo acids, or can include two of the same unnatural amino acid). For a given protein with more than two unnatural amino acids, the unnatural amino acids can be the same, different or a combination of a multiple unnatural amino acid of the same kind with at least one different unnatural amino acid.<br>
[299]	ABP's of interest with at least one unnatural amino acid are a feature of the<br>
invention. The invention also includes polypeptides or proteins with at least one unnatural amino acid produced using the compositions and methods of the invention. An excipient (including but not limited to, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient) can also be present with the protein.<br>
[300]	By producing proteins or polypeptides of interest with at least one unnatural<br>
amino acid in eukaryotic cells, proteins or polypeptides will typically include eukaryotic post-translational modifications. In certain embodiments, a protein includes at least one unnatural amino acid and at least one post-translational modification that is made in vivo by a eukaryotic cell, where the post-translational modification is not made by a prokaryotic cell. For example, the post-translation modification includes, including but not limited to, acetylatioa, acylation, lipid-modification, palmitoylation, palmitate addition, phosphorylation, glycolipid-linkage modification, glycosylation, and the like. In one aspect, the post-translational modification includes attachment of an oligosaccharide (including but not limited to, (GlcNAc-Man)2-Man-GlcNAc-GlcNAc)) to an asparagine by a GlcNAc-asparagine linkage. See Table 1 which lists some examples of N-linked oligosaccharides of eukaryotic proteins (additional residues can also be present, which are not shown). In another aspect, the post-translational modification includes attachment of an oligosaccharide (including but not limited to, Gal-GalNAc, Gal-GlcNAc, etc.) to a serine or threonine by a GalNAc-serine or GalNAc-threonine linkage, or a GlcNAc-serine or a GlcNAc-threonine linkage.<br><br><br><br>
[301]	In yet another aspect, the post-translation modification includes proteolytic<br>
processing of precursors (including but not limited to, calcitonin precursor, calcitonin gene-related peptide precursor, preproparathyroid hormone, preproinsulin, proinsulin, prepro-opiomelanocortin, pro-opiomelanocortin and the like), assembly into a multisubunit protein or macromolecular assembly, translation to another site in the cell (including but not limited to, to organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, the nucleus, lysosomes, peroxisomes, mitochondria, chloroplasts, vacuoles, etc., or through the secretory padiway). In certain embodiments, the protein comprises a secretion or localization sequence, an epitope tag, a FLAG tag, a polyhistidine tag, a GST fusion, or the like.<br>
[302]	One advantage of an unnatural amino acid is that it presents additional<br>
chemical moieties that can be used to add additional molecules. These modifications can be made in vivo in a eukaryotic or non-eukaryotic cell, or in vitro. Thus, in certain embodiments, the post-translational modification is through the unnatural amino acid. For example, the post-translational modification can be through a nucleophilic-electrophilic reaction. Most reactions currently used for the selective modification of proteins involve covalent bond formation between nucleophilic and electrophilic reaction partners, including but not limited to the reaction of a-haloketones with histidine or cysteine side chains. Selectivity in these cases is determined by the number and accessibility of the nucleophilic residues in the protein.   In proteins of the invention, other more selective reactions can be<br><br>
used such as the reaction of an unnatural keto-amino acid with hydrazides or aminooxy compounds, in vitro and in vivo. See, e.g., Cornish, et al., (1996) Am. Chem. Soc, 118:8150-8151; Mahal, et al., (1997) Science, 276:1125-1128; Wang, et al., (2001) Science 292:498-500; Chin, et al., (2002) Am. Chem. Soc. 124:9026-9027; Chin, et al., (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad, ScL 99:11020-11024; Wang, et al., (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL 100:56-61; Zhang, et al., (2003) Biochemistry, 42:6735-6746; and, Chin, et al., (2003) Science, in press. This allows the selective labeling of virtually any protein with a host of reagents including fluorophores, crosslinking agents, saccharide derivatives and cytotoxic molecules. See also, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/686,944 entitled "Glycoprotein synthesis" filed October 15, 2003 based on U.S. provisional patent application Serial No. 60/419,265, filed Oct. 16, 2002, U.S. provisional patent application Serial No. 60/420,990, filed Oct. 23, 2002, and U.S. provisional patent application Serial No. 60/441,450, filed January 16, 2003, which are incorporated by reference herein. Post-translational modifications, including but not limited to, through an azido amino acid, can also made through the Staudinger ligation (including but not limited to, with triarylphosphine reagents). See, e.g., Kiick et al., (2002) Incorporation of azides into recombinant proteins for chemoselective modification by the Staudinger ligation, PNAS 99:19-24.<br>
[303]	This invention provides another highly efficient method for the selective<br>
modification of proteins, which involves the genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids, including but not limited to, containing an azide or alkynyl moiety into proteins in response to a selector codon. These amino acid side chains can then be modified by, including but not limited to, a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition reaction (see, e.g., Padwa, A. in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis. Vol. 4. (1991) Ed. Trost, B. M., Pergamon, Oxford, p. 1069-1109; and, Huisgen, R- in L3-Dipolar Cvcloaddition Chemistry, (1984) Ed. Padwa, A., Wiley, New Yost p. 1-176) with, including but not limited to, alkynyl or azide derivatives, respectively. Because this method involves a cycloaddition rather than a nucleophilic substitution, proteins can be modified with extremely high selectivity. This reaction can be carried out at room temperature in aqueous conditions with excellent regioselectivity (1,4 &gt; 1,5) by the addition of catalytic amounts of Cu(T) salts to the reaction mixture. See, e.g., Tornoe, et al., (2002) Org. Chem. 67:3057-3064; and, Rostovtsev, et al., (2002) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 41:2596-2599. Another method that can be used is the ligand exchange on a bisarsenic compound with a tetracysteine motif, see, e.g., Griffin, et al., (1998) Science 281:269-272.<br><br>
[304]	A molecule that can be added to a protein of the invention through a [3+2]<br>
cycloaddition includes virtually any molecule with an azide or alkynyl derivative. Molecules include, but are not limited to, dyes, fluorophores, crosslinking agents, saccharide derivatives, polymers (including but not limited to, derivatives of polyethylene glycol), photocrosslinkers, cytotoxic compounds, affinity labels, derivatives of biotin, resins, beads, a second protein or polypeptide (or more), polynucleotide(s) (including but not limited to, DNA, RNA, etc.), metal chelators, cofactors, fatty acids, carbohydrates, and the like. These molecules can be added to an unnatural amino acid with an alkynyl group, including but not limited to, p-propargyloxyphenylalanine, or azido group, including but not limited to, p-azido-phenylalanine, respectively.<br>
V.	In vivo generation ofABP comprising non-genetically-encoded amino acids<br>
[305]	The antigen-binding polypeptides of the invention can be generated in vivo<br>
using modified tRNA and tRNA synthetases to add to or substitute amino acids that are not encoded in naturally-occurring systems.<br>
[306]	Methods for generating tRNAs and tRNA synthetases which use amino acids<br>
that are not encoded in naturally-occurring systems are described in, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publications 2003/0082575 (Serial No. 10/126,927) and 2003/0108885 (Serial No. 10/126,931) which are incorporated by reference herein. These methods involve generating a translational machinery that functions independently of the synthetases and tRNAs endogenous to the translation system (and are therefore sometimes referred to as "oorthogonal"). Typically, the translation system comprises an orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA) and an orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (O-RS). Typically, the O-RS preferentially aroinoacylates the O-tRNA with at least one non-naturally occurring amino acid in the Translation system and the O-tRNA recognizes at least one selector codon that is not recognized by other tRNAs in the system. The translation system thus inserts the non-naturally-encoded ami-no acid into a protein produced in the system, in response to an encoded selector codon, thereby "substituting" an amino acid into a position in the encoded polypeptide.<br>
[307]	A wide variety of orthogonal tRNAs and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases have<br>
been described in the art for inserting particular synthetic amino acids into polypeptides, and are generally suitable for use in the present invention. For example, keto-specific O-tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are described in Wang, L., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:56-61 (2003) and Zhang, Z. et al., Biochem. 42(22):6735-6746 (2003). Exemplary<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
of clones is optionally replicated on growth plates containing CAT (which comprises at least one selector codon) either with or without one or more non-naturally encoded amino acid. Colonies growing exclusively on the plates containing non-naturally encoded amino acids are thus regarded as containing recombinant O-RS. In one aspect, the concentration of the selection (and/or screening) agent is varied. In some aspects the first and second organisms are different. Thus, the first and/or second organism optionally comprises: a prokaryote, a eukaryote, a mammal, an Escherichia coli, a fungi, a yeast, an archaebacterium, a eubacterium, a plant, an insect, a protist, etc. In other embodiments, the screening marker, comprises a fluorescent or luminescent screening marker or an affinity based screening rnarker.<br>
[318]	In another embodiment, screening or selecting (including but not limited to,<br>
negatively selecting) the pool for active (optionally mutant) RSs includes: isolating the pool of active mutant RSs from the positive selection step (b); introducing a negative selection or screening marker, wherein the negative selection or screening marker comprises at least one selector codon (including but not limited to, a toxic marker gene, including but not limited to, a rihonuclease barnase gene, comprising at least one selector codon), and the pool of active (optionally mutant) RSs into a plurality of cells of a second organism; and identifying cells that survive or show a specific screening response in a first medium not supplemented with the non-naturally encoded amino acid, but fail to survive or show a specific screening response in a second medium supplemented with the non-naturally encoded amino acid, thereby providing surviving or screened cells with the at least one recombinant O-RS,<br>
acid. In one aspect, the at least one selector codon comprises about two or more selector codons. Such embodiments optionally can include wherein the at least one selector codon comprises two or more selector codons, and wherein the first and second organism are different (including but not limited to, each organism is optionally, including but not limited to, a prokaryote, a eukaryote, a mammal, an Escherichia coli, a fungi, a yeast, an srchaebacteria, a eubacteria, a plant, an insect, a protist, etc.)- Also, some aspects include wherein the negative selection marker comprises a ribonuclease barnase gene (which comprises at least one selector codon). Other aspects include wherein the screening marker optionally comprises a fluorescent or luminescent screening marker or an affinity based screening marker. In the embodiments herein, the screenings and/or selections optionally include variation of the screening and/or selection stringency.<br>
wherein  the at least one recombinant O-RS is specific for the non-naturally encoded amino<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
wide pH range and thus, may be capable of binding ABP over a wide pH range. Weak cation<br>
exchangers, however, may lose ionization as a function of pH. For example, a weak cation<br>
exchanger may lose charge when the pH drops below about pH 4 or pH 5. Suitable strong<br>
cation exchangers include, but are not limited to, charged functional groups such as<br>
sulfopropyl (SP), methyl sulfonate (S), or sulfoethyl (SE). The cation exchange matrix may<br>
be a strong cation exchanger, preferably having an ABP binding pH range of about 2.5 to<br>
about 6.0. Alternatively, the strong cation exchanger may have an ABP binding pH range of<br>
about pH 2.5 to about pH 5.5. The cation exchange matrix may be a strong cation exchanger<br>
having an ABP binding pH of about 3.0. Alternatively, the cation exchange matrix may be a<br>
strong cation exchanger, preferably having an ABP binding pH range of about 6.0 to about<br>
8.0. The cation exchange matrix may be a strong cation exchanger preferably having an<br>
ABP binding pH range of about 8.0 to about 12.5. Alternatively, the strong cation exchanger<br>
may have an ABP binding pH range of about pH 8.0 to about pH 12.0.<br>
[400]	Prior to loading the ABP, the cation exchange matrix may be equilibrated, for<br>
example, using several column volumes of a dilute, weak acid, e.g., four column volumes of 20 mM acetic acid, pH 3. Following equilibration, the ABP may be added and the column may be washed one to several times, prior to elution of substantially purified ABP, also using a weak acid solution such as a weak acetic acid or phosphoric acid solution. For example, approximately 2-4 column volumes of 20 mM acetic acid, pH 3, may be used to wash the column. Additional washes using, e.g., 2-4 column volumes of 0.05 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, or 0.05 M sodium acetate mixed with 0.1 M sodium chloride, pH 5.5, may also be used. Alternatively, using methods known in the art, the cation exchange matrix may be equilibrated using several column volumes of a dilute, weak base.<br>
[401]	Alternatively, substantially purified ABP may be eluted by contacting the<br>
cation exchanger matrix with a buffer having a sufficiently low pH or ionic strength to displace the ABP from the matrix. The pH of the elution buffer may range from about pH 2.5 to about pH 6.0. More specifically, the pH of the elution buffer may range from about pH 2.5 to about pH 5.5, about pH 2.5 to about pH 5.0. The elution buffer may have a pH of about 3.0. In addition, the quantity of elution buffer may vary widely and will generally be in the range of about 2 to about 10 column volumes. Moreover, suitable buffers known to those of skill in the art may find use herein including, but not limited to, citrate, phosphate, formate, HEPES, and MES buffers ranging in concentration from at least about 5 mM to at least about 100 mM.<br><br>
[402]	Following adsorption of the ABP polypeptide to the cation exchanger matrix,<br>
substantially purified ABP polypeptide may be eluted by contacting the matrix with a buffer having a sufficiently high pH or ionic strength to displace the ABP from the matrix. Suitable buffers for use in high pH elution of substantially purified ABP may include, but are not limited to, citrate, phosphate, formate, acetate, HEPES, and MES buffers ranging in concentration from at least about 5 mM to at least about 100 mM.<br>
[403]	Reverse-Phase Chromatographv    RP-HPLC may be performed to purify<br>
proteins following suitable protocols that are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, e.g., Pearson et al., ANAL BIOCHEM. (1982) 124:217-230 (1982); Rivier et al, J. CHROM. (1983) 268:112-119; Kunitani et al., J. CHROM. (1986) 359:391-402. RP-HPLC may be performed on the ABP to isolate substantially purified ABP. In this regard, silica derivatized resins with alkyl functionalities with a wide variety of lengths, including, but not limited to, at least about C3 to at least about C30, at least about C3 to at least about C20, or at least about C3 to at least about C18, resins may be used. Alternatively, a polymeric resin may be used. For example, TosoHaas Amberchrome CGlOOOsd resin may be used, which is a styrene polymer resin. Cyano or polymeric resins with a wide variety of alkyl chain lengths may also be used. Furthermore, the RP-HPLC column may be washed with a solvent such as ethanol. The Source RP column is another example of a RP-HPLC column.<br>
[404]	A suitable elution buffer containing an ion pairing agent and an organic<br>
modifier such as methanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile or ethanol, may be used to elute the ABP from the RP-HPLC column. The most commonly used ion pairing agents include, but are not limited to, acetic acid, formic acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, heptafluorobutyric acid, triethylamine, tetramethylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, and triethylammonium acetate. Elution may be performed using one or more gradients or isocratic conditions, with gradient conditions preferred to reduce the separation time and to decrease peak width. Another method involves the use of two gradients with different solvent concentration ranges. Examples of suitable elution buffers for use herein may include, but are not limited to, ammonium acetate and acetonitrile solutions.<br>
[405]	H vdrophobic     Interaction     Chromato graphy     Purification     Techniques<br>
Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) may be performed on the ABP.    See<br>
generally  HYDROPHOBIC  INTERACTION  CHROMATOGRAPHY   HANDBOOK:  PRINCIPLES  AND<br>
METHODS  (Cat.  No.   18-1020-90,  Amersham Biosciences  (Piscataway,  NT) which  is<br><br>
incorporated by reference herein. Suitable HIC matrices may include, but are not limited to, alkyl- or aryl-substituted matrices, such as butyl-, hexyl-, octyl- or phenyl-substituted matrices including agarose, cross-linked agarose, sepharose, cellulose, silica, dextran, polystyrene, poly(methacrylate) matrices, and mixed mode resins, including but not limited to, a polyethyleneamine resin or a butyl- or phenyl-substituted poly(methacrylate) matrix. Commercially available sources for hydrophobic interaction column chromatography include, but are not limited to, HITRAP®, HIPREP®, and HILOAD® columns (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).<br>
[406]	Briefly, prior to loading, the HIC column may be equilibrated using standard<br>
buffers known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as an acetic acid/sodium chloride solution or HEPES containing ammonium sulfate. Ammonium sulfate may be used as the buffer for loading the HIC column. After loading the ABP, the column may then washed using standard buffers and conditions to remove unwanted materials but retaining the ABP on the HIC column. ABP may be eluted with about 3 to about 10 column volumes of a standard buffer, such as a HEPES buffer containing EDTA and lower ammonium sulfate concentration than the equilibrating buffer, or an acetic acid/sodium chloride buffer, among others. A decreasing linear salt gradient using, for example, a gradient of potassium phosphate, may also be used to elute the ABP molecules. The eluant may then be concentrated, for example, by filtration such as diafiltration or ultrafiltration. Diafiltration may be utilized to remove the salt used to elute ABP.<br>
[407]	Other Purification Techniques Yet another isolation step using, for example,<br>
gel filtration (GEL FILTRATION: PRINCIPLES AND METHODS (Cat. No. 18-1022-18, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) which is incorporated by reference herein, hydroxyapatite chromatography (suitable matrices include, but are not limited to, HA-Ultrogel, High Resolution (Calbiochem), CHT Ceramic Hydroxyapatite (BioRad), Bio - Gel HTP Hydroxyapatite (BioRad)), HPLC, expanded bed adsorption, ultrafiltration, diafiltration, lyophilization, and the like, may be performed on the first ABP mixture or any subsequent mixture thereof, to remove any excess salts and to replace the buffer with a suitable buffer for the next isolation step or even formulation of the final drug product.<br>
[408]	The non-naturally encoded amino acid present in the ABP may also be utilized<br>
to provide separation from other cellular proteins that do not contain the non-naturally encoded amino acid. Since the non-naturally encoded amino acid may comprise unique chemical functional groups, the coupling of the unique functional group to another molecule<br><br>
may provide a substantial purification step. For example, the non-naturally encoded amino acid may be coupled to another molecule that facilitates separation from other proteins. Such molecules for coupling to the non-natural amino acid include, but are not limited to, PEG and other polymers, beads, and other solid substances.<br>
[409]	The yield of ABP, including substantially purified ABP, may be monitored at<br>
each step described herein using techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such techniques may also be used to assess the yield of substantially purified ABP following the last isolation step. For example, the yield of ABP may be monitored using any of several reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography columns, having a variety of alkyl chain lengths such as cyano RP-HPLC, CisRP-HPLC; as well as cation exchange HPLC and gel filtration HPLC.<br>
[410]	In specific embodiments of the present invention, the yield of ABP after each<br>
purification step may be at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%, at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, at least about 99%, at least about 99.9%, or at least about 99.99%, of the ABP in the starting material for each purification step.<br>
[411]	Purity may be determined using standard techniques, such as SDS-PAGE, or by<br>
measuring ABP using Western blot and ELISA assays. For example, polyclonal antibodies may be generated against proteins isolated from negative control yeast fermentation and the cation exchange recovery. The antibodies may also be used to probe for the presence of contaminating host cell proteins.<br>
[412]	RP-HPLC material Vydac C4 (Vydac) consists of silica gel particles, the<br>
surfaces of which carry C4-alkyl chains. The separation of ABP from the proteinaceous impurities is based on differences in the strength of hydrophobic interactions. Elution is performed with an acetonitnle gradient in diluted trifluoroacetic acid. Preparative HPLC is performed using a stainless steel column (filled with 2.8 to 3.2 liter of Vydac C4 silicagel). The Hydroxyapatite Ultrogel eluate is acidified by adding trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto the Vydac C4 column. For washing and elution an acetonitrile gradient in diluted trifluoroacetic acid is used. Fractions are collected and immediately neutralized with phosphate buffer. The ABP fractions which are within the IPC limits are pooled.<br><br>
[413]	DEAE Sepharose (Pharmacia) material consists of diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-<br>
groups which are covalently bound to the surface of Sepharose beads. The binding of ABP to the DEAE groups is mediated by ionic interactions. Acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid pass through the column without being retained. After these substances have been washed off, trace impurities are removed by washing the column with acetate buffer at a low pH. Then the column is washed with neutral phosphate buffer and ABP is eluted with a buffer with ■increased ionic strength. The column is packed with DEAE Sepharose fast flow. The column volume is adjusted to assure a ABP load in the range of 3-10 mg ABP polypeptide/ml gel. The column is washed with water and equilibration buffer (sodium/potassium phosphate). The pooled fractions of the HPLC eluate are loaded and the column is washed with equilibration buffer. Then the column is washed with washing buffer (sodium acetate buffer) followed by washing with equilibration buffer. Subsequently, ABP is eluted from the column with elution buffer (sodium chloride, sodium/potassium phosphate) and collected in a single fraction in accordance with the master elution profile. The eluate of the DEAE Sepharose column is adjusted to the specified conductivity. The resulting drug substance is sterile filtered into Teflon bottles and stored at -70°C.<br>
[414]	Additional methods that may be employed include, but are not limited to, steps<br>
to remove endotoxins. Endotoxins are lipopoly-saccharides (LPSs) which are located on the outer membrane of Gram-negative host cells, such as, for example, Escherichia coli. Methods for reducing endotoxin levels are known to one skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, purification techniques using silica supports, glass powder or hydroxyapatite, reverse-phase, affinity, size-exclusion, anion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, a combination of these methods, and the like. Modifications or additional methods may be required to remove contaminants such as co-migrating proteins from the polypeptide of interest<br>
[415]	A wide variety of methods and procedures can be used to assess the yield and<br>
purity of a ABP protein one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids, including but not<br>
limited to, the Bradford assay, SDS-PAGE, silver stained SDS-PAGE, coomassie stained<br>
SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry (including but not limited to, MALDI-TOF) and other<br>
methods for characterizing proteins known to one skilled in the art.<br>
VJIL	Expression in Alternate Systems<br>
[416]	Several strategies have been employed to introduce unnatural amino acids into<br>
proteins in non-recombinant host cells, mutagenized host cells, or in cell-free systems. These<br><br>
systems are also suitable for use in making the antigen-binding polypeptides of the present<br>
invention. Derivatization of amino acids with reactive side-chains such as Lys, Cys and Tyr<br>
resulted in the conversion of lysine to N -acetyl-lysine. Chemical synthesis also provides a<br>
straightforward method to incorporate unnatural amino acids. With the recent development<br>
of enzymatic ligation and native chemical ligation of peptide fragments, it is possible to make<br>
larger proteins. See, e.g., P. E. Dawson and S. B. H. Kent, Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 69:923<br>
(2000). A general in vitro biosynthetic method in which a suppressor tRNA chemically<br>
acylated with the desired unnatural amino acid is added to an in vitro extract capable of<br>
supporting protein biosynthesis, has been used to site-specifically incorporate over 100<br>
unnatural amino acids into a variety of proteins of virtually any size. See, e.g., V. W.<br>
Cornish, D. Mendel and P. G. Schultz, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed, End., 1995, 34:621 (1995);<br>

specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, Science 244:182-188 (1989);<br>
and, J.D. Bain, C.G. Glabe, T.A. Dix, A.R. Chamberlin, E.S. Diala, Biosynthetic site-specific<br>
incorporation of a non-natural amino acid into a polypeptide, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:8013-<br>
8014 (1989). A broad range of functional groups has been introduced into proteins for<br>
studies of protein stability, protein folding, enzyme mechanism, and signal transduction.<br>
[417]	An in vivo method, termed selective pressure incorporation, was developed to<br>
exploit the promiscuity of wild-type synthetases. See, e.g., N. Budisa, C. Minks, S. Alefelder, W. Wenger, F. M. Dong, L. Moroder and R. Huber, FASEB J., 13:41 (1999). An auxotrophic strain, in which the relevant metabolic pathway supplying the cell with a particular natural amino acid is switched off, is grown in minimal media containing limited concentrations of the natural amino acid, while transcription of the target gene is repressed. At the onset of a stationary growth phase, the natural amino acid is depleted and replaced with the unnatural amino acid analog. Induction of expression of the recombinant protein results in the accumulation of a protein containing the unnatural analog. For example, using this strategy, o, m and p-fluorophenylalanines have been incorporated into proteins, and exhibit two characteristic shoulders in the UV spectrum which can be easily identified, see, e.g., C. Minks, R. Huber, L. Moroder and N. Budisa, Anal. Biochem., 284:29 (2000); trifluoromethionine has been used to replace methionine in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme to study its interaction with chitooligosaccharide ligands by 19F NMR, see, e.g., H. Duewel, E. Daub, V. Robinson and J. F. Honek, Biochemistry, 36:3404 (1997); and trifluoroleucine has been incorporated in place of leucine, resulting in increased thermal and chemical stability of<br><br>
a leucine-zipper protein. See, e.g., Y. Tang, G. Ghirlanda, W. A. Petka, T. Nakajima, W. F. DeGrado and D. A. Tirrell, Angew. Chem, Int. Ed, End.. 40:1494 (2001). Moreover, selenomethionine and telluromethionine are incorporated into various recombinant proteins to facilitate the solution of phases in X-ray crystallography. See, e.g., W. A. Hendrickson, J. R. Horton and D. M. Lemaster, EMBO J., 9:1665 (1990); J. O. Boles, K. Lewinski, M. Kunkle, J. D. Odom, B. Dunlap, L. Lebioda and M. Hatada, Nat. Struct. BioL. 1:283 (1994); N. Budisa, B. Steipe, P. Demange, C. Eckerskorn, J. Kellermann and R. Huber, Eur. J. Biochem,. 230:788 (1995); and, N. Budisa, W. Kambrock, S. Steinbacher, A. Humm, L. Prade, T. Neuefeind, L. Moroder and R. Huber, J. Mol. BioL. 270:616 (1997). Methionine analogs with alkene or alkyne functionalities have also been incorporated efficiently, allowing for additional modification of proteins by chemical means. See, e.g., J. C. M. vanHest and D. A. Tirrell, FEBS Lett., 428:68 (1998); J. C. M. van Hest, K. L. Kiick and D. A. Tirrell, J, Am. Chem. Soc. 122:1282 (2000); and, K. L. Kiick and D. A. Tirrell, Tetrahedron, 56:9487 (2000); U.S. Patent No. 6,586,207; U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0042097, which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[418]	The success of this method depends on the recognition of the unnatural amino<br>
acid analogs by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which, in general, require high selectivity to insure the fidelity of protein translation. One way to expand the scope of this method is to relax the substrate specificity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which has been achieved in a limited number of cases. For example, replacement of Ala by Gly in Escherichia coli phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) increases the size of substrate binding pocket, and results in the acylation of tRNAPhe by p-Cl-phenylalanine (p-Cl-Phe). See, M. Ibba, P. Kast and H. Hennecke, Biochemistry, 33:7107 (1994). An Escherichia coli strain harboring this mutant PheRS allows the incorporation of p-Cl-phenylalanine or p-Br-phenylalanine in place of phenylalanine. See, e.g., M. Ibba and H. Hennecke, FEBS Lett., 364:272 (1995); and, N. Shaima, R. Furter, P. Kast and D. A. Tirrell, FEBS Lett., 467:37 (2000). Similarly, a point mutation Phel30Ser near the amino acid binding site of Escherichia coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was shown to allow azatyrosine to be incorporated more efficiently than tyrosine. See, F. Hamano-Takaku, T. Iwama, S. Saito-Yano, K. Takaku, Y. Monden, M. Kitabatake, D. Soil and S. Nishimura, J. Biol. Chem.. 275:40324 (2000).<br>
[419]	Another strategy to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins in vivo is<br>
to modify synthetases that have proofreading mechanisms. These synthetases cannot discriminate and therefore activate amino acids that are structurally similar to the cognate<br><br>
natural amino acids. This error is corrected at a separate site, which deacylates the mischarged amino acid from the tRNA to maintain the fidelity of protein translation. If the proofreading activity of the synthetase is disabled, structural analogs that are misactivated may escape the editing function and be incorporated. This approach has been demonstrated recently with the valyl-tRNA synthetase (ValRS). See, V. Doring, H. D. Mootz, L. A. Nangle, T. L. Hendrickson, V. de Crecy-Lagaxd, P. Schimmel and P. Marliere, Science. 292:501 (2001). ValRS can misaminoacylate tRNAVal with Cys, Thr, or aminobutyrate (Abu); these noncognate amino acids are subsequently hydrolyzed by the editing domain. After random mutagenesis of the Escherichia coli chromosome, a mutant Escherichia coli strain was selected that has a mutation in the editing site of ValRS. This edit-defective ValRS incorrectly charges tRNAVal with Cys. Because Abu sterically resembles Cys (-SH group of Cys is replaced with -CH3 in Abu), the mutant ValRS also incorporates Abu into proteins when this mutant Escherichia coli strain is grown in the presence of Abu. Mass spectrometric analysis shows that about 24% of valines are replaced by Abu at each valine position in the native protein.<br>
[420]	Solid-phase synthesis and semisynthetic methods have also allowed for the<br>
synthesis of a number of proteins containing novel amino acids. For example, see the following publications and references cited within, which are as follows: Crick, F.J.C., Barrett, L. Brenner, S.

chains, including cofactors, spin labels and oligonucleotides into proteins in vitro. See, e.g.,<br>

[422]	Alternatively,   biosynthetic   methods   that   employ   chemically   modified<br>
aminoacyl-tRNAs have been used to incorporate several biophysical probes into proteins synthesized in vitro. See the following publications and references cited within: Brunner, J.

[423]	Previously, it has been shown that unnatural  amino  acids can be site-<br>
specifically incorporated into proteins in vitro by the addition of chemically aminoacylated suppressor tRNAs to protein synthesis reactions programmed with a gene containing a desired amber nonsense mutation. Using these approaches, one can substitute a number of the common twenty amino acids with close structural homologues, e.g., fluorophenylalanine for phenylalanine, using strains auxotropic for a particular amino acid. See, e.g., Noren, C.J., Anthony-Cahill, Griffith, M.C., Schultz, P.G. A general method for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, Science, 244: 182-188 (1989); M.W.

Mutagenesis with an Expanded Genetic Code, Annu Rev Biophvs. Biomol Struct. 24, 435-62 (1995).<br>
[424]	For example, a suppressor tRNA was prepared that recognized the stop codon<br>
UAG and was chemically aminoacylated with an unnatural amino acid. Conventional site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the stop codon TAG, at the site of interest in the protein gene. See, e.g., Sayers, J.R., Schmidt, W. Eckstein, F. 5f, 3f Exonuclease in phosphorothioate-based olignoucleotide-directed mutagensis, Nucleic Acids Res, 16(3):791-802 (1988). When the acylated suppressor tRNA and the mutant gene were combined in an in vitro transcription/translation system, the unnatural amino acid was incorporated in response to the UAG codon which gave a protein containing that amino acid at the specified position. Experiments using [3H]-Phe and experiments with α-hydroxy acids demonstrated that only the desired amino acid is incorporated at the position specified by the UAG codon and that this amino acid is not incorporated at any other site in the protein. See, e.g., Noren, et al, supra; Kobayashi et aL, (2003) Nature Structural Biology 10(6):425-432; and, Ellman, J.A., Mendel, D., Schultz, P.G. Site-specific incorporation of novel backbone structures into proteins, Science, 255(5041): 197-200 (1992).<br>
[425]	Microinjection techniques have also been use incorporate unnatural amino<br>
acids into proteins. See, e.g., M. W. Nowak, P. C. Kearney, J. R. Sampson, M. E. Saks, C. G. Labarca, S. IC Silverman, W. G. Zhong, J. Thorson, J. N. Abelson, N. Davidson, P. G. Schultz, D. A. Dougherty and H. A. Lester, Science, 268:439 (1995); and, D. A. Dougherty, Curr. Opin. Chem. BioL. 4:645 (2000). A Xenopus oocyte was coinjected with two RNA species made in vitro: an mRNA encoding the target protein with a UAG stop codon at the amino acid position of interest and an amber suppressor tRNA aminoacylated with the desired unnatural amino acid. The translational machinery of the oocyte then inserts the unnatural amino acid at the position specified by UAG. This method has allowed in vivo structure-function studies of integral membrane proteins, which are generally not amenable to in vitro expression systems. Examples include the incorporation of a fluorescent amino acid into tachykinin neurokinin-2 receptor to measure distances by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, see, e.g., G. Turcatti, K. Nemeth, M. D. Edgerton, U. Meseth, R Talabot, M. Peitsch, J. Knowles, H. Vogel and A. Chollet, J. Biol. Chem., 271:19991 (1996); the incorporation of biotinylated amino acids to identify surface-exposed residues in ion channels, see, e.g., J. P. Gallivan, H. A. Lester and D. A. Dougherty, Chem. Biol., 4:739 (1997); the use of caged tyrosine analogs to monitor conformational changes in an ion<br><br>
channel in real time, see, e.g., J. C. Miller, S. K. Silverman, P. M. England, D. A. Dougherty<br>
and H. A. Lester, Neuron, 20:619 (1998); and, the use of alpha hydroxy amino acids to<br>
change ion channel backbones for probing their gating mechanisms. See, e.g., P. M. England,<br>

Mainland, L. Y. Jan, P. G. Schultz and J. Yang, Nat. NeuroscL 4:239 (2001).<br>
[426]	The ability to incorporate unnatural amino acids directly into proteins in vivo<br>
offers the advantages of high yields of mutant proteins, technical ease, the potential to study<br>
the mutant proteins in cells or possibly in living organisms and the use of these mutant<br>
proteins in therapeutic treatments. The ability to include unnatural amino acids with various<br>
sizes, acidities, nucleophilicities, hydrophobicities, and other properties into proteins can<br>
greatly expand our ability to rationally and systematically manipulate the structures of<br>
proteins, both to probe protein function and create new proteins or organisms with novel<br>
properties. However, the process is difficult, because the complex nature of tRNA-synthetase<br>
interactions that are required to achieve a high degree of fidelity in protein translation.<br>
[427]	In one attempt to site-specifically incorporate para-F-Phe, a yeast amber<br>
suppressor tRNAPheCUA /phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase pair was used in a p-F-Phe resistant, Phe auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain. See, e.g., R. Furter, Protein ScL, 7:419 (1998).<br>
[428]	It may also be possible to obtain expression of an ABP polynucleotide of the<br>
present invention using a cell-free (in-vitro) translational system. In these systems, which can include either mRNA as a template (in-vitro translation) or DNA as a template (combined in-vitro transcription and translation), the in vitro synthesis is directed by the ribosomes. Considerable effort has been applied to the development of cell-free protein expression systems. See, e.g., Kim, D.-M. and JJL Swartz, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 74 :309-316 (2001); Kim, D.-M. and J.R. Swartz, Biotechnology Letters, 22, 1537-1542, (2000); Kim, D.-M., and J.R. Swartz, Biotechnology Progress, 16, 385-390, (2000); Kim, D.-M., and J.R. Swartz, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 66, 180-188, (1999); and Patnaik, R. and J.R. Swartz, Biotechniques 24? 862-868, (1998); U.S. Patent No. 6,337,191; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0081660; WO 00/55353; WO 90/05785, which are incorporated by reference herein. Another approach that may be applied to the expression of antigen-binding polypeptides comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid includes the mRNA-peptide fusion technique. See, e.g., R. Roberts and J. Szostak, Proc. Natl Acad. ScL (USA) 94:12297-12302 (1997); A. Frankel, et aLf Chemistiy &amp; Biology 10:1043-1050 (2003).    In this<br><br>
approach, an mRNA template linked to puromycin is translated into peptide on the ribosome. If one or more tRNA molecules has been modified, non-natural amino acids can be incorporated into the peptide as well. After the last mRNA codon has been read, puromycin captures the C-terminus of the peptide. If the resulting mRNA-peptide conjugate is found to have interesting properties in an in vitro assay, its identity can be easily revealed from the mRNA sequence. In this way, one may screen libraries of antigen-binding polypeptides comprising one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids to identify polypeptides having desired properties. More recently, in vitro ribosome translations with purified components have been reported that permit the synthesis of peptides substituted with non-naturally encoded amino acids. See, e.g., A. Forster et al, Proc. Natl Acad. ScL (USA) 100:6353 (2003).<br>
LX	Macromolecular Polymers Coupled to ABP<br>
[429]	Various modifications to the non-natural amino acid polypeptides described<br>
herein can be effected using the compositions, methods, techniques and strategies described herein. These modifications include the incorporation of further functionality onto the non-natural amino acid component of the polypeptide, including but not limited to, a label; a dye; a polymer; a water-soluble polymer, a derivative of polyethylene glycol; a photocrosslinker; a radionuclide; a cytotoxic compound; a drug; an affinity label; a photoafBnity label; a reactive compound; a resin; a second protein or polypeptide or polypeptide analog; an antibody or antibody fragment; a metal chelator, a cofactor, a fatty acid; a carbohydrate; a polynucleotide; a DNA; a RNA; an antisense polynucleotide; a water-soluble dendrimer; a cyclodextrin; an inhibitory ribonucleic acid; a biomaterial; a nanoparticle; a spin label; a fluorophore, a metal-containing moiety; a radioactive moiety; a novel functional group; a group that covalently or noncovalently interacts with other molecules; a photocaged moiety; a photoisomerizable moiety; biotin; a derivative of biotin; a biotin analogue; a moiety incorporating a heavy atom; a chemically cleavable group; a photocleavable group; an elongated side chain; a carbon-linked sugar; a redox-active agent; an amino thioacid; a toxic moiety; an isotopically labeled moiety; a biophysical probe; a phosphorescent group; a chemiluminescent group; an electron dense group; a magnetic group; an intercalating group; a chromophore; an energy transfer agent; a biologically active agent; a detectable label; a small molecule; or any combination of the above, or any other desirable compound or substance. As an illustrative, non-limiting example of the compositions, methods, techniques and   strategies   described   herein,   the   following   description   will   focus   on   adding<br><br>
macromolecular polymers to the non-natural amino acid polypeptide with the understanding that the compositions, methods, techniques and strategies described thereto are also applicable (with appropriate modifications, if necessary and for which one of skill in the art could make with the disclosures herein) to adding other functionalities, including but not limited to those listed above.<br>
[430]	A wide variety of macromolecular polymers and other molecules can be<br>
linked to antigen-binding polypeptides of the present invention to modulate biological properties of the ABP, and/or provide new biological properties to the ABP molecule. These macromolecular polymers can be linked to the ABP via a naturally encoded amino acid, via a non-naturally encoded amino acid, or any functional substituent of a natural or non-natural amino acid, or any substituent or functional group added to a natural or non-natural amino acid. The molecular weight of the polymer may be of a wide range, including but not limited to, between about 100 Da and about 100,000 Da or more.<br>
[431]	The present invention provides substantially homogenous preparations of<br>
polymerprotein conjugates. "Substantially homogenous" as used herein means that polymenprotein conjugate molecules are observed to be greater than half of the total protein. The polymenprotein conjugate has biological activity and the present "substantially homogenous" PEGylated ABP preparations provided herein are those which are homogenous enough to display the advantages of a homogenous preparation, e.g., ease in clinical application in predictability of lot to lot pharmacokinetics.<br>
[432]	One may also choose to prepare a mixture of polymerprotein conjugate<br>
molecules, and the advantage provided herein is that one may select the proportion of mono-polymer:protein conjugate to include in the mixture. Thus, if desired, one may prepare a mixture of various proteins with various numbers of polymer moieties attached (i.e., di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.) and combine said conjugates with the mono-polymenprotein conjugate prepared using the methods of the present invention, and have a mixture with a predetermined proportion of mono-polymer :protein conjugates.<br>
[433]	The polymer selected may be water soluble so that the protein to which it is<br>
attached,  does  not  precipitate  in  an  aqueous   environment,   such   as   a physiological<br>
environment. The polymer may be branched or unbranched. Preferably, for therapeutic use of<br>
the end-product preparation, the polymer will be pharmaceutically acceptable.<br>
[434]	The proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein molecules will<br>
vary, as will their concentrations in the reaction mixture. In general, the optimum ratio (in<br><br>
terms of efficiency of reaction in that there is minimal excess unreacted protein or polymer) may be determined by the molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol selected and on the number of available reactive groups available. As relates to molecular weight, typically the higher the molecular weight of the polymer, the fewer number of polymer molecules which may be attached to the protein. Similarly, branching of the polymer should be taken into account when optimizing these parameters. Generally, the higher the molecular weight (or the more branches) the higher the polymenprotein ratio.<br>
[435]	As used herein, and when contemplating PEG:ABP conjugates, the term<br>
"therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount which gives the desired benefit to a<br>
patient. The amount will vary from one individual to another and will depend upon a number<br>
of factors, including the overall physical condition of the patient and the underlying cause of<br>
the condition to be treated. The amount of ABP polypeptide used for therapy gives an<br>
acceptable rate of change and maintains desired response at a beneficial level. A<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the present compositions may be readily ascertained by<br>
one skilled in the art using publicly available materials and procedures.<br>
[436]	The water soluble polymer may be any structural form including but not limited<br>
to linear, forked or branched. Typically, the water soluble polymer is a poly(alkylene glycol),<br>
such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), but other water soluble polymers can also be employed.<br>
By way of example, PEG is used to describe certain embodiments of this invention.<br>
[437]	PEG is a well-known, water soluble polymer that is commercially available or<br>
can be prepared by ring-opening polymerization of ethylene glycol according to methods well known in the art (Sandier and Karo, Polymer Synthesis, Academic Press, New York, Vol. 3, pages 138-161). The term "PEG" is used broadly to encompass any polyethylene glycol molecule, without regard to size or to modification at an end of the PEG, and can be represented as linked to the ABP by the formula: XO-(CH2CH2O)n-CH2CH2-Y<br>
where n is 2 to 10,000 and X is H or a terminal modification, including but not limited to, a C1-4 alkyl.<br>
[438]	In some cases, a PEG used in the invention terminates on one end with hydroxy<br>
or methoxy, i.e., X is H or CH3 ("methoxy PEG"). Alternatively, the PEG can terminate with a reactive group, thereby forming a bifiinctional polymer. Typical reactive groups can include those reactive groups that are commonly used to react with the functional groups found in the 20 common amino acids (including but not limited to, maleimide groups,<br><br>
activated carbonates (including but not limited to, p-nitrophenyl ester), activated esters (including but not liinited to, N-hydroxysuccinimide, p-nitrophenyl ester) and aldehydes) as well as functional groups that are inert to the 20 common amino acids but that react specifically with complementary functional groups present in non-naturally encoded amino acids (including but not limited to, azide groups, alkyne groups). It is noted that the other end of the PEG, which is shown in the above formula by Y, will attach either directly or indirectly to an antigen-binding polypeptide via a naturally-occurring or non-naturally encoded amino acid. For instance, Y may be an amide, carbamate or urea linkage to an amine group (including but not limited to, the epsilon amine of lysine or the N-tenninus) of the polypeptide. Alternatively, Y may be a maleimide linkage to a thiol group (including but not limited to, the thiol group of cysteine). Alternatively, Y may be a linkage to a residue not commonly accessible via the 20 common amino acids. For example, an azide group on the PEG can be reacted with an alkyne group on the ABP to form a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition product. Alternatively, an alkyne group on the PEG can be reacted with an azide group present in a non-naturally encoded amino acid to form a similar product. In some embodiments, a strong nucleophile (including but not limited to, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxylamine, semicarbazide) can be reacted with an aldehyde or ketone group present in a non-naturally encoded amino acid to form a hydrazone, oxime or semicarbazone, as applicable, which in some cases can be further reduced by treatment with an appropriate reducing agent. Alternatively, the strong nucleophile can be incorporated into the ABP via a non-naturally encoded amino acid and used to react preferentially with a ketone or aldehyde group present in the water soluble polymer.<br>
[439]	Any molecular mass for a PEG can be used as practically desired, including but<br>
not liinited to, from about 100 Daltons (Da) to 100,000 Da or more as desired (including but not limited to, sometimes 0.1-50 kDa or 10-40 kDa). Branched chain PEGs, including but not limited to, PEG molecules with each chain having a MW ranging from 1-100 kDa (including but not limited to, 1-50 kDa or 5-20 kDa) can also be used. A wide range of PEG molecules are described in, including but not limited to, the Shearwater Polymers, Inc. catalog, Nektar Therapeutics catalog, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[440]	Generally, at least one terminus of the PEG molecule is available for reaction<br>
with the non-naturally-encoded amino acid. For example, PEG derivatives bearing alkyne and azide moieties for reaction with amino acid side chains can be used to attach PEG to non-naturally encoded amino acids as described herein. If the non-naturally encoded amino acid<br><br>
comprises an azide, then the PEG will typically contain either an alkyne moiety to effect formation of the [3+2] cycloaddition product or an activated PEG species (i.e., ester, carbonate) containing a phosphine group to effect formation of the amide linkage. Alternatively, if the non-naturally encoded amino acid comprises an alkyne, then the PEG will typically contain an azide moiety to effect formation of the [3+2] Huisgen cycloaddition product. If the non-naturally encoded amino acid comprises a carbonyl group, the PEG will typically comprise a potent nucleophile (including but not limited to, a hydrazide, hydrazine, hydroxylamine, or semicarbazide functionality) in order to effect formation of corresponding hydrazone, oxime, and semicarbazone linkages, respectively. In other alternatives, a reverse of the orientation of the reactive groups described above can be used, i.e., an azide moiety in the non-naturally encoded amino acid can be reacted with a PEG derivative containing an alkyne.<br>
[441]	In some embodiments, the ABP variant with a PEG derivative contains a<br>
chemical functionality that is reactive with the chemical functionality present on the side chain of the non-naturally encoded amino acid.<br>
[442]	The invention provides in some embodiments azide- and acetylene-containing<br>
polymer derivatives comprising a water soluble polymer backbone having an average molecular weight from about 800 Da to about 100,000 Da. The polymer backbone of the water-soluble polymer can be polyethylene glycol). However, it should be understood that a wide variety of water soluble polymers including but not limited to poly(ethylene)glycol and other related polymers, including poly(dextran) and poly(propylene glycol), are also suitable for use in the practice of this invention and that the use of the term PEG or poly(ethylene glycol) is intended to encompass and include all such molecules. The term PEG includes, but is not limited to, polyethylene glycol) in any of its forms, including bifunctional PEG, multiarmed PEG, derivatized PEG, foiked PEG, branched PEG, pendent PEG (i.e. PEG or related polymers haying one or more fimctional groups pendent to the polymer backbone), or PEG with degradable linkages therein.<br>
[443]	PEG is typically clear, colorless, odorless, soluble in water, stable to heat,<br>
inert to many chemical agents, does not hydrolyze or deteriorate, and is generally non-toxic. Poly(ethylene glycol) is considered to be biocompatible, which is to say that PEG is capable of coexistence with living tissues or organisms without causing harm. More specifically, PEG is substantially non-immunogenic, which is to say that PEG does not tend to produce an<br><br>
immune response in the body. When attached to a molecule having some desirable function in the body, such as a biologically active agent, the PEG tends to mask the agent and can reduce or eliminate any immune response so that an organism can tolerate the presence of the agent. PEG conjugates tend not to produce a substantial immune response or cause clotting or other undesirable effects. PEG having the formula - CH2CH2O-(CH2CH2O)n -- CH2CH2--, where n is from about 3 to about 4000, typically from about 20 to about 2000, is suitable for use in the present invention. PEG having a molecular weight of from about 800 Da to about 100,000 Da are in some embodiments of the present invention particularly useful as the polymer backbone.<br>
[444]	The  polymer backbone  can be  linear  or branched.   Branched  polymer<br>
backbones are generally known in the art Typically, a branched polymer has a central branch core moiety and a plurality of linear polymer chains linked to the central branch core. PEG is commonly used in branched forms that can be prepared by addition of ethylene oxide to various polyols, such as glycerol, glycerol oligomers, pentaerythritol and sorbitol. The central branch moiety can also be derived from several amino acids, such as lysine. The branched poly(ethylene glycol) can be represented in general form as R(-PEG-OH)m in which R is derived from a core moiety, such as glycerol, glycerol oligomers, or pentaerythritol, and m represents the number of arms. Multi-anned PEG molecules, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos, 5,932,462 5,643,575; 5,229,490; 4,289,872; U.S. Pat Appl. 2003/0143596; WO 96/21469; and WO 93/21259, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, can also be used as the polymer backbone.<br>
[445]	Branched PEG can also be in the fonn of a forked PEG represented by PEG(--<br>
YCHZ2)n, where Y is a linking group and Z is an activated terminal group linked to CH by a chain of atoms of defined length.<br>
[446]	Yet another branched form, the pendant PEG, has reactive groups, such as<br>
carboxyl, along the PEG backbone rather than at the end of PEG chains.<br>
[447]	In addition to these forms of PEG, the polymer can also be prepared with<br>
weak or degradable linkages in the backbone. For example, PEG can be prepared with ester linkages in the polymer backbone that are subject to hydrolysis. As shown below, this hydrolysis results in cleavage of the polymer into fragments of lower molecular weight: -PEG-CO2-PEG-+H2O -» PEG-CO2H+HO-PEG-<br><br>
It is understood by those skilled in the art that the term poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG<br>
represents or includes all the forms known in the art including but not limited to those<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
[448]	Many other polymers are also suitable for use in the present invention. In<br>
some embodiments, polymer backbones that are water-soluble, with from 2 to about 300<br>
termini, are particularly useful in the invention. Examples of suitable polymers include, but<br>
are not limited to, other poly(alkylene glycols), such as poly(propylene glycol) ('TPG"),<br>
copolymers thereof (including but not limited to copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene<br>
glycol), teipolymers thereof mixtures thereof, and the like. Although the molecular weight of<br>
each chain of the polymer backbone can vary, it is typically in the range of from about 800<br>
Da to about 100,000 Da, often from about 6,000 Da to about 80,000 Da.<br>
[449]	Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing list for<br>
substantially water soluble backbones is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative,<br>
and that all polymeric materials having the qualities described above are contemplated as<br>
being suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
[450]	In some embodiments of the present invention the polymer derivatives are<br>
"multi-functional", meaning that the polymer backbone has at least two termini, and possibly<br>
as many as about 300 termini, functionalized or activated with a functional group.<br>
Multifunctional polymer derivatives include, but are not limited to, linear polymers having<br>
two termini, each terminus being bonded to a functional group which may be the same or<br>
different.<br>
[451]	In one embodiment, the polymer derivative has the structure:<br><br>
B is a linking moiety, which may be present or absent;<br>
POLY is a water-soluble non-antigenic polymer,<br>
A is a linking moiety, which may be present or absent and which may be the same as B or<br>
different; and<br>
X is a second functional group.<br><br>
Examples of a linking moiety for A and B include, but are not limited to, a multiply-fiinctionalized alkyl group containing up to 18, and more preferably between 1-10 carbon atoms. A heteroatom such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur may be included with the alkyl chain. The alkyl chain may also be branched at a heteroatom. Other examples of a linking moiety for A and B include, but are not limited to, a multiply functionalized aryl group, containing up to 10 and more preferably 5-6 carbon atoms. The aryl group may be substituted with one more carbon atoms, nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atoms. Other examples of suitable linking groups include those linking groups described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,932,462; 5,643,575; and U.S. Pat. Appl. Publication 2003/0143596, each of which is incorporated by reference herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing list for linking moieties is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative, and that all linking moieties having the qualities described above are contemplated to be suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
[452]	Examples of suitable functional groups for use as X include, but are not<br>
limited to, hydroxyl, protected hydroxyl, alkoxyl, active ester, such as N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters and 1 -benzotriazolyl esters, active carbonate, such as N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbonates and 1-benzotriazolyl carbonates, acetal, aldehyde, aldehyde hydrates, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, active sulfone, amine, aminooxy, protected amine, hydrazide, protected hydrazide, protected thiol, carboxylic acid, protected carboxylic acid, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, maleimide, vinylsulfone, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridine, iodoacetamide, epoxide, glyoxals, diones, mesylates, tosylaies, tresylate, alkene, ketone, and azide. As is understood by those skilled in the art, the selected X moiety should be compatible with the azide group so that reaction with the azide group does not occur. The azide-containing polymer derivatives may be homobifiinctional, meaning that the second functional group (i.e., X) is also an azide moiety, or heterobifunctional, meaning that the second functional group is a different functional group.<br>
[453]	The term "protected" refers to the presence of a protecting group or moiety<br>
that prevents reaction of the chemically reactive functional group under certain reaction conditions. The protecting group will vary depending on the type of chemically reactive group being protected. For example, if the chemically reactive group is an amine or a hydrazide, the protecting group can be selected from the group of tert-butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). If the chemically reactive group is a thiol, the<br><br>
protecting group can be orthopyridyldisulfide. If the chemically reactive group is a carboxylic acid, such as butanoic or propionic acid, or a hydroxyl group, the protecting group can be benzyl or an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, or tert-butyl. Other protecting groups known in the art may also be used in the present invention.<br>

the invention comprise a polymer backbone having the structure:<br><br><br>
In another embodiment, the polymer derivatives of the invention comprise a polymer backbone having the structure:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
W is an aliphatic or aromatic linker moiety comprising between 1-10 carbon atoms;<br>
n is about 20 to about 4000; and<br>
X is a functional group as described above, m is between 1 and 10.<br>
[456]	The azide-containing PEG derivatives of the invention can be prepared by a<br>
variety of methods known in the art and/or disclosed herein. In one method, shown below, a<br>
water soluble polymer backbone having an average molecular weight from about 800 Da to<br>
about 100,000 Da, the polymer backbone having a first terminus bonded to a first functional<br>
group and a second terminus bonded to a suitable leaving group, is reacted with an azide<br>
anion (which may be paired with any of a number of suitable counter-ions, including sodium,<br>
potassium, tert-butylammonium and so forth).  The leaving group undergoes a nucleophilic<br>
displacement and is replaced by the azide moiety, affording the desired azide-containing PEG<br>
polymer.<br>
X-PEG-L + N3" -» X-PEG- N3<br>
[457]	As shown, a suitable polymer backbone for use in the present invention has<br>
the formula X-PEG-L, wherein PEG is poly(ethylene glycol) and X is a functional group which does not react with azide groups and L is a suitable leaving group. Examples of suitable functional groups include, but are not limited to, hydroxyl, protected hydroxyl, acetal, alkenyl, amine, aminooxy, protected amine, protected hydrazide, protected thiol, carboxylic acid, protected carboxylic acid, maleimide, dithiopyridine, and vinylpyridine, and ketone. Examples of suitable leaving groups include, but are not limited to, chloride, bromide, iodide, mesylate, tresylate, and tosylate.<br>
[458]	In another method for preparation of the azide-containing polymer derivatives<br>
of the present invention, a linking agent bearing an azide functionality is contacted with a water soluble polymer backbone having an average molecular weight from about 800 Da to about 100,000 Da? wherein the linking agent bears a chemical functionality that will react selectively with a chemical functionality on the PEG polymer, to form an azide-containing<br><br>
polymer derivative product wherein the azide is separated from the polymer backbone by a<br>
linking group.<br>
[459]	An exemplary reaction scheme is shown below:<br>
X-PEG-M + N-linker-N=N=N -&gt; PG-X-PEG-linker-N=N=N<br>
wherein:<br>
PEG is poly(ethylene glycol) and X is a capping group such as alkoxy or a functional group<br>
as described above; and<br>
M is a functional group that is not reactive with the azide functionality but that will react<br>
efficiently and selectively with the N functional group.<br>
[460]	Examples of suitable functional groups include, but are not limited to, M being<br>
a carboxylic acid, carbonate or active ester if N is an amine; M being a ketone if N is a<br>
hydrazide or aminooxy moiety; M being a leaving group if N is a nucleophile.<br>
[461]	Purification of the crude product may be accomplished by known methods<br>
including, but are not limited to, precipitation of the product followed by chromatography, if<br>
necessary.<br>
[462]	A more specific example is shown below in the case of PEG diamine, in<br>
which one of the amines is protected by a protecting group moiety such as tert-butyl-Boc and<br>
the resulting mono-protected PEG diamine is reacted with a linking moiety that bears the<br>
azide functionality:<br>
BocHN-PEG~NH2 + HO2C-(CH2)3-N=N=N<br>
[463]	In this instance, the amine group can be coupled to the caiboxyiic acid group<br>
using a variety of activating agents such as thionyl chloride or carbodiimide reagents and N-hydroxysuccinimide or N-hydroxybenzotriazole to create an amide bond between the monoamine PEG derivative and the azide-bearing linker moiety. After successful formation of the amide bond, the resulting N-tert-butyi-Boc-protected azide-containing derivative can be used directly to modify bioactive molecules or it can be further elaborated to install other useful functional groups. For instance, the N-t-Boc group can be hydrolyzed by treatment with strong acid to generate an omega-amino-PEG-azide. The resulting amine can be used as a synthetic handle to install other useful functionality such as maleimide groups, activated disulfides, activated esters and so forth for the creation of valuable heterobifunctional reagents.<br><br>
[464]	Heterobifunctional derivatives are particularly useful when it is desired to<br>
attach different molecules to each terminus of the polymer. For example, the omega-N-amino-N-azido PEG would allow the attachment of a molecule having an activated electrophilic group, such as an aldehyde, ketone, activated ester, activated carbonate and so forth, to one terminus of the PEG and a molecule having an acetylene group to the other terminus of the PEG.<br>
[465]	In another embodiment of the invention, the polymer derivative has the<br>
structure:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
R can be either H or an alkyl, alkene, alkyoxy, or aryl or substituted aryl group;<br>
B is a linking moiety, which may be present or absent;<br>
POLY is a water-soluble non-antigenic polymer,<br>
A is a linking moiety, which may be present or absent and which may be the same as B or<br>
different; and<br>
X is a second functional group.<br>
[466]	Examples of a linking moiety for A and B include, but are not limited to, a<br>
multiply-functionalized alkyl group containing up to 18, and more preferably between 1-10<br>
carbon atoms.   A heteroatom such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur may be included with the<br>
alkyl chain.   The alkyl chain may also be branched at a heteroatom.   Other examples of a<br>
linking moiety for A and B include, but are not limited to, a multiply functionalized aryl<br>
group, containing up to 10 and more preferably 5-6 carbon atoms.  The aryl group may be<br>
substituted with one more carbon atoms, nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms.  Other examples<br>
of suitable linking groups include those linking groups described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,932,462<br>
and 5,643,575 and U.S. Pat Appl. Publication 2003/0143596, each of which is incorporated<br>
by reference herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the foregoing list for<br>
linking moieties is by no means exhaustive and is intended to be merely illustrative, and that<br>
a wide variety of linking moieties having the qualities described above are contemplated to be<br>
useful in the present invention.<br>
[467]	Examples of suitable functional groups  for use as  X include hydroxyl,<br>
protected hydroxyl, alkoxyl, active ester, such as N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters and 1-<br><br>
benzotriazolyl esters, active carbonate, such as N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbonates and 1-benzotriazolyl carbonates, acetal, aldehyde, aldehyde hydrates, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, active sulfone, amine, aminooxy, protected amine, hydrazide, protected hydrazide, protected thiol, carboxylic acid, protected carboxylic acid, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, maleimide, vinylsulfone, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridine, iodoacetamide, epoxide, glyoxals, diones, mesylates, tosylates, and tresylate, alkene, ketone, and acetylene. As would be understood, the selected X moiety should be compatible with the acetylene group so that reaction with the acetylene group does not occur. The acetylene -containing polymer derivatives may be homobifiinctkmal, meaning that the second functional group (i.e., X) is also an acetylene moiety, or heterobifunctional, meaning that the second functional group is a different functional group.<br>
[468]	In another embodiment of the present invention, the polymer derivatives<br>
comprise a polymer backbone having the structure:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
X is a functional group as described above;<br>
n is about 20 to about 4000; and<br>
m is between 1 and 10.<br>
Specific examples of each of the heterobifunctional PEG polymers are shown below.<br>
[469]	The acetylene-containing PEG derivatives of the invention can be prepared<br>
using methods known to those skilled in the art and/or disclosed herein. In one method, a<br>
water soluble polymer backbone having an average molecular weight from about 800 Da to<br>
about 100,000 Da, the polymer backbone having a first terminus bonded to a first functional<br>
group and a second terminus bonded to a suitable nucleophilic group, is reacted with a<br>
compound that bears both an acetylene functionality and a leaving group that is suitable for<br>
reaction with the nucleophilic group on the PEG.   When the PEG polymer bearing the<br>
nucleophilic moiety and the molecule bearing the leaving group are combined, the leaving<br>
group undergoes a nucleophilic displacement and is replaced by the nucleophilic moiety,<br>
affording the desired acetylene-containing polymer.<br><br><br>
[470]	As shown, a preferred polymer backbone for use in the reaction has the<br>
formula X-PEG-Nu, wherein PEG is polyethylene glycol), Nu is a nucleophilic moiety and<br>
X is a functional group that does not react with Nu, L or the acetylene functionality.<br>
[471]	Examples of Nu include, but are not limited to, amine, alkoxy, aryloxy,<br>
sulfhydryl, imino, carboxylate, hydrazide, aminoxy groups that would react primarily via a SN2-type mechanism. Additional examples of Nu groups include those functional groups that would react primarily via an nucleophilic addition reaction. Examples of L groups include chloride, bromide, iodide, mesylate, tresylate, and tosylate and other groups expected to undergo nucleophilic displacement as well as ketones, aldehydes, thioesters, olefins, alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl groups, carbonates and other electrophilic groups expected to undergo addition by nucleophiles.<br>
[472]	In another embodiment of the present invention, A is an aliphatic linker of<br>
between 1-10 carbon atoms or a substituted aryl ring of between 6-14 carbon atoms. X is a<br>
functional group which does not react with azide groups and L is a suitable leaving group<br>
[473]	In  another method  for preparation of the  acetylene-containing polymer<br>
derivatives of the invention, a PEG polymer having an average molecular weight from about<br>
800 Da to about 100,000 Da, bearing either a protected functional group or a capping agent at<br>
one terminus and a suitable leaving group at the other terminus is contacted by an acetylene<br>
anion.<br>
[474]	An exemplary reaction scheme is shown below:<br><br>
wherein:<br>
PEG is polyethylene glycol) and X is a capping group such as alkoxy or a functional group<br>
as described above; and<br>
R' is either H, an alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or aryloxy group or a substituted alkyl, alkoxyl, aryl or<br>
aryloxy group.<br>
[475]	In the example above, the leaving group L should be sufficiently reactive to<br>
undergo SN2-type displacement when contacted with a sufficient concentration of the<br>
acetylene anion.    The reaction conditions required to accomplish SN2 displacement of<br>
leaving groups by acetylene anions are well known in the art.<br><br>
[476]	Purification of the crude product can usually be accomplished by methods<br>
known in the art including, but are not limited to, precipitation of the product followed by chromatography, if necessary.<br>
[477]	Water soluble polymers can be linked to the antigen-binding polypeptides of<br>
the invention. The water soluble polymers may be linked via a non-naturally encoded amino acid incorporated in the antigen-binding polypeptide or any functional group or substituent of a non-naturally encoded or naturally encoded amino acid, or any functional group or substituent added to a non-naturally encoded or naturally encoded amino acid. Alternatively, the water soluble polymers are linked to an antigen-binding polypeptide incorporating a non-naturally encoded amino acid via a naturally-occurring amino acid (including but not limited to, cysteine, lysine or the amine group of the N-terrninal residue). In some cases, the ABP of the invention comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 non-natural amino acids, wherein one or more non-naturally-encoded amino acid(s) are linked to water soluble polymer(s) (including but not limited to, PEG and/or oligosacchandes). In some cases, the ABP of the invention further comprise 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, or more naturally-encoded amino acid(s) linked to water soluble polymers. In some cases, the ABP of the invention comprise one or more non-naturally encoded amino acid(s) linked to water soluble polymers and one or more naturally-occurring amino acids linked to water soluble polymers. In some embodiments, the water soluble polymers used in the present invention enhance the serum half-life of the ABP relative to the unconjugated form.<br>
[478]	The  number  of water  soluble  polymers   linked  to   an  antigen-binding<br>
polypeptide (i.e., the extent of PEGylation or glycosylation) of the present invention can be adjusted to provide an altered (including but not limited to, increased or decreased) pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic characteristic such as in vivo half-life. In some embodiments, the half-life of ABP is increased at least about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 percent, 2- fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 50-fold, or at least about 100-fold over an unmodified polypeptide.<br>
PEG derivatives containing a strong nucleophilic group (i.eM hydrazide, hydrazine, hvdroxylamine or semicarbazide)<br>

[495]	PEGylation (i.e., addition of any water soluble polymer) of antigen-binding<br>
polypeptides containing a non-naturally encoded ami-no acid, such as p-azido-L-phenylalanine, is carried out by any convenient method. For example, ABP is PEGylated with an alkyne-terminated mPEG derivative. Briefly, an excess of solid mPEG(5000)-O-CH2-G=CH is added, with stirring, to an aqueous solution of p-azido-L-Phe-containing ABP at room temperature. Typically, the aqueous solution is buffered with a buffer having a pK^ near the pH at which the reaction is to be carried out (generally about pH 4-10). Examples of suitable buffers for PEGylation at pH 7.5, for instance, include, but are not limited to, HEPES, phosphate, borate, TRIS-HC1, EPPS, and TES. The pH is continuously monitored and adjusted if necessary. The reaction is typically allowed to continue for between about 1-48 hours.<br>
[496]	The reaction products are subsequently subjected to hydrophobic interaction<br>
chromatography to separate the PEGylated ABP variants from free mPEG(5000)-O-CH2-C=CH and any high-molecular weight complexes of the pegylated ABP which may form when unblocked PEG is activated at both ends of the molecule, thereby crosslinking ABP variant molecules. The conditions during hydrophobic interaction chromatography are such that free mPEG(5000)-O-CH2-C=CH flows through the column, while any crosslinked PEGylated ABP variant complexes elute after the desired forms, which contain one ABP variant molecule conjugated to one or more PEG groups. Suitable conditions vary depending<br><br>
on the relative sizes of the cross-linked complexes versus the desired conjugates and are<br>
readily determined by those skilled in the art. The eluent containing the desired conjugates is<br>
concentrated by ultrafiltration and desalted by diafiltration.<br>
[497]	If   necessary,   the    PEGylated   ABP   obtained   from    the   hydrophobic<br>
chromatography can be purified further by one or more procedures known to those skilled in<br>
the art including, but are not limited to, affinity chromatography; anion- or cation-exchange<br>
chromatography (using, including but not limited to, DEAE SEPHAROSE); chromatography<br>
on silica; reverse phase HPLC; gel filtration (using, including but not limited to, SEPHADEX<br>
G-75); hydrophobic interaction chromatography; size-exclusion chromatography, metal-<br>
chelate chromatography; ultrafiltration/diafiltration; ethanol precipitation; ammonium sulfate<br>
precipitation; chromatofocusing; displacement chromatography; electrophoretic procedures<br>
(including  but  not  limited  to  preparative  isoelectric  focusing),   differential   solubility<br>
(including but not limited to ammonium sulfate precipitation), or extraction.    Apparent<br>
molecular weight may be estimated by GPC by comparison to globular protein standards<br>
(PROTEIN PURIFICATION METHODS, A PRACTICAL APPROACH (Harris &amp; Angal, Eds.) IRL Press<br>
1989, 293-306).    The purity of the ABP-PEG conjugate can be assessed by proteolytic<br>
degradation (including but not limited to, trypsin cleavage) followed by mass spectrometry<br>
analysis. Pepinsky B., et ai, 1 Pharmcol &amp; Exp. Ther. 297(3): 1059-66 (2001),<br>

Azide-containing PEG derivatives<br>
[499]	In another embodiment of the invention, an antigen-binding polypeptide is<br>
modified with a PEG derivative that contains an azide moiety that will react with an alkyne<br>
moiety present on the side chain of the non-naturally encoded amino acid.   In general, the<br>
PEG derivatives will have an average molecular weight ranging from 1-100 kDa and, in some<br>
embodiments, from 10-40 kDa.<br>

Enhancing affinity for serum albumin<br>
[512]	Various molecules can also be fused to the antigen-binding polypeptides of the<br>
invention to modulate the half-life of ABP in serum. In some embodiments, molecules are linked or fused to antigen-binding polypeptides of the invention to enhance affinity for endogenous serum albumin in an animal.<br>
[513]	For example, in some cases, a recombinant fusion of an antigen-binding<br>
polypeptide and an albumin binding sequence is made.    Exemplary albumin binding<br><br>
sequences include, but are not limited to, the albumin binding domain from streptococcal<br>
protein G {see. e.g., Makrides et aL, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Tlier. 277:534-542 (1996) and<br>
Sjolander et al J, Immunol Methods 201:115-123 (1997)), or albumin-binding peptides such<br>
as those described in, e.g., Dennis, et al, J. BioL Chem. 277:35035-35043 (2002).<br>
[514]	In  other  embodiments,  the  antigen-binding  polypeptides  of the present<br>
invention are acylated with fatty acids.   In some cases, the fatty acids promote binding to<br>
serum albumin. See, e.g., Kurtzhals, et al, Biochenu J. 312:725-731 (1995).<br>
[515]	In other embodiments, the antigen-binding polypeptides of the invention are<br>
fused directly with serum albumin (including but not limited to, human serum albumin). Those of skill in the art will recognize that a wide variety of other molecules can also be linked to ABP in the present invention to modulate binding to serum albumin or other serum components.<br>
X.	Glycosylation of ABP<br>
[516]	The invention includes antigen-binding polypeptides incorporating one or more<br>
non-naturally encoded amino acids bearing sacchande residues. The saccharide residues may be either natural (including but not limited to, N-acetylglucosamine) or non-natural (including but not limited to, 3-fluorogalactose). The saccharides may be linked to the non-naturally encoded amino acids either by an N- or O-linked glycosidic linkage (including but not limited to, N-acetylgalactose-L-serine) or a non-natural linkage (including but not limited to, an oxime or the corresponding C- or S-linked glycoside).<br>
[517]	The saccharide (including but not limited to, glycosyl) moieties can be added to<br>
antigen-binding polypeptides either in vivo or in vitro. In some embodiments of the invention, a nantigen-binding polypeptide comprising a caxbonyl-containing non-naturally encoded amino acid is modified with a saccharide derivatized with an aminooxy group to generate the corresponding glycosylated polypeptide linked via an oxime linkage. Once attached to the non-naturally encoded ami-no acid, the saccharide may be further elaborated by treatment with glycosyltransferases and other enzymes to generate an oligosaccharide bound to the antigen-binding polypeptide. See, e.g., H. Liu, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125: 1702-1703 (2003).<br>
[518]	In some embodiments  of the invention,  an antigen-binding polypeptide<br>
comprising a carbonyl-containing non-naturally encoded amino acid is modified directly with a glycan with defined structure prepared as an aminooxy derivative.   One skilled in the art<br><br>
will recognize that other functionalities, including azide, alkyne, hydrazide, hydrazine, and<br>
semicarbazide, can be used to link the saccharide to the non-naturally encoded amino acid.<br>
[519]	In  some  embodiments  of the  invention,  an  antigen-binding polypeptide<br>
comprising an azide or alkynyl-containing non-naturally encoded amino acid can then be<br>
modified by, including but not limited to, a Huisgen [34-2] cycloaddition reaction with,<br>
including but not limited to, alkynyl or azide derivatives, respectively.  This method allows<br>
for proteins to be modified with extremely high selectivity.<br>
XI.	ABP Dimers and Multimers<br>
[520]	The present invention also provides for ABP combinations including but not<br>
limited to ABP homodimers, heterodhners, homomultimers, or heteromultimers (i.e., trimers, tetramers, etc.) where an ABP polypeptide containing one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids is bound to another ABP or variant thereof or any other polypeptide that is non-ABP polypeptide or variant thereof, either directly to the polypeptide backbone or via a linker. Due to its increased molecular weight compared to monomers, the ABP dimer or multimer conjugates may exhibit new or desirable properties, including but not limited to different pharmacological, phannacokinetic, phannacodynamic, modulated therapeutic half-life, or modulated plasma half-life relative to the monomeric ABP. In some embodiments, the ABP dimers of the invention will modulate the dimerization of the ABP receptor. In other embodiments, the ABP dimers or multimers of the present invention will act as an ABP receptor antagonist, agonist, or modulator.<br>
[521]	In some embodiments, one or more of ABP present in an ABP containing<br>
dimer or multimer comprises a non-naturally encoded amino acid linked to a water soluble polymer. In some embodiments, the ABPs are linked directly, including but not limited to, via an Asn-Lys amide linkage or Cys-Cys disulfide linkage. In some embodiments, the linked ABPs, and/or the linked non-ABP poljpeptide, will comprise different non-naturally encoded amino acids to facilitate dimerization, including but not limited to, an alkyne in. one non-naturally encoded amino acid of a first ABP and an azide in a second non-naturally encoded amino acid of a second ABP will be conjugated via a Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition. Alternatively, a first ABP, and/or the linked non-ABP polypeptide comprising a ketone-containing non-naturally encoded amino acid can be conjugated to a second ABP polypeptide comprising a hydroxylamine-containing non-naturally encoded amino acid and the polypeptides are reacted via formation of the corresponding oxime.<br><br>
[522]	Alternatively, the two ABPs, and/or the linked non- ABP polypeptide, are<br>
linked via a linker. Any hetero- or homo-bifunctional linker can be used to link the two ABPs, and/or the linked non- ABP polypeptides, which can have the same or different primary sequence. In some cases, the linker used to tether the ABP, and/or the linked non-ABP polypeptides together can be a bifunctional PEG reagent. The linker may have a wide range of molecular weight or molecular length. Larger or smaller molecular weight linkers may be used to provide a desired spatial relationship or conformation between the ABP and the linked entity. Linkers having longer or shorter molecular length may also be used to provide a desired space or flexibility between the ABP and the linked entity. Similarly, a linker having a particular shape or conformation may be utilized to impart a particular shape or conformation to the ABP or the linked entity, either before or after the ABP reaches its target. The functional groups present on each end of the linker may be selected to modulate the release of an ABP or a non-ABP polypeptide under desired conditions. This optimization of the spatial relationship between the ABP and the linked entity may provide new, modulated, or desired properties to the molecule.<br>
[523]	In  some  embodiments,  the invention provides water-soluble bifunctional<br>
linkers that have a dumbbell structure that includes: a) an azide, an alkyne, a hydrazine, a hydrazide, a hydroxylamine, or a carbonyl-containing moiety on at least a first end of a polymer backbone; and b) at least a second functional group on a second end of the polymer backbone. The second functional group can be the same or different as the first functional group. The second functional group, in some embodiments, is not reactive with the first functional group. The invention provides, in some embodiments, water-soluble compounds that comprise at least one aim of a branched molecular structure. For example, the branched molecular structure can be dendritic.<br>
[524]	In some embodiments, the invention provides multimers comprising one or<br>
more ABP formed by reactions with water soluble activated polymers that have the structure: R-(CH2CH2O)n-O-(CH2)m-X<br>
wherein n is from about 5 to 3,000, m is 2-10, X can be an azide, an alkyne, a hydrazine, a hydrazide, an aminooxy group, a hydroxylamine, a acetyl, or carbonyl-containing moiety, and R is a capping group, a functional group, or a leaving group that can be the same or different as X. R can be, for example, a functional group selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, protected hydroxyl, alkoxyl, N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester, 1-benzotriazolyl ester,  N-hydroxysuccinimidyl   carbonate,   1 -benzotriazolyl   carbonate,   acetal,   aldehyde,<br><br>
aldehyde hydrates, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, active sulfone, amine, aminooxy, protected amine, hydrazide, protected hydrazide, protected thiol, carboxylic acid, protected carboxylic acid, isocyanate, isothiocyanate, maleimide, vinylsulfone, dithiopyridine, vinylpyridine, iodoacetamide, epoxide, glyoxals, diones, mesylates, tosylates, and tresylate, alkene, and ketone.<br>
XII	Measurement ofABP Activity and Affinity ofABPfor the ABP Antigen or<br>
Binding Partner<br>
[525]	ABP activity can be determined using standard in vitro or in vivo assays. For<br>
example, cells or cell lines that bind ABP (including but not limited to, cells containing native ABP antigen or binding partner or recombinant ABP antigen or binding partner producing cells) can be used to monitor ABP binding. For a non-PEGylated or PEGylated antigen-binding polypeptide comprising a non-natural amino acid, the affinity of the ABP for its antigen or binding partner can be measured by using techniques known in the art such as a BIAcore™ biosensor (Pharmacia).<br>
[526]	Regardless of which methods are used to create the ABP's, the ABP's are<br>
subject to assays for biological activity. Tritiated thymidine assays may be conducted to ascertain the degree of cell division, if appropriate. Other biological assays, however, may be used to ascertain the desired activity. Biological assays such as measuring the ability to inhibit an antigen's biological activity, such as an enzymatic, proliferate ve, or metabolic activity also provides an indication of ABP activity. Other in vitro assays may be used to ascertain biological activity. In general, the test for biological activity should provide analysis for the desired result, such as increase or decrease in biological activity (as compared to non-altered ABP), different biological activity (as compared to non-altered ABP), receptor affinity analysis, conformational or structural changes, or serum half-life analysis, as appropriate for the antigen's biological activity.<br>
[527]	The   above   compilation  of references   for   assay  methodologies   is  not<br>
exhaustive, and those skilled in the art will recognize other assays useful for testing for the desired end result.<br>
XIII	Measurement    of   Potency,     Functional    In     Vivo    Half-Life,     and<br>
Pharmacokinetic Parameters<br>
[528]	An important aspect of the invention is the prolonged biological half-life that is<br>
obtained by construction of ABP with or without conjugation of the ABP to a water soluble polymer moiety.  The rapid decrease of ABP serum concentrations has made it important to<br><br>
evaluate biological responses to treatment with conjugated and non-conjugated ABP and variants thereof. Preferably, the conjugated and non-conjugated ABP and variants thereof of the present invention have prolonged serum half-lives also after i.v. administration, making it possible to measure by, e.g. ELISA method or by a primary screening assay. Measurement of in vivo biological half-life is carried out as described herein.<br>
[529]	Pharmacokinetic parameters for an antigen-binding polypeptide comprising a<br>
non-naturally encoded amino acid can be evaluated in normal Sprague-Dawley male rats (N=5 animals per treatment group). Animals will receive either a single dose of 25 ug/rat iv or 50 ug/rat sc, and approximately 5-7 blood samples will be taken according to a pre-defined time course, generally covering about 6 hours for a n antigen-binding polypeptide comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid not conjugated to a water soluble polymer and about 4 days for an antigen-binding polypeptide comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid and conjugated to a water soluble polymer. Pharmacokinetic data for ABP is well-studied in several species and can be compared directly to the data obtained for ABP comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid.<br>
[530]	The specific activity of ABP in accordance with this invention can be<br>
determined by various assays known in the art. The biological activity of the ABP muteins,<br>
or fragments thereof, obtained and purified in accordance with this invention can be tested by<br>
methods described or referenced herein or known to those skilled in the art.<br>
XIV.	Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[531]	The polypeptides or proteins of the invention (including but not limited to,<br>
ABP, synthetases, proteins comprising one or more unnatural amino acid, etc.) are optionally employed for therapeutic uses, including but not limited to, in combination with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. Such compositions, for example, comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the compound, and a phannaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient Such a carrier or excipient includes, but is not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and/or combinations thereof. The formulation is made to suit the mode of administration. In general, methods of administering proteins are well known in the art and can be applied to administration of the polypeptides of the invention.<br>
[532]	Therapeutic  compositions  comprising  one   or  more  polypeptide  of the<br>
invention are optionally tested in one or more appropriate in vitro and/or in vivo animal models of disease, to confirm efficacy, tissue metabolism, and to estimate dosages, according to methods well known in the art.   In particular, dosages can be initially determined by<br><br>
activity, stability or other suitable measures of unnatural herein to natural amino acid homologues (including but not limited to, comparison of an ABP modified to include one or more unnatural amino acids to a natural amino acid ABP), i.e., in a relevant assay.<br>
[533]	Administration is by any of the routes normally used for introducing a<br>
molecule into ultimate contact with blood or tissue cells. The unnatural amino acid polypeptides of the invention are administered in any suitable manner, optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable methods of administering such polypeptides in the context of the present invention to a patient are available, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular composition, a particular route can often provide a more immediate and more effective action or reaction than another route.<br>
[534]	Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular<br>
composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention.<br>
[535]	Polypeptide  compositions  can be  administered by  a number  of routes<br>
including, but not limited to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, transdennal, subcutaneous, topical, sublingual, or rectal means. Compositions comprising non-natural amino acid polypeptides, modified or unmodified, can also be administered via liposomes. Such administration routes and appropriate formulations are generally known to those of skill in the art.<br>
[536]	The ABP comprising a non-natural amino acid, alone or in combination with<br>
other suitable components, can also be made into aerosol formulations (i.e., they can be "nebulized") to be administered via inhalation. Aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like.<br>
[537]	Formulations suitable for parenteral administration, such as, for example, by<br>
intraarticular (in the joints), intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous routes, include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers,<br><br>
and preservatives. The formulations of packaged ABP can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampules and vials.<br>
[538]	Parenteral   administration   and   intravenous   administration   are   preferred<br>
methods of administration. In particular the routes of administration already in use for natural amino acid homologue therapeutics (including but not limited to, those typically used for EPO, GH, ABP, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFNs, interleukins, antibodies, and/or any other pharmaceutically delivered protein), along with formulations in current use, provide preferred routes of administration and formulation for the polypeptides of the invention.<br>
[539]	The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention, is<br>
sufficient to have a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time, or, including but not limited to, to inhibit infection by a pathogen, or other appropriate activity, depending on the application. The dose is determined by the efficacy of the particular vector, or formulation, and the activity, stability or serum half-life of the unnatural amino acid polypeptide employed and the condition of the patient, as well as the body weight or surface area of the patient to be treated. The size of the dose is also determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular vector, formulation, or the like in a particular patient<br>
[540]	In determining the effective amount of the vector or formulation to be<br>
administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of disease (including but not limited to, cancers, inherited diseases, diabetes, AIDS, or the like), the physician evaluates circulating plasma levels, formulation toxicities, progression of the disease, and/or where relevant, the production of anti- unnatural amino acid polypeptide antibodies.<br>
[541]	The dose administered, for example, to a 70 kilogram patient, is typically in<br>
the range equivalent to dosages of currently-used therapeutic proteins, adjusted for the altered activity or serum half-life of the relevant composition. The vectors of this invention can supplement treatment conditions by any known conventional therapy, including antibody administration, vaccine administration, administration of cytotoxic agents, natural amino acid polypeptides, nucleic acids, nucleotide analogues, biologic response modifiers, and the like.<br>
[542]	For administration, formulations of the present invention are administered at a<br>
rate determined by the LD-50 or ED-50 of the relevant formulation, and/or observation of any side-effects of the unnatural amino acids at various concentrations, including but not<br><br>
limited to, as applied to the mass and overall health of the patient. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses.<br>
[543]	If a patient undergoing infusion of a formulation develops fevers, chills, or<br>
muscle aches, he/she receives the appropriate dose of aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen or other pain/fever controlling drug. Patients who experience reactions to the infusion such as fever, muscle aches, and chills are premedicated 30 minutes prior to the future infusions with either aspirin, acetaminophen, or, including but not limited to, diphenhydramine. Meperidine is used for more severe chills and muscle aches that do not quickly respond to antipyretics and antihistamines. Cell infusion is slowed or discontinued depending upon the severity of the reaction.<br>
[544]	Human antigen-binding polypeptides of the invention can be administered<br>
directly to a mammalian subject. Administration is by any of the routes normally used for introducing ABP to a subject. The ABP compositions according to embodiments of the present invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, inhalation (including but not limited to, via an aerosol), buccal (including but not limited to, sub-lingual), vaginal, parenteral (including but not limited to, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradennal, intraarticular, intrapleural, intraperitoneal, inracerebral, intraarterial, or intravenous), topical (i.e., both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces) and transdermal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated. Administration can be either local or systemic. The formulations of compounds can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampoules and vials. ABP of the invention can be prepared in a mixture in a unit dosage injectable form (including but not limited to, solution, suspension, or emulsion) with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. ABP of the invention can also be administered by continuous infusion (using, including but not limited to, minipumps such as osmotic pumps), single bolus or slow-release depot formulations.<br>
[545]	Formulations suitable for administration include aqueous and non-aqueous<br>
solutions, isotonic sterile solutions, which can contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. Solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described.<br><br>
[546]	The   pharmaceutical   compositions   of   the   invention   may   comprise   a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions (including optional phaimaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers) of the present invention {see, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17   ed. 1985)).<br>
[547]	Suitable carriers include buffers containing phosphate, borate, HEPES, citrate,<br>
and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight Qess than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disacchandes, and other carbohydrates, including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; divalent metal ions such as zinc, cobalt, or copper; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counter ions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as Tween™, Pluronics™, or PEG.<br>
[548]	ABP's of the invention, including those linked to water soluble polymers such<br>
as PEG can also be administered by or as part of sustained-release systems. Sustained-release compositions include, including but not limited to, semi-permeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, including but not limited to, films, or microcapsules. Sustained-release matrices include from biocompatible materials such as poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (Langer et al, J. Biom&amp;L Mater. Res., 15: 167-277 (1981); Langer, Chem. Tech., 12: 98-105 (1982), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al, supra) or poly-D-(-&gt;3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988), polylactides (polylactic acid) (U.S. Patent No. 3,773,919; EP 58,481), polyglycolide (polymer of glycolic acid), polylactide co-glycolide (copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid) polyanhydrides, copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate (U.

[550]	The dose administered to a patient in the context of the present invention<br>
should be sufficient to cause a beneficial response in the subject over time. Generally, the total pharmaceutically effective amount of the ABP of the present invention administered parenterally per dose is in the range of about 0.01 /ig/kg/day to about 100 ixgfkg, or about 0.05 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, of patient body weight, although this is subject to therapeutic discretion. The frequency of dosing is also subject to therapeutic discretion, and may be more frequent or less frequent than the commercially available ABP products approved for use in humans. Generally, a PEGylated antigen-binding polypeptide of the invention can be administered by any of the routes of administration described above.<br>
XV.	Therapeutic Uses of Antigen-Binding Polypeptides of the Invention<br>
[551]	The ABP polypeptides of the invention are useful for treating a wide range of<br>
disorders. The pharmaceutical compositions containing the ABP may be formulated at a strength effective for administration by various means to a human patient experiencing disorders that may be affected by ABP agonists or antagonists, such as but not limited to, anti-proliferatives, anti-inflammatory, or anti-virals are used, either alone or as part of a<br><br>
condition or disease. Average quantities of ABP may vary and in particular should be based upon the recommendations and prescription of a qualified physician. The exact amount of ABP is a matter of preference subject to such factors as the exact type of condition being treated, the condition of the patient being treated, as well as the other ingredients in the composition. The invention also provides for administration of a therapeutically effective amount of another active agent such as an anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent. The amount to be given may be readily determined by one skilled in the art based upon therapy with ABP.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[552]	The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed<br>
invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
[553]	This example describes one of the many potential sets of criteria for the<br>
selection of preferred sites of incorporation of non-nalurally encoded amino acids into ABP.<br>
[554]	This example demonstrates how preferred sites within the antigen-binding<br>
polypeptide were selected for introduction of a non-naturally encoded amino acid. The three dimensional structure composed of two molecules of ABP, or the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ABP was used to determine preferred positions into which one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids could be introduced,<br>
[555]	The following criteria were used to evaluate each position of ABP for the<br>
introduction of a non-naturally encoded amino acid: the residue (a) should not interfere with binding of either ABP based on structural analysis of three dimensional structures, or the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of ABP, b) should not be affected by alanine or homolog scanning mutagenesis (c) should be surface exposed and exhibit minimal van der Waals or hydrogen bonding interactions with surrounding residues, (d) may be on one or more of the exposed faces of ABP, (e) may be a site or sites of ABP that are juxtaposed to a second ABP, or other molecule or fragment thereof (f) should be either deleted or variable in ABP variants, (g) would result in conservative changes upon substitution with a non-naturally encoded amino acid, (h) may modulate the conformation of the ABP itself or a dimer or multimer comprising one or more ABP, by altering the flexibility or rigidity of the complete structure as desired, (i) could be found in either highly flexible regions or structurally rigid<br><br>
regions and (j) are found in complementarity determining regions (CDR) or not. In addition, further calculations were performed on the ABP molecule, utilizing the Cx program (Pintar et al. Bioinformatics, 18, pp 980) to evaluate the extent of protrusion for each protein atom. As a result, in some embodiments, the non-naturally encoded encoded amino acid is substituted at, but not limited to, one or more positions of ABP.<br>
Example 2<br>
[556]	This example details cloning and expression of ABP including a non-naturally<br>
encoded amino acid in E. coli.<br>
[557]	An introduced translation system that comprises an orthogonal tRNA (O-<br>
tRNA) and an orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (O-RS) is used to express ABP<br>
containing a non-naturally encoded amino acid.  The O-RS preferentially aminoacylates the<br>
O-tRNA with a non-naturally encoded amino acid.  In turn the translation system inserts the<br>
non-naturally encoded amino acid into ABP, in response to an encoded selector codon.<br><br><br>
[558]	The transformation of E. coli with plasmids containing the modified ABP gene<br>
and the orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair (specific for the desired non-naturally encoded amino acid) allows the site-specific incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acid into the ABP. The transformed E. coli, grown at 37° C in media containing between 0.01 - 100 mM of the particular non-naturally encoded amino acid, expresses modified ABP with high fidelity and efficiency. The His-tagged ABP containing a non-naturally encoded amino acid is produced by the E. coli host cells as inclusion bodies or aggregates. The aggregates are solubilized and affinity purified under denaturing conditions in 6M guanidine HC1. Refolding is performed by dialysis at 4"C overnight in 50mM TRIS-HC1, pH8.0, 40/AM CUSO4, and 2% (w/v) Sarkosyl. The material is then dialyzed against 20mM TRIS-HC1, pH 8.0, lOOmM NaCl, 2mM CaCl2, followed by removal of the His-tag. See Boissel et al., (1993) 268:15983-93. Methods for purification of ABP are well known in the art and are confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Western Blot analyses, or electrospray-ionization ion trap mass spectrometry and the like. Expression Constructs<br>
[559]	Periplasmic scFv-108: The variable regions (VL and VH) of the EGFR-<br>
specific monoclonal antibody mAbl08 (U.S. Patent Number 6,217,866 which is incorporated by reference herein) were cloned as a scFv fragment with (GGGGS)4 linker sequence downstream of a yeast BGL2 (C7) periplasmic leader sequence (Humphreys, DP et al. Protein Expr Purif. 2000 Nov;20(2):252-64). An epitope sequence recognized by the c-myc antibody as well as a 6X-His tag were cloned downstream of the VL domain. The wild type scFv-108 construct, as well as variants containing the amber stop codon (TAG) in the VL domain (see Figure 2, Panel A) were cloned into an E. coli expression vector under the control of an inducible promoter. This plasmid also constitutively expressed an amber suppressor tyrosyl tRNATyr/CUA from Methanococcus jannaschii (Mj tRNATyi/CUA). Locations of the amber stop codons are indicated. The construct made is shown as SEQ ID NO: 18 (nucleotide sequence) and SEQ ID NO: 19 (translated protein sequence). The construct is described in Tables 3 and 4.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
tRNA-synthetase from M. jannaschii (MjTyrRS) used was specific for this amino acid. Suppression was achieved by the addition of aa9.2 (4 mM) at the time of induction. Protein Extraction and Purification<br>
[566]	Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in periplasmic release<br>
buffer (50 mM NaPO4, 20% sucrose, lmM EDTA, pH 8.0) supplemented with 100 ug/ml of lysozyme and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. After centrifiigation, antibody fragments in the supernatant were immobilized on ProBind beads (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) by virtue of their His tag, the beads washed extensively with binding buffer and then the bound fragments eluted from the beads with 0.5 M imidazole. Purified fragments were dialyzed in storage buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5% sucrose, pH 7.8). For small scale analysis of scFv fragments expressed in the cytoplasm, E. coli from 15 ml of culture were collected by centrifiigation and re-suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (B-PER, Pierce Biotechnology; Rockford, IL) supplemented with 10 ug/ml of DNase. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, diluted to IX in Protein Loading buffer (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.<br>
[567]	Figure 3, Panel A shows the suppression of amber mutations in the second<br>
serine of the GlySer linker (S131Am), and purification of the corresponding pAcF-containing scFv is shown (Figure 3, Panel B). The Western blot analysis shown as Figure 3, Panel A demonstrates that pAcF is required to suppress the amber stop mutation when the cells are grown either in LB or Superbroth media. The presence of pAcF does not affect expression of a scFv lacking the TAG stop codon (WT scFv-108). Figure 3, Panel B shows the purification of pAcF-scFv 108-(S 131) by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Estimated yield of the pAcF-containing scFv was 1.5 mg/L. Position of the scFv fragment is indicated by the arrowhead. The Coomassie gel was loaded as follows: lane 1—scFv control (1.7 ug); lane 2—MAC pre-bind (20 ul/70 ml); lane 3—MAC void (20 ul/70 ml); lane 4—MAC elution (5 ul/1.3 ml); lane 5—NAP10 buffer exchange (10 ul/1.5 ml); lane 6—MAC beads post-elution; lane 7—scFv control (3.4 ug).<br>
[568]	Suppression of an amber mutation in the VL chain (LI 56) during cytoplasmic<br>
expression of a scFv is shown in Figure 4.  Yields were &gt;100 mg/L of E. coli culture, and suppression of the stop codon was absolutely dependent on the presence of pAcF. Full length scFv is indicated by the arrowhead. Products truncated at the amber codon are indicated by a filled circle. PEGylation/Dimerization of antibody fragments (1)<br><br>
[569]	PEGylation: Approximately 1 mg of pAcF-scFv-108 protein was concentrated<br>
in reaction buffer (100 mM NaOAc, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 4.0) to a final volume of 50 ul. The reaction mixture was incubated at 28°C for 32 hours with a 100-fold molar excess of mono-functional (hydroxylamine) 5K PEG (equilibrated in reaction buffer) in a final volume of 100 ul. PEGylated material was evaluated following gel electrophoresis and used directly in cell binding assays.<br>
[570]	Dimerization: A similar procedure was used to dimerize pAcF-containing<br>
scFv-108 fragments. Briefly, the starting pAcF containing scFv fragments were concentrated to a concentration of &gt; 5 ug/ul in reaction buffer and then incubated with a bi-functional hydroxylamine-conjugated PEG linker (364 Da). Unreactive PEG was removed by dialysis, and a fresh aliquot of pAcF-scFv fragment (1 molar protein:protein equivalence) was added to the mixture. The mixture was then incubated at 28°C for another 32 hours. The dimer was loaded onto a cation ion exchange column (SP-5PW) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.0) and eluted over a NaCl gradient (0- 0.4M).<br>
[571]	PEGylation and dimerization of pAcF-scFv-108 fragments is shown in Figure<br>
5. Figure 5, Panel A shows PEGylation (5K) of pAcF-scFv-108-(L156) and pAcF-scFv-108-<br>
(S136) and dimerization of pAcF-scFv-108-(S136). The gel was loaded as follows: lane 1—<br>
pAcF-scFv-108-(L156) (5K PEG); lane 2—pAcF-scFv-108-(S136) (5K PEG); lane 3—<br>
dimerization of pAcF-scFv-108-(S136) (364 da PEG) linker, lane A—dimerization of pAcF-<br>
scFv-108-(S136); linker was not removed following the first PEGylation reaction. Position of<br>
the mono-PEGylated scFv fragments and the scFv-108-(S136) dimer are indicated by the<br>
single and double arrowheads, respectively. The absence of dimerization in lane 4<br>
demonstrates that scFv were not coupled through inter-molecular disulfide bond formation.<br>
Figure 5, Panel C shows that the conjugation of PEG to scFv fragments is absolutely<br>
dependent on the presence of pAcF. No PEGylation of WT scFv fragments was observed.<br>
The gel was loaded as follows: lane 1—WT scFv 108 control; lane 2—scFv WT, in reaction<br>
buffer, no PEG, 16 hours; lane 3—scFv WT + 5K PEG, in reaction buffer, 16 hours.<br>
[572]	Figure 6 shows SDS PAGE analysis of fractions taken during cation exchange<br>
chromatography of scFv homodimers. pAcF-scFvl 08-(S 131) fragments were homodimerized using a bifunctional hydroxylamine 364 dalton PEG linker. Fractions were taken at different points in the NaCl gradient (0 - 0.4 M) during cation exchange chromatography. The gel was loaded as follows: lane 1—marker, lane 2—pAcF-scFvlO8(S131)-X-pAcF-scFvlO8(S131) Fraction #1, lane 3—pAcF-scFvl08(S131)-X-pAcF-<br><br>
scFvlO8(S131) Fraction #2, lane 4—pAcF-scFvlO8(S131)-X-pAcF-scFvlO8(S131) Fraction #3.<br>
[573]	Figure 8, Panel A shows SDS PAGE analysis of pAcF and pAcF-PEGylated<br>
Fab fragments. Fab-108 fragments modified at K142, T204, and K219 are shown, and the efficiency of PEGylation is site specific. PEGylation of pAcF-containing Fab fragments was performed using hydroxylamine conjugated 5KPEG.<br>
[574]	Figure 10, Panel A and B show suppression of an amber mutation in the<br>
second serine of the GlySer linker of the C-terminal (pAcF-scFv-4D5-His (S133); Figure 10, Panel A) or N-terminal (pAcF-His-scFv-4D5(S139); Figure 10, Panel B) scFv-4D5 fragments. Expression of the scFv proteins was induced by the addition of 0.02% arabinose for either 5 hours or overnight (16 hours). Suppression of the amber mutation was achieved by the concomitant addition of aa9.2 (4 mM). The suppressed product is indicated by the arrowhead, and the truncated protein by the filled-in circle. Suppression yields of greater than 50% were achieved (1.5 mg/L). The control lane loaded with scFv 108, which runs slightly higher than scFv-4D5, is indicated (C).<br>
[575]	Fab fragments pAcF-Fab-4D5-(K139) and Fab-4D5-cys were expressed and<br>
purified in the same manner. Figure 11, Panel A shows samples resolved by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. Fab fragment yields were as follows: pAcF-Fab-4D5-(K139)3 0.37 mg/L/OD (final OD600 = 3.14) and Fab-4D5-cys 0.23 mg/L/OD (final ODeoo = 3.26). Figure 11, Panel B shows a Western blot of samples (5 ul) shown in Figure 11, Panel A using an anti-His antibody. The samples were run undo" non-reducing conditions. Multimeric VH-CH1 complexes from the Fab-4D5-cys construct are indicated with arrows. No multimeric complexes were seen with pAcF-Fab-4D5-(K139). PEGylation/Dimerization of antibody fragments (2)<br>
[576]	PEGylation: Approximately 1 mg of pAcF-scFv-108 protein was concentrated<br>
in native reaction buffer (20 mM NaOAc, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 4.0) and<br>
denaturing reaction buffer (20 mM NaOAc, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 8 M Urea, pH 4.0)<br>
to a final volume of 50 ul. The reaction mixture was incubated at 28 °C for 32 hours with a<br>
100-fold molar excess of mono-functional (hydroxylamine) 5K PEG (equilibrated in<br>
corresponding reaction buffers) in a final volume of 100 ul. After 16 hours, the reaction<br>
mixture was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and used directly in cell binding assays.<br>
[577]	Conjugation of a polypeptide with a linker, polymer, biologically active<br>
molecule, or other molecule under denaturing conditions may have one or more advantages.<br><br>
Such advantages include, but are not limited to, easier conjugation due to the improved accessibility of the reactive group, easier refolding of the conjugated polypeptide compared to non-conjugated polypeptide, and the ability to use polypeptide at a higher concentration for conjugation than the polypeptide concentration usable under non-denaturing conditions. Denaturing conditions maybe desired, for example, if the polypeptide is unstable and cannot be highly concentrated for the conjugation reaction. However, conjugation of polypeptides under denaturing conditions may result in undesirable and/or unintended sites of conjugation in polyp eptides with one or more cysteines, lysines, or other amino acids upon reaction with standard cysteine-based conjugation chemistries such as maleimide chemistries, or lysine-based chemistries such as maleimide chemistries. Such undesirable and/or unintended sites of conjugation may have an impact on the activity of the conjugated polypeptide. On the other hand, polypeptides such as ABP comprising one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids may be conjugated in a site-specific manner under denaturing conditions since the reactive groups involved in the conjugation reaction are part of a non-naturally encoded amino acid. Thus, any advantages obtained from conjugation under denaturing conditions may be exploited with the use of polypeptides comprising one or more non-naturally encoded amino acids.<br>
[578]	Figure 5B shows SDS-PAGE analysis of PEGylated pAcF-scFv-(S136) and<br>
control samples. The gel was loaded as follows: lane 1—pAcF-scFv-(S136); lane 2— pAcF-scFv-(S136), incubated at 28 °C for 16 hours; lane 3~pAcF-scFv-(S136), 5 K PEG, incubated at 28°C for 16 hours, native condition; lane 4—pAcF-scFv-(S136), 5 K PEG, incubated at 28 °C for 16 hours, denaturing condition. Arrows indicate scFv and PEGylated scFv. Figure 5C shows that the conjugation of PEG to scFv fragments is absolutely dependent on the presence of pAcF. No PEGylation of WT scFv fragments was observed. The gel was loaded as follows: lane 1—WT scFv 108 control; lane 2—scFv WT, in reaction buffer, no PEG, 16 hours; lane 3—scFv WT + 5K PEG, in reaction buffer, 16 hours.<br>
[579]	Sequential dimerization: Briefly, the starting pAcF containing scFv fragments<br>
were concentrated to a concentration of 10 mg/ml in reaction buffer and then incubated with 100 fold excess of a bi-functional hydroxylamine-conjugated PEG linker (364 Da). The reaction mixture was incubated for 16 hours at 28°C. Unreactive PEG was removed by dialysis, and a fresh aliquot of pAcF-scFv fragment (1 molar proteinrprotein equivalence) was added to the mixture. The mixture was then incubated at 28 °C for another 32 hours. See Figure 13.   The dimer was loaded onto a cation ion exchange column (SP-5PW, 20<br><br>
micron) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.0) and eluted over a NaCl gradient (0- 0.4M).<br>
[580]	Figure 14, Panel A and B show non-reducing and reducing SDS PAGE<br>
analysis of dimerization samples. The gels were loaded as follows: lane 1—final scFv<br>
dimerization reaction mixture with 364 Da PEG bifunctional linker; lane 2—final scFv<br>
dimerization reaction control without 364 Da PEG bifunctional linker; Iane3—scFv. Arrows<br>
indicate scFv dimers and scFv monomers. scFv dimers were synthesized only in the presence<br>
of the bifunctional linker. The absence of dimerization in lane 2 demonstrates that the scFv<br>
were not coupled through inter-molecular disulfide bond formation. Since no difference was<br>
observed between samples analyzed on reducing and non-reducing SDS PAGE gels, the<br>
presence of the bifunctional linker did not facilitate inter-molecular disulfide bond formation.<br>
[581]	Dime?' purification: The dimerization reaction mixture was purified using<br>
strong cation exchange column (SP-5PW, 20 micron). Buffer A: 20 mM NaOAc, pH 4.0; buffer B: 20 mM NaOAc, 1 M NaCl, pH 4.0. scFv dimer eluted at 40% B. SDS PAGE analysis (Figure 15) of the purified dimer showed that, after one column purification, the purity of the dimer was approximately 90%.<br>
[582]	An example of a hetero-bifunctional ABP of the present invention is shown in<br>
Figure 9. Based on the known crystal structure determined for two different antibody molecules (for example Herceptin and Omnitarg) that bind to different epitopes of the same antigen (for example ErbB2), specific ammo acid positions are identified such that they fit within a certain desired selection criteria. Desired selection criteria for amino acid position in this example include the relative proximity of one or more specific amino acid positions on each molecule. Such amino acid positions may be desired to form the hetero-bifunctional molecule shown in Figure 9 using a linker molecule. Specific amino acid positions on each molecule that fit the criteria are shown in Table 10 below, as is a linker molecule that may be used to form a hetero-bifunctional ABP. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the list is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative, and that all amino acid positions that fit a certain desired selection criteria are contemplated to be suitable for use in the present invention. A non-natural amino acid of the present invention may be substituted at one or more of these positions in each molecule to provide the chemical functional groups utilized for linker attachment. A wide variety of other selection criteria may also be utilized to identify amino acid positions to fit the desired criteria, including but not limited to, proximity between the same or different molecules, conformation change modulation,<br><br>
distance modulation between ABP's or molecules linked to an ABP, linker length or shape, surface exposure, modulation of ligand binding characteristics, modulation of receptor dimerization, etc.<br><br>
[583]	Based on the interaction of HTV-1 neutralizing human Fab 4E10 with HIV<br>
gp41 env protein, specific amino acid positions are identified such that they fit within a certain desired selection criteria. Desired selection criteria for amino acid position in this example include residues that would be used for conjugation of T-20 peptide to the Fab such that the binding of T-20 to gp41 occurs without a negative effect to the binding and recognition of the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of 4E10 to gp41. T-20, also known as DP-178, inhibits entry of HIV into cells by acting as a viral fusion inhibitor. Figure 12 shows HTV neutralizing human Fab 4E10 with a mimic g41 peptide. Potential residues for attachment of T-20 peptide are shown. Potential residues for incorporation of non-naturally encoded amino acids include, but are not limited to, G!n64~heavy chain of the Fab; Glul — light chain of the Fab, and Gln27—light chain of the Fab. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the list is by no means exhaustive and is merely illustrative, and that all amino acid positions that fit a certain desired selection criteria are contemplated to be suitable for use in the present invention. A wide variety of other selection criteria may also be utilized to identify amino acid positions to fit the desired criteria, including but not limited to, proximity between the same or different molecules, conformation change modulation, distance modulation between ABP's or molecules linked to an ABP, inclusion of a linker,<br><br>
linker length or shape, surface exposure, modulation of ligand binding characteristics,<br>
modulation of receptor dimerization, etc.<br>

The purified ABP containing p-acetylphenylalanine dissolved at 10 mg/mL in 25 mM MES (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO) pH 6.0, 25 mM Hepes (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO) pH 7.0, or in 10 mM Sodium Acetate (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) pH 4.5, is reacted with a 10 to 100-fold excess of aminooxy-containing PEG, and then stirred for 10 - 16 hours at room temperature (Jencks, W. 1 Am. Chem. Soc. 1959, 81, pp 475). The PEG-ABP is then diluted into appropriate buffer for immediate purification and analysis.<br>

where R = methyl, n=2 and N = 10,000 MW and X is a carbonyl (C=O) group. The purified ABP containing p-acetylphenylalanine is dissolved at between 0.1-10 mg/mL in 25 roM MES (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) pH 6.0, 25 mM Hepes (Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO) pH 7.0, or in 10 mM Sodium Acetate (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) pH 4.5, is reacted with a 1 to 100-fold excess of hydrazide-containing PEG, and the corresponding hydrazone is reduced in situ by addition of stock 1M NaCNBH3 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO), dissolved in H2O, to a final concentration of 10-50 mM. Reactions are carried out in the dark at 4 °C to RT for 18-24 hours. Reactions are stopped by addition of 1 M Tris (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) at about pH 7.6 to a final Tris concentration of 50 mM or diluted into appropriate buffer for immediate purification.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

coupled to another ABP variant comprising the azido-containing amino acid, each of which<br>
comprise non-naturally encoded amino acid substitutions at the sites described in, but not<br>
limited to, Example 10. This will generate the corresponding ABP homodimer where the two<br>
ABP variants are physically joined.  In an analogous manner an antigen-binding polypeptide<br>
may be coupled to one or more other polypeptides to form heterodimers, homomultimers, or<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 22<br>
mPEG-OMs + HOCLi -&gt; mPEG-O-CH2-CH2-C-C-H<br>
[626]	To a solution of lithium acetylide (4 equiv.), prepared as known in the art and<br>
cooled to -78°C in THF, is added dropwise a solution of mPEG-OMs dissolved in THF with vigorous stirring. After 3 hours, the reaction is permitted to warm to room temperature and quenched with the addition of 1 mL of butanol. 20 mL of H2O is then added and the mixture was stirred for an additional 45 minutes at room temperature. The pH was adjusted to 3 with 0.5 N H2SO4 and NaCl was added to a concentration of approximately 15 wt%. The reaction mixture was extracted with CH2CI2 (100 mL x 3), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. After precipitation with cold diethyl ether, the product was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to yield the l-(but-3-ynyloxy)-methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG). Example 23<br>
[627]	The azide- and acetylene-containing amino acids were incorporated site-<br>
selectively into proteins using the methods described in L. Wang, et al., (2001), Science<br>
292:498-500, J.W. Chin et al., Science 301:964-7 (2003)), J. W. Chin et al., (2002), Journal<br>

amino acids were incorporated, the cycloaddition reaction was carried out with 0.01 mM<br>
protein in phosphate buffer (PB), pH 8, in the presence of 2 mM PEG derivative, 1 mM<br>
C11SO4, and -Img Cu-wire for 4 hours at 37 °C.<br>
Example 24<br>
[628]	This example describes methods to measure in vitro and in vivo activity of<br>
ABP comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid and PEGylated ABP. Cell Binding Assays<br>
[629]	Cells (3X106) are incubated in duplicate in PBS/1% BSA (100 /xl) in the<br>
absence or presence of various concentrations (volume: 10 μl) of unlabeled ABP, ABP or a negative control and in the presence of1251- ABP (approx. 100,000 cpm or 1 ng) at 0°C for 90 minutes (total volume: 120 /xl). Cells are then resuspended and layered over 200 μl ice cold FCS in a 350 μl plastic centrifuge tube and centrifuged (1000 g; 1 minute). The pellet is<br><br>
collected by cutting off the end of the tube and pellet and supernatant counted separately in a gamma counter (Packard).<br>
[630]	Specific binding (cpm) is determined as total binding in the absence of a<br>
competitor (mean of duplicates) minus binding (cpm) in the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled ABP (non-specific binding). The non-specific binding is measured for each of the cell types used. Experiments are run on separate days using the same preparation of 125I-ABP and should display internal consistency. The binding is inhibited in a dose dependent manner by unlabeled natural ABP or ABP, but not by the negative control. The ability of ABP to compete for the binding of natural I-ABP suggests that the receptors recognize both forms equally well.<br>
[631]	For binding assays with scFv-108, A431  cells were collected following<br>
treatment with trypsin, re-suspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 2% FBS, 0.01% NaN3), and then seeded into 96-well round bottom microtiter plates (3 X 105 cell/well). Cells were incubated with different concentrations of wild type or pAcF-containing scFv-108 fragments for 30 minutes on ice. Unbound scFv proteins were removed by washing following centrifugation (repeated 2-3 times). Cells were then incubated with the mAb-108 (ATCC # HB 9764) at a concentration of 7.5 nM (ECso) for 30 minutes. After two washes, the cells were incubated with an APC-labeled (allophycocyaniii) anti-mouse antibody (10 ug/ml) for 30 minutes on ice. After washing the cells two times to remove the secondary antibody, the cells were re-suspended in FACS buffer supplemented with propidium iodine (0.5 ug/ml), and analyzed by flow cytometry. For binding assays with Fab-108, cells were incubated with increasing amounts of Fab-108 under the same conditions as used for the scFv-108 assays. Fab binding was detected using an anti-His antibody followed by an APC-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody.<br>
[632]	Figure 7, Panels A-C shows competition binding curves of the scFv proteins<br>
containing p-acetyl-phenylalanine (pAcF) or pAcF with PEG and WT scFv to A431 cells expressing EGF receptors. Cells were incubated with the scFv proteins at various concentrations after washing to remove unbound scFv's, and the cells were treated with the mAbl08 as described above. All proteins were expressed in the periplasm. Table 11 summarizes the binding of the modified scFv's (pAcF and pAcF with PEG) relative to the wild type scFv:<br><br><br><br>
[633]	Figure 89 Panels B-D show binding of pAcF or pAcF-PEG-containing Fab-108<br>
fragments and WT Fab to A431 cells expressing EGF receptors. PEGylation of the Fab fragments results in a minimal decrease in the affinity of the fragments to the EGF receptors. Binding of modified Fab fragments relative to that of the wild type Fab is shown in Table 12. Binding conditions were as described previously.<br><br>
In Vivo Studies of PEGvlated ABP<br>
[634]	PEG- ABP, unmodified ABP and buffer solution are administered to mice or<br>
rats. The results will show superior activity and prolonged half life of the PEGylated ABP of the present invention compared to unmodified ABP.<br>
Measurement of the in vivo Half-life of Conjugated and Non-coniugated ABP and Variants Thereof.<br>
[635]	Male Sprague Dawley rats (about 7 weeks old) are used.   On the day of<br>
administration, the weight of each animal is measured. 100 fig per kg body weight of the non-conjugated and conjugated ABP samples are each injected intravenously into the tail vein of three rats. At 1 minute, 30 minutes, 1, 2,4, 6, and 24 hours after the injection, 500 /d of blood is withdrawn from each rat while under CO2 -anesthesia. The blood samples are stored at room temperature for 1.5 hours followed by isolation of serum by centrifugation (4° C, 18000xg for 5 minutes). The serum samples are stored at -80° C until the day of analysis.<br><br>
The amount of active ABP in the serum samples is quantified by the ABP in vitro activity assay after thawing the samples on ice. Example 31<br>
[636]	Human Clinical Trial of the  Safety and/or Efficacy of PEGylated ABP<br>
Comprising a Non-Naturally Encoded Amino Acid.<br>
[637]	Objective    To compare the safety and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously<br>
administered PEGylated recombinant human ABP comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid with a commercially available product specific for the same target antigen (e.g. Herceptin®, Bexxar®, Campath®, CEA-Scan®, Enbrel®, Erbitux®, Humira®, Myoscint®, Prostascint®, Raptiva®, Remicade®, ReoPro®, Rituxan®, Simulect®, Synagis®, Verluma®, Xolair®, Zenapax®, Zevalin®, or Avastin®.<br>
[638]	Patients   Eighteen healthy volunteers ranging between 20-40 years of age and<br>
weighing between 60-90 kg are enrolled in the study. The subjects will have no clinically significant abnormal laboratory values for hematology or serum chemistry, and a negative urine toxicology screen, HTV screen, and hepatitis B surface antigen. They should not have any evidence of the following: hypertension; a history of any primary hematologic disease; history of significant hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, metabolic, neurologic disease; a history of anemia or seizure disorder, a known sensitivity to bacterial or mammalian-derived products, PEG, or human serum albumin; habitual and heavy consumer to beverages containing caffeine; participation in any other clinical trial or had blood transfused or donated within 30 days of study entry, had exposure to ABP within three months of study entry, had an illness within seven days of study entry; and have significant abnormalities on the pre-study physical examination or the clinical laboratory evaluations within 14 days of study entry. All subjects are evaluable for safety and all blood collections for pharmacokinetic analysis are collected as scheduled. All studies are performed with institutional ethics committee approval and patient consent.<br>
[639]	Study Design   This will be a Phase I, single-center, open-label, randomized,<br>
two-period crossover study in healthy male volunteers. Eighteen subjects are randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequence groups (nine subjects/group). ABP is administered over two separate dosing periods as a bolus s.c. injection in the upper thigh using equivalent doses of the PEGylated ABP comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid and the<br><br>
commercially available product chosen. The dose and frequency of administration of the commercially available product is as instructed in the package label. Additional dosing, dosing frequency, or other parameter as desired, using the commercially available products may be added to the study by including additional groups of subjects. Each dosing period is separated by a 14-day washout period. Subjects are confined to the study center at least 12 hours prior to and 72 hours following dosing for each of the two dosing periods, but not between dosing periods. Additional groups of subjects may be added if there are to be additional dosing, frequency, or other parameter, to be tested for the PEGylated ABP as well. The experimental formulation of ABP is the PEGylated ABP comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid.<br>
[640]	Blood Sampling   Serial blood is drawn by direct vein puncture before and<br>
after administration of ABP. Venous blood samples (5 mL) for determination of serum ABP concentrations are obtained at about 30, 20, and 10 minutes prior to dosing (3 baseline samples) and at approximately the following times after dosing: 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 5, 8, 12,15, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours. Each serum sample is divided into two aliquots. All serum samples are stored at -20°C. Serum samples are shipped on dry ice. Fasting clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) are performed immediately prior to the initial dose on day 1, the morning of day 4, immediately prior to dosing on day 16, and the morning of day 19.<br>
[641]	Bioanalvtical Methods A radioimmunoassay (RA) or ELISA kit procedure is<br>
used for the determination of serum ABP concentrations.<br>
[642]	Safety Determinations   Vital signs are recorded immediately prior to each<br>
dosing (Days 1 and 16), and at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after each dosing. Safety determinations are based on the incidence and type of adverse events and the changes in clinical laboratory tests from baseline. In addition, changes from pre-study in vital sign measurements, including blood pressure, and physical examination results are evaluated.<br>
[643]	Data Analysis   Post-dose serum concentration values are corrected for pre-<br>
dose baselme ABP concentrations by subtracting from each of the post-dose values the mean baseline ABP concentration determined from averaging the ABP levels from the three samples collected at 30, 20, and 10 minutes before dosing. Pre-dose serum ABP concentrations are not included in the calculation of the mean value if they are below the<br><br>
quantification level of the assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined from serum concentration data corrected for baseline ABP concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated by model independent methods on a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX 8600 computer system using the latest version of the BIOAVL software. The following pharmacokinetics parameters are determined: peak serum concentration (Cmax); time to peak serum concentration (tmax); area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last blood sampling time (AUC0-72) calculated with the use of the linear trapezoidal rule; and terminal elimination half-life (tyz), computed from the elimination rate constant. The elimination rate constant is estimated by linear regression of consecutive data points in the terminal linear region of the log-linear concentration-time plot. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) of the pharmacokinetic parameters are calculated for each treatment. The ratio of the parameter means (preserved formulation/non-preserved formulation) is calculated.<br>
[644]	Safety Results  The incidence of adverse events is equally distributed across<br>
the treatment groups. There are no clinically significant changes from baseline or pre-study clinical laboratory tests or blood pressures, and no notable changes from pre-study in physical examination results and vital sign measurements. The safety profiles for the two treatment groups should appear similar.<br>
[645]	Pharmacokinetic Results     Mean serum ABP  concentration-time profiles<br>
(uncorrected for baseline ABP levels) in all 18 subjects after receiving a single dose of one or more of commercially available products specific for the same target antigen are compared to the PEGylated ABP comprising a non-naturally encoded anrino acid at each time point measured. All subjects should have pre-dose baseline ABP concentrations within the normal physiologic range. Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined from serum data corrected for pre-dose mean baseline ABP concentrations and the Cmax and tmax are determined. The mean tmax for the clinical comparators) chosen is significantly shorter than the tmax for the PEGylated ABP comprising the non-naturally encoded amino acid. Terminal half-life values are significantly shorter for the commerically available ABP products tested compared with the terminal half-life for the PEGylated ABP comprising a non-naturally encoded amino acid.<br>
[646]	Although the present study is conducted in healthy male subjects, similar<br>
absorption   characteristics   and   safety  profiles   would   be   anticipated   in   other   patient<br><br>
populations; such as male or female patients with cancer or chronic renal failure, pediatric renal failure patients, patients in autologous predeposit programs, or patients scheduled for elective surgery.<br>
[647]	In conclusion, subcutaneously administered single doses of PEGylated ABP<br>
comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid will be safe and well tolerated by healthy male subjects. Based on a comparative incidence of adverse events, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examination results, the safety profiles of the commercially available forms of ABP and PEGylated ABP comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid will be equivalent. The PEGylated ABP comprising non-naturally encoded amino acid potentially provides large clinical utility to patients and health care providers.<br>
