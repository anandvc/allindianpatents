				<td>A condenser microphone employing a wide band stop filter for<br>
wideband signals of low frequency and radio frequency<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a condenser microphone employing a wide<br>
band stop filter for wideband signals of low frequency and radio frequency, and more<br>
particularly to a condenser microphone capable of not only suppressing<br>
electromagnetic (EM) noise but also improving resistance to electrostatic discharge<br>
(ESD) applied from outside.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In general, microphones are classified as follows, according to methods<br>
converting mechanical vibration into an electrical signal: carbon microphones using<br>
electrical resistance characteristics of carbon particles; crystal microphones using the<br>
piezoelectric effect of Rochelle Salt; moving coil microphones generating induced<br>
current by vibrating a diaphragm, in which a coil of wire is attached, in a magnetic<br>
field; velocity microphones using induced current generated when a metal film<br>
installed in a magnetic field receives sound waves and is vibrated; and condenser<br>
microphones using capacitance varied according to vibration of a diaphragm caused<br>
by sound waves.<br>
Herein, the condenser microphone is universally used as a small microphone,<br>
but has a problem in that a DC power supply is necessarily required to apply a voltage<br>
to a condenser. Lately, to solve such a problem, an electret condenser microphone<br>
using electret, which has semi-permanent charge, is used, which has advantages in<br>
that a structure of a pre-amplifier is simplified because a bias power supply is not<br>
needed and also its performance can be improved at a low cost.<br>
Meanwhile, a transmission section of a mobile terminal radiates a radio<br>
frequency signal of a large instantaneous power, which is range of a few mW to a few<br>
W, through an antenna. The radio frequency signal is induced into a line between a<br>
microphone and an external sound pressure signal process circuit and then is applied<br><br>
to a junction field-effect transistor (hereinafter, referred to as "JFET'). which is a<br>
field-effect transistor (hereinafter, referred to as "FET"), installed in the inside or<br>
outside of the microphone.<br>
At this time, if a power of the radio frequency signal applied to the JFET is<br>
larger than a predetermined level, the JFET is nonlinearly operated, so as to generate<br>
noise component relative to a peak envelope together with a harmonic wave. Since<br>
the frequency band of the peak envelope overlaps with a sound pressure signal of<br>
audio frequency in general, the signal of the noise component is amplified with the<br>
sound pressure signal and is inputted to the sound pressure signal process circuit,<br>
thereby forming the largest noise of the microphone.<br>
Therefore, in order to remove such a noise, a microphone used in a mobile<br>
terminal, in the case of a single mode, comprises a notch filter using a LC resonator<br>
realized by one chip capacitor in the inside, so that radio frequency signals of a<br>
predetermined frequency range are blocked.<br>
Meanwhile, a conventional microphone 1 used in a dual-mode mobile<br>
terminal, as shown in FIG. 1, comprises a filter 14 generating resonance at two<br>
frequency bands in using two chip capacitors C1 and C2. That is, terminals for<br>
mobile communications, which are widely used today, can be classified into Mobile<br>
Subscriber Radio Telephones of 900MHz band and Personal Communication Systems<br>
(PCNs) of 1800MHz band. Therefore, the dual-mode terminal must have a function<br>
capable of blocking radio frequency signals of both 900MHz band and 1800MHz<br>
band.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an acoustic module is equivalently represented as a<br>
variable capacitor CECM and is connected to the gate G of a FET 12 realized by a<br>
JFET. A filter 14 realized by a first and a second capacitor C1 and C2 is connected<br>
in parallel between the drain D and the source S of the FET 12. Herein, the first<br>
capacitor C1 has a capacitance of about 10pF and functions to remove 1800MHz<br>
frequency components, and the second capacitor C2 has a capacitance of about 33pF<br>
and functions to remove 900MHz frequency components.<br>
In the case of using such a microphone in a mobile terminal, the output of the<br><br>
FET 12 is transmitted to a sound pressure signal process circuit 16 after passing the<br>
filter 14 designed with parallel connected capacitors C1 and C2, and the output of the<br>
sound pressure signal process circuit 16 passes a radio-frequency/intermediate-<br>
frequency circuit (RF/IF circuit) 18 and is radiated to the air through an antenna.<br>
Herein, the parallel connected capacitors C1 and C2 are designed with a chip capacitor <br>
C1 and C2, and each of the capacitors C1 and C2 forms a LC resonance circuit<br>
together with respective parasitic inductance L existed in the inside, thereby<br>
functioning as a notch filter.<br>
FIG. 2 is a graph showing transfer characteristic of each filter in several cases<br>
in which the filter shown in FIG. 1 is realized by one capacitor or two capacitors.<br>
In the graph shown in FIG. 2, the horizontal axis represents frequencies in<br>
GHz, the vertical axis represents attenuation levels. A dotted line gl represents a<br>
transfer characteristic in a case of having only the second capacitor C2 of 33pF and<br>
shows a rapid attenuation of a signal at about 900MHz band, and a solid line g2<br>
represents a transfer characteristic in a case of having only the first capacitor C1 of<br>
10pF and shows a rapid attenuation of a signal at about 1800MHz band. Also, a<br>
dashed-dot line g3 represents a transfer characteristic in a case of having the first and<br>
the second capacitor C1 and C2 connected parallel with each other, and shows a great<br>
attenuation of a signal at about 900MHz band and about 2.2GHz.<br>
However, such a conventional multi-band low-noise microphone has not only<br>
a problem in that only a little variation of the distance between two capacitors effects<br>
the resonance filter's center of 1800MHz to be moved but also another problem in that<br>
it is impossible effectively to remove or block noise in a super-radio frequency mode.<br>
That is, in a case of using a new mode such as a new frequency band for IMT-2000<br>
service (for example, 2000MHz band or 2400MHz band), since having a narrowband<br>
blocking characteristic limited within a predetermined frequency band, a conventional<br>
circuit can attenuate only electromagnetic noise within a predetermined frequency<br>
band but cannot attenuate radio frequency (RF) noise and electromagnetic noise<br>
generated within other frequency bands with the exception of a predetermined<br>
frequency band. Such a problem is also generated in a mode below 1800MHz<br><br>
frequency band.<br>
Further, in order to improve reliability of a mobile terminal, each element of<br>
the terminal is required to have a strong resistance to electrostatic discharge.<br>
However, the conventional microphone is problematic in that the conventional<br>
microphone is easily affected by electrostatic discharge applied from outside. In<br>
other words, the mobile terminal must have no damaged internal circuit clement at all.<br>
either after it experiences electrostatic discharge in the air with a voltage of 15 kV<br>
applied thereto in a state where its microphone is grounded, or after it experiences<br>
electrostatic discharge with a voltage of 8 kV applied thereto in a state where it is in<br>
direct contact with a node for the electrostatic discharge. However, the conventional<br>
microphones cannot satisfy the above-mentioned requirement with respect to the ESD<br>
applied from outside.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above-<br>
mentioned problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
condenser microphone comprising a wide band stop filter capable of efficiently<br>
blocking a wide band signal including low frequency and radio frequency used in a<br>
mobile communication, thereby being able to be used for a multi-band.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a condenser microphone<br>
having widened removal range of electromagnetic noise, improved blocking level of<br>
filtering, and improved resistance to electrostatic discharge applied from outside.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a condenser<br>
microphone decreasing noise by blocking radio frequency interference for a mobile<br>
terminal, comprising: an acoustic module for converting sound pressure into<br>
variation of an electric signal; an amplification means for amplifying the electric<br>
signal inputted from the acoustic module; and an EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking<br>
section for blocking a wide band signal including low frequency and radio frequency<br>
outputted from the amplification means and for blocking electromagnetic-wave/radio-<br>
frequency noises and electrostatic discharge entered from outside.<br><br>
The amplification means is an FET, and the EM-noise-filtering/ESD-<br>
blocking section includes capacitors and resistors connected selectively between the<br>
gate G and the source S of the FET and/or between the drain D and the source S of the<br>
FET according to frequency band.<br>
In addition, the capacitor can be changed in a range of lpF to 100µF<br>
according to frequency band, and the resistor can be changed in a range of 100 to<br>
1GΩ according to frequency band. The resistor can be replaced by a magnetic<br>
induction element such as an inductor, and also the value of the resistors connected<br>
serially or parallel can be changed selectively according to frequency band. These will<br>
be identically applied to each embodiment in the following description.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
First, a condenser microphone according to the present invention comprises:<br>
an acoustic module having a capacitance varying according to an acoustic signal<br>
inputted thereto; a FET for converting and amplifying varied capacitance of the-<br>
acoustic module into an electric signal; and an EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking<br>
section, which is connected to the output ports of the FET, for removing<br>
electromagnetic noise (EM noise) and for providing a function to block electrostatic<br>
discharge. For easy comprehension, according to the numbers of resistors and<br>
capacitors realizing the EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking section, embodiments will<br>
be classified and described as follows.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
FIG. 3 is a circuit showing a microphone having<br>
an EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking section realized by one capacitor C1 1 and one<br>
resistor R11 according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, an acoustic module 36, which has a capacitance varying<br>
according to an acoustic signal inputted thereto, is equivalently represented as a<br>
variable capacitor CECM and is connected to the gate G of a FET 30. Also, an EM-<br>
noise-filtering/ESD-blocking section 32 for removing electromagnetic noise and<br>
blocking electrostatic discharge is connected in parallel between the source S and the<br><br>
drain D of the FET 30. According to a first embodiment, the EM-noise-<br>
filtering/ESD-blocking section 32 consists of a resistor Rl 1 and a capacitor C1 1, in<br>
which the resistor Rl 1 is connected serially to the drain D of the FET 30 in such a<br>
manner that one end of the resistor Rl 1 is connected to the drain D of the FET 30, and<br>
the capacitor C1 1 is connected between the other end of the resistor R11 and source S<br>
ofthe FET 30.<br>
With this construction, sound pressure of a user vibrates a diaphragm (not<br>
shown) to vary the capacitance of the variable capacitor CHCM. and such capacitance<br>
variation induces voltage variation at the gate G of the FET 30.<br>
The FET 30 includes a JFET, which has a gate G connected to the variable<br>
capacitor CECM, a source S connected to a common ground, and a drain D connected<br>
to the EM-noise-filtcring/ESD-blocking section 32, or an amplifier of a built-in-gain<br>
microphone, thereby amplifying an input signal. Such FETs 30 have a very high input<br>
impedance and a very low output impedance, so that it functions as an impedance<br>
transformer matching impedance of the acoustic module and circuit part.<br>
The output of the FET 30 is outputted to output ports 34a and 34b after<br>
passing the EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking section 32. Flere, the EM-noise-<br>
filtering/ESD-blocking section 32 functions as a wide band stop filter blocking high-<br>
frequency radio signals or EM noise which enters through the output ports 34a and<br>
34b for connecting the microphone to an external device, while functioning to block<br>
electrostatic discharge which is applied from outside. That is, high pressure of<br>
electrostatic discharge applied through the output ports 34a and 34b from outside is<br>
discharged to ground through the capacitor C11 of large capacitance, and the resistor<br>
R11 prevents the electrostatic discharge from being directly applied to the inside<br>
circuit section. To achieve such a result, the capacitor CM must have a large<br>
capacitance, enough to store current caused by the high pressure of electrostatic<br>
discharge, that is, the capacitor C11 must be at least 1 nF.<br>
With the first embodiment, it is possible that the capacitance of the capacitor<br>
C11 is changed selectively from InF to 100µF according to conditions. For example,<br>
the capacitor C1 1 may have a capacitance selected from the group consisting of InF.<br><br>
I.5nF, 2.2nF, 3.3nF, 4.7nF, 6.8nF, 10nF, 15nF, 22nF, 33nF, 47nF, 68nF and 100nF.<br>
and the resistor R11 may have a resistance selected from the group consisting of<br>
100Ω, 220Ω, 330ft, 430Ω, 620Ω, 680Ω, 820Ω and 1KΩt.<br>
In a condenser microphone having a circuit as constructed according to the<br>
first embodiment described above, electromagnetic noise over a wide frequency band<br>
including low frequency and radio frequency can be blocked. Further, a condenser<br>
microphone according to the first embodiment has an improved blocking capability<br>
(resistance) enough to stand against electrostatic discharge of even above 8KV applied<br>
from outside when the microphone is grounded and high pressure of electrostatic<br>
discharge is applied directly to the output ports.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
FIGs. 4A to 4D are circuits each of which shows a microphone having one of<br>
various EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking sections 32 selectively including two<br>
capacitors C21 and C22 and one resistor R21 according to a second embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking section 32 according to<br>
the second embodiment forms a shape of a character 'IT or a shape of a character<br>
'inverted IT by connecting a resistor R21 between two capacitors C21 and C22 faced<br>
to each other, in which the a shape of a character 'inverted IT means a shape formed<br>
by inverting top and bottom of a shape of a character 'IT. Also, a noise-blocking<br>
resistor R22 for blocking electromagnetic noise inputted to the FET 30 is selectively<br>
added between the gate G of the FET 30 and the acoustic module 36.<br>
According to the second embodiment, FIG. 4A is a circuit showing a case in<br>
which the EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking section 32 has a shape of a character 'IT<br>
and a noise-blocking resistor for preventing electromagnetic noise from being inputted<br>
to the FET 30 is not between the gate G of the FET 30 and the acoustic module 36.<br>
FIG. 4B is another circuit showing another case in which the EM-noise-filtering/ESD-<br>
blocking section 32 has a shape of a character 'IT and a noise-blocking resistor R22<br>
for blocking electromagnetic noise inputted to the FET 30 is connected between the<br>
gate G of the FET 30 and the acoustic module 36.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 4A and 4B, A condenser microphone in accordance with<br>
the second embodiment of the present invention comprises: an acoustic module 36<br>
having a capacitance varying according to an acoustic signal inputted thereto; a FET<br>
30 for converting and amplifying varied capacitance of the acoustic module into an<br>
electric signal; and an EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking section 32, which is<br>
connected to the drain D of the FET 30, for removing electromagnetic noise (EM<br>
noise) and for providing a function to block electrostatic discharge.<br>
The acoustic module 36 is equivalently represented as a variable capacitor<br>
CECM and is connected to the gate G of the FET 30. Also, an F.M-noise-<br>
filtering/ESD-blocking section 32 for removing electromagnetic noise and blocking<br>
electrostatic discharge is connected in parallel between the source S and the drain D of<br>
the FET 30.<br>
The FET 30 includes a JFET, which has a gate G connected to the variable<br>
capacitor CECM, a source S connected to a common ground, and a drain D connected<br>
to the EM-noisc-filtering/ESD-blocking section 32. or an amplifier of a built-in-gain<br>
microphone, thereby amplifying an input signal. Such FETs 30 have a very high<br>
input impedance and a very low output impedance, so that it functions as an<br>
impedance transformer matching impedance of the acoustic module and circuit part.<br>
The EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking section 32 shown in FIG. 4A and 4B<br>
according to the second embodiment is realized by a first capacitor C21 connected<br>
between the drain D and the source S of the FET 30, a second capacitor C22<br>
connected parallel to the first capacitor C21, and a first resistor R21 connected serially<br>
to between an upper signal-line end of the first capacitor C21 and an upper signal-line<br>
end of the second capacitor C22, thereby forming a shape of a character TE.<br>
With this construction of such a second embodiment, the acoustic module 36<br>
and the FET 30 are operated identical to those in the first embodiment, therefore a<br>
detailed description of the acoustic module 36 and the FET 30 will be omitted so as to<br>
avoid repeated description and the following description will be laid out centering<br>
around the EM-noise-filtering/ESD-blocking section 32 according to the second<br>
embodiment.<br><br>
In the second embodiment, a filtering operation of the EM-noise-<br>
filtcring/ESD-b10cking section 32 is performed by the first capacitor C21 and the<br>
second capacitor C22, thereby b10cking high-frequency noise or electromagnetic noise<br>
which is inputted from outside through the output ports 34a and 34b. Also, the first<br>
resistor R21 performs not only a decoupling function separating the first capacitor<br>
C21 and the second capacitor C22 but also an electrostatic-discharge b10cking<br>
function preventing the electrostatic discharge from being directly applied to the<br>
inside circuit. The second capacitor C22 bypasses electrostatic discharge voltage<br>
applied through the output ports 34a and 34b to ground, thereby preventing the inside<br>
elements from being damaged by the electrostatic discharge. To achieve such a<br>
result, the second capacitor C22 must have a large capacitance, enough to store-<br>
current caused by the high pressure of electrostatic discharge, that is, the second<br>
capacitor C22 must be at least InF.<br>
Meanwhile, in FIG. 4B, the second resistor R22 connected serially between<br>
the acoustic module 36 and the gate G of the FET is a noise-b10cking resistor for<br>
preventing electromagnetic noise from being inputted to the FET 30.<br>
With the second embodiment, it is possible that the capacitance of the first<br>
capacitor C21 and the second capacitor C22 are changed selectively between 10pF<br>
and 100µF according to conditions. For example, the first capacitor C21 may be<br>
10pF or 33pF, while the second capacitor C22 may be a capacitance selected from the<br>
group consisting of InF, 1.5nF, 2.2nF, 3.3nF, 4.7nF, 6.8nF, 10nF, 15nF. 22nF, 33nF,<br>
47nF, 68nF and 100nF. Also, it is preferred that the first resistor R21 has a resistance<br>
selected from the group consisting of 100ft, 220ft, 330ft, 430ft, 620ft. 680ft, 820ft<br>
and IKft, and it is preferred that the second resistor R22 has a resistance selected<br>
from the group consisting of 100Ω, 1KΩ, 10KΩ, 100KΩ, and 1MΩt.<br>
In a condenser microphone having a circuit as constructed according to the<br>
second embodiment described above, electromagnetic noise over a wide frequency<br>
band including 10w frequency and radio frequency can be b10cked. Further, a<br>
condenser microphone according to the first embodiment has an improved b10cking<br>
capability (resistance) enough to stand against electrostatic discharge of even above<br><br>
8KV applied from outside when the microphone is grounded and high pressure of<br>
electrostatic discharge is applied directly to the output ports.<br>
According to the second embodiment, FIG. 4C is still another circuit showing<br>
a case in which an EM-noise-filtering section 32 has a shape of a character "inverted<br>
IT and a noise-b10cking resistor for preventing electromagnetic noise from being<br>
inputted to the FET 30 is not between the gate G of the FET 30 and the acoustic<br>

avoid repeated description and the fol10wing description will be laid out centering<br>

performs a decoupling function separating the first capacitor C21 and the second<br>

by a wide band stop filter having a large capacitance efficiently capable of b10cking a<br>
wide band signal including 10w frequency and radio frequency, that is. the second<br>
capacitor C22 must be at least 1 nF.<br><br>
Meanwhile, in FIG. 4D. a second resistor R22 connected serially between the<br>
acoustic module 36 and the gate G of the FET is a noise-b10cking resistor for<br>

FIG. 4E is a graph showing a result of comparing RF noise characteristics of<br>
a conventional commercially-used condenser microphone and a condenser<br>
microphone according to the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4E, (a) is a graph showing a filtering characteristic of a<br>
conventional microphone, and (b) is a graph showing a filtering characteristic of a<br>
microphone according to the second embodiment of the present invention. In the<br>
shown graphs, each horizontal axis represents frequency with a unit of MHz, and each<br>
vertical axis represents attenuation level with a unit of dB. in which a larger negative<br>
(-) value means a higher attenuation level.<br><br>
In a direct RF injection method for a commercially-used condenser<br>
microphone in a frequency range from 0.125MHz to 3.0GHz, RF noise characteristic<br>
(a) of the microphone module shows a RF noise level attenuation of -40dB generally<br>
at 900MHz (GSM) and 1.8MHz (DCS). However, the RF noise characteristic shows<br>
an RF noise level attenuation much smaller than -40dB in other frequency ranges. A<br>
vertical axis expressed on a measuring apparatus used in the above test has a<br>
minimum value of -40dB, thereby al10wing all values 10wer than -40dB to be<br>
expressed only as -40dB.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of applying a direct RF injection method to a<br>
condenser microphone according to the second embodiment of the present invention<br>
over frequency range from 0.125MHz to 3.0GHz, RF noise characteristic (b) of the<br>
microphone module shows an RF noise attenuation level of -40dB, which is the<br>
minimum value of an available measurement range, over all of the frequency band.<br>
That is, the microphone according to the second embodiment shows a result that its<br>
RF noise level is improved to maximum 45dB or more as compared to that of the<br>
commercially-used electret condenser microphone.<br>
This shows that the condenser microphone according to the present invention<br>
functions as an excellent EMI filter.<br>

applied to the inside circuit. The second capacitor C32 bypasses electrostatic<br>
discharge voltage applied through the output ports 34a and 34b to ground, thereby<br>
preventing the inside elements from being damaged by the electrostatic discharge.<br>
To achieve such a result, the second capacitor C32 must have a large capacitance,<br>
enough to store current caused by the high pressure of electrostatic discharge, that is,<br>

preventing electromagnetic noise from being inputted to the FET 30.<br>
The capacitance of the first capacitor C31 and the second capacitor C32 can<br>
be changed selectively from 10pF to 100µF according to conditions. For example,<br>
the first capacitor C31 may be 10pF or 33pF, while the second capacitor C32 may<br>
have a capacitance selected from the group consisting of InF, 1.5nF, 2.2nF, 3.3nF.<br>

Embodiment 6<br>
Meanwhile, the first to the fifth embodiments described above can be applied<br>
to a variety of circuits for removing noise caused in a frequency band of 1.8GUz or<br>
more including a next-generation mobile communication system (1MT2000). That is,<br>
a circuit for removing noise caused in the frequency band of I.8GHz or more has the<br>
same construction as the circuit described above for removing noise corresponding to<br>
the frequency band of 900MHz and 1.8GHz, and has only a different feature in that<br>
capacitors C1 and C2 for performing a filtering function are realized by capacitors<br>
having a capacitance between lpF and 100µF. The capacitors having a capacitance<br>
between IpF and 100µF can filter electromagnetic noise of 5KHz to 6GFIz.<br><br>
For example, in a case of applying the EM-noise-filtering/ESD-b10cking<br>
section 32 using three capacitors and one resistor as shown in FIG. 7A to a circuit for<br>
removing noise of 1.8GFIz or more, the first to the third capacitors C41, C42, and C43<br>
for performing a filtering function can be selected to have a capacitance between 1pF<br>

to have a capacitance between 1pF and 5pF according to conditions, and preferably<br>
4.7pF, the second capacitor C42 is selected to have a capacitance between 5pF and<br>

first resistor R51 has a resistance selected from the group consisting of 100Ω, 220Ω,<br>
330Ω, 430Ω, 620Ω, 680Ω, 820Ω and 1KΩ..<br>
In the example described above, the capacitors C41, C42, and C43 and the<br>
resistor R51 form a wide band stop filter, while functioning to improve resistance to<br>
electrostatic discharge. High pressure of electrostatic discharge applied through the<br>
output ports from outside is discharged to ground port 34b through the third capacitor<br>
C43 having the largest capacitance, and the first resistor R51 prevents the electrostatic<br>
discharge from being applied directly to the inside circuit section. To achieve such a<br>
result, the third capacitor C43 must have a large capacitance, enough to store current<br>
caused by the high pressure of electrostatic discharge, that is, the third capacitor C43<br>
must be at least InF.<br>
In a condenser microphone having a circuit as constructed according to the<br>
example described above, electromagnetic noise over a wide frequency band<br>
including 10w frequency and radio frequency can be reduced. Further, a condenser<br>
microphone according to the present invention has an improved resistance enough to<br>
stand against electrostatic discharge of even above 8KV applied from outside when<br>
the microphone is grounded and high pressure of electrostatic discharge is applied<br>
directly to the output ports.<br><br>
In such a sixth embodiment, an electric signal of the microphone inputted<br>
through the gate G of the FET 30 is amplified in the FET 30 so as to have 10w noise,<br>
and is transmitted to a sound process circuit of a mobile terminal through the output<br>
ports 34a and 34b with noise removed by a wide band stop filter b10cking signals of<br>
radio frequency band, in which the wide band stop filter is realized by the first<br>
capacitor C41, the second capacitor C42, the third capacitor C43, and the first resistor<br>
R51.<br>
