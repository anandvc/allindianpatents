STATEMENT OF FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
[0002]	Not applicable.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Technical Field<br>
[0003]	The present invention relates to unions for coupling a water<br>
line to the inlet of a pump, such as that used in hydrotherapeutic spas.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
US patents 3, 680, 896 and 4, 661, 041 are hereby<br>
incorporated by way of reference. However, present invention is distinguished<br>
from these by a tab projecting from an angled section essentially parallel to<br>
the centerline and having an axial slot sized to receive a nib fixed with<br>
respect to the opening.<br>
[0004]	Hydrotherapeutic spas or baths include water jets for imparting<br>
turbulence in the water. The jets are downstream from one or more water<br>
pumps. Each pump is fed water through an inlet flange to which is connected<br>
a supply pipe, typically made of polyvinyl chloride material. Conventional<br>
supply pipes are of a diameter slightly smaller than the opening to the input<br>
flange. Thus, a special union or coupler is used to mate the pipe to the input<br>
flange. This coupler can be formed as a part of the flange or can be a<br>
separate piece connected in some manner to the flange.<br>
[0005]	For example, the input flange may have a tubular extension<br>
defining the inlet opening. A separate tubular coupler can be mated with the<br>
tubular extension by a collar threaded onto the extension and capturing a<br>
peripheral flange on the coupler. The wall thickness of the coupler reduces its<br>
inner diameter so that it is sized just large enough to accept the outer<br>
diameter of the supply pipe, thereby providing the union of the supply pipe to<br>
the input flange. One or more o-rings can be used to seal the connection<br>
when the collar is tightened. U.S. patent 5,701,388, hereby incorporated by<br>
reference as though fully set forth herein, discloses a similar arrangement<br>
and a pump unit of the type for which the present invention is designed to be<br>
used.<br>
[0006]	The problem with the existing constructions is that the wall<br>
thickness of the coupler and/or the supply pipe extends radially inward (of<br><br>
lesser diameter) than the opening in the input flange. The coupler and<br>
possibly the supply pipe can thus become an obstruction to the return flow of<br>
water from the input flange causing damming or pooling of water during<br>
periods when the pump is not being operated. The amount of residual water<br>
retained in the pump or its supply lines is regulated to reduce the occurrence<br>
of bacteria developing in stagnate water. One way of reducing the amount<br>
of residual water retention is to raise the pump slightly and tilt it back several<br>
degrees from horizontal so that more of the water will drain back through the<br>
supply line by gravity. However, doing this can make stabilizing the pump<br>
difficult as well as create some downstream water drainage problems in the<br>
suction line because of the now decreased overall pitch from the water jets to<br>
the pump.<br>
[0007] Accordingly, an improved connection at the inlet flange of the<br>
pump is desired.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008] The present invention provides an open-ended coupler, for<br>
joining a pipe to a larger opening , has a passageway defined by straight and<br>
angled sections. The straight section has a uniform inner diameter concentric<br>
about a centerline sized to receive the outer diameter of the pipe. The angled<br>
section has a narrow end with an inner diameter no greater than the inner<br>
diameter of the pipe and less than that of a wide end and of the straight<br>
section. The angled section has an upper portion above the centerline that at<br>
least in part increases in radius from the narrow end to the wide end. A<br>
lower portion has a constant radius, at least along a line extending between<br>
the narrow and wide ends at a six o'clock position with respect" to the open<br>
end of the angled section.<br>
[0009] In one preferred form the angled section narrow end has a<br>
smaller inner diameter than that of the pipe.<br>
[0010]	In another preferred form the angred section wide end defines a<br>
circular face groove holding an o-ring.<br>
[0011] In still another preferred form the angled section wide end<br>
includes an alignment feature for fixing the rotational position of the coupler<br><br>
about the centerline. The alignment feature is preferably at the upper<br>
portion of the angled section and includes a tab projecting from the angled<br>
section essentially parallel to the centerline with an axial slot sized to receive<br>
a pin fixed with respect to the opening.<br>
[0012] The present invention thus provides an improved coupler<br>
specially designed to connect a standard diameter water supply pipe to the<br>
inlet of a pump housing without obstructing back flow of water and causing<br>
pooling when the pump is not being operated. The integral alignment feature<br>
ensures that the coupler is oriented properly so that damming does not occur.<br>
The face groove accepts standard o-rings for sealing the connection.<br>
Additionally, the internal passageway transitions smoothly to the wider end so<br>
as not to adversely impact the pressure and flow characteristics of the water<br>
passing through the connection.<br>
[0013] These and still other advantages of the invention will be<br>
apparent from the detailed description and drawings. What follows is a<br>
description of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. To assess<br>
the full scope of the invention the claims should be looked to as the preferred<br>
embodiment is not intended as the only embodiment within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019] Referring to FIGS. .1-3, the present invention provides a specially<br>
designed coupler 10, which in one application, can be used to connect a<br>
water supply pipe 12 (shown in phantom) to the opening 13 of an input<br><br>
flange 14 of a water pump (not shown) used to circulate water In a<br>
hydrotherapeutic spa. The diameter of the opening 13 and the outer<br>
diameter of the supply pipe 12 are standard sizes with the opening 13 being<br>
larger such that the supply pipe 12 cannot mate directly with the input flange<br>
14 without leaking.<br>
[0020] Referring to FIGS. 2, 3 and 5, the coupler 10 is a generally<br>
tubular piece having a straight section 16 and an angled section 18 defining a<br>
passageway 20 opening at opposite ends 22 and 24 of the coupler 10. The<br>
inner diameter of end 22 is rounded to ease insertion of the supply pipe 12<br>
therein. The straight section 16 is cylindrical having an inner diameter and an<br>
outer diameter, both of uniform radius and concentric about a centerline 26.<br>
The straight section 16 transitions the angled section 18 at an intermediate<br>
internal narrow end 28 of the angled section 18 at which point the coupler 10<br>
defines a radially inward step so that the passageway 20 is at its narrowest.<br>
From there, the coupler 10 angles in an upward direction so that the wide<br>
end 24 is axially offset from end 22. The interior surface of the angled<br>
section 18 varies with respect to its exterior surface as it moves from its<br>
narrow end 28 to the wide end 24.<br>
[0021]	With reference to FIGS. 3-5, in particular, the exterior surface<br>
initially angles and then straightens up to an outwardly stepped peripheral<br>
flange 30. Although angled, the exterior surface has a generally circular<br>
cross-section. The interior surface, on the other hand, smoothly tapers<br>
radially outward from the narrow end 28 to the wide end 24. More<br>
specifically, an upper portion of the interior surface, that is above centerline<br>
26 in FIG. 3, expands outward such that the radius from the centerline varies<br>
(increases) from the narrow end 28 to the wide end 24. In fact, the entire<br>
interior surface expands in this manner except for along a straight portion 32<br>
at the very bottom or 6 o'clock position below centerline 26 where the radius<br>
from the centerline is uniform from the narrow end 28 to the wide end 24.<br>
This flat or straight portion 32 smoothly contours into the curved interior<br>
surface (see FIG. 4) so that the entire interior surface transitions smoothly<br><br>
from narrow to wide so as not to induce changes in the pressure or flow of<br>
the water passing through the coupler 10.<br>
[0022] Referring to FIG. 3, the above configuration is designed to<br>
eliminate obstructions or damming surfaces that prevent the free flow of<br>
water returning from the pump back into the supply pipe 12. As shown, the<br>
straight bottom 32 of the angled section 18 is essentially aligned with the<br>
bottom of the opening 13 in the pump flange 14 and in addition is preferably<br>
radially inside of the inner diameter of the supply pipe 12, although it could<br>
be flush. The upper portion of the coupler 10 above the centerline 26 is not<br>
important in this regard since water will run down to the bottom by gravity.<br>
[0023] The wide end 24 of the coupler 10 defines a face groove 34<br>
holding an o-ring 38 for sealing against a tubular extension 40 of the input<br>
flange 14. The tubular extension 40 is threaded externally so that an<br>
internally threaded collar 42 can secure the coupler 10 (and thereby the<br>
supply pipe 12) to the input flange 14. The collar 42 has a lip 44 that clamps<br>
against the peripheral flange 30 of the coupler 10. Turning.the collar 42<br>
tightens the coupler 10 to the input flange 14 and compresses the o-ring 38<br>
to create a tight seal. Preferably, the coupler 10 and the supply pipe 12 are<br>
made of polyvinyl chloride such that the conventional bonding cement can be<br>
used to secure these two pieces together.<br>
[0024] The proper orientation of the coupler 10 with respect to the<br>
input flange 14 is essential to prevent damming. Thus, a special alignment<br>
feature 46 is provided at the upper portion of the coupler 10. The alignment<br>
feature 46 is essentially a tab or projection extending from the wide end 24<br>
parallel to the centerline 26. The tab has an axial slot 48 opening at its distal<br>
end which is sized to fit around a nib 50 on the tubular extension 40 of the<br>
input flange 14 extending radially inward toward the center of the opening<br>
13. The nib 50 and the tab are at the 12. o'clock position such that the<br>
coupler 10 is connected in the proper orientation with the angled section 18<br>
angling up from the straight section 16 when the nib 50 is within the slot 48.<br>
[0025] The present invention thus provides an improved coupler .<br>
specially designed to connect a standard water supply pipe to the<br><br>
inlet of a pump housing without obstructing back flow of water and causing pooling when the<br>
pump is not being operated. The integral alignment feature ensures that the coupler is<br>
oriented properly so that damming does not occur. The face groove accepts standard o-rings<br>
for sealing the connection.<br>
Additionally, the internal passageway transitions smoothly to the wider end so as not to<br>
adversely impact the pressure and flow characteristics of the water passing through the<br>
connection.<br>
[0026] It should be appreciated that merely a preferred embodiment of the invention has<br>
been described above. However, many modifications and variations to the preferred<br>
embodiment will be apparent to those skilled in the art, which will be within the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention. Therefore, the invention should not be limited to the described<br>
embodiment. To ascertain the full scope of the invention, the following claims should be<br>
referenced.<br>
