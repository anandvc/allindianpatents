SILICONE CONVEYOR LUBRICANT WITH<br>
STOICHIOMETRIC AMOUNT OF AN ACID<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to conveyor lubricants and to a method for conveying<br>
articles. The invention also relates to conveyor systems and containers wholly or<br>
partially coated with such lubricant compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In commercial container filling or packaging operations, the containers<br>
typically are moved by a conveying system at very high rates of speed. Dilute<br>
aqueous lubricant compositions are typically applied to the conveyor or containers<br>
using spray or pumping equipment. These lubricant compositions permit high-speed<br>
operation of the conveyor and limit marring of the containers or labels. One problem<br>
that can occur with thermoplastic beverage containers made from polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET) is environmental stress cracking. Stress cracking in polymers is<br>
the development of cracks normal to an applied stress as a result of stress promoted<br>
chemical degradation. Typically amorphous polymers are more susceptible to stress<br>
cracking. In the case of PET, it is the amorphous regions of a beverage container<br>
such as the center of the base of a PET bottle that are most susceptible to stress<br>
cracking. When stress cracks penetrate through the wall of a PET bottle, the bottle<br>
fails either by leaking or bursting. Because of environmental stress cracking, bottles<br>
filled with carbonated drinks are at risk for failure, especially at elevated<br>
temperatures (e.g., warmer weather, elevated storage temperatures, etc.). The risk of<br>
environmental stress cracking is exacerbated by the presence of materials which are<br>
incompatible with PET. Materials that, when in contact with PET increase the rate<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/IJS2006/023300<br><br>
of occurrence of environmental stress cracking are considered incompatible with<br>
PET while materials that result in no increase in environmental stress cracking are<br>
considered compatible with PET. The failure rate of PET bottles is greater for<br>
bottles that have been contacted with alkaline water than for bottles that have been<br>
contacted with deionized water, thus it can be stated that the presence of alkalinity<br>
decreases the compatibility of aqueous compositions with PET bottles.<br>
It is often the case that water used in the preparation of conveyor lubricant<br>
compositions contains alkalinity. For example, the alkalinity of water used for<br>
dilution of conveyor lubricants in bottling plants typically ranges between about 10<br>
ppm and 100 ppm, expressed as ppm of CaCC&gt;3 (calcium carbonate), with occasional<br>
values above 100 ppm. According to the International Society of Beverage<br>
Technologists web site, it is strongly recommended to keep the total alkalinity level<br>
(expressed as CaCOs) below 50 mg/L (equivalent to 50 ppm as CaC03) in the water<br>
used to dilute lubricant concentrate compositions (lube make up water) in order to<br>
minimize the risk of stress crack failure. It is therefore important for conveyor<br>
lubricant compositions to show good compatibility with PET beverage bottles in the<br>
case that the dilution water contains alkalinity, particularly in the case that the<br>
dilution water exhibits alkalinity levels above 50 ppm and up to and in excess of 100<br>
ppm, measured as CaC03.<br>
Silicone based lubricants are preferred lubricants for PET bottles because<br>
they provide improved lubrication properties and significantly increased conveyor<br>
efficiency. Silicone containing lubricant compositions are described, for example in<br>
US Patent 6,495,494 (Li et. Al which is incorporated by reference herein in its<br>
entirety). However, aqueous silicone based lubricants may be considered to be less<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PO7US2006/023300<br><br>
compatible with PET than other types of lubricants such as phosphate ester based<br>
lubricants. For example, conventional aqueous silicone lubricant compositions<br>
generally show a relatively higher incidence of stress cracking under conditions of<br>
high alkalinity. There has therefore been an unmet need in the field of conveyor<br>
lubrication which is an aqueous silicone conveyor lubricant that exhibits good<br>
compatibility with PET, particularly in the case that the lubricant contains alkalinity,<br>
for example from the dilution water.<br>
It is against this background that the present invention has been made.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Surprisingly, it has been discovered that a silicone based lubricant with<br>
greater than a stoichiometric amount of an organic acid increases the compatibility<br>
of the silicone based lubricant with PET. By stoichiometric it is meant an amount of<br>
acid such that there is at least about one equivalent of available, unneutralized acid<br>
in the composition for each two equivalents of alkaline compounds present in water<br>
used for preparing the lubricant mixture. Water with 50 ppm alkalinity as calcium<br>
carbonate contains 0.001 equivalents of alkalinity per kg. In the case that the water<br>
alkalinity is equivalent to about 50 ppm CaC03, a stoichiometric amount of acid is<br>
therefore an amount of acid such that there will be greater than about 0.0005<br>
equivalents of available, unneutralized acid per kilogram of the lubricant<br>
composition before reaction with alkalinity present in the water used to prepare the<br>
composition. Accordingly, the present invention provides, in one aspect, a method<br>
for lubricating the passage of a container along a conveyor comprising applying a<br>
composition of a water-miscible silicone material comprising one or more acid<br>
compounds in an amount sufficient to provide at least one equivalent of available,<br>
3<br><br>
wo :oir-ii4iM.-'s<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
unneutralized acid for every two equivalents of alkalinity in water used to prepare<br>
the lubricant composition to at least a portion of the container contacting surface of<br>
the conveyor or to at least a portion of the conveyor-contacting surface of the<br>
container. The present invention provides, in another aspect, a method for<br>
lubricating the passage of a container along a conveyor comprising applying a<br>
composition of a water-miscible silicone material wherein the lubricant composition<br>
comprises greater than about 0.0005 equivalents of available, unneutralized acid per<br>
kilogram of the lubricant composition before reaction with alkalinity present in the<br>
water used to prepare the composition. The present invention provides, in another<br>
aspect, a method for lubricating the passage of a container along a conveyor<br>
comprising applying a composition of a water-miscible silicone material comprising<br>
one or more acid compounds in an amount sufficient to provide a pH of less than<br>
about 6.4 when the lubricant concentrate is diluted with water comprising greater<br>
than about 50 ppm alkalinity as CaC03 to at least a portion of the container<br>
contacting surface of the conveyor or to at least a portion of the conveyor-contacting<br>
surface of the container. The invention provides, in another aspect, conveyor<br>
lubricant compositions comprising a water-miscible silicone material and greater<br>
than about 0.0005 equivalents of available, unneutralized acid per kilogram of the<br>
lubricant composition before reaction with alkalinity present in the water used to<br>
prepare the composition. The present invention provides, in another aspect, a<br>
lubricant concentrate composition comprising a water-miscible silicone material and<br>
greater than about 0.05 equivalents of unneutralized acid per kg of the lubricant<br>
concentrate composition. These and other aspects of this invention will be evident<br>
upon reference to the following detailed description of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Definitions<br>
For the following defined terms, these definitions shall be applied, unless a<br>
different definition is given in the claims or elsewhere in this specification.<br>
All numeric values are herein assumed to be modified by the term "about,"<br>
whether or not explicitly indicated. The term "about" generally refers to a range of<br>
numbers that one of skill in the art would consider equivalent to the recited value<br>
(i.e., having the same function or result). In many instances, the term "about" may<br>
include numbers that are rounded to the nearest significant figure.<br>
Weight percent, percent by weight, % by weight, wt %, and the like are<br>
synonyms that refer to the concentration of a substance as the weight of that<br>
substance divided by the weight of the composition and multiplied by 100.<br>
The recitation of numerical ranges by endpoints includes all numbers<br>
subsumed within that range (e.g. 1 to 5 includes 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4 and 5).<br>
As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a,"<br>
"an," and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
Thus, for example, reference to a composition containing "a compound" includes a<br>
mixture of two or more compounds. As used in this specification and the appended<br>
claims, the term "or" is generally employed in its sense including "and/or" unless<br>
the content clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
Compositions<br>
The invention provides a lubricant coating that reduces the coefficient of<br>
friction of coated conveyor parts and containers and thereby facilitates movement of<br>
containers along a conveyor line. The present invention provides in one aspect, a<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
method for lubricating the passage of a container along a conveyor comprising<br>
applying a composition of a water-miscible silicone material to at least a portion of<br>
the container contacting surface of the conveyor or to at least a portion of the<br>
conveyor-contacting surface of the container, wherein the lubricant composition<br>
comprises one or more acid compounds in an amount sufficient to provide at least<br>
one equivalent of available, unneutralized acid for every two equivalents of<br>
alkalinity in water used to prepare the lubricant composition. The available<br>
unneutralized acid comes from one or more acid compounds present in the lubricant<br>
composition. The concentration of available, unneutralized acid before reaction<br>
with alkalinity present in the water used to prepare the composition can be<br>
determined by preparing a composition with deionized water and titrating the acid to<br>
approximately pH 8.3, or by calculating the concentration of acid present in a<br>
composition diluted with deionized water using formulation data. For example, if<br>
the lubricant concentrate of Example 1 was diluted with deionized water instead of<br>
water containing 168 ppm sodium bicarbonate, there would be 0.0034 equivalents of<br>
succinic acid per kg of the use composition and 0.0009 equivalents of sodium<br>
hydroxide per kg of the use composition, and therefore 0.0025 equivalents of<br>
available, unneutralized succinic acid per kg of the use composition before reaction<br>
with alkalinity present in the water. The total alkalinity of the water used to dilute<br>
the lubricant concentrate composition can be determined by an acid base titration.<br>
For example, 1000 g of the water used to dilute the lubricant concentrate<br>
composition can be titrated to approximately pH 4.3 using 0.1 N HC1 solution. In<br>
this case, the ppm alkalinity as CaC03 per mL of titrant can be calculated according<br>
to:<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCMJS2006/023300<br><br>
alkalinity as CaC03 per 1.0 mL of titrant =<br>
(LP mL) x (0.1 equivalent/1000 mL) x (50 g CaCCh/equivalent)<br>
1000 g<br>
= 0.005 g CaCO3/1000 g = 50 ppm as CaC03 per mL of titrant.<br>
The total alkalinity of the water used to dilute the lubricant concentrate<br>
composition in the Examples herein can be calculated by formulation. For example,<br>
in Example 1 the ppm alkalinity as CaC03 of water containing 168 ppm NaHC03<br>
can be calculated according to:<br>
alkalinity as CaC03 =<br>
(0.168 g NaHCCVlOOO g) x (50 g CaC03/equivalent)<br>
84 g NaHC03/cquivalent<br>
= 0.100 g CaCO3/1000 g = 100 ppm alkalinity as CaC03<br>
Lubricant compositions according to the present invention will contain in<br>
addition to the water-miscible silicone material unneutralized acid compounds.<br>
Lubricant compositions of the present invention may also optionally include, in<br>
addition to silicone and unneutralized acid compounds, water-miscible lubricants,<br>
wetting agents that improve the wetting of the lubricant to PET, and other functional<br>
ingredients.<br>
Ester bonds as are present in PET are well known to hydrolyze under<br>
conditions of either acid or base catalysis. It is expected that the overall rate of ester<br>
bond hydrolysis would be at a minimum at approximately neutral pH, where both<br>
hydronium ions and hydroxide ions are present at minimum concentrations.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that the "compatibility" of a silicone emulsion based<br>
conveyor lubricant composition prepared with water containing bicarbonate<br>
alkalinity is not improved when the lubricant composition has approximately<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
neutral pH, but instead is improved when the lubricant composition has at least a<br>
stoichiometric amount of unneutralized acid, in which case the pH is less than about<br>
6.4. For example, addition of sufficient acid to adjust the pH of a conveyor lubricant<br>
use composition down to 7.20 did not result in a decrease in the failure rate of<br>
carbonated PET bottles contacted with the lubricant composition relative to a control<br>
composition with pH equal to 8.20. By stoichiometric it is meant an amount of acid<br>
such that there is at least about one equivalent of available, unneutralized acid in the<br>
composition for every two equivalents of alkaline compounds present in water used<br>
for preparing the lubricant composition. In the case that the water used for preparing<br>
the lubricant composition comprises alkalinity equivalent to 50 ppm as CaC03, a<br>
stoichiometric amount of acid is an amount of acid such that there will be about<br>
0.0005 equivalents or more of available, unneutralized acid in the lubricant<br>
composition before reaction with alkaline compounds present in the water used to<br>
prepare the composition. The compatibility of lubricant use compositions is<br>
improved even more in the case that there are two times or four times a<br>
stoichiometric amount of acid.<br>
While we do not wish to be bound by theory, it is believed that neutralizing<br>
alkalinity to neutral pH does not improve the compatibility because the pH can<br>
subsequently increase upon complete or partial evaporation of the lubricant<br>
composition and consequent loss of carbon dioxide. It is believed that sufficient<br>
acid is required in order to substantially oppose upward shifts in system pH that can<br>
occur by evaporative loss of carbon dioxide. As used herein, "system" refers to the<br>
liquid lubricant composition as it contacts the PET bottle, the residue that is left on<br>
the bottle after evaporation and all forms intermediate between starting liquid and<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2(107/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
final residue. According to the well known Henderson - Hasselbach equation, the<br>
pH of an acid solution is equal to the pKa value of the acid when it is half<br>
neutralized, that is when there are equimolar concentrations of the acid and the<br>
conjugate base in solution. Bicarbonate anion is the conjugate base of carbonic acid,<br>
H2CO3. The pKa value for the first ionization of carbonic acid is often quoted as<br>
approximately 6.4 (Weast, R. C, Editor (1976) CRC Handbook, 57th Edition,<br>
Cleveland OH: Chemical Rubber Publishing Company). This value is in fact<br>
misleading because it incorporates the equilibrium constant between dissolved<br>
carbon dioxide and carbonic acid, and the pKa value of 6.4 is better described as the<br>
acidity constant of carbon dioxide, not carbonic acid (Cotton, F. A. and Wilkinson,<br>
G (1980) Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, Fourth Edition, New York, NY: John<br>
Wiley and Sons). Thus at about pH 6.4, bicarbonate anion exists in a complex<br>
equilibrium with carbonic acid and dissolved carbon dioxide. When there is<br>
provided a stoichiometric amount of available unneutralized acid, that is, at least<br>
about one equivalent of available, unneutralized acid in the composition for every<br>
two equivalents of bicarbonate anion present in the water used for preparing the<br>
lubricant before reaction, at equilibrium the concentration of acid species (primarily<br>
dissolved carbon dioxide) will be greater than approximately the concentration of<br>
bicarbonate anion and the pH of the buffered system will be less than or equal to<br>
approximately 6.4. More preferably, when there are provided two times a<br>
stoichiometric amount of available unneutralized acid, that is, two equivalents of<br>
available, unneutralized acid in the composition for every two equivalents of<br>
bicarbonate anion present in the water used for preparing the lubricant before<br>
reaction there will be a much lower concentration of bicarbonate ion at equilibrium.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2(107/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
In this case if even if complete loss of C02 from the system occurs, there will remain<br>
only the conjugate base of the provided acid and further loss of C02 from<br>
unneutralized bicarbonate anion to give more basic and potentially more PET<br>
incompatible anions such as carbonate and hydroxide ions is prevented. Even more<br>
preferably, there is provided three times a stoichiometric amount of available<br>
unneutralized acid, that is, three equivalents of available, unneutralized acid in the<br>
composition for every two equivalents of alkalinity present in the water used for<br>
preparing the lubricant before reaction. In this case, if complete loss of CO2 from<br>
the system occurs, there will be a mixture of the added acid and its conjugate base.<br>
Surprisingly, the presence of three or more equivalents of available, unneutralized<br>
acid in the composition has been found to give greatly improved PET compatibility,<br>
in spite of the presence of excess acid in the case that carbon dioxide is not lost from<br>
the system or in the case the composition is prepared with water that is free from<br>
alkalinity.<br>
Regardless of the mechanism, the present invention has been observed to<br>
reduce stress cracking in PET bottles when compared to prior art and comparison<br>
compositions, based on the presence of a stoichiometric amount of an organic acid.<br>
Accordingly, compositions of the present invention comprise at least a<br>
stoichiometric amount of acid and comprise, for every two equivalents of alkalinity<br>
in water used to prepare the composition, at least about one equivalent, at least about<br>
two equivalents, or at least about three equivalents of acid, before reaction with<br>
alkalinity in the water used to prepare the composition.<br>
In the case that the water alkalinity is equivalent to about 50 ppm CaC03, a<br>
stoichiometric amount of acid is an amount of acid such that there will be about<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2(107/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
0.0005 equivalents or more of available, unneutralized acid per kilogram of the<br>
mixture in the lubricant mixture before reaction with alkalinity. Accordingly,<br>
compositions of the present invention comprise available, unneutralized acid in an<br>
amount at least about 0.0005 equivalents per kilogram, at least about 0.001<br>
equivalents per kilogram, or at least about 0.002 equivalents per kilogram of<br>
composition.<br>
In compositions that comprise a stoichiometric amount of acid, that is, at<br>
least about one equivalent of available, unneutralized acid for every two equivalents<br>
of alkalinity, the concentration of the conjugate acid of bicarbonate anion will be<br>
present in a concentration greater than approximately the concentration of<br>
bicarbonate anion, in which case the composition pH will be less than approximately<br>
the carbon dioxide/bicarbonate pKa value which is approximately 6.4. Accordingly,<br>
when prepared with water containing greater than about 50 ppm alkalinity as<br>
CaCO.3, compositions of the present invention have pH less than about 6.4, less than<br>
about 6.0, or less than about 5.<br>
Lubricant compositions of the present invention can be applied undiluted or<br>
may be diluted before use. It may be desirable to provide compositions of the<br>
present invention in the form of concentrates that can be diluted with water at the<br>
point of use to give use compositions. Inventive lubricant concentrate compositions<br>
comprise a water-miscible silicone material and an amount of available,<br>
unneutralized acid effective to provide at least about 0.0005 equivalents of available,<br>
unneutralized acid per Kg in a lubricant composition that results from diluting one<br>
pail of the lubricant concentrate with between 100 and 1000 parts of water and/or<br>
hydrophilic diluent. Accordingly, lubricant concentrate compositions comprise at<br>
11<br><br>
wo Mir i&gt;4o<rx></rx><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
least about 0.05 equivalents per liter, at least about 0.1 equivalents per liter, or at<br>
least about 0.2 equivalents per liter of available, unneutralized acid.<br>
The silicone material and acid are "water-miscible", that is, they are<br>
sufficiently water-soluble or water-dispersible so that when added to water at the<br>
desired use level they form a stable solution, emulsion, or suspension. The desired<br>
use level will vary according to the particular conveyor or container application, and<br>
according to the type of silicone and wetting agent employed.<br>
The present invention includes one or more water-miscible silicone<br>
materials. A variety of water-miscible silicone materials can be employed in the<br>
lubricant compositions, including silicone emulsions (such as emulsions formed<br>
from methyl (dimethyl), higher alkyl and aryl silicones; and functionalized silicones<br>
such as chlorosilanes; amino-, methoxy-, epoxy- and vinyl-substituted siloxanes;<br>
and silanols). Suitable silicone emulsions include E2175 high viscosity<br>
polydimethylsiloxane (a 60% siloxane emulsion commercially available from<br>
Lambent Technologies, Inc.), E2140 polydimethylsiloxane (a 35% siloxane<br>
emulsion commercially available from Lambent Technologies, Inc.), E21456 FG<br>
food grade intermediate viscosity polydimethylsiloxane (a 35% siloxane emulsion<br>

commercially available from Dow Corning Corporation), SM2135<br>
polydimethylsiloxane (a nonionic 50% siloxane emulsion commercially available<br>
from GE Silicones) and SM2167 polydimethylsiloxane (a cationic 50% siloxane<br>
emulsion commercially available from GE Silicones). Other water-miscible silicone<br>
materials include finely divided silicone powders such as the TOSPEARLâ¢ series<br>

QUATQ-400M cationic silicone surfactant and 703 specialty silicone surfactant (all<br>
commercially available from Lambent Technologies, Inc.).<br>
Polydimethylsiloxane emulsions are preferred silicone materials. Generally<br>
the concentration of the active silicone material useful in the present invention<br>
exclusive of any dispersing agents, water, diluents, or other ingredients used to<br>
emulsify the silicone material or otherwise make it miscible with water falls in the<br>
range of about 0.0005 wt. % to about 5.0 wt. %, preferably 0.001 wt. % to about 1.0<br>
wt. %, and more preferably 0.002 wt. % to about 0.50 wt. %. In the case that the<br>
lubricant composition is provided in the form of a concentrate, the concentration of<br>
active silicone material useful in the present invention exclusive of any dispersing<br>
agents, water, diluents, or other ingredients used to emulsify the silicone material or<br>
otherwise make it miscible with water falls in the range of about 0.05 wt. % to about<br>
20 wt. %, preferably 0.10 wt. % to about 5 wt. %, and more preferably 0.2 wt. % to<br>
about 1.0 wt. %.<br>
The present invention includes one or more acid compounds. Preferred acids<br>
for this invention have pKa values between about 2.0 and about 6.4, that is, they are<br>
relatively weaker acids. It is believed that the pKa value must be below about 6.4,<br>
that is, sufficiently strong that bicarbonate anion will be substantially protonated.<br>
The pKa value is not required to be lower than that of carbonic acid which is<br>
approximately 3.6, again owing to the complex equilibrium between dissolved<br>
carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, and bicarbonate anion. Acids with pKa values above<br>
about 2.0 are preferred because acids with lower pKa values, i.e. stronger acids, will<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
result in objectionably low pH for lubricant concentrate compositions and for<br>
lubricant use compositions that have been prepared with water free from alkalinity.<br>
The pKa value is important because it determines the pH of the concentrated lube<br>
composition and the diluted use lubricant composition. Using acids that are too<br>
strong (that is, have low pKa values below about 2.0) will result in undesirably low<br>
pi 1 in the concentrated lubricant composition and in lubricant compositions that<br>
have been diluted with water that does not contain alkalinity. Relatively higher pH<br>
of the lubricant concentrate is valuable because it reduces the corrosivity of the<br>
composition and makes the composition less hazardous to manufacture, package,<br>
transport and store. Relatively higher pH of the use composition makes the<br>
composition less corrosive and more compatible with dispensing equipment and<br>
conveyor equipment. Examples of inorganic acids with pKa values between 2.5 and<br>
about 6.4 include dialkyl phosphoric acid compounds, disodium dihydrogen<br>
pyrophosphate (Na2H2P207), and nitrous acid. Useful organic acids include<br>
carboxylic acids and anilinium salts.   Preferred organic acids are carboxylic acid<br>
compounds. Particularly preferred acids are di- or poly- functional organic<br>
compounds. By di- or poly- functional it is meant that the organic compound<br>
contains, in addition to one carboxylic acid group, one or more of a second<br>
functional moiety selected from the group including carboxylic acid, ketone,<br>
aldehyde, ester, carbonate, urea, amide, ether, amine, ammonium, and hydroxyl<br>
groups. The importance of a second functional group on the carboxylic acid<br>
compound molecule is it minimizes the volatility and odor of the acid. Particularly<br>
preferred acids are sufficiently non-volatile so as to not provide an objectionable<br>
odor. Useful carboxylic acid compounds in the present invention include formic,<br>
14<br><br>

PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
acetic, propionic, hydroxy acetic, lactic, malonic, maleic, succinic, glutaric, adipic,<br>
hydroxy succinic, malic, fumaric, itaconic, citric, and gluconic acids, and carboxylic<br>
acid functional polymers such as homopolymers and copolymers of acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, maleic acid, and itaconic acid, and mixtures thereof. In<br>
compositions of the present invention, carboxylic acid compounds can also act as<br>
corrosion inhibitors. A preferred acid is a mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic<br>
acid commercially available from BASF under the trade name SOKALANâ¢ DCS.<br>
In preferred compositions of the present invention, particularly concentrate<br>
compositions, it might be desirable to partially neutralize acids. By partially<br>
neutralizing acids in lubricant compositions of the present invention, the pH of the<br>
lubricant concentrate and the pH of the lubricant use composition that has been<br>
prepared using water with low alkalinity can be increased. Relatively higher pH of<br>
the lubricant concentrate is valuable because it reduces the corrosivity of the<br>
composition and makes the composition less hazardous to manufacture, package,<br>
transport and store. Relatively higher pH of the use composition makes the<br>
composition less corrosive and more compatible with dispensing equipment and<br>
conveyor equipment. In the case that acid compounds are partially neutralized, it is<br>
important that there remains at least about one equivalent of available, unneutralized<br>
acid in the mixture for each equivalent of alkaline compounds in the mixture, where<br>
the alkaline compounds originate from water used to prepare the mixture.<br>
In preferred compositions of the present invention, organic acids may be<br>
present as peracids. Typically peracid compounds are in equilibrium with hydrogen<br>
peroxide and organic acids. By providing organic acids in the form of peracids, the<br>
pH of the lubricant concentrate can be increased.<br>

Care should be taken to avoid the use of acids that might promote<br>
environmental stress cracking in plastic containers when evaluated using the PET<br>
stress Crack Test Set out below. Examples of preferred acids include acetic, lactic,<br>
succinic, glutaric, adipic, and citric acid and partially neutralized compositions<br>
thereof. Examples of particularly preferred lubricant compositions include those<br>
having from about 0.001 to about 0.02% of a water-miscible silicone material and<br>
from about 0.01 to about 0.10% of a mixture of citric acid and dihydrogen citrate<br>
anion.<br>
Examples of particularly preferred lubricant concentrate compositions<br>
include those having from about 0.10% to about 2% of a water-miscible silicone<br>
material and about 4% to about 20% of a mixture of citric acid and dihydrogen<br>
citrate anion.<br>
Particularly preferred lubricant compositions are substantially aqueous that<br>
is, they comprise greater than about 99% of water.<br>
Lubricant compositions of the present invention can be applied as is or may<br>
be diluted before use. It may be desirable to provide compositions of the present<br>
invention in the form of concentrates that can be diluted with water at the point of<br>
use to give use compositions. If diluted, preferred ratios for dilution at the point of<br>
use range from about 1:100 to 1:1000 (parts of concentrate: parts of water).<br>
In the case that lubricant compositions are provided in the form of<br>
concentrates, it is particularly preferred to select silicone materials and acids that<br>
form stable compositions at 100 to 1000 times the concentration of the use<br>
composition.<br>

Preferred lubricant compositions may also contain a wetting agent. Lubricant<br>
compositions that comprise a wetting agent and have improved compatibility with<br>
PET are disclosed in assignee's copending patent application, titled SILICONE<br>
LUBRICANT WITH GOOD WETTING ON PET SURFACES, filed on September<br>
22, 2005, with attorney docket number 2259US01, which application is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety. Compositions which comprise both a<br>
stoichiometric amount of acid and wetting agent sufficient to lower the contact angle<br>
to less than about 60 degrees may exhibit a synergistic effect, that is, the overall<br>
reduction of the failure rate for PET bottles may be greater than the sum of the<br>
reduction of the failure rate for either a stoichiometric amount of acid or wetting<br>
agent alone.<br>
The lubricant compositions can contain functional ingredients if desired. For<br>
example, the compositions can contain hydrophilic diluents, antimicrobial agents,<br>
stabilizing/coupling agents, detergents and dispersing agents, anti-wear agents,<br>
viscosity modifiers, sequestrants, corrosion inhibitors, film forming materials,<br>
antioxidants or antistatic agents. The amounts and types of such additional<br>
components will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
Water-miscible Lubricants<br>
A variety of water-miscible lubricants can be employed in the lubricant<br>
compositions, including hydroxy-containing compounds such as polyols (e.g.,<br>
glycerol and propylene glycol); polyalkylene glycols (e.g., the CARBOWAXTM<br>
series of polyethylene and methoxypolyethylene glycols, commercially available<br>
from Union Carbide Corp.); linear copolymers of ethylene and propylene oxides<br>
(e.g., UCONTM 50-FJB-100 water-soluble ethylene oxide:propylene oxide<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2007/(14(1678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
copolymer, commercially available from Union Carbide Corp.); and sorbitan esters<br>
(e.g., TWEENTM series 20, 40, 60, 80 and 85 polyoxyethylene sorbitan<br>
monooleates and SPANTM series 20, 80, 83 and 85 sorbitan esters, commercially<br>
available from ICI Surfactants). Other suitable water-miscible lubricants include<br>
phosphate esters, amines and their derivatives, and other commercially available<br>
water-miscible lubricants that will be familiar to those skilled in the art. Derivatives<br>
(e.g., partial esters or ethoxylates) of the above lubricants can also be employed. For<br>
applications involving plastic containers, care should be taken to avoid the use of<br>
water-miscible lubricants that might promote environmental stress cracking in<br>
plastic containers when evaluated using the PET Stress Crack Test set out below.<br>
Preferably the water-miscible lubricant is a polyol such as glycerol or a linear<br>
copolymer of ethylene and propylene oxides.<br>
Hydrophilic Diluents<br>
Suitable hydrophilic diluents include alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol,<br>
polyols such as ethylene glycol and glycerine, ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone,<br>
and cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran. For applications involving plastic<br>
containers, care should be taken to avoid the use of hydrophilic diluents that might<br>
promote environmental stress cracking in plastic containers when evaluated using<br>
the PET Stress Crack Test set out below.<br>
Antimicrobial Agents<br>
Anti-microbial agents can also be added. Some useful anti-microbial agents<br>
include disinfectants, antiseptics, and preservatives. Some non-limiting examples<br>
include phenols including halo- and nitrophenols and substituted bisphenols such as<br>
4-hexylresorcinol, 2-benzyl-4-chlorophenol and 2,4,4 -trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenyl<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/IIS2006/023300<br><br>
ether, organic and inorganic acids and its esters and salts such as dehydroacetic acid,<br>
peroxycarboxylic acids, peroxyacetic acid, peroctanoic acid, methyl p-hydroxy<br>
benzoic acid, cationic agents such as quaternary ammonium compound,<br>
phosphonium compounds such as tetrakishydroxymethyl phosphonium sulphate<br>
(TUPS), aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde, antimicrobial dyes such as acridines,<br>
triphenylmethane dyes and quinines, halogens including iodine and chlorine<br>
compounds and oxidizers such as ozone, and hydrogen peroxide. The antimicrobial<br>
agents can be used in amounts to provide the desired antimicrobial properties. In<br>
some examples, the amount can range from 0 to about 20 wt.-% of the total<br>
composition.<br>
Stabilizing/Coupling Agents<br>
In a lubricant concentrate, stabilizing agents, or coupling agents can be employed to<br>
keep the concentrate homogeneous, for example, under cold temperature. Some of<br>
the ingredients may have the tendency to phase separate or form layers due to the<br>
high concentration. Many different types of compounds can be used as stabilizers.<br>
Examples are isopropyl alcohol, cthanol, urea, octane sulfonate, glycols such as<br>
hcxylene glycol, propylene glycol and the like. The stabilizing/coupling agents can<br>
be used in an amount to give desired results. This amount can range, for example,<br>
from about 0 to about 30 wt.-% of the total composition.<br>
Detergents/Dispersing Agents<br>
Detergents of dispersing agents may also be added. Some examples of<br>
detergents and dispersants include alkylbenzenesulfonic acid, alkylphenols,<br>
carboxylic acids, alkylphosphonic acids, and their calcium, sodium, and magnesium<br>
salts, polybutenylsuccinic acid derivatives, silicone surfactants, fluorosurfactants,<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
and molecules containing polar groups attached to an oil-solubilizing aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon chain.<br>
Some examples of suitable dispersing agents include triethanolamine,<br>
alkoxylated fatty alkyl monoamines and diamines such as coco bis (2-<br>
hydroxyethyl)amine, polyoxyethylene(5-)coco amine, polyoxyethylene(15)coco<br>
amine, tallow bis(-2hydroxyethyl)amine, polyoxyethylene(15)amine,<br>
polyoxyethy1ene(5)oleyl amine and the like.<br>
The detergent and/or dispersants can be used in an amount to give desired<br>
results. This amount can range, for example, from about 0 to about 30 wt.-% of the<br>
total composition.<br>
Anti-wear Agents<br>
Anti-wear agents can also be added. Some examples of anti-wear agents<br>
include zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates, tricresyl phosphate, and alkyl and aryl<br>
disulfides and polysulfides. The anti-wear and/or extreme pressure agents are used<br>
in amounts to give the desired results. This amount can range, for example, from 0<br>
to about 20 wt.-% of the total composition.<br>
Viscosity Modifiers<br>
Viscosity modifiers can also be used. Some examples of viscosity modifiers<br>
include pour-point depressants and viscosity improvers, such as polymethacrylates,<br>
polyisobutylenes polyacrylamides, polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylic acids, high<br>
molecular weight polyoxyethylenes, and polyalkyl styrenes. The modifiers can be<br>
used in amounts to provide the desired results. In some embodiments, the viscosity<br>
modifiers can range from 0 to about 30 wt.-% of the total composition.<br>

PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
Sequestrants<br>
In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, it is possible to include other<br>
chemicals in the lubricant concentrates. For example, where soft water is unavailable<br>
and hard water is used for the dilution of the lubricant concentrate, there is a<br>
tendency for the hardness cations, such as calcium, magnesium, and ferrous ions, to<br>
reduce the efficacy of the surfactants, and even form precipitates when coming into<br>
contact with ions such as sulfates, and carbonates. Sequestrants can be used to form<br>
complexes with the hardness ions. A sequestrant molecule may contain two or more<br>
donor atoms which are capable of forming coordinate bonds with a hardness ion.<br>
Sequestrants that possess three, four, or more donor atoms are called tridentate,<br>
tetradentate, or polydentate coordinators. Generally the compounds with the larger<br>
number of donor atoms are better sequestrants. The preferable sequestrant is<br>
ethylene diamine tetracetic acid (EDTA), such as Versene products which are<br>
Na2EDTA and Na4EDTA sold by Dow Chemicals. Some additional examples of<br>
other sequestrants include: iminodisuccinic acid sodium salt, trans-1,2-<br>
diaminocyclohexane tetracetic acid monohydrate, diethylene triamine pentacetic<br>
acid, sodium salt of nitrilotriacetic acid, pentasodium salt of N-hydroxyethylene<br>
diamine triacetic acid, trisodium salt of N,N-di(beta-hydroxyethyl)glycine, sodium<br>
salt of sodium glucoheptonate, and the like.<br>
Corrosion Inhibitors<br>
Useful corrosion inhibitors include polycarboxylic acids such as short chain<br>
carboxylic diacids, triacids, as well as phosphate esters and combinations thereof.<br>
Useful phosphate esters include alkyl phosphate esters, monoalkyl aryl phosphate<br>
esters, dialkyl aryl phosphate esters, trialkyl aryl phosphate esters, and mixtures<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
thereof such as Emphos PS 236 commercially available from Witco Chemical<br>
Company. Other useful corrosion inhibitors include the triazoles, such as<br>
bcnzotriazole, tolyltriazole and mercaptobenzothiazole, and in combinations with<br>
phosphonates such as 1-hydroxyethylidene-l, 1-diphosphonic acid, and surfactants<br>
such as oleic acid diethanolamide and sodium cocoamphohydroxy propyl sulfonate,<br>
and the like. Useful corrosion inhibitors include polycarboxylic acids such as<br>
dicarboxylic acids. The acids which are preferred include adipic, glutaric, succinic,<br>
and mixtures thereof. The most preferred is a mixture of adipic, glutaric and succinic<br>
acid, which is a raw material sold by BASF under the name SOKALANâ¢DCS.<br>
Preferred lubricant compositions may be foaming, that is, they may have a<br>
foam profile value greater than about 1.1 when measured using a Foam Profile Test.<br>
Conveyor lubricants that contain silicone and foam arc heretofore unknown.<br>
Lubricant compositions which exhibit foam profile values greater than about 1.1<br>
may be advantageous because they offer a visual indication of the presence of<br>
lubricant, because foam allows movement of lubricant to areas of the conveyor that<br>
are not wetted directly by nozzles, brushes, or other means of application, and<br>
because foam enhances contact of the lubricant composition with the package being<br>
conveyed. Lubricant compositions preferably have a foam profile value that is<br>
greater than about 1.1, more preferably greater than about 1.3, and most preferably<br>
greater than about 1.5, when evaluated using the Foam Profile Test described below.<br>
The lubricant compositions preferably create a coefficient of friction (COF)<br>
that is less than about 0.20, more preferably less than about 0.15, and most<br>
preferably less than about 0.12, when evaluated using the Short Track Conveyor<br>
Test described below.<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
A variety of kinds of conveyors and conveyor parts can be coated with the<br>
lubricant composition. Parts of the conveyor that support or guide or move the<br>
containers and thus are preferably coated with the lubricant composition include<br>
belts, chains, gates, chutes, sensors, and ramps having surfaces made of fabrics,<br>
metals, plastics, composites, or combinations of these materials.<br>
The lubricant composition can also be applied to a wide variety of containers<br>
including beverage containers; food containers; household or commercial cleaning<br>
product containers; and containers for oils, antifreeze or other industrial fluids. The<br>
containers can be made of a wide variety of materials including glasses; plastics<br>
(e.g., polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene; polystyrenes; polyesters<br>
such as PET and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN); polyamides, polycarbonates; and<br>
mixtures or copolymers thereof); metals (e.g., aluminum, tin or steel); papers (e.g.,<br>
untreated, treated, waxed or other coated papers); ceramics; and laminates or<br>
composites of two or more of these materials (e.g., laminates of PET, PEN or<br>
mixtures thereof with another plastic material). The containers can have a variety of<br>
sizes and forms, including cartons (e.g., waxed cartons or TETRAPACKâ¢ boxes),<br>
cans, bottles and the like. Although any desired portion of the container can be<br>
coated with the lubricant composition, the lubricant composition preferably is<br>
applied only to parts of the container that will come into contact with the conveyor<br>
or with other containers. For some such applications the lubricant composition<br>
preferably is applied to the conveyor rather than to the container.<br>
The lubricant composition can be a liquid or semi-solid at the time of<br>
application. Preferably the lubricant composition is a liquid having a viscosity that<br>
will permit it to be pumped and readily applied to a conveyor or containers, and that<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
will facilitate rapid film formation whether or not the conveyor is in motion. The<br>
lubricant composition can be formulated so that it exhibits shear thinning or other<br>
pseudo-plastic behavior, manifested by a higher viscosity (e.g., non-dripping<br>
behavior) when at rest, and a much lower viscosity when subjected to shear stresses<br>
such as those provided by pumping, spraying or brushing the lubricant composition.<br>
This behavior can be brought about by, for example, including appropriate types and<br>
amounts of thixotropic fillers (e.g., treated or untreated fumed silicas) or other<br>
rheology modifiers in the lubricant composition.<br>
Methods of Application<br>
The lubricant coating can be applied in a constant or intermittent fashion.<br>
Preferably, the lubricant coating is applied in an intermittent fashion in order to<br>
minimize the amount of applied lubricant composition. It has been discovered that<br>
the compositions of the present invention may be applied intermittently and<br>
maintain a low coefficient of friction in between applications, or avoid a condition<br>
known as "drying". Specifically, compositions of the present invention may be<br>
applied for a period of time and then not applied for at least 15 minutes, at least 30<br>
minutes, or at least 120 minutes or longer. The application period may be long<br>
enough to spread the composition over the conveyor belt (i.e. one revolution of the<br>
conveyor belt). During the application period, the actual application may be<br>
continuous, i.e. lubricant is applied to the entire conveyor, or intermittent, i.e.<br>
lubricant is applied in bands and the containers spread the lubricant around. The<br>
lubricant is preferably applied to the conveyor surface at a location that is not<br>
populated by packages or containers. For example, it is preferable to apply the<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2(107/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
lubricant spray upstream of the package or container flow or on the inverted<br>
conveyor surface moving underneath and upstream of the container or package.<br>
In some embodiments, the ratio of application time to non-application time<br>
may be 1:10,1:30,1:180, and 1:500 where the lubricant maintains a low coefficient<br>
of friction in between lubricant applications.<br>
In some embodiments, the lubricant maintains a coefficient of friction below<br>
about 0.2, below about 0.15, and below about 0.12.<br>
In some embodiments, a feedback loop may be used to determine when the<br>
coefficient of friction reaches an unacceptably high level. The feedback loop may<br>
trigger the lubricant composition to turn on for a period of time and then optionally<br>
turn the lubricant composition off when the coefficient of friction returns to an<br>
acceptable level.<br>
The lubricant coating thickness preferably is maintained at at least about<br>
0.0001 mm, more preferably about 0.001 to about 2 mm, and most preferably about<br>
0.005 to about 0.5 mm.<br>
Application of the lubricant composition can be carried out using any<br>
suitable technique including spraying, wiping, brushing, drip coating, roll coating,<br>
and other methods for application of a thin film.<br>
The lubricant compositions can if desired be evaluated using a Contact<br>
Angle Measurement Test, a Coating Test, a Short Track Conveyor Test, a Foam<br>
Profile Test, and a PET Stress Crack Test.<br>
Contact Angle Measurement Test<br>
For the present invention, the contact angle of lubricant use compositions<br>
was measured using an FTA 200 Dynamic Contact Angle Analyzer available from<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
First Ten Angstroms, Portsmouth, VA. A droplet of use composition was applied to<br>
Melincx 516 uncoated polyethylene terephthalate film using a 1 inch 22 gauge<br>
needle and the contact angle measured 10 seconds after applying the drop to the<br>
film. Melinex 516 film is a product of Dupont Teijin Films and is available in sheets<br>
from GE Polymershapes, Huntersville, NC.<br>
Coating Test<br>
A wet coating of lubricant composition was prepared by pipetting<br>
approximately 4 mL of lubricant composition onto an approximately 90 square inch<br>
sample of Melinex 516 uncoated polyethylene terephthalate film and spreading the<br>
puddle across the film surface by hand using a number 6 Mayer bar (available from<br>
RD Specialties, Webster NY). The thickness of the wet coating was approximately<br>
14 microns. The wet film was observed for wetting properties and defects in the wet<br>
coating including beading up and localized de-wetting. The coating was allowed to<br>
dry under ambient conditions and the properties of the dried film noted including<br>
contiguity and percent surface coverage.<br>
Short Track Conveyor Test<br>
A conveyor system employing a motor-driven 83 mm wide by 6.1 meter<br>
long<br>
RKXNORDâ¢ LF polyacetal thermoplastic conveyor belt was operated at a belt<br>
speed of 30.48 meters/minute. Four 20 ounce filled PET beverage bottles were<br>
lassoed and connected to a stationary strain gauge. The force exerted on the strain<br>
gauge during belt operation was recorded using a computer. A thin, even coat of the<br>
lubricant composition was applied to the surface of the belt using conventional<br>
lubricant spray nozzles which apply a total of 4 gallons of lubricant composition per<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/IJS2006/023300<br><br>
hour. The belt was allowed to run for 25 to 90 minutes during which time a<br>
consistently low drag force was observed. The coefficient of friction (COF) was<br>
calculated by dividing the drag force (F) by the weight of the four 20 ounce filled<br>
PUT beverage bottles (W): COF = F/W.<br>
Foam Profile Test<br>
According to this test, 200 mL of room temperature lubricant composition in<br>
a stoppered 500 mL glass graduated cylinder was inverted 10 times. Immediately<br>
after the tenth inversion, the total volume of liquid plus foam was recorded. The<br>
stoppered cylinder was allowed to remain stationary, and 60 seconds after the last<br>
inversion of the cylinder the total volume of liquid plus foam was recorded. The<br>
foam profile value is the ratio of the total volume of liquid plus foam at 60 seconds<br>
divided by the original volume.<br>
PET Stress Crack Test<br>
Compatibility of lubricant compositions with PET beverage bottles was<br>
determined by charging bottles with carbonated water, contacting with lubricant<br>
composition, storing at elevated temperatures and humidity for a period of 28 days,<br>
and counting the number of bottles that either burst or leaked through cracks in the<br>
base portion of the bottle. Standard twenty ounce "Global Swirl" bottles (available<br>
from Constar International) were charged successively with 658 g of chilled water at<br>
0 to 5 C, 10.6 g of citric acid, and 10.6 g of sodium bicarbonate. Immediately after<br>
addition of sodium bicarbonate, the charged bottle was capped, rinsed with<br>
deionized water and stored at ambient conditions (20 - 25 C) overnight. Twenty four<br>
bottles thus charged were dipped in lubricant working composition up to the seam<br>
which separates the base and sidewall portions of the bottle and swirled for<br>

approximately five seconds, then placed in a standard bus pan (part number<br>
4034039, available from Sysco, Houston TX) lined with a polyethylene bag.<br>
Additional lubricant working composition was poured into the bus pan around the<br>
bottles so that the total amount of lubricant composition in the pan (carried in on<br>
bottles and poured in separately) was equal to 132 g. The lubricant composition was<br>
not foamed for this test. For each lubricant tested, a total of four bus pans of 24<br>
bottles were used. Immediately after placing bottles and lubricant into bus pans, the<br>
bus pans were removed to a humidity chamber under conditions of 100 F and 85%<br>
relative humidity. Bins were checked on a daily basis and number of failed bottles<br>
(burst or leak of liquid through cracks in the bottle base) was recorded. At the end of<br>
28 days, the amount of crazing on the base region of bottles that did not fail during<br>

invention.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A<br>
(Deionized water with 100 ppm added alkalinity)<br>
A solution of deionized water containing 100 ppm alkalinity as CaCCh was<br>
prepared by dissolving 0.168 g of sodium bicarbonate in lOOOg of deionized water.<br>
The ratio of unneutralized acid equivalents to equivalents of base from the alkaline<br>

WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCI7US2006/023300<br><br>
water was 0 to 1.00. The wetting behavior of the solution was evaluated by the<br>
coating test described above. Upon coating, the solution beaded up immediately<br>
giving isolated drops which dried to give water spots which covered approximately<br>
5% of the film surface. The alkaline water solution was tested for PET compatibility<br>
as described above. After 28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85%<br>
relative humidity, 19 of 120 bottles had failed (16 %). The visual crazing score for<br>
the unfailed bottles in this test was 1.4.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE B<br>
(silicone plus water-miscible lubricant)<br>
A lubricant composition was prepared which contained 125 ppm Lambent<br>
E2140FG silicone emulsion, 7.5 ppm Pluronic F108 poly(ethylene oxide-propylene<br>
oxide) block copolymer, 5.0 ppm methyl paraben, and 168 ppm sodium bicarbonate<br>
(equivalent to 100 ppm alkalinity as CaCOs). The ratio of unneutralized acid<br>
equivalents to equivalents of base from the alkaline water was 0 to 1.00. The<br>
contact angle of the lubricant composition on PET film was determined to be 64<br>
degrees and the pH of the lubricant composition was 8.7. The wetting behavior of<br>
the lubricant composition was evaluated by the coating test described above. Upon<br>
coating, the composition beaded up immediately giving isolated drops which dried<br>
to give water spots which covered approximately 5% of the film surface. The<br>
silicone plus water-miscible lubricant composition was tested for PET compatibility<br>
whereupon after 28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative<br>
humidity, 9 of 48 bottles had failed (19%). What this comparative example shows is<br>
that addition of a composition of silicone plus water-miscible lubricant to alkaline<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
water does not cause a significant improvement in the proportion of failed bottles in<br>
the PET compatibility test relative to alkaline water alone.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE C<br>
(commercial silicone lubricant)<br>
A commercial lubricant composition was prepared which contained 2500<br>
ppm of Dicolube TPB (product of Johnson Diversey) and 168 ppm sodium<br>
bicarbonate (equivalent to 100 ppm alkalinity as CaC03). The ratio of unneutralized<br>
acid equivalents from the lubricant concentrate composition to equivalents of base<br>
from the alkaline water was 0 to 1.00. The contact angle of the lubricant<br>
composition on PET film was determined to be 72 degrees. The wetting behavior of<br>
the lubricant composition was evaluated by the coating test described above. Upon<br>
coating, the composition beaded up immediately giving isolated drops which dried<br>
to give water spots which covered less than 5% of the film surface. The commercial<br>
lubricant composition was tested for PET compatibility whereupon after 28 days of<br>
storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative humidity, 7 of 48 bottles had<br>
failed (15%). What this comparative example shows is that addition of a<br>
composition of a commercial silicone lubricant to alkaline water does not cause a<br>
significant improvement in the proportion of failed bottles in the PET compatibility<br>
test relative to alkaline water alone.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
(Silicone lubricant plus succinic acid/sodium succinate)<br>
A lubricant concentrate composition was prepared by adding 5 g Lambent E-<br>
2140FG, 7.9 g succinic acid, 2.7 g of a 50% solution of NaOH, and 1.7g of an 18%<br>
solution of Pluronic F-108 poly(ethylene oxide-propylene oxide) block copolymer to<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2007/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
82.7 g deionized water. A lubricant composition was prepared by diluting 1.0 g of<br>
the lubricant concentrate composition with 399 g of a solution of 168 ppm sodium<br>
bicarbonate in deionizcd water. The resulting lubricant composition contained 125<br>
ppm Lambent E2140FG silicone emulsion, 7.6 ppm Pluronic F108, 198 ppm<br>
succinic acid, 34 ppm sodium hydroxide, and 168 ppm sodium bicarbonate<br>
(equivalent to 100 ppm alkalinity as CaCOs). The ratio of unneutralized acid<br>
equivalents from the lubricant concentrate composition to equivalents of base from<br>
the alkaline water was 1.25 to 1.00. The pH of the lubricant composition was 4.23.<br>
The silicone lubricant composition was tested for PET compatibility whereupon<br>
after 28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative humidity, 8 of<br>
96 bottles had failed (8%). The crazing score for the unfailed bottles in this test was<br>
1.8. What this example shows is that including approximately 1.25 equivalents of<br>
unneutralized acid for every equivalent of alkalinity in lube dilution water is capable<br>
to reduce the failure rate of bottles in the PET compatibility test relative to a silicone<br>
plus watcr-miscible lubricant composition.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>

solution of Pluronic F-108 poly(ethylene oxide-propylene oxide) block copolymer to<br>
74.9 g deionizcd water. A lubricant composition was prepared by diluting 1.0 g of<br>

PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
glutaric acid, 54 ppm NaOH, and 168 ppm sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 100<br>
ppm alkalinity as CaC03). The ratio of unneutralized acid equivalents from the<br>
lubricant concentrate composition to equivalents of base from the alkaline water was<br>
2.00 to 1.00. The pH of the lubricant composition was 4.25. The silicone lubricant<br>
composition was tested for PET compatibility whereupon after 28 days of storage<br>
under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative humidity, 0 of 96 bottles had failed<br>
(0%). The crazing score for the unfailed bottles in this test was 2.3. What this<br>
example shows is that including approximately two equivalents of unneutralized<br>
acid for every equivalent of alkalinity in lube dilution water is capable to reduce the<br>
failure rate of bottles in the PET compatibility test relative to a silicone plus water-<br>
miscible lubricant composition.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
(Silicone lubricant plus citric acid/sodium citrate)<br>
A lubricant concentrate composition was prepared by adding 2.5 g Lambent<br>

18% solution of Pluronic F-108 poly(ethylene oxide-propylene oxide) block<br>
copolymer, and 2.85 g of 35% hydrogen peroxide solution to 74.9 g dcionized water.<br>
A lubricant composition was prepared by diluting 2.0 g of the lubricant concentrate<br>
composition with 398 g of a solution of 168 ppm sodium bicarbonate in deionized<br>
water. The resulting lubricant composition contained 125 ppm Lambent E-2140FG<br>
silicone emulsion, 353 ppm citric acid, 54 ppm NaOH, 7.6 ppm Pluronic F-108<br>
polyethylene oxide-propylene oxide) block copolymer, 50 ppm H202, and 168 ppm<br>
sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 100 ppm alkalinity as CaC03). The ratio of<br>
unneutralized acid equivalents from the lubricant concentrate composition to<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2(107/040678<br><br>
PCT/US2006/023300<br><br>
equivalents of base from the alkaline water was 2.08 to 1.00. The silicone lubricant<br>
composition was tested for PET compatibility as described above. After 28 days of<br>
storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative humidity, 0 of 96 bottles had<br>
failed (0%). The crazing score for the unfailed bottles in this test was 1.4. What this<br>
example shows is that including approximately two equivalents of unneutralized<br>
acid for every equivalent of alkalinity in lube dilution water is capable to reduce the<br>
failure rate of bottles in the PET compatibility test relative to a silicone plus water-<br>
mi scible lubricant composition.<br>
In a separate test, 20 g of the lubricant concentrate composition was diluted<br>
with 10 Kg of city water and the coefficient of friction using the Short Track<br>
Conveyor Test described above. The coefficient of friction between 4 20 ounce<br>
"Global Swirl" bottles andDelrin track was 0.13.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
(Silicone lubricant plus citric acid/sodium citrate plus alcohol ethoxylate wetting<br>
agent)<br>
A lubricant concentrate composition was prepared by adding 2.5g of Dow<br>
Corning HV-490 silicone emulsion, 7.0g citric acid, 2.1 g of a 50% solution of<br>
NaOH, 2.0 g of Tomadol 91-8 alcohol ethoxylate, and 2.85g of a 35% solution of<br>
H2O2 to 83.6 g deionized water. A lubricant composition was prepared by diluting<br>
1.0 g of the lubricant concentrate composition with 399 g of a solution of 168 ppm<br>
sodium bicarbonate in deionized water. The resulting lubricant composition<br>
contained 63 ppm Dow Corning HV-490 silicone emulsion, 175 ppm citric acid, 26<br>
ppm NaOH, 50 ppm Tomadol 91-8 alcohol ethoxylate, 25 ppm H202, and 168 ppm<br>

lubricant composition was 5.94. The contact angle of the lubricant composition on<br>
PKT film was determined to be 58 degrees. The wetting behavior of the lubricant<br>
composition was evaluated by the coating test described above. Upon coating, the<br>
composition beaded up immediately and dried to give spots which covered less than<br>
5% of the PET surface. The foam profile value for the composition measured as<br>
described above was 1.3. The silicone lubricant composition was tested for PET<br>
compatibility as described, except that 20 oz "Contour" bottles available from<br>
Southeastern Container Corp. (Enka, NC) were substituted for 20 ounce "Global<br>
Swirl" bottles. After 28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative<br>
humidity, 1 of 96 bottles had failed (1%). The crazing score for the unfailed bottles<br>
in this test was 3.4. What this example shows is that including approximately one<br>
equivalent of unneutralized acid for every equivalent of alkalinity in lube dilution<br>
water and decreasing the contact angle of the lubricant composition to less than<br>
about 60 degrees is capable to reduce the failure rate of bottles in the PET<br>
compatibility test relative to a silicone plus water-miscible lubricant composition. In<br>
a separate test, 20 g of the lubricant concentrate composition was diluted with 10 Kg<br>
of city water and the coefficient of friction using the Short Track Conveyor Test<br>

improvement in the proportion of failed bottles in the PET compatibility test relative<br>
to alkaline water alone.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE F<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
(silicone lubricant plus fatty amine plus alcohol ethoxylate wetting agent<br>

An acidified fatty amine solution was prepared by adding 29 g of glacial<br>
acetic acid and 80.0g of Duomeen OL (available from Akzo Nobel Surface<br>
Chemistry LLC, Chicago, IL) to 691 g of deionized water. A lubricant concentrate<br>

of Surfonic L 24-7 surfactant, 6.5 g of 88% lactic acid, and 2.5g of Lambent<br>
E2140FG silicone emulsion to 58.0 g of deionized water. A lubricant composition<br>
was prepared by adding 5.0 g of the lubricant concentrate composition to a solution<br>
of 0.168 g of sodium bicarbonate in lOOOg of deionized water. The lubricant<br>
composition contained 125 ppm Lambent E2140FG silicone emulsion, 125ppm of<br>
Duomeen OL, 400 ppm of Surfonic L 24-7, 286 ppm lactic acid, and 168 ppm<br>
sodium bicarbonate (equivalent to 100 ppm alkalinity as CaCOs). The ratio of<br>
unneutralized acid equivalents from the lubricant concentrate composition to<br>
equivalents of base from the alkaline water was 1.59 to 1.00. The contact angle of<br>
the lubricant composition on PET film was determined to be 39 degrees. The<br>
wetting behavior of the lubricant composition was evaluated by the coating test<br>
described above. Upon coating, the composition gave a film with approximately 30<br>

PET compatibility as described, except that 20 oz "Contour" bottles available from<br>
Southeastern Container Corp. (Enka, NC) were substituted for 20 ounce "Global<br>
Swirl" bottles. After 28 days of storage under conditions of 100 F and 85% relative<br>
humidity, 0 of 96 bottles had failed (0%). The visual crazing score for the unfailed<br>
bottles in this test was 7.6. What this example shows is that addition of a wetting<br>
agent comprising a mixture of acidified fatty amine and alcohol ethoxylate<br>
compounds and a stoichiometric amount of organic acid to a silicone lubricant<br>
composition causes an improvement in wetting of the composition to a PET surface<br>
and an improvement in the proportion of failed bottles in the PET compatibility test<br>
relative to a silicone plus water-miscible lubricant composition.<br>
