				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a supported platinum group metal catalyst, to a process for preparing it by controlled electroless deposition and to a process for hydrogenating inorganic and organic compounds using the catalyst, in particular for direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Supported platinum group metal catalysts are used in numerous chemical processes, in particular for hydrogenating inorganic and organic compounds, and have attained great technical significance there. An intensively investigated reaction is what is known as the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide starting from molecular oxygen and hydrogen. There are endeavors to discover catalysts having a high activity and selectivity for this reaction and other hydrogenations.<br>
US 6,168,775 describes noble metal catalysts for the direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis, A noble metal salt solution is mixed with the solution of an ionic control polymer, for example a polyacrylate, having a molar mass between 300 and 8000 dalton and reduced with hydrogen before or after impregnating a support with the solution. The catalysts obtained in this way are said to be notable for a fine distribution of the noble metal on the support and for preferential formation of crystals having 110 and/or 220 crystal surfaces on the surface.<br>
Many metals may be applied to supports by electroless deposition, also referred to as autocatalytic deposition. For example, EP-A-0 87 8 235 describes a process for preparing supported catalysts, in which a porous support is treated with a solution of a salt of the catalytically active metal and a reducing agent, and an electroless deposition of the catalytically active metal is achieved in this way.<br>
WO 00/59635 describes a process for preparing platinum group metal catalysts on metallic supports, in which the metal is deposited in the form of discrete particles. The deposition is effected from an aqueous medium in which the platinum group metal is present in complex form and has a pH of more than 4.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to further improve the activity and/or selectivity of the existing platinum group metal catalysts, so that the space-time yield of the reactions catalyzed by it may be increased. Furthermore, the platinum group<br><br>
metal should be firmly anchored to the support, so that a long on-stream time under mechanical stress can also be achieved.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a supported platinum group metal catalyst obtainable by controlled electroless deposition of at least one platinum group metal from a deposition solution which comprises<br>
i)  at least one homogeneously dissolved platinum group metal compound,<br>
ii) a reducing agent and<br>
iii)at least one control agent selected from isopolyacids and heteropolyacids of niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium or their salts.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for hydrogenating molecular inorganic or organic compounds, in which the compound to be hydrogenated is contacted with hydrogen in the presence of the catalyst according to the invention.<br>
It is thought that electroless deposition of the platinum group metal onto the support in the presence of a dissolved isopolyacid and/or heteropolyacid achieves a more homogeneous coating, i.e. a more uniform distribution of the noble metal particles and a more uniform particle size on the support, which leads to an improved activity and/or selectivity. The homogeneity of the coating may be investigated, for example, with the aid of scanning electron microscopy and/or X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (ESCA).<br>
The isopolyacid or heteropolyacid is derived from an element selected from niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium, preferably from molybdenum, tungsten and vanadium, more preferably from tungsten. Isopolyacids are inorganic polyacids which constitute the partial anhydrides of the orthoacids of these elements and only contain central atoms of one type. Examples thereof include heptamolybdic acid, hexatungstic acid, dodecatungstic acid, bivanadic acid, decavanadic acid, hexaniobic acid and hexatantalic acid. Heteropolyacids are inorganic polyacids which, in addition to these elements, comprise a further central atom, usually arsenic, iodine, phosphorus, selenium, silicon or tellurium. Examples of such heteropolyacids include 12-molybdophosphoric acid, 12-tungstophosphoric acid, 12-tungstosilicic acid and hexatungstoiodic acid. The iso- or heteropolyacids may be formed beforehand and added to the deposition solution or formed in situ in the deposition solution<br><br>
from suitable precursor compounds. The degree of condensation of the iso- and/or heteropolyacids is not critical. The degree of condensation which results at the pH of the deposition solution is suitable. Useful precursor compounds are monomeric oxoacids, for example the meso- or orthoacids, or oligomeric oxoacids, for example metaacids of the elements mentioned or their salts. Useful salts of the iso- and/or heteropolyacids or their precursor compounds are in particular the alkali metal salts, especially the sodium and potassium salts, or the ammonium salts.<br>
Examples of suitable precursor compounds include sodium tungstate, ammonium metavanadate, sodium molybdate and the like.<br>
The molar ratio of platinum group metal to iso- and/or heteropolyacid or precursor compound therefor in the deposition solution is preferably from 0.01 to 5.0, in partcular from 0.1 to 2.0, calculated as the molar ratio of platinum group metal atoms to niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten and/or vanadium atoms.<br>
For the purposes of the invention, platinum group metals are the noble metals of the 8th transition group of the Periodic Table which do not belong to the iron group, i.e. ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, palladium, osmium and platinum. Preference is given to ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and platinum, particular preference to palladium and platinum.

In general, at least one redox equivalent, based on the sum of the platinum group metals and added components (for example promoters/dopant components) of reducing agents is used. Preference is given to using the reducing agent in excess. Especially suitable is a molar ratio of reducing agent to platinum group metal of from 10:1 to 100:1 and more preferably from 20:1 to 60:1, for example about 30:1, about 40:1 or about 50:1.<br>
The deposition solution preferably has a pH of more than 6. This is preferably in the range from 7 to 14, in particular from 8 to 12. To this end, it may be necessary to add a base to the deposition solution, in order to attain the desired pH. Bases are any substances or compounds which are suitable for adjusting the pH of the aqueous medium to the desired value. In particular, the bases used are those which have complex-stabilizing properties, i.e. have at least partial Lewis base character. Preference is given to selecting the base among metal oxides, metal hydroxides, in particular alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, metal carbonates, in particular alkali metal and alkaline earth metal carbonates such as lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate, nitrogen bases, in particular ammonia, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, such as those described previously among the nitrogen-containing complex ligands. Likewise suitable are buffer systems, in particular those of the abovementioned bases, the salts of the abovementioned bases and/or suitable acids. Particularly preferred bases are ammonia and sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
The deposition solution is generally aqueous, i.e. it contains at least 10% by weight, preferably at least 30% by weight and in particular at least 50% by weight of water. The portion other than water is preferably selected from water-miscible solvents such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane.<br>
The supports used may be any catalyst support known to those skilled in the art, either metallic or nonmetallic. Suitable metallic supports are described, for example, in WO 00/59635,<br><br>
whose disclosure content is referred to. Nonmetallic supports are generally selected from mineral materials or plastics.<br>
In the present context, the term "mineral materials" quite generally encompasses nonmetallic inorganic materials such as natural and synthetic minerals, glasses, ceramics, etc. The mineral material used is preferably a glass. Preference is given to glasses composed of molten silicon dioxide or molten quartz, and also glasses based on alkali metal silicate, alkaline earth metal silicate, borosilicate, aluminosilicate and lead silicate. Further preferred support materials are borate, phosphate, germanate, chalcogenide and halide glasses, for example composed of beryllium fluoride.<br>
Preference is also given to the mineral material used as a support being selected from ceramic materials. Useful ceramic materials may be prepared from metal oxides, borides, nitrides and/or carbides. The ceramic materials used according to the invention may be glazed or unglazed, crystalline or semicrystalline. For the process according to the invention, preference is given to using ceramics made of base materials which are selected from aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, zirconium dioxide and mixtures thereof. Preference is further given to using ceramics which contain cations, as is the case, for example, in chelatite, steatite, cordierite, anorthite, mullite or pollucite. Preference is further given to ceramic composite materials.<br>
Nonmetallic supports generally have to be activated. "Activation" of the support refers to a procedure in which seeds are formed on the surface of the support which support the subsequent electroless deposition of the platinum group metal. The seeds generally consist of a metal, preferably a platinum group metal, in particular palladium. To activate it, the support is preferably treated with the solution of a sensitizer and then with the solution of a platinum group metal salt. Useful sensitizers are generally reducing agents, and particular preference is given to tin(II) compounds, in particular tin(II) chloride, and titanium(III) compounds, optionally in combination with other reducing agents. Other reducing agents advantageous as sensitizers include salts of hypophosphorous acid. The activation is described, for example, in EP-A-0 878 235, and reference is made to its disclosure content.<br><br>
The deposition is generally effected at a temperature in the range from 0 to 100°C, preferably in the range from 30 to 100°C and in particular in the range from 40 to 85°C.<br>
To deposit the platinum group metal, the support isr for example, contacted with the fully formulated deposition solution. Alternatively, the support may initially be contacted with a solution of the reducing agent and the control agent which optionally contains all or some of the optional constituents of the deposition solution. The platinum group metal and the remaining optional constituents are then added at the deposition temperature or a temperature, for example, up to 30°C lower. A further alternative is to contact the support with a solution of the platinum group metal compound and the control agent and then to add a solution of the reducing agent.<br>
In the process according to the invention, it has proven advantageous to ensure sufficient circulation of the deposition solution during the deposition of the platinum group metal on the support by, for example, pumping or stirring.<br>
The deposition solution is left in contact with the support sufficiently long to achieve electroless deposition of the platinum group metal on the support- The necessary reaction time is generally between 0.5 and 500 minutes, preferably 1 and 300 minutes and more preferably between 2 and 60 minutes. In general, more than 70% by weight, preferably more than 80% by weight and more preferably more than 90% by weight of the platinum group metals used is deposited on the support. The platinum group metal is generally so firmly bound to the support that it is not significantly removed by contact with liquids and gases when used in catalytic reactions. The elements on which the control agent is based are found on the catalyst only in negligible amounts.<br>
The catalysts according to the invention are suitable for the hydrogenation of organic and inorganic compounds, and in particular for organic compounds such as olefins, e.g. ethylene, propylene, acetylene and butadiene, carbonyl compounds, e.g. aldehydes and ketones, aromatics, e.g. benzene, and more preferably for hydrogenating oxygen for preparing hydrogen peroxide.<br>
The present invention further provides a process for preparing hydrogen peroxide by contacting the oxygen and the hydrogen in a liquid medium, preferably a substantially aqueous solution, with a catalyst according to the invention.<br><br>
Suitable reactors  for the synthesis of H2O2 are described, for example, in EP-A-068 862, EP-A-201 614 and EP-A-448 884. Particular preference is given to tubular reactors in which the catalyst according to the invention is present as a bed or in the form of cylindrically constructed catalyst units. Appropriate shaping for the support, as previously described, may ensure optimum flow conditions for gas and liquid.<br>
The liquid phase preferably trickles from top to bottom over the catalyst bed. The gas may be conducted in cocurrent or in countercurrent, preferably in cocurrent.<br>
Preference is given to feeding the hydrogen to the reactor via one or more intermediate feeds downstream of the metering point of the oxygen or the air. The superficial velocity of reaction gas and reaction medium is preferably in the range from about 20 to 7000 m/h, more preferably in the range from 50 to 1400 m/h.<br>
The reaction medium is preferably water and/or C1-C3-alkanols, in particular water and/or methanol. When the reaction medium used is water, up to 20% by weight of the alcohol, preferably methanol, may be added. When an alcoholic reaction medium is used, it may comprise 40% by weight, preferably up to 20% by weight and more preferably up to 5% by weight, of water. Very particular preference is given to using water as the sole reaction medium. To stabilize the hydrogen peroxide against decomposition, acids whose pKa is preferably less than that of acetic acid, in particular mineral acids such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or hydrochloric acid, are added to the reaction medium. The acid concentration is generally at least 10'4 mol/liter, preferably from 10~3 to 10-1 mol/liter. Traces of bromide or chloride in concentrations of from 1 to 1000 ppm, preferably from 5 to 700 ppm and more preferably from 50 to 600 ppm are generally also added. It is also possible, however, to use other stabilizers, for example formaldehyde.<br>
The reaction gas which, in addition to hydrogen and oxygen, may also comprise other inert gases such as nitrogen or noble gases generally has 02:H2 ratios in the range from 2:1 to 1000:1. Preference is given to using molar ratios in the range from 5:1 to 100:1, in particular 20:1 to 100:1. The oxygen used in the reaction gas may also be added to the reaction gas in the form of air.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the reaction gas is circulated. In this case, the molar ratio in the fresh gas mixture is in the region of stoichiometry, preferably in the range from 1.5:1 to<br><br>
0.5:1. The O2:H2 molar ratio in the cycle gas should be in the range from 5:1 to 1000:1, preferably in the range from 20:1 to 100:1. The reaction may be carried out at atmospheric pressure or else at elevated pressures of up 200 bar. The pressure is preferably from 10 to 100 bar, in particular from 10 to 80 bar. The reaction temperature may be in the range from 0 to 80°C, and preference is given to working in the range from 5 to 60°C and in particular from 25 to 55°C. Preference is given to selecting the partial pressures of the reaction gases in the reaction gas mixture in the reactor and also in the cycle gas in such a way that the hydrogen concentration under the reaction conditions is below the lower explosion limit.<br>
The process described allows hydrogen peroxide solutions having hydrogen contents of up to 2% by weight, preferably in the range from 3 to 25% by weight, to be prepared. The concentration may be preselected in the desired manner by adjusting the streams. Long-term investigations have shown that even after more than 40 days of operating time, very little reduction, if any, in the catalyst activity and selectivity is to be noted.<br>
In contrast to the catalysts known from the prior art, the catalysts prepared according to the invention have excellent catalyst properties. They are highly active and very selective in hydrogenation reactions. The process also achieves particularly good adhesion of the platinum group metal particles to the support, which is why the catalysts prepared according to the invention achieve particularly long on-stream times.<br>
The invention is illustrated in detail with the aid of the appended figure and the examples which follow.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the variation with time of the space-time yields for the direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis catalyzed by a catalyst according to the invention or a comparative catalyst.<br>
Preparation of the catalysts<br>
Example 1 (= comparative example, cat. Bl):<br>
1200 g of steatite support from Ceramtec in the form of spheres of 2 mm diameter were washed in succession with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, 25% sulfuric acid and distilled water. The spheres pretreated in this way were then activated on a suction filter by allowing a solution A {= 5 g/1 of SnCl2 + 10 ml/1 of cone, hydrochloric acid) to act for 3 min, then, after filtering off and washing with 0.5 1 of distilled water, allowing a<br><br>
solution B (= 0.2 g/1 of PdCl2 + 1 ml/1 of cone, hydrochloric acid) to act for 3 min. After renewed filtration and washing with water, the entire procedure was repeated and finally, the spheres were washed three times with 0.5 1 of distilled water each time.<br>
The spheres were installed damp in a glass tube and admixed with a solution C (= 70 g/1 of NH4C1, 23 g/1 of NH3 and 30 g/1 of sodium hypophosphite). This solution was pumped through the tube with the aid of a pump in such a way that the spheres only just moved and formed a fluidized bed. A reservoir which, at the same time, served as a gas separator was used to recycle the solution back to the entrance of the glass tube. The glass tube was also provided with a jacket which is filled with heating liquid. The temperature in the solution was brought to 40 +/- 0.5°C with circulation by pumping before the coating. 20 g of a solution D of 2.8 mg of hexachloroplatinic acid and 526 mg of sodium tetrachloropalladate in water were then added and the reaction initiated. After 1 hour, the reaction was complete. The solution was drained off and flushing was effected using water. The catalyst prepared in this way had a Pd content of 145 mg/kg, corresponding to a degree of deposition of 92%.<br>
Example 2 (- cat. B2):<br>
The catalyst preparation of Example 1 was repeated, with the difference that solution D additionally contains 405 mg of sodium tungstate.<br>
The properties of the catalysts were tested in the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
Example 3:<br>
A jacketed reactor having an internal diameter of 2.1 cm and a length of 2.00 m was charged with the catalyst Bl. At 40°C and 50 bar of pressure, a solution of 5 g/1 of phosphoric acid and 120 mg/1 of hydrogen bromide in water was allowed to trickle at a rate of 1.0 kg/h over the catalyst bed. At the same time, a mixture of 3% of hydrogen and 97% of oxygen was pumped with the aid of a gas compressor at a rate of 10 400 1 (STP)/hour from top to bottom in a cycle over the catalyst bed. The gas mixture is generated with the aid of two mass flow meters for hydrogen and oxygen. Its composition is determined and controlled with the aid of a thermal conductivity detector, over which a small bleed stream is passed as an offgas stream.<br><br>
The amount of hydrogen consumed by the reaction to give hydrogen peroxide and water was calculated from the mass streams of the gases introduced and the offgas stream.<br>
The product mixture leaving the reaction tube was separated from the gases in a separator while still under pressure and conveyed out of the plant in liquid form. A mass balance was conducted of the mass stream against the feed stream. The hydrogen peroxide content in the liquid effluents was determined by titration.<br>
The mass of the effluent stream, the content of hydrogen peroxide and the amount of hydrogen consumed were used to calculate the selectivity based on hydrogen. The space-time conversion (STC) is determined as the consumption of hydrogen in moles per unit time based on the volume of the catalyst bed.<br>
The space-time yield (STY) is determined from the amount of hydrogen peroxide formed per unit time based on the volume of 690 ml of catalyst bed in the tubular reactor. The results are summarized in the Table 1 which follows. The variation of the space-time yield with time is shown by Fig. 1.<br>
Example 4:<br>
Example 3 was repeated, with the different that catalyst B2 was used. This measure leads to a higher space-time yield owing to higher activity and a somewhat better selectivity (cf. Table 1 and Fig. 1). It can be seen that the STY for the catalyst according to the invention is always above the STY of the comparative catalyst.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>

wherein the deposition solution has a pH of from 8 to 12.<br>
5.	The catalyst according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the isopolyacid or heteropolyacid is formed in situ in the deposition solution from a monomeric or oligomeric oxoacid.<br>
6.	The catalyst according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the support has been activated before the deposition.<br>
7.	The catalyst according to claim 6, wherein the support has been treated to activate it with a solution of a sensitizer and then with the solution of a platinum group metal salt.<br><br>
8*.  The catalyst according to any of the preceding claims,<br>
wherein the support is selected from ceramic materials and glasses.<br>
9.	A process for preparing hydrogen peroxide by hydrogenating<br>
molecular oxygen, in which the molecular oxygen is contacted<br>
with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst according to any<br>
of claims 1 to 8.<br>
10.	The process according to claim 9, wherein the oxygen and the<br>
hydrogen are contacted with the catalyst in a liquid medium.<br>
11.	A process for preparing a catalyst according to any of claims<br>
1 to 8, in which at least one platinum group metal is<br>
deposited onto a support by electroless deposition from a<br>
deposition solution which comprises<br>
