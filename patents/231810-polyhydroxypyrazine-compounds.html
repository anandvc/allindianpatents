The medicaments according to the invention are composed of a product according to the invention or a combination of these products, in the pure state or in the form of a composition in which it is combined with any other pharmaceutically compatible product, which can be inert or physiologically active. The<br>
medicaments according to the invention can be employed orally, parenterally, rectally or topically.<br>
As solid compositions for oral<br>
administration, there can be used tablets, pills, powders (gelatin capsules, cachets) or granules. In these compositions, the active principle according to the invention is mixed with one or more inert diluents, such as starch, cellulose, sucrose, lactose or silica, under an argon stream. These compositions can also comprise substances other than the diluents, for example one or more lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc, a colorant, a coating (dragees) or a glaze.<br>
As liquid compositions for oral<br>
administration, there can be used pharmaceutically acceptable solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents, such as water, ethanol, glycerol, vegetable oils or liquid paraffin. These compositions can comprise substances other than the diluents, for example wetting, sweetening, thickening, flavouring or stabilizing products.<br>
The sterile compositions for parenteral administration can preferably be solutions in aqueous or nonaqueous form, suspensions or emulsions. As solvent or vehicle, there can be employed water, propylene glycol, a polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, in particular olive oil, injectable organic esters, for example ethyl oleate, or other suitable<br>
organic solvents. These compositions can also contain adjuvants, in particular wetting, isotonizing, emulsifying, dispersing and stabilizing agents. Sterilization can be performed in several ways, for example by aseptizing filtration, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the composition, by irradiation or by heating. They can also be prepared in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved at the time of use in sterile water or any other injectable sterile medium.<br>
The compositions for rectal administration are suppositories or rectal capsules which contain, in addition to the active product, excipients such as cocoa butter, semisynthetic glycerides or polyethylene glycols.<br>
The compositions for topical administration can be, for example, creams, lotions, collyria, collutoria, nose drops or aerosols.<br>
The doses depend on the desired effect, the duration of treatment and the administration route used; they are generally between 150 mg and 600 mg per day via the oral route for an adult with unit doses ranging from 50 mg to 200 mg of active substance.<br>
In general, the doctor will determine the appropriate dosage according to the age, weight and all other factors specific to the subject to be treated.<br>
The following Example 4 illustrates compositions according to the invention.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the products of general formula (I) in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions of use in the treatment and/or prevention of diabetes and complications of diabetes.<br>
The following examples illustrate more particularly and without implied limitation the preparation process used according to the invention. It is part of the general knowledge of a person skilled in the art to apply or adapt these methods in order to implement the invention. Example 1<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
0.328 cm3 of cyclohexanoyl chloride are added dropwise, at a temperature in the region of 20°C under an argon atmosphere, to 300 mg of 2-[(1R,2S,3R)(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybutyl)]-5-[ (2'S,3'R) (2',3',4'-trihydroxybutyl)]pyrazine in suspension in 7.5 cm3 of pyridine dried over 4A molecular sieve. The white reaction suspension is stirred for 15 hours at a temperature in the region of 20°C. The reaction medium is diluted with 30 cm3 of ethyl acetate and 30 cm3 of distilled water. After<br>

Example 3<br>
Swiss albino mice weighing between 22 and 26 g are left without nourishment for 2 hours. At the end of this period, the glycemia is measured and, immediately after, a dose of glucose (2 g/kg) is administered orally. Thirty minutes later, the glycemia<br>
is once again measured. The mice which respond by a hyperglycemia greater than 170 mg/dl are selected and used to detect the hypoglycemic activity of the products according to the invention.<br>
The mice thus chosen are divided into groups of at least 10 animals. Several groups receive doses of 3 to 50 mg/kg of product in a vehicle, such as water or a mixture of methylcellulose/tween and water, once daily by gastric intubation. The treatment lasts 4 days. On the 4th day, after the final treatment, the animals receive a dose of glucose (2 g/kg) and the glycemia is measured 20 to 40 minutes later. The percentage of inhibition of the hyperglycemic response to the administration of glucose is calculated with respect to the response measured in the group treated with the vehicle.<br>
In this test, the products according to the invention exhibit a percentage of inhibition of glycemia of greater than or equal to 10%.<br>

The medicaments according to the invention are composed of a product according to the invention or a combination of these products, in the pure state or in the form of a composition in which it is combined with any other pharmaceutically compatible product, which can be inert or physiologically active. The<br>
medicaments according to the invention can be employed orally, parenterally, rectally or topically.<br>
As solid compositions for oral<br>
administration, there can be used tablets, pills, powders (gelatin capsules, cachets) or granules. In these compositions, the active principle according to the invention is mixed with one or more inert diluents, such as starch, cellulose, sucrose, lactose or silica, under an argon stream. These compositions can also comprise substances other than the diluents, for example one or more lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc, a colorant, a coating (dragees) or a glaze.<br>
As liquid compositions for oral<br>
administration, there can be used pharmaceutically acceptable solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents, such as water, ethanol, glycerol, vegetable oils or liquid paraffin. These compositions can comprise substances other than the diluents, for example wetting, sweetening, thickening, flavouring or stabilizing products.<br>
The sterile compositions for parenteral administration can preferably be solutions in aqueous or nonaqueous form, suspensions or emulsions. As solvent or vehicle, there can be employed water, propylene glycol, a polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, in particular olive oil, injectable organic esters, for example ethyl oleate, or other suitable<br>
organic solvents. These compositions can also contain adjuvants, in particular wetting, isotonizing, emulsifying, dispersing and stabilizing agents. Sterilization can be performed in several ways, for example by aseptizing filtration, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the composition, by irradiation or by heating. They can also be prepared in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved at the time of use in sterile water or any other injectable sterile medium.<br>
The compositions for rectal administration are suppositories or rectal capsules which contain, in addition to the active product, excipients such as cocoa butter, semisynthetic glycerides or polyethylene glycols.<br>
The compositions for topical administration can be, for example, creams, lotions, collyria, collutoria, nose drops or aerosols.<br>
The doses depend on the desired effect, the duration of treatment and the administration route used; they are generally between 150 mg and 600 mg per day via the oral route for an adult with unit doses ranging from 50 mg to 200 mg of active substance.<br>
In general, the doctor will determine the appropriate dosage according to the age, weight and all other factors specific to the subject to be treated.<br>

2-[(lR,2S,3R) (1,2, 3, 4-Tetrahydroxybutyl)]-5-[(2'S,3'R) (2',3', 4'-trihydroxybutyl)Jpyrazine can be prepared from D-glucosamine in the presence of acetic acid or by application or adaptation of the methods described in Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academic Press, New York, Vol. 25, 1970, 311-349. Example 3<br>
Swiss albino mice weighing between 22 and 26 g are left without nourishment for 2 hours. At the end of this period, the glycemia is measured and, immediately after, a dose of glucose (2 g/kg) is administered orally. Thirty minutes later, the glycemia<br>
is once again measured. The mice which respond by a hyperglycemia greater than 170 mg/dl are selected and used to detect the hypoglycemic activity of the products according to the invention.<br>
The mice thus chosen are divided into groups of at least 10 animals. Several groups receive doses of 3 to 50 mg/kg of product in a vehicle, such as water or a mixture of methylcellulose/tween and water, once daily by gastric intubation. The treatment lasts 4 days. On the 4th day, after the final treatment, the animals receive a dose of glucose (2 g/kg) and the glycemia is measured 20 to 40 minutes later. The percentage of inhibition of the hyperglycemic response to the administration of glucose is calculated with respect to the response measured in the group treated with the vehicle.<br>
In this test, the products according to the invention exhibit a percentage of inhibition of glycemia of greater than or equal to 10%.<br>
A compartive test according to the protocol described above was carried out with the product of Example 1 according to the present invention and the reference product 2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybutyl)-5-(2',3',4'-trihydroxybutyl)]pyrazine, the antidiabetic activity of which was disclosed in Application WO 97/28813:<br>
