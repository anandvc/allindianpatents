PROVIDING AN ADVERTISEMENT TO A CALLING PARTY BEFORE RINGBACK<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
L Field of the Invention<br>
The invention is related to the field of communication networks and, in particular, to providing an advertisement to a calling party before providing ringback for the call to the calling party.<br>
2. Statement of the Problem<br>
When a calling party places a call to a called party, the sounds heard by the calling parly when waiting for the called party to answer the call is referred to as ringback tones. TTie communication network over which the call is placed provides the ringback tones to the calling party, which is typically.a ringing sound. A present trend of service providers is to offer customized ringback tones to its subscribers. Customized ringback tones may comprise music, songs, sound clips, audio messages, prerecorded greetings, etc, that the communication network plays as ringback tones instead of or in addition to the traditional ringing sound. Customized ringback tones may be associated with specific directory numbers of the calling party, such as viith phone lists or exclusion lists. The subscriber can also set conditions for when, for whom, or what is played for the ringback tones based on time, day of the week, the calling parly, etc. Customized ringback tones have generated high revenues for services providers.<br>
Emerging multimedia phones (e.g., wireless handsets, broadband wireline phone sets, SIP phones, etc) allow text, animated images, audio/video clips, etc, as multimedia ringback tones to the calling pafty. The subscriber can define selected images or video clips as multimedia ringback tones and store them in the communication network. If a calling parly calls the subscriber, the communication network plays back the selected image or video clip to the calling party based on the muhimedia ringback tone profile defined by the subscriber,<br>
A source of revenue generation for service providers is selling advertising targeted to its subscribers. One problem facing service providers is thus how to provide the advertising to the subscribers. One solution is to replace the traditional ringback for a call<br><br>
BATN] 22-4-40-10<br>
with a multimedia ringback tone that is an advertisement, histead of a calling party hearing<br>
I<br>
the traditional ringing sound when calling a business or an individual, the communication network may play a muhimedia advertisement to the calling party. Although using the multimedia ringback tone as the advertisement is useful, there may be some limitations. For instance, the advertisement may not be fully played to the calling party if the called party answers the call before the advertisement has been fully played. Thus, it may be desirable to provide advertisements to a calling party in a different manner.<br>
Summary of the Solution<br>
The invention provides advantages over prior communication networks and methods by providing an advertisement to a calling party before providing ringback tones for the call. In one embodiment of the invention, the communication network receives a call from the calling party to the called p^rty, and temporarily interrupts call processing for the call. The communication network then selects an advertisement for the call, and initiates delivery of the advertisement to the calling party. After the advertisement has been delivered to the calling party, the communication network resumes call processing for the call. In resuming call processing, the communication network provides ringback tones to the calling party and attempts to connect the call to the called party.<br>
Because call processing is temporarily interrupted, the communication network can provide the advertisement to the calling party in full. After the advertisement is delivered and call processing resumes, the ringback tones are provided to the calling party as the call is being set up. The advertisement is not interrupted by the called party answering the call, because call processing is temporarily interrupted and has not yet been extended to the called party. Temporarily interrupting call processing advantageously allows a service provider to ensure that complete advertisements are provided to calling parties.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a communication network comprising an advertising system and a network node. The network node is adapted to receive a call from a calling party to a called parly, and to interrupt call processing for the call. The network node is further adapted to transmit a message to the advertising system requesting an advertisement for the call. The advertising system is adapted to select an advertisement for the call, and to initiate delivery of the selected advertisement to the calling party. After the selected advertisement is delivered to the calling party, the network node is further adapted to resume call processing to allow the calling party to receive ringback tones for the call.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
FIGS. 1-8 and the following description depict specific exemplary embodiments of the invention to teach those skilled in the art how to make and use the invention. For the purpose of teaching inventive principles, some conventional aspects of the invention have been simplified or omitted. Those skilled in the art will appreciate variations from these embodiments that fall within the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will<br><br>
appreciate that the features described below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described below, but only by the claims and their equivalents.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a communication network 100 in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. Communication network 100 may comprise a wdreline network, such as a PSTN, or a wireless network, such as a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network, a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) network, a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) network, or a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) network. Communication network 100 may include a circuit-based core network, or a packet-based core network, such as an IP MuUimedia Subsystem (IMS) network. Communication network 100 is adapted to provide communications between calling party 112 (through communication device 110) and called party 122 (through communication device 120). Devices 110 and 120 comprise any communication devices, such as a wireline phone, a wireless (mobile) phone, a PDA, a VoIP phone, a SIP-based phone, etc.<br>
Communication network 100 includes a network node 102, a network node 104, and an advertising system 106. Network node 102 includes any switch, server, or other device that serves device 110 for a call. For instance, network node 102 may comprise a switch in a wireline network, a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) in a wireless network, or a Call Session Control Function (CSCF) in an IMS network. Similarly, network node 104 includes any switch, server, or other device that serves device 120 for a call.<br>
Advertising system 106 comprises any system, server, or device adapted to play, deliver, or otherwise provide an advertisement to calling party 112. An advertisement comprises any media or content adapted to draw attention to goods and/or services. The goods or services may be related to communication network 100 (or the service provider operating the communication network 100) or may be related to a third party that contracts with the service provider to provide the advertisement. The advertisement may be delivered to calling party 112 according to many different media types, such as text, audio, video, multimedia, etc. Advertising system 106 may also provide other types of informational messages that are not necessarily advertisements. For instance, the informational messages may be an announcement of an anniversary, an announcement of a party, an emergency message such as a weather alert or a traffic alert, etc.<br>
Advertising system 106 may comprise a single, independent server or system in communication network 100, such as an Intelligent Peripheral (IP) or an Application Server<br><br>
user profile (e.g., age, hobbies, etc) for calling party 112, based on a location of calling party 112, or based on other information on calling party 112. Advertising system 106 may select the advertisement based on an identity of called party 122, based on a user profile for called party 122, or based on other information on called party 122. Advertising system 106 may also select no advertisement to play for the call, which means that advertising system 106 is skipping the advertisement for a call.<br>
Advertising system 106 then initiates delivery of the selected advertisement to calling party 112 in step 208. The advertisement may comprise any type of media content, such as text^ audio, video, multimedia, etc. Advertising system 106 may initiate delivery of the advertisement in a variety of ways. For instance, advertising system 106 may store the content for the selected advertisement, and may deliver the advertisement to calling party 112 through network node 102. Alternatively, advertising system 106 may identify another content serv|er that stores the selected advertisement, and may provide network node 102. with a network identifier (e.g., URL or TLDN) for the content server. Network node 102 may then contact the content server, and the content server delivers the advertisement to calling party 112. Alternatively, advertising system 106 may transmit a network identifier to device 110 indicating the content server that is storing the advertisement. Device 110 may then automatically access the content server to dovmload the advertisement responsive to receiving the network identifier.<br>
After the advertisement is delivered to calling party 112, nelvs^ork node 102 resumes call processing for the call. A normal call flow may now take place to attempt to connect the call to called party 122. In FIG. 1, network node 102 routes the call to network node 104. Network node 104 then attempts to connect the call to device 120. Network node 104 also provides ringback tones (otherwise referred to as progress tones) to device 110 of calling party 112 in step 212. The ringback tones may be traditional ringing tones, multimedia ringback tones, another advertisement, or any other type of ringback. Network node 104 may contact a ringback tone server (not shown in FIG. 1) to provide the ringback tones to device 110. The ringback tones may comprise on-hook ringback tones or busy ringback tones depending on the status of called party 122 (on-hook or busy).<br>
If calling party 112 listens to or views an advertisement, then advertisement system 106 may credit awards points earned by calling party 112 for receiving the advertisement. Advertising system 106 may maintain an account for calling party 112 that is used to track<br><br>
BATNI 22-4-40-10<br>
award points earned by calling party 112. The award points may be redeemed by calling party 112 for discounts, gift purchases, etc.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, network node 104 may perform some or all of the functions performed by network node 102. For instance, network node 104 may monitor one or more triggers, and if a trigger is encountered, interrupt call processing and contact advertising system 106. If calling party 112 is a subscriber to the advertising service, then network node 102 that is serving device 110 of calling party 112 will probably provide the operation described for method 200. If called party 122 is a subscriber to the advertising service, then network node 104 that is serving device 120 of called party 122 will probably provide the operation described for method 200 instead of network node 102. The service provider may configure communication network 100 in different desired ways.<br>
Method 200 described above provides advantages over prior advertising services. Because call processing is temporarily interrupted, advertising system 106 can provide the advertisement to calling party 112 in full. After the advertisement is delivered and call processing resumes, the ringback tones are provided to calling party 112 as the call is being set up. The advertisement is not interrupted by called party 122 answering the call, because the call processing is temporarily interrupted and has not yet been extended to called party 122. Temporarily interrupting the call processing advantageously allows a service provider to ensure that a complete advertisement is provided to calling party 112.<br>
As stated in the preceding paragraphs, advertising system 106 may select an advertisement to play for the call based on different criteria. One exemplary criterion used to select an advertisement may be a user profile for calling party 112. A user profile comprises any data or information for calling party 112 that is used to select an advertisement. The user profile may include the age of calling party 112, the gender of calling party 112, services subscribed to by calling party 112, capabilities of device 110, bandwidth available to device 110, quality of service levels, particular interests of calling party 112 (such as a sports enthusiast, a comedy enthusiast, a music enthusiast, etc), or any other desired information. Advertising system 106 may process the user profile to select the advertisement to play for calling party 112.<br>
Another exemplary criterion used to select an advertisement may be a selection by calling party 112. One assumption for this criterion is that calling party 112 has subscribed to the advertising service. When signing up for the advertising service, calling party 112 may select one or more types or categories of advertisements to play. For instance, one<br><br>
BATNI 22-4-40-10<br>
106 may receive a directory number of calling party 112 if calling party 112 is a wireline (fixed-location) user. Advertising system 106 may then access a database that maps the NPA-NXXofthe directory number to a location in order to estimate the location of calling party 112.<br>
Calling party 112 may have the option of selecting whether the advertisements should relate to his/her home location or present location (e.g., roaming situation). An exemplary implementation of this concept is as follows. The user profile for calling party 112 includes a provisionable "Home or Current Location" flag that is associated with each category of advertisement. The flag indicates to advertising system 106 whether to provide calling party 112 with advertisements based on his/her home location or present location for each category. As an example, assume that calling party 112 selects the "home location" foracategory of advertisements "cars".   Further assume that calling party 112 selects the "present location" for a category of advertisements "food". When selecting an advertisement to provide to calling party 112, advertising system 106 checks the "Home or Current Location" flag to determine which location to use. As an example, if the category of advertisements selected is "cars", then advertising system 106 will select car advertisements related to the home location of calling party 112. If the category of advertisements selected is "food", then advertising system 106 will select food advertisements related to the present location of catling party 112, no matter whether calling party 112 is registered at home or is roaming.<br>
While the advertisement is being played to calling party 112 in any of the above embodiments, calling party 112 may interact with communication network 100 to invoke one or more features, such as by using feature codes, voice commands, etc. In one example, calling party 112 may provide input requesting that the present advertisement be skipped, such as by entering a particular feature code (e.g., *96) or by saying the word "skip". Responsive to receiving the input, advertising system 106 will skip the advertisement or stop playing the advertisement, and direct network node 102 to resume call processing. In another example, calling party 112 may provide input requesting additional information on the advertisement being played by entering a particular feature code (e.g., *97) or by saying the word "more". Responsive to receiving the input, advertising system 106 may transmit a text/muhimedia message, an email message, or another type of message to calling party 112 that includes the additional information requested by calling party 112.<br><br>
BATNI 22-4-40-10<br>
If calling party 112 skips the call as described in the preceding paragraph, then advertising system 106 may adjust any reward points that were already credited to calling party 112. For instance, when initiating delivery of the advertisement to calling party 112, advertising system 106may credit the award points to an account for calling party 112. If calling party 112 later provides input to skip the advertisement, then advertising system 106 may debit the previously credited reward points from the account for calling party 112.<br>
FIG.' 3 illustrates another communication network 300 in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. Communication network 300 comprises a wireless network in this embodiment that includes Wireless Intelligent Network (WIN) functionalities. Communication network 300 is adapted to provide communications between calling party 312 (through mobile device 310) and called party 322 (through mobile device 320). Communication network 300 includes a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 301 that serves mobile device 310 of calling party 312. MSC 301 is referred to as the serving-MSC (S-MSC). Communication network 300 also includes MSC 303 that serves mobile device 320 of called party 322. MSC 303 is referred to as the originating MSC (0-MSC).    S-MSC 301 and 0-MSC 303 are each connected to a circuit-switched bearer network referred to herein as PSTN 302. S-MSC 301 and 0-MSC 303 are also each connected to a signaling network referred to herein as the SS7 network 306. The bearer network and signaling network (the core network) may comprise a packet network in other embodiments, such as an IMS network. Communication network 300 also includes an HLR 308 that stores a user profile for calling party 312 or for called parly 322. Communication network 300 may include other networks, systems, or devices not shown in FIG. 3, such as a base station between S-MSC 301 and mobile device 310, and a base station between 0-MSC 303 and mobile device 320.<br>
Communication network 300 also includes an advertising system 360. Advertising system 360 .includes a tone server 362 and a selection server 364. Tone server 362 comprises ahy system or server'that handles network operations for advertising system 360. Selection server 364 comprises any system or server that selects an advertisement to play to acallingparty 312.<br>
For the following description, assume that calling party 312 has subscribed to an advertising service provided by the service provider operating communication network 300. The advertising service is a service that provides advertisements to a calling party before providing ringback for the call.<br><br>
BATNI22-4-40-10	11<br>
FIG. 4 is a message diagram illustrating an exemplary operation of communication network 300 to register a calling parly in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. To start, assume that mobile device 310 of calling party 312 turns on or moves into range of S-MSC 301. Mobile device 310 transmits a registration message to S-MSC 301. Responsive to receiving the registration message, S-MSC 301 transmits an ANSI-41 Registration Notification (REGNOT) message to HLR 308 (which is the HLR for calling party 312 in this embodiment) requesting profile information for calling party 312. The REGNOT message may include a location for mobile device 310, a TRANSCAP parameter, and a WINCAP parameter. The TRANSCAP parameter is set to indicate that S-MSC 301 can process a TRIGADDRLIST parameter. The WINCAP parameter is set to indicate the WIN capabilities of S-MSC 301,<br>
Responsive to receiving the REGNOT message, HLR 308 transmits a response message to S-MSC 301 in the form of a regnot message. The regnot message includes the TRIGADDRLIST parameter, which is set to indicate which of the WIN triggers are active. For instance, the TRIGADDRLIST parameter may indicate that the AllCalls trigger is active. The TRIGADDRLIST parameter also specifies routing to the network entity that should be contacted responsive to a triggering event. In this embodiment, the network entity that should be contacted is tone server 362, so the TRIGADDRLIST parameter includes a network identifier or a network address for tone server 362. Mobile device 310 is now registered with the advertising service offered by the service provider.<br>
FIG. 5 is a message diagram illustrating an exemplary operation of communication network 300 to provide an advertisement to calling party 312 in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the network node serving the calling party is the trigger for the advertising service. When the network node serving the calling party is the trigger, a calling party will hear an advertisement each time he/she places a call (unless the advertisement is skipped).<br>
When in operation, calling party 312 places a call through mobile device 310. S-MSC 301 receives the dialed digits for the call and initiates processing of the call. In processing the call, if S-MSC 301 encounters an active trigger (e.g., All_Calls trigger), then S-MSC 301 transmits an origination request (ORR.EQ) message to tone server 362. The ORREQ message includes call related parameters, such as the calling party directory number (MDN), the dialed digits (DGTSDIAL) for the call, the MSCID for S-MSC 301, and trigger type and WIN capabilities. Responsive to encountering the active trigger, S-<br><br>
BATNI 22-4-40-10<br>
0-MSC 303. Responsive to the lAM, 0-MSC 303 attempts to connect the call to mobile device 320. 0-MSC 303 also transmits ringback tones to mobile device 310 through S-MSC 301. The ringback tones may be traditional ringing tones, multimedia ringback tones, another advertisement, or any other type of ringback.<br>
FIG. 6 is a message diagram illustrating another exemplary operation of communication network 300 to provide an advertisement to calling party 312 in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. Like FIG. 5, S-MSC 301 in FIG. 6 receives dialed digits for a call and initiates processing of the call from mobile device 310 of calling party 312. In processing the call, if S-MSC 301 encounters an active trigger, then S-MSC 301 transmits an ORREQ message to tone server 362. Responsive to encountering the active trigger, S-MSC 301 suspends call processing on the call and waits for an orreq response from tone server 362 to proceed further with the call processing. S-MSC 301 also sets a Service Switching Function Timer (SSFT) responsive to interrupting call processing. The SSFT assures that there is a limit to how long call processing is interrupted, and may be generally referred to as an interrupt timer.<br>
FIG. 6 then proceeds as in FIG. 5 until tone server 362 plays the advertisement to mobile device 310. In addition to playing the advertisement, tone server 362 starts a Reset Timer (REST) to expire before the SSFT expires in S-MSC 301. Because the advertisement may play for five seconds, ten seconds, fifteen seconds, etc, the advertisement may play longer than the SSFT. Thus, if the REST in the tone server 362 expires, then tone server 362 transmits ResetTimer message (RESTTIMER) to S-MSC 301. Responsive to receiving the ResetTimer message, S-MSC 301 re-initializes the SSFT. Tone server 362 then again sets the REST and continues to transmit ResetTimer messages to S-MSC 301 if the REST expires. The rest of the flow at the termination of the advertisement follows the description provided in FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 7 is a message diagram illustrating an exemplary operation of communication network 300 to skip an advertisement in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. Calling party 312 places a call through mobile device 310. S-MSC 301 receives the dialed digits for the call and initiates processing of the call, hiprocessing the call, if S-MSC 301 encounters an active trigger (e.g., A!i_Calls trigger), then S-MSC 301 transmits an ORREQ message to tone server 362. Responsive to encountering the active trigger, S-MSC 301 also suspends call processing on the call and waits for an orreq response from tone server 362 to proceed further with the call processing.<br><br>
BATNI 22-4-40-10<br>
Tone server 362 receives the ORREQ message from S-MSC 301, and invokes the advertising service using Ihe parameters received in the ORREQ message. Because calling party 312 has been provisioned intone server 362 for the advertising service, tone server 362 transmits a request message to selection server 364 requesting details of the advertisement to play for the call (if any). Selection server 364 may maintain a list of dialed digits for which the advertisement will be skipped for calling party 312. For instance, calling party 312 may not want to receive advertisements for calls home, for calls to a child's cell phone, etc. Selection server 364 may also or alternatively process other criteria to determine whether or not to play an advertisement for the call. In this embodiment, selection server 364 determines that an advertisement is not to be played for this call, so transmits a response message to tone server 362 indicating that no advertisement is to be played.<br>
Responsive to receiving the response message, tone server 362 transmits an orreq message with Null parameters to S-MSC 301. Responsive to the orreq message, S-MSC 301 resumes processing the call to called party 322 by transmitting an 1AM for the call to 0-MSC 303. Responsive to the lAM, 0-MSC 303 attempts to connect the call to mobile device 320. 0-MSC 303 also transmits ringback tones to mobile device 310 through S-MSC 301. Any request/response messaging scheme using a suitable protocol, such as TCP/IP, can be used for the communications between tone server 362 and selection server 364 in FIGS. 5-7.<br>
In FIGS. 4-7, S-MSC 301 is the network node that triggers the advertising service. 0-MSC 303 may also or alternatively be the network node that triggers the advertising service, which is illustrated in FIG. 8, When the called party subscribes to the service, the network node serving the called party is the trigger. In this case, a calling party will hear an advertisement when placing a call to specific called parties. For instance, if the calling party places a call to a department store, then the calling party will hear an advertisement before ringback tones.<br>
FIG. 8 is a message diagram illustrating an exemplary operation of commimication network 300 to provide an advertisement to calling party 312 in an exemplary embodiment of the invention. Calling party 312 places a call through mobile device 310. S-MSC 301 receives the dialed digits for the call and initiates processing of the call. In processing the call, S-MSC 301 routes the call to 0-MSC 303, which also initiates termination processing of the call. 0-MSC 303 transmits a location request (LOCREQ) message to HLR 308<br><br>
BATNI 22-4-40-10<br>
(which is the HLR for the called party in this embodiment). The LOCREQ message includes call related parameters, such as the dialed digits (DGTSDIAL) for the call, the trigger type, and WIN capabilities. HLR 308 determines that the subscriber desires all terminations to be triggered to an SCP by processing a user profile for called party 322, and responds to 0-MSC 303 with a location request response (locreq) message that includes the Trigger Address list containing the list of SCPs to engage, and their associated addresses.<br>
During fiirther processing of the call, as the 0-MSC 303 encounters an active trigger (e.g.. Advanced Termination trigger), then 0-MSC 303 transmits an Analyzed Information (ANLYZD) message to tone server 362. Responsive to encountering the active trigger, O-MSC 303 also suspends call processing on the call and waits for an Analyzed Information response (anlyzd) message from tone server 362 to proceed further with the call processing.<br>
Tone server 362 receives the ANLYZD message from 0-MSC 303, and invokes the advertising service using the parameters received in the ANLYZD message. Because calling party 312 has been provisioned intone server 362 for the advertising service, tone server 362 transmits a request message to selection server 364 requesting details of the advertisement to play for the call (if any). Tone server 362 includes the calling party directory number, MSCID, called party directory number, and other available information in the request message to selection server 364.<br>
Selection server 364 applies its logic to the user profile for calling party 312 to deteninine whether or not to play an advertisement for the call. If a decision is made to play an advertisement, then selection server 364 also selects an advertisement to play. Selection server 364 may select the advertisement based on different criteria, some of which were described in previous embodiments. After selecting the advertisement to play, selection server 364 transmits a response message to tone server 362. The response message includes an identifier for the selected advertisement.<br>
Responsive to receiving the advertisement identifier, tone server 362 transmits a Connect Resource (CONNRES) message to 0-MSC 303. A TLDN parameter of the CONNRES'message includes a directory number for tone server 362, Responsive to receiving the CONNRES message, 0-MSC 303 transmits an lAM to tone server 362 to establish a (temporary) call leg to the directory number indicated in the TLDN parameter of the CONNRES message. 0-MSC 303 thus establishes a temporary call leg to tone server 362 based on the directory number.<br><br>
BATNI 22-4-40-10<br>
With the call leg established, tone server 362 plays the selected advertisement to 0-MSC 303 over the bearer channel that has been set up. 0-MSC 303 then plays the selected advertisement to S-MSC 301, which provides the advertisement to calling party 312.<br>
Upon completion of the advertisement, tone server 362 transmits an anlyzd message with Null parameters to 0-MSC 303. Responsive to the anlyzd message, 0-MSC 303 transmits a Release (REL) message to tone server 362 to tear down the (temporary) call leg. Tone server 362 responds with an ISUP Release Complete (RLC) message. 0-MSC 303 then resumes processing the call to called party 322 by attempting to connect the call to mobile device 320. 0-MSC 303 also transmits ringback tones to mobile device 310 through S-MSC 301. The ringback tones may be traditional ringing tones, multimedia ringback tones, another advertisement, or any other type of ringback.<br>
Though not included herein, a message diagram analogous to FIG. 7 can be drawn showing how selection server 364 of FIG. 8 can skip adds for a particular call.<br>
