				<td>A METHOD FOR CAUSING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN<br>
A LINE CARD AND AN ACCELERATOR CARD IN<br>
A DATA AND VOICE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
This invention relates to a method for causing communication between a line card<br>
and an accelerator card in a data and voice communication system.<br>
In a communications system, devices or subsystems may communicate via<br>
different methods. For example, a first pair of subsystems may be configured to<br>
communicate back and forth in time division multiplex (TDM) mode and another pair of<br>
subsystems may be configured to communicate back and forth using packet data. In a<br>
typical wireless communication system, simple circuit connections or packet-data<br>
transport provide limited value in a next generation network.<br>
Although the particular application may vary, the components of a wireless<br>
communication system are generally similar, as described in more detail below. For<br>
example, a wireless communication system usually includes a radio terminal or mobile<br>
station, a radio base station, a switch or network control device, often referred to as a<br>
mobile telephone switching office (MTSO), and a network to which the wireless<br>
communications system provides access, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network<br>
(PSTN).<br>
The various wireless communication applications use any of multiple modulation<br>
techniques for transmitting information to efficiently utilize the available frequency<br>
spectrum. For example, frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division<br>
multiple access (TDMA), and code division multiple access modulation techniques are<br>
used to build high-capacity multiple access systems. Telecommunication systems<br>
designed to communicate with many mobile stations occupying a common radio<br>
spectrum are referred to as multiple access systems.<br>
For example, in an FDMA analog cellular system, such as an AMPS analog<br>
cellular radio system, the available frequency spectrum is divided into a large number of<br>
radio channels, e.g., pairs of transmit and receive carrier frequencies, each of which<br>
corresponds to a message transmission channel. The bandwidth of each transmit and<br>
receive frequency channel is narrowband, generally 25-30 kHz. Thus, the FDMA system<br>
permits information to be transmitted in a bandwidth comparable to the bandwidth of the<br>
transmitted information, such as a voice signal. The cellular service area in the FDMA<br>
system is generally divided into multiple cells, each cell having a set of frequency<br>
channels selected so as to help reduce co-channel interference between cells.<br>
Frequency division is often combined with time division so that transmission<br>
circuits are distinguished in both the frequency and time domain, e.g., in a FD/TDMA<br>
system. In a digital FD/TDMA (commonly referred to as TDMA) cellular system, a<br>
narrowband frequency channel is reformatted as a digital transmission path which is<br>
divided into a number of time slots. The data signals from different calls are interleaved<br>
into assigned time slots and sent out with a correspondingly higher bit rate, the time slot<br>
assigned to each mobile station being periodically repeated. Although the TDMA<br>
bandwidth may be somewhat larger than the FDMA bandwidth, a bandwidth of<br>
approximately 30 kHz is generally used for AMPS-D digital TDMA cellular systems.<br>
Another approach to cellular multiple access modulation is CDMA. CDMA is a<br>
spread spectrum technique for transmitting information over a wireless communication<br>
system in which the bandwidth occupied by the transmitted signal is significantly greater<br>
than the bandwidth required by the baseband information signal (e.g., the voice signal).<br>
Thus, CDMA modulation spectrally spreads a narrowband information signal over a<br>
broad bandwidth by multiplex modulation, using a codeword to identify various signals<br>
sharing the same frequency channel. Recognition of the transmitted signal takes place by<br>
selecting the spectrally-coded signals using the appropriate codeword. In contrast to the<br>
narrowband channels of approximately 30 kHz used in FDMA and TDMA modulation<br>
techniques, a CDMA system generally employs a bandwidth of approximately 1.25 MHz<br>
or greater.<br>
Typically, the mobile communication systems described above are arranged<br>
hierarchically such that a geographical "coverage area" is partitioned into a number of<br>
smaller geographical areas called "cells." Referring to Fig. 1, each cell is preferably<br>
served by a Base Transceiver Station ("BTS") 102a. Several BTS 102a-n are centrally<br>
administered via fixed links 104a-n by a Base Station Controller ("BSC") 106a. The<br>
BTSs and BSC are sometimes collectively referred to as the Base Station Subsystem<br>
("BS") 107. Several BSCs 106b-n may be centrally administered by a Mobile Switching<br>
Center ("MSC") 110 via fixed links 108a-n.<br>
MSC 110 acts as a local switching exchange (with additional features to handle<br>
mobility management requirements, discussed below) and communicates with the phone<br>
network ("PSTN") 120 through trunk groups. U.S. mobile networks include a home<br>
MSC and a serving MSC. The home MSC is the MSC corresponding to the exchange<br>
associated with a Mobile Subscriber (also referred to above as a mobile station or "MS")<br>
114; this association is based on the phone number, such as the area code, of the MS.<br>
Examples of an MS include a hand-held device such as a mobile phone, a PDA, a 2-way<br>
pager, or a laptop computer, or Mobile Unit Equipment, such as a mobile unit attached to<br>
a refrigerator van or a rail car, a container, or a trailer.<br>
The home MSC is responsible for a Home Location Register ("HLR") 118<br>
discussed below. The serving MSC, on the other hand, is the exchange used to connect<br>
the MS call to the PSTN. Consequently, sometimes the home MSC and serving MSC<br>
functions are served by the same entity, but other times they are not (such as when the<br>
MS is roaming). Typically, a Visiting Location Register ("VLR") 116 is co-located with<br>
the MSC 110 and a logically singular HLR is used in the mobile network (a logically<br>
singular HLR may be physically distributed but is treated as a single entity). As will be<br>
explained below, the HLR and VLR are used for storing subscriber information and<br>
profiles.<br>
Radio channels 112 are associated with the entire coverage area. As described<br>
above, the radio channels are partitioned into groups of channels allocated to individual<br>
cells. The channels are used to carry signaling information to establish call connections<br>
and related arrangements, and to carry voice or data information once a call connection is<br>
established.<br>
Mobile network signaling has at least two significant aspects. One aspect<br>
involves the signaling between an MS and the rest of the network. In the case of 2G<br>
("2G" is the industry term used for "second generation") and later technology, this<br>
signaling concerns access methods used by the MS (such as TDMA or CDMA),<br>
pertaining to, for example, assignment of radio channels and authentication. A second<br>
aspect involves the signaling among the various entities in the mobile network, such as<br>
the signaling among the MSCs, BSCs, VLRs, and HLRs. This second part is sometimes<br>
referred to as the Mobile Application Part ("MAF") especially when used in the context<br>
of Signaling System No. 7 ("SS7"). SS7 is a common channel signaling system by which<br>
elements of the telephone network exchange information, in the form of messages.<br>
The various forms of signaling (as well as the data and voice communication) are<br>
transmitted and received in accordance with various standards. For example, the<br>
Electronics Industries Association ("EIA") and Telecommunications Industry Association<br>
("TIA") help define many U.S. standards, such as IS-41, which is a MAP standard.<br>
Analogously, the CCITT and ITU help define international standards, such as GSM-<br>
MAP, which is an international MAP standard. Information about these standards is well<br>
known and may be found from the relevant organizing bodies as well as in the literature,<br>
see, e.g., Bosse, SIGNALING IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS (Wiley<br>
1998).<br>
To deliver a call from an MS 114, a user dials the number and presses "send" on a<br>
cell phone or other MS. The MS 114 sends the dialed number indicating the service<br>
requested to the MSC 110 via the BS 107. The MSC 110 checks with an associated VLR<br>
116 (described below) to determine whether the MS 114 is allowed the requested service.<br>
The serving MSC routes the call to the local exchange of the dialed user on the PSTN<br>
120. The local exchange alerts the called user terminal, and an answer back signal is<br>
routed back to the MS 114 through the serving MSC 110 which then completes the<br>
speech path to the MS. Once the setup is completed the call may proceed.<br>
To deliver a call to an MS 114, (assuming that the call originates from the PSTN<br>
120) the PSTN user dials the MS"s associated phone number. At least according to U.S.<br>
standards, the PSTN 120 routes the call to the MS"s home MSC (which may or may not<br>
be the MSC serving the MS). The MSC then interrogates the HLR 118 to determine<br>
which MSC is currently serving the MS. This also acts to inform the serving MSC that a<br>
call is forthcoming. The home MSC then routes the call to the serving MSC. The serving<br>
MSC pages the MS via the appropriate BS. The MS responds and the appropriate<br>
signaling links are set up.<br>
During a call, the BS 107 and MS 114 may cooperate to change channels or BTSs<br>
102, if needed, for example, because of signal conditions. These changes are known as<br>
"handoffs," and they involve their own types of known messages and signaling.<br>
Fig. 2 shows in more detail the signaling and user traffic interfaces between a BS<br>
107 and an MSC 110 in a CDMA mobile network. The BS 107 communicates signaling<br>
information using an SS7-based interface for controlling voice and data circuits known as<br>
the "A1" interface. An interface known as "A2" carries user traffic (such as voice signals)<br>
between the switch component 204 of the MSC and the BS 107. An interface known as<br>
"A5" is used to provide a path for user traffic for circuit-switched data calls (as opposed<br>
to voice calls) between the source BS and the MSC. Information about one or more of<br>
Al, A2, A5 may be found in CDMA Internetworking - Deploying the Open-A Interface,<br>
Su-Lin Low, Ron Schneider, Prentice Hall, 2000, ISBN 0-13-088922-9.<br>
Mobile communications providers are supplying newer services, e.g., "data calls"<br>
to the Internet. For at least some of these services, MSCs are not cost effective because<br>
they were primarily designed for voice calls. Integration of new services into the MSC is<br>
difficult or infeasible because of the proprietary and closed designs used by many MSC<br>
software architectures. That is, the software logic necessary to provide the services is not<br>
easy to add to the MSC 110. Often, a switch adjunct is used to provide such services.<br>
For example, an Inter-Working Function ("IWF") is an adjunct to route a data call to the<br>
Internet Either approach - integrating functionality into the MSC or adding a trunk-side<br>
adjunct - involves the MSC in the delivery of service. Integrating new services via<br>
MSC design changes or through trunk-side adjuncts can increase network congestion at<br>
the MSC and consume costly MSC resources.<br>
Data calls typically make use of the Internet, which is an example of a packet-<br>
switching medium. A packet-switching medium operates as follows. A sequence of data<br>
is to be sent from one host to another over a network. The data sequence is segmented<br>
into one or more packets, each with a header containing control information, and each<br>
packet is routed through the network. A common type of packet switching is datagram<br>
service, which offers little or no guarantees with respect to delivery. Packets that may<br>
belong together logically at a higher level are not associated with each other at the<br>
network level. A packet may arrive at the receiver before another packet sent earlier by<br>
the sender, may arrive in a damaged state (in which case it may be discarded), may be<br>
delayed arbitrarily (notwithstanding an expiration mechanism that may cause it to be<br>
discarded), may be duplicated, and may be lost.<br>
At least one wireless Internet system has been proposed that provides reliable<br>
access to tens of megahertz of bandwidth across a wide geographic area, using local<br>
wireless transceiver technology (e.g., in a nanocell system). In contrast to the cellular<br>
wireless voice system, which relies on tens or hundreds of cells in a region, the local<br>
wireless transceiver system relies on thousands or tens of thousands of transceivers in the<br>
region. In such a system, each transceiver may cover, e.g., 0.05 square kilometers, which<br>
is about one-hundredth the coverage of a conventional cell. High spatial reuse of the<br>
radio frequency (RF) spectrum allows the local wireless transceiver system to<br>
accommodate many more active devices at a given data rate than a conventional cell<br>
system. In addition, since users are closer to access points, the local wireless transceiver<br>
system accommodates lower-power transmissions. The local wireless transceiver system<br>
can support large numbers of devices, running at high speeds, with relatively little drain<br>
on the devices" batteries.<br>
For example, in a citywide local wireless transceiver system network of 10,000<br>
transceiver access points (cell centers), if each point provides its users with 1-Mb/s<br>
collective throughput, 10 active devices per transceiver can be supported at 100 kb/s each,<br>
which amounts to 100,000 active devices in the city. If each device is active 10 percent<br>
of the time, such a network can support a million devices, although some accounting<br>
would need to be made for bandwidth consumed by overhead for channel access,<br>
handoffs, and any provision for asymmetric traffic (e.g., in which more bits flow toward a<br>
device than from it).<br>
Each local wireless transceiver system access point may be or resemble access<br>
points for wireless local area network (LAN) technology such as EEEE 802.11. An<br>
asynchronous digital subscriber line (ADSL), or a cable modem line may be used to<br>
provide a link between each access point and the Internet (a wireless link may be used as<br>
well or instead). With respect to the siting of access devices, since each device requires<br>
 electrical power and is preferably elevated for adequate radio frequency coverage, sites on<br>
utility poles and buildings are typical candidates, with the high-speed neighborhood<br>
Internet access infrastructure serving as a backbone.<br>
Summary<br>
In an aspect of the invention, a data and voice communication system includes<br>
communication between a line card and an accelerator card. Voice, data, and control<br>
traffic is received from the line card and is transmitted to the accelerator card via a<br>
physical link having separate voice, data, and control logical channels. The separate<br>
voice, data, and control logical channels are represented by labeled data packets.<br>
Implementations of the invention may provide one or more of the following<br>
advantages. Communication can be provided between devices with incompatible bus<br>
interfaces on physically separate cards. TDM, Asynchronous Transfer mode (ATM), IP<br>
packet, and control data can be transmitted simultaneously or effectively simultaneously<br>
on logical separate channels within a link. Per logical channel flow control can be<br>
provided to independently control transfer of data over logical channels without causing<br>
head of line blocking. Round robin and strict priority servicing of channels can be<br>
provided, which can enable low latency traffic to be transferred with low jitter. One card<br>
(e.g., accelerator card) may communicate voice, data, and control traffic with multiple<br>
other cards (e.g., line cards). Redundant links used in conjunction with other resources<br>
can allow any combination of l:n redundancy, depending on the implementation. A host<br>
CPU interface bus can be extended to access peripheral devices on another card using the<br>
control logical channel. Control plane and data plane migration can be facilitated during a<br>
redundancy switchover. Errors on redundant links or idling active links can be actively<br>
monitored and reported. Load sharing can be supported over multiple active links with an<br>
option to selectively steer traffic from one link to another link in case of one link failure.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for causing<br>
communication between a line card and an accelerator card in a data and voice<br>
communication system, the method comprising the steps of: receiving voice, data,<br>
and control traffic from the line card; and transmitting the voice, data, and control<br>
traffic to the accelerator card via a physical link having separate voice, data and<br>
control logical channels, the separate voice, data, and control logical channels<br>
being represented by labeled data packets.<br>
A particular embodiment of the method according to the present invention<br>
involves the steps of: receiving time division multiplex (TDM) data from a first line<br>
card; receiving packet data from a second line card; formatting the TDM data and<br>
the packet data in accordance with a packet-based protocol to produce formatted<br>
TDM and packet data; and communicating the formatted TDM and packet data to<br>
the accelerator card.<br>
Other advantages and features will become apparent from the following<br>
description, including the drawings, and from the claims.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
A communications system provides communications features including features<br>
relying on different types of data. The communications system has an Internet media<br>
gateway mechanism ("IMG") and a Softswitch mechanism as described below. Fig. 3A<br>
illustrates an example system 400 having an IMG 410A connected between BSC 415A<br>
and MSC 420A and communicating with a Softswitch 425 A. IMG 410A communicates<br>
with BSC 415A by A1, A2, and A5 interfaces. As described below, Softswitch 425A<br>
coordinates pathway setup and communication between BSC 415A and MSC 420A<br>
through IMG 410A. IMG 410A also communicates with the Internet 430, through which<br>
IMG 410A is able to direct messages to a mail server 440, as described below. Other<br>
IMGs and Softswitches may be provided similarly in connection with other BSCs and<br>
MSCs as exemplified in Fig. 3A by IMG 410B, Softswitch 425B, BSC 415B, and MSC<br>
420B. MSCs 420A, 420B are connected to, and can communicate with each other<br>
through, PSTN 460. SoftSwitches 425A, 425B are connected to, and can communicate<br>
with each other through, SS7 system 470. (Fig. 3B illustrates an alternative arrangement<br>
402 in which MSC 420A is connected between IMG 410A and BSC 415A, and MSC<br>
420B is connected between IMG 410B and BSC 415B.)<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a system 1010 that can support and help to provide voice and data<br>
services on one or more mobile wireless networks. In a particular implementation,<br>
system 1010 may include Starent Networks Corporation"s ST-16 IMG product, which is a<br>
carrier class, high performance platform that can support multiple data types including<br>
time division multiplexed (TDM) data, Asynchronous Transfer mode (ATM) cell data,<br>
and Internet protocol (IP) packet data. The ST-16 architecture uses accelerator cards<br>
(e.g., card 1020) such as Packet Accelerator cards (PACs) for packet processing and<br>
Telephony Accelerator cards (TACs) for voice processing. Each PAC can perform data<br>
processing and each TAC can perform voice processing. In the ST-16, physical<br>
input/output (I/O) interfaces are terminated on industry standard line cards (e.g., cards<br>
1030A, 1030B) and can carry TDM, packet or ATM cell data types in accordance with<br>
various physical interface standards. Since TDM interfaces primarily carry voice traffic,<br>
TDM line cards communicate with a TAC. Ethernet line cards carry packet data traffic<br>
and can communicate with a PAC. An optical line card supports ATM cells, which can<br>
carry both voice and data traffic, and can communicate with a PAC or a TAC. The ST-16<br>
also has Redundant Crossbar Cards (RCCs) (e.g., cards 1040A, 1040B) which are used to<br>
allow a line card in any slot to communicate with an accelerator cards in any slot in the<br>
ST-16 (see copending United States Patent Application Serial No.____, entitled<br>
REDUNDANCY IN VOICE AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, filed<br>
August 11,2003).<br>
The ST-16 usesa card to card communication system ("STARChannel")<br>
described below to provide links to connect the accelerator cards to the line cards and the<br>
RCCs. In an example implementation, a STARChannel link has 4.0 Gbps data capacity<br>
and includes two physical serial links operating in channel locked mode. Each physical<br>
serial link is clocked at 2.5 Gbps (8B/10B coded) and can carry 2.0 Gbps data.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a logical view of a single STARChannel link, which is able to carry<br>
voice, data and control traffic simultaneously in separate logical channels. The unit of<br>
transmission on the STARChannel link is a STARCell data structure cell ("STARCell"),<br>
described below. The STARChannel link uses a STARChannel protocol mechanism, also<br>
described below, to carry user data and control traffic between the line cards and<br>
accelerator cards and also provide 1:n redundancy support when used in conjunction with<br>
RCC cards.<br>
As shown in Figs. 6-7, each STARCeU 6010 includes a header field 6020,<br>
followed by a payload field 6030, and a trailer field 6040. The header carries information<br>
that uniquely identifies the cell on the STARChannel. The payload field carries the voice,<br>
data, or control traffic and the trailer field contains a cyclic redundancy check (CRC-16)<br>
over the payload field.<br>
A system side interface of STARChannel supports a defined first in first out<br>
(FIFO) interface. Proprietary and standard bus interface standards can be used to<br>
communicate across STARChannel by providing the conversion to the standard<br>
STARChannel FIFO interface at each end of STARChannel system interface.<br>
Accordingly, two incompatible bus standards can be connected across physically separate<br>
cards and redundancy connection support can also be supported.<br>
Since the STARChannel system uses a high-speed Serial interconnect, a relatively<br>
small number of pins is required for a connector on a back plane of the ST-16 compared<br>
to a typical parallel bus interface. For example (see Fig. 4), STARChannel uses 16 pins to<br>
implement a full-duplex 4.0 Gbps rate with redundancy support, which would require 140<br>
pins with a typical parallel bus format. The STARChannel system uses high-speed<br>
differential lines to signal data between two cards. The clock to sample the data at the<br>
receiver is embedded in the signal transmitted by the transmitter, which circumventing a<br>
need to separately route the clock from one card to another card.<br>
In the ST-16, components of STARChannel are implemented on each of the line<br>
cards and each of the accelerator cards using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)<br>
(e.g., FPGAs 1050A-1050C) and Serializer/ Deserializer (SERDES) device (e.g.,<br>
SERDES 1060A-1060D). The FPGA implements STARChannel link management<br>
functions, glue logic to convert from standard bus interface to STARChannel system side<br>
interface, SERDES command and data interfaces and control, status, and statistics for the<br>
STARChannel link. The SERDES provides the parallel-to-serial, serial-to-parallel, and<br>
8B/10B encoding/decoding functions for the STARChannel system.<br>
In the ST-16, the accelerator card in the front slot connects to two line cards in the<br>
corresponding slots on the back plane using primary STARChannel links (e.g., links<br>
1070A, 1070B). A secondary set of STARChannel links (e.g., links 1080A-1080D) are<br>
used to connect to the RCC. The primary STARChannel links are used to directly connect<br>
the PAC and line card; the secondary STARChannel links are used to connect the PACs<br>
and the line cards through the RCCs.<br>
In an example implementation, STARChannel includes the following features.<br>
STARChannel supports simultaneous transfer of TDM, ATM, IP packet, and control data<br>
on logical separate channels within the STARChannel link. Per logical channel flow<br>
control is provided to independently control transfer of data over logical channels without<br>
causing head of line blocking. Round robin and strict priority servicing of channels is<br>
supported, which enables low latency traffic to be transferred across die STARChannel<br>
link with low jitter. 2.5 Gbps of user data capacity are provided with transfer overhead<br>
over a 4.0 Gbps STARChannel link. One accelerator card may communicate with two<br>
line cards. Redundant STARChannel links used in conjunction with RCC allows any<br>
combination of l:n redundancy (n
interface bus may extended to access peripheral devices on another card using the control<br>
channel on STARChannel. Control plane and data plane migration may be facilitated<br>
during a redundancy switchover. Errors on redundant STARChannel links or idling<br>
active STARChannel links are actively monitored and reported. Communication can be<br>
provided between devices with incompatible bus interfaces on physically separate cards.<br>
1:1 redundancy can be supported between active and redundant STARChannel links. 1+1<br>
redundancy support can be provided between two active STARChannel links. Load<br>
sharing can be supported over two active STARChannel links with an option to<br>
selectively steer traffic from one link to another in case of one link failure.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, in the example implementation, a STARCell includes an 8-<br>
byte header followed by payload and 16-bit CRC16 field. Each STARCell is transmitted<br>
on the serial link encapsulated with Start of Frame K-Character (K28_0) 6050 and End of<br>
Frame K-character (K28_2) 6060. When there is no STARCell to transmit, an IDLE K-<br>
character (K28_5) is transmitted. When there is a change in link flow control or channel<br>
flow-control status, an XON/XOFF K-Character (K28_3/K28_4) followed by the per<br>
channel flow control bitmap is transmitted on STARChannel link.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates an example of the STARCell header format The CRC-8 field<br>
carries the CRC for the first 7-bytes of the STARCell header and is present in the 8th byte<br>
of the STARCell header. The CRC-8 polynomial used is x8 + x2 + x + 1. In the example,<br>
the 16-bit CRC-16 always occupies two-bytes. All padding is included in the CRC-16<br>
calculations, and padding is always 32-bit word aligned. Further in the example, the CRC<br>
field is also 32-bit word aligned; hence two pad bytes are always added before the CRC-<br>
16 field. The CRC16 polynomial used is x16 + x12 + x5 + 1. The CRC-16 is calculated<br>
only on the payload of the STARCell.<br>
The STARChannel link interface is big-endian and is 32-bit word aligned; hence<br>
there could be 2-5 bytes of pad data between last byte of the STARCell payload and the<br>
2-byte CRC-16 trailer.<br>
At least the following types of STARCell are supported in the STARChannel<br>
system as described below: an IDLE STARCell, a data STARCell, and a control<br>
STARCell. An IDLE STARCell is normally transmitted when there are no data<br>
STARCells to transmit. IDLE STARCells are normally used to monitor the redundant<br>
STARChannel links as well the active STARChannel link when there is no data being<br>
transferred on the link. As shown in Fig. 8, an IDLE STARCell 8010 includes the same<br>
8-byte STARCell header followed by 32-bytes of an alternating "AAAA" and "5555"<br>
pattern in the payload followed by the CRC16 trailer. The type field is set to IDLE in the<br>
STARCell header.<br>
The data STARCells are used to transport TDM, ATM, and IP packet data in<br>
STARChannel links. The payload type being carried by the data STARCell is identified<br>
in the STARCell header. Packet data is carried in units of STARCells, which can each<br>
carry a payload of 1-120 bytes. In the example implementation, ATM and TDM data<br>
STARCells are always carried in a single STARCell with the type field set to SEOP.<br>
Packet data may span a single STARCell or multiple STARCells. The STARCell type<br>
field indicates the sequence of cells in STARChannel. A normal data packet consists of a<br>
start of packet (SOP) STARCell, followed by zero or more middle of packet (MOP)<br>
STARCells, followed by an end of packet (EOP) good STARCell. In at least some cases,<br>
an entire short packet can be contained in a single SEOP STARCell.<br>
The control STARCells are used to access peripherals on line cards from a host<br>
processor on an accelerator card over the control channel of the STARChannel link. The<br>
control STARCELL includes a second layer of encoding in the STARCell payload to<br>
specify and access registers. Simple read write access as well burst read/write accesses<br>
are supported using a control cell format 9010 illustrated in Fig. 9.<br>
The control STARCells may be used in accordance with a STARChannel control<br>
protocol that provides a generalized method of accessing command, status, and statistics<br>
registers within a peripheral chip by using a dedicated STARCell type. The control<br>
STARCells sent to or from the PAC to line card include a second layer of encoding to<br>
specify and control register accesses.<br>
The control STARCells support simple read/write accesses to single registers in<br>
the line card or multiple accesses to consecutive registers starting at the address carried in<br>
the STARCell extended header. The extended header also indicates whether the current<br>
access is a burst access: The Burst length field defines the maximum burst size, which<br>
may be up to seven words. Seven STARChannel data registers, one address register, and<br>
one command register are provided.<br>
For a write command, the STARCHANNEL_DATA registers are written first,<br>
followed by the STARCHANNEL_ADDRESS register. Execution of a write procedure to<br>
the STARCHANNEL_CMD register causes a control STARCell to be generated, which<br>
carries the address/data information to the line card. The COMMAND_DONE bit is reset.<br>
The line card performs a write procedure to the requested location and generates an ACK<br>
cell in response, to indicate that execution of the write procedure is completed, which<br>
causes the COMMAND DONE bit to be set in the STARCHANNEL_CMD register.<br>
Accordingly, the CPU monitors the COMMAND DONE bit to detect command<br>
completion before issuing another command on the STARChannel.<br>
For a read command, the STARCHANNEL_CMDADDRESS register is written<br>
with a setting to cause the reading of a single register at the start address or multiple<br>
registers starting at the start address. The burst length defines the maximum number of<br>
registers to be read. A control STARCELL is sent to the line card and the<br>
COMMAND_DONE flag is reset The line card returns the read results in a control<br>
STARCELL, in the DATA1 to DATA7 registers, and the COMMAND DONE flag is set<br>
in the CMDADDRESS register.<br>
One or more situations described below can cause error conditions to occur on the<br>
STARChannel, which executes to handle these situations without causing a disruption of<br>
data transfer on the STARChannel link. With respect to Fig. 10, a first situation includes<br>
packet sequence errors: The header of each STARCell contains a 3-bit type field that<br>
indicates packet sequencing. A normal data packet consists of a SOP STARCell, followed<br>
by zero or more MOP STARCells, followed by EOP good STARCell. Sometimes an<br>
entire short packet can be contained in a single SEOP STARCell. A packet sequence error<br>
occurs when the normal STARCell sequence is violated.<br>
In Fig. 10, non-normal sequences are indicated by "converted" and "discarded".<br>
In a "converted" case, the STARCell type is converted to End of Packet bad (EOPB). In a<br>
"discarded" case, the STARCell is not converted, and is simply discarded.<br>
An invalid channel number may be found. In the example implementation,<br>
STARChannel implements 8 data channels (0 to 7). If a STARCell is received on<br>
unsupported channel number, the STARCell is dropped.<br>
A flow control error may be found. If the STARChannel receives a STARCell on<br>
a channel for which it has no receive buffers, the STARCell will be dropped.<br>
A STARCell header error may be found. If a CRC-8 checksum error is detected<br>
over the 8-byte STARCell header, the STARCell is dropped.<br>
A STARCell payload error may be found. If a CRC-16 checksum error is detected<br>
over the STARCell payload, the STARCell is dropped.<br>
In the example implementation, STARChannel maintains statistical counters,<br>
including the following:<br>
1. Per Channel Transmit and receive STARCell count.<br>
2. Per Channel Discarded and Converted STARCell count<br>
3. Overflow error, Invalid error, CRC-8 error, CRC-16 error<br>
4. Number of IDLE and Control STARCells transmitted and received per<br>
STARChannel link.<br>
The example implementation of the STARChannel link supports flow control<br>
mechanisms including channel flow control and link flow control. In the case of channel<br>
flow control, STARChannel maintains a per channel receive queue and a per channel<br>
transmit queue. If the receive channel queue passes a threshold corresponding to an<br>
"almost full" level, the local transmitter asserts the flow control bit for the corresponding<br>
channel to the remote receiver. The remote receiver receives the flow control bit and<br>
instructs the remote transmitter to stop transmitting on the flow-controlled channel.<br>
In the case of link flow control, a link first in first out mechanism (FIFO) is<br>
implemented per STARChannel interface and a link level flow control mechanism is<br>
implemented to maintain receive overflows in the link FIFO. When two STARChannel<br>
devices running at considerably different speeds are communicating with each other, it is<br>
possible for the link FIFO to fill up before the channel flow control is asserted. If so, this<br>
condition is reported to the remote transmitter using a K- character XON/XOFF flow<br>
control sequence. When an XOFF K-Character (K28_4) is received, the transmitter<br>
stops transmitting STARCells. When an XON K-Character (K28_3) is received, the<br>
transmitter starts sending STARCells.<br>
In the example implementation, STARChannel also supports loopback modes<br>
including STARChannel local line loopback, STARChannel remote loopback,<br>
STARChannel local facility loopback, and STARChannel remote facility loopback. In<br>
the case of STARChannel local line loopback, data received on the system interface of<br>
the accelerator card is looped back at the local serial transmit interface on accelerator<br>
card.<br>
In STARChannel remote loopback, data received on the system interface of the<br>
accelerator card is looped back at the STARChannel system interface on the line card.<br>
Data received on the system interface of the line card in STARChannel local<br>
facility loopback is looped back at the local serial transmit interface on line card.<br>
In the case of STARChannel remote facility loopback, data received on the system<br>
interface of the line card is looped back at the STARChannel system interface on the<br>
accelerator card.<br>
The technique (including one or more of the procedures described above) may be<br>
implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of both. In at least some cases, it<br>
is advantageous if the technique is implemented in computer programs executing on one<br>
or more programmable computers, such as a system using a network processor solution<br>
from SiByte, Inc., a general purpose computer, or a computer running or able to run<br>
Microsoft Windows 95,98, 2000, Millennium Edition, NT, XP or other Microsoft<br>
operating system; Unix; Linux; or MacOS; that each include a processor such as an Intel<br>
Pentium 4, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and non-<br>
volatile memory and/or storage elements), at least one input device such as a keyboard or<br>
a voice input device (which may include a microphone), and at least one output device.<br>
Program code is applied to data entered using the input device to perform the method<br>
described above and to generate output information. The output information is applied to<br>
one or more output devices such as a display screen of the computer.<br>
In at least some cases, it is advantageous if each program is implemented in a high<br>
level procedural or object-oriented programming language such as C, C++, Java, or Perl<br>
to communicate with a computer system. However, the programs can be implemented in<br>
assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled<br>
or interpreted language.<br>
In at least some cases, it is advantageous if each such computer program is stored<br>
on a storage medium or device, such as ROM or magnetic diskette, mat is readable by a<br>
general or special purpose programmable computer for configuring and operating the<br>
computer when the storage medium or device is read by the computer to perform the<br>
procedures described in this document. The system may also be considered to be<br>
implemented as a computer-readable storage medium, configured with a computer<br>
program, where the storage medium so configured causes a computer to operate in a<br>
specific and predefined manner.<br>
