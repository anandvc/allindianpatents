In the preparation process (J-B), approximately 1 mole of carbamoyl chloride of the formula (XIV) is reacted per mole of starting material of the formulae (I-l-A-a) to (I-3-B-a), at from -20 to l50°C, preferably from 0 to 70°C.z 5<br>
Suitable diluents which are added, if appropriate, are all inert polar organic solvents, such as nitriles, esters, ethers, amides, sulphones, sulphoxides or halogenated hydrocarbons.<br>
10	Preference  is given  to  using acetonitrile,  ethyl  acetate,  dimethyl  sulphoxide,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or methylene chloride.<br>
If, in a preferred embodiment, the enolate salt of the compounds (M-A-a) to<br>
(I-3-B-a) is prepared by addition of strong deprotonating agents (such as, for<br>
15	example, sodium hydride or potassium tert-butoxide), it is not necessary to add<br>
further acid binders.<br>
If acid binders are employed, these are customary inorganic or organic bases, for<br>
example sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, triethylamine or<br>

If   appropriate,   the   compounds   according   to   the   invention   can,   at   certain<br>
concentrations or application rates, also be used as herbicides or microbicides, for<br>
15	example as fungicides, antimycotics and bactericides. If appropriate, they can also be<br>
employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations<br>
20	such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally<br>
occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and inclusive of the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant<br>
25	breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of<br>
plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings,,<br>
30	tubers, rhizomes, offsets and seeds.<br><br>
Le A 34 460-Foreign Countries<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
compounds is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the<br>
surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for<br>
example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in<br>
5	the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying<br>
one or more coats.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
10	those obtained by conventional biological breeding, such as crossing or protoplast<br>
fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetical engineering, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been<br>
15	explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention.<br>
20	Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth<br>
conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
25	the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures,<br>
increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the<br>
30	effects which were actually to be expected.<br><br>
Le A 34 460-Foreign Countries<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetical engineering)<br>
which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which,<br>
in the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly<br>
advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties<br>
5	are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased<br>
tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the  harvested products.  Further and particularly emphasized<br>
10	examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and<br>
microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes,<br>
15	cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits<br>
and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes<br>
20	CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryIIA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb<br>
and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The<br>
25	genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination<br>
with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example<br>
30	maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of<br>
herbicide-tolerant plants which  may be  mentioned are maize  varieties, cotton<br><br>
Le A 34 460-Foreign Countries<br>
varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup<br>
Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty<br>
Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to<br>
imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylurea, for example maize).<br>
5	Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide<br>
tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>

The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the formula (I). The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the mixtures specifically<br>
15	mentioned in the present text.<br>
The active compounds can be converted to the customary formulations, such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble<br>
powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials<br>
20	impregnated with active compound and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam-formers.<br>
25<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic<br>
30	hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions,<br>
mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and<br><br>
Le A 34 460-Foreign Countries<br>
esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
5	As solid carriers there are suitable:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; as solid carriers for granules there are suitable: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as<br>
10	calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic<br>
and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; as emulsifiers and/or foam-formers there are suitable: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene  fatty  alcohol   ethers,   for  example  alkylaryl   polyglycol   ethers,<br>
15	alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates; as<br>
dispersants there are suitable: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
20	form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
25	It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
30	The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active<br>
compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br><br>
Le A 34 460-Foreign Countries<br>
The active compound according to the invention can be present in its commercially<br>
available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a<br>
mixture with other active compounds, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilizing<br>
5	agents, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth-regulating substances<br>
or herbicides. The insecticides include, for example, phosphoric acid esters, carbamates, carboxylates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylureas and substances produced by microorganisms, inter alia.<br>

15<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature and occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can be determined for the use in each case by a series of tests. In general, however, it is sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of<br>
20	the active compound, based on the material to be preserved.<br>
Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organic chemical solvent or solvent<br>
mixture and/or an oily or oil-like organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low<br>
volatility and/or a polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water,<br>
25	and if appropriate an emulsifier and/or wetting agent.<br>
Organic chemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solvents<br>
having an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably<br>
above 45°C. Substances which are used as such oily or oil-like water-insoluble<br>
30	solvents of low volatility are appropriate mineral oils or aromatic fractions thereof, or<br><br>
Le A 34 460-Foreign Countries<br>
solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, white spirit having a boiling<br>
5	range from 170 to 220°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 350°C,<br>

In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from<br>
10	180 to 210°C or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons having<br>
a boiling range from 180 to 220°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility which have an evaporation<br>
15	number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be<br>
replaced in part by organic chemical solvents of high or medium volatility, providing that the solvent mixture likewise has an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture. 20<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organic chemical solvent or<br>
solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organic chemical solvent or solvent<br>
mixture. Aliphatic organic chemical solvents containing hydroxy! and/or ester and/or<br>
ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters or the like, are preferably<br>
25	used. <br>
Organic chemical binders which are used in the context of the present invention are<br>
the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se, are water-<br>
dilutable and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organic chemical<br>
30	solvents employed, in particular binders consisting of or comprising an acrylate resin,<br>
a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or<br><br>
Le A 34 460-Foreign Countries<br>
polyaddition resin, polyurettfane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-cumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable oils and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin. 5<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion,<br>
dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders<br>
in an amount of up to 10% by weight. Dyestuffs, pigments, water-repelling agents,<br>
odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like which are known<br>
10	per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according W the invention for the composition or concentrate to<br>
comprise, as the organic chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd<br>
resin and/or one drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than<br>
15	45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight, are preferably used according to the<br>
invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a<br>
plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the<br>
20	active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to<br>
30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as<br>
dibutyl, dioctyl or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl<br>
25	phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as<br>
butyl stearate or amyl stearate. oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic acid esters.<br>

The compounds according to the invention can at the same time be employed for<br>
25	protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, such as<br>
hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from<br>
the Ledamorpha group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum<br>
30	species, or by species from the Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as<br>
Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the frictional drag of ships and, as a<br><br>
Le A 34 460-Foreign Countries<br>
consequence, leads to a marked increase in operation costs owing to higher energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling<br>
5	by sessile Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia<br>
(cirriped crustaceans), is of particular importance.<br>

invention can also be employed for controlling animal pests and fungal or bacterial<br>
plant diseases. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for<br>
15	the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble<br>
powders, granules, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials<br>
20	impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the<br>
active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents and/or solid carriers,<br>
optionally with the use of surfactants, that is, emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or<br>
25	foam formers.<br>

10	and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite,<br>
or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for<br>
15	example     alkylaryl     polyglycol     ethers,     alkylsulphonates,     alkyl     sulphates,<br>
arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
