				<td>STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention discloses a simple method for the conversion of waste<br>
polypropylene to fuel oil. A stainless steel reactor is used to convert the waste<br>
polypropylene to fuel oil in presence of an acid treated kaoline catalyst. This catalyst<br>
improves the yield of oil and increases the rate of reaction. The oil obtained in the<br>
optimum condition is a mixture of different fractions in the range of gasoline (30%) and<br>
the rest a mixture of diesel and kerosene.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION:<br>
Plastics pyrolysis has long been topical in academic circles and also continues to inspire<br>
industrial R&amp;D and demonstration projects. Still the pyrolysis of mixed plastics is<br>
economically to be proven because of the small scale potential pyrolysis plant and the<br>
huge cost expenditure towards collecting, cleaning, and grading considerable tonnages of<br>
plastics. In addition, the cost of catalyst, its efficiency to convert the waste plastics to fuel<br>
in terms of change of yield and rate of the reaction, and also its reusability contribute to<br>
the overall economic and ecological aspects of the process. During the past 40 years,<br>
numerous studies have been reported in which a variety of catalysts and reaction<br>
conditions have been employed to convert waste polymers into hydrocarbon mixtures.<br>
This is also reflected by a number of pilot, demonstration, and commercial plants<br>
processing various types of plastic wastes in Germany, Japan, USA, India, and elsewhere.<br>
Exhaustive patent search reveals that no patent has been filed in any country in this<br>
direction using the waste polypropylene and acid treated kaoline clay as catalyst.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The objective of the invention is to develop a process for conversion of waste<br>
polypropylene to liquid fuel. The basic purpose of this invention is the development of a<br>
suitable acid treated kaoline catalyst to be used to convert the waste polypropylene to<br>
enhance the rate of reaction and the oil yield.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
Waste Polypropylenes is subjected to thermal and catalytic cracking, kaoline clay and<br>
acid treated kaolines are used as catalysts for conversion of waste polypropylene to liquid<br>
fuel. The reaction is carried out in a reactor in the temperature range of 400-600°C with<br>
an objective to optimize the oil yield, optimize the amount of catalyst and the reaction<br>
time. In the catalytic pyrolysis, a mixture of catalyst and the polypropylene flakes in<br>
different proportion were subjected to pyrolysis in the reactor at a desired temperature.<br>
The highest yield of liquid product obtained is 82.85% by weight at 500°C in thermal<br>
pyrolysis. Use of kaoline as catalyst increased the yield of liquid fraction to 87.5%.<br>
Sulphuric acid treated kaoline further increased the oil yield to 93%. Study of FTIR and<br>
GC-MS confirmed the presence of different hydrocarbons (mostly alkanes and olefins) in<br>
the oil. The composition of the oil significantly narrowed in presence of kaoline catalyst<br>
and also in acid treated kaoline as compared to thermal pyrolysis. The fuel properties of<br>
the oil was also analysed to find its suitability as a petrochemical fuel substitute. Kaoline<br>
is a cheap chemical and acid treatment technique is very simple process. The catalyst<br>
used can be regenerated back for further use. So this method is simple, eco-friendly and<br>
easy to use.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention provides a process for the conversion of waste polypropylene to<br>
liquid fuel using suitable kaoline clay based catalyst. The different acid treated kaoline is<br>
prepared by treating kaoline with different concentration of sulphuric acid, which is used<br>
in the experiment.<br>
The kaolin clay used in this experiment is procured commercially from Chemtex<br>
Corporation, Kolkata, India. From the proximate analysis and XRD report it could be<br>
concluded that the major component of the clay is kaolinite with Hinckley index of 0.4.<br>
Some traces of impurities (may be mica, quartz and feldspar which could not be traced in<br>
the XRD report) are also present which contribute the components other than SiC^ and<br>
AI2O3. The BET surface area of kaoline was found to be 23m2/g. The pore size<br>
distributions of kaolinite samples showed a sharp peak at a radius of 3.5nm, thus it is<br>
mesoporous.<br>
The modification of kaoline using different concentration of sulphuric acid was carried<br>
out by adding 50g of the clay to 500ml of sulphuric acid solution- of different<br>
concentrations (1M, 3M, 5M) and refluxing at 110 °C under the atmospheric pressure in<br>
a round bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser for four hours. The resulting<br>
clay suspension was then rapidly quenched by adding 500ml ice cold water. The content<br>
was then filtered, repeatedly washed with distilled water to remove any unspent acid,<br>
dried in an oven, calcined at 500°C for one hour and ground in a mortar pastel to powder<br>
form. The untreated sample is referred to as KC and treated samples after calcination at<br>
500°C are referred to as KC1M, KC3M, and KC5M in the subsequent text where the<br>
numbers refers to the different concentration of acid used. Another sample named KC5M<br>
750 is obtained by calcining at 750°C after 5M acid treatment in the same process. The<br>
clay samples were characterized by using XRD, XRF, TGA, SEM, Nitrogen adsorption<br>
desorption isotherm technique, FTIR to understand the affect of acid treatments.<br>
The acid treatment of catalyst increases the Si/Al ratio, surface area and pore volume of<br>
the clay sample. The composition and properties of the different clay samples are<br>
summarised in the Table 1.<br>
The pyrolysis reaction is carried out in a stainless reactor set up. The waste<br>
polypropylene is pyrolysed in the reactor along with different clay catalyst samples using<br>
different catalyst to feed ratio (1:2,1:3,1:4,1:10,1:20,1:40) in the range of temperature<br>
of 400-600°C. The oil yield and reaction time for the pyrolysis reaction carried out using<br>
different catalysts in optimum condition is summarised in Table 2.<br>
Table 2 The'results of the pyrolysis (Temperature=500°C, Catalyst:Feed=l :3) using<br>
different types of catalysts<br>
The fuel properties of pyrolytic oil and its fractions after distillation are summarised in<br>
Table 3. The distillation report of the oil infers that oil is in the boiling range of 59-<br>
346°C, so it is a mixture of different oil fractions in the range of gasoline (30%) and rest<br>
70% a mixture of kerosene and diesel.<br>
The present invention is further described in the following examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
20g waste polypropylene when subjected to thermal pyrolysis at 500°C yield oil of 16.5g<br>
(82.5wt.%) in 58 minutes reaction time.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
20g waste polypropylene when pyrolysed using kaoline catalyst with 1:3 catalysts to<br>
polypropylene ratio at 500°C yield oil of 17.5g (87.5wt.%) in 43 minutes reaction time.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
20g waste polypropylene when pyrolysed using kaoline catalyst with 1:10 catalysts to<br>
polypropylene ratio at 500°C yield oil of 16.8g (84wt.%) in 53 minutes reaction time.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
20g waste polypropylene when pyrolysed using 1MKC catalyst with 1:3 catalysts to<br>
polypropylene ratio at 500°C yield oil of 17.5g (87.5wt.%) in 41 minutes reaction time.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
20g waste polypropylene when pyrolysed using 3MKC catalyst with 1:3 catalysts to<br>
polypropylene ratio at 500°C yield oil of 17.5g (87.5wt.%) in 41 minutes reaction time.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
20g waste polypropylene when pyrolysed using 5MKC catalyst with 1:4 catalysts to<br>
polypropylene ratio at 500°C yield oil of 18.0g (90wt%) in 42 minutes reaction time.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
20g waste polypropylene when pyrolysed using 5MKC catalyst with 1:3 catalysts to<br>
polypropylene ratio at 500°C yield oil of 18.2g (91wt%) in 39 minutes reaction time.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
The reusability of the catalyst was studied by using the used catalyst. The catalysts give<br>
almost same performance up to 4th time reuse. The oil yield decreased to 84wt.% and<br>
reaction time increased to 73 minutes with 5th time reused kaoline (at 500°C with 1:3<br>
catalyst to polypropylene ratio). The 5th time reused kaoline is regenerated by calcining<br>
at 750°C. The regenerated catalyst yield 88wt.% oil in 45minute reaction time (at 500°C<br>
with 1:3 catalyst to polypropylene ratio).<br>
