ELECTRONIC CATALYTIC CONVERTOR<br>
Technical field<br>
This invention relates to change of properties of fuels, liquids and gases used for combustion and heat transfer, reducing the emissions from the combustion, improving the performance of all internal combustion engines and all heat engine cycles. This invention is directed to novel construction of electronic catalytic converter for use in heat engine cycles of all internal combustion engines, turbines, heat pumps, refrigeration cycles and all external combustion equipments.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Combustion emissions are mostly controlled by post treatment of the wasted exhaust with an oxidation or reduction catalysts or combination of both through an exhaust catalytic converter. An exhaust catalytic converter works only with unleaded petrol. Exhaust catalytic convertors cannot be used for the diesel due to the high sulphur content. The soot and the particulates even from the ultra low sulphur diesel clogs the exhaust catalytic convertors or soot traps causing severe back pressure necessitating frequent regeneration of soot or cleaning of the post treatment systems. The exhaust catalytic convertors when used with lower cubic capacity engines cause back pressure and reduces the engine efficiency. No single device is known to pre treat all the fuels for use as a common catalytic converter enabling clean combustion by exciting the molecules and by changing the kinetics of combustion for reduced emissions without using a chemical, noble metal, catalyst or an additive and also for producing hydrogen rich fliels or hydrogen from the materials that stores or contain hydrogen.<br>

Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device which when fitted in the flow line, excite the molecules to yield hydrogen rich fluid or gas.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention relates to change of properties of fuels, liquids and gases used for combustion, reducing the emissions from the combustion, improving the performance of all internal combustion engines, heat transfer and condensation in all heat engine cycles.

The above objectives are achieved with an electronic catalytic convertor comprising a central open ended conduit (1) as means for transporting material(s) and acting as an inlet and an outiet, wave guide and an applicator of microwave heat to the flowing material; a hollow bigger diameter conduit (2) with its ends closed by bushes(6) enclosing and supporting the conduit(l);the conduits(l) and (2) are positioned on the same axis as their centers; plurality of coils (3) being wound over the<br><br>

Other objects of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
Detailed description of die invendon<br>
Fig 1 shows in elevation cross sectional view of the electronic catalytic convertor.<br>
Fig 2 shows in elevation the electronic catalytic convertor having fluid, gas or material passage conduit wound in the form of coil.<br>
Fig 3 shows in elevation electronic catalytic convertor having an enclosure over it's outer surface in order to absorb the convective heat for cooling the convertor as well as to make use of the absorbed heat.<br>
The present invention comprises a conduit (1) for carrying the material- liquid, gas or both;<br><br>
the conduit (1) is enclosed by another bigger diameter conduit (2) with its ends closed by bushes (6) acting as supports for holding conduit (1) and also keeping both the conduits (1) &amp; (2) on the same axis as their centers;<br>
an insulated copper, aluminum or any conducting material with plurality of wire turns (3) for flow of current are wound over the metal conduit (2) and the conduit (2) is magnetized by applying an electric potential;<br>
a co-axial system comprising conduit (1) and conduit (2) is enclosed by another conduit (4) with its ends closed by metal disk or plate having hole at the center similar to a washer with insulated bushes (5) for holding the co-axial conduit (1) and conduit (2) system also at its center ensuring that the center lines of all the three conduits are in the same axis and the whole system acts as a magnetron, co-axial wave guide, cavity resonator and as a cold plasma generator cum plasma accelerator when excited with power source and during material flow;<br>
The hollow cavity of conduit (2) may contain air or any gas or any dielectric material, insulation or made vacuum and the space between conduit (2) and cavity of conduit (4) is filled with air at atmospheric pressure or with any gas or with any dielectric, insulation material or made vacuum;<br>
the ends of the insulated wire turns are connected to an electric potential to magnetize the conduit (2) and to resonate electromagnetic waves inside the cavity of conduit (2) where the modes of propagation and frequency is dependant upon the diameter, length of the cavity in conduit (2) for single cavity and dependent upon the diameters and lengths of conduits (2) and (1) for a co-axial cavity;<br>
a casing (7) having a fluid flow passage (8) and serving as a means for cooling the device from over heating as also for increasing the temperature of fluid or gas or any material flowing through conduit (1) as shown in figure 3;<br>
The functional features of the device of the present invention is further explained in the form of following embodiments:<br><br>
The presence of conduit (1) in the same axis of conduit (2) make a co-axial cavity resonator and tlfc '* i frequency of electromagnetic waves or microwaves or any other waves generated and propagated through it depends upon the inner diameters of the conduit (1) and the inner diameter of conduit (2), the lengths of both conduit (1) and conduit (2). Depending upon the material of conduit (1) and the dielectric property and material of bushes at the ends of conduit (2), the electric potential of conduit (1) and the magnetic and electrical behavior of conduit (1) could be altered other than conduit (2) or kept as the same as conduit (2). Conduit (1) also acts as a wave-guide for electromagnetic waves with various modes and other waves or oscillations generated. When an electric potential is applied to the ends of the insulated wire turns and conduit (2) becomes magnetized, there is an axial field created by external coils and an azimuthal field created by internal conductors with a current value resulting in plasma contained between the concentric cylinders and the loss along field lines is prevented by an electric potential created by annular grids at the ends of the cylinder biased to negative potential by grounding to earth either through brackets used to hold and clamp the electronic catalytic convertor or by other means or kept at positive potential as the case may be and the electromagnetic waves starts resonating inside the cavities of conduit (4), conduit (2) conduit (1) due to co-axial construction or at least in any one of them, the electrons originating from the conduction band of the material of the co-axial conduits due to thermal ionization, electromagnetic ionization are excited, conduit (2) becomes a positive potential and conduit (1) too depending upon the end bush material and it's dielectric property and the electrons are radially confined by the positive potential of the conduit (2) and conduit (1) and orbit around it in low angular momentum, non circular orbits and the electrons would be adiabatically compressed into the interaction region where the radial electric field would be large. This increase the electron density as well as the ratio of their perpendicular to parallel energy and electrons would rapidly transit the interaction region where they would resonantiy transfer their energy to the radiation fields. This result in microwave amplification by stimulated emission radiation and an electron beam is produced whose distribution function is optimized for the power level requirements of the apparatus and the axis of the electron beam coincides with that of the wave guide conduit (1). When the fuel, liquid, gas flows through conduit (1), the magnetic fields cause magneto hydrodynamic conditions along with excitation of the electrons in the conduction band of the material of the conduit (1) and a plasma pinch is formed at the center line of flow with initialization of ionization and the microwaves or other waves act with the plasma pinch creating electron collisions and electron impact for fiirther ionization with neo classical transport effect.<br><br>
The properties of the material flowing through conduit (1) is altered under dynamic conditions oi under steady state condition depending upon the material. Although for a detailed working of th( device, a simple configuration with drawing is highlighted, the device could also be made of a straight conduit of any cross section other than hollow circular sections such as a hollow square section or hollow rectangular section or hollow elliptical section, hollow triangle section or hollow hexagon, pentagon or octagon sections or a combination of all hollow sections for varying the field characteristics and modes of propagation of electromagnetic waves and other types of waves and the cut off frequencies depending upon applications and end use.<br>
In certain applications, the heat generated by the device due to microwave radiation, heating of the coil used for magnetization, heat released due to work done by electric fields within the wave guides to rotate polar molecules etc. could also be utilized by the liquid or gas or material moving within the convertor by covering the major length of the outer conduit (4) by a casing (7) having a fluid flow passage (8) and such arrangement serving as a means for cooling the device from over heating as also for increasing the temperature of liquid, gas or material flowing through conduit (1) as shown in figure 3.<br>
It is abundantiy clear from the foregoing description that the conduit (1) apart from a mere material carrying media has also multi various functions. It acts as a component of cavity resonator. It further acts as a wave-guide. Further the said conduit (1) acts as an applicator for transmission of microwaves, heat, electric and magnetic fields generated, resonator cum cavity reflector for other forms and types of waves and emissions, part of the anode of the magnetron, plasma pinch generator containing ionized liquid or gas.<br>
Another bigger diameter conduit (2) and the enclosure pipe (4) acts as cavity resonator and wave guide. The complete co-axial system with conduit (1), conduit (2) and conduit (4) having the same common axis represent a co-axial resonator for microwaves and any other waves for propagation and resonance and also fimction as a magnetron, as a cold plasma generator cum plasma accelerator.<br>
The conduit (1) as envisaged in the invention is either built into the device so as to be part of the electronic catalytic convertor or a conventional conduit used in the conventional flow line can be readily substituted in place of aforesaid built in conduit (1).   The structural arrangements may be<br><br>
incorporated in  the  electronic catalytic convertor, which allows the possibilities of using the i^ conventional flow lines for replacement of the conduit (1).<br>
Though the embodiment of the invention as envisaged is described with respect to electronic catalytic convertor, the invention with all its ramifications find acceptance in various areas of applications such as internal combustion engines, outer combustion equipments fluid flow lines, process flow lines of chemical equipments for heating the fluids or in fluid flow lines as an inline electronic catalytic convertor or as a heat pump in any heat conversion equipments such as an internal combustion engine, combustion equipment, heat transfer equipments, refrigeration equipments and in the flow lines of exhaust gas of any combustion equipments or in the exhaust gas lines of internal combustion engines for further emission reduction and conversion of burnt and unbumt emissions for further use.<br>
The device is installed before the engine carburetor, fuel injection system for altering the properties of the hydrocarbon fuel or other fuels for better combustion efficiency, reduced fuel consumption and lesser emissions either as a separate device in the fluid flow lines or integrated as a component in the assembly of equipments or fuel systems such as the fuel injection system, carburetor, fiiel pump., fuel filter etc. as a pre engine device. This electronic catalytic convertor excites the molecules and the electrons of the materials contained within it to cause charge transfer resulting in any one or all of the following namely change of the molecular structure, bond orientations, bond strength, changes in the translational, rotational ,vibrational and electronic motions of the molecules resulting in changes in the molecular energy levels ,physical property, chemical property. It has no moving parts and the device is fixed in the flow line either at the input or at the output or in between the flow lines to obtain maximum benefit.<br>
The device is fitted to any hydrocarbon fuels- petrol, diesel, kerosene, white kerosene, aviation fuel bio-diesel, vegetable oils, ethainol or methanol mixed blends, naptha, gas operated engines, turbines or combustion systems very easily without any alterations to the engine within few hours.<br>
The device makes use of some of the properties of matter such as "Electro Negativity", "Influence of lone Pairs of Atoms", "Strains &amp; Conformation" to change bonding angles of molecules, affinity<br><br>
of oxygen atoms, ionization, plasma or energy catalysis resulting in separation of Macro Molecules under magneto hydrodynamics(MHD) and electro hydrodynamics(EHD) Influence resulting in reformulated or hydrogen rich fuel, dia and Param^netic Anisotropy of Macro molecules, magnetic orientation of molecules for altering the molecular properties including activation enei^ level, chemical rate constants of the hydrocarbon fuel or liquid or gas flowing through it before mixing with air for ignition in the engine facilitating changed kinetics of the combustion and volume fraction of the end products of combustion or kinetics of the condensation in the case of heat transfer process.<br>
Petrol, Diesel, Kerosene, Lubricating Oil refined from crude oil belong to Alkanes group of hydrocarbons with different boiling points and can be used as fijel The physical and chemical properties of alkanes are a function first of the number of carbon atoms it contains and second of it's specific structure. The excitation of the fuel in the presence of a suitable catalj^t cause Ring Strain and make the alkanes loose a hydrogen atom The H - H bond is weakened and a reactive hydrogen atom adds to the double bond or to Lone Pairs of atoms. The trace of moisture and additives in the fuels cause Electro negativity which under external field excitation make oxygen also bond with Lone Pairs of Atoms altering the molecular structure of the fuel, it's physical and chemical properties including Activation Energy Level, volatility, fuel quality and chemical rate constants.<br>
A lean mbrture is a definite answer for reduced pollution and fuel economy. A lean mixture burns slowly and yields hi^er thermal efficiency due to ratio of specific heat approaching that of air and with less dissociation loss due to lower combustion temperature with lesser nitrogen oxides emissions, lower losses to cooling water and air. However a lean mixture is very difficult to ignite and engines operating with lean mixture require higjb compression ratio or high-octane fuel. The field excitation cause rearrangement of molecular clusters and molecular bonding with liberation of ions, radicals making the fuel hydrogen rich enabling heterogeneous gas phase combustion which is an efficient way of burning a lean mixture outside the flammability limits without forming pollutants. Gas phase ignition of hydrogen rich hydrocarbon increase flame velocity and reduce minimum ignition energy The ions, radicals due to plasma catalysis/energy catalysis along with the hydrogen content controls the reaction rate instead of the normal fuel.<br><br>
Emission of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbon are related to air tuel ratio, m a vehicle fitted with a catalytic convertor, the air fuel ratio is around 15:1 or less for less emission whereas with the invented device, the air fuel ratio is above 16:1 to 22:1 depending upon engine condition which results in fuel economy and less emission.<br>
The ability of the engine to start with a lean mixture (with increased air input) reduced fuel consumption and less emission, less engine knocking (smoothness of engine working), less engine temperature are indicative of the physical and chemical property changes of the fuel due to molecular structure change made by the invented device.<br>
It is evident that the device according to invention makes use of various scientific principles as enumerated in the body of the specification The precision of the device is an important criteria to augment the working results and to achieve optimum operating results. The embodiment of the invention illustrated in the drawing is to explain the active principles involved in the construction and the operation of the device and the combined or otherwise synergistic effect of various active principles and components in the said device.<br>
