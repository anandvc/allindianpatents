				<td>This present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of highly sensitive lead sulphide infrared detector.<br>
Lead sulfide (PbS), lead selenide (PbSe) and lead telluride (PbTe) are well known infrared detectors. The lead sulfide detectors most versatile, rugged one for use at room temperature operation and can be in the wavelength range of 1-3 microns. PbS. polycrystalline thin layers used for infrared detectors were prepared hitherto by vacuum evaporation and chemical bath deposition. Easy and cheap method of preparation of chemical bath deposition reported by Kicinski [Chem.Industry (1948) p.54] has not given many essential details for infrared detection use. The preparative method consist of chemical reaction beweeen lead acetate and thiourea in highly alkaline conditions. A mirror like deposit of PbS is obtained on the glass plate suspended in the solution. The rate and quantity of alkali addition, temperature, stirring rate are very critical parameters in the preparation of satisfactory films.<br>
The sensitivity of the films as described by Kicinski is low.   The films<br>
prepared by this process are tested under a bias of 170V with a 15 w tungsten<br>
lamp at a distance of 25 cm from the source with a 90 Hz chopper under the<br>
match resistance conditions. The signal obtained was 20 mV.<br>
Spectral response   -        visible -   3 microns<br>
Dark resistance       -         5-6 M.ohms<br>
Signal to Noise ratio	- 10<br>
sensitivity	
This method talks of no further steps of sensititation after deposition. Suryanarayana et al (Patent 851631) have modified the method of<br><br>
preparation the layers are subsequent sensitised by heat treatment in oxygen atmosphere and lacquered for protection against atmospheric action. The layers thus fabricated were found to be sensitive. These layers require more than 30 days ageing for stabilisation before use, further there is a drift during biasing for detection at higher voltages. These are the major drawbacks of the process by Suryanarayana et al.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a modified process for obtaining highly sensitive lead sulfide infrared detector which obviates the drawbacks mentioned earlier. The sensititation process involving insitu oxidation during preparation is achieved by using oxidising agents such as N-Bromo Succinamide, N-Chloro succinamide, HaO2 and KMnO4. The addition of 0.01 - 0.2 wt% of oxidising agent in alkaline solution and or treating the chemically prepared PbS film in by dip treatment for durations ranging from 1 - 30 mts. which stabilises the detector against drift and can be used without ageing.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to have a drift free detector under high applied voltage conditions.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of highly sensitive lead sulphide infrared detector which comprises depositing lead sulfide film on a glass substrate by immersing the substrate in a bath containing 30 - 40% lead acetate, 8 - 12% thiourea and water, adjusting the pH 10 - 11 by adding sodium hydroxide at a temperature 25-30°C, sensitising the said film characterized in that by insitu oxidation using an organic or inorganic oxidising agent such as herein described, heating the said sensitised film at a temperature ranging between 450 -<br><br>
minutes, providing gold with ohmic contact on the said film by known methods, soldering tinned copper leads to the above said gold film using an indium solder followed by lacquering to obtain the desired detector.<br>
In an embodiment of prevent invention the organic oxidising agent used is selected from N-chloro-succinamide and N-bromo succinamde.<br>
In an embodiment of prevent invention inorganic oxidising agent used is selected from Kl, KMnCXtand HaC^.<br>
In an embodiment of prevent invention wherein heating is done preferably at a temperature of 490 - 540°C.<br>
The deposition bath consists of a mixture of 30 ml of 40% lead acetate and 10 ml of 12% thiourea to which are added 50 ml of water and kept stirred for 5 minutes at a speed of 200 rpm. The glass plates attached to a perspex holder is kept immersed in the bath. After 5 minutes, 2 ml of 66% sodium hydroxide is added and after 5 minutes yet another of 8 ml of hydroxide is added and stirred for 15 minutes. The oxidising agent is added to the deposition bath after 15 min. from the complete alkali addition. In another case after the complete addition of the alkali the films were removed from the bath, washed well and dried and heat treated at 450 - 550°C for 5 - 10 minutes in oxygen atmosphere is treated with the oxidising agent.<br>
The following typical examples are given to illustrate the invention which describes the method to increase the stability and to have drift free operational conditions when in use in any device.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
Deposition bath consists of a mixture of 30 ml of 40% lead acetate and 10 ml of 12% thiourea to which are added 50 ml of water and kept stirred for 5 minutes at a speed of 200 rpm. The glass plates attached to a perspex holder is kept immersed in the bath. After 5 minutes, 2 ml of 66% sodium hydroxide is added and after 5 minutes yet another of 8 ml of hydroxide is added and stirred for 15 minutes, then 0.01% solution of H2O2 is added and after 15 minutes complete alkali addition. The films were with distilled and dried. The dried films were heat treated at 500°C for 10 minutes in oxygen. The films after heat treatment were provided gold with ohmic contacts by vacuum evaporation unit using a suitable mask.<br>
Immediately after gold evaporation the films were given a protective coating to avoid exposure to moisture with an optical plastic. Tinned copper leads were soldered to the gold electrodes, using indium solder.<br>
The characteristics of the representative sample are given below: When tested under 170 V bias with a 15 W tungsten lamp at a distance of 25 cm from the source with 90 Hz chopper at the matched resistance conditions. Signal obtained after RG 1000 filter (for visible cut off) was 0.6V.<br>
