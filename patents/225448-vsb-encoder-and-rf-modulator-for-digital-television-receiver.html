				<td>LOW COST VGB ENCODER AND RF MODULATOR FOR SUPPLYING VSB<br>
BASEBAND SIGNAL TO RF INPUT OF DIGITAL TELEVISION RECEIVER<br>
Background of the Invention and Prior Art<br>
This invention relates generally to digital VSB (vestigial side band) television<br>
receivers and specifically to a simple low cost system for coupling a digital VSB<br>
signal from any of a plurality of sources of MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group)<br>
digital signal to a digital VSB television receiver. While the description is directed to<br>
a VSB digital format, it should be understood that the invention in its broader aspects<br>
is not limited to a particular digital format.<br>
The recently adopted Digital Television Standard specifies a VSB subsystem<br>
having a terrestrial broadcast mode (8VSB) and a high data rate mode (16 VSB).<br>
There are other VSB modes available, namely 2 VSB, 4 VSB and 8 VSB (non<br>
terrestrial). The 8 VSB terrestrial mode has the data carrying capability of 4 VSB.<br>
(The Trellis coding that is added for the terrestrial environment creates the additional<br>
modulation levels.) The digital data signal is MPEG and Dolby AC-3 processed and<br>
must be subjected to decompression before application to conventional video and<br>
audio circuitry. For terrestrial broadcasting, the data signal is: randomized; subjected<br>
to Reed-Solomon (R/S) type encoding for error correction; interleaved; Trellis<br>
encoded; multiplexed with segment sync and field sync; supplied with a DC pilot;<br>
subject to pre-equalization filtering; modulated; and RF upconverted for transmission.<br>
The digital television receiver includes a tuner and a VSB demodulator for developing<br>
the baseband signal, which is in compressed form. The demodulated signal is applied<br>
to an equalizer for equalizing the received signal. The baseband signal is applied to a<br>
transport demultiplexer which directs the data to an appropriate MPEG decoder and a<br>
Dolby decoder for recovering the video and audio in proper form for application to<br>
video and audio processing circuitry. Digital signals from other sources, such as DVD<br>
(digital video disk) players, VCRs (video cassette recorders), PCs (personal<br>
computers), digital cable boxes, satellite receivers and the like will be supplied to<br>
digital television receivers, as is the case for present analog television receivers.<br>
In an analog system, it is well known that coupling the signal from a VCR or<br>
other video source to a baseband input of a television receiver (if one is available)<br>
yields superior results than those achieved by modulating the signal to RF channel 3<br>
or channel 4 and supplying it to the tuner input of the television receiver. This is not,<br>
however, necessarily true in a digital environment in which case the distance between<br>
the baseband signal source and the television receiver must be kept relatively short.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a compressed baseband digital signal is<br>
encoded in a given format for digital transmission and modulated on an RF carrier for<br>
direct application via a cable network or wireless link to the RF input of a digital<br>
television receiver. The RF' signal, which is at a low power level and has a less-than-<br>
nominal bandpass, takes advantage of the front-end signal processing that is built into<br>
the digital television receiver. Signal impairments, due to the less-than-nominal<br>
bandpass characteristic and noise introduced during transmission, that are below a<br>
given threshold are corrected by the correction circuitry in the digital television<br>
receiver front end. The low signal power, the corrective circuitry for the digital signal<br>
and the benign environment of the communications link, enable components and<br>
circuits of much lower tolerance (and cost) to be used in the encoding and modulating<br>
process. The result is an encoder-modulator that is very low cost and very effective in<br>
coupling a digital baseband signal to a digital television receiver over an RF channel.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
A principal object of the invention is to provide a novel digital signal<br>
translation system.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a digital encoder-modulator for<br>
coupling a baseband digital signal to a VSB digital television receiver.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a low cost digital signal coupling<br>
system for a VSB digital television receiver.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent upon<br>
reading the following description in conjunction with the drawing, in which:<br>
FIG 1 is a simplified block diagram of a VSB digital signal encoder-modulator<br>
constructed in accordance with the invention;<br>
FIG 2 is a simplified block diagram of another form of a digital signal encoder-<br>
modulator constructed in accordance with the invention; and<br>
FIG 3 are curves illustrating the bandpass characteristics of the encoder<br>
modulator of the invention.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring to FIG 1, a source of digital MPEG encoded signal 10 derived from<br>
any of a number of different source types, is shown. For example, the source may<br>
comprise a satellite receiver, a VCR, a DVD, a digital cable box, a PC, etc. The<br>
output of source 10 is an MPEG (and Dolby AC-3) encoded digital signal at baseband<br>
frequency. This baseband signal may be applied directly to a baseband input of a<br>
digital television receiver 24. However, in accordance with the invention, the<br>
baseband signal is applied to an ATSC encoder 12 where the signal is subjected to<br>
interleaving, randomizing, R/S error encoding and Trellis encoding. Field and<br>
segment syncs are added, and while not indicated, a pilot is inserted and equalization<br>
filtering is employed. (See ATSC Standard A/53, ATSC Digital Television Standard<br>
for a detailed description of these operations.) The signal is then supplied to a digital<br>
to analog (D/A) converter 14. D/A 14 supplies the analog signal to a pair of<br>
multipliers 13 and 15 that in turn supply signals to a pair of SAW (surface acoustic<br>
wave) filters 16 and 18. Multipliers 13 and 15 are each supplied with a frequency Fl<br>
and F2, respectively for producing two different outputs. The SAW filters are<br>
selectively controlled by a switch 20, with one of the SAWs being used for one<br>
selected channel RF output and the other being used for another selected channel RF<br>
output. The particular RF channel selected is dependent upon the environment in<br>
which the encoder-modulator is used, in particular the availability and type of RF<br>
channels in the receiving area. The SAW filters are relatively low cost devices and are<br>
extensively used in television receivers.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that highly accurate modulators generate<br>
I and Q signals with the signals being combined to cancel one of the sidebands and<br>
generate a vestigial sideband signal. Such modulators are quite complex and very<br>
expensive. In one form of the invention, that arrangement is replaced with a multiplier<br>
(13, 15)and a SAW filter (16, 18). The output of the multiplier is a double sideband<br>
suppressed carrier signal. The following SAW filter removes most of one sideband<br>
(preferably, although not necessarily, the lower sideband) to produce a VSB signal and<br>
also approximates the nominal Nyquist slope of the channel bandpass. As a result of<br>
the less than nominal bandpass characteristic, the transmitted signal will be<br>
characterized by a degree of impairment in the form of intersymbol interference (ISI).<br>
The SAW filters shape the edges of the signal bandpass to approximate the<br>
Nyquist slopes, nominally called for at the band edges in the ATSC standard. (The<br>
Nyquist slopes may be seen by reference to the solid line curve of FIG 3.) The SAW<br>
filter characteristics also provides for adjacent channel rejection. The filtered signal<br>
from the selected one of the SAWs is applied to an RF upconverter 22, which<br>
upconverts the signal to any desired RF channel, channels 3 or 4 being the ones<br>
normally used.<br>
The encoded and modulated VSB signal is supplied over a cable network 2,3,<br>
which may comprise a single coaxial cable or a relatively complex home cable<br>
network, to an RF channel input of a tuner 26 of a VSB digital television receiver 24.<br>
The signal may also be amplified by a low power RF amplifier 25 (shown in dotted<br>
line in FIG. 1) and transmitted wirelessly to the digital television receiver in an<br>
assigned RF broadcast television channel. The received signal is supplied through a<br>
companion SAW filter to a VSB demodulator 28 where the baseband digital signal is<br>
recovered. The demodulated signal is applied to an equalizer 30 that operates to adjust<br>
the response of the receiver to very closely match the solid line Nyquist response (FIG<br>
3) thereby correcting any signal impairments, including any intersymbol interference<br>
introduced in the transmitter and any linear distortions introduced in the<br>
communications link (i.e. the cable network or wireless link) that collectively are<br>
below a given threshold level that is dependent upon the nature of the equalizer. The<br>
signal from equalizer 30 is processed by a forward error correction subsystem 31 to<br>
correct any residual errors due to intersymbol interference and errors due to noise,<br>
both white and impulse, introduced by the cable network or wireless link. The<br>
performance of equalizer 30 and error correction subsystem 31 sets the limit on the<br>
amount of intersymbol interference and linear distortion which can be introduced by<br>
the transmitter and communications channel before the system suffers serious<br>
degradation.<br>
The corrected signal (in MPEG encoded form) is supplied to a transport<br>
demultiplexer 32 that has separate outputs for the video and audio portions of the<br>
signal. The video portion is applied to an MPEG decoder 34 for decompression and<br>
decoding and the audio portion is applied to a Dolby AC-3 decoder 36 for<br>
complementary processing. The resultant video and audio signals are applied to a<br>
video processor 38 and an audio processor 40, respectively.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the RF signal is not as<br>
distance sensitive as a baseband signal and the coaxial cable environment further<br>
minimizes errors or impairments being introduced in transmission. However, even if<br>
some signal impairments are introduced, they may be compensated for by the<br>
corrective circuitry built into the VSB digital television receiver, in particular the<br>
equalization circuitry. The result is a signal translation arrangement that results in<br>
excellent transfer of signal from source 10 to VSB digital television receiver 24, since<br>
the signal is VSB encoded and any errors or signal impairments below a given<br>
threshold are correctable in the television receiver.<br>
In contrast, any baseband digital signals that are supplied to television receiver<br>
24 are introduced after equalizer 30 and error correction subsystem 31 and are<br>
consequently not subject to the corrective effects of the circuitry in the VSB digital<br>
television receiver. Such signals are also distance limited and subject to uncorrectable<br>
errors or impairments, which makes the method of the invention far superior.<br>
In further accordance with the invention, where the digital television receiver<br>
has provision for receiving both a digital and an analog NTSC signal, in establishing<br>
priority of the RF channel output of upconverter 22, the first choice is to supply the<br>
signal on a vacant RF channel in the service area of the television receiver and the<br>
second choice is to supply it on the digital one of a pair of digital and analog NTSC<br>
RF channels in the service area of the television receiver. In this way, any NTSC<br>
interference into the digital channel can be minimized by the circuitry in the digital<br>
channel of the television receiver.<br>
The invention resides in the concept of introducing a given level of<br>
impairments in the encoded digital baseband signal and taking advantage of the signal<br>
correction circuitry that is built into the front end of the digital television receiver to<br>
compensate for such impairments. The cost is kept minimal since in the application of<br>
the invention, transmission power is very low, distance is limited, the coaxial cable is<br>
a low noise environment and the channel shape (Nyquist slope) need not be as<br>
rigorously defined for adjacent channel rejection, signal radiation, etc. This translates<br>
into low cost filtering to create a less-than-nominal Nyquist slope. While this will<br>
clearly cause some intersymbol interference, a mentioned above, all such signal<br>
impairments that are below a predetermined threshold, may be compensated for in the<br>
digital receiver by the cooperative action of complementary filtering, the equalization<br>
circuitry, and the forward error correction circuitry.<br>
The encoder-modulator of FIG 2 is a different version of the invention. Here<br>
the low cost SAW filters of FIG 1 have been replaced by digital filters 50, indicated as<br>
being FIR (finite impulse response) filters. A digital modulator 52 is supplied with the<br>
output of a first local oscillator 56 and converts the filtered input signal to a first IF<br>
signal having a frequency, for example, of about 12 MHz. This signal is applied to<br>
D/A 14 and thence to an RF upconverter 54 that is supplied with the output of a<br>
second local oscillator 58. Local oscillator 58 is controlled by a switch 60 to develop<br>
an RF output from upconverter 54 at either of a pair of RF channel frequencies, as in<br>
the tuner of FIG 1. The output signal is transmitted to the television receiver over<br>
coaxial cable 23. This version of the invention appears to be a more stable system..<br>
Since both systems will involve integrated circuitry, it remains to be seen whether the<br>
cost of the SAWs in the FIG 1 version will be less than the cost of the additional chip<br>
area required in the integrated circuit implementation of the FIG 2 version.<br>
In FIG 3 the solid line curve indicates the ideal Nyquist slope channel<br>
bandpass response characteristic of the transmitted signal. The dashed line curve<br>
indicates the less-than-nominal Nyquist slope that results from using the low cost<br>
SAWs 16 and 18 in FIG 1 and the dotted line curve represents the response for the<br>
FIG 2 implementation using the FIR filters 50. The curves should be recognized as<br>
being representative only and their actual shapes are dependent upon the precision and<br>
the number of the filtering elements used. As mentioned, because of the less-than-<br>
nominal bandpass characteristic produced by either the SAW or the FIR filter<br>
embodiment of the invention, a certain level of intersymbol interference will be<br>
introduced into the transmitted signal. However, as discussed above, the amount of<br>
any such intersymbol interference, together with any noise introduced into the signal<br>
over the communications link, can be substantially corrected in the television receiver<br>
to provide near perfect signal translation and reception. In this manner the invention<br>
permits a low cost, high performance encoder-remodulator by deliberately selecting<br>
lesser tolerance components and applying the signal to a digital receiver that has the<br>
capability of compensating for signal impairments below a given threshold.<br>
What has been described is a novel method and apparatus for translating a<br>
digital television signal from a digital source to a VSB digital television receiver. It is<br>
recognized that numerous changes to the described embodiment of the invention will<br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from its true spirit and scope.<br>
