				<td>A METHOD FOR THE COLD BATCH PREPARATION OF A NON- FINISHED TEXTILE COMPONENT BY THE USE OF HYDROPHOBIC BLEACHING SYSTEMS.  <br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to the cold batch preparation of a non-finished textile component by the use of hydrophobic bleaching systems and, more particularly, to the use of activated peroxide bleaching via hydrophobic activators.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the textile processing of natural fibers, yarns and fabrics, a pretreatment or x preparation step is typically required to properly prepare the natural materials for further use and in particular for the dyeing and /or finishing stages typically required for commercial goods. These textile treatment steps remove impurities and color bodies, either naturally existing or those added by the spinning and weaving steps to the fibers and/or fabrics.<br>
While textile treatments may include a number of varying treatments and stages, the most common include singeing - the removal of loose or miscellaneous fibers from the surfaces by burning with a flame; de-sizing- the removal of sizing agents, such as starches, via enzymatic soaking, scouring- the removal of greases, oils waxes and fats by contact with a solution of sodium hydroxide at temperatures near boiling; mercerization - the application of high levels of sodium hydroxide in conjunction with stretching and pulling of the fabrics for increased fiber strength.<br>
An additional common pretreatment step involves a bleaching step to destroy naturally occurring color bodies. The bleaching step provides a uniform white appearance for consumer acceptable whites as well as provides a uniform color base for dyeing or printing. Thus, a highly; successful bleaching step is necessary for commercially acceptable consumer fabrics. Traditional textile bleaching of natural fibers has involved the use of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide has gained its wide acceptance due to its flexibility of use being capable in both hot' and rapid or cold and long dwell bleaching processes and due to its environmental friendliness.<br>
While hydrogen peroxide has gained wide spread acceptance in the textile industry, it is not a particularly effective bleaching agent. Hydrogen peroxide, as commercially supplied is an extremely stable compound and as a result has only a slight bleaching effect on natural fibers. To overcome its weak activity, extremely high temperatures and/or extremely long bleaching times are required in commercial processes   in   addition to activation of the peroxide. That is,    temperatures in<br>
excess of 95° C are typically required or reaction times in excess of 20 hours. In addition, activation of the peroxide via the use of alkali, sulfuric acid, uv irradiation, hypochlorite or organic activators is also necessary with alkali being the most preferred. Not only do these drawbacks result in excessive cost associated with commercial textile peroxide bleacliing, but the high temperatures and/or long contact times result in significant fiber damage and strength reduction of the resultant yarns and fabrics.<br>
Organic activators have been attempted in textile bleaching systems to little success. Tetra acetyl ethylene diamine or TAED is a common hydrophilic bleach activator widely accepted in the consumer laundry bleaching applications to provide effective bleaching at lower wash temperatures. TAED has been taught in hydrogen peroxide textile bleaching, and in particular in the bleaching of regenerated cellulosics such as rayon. However, while TAED has allowed lower bleaching temperatures, it has proven to provide little advantage in the liber damage and fiber strength of cellulosics such as rayon. In addition, the poor water solubility of TAED limits its application in textile processing.<br>
Hydrophobic bleach activators, such as nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate, sodium salt (NOBS) have been employed in consumer laundry detergent applications such as Tide® with Bleach to work in conjunction with peroxygen sources to provide activated bleacliing in consumer laundering of garments. Activated bleaching in consumer home laundry conditions allows effective cleaning of certain soils and stains in cold water temperatures. However, the use of hydrophobic systems has been limited m a home consumer laundry environment due to the formation of diacyl peroxides in the wash solution. Diacyl peroxides degrade natural robber components into which they come in contact. Thus, sump hoses, rubber gaskets, etc in laundry machines have prevented explotation of this technology in certain geographies.<br>
The severe conditions employed in the bleaching of textiles have heretofore prevented the successful application of laundry detergent bleaching technology in textile mill applications. Indeed, EP 584,710 discloses the use of activated bleaching in textile mill applications wherein NOBS is briefly disclosed along with a multitude of other classes and types of activators. While NOBS is disclosed, there is no successful application of hydrophobic bleaching technology where acceptable whiteness values are achieved while damage to fabrics and fibers is minimized. Indeed, •EP 584.710 specifics that in order to achieve acceptable whiteness benefits, additional alkali bleaching is necessary which will dramatically increase fiber damage.<br>
Typical peroxide based textile bleaching systems involve the hot batch, continuous or cold batch processing. Hot batch and continuous peroxide bleaching both involve the application of peroxide bleaching solutions at highly elevated temperature (in excess of 95 °C). These elevated temperatures provide acceptable whiteness profiles on the treated fabrics and have a high throughput due to short reaction times, typically 60 minutes or less. However, hot temperature processing, while being very effective, has the significant drawbacks of higher energy and cost due to the extreme temperatures required expensive specialized processing equipment and importantly, increased fiber damage due to the aggressive conditions.<br>
In contrasts to these drawbacks, cold batch processing involves the saturation of a textile with a peroxide based solution followed by a long reaction time (more than 20 hours) at room temperature. While cold batch processing solves the aforementioned problems of fiber damage and elevated cost due to energy and specialized equipment, cold batch brings the significant disadvantages of an inability to achieve acceptable whiteness profiles thereby limiting its usefulness to dyed fabrics rather than white fabrics as well as very low throughput due to the long reaction times necessary.<br>
Accordingly, the need remains for an effective textile treatment process which will provide acceptable whiteness profiles and shorter reaction times in room temperature cold batch bleaching.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the cold batch preparation of a non finished textile component comprising the steps of providing a non-finished textile component, saturating said textile component with an aqueous bleaching solution comprising hydrogen peroxide, 10 to about 50 g/L of sodium hydroxide, and a hydrophobic bleaching agent, and allowing said bleaching solution to remain in contact with said textile component for a period of time between 1 and 16 hours at a temperature of less than 35 °C.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method for improving the wettability loss of textile components comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	providing an incoming non-finished woven fabric;<br>
b)	saturating said fabric to an aqueous bleaching solution, said bleaching<br>
solution comprising a mixture of hydrogen peroxide, from 10 to about 50 g/L of<br>
sodium hydroxide and a hydrophobic bleach activator or a 30 pre-formed<br>
hydrophobic activator, holding said bleaching solution to a temperature less than<br>
35 °C. and allowing said bleaching solution to contact said fabric for a period of<br>
time of from about 1 to about 15 hours.<br>
This need is met by the present invention wherein a method for the cold batch treatment of textiles using activated peroxygen bleaching with hydrophobic bleaching systems is provided. The process involves the use of a hydrogen peroxide and a hydrophobic bleach activator or a hydrophobic peracid. The use of a hydrophobic bleaching agent provides superior whiteness at the low temperatures of cold batch treatment. In addition, the use of the present invention allows for a significant reduction in the amount of time needed to achieve satisfactory bleaching.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the hydrophobic bleaching agent of the present invention provide better absorbency on the fabrics and yarns and better "wetting" of the surface of the fibers than conventional peroxide bleaching techniques or hydrophilic activators. Hydrophobic bleach activators form the active bleaching species, peracid, on the surface of the fabric allowing a longer time on the surface of the fabric. Hydrophilic activators meanwhile form peracid in solution and must then undergo a fabric solution interaction which is less efficient. As a result, the hydrophobic bleaching agents of the present invention provide superior bleaching and whiteness while minimizing fiber damage and strength reduction.<br>
According to a first embodiment of the present invention, a method for the cold batch bleaching of non-finished textile components is provided. The method comprises the steps of providing a non-finished textile component such as a fiber, yarn or fabric, saturating the textile component with an aqueous bleaching solution comprising hydrogen peroxide and a hydrophobic bleaching agent such as a hydrophobic activator or a pre-formed hydrophobic peracid, and allowing the bleaching solution to remain in contact with the textile component at a temperature of less than about 35° C for a period of time of from about 1 to about 16 hours, more preferably from about 2

Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for the cold batch bleaching of textile components such as fibers, yams and fabrics which provides superior whiteness at much shorter reaction times than conventional processing. Tliese, and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and the appended claims.<br>
All percentages, ratios and proportions herein arc on a 100% weight basis unless otherwise indicated. All documents cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments According to the present invention, a superior cold batch textile treatment process for libers, yams and fabrics, both knitted and woven, is provided. The present invention provides a<br>
cost effective and superior performing alternative to the conventional cold batch processing. The present invention involves the use of a hydrophobic bleaching agent such as an activator or peractd in conjunction with peroxide for the bleaching of non-finished textile components. These hydrophobic bleaching species provide superior results in the context of textile wliiteness and in fabric, strength retention. While conventional cold batch textile bleaching require reaction times in excessive of 16 hours and more typically around 20-24 hours and in many cases are still unable to achieve satisfactory whiteness values of more than 70 on the CTE whiteness index, the method of the present invention requires reaction times of 16 hours or less and more preferably of 12 hours or less and in preferred embodiments arc able to provide whiteness values of more than 70.<br>
The present invention involves the use of an aqueous bleaching solution of hydrogen peroxide and a hydrophobic bleaching species such as a hydrophobic activator or a pre-formed hydrophobic peracid. The hydrogen peroxide or pre-formed peracid is present in the bleaching solution of the present invention at levels of from about 1 to about 50 g/L, more preferably from about 5 to about 40 g/L and most preferably from about 10 to about 25 g/L. The hydrophobic activator is then employed at molar ratios of activator to peroxide of from about 1:1 to about 1:50, more preferably from about T2 to about 130 and even more preferably from about 1:3 to about 1:15.<br>
Particularly useful and preferred is the combination of hydrogen peroxide and hydrophobic bleach activators, and in particular the alkanoyloxy class of bleach activators having the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is an alkyl chain having from about 5 to about 17, preferably from about 7 to about 11 carbon atoms and L can be essentially any suitable leaving group. A leaving group is any group that is displaced from the bleaching activator as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack on the bleach activator by the perhydroxide anion. This, the perhydrolysis reaction, results in the formation of the peroxycarboxylic acid. Generally, for a group to be a suitable leaving group it must exert an electron attracting effect. It should also form a stable entity so that the rate of the back reaction is negligible. This facilitates the nucleophilic attack by the perhydroxide anion<br>
The L group must be sufficiently reactive for the reaction to occur within the optimum time frame (e.g., a wash cycle). However, if L is too reactive, this activator will be difficult to stabilize for use in a bleaching composition. These characteristics are generally paralleled by the<br>
pKa of the conjugate acid of the leaving group, although exceptions to this convention are known. Ordinarily, leaving groups that exhibit such behavior arc those in which their conjugate acid has a pKa in the range of from about 4 to about 13, preferably from about 6 to about ] 1 and most preferably from about 8 to about 11 For the purposes of the present invention, L is selected from the group consisting of: <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and mixtures thereof, wherein R   is an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about. 1 to<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
about 14 carbon atoms, R   is an alkyl chain containing from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, R   is H<br>
or R", and Y is H or a solubilizing group.<br>
The preferred solubilizing groups are -SO3~M , -CO2~M . -SO4-M , -N+ ("R3 )4X and<br>

bleach activator and X is an anion which provides solubility to the bleach activator.  Preferably,<br>
M is an alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium cation, with sodium and potassium being most preferred, and X is a halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate or acetate anion. It. should be noted that bleach activators with a leaving group that does not contain a solubilizing groups should be well dispersed in the bleaching solution in order to assist in their dissolution.<br>

to about 14 carbon atoms. R   is H or an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about 1 to<br>
about 10 carbon atoms and L is a leaving group as defined above.<br>
Preferred bleach activators are those of the above, general formula are wherein R   is an<br>
2 alkyl group containing from about 6 to about 12 carbon atoms: R   contains from about 1 to<br>

The method of the present invention involves providing a non-finished textile component into the bleaching solution as described. The textile component may comprise fibers, yams and fabrics including wovens, nonwovens and knits By non-finished, it is intended that the textile component be a material that has not been dyed, printed, or otherwise provided a finishing step such as durable press finish. Of course, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the textile component of the present, invention are those that have not been passed through a garment or other manufacturing process involving cutting and sewing of the material.<br>
The cold batch process of the present invention involves pumping the bleaching solution of the present invention into a padding trough and passing a textile component such as a fabric through the trough to saturate the fabric with the bleaching solution. Padding temperatures range from 10 to about 90° C with about 10 to about 50° C being more preferred and from about 20 to about 40° C being most preferred. While fabric pick up of the bleaching solution varies by fabric, typical wet pick up of bleach solution on the fabric ranges from about 50% to about 200% on weight of the fabric, more preferably from about 50% to about 150% and most preferably from about 70% to about 130% by weight on fabric.<br>
Once saturated, the fabric is rolled on a beam, wrapped and treated on a frame for the desired period of time at room remperaturc. Preferred frames include a rotating A frame and fabric rolls are rotated at specified times to ensure even distribution of the bleaching solution. Rotation times typically are from about 2 to about 8 hours. Following the requisite treatment time, the treated textile is washed to remove the bleaching solution. One of ordinary skill in the art will of course recognize that conventional cold batch processing equipment may be employed in the method of the present invention.<br>
The present process may be employed with most any natural material including cellulosics such as cotton, linen and regenerated cellulosics such as rayon and iyoceli.

The de-sizing step of the present invention involves the removal of sizing agents such as starch and polyvmyl alcohol added to yarns before weaving of fabrics. The de-sizing step involves the use of an aqueous solution of amylase enzymes and typically wetting agents and salts and soaking or contacting the fabrics with the enzymatic solution of a time sufficient to remove the sizing agents.<br>
The scouring step of the present invention involves the removal of natural or synthetic impurities from the textiles such as waxes and oils. The scouring step involves the use of an aqueous alkaline bath, typically sodium hydroxide at elevated temperatures. Optional ingredients in the alkaline bath include wetting agents and chelating agents.<br>
The mercerization step of the present invention involves the application of high concentrations of alkali such as sodium hydroxide in conjunction with stretching and pulling of the textiles to restore fiber strengtli and improve luster while singeing involves passing the textiles over an open flame to remove loose fibers or strands. De-sizing, scouring, mercerization and singeing arc well known to one of ordinary skill in the art and will be well recognized and within the level of skill of the artisan.<br>
Of course the process of the present invention includes in the preferred applications a washing step or series of washing steps following the method of the present invention. Washing of<br>
treated textiles is well known and within the level of skill of the artisan. Washing stages will be typically present after each of the de-sizing, scouring and. mercerization steps when present, as well as after the bleaching step of the present invention. Washing of treated textiles of the present invention may be performed in known washing equipment such as a jet washing machine. Wasliing typically involves multiple washings at elevated temperatures followed by step-wise reduction of ihe temperatures and times across the stages, eg. approx 80° C for 10 minutes to approx. 70° C for 10 minutes to approx. 28° C for 3 minutes to approx. 70° C for 5 minutes. In addition, various additives such as chelants and acidic reagents may be added to the rinse solutions if desired. Lastly, tlve bleaching, de-sizing scouring or mercerization steps when present may in preferred embodiments include a wet-out or prc-wctting step to ensure even or uniform wettness in the textile component.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, fiber degradation or damage is based on fluidity as measured via AATCC test method 82-1996 involving the dispersion of the fibers in cupricthylcne diamine (CP). An increase in fluidity between treated fibers and non-treated fibers represents an increase in the amount of fiber damage. Tlve method employed is outlined as follows. A representative sample of fibers of about 1.5 nun is cut and dissolved in CP as defined by the equation CP=120 x sample weight x 0.98 in a specimen bottle with several glass balls, placed under nitrogen. The bottle is shaken for approximately 2 hours   Additional CP is added as defined by the equation CP=80 x sample weight x 0.98 followed by additional shaking under nitrogen for three hours. Following dissolution, the solution is placed under constant stirring to prevent separation of the dispersion. The solution is then measured in a calibrated Oswald Canon Fcnskc viscometer in a constant temperature bath of 25° C to determine the efflux time. Efflux time is determined by drawing the fluid to a mark between 2 bulbs and measuring the lime required for the meniscus to pass from the mark between the bulbs to the mark below the lower bulb. The average of two times is used. Fluidity is then calculated from the formula F=l 00/ctd, where c = viscometer constant, t = efflux time and d = density of the solution 1.052.<br>
