				<td>ORODISPERSIBLE TABLETS CONTAINING FEXOFENADINE.<br>
Field of the Invention.<br>
The present invention concerns orodispersible tablets comprising<br>
coated granules of fexofenadine. The invention also concerns said coated<br>
granules of fexofenadine, a process for the preparation thereof and the use of<br>
said orodispersible tablets.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "orodispersible<br>
tablets" means tablets which are able to disintegrate in the buccal cavity in less<br>
than 60 seconds, preferably in less than 40 seconds, upon contact with saliva<br>
by formation of an easy-to-swallow suspension.<br>
The disintegration time corresponds to the time between the<br>
moment when the tablet is placed in the buccal cavity in contact with saliva and<br>
the moment when the suspension (resulting from the disintegration without<br>
chewing of the tablet) is swallowed<br>
Background of the invention.<br>
Fexofenadine is a well known synthetic antiallergenic with the<br>
chemical name (±)-4-[1-hydroxy-4-[4(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-l-piperidinyl]-<br>
butyl]-?,?-dimethyl benzeneacetic acid.<br>
Fexofenadine, a metabolite of terfenadine, is an antihistamine with<br>
selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonist activity.<br>
Fexofenadine is known from e.g. US 4,254,129. It is<br>
acknowledged in the art and is commercially available, in particular as an oral<br>
tablet or capsule, under the trade name Allegra®.<br>
The tablets, commercially available under the trade name Allegra®<br>
contain 30, 6.0, or 180 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride (depending on the<br>
dosage) and, as excipients, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose and pregelatinized starch. Said tablets are coated<br>
with a film coating based on hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, mixture of iron<br><br>
oxides, polyethylene glycol, povidone, silicone dioxide, and titanium<br>
dioxide.<br>
Fexofenadine is highly active via oral administration. While<br>
numerous pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration have been<br>
proposed, there still exists a need for commercially acceptable fexofenadine<br>
formulations for oral administration with good patient convenience and<br>
acceptance, especially for children or the elderly.<br>
One particular difficulty in the formulation of fexofenadine in oral<br>
pharmaceutical compositions is its unpleasant, strong bitter taste and<br>
aftertaste.<br>
Another difficulty in the formulation of fexofenadine in oral<br>
pharmaceutical compositions is the low solubility of fexofenadine, especially in<br>
gastric conditions (solubility of 0.2 mg of fexofenadine HCI per ml of pH 1.2<br>
aqueous buffer solution).<br>
It is therefore highly desirable to develop coated granules,<br>
containing fexofenadine, which have taste-masking properties while permitting<br>
rapid release of the active substance from the granules and allowing rapid<br>
absorption in the body after oral administration.<br>
Furthermore, some patients, especially children and the elderly,<br>
experience difficulties swallowing the tablets, even with liquids.<br>
It is estimated that 50% of the population have problems<br>
swallowing the tablets. This leads to poor, or even noncompliance, with the<br>
treatment and thus has a negative impact on the efficiency of the treatment (H.<br>
Seager, 1998, J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 50, 375-382).<br>
Oral disintegrate multiparticulate tablets have already been<br>
described in US 5.464,632, US 6,106,861, WO 00/27357 and WO00/51568,<br>
the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The active<br>
ingredient is in the form of coated microcrystals or coated microgranules.<br><br>
Up to now, no oral formulations of fexofenadine exist which are<br>
specifically suitable for patients having difficulties when swallowing or for<br>
patients taking the drugs with no liquids.<br>
It is thus highly desirable to remedy this situation and to develop<br>
an orodispersible tablet, containing fexofenadine,, which has taste-masking<br>
properties and presents a pleasant payability such that the administration of<br>
the tablet is not unpleasant for the patient and which allows the obtaining of<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters at least bioequivaient to those which are obtained<br>
with conventional oral formulations of fexofenadine, for example tablets such as<br>
those available under the trademark Allegra® .<br>
The Applicant has now surprisingly found that these<br>
characteristics can be obtained by formulating a tablet containing fexofenadine<br>
as active ingredient in the form of coated granules, and a mixture of excipients<br>
containing at least one disintegrating agent, a soluble diluent agent and a<br>
lubricant, and optionally a swelling agent, an antistatic agent, a permeabilising<br>
agent, sweeteners, flavoring agents and colors.<br>
The present invention relates to orodispersible tablets which are<br>
able to disintegrate in the buccal cavity upon contact with saliva by formation of<br>
an easy-to-swallow suspension, in less than 60 seconds, preferably in less than<br>
40 seconds, such tablets containing fexofenadine as active ingredient in the<br>
form of coated granules, and a mixture of excipients comprising at least one<br>
disintegrating agent, a soluble diluent agent, a lubricant and optionally a<br>
swelling agent, an antistatic agent, a permeabilising agent, sweeteners,<br>
flavoring agents and colors.<br>
Surprisingly, although the tablets according to the invention<br>
disintegrate in the buccal cavity and present a release of the active ingredient<br>
which is equivalent to the conventional formulation, they nevertheless have a<br>
pleasant taste.<br><br>
Furthermore, the orodispersible tablets of the invention are found<br>
to show high stability and physical integrity, e.g. during storage, handling,<br>
packaging and the like, while maintaining very good disintegration performance.<br>
Fexofenadine may be used in the form of its racemate or a single<br>
enantiomer, in free base form or in acid addition salt form of the racemate or<br>
one of its single enantiomers. An acid addition salt form may be prepared from<br>
the free base form in a conventional manner and vice-versa. Examples of<br>
suitable acid addition salt forms include hydrochloride, lactate and ascorbate,<br>
preferably hydrochloride. Fexofenadine in the form of a hydrochloride salt is<br>
preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, fexofenadine particles present a<br>
particle size such that 100% of the particles have an average size of less than<br>
20pm.<br>
In the tablets according to the invention, fexofenadine in anyone<br>
of said forms is present as coated granules.<br>
In the present-patent application, the term "fexofenadine" is<br>
employed for designating anyone of its specific forms.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the tablet according<br>
to the invention, has a hardness of not less than 15 N, when measured with the<br>
test method of the European Pharmacopeia (2.9.8).<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the tablet according<br>
to the invention contains coated granules of fexofenadine, or one of its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and a mixture of excipients, the ratio of the<br>
mixture of excipients to the coated granules is 0.4 to 9, preferably 1.5 to 5 and<br>
even more preferably 2 to 3 parts by weight, the mixture of excipients<br>
comprising:<br>
- at least one disintegrating agent,<br>
- a soluble diluent agent,<br>
- a lubricant,<br><br>
and optionally a permeabilising agent, a swelling agent, an antistatic agent,<br>
sweeteners, flavoring agents and colors.<br>
The disintegrating agent is selected from the group consisting of<br>
croscarmellose, available as e.g. Ac-di-sol®, crospovidone available as e.g.<br>
Kollidon CL®, and mixtures thereof.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the<br>
soluble diluent agent used in the tablets presents binding properties. The<br>
soluble diluent agent with binding properties consists of a polyol having less<br>
than 13 carbon atoms and being either in the form of a directly compressible<br>
product with an average particle size of 100 to 500 µm, or in the form of a<br>
powder with an average particle size of less than 100 µm, this polyol preferably<br>
being selected from the group comprising mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol and maltitol,<br>
it being understood that sorbitol cannot be used alone and that, in the case<br>
where there is only one soluble diluent agent with binding properties, it is used<br>
in the form of the directly compressible product, whereas in the case where<br>
there are at least two soluble diluent agents with binding properties, one is<br>
present in the directly compressible form and the other is present in powder<br>
form, it then being possible for the polyols to be the same, the ratio of directly<br>
compressible polyol to powder polyol being 99/1 to 20/80, preferably 80/20 to<br>
20/80.<br>
The proportion of disintegrating agent is from 3 to 15% by weight,<br>
preferably 5 to 15% by weight, in the case of a mixture, each disintegrating<br>
agent being comprised between 1 and 10% by weight, preferably 5 to 10 % by<br>
weight, and the proportion of soluble diluent agent being 30 to 90% by weight,<br>
preferably 40 to 60% by weight, based in each case on the weight of the tablet.<br>
The lubricant is selected from the group consisting of magnesium<br>
stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, micronised<br>
polyoxyethyleneglycol (micronised Macrogol 6000), leukine, sodium benzoate<br>

The amount of lubricant is from 0 to 3 %, preferably from 1 to 2 %<br>
by weight, based on the weight of the tablet.<br>
The lubricant can be dispersed within the mixture of excipients, or<br>
according to an advantageous embodiment, sprayed over the outer surface of<br>
the tablet. Thus, according to an advantageous embodiment of the tablets of<br>
the invention, the lubricant is in powder form and is, at least in part, disposed<br>
on the surface of the tablets.<br>
The permeabilising agent allows the creation of a hydrophilic<br>
network which facilitates the penetration of saliva and hence assists the<br>
disintegration of the tablet.<br>
The permeabilising agent is selected from the group comprising<br>
especially silica with a high affinity for aqueous solvents, such as colloidal silica<br>
(Aerosil®), precipitated silica (Syloid® FP 244), maltodextrins, ?-cyclodextrins<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of permeabilising agent is between 0 and 5%,<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 2% by weight, based on the weight of the tablet.<br>
A swelling agent can be incorporated in the mixture of excipients.<br>
Said swelling agent is selected from the group consisting of starch, modified<br>
starch or microcristalline cellulose.<br>
An antistatic agent can be incorporated as a flow aid, said<br>
antistatic agent being selected from the group consisting of micronised or non<br>
micronised talc, fumed silica (Aerosil® R972), colloidal silica (Aerosil®200),<br>
precipitated silica (SyloTd® FP 244), and mixtures thereof.<br>

The flavorings and colors are those conventionally used in<br>
pharmacy for the preparation of tablets.<br><br>
The present invention also relates to the coated granules of<br>
fexofenadine or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The taste-masking of fexofenadine is achieved by coating<br>
granulated microcrystals of fexofenadine with one or more polymers.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the<br>
granules of fexofenadine, or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are<br>
characterized in that the granules are coated and that they contain:<br>
- microcrystals of fexofenadine, or one of its pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts,<br>

The diluent agent is selected from the group consisting of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, sucrose, dicalcium phosphate, starches, lactose and<br>
polyols of less than 13 carbon atoms, such as mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable aminoacids, such as glycin, and their mixtures.<br>
The antistatic agent, which can be used as (low aid, is selected<br>
from the group consisting of micronised or non micronised talc, fumed silica<br><br>
(Aerosil® R972), colloidal silica (Aerosil®200), precipitated silica (Syloid®<br>
FP244) and mixtures thereof.<br>
Conventional pharmaceutically acceptable sweetening agents<br>
and/or colouring agents can be incorporated into the granules of fexofenadine.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the granule of fexofenadine or one of<br>
its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, is in the form of a core of granulated<br>
microcrystals of fexofenadine, coated with at least one layer comprising<br>
fexofenadine.<br>
Said coated core is characterized in that the core and the layer<br>

comprise:<br>
- from 10% to 95%, preferably from 50% to 70% of fexofenadine, or one of<br>
the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof,<br>
at most 20%, preferably at most 10% by weight of the binder, relative to the<br>
weight of fexofenadine, or one of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
thereof,<br>
- .at most 5%, preferably 2% by weight of the antistatic agent, relative to the<br>
weight of said granules<br>
- optionally a diluent agent for the balance to 100%.<br>
In order to ensure efficient taste masking, and a dissolution profile<br>
of the active substance such that more than 70% of the active substance is<br>
released in 30 minutes, preferably more than 90% is released in 30 minutes,<br>
the granules are coated with a coating composition containing at least one<br>
coating polymer selected from the group consisting of cellulosic polymers,<br>
acrylic polymers and their mixtures.<br><br>
Among the cellulosic polymers, ethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), are<br>

The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
coated granules of fexofenadine, which comprises the successive steps<br>
consisting in:<br>
dry mixing the microcrystals of fexofenadine or one of its pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts optionally with an antistatic agent and/or a diluent agent ;<br>
"granulating the mixture obtained in the above step by spraying of a solution<br>
or suspension of at least one binder,<br>
optionally applying a layer over the thus obtained granules by spraying<br>
thereon a suspension, or a solution comprising fexofenadine, or one of its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts with at least one binder,<br>
coating the thus obtained granules with a suspension of a coating<br>
composition,<br>
drying the thus obtained coated granules.<br>
The invention also concerns a process for preparing<br>
orodispersible tablets comprising coated granules of fexofenadine, or one of its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The process comprises the successive steps consisting in :<br>
dry mixing the microcrystals of fexofenadine, or one of its pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, optionally with an antistatic agent, a diluent agent, a<br>
permeabilising agent, a sweetening agent and/or a coloring agent ;<br><br>
granulating the thus obtained mixture by spraying thereon a solution or a<br>
suspension of at least one binder,<br>
optionally applying a layer over the thus obtained granules by spraying<br>
thereon a suspension, or a solution comprising fexofenadine, or one of its<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts with at least one binder.<br>
