SYNERGISTIC INSECTICIDAL COMPOSmONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Although insecticidal agents and compositions have been developed to control insect pests such as agrohorticultural pests or hygienic pests, and in practice have been used as a single or a mixed agent, economically efficient and ecologically safe insect control compositions are still being sought. Insecticidal compositions which allow for reduced effective dosage rates, increased environmental safety and lower the incidence of insect resistance are highly desirable. The rotational application of insect control agents having different modes of action may be adopted for good pest management practice, however, this approach does not necessarily give satisfactory insect control. Combinations of insect control agents have been studied, however, a high synergistic action has not always been found. Obtaining an insecticidal composition which demonstrates no cross-resistance to existing insecticidal agents, no toxicity problems and little negative impact on the environment is extremely difficult.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide a synergistic insecticidal composition which demonstrates a high controlling effect with concomittant reduced crop production cost and reduced environmental load.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide methods for synergistic insect control and enhanced crop protection.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a synergistic insecticidal composition comprising as essential active ingredients a synergisticaliy effective amount of a neuronal sodium channel antagonist and an aryipyrrole insecticide.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for synergistic insect control which comprises contacting said insect with a synergisticaliy effective amount of a combination of a neuronal sodium channel antagonist and an aryipyrrole insecticide.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for the enhanced protection of plants from infestation and attack by insects.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
When two or more substances in combination demonstrate unexpectedly high biological activity, for example, insecticidal activity, the resulting phenomenon may be referred to as synergism. The mechanism of synergism is not fully understood, and quite possibly may differ with different combinations. However, the tenn "synergism" as used in this application designates a cooperative action encountered in a combination of two or more biologically active components in which the combined activity of the two or more components exceeds the sum of the activity of each component alone.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that a composition which comprises a combination of a neuronal sodium channel antagonist and an aryipyrrole insecticide provides superior insect control at lower levels of the combined active agents than may be achieved when the neuronal sodium channel antagonist or the aryipyrrole insecticide is applied alone.<br><br>
As used in this application, the term neuronal sodium channel antagonist designates a compound which is capable of preventing the ability of a neuron cell to transfer sodium ions across the cell membrane. A neuron cell thus affected is unable to fire, resulting in paralysis, and ultimately mortality, in the target host. Descriptions of neuronal sodium channel antagonists and their mode of action may be found in Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology, 60:177-185 or Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology, 37: 91-103, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

These and other advantages of the invention may become more apparent from the examples set forth herein below. These examples are provided merely as illustrations of the invention and are not intended to be construed as a limitation thereof.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Evaluation of the Synergistic Insecticidal Effect Of A Combination Of A Neuronal Sodium Channel Antagonist Plus An Arvlpvrrole Insecticide<br>
In this evaluation, the Heliothis zea (cotton bollworm), Heliothis virescens (tobacco budwomn) and pyrethroid-resistant Heliothis virescens larvae used are obtained from laboratory colonies. Pyrethroid-resistant H. virescens are derived from the PEG-strain [Campannola &amp; Plapp, Proceedings of Beltwide Cotton Conference (1988)].<br>
Cotton leaves are immersed in 1:1 v/v, acetone/water solutions of test compound, or solutions of a combination of test compounds for a period of about 3 seconds. Following immersion, leaves are allowed to air-dry for 2-3 hours. Plastic bioassay trays containing multiple open-faced wells (4.0 X 4.0 x 2.5 cm) are used as the test arenas. Cut portions of a treated leaf, a moistened cotton dental wick and a single third-instar larva are placed into each well, covered with an adhesive vented clear plastic sheet and held under constant fluorescent light at about 27Â°C for a predetermined period of time. Larval mortality/morbidity is evaluated at 5 days after treatment. All treatments are replicated 4-5 fold in a randomized complete block design with 16-32 larvae per treatment. A log-probit analysis is applied to all data obtained. The results are summarized in Tables I, II and III hereinbelow.<br><br><br><br>
