				<td>-4JN0Eft-9ADDLE-eOMPAR-TMENT OF-VARIABLE SIZE IN-A-VEHICLE OF-MOTORCYCLE TYPE-<br>
This invention relates to an under-saddle compartment of variable size in a vehicle of motorcycle type, in particular a scooter. In vehicles of motorcycle type, for example scooters, it is known to provide below the saddle a loading compartment in which the helmet and other objects are positioned. To achieve this, the saddle is hinged at or close to one end to the frame and can* be rotated from its lowered utilization position to a raised position to uncover an upper opening in said compartment for locating the load.<br>
To accommodate the helmet or other objects of a certain size, the compartment must be of appropriate dimensions. For this purpose the compartment must have a certain depth below the saddle, but this is hindered by the fact that the engine and the other mechanical drive parts are located below the saddle. A current solution to the aforestated technical size problem is to provide a saddle which is raised to a particularly high level above the frame. This enables the engine and mechanical parts to be left in the appropriate position, while being able to accommodate objects, including the helmet, of large overall<br><br>
dimensions.<br>
A saddle positioned at a high level in this manner is not always comfortable for the user, given the variety and type of user concerned. Moreover a high saddle certainly does not facilitate driving, even for the expert driver, and does not enable the feet to be rested on the ground with safety. In view of this it could be important to be able to adjust the saddle in height. In addition, for housing the helmet when not in use, it is important to have available a compartment which is not bulky and does not excessively project from the vehicle frame during driving.<br>
An object of this invention is consequently to provide a solution to the technical problem of compartment bulk and consequently to that of the positioning of the overlying saddle. A further object is to provide an under-saddle compartment in a vehicle of motorcycle type which also overcomes those problems of the known art concerned with bulk and uncomfortable driving. These objects are attained according to the invention by providing in a vehicle of motorcycle type an under-saddle compartment of variable size contained within a structural portion of the vehicle, in which there is provided a seat rotatable at one end relative to said structural portion about a hinge between a position of closure of said compartment and a rotated position in which an upper opening in said compartment is uncovered, characterised in that said hinge comprises two parts, at least one of which is movable relative to said structural portion and/or to said seat against an elastic counteracting element, said hinge<br><br>
Parts varying their withdrawal from and/or approach to said structural portion so as to vary the capacity of said under-saddle compartment.<br>
Furthermore, on said movable hinge part, spacer elements can be positioned to vary the position of said seat relative to a base of said compartment. This can be advantageously done directly by the driver.<br>
Accordingly   the   present   invention   relates   to   an   under—saddle compartment   of variable   size   in   a  vehicle   of  motorcycle   type, contained within a structural portion (11) of the vehicle, in which there is provided a seat (13) rotatable at one end relative to said structural portion (11) about a hinge between a position of closure of said compartment (12) and a rotated position in which an upper opening in said compartment (12) is uncovered, wherein said hinge comprises two parts (14, 17), at least one of which is movable relative to said structural portion (11) and/or to said seat (13) against elastic counteracting element, said hinge parts (14, 17) varying their position in terms of withdrawal from and/or approach to said structural portion (11) so as to vary the capacity of said under —saddle compartment (12).<br><br>
The characteristics and advantages of an under-saddle compartment of variable size in a vehicle of motorcycle type according to the present invention will be more apparent from the following description given by way of non-limiting example with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, on which: Figure 1 is an elevational section through a portion of a scooter in correspondence with the under-saddle compartment of variable size according to the invention, shown in its lowered rest position by full lines, and shown with the saddle raised by dashed<br>
and dotted lines.<br>
Figure 2 is an elevational section similar to Figure 1 in which<br>
the saddle is in its raised position with the under-saddle<br>
compartment at maximum capacity and carrying a helmet or possibly<br>
another object;<br>
Figure 3 is an enlarged elevational section of a detail shown in<br>
Figure 1, in its rest position;<br>
Figure 4 is an enlarged elevational section of a detail shown in<br>
Figure 2, in the position in which the under-saddle compartment is<br>
of maximum capacity; and<br>
Figure 5 is an enlarged elevational section of the detail shown in<br><br>
Figure 3, in a position selected and set by the user. Figures 1 and 2 show an under-saddle compartment of variable size in a vehicle of motorcycle type, of which only a structural portion is shown, indicated by 11, and is formed in accordance with the invention.<br>
The structural portion 11 is shaped to define an under-saddle compartment or housing 12 within the vehicle structure to receive a helmet 29 or any other object. The structural portion 11 comprises at one end a hinge for a seat 13 which upperly closes the compartment.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the hinge comprises, rigid with the seat 13, a hinge part consisting of a downwardly extending arm 14 carrying a hole for a pin 15 at its free end. The pin 15, which forms the connection to the second hinge part, is inserted into a hole in an enlarged free end 16 of a shaft 17 which acts as a guide element. The shaft 17 is slidingly guided within a slide element, such as a holed bush 18 located in an upper part of the structural portion 11.<br>
The other end of the shaft 17 is threaded and comprises a nut with washer 19 acting as a counteracting element for a spiral spring 20 positioned between the nut and the structural portion 11 in the vicinity of the bush 18. Arranged in this manner, the spring 20 maintains the shaft 17 in a lowered position within the structural portion 11, dragging with it the seat connected by the pin 15. The hinge is hence composed of two parts, at least one of which is movable relative to the structural portion or seat against an elastic counteracting element, to vary their position away from<br><br>
and/or towards the structural portion so as to vary the capacity<br>
of the vehicle under-saddle compartment.<br>
This hinge could instead comprise two of the aforedescribed<br>
elements, ie two shafts 17 slidable within respective holed bushes<br>
18 and connected to two respective arms 14 rigid with the seat.<br>
The hinge is located within a first end part of the seat, its<br>
second end part being provided with a lock rigid with the seat.<br>
This lock comprises an operating element 21, such as a pin<br>
rotatable from the outside by a key, to act on a crank lever 22.<br>
The lever 22, which is rotatable and at least partially secured to<br>
the seat, rigidly carries a ring or hook 23 which, when rotated,<br>
engages a series of spaced-apart teeth 24 rigid with that<br>
structural portion inwardly to the side of the under-saddle<br>
compartment.	*<br>
This engagement ensures closure of the under-saddle compartment 12 by locking the seat in the required position selected by the user. In the first end part, the seat can comprise a downwardly directed extension 25 which provides closure of the under-saddle compartment even when the seat is raised, as shown in Figure 2. In the second end part a downwardly directed second extension 26<br>
is similarly provided to ensure reliable closure of the vehicle<br>
12<br>
under-saddle compartment/while at the same time being able to be used as a gripping element. A bearing pad 27 can also be provided to receive the weight of the driver when the seat is in its lowered position.<br>
Figures 1-4 also clarify the operation of the arrangement of the. invention when applied to a vehicle of motorcycle type.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the seat 13 arranged in its completely lowered<br>
12 position, when the under-saddle compartment/is empty and without a<br>
helmet 29 or other object.<br>
It can hence be seen that during driving, the seat is in its<br>
totally lowered position, the shaft 17 being totally contained<br>
within the structural portion 11, with its enlarged head 16<br>
abutting against the top of the structural portion.<br>
At the second end part, with the seat 13 in this lowered position<br>
its lower surface bears on the pad 27 to support the weight of the<br>
driver. From this position the seat 13 can be rotated through a<br>
certain angle at choice into a raised position, as shown in Figure<br>
1 by dashed and dotted lines, to completely uncover an upper<br>
opening in the compartment 12.<br>
Having inserted the helmet 29 into the under-saddle compartment<br>
12, the seat 13 can be again made to close the compartment 12<br>
containing it. The actual height of the helmet 29 causes the seat<br>
to rise by virtue of the sliding of the shaft or shafts 17 within<br>
the bush or bushes 18. This sliding is achieved by overcoming the<br>
action of the respective spring 20, which is compressed between<br>
the structural portion 11 and the nut-washer 19.<br>
To securely fasten the under-saddle compartment 12, the lock<br>
provided for this purpose in the second end part, below the seat,<br>
is operated.<br>
For this, the operating element 21 is rotated to disengage or<br>
release the crank lever 22. By rotating, the lever 22 enables the<br>
ring or hook 23 to engage one of the teeth 24 rigid with the<br>
structural portion inwardly to the side of the compartment. In<br><br>
this case, in general the ring 23 engages the highest tooth 24, to<br>
lock the seat in a raised position, with the compartment<br>
containing the helmet 29 (Figure 4).<br>
The seat hence becomes positioned as shown in Figure 2 with the<br>
helmet contained in the under-saddle compartment 12, which is<br>
securely fastened.<br>
To remove the helmet the reverse operation to that described is<br>
performed.<br>
Figure 5 shows how the user or driver, depending on his<br>
requirements, can achieve a seat positioning different from the<br>
limit stop position of the shaft 17 shown in Figures 1 and 3.<br>
For this purpose, washers 28, for example split washers, can be<br>
positioned directly on the shaft 17, to vary the position of the<br>
seat relative to the base of the under-saddle compartment. *<br>
In this manner, by means of the washers, which act as spacers, the'<br>
height of the minimum lowering position of the seat 13 is varied,<br>
as shown in Figure 5. In this respect, it should be noted that<br>
the pad 27 must be replaced by another pad of suitable size to<br>
achieve a horizontal location for the seat.<br>
Consequently, the initial position of the seat can be as required<br>
by the driver, who sets it directly by positioning a certain<br>
number of spacers or washers 28.<br>
Again in this case the seat will rise in position on inserting the<br>
helmet 29 into the under-saddle compartment 12 when the vehicle<br>
has been parked, with the under-saddle compartment offering high<br>
capacity.<br>
The invention hence solves the problem of the required capacity of<br><br>
the under-saddle compartment. In this respect, by virtue of the hinge with slidable guides, once the helmet has been inserted into the compartment the seat rises to provide the required capacity. All this is achieved without influencing the usual overall size of the vehicle and without involving the engine or the mechanical parts connected to it.<br><br><br><br>
