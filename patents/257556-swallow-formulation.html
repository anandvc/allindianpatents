				<td>Oral Therapeutic Compound Delivery System FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to therapeutic formulations. More particularly, the present invention provides an oral delivery system for a therapeutic compound that is a base, a salt of a base, and amphoteric compound or a salt of an amphoteric compound with a pharmacological, physiological or biochemical activity or a proactive form thereof. The present invention even more particularly provides a swallow formulation comprising a therapeutic compound that is a base, a salt of a base, an amphoteric compound or a salt of an amphoteric compound which has exceptionally fast dissolution and thus facilitates the rapid delivery of the therapeutic compound to the circulatory system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
In this specification where a document, act or item of knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference or discussion is not an admission that the document, act or. item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date, publicly available, known to the public, part of common general knowledge; or known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which this specification is concerned.<br>
Improving the rate and extent of absorption of oral formulations of compounds has been the subject of substantial research. In general, once a solid swallow composition reaches the stomach, it undergoes disintegration and/ordissolution and passes into the small intestine where the active ingredient is absorbed across intestinal walls into the circulatory system via the portal vein and liver before reaching the site of action. For some drug absorption is not rate limited, and in this case fast disintegration and fast dissolution of the active ingredient should promote fast absorption in vivo.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration can be categorized into three major groups. Those described as swallow formulations are intended to be swallowed whole. Those described as orally disintegrating or orally dissolving or chewable, are intended to be dispersed or dissolved in the mouth before swallowing. The third group is generally called dispersible or soluble formulations that are intended to be dissolved or dispersed in liquid before administration, such that the patient swallows the resultant solution or dispersion.<br>
Of the group of swallow formulations, some are designed for sustained or delayed release through the use of coatings or other devices that control the site of release of the drug within the gastrointestinal tract. Examples include enteric coated tablets to avoid the local gastric toxicity which occurs with some acidic drugs such as the non-steroidal anti-<br><br>
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and controlled or multiphase release of drugs to allow once daily dosage.<br>
Other swallow formulations may be designed for fast dissolution of the active<br>
ingredient, with the aim of achieving fast absorption and fast onset of action. This present—	<br>
invention relates to formulations manufactured as solid dosage forms intended to be swallowed intact, which will achieve fast dissolution and fast absorption of the active ingredient.<br>
The use of sodium bicarbonate and other alkali metal carbonates has been described for a number of different purposes in pharmaceutical dosage forms.<br>
The use of sodium bicarbonate and other alkali metal carbonates, as the base component of an effervescent couple in dosage forms intended for dissolution or dispersion in water prior to administration, is widely recognised. Typically the resultant effervescent solutions or dispersions exhibit fast absorption of the drug contained therein.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to incorporate the advantages of improved absorption and reproducibility of dispersible and/or soluble formulations into swallow formulations that are more convenient, and remain the preferred dosage form for many patients, particularly for regular use.<br>
Effervescent tablet formulations which are disintegrated and/or dissolved in water prior to administration are well known. Such formulations generally contain effervescent couples such as citric acid and sodium bicarbonate in large amounts. For example, US 6,245,353 describes a tablet containing cetirizine and an effervescent couple for disintegration in water prior to administration. A variety of effervescent formulations which are intended to be dispersed and/or dissolved prior to administration are disclosed for example in US Patent No. 4,704,269, US Patent No. 4,309,408 and US Patent No. 4,942,039.<br>
Some publications teach the inclusion of about 630 mg sodium bicarbonate in swallow tablets so as to provide isotonic conditions in the stomach. US Patent No. 6,316,025, for example describes a swallow tablet of paracetamol containing 300 mg to 1000 mg of sodium bicarbonate per tablet and a paracetamol to sodium bicarbonate ratio of between 0.74 and 1. Grattan et al., Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm 49(3): 225-229,2000, subsequently reported that a formulation with 630 mg sodium bicarbonate provided improved pharmacokinetic outcomes. It was suggested that this was due to an osmotic effect of sodium bicarbonate, which would be isotonic when ingested with lOOmL of water. US Patent Application No. 20040204475 describes a formulation containing sodium bicarbonate and eletnptan. The sodium bicarbonate is administered in an amount to obtain a duodenal concentration approximately isotonic with<br><br>
serum (150 millimoles). The formulations exemplified all contained 630 mg sodium bicarbonate.<br>
US Patent No. 6,699,885 relates to formulations including omeprazole and bicarbonate or carbonate to protect the omeprazole from gastric acid degradation in amounts from about 250 mg to 4,000 mg, thus comprising the major proportion of the tablet by weight.<br>
US Patent Application No. 20050032867 describes a fast disintegrating and dispersing sumatripan formulation comprising about 5 to about 50% by weight base component. The base component of the formulation reacts with the acid component of the stomach, sumatriptan or acid component of the tablet to generate gas so as to facilitate the disintegration and dispersion of the tablet.<br>
It is widely accepted that raising the pH will inhibit the dissolution of basic compounds. WO 2004/017976 describes a fast dissolving and taste masked oral dosage from comprising the basic compound sildenafil. The specification describes the use of any pharmaceutically acceptable pH raising agent to inhibit dissolution of sildenafil, precenting dissolution of sildenafil in the mouth and thus masking the taste of the sildenafil. Agents that raise or increase the pH include sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.<br>
Furthermore, precipitation of the basic compound ondansetron in alkaline solutions containing sodium bicarbonate has been reported (Jaronsinski P F and Hirschfield S, N. Eng. J. Med. 325: 1315-1316,1001).<br>
A relatively large amount of prior art deals with the use of sodium bicarbonate and other pH modulating agents to affect the absorption of acidic drugs, particularly acidic Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and their salts. WO9744023 deals with the use of sodium and potassium bicarbonate to enhance absorption of salts and diclofenac. US patent 4,834,966 and others deals with the use of arginine, ibuprofen and sodium bicarbonate formulations to enhance absorption of ibuprofen. US patent 4704405 deals with the use of sodium sulindac, a base and a bicarbonate to improve absorption of sulindac. The enhanced absorption results from the increased solubility of acidic drugs at elevated pH, owing to greater ionisation of acidic groups. Neuvonen, P.J and Kivisto, K. T. (Clin. Pharmacokinet. 27 (2) 120-8, 1994.) state that several drugs show enhanced absorption in the presence of pH modulating agents such as common antacids of sodium bicarbonate and magnesium hydroxide due to these antacids increasing gastric pH and thus increasing solubility.<br><br>
Dissolution testing provides an in vitro method to predict the absorption of formulations based on in vitro in vivo correlations (IVIVC) which have been well documented (Amidon G L et al, Pharm Res, 1995,12 (3) 413-20, Balan G, et ai, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2001, 90 (8) 1176-1185, Rostami-Hodjegan A et al, DrugDev IndPharm, 2002,28 (5) 533-43). Different dissolution media can be used to simulate drug dissolution in the acidic environment of the stomach and the alkaline environment of the small intestine whence absorption occurs. They can also be used to assess the effect of different formulations in modifying gastric pH and the impact of this on drug dissolution. For fast absorption in vivo, the ideal formulation will release drug quickly into solution in the acidic conditions of the stomach before it transfers to the more alkaline conditions in the small intestine.<br>
Once a swallow formulation has disintegrated, other factors such as the intrinsic solubility and surface area of the drug will determine its rate of dissolution under different pH conditions. The dissolution can be further enhanced if the particle size of the drug is reduced to increase the surface area of the drug available for dissolution. However fast disintegration is not always associated with fast dissolution.<br>
On the basis of these disclosures, it would be expected that the addition of bases such as carbonates to therapeutic compounds that are bases, salts of bases, amphoteric compounds or salts of amphoteric compounds, will reduce their solubility and hence dissolution as a result of the increased pH. Unexpectedly, we have found that for swallow formulations in the case of basic and amphoteric drugs, where increased pH is likely to lead to lower solubility and hence worse dissolution and absorption, the use of pH modulating agents can still achieve increased dissolution and potentially increased absorption. Furthermore if a carbonate is used in a swallow formulation, with the level optimized for each drug, then enhanced dissolution can always be achieved, particularly for drugs with limited solubility.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, therapeutic compositions are defined in which the addition of bases such as carbonates, to therapeutic compounds that are bases, salts of bases, amphoteric compounds or salts amphoteric compounds, enable enhances in vitro dissolution of the therapeutic agent.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to therapeutic formulations and more particularly fast dissolving swallow formulations for a therapeutic compound that is a base, a salt of a base, an amphoteric compound or a salt of an amphoteric compound with pharmacological, physiological or biochemical activity or a proactive form thereof.<br><br>
The present invention provides a swallow formulation comprising<br>
(a)	a therapeutic compound that is a base, a salt of a base, an amphoteric compound<br>
or a salt of an amphoteric compound, and<br>
(b)	an appropriate amount of one or more pH modulating agents wherein at least<br>
one pH modulating agent is a carbonate in an amount that will neutralise 0.01 to 9.0 millimoles of hydrochloric acid and is present in an amount from about \% to 50% by weight of the swallow formulation,<br>
wherein at least about 70% of the therapeutic compound is dissolved from the swallow formulation within 180 seconds, at 30 rpm when the dissolution is measured in United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) dissolution apparatus 2 with 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid at 37°C.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention at least about 90% of the therapeutic compound is dissolved from the swallow formulation within 180 seconds at 30 rpm in USP dissolution apparatus 2 with 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid at 30 rpm and 37 °C.<br>
The present invention further provides a swallow formulation comprising<br>
(a)	a therapeutic compound that is a base, a salt of a base, an amphoteric compound<br>
or a salt of an amphoteric compound, and<br>
(b)	an appropriate amount of one or more pH modulating agents wherein at least<br>
one pH modulating agent is a carbonate in an amount that will neutralise 0.01 to 9.0 millimoles of hydrochloric acid and is present in an amount from about 1% to 50% by weight of the swallow formulation,<br>
wherein at least about 5% of the therapeutic compound is dissolved from the swallow formulation within 300 seconds at 0 rpm when the dissolution is measured in United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) dissolution apparatus 2 with 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid at 37°C.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention at least about 20% or the therapeutic compound is dissolved from the swallow formulation within 300 seconds at 30 rpm in USP dissolution apparatus 2 with 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid at 30 rpm and 37 °C.<br>
The present invention further provides a swallow formulation comprising<br>
(a)       a therapeutic compound that is a base, a salt of a base, an amphoteric compound or a salt of an amphoteric compound, and<br><br>
(b)      an appropriate amount of one or more pH modulating agents wherein at least one pH modulating agent is a carbonate in an amount that will neutralise 0.01 to 9.0 millimoles of hydrochloric acid and is present in an amount from about 1% to 50% by weight of the swallow formulation,<br>
wherein<br>
(i)         at least about 70% of the therapeutic compound is dissolved from the swallow formulation within 180 seconds, at 30 rpm, and<br>
(ii)        at least about 5% of the therapeutic compound is dissolved from the swallow formulation within 300 seconds at 0 rpm when the dissolution is measured in United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) dissolution apparatus 2 with 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid at 37°C.<br>
Typically, when the pH modulating agent of the swallow formulation comprises a base (but no acid), the dissolution rate is greater than 5 % at 300 seconds at 0 rpm. More typically the dissolution rate is greater than 20% at 300 seconds at 0 rpm.<br>
Typically when the pH modulating agent of the swallow formulation comprises a base and an acid, the dissolution rate is greater than 5 % at 300 seconds at 0 rpm. More typically the dissolution rate is greater than 20% at 300 seconds at 0 rpm.<br>
Preferably, the swallow formulation further comprises an agent which facilitates water uptake. The swallow formulation of the present invention exhibits enhanced dissolution of the therapeutic compound from the formulation.<br>
A dissolution medium comprising 900 mL of 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid contains 3 millimoles of hydrochloric acid, approximating the amount of acid estimated to be present in the residual gastric contents in a fasted subject. This amount of acid can be completely neutralized by high amounts of bases used as pH modulating agents, so that the pH of the dissolution medium will change depending on the levels of pH modulating agents used in a formulation. This is particularly important for investigating the dissolution of drugs where their solubilities is pH dependent.<br>
Dissolution results using 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid may be of importance in vivo as the acidity of gastric contents varies significantly, and low acid conditions are associated with the fed and partial prandial states, as well as in patients with suppressed gastric function.<br><br>
When the stirring speed is reduced to 0 rpm, the dissolution profiles demonstrate the intrinsic characteristics of the fast dissolving formulations of this invention which are able to enhance the dissolution of the drugs without any external stirring. Dissolution results without stirring may be of in vivo significance in conditions where there is gut stasis or reduced gastric<br>
activity.<br>
Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory, the bicarbonate assists with the dissolution in a number of ways. Of particular importance is the effervescence, ie the release of COj. Whilst it is possible to calculate the theoretical amount of gas that will be produced, it is the rate of production that is critical and it is difficult to measure this directly. The advantage provided by the COz release can be measured indirectly by measuring the rate of dissolution of the tablet without any stirring (ie, 0 rpm). At 0 rpm, the formulation itself will provide the only source of stirring from the gas produced. Use of dissolution media containing lower levels of acid, such as 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid, allows greater discrimination between formulations with different rates of production of carbon dioxide. Formulations which do not effervesce or effervesce only slowly show little if any dissolution even after an extended time.<br>
The preferred amount of pH modulating agent is an amount sufficient to enhance the dissolution of the therapeutic compound from the swallow formulation. This amount will vary depending on the therapeutic compound. Preferably the pH modulating agent will be in an amount so as not to increase the pH of a 900 mL 0.0033 N Hydrochloric acid dissolution medium that contains 3 millimoles of hydrochloric acid to greater than 6.<br>
Examples of suitable active agents include analgesics e.g. opiates and opiate analogs, antipyretics, anti-migraine agents, sedatives, hypnotics, anti-anxiety agents, antipsychotic agents, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antiemetics, antinauseants, expectorants, antitussives and decongestants, bronchodilators, antihistamines and anti-allergy agents, anti-diarrhoeals, antispasmodics and motility agents, hyperacidity, reflux and ulcer agents, antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals, detoxifying agents and agents used in drug dependence / withdrawal and erectile dysfunction agents.<br>
Preferred therapeutic compounds are those which have one or more base groups such as but not limited to opiates such as hyrocodone, oxycodone, the triptans including eletriptan, rizatriptan, zolmitriptan; the benzodiazepines including diazepam, flurazepam, flunitrazepam, temazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam; fexofenadine; metoclopramide, loperamide, zolpidem, zopiclone, loratadine, ondansetron, granisetron, tadalafil, vardenafil, sildenafil, ranitidine,<br><br>
famotidine, codeine, fcntanyl, tramadol, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, dextrometthorphan, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine, cetirizine, and cimetidine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Preferred therapeutic compounds includes combinations of drugs such as paracetamol and tramadol. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that certain combinations of drugs may result in synergistic dissolution effects. For example, combination of a base and acid may achieve improved dissolution at lower levels of pH modulating agent. Again, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believe that intrinsic micro-stirring in the tablet may effectively promote the dissolution of the lesser soluble drug compared with the mixing achieved as a result of the reaction between the base and the acid (of the pH modulating agent) in the dissolution medium.<br>
In addition, the fast dissolving oral delivery system may contain a combination of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or other components such as water uptake agents, disintegrants, preservatives, colours, antioxidants, emulsifiers, sweeteners, flavouring agents, binders, glidants and lubricants. In an exemplary form, the fast dissolving delivery system may also contain one or more pharmaceutically active agents. The oral dosage form may be administered by swallowing with water or any other liquid.<br>
Particularly useful active agents include analgesics, anti-aliergenics, anti-nausea agents, anti-migraine agents, agents for treating erectile dysfunction and hypnotics.<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides a dosage form such as a coated tablet, uncoated tablet, capsule, powder, paste, cachet, colloid, gel or melt.<br>
Solubility Considerations<br>
The effect of tablet formulations on drug dissolution will be dependent on the nature and amount of the drug included in each tablet, and the levels of base and acid used in the formulation. The addition of optimised amounts and ratios of acids and bases can significantly improve the dissolution of a range of different drugs as a result of the effect of the couple on the micro pH in the tablet and on the pH of the dissolution medium, which in turn increases the solubility of a drug.<br>
In general,<br>
•         for basic drugs where the solubility decreases with an increase in pH, then for<br>
maximum dissolution, it is important that there is no significant net increase in the pH such as is achieved with stoichiometric amounts of acid and a base (in the pH<br><br>
modulating agent) since they react with each other. There will only be a net effect on pH if one or the other component is in excess.<br>
•         amphoteric drugs behave like basic or acidic drugs depending on the pKa and the pH. Amphoteric drugs behaving as bases will demonstrate reduced solubility-at higher pH as the more soluble acid salt is converted to the less soluble, less ionised form. As these drugs also behave as acids it is important to optimise the pH in the formulation for optimum solubility for each specific drug.<br>
The present invention further contemplates a method for delivering a therapeutic compound that is a base, a salt of a base, an amphoteric compound or a salt of an amphoteric compound by oral delivery including administration such as by swallowing, the method comprising orally delivery, including administering, a formulation comprising a therapeutic compound with an appropriate amount of one or more pH modulating agents wherein at least one of the pH modulating agents is a carbonate so as to enhance the dissolution of the therapeutic compound from the swallow formulation.<br>
Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element or integer or group of elements or integers but not the exclusion of any other element or integer or group of elements or integers.<br>
It is to be understood that unless otherwise indicated, the subject intervention is not limited to specific formulation components, manufacturing methods, dosage regimens, or the like, as such may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
It must also be noted that, as used in the subject specification, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural aspects unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "therapeutic compound" includes a single therapeutic compound, as well as two or more therapeutic compounds; reference to "a pH modulating agent" includes a single pH modulating agent, as well as two or more pH modulating agents; reference to a "water uptake agent" includes a single water uptake agent, as well as two or more water uptake agents; and so forth.<br>
In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology is used in accordance with the definitions set forth below.<br>
Where used herein "unionized" refers to a drug that is largely unionized between approximately pH 2 and pH 8. Of course the person skilled in the art will understand that there<br><br>
will be some extent of unionization of almost any drug in the right pH. Typically the unionized drug will be &gt;50% ionised below pH 2 and above pH 8.<br>
A "swallow formulation" is any formulation which is administered to a subject by the action of swallowing the dosage form intact. The dosage form comprising the swallow formulation may be a coated tablet or capsule which does not have the same dissolution characteristics of the swallow formulation contained therein.<br>
The terms "therapeutic compound", "compound", "pharmacologically active agent", "medicament", "active", "active ingredient", "drug" and "drug component" are used interchangeably throughout this specification. The terms also encompass pharmaceuticaHy acceptable and pharmacologically active ingredients of those active agents specifically mentioned herein including but not limited to salts, esters, amides, pro-drugs, active metabolites, analogs and the like. When the terms "active agent", "compound", "pharmacologically active agent", "medicament", "active", "drug", and "drug component" are used, then it is to be understood that this includes those compounds per se as well as pharmaceuticaHy acceptable, pharmacologically active salts, esters, amides, pro-drugs, metabolites, analogs, etc. The terms "agent", "compound" etc may be a single molecule or a composite of molecules.<br>
By the term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" of a therapeutic compound as used herein means that a sufficient amount of a therapeutic compound is used to provide the desired therapeutic effect or the desired physiological or biochemical event including the amelioration of symptoms being treated or prevented. Of course, undesirable effects, e.g. side effects, are sometimes manifested along with the desired therapeutic effect; hence, a practitioner balances the potential benefits against the potential risks in determining what is an appropriate "effective amount".<br>
The terms "delivery" and "administration" are used interchangeably throughout the specification to mean the act of providing the oral dosage form to an individual. The term "administering" is considered herein synonymous with "delivering", "providing", "introducing" or "swallowing".<br>
By "pharmaceuticaHy acceptable excipient" is meant a pharmaceutical vehicle comprised of a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e. the oral dosage form may be administered to a subject along with a therapeutic compound without causing any or a substantial adverse reaction. Excipients may include carriers and other additives such as<br><br>
diluents, binders, detergents, colouring agents, flavouring agents, wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, glidants, lubricants and the like as well as disintegrants.<br>
The terms "treating" and "treatment" as used herein refer to reduction or amelioration in severity and/or frequency of symptoms, elimination of symptoms and/or underlying cause and/or prevention of the occurrence of symptoms and/or their underlying cause. Thus, for example, "treating" a patient involves prevention of a particular disorder or adverse physiological event in a susceptible individual as well as treatment of a clinically symptomatic individual by inhibiting or causing regression of a particular condition. Thus, for example, a method of treating a patient in need of pain relief encompasses both prevention of pain as well as treating conditions of pain.<br>
"Patient" as used herein refers to an animal, preferably a mammal and more preferably human who can benefit from the pharmaceutical formulations and methods of the present invention. There is no limitation on the type of animal that could benefit from the presently described pharmaceutical formulations and methods. A patient regardless of whether a human or non-human animal may be referred to as an individual, subject, animal, host or recipient. The compounds and methods of the present invention have applications in human medicine, veterinary medicine as well as in general, domestic or wild animal husbandry. For convenience, an "animal" includes an avian species such as a poultry bird, an aviary bird or game bird.<br>
The preferred animals are humans or other primates, livestock animals, laboratory test animals, companion animals or captive wild animals. A human is the most preferred target.<br>
A "pH modulating agent" includes one or more than one pH modulating agents which alter the pH of an aqueous solution. These may include acids, bases or a combination of one or more and/or bases.<br>
The carbonate may be any pharmaceutically acceptable carbonate or a mixture thereof. Reference to a "carbonate" includes a single agent or multiple (ie. two or more) agents.

17	Comparative Data for Examples 1 to 16<br>
18	Tramadol Hydrochloride 37.5 mg (salt of a base) with Paracetamol 325 mg<br>
(acid)<br>
Examples 1 to 11 include dissolution profiles for:<br>
•	a formulation designated 1 containing bicarbonate alone in accordance with the<br>
present invention measured at 30 rpm and 0 rpm,<br>
•	a formulation designated 2 containing bicarbonate &amp; acid in accordance with<br>
the present invention measured at 30 rpm and 0 rpm, and<br>
•	a commercial product without bicarbonate sourced in Australia or USA as a<br>
comparative example measured at 30 rpm only.<br>
Example 18 includes dissolution profiles for paracetamol and tramadol hydrochloride formulations including:<br>
•	one formulation according to the invention with bicarbonate alone designated 1,<br>
•	a second formulation according to the invention containing sodium bicarbonate<br>
with fumaric acid as an example of an organic acid designated 2, and<br>
•	a commercial product which contains no pH modulating agents as well as any<br>
fast dissolving commercial products containing pH modulating agents.<br>
For Example 18, dissolution data are provided using USP dissolution apparatus 2 at 37 °C and 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid at 30 rpm and 0 rpm. This dissolution medium discriminates better between formulations designed for fast dissolution than more acidic dissolution media where the effect of high acid concentration tends to mask formulation effects on dissolution.<br>
For the dissolution profiles, drug concentrations were measured by UV absorbance at an appropriate wavelength for each drug using flow through cells for automatic continuous sampling.<br><br>
Overview of Examples and Methods of Preparation<br>
Examples 1 and 16 are salts of amphoteric drugs. Examples 2 to 8, 12, 13 and 15 are salts of basic drugs. Examples 9,10 and 14 are bases. Example 11 is an amphoteric drug. Example 18 is a combination of a salt of a basic drug with an acidic drug.<br>
In Examples 4 and 8 and 13 to 16, the formulations were prepared by dry blending the ingredients prior to compression unless otherwise stated. The powder blend was compressed with suitable size tooling on a rotary press to produce tablets with hardness in the range 3-12 Kp.<br>
Examples 12 and 18 were prepared as indicated below under their respective headings.<br>
Formulations of drugs for Examples 1 to 3, 5 to 7 and 9 to 11 were prepared by crushing commercially available product in a mortar and pestle, and where applicable passing through a 280 urn screen to remove any residual film coating. The resultant powder was dry blended proportionally with other ingredients before compression.<br>
In Examples 12 to 16 the formulations designated T are always the comparative examples containing no carbonate. All other formulations of Examples 12 to 16 contain carbonate in accordance with the present invention.<br>
While the complete quantitative formulations of the commercial products are not known, all ingredients contained in the products are listed in the product information available from the manufacturer. The amount of drug and any actives are quantified, but only the presence or absence of other ingredients is known. In the tables for these examples, the symbol "V" indicates that a specific ingredient is present, and will be present at the same level in all formulations provided.<br>
Although these formulations have not been optimised, they do demonstrate the applicability of the present invention to a range of different basic compounds, salts of basic compounds and amphoteric compounds.<br>
Dissolution testing<br>
The following USP dissolution apparatus II with 1000 mL dissolution vessels and paddle stirrers was used to perform the dissolution testing:<br>
•	VanKelVK 7010 Dissolution bath<br>
•	VanKel VK 750 D Heater/Circulator<br>
•	Gilson Minipulse peristaltic pump for automatic continuous sampling<br><br>
All testing was conducted in a dissolution medium containing 900 mL of 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid at 37°C which is effective in discriminating between fast dissolving formulations. 900 mL of this medium contains the absolute amount of acid estimated to be present in the gastric contents in vivo, namely 3 rnillimoles, and its pH will change when high levels of sodium bicarbonate used in some formulations are added.<br>
The materials used for preparation of dissolution media were:<br>
•	32 % w/w concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) (AR quality from Rowe<br>
Scientific)<br>
•	RO water from in-house Millipore Elix® water system.<br>
Dissolution results were measured as the mean of 2 replicates. Repeating the testing at 0 rpm provides more discrimination between formulations.<br>
For measurements at 30 rpm, after 20 minutes, the stirring speed was increased to demonstrate the extent of further dissolution that could be achieved.<br>
Drug concentrations for Examples 1 to 16 were measured using a Varian Gary 50 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer set at an appropriate wavelength. For each drug, the optimal wavelength was selected after running UV scans in the dissolution medium. For drug concentration measurements at 0 rpm, the amount of dissolution medium bled off was so small as to have negligible effect on the main body of dissolution media.<br>
Drug concentrations of the paracetamol/tramadol formulations of Example 18 were measured by HPLC analysis for each drug in samples taken at selected intervals.<br>
Solution pH was measured using a TPS WP81 pH, Salinity, Temperature &amp; Conductivity Meter.<br>
Overview of Results<br>
Table 1 summarises the dissolution results for Examples 1 to 11 at 30 rpm.<br>
Tables 2 and 2a summarise the dissolution results at 0 rpm for the drugs exemplified in Examples 1 to 16 of the specification, where the pH modulating agent comprises a base and an acid, and a base alone, respectively.<br>
Tables 3 to 46 and 49 to 52 set out the formulations of the examples and their corresponding dissolution rates.<br>
Table 47 presents the consolidated dissolution data on all drugs exemplified in Examples 1 to 16 of the specification.<br><br>
Table 48 provides a summary of aqueous solubility data for all dmgs exemplified m the patent application.<br>
Figures 1 to 24 depict graphically the dissolution results for Examples 1 to 11 and 18. Conclusions and further comments based on the examples<br>
Jt will be apparent that the use of pH modulating agents in accordance with the current invention substantially increases in vitro dissolution of the therapeutic agents exemplified.<br>
Table 1 summarises the dissolution data for formulation examples that demonstrate the current invention in 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid using USP apparatus 2 at 30 rpm and<br>
37°C:<br>
Table 1     Dissolution data for basic and amphoteric drugs in formulations according to the invention at 30 rpm stirring speed in 900 mL 0.0033 Nhydrochloric acid<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
the exception of fexofenadine hydrochloride and alprazolam, it is clear from these results that the formulations of these drugs containing pH modulating agents according to the<br>
invention, had a dissolution rate greater than 70% at 180 seconds at 30 rpm. Fexofenadine hydrochloride and alprazolam did not meet this specification achieving 63 % and 61 % dissolution respectively at 180 seconds at 30 rpm. However, it should be noted that no formulation optimisation was conducted, and it is expected that better performing examples could be formulated according to the present invention.<br>
Table 2 provides a summary of the dissolution data for all drug formulations exemplified in the specification where the pH modulating agent is a base and an acid, measured in 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid using USP apparatus 2 at 0 rpm and 37°C:<br>
Table 2     Summary dissolution data for basic and amphoteric drugs in formulations<br>
according to the invention where the pH modulating agents include a base and an acid, measured at 0 rpm stirring speed in 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
 will be apparent from Table 2 that formulations according to the invention which contain a pharmaceutically acceptable acid in addition to a bicarbonate, demonstrate substantially increased in vitro dissolution of .the therapeutic agents exemplified in the absence<br><br>
of external stirring. This highlights the role of intrinsic micro-stirring in enhancing dissolution, where the reaction between the pH modulating agents has a greater effect on dissolution than the reaction between the base and acid in the dissolution medium.<br>
For some drugs, enhanced dissolution was achieved with formulations containing a bicarbonate alone. For others, the addition of an organic acid to the bicarbonate further enhanced the dissolution. In some cases the addition of an acid was necessary to achieve the dissolution performance described in this .specification.<br>
In the absence of external stirring, at 0 rpm, the results achieved for formulations containing a base alone are significantly reduced compared to those for formulations containing an acid and a base. This results from the greater intrinsic micro-stirring resulting from the reaction between the base and organic acid relative to the reaction between the base and the acidic dissolution medium.<br>
The extent of dissolution enhancement seen with bicarbonate alone is evident in Table 2a which summarises the dissolution data for drug formulations exemplified in the specification where the pH modulating agent is a base only, measured in 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid using USP apparatus 2 at 0 rpm and 37°C. Where the dissolution does not reach adequate levels, acid is added to improve the dissolution to the levels seen in Table 2.<br>
Table 2a   Summary dissolution data for basic and amphoteric drugs in formulations<br>
according to the invention where the only pH modulating agent used is a base, measured at 0 rpm stirring speed in 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
 seen in Table 2a, in the formulations that contained sodium bicarbonate alone without any additional acid, most drugs achieved more than 5 % dissolution in 30 minutes at 0 rpm. While diazepam and alprazolam did not meet this specification at 3.5 % and 4 % respectively, it should be noted that no formulation optimisation was conducted, and it is<br>
expected that better performing examples could be formulated according to the present invention.<br>
Combination of Drugs<br>
The basic salt tramadol hydrochloride is more soluble than the unionised drug, paracetamol with which it has been formulated, having a solubility in water around 30 mg / mL compared with 14 mg / mL for paracetamol. On a weight for weight basis, the tramadol hydrochloride needs around 1 mL for total dissolution compared to around 27 mL for the dose of paracetamol.<br>
In 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid at 30 rpm, only the formulation with base and acid (B2) demonstrates very fast dissolution reaching 100 % within 5 minutes.<br>
The formulation with the higher level of bicarbonate alone (28 %) shows slower dissolution for both drugs although the dissolution of the more soluble tramadol hydrochloride is faster than that of the paracetamol. Dissolution of this formulation does not show significantly improved dissolution compared with the commercial product.<br>
In 900 mL 0.0033 N hydrochloric acid at 0 rpm, the intrinsic dissolution enhancing features of the formulations become apparent as the effect of the external acidity is reduced and external stirring is eliminated. Under these conditions, formulation B2 containing the base and acid demonstrates fast and significant levels of dissolution compared with the formulation with base alone.<br>
Conclusion<br>
Based on these results, it is apparent that:<br>
•	formulations containing bicarbonate alone according to the present invention<br>
have a dissolution rate greater than 5 % at 30 minutes at 0 rpm, and<br>
•	formulations containing bicarbonate with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
according to the present invention have a dissolution rate greater than 5 % at<br>
300 seconds at 0 rpm.<br>
