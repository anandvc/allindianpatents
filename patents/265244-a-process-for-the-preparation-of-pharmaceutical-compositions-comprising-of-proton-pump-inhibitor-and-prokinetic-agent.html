				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and process for preparing such compositions comprising of at least one gastric acid suppressing agent and one or more prokinetic agent(s) exhibiting a unique bimodal release profile, optionally with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Preferably, the present invention describes pharmaceutical compositions of a proton pump inhibitor and one or more prokinetic agent(s). More preferably, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical composition of pantoprazole or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, hydrates, or derivatives; and domperidone or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, hydrates, or derivatives. These compositions are especially useful in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Furthermore, the present invention refers to a method for the manufacture of such preparations in a way such that there is increased dissolution of the prokinetic agent at alkaline pH.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer and other gastric acid related disorders are disorders having a pathogenesis related to reduced gastric motility and release of excessive gastric acid. Aside from behavioral changes, GERD and gastric ulcer have been successfully treated with a range of gastric acid inhibitors, such as ranitidine and omeprazole, which are acid-suppressing agents. Stimulation of gastric motility has been proposed to accelerate the healing of gastric ulcer. Prokinetic agents, such as domperidone, are known to enhance gastrointestinal motility and prevent duodenogastric reflux, and are widely used to treat GERD. Proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic agents have been used in combination to treat gastric ulcer and other related disorders.<br>
Proton pump inhibitors, such as Lansoprazole, omeprazole, Pantoprazole are rapidly taking share from H2 receptor antagonists, particularly in reflux oesophagitis. Omeprazole is known to offer significant gain over H2 receptor antagonists in terms of symptom resolution, healing and prevention of relapse for reflux oesophagitis.<br>
A combination therapy of a prokinetic agent and a gastric acid lowering compound is rational and has shown more effectiveness than mono-therapy of proton pump inhibitors. Administration of cisapride and ranitidine was shown to further lower the exposure of the oesophagus to acid(s) (Inauen W et al. Gut 1993; 34: 1025-1031). Such a therapy was also shown to improve healing rates (de Boer WA et al. Aliment Pharmacol Ther 1994; 8: 147-157).<br>
•Maintenance therapy is often necessary to prevent recurrent symptoms and oesophagitis. A<br>
»<br>
combination therapy combining an acid-suppressing agent with a prokinetic agent has been recently described. [Vyneri et al; N. Engl. J Med 1995; 333: 1106-1110].<br>
US patent no. 6,132,771 discloses a combination therapy of proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent wherein, the prokinetic agent may be in the form of instant release, sustained release or extended release formulations. However, prokinetic agents such as domperidone require optimum binding to receptors. Hence, improved therapeutic efficacy may be achieved by administering the drug in timed release form with an initial loading dose and a delayed release dose provided with a lag time.<br>
The WO publication no. 95/01803 describes a pharmaceutical composition of famotidine, cisapride and optionally simethicone in the treatment of gastrointestinal distress.<br>
The WO publication no. 200471374A2 describes pharmaceutical compositions for once a day oral administration, comprising at least one delayed release component, wherein said delayed release component comprises a proton pump inhibitor, said composition further including at least one immediate release and/or a sustained release prokinetic agent. The said application discloses use of polymers to formulate sustained release compositions of the prokinetic agent. However, such compositions suffer from a major disadvantage in terms of absorption of the prokinetic agent which are primarily absorbed from the intestine and hence a delayed release composition is highly desirable.<br>
Nagarsenker, M. S.; Garad, S. D.; Ramprakash, G., [Journal of Controlled Release (2000), 63(1-2), 31-39] describe coevaporates of domperidone prepared using different polymers by solvent evaporation technique. The drug release rate was dependent on the concentration of polymers in the coevaporates. Dissolution of drug in a pH 6.8 buffer improved with increasing concentration of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate in coevaporates.<br>
However, there still exist a need to develop pharmaceutical compositions comprising a combination of a gastric acid suppressing agent preferably a proton pump inhibitor and a prokinetic agent wherein the prokinetic agent is present in an immediate release form and a delayed release form useful for the treatment of gastro esophageal reflux disease, reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, and other gastric acid related disorders. The delayed release form of the prokinetic agent is highly essential since most of the prokinetic agents show a better absorption generally from the intestinal region of the GIT, which is an objective of the present invention.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an objective of the present invention to provide an oral pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one gastric acid suppressing agent and one or more prokinetic agent, optionally with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, characterized in that the gastric acid suppressing agent is present in a delayed release form and the prokinetic agent is present in a bimodal release form such as an immediate release form to provide an initial loading dose, and a delayed release, form to provide a dose with a lag time; with the provisio that the prokinetic agent is not formulated using a rate controlling polymer and is not present in a sustained release form.<br>
It is an objective of the present invention to provide oral pharmaceutical composition comprising a proton pump inhibitor, preferably pantoprazole or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, hydrates, derivatives or prodrugs, and domperidone or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, hydrates, or derivatives thereof.<br>
It is also an objective of the present invention to provide a process for preparing a composition comprising at least one gastric acid suppressing agent and one or more prokinetic agent, optionally with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, characterized in that the gastric acid suppressing agent is present in a delayed release form and the prokinetic agent is present in a bimodal release form such as an immediate release form to provide an initial loading dose, and a delayed release form to provide a dose with a lag time; with the provisio that the prokinetic agent is not formulated using a rate controlling polymer and is not present in a sustained release form, which comprises of the following steps:<br>
i)      processing the acid suppressing agent with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients ii)     processing the prokinetic agent with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients iii)    formulating the material of step i) and ii) into a suitable dosage form.<br>
It is yet another objective to provide a method of treatment of gastro esophageal reflux disease, reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, and other gastric acid related disorders by administering to a patient in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.<br>
Detailed description of invention<br>
A combination therapy comprising a gastric acid suppressing agent and a prokinetic agent is attractive, rational and effective. A combination of gastric acid suppressing agent and prokinetic<br>
• agent could be an alternative to each of them separately in case of failure. However, because of the large number of therapeutical tablets/pills that must be taken each day in such a therapy, the compliance of such a treatment may be a problem. It is well known that patient compliance is a major factor in receiving good results in medical treatments. Administration of two, three or even more different tablets to the patient is not convenient or satisfactory to achieve the most optimal results. The present invention now provides new oral dosage forms comprising two or more different active substances combined in one fixed unit dosage form, preferably tablets in a capsule.<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising of at least one gastric acid suppressing agent and one or more prokinetic agent(s) optionally with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Preferably, the present invention describes pharmaceutical compositions of a proton pump inhibitor and one or more prokinetic agent(s). More preferably, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical composition of pantoprazole or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, hydrates, derivatives or prodrugs; and domperidone or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, hydrates, derivatives or prodrugs.<br>
One aspect of the present invention relates to oral pharmaceutical compositions of gastric motility modifying agents and their combination therapies wherein the gastric motility-modifying agent has a unique bimodal release profile. These preparations are especially useful in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The present invention includes combination of this enhanced solubility formulation of prokinetic agent with a proton pump inhibitor for improved efficacy.<br>
