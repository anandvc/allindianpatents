COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"ANALGESIC AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING COX-2 INHIBITORS"<br>
WYETH, of Five Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07940, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br>
6-11-2006<br><br>
The present invention relates to a composition consisting cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor.<br>
This invention relates to a composition for alleviating pain and/or<br>
inflammation which provides both quick onset and long duration. More particularly,<br>
this invention is concerned with a composition consisting essentially of a<br>
cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (also referred to as a cyclooxygenase II, COX-2 or COX<br>
H inhibitor) and a second analgesic composition selected from the group consisting of<br>
NSAIDS (non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs), acetaminophen and mixtures<br>
thereof. The invention is also directed to a method for alleviatingj pain and/or<br>
inflammation through the administration of such composition.	<br>
I<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds have been found which exhibit anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity, (in addition to inhibiting hormone-induced uterine contractions and certain types of cancer growth) through inhibition of prostaglandin G/H synthase, also known as cyclooxygenase. Initially, only one form of cyclooxygenase was known, this corresponding to cyclooxygenase-1 or the constitutive! enzyme, as originally identified in bovine seminal vesicles. This enzyme has been cloned, sequenced and characterized from various sources including sheep, mouse and man. Prostaglandins have also been found to have both physiological and, pathological roles, Cyclooxygenase-1 is responsible for endogenous basal release of prostaglandins and is important in their physiological functions such as  the maintenance of<br><br>
gastrointestinal integrity and renal blood flow. Non-steroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have been found to inhibit the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme; and thereby exhibit anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties.<br><br>
While NSAIDS exhibit excellent anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties and possess additional benefits such as quick onset times, NSAIDS have a potential for gastrointestinal toxicity, and/or renal side effects.<br>
More recently, the gene for a second inducible form of cyclooxygenase, referred to as cyclooxygenase-2, has been cloned, sequenced and characterized in chicken, marine and human sources. This gene, termed cyclooxygenase-2, is rapidly and readily inducible by a number of agents including mitogens, endotoxin, hormones, cytokines and growth factors. In contrast to cyclooxygenase-1, cyclooxygenase-2 is mainly responsible for the pathological effects of prostaglandins where rapid induction of the enzyme would normally occur in response to such agents as inflammatory agents, hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. Therefore, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 has similar anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties to those obtained by inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-1 through use of an NSAIDS.<br>
A number of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are known. For example, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,393,790; 5,409,944; 5,418,254; 5,420,343; 5,436,265; 5,474,995; 5,476,944; 5,486,534; 5,510,368; 5,521,213; 5,536,752; 5,547,975; 5,550,142; 5,552,422; 5,565,482; 5,576,339; 5,580,985; 5,585,504; 5,593,994 and 5,596,008.<br>
While cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors possess similar anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity to NSAIDS, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors also exhibit a diminished tendency to induce some of the mechanism-based side effects That may occur with the use of NSAIDs. In particular, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors appear to have a reduced potential for gastrointestinal toxicity and renal side effects, a reduced effect on bleeding times and possibly a diminished ability to induce asthma attacks in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic subjects.<br>
However, while cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors do possess potential benefits relating to reduced side effects, they are generally slow acting relative to cyclooxygenase— 1 inhibitors such as NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Therefore, a patient using them for analgesia perceives that they possess an unsatisfactorily long onset period in providing the desired analgesia.<br><br><br>
The compositions claimed herein offer the benefits of quicker onset for analgesia relative to cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors used alone. The claimed compositions further reduce the amount of cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors adininistered and thereby reduce the potential for gastrointestinal toxicity. Such combinations farther provide longer duration of action, such as "once daily dosing", without losing the benefit of the fast onset of analgesia associated with the use of cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors. In still a further benefit of the present invention, the combinations of the claimed compositions are found to be synergistic in that the onset time of the cyclooxygenase-l inhibitors (and therefore the claimed composition) is reduced relative to the onset times of either component used alone. In other words, the onset of the cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor component (e.g. NSAID) is unexpectedly potentiated by the presence of the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor.<br>

The following Examples demonstrate various embodiments of the claimed invention. However, they should not be construed as limiting its scope.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1	<br>
A modification of the acetic acid-induced writhing test (as disclosed in Porreca, F., HX Mosberg, J.R. Omnaas, T. F. Burks and A. Cowan in Supraspinal and spinal potency of selective opioid agonists in the mouse writhing test (Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 240: 890-894, 1987)) was conducted. The mouse writhing model as described is commonly used to investigate analgesic efficacy and potential synergism with combinations of drugs.<br>
Male Swiss mice weighing 25-30 g were obtained from Ace ILaboratories. They were each placed in individual rectangular observation boxes and allowed to acclimate for at least 1 hour. A placebo vehicle of 1% Tween 80/water was prepared.<br><br><br><br>
Groups of 8-10 mice each received the test agent or placebo vehicle (in an amount of 0.25 ml/25 grams of body weight) orally via stomach tube. Those mice that received the placebo vehicle composed the control group. After 20, 30, 40 or 60 minutes, each mouse was injected parenterally with a 0.6% acetic acid solution (0.25 ml/25 g body weight).<br>
After a further 5 minutes, the number of abdominal writhes displayed by each animal was counted over a ten minute period. The number of writhes displayed by each animal in such 10 minute test period was then normalized to the mean number shown by the control (vehicle) group. Percent inhibition of writhing was expressed as.<br>
(Mean writhes in control group) - (Writhes bv individual mouse) x 100 (Mean writhes in control group)<br>
Results<br>
A preliminary study was conducted at +30 minutes to establish antinociceptive<br>
dose-response curves for ibuprofen (obtained from Sigma Chemical) and celecoxib<br>
(manufactured by G.D. Searle &amp; Co. in 200 mg capsules and marketed under the<br>
trademark Celebrex®), respectively. The results are presented in Table 1 below. An<br>
oral A50 value of 29.07 rag/kg (17.57-40.58) (95% confidence limits) was obtained for<br>
ibuprofen. The corresponding value for celecoxib was &gt;80mg/kg.	<br><br><br>
Table1<br>
25	Compound'<br>
Ibuprofen<br>
Celecoxib 30<br><br><br><br>
To study the effects of the administration of the compounds in combination, one group of mice (n=8-10) received 29 mg/kg of ibuprofen followed immediately by an essentially inactive dose of celecoxib (20 mg/kg). A second group of mice (n=8-10) received 29 mg of ibuprofen followed immediately by the placebo vehicle. At either +20, +40 or +60 minutes following administration, the animals were injected i.p. with 0.6% acetic acid (0.25 ml/25 g body weight) and run in the writhing test. The data obtained are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
It is clear from the data in Tables 1 and 2 that the presence of even an essentially inactive dose of celecoxib potentiated the ibuprofen through faster onset and duration of action.<br><br>
