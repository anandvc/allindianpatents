				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation of International Application No.<br>
PCT/CN2007/000790, filed on Mar. 12, 2007, which claims the priority benefit of China<br>
Patent Application No.200610104256.2, entitled "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR<br>
GENERATING COMMUNICATION SUBSCRIBER DESCRIPTION INFORMATION",<br>
filed on Aug.7, 2006. The content of the above identified applications are all incorporated<br>
herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY<br>
The present invention relates to a communication information collection<br>
technology, and more particularly to a system and a method for generating communication<br>
subscriber description information.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
With the development of modern communication technology, people can<br>
communicate with each other in many diversified ways, from fixed-line phones and mobile<br>
phones for voice communication, to Emails and mobile Emails mainly for text<br>
communication, to instant messages (IMs) which combine voice, text, and even image<br>
communication; and from the BBS Forums of Web 1.0 to the multimedia-filled Blogs of<br>
Web 2.0. Meanwhile, various communication modes are becoming gradually integrated. For<br>
example, a subscriber can now conduct voice communication, Email sending and receiving,<br>
and IM communication all through one mobile terminal. In addition, one can even achieve<br>
information communication through various data services like mobile Blogs, picture Blogs,<br><br><br>
and Podcasts.<br>
Relevant data show that, under current conditions, on average 170 million call<br>
records are produced each month in a district with 700,000 GSM subscribers. This<br>
interpersonal communication builds a huge social relationship network, and at the same<br>
time, such communication contains abundant communication subscriber description<br>
information reflecting the characteristics and requirements of the subscribers. For example,<br>
when a subscriber regularly dials the service hotline of a securities company, it can be<br>
deduced that the subscriber is possibly a shareholder. Thus products about investment and<br>
financing might well interest the subscriber. Therefore, certain attributes of the securities<br>
company can be transferred to the subscriber. In today's user-centered society, one<br>
extremely significant issue is how to obtain communication subscriber description<br>
information.<br>
In another aspect, Ontology has become a heat-point in research at home and<br>
abroad, and its applications appear in various fields. The study of Ontology is focused on<br>
knowledge engineering, ontology engineering, information organization and retrieval, and<br>
semantic Web. Various ontology languages and ontology creation tools are being gradually<br>
developed and utilized. For example, Protege is a free and open-source ontology editor and<br>
knowledge management platform developed by Medical Information Center of Stanford<br>
University School of Medicine. Jena is a development kit from the HP Company for the<br>
application of semantic network-oriented ontology parsing and rule reasoning, and its<br>
content is comprehensive. As for ontology languages, Web Ontology Language (OWL) has<br>
become a recommended standard for World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). It has become a<br>
trend to use Ontology in traditional and emerging industries.<br>
Ontology is applied in the communication world to describe the attribute<br>
characteristics of each communication subject using ontology languages, thereby capturing<br>
the transferring of the attribute characteristics in a social network. This is significant for<br>
obtaining the description information of subscribers functioning as main communication<br><br><br>
subjects.<br>
Besides launching a 1G mailbox to serve the subscribers, the Gmail service of<br>
Google company further built a subscriber relationship network through recommendations<br>
among net-friends, so as to obtain information such as social relationships of the<br>
subscribers, thereby generating some communication subscriber description information. In<br>
the early stage, new subscribers of Gmail could only obtain mailbox accounts through the<br>
invitations of old subscribers. Thereby, a social network is built by social relationship<br>
attributes of the subscribers collected through invitation authorities among net-friends.<br>
However, in practice, an old subscriber of Gmail may not only invite his friends. When<br>
Gmail first appeared, many Gmail owners sold their invitation authority in public on the<br>
Internet, and after Gmail became popular, it became easy to obtain Gmail invitations<br>
through the Internet. As a result, the social relationship information built on the basis of<br>
invitation authorities is not accurate. In other words, the generated communication<br>
subscriber description information is inaccurate.<br>
Another method for generating communication subscriber description<br>
information is shown below. The Email sending and receiving records of a subscriber are<br>
analyzed by a server to obtain the information of which type of Email addresses the<br>
subscriber contacts, and thus the subscriber description information can be generated<br>
according to the Email addresses information. However, Email providers can only build a<br>
simple contact network by analyzing the Email sending and receiving records. Such<br>
inadequate communication subscriber description information may not truly reflect the<br>
characteristics and requirements of the subscriber, and thus is inaccurate.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Accordingly, an embodiment of the present invention provides a system for<br>
generating communication subscriber description information. The system can<br>
automatically generate communication subscriber description information, so as to ensure<br><br><br>
the accuracy of the generated communication subscriber description information.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention include: presetting a subscriber<br><br><br>
information transferring strategy, obtaining communication record information, and<br>
determining whether a contact party identification (ID) information in the communication<br>
record information exists in generated subscriber labeled information. If the contact party<br>
identification (ID) information in the communication record information does not exist in<br>
generated subscriber labeled information, the qualified contact party ID information in the<br>
communication record information is recorded, according to an information transferring<br>
strategy of an unspecific subscriber in the preset subscriber information transferring strategy,<br>
into the communication subscriber description information of a communication subject. If<br>
the contact party identification (ID) information in the communication record information<br>
exists in generated subscriber labeled information, the qualified contact party ID<br>
information in the communication record information and the subscriber labeled<br>
information corresponding to the contact party ID information are recorded, according to an<br>
information transferring strategy of a specific subscriber in the preset subscriber<br>
information transferring strategy, into the communication subscriber description<br>
information of the communication subject.<br>
In order to make the objectives, technical scheme, and advantages of the present<br>
invention comprehensible, exemplary embodiments accompanied with figures are described<br>
in detail below.<br>
The present invention is applicable to communication behaviors such as voice<br>
communication, data communication, and short messages of a subscriber. Voice<br>
communication is taken as an example below for describing the whole realizing process.<br>
FIG 1 is a schematic diagram showing the configuration of a system for<br>
generating communication subscriber description information according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The embodiment of the system of the present invention includes an<br>
information labeling unit 10 adapted to label original information of a specific<br>
communication subscriber, and a subscriber information generating unit 12 adapted to<br>
generate communication subscriber description information according to communication<br><br><br>
records. The communication subscriber hereinafter is referred to as subscriber for short. The<br>
composition of the units and connections there-between will be illustrated in detail below.<br>
Firstly, the information labeling unit 10 includes a labeling module 100, an<br>
original resource database 101, an application template ontology library 102, and a specific<br>
subscriber labeling library 103.<br>
The original resource database 101 is adapted to record the original information<br>
of a subscriber to be labeled. The original information includes ID information and<br>
attributes describing the subscriber, for example, original data of an enterprise registered in<br>
the yellow pages, such as the class of the enterprise, enterprise name, telephone number,<br>
service introduction, district, address, fax, postcode, address, and Email. The class records<br>
leaf nodes of the trade catalog of the company, the telephone number of the company<br>
functions as the ID information, and the rest of the parameters serve as the attribute<br>
description information. It should be noted that, the specific subscriber herein refers to a<br>
labeled communication subscriber.<br>
For example, in an IM communication network, IM numbers are further<br>
classified as enterprise subscribers and ordinary subscribers, and thus the original resource<br>
database refers to information records of an IM enterprise subscriber. The same processing<br>
mode can be applied to services with numbers like Email.<br>
The application template ontology library 102 is adapted to build and store an<br>
application template describing a class and class attributes of an application for different<br>
applications. The class and class attributes come from a public or self-defined ontology in<br>
an industrial application field. In particular, directing to different applications, large classes,<br>
sub-classes thereof, ontology of class attributes are built according to the classification<br>
manner of the original resource data, and relationships between the classes and associations<br>
between the class attributes are defined. Meanwhile, the relationship between the classes<br>
and class attributes is defined to point out class attributes for describing each class and<br>
sub-classes thereof, and an application template of the class is deduced by the relationship.<br><br><br>
It should be noted that, if the original resource data has not been classified, it can be done<br>
manually, and meanwhile ontology of the class library is created. Herein, the application<br>
template is created on the basis of an Ontology Language. The creation method adopts a<br>
current technology, and can be accomplished by many current ontology creation tools, for<br>
example, Protege platform mentioned in the background of the invention, which will not be<br>
described in detail herein again.<br>
An application template includes two parts: an application template name for<br>
identifying the class of the application template, and application template parameters<br>
describing the class attributes of the class indicated by the application template name. The<br>
application template name is identical to the name of the class. When the application<br>
template parameters are set, each application template parameter is corresponding to a type<br>
tag. The application template parameters can be classified into transferable parameters and<br>
non-transferable parameters, or even more specified types. When a parameter is set as a<br>
transferable parameter, the parameter can be transferred to the subscriber as a subscriber<br>
description information record.<br>
Due to different characteristics, each industry needs specific application<br>
template parameters to describe its attributes. For example, in the auto industry, attributes of<br>
brands are employed for identifying auto models run or manufactured by a company. While<br>
in the restaurant industry, the attributes of brands may not exist, parameters describing the<br>
taste and decoration style are more often used. Therefore, different application templates<br>
can be set directing to leaf nodes of the classified catalog of different industries. Each<br>
application template has a uniquely allocated template name and application template<br>
parameter description directing to the industry having the leaf node.<br>
An application template of the auto sales class is taken as an example below, for<br>
illustrating possible application template parameters of a specific subscriber in the auto<br>
sales. Referring to Table 1:<br><br><br><br>
Table 1 describes possible content in an application template of auto sales in<br>
words. The parameters in practice implementation are set according to actual circumstances,<br>
which include, but not limited to, the content of Table 1.<br>
In practice, Ontology Language, for example, Web Ontology Language (OWL)<br>
can be used to describe and record an application template, and the details of the description<br>
belong to the prior art. The present invention emphasizes the creation of specific application<br>
templates for different applications (classes).<br>
The application template not only labels various application template<br>
parameters for classes, but also builds association relationships between different classes.<br>
For example, the association relationship between the auto sales in the auto class and the<br>
petrol sales in the chemical industry class can be built, which means the subscriber of auto<br>
sales may also be the subscriber of petrol sales at the same time. This transitive relationship<br>
may well contribute to the collection of subscriber attributes.<br>
The labeling module 100 is a logic processing module of the information<br>
labeling unit 10, adapted to label the original information of a subscriber. The original<br>
information of a subscriber to be labeled is obtained from the original resource database<br><br>
101. According to the class of the original information, an application template<br>
corresponding to the class is invoked from the application template ontology library 102.<br>
An application template name and parameter values of the application template parameter<br>
items corresponding to the application template in the original information are filled into<br>
the application template, so as to obtain the specific subscriber information, and store the<br>
obtained specific subscriber information in the specific subscriber labeling library 103.<br>
When labeling the attributes of a specific subscriber, different application<br>
templates can be invoked to label the specific subscriber information directing to<br>
subscribers in different types of industries.<br>
The specific subscriber labeling library 103 is adapted to store the labeled<br>
specific subscriber information.<br>
The labeled specific subscriber information includes, but not limited to, ID<br>
information of a specific subscriber such as telephone number, application template name<br>
of the specific subscriber, and description information of the specific subscriber. The<br>
description information of the specific subscriber includes, but not limited to, basic<br>
attributes and extended attributes. The specific subscriber information is stored in the<br>
specific subscriber labeling library 103 in a feasible storage manner. Table 2 shows an<br>
embodiment of the stored specific subscriber information:<br><br><br><br>
The information labeling unit 10 further includes a self-service module 104<br>
adapted to provide a subscriber-oriented interface, so as to facilitate the subscriber to update<br>
labeling results in the specific subscriber labeling library 103 through the labeling module<br>
100 by using the self-service module 104. If the subscriber is a system manager, the<br>
self-service module 104 serves as an operating platform like system interface. If the<br>
subscriber is a labeled subscriber, a client/server (C/S) architecture is adopted, in which the<br>
self-service module 104 serves as a client, and the labeling module 100 and the specific<br>
subscriber labeling library 103 serve as a server. After logging on the server through the<br>
client, the labeled subscriber can modify the labeled self-information through operations<br>
such as registration, logon, or information update at the client. Herein, as the C/S structure<br>
is a commonly-used architecture at present, and belongs to a technology known to those<br>
skilled in the art, so the details will not be described herein again. Further, the self-service<br>
module 104 may also be implemented as a client in a browser/server (B/S) architecture.<br>
Secondly, the subscriber information generating unit 12 includes a subscriber<br><br>
information generating module 120, a subscriber information base 121, a strategy pool 122,<br>
and a strategy setting module 123.<br>
The subscriber information generating module 120, a core module in the system<br>
of the present invention, is adapted to determine whether or not and how to generate the<br>
communication subscriber description information according to a subscriber information<br>
transferring strategy queried and invoked from the strategy pool 122, and further store the<br>
generated communication subscriber description information into the subscriber<br>
information base.<br>
The subscriber information generating module 120 obtains communication<br>
record information externally, and queries the specific subscriber labeling library 103 to<br>
determine whether communication objects in the communication records, i.e., ID field<br>
values of the contact parties are stored in the specific subscriber labeling library 103. If<br>
communication objects are not stored in the specific subscriber labeling library 103, ,<br>
qualified contact party ID information is added, according to an information transferring<br>
strategy of an unspecific subscriber in the subscriber information transferring strategy, into<br>
the communication subscriber description information of a communication subject, and the<br>
communication subscriber description information is further stored in the subscriber<br>
information base 121. If communication objects are stored in the specific subscriber<br>
labeling library 103, qualified contact party ID information and the corresponding<br>
subscriber labeled information of the contact party ID information stored in the specific<br>
subscriber labeling library 103 are added, according to an information transferring strategy<br>
of a specific subscriber in the subscriber information transferring strategy, into the<br>
communication subscriber description information of a communication subject, and the<br>
communication subscriber description information is further stored in the subscriber<br>
information base 121.<br>
If the communication object is a specific subscriber in the specific subscriber<br>
labeling library, the subscriber labeled information is added into the subscriber information<br><br>
base 121, that is, a preferential attribute is recorded in the communication subscriber<br>
description information of the communication subject. If the preferential attribute already<br>
exists, the preferential attribute information is adjusted, for example, to add in new<br>
transferable parameters or alter the corresponding weights of the parameters; if the<br>
preferential attribute already does not exist, the preferential attribute information is added.<br>
Herein, the communication subject refers to a home subscriber of a<br>
communication record, for example, a calling party number subscriber in a calling party bill<br>
record, and thus the communication subject is identified by the subscriber number fields in<br>
the bill record.<br>
The strategy setting module 123 is a system-manager-oriented management<br>
interface, for setting various subscriber information transferring strategies. In practice,<br>
different classes have specific characteristics, so different subscriber information<br>
transferring strategies should be set. The already set subscriber information transferring<br>
strategies are stored in the strategy pool 122.<br>
The subscriber information transferring strategy includes conditions for<br>
building attributes of an unspecific subscriber and conditions for building attributes of a<br>
specific subscriber. Here, the unspecific subscriber, relative to the specific subscriber, refers<br>
to a subscriber not existing in the specific subscriber labeling library 103. According to the<br>
conditions for building attributes of an unspecific subscriber, it is determined whether or<br>
not to add the unspecific subscriber into the communication subscriber description<br>
information of a communication subject; according to the conditions for building attributes<br>
of a specific subscriber, it is determined whether or not to add the specific subscriber into<br>
the communication subscriber description information of a communication subject.<br>
The subscriber information transferring strategy is a description combination of<br>
field value restrictions, and the fields here come from the communication records. A<br>
subscriber information transferring strategy can be expressed in Formula (1) as follows:<br><br><br>
In Formula (1), I represents the content of a subscriber information transferring<br>
strategy, Q represents different field values, i.e., restrictions, and ∩ represents an AND<br>
relationship between the previous and succeeding restrictions. As shown in Formula (1), it<br>
is considered qualified to meet the subscriber information transferring strategy only when<br>
all the restrictions Q1-Qn are satisfied. It should be noted that, Formula (1) is only one way<br>
of expressing the subscriber information transferring strategy, and the relationship between<br>
the previous and succeeding restrictions can also be OR, or partially AND while partially<br>
OR, which will not be illustrated in detail herein again.<br>
Table 3 shows the content and definitions of subscriber information transferring<br>
strategies for specific subscribers with application template names as auto sales class and<br>
auto maintenance class:<br><br>
The strategy pool 122 is adapted to store and provide various subscriber<br><br>
information transferring strategies for the subscriber information generating module. In the<br>
strategy pool 122, one application template name is corresponding to one subscriber<br>
information transferring strategy. The subscriber information generating module 120<br>
queries and invokes the corresponding subscriber information transferring strategy in the<br>
strategy pool 120 according to the application template name of the original resource data.<br>
The subscriber information base 121 is adapted to store the subscriber<br>
description information file of a communication subject. The subscriber description<br>
information file includes, but not limited to, identification IDs, social relationship attributes,<br>
and preferential attributes of the subscriber.<br>
The social relationship attributes record unspecific subscribers, specific<br>
subscribers, and contact weight between subscribers who meet the conditions for building<br>
the social relationships. The contact weight is a parameter showing the degree of<br>
relationship between the subscribers, and can be obtained by certain combination operations<br>
based on a specific field, so as to present the contact frequency or intimacy between the<br>
communication subject and unspecific or specific subscribers. A combination operation is<br>
taken here as an example. Assuming that the contact weight is represented by S and the<br>
specific field set by the system is represented by P, Formula (2) is obtained as follows:<br><br>
The preferential attributes are mainly formed by transferable parameters of<br>
different application templates, for describing characteristics of specific subscribers in<br>
already built social relationships. After meeting the conditions for building social<br>
relationships, the characteristics are transferred to the communication subject for describing<br>
the communication subscriber description information of the communication subject. Table<br>
4 shows an example of a subscriber information record. Subscriber 1 represents a<br>
communication subject. The communication subscriber description information of the<br><br>
communication subject includes information of an unspecific subscriber 1, an unspecific<br>
subscriber 2, a specific subscriber 1, and a specific subscriber 2. The preferential attributes<br>
are formed by transferable parameters of an application template 1 and an application<br>
template 2, for describing characteristics of the specific subscriber 1 and the specific<br>
subscriber 2 in already built social relationships.<br><br><br><br><br>
In practice, the information labeling unit 10 and the subscriber information<br>
generating unit 12 can be two independent servers.<br>
Further, if the communication record information obtained externally by the<br>
subscriber information generating module 120 does not include the fields described in the<br>
restrictions of the subscriber information transferring strategy, the system of the present<br>
invention further includes a preprocessing unit 11 adapted to preprocess the communication<br>
records. In particular, a preset target field is extracted from the fields of the original<br>
communication record to form a new record, and the new record is stored. The target field<br>
at least includes a communication subject ID field identifying the owner of the<br>
communication record, a contact party ID field identifying the communication objects, and<br>
an additional field generated by processing the communication record according to preset<br>
requirements.<br>
The preprocessing unit 11 mainly includes a record preprocessing module 110<br>
and a new record library 111.<br>
The record preprocessing module 110 is adapted to preprocess the externally<br>
obtained communication record information, extract a preset target field from the fields of<br>
the original communication record to form a new record, and store the new record.<br>
Meanwhile, the new record further includes an additional field generated by processing the<br>
communication record according to preset requirements. The new communication record<br>
composed of the target field and the additional field is stored in the new record library 111.<br>
Herein, take the preprocessing of an externally obtained original phone bill as<br>
an example for illustration. Table 5 shows an original phone bill record, including<br>
subscriber number, serial number, place of the call, type of the calling/called party, type of<br>
the call, counterpart's number, date of the call, time of the call, duration of the call, mobile<br>
phone charge, and toll call charge. It is assumed that the preset target fields are subscriber<br>
number, serial number, counterpart's number, the number of calls, and total call duration.<br>
Seen from Table 5, the subscriber number, serial number, and counterpart's number can be<br><br>
directly extracted from the original phone bill record. However, the number of calls and<br>
total call duration do not exist in the original phone bill record, and can be obtained by<br>
consolidating the same bill records, i.e., consolidating bill records with the same contact<br>
party ID field values, which refer to bill records with the same counterpart's number.<br>
Further, the consolidation here actually means summation. For example, the total call<br>
duration of a counterpart's number A can be obtained by merely adding together the call<br>
duration in each record under the counterpart's number A in the original phone bill record.<br><br>
The new record library 111 is adapted to store the preprocessed communication<br>
records, and the subscriber information generating module 120 obtains the required<br>
communication records from the new record library 111. The record fields are target fields<br>
preset by the record preprocessing module 110. According to the above example, the bill<br>
records preprocessed and stored in the new record library 111 are shown in Table 6:<br><br>
In Table 6, the subscriber number field means that the bill record belongs to the<br>
communication subscriber corresponding to the subscriber number, number of calls<br>
represents the total entries in the same bill, and the total call duration refers to the sum of<br>
call durations in the same bill.<br><br>
The system for generating communication subscriber description information<br>
provided by the embodiment of the present invention is described above, and the method<br>
for generating communication subscriber description information according to the present<br>
invention will be described in detail below accompanied by FIG 1. FIG. 2 is a flow chart of<br>
the method for generating communication subscriber description information according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention. The method can be controlled and implemented by<br>
a preset timer, or performed under the command from a background manager. The method<br>
mainly includes the following blocks.<br>
Block 200: a subscriber information transferring strategy is preset.<br>
The subscriber information transferring strategy includes conditions for<br>
building attributes of an unspecific subscriber and conditions for building attributes of a<br>
specific subscriber. According to the conditions for building attributes of an unspecific<br>
subscriber, it is determined whether or not to add the information of an unspecific<br>
subscriber into the communication subscriber description information of a communication<br>
subject; and according to the conditions for building attributes of a specific subscriber, it is<br>
determined whether or not to add the information of a specific subscriber into the<br>
communication subscriber description information of a communication subject. The<br>
information transferring strategy has already been illustrated in detail during the description<br>
of the strategy setting module 123, so the details will not be given herein again.<br>
Block 201: The communication record information is obtained, and it is<br>
determined whether the contact party ID information in the communication record<br>
information exists in the generated subscriber labeled information. If the contact party ID<br>
information exists in the generated subscriber labeled information, the process proceeds to<br>
Step 203; if the contact party ID information does not exist in the generated subscriber<br>
labeled information, the process proceeds to Block 202.<br>
The communication records can be obtained in various manners, for example,<br>
reading from a database particularly for storing communication records. The actual<br><br>
implementation has nothing to do with the present invention, so the details will not be<br>
illustrated herein again.<br>
Block 202: According to an information transferring strategy of an unspecific<br>
subscriber in the preset subscriber information transferring strategy, the qualified contact<br>
party ID information in the communication record information is recorded into the<br>
communication subscriber description information of a communication subject, and then<br>
the process is ended.<br>
The contact party ID may be telephone numbers.<br>
Block 203: According to an information transferring strategy of a specific<br>
subscriber in the preset subscriber information transferring strategy, the qualified contact<br>
party ID information in the communication record information and the subscriber labeled<br>
information corresponding to the contact party ID information are recorded into the<br>
communication subscriber description information of a communication subject.<br>
In this block, the subscriber labeled information corresponding to the contact<br>
party ID information may be the transferable information obtained from the generated<br>
subscriber labeled information after determining that the contact party ID information in the<br>
communication record information exists in the generated subscriber labeled information in<br>
Block 201, or the transferable information obtained from the generated subscriber labeled<br>
information according to the contact party ID after the qualified conditions are determined<br>
in Block 203.<br>
A method for recording the subscriber labeled information includes traversing<br>
preset preferential attributes in the subscriber description information of a communication<br>
subject subscriber, and determining whether the class of the subscriber labeled information<br>
exists in the preferential attributes. If the class does not exist in the preferential attributes,<br>
the class of the subscriber labeled information and transferable parameters therein are added<br>
into the preferential attributes of the communication subject subscriber. If the class exist in<br><br>
the preferential attributes, it is further determined whether the transferable parameters in the<br>
subscriber labeled information exist in the preferential attributes, if the transferable<br>
parameters exist in the preferential attributes, the process ends; if the transferable<br>
parameters do not exist in the preferential attributes, the transferable parameters in the<br>
subscriber labeled information are added into the preferential attributes.<br>
In this Block, the method for generating the subscriber labeled information is<br>
shown in FIG 3. FIG 3 is a flow chart illustrating information labeling according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the following blocks.<br>
Block 300: An original resource data record is extracted, and the class name of<br>
the class of the record is obtained.<br>
Herein, an original resource data record is a record in the communication record<br>
information.<br>
Block 301: According to the obtained class name, an application template<br>
corresponding to the class name is invoked, and according to fields contained in the<br>
invoked application template, corresponding field values in the record are recorded into the<br>
application template.<br>
In this block, the application template is preset.<br>
If parts of the fields in the application template have no corresponding fields in<br>
the original resource data record, the following two processing methods can be adopted.<br>
In method 1, the field is ignored, and the value of the field in the application<br>
template is set as null. The value of the field can be allocated manually by the enterprise or<br>
manager through a self-service platform.<br>
In method 2, if some fields in the application template do not have definite<br>
corresponding fields in the original resource data record, but some fields in the original<br>
resource data record may include the information required by the fields in the application<br><br>
template, the fields in the original resource data record that may include the information<br>
required by the fields in the application template are referred to as ambiguous fields. FIG. 4<br>
is a flow chart of a method for recording a subscriber application template according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the following blocks.<br>
Block 400: A field is extracted from the application template.<br>
Block401: It is determined whether the field exists in the original resource data<br>
record. If the field exists in the original resource data record, the process proceeds to Block<br>
405; if the field does not exist in the original resource data record, the process proceeds to<br>
Block 402.<br>
Block 402: It is determined whether an ambiguous field of the field exists in the<br>
original resource data record. If the ambiguous field exists in the original resource data<br>
record, the process proceeds to Block 403; if the ambiguous field does not exist in the<br>
original resource data record, the process proceeds to Block 404.<br>
Block 403: A key field is analyzed and extracted from the ambiguous field, and<br>
a value of the key field is recorded in the application template, and the process ends.<br>
In this block, a current segmentation can be used to perform split analysis on<br>
the ambiguous field to extract effective key words. The split analysis can be carried out in<br>
various ways, and the implementation thereof is known to those skilled in the art, so the<br>
details will not be described herein again.<br>
In this manner, a mapping table between some fields in the application template<br>
and their corresponding ambiguous fields need to be preset in the labeling module 100.<br>
Thereby, the ambiguous fields mapping to the fields extracted from the application template<br>
can be queried through the mapping table. Meanwhile, in this manner, the labeling module<br>
100 further has a split analysis function.<br>
Block 404: The value of the field in the application template is set as null, and<br><br>
the process ends.<br>
Block 405: The value of the field is recorded in the application template.<br>
A mapping table is shown in Table 7 as an example for illustration:<br><br>
It is assumed that a data in the original resource data record records the<br>
registration information of an auto sales company. The registration information includes the<br>
company's telephone number, name, industry, address, and profile with descriptions<br>
involving "BMW". The parameters in the invoked auto sales application template include<br>
telephone number, company name, address, and brand, and the brand field has several<br>
alternative values such as MAZDA, BMW, NISSAN, and VW When the subscriber<br>
information is labeled, values of the telephone number, company name, and address fields<br>
extracted from the original record are written into the corresponding fields in the auto sales<br>
application template. As the brand field has no corresponding field in the original resource<br>
data record, its ambiguous field obtained from the mapping table in Table 7 is company<br>
profile. Split analysis is performed on the company profile field in the original resource data<br>
record, and "BMW" is set as a value of the brand field and written into the brand field of<br>
the auto sales application template.<br>
Block 302: The application template after recording is stored.<br>
Till now, the labeling of the subscriber information is finished, and the<br>
subscriber is referred to as a specific subscriber.<br>
Block 303: It is determined whether original resource database exists. If the<br><br>
original resource database exists, the process returns to Step 300; otherwise, the process<br>
ends.<br>
It can be seen from the description of the information labeling unit 10 in FIG. 1<br>
that, the labeled specific subscriber information is stored in the specific subscriber labeling<br>
library 103.<br>
Seen from the information labeling process in FIG 3, a very important step is<br>
calling an application template to describe a specific subscriber. The application template is<br>
designed based on an Ontology Language. After the original resource data is written into the<br>
application template, the labeling module 100 automatically generates the labeled<br>
information file of the specific subscriber information described by the original resource<br>
data, thus finishing the attribute information labeling of the specific subscriber. Information<br>
of two auto sales companies before and after being labeled is given below for comparison.<br><br>
In Table 8, the characters underlined and in boldface are key words split from<br>
the ambiguous field "Services" in the original resource data record.<br><br>
After being labeled, the original resource data information is written into the<br>
application template to form the labeled information in Table 9:<br><br><br><br>
In Table 9, the italic characters are labeled information.<br>
Further, if the obtained communication record information does not include the<br>
fields described in the restrictions of the subscriber information transferring strategy, the<br>
method of the present invention may further preprocess the communication records, i.e.,<br>
extract a preset target field from the original communication record fields to form a new<br>
record and store the new record. The target field at least includes a communication subject<br>
ID field identifying the owner of the communication records, a contact party ID field<br>
identifying the communication objects, and an additional field generated by processing the<br>
communication record according to preset requirements.<br><br>
The target field is set by a manager in a way varied with the format of the<br>
communication records. An example of preprocessing an original phone bill is shown<br>
below for illustrating a preprocessing method.<br>
Assuming a phone bill of a subscriber 13526843612 for the first ten days in<br>
June is shown in Table 10:<br><br>
It is assumed that the preprocessing is performed on the format of the original<br>
phone bill, and the set target fields include subscriber number, serial number, and<br>
counterpart's number, i.e., a contact party ID field. The aforementioned processing on the<br>
communication records according to requirements is to consolidate the bill records under<br>
the same counterpart's number, and the added additional fields include the number of calls<br><br>
and total call duration. The new records formed after consolidating are shown in Table 11 :<br><br>
Assuming that it is possible to obtain the distance of a call by some means, the<br>
call distance may well serve as a parameter to determine the degree of relationship between<br>
the two parties in communication.<br>
An example for illustrating the generation process of the subscriber information<br>
is shown below with reference to FIG. 1. FIG. 5 is a flow chart of an embodiment the<br>
present invention, including the following blocks.<br>
Block 500: It is determined whether subscriber communication records exist. If<br>
subscriber communication records exist, the process proceeds to Block 501; if subscriber<br>
communication records do not exist, the process ends.<br>
Herein, it is assumed that the subscriber information generating module 120<br>
extracts a group of preprocessing bills from the new record library 111, as shown in Table<br>
12. The subscriber number is the communication subject ID field, and the counterpart's<br>
number is the contact party ID field. Therefore, the determination result of this block is that<br>
the subscriber communication records exist.<br><br><br><br>
Blocks 501-503: A subscriber communication record is obtained, and a<br>
communication subject ID is obtained from the record. It is determined whether the<br>
communication subject information mapping to the communication subject ID exists. If the<br>
communication subject information exists, the process proceeds to Block 504; if the<br>
communication subject information does not exist, a subscriber information record of the<br>
communication subject is created.<br>
In this step, it is assumed that a subscriber communication record extracted by<br>
the subscriber information generating module 120 is as shown in Table 13.<br><br>
The subscriber information generating module 120 traverses the subscriber<br>
information base 121, and determines whether the subscriber number 13526843612 is<br>
recorded in the subscriber information base 121. If the subscriber number 13526843612 is<br>
not recorded in the subscriber information base 121, a subscriber information record file (as<br>
shown in Table 4) of the subscriber is created, i.e., generating a null subscriber description<br>
information record for the subscriber 13526843612 in the subscriber information base.<br>
Block 504: A contact party ID is obtained from the subscriber communication<br><br>
record.<br>
The subscriber information generating module 120 reads a contact party ID<br>
number of the communication record shown in Table 13, i.e., the counterpart's number<br>
13343857303.<br>
Block 505: It is determined whether the labeled information of the contact party<br>
exists. If the labeled information exists, the process proceeds to Step 507; if the labeled<br>
information does not exist, the process proceeds to Step 506.<br>
In this block, it is assumed that the subscriber information generating module<br>
120 traverses the specific subscriber labeling library 103, and finds out by query that the<br>
counterpart's number 13343857303 has not been labeled.<br>
Block 506: An information transferring strategy of an unspecific subscriber is<br>
invoked, and the process proceeds to Block 508.<br>
In this block, it is assumed that the information transferring strategy of the<br>
unspecific subscriber called by the subscriber information generating module 120 from the<br>
strategy pool 122 is: IP= {(the number of calls&gt; 3) ∩ (total call duration&gt; 00:30:00)}.<br>
Block 507: An information transferring strategy of a specific subscriber is<br>
invoked.<br>
Block 508: It is determined whether the conditions are satisfied. If the<br>
conditions are satisfied, the process proceeds to Block 509; if the conditions are not<br>
satisfied, the process returns to Block 500.<br>
In this block, according to the fields described in the information transferring<br>
strategy IP of the unspecific subscriber, the subscriber information generating module 120<br>
reads the number of calls and total call duration in the subscriber communication record<br>
shown in Table 13 in sequence, so as to determine whether the conditions set in IP are<br>
satisfied.<br><br>
Apparently, in this embodiment, seen from Table 13, the number of calls is four,<br>
and the total call duration is 01:17:19, both meeting the conditions set in IP that the number<br>
of calls &gt; 3 and the total call duration &gt; 00:30:00.<br>
Block 509: The information of the contact party is recorded, and the process<br>
returns to Block 500.<br>
The contact party 13343857303 is added into the subscriber description<br>
information of 13526843612.<br>
A contact weight of the contact party can be further generated and recorded. It is<br>
assumed that the contact weight is a ratio of the number of calls with the contact party in<br>
the total number of calls during a period of time. As shown in Table 12, in a period of four<br><br>
Through the above processes, the information of the unspecific subscriber<br>
13343857303 serves as the subscriber description information of the communication<br>
subject 13526843621.<br>
In the same way, a second record is extracted, and it is assumed that the queried<br>
counterpart's number 13892983773 in the second record is an unspecific subscriber. Seen<br>
from the process of FIG 5, similarly, an information transferring strategy of an unspecific<br>
subscriber is called, and it can be found out that the number of calls in the second record is<br>
once and the total call duration is 00:02:26, which do not meet the conditions set in Ip, so<br>
this bill record should be ignored and abandoned.<br>
A third record is extracted, and it is assumed that the queried counterpart's<br>
number 0755-26710686 in the third record is a specific subscriber. The contact party<br>
0755-26710686 belongs to the auto sales class, and the labeled information of the contact<br>
party is shown in Table 9. Seen from the process of FIG. 5, in Step 507, the specific<br>
subscriber labeling library 103 reads the application template name of 0755-26710686 from<br><br>
the labeled information, and invokes an information transferring strategy of a specific<br>
subscriber mapping to the application template from the strategy pool 122. It is assumed<br>
that the information transferring strategy of the specific subscriber is: I = {(the number of<br>
calls&gt; 1)}. Seen from the third record, the number of calls made between the subscriber<br>
number 13526843612 and the counterpart's number 0755-26710686 are two, which meets<br>
the condition set in I, i.e., the number of calls&gt; 1. Therefore, the information of the contact<br>
party 0755-26710686 is added into the subscriber description information of the<br>
communication subject 13526843612. Herein, it should be noted that, besides adding the<br>
counterpart's number 0755-26710686 into the subscriber description information of the<br>
communication subject 13526843612, transferable parameters in the corresponding<br>
subscriber labeled information of the counterpart's number 0755-26710686 is also added.<br>
Further, a contact weight of the contact party is generated and recorded. It is<br>
assumed that the contact weight is a ratio of the number of calls with the contact party in<br>
the total number of calls during a period of time. As shown in Table 12, in a period of four<br><br>
As the contact party 0755-26710686 is a labeled specific subscriber, a method for<br>
recording the transferable parameters in the corresponding subscriber labeled information of<br>
the counterpart's number 0755-26710686 is adding corresponding preferential attributes in<br>
the subscriber description information. In particular, the method includes traversing the<br>
preferential attributes of the communication subject subscriber, and determining whether<br>
the preferential attributes of the communication subject subscriber include attribute records<br>
of the auto sales class. In this embodiment, assuming that it is the first time for the<br>
communication subject subscriber to contact a specific subscriber of the auto sales class, the<br>
auto sales class records and corresponding transferable parameters are directly added into<br>
the subscriber preferential attributes. And in this embodiment, it is assumed that the<br>
transferable parameters in the auto sales template are brand and services.<br><br>
A fourth record is extracted. It is assumed that the contact party 0755-82391435<br>
belongs to the auto sales class, and the labeled information of the contact party is shown in<br>
Table 9. The processing flow is identical to the third record and only varies in adding the<br>
preferential attributes. As the preferential attribute records of the auto sales class already<br>
exist, when the record is processed, it needs to determine whether the transferable<br>
parameters in the labeled information of the contact party 0755-82391435 exist in the<br>
preferential attribute records. If the transferable parameters exist in the preferential attribute<br>
records, no operation will be performed, or the transferable parameters in the labeled<br>
information of the contact party 0755-82391435 are added to overwrite the original records;<br>
otherwise, the transferable parameters in the labeled information of the contact party<br>
0755-82391435 are added into the preferential attributes, so as to update the preferential<br>
attributes.<br>
According to the process in FIG. 5, after the four records in Table 12 are<br>
processed, the description information of the subscriber is generated as shown in Table 14:<br><br><br><br>
The phone bill above is only taken as an embodiment for illustration. The<br>
scheme of the present invention is also applicable to communication modes like Email and<br><br>
IM, for example, labeling the enterprise Email and IM numbers. Moreover, the scheme of<br>
the present invention is also applicable to data services process like ring back tone (RBT)<br>
download. For example, the present invention can be used for creating ontology description<br>
templates corresponding to various RBTs, labeling the RBTs provided by service providers<br>
(SPs) as specific subscribers, and analyzing the subscriber description information in<br>
service records of the subscriber data services.<br>
Though illustration and description of the present disclosure have been given<br>
