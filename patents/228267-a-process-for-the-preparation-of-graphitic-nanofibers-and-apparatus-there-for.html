				<td>The subject application relates to the process for the preparation of graphitic nanofibre and apperatus therefor , through thermal cracking by using acetylene <br>
gas, to be used as hydrogen storage material     <br>
The embodiment of the invention resides in the preparation of acetylene gas used in the thermal cracking and apparatus for the same.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The rapid depletion of natural resources and serious global environmental problems are connected with the overuse of fossil fuels. There is therefore a search for possible alternative sources of energy to replace fossil fuels. There are quite a number of primary energy sources available such as thermonuclear energy, nuclear reactors, solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, geothermal energy and the like. In contrast to the fossil fuels, in most cases, these energy sources can not be used directly, such as fuels for transportation and thus they must be converted into fuels necessitating a new energy carrier. In order to overcome the drawbacks, associated with the existing energy sources, hydrogen has been found to be an ideal fuel and versatile energy carrier.<br>
However, the problem of storage of hydrogen has persistently needs attention and in this regard carbon has been found to be the most suitable storage material for the storage of hydrogen.<br>
Due to the high surface area and abundant pore volume, porous carbon is considered to be the good absorbent. In case of conventional porous carbon, the hydrogen uptake is proportional to is surface area and pore volume, while the high hydrogen absorption capacity can be obtained at very low temperatures such as liquid nitrogen temperature.<br>
However, it has been found that in spite of their relatively small surface area and pore volume, carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers show very surprising high hydrogen storage capacity. In addition to the close shell carbon structure , graphitic nanotubules which get formed through wrapping of graphitic sheets so as to eliminate dangling bonds. The another carbon variant, which has been innovated, corresponds to the arrangement of graphitic network planes i around an axis. These graphitic planes are parallel/perpendicular/inclined (herring bone) to the fiber axis. These new carbon variants have been termed as graphitic nanofibers.<br>
The high hydrogen storage capacity have been found precisely highest in the graphitic nanofibers, which are achieved by the thermal cracking of hydrocarbon gas. However, it has been found that the actual hydrogen storage capacity depends upon the treatment imparted to graphitic nanofibers.<br>
â€¢<br>
The main objective of the subject invention is to prepare the graphitic nanofibers having high hydrogen storage capacity. The graphitic nanofibers of the subject application are capable of storing hydrogen at densities much higher than the earlier material namely hydrides for example LaNi5H6, FeTiH^g and the like, where the storage capacity at ambient conditions are ~1.5wt.%. On the other hand, in Graphitic nanotubules and graphitic nanofibers, the storage capacity is ~ 10 to 15 wt.% and as high as -67% also.<br>
The graphitic nanofibers of the subject invention are prepared by the thermal cracking of carbon rich gas preferably acetylene gas.<br>
The graphitic nanofibers are prepared by the thermal cracking of the acetylene gas. The thermal cracking or decomposition was done by passing the gas in a silica tube having an inlet ports for the gases , hydrogen and helium.    The presence of graphitic nanofibers  has  been     confirmed  by<br>
conducting the X-ray diffraction and more particularly transmission electron microscope technique (imaging and diffraction).<br>
For effective thermal cracking, the fine Ni and Cu were taken in a ceramic boat, placed in the said silica tube , acting as catalyst. The material in the ceramic boat is passivated by first creating the vacuum and then passing the hydrogen and helium gases into said silica tube. The catalyst passivation was achieved by heating the metal catalyst powder in hydrogen and helium gases at ambient conditions for one hour in the resistance heated furnace.<br>
The role of the catalyst in the preparation of graphitic nanofibers is in the formation of solid solution of .carbon in the metal catalyst followed by diffusion of carbon formation of graphitic nanofibers. The cracking was carried out in the stationary mode. The thermal cracking of the gas was achieved by heating in the pressure of Ni and Cu catalyst powders. The tube was then allowed to cool and carbon deposited near the tube regions is flushed with a mixture of helium gas and fresh air, before finally collecting the carbon deposits.<br>
The embodiment of the invention resides in the process for the preparation of graphitic nanofibers to be used as hydrogen storage material through thermal cracking by passing acetylene gas, comprising the steps of, creating vacuum in the silica tube placed in the heat resistance furnace having catalyst in it, passivating the said catalyst by passing gases 8-12 % each of hydrogen and helium in the said silica tube at a pressure of 38-42 torr; heating the said catalyst material placed in the said silica tube at a temperature of 600-640 degrees C; passing acetylene gas and hydrogen gas in the ratio of 2:1 at a pressure of 140-165 torr in the said silica tube to allow the thermal cracking of the said gases to produce carbon deposit; cooling the said furnace at a rate of 4-6 degrees per minute, removing the carbon deposit from the said silica tube, in the form of graphitic nanofibers. The catalyst used in the subject application is Ni and cobalt in the ratio of 98% : 2%, having the particle size of<br>
said Ni from 0.2 to 0.5Âµm and said cobalt from 0.20-0.27Âµm, specifically, the particle size of the said Ni is 0.4Âµm and said cobalt is 0.25Âµm. The said acetylene gas is prepared by reacting the calcium carbide with water in a container.<br>
