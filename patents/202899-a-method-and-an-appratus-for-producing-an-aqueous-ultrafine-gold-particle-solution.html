				<td>The present invention relates to a method of producing an aqueous ultrafine gold particle solution and an apparatus therefor.<br>
Since ancient times gold has been highly valued as the most important precious metal and mainly used in the form of ornaments or treasures. Recently, gold has also been recognized to be effective in promoting human health and used in a pure gold health bracelet, Japanese sake containing gold leaves, and the like. However, the effectiveness of these products in health is not sufficiently recognized although they are distinguished as luxury items containing expensive pure gold. Lately, in response to health-oriented social trends, health promoting effect of gold have again attracted an attention and it has been found that the health promoting effects are more remarkable in die form of gold ions or ultrafine gold particles than in the form of simple gold or gold leaves.<br>
Potential of gold ions and fine gold particles being effective in promoting health or healing diseases has attracted a great deal of attention and a considerable contribution of gold to health has been known ("Golden Water Cures Intractable, Serious Diseases"by Tofu Takada). Therefore, further technological development, in particular in applied utilization of an aqueous solution or aqueous dispersion of gold ions or fine gold particles, is needed. However, several problems remain to be solved in implementation of such technology.<br>
As mentioned above, water products containing fine gold particles are also known (ditto, page 64). However, in most products, gold leaves or gold powders are simply dispersed in water. It is extremely difficult to dissolve gold ions or fine gold particles in water and dissolution methods so far available are limited to those with the use of aqua regia or gold electrolyte.<br>
In such conventional method, requirements in terms of production cost and economic efficiency are not satisfied and moreover, technological problems such that health-promoting function cannot be fully exhibited remain to be solved.<br>
In order to solve these problems in conventional methods and realize the potentional<br><br>
of gold ions and fine gold particles being effective in promoting health or healing diseases, technological development in this field might be in progress. However, only a few techniques of this field have been disclosed in patent publications that are generally known to precisely reflect the progress in technological development, which indicates that potentiality in technological development in this field is still great<br>
The few disclosed prior arts mentioned above include Japanese Utility Model No, 304628 in which an organic antibacterial agent, such as antibacterial gold ions immobilized onto an ion exchange group of zeolite is admixed with an polyolefin mold resin in order to provide an antibacterial tank for drinking water that can prevent unwanted bacteria from invading through the wall of the tank and avert detrimental effect caused by chemicals dissolved without spoiling the flavor of the drinking water, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H9-220580 in which in order to provide mineral water containing minerals, such as gold ions, that is useful in the human body, mineral carriers are suspended in water and then the minerals are released into water by stimulation by mineral release stimulating means, such as acid addition and electrolysis; Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H9-10772 in which in order to produce an inexpensive bactericide, antiseptic water having excellent bactericide activity, a heavy metal such as gold is dissolved into acidic ionic water having a pH 2.6 to 4.5 produced using an electrolytic water purification system or oxidation potential water having a pH lower than 2.7; and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H5-280841 in which in order to produce a health ice product having foreign matters, such as gold leaves, evenly dispersed in an ice block, gold leaves are evenly admixed with crushed granular ice while stirring, the granular ice mixed with the foreign matter is packed into an ice-making can, and water is gradually injected from the bottom of the ice-making can to form ice.<br>
However, virtually all of these conventional techniques enclosed are far from suitable means to solve the abovementioned problems and cannot basically solve the problems, although the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H9-10772 is noticeable, in which in order to provide mineral water curtaining minerals, such as gold ions, that is useful in the human body, mineral carriers are suspended in water and then the minerals are released into water by stimulation by mineral release stimulating means, such as acid addition and electrolysis.<br>
Utilization of activity of gold ions and fine gold particles in physiologically active materials, health food materials and pharmaceuticals is important as technobgy directly<br><br>
iciaieu 10 everyoay me.  i neir application wiu become more Sequent in future and thus the development of technology in this field is highly expected<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors intensively studied the process of producing health water containing ultrafine gold particles in prospect of possibility that health can be promoted in extremely simple way and various symptoms can be improved by drinking water containing gold ions or fine gold particles, and thus completed the present invention.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
As mentioned above, potential of gold ions and fine gold particles being effective in promoting health or healing diseases is great and further technological development has been expected. Possible basic applied forms can be an aqueous solution or aqueous dispersion of gold ions or fine gold particles; however, several problems remain to be solved to implement these forms. For example, it is extremely difficult to dissolve gold ions or fine gold particles in water and only methods so far available are to admixing of gold leaves or gold powders with water or to use gold electrolyte. However, in such conventional methods, technological problems, such that requirements in terms of production cost and economic efficiency are not satisfied, that health promoting function cannot be fully exhibited, and that safeness of using chemical electrolyte to die human body is not confirmed, remain to be solved.<br>
Thus, although utilization of gold ions and fine gold particles for use in physiologically active materials, health food materials and pharmaceuticals has been highly expected, concrete technology has not been satisfactorily developed.<br>
Accordingly, an objective of the present invention is to solve the abovementioned problems to provide an aqueous solution of gold ions and fine gold particles and then utilize the resulting solution in the field of health promotioa<br>
The present invention is to contribute to the technological development and implementation of application for effective use of gold ions and fine gold particles by solving the abovementioned problems and thus develop a novel process for producing an aqueous fine gold particle solution, an apparatus therefor, and an aqueous health drink utilizing the aqueous fine gold particle solution.<br>
The present invention is greatly characterized in that an aqueous ultrafine gold particle solution is produced by combusting a gas mixture consisting of hydrogen and oxygen in highly pressurized water in which gold leaf fragments are suspended and then heating and melting the gold leaf fragments by the resulting combustion gas to melt them, and made into<br><br>
an aqueous health drink. A test by monitors confirmed that the water actually obtained according to the present invention has a marked efFect in improving physical conditions and recovering from fatigue.<br>
In the present invention, an aqueous solution of fine gold particles means water in which ultrafine gold particles look like being dissolved seemingly and it does not mean water in which gold powders or gold leaves are simply suspended.<br>

Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Conventionally, an aqueous gold ion solution is generally produced by using an electrolyte known to be used for gold plating, which is poor in ion generation efficiency, and furthermore, the resulting product can be hazardous to the human body and thus its use is limited On the other hand, gold particles are insoluble in water, therefore, when fine gold particles are dispersed in water, their total surface area is small for the weight of the gold<br><br>
mixed, which results in poor cost efficiency.  Thus this kind of methods is technologically unsatisfactory.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors intensively studied the improvement of these conventional techniques and considered that the abovementioned methods with various problems can be improved by dissolving ultrafine gold particles that are finer than conventional fine particles, and thus conducted research on methods for producing an aqueous ultrafine gold particle solution. As a result of repeated trial and error, the present inventors accomplished a novel method in which a gas mixture consisting of hydrogen and oxygen is combusted in highly pressurized water and then gold leaf fiagments are heated by the resulting combustion gas, and thus completed the present invention.<br>
The present invention is to realize the production and utilization of water in which ultrafine gold particles having a diameter as small as 1-2 figures in micron order, much smaller than any of the abovementioned conventional fine gold particles, are dissolved. This water product is furthermore improved in its high functions, such as health promoting activity, than water products in which gold leaves or fine gold particles are suspended, and is confirmed to be characteristically as safe as ordinary water.<br>
A primary feature of the present invention is a process for producing an aqueous uHrafine gold particle solution in which a gas mixture consisting of hydrogen and oxygen is combusted in highly pressurized water in which gold leaf fragments are suspended and then the gold leaf fragments are heated by die resulting combustion gas. Figure 1 shows a summary of this process.<br>
Further, the present invention further developed an apparatus to implement a method for producing an aqueous solution in which ultrafine gold particles are dissolved. Figure 2 shows the apparatus for the production.<br>
In a basic production process of the present invention, water is poured into a pressure tank and gold leaf fragments are admixed and suspended while stirring, after which the water is pressurized under high pressure, a gas mixture consisting of hydrogen and oxygen is injected from a nozzle and then completely combusted until it reaches the state of ultrahigh temperature vapor gas combustion, so that the gold leaf fragments are instantaneously dissolved and dispersed in water in the combustion gas. At this moment, uHrafine gold particles having a size as extremely small as microns are generated and are in the state of apparently being dissolved rather than being suspended Combustion in water can be most effective and stable with a gas mixture consisting of hydrogen and oxygen.  This<br><br>
stable combustion requires high pressure.<br>
Further, no physical or chemical explanation has been given why the gold leaf fragments are instantaneously dissolved in the combusting gas in highly pressurized water to become ultrafine particles.<br>
The water thus produced can be used as it is without filtration, or depending on the use, it can be filtered with a filter or the like to remove remaining gold leaf fragment and a small mount of fine gold particles larger than ultrafine gold particles, thereby obtaining an aqueous solution in which only ultrafine particles are dissolved. Gold leaf fragments and fine gold particles remaining on the filter as precipitate are recovered for reuse by appropriate backwash, which improve economical efficiency.<br>
Supply of hydrogen and oxygen gases in the method of me production according to the present invention has to be precisely controlled to maintain the hydrogen-oxygen rate to be 2 to 1. It is also necessary to control the reaction time and the amount of fuel to be combusted. The resulting water may have no desired effect if the reaction time is too short, while the taste as aqueous water may be spoiled if the reaction time is too long.<br>
An apparatus for producing a gold health water product of file present invention in Figure 2 constitutes an apparatus 1 for producing an aqueous solution in which ultrafine gold particles are dissolved comprising a high-pressure tank 2, a jet nozzle 5 for a gas mixture consisting of oxygen and hydrogen, and a combustion chamber 7. In addition, a water electrolysis system 16 to provide materials for a gas mixture, i.e., hydrogen and oxygen, and a filtering system 14 to filter the resulting aqueous solution are installed<br>
A production vessel of the present invention is a pressure-resistant tank (high-pressure tank) 2 made of metal, preferably stainless steel, into which water to make pressurized water 3 is supplied through an opening 8 and at the same time gold leaf fragments 4 are admixed, and the admixture is stirred by a stirring device 11 operated by an electric motor.<br>
A combustion chamber 7 is made so as to surround a jet nozzle 5 for a gas mixture 6 consisting of hydrogen and oxygen supplied through a hydrogen supply route 9 and an oxygen supply route 10. Here, the gas mixture is ignited by an ignition device 12 and then completely combusted until it reaches the state of ultrahigh temperature vapor gas combustion, so that the gold leaf fragments are instantaneously dissolved with the resulting combusting gas to produce an aqueous solution in which ultrafine gold particles are dissolved in water.<br><br>
The aqueous solution thus obtained can be used as it is or run through a filter housing (filtering device) 14 using apump 13 and is released as a product 15. As a filter, in order to filter only ultrafine particles, a hollow fiber filter having a pore size of micron order rather than an ion exchange membrane or a reverse osmotic membrane is preferably used.<br>
As for the scale of production of the present invention, one ton of aqueous solution can be produced by injecting a gas mixture at a rate of about 5 liters per second for about 2 hours, in which 40-60 g of gold powders are previously dispersed in one ton of water. Further, too much pressure may cause destruction of the apparatus, while too little pressure may blow up the gas from Ihe nozzle and the heated gold leaf fragments are wrapped in the resulting foflms and released on the surface of water, which results in poor generation of ullrafine gold particles. In this case, preferable pressure is about 3.5 atom. The pressure of highly pressurized water in the pressure tank is set to about 2 atom.<br>
Further, in the apparatus of the present invention, it is also possible to use material gas supply cylinders in place of a water electrolysis system 16 to provide hydrogen and oxygen to be used as fuel. However, hydrogen and oxygen provided by water electrolysis are pure materials and thus the material hydrogen and oxygen can be readily supplied.<br>
The water electrolysis system 16 can be an ordinary system composed of electrolysis vessel 17 containing water 18 and electrode plates 19, 20 connected to a power source 20.<br>
Acidic or alkaline material water is electrolyzed to generate oxygen gas at the anode and hydrogen gas at the cathode, which are used as material gases for combustion.<br>
Further in the present invention, a filter housing 14 is preferably added when remaining gold leaf fragments and gold particles in the resulting aqueous solution have to be removed. Water produced by this apparatus can be filtered with a filter or the like depending on the use to remove remaining gold leaf fragments and a trace of fine gold particles larger than ultrafine gold particles, thereby obtaining an aqueous solution in which only ultrafine particles are dissolved. Gold leaf fragments and fine gold particles remaining on the filter as precipitate are recovered by backwash for reuse, which contributes to cost-effectiveness.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention comprises an aqueous health drink consisting of an aqueous solution in which ultrafine gold particles are dissolved in water, which is produced by using the abovementioned method and apparatus. As mentioned above, purification is carried out through the filter housing 14 equipped with a hollow fiber membrane having a pore size of micron order and thus remaining gold leaf fragments and<br><br>
fine gold particles are appropriately filtered out to make an aqueous health drink. By such filtration, an aqueous drink that meets with the Food Hygienic Standard can be obtained. Filtration can be carried out, for example, using a series of hollow fiber membranes in order, each having apore size of 50 microns, 25 microns, 3 microns, 0.5 micron, and 0.1 micron, in which the first membrane is placed where the resulting fluid is released from the reaction tank.<br>
Aqueous health drinks obtained according to the present invention were analyzed by a third-party institution (Japan Food Research Laboratories, Foundation). Results are shown in Figures 3 and 4.<br>
Figure 3 shows the gold content in a sample in which distilled water was used as pressurized water into which gold leaf fragments were admixed and Ihe gold leaf fragments were dissolved using hydrogen and oxygen generated by water electrolysis as fuel. Figure 3 shows the gold content in a sample in which tap water was used as pressurized water into which gold leaf fragments were admixed and the gold leaf fragments were dissolved using hydrogen and oxygen generated by water electrolysis as fuel.<br>
An aqueous health drink obtained in the present invention is believed to become an epoch-making drink to sufficiently meet the demands in current health-oriented society. Although it is not clear at the moment why an aqueous solution in which ultrafine gold particles are dissolved has effectiveness to health and what kind of physiological activity is involved, marked effects in improving physical conditions and recovering from fatigue were observed when samples were tested by monitors as described below, and thus actual effectiveness was confirmed. Stability in the body and physiological effects such as intestinal absorbability were fully exhibited probably owing to ion emission effect and extremely large active surface area of ultrafine gold particles, or characteristics of gold itself as a precious metal, and further chemical and physical stability of gold.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention are further illustrated by the following examples with the accompanying drawings that are not intended as a limitation of the invention.<br>

A combustion chamber 7 is made so as to surround a jet nozzle 5 for a gas mixture 6 consisting of hydrogen and oxygen supplied through a hydrogen supply route 9 and an oxygen supply route 10. The gas mixture is ignited by an ignition device 12 and completely combusted until it reaches ultrahigh temperature vapor gas combustion state, so that the gold leaf fragments is instantaneously dissolved with the resulting combustion gas to produce an aqueous solution in which ultrafine gold particles are dissolved in water.
