				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>&quot;NMB1870&quot; is a known surface protein in Neisseria meningitidis expressed across all serogroups. It has three distinct families. Serum raised against a given family is bactericidal within the same family, but is not active against strains which express one of the other two families i.e. intra-family but not inter-family cross-protection. The inventors have found that NMB1870 can be divided into domains, and that not all domains are required for antigenicity. Antigenic domains can be taken from each of the three NMB1870 families and expressed as a single polypeptide chain. The inventors have also found that NMB1870 exposes some of its epitopes in surface loops situated between alpha helices, and that substitution of loop epitopes from one family into the loop position in another family allows chimeric NMB 1870 to be produced with multi-family antigenicity. Thus chimeric NMB1870 proteins are provided that comprise portions of NMB1870 from different families.</td>

DOMAINS AND EPITOPES OF MENINGOCOCCAL PROTEIN NMB1870<br>
All documents cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention is in the field of immunisation and, in particular, immunisation against diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria in the genus Neisseria, such as N.meningitidis (meningococcus).<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative encapsulated bacterium which colonises the upper respiratory tract of approximately 10% of human population. Although polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines are available against serogroups A, C, W135 and Y, this approach cannot be applied to serogroup B because the capsular polysaccharide is a polymer of polysialic acid, which is a self antigen in humans. To develop a vaccine against serogroup B, surface-exposed proteins contained in outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have been used. These vaccines elicit serum bactericidal antibody responses and protect against disease, but they fail to induce cross-strain protection [1]. Some workers are therefore focusing on specific meningococcal antigens for use in vaccines.<br>
One such antigen is 'NMB1870'. This protein was originally disclosed as protein '741' from strain MC58 [SEQ IDs 2535 &amp; 2536 in ref. 2; SEQ ID 1 herein], and has also been referred to as 'GNA1870' [ref. 3, following ref. 4] and as 'ORF2086' [5,6]. This protein is expressed across all meningococcal serogroups and has been found in multiple meningococcal strains. NMB1870 sequences group into three families, and it has been found that serum raised against a given family is bactericidal within the same family, but is not active against strains which express one of the other two families i.e. there is intra-family cross-protection, but not inter-family cross-protection.<br>
To achieve cross-strain protection using NMB1870, therefore, more than one family is used. To avoid the need to express and purify separate proteins, it has been proposed to express different families as hybrid proteins [7], including two or three of the families in a single polypeptide chain. Several hybrids have been tested and give encouraging anti-meningococcal efficacy.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide further and improved approaches for overcoming the family specificity of protection afforded by NMB1870, and to use these approaches for providing immunity against meningococcal disease and/or infection, particularly for serogroup B.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors have found that NMB1870 can be divided into domains, and that not all domains are required for antigenicity. Antigenic domains can be taken from each of the three NMB1870 families and expressed as a single polypeptide chain. This approach is simpler than expressing complete NMB1870 sequences end-to-end in a single polypeptide chain.<br>
The inventors have also found that NMB1870 exposes some of its epitopes in surface loops situated between alpha helices. Substitution of loop epitopes from one family into the loop position in another family allows chimeric NMB1870 to be produced with multi-family antigenicity.<br>

WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
Thus the invention provides chimeric NMB1870 proteins that comprise portions of NMB1870 from different families. Whereas each NMB1870 family can elicit antibodies (e.g. in mice) that are effective only against strains in the same NMB1870 family, chimeric polypeptides of the invention can elicit antibodies that recognise NMB1870 proteins from more than one family.<br>
Bactericidal antibody responses are conveniently measured in mice and are a standard indicator of vaccine efficacy [e.g. see end-note 14 of reference 4]. Chimeric proteins can preferably elicit an antibody response which is bactericidal against at least one N.meningitidis strain from each of at least two of the following three groups of strains:<br>
(I)	MC58, gbl85 (=M01-240185), m4030, m2197, m2937, issl00l, NZ394/98, 67/00,<br>
93/114, bzl98, ml390, nge28, lnpl7592, 00-241341, f6124, 205900, ml98/172,<br>
bzl33, gbl49 (=M01-240149), nm008, nm092, 30/00, 39/99, 72/00, 95330, bzl69,<br>
bz83, cu385, h44/76, ml590, m2934, m2969, m3370, m4215, m4318, n44/89,14847.<br>
(II)	961-5945, 2996, 96217, 312294, 11327, a22, gb013 (=M01-240013), e32, ml090,<br>
rn4287, 860800, 599, 95N477, 90-18311, ell, m986, m2671, 1000, ml096, m3279,<br>
bz232, dk353, m3697, ngh38, L93/4286.<br>
(HI) M1239,16889, gb355 (=M01-240355),m3369,m3813,ngpl65.<br>
For example, a chimeric polypeptide can elicit a bactericidal response effective against two or more of serogroup B N.meningitidis strains MC58, 961-5945 and M1239.<br>
The chimeric polypeptide can preferably elicit an antibody response which is bactericidal against at least 50% of clinically-relevant meningococcal serogroup B strains (e.g. 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more). The chimeric polypeptide may elicit an antibody response which is bactericidal against strains of serogroup B N.meningitidis and strains of at least one (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4) of serogroups A, C, W135 and Y. The chimeric polypeptide may elicit an antibody response which is bactericidal against strains of N.gonococcus and/or N.cinerea. The chimeric polypeptide may elicit an antibody response which is bactericidal against strains from at least two of the three main branches of the dendrogram shown in Figure 5 of reference 3.<br>
The chimeric polypeptide may elicit an antibody response which is bactericidal against N.meningitidis strains in at least 2 (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) of hypervirulent lineages ET-37, ET-5, cluster A4, lineage 3, subgroup I, subgroup III, and subgroup IV-1 [8,9]. Chimeras may additionally induce bactericidal antibody responses against one or more hyperinvasive lineages.<br>
Chimeras may elicit an antibody response which is bactericidal against N.meningitidis strains in at least at least 2 (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) of the following multilocus sequence types: ST1, ST4, ST5, ST8, ST11, ST32 and ST41 [10]. The chimera may also elicit an antibody response which is bactericidal against ST44 strains.<br>
The composition need not induce bactericidal antibodies against each and every MenB strain within the specified lineages or MLST; rather, for any given group of four of more strains of serogroup B meningococcus within a particular hypervirulent lineage or MLST, the antibodies induced by the composition are bacteiicidal against at least 50% (e.g. 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more) of the group.<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
Preferred groups of strains will include strains isolated in at least four of the following countries: GB, AU, CA, NO, IT, US, NZ, NL, BR, and CU. The serum preferably has a bactericidal titre of at least 1024 (e.g. 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218 or higher, preferably at least 214) i.e. the serum is able to kill at least 50% of test bacteria of a particular strain when diluted 1:1024 e.g. as described in end-note 14 of reference 4. Preferred chimeric polypeptides can elicit an antibody response in mice that remains bactericidal even when the serum is diluted 1:4096 or further.<br>
NMB1870 domains<br>
SEQ ID NO: 1 is the full-length family I NMB1870 sequence from serogroup B strain MC58:<br><br>
The N-terminus of the mature processed lipoprotein is underlined (Cys-20). The full-length sequence has been split into three domains (aa. 1-119, 120-183 and 184-274):<br><br>
From N-terminus to C-terminus these three domains are called 'A', 'B' and 'C. The mature form of domain 'A', from the mature C-terminus cysteine, is called 'Amature'.<br>
For MC58, the domains are: 'A' = SEQ ID NO: 4; 'B' = SEQ ID NO: 5; 'C = SEQ ID NO: 6; and 'Amature' = SEQ ID NO: 13. Multiple NMB1870 sequences are known [e.g. see refs. 3, 6 and 7] and can readily be aligned using standard methods. By such alignments the skilled person can identify domains 'A' (and 'Amature'), 'B' and 'C in any given NMB1870 sequence by comparison to the coordinates in the MC58 sequence. For ease of reference, however, the domains are defined below:<br>
-	Domain 'A' in a given NMB1870 sequence is the fragment of that sequence which, when aligned<br>
to SEQ ID NO: 1 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, starts with the amino acid aligned to<br>
Met-1 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and ends with the amino acid aligned to Lys-119 of SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
-	Domain 'Amature' in a given NMB1870 sequence is the fragment of that sequence which, when<br>
aligned to SEQ ID NO: 1 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, starts with the amino acid aligned<br>
to Cys-20 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and ends with the amino acid aligned to Lys-119 of SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
-	Domain 'B' in a given NMB1870 sequence is the fragment of that sequence which, when aligned<br>
to SEQ ID NO: 1 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, starts with the amino acid aligned to<br>
Gln-120 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and ends with the amino acid aligned to Gly-183 of SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
- Domain 'C in a given NMB1870 sequence is the fragment of that sequence which, when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 1 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, starts with the amino acid aligned to Lys-184 of SEQ ID NO: 1 and ends with the amino acid aligned to Gln-274 of SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
The preferred pairwise alignment algorithm for defining the domains is the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm [11], using default parameters (e.g. with Gap opening penalty = 10.0, and with Gap extension penalty = 0.5, using the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix). This algorithm is conveniently implemented in the needle tool in the EMBOSS package [12].<br>
NMB1870 sequences fall into three families [3,7] that are referred to herein as families I, II and III. The prototypic sequences for families I-III are, respectively, SEQ ID NOS: 1-3. The phylogenetic and dendrogram methods of reference 3 can be followed in order to readily determine the family for any given NMB1870 sequence, and a pairwise alignment with each of the three prototypic NMB1870 sequences can also be used to find the closest family match. Sequences fall distinctly into the three families, with sequence identity being 74.1% between families I &amp; II, 62.8% between families I &amp; III and 84.7% between families II &amp; III, and with sequence variation within each family being low (e.g. a minimum of 91.6% identity in family I, 93.4% in family II and 93.2% in family III). As a quick way of determining a sequence's family without requiring a phylogenetic analysis, a sequence can be placed in family I if it has at least 85% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 1, can be placed in family II if it has at least 85% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 2, and can be placed in family m if it has at least 85% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 3.<br>
Based on the alignment in Figure 6 of reference 3, exemplary domains A, B and C for the three prototypic families of NMB1870 (SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 3) are as follows:<br><br>
Preferred domains for use with the invention comprise amino acid sequences that (a) have at least x% sequence identity to one or more of SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 12, and/or (a) comprise a fragment of at least y consecutive amino acids sequence from one or more of SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 12.<br>
The value of x is selected from 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.5, 99.9 or more. The value of y is selected from 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or more, hi polypeptides comprising NMB1870 sequences from different families, the values of x and y for each family can be the same or different.<br>
A domain 'A' sequence is preferably between a1 and a2 (inclusive) amino acids long, where: a1 is selected from 110,115,120,125 and 130; and a2 is selected from 115,120,125,130 and 135.<br>
A domain 'B' sequence is preferably between b1 and b2 (inclusive) amino acids long, where: b1 is selected from 55, 60, 65 and 70; and b2 is selected from 60, 65, 70 and 75.<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
A domain 'C sequence is preferably between c1 and C2 (inclusive) amino acids long, where: c1 is selected from 80, 85, 90, 95 and 100; and c2 is selected from 85, 90, 95,100 and 105.<br>
NMB1870 surface loops<br>
The surface loops of SEQ ID NO: 1, lying between alpha helices, are: (1) amino acids 134-141; (2) amino acids 162-168; (3) amino acids 181-182; (4) amino acid 197; (5) amino acids 219-223; (6) amino acids 234-236; (7) amino acids 261-267:<br><br>
By aligning SEQ ID NO: 1 with any other NMB1870 sequence, the skilled person can identify the positions of loops (1) to (7) in that sequence. For ease of reference, however, the coordinates of a loop are defined herein as the string of amino acid(s) in a NMB1870 sequence that, when aligned to SEQ ID NO: 1 using a pairwise alignment algorithm, starts with the amino acid aligned to the first amino acid residue of the loop defined above in SEQ ID NO: 1 above and ends with the last amino acid of the loop defined above in SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>

Joining heterologous domains B and C<br>
The invention provides a chimeric polypeptide comprising: (a) a domain 'B' sequence from a first NMB1870 family; and (b) a domain 'C sequence from a second NMB1870 family.

It is preferred to have the -Bj- and -Cj- domains to the N-terminus of the -Bk- and -Ck- domains.<br>

The above polypeptides thus comprise BC domains from at least two of the three NMB1870 families. More preferably, the polypeptides comprise a BC domain from each of the three families. Thus the invention provides a chimeric polypeptide comprising: (a) a domain 'B' sequence and a domain 'C<br>

Optional Xn sequences<br>
Polypeptides of the invention may include sequences linking NMB1870Iderived sequences and/or may include N- and C-terminal sequences that are not derived from NMB1870. Such sequences are designated "Xn" herein (Xn, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, etc.). Each Xn may be present or absent, and the sequence of each may be the same or different.<br>
Linker amino acid sequence(s) will typically be short {e.g. 20 or fewer amino acids i.e. 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). Examples include short peptide sequences which facilitate cloning, poly-glycine linkers {i.e. Glyn where n - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more), and histidine tags {i.e. His,, where n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more). Other suitable linker amino acid sequences will be apparent to those skilled in the art. A useful linker is GSGGGG (SEQ ID NO: 17), with the Gly-Ser dipeptide being formed from a BamHI restriction site, thus aiding cloning and manipulation, and another useful linker is GKGGGG (SEQ ID NO: 45), with the Gly-Lys dipeptide being formed from a HindIII restriction site.

If a sequence lacks its own N-terminus rnethionine then a useful N-terminal sequence will provide such a methionine residue in the translated polypeptide {e.g. a single Met residue).<br>
Optional C-terminal amino acid sequences will typically be short {e.g. 40 or fewer amino acids i.e. 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18,17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).

Constructing chimeric NMB1870 sequences<br>
The invention provides a process for producing a chimeric NMB1870 amino acid sequence, comprising the steps of: (a) aligning a first NMB1870 amino acid sequence with a second NMB1870 amino acid sequence, to give a pair of aligned sequences; (b) selecting a portion of the first amino acid sequence, starting at amino acid a1 of said first amino acid sequence and ending at amino acid b1 of said first amino acid sequence; (c) selecting a portion of the second amino acid sequence, starting at amino acid a2 of said second amino acid sequence and ending at amino acid b2 of said second amino acid sequence, wherein residues a1 &amp; a2 and b1 &amp; b2 are aligned in the pair of aligned sequences; and (d) replacing said portion of the first amino acid sequence with said portion of the<br>

Steps (b) to (d) may be performed more than once for the same alignment from step (a) i.e. multiple substitutions from the second sequence into the first sequence can be performed. Similarly, steps (a) to (d) may be performed more than once, with a different "second amino acid sequence" optionally being used during subsequent steps (a) i.e. a first sequence can be aligned with a second sequence and subjected to the substitution procedure, and then may be aligned with a different second sequence and subjected to a further substitution, etc.<br>
Thus the invention provides a process for producing a chimeric NMB 1870 amino acid sequence, comprising the steps of: (a) aligning a first NMB1870 amino acid sequence with a second NMB1870 amino acid sequence, to give a first pair of aligned sequences; (b) selecting a portion of the first amino acid sequence, starting at amino acid a1 of said first amino acid sequence and ending at amino acid b1 of said first amino acid sequence; (c) selecting a portion of the second amino acid sequence, starting at amino acid a2 of said second amino acid sequence and ending at amino acid b2 of said second amino acid sequence, wherein residues a1 &amp; a2 and b1 &amp; b2 are aligned in the first pair of aligned sequences; (d) replacing said portion of the first amino acid sequence with said portion of the second amino acid sequence, thereby providing an intermediate chimeric NMB 1870 amino acid sequence; (e) aligning the first NMB 1870 amino acid sequence, or the intermediate chimeric sequence, with a third NMB 1870 amino acid sequence, to give a second pair of aligned sequences;<br>

acid sequence and ending at amino acid b4 of said third amino acid sequence, wherein residues a3 &amp;.<br>
a4 and b3 &amp; b4 are aligned in the second pair of aligned sequences; and (h) replacing said portion of<br>
the intermediate chimeric sequence, with said portion of the third amino acid sequence, thereby<br>
providing the chimeric NMB 1870 amino acid sequence.<br>
The selected portions are preferably at least c amino acids long, where c is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more.<br>

The invention also provides a fragment of at least g consecutive amino acids of said polypeptide, provided that said fragment includes at least one amino acid from each of F1 and F2 (i.e. the fragment bridged the join between F1 and F2.

Loop substitution<br>
The inventors have found that NMB1870 exposes some of its epitopes in surface loops situated between alpha helices. Substitution of loop epitopes from one family into the loop position in another family allows chimeric NMB1870 to be produced with multi-family antigenicity.<br>
Thus the invention provides a polypeptide comprising a modified amino acid sequence of a first family of NMB1870, wherein the modified sequence includes at least one (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7) surface loop sequence from a second family of NMB1870 in place of a surface loop sequence from the first family.<br>

If the polypeptide includes an amino acid sequence downstream of -Z2- then said sequence is preferably different from the sequence that is found immediately downstream of the y2 amino acids located immediately downstream of amino acid Arg-223 in SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
These fragment-including polypeptides of the invention preferably do not include any known polypeptides e.g. disclosed in references 2, 3, 6, 7, etc.<br>
The invention also provides a mixture comprising a first polypeptide and a second polypeptide, where the first polypeptide is a fragment from domain B of a NMB1870 and the second polypeptide is a fragment from domain C of a NMB1870, wherein the first and second polypeptides can associate to produce an epitope that is not found on either the first or second polypeptide alone. For any given NMB 1870 it is straightforward to identify domains B and C using the information supplied herein, and truncation and/or dissection of the separate domains, followed by mixing, can be used to see if the polypeptides associate. A convenient assay for determining association and formation of the conformational epitope involves the use of a monoclonal antibody that is recognises a domain BC fragment of NMB 1870 but does not recognise domain B or C alone. Such antibodies can be isolated from polyclonal mouse anti-NMB1870 antiserum by standard screening methods.<br>

Immunisation<br>
Polypeptides of the invention are preferably provided as immunogenic compositions, and the invention provides an immunogenic composition of the invention for use as a medicament.<br>
The invention also provides a method for raising an antibody response in a mammal, comprising administering an immunogenic composition of the invention to the mammal. The antibody response is preferably a protective and/or bactericidal antibody response.<br>
The invention also provides a method for protecting a mammal against a Neisserial (e.g. meningococcal) infection, comprising administering to the mammal an immunogenic composition of the invention.<br>
The invention provides chirneric polypeptides of the invention for use as medicaments {e.g. as immunogenic compositions or as vaccines) or as diagnostic reagents. It also provides the use of nucleic acid, polypeptide, or antibody of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for preventing Neisserial (e.g. meningococcal) infection in a mammal.<br>
The mammal is preferably a human. The human may be an adult or, preferably, a child. Where the vaccine is for prophylactic use, the human is preferably a child (e.g. a toddler or infant); where the vaccine is for therapeutic use, the human is preferably an adult. A vaccine intended for children may also be administered to adults e.g. to assess safety, dosage, immunogenicity, etc.<br>
The uses and methods are particularly useful for preventing/treating diseases including, but not limited to, meningitis (particularly bacterial meningitis) and bacteremia.<br>
Efficacy of therapeutic treatment can be tested by monitoring Neisserial infection after administration of the composition of the invention. Efficacy of prophylactic treatment can be tested by monitoring immune responses against NMB1870 after administration of the composition. Immunogenicity of compositions of the invention can be determined by administering them to test subjects (e.g. children 12-16 months age, or animal models [13]) and then determining standard parameters including serum bactericidal antibodies (SBA) and ELISA titres (GMT). These immune responses will generally be determined around 4 weeks after administration of the composition, and compared to values determined before administration of the composition. A SBA increase of at least 4-fold or 8-fold is preferred. Where more than one dose of the composition is administered, more than one post-administration determination may be made.<br>
Preferred compositions of the invention can confer an antibody titre in a patient that is superior to the criterion for seroprotection for each antigenic component for an acceptable percentage of human subjects. Antigens with an associated antibody titre above which a host is considered to be seroconverted against the antigen are well known, and such titres are published by organisations such as WHO. Preferably more than 80% of a statistically significant sample of subjects is seroconverted, more preferably more than 90%, still more preferably more than 93% and most preferably 96-100%.<br>
Compositions of the invention will generally be administered directly to a patient. Direct delivery may be accomplished by parenteral injection (e.g. subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously,<br>
-18-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
intramuscularly, or to the interstitial space of a tissue), or by rectal, oral, vaginal, topical, transdermal, intranasal, ocular, aural, pulmonary or other mucosal administration. Intramuscular administration to the thigh or the upper arm is preferred. Injection may be via a needle (e.g. a hypodermic needle), but needle-free injection may alternatively be used. A typical intramuscular dose is 0.5 ml.<br>
The invention may be used to elicit systemic and/or mucosal immunity.<br>
Dosage treatment can be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. Multiple doses may be used in a primary immunisation schedule and/or in a booster immunisation schedule. A primary dose schedule may be followed by a booster dose schedule. Suitable timing between priming doses (e.g., between 4-16 weeks), and between priming and boosting, can be routinely determined.<br>
The immunogenic composition of the invention will generally include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which can be any substance that does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the patient receiving the composition, and which can be administered without undue toxicity. Suitable carriers can be large, slowly-metabolised macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, and inactive virus particles. Such carriers are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can include liquids such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol. Auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, and the like, can also be present in such vehicles. Liposomes are suitable carriers. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutical carriers is available in ref. 14.<br>
Neisserial infections affect various areas of the body and so the compositions of the invention may be prepared in various forms. For example, the compositions may be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection can also be prepared. The composition may be prepared for topical administration e.g. as an ointment, cream or powder. The composition be prepared for oral administration e.g. as a tablet or capsule, or as a syrup (optionally flavoured). The composition may be prepared for pulmonary administration e.g. as an inhaler, using a fine powder or a spray. The composition may be prepared as a suppository or pessary. The composition may be prepared for nasal, aural or ocular administration e.g. as drops.<br>
The composition is preferably sterile. It is preferably pyrogen-free. It is preferably buffered e.g. at between pH 6 and pH 8, generally around pH 7. Where a composition comprises an aluminium hydroxide salt, it is preferred to use a histidine buffer [15]. Compositions of the invention may be isotonic with respect to humans.<br>
Immunogenic compositions comprise an immunologically effective amount of immunogen, as well as any other of other specified components, as needed. By 'immunologically effective amount', it is meant that the administration of that amount to an individual, either in a single dose or as part of a series, is effective for treatment or prevention. This amount varies depending upon the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, age, the taxonomic group of individual to be treated<br>

{e.g. non-human primate, primate, etc.), the capacity of the individual's immune system to synthesise antibodies, the degree of protection desired, the formulation of the vaccine, the treating doctor's assessment of the medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the amount will fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials. Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule {e.g. including booster doses). The composition may be administered in conjunction with other immunoregulatory agents.<br>

The composition may comprise one or more of these further antigens.<br>
Toxic protein antigens may be detoxified where necessary (e.g. detoxification of pertussis toxin by chemical and/or genetic means [97]).<br>
Where a diphtheria antigen is included in the composition it is preferred also to include tetanus antigen and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a tetanus antigen is included it is preferred also to include diphtheria and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a pertussis antigen is included it is preferred also to include diphtheria and tetanus antigens. DTP combinations are thus preferred.<br>
Saccharide antigens are preferably in the form of conjugates. Carrier proteins for the conjugates include the N.memngitidis outer membrane protein [106], synthetic peptides [107,108], heat shock proteins [109,110], pertussis proteins [111,112], protein D from H.influenzae [113], cytokines [114], lymphokines [114], streptococcal proteins, hormones [114], growth factors [114], toxin A or B from C.difjicile [115], iron-uptake proteins [116], etc. A preferred carrier protein is the CRM197 diphtheria toxoid [117].<br>
Antigens in the composition will typically be present at a concentration of at least lug/ml each. In general, the concentration of any given antigen will be sufficient to elicit an immune response against that antigen.<br>
Immunogenic compositions of the invention may be used therapeutically {i.e. to treat an existing infection) or prophylactically (i.e. to prevent future infection).<br>
As an alternative to using proteins antigens in the immunogenic compositions of the invention, nucleic acid (preferably DNA e.g. in the form of a plasmid) encoding the antigen may be used.<br>
Particularly preferred compositions of the invention include one, two or three of: (a) saccharide antigens from meningococcus serogroups Y, W135, C and (optionally) A; (b) a saccharide antigen from Haemophilus influenzae type B; and/or (c) an antigen from Streptococcuspneumoniae.<br>
Meningococcus serogroups Y, W135, C and (optionally) A<br>
Polysaccharide vaccines against serogroups A, C, W135 &amp; Y have been known for many years. These vaccines (MENCEVAX ACWY™ and MENOMUNE™) are based on the organisms' capsular polysaccharides and, although they are effective in adolescents and adults, they give a poor immune response and short duration of protection, and they cannot be used in infants.<br>
In contrast to the unconjugated polysaccharide antigens in these vaccines, the recently-approved serogroup C vaccines (Menjugate™ [118,85], Meningitec™ and NeisVac-C™) include conjugated<br>
-25-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
saccharides. Menjugate™ and Meningitec™ have oligosaccharide antigens conjugated to a CRM197 carrier, whereas NeisVac-C™ uses the complete polysaccharide (de-O-acetylated) conjugated to a tetanus toxoid carrier. The Menactra™ vaccine contains conjugated capsular saccharide antigens from each of serogroups Y, W135, C and A.<br>
Compositions of the present invention preferably include capsular saccharide antigens from one or more of meningococcus serogroups Y, W135, C and (optionally) A, wherein the antigens are conjugated to carrier protein(s) and/or are oligosaccharides. For example, the composition may include a capsular saccharide antigen from: serogroup C; serogroups A and C; serogroups A, C and W135; serogroups A, C and Y; serogroups C, W135 and Y; or from all four of serogroups A, C, W135andY.<br>
A typical quantity of each meningococcal saccharide antigen per dose is between 1 µg and 20µg e.g. about lµg, about 2.5µg, about 4µg, about 5µg, or about 10µg (expressed as saccharide).<br>
"Where a mixture comprises capsular saccharides from both serogroups A and C, the ratio (w/w) of MenA saccharide:MenC saccharide may be greater than 1 {e.g. 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 10:1 or higher). Where a mixture comprises capsular saccharides from serogroup Y and one or both of serogroups C and W135, the ratio (w/w) of MenY saccharide:MenW135 saccharide may be greater than 1 {e.g. 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 10:1 or higher) and/or that the ratio (w/w) of MenY saccharide:MenC saccharide may be less than 1 {e.g. 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, or lower). Preferred ratios (w/w) for saccharides from serogroups A:C:W135:Y are: 1:1:1:1; 1:1:1:2; 2:1:1:1; 4:2:1:1; 8:4:2:1; 4:2:1:2; 8:4:1:2; 4:2:2:1; 2:2:1:1; 4:4:2:1; 2:2:1:2; 4:4:1:2; and 2:2:2:1. Preferred ratios (w/w) for saccharides from serogroups C:W135:Y are: 1:1:1; 1:1:2; 1:1:1; 2:1:1; 4:2:1; 2:1:2; 4:1:2; 2:2:1; and 2:1:1. Using a substantially equal mass of each saccharide is preferred.<br>
Capsular saccharides will generally be used in the form of oligosaccharides. These are conveniently formed by fragmentation of purified capsular polysaccharide {e.g. by hydrolysis), which will usually be followed by purification of the fragments of the desired size.<br>
Fragmentation of polysaccharides is preferably performed to give a final average degree of polymerisation (DP) in the oligosaccharide of less than 30 {e.g. between 10 and 20, preferably around 10 for serogroup A; between 15 and 25 for serogroups W135 and Y, preferably around 15-20; between 12 and 22 for serogroup C; etc.). DP can conveniently be measured by ion exchange chromatography or by colorimetric assays [119].<br>
If hydrolysis is performed, the hydrolysate will generally be sized in order to remove short-length oligosaccharides [86]. This can be achieved in various ways, such as ultrafiltration followed by ion-exchange chromatography. Oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerisation of less than or equal to about 6 are preferably removed for serogroup A, and those less than around 4 are preferably removed for serogroups W135 and Y.<br>
Preferred MenC saccharide antigens are disclosed in reference 118, as used in Menjugate™.<br>
-26-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
The saccharide antigen may be chemically modified. This is particularly useful for reducing hydrolysis for serogroup A [120; see below]. De-O-acetylation of meningococcal saccharides can be performed. For oligosaccharides, modification may take place before or after depolymerisation.<br>
Where a composition of the invention includes a MenA saccharide antigen, the antigen is preferably a modified saccharide in which one or more of the hydroxyl groups on the native saccharide has/have been replaced by a blocking group [120]. This modification improves resistance to hydrolysis.<br>
The number of monosaccharide units having blocking groups can vary. For example, all or<br>
substantially all the monosaccharide units may have blocking groups. Alternatively, at least 10%,<br>
20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% of the monosaccharide units may have blocking<br>
groups. At least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,<br>
26,27,28,29 or 30 monosaccharide units may have blocking groups.	i<br>
Likewise, the number of blocking groups on a monosaccharide unit may vary. For example, the number of blocking groups on a monosaccharide unit may be 1 or 2. The blocking group will generally be at the 4 position and/or 3-position of the monosaccharide units.<br>
 The terminal monosaccharide unit may or may not have a blocking group instead of its native hydroxyl. It is preferred to retain a free anomeric hydroxyl group on a terminal monosaccharide unit in order to provide a handle for further reactions (e.g. conjugation). Anomeric hydroxyl groups can be converted to amino groups (-NH2 or -NH-E, where E is a nitrogen protecting group) by reductive amination (using, for example, NaBHaCN/NH4Cl), and can then be regenerated after other hydroxyl groups have been converted to blocking groups.<br>
Blocking groups to replace hydroxyl groups may be directly accessible via a derivatizing reaction of the hydroxyl group i.e. by replacing the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group with another group. Suitable derivatives of hydroxyl groups which act as blocking groups are, for example, carbamates, sulfonates, carbonates, esters, ethers (e.g. silyl ethers or alkyl ethers) and acetals. Some specific examples of such blocking groups are allyl, Aloc, benzyl, BOM, t-butyl, trityl, TBS, TBDPS, TES, TMS, TIPS, PMB, MEM, MOM, MTM, THP, etc. Other blocking groups that are not directly accessible and which completely replace the hydroxyl group include C1-12 alkyl, C3-12 alkyl, C5-12 aryl, C5-12 aryl-C1-6 alkyl, NR'R2 (R1 and R2 are defined in the following paragraph), H, F, Cl, Br, CO2H, CO2(C1-6 alkyl), CN, CF3, CCl3, etc. Preferred blocking groups are electron-withdrawing groups.<br>
Preferred blocking groups are of the formula: -O-X-Y or -OR3 wherein: X is C(O), S(O) or SO2; Y,; is C1-12 alkyl, C1-12 alkoxy, C3-12 cycloalkyl, C5-12 aryl or C5-12 aryl-C1-6 alkyl, each of which may optionally be substituted with 1,2 or 3 groups independently selected from F, Cl, Br, CO2H, CO2(C1-6 alkyl), CN, CF3 or CC13; or Y is NR'R2; R1 and R2 are independently selected from H, C1-12 alkyl, C3-12 cycloalkyl, C5-12 aryl, C5-12 aryl-C1-6 alkyl; or R1 and R2 may be joined to form a C3-12 saturated heterocyclic group; R3 is C1-12 alkyl or C3-12 cycloalkyl, each of which may optionally be substituted with 1, 2 or 3 groups independently selected from F, Cl, Br, CO2(C1-6 alkyl), CN, CF3 or CC13; or R3 is C5-12 aryl or C5-12 aryl-C1-6 alkyl, each of which may optionally be substituted with 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5<br>
-27-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
groups selected from F, Cl, Br, CO2H, CO2(C1-6 alkyl), CN, CF3 or CC13. When R3 is C1-12 alkyl or C3-12 cycloalkyl, it is typically substituted with 1, 2 or 3 groups as defined above. When R1 and R2 are joined to form a C3.12 saturated heterocyclic group, it is meant that R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom form a saturated heterocyclic group containing any number of carbon atoms between 3 and 12 (e.g. C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12). The heterocyclic group may contain 1 or 2 heteroatoms (such as N, O or S) other than the nitrogen atom. Examples of C3-12 saturated heterocyclic groups are pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl, imidazolidinyl, azetidinyl and azhidinyl.<br>
Blocking groups -O-X-Y and -OR3 can be prepared from -OH groups by standard derivatizing procedures, such as reaction of the hydroxyl group with'an acyl halide, alkyl halide, sulfonyl halide, etc. Hence, the oxygen atom in -O-X-Y is preferably the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group, while the -X-Y group in -O-X-Y preferably replaces the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group.<br>
Alternatively, the blocking groups may be accessible via a substitution reaction, such as a Mitsonobu-type substitution. These and other methods of preparing blocking groups from hydroxyl groups are well known.<br>
More preferably, the blocking group is -OC(O)CF3 [121], or a carbamate group -OC(O)NR1R2, where R1 and R2 are independently selected from C1-6 alkyl. More preferably, R1 and R2 are both methyl i.e. the blocking group is -OC(O)NMe2. Carbamate blocking groups have a stabilizing effect on the glycosidic bond and may be prepared under mild conditions.<br>
Preferred modified MenA saccharides contain n monosaccharide units, where at least h% of the monosaccharide units do not have -OH groups at both of positions 3 and 4. The value of h is 24 or more (e.g. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, 99 or 100) and is preferably 50 or more. The absent —OH groups are preferably blocking groups as defined above.<br>
Other preferred modified MenA saccharides comprise monosaccharide units, wherein at least s of the monosaccharide units do not have-OH at the 3 position and do not have -OH at the 4 position. The value of s is at least 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90). The absent -OH groups are preferably blocking groups as defined above.<br>
Suitable modified MenA saccharides for use with the invention have the formula:<br>
  , wherein -28-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
n is an integer from 1 to 100 (preferably an integer from 15 to 25); T is of the formula (A) or (B):<br><br>
each Z group is independently selected from OH or a blocking group as defined above; and each Q group is independently selected from OH or a blocking group as defined above; Y is selected from OH or a blocking group as defined above; E is H or a nitrogen protecting group; and wherein more than about 7% (e.g. 8%, 9%, 10% or more) of the Q groups are blocking groups.<br>
Each of the n+2 Z groups may be the same or different from each other. Likewise, each of the n+2 Q groups may be the same or different from each other. All the Z groups may be OH. Alternatively, at least 10%, 20, 30%, 40%, 50% or 60% of the Z groups may be OAc. Preferably, about 70% of the Z groups are OAc, with the remainder of the Z groups being OH or blocking groups as defined above. At least about 7% of Q groups are blocking groups. Preferably, at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or even 100% of the Q groups are blocking groups.<br>
Meningococcal capsular polysaccharides are typically prepared by a process comprising the steps of polysaccharide precipitation (e.g. using a cationic detergent), ethanol fractionation, cold phenol extraction (to remove protein) and ultracentrifugation (to remove LPS) [e.g. ref. 122]. A more preferred process [87], however, involves polysaccharide precipitation followed by solubilisation of the precipitated polysaccharide using a lower alcohol. Precipitation can be achieved using a cationic detergent such as tetrabutylammonium and cetyltrimethylammonium salts (e.g. the bromide salts), or hexadimethrine bromide and myristyltrimethylammonium salts. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ('CTAB') is particularly preferred [123]. Solubilisation of the precipitated material can be achieved using a lower alcohol such as methanol, propan-1-ol, propan-2-ol, butan-1-ol, butan-2-ol, 2-methyl-propan-1-ol, 2-methyl-propan-2-ol, diols, etc., but ethanol is particularly suitable for solubilising CTAB-polysaccharide complexes. Ethanol is preferably added to the precipitated polysaccharide to give a final concentration (based on total content of ethanol and water) of between 50% and 95%.<br>
After re-solubilisation, the polysaccharide may be further treated to remove contaminants. This is particularly important in situations where even minor contamination is not acceptable (e.g. for human vaccine production). This will typically involve one or more steps of filtration e.g. depth filtration, filtration through activated carbon may be used, size filtration and/or ultrafiltration. Once filtered to remove contaminants, the polysaccharide may be precipitated for further treatment and/or processing. This can be conveniently achieved by exchanging cations (e.g. by the addition of calcium or sodium salts).<br>

WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
As an alternative to purification, capsular saccharides may be obtained by total or partial synthesis<br>
e.g. Hib synthesis is disclosed in ref. 124, and MenA synthesis in ref. 125.<br>
Compositions of the invention comprise capsular saccharides from at least two serogroups of N.meningitidis. The saccharides are preferably prepared separately (including any fragmentation, conjugation, modification, etc.) and then admixed to give a composition of the invention.<br>
Where the composition comprises capsular saccharide from serogroup A, however, it is preferred that the serogroup A saccharide is not combined with the other saccharide(s) until shortly before use, in order to minimise the potential for hydrolysis. This can conveniently be achieved by having the serogroup A component (typically together with appropriate excipients) in lyophilised form and the other serogroup components) in liquid form (also with appropriate excipients), with the liquid components being used to reconstitute the lyophilised MenA component when ready for use. Where an aluminium salt adjuvant is used, it is preferred to include the adjuvant in the vial containing the with the liquid vaccine, and to lyophilise the MenA component without adjuvant.<br>
A composition of the invention may thus be prepared from a kit comprising: (a) capsular saccharide from N.meningitidis serogroup A, in lyophilised form; and (b) the further antigens from the composition, in liquid form. The invention also provides a method for preparing a composition of the invention, comprising mixing a lyophilised capsular saccharide from N.meningitidis serogroup A with the further antigens, wherein said further antigens are in liquid form.<br>
The invention also provides a kit comprising: (a) a first container containing capsular saccharides from two or more of N.meningitidis serogroups C, W135 and Y, all in lyophilised form; and (b) a second container containing in liquid form (i) a composition which, after administration to a subject, is able to induce an antibody response in that subject, wherein the antibody response is bactericidal against two or more (e.g. 2 or 3) of hypervirulent lineages A4, ET-5 and lineage 3 of N.meningitidis serogroup B, (ii) capsular saccharides from none or one of N.meningitidis serogroups C, W135 and Y, and optionally (iii) further antigens (see below) that do not include meningococcal capsular saccharides, wherein, reconstitution of the contents of container (a) by the contents of container (b) provides a composition of the invention.<br>
Within each dose, the amount of an individual saccharide antigen will generally be between 1-50 µg (measured as mass of saccharide), with about 2.5µg, 5µg or 10 µg of each being preferred. With A:C:W135:Y weight ratios of 1:1:1:1; 1:1:1:2; 2:1:1:1; 4:2:1:1; 8:4:2:1; 4:2:1:2; 8:4:1:2; 4:2:2:1; 2:2:1:1; 4:4:2:1; 2:2:1:2; 4:4:1:2; and 2:2:2:1, therefore, the amount represented by the number 1 is preferably about 2.5µg, 5µg or 10 µg. For a 1:1:1:1 ratio A:C:W:Y composition and a 10µg per saccharide, therefore, 40 µg saccharide is administered per dose. Preferred compositions have about the following ug saccharide per dose:<br>
-30-<br><br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
Preferred compositions of the invention comprise less than 50 µg meningococcal saccharide per dose. Other preferred compositions comprise 
For trivalent N.meningitidis serogroup combinations, the following permutations are available:<br><br>
The Menjugate™ and NeisVac™ MenC conjugates use a hydroxide adjuvant, whereas Meningitec™ uses a phosphate. It is possible in compositions of the invention to adsorb some antigens to an aluminium hydroxide but to have other antigens in association with an aluminium phosphate. For tetravalent serogroup combinations, for example, the following permutations are available:<br><br>
Haemophirus influenzae type B<br>
Where the composition includes a H.influenzae type B antigen, it will typically be a Hib capsular<br>
saccharide antigen. Saccharide antigens from H.influenzae b are well known.<br>
Advantageously, the Hib saccharide is covalently conjugated to a carrier protein, in order to enhance its immunogenicity, especially in children. The preparation of polysaccharide conjugates in general, and of the Hib capsular polysaccharide in particular, is well documented [e.g. references 126 to 134 etc.]. The invention may use any suitable Hib conjugate. Suitable carrier proteins are described below, and preferred carriers for Hib saccharides are CRM197 ('HbOC'), tetanus toxoid (PRP-T') and the outer membrane complex of N.meningitidis ('PRP-OMP').<br>
The saccharide moiety of the conjugate may be a polysaccharide {e.g. full-length polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP)), but it is preferred to hydrolyse polysaccharides to form oligosaccharides {e.g. MW from ~1 to ~5 kDa).<br>
-31-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
A preferred conjugate comprises a Hib oligosaccharide covalently linked to CRM197 via an adipic acid linker [135,136], Tetanus toxoid is also a preferred carrier.<br>
Compositions of the invention may comprise more than one Hib antigen.<br>
Where a composition includes a Hib saccharide antigen, it is preferred that it does not also include an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. If the composition includes an aluminium phosphate adjuvant then the Hib antigen may be adsorbed to the adjuvant [137] or it may be non-adsorbed [138].<br>
Hib antigens may be lyophilised e.g. together with meningococcal antigens.<br>
Streptococcus pneumoniae<br>
Where the composition includes a S.pneumoniae antigen, it will typically be a capsular saccharide antigen which is preferably conjugated to a carrier protein [e.g. refs. 88-90]. It is preferred to include saccharides from more than one serotype of S.pneumoniae. For example, mixtures of polysaccharides from 23 different serotype are widely used, as are conjugate vaccines with polysaccharides from between 5 and 11 different serotypes [139]. For example, PrevNar™ [140] contains antigens from seven serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) with each saccharide individually conjugated to CRM197 by reductive amination, with 2ug of each saccharide per 0.5ml dose (4ug of serotype 6B), and with conjugates adsorbed on an aluminium phosphate adjuvant. Compositions of the invention preferably include at least serotypes 6B, 14, 19F and 23F. Conjugates may be adsorbed onto an aluminium phosphate.<br>
As an alternative to using saccharide antigens from pneumococcus, the composition may include one or more polypeptide antigens. Genome sequences for several strains of pneumococcus are available [141,142] and can be subjected to reverse vaccinology [143-146] to identify suitable polypeptide antigens [147,148]. For example, the composition may include one or more of the following antigens: PhtA, PhtD, PhtB, PhtE, SpsA, LytB, LytC, LytA, Spl25, SplOl, Spl28 and Spl3O, as defined in reference 149.<br>
In some embodiments, the composition may include both saccharide and polypeptide antigens from pneumococcus. These may be used in simple admixture, or the pneumococcal saccharide antigen may be conjugated to a pneumococcal protein. Suitable carrier proteins for such embodiments include the antigens listed in the previous paragraph [149],<br>
Pneumococcal antigens may be Iyophilised e.g. together with meningococcal and/or Hib antigens.<br>
Covalent conjugation<br>
Capsular saccharides in compositions of the invention will usually be conjugated to carrier protein(s). In general, conjugation enhances the immunogenicity of saccharides as it converts them from T-independent antigens to T-dependent antigens, thus allowing priming for immunological memory. Conjugation is particularly useful for paediatric vaccines and is a well known technique [e.g. reviewed in refs. 150 and 126-134].<br>
-32-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
Preferred carrier proteins are bacterial toxins or toxoids, such as diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid. The CRM197 mutant diphtheria toxin [117,151452] is particularly preferred. Other suitable carrier proteins include the N.meningitidis outer membrane protein [106], synthetic peptides [107,108], heat shock proteins [109,110], pertussis proteins [111,112], cytokines [114], lymphokines [114], hormones [114], growth factors [114], artificial proteins comprising multiple human CD4+ T cell epitopes from various pathogen-derived antigens [153], protein D from H.inflnenzae [113,154], pneumococcal surface protein PspA [155], iron-uptake proteins [116], toxin A or B from C.difficile [115], etc. Preferred carriers are diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, H.influenzae protein D, and CRM197.<br>
Within a composition of the invention, it is possible to use more than one carrier protein e.g. to reduce the risk of carrier suppression. Thus different carrier proteins can be used for different serogroups e.g. serogroup A saccharides might be conjugated to CRM197 while serogroup C saccharides might be conjugated to tetanus toxoid. It is also possible to use more than one carrier protein for a particular saccharide antigen e.g. serogroup A saccharides might be in two groups, with some conjugated to CRM197 and others conjugated to tetanus toxoid. In general, however, it is preferred to use the same carrier protein for all saccharides.<br>
A single carrier protein might carry more than one saccharide antigen [156]. For example, a single carrier protein might have conjugated to it saccharides from serogroups A and C. To achieve this goal, saccharides can be mixed prior to the conjugation reaction, In general, however, it is preferred to have separate conjugates for each serogroup.<br>
Conjugates with a saccharide:protein ratio (w/w) of between 1:5 (i.e. excess protein) and 5:1 (i.e. excess saccharide) are preferred. Ratios between 1:2 and 5:1 are preferred, as are ratios between 1:1.25 and 1:2.5 are more preferred. Excess carrier protein is preferred for MenA and MenC.<br>
Conjugates may be used in conjunction with free carrier protein [157]. When a given carrier protein is present in both free and conjugated form in a composition of the invention, the unconjugated form is preferably no more than 5% of the total amount of the carrier protein in the composition as a whole, and more preferably present at less than 2% by weight.<br>
Any suitable conjugation reaction can be used, with any suitable linker where necessary.<br>
The saccharide will typically be activated or functionalised prior to conjugation. Activation may involve, for example, cyanylating reagents such as CDAP (e.g. l-cyano-4-dimethylamino pyridinium tetrafluoroborate [158,159,efc.]). Other suitable techniques use carbodiimides, hydrazides, active esters, norborane, p-nitrobenzoic acid, N-hydroxysuccinirnide, S-NHS, EDC, TSTU; see also the introduction to reference 132).<br>
Linkages via a linker group may be made using any known procedure, for example, the procedures described in references 160 and 161. One type of linkage involves reductive amination of the polysaccharide, coupling the resulting amino group with one end of an adipic acid linker group, and then coupling a protein to the other end of the adipic acid linker group [130,162,163]. Other linkers<br>
-33-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
include B-propionamido [164], m'trophenyl-ethylamine [165], haloacyl halides [166], glycosidic linkages [167], 6-aminocaproic acid [168], ADH [169], C4 to C12 moieties [170] etc. As an alternative to using a linker, direct linkage can be used. Direct linkages to the protein may comprise oxidation of the polysaccharide followed by reductive amination with the protein, as described in, for example, references 171 and 172.<br>
A process involving the introduction of amino groups into the saccharide {e.g. by replacing terminal =O groups with -NH2) followed by derivatisation with an adipic diester {e.g. adipic acid N-hydroxysuccinimido diester) and reaction with carrier protein is preferred. Another preferred reaction uses CDAP activation with a protein D carrier e.g. for MenA or MenC.<br>
After conjugation, free and conjugated saccharides can be separated. There are many suitable methods, including hydrophobic chromatography, tangential ultrafiltration, diafiltration etc. [see also refs. 173 &amp; 174, etc.].<br>
Where the composition of the invention includes a conjugated oligosaccharide, it is preferred that oligosaccharide preparation precedes conjugation.<br>
Outer membrane vesicles<br>
It is preferred that compositions of the invention should not include complex or undefined mixtures of antigens, which are typical characteristics of OMVs. However, one way in which the invention can be applied to OMVs is where OMVs are to be administered in a multiple dose schedule.<br>
Where more than one OMV dose is to be administered, each dose may be supplemented (either by adding the purified protein or by expression of the protein within the bacteria from which the OMVs are derived) by one of the first protein, second protein or third protein as defined above. Preferably different doses are supplemented with different NMB1870 families. In a three dose OMV schedule, for example, each dose could contain a different one of the first protein, second protein and third protein such that, after receiving three doses of OMVs, all three families have been received. In a two dose OMV schedule, one family could be used per OMV dose (thus omitting one family), or one or both OMV doses could be supplemented with more than one family in order to give coverage with all three families. In preferred embodiments, there are three OMV doses, and each of the three OMV doses contains three different genetically-engineered vesicle populations each displaying three subtypes, thereby giving nine different subtypes in all.<br>
This approach may be used in general to improve preparations of N.meningitidis serogroup B microvesicles [175], 'native OMVs' [176], blebs or outer membrane vesicles [e.g. refs. 177 to 182, etc.]. These may be prepared from bacteria which have been genetically manipulated [183-186] e.g. to increase immunogenicity {e.g. hyper-express immunogens), to reduce toxicity, to inhibit capsular polysaccharide synthesis, to down-regulate PorA expression, etc. They may be prepared from hyperblebbing strains [187-190]. Vesicles from a non-pathogenic Neisseria may be included [191]. OMVs may be prepared without the use of detergents [192,193]. They may express non-Neisserial proteins on their surface [194]. They may be LPS-depleted. They may be mixed with recombinant<br>
-34-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
antigens [177,195]. Vesicles from bacteria with different class I outer membrane protein subtypes may be used e.g. six different subtypes [196,197] using two different genetically-engineered vesicle populations each displaying three subtypes, or nine different subtypes using three different genetically-engineered vesicle populations each displaying three subtypes, etc. Useful subtypes include: Pl.7,16; Pl.5-1,2-2; Pl.19,15-1; Pl.5-2,10; PI. 12-1,13; Pl.7-2,4; Pl.22,14; Pl.7-1,1; Pl.18-1,3,6.<br>
It is also possible, of course, to supplement vesicle preparations with two or three different families.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies<br>
The invention provides a monoclonal antibody that recognises an epitope in a meningococcal NMB1870 protein, wherein said epitope requires the presence of both domains B and C in said NMB1870. Thus the monoclonal antibody does not bind to a separate domain B or to a separate domain C, but it does bind to a combination of domains B and C (and also to full NMB1870). Thus the epitope may be a discontinuous epitope formed from amino acid residues in both domain B and domain C.<br>
The term 'monoclonal antibody' includes any of the various artificial antibodies and antibody-derived proteins which are available e.g. human antibodies, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, single-domain antibodies, single-chain Fv (scFV) antibodies, monoclonal oligobodies, dimeric or trimeric antibody fragments or constructs, minibodies, or functional fragments thereof which bind to the antigen in questioa The antibody is preferably in substantially isolated form.<br>
hi a natural antibody molecule, there are two heavy chains and two light chains. Each heavy chain and each light chain has at its N-terminal end a variable domain. Each variable domain is composed of four framework regions (FRs) alternating with three complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The residues in the variable domains are conventionally numbered according to a system devised by Kabat et al. [198]. The Kabat residue designations do not always correspond directly with the linear numbering of the amino acid residues and the linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids than in the strict Kabat numbering. This may correspond to a shortening of, or insertion into, a structural component, whether framework or CDR, of the basic variable domain structure.<br>
To avoid a non-specific anti-mouse immune response in humans, non-human antibodies are preferably humanized or chimeric. [e.g. refs. 199 &amp; 200]. As an alternative, fully-human antibodies may be used. In chimeric antibodies, non-human constant regions are substituted by human constant regions but variable regions remain non-human. Humanized antibodies may be achieved by a variety of methods including, for example: (1) grafting complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human variable region onto a human framework ("CDR-grafting"), with the optional additional transfer of one or more framework residues from the non-human antibody ("humanizing"); (2) transplanting entire non-human variable domains, but "cloaking" them with a human-like surface by replacement of surface residues ("veneering"). In the present invention, humanized antibodies<br>
-35-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
include those obtained by CDR-grafting, humanizing, and veneering of the variable regions, [e.g. refs. 201 to 207].<br>
Humanized or folly-human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic animals that and engineered to contain human immunoglobulin loci. For example, ref. 208 discloses transgenio animals having a human Ig locus wherein the animals do not produce functional endogenous immunoglobulins due to the inactivation of endogenous heavy and light chain loci. Ref. 209 also discloses transgenic non-primate mammalian hosts capable of mounting an immune response to an immunogen, wherein the antibodies have primate constant and/or variable regions, and wherein the endogenous immunoglobulin-encoding loci are substituted or inactivated. Ref. 210 discloses the use of the Cre/Lox system to modify the immunoglobulin locus in a mammal, such as to replace all or a portion of the constant or variable region to form a modified antibody molecule. Ref. 211 discloses non-human mammalian hosts having inactivated endogenous Ig loci and functional human Ig loci. Ref. 212 discloses methods of making transgenic mice in which the mice lack endogenous heavy chains, and express an exogenous immunoglobulin locus comprising one or more xenogeneic constant regions.<br>
Antibodies naturally have two separate chains, however, it is preferred to use a single chain antibody ("sFv") in which the light and heavy chain variable domains are joined by a linker to give a single polypeptide chain. Kits for preparing sFv's are available off-the-shelf, and anti-ligand sFvs are preferred second sequences for use with the invention. Single domain antibodies can also be obtained from camelids or sharks [213], or by camelisation [214].<br>
A sFv polypeptide is a covalently linked VH-VL heterodimer which is expressed from a gene fusion including VH-and VL- encoding genes linked by a peptide-encoding linker [215], A number of methods have been described to discern and develop chemical strucutres (linkers) for converting the naturally aggregated, but chemically separated, light and heavy polypeptide chains from an antibody V region into an sFv molecule which will fold into a three dimensional structure substantially similar to the structure of an antigen-binding site. See, e.g., refs. 216-218. The sFv molecules may be produced using methods described in the art. Design criteria include determining the appropriate length to span the distance between the C-terminus of one chain and the N-terminus of the other, wherein the linker is generally formed from small hydrophilic amino acid residues that do not coil or form secondary structures. Such methods have been described in the art [e.g. refs. 216-218]. Suitable linkers generally comprise polypeptide chains of alternating sets of glycine and serine residues, and may include glutamic acid and lysine residues inserted to enhance solubility.<br>
"Mini-antibodies" or "minibodies" will also find use with the present invention. Minibodies are sFv polypeptide chains which include oligomerization domains at their C-termini, separated from the sFv by a hinge region [219]. The oligomerization domain comprises self-associating a-helices, e.g., leucine zippers, that can be further stabilized by additional disulfide bonds. The oligomerization domain is designed to be compatible with vectorial folding across a membrane, a process thought to<br>
-36-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
facilitate in vivo folding of the polypeptide into a functional binding protein. Generally, minibodies<br>
are produced using recombinant methods well known in the art. See, e.g [219], [220].	<br>
"Oligobodies" will also find use with the present invention. Oligobodies are synthetic antibodies. The specificity of these reagents has been demonstrated by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. They have some desirable properties, namely that as their production is independent of the immune system, they can be prepared in a few days and there is no need for a purified target protein [221]. Oligobodies are produced using recombinant methods well known in the art [222].<br>
Antibodies are produced using techniques well known to those of skill in the art [e.g. refs. 223-228]. Monoclonal antibodies are generally prepared using the method of Kohler &amp; Milstein (1975) [229], or a modification thereof. Typically, a mouse or rat is immunized as described above. Rabbits may also be used. However, rather than bleeding the animal to extract serum, the spleen (and optionally several large lymph nodes) is removed and dissociated into single cells. If desired, the spleen cells maybe screened (afterremoval of non-specifically adherent cells) by applying a cell suspension to a plate or well coated with the antigen. B-cells, expressing membrane-bound immunoglobulin specific for the antigen, will bind to the plate, and are not rinsed away with the rest of the suspension. Resulting B-cells, or ah1 dissociated spleen cells, are then induced to fuse with myeloma cells to form hybridomas, and are cultured in a selective medium (e.g. 'HAT' medium). The resulting hybridomas are plated by limiting dilution, and are assayed for the production of antibodies which bind specifically to the immunizing antigen (and which do not bind to unrelated antigens). The selected monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas are then cultured either in vitro (e.g. in tissue culture bottles or hollow fiber reactors), or in vivo (e.g. as ascites in mice).<br>
The invention also provides a hybridoma expressing the antibody of the invention. This hybridoma can be used in various ways e.g. as a source of monoclonal antibodies or as a source of nucleic acid (DNA or mRNA) encoding the monoclonal antibody of the invention for the cloning of antibody genes for subsequent recombinant expression.<br>
Antibodies may be produced by any suitable means (e.g. by recombinant expression). Expression from recombinant sources is more common for pharmaceutical purposes than expression from B cells or hybridomas e.g. for reasons of stability, reproducibility, culture ease, etc.<br>
Antibody fragments which retain the ability to recognise NMB1870 are also included within the scope of the invention. A number of antibody fragments are known in the art which comprise antigen-binding sites capable of exhibiting immunological binding properties of an intact antibody molecule. For example, functional antibody fragments can be produced by cleaving a constant region, not responsible for antigen binding, from the antibody molecule, using e.g., pepsin, to produce F(ab')2 fragments. These fragments will contain two antigen binding sites, but lack a portion of the constant region from each of the heavy chains. Similarly, if desired, Fab fragments, comprising a single antigen binding site, can be produced, e.g., by digestion of monoclonal antibodies with papain. Functional fragments, including only the variable regions of the heavy and<br>
-37-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
light chains, can also be produced, using standard techniques such as recombinant production or preferential proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules. These fragments are known as Fv. See, e.g., [230], [231] and [232].<br>
Non-conventional means can also be used to generate and identify the antibodies of the invention. For example, a phage display library can be screened for antibodies of the invention [233-236].<br>
Antibodies of the invention can be of any isotype (e.g. IgA, IgG, IgM i.e. an a, ? or µ heavy chain), but will preferably be IgG. Within the IgG isotype, antibodies may be IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 subclass. Antibodies of the invention may have a K or a #d light chain.<br>
Protein expression<br>
Bacterial expression techniques are known in the art. A bacterial promoter is any DNA sequence capable of binding bacterial RNA polymerase and initiating the downstream (3') transcription of a coding sequence (e.g. structural gene) into mRNA. A promoter will have a transcription initiation region which is usually placed proximal to the 5' end of the coding sequence. This transcription initiation region usually includes an RNA polymerase binding site and a transcription initiation site. A bacterial promoter may also have a second domain called an operator, that may overlap an adjacent RNA polymerase binding site at which RNA synthesis begins. The operator permits negative regulated (inducible) transcription, as a gene repressor protein may bind the operator and thereby inhibit transcription of a specific gene. Constitutive expression may occur in the absence of negative regulatory elements, such as the operator. In addition, positive regulation may be achieved by a gene activator protein binding sequence, which, if present is usually proximal (5') to the RNA polymerase binding sequence. An example of a gene activator protein is the catabolite activator protein (CAP), which helps initiate transcription of the lac operon in Escherichia coli (E. coli) [Raibaud et al. (1984) Annu. Rev. Genet. 75:173]. Regulated expression may therefore be either positive or negative, thereby either enhancing or reducing transcription.<br>
Sequences encoding metabolic pathway enzymes provide particularly useful promoter sequences. Examples include promoter sequences derived from sugar metabolizing enzymes, such as galactose, lactose (lac) [Chang et al. (1977) Nature 198:1056], and maltose. Additional examples include promoter sequences derived from biosynthetic enzymes such as tryptophan (trp) [Goeddel etal. (1980) TVKC. Acids Res. 8:4057; Yelverton etal (1981) Nucl Acids Res. P:731; US patent 4,738,921; EP-A-0036776 and EP-A-0121775]. TheB-lactamase (bid) promoter system [Weissmann (1981) "The cloning of interferon and other mistakes." In Interferon 3 (ed. I. Gresser)], bacteriophage lambda PL [Shimatake et al. (1981) Nature 292:128]and T5 [US patent 4,689,406] promoter systems also provide useful promoter sequences. Another promoter of interest is an inducible arabinose promoter (pBAD).<br>
In addition, synthetic promoters which do not occur in nature also function as bacterial promoters. For example, transcription activation sequences of one bacterial or bacteriophage promoter may be joined with the operon sequences of another bacterial or bacteriophage promoter, creating a synthetic hybrid promoter [US patent 4,551,433]. For example, the tac promoter is a hybrid trp-lac promoter comprised of both trp promoter and lac operon sequences that is regulated by the lac repressor [Amann et al. (1983) Gene 25:167; de Boer et al (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 80:21]. Furthermore, a bacterial promoter can include naturally occurring promoters of non-bacterial origin that have the ability to bind bacterial RNA polymerase and initiate transcription. A naturally occurring promoter of non-bacterial origin can also be coupled with a compatible RNA polymerase to produce high levels of expression of some genes in<br>
-38-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
prokaryotes. The bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase/promoter system is an example of a coupled promoter system [Studier et al. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 189:113; Tabor et al. (1985) Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. 82:1074]. In addition, a hybrid promoter can also be comprised of a bacteriophage promoter and an E. coli operator region (EPO-A-0 267 851).<br>
In addition to a functioning promoter sequence, an efficient ribosome binding site is also useful for the expression of foreign genes in prokaryotes. In E. coli, the ribosome binding site is called the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and includes an initiation codon (ATG) and a sequence 3-9 nucleotides in length located 3-11 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon [Shine et al. (1975) Nature 254:34]. The SD sequence is thought to promote binding of mRNA to the ribosome by the pairing of bases between the SD sequence and the 3' and of E. coli 16S rRNA [Steitz et al. (1979) "Genetic signals and nucleotide sequences in messenger RNA." In Biological Regulation and Development: Gene Expression (ed. R.F. Goldberger)]. To express eukaryotic genes and prokaryotic genes with weak ribosome-binding site [Sambrook et al. (1989) "Expression of cloned genes in Escherichia coli." In Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual\.<br>
A promoter sequence may be directly linked with the DNA molecule, in which case the first amino acid at the N-terminus will always be a methionine, which is encoded by the ATG start codon. If desired, methionine at the N-terminus may be cleaved from the protein by in vitro incubation with cyanogen bromide or by either in vivo on in vitro incubation with a bacterial methionine N-terminal peptidase (EP-A-0219237).<br>
Usually, transcription termination sequences recognized by bacteria are regulatory regions located 3' to the translation stop codon, and thus together with the promoter flank the coding sequence. These sequences direct the transcription of an mRNA which can be translated into the polypeptide encoded by the DNA. Transcription termination sequences frequently include DNA sequences of about 50 nucleotides capable of forming stem loop structures that aid in terminating transcription. Examples include transcription termination sequences derived from genes with strong promoters, such as the trp gene in E. coli as well as other biosynthetic genes.<br>
Usually, the above described components, comprising a promoter, signal sequence (if desired), coding sequence of interest, and transcription termination sequence, are put together into expression constructs. Expression constructs are often maintained in areplicon, such as an extrachromosomal element (e.g. plasmids) capable of stable maintenance in a host, such as bacteria. The replicon will have a replication system, thus allowing it to be maintained in a prokaryotic host either for expression or for cloning and amplification. In addition, a replicon may be either a high or low copy number plasmid. A high copy number plasmid will generally have a copy number ranging from about 5 to about 200, and usually about 10 to about 150. A host containing a high copy number plasmid will preferably contain at least about 10, and more preferably at least about 20 plasmids. Either a high or low copy number vector may be selected, depending upon the effect of the vector and the foreign protein on the host.<br>
Alternatively, the expression constructs can be integrated into the bacterial genome with an integrating vector. Integrating vectors usually contain at least one sequence homologous to the bacterial chromosome that allows the vector to integrate. Integrations appear to result from recombinations between homologous DNA in the vector and the bacterial chromosome. For example, integrating vectors constructed with DNA from various Bacillus strains integrate into the Bacillus chromosome (EP-A-0127328). Integrating vectors may also be comprised of bacteriophage or transposon sequences.<br>
-39-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
Usually, extrachromosomal and integrating expression constructs may contain selectable markers to allow for the selection of bacterial strains that have been transformed. Selectable markers can be expressed in the bacterial host and may include genes which render bacteria resistant to drugs such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, kanamycin (neomycin), and tetracycline [Davies et al. (1978) Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 32:469]. Selectable markers may also include biosynthetic genes, such as those in the histidine, tryptophan, and leucine biosynthetic pathways.<br>
Alternatively, some of the above described components can be put together in transformation vectors. Transformation vectors are usually comprised of a selectable market that is either maintained in a replicon or developed into an integrating vector, as described above.<br>
Expression and transformation vectors, either extra-chromosomal replicons or integrating vectors, have been developed for transformation into many bacteria. For example, expression vectors have been developed for, inter alia, the following bacteria: Bacillus subtilis [Palva et al, (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:5582; EP-A-0 036 259 and EP-A-0 063 953; WO 84/04541], Escherichia coli [Shimatake et al. (1981) Nature 292:12%; Amann et al. (1985) Gene 40:l%3; Studier et al. (1986) J. Mol. Biol 189:112; EP-A-0 036 776,EP-A-0 136 829 and EP-A-0 136 907], Streptococcus cremoris [Powell etal. (19$$) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 54:655]; Streptococcus lividans [Powell et al. (1988) Appl. Environ Microbiol. 54:655], Streptomyces lividans [US patent 4,745,056].<br>
Methods of introducing exogenous DNA into bacterial hosts are well-known in the art, and usually include either the transformation of bacteria treated with CaCl2 or other agents, such as divalent cations and DMSO. DNA can also be introduced into bacterial cells by electroporation. Transformation procedures usually vary with the bacterial species to be transformed. See e.g. \Massonetal. (1989) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 60:273; Palva etal. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 79:55%2; EP-A-0 036 259 and EP-A-0 063 953; WO 84/04541, Bacillus], [Miller et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:%56; Wang et al.

"Sequence identity" is preferably determined by the Smith-Waterman homology search algorithm as implemented in the MPSRCH program (Oxford Molecular), using an affine gap search with parameters gap open penalty=12 and gap extension penalty=l.<br>
After serogroup, meningococcal classification includes serotype, serosubtype and then immunotype, and the standard nomenclature lists serogroup, serotype, serosubtype, and immunotype, each separated by a colon e.g. B:4:P1.15:L3,7,9. Within serogroup B, some lineages cause disease often (hyperinvasive), some lineages cause more severe forms of disease than others (hypervirulent), and others rarely cause disease at all. Seven hypervirulent lineages are recognised, namely subgroups I, III and IV-1, ET-5 complex, ET-37 complex, A4 cluster and lineage 3. These have been defined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), but multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has also been used to classify meningococci [ref. 10]. The four main hypervirulent clusters are ST32, ST44, ST8 and ST11 complexes.<br>
The term "alkyl" refers to alkyl groups in both straight and branched forms, The alkyl group may be interrupted with 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from -O-, -NH- or -S-. The alkyl group may also be interrupted with 1, 2 or 3 double and/or triple bonds. However, the term "alkyl" usually refers to alkyl groups having no heteroatom interruptions or double or triple bond interruptions. Where reference is made to C\.\i alkyl, it is meant the alkyl group may contain any number of carbon atoms between 1 and 12 {e.g. C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, Cg, C9, C10, C11, C12). Similarly, where reference is made to C1-6 alkyl, it is meant the alkyl group may contain any number of carbon atoms between 1 and 6 (e.g. C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6).<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" includes cycloalkyl, polycycloalkyl, and cycloalkenyl groups, as well as combinations of these with alkyl groups, such as cycloalkylalkyl groups. The cycloalkyl group may be interrupted with 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from -O-, -NH- or -S-. However, the term "cycloalkyl" usually refers to cycloalkyl groups having no heteroatom interruptions Examples of cycloalkyl groups include cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclohexylmethyl and adamantyl groups. Where reference is made to C3-12 cycloalkyl, it is meant that the cycloalkyl group may contain any number of carbon atoms between 3 and 12 (e.g. C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12).<br>
The term "aryl" refers to an aromatic group, such as phenyl or naphthyl. Where reference is made to C5-12 aryl, it is meant that the aryl group may contain any number of carbon atoms between 5 and 12 (e.g. C5, C&amp;, C7, Cg, C9, C10, Qi, Cn).<br>
The term "C5-12 aryl-Q.6 alkyl" refers to groups such as benzyl, phenylethyl and naphthylmethyl.<br>
Nitrogen protecting groups include silyl groups (such as TMS, TES, TBS, TIPS), acyl derivatives (such as phthalimides, trifluoroacetamides, methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Z or Cbz), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy carbonyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Troc)), sulfonyl derivatives (such as P-trimethylsilylethanesulfonyl (SES)), sulfenyl derivatives, C1-12 alkyl, benzyl, benzhydryl, trityl, 9-phenylfluorenyl, etc. A preferred nitrogen protecting group is Fmoc.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Epitope mapping<br>
12mer and lOmer fragments of NMB1870MC58 were used for 'PepScan' epitope mapping. The fragments were immobilised on a cellulose membrane and reacted with antisera raised against one strain from each of the three NMB1870 families: (I) MC58; (II) 2996; and (III) M1239. The results of the 12mer analysis are shown in Figure 8.<br><br>
-42-<br>
The region including approximately the first 110 amino acids of NMB 1870 contains linear epitopes that are common to the three families. Residues 120-183 includes family-specific epitopes. No positive peptides were seen further downstream, suggesting either that these sequences are buried in the protein's 3D structure and so could not elicit any antibodies in the serum, or that the epitopes here are discontinuous and are not seen in the 'PepScan' analysis. The following alignment shows the regions of the NMB1870Mc58 sequence (SEQ ID NO: 1) which reacted with each antiserum:<br><br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
The common epitopes for all three families are thus DKGLQSLTLDQSVR (SEQ ID NO: 21) and FDFIRQIEVDGQLI (SEQ ID NO: 22).<br>
Based on the epitope mapping results, the NMB1870 sequence was split into three notional domains:<br>
(A)	Amino acids 1-119 (SEQ ID NO: 4)<br>

These domains were expressed individually as proteins comprising domains A, B or C (SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 6), and together as proteins comprising A-B (SEQ ID NO: 23) or B-C (SEQ ID NO: 24).<br>
The following oligonucleotide primers were using during the construction of these proteins, and introduce Ndel &amp; Xhol restriction sites:<br><br>
A western blot of domains A (truncated to start with VAA...), B and C, using polyclonal anti-NMB1870MC58 as the label, are shown in Figure 9. Fusions AB and BC were also included. The final lane of the blot contains the full-length protein.<br>
-43-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
Antisera against each of domains A, B and C were able to bind to whole cells in FACS analysis (Figure 10). The fluorescence shift was strongest with domains A and C, suggesting that they may be more immunoaccessible. None of the antisera could recognise a ?NMB1870 knockout strain.<br>
Sera were raised in mice against the proteins (and against control proteins) using either CFA or an aluminium hydroxide (AH) as adjuvant, and SBA results against three different meningococcal strains were as follows:<br><br>
Within SEQ ID NO: 1 (MC58), therefore, the most important bactericidal epitopes require the presence of both domains B and C (domain BC). This suggests that the protein may include discontinuous epitopes made of sequences from both of these two domains [cf. ref. 237].<br>
Moreover, monoclonal antibodies Jarl, Jar3, and Jar4, which are capable of passively protecting rats against meningococcal infection, recognise the BC domain but do not recognise domain B or C alone. Similarly, Jar5 recognises the AB domain, but not domain A or B alone.<br>
Further details of this work can be found in reference 238.<br>
Chimericprotein - BM1239-CMc58<br>
To investigate the high bactericidal activity induced by the BC domain, a hybrid BC domain was constructed from a family III domain B (M1239 strain) and a family I domain C (MC58 strain). The B domains of families I and III show 43.8% identity.<br>
SEQ ID NO: 1 is the full-length family I NMB1870 sequence from serogroup B strain MC58. This sequence was split into three domains: (A) aa 1-119; (B) aa 120-183; (C) aa 184-274.<br>
SEQ ID NO: 3 is the full length family III NMB1870 sequence from serogroup B strain M1239. This sequence was also split into three domains: (A) aa 1-127; (B) aa 128-190; (C) aa 191-286.<br>
DNA fragments coding for the B domain of M1239 and the C domain of MC58 were amplified by PCR using as template chromosomal DNA from the specific strains and the following primers:<br>
-44-<br><br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
The amplified fragments were cloned sequentially in pET 21b+ as Ndel/HindIII and HindIII/Xhol fragments. The final BM1239CMC58 sequence was SEQ ID NO: 43, with the KL sequence at the start of domain CMCSS being contributed by a Hindlll restriction site.<br>
The protein was expressed as a C-terminal His-tag fusion protein, purified and used to immunize mice, with either AH of FCA as adjuvant. Sera were analysed for bactericidal activity against the strains representative of the three families of NMB1870. Titers were as follows:<br><br>
The titers induced by the B(1239)-C(MC58) chimera were lower against MC58 than that induced by a B(MC58)-C(MC58) control, and were negative against the M1239 strain. These results demonstrate that, in B-C chimeras, the sequence of the B domain is important for inducing bactericidal antibodies, and that domains B and C should ideally not be separated.<br>
A monoclonal IgG2a antibody (mAb502) that recognises an epitope present only on family I proteins (Figure 11) did not recognise any of the individual domains A, B and C in western blot (Figure 12), but did recognise a domain B-C fragment. These results were also seen in a dot blot of individual domains A, B and C, or a domain B-C fragment (Figure 13). hi addition, however, the antibody recognised a mixture of separate domains B and C, suggesting that the epitope recognised by the antibody can be reconstituted in vitro and is formed by ammo acid residues on both domains. The monoclonal antibody did not recognise any of the PepScan fragments.<br>
The juxtaposition of domains B and C may thus form a conformational epitope.<br>
Chimericprotein - BC2996-BCM1239<br>
SEQ ID NO: 2 is the full-length family IINMB1870 sequence from serogroup B strain 2996. This<br>
sequence was split into three domains: (A) aa 1-119; (B) aa 120-182; (C) aa 183-273.<br>
Domains B and C from strain 2996 were joined to domains B and C from strain M1239, via a glycine-rich linker (SEQ ED NO: 17; GS from a BamHI restriction site; SEQ ID NO: 18 as a poly-glycine linker) to make a BCIIBCIII chimera (SEQ ID NO: 44). DNA encoding the domains was<br>
-45-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
amplified by PCR using as template chromosomal DNA from the specific strains, using the<br>
following primers:<br><br>
The sequences were cloned sequentially in pET 21b+ as Nde I/Bam HI and Bam HI/Xho I fragments The protein was expressed as C-terminal His-tag fusion protein, purified and used to immunize mice.<br>
Briefly, groups of 10 female CD1 mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 20ug of the protein using an aluminum or Freund's adjuvant. The protein was administered either alone, or in combination with the "three protein" combination disclosed on page 33 of ref. 239. Three immunizations were administered, and sera were taken two weeks after the third one and were analysed for bactericidal activity against the strains representative of the three NMB1870 families. Titers against three example strains for each NMB1870 family were as follows:<br><br>
Thus the fusion BC domains from families II and III gives good anti-II and anti-Ill activity but, as expected, does not offer significant anti-I activity. The fused BC domains give lower SBA titers than a fusion of full-length (? G) NMB1870 sequences.<br>
Chimericprotein - BCMC58-BCMU39-BC2996<br>
Using a similar approach, a chimera of BC domains for all three NMB1870 families was constructed.<br>
The following primers were used for amplifying domains:<br>
-46-<br><br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
The final sequence has SEQ ID NO: 52, with the family I sequence being joined to the family III sequence by SEQ ID NO: 17 (a BamHI restriction site, then the poly-Gly linker), and the family III sequence being joined to the family II sequence by SEQ ID NO: 45 (a Hindlll restriction site, then the poly-Gly linker).<br>
A further chimera was produced, with the BC domains in the order I-II-EH rather than I-IH-II. This chimera was tested in bactericidal assay, alongside a chimera of the BC domains of a family II strain fused to a family III strain, and the SEAM-3 positive control. Results were as follows:<br><br>
In all cases but one (NGH38), therefore, the triple chimera gave better results than the double chimera. This finding was not surprising for family I strains, as the double chimera did not include a<br>
NMB1870 sequence for this family. Even for families II and III, however, results were improved.<br>
-47-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
Significantly, the number of family II strains where titres were &gt;128 was 9/13 with the triple chimera, against only 6/13 for the double chimera.<br>
Monoclonal antibody 502<br>
To select anti-NMB1870 monoclonal antibodies with bactericidal activity, CD1 mice were immunised with family I NMB1870MC58- Polyclonal sera from individual mice were evaluated for antibody binding by ELISA on the purified protein and on whole MC58 cells, and for complement mediated bactericidal activity against MC58. On the basis of these results the spleen of a high responder mouse was selected for the fusion with myeloma cells. Several hybridoma cell lines producing antibodies were isolated and selected by positive ELISA against the purified protein or against MC58 whole bacterial cells. MAb502, an IgG2a isotype monoclonal antibody bactericidal against MC58 strain, was selected for further studies. The antibody recognised the purified protein by ELISA and was positive in FACS analysis on strain MC58.<br>
Western blot analysis against NMB1870 from each of the three variants confirmed that mAb502 recognises an epitope present only in family I sequences. In contrast, polyclonal serum recognised all three variants. Monoclonal mAb502 was used in FACS analysis against a number of family I strains. In each case the antibody recognised cell surface antigens (Figure 14, top row). The fluorescence shift was not as great as when using anti-NMBl 870 polyclonal (middle row) or using an anti-capsule monoclonal SEAM3 (bottom row), but the binding was specific. In contrast, mAb502 did not recognise a 7NMB1870 knockout strain (Figure 15, left column) and did not recognise family II or family III strains (middle and right columns). The anti-capsule positive control recognised all of the unrecognised strains (Figure 15, bottom row).<br>
Chimericprotein - NMB1870Mc58-NMB1870Mm9-NMB18702996<br><br>
The protein could be purified as a soluble product after growth at 30°C.<br>
-48-<br>
As an alternative approach to providing a single polypeptide containing all the three NMB1870 families, full-length proteins (except for slight N-terminus truncation, up to and including the native poly-Gly sequences i.e. ? G proteins) were fused to make a triple chimeric sequence SEQ ID NO: 53. The family I sequence is joined to the family III sequence by SEQ ID NO: 19 (a BamHI restriction site, then a gonococcal linker, SEQ ID NO: 20), and the family III sequence being joined to the family II sequence by SEQ ID NO: 54 (a Hindlll restriction site, then the gonococcal linker). The protein was expressed as a C-terminal His-tag fusion after amplification using the following primers:<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
The purified triple chimera (3-C) protein was administered to mice, and the resulting sera were tested in the bactericidal assay, using either an aluminium hydroxide (AH) or a complete Freund's adjuvant. Sera raised against the homologous NMB1870 protein (adjuvanted with AH) were also tested:<br><br>
hi almost all cases, therefore, the triple chimeric protein gave a better bactericidal serum than the individual homologous proteins. The triple chimera thus offers two advantages: (1) coverage of all NMB1870 families in a single protein; and (2) enhanced bactericidal response relative to a single homologous NMB1870 protein.<br>
Comparison of immunogenicity of domains<br>
The A, B and C domains of the MC58 ? G-NMB1870 sequence (family I) were prepared singly and as AB and BC fusions, all with C-terminal His-tags. They were used to immunise mice and sera were tested for bactericidal activity against a strain from each NMB 1870 family. For comparison, sera raised in response to the three families' 7G-NMB1870 sequences were also tested. Proteins were adjuvanted either with an aluminium hydroxide or with FCA. Results were as follows:<br>
-49-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
Thus the individual domains are not particularly effective irnmunogens, the AB domain is also not particularly effective, but the BC domain shows good activity.<br>
3D model of BC domain<br>
A prediction of super-secondary structure for the BC domain was obtained by submitting the MC58 sequence to the HMMSTR/Rosetta server [240]. The output is shown in Figure 1.<br>
The 3D structure was subjected to a VAST search [241] to find similarity to solved protein structures and to refine loops. The VAST output (Figure 2) was:<br><br>
Using the VAST output, the 229-259 fragment (top-right of Figure 2) was further modeled and modified by introducing turns in the backbone along the dashed line of Figure 2. The resulting model was refined by energy minimization, to give the final model of Figure 3.<br>
This model is shown with surface loops highlighted in Figure 6.<br>
Surface epitope mapping<br>
A multiple sequence alignment of the BC domains of NMB1870 sequences from strains recognised in western blots mAb502 revealed various sequence information. All strains that are bound by the<br>
-50-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
antibody include residue Arg223, but this residue is His in strains that are not recognised in the blots. Even so, not all of the sequences with Arg223 produce bactericidal sera, and so the total bactericidal epitope must be broader than this single residue.<br>
The alignment identified other residues that could be involved in the formation of a specific bactericidal epitope: Phel28 (F), Ilel33 (I), Asnl97 (N), Gly2217 (G), Lys249 (K), Lys260 (K) and Val262 (V). All these amino acids (grey backgrounds below) are perfectly conserved among ET-5 strains (such as MC58), which are BCA-positive, but differ in the BCA-negative strains:<br><br>
Similar work based on aligning sequences from strains that react with a bactericidal polyclonal serum identified the following residues: Phel28, Ilel33, Asnl97 and Gly221. Residues Lys249, Lys260 and Val262, which were identified by the monoclonal antibody, were discarded at this stage, as these three residues were conserved in the NMB1870 sequence of a BCA-negative strain (M2197).<br>
From the 3D model of NMB1870, Phel34 and I1el39 are seen to lie within a predicted alpha-helix, and therefore not well accessible to antibodies. On the other hand, both the Asnl97 and Gly221 are contained within surface loops and are well exposed. Both Gly221 and Asnl97 are spatially close to Arg223, and could thus be part of the same epitope. Looking at Gly221, BCA-negative strains often have this small and neutral amino acid substituted with a Glu or Lys, both of which are bulky and charged. This substitution could impair proper recognition and binding of antibody to this epitope.<br>
This analysis thus reveals five key amino acids: Phel28, Bel 33, Asnl97, Gly221 and Arg223. When these residues are mapped to the 3D model (Figure 4), three of them cluster at the protein surface (Figure 5). Alignment with a secondary structure prediction (Figure 16) also shows that Ilel33, Asnl97, Gly221 and Arg223 are located in hydrophilic regions {i.e. in surface loops).<br>
-51-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
Other important residues could be the dipeptide AD in position 215-216, which is substituted in most BCA-negative strains by AY, and by SD in some weakly responders.<br>
Mutagenesis used the GeneTailor™ SDM system from Invitrogen. Internal primers containing codon changes were designed according to the instruction manual specifications, and were as follows:<br><br>
Amino acids 197,221 and 223 were mutated as follows:<br><br>
To generate each mutant, lOOng of the pET-? G741(])-His plasmid DNA were used as template in o methylation reaction, then 12.5ng of methylated plasmid were employed as substrate in a mutagenesis reaction, using the following primer pairs:<br><br>
PCR was performed according to the GeneTailor™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis System instruction manual. After the reaction, l0µl of the product were analysed on a 1% agarose gel, then 2µl from mutagenesis reaction mixture were transformed into DH5a™-TlR E.coli strain according to manual specifications. Positive colonies were analysed by plasmid isolation (QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit, QIAGEN™) and sequencing. To generate the double-mutant ?G741(1)-His-N197H-G221K, the DNA of the positive mutant ? G741(l)-His-G221K was used as substrate for the next one with the corresponding pair of primers 741(i)-N197H for/741 (1)-N197H rev.<br>
For expression of the recombinant protein as C terminal-His-tag fusion, 1.5µl of each construct was used to transform E.coli BL2I-DE3 strain. Single recombinant colonies were inoculated into 4ml LB+Amp (l00µg/ml), incubated at 37°G overnight, then diluted 1:30 in 20ml of LB+Amp (l00µg/ml) in 125ml flasks, to give an OD600mn between 0.1 and 0.2. The flasks were incubated at 37°C in a gyratory water bath shaker until OD600nm indicated exponential growth suitable for induction of expression (0.4-0.8 OD). Protein expression was induced by addition of l.0mM IPTG. After 3 hours incubation at 37°C the OD600nm was measured and expression examined. 1.0ml of each sample was centrifuged in a microfuge, the pellet resuspended in PBS and analysed by SDS-PAGE<br>
-52-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
and Coomassie Blue staining. All the mutants were expressed as well as wild type and purified as soluble forms at 37°C.<br>
Loop substitution<br>
Based on the 3D model and on the epitope mapping work, surface loops from family II and family III of NMB1870 were transferred into a family I framework.<br>
For Loopl, the amino acid sequence is 100% conserved among all family II and family III strains. In all the three families, Loopl is flanked by two alpha helices (not conserved in sequence) that likely contribute to the correct exposure/folding of the loop. The Glyl40 residue is not found in the family I M6190 sequence, and while monoclonals Jar3 and Jar5 bind to family I sequences they fail to bind to M6190, farther confirming the epitopic importance of this loop. The family II sequence was chosen for insertion into the family I framework.<br>
Loop2 corresponds to a bactericidal epitope. The only difference between families II and III at this position is an Asp/Gly substitution. Analysis of bactericidal responses among family II strains suggests a critical role for the Asp residue, so the family II sequence was chosen.<br>
Loop3 is highly variable within families II and III, but is conserved in family I. In family II, a majority of strains has sequence PNG, but in family HI the majority have AGG. Although this loop seems dispensable for protection (PNG strains are able to protect against family III AGG strains), to cover both possibilities the family IAG sequence was substituted with PN.<br>
Asnl97 in Loop4 was previously identified as an important residue to discriminate between BCA-positive and BCA-negative strains of family I, and is always conserved in ET-5 strains. This residue is substituted by His in all family II strains and in a subgroup of family III strains. In addition, His is also present in some family I strains. His was thus used in this loop, to cover families II and III, plus any family I sequences not covered by the MC58 sequence.<br>
Loop5, Loop6 and Loop7 are the same in families II and III, but different from family I. For these three loops the family 11/111 sequences were used. The second residue in the loop is Gly rather than Val because family II strains that are susceptible to serum raised against the strain 2996 protein have this residue at that position.<br>
The substitutions are shown in Figure 7, to change SEQ ID NO: 1 into SEQ ID NO: 61. Loops 1, 2 and 4 received family II sequences; loop 3 received the family III sequence; and loops 5, 6 and 7 received a sequence common to both families II and III. With 28 substitutions out of 274 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and 273 (SEQ ID NO: 61) amino acids in total, the overall identity after surface loop exchange remains at &gt;90%.<br>
The loops were substituted in series. Seven proteins were made in this series, with each loop of the ? GNMB1870MC58 sequence being substituted in order. The seven substituted proteins were referred to as LP1, LP2,..., LP7. The LP7 mutant is SEQ ID NO: 61.<br>
The GeneTailor™ SDM system was used for this work (see above), with the following printers:<br>
-53-<br><br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
All proteins were expressed as well as the wild-type protein and could be purified as soluble products after growth at 37°C. The proteins LP1, LP2, ..., LP7 were used to immunise mice, and the resulting sera were tested against various different strains of serogroup B meningococcus, including at least three from each NMB 1870 family. The starting protein (LPO) was also tested. The proteins were adjuvanted either with an aluminium hydroxide (AH) adjuvant or with FCA (F). In the following table, each row (except for the bottom row) shows the SBA for a single serum, tested against nine exemplary strains. The bottom row shows the activity of a serum obtained using the wild-type antigen from the homologous NMB1870 (i. e.. testing anti-NMB 1 870MC58 serum against MC5 8, etc.):<br><br>
Progressing from LPO (no substitutions; NMB1870; family I) to LP7 through LPI, LP2, etc., sera raised against the protein become more active against strains whose NMB 1870 is in family II or family III. As family I sequences are substituted with family II/III sequences then, contrary to a priori expectations, bactericidal responses against family I strains show an upward trend.<br>
-54-<br><br>
WO 2006/024954	PCT/IB2005/002968<br>
Thus SEQ ID NO: 61 contains surface epitopes from families II and III, to replace family I epitopes. The chimeric polypeptide can be used to raise antibodies against NMB1870 from families II and III, and can be combined with a normal family I sequence to give multi-family antigenicity. The combination may be as a mixture of two separate polypeptides, or may be in the form of a hybrid [7] e.g. NH2-X1-SEQ:61-X2-SEQ:1-X3-COOH, NH2-X]-SEQ:1-X2-SEQ:61-X3-COOH, etc.<br>
New NMB1870 sequences<br>
Extensive sequence information for NMB1870 is available [e.g. refs 3, 5, 6 and 7]. Further new NMB1870 sequences have been found.<br>
The sequence for strain 4243 is given as SEQ ID NO: 62, starting at the N-terminal cysteine of the mature protein. The cleaved leader peptide is the same as a normal family I sequence.<br>
A fourth family of NMB1870 has been seen in strain M.01.0240320 ('gb320'; SEQ ID NO: 63) and in strain SI0026 (SEQ ID NO: 64). The sequence from m3813 (SEQ ID NO: 21 of ref. 7; SEQ ID NO: 65 herein) can also be classified into family IV.<br>
It will be understood that the invention is described above by way of example only and modifications may be made whilst remaining within the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>

'NMB1870' is a known surface protein in Neisseria meningitidis expressed across all serogroups. It has three distinct families. Serum raised against a given family is bactericidal within the same family, but is not active against strains which express one of the other two families i.e. intra-family but not inter-family cross-protection. The inventors have found that NMB1870 can be divided into domains, and that not all domains are required for antigenicity. Antigenic domains can be taken from each of the three NMB1870 families and expressed as a single polypeptide chain. The inventors have also found that NMB1870 exposes some of its epitopes in surface loops situated between alpha helices, and that substitution of loop epitopes from one family into the loop position in another family allows chimeric NMB 1870 to be produced with multi-family antigenicity. Thus chimeric NMB1870 proteins are provided that comprise portions of NMB1870 from different families.</td>
