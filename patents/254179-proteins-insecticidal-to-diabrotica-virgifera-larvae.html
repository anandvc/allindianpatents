Background of the Invention<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to new insecticidal secreted proteins ("ISPs") isolated from a bacterial strain, preferably a Brevibacillus species strain, most preferably a Brevibacillus laterosoorus species strain which are insecticidal when ingested in combination with an ISP-complimentary protein such as another ISP protein of this invention, and to DNA sequences encoding such proteins. These proteins are useful to prevent or minimize insect damage, particularly of corn rootworms, to plants in a field.<br>
The present invention also relates to plants, particularly corn plants, that are rendered insecticidal, preferably to coleopteran insects, particularly to Diabrotica spp., Leotinotarsa spp. and Anthonomus species insects, by the expression of the ISP proteins of this invention in cells of said plants.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for controlling damage by Diabrotica spp., Leptinptarsa spp. or Anthonornus species insects, preferably Diabrotica spp. insect pests, particularly corn rootworms, by having the ISP proteins of the invention, particularly the proteins with the amino acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID No. 2, 4, 8 or 10, or insecticidaily-effective fragments thereof, ingested by said insects.<br><br>
2. Description of trg Prior Art<br>
Some of the most destructive pests are found among the Diabroticine beetles. In North America, the three important species of corn rootworms, Diabrotica virqifera (the Western corn rootworm), Diabrotica barberi (the Northern corn rootworm) and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi (the Southern com rootworm) are considered to be the most expensive insect pests to control (Metcalf, 1986, Foreword in "Methods for the Study of Pest Diabrotica", pp. vii-xv, eds. Krysan, J.L and Miller, T.A., Springer-Verlag, New York). Diabrotica virqifera.and Diabrotica barberi are considered the most serious insect pests of com in the major corn-producing states of the United States and Canada (Levine and Oloumi-Sadeghi, 1991, Annu. Rev. Entomol. 36, 229-55). The larvae feed on the roots and thus cause direct damage to corn growth and com yields. Costs for soil insecticides to control larval damage to the root systems of com and aeriai sprays to reduce beetle damage to corn silks, when combined with crop losses, can approach one billion dollars annually (Metcalf, 1986, supra). Recently, in some US states it was discovered that the crop rotation program of planting soybeans after com lost its effect as corn rootworms have adapted to this situation.<br>
Bacterial strains and/or genes with toxicity to com rootworm have been described in US patents 6,023,013; 6,015,553; 6,001,637; 5,906,818; and 5,645,831. Also, PCT publications WO 00/09697, WO 99/57282, WO 98/18932, WO 97/40162, and WO 00/26378 relate to toxins and genes obtainable from Bacillus or other bacterial spp., some of which are described to have toxicity to corn rootworm. WO 98/44137, WO 94/21795 and WO 96/10083 relate to pesticidal Bacillus strains, characterized by pesticidal proteins and auxiliary proteins produced during vegetative growth, some of which are described to have toxicity to corn rootworm. US patent 5,055,293 describes a method to control corn rootworms by inoculating soil with parasporal-inclusion forming species of Bacillus laterosporus.<br><br>
Orlova et al. (1998 Applied Environmental Microbiol. 64, 2723} showed insecticidal activity to mosquitoes associated with protein crystals in crystal-forming strains of Bacillus laterosporus.<br>

In accordance with this invention, new bacterial toxins and DNA sequences encoding them have been isofated and characterized. The new proteins were designated ISP1A and ISP2A, and the DNA sequences encoding them isplA and isp2A.<br>
In accordance with this invention "ISP1A protein" refers to any protein comprising the smallest protein fragment of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2 which retains insecticidal activity, particularly to coleopteran insects, more particularly to corn rootworm, cotton boll weevil and Colorado potato beetle, preferably to Diabrotica spp„ especially to Southern, Western and Northern corn rootworm, particularly to Diabrotica virqifera, upon combined ingestion by an insect with a suitable ISP-complimentary protein, particularly the mature 1SP2A protein. This includes any protein with an amino acid sequence comprising the amino acid sequence from the amino acid at position 32 or 38, preferably 38, to an amino acid at a position from amino acid position 768 to amino acid position 871 in SEQ ID No. 2, particularly any protein with an amino acid sequence comprising at least the amino<br><br>
acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2 from amino acid position 38 to amino acid position 768. This also includes the protein obtained from the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2 by cleaving off part or all of the N-terminal signal peptide sequence or the protein wherein the signal peptide sequence has been replaced by another, e.g. a plant, targeting peptide, a methionine amino acid or a methionine-alanine dipeptide. Specifically, this includes the protein comprising an N-terminal prokaryotic or eucaryotic, e.g. bacterial or plant, signal peptide for secretion or targeting. This also includes hybrids or chimeric proteins comprising the above described smallest toxic protein fragment, e.g., a hybrid between an ISP1A and ISP2A protein of this invention. Further, included in the designation "ISP1A", as used herein, are also protease-resistant fragments of the ISP1A protein retaining insecticidal activity obtainable by treatment with insect gut juice, preferably coleopteran gut juice, particularly coleopteran gut proteases, preferably corn rootworm proteases, e.g., cysteine proteinases, serine proteinases, trypsin, chymotrypsin or trypsin-like proteases.

Diabrotica barberi, Diabrotica undecimpuncata, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and Anthonomus qrandis. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, an ISP1A protein according to this invention is not insecticidal when ingested in isolation without providing simultaneously or sequentially, an ISP complimentary protein such as an ISP2A protein.<br>
In accordance with this invention "ISP2A protein" refers to any protein comprising the smallest protein fragment of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 4 which retains insecticidal activity, particularly to coleopteran insects, more particularly to corn rootworm, cotton boll weevil and Colorado potato beetle, preferably to Diabrotica spp., especially to Diabrotica virqifera, Diabrotica barberi. Diabrotica undecimpuncata. upon combined ingestion by an insect with a suitable ISP-complimentary protein, particularly the mature<br><br>
ISP1A protein. This includes any protein with an amino acid sequence comprising the amino acid sequence from the amino acid at position 43 or 51, preferably 51, to the amino acid at a position from amino acid position 449 to position 457 in SEQ ID No. 4, particularly any protein with an amino acid sequence comprising at least the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 4 from amino acid position 51 to position 449. This also includes the protein obtained from the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 4 by cleaving off part or all of the N-terminal signal peptide sequence of the protein, and the protein wherein the signal peptide has been replaced by another, e.g., a plant, targeting peptide, a methionine amino acid or a methionine-alanine dipeptide. Specifically, this includes the protein comprising an N-terminal prokaryotic or eucaryotic, e.g. bacterial or plant, signal peptide for secretion or targeting. This also includes hybrids or chimeric proteins comprising the above described smallest toxic protein fragment, e.g., a hybrid between an ISP1A and ISP2A protein of this invention. Further, included in the designation "ISP2A", as used herein, are also protease-resistant fragments of the ISP2A protein retaining insecticidal activity obtainable by treatment with insect gut juice, preferably coleopteran gut juice, particularly coleopteran gut proteases, e.g., cysteine proteinases, serine proteinases, trypsin, chymotrypsin ortrypsin-like proteases. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, an ISP2A protein according to this invention is not insecticidal when ingested in isolation without providing simultaneously or sequentially, an ISP complimentary protein such as an ISP1A protein.<br>
An "ISP-complimentary protein", as used herein, refers to a protein, including but not limited to the mature ISP1A or ISP2A protein, which in combination with one of the ISP proteins of this invention, is insecticidal upon ingestion by an insect, particularly a coleopteran insect, preferably a corn rootworm, a cotton boll weevil or Colorado potato beetle, more particularly Diabrotica viroifera. Diabrotica barberi, Diabrotica undecimpuncata or Anthonomus grandis. Particularly, also VIP proteins and active fragments thereof, particularly the mature VIP<br><br>
proteins with their signal sequences cleaved off, as described in WO 98/44137, WO 94/21795 and WO 96/10083 are ISP-complimentary proteins in accordance with this invention. An ISP-complimentary protein to the ISP1A protein is ideally the ISP2A protein or the VlP2Aa or VIP2Ab protein or active fragments thereof (such as the mature proteins with the signal sequences removed) as described in US patent 5,990,383, or any bacterial secreted protein which has a sequence identity of at least 50 %, preferably at least 75 %, particularly at least 85 %, to any one of the 1SP2 or VIP2 proteins, and which is insecticidal when ingested by an insect, preferably a coieopteran insect, particularly a corn rootworm, in combination with the mature ISP1A protein. An ISP-complimentary protein to the ISP2A protein is ideally the mature ISP1A protein, the V[P1Aa or VIP1Ab protein or active fragments thereof (such as the mature protein with the signal peptide removed) as described in US patent 5,990,383, or any bacterial secreted protein which has a sequence identity of at least 50 %, preferably at least 75 %, particularly at least 85 %, to any one of the ISP1 or VIP1 proteins, and which is insecticidal when ingested by an insect, preferably a coieopteran insect, particularly a corn rootworm, in combination with the mature ISP2A protein. For the avoidance of doubt, an ISP-complimentary protein and an ISP protein are always different proteins.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the ISP proteins of this invention, or their equivalents, when used in isolation, i.e., without any of the complementary ISP proteins present, do not result in any significant insecticidal activity, preferably to com rootworm larvae, particularly to Diabrotica virqifera, when tested in a surface contamination assay on standard insect diet, and this at a concentration wherein the proteins (each applied in that concentration) in combination result in 100% mortality, preferably to com rootworm larvae, particularly to Diabrotica virqifera. Particularly, the ISP1 proteins of this invention give no significant mortality (i.e., no difference with the controls using a buffer solution alone) to<br><br>
Diabrotica virqifera larvae when only an ISP1 protein is applied at a concentration of 70ng/cm2 in a surface contamination assay using standard corn rootworm diet, and the ISP2 proteins of this invention give no significant mortality (i.e., no difference with the controls using a buffer solution alone) to Diabrotica virqifera larvae when only an ISP2 protein is applied at a concentration of 36 ng/cm2 in a surface contamination assay using standard corn rootworm diet, while 1SP1 and ISP2 proteins applied together in these concentrations in the same type of assay give 100 % mortality to these larvae.<br>
As used herein, "1SP1A equivalent" or "ISP2A equivalent" refers to a protein with the same or substantially the same toxicity to a target insect as the ISP1A or ISP2A protein, respectively, when applied to such target insect, preferably when ingested by such insect, in a binary combination with an ISP-complimentary protein, and with substantially the same amino acid sequence as the ISP1A or ISP2A protein, respectively. Also included in the definition of ISP1A or ISP2A equivalents are bacterial proteins of respectively about 45 to about 50 kD and about 95 to about 100 kD molecular weight as determined by standard 8-10 % SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, preferably from a Brevibacillus laterosporus strain, particularly from a Brevibacillus laterosporus strain not forming crystalline inclusions, which proteins in combination but not in isolation, have significant insecticidal activity to corn rootworm larvae.<br>
The use of the terms "in combination", when referring to the application of an ISP protein (or J its equivalent) and an ISP-complimentary protein to a target insect to get an insecticidal , effect, includes the simultaneous application (i.e., in the same feed, cells or tissue and applied or ingested by an insect at the same moment) and the separate, sequential ! application (i.e. one is provided after the other but not applied or ingesfed at the same time); of an ISP protein (or its equivalent) and an ISP-complimentary protein of this invention, as '<br>
j<br>
long as these proteins are found together in the insect gut at one moment in time.   The<br><br>
ISP1A protein of this invention could thus be expressed in a certain type of cells or a certain zone in the roots of a plant, while the ISP2A protein of this invention could be expressed in another kind of cells or another zone in the roots of the same plant, so that the proteins will only interact once root material is ingested. Also included herein is the expression of an ISP protein or its equivalent in roots of a plant, particularly a corn plant, and the expression of an ISP-complimentary protein in root-associated bacteria such as rhizobacteha strains (or vice versa).<br>
"The same toxicity to a target insect", with respect to an ISP protein and an ISP equivalent protein as used herein, means that the mean mortality of the ISP protein, in the presence of a suitable ISP-complimentary protein, is not significantly different from the mean mortality of the ISP equivalent, also in the presence of the same suitable ISP-complimentary protein. Particularly, this refers to the situation wherein the 95% fiducial limits of the LC50 of the ISP protein (when tested in the presence of a suitable ISP-comptimentary protein) overlap with the 95% fiducial limits of the LC50 of the ISP equivalent (when tested in the presence of a suitable ISP-complimentary protein).<br>
"Substantially the same toxicity to a target insect", as used herein with respect to an ISP protein and an ISP equivalent protein, refers to levels of mean mortality of such proteins to a target insect which are significantly different between the ISP and the ISP equivalent protein, but which are still within a range of tnsecticidaf activity which is useful to control or kill the relevant target insect, preferably when such protein is expressed in a plant. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, proteins have substantially the same toxicity to a target insect when their LC50 values for such a target insect in the same (replicated) in vitro assay conducted under the same assay conditions differ from each other by a factor 2 to 100, preferably 2 to 50, particularly 2 to 20, most preferably 2 to 10.<br><br>
Also, functionally analogous amino acids can be used to replace certain amino acids in an ISP1A or ISP2A protein to obtain iSP1A or ISP2A equivalents. For example, one or more amino acids within the sequence can be substituted by other amino acids of a similar polarity which act as a functional equivaient, resulting in a silent alteration with respect to functionality of the protein. Substitutes for an amino acid within the sequence can be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs. For example, the nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine. The polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine. lysine and histidine. The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Proteins wherein conservative amino acids replacements are made using amino acids of the above indicated same class which retain substantially the same insecticidal activity to a target insect compared to the original protein, are included herein as equivalents of the ISP proteins of this invention.<br>
A protein with "substantially the same amino acid sequence" to an ISP1A protein, as used herein, refers to a protein with at least 90 %, particularly at least 95 %, preferably at least 97 % sequence identity with the ISP1A protein, wherein the percentage sequence identity is determined by using the blosum62 scoring matrix in the GAP program of the Wisconsin package of GCG (Madison, Wisconsin, USA) version 10.0 (GCG defaults used). "Sequence identity", as used throughout this application, when related to proteins, refers to the percentage of identical amino acids using this specified analysis. The "sequence identity", as used herein, when related to DNA sequences, Is determined by using the nwsgapdna scoring matrix in the GAP program of the Wisconsin package of GCG (Madison, Wisconsin, USA) version 10.0 (GCG defaults used).<br><br>
"ISP protein" or "ISP protein of this invention", as used herein, refers to any one of the new proteins of this invention and identified herein as ISP1A or ISP2A protein or their equivalents. An "ISP protoxin" refers to the full length ISP1A or ISP2A protein as it is encoded by the naturally-occurring bacterial DNA sequence, including the signal peptide.-An "ISP toxin" refers to an insecticidal fragment thereof, particularly the smallest toxic fragment thereof or the mature protein with the signal peptide removed. A "mature" ISP, as used herein, refers to the ISP protein of this invention as secreted by its native bacterial host cell which is insecticidally active in combination with an ISP-complimentary protein (without the N-terminal bacterial signal peptide sequence). A mature ISP protein can have a complete native C-terminal or can have a C-terminal truncation.<br>
Also included in this invention as an ISP protein is a first protein with an apparent molecular weight of its mature form of about 95 to about 100 kD, particularly about 100 kD, which is secreted by a bacterium, preferably a bacterium which is not B. thurinqiensis or B. cereus, particularly a bacterium which is Brevibacillus laterosporus, or insecticidally effective fragments of said first protein, characterized by a significant insecticidal activity when combined with a second protein with an apparent molecular weight of its mature form of about 45 to about 50 kD, preferably about 45 kD, which is secreted by a bacterium, preferably a bacterium which is not B. thurinoiensis or B. cereus. particularly a bacterium which is Brevibacillus laterosporus. or insecticidally effective fragments of said second protein, wherein the combination of said first and said second protein, or their insecticidal fragments, is significantly insecticidal to larvae of the Colorado potato beetle, the Western corn rootworm, the Southern corn rootworm, and the Northern corn rootworm, when ingested by said insects, and wherein said protein combination is not significantly insecticidal to Ostrinia nubilalis. Spodoptera fruqiperda. Heliothis virescens. Helicoveroa zea and Sesamia nonaqroides, when ingested by said insects, and wherein said<br><br>
first protein alone has no significant insecticidal activity when ingested by an insect. Also included herein is the second protein as described above which is insecticidal when ingested by an insect in combination with the above described first protein.<br>
"Apparent molecular weight", as used herein, is the molecular weight as evidenced by SD3-PAGE analysis upon comparison with molecular weight standards. As is appreciated by the skilled person, this molecular weight is an approximate determination and can have a range of variation of about 10-15 % with respect to the actual molecular weight as determined based on the amino acid sequence.<br>
As used herein, the terms "isplA DNA" or "isp2A DNA" refer to any DNA sequence encoding the ISP1A or ISP2A protein, respectively, as defined above. This includes naturally occurring, artificial or synthetic DNA sequences encoding the npwly isolated proteins or their fragments as defined above, particularly DNA sequences wijh a modified codon usage adapted to more closely match the codon usage of a plant. \ Examples of artificial DNA sequences encoding an ISP1A and ISP2A protein are shown i$ SEQ ID Nos. 9 and 7, respectively (the ISP proteins encoded by these DNA sequences' are defined herein as ISP1A-1 and ISP2A-1). Also included herein are DNA sequences encoding insecticidal proteins which are similar enough to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID No. 1, 3, 7 or 9 so that they can {i.e., have the ability to) hybridize to these DNA sequences under stringent hybridization conditions. "Stringent hybridization conditions", as used herein, refers particularly to the following conditions wherein hybridization is still obtained: immobilizing a first DNA sequence on filters, and prehybridizing the filters for either 1 to 2 hours in 50 % fonmamide, 5 % SSPE, 2x Denhardt's reagent and 0.1 % SDS at 42 " C or 1 to 2 hours in 6x ; SSC, 2xDenhardt's reagent and 0.1 % SDS at 68 "C. The denatured radiolabeled second DNA is then added directly to the prehybridization fluid and incubation is carried out for 16 to<br><br>
24 hours at one of the above selected temperatures. After incubation, the filters are then washed for 20 minutes at room temperature in 1x SSC, 0.1 % SDS, followed by three washes of 20 minutes each at 68 °C in 0.2x SSC and 0.1 % SDS. An autoradiagraph is established by exposing the filters for 24 to 48 hours to X-ray film (Kodak XAR-2 or equivalent) at -70 °C with an intensifying screen. Of course, equivalent conditions and-parameters can be used in this process while still retaining the desired stringent hybridization conditions. As used herein, stringent hybridization preferably occurs between DNA sequences with at least 90 to 95 %, preferably at least 97 %, particularly 99%, sequence identity.<br>
Also included in the definition of "ispl DNA" are all DNA sequences encoding a protein with a sequence identity of at least 90 %, preferably at feast 95 %, particularly at least 97 %, most preferably at least 99 % with the protein of SEQ ID.

An "jsg gene" or "isp. DNA", as used herein, is a DNA sequence encoding an ISP protein in accordance with this invention, referring to any one of the isp_1A or isp2A DNA sequences defined above.<br>
An "isp. DNA equivalent" or an "jsp. gene equivalent", as used herein, is a DNA encoding an ISP equivalent protein as defined above.<br>
The terms "DNA/protein comprising the sequence X" and "DNA/protein with the sequence comprising sequence X", as used herein, refer to a DNA or protein including or containing at least the sequence X in their nucleotide or amino acid sequence, so that other nucleotide or amino acid sequences can be included at the 5' (or N-terminal) and/or 3' (or C-terminal) end, e.g., an N-terminal transit or signal peptide. The term "comprising", as used herein, is open-ended language in the meaning of "including", meaning that other elements then those specifically recited can also be present. The term "consisting of, as used herein, is closed-ended language, i.e., oniy those elements specifically recited are present. The term "DNA encoding a protein comprising sequence X", as used herein, refers to a DNA comprising a coding sequence which after transcription and translation results in a protein containing at (east amino acid sequence X. A DNA encoding a protein need not be a naturally-occurring DNA, and can be a semi-synthetic, fully synthetic or artificiaf DNA and can include introns and 5' and/or 3' flanking regions. The term "nucleotide sequence", as used herein, refers to the sequence of a DNA or RNA molecule, which can be in single- or double-stranded form.<br>
The term "gene", as used herein refers to a DNA coding region flanked by 5' and/or 3' regulatory sequences allowing an RNA to be transcribed which can be translated to a protein, typically comprising at least a promoter region. A "chimeric gene", when referring to an isp DNA of this invention, refers to an jsp DNA sequence having 5' and/or 3" regulatory<br><br>
sequences different from the naturally-occurring bacterial 5' and/or 3' regulatory sequences which drive the expression of the ISP protein in its native host cell.<br>
"Insecticidal activity" or "insecticidally effective", when referring to an ISP protein of the invention or its equivalents, as used herein, means the capacity of an ISP protein to kill insects above the levels found in control treatment under the same assay conditions, upon the ingestion of such protein by an insect, preferably a coleopteran insect, particularly a corn rootworm, especially Diabrotica virqifera, in combination with an ISP-complimentary protein, such as a second ISP protein.

"Insect-controlling amounts" of an ISP protein, as used herein, refers to an amount of ISP protein which is sufficient to limit damage on a plant by insects feeding on such plant to commercially acceptable levels, e.g. by killing the insects or by inhibiting the insect development or growth in such a manner that they provide less damage to a plant and plant yield is not significantly adversely affected, when such ISP protein is provided with an ISP-complimentary protein, such as another ISP protein, preferably the other protein encoded by the same operon as the first ISP, or an insecticidally effective fragment thereof. "Insecticidally-effective ISP fragment", as used herein, refers to a fragment of an ISP protein of this invention which retains insecticidal activity when provided in combination with an ISP-complimentary protein, such as another ISP protein, preferably the other ISP encoded by the same operon as the first ISP. In the above definitions related to insecticidal activity, the insect preferably is a larva in any of the larval stages. Throughout this application, reference can be made to an "isp. DNA and insecticidally-effective fragments or equivalents thereof, and in that case the insecticidal activity obviously refers to the activity of the protein encoded by the DNA and not to the insecticidal activity of the DNA itself.<br><br>
In accordance with this invention, the ISP proteins of this invention and their equivalents, particularly the mature ISP1A and ISP2A proteins, were found to have no significant insectlcidal activity to lepidopteran insects selected from the group consisting of: Heliothis virescens, Helicoverpa zea, Manduca sexta, Helicoverpa armiqera, Spodoptera littoralis. Spodoptera fruoiperda, Sesamia nonaqroides, and Ostrinia nubilalis.<br>
In accordance with this invention, target insects susceptible to the ISP proteins of the invention or their equivalents are contacted with these proteins in insect-controlling amounts, preferably insecticidal amounts, by expression in a transgenic plant of DNA sequences encoding such ISP proteins. Said target insects wilt only be affected by the insecticidal proteins when they ingest plant tissue. Thus, in another object of the present invention a method is provided for rendering plants insecticidal against Coleoptera and a method for controlling Coleoptera, comprising planting, sowing or growing in a field plants transformed with DNA sequences encoding the ISP proteins of the invention, particularly com plants.<br>
The signal peptide of the ISP proteins of the invention can be removed or modified according to procedures known in the art, see, e.g., published PCT patent application WO 96/10083, or they can be replaced by another peptide such as a chloroplast transit peptide (e.g., Van Den Broeck et al., 1985, Nature 313, 358, or preferably the modified chloroplast transit peptide of US patent 5, 510,471) causing transport of the protein to the chloroplasts, by a secretory signal peptide or a peptide targeting the protein to other plastids, mitochondria, the ER, or another organelle, or it can be replaced by a methionine amino acid or by a methionine-alanine dipeptide. Signal sequences for targeting to intracellular organelles or for secretion outside the plant cell or to the cell wall are found in naturally targeted or secreted proteins, preferably those described by Klosgen et al. {1989, Mol. Gen. Genet. 217, 155-161), Klosgen<br><br>
and Weil {1991, Mol. Gen. Genet. 225, 297-304), Neuhaus &amp; Rogers (1998, Plant Mol. Biol. 38, 127-144), Bih et al. (1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274, 22884-22894), Morris et al. (1999, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 255, 328-333), Hesse et al. (1989, EMBO J. 8 2453-2461), Tavladoraki et al. (1998, FEBS Lett. 426, 62-66), Terashima et al. (1999, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 52, 516-523), Park et al.

Sci USA 92, 9245-9249), all of which are incorporated herein by reference, particularly the signal peptide sequences from targeted or secreted proteins of corn. Although a DNA sequence encoding such a plant signal peptide can be inserted in the chimeric gene encoding the ISP1A and in the chimeric gene encoding the 1SP2A protein for expression in plants, in one embodiment of this invention, a DNA sequence encoding such a signal peptide is only inserted in the chimeric ISP2A gene and the ISP1A chimeric gene lacks a signal peptide, or has a methionine amino acid or a methionine-alanine dipeptide instead of the signal peptide. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the proteins are secreted from the roots as described by Gleba et al. (1999, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 25, 5973-5977) and Borisjuk et ai., 1999 (Nat. Biotechn. 17, 466-469), using a strong root-preferred promoter, particularly a strong root-preferred promoter from corn, and an N-terminal signal peptide for secretion from the root cells, preferably from corn, particularly the signal peptide of a secreted protein, preferably a com secreted protein, selected from the group of: expansin, alpha-amylase, poiyamine oxidase, cytokinin oxidase, endoxyianase.<br>
Plants included in the scope of this invention are corn, cotton, soybean, peas, beans, lentils, potato, tomato, tobacco, lettuce, Brassica species plants, sugarcane, rice, oilseed rape, mustard, asparagus, wheat, barley, coffee, tea, vines, rubber plant, beet, turf grasses, sorghum, oats, rye, onions, carrots, leek, cucumber, squash, melon, sunflower, particularly any plant which is susceptible to damage by coleopteran insects, preferably corn rootworm, potato beetles or weevils, particularly insects of the Diabrotica or Leptinotarsa species, most<br><br>
preferably any insect selected from the group consisting of: Diabrotica virqifera, Diabrotica barberi, Diabrotica undecimpuncata , Leptinotarsa decemiineata and Anthonomus qrandis, most preferably corn plants.<br>
"Corn", as used herein, refers to all plants of the species Zea mays, and any seeds, roots or grain, or other materials containing or directly produced from corn cells, of any variety of Zea mays, including but not limited to field corn, sweet corn, hybrid corn, white corn and dent corn, whether hybrid or inbred lines. Preferably, the corn plants used in this invention are suitable parent lines for producing hybrid corn, and most preferably they already carry an endogenous or transgenic insect-resistance giving them protection from the major corn lepidopteran insect pests including but not limited to Ostrinia nubilalis.<br>
The ISP1A and ISP2A proteins of this invention can be isolated in a conventional manner from the E. coli strain, deposited under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty on January 11, 2000 at the BCCM-LMBP (Belgian Coordinated Collections of Microorganisms -Laboratorium voor Moleculaire Biologie - Plasmidencollectie, University of Gent, K.L, Ledeganckstraat 35, B-9000 Gent, Belgium) under accession number LMBP 4009, or more preferably, they can be isolated from the supernatant of a Bacillus strain, preferably a crystal-minus Bacillus thuringiensis strain, transformed with a pfasmid containing the approximately 7 kb Xbal-EcoRI fragment of the plasmid pUCIB120/lSP as deposited under accession number LMBP 4009. The ISP proteins can be used to prepare specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies in a conventional manner (Hofte et al., 1988, Appl. Environm. Microbiol. 54, 2010). The iSP proteins can be treated with a protease such as cysteine proteases, to obtain the protease-resistant fragments of the ISP proteins.<br><br>
The DNA sequences encoding the ISP proteins can be isolated in a conventional manner from the deposited strain or can be synthesized based on the encoded amino acid sequence.<br>
DNA sequences encoding other ISP proteins in accordance with this invention can be identified by digesting total DNA from isolated bacteria! strains with restriction enzymes; size fractionating the DNA fragments, so produced, into DNA fractions of 5 to 10 Kb, preferably 7 to 10 Kb; tigating these fractions to cloning vectors; screening the E. cpjj, transformed with the cloning vectors, with a DNA probe that was constructed from a region of known ISP protein genes or with a DNA probe based on specific PCR fragments generated from isp, DNA using primers corresponding to certain regions within known ISP protein genes. Such "other ISP proteins" isolated in accordance with this invention, like the ISP proteins of this invention, are characterized by any or all, preferably all, of the following characteristics: a) their significant insecticidal activity to larvae of the Southern corn rootworm, Diabrotica undecimpunctata, and to larvae of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, upon ingestion of such other ISP protein with an ISP-complimentary protein, preferably the mature ISP1A or ISP2A protein of this invention; b) their lack of significant insecticidal activity to larvae of lepidopteran insects, preferably Ostrinia nubilaiis, upon ingestion of such other ISP protein with an ISP-complimentary protein, preferably the mature ISP1A or ISP2A proteins of this invention; c) their apparent molecular weight of about 100 kD or about 45 kD of the mature forms (without signal peptide), d) their occurrence in the supernatant of a bacterial strain culture which is not Bacillus thurinojensis or Bacillus cereus, and e) by their lack of significant toxicity to com rootworms, preferably Diabrotica virqifera, upon ingestion in the absence of an ISP complimentary protein.<br><br>
Of course, any other DNA sequence differing in its codon usage but encoding the same protein or a similar protein with substantially the same insecticida! activity, can be constructed, depending on the particular purpose. It has been described in some prokaryotic and eucaryotic expression systems that changing the codon usage to that of the host eel) is desired for gene expression in foreign hosts {Bennetzen &amp; Hall, 1982, J. Biol.-Chem. 257, 3026; Itakura, 1977, Science 198, 1056-1063). Codon usage tables are available in the literature (Wada et al., 1990, Nucl. Acids Res. 18, 2367-1411; Murray et at., 1989, Nucleic Acids Research 17, 477-498) and in the major DNA sequence databases. Accordingly, synthetic DNA sequences can be constructed so that the same or substantially the same proteins are produced. It is evident that several DNA sequences can be devised once the amino acid sequence of the ISP proteins of this invention is known. Such other DNA sequences include synthetic or semi-synthetic DNA sequences that have been changed in order to inactivate certain sites in the gene, e.g. by selectively inactivating certain cryptic regulatory or processing elements present in the native sequence, or by adapting the overall codon usage to that of a more related host organism, preferably that of the host organism in which expression is desired. Synthetic DNA sequences could also be made following the procedures described in EP 0 385 962, EP 0 618 967, or EP 0 682 115.<br>
Small modifications to a DNA sequence such as described above can be routinely made by PCR-mediated mutagenesis (Ho et al.,1989, Gene 77, 51-59; White et al., 1989, Trends in Genet. 5, 185-189). New synthetic or semi-synthetic genes can be made by automated DNA synthesis and ligation of the resulting DNA fragments.<br>
To prevent or delay the development of resistance by coleopteran insects, particularly corn rootworm, cotton boll weevil or Colorado potato beetle, preferably Leptinotarsa decemlineata,   Diabrotica   barberi.   Diabrotica  undecimpuncata.   Anthonomus   qrandis  or<br><br>
Diabrotica virqifera, to transgenic hosts, particularly plants, expressing ISP proteins of this invention or their equivalents, it is preferred to also express in the same host, preferably a transgenic plant, another protein or another protein complex, which has a different mode of action, and a high toxicity to the same insect targeted by the first toxin or toxin complex when produced in a transgenic host, preferably a plant. Suitable candidates to be combined with the ISP1A and ISP2A of the invention include the mature VIPIAa protein when combined with the mature VIP2Aa or VIP2Ab protein of PCT publication WO 96/10083 in case these ViP proteins have a different mode of action compared to the ISP proteins; the corn rootworm toxins of Photorhabdus or Xenorhabdus spp., e.g., the insecticidal proteins of Photorhabdus luminescens W-14 (Guo et ai, 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274, 9836-9842); the CryET70 protein of WO 00/26378; the insecticidal proteins produced by Bt strains PS80JJ1, PS149B1 and PS167H2 as described in WO 97/40162, particularly the about 14 kD and about 44 kD proteins of Bt strain PS149B1; the Cry3Bb protein of US patent 6,023,013; protease inhibitors such as the N2 and R1 cysteine proteinase inhibitors of soybean (Zhao et al., 1996, Plant Physiol. 111, 1299-1306) or oryzastatine such as rice cystatin (Genbank entry S49967), com cystatin (Genbank entries D38130, D10622, D63342) such as the corn cystatin expressed in plants as described by Irie et al. (1996, Plant Mol. Biol. 30, 149-157). Also included herein are all equivalents and variants, such as truncated proteins retaining insecticidal activity, of any of the above proteins.<br>
Such combined expression can be achieved by transformation of a plant already transformed to express a corn rootworm toxic protein or protein complex, or by crossing plants transformed to express different corn rootworm toxic proteins. Alternatively, expression of the ISP proteins of the invention can be induced in roots upon feeding of com rootworm larvae on root tissue, e.g., by using a wound-induced promoter region, preferably a wound-induced root-preferred promoter region.<br><br>
The 5 to 10, preferably 7 to10, Kb fragments, prepared from total DNA of the jsp. genes of the invention, can be ligated in suitable expression vectors and transformed in E. cpjj, and the clones can then be screened by conventional colony immunoprobing methods (French et aJ., 1986, AnaJ.Biochem. 156, 417-423) for expression of the toxin with monoclonal or poiyclonal antibodies raised against the ISP proteins. Also, the 5 to 10 Kb fragments, prepared from total DNA of the bacterial strains of the invention, can be ligated in suitable Bt shuttle vectors {Lereclus et al., 1992, Bio/Technology 10, 418) and transformed in a crystal minus Bt-mutant. The clones are then screened for production of ISP proteins (by SDS-PAGE, Western biot and/or insect assay).<br>
The genes encoding the ISP proteins of this invention can be sequenced in a conventional manner (Maxam and Gilbert, 1980, Methods in Enzymol. 65, 499-560; Sanger, 1977, Prac. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 5463-5467) to obtain the DNA sequence. Sequence comparisons indicated that the genes are different from previously described genes encoding proteins secreted during the vegetative growth phase of Bacillus or other bacterial species and Bacillus thuringiensis crystal proteins with activity against Coleoptera (Crickmore, et al., 1998, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews Vol 62: 807-813; WO 98/44137, WO 94/21795, WO 96/10083, WO 00/09697, WO 9957282, and WO 9746105).<br>
In order to express all or an insecticidally effective part of the DNA sequence encoding an ISP protein of this invention in E. coli, in other bacteriaf strains or in plants, suitable restriction sites can be introduced, flanking the DNA sequence. This can be done by site-directed mutagenesis, using well-known procedures (e.g., Stanssens et al., 1989, Nucleic Acids Research 12, 4441-4454; White et al., 1989, supra). For expression in plants, the isg DNA of the invention, or its equivalent, is usually contained in a chimeric gene, flanked by 5' and   3'   regulatory   sequences   including   a   plant-expressible   promoter   region   and   3'<br><br>
transcription termination and polyadenylation sequence active in plant cells. In order to obtain improved expression in plants, the codon usage of the isp DNA or its equivalent of this invention can be modified to form an equivalent, modified or artificial gene or gene part, or the isp DNA or insecticida!ly-effective parts thereof can be inserted in the chloroplast genome and expressed there using a chloropast-active promoter (e.g., Mc Bride et al., 199&amp;, Bio/Technology 13, 362), For obtaining enhanced expression in monocot plants such as corn, a monocot intron also can be added to the chimeric gene, and the isp DNA sequence or its jnseclicida) part can be further changed in a translation ally neutral manner, to modify possibly inhibiting DNA sequences present in the gene part by means of site-directed intron insertion and/or by introducing changes to the codon usage, e.g., adapting the codon usage to that most preferred by the specific plant {Murray et al., 1989, supra) without changing significantly the encoded amino acid sequence.<br>
The insecticidaliy effective isp DNA or its equivalent, preferably the jsp. chimeric gene, encoding an ISP protein, can be stably inserted in a conventional manner into the nuclear genome of a single plant cell, and the so-transformed plant cell can be used in a conventional manner to produce a transformed plant that is insect-resistant. In this regard, a disarmed Ti-plasmid, containing the insecticidaliy effective iso. gene part, in Aqrobacterium tumefaciens can be used to transform the plant cell, and thereafter, a transformed plant can be regenerated from the transformed plant cell using the procedures described, for example, in EP 0 116 718, EP 0 270 822, PCT publication WO 84/02913 and published European Patent application ("EP") 0 242 246 and in Gould et al. {1991, Plant Physiol. 95, 426^34). Preferred Ti-plasmid vectors each contain the insecticidaliy effective jsp chimeric gene sequence between the border sequences, or at least located to the left of the right border sequence, of the T-DNA of the Ti-plasmid. Of course, other types of vectors can be used to transform the plant cell, using procedures such as direct gene transfer (as described, for<br><br>
example in EP 0 233 247), pollen mediated transformation (as described, for example in EP 0 270 356, PCT publication WO 85/01856, and US Patent 4,684,611), plant RNA virus-mediated transformation (as described, for example in EP 0 067 553 and US Patent 4,407,956), liposome-mediated transformation (as described, for example in US Patent 4,536,475), and other methods such as the methods for transforming certain lines of corn (Fromm et al., 1990, BiorTechnology 8, 833-839; Gordon-Kamm et al., 1990, The Plant Cell 2, 603-618, US Patent 5,767,367) and rice (Shimamoto et al., 1989, Nature 338, 274-276; Datta et al., 1990, Bio/Technology 8, 736-740) and the recently described method for transforming monocots generally (PCT publication WO 92/09696).<br>
Different conventional procedures can be followed to obtain combined expression of two ISP proteins in transgenic plants as summarized below;<br>
I. Chimeric gene constructs whereby two ISP DNA sequences and a marker gene are transferred to the plant genome as a single piece of DNA and lead to the insertion in a single locus in the genome.<br>
la. The genes can be engineered in different transcriptional units each under control of a distinct promoter.<br>
To express two ISP proteins and a marker protein as separate transcriptional units, several promoter fragments directing expression in plant cells can be used as described above. All combinations of the promoters mentioned above in the chimaeric constructs for one ISP gene are possible. The ISP coding region in each chimeric gene of this invention can be the intact jsp_ gene or preferably an insecticidally-effective part of the intact jsp gene. The individual chimeric genes are cloned in the same plasmid vector according to standard procedures (e.g., EP 0 193 259).<br>
lb. Two genes (e.g., either an isg and a marker gene or two ]sg genes) or more can be combined in the same transcriptional unit.<br><br>
To express two isj&gt; genes in the same transcriptional unit, the following cases can be distinguished:<br>
In a first case, hybrid genes in which the coding region of one gene is fused in frame with the coding region of another gene can be placed under the control of a single promoter. Fusions can be made between either an isp_ and a marker gene or between two |sp_ genes.<br>
Also, between each gene encoding an ISP or an insecticidalfy-effective fragment thereof, a gene fragment encoding a protease {e.g., trypsin, cysteine or serine protease)-sensitive protein part could be included, such as a gene fragment encoding a part of the ISPs which is removed or cleaved upon activation by the midgut enzymes of the target insect species. Alternatively, between each gene encoding an ISP or an insecticidally-effective fragment thereof, a gene fragment can be included encoding a peptide of about 16-20 amino acids which has the capability to mediate cleavage at its own C-terminus by an enzyme-independent reaction (Halpin et al., 1999, Plant J. 17, 453-459, US Patent 5,846,767), or a gene fragment encoding a linker peptide sequence which allows the production of a recombinant cell with significant toxicity to the target insects.<br>
In a second case, the coding regions of the two respective isj) genes can be combined in dicistronic units placed under the control of a promoter. The coding regions of the two isp, genes are placed after each other with an intergenic sequence of defined length. A single messenger RNA molecule is generated, leading to the translation into two separate gene products. Based on a modified scanning model (Kozak, 1987, Mol. Cell. Biol. 7, 3438-3445), the concept of reinitiation of translation has been accepted provided that a termination codon in frame with the upstream ATG precedes the downstream ATG. Experimental data also<br><br>
demonstrated that the plant translatJonaJ machinery is able to synthesize several polypeptides from a polycistronic mRNA (Angenon et al, 1989, Mo!. Cell Biol. 9, 5676-5684).<br>
Based on the mechanism of internal initiation of translation (Jackson and Kaminski, 1995, RNA 1, 985-1000) initiation of translation of the second gene occurs by binding of the 433 pre-initiation complex to a specific intergenic sequence (internal ribosome entry sequence; IRES). Experimental data also demonstrated that the plant translational machinery is able to synthesije several polypeptides from a polycistronic mRNA containing intergenic IRES-elements (Hefferon et al., 1997, J Gen Virol 78, 3051-3059; Skulachev at al., 1999, Virology 263, 139-154; PCT patent publication WO 98/54342).<br>
II. A chimeric construct with one isp gene that is transferred to the genome of a plant already transformed with one isp. gene :<br>
Several genes can be introduced into a plant cell during sequential transformation steps (retransformation), provided that an alternative system to select transformants is available for the second round of transformation, or provided that the selectable marker gene is excised from the plant genome using DNA recombination technology (e.g., published PCT applications WO 94/17176 and WO 91/09957). This retransformation leads to the combined expression of isp. genes which are introduced at multiple loci in the genome. Preferably, two different selectable marker genes are used in the two consecutive transformation steps. The first marker is used for selection of transformed cells in the first transformation, while the second marker is used for selection of transformants in the second round of transformation. Sequential transformation steps using kanamycin and hygromycin have been described, for example by Sandler et al. (1988, Plant Mol. Biol. 11, 301-310) and Delauney et al. (1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 4300-4304).<br><br>
III.	Chimeric constructs with jsrj genes, that are separately transferred to the nuclear genome<br>
of separate plants in independent transformation events and are subsequently combined in a<br>
single planf genome through crosses.<br>
The first plant should be a plant transformed with a first jsp. gene or an F1 plant derived thereof through selfing (preferably an F1 plant which is homozygous for the isp_ gene). The second plant should be a plant transformed with a second jsp. gene or an F1 plant derived thereof through selfing (preferably an Ft plant which is homozygous for the second isg gene). Selection methods can be applied to the plants obtained from this cross in order to select those plants having the two jsrj genes present in their genome (e.g., Southern blotting) and expressing the two ISPs (e.g., separate ELISA detection of the immunologically different ISPs). This is a useful strategy to produce hybrid varieties from two parental lines, each transformed with a different isg gene, as we}) as to produce inbred lines containing two different [sp. genes through crossing of two independent transformants (or their F1 selfed offspring) from the same inbred line.<br>
IV.	Chimeric constructs with one or more isp_ genes separately transferred to the genome of<br>
a single plant in the same transformation experiment leading to the insertion of the<br>
respective chimeric genes at the same or at multiple loci.<br>
Cotransformation involves the simultaneous transformation of a plant with two different expression vectors, one containing a first isg gene, the second containing a second jsg gene. Along with each jsp gene, a different marker gene can be used, and selection can be made with the two markers simultaneously. Alternatively, a single marker can be used, and a sufficiently large number of selected plants can be screened in order to find those plants<br><br>
having the two isp. genes (e.g., by Southern blotting) ancf expressing the two proteins (e.g., by means of ELISA). Cotransformation with more than one T-DNA can be accomplished by using simultaneously two different strains of Agrobacterium, each with a different Ti-plasmid (Depicker et al., 1985, Mol. Gen. Genet. 201, 477-484) or with one strain of Agrobacterium containing two T-DNAs on separate plasmids (de Framond et al., 1986, Mol. Gen. Genet 202, 125-131). Direct gene transfer, using a mixture of two plasmids or fragments thereof, can also be employed to cotransform plant cells with a selectable and a non-selectable gene (Schocheretal., 1986, Bio/technology 4,1093-1096).<br>
The resulting transformed plant can be used in a conventional plant breeding scheme to produce more transformed  plants with the same characteristics or to introduce the insecticidally effective isp. gene in other varieties of the same or related plant species. Seeds, which are obtained from the transformed plants, contain the insecticidally effective isp gene as a stable genomic insert. Cells of the transformed plant can be cultured in a conventional manner to produce the insecticidally effective portion of the ISP protein which can be recovered for use in conventional insecticide compositions against insects.    Of course, the above possibilities of combined production of ISP proteins in plants is as well applicable to active fragments of the ISP proteins or the ISP equivalents of this invention. The insecticidally effective isp. gene is inserted in a plant cell genome so that the inserted gene is downstream (i.e., 3') of, and operably linked to, a promoter which can direct the expression of the gene part in the plant cell. This is preferably accomplished by inserting the isp chimeric gene in the plant cell genome, particularly in the nuclear or chloroplast genome. Preferred promoters inciude: the strong constitutive 35S promoters (the "35S promoters") of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaWV) of isolates CM 1841 (Gardner et al., 1981, Nucl. Acids Res. 9, 2871-2887), CabbB-S (Franck et al., 1980, Cell 21, 285-294) and CabbB-JI (Hull and Howell, 1987, Virology 86, 482-493); promoters from the ubiquitin family (e.g., the maize<br><br>
ubiquitin promoter of Christensen et al., 1992, Plant Mol. Biol. 18, 675-689; see also Cornejo et al., 1993, Plant Mol. Biol. 23, 567-581), the gos2 promoter (de Pater et al., 1992, Plant J. 2, 837-844), the emu promoter (Last et al., 1990, Theor. Appl. Genet. 81, 581-588), rice actin promoters such as the promoter described by Zhang et al. (1991, The Plant Cell 3, 1155-1165); and the TR1' promoter and the TR2' promoter (the "TRT promoter and "TR2 promoter", respectively) which drive the expression of the 1" and 2' genes, respectively, of the T-DNA (Veiten et al., 1984, EMBO J 3, 2723-2730). Alternatively, a promoter can be utilized which is not constitutive but rather is specific for one or more tissues or organs of the plant (e.g., leaves and/or roots) whereby the inserted isp_ gene is expressed only in cells of the specific tissue(s) or organ(s). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticidally effective jsj) gene is selectively expressed in the roots of a plant, preferably corn, by placing the insecticidally effective gene part under the control of a root-preferred promoter (i.e., a promoter which is most active in root tissue, preferably a promoter with no or little transcription in non-root tissue such as pollen, leaves and stem, more particularly a promoter only resulting in detectable transcription in root tissue). Root-preferred promoters need not be exclusively active in root tissue. Root-preferred promoters in accordance with this invention include but are not limited to: promoters located immediately upstream of a DNA sequence corresponding to a root-specific cDNA, preferably from corn; the promoter of US patent 5,837,876, published PCT patent applications WO 00/29594, WO 00/73474, WO 01/00833, or US Patent 6,008,436; the 2RP2 promoter of US Patent 5,633,363 and Held et al. (1997, Plant Mol. Biol. 35, 367-375, Genbank accession number U38790); the promoter of US Patent 5,817,502; the promoter described by de Framond (1991, FEBS 290: 103-106; EP 0 452 269), the root-specific promoter of the peroxidase gene POX1 from wheat (Hertig et al., 1991, Plant Molec. Biol. 16, 171-174), the promoter of US patent 5,837,848, the promoter of PCT publication WO 015662, the promoter of Goddemeier et al. (1998, Plant Mol. Biol. 36, 799-802).   Other root-specific or root-preferred promoters which may be useful in this invention<br><br>
include the promoters described by Hiret et a!., 1992, Plant Mol. Biol, 20, 207; Keller and Baumgartner, 1991, The Plant Cell 3, 1051-1061; Sanger et al., 1990, Plant Mol. Biol. 14,433-443; Miao et al., 1991, The Plant Cell 3,11-22; Bogusz et al., 1990, The Plant Cell, 2, 633-641*; Leach and Aoyagi, 1991, Plant Science 79, 69-76; Teeri et al., 1989, EMBO Journal 8, 343-350, alJ of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Expression in leaves of a plant can be achieved by using the promoter of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunii gene of the plant itself or of another plant such as pea as disclosed in US Patent 5,254,799. Another alternative is to use a promoter whose expression is inducible (e.g., by temperature or chemical factors). A/so, for corn plants, particularly at the time adult corn rootworms are present in corn rootworm fields, expression in pollen is preferred, by using promoter regions resulting in expression in corn pollen, e.g. the promoters described in published PCT applications WO 93/25695 and WO 01/12799.<br>
The insecticidally effective isp, gene is inserted in the plant genome so that the inserted gene part is upstream (i.e., 5') of suitable 3' end transcription regulation signals (i.e., transcript formation and polyadenylation signals).<br>
This is preferably accomplished by inserting the fsp_ chimeric gene in the plant cell genome. The choice of the 3' regulatory sequence in the chimeric gene of the invention is not critical. In some cases good expression can be obtained when no such region is present in the chimeric gene, since a DNA sequence at the insertion site can act as a 3' regulatory sequence. Preferred polyadenylation and transcript formation signals include those of the CaMV 35S (Mogen et al., 1990, The Plant Cell 2, 1261-1272), the octopine synthase gene {Gielen et al., 1984, EMBO J 3, 835-845), the nopaline synthase gene (Depicker et al., 1982,<br><br>
J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1, p. 561), and the T-DNA gene 7 (Velten and Schell, 1985, Nucleic Acids Research 13, 6981-6998), which act as 3'-utranslated DNA sequences in transformed plant cells.<br>
The insecticidally effective isp. gene can optionally be inserted in the plant genome as a hybrid gene (US Patent 5,254,799; Vaeck et al„ 1987, Nature 327, 33-37) under the control of the same promoter as a selectable marker gene, such as the neo gene (EP 0 242 236) encoding kanamycin resistance, so that the plant expresses a fusion protein.<br>
AH or part of the isp. gene, can also be used to transform other bacteria, such as a B. thurinqiensis strain which has insecticidal activity against Lepidoptera or Coleoptera, or root-colonizing bacteria, e.g. root-colonizing Pseudomonas outida (Vilchez et al., J. Bacterid. 182, 91-99). Thereby, a transformed bacterial strain can be produced which is useful for combatting insects and which can affect a wide spectrum of lepidopteran and coleopteran insect pests. Transformation of bacteria, such as bacteria of the genus Aqrobacterium, Bacillus or Escherichia, with all or part of the isp. gene of this invention or its equivalent, incorporated in a suitable cioning vehicle, can be carried out in a conventional manner, such as heat shock transformation (Bergmans et al., 1981, J. Bacterid 146, 564-570) or conventional electroporation techniques as described in Mahillon et al. (1989, FEMS Microbiol. Letters 60, 205-210) and in PCT Patent publication WO 90/06999.<br>
Transformed bacterial strains, such as Baciilus species strains, preferably Bacillus thurinqiensis strains, containing the isp. gene of this invention can be fermented by conventional methods (Dulmage, 1981, "Production of Bacteria for Biological Control of Insects" in Biological Control in Crop Production, Ed. Paparizas, D.C., Osmun Publishers, Totowa,   N.J.,   USA,   pp.   129-141;   Bernhard  and   Utz,   1993,   "Production  of  Bacillus<br><br>
thurinqiensis insecticides for experimental and commercial uses", In Bacillus thurinqjensis. An Environmental Biopesticide: Theory and Practice, pp.255-267, eds. Entwistle, P.F., Cory, J.S., Bailey, M.J. and Higgs, S., John Wiley and Sons, New York) to provide high yields of cells.<br>
An insecticidal, particularly anti-coleopteran, preferably anti-corn rootworm composition of this invention can be formulated in a conventional manner using the microorganisms transformed with the isp. gene, or preferably their respective ISP proteins or insecticidally effective portions thereof as an active ingredient, together with suitable carriers, diluents, emulsifiers and/or dispersants {e.g., as described by Bernhard and Utz, 1993, supra). This insecticide composition can be formulated as a wettable powder, pellets, granules or dust or as a liquid formulation with aqueous or non-aqueous solvents as a foam, gel, suspension, concentrate, etc. Known microorganisms include cells of Pseudomonas or other bacteria which serve to encapsulate the proteins in a stable environment prior to application to the insects. Also included in the invention is a product comprising the 1SP1A and ISP2A protein of the invention as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use to protect com plants against corn rootworms, particularly such product is an insecticidal composition or a transgenic corn plant.<br>
A method for controlling insects, particularly Coleoptera, in accordance with this invention can comprise applying (e.g., spraying), to a locus (area) to be protected, an insecticidal amount of the ISP proteins or host cells transformed with the isp. gene of this invention. The locus to be protected can include, for example, the habitat of the insect pests or growing vegetation or an area where vegetation is to be grown.<br><br>
To obtain the ISP protein, cells of the recombinant hosts expressing the ISP protein can be grown in a conventional manner on a suitable culture medium and the protein can then be obtained from the medium using conventional means. The ISP protein can then be separated and purified by standard techniques such as chromatography, extraction, electrophoresis, or the like. The protease-resistant toxin form can then be obtained by-protease, e.g. cysteine or serine protease, digestion of the protein.<br>
Bio-assays for testing the insecticidal efficacy are well known in the art. A method for corn rootworm testing is described in Marrone et al. (1985, J. Econ. Entomol. 78, 290-293), but many other methods are available to test insects on artificial diet or on transgenic plants, e.g. US Patent 5,990,383. In a suitable bio-assay the proper controls are included to check for background mortality.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Characterization of the IB120-A strain<br>
A bacterial strain, named herein the 1B120-A strain, was found in a field in the state of Morelos, Mexico.<br>
The strain was grown overnight on LB agar plates (LB medium with 1.5 % agar added; LB medium:10 g/l trypton, 10 g/l NaCl, 5 g/l yeast extract, pH 7.3) at 28DC. For small scale cultures, 20 m! TB medium (Terrific Broth: 12 g/l tryptone, 24 g/l yeast extract, 3.8 g/l KH2P04, 12.5 g/l K2HP04, 5 ml/1 glyceroi, pH 7.1) was inoculated and grown for 65 hours at 28°C on a<br><br>
rotating platform having about 70 rotations per minute. After 65 hours, a protease inhibitor mixture was added to the culture. This cocktail has the following ingredients (volumes given are those required to add to one 20 ml culture): 200ul PMSF (100mM), 200ul of a mixture of benzamidine.HCI (100mM) and epsilon-amino-n-caproic acid (500 mM), 400ul EGTA (0.5M), 40p[ antipain (0.5rng/ml) / leupeptin (0.5mg/ml) and 20pl beta-mercapto ethanol (14M). The culture medium to which the protease inhibitor mixture had been added, was then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. In some cases, the supernatant was concentrated about 4 times using Centriprep YM-10 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore Cat. No. 4305). For long term storage, a loop of sporulated cells was added to 0.5ml of 25% or 50% glycerol and after vortexing, stored at -7Q°C. Sporulated cells were obtained by growth of the strain on LB agar plates until sporulation (as apparent under the light microscope).<br>
After cultivating on LB agar plates of single cell colonies, microscopical analysis of the 1B120-A strain culture showed the presence of rod-shaped motile single vegetative cells and swollen sporangia containing an ovale spore. No parasporal crystals were detected in cultures of the IB120-A strain.<br>
Supernatant of the IB120-A strain showed strong toxicity to Diabrotica virpifera larvae (hereinafter termed "Dv") in surface contamination assays on artificial diet (diet as described by Sutter et al. (1971, J. Econ. Entomol. 64, 65-67)). The assays were done at 24 °C (+/- 1DC) in 24 multiwel! Costar plates at 50 microliter toxin solution per well (2cm2), 6 wells were analyzed with 4 L1 {first instar) larvae per well for each sample (scoring after 7 days).<br>
Screening of supernatant harvested at 7, 24, 30, 48 and 120 hours after initiation of the culture showed the strongest toxicity to Dv at 48 hours, with no significant toxicity found at 7 hours. At<br><br>
48 hours, mortality in the 50-60 % range was still found when the supernatant (at total protein concentration of 214 microgr/ml) was diluted at 1/1024.<br>
Loss of activity of IB120-A supernatant harvested 48, 65 and 144 hours after culture initiation (in dilutions of 1/1 to 1/8) upon heat treatment and retention of activity after ammonium sulphate precipitation indicated that the toxic compound is likely a protein.<br>
Preliminary characterization of the IB120-A strain by PCR primers for gyrase B genes {Yamada et al., 1999, Appl, Environm. Microbiol. 65, 1483-1490) suggested that it was not a Bacillus strain of the subspecies thurinqJensis, anthracis or cereus. Also, no amplification products were obtained using PCR primers specifically characterizing the 16S RNA sequences of the genus Paenibacillus which are also recognizing the species Bacillus lentimorbus and Bacillus pooilliae (Pettersson et a!., 1999, Int J Syst Bacteriol. 49(2), 531-540). Growth in NB (nutrient broth: 3 g/I bacto beef extract, 5 g/l bacto peptone, pH 6.8) medium indicated that the new strain was not a Bacillus larvae species. Thus, this IB120-A strain seems to be different from previously isolated Bacillus strains known to produce secreted insecticidal proteins which are not contained in crystals.<br>
Based on the rod-like shape and the aerobic growth, the strain could be a BaoKus species strain. With a set of general and specific primers for cry3 Bacillus thurinqJensis genes, no amplification products were found when analyzing strain IB120-A.<br>
Detailed analysis of the IB 120-A strain using standard microbial identification techniques, including fatty acid analysis and API 50CHB tests combined with API 20E tests, showed that this strain is a Brevibacillus laterosporus species strain.<br>
Example 2. Isolation and characterization of ispl and isp2 DNAs/proteins:<br><br>
In order to isolate the genes responsible for the toxicity of IB120-A, total DNA from this strain was prepared and partially digested with Sau3A. The digested DNA was size* fractionated on a sucrose gradient and fragments ranging from 7 kb to 10 kb were ligated to the 
Following the identification of a positive colony containing a piasmid harboring the full length isrj genes, the sequence of these genes was determined using the dye terminator labeling method and a Perkin Elmer ABI Prism-377 DNA sequencer. The sequences of the 2 open reading frames found in the cloned DNA fragment of a positive colony are shown in SEQ ID No. 1 and 3. These DNA sequences were found to be organized in an operon and encode novel proteins, ISP1A (SEQ ID No. 2) and ISP2A (SEQ ID No. 4) which have been found to be the causal agents of the high insecticidal activity observed. A positive colony containing the pUC-derived piasmid with the genes responsible for toxicity (in piasmid pUCIB120/ISP) has been deposited under the provisions of the Budapest treaty in E. coli XL1 Blue as LMBP 4009 on January 11, 2000.<br><br>
A plasmid preparation was made from the positive colony and this plasmid was cut using Xbal and EcoRI (resulting in an about 7 Kb fragment) and ligated in the shuttle vector pSL40 which had been cut using the same restriction enzymes. This yielded plasmid pSLIB120/iSP. The plasmid pSLIB120/ISP was then transferred into a crystal- minus B. thurinaiensls strain. Supernatant from this recombinant Bt strain was obtained as follows.<br>
The strain was grown overnight on LB agar plates containing erythromycin (20 ug/ml) at 28°C. For small scale cultures, 20 ml TB medium containing erythromycin (20 ug/ml) was inoculated and grown for 65 hours at 28°C on a rotating platform having about 70 rotations per minute. After 65 hours, a protease inhibitor mixture was added to the culture. This cocktail has the following ingredients (volumes given are those required to add to one 20 ml culture): 200ul PMSF (100mM), 200ul of a mixture of benzamidine.HCI (100mM) / epsilon-amino-n-caproic acid (500 mM), 400ul EGTA (0.5M), 40pl antipain (0.5 mg/ml) / leupeptin (0.5 mg/ml) and 20M' beta-mercapto ethanol (14M). The culture medium to which the protease inhibitor mixture had been added, was then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 3000 rpm. In some cases, the supernatant was concentrated about 4 times using centriprep YM-10 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Cat. No. 4305).<br>
Insecticidal activity of the supernatant at 48 hours after culture initiation of the recombinant Bt strain containing the pSLIB120/ISP plasmid using the Dv surface contamination assay described above, showed that the supernatant still had significant mortality in the 60 % range at a 1/1024 dilution, while control mortality (the controls included supernatant of the untransformed Bt strain) was 0 %. This shows that the isolated DNA encodes an insecticidal ingredient of the IB120-A strain, and upon transfer to another bacterium is also expressed and secreted in the culture medium. Analysis of toxicity of another independent Bt-crystal-minus strain transformed<br><br>
with the pSLIB120/ISP piasmid confirmed the high insecticida! activity of the supematants compared to that of the untransformed control.<br>
The LC50 value of the supernatant of the Bt strain expressing the two ISP proteins was found to be 3.5 ng/cm2 after 4 days using the above-described surface contamination assay with Dv larvae {based on total supernatant protein concentration}. Detailed analysis of the toxicity of supernatant produced by the recombinant Bt strain expressing the ISP1A and ISP2A proteins to selected coleopteran insects is reported in Table 1 below. The ISP proteins of the invention were found to have significant insecticidal activity to Western, Northern and Southern com rootworm larvae, and also to larvae of the Colorado potato beetle and the cotton boll weevil.<br>
The mature ISP1 and ISP2 proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity by ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by passage over different chromatographical columns. The chromatographical analysis suggest that the ISP1A and ISP2A proteins are present in the supernatant in equimolar ratio. The ISP1A protein was found to be of rather hydrophobic nature, while ISP2A was of rather hydrophilic nature. Amino-terminal sequence determination of the mature ISP1A and ISP2A proteins produced in the recombinant crystal-minus Bt strain showed that amino acid position 38 in SEQ ID No. 2 for ISP1A and amino acid position 51 in SEQ ID No. 4 for ISP2A are the N-terminal amino acids of the active proteins present in supernatant of such transformed Bt strain. The N-terminus for ISP1A was found to be IATTTQASKD, that for ISP2A was found to be LVKTTNNTED, which matches fully with the amino acid sequence of the DNA sequences isolated.<br>
The apparent molecular weight of the pure mature ISP1A protein was determined to be about 100 kD in 8% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, that of the pure mature ISP2A protein was determined to be about 45 kD protein in 10 % SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, using molecular weight markers of 37,50,75,100, and 150 kD.<br><br>
The activity of the mature ISP1A and ISP2A proteins as produced by the recombinant strain was evaluated against several insects. The results against selected coleopteran insects are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>

In the assays reported in Table 1, controls (untreated food, food supplied with supernatant of a non-transformed Bt-crystal-minus strain or with water) did not show any mortality above 20 % for any of the above insects (a variation from 5 to 20 % control mortality was found according to larval stage and insect species (the 20 % value is for the third larval stage of Dv)).<br>
The LC50 values obtained for Diabrotica virgifera larvae using the bio-assay as described above, when an equimolar combination of ISP1A and ISP2A protein was applied after purification of these proteins from the supernatans of the recombinant Bt strain, were not significantly different from those obtained above.<br>
Bio-assays of a mixture of the mature ISP1A and ISP2A protein in standard surface contamination assays against selected lepidopteran insects (Ostrinia nubilialis, Heliothis virescens, Helicoverpa zea, Spodoptera frugiperda. Sesamia nonagrioides, Spodoptera littoralis, Helicoverpa armiqera, and Manduca sexta^ showed that the ISP proteins of this invention do not cause any mortality in these insects above control levels. This evidences the coleopteran-specific nature of the proteins of this invention. Preliminary bio-assays with two aphid species also showed that a mixture of the ISP1A and ISP2A proteins did not cause any significant mortality in these insects.<br>
To determine which fragment of the jsp_ genes are sufficient to encode an ISP protein complex toxic to Diabrotica larvae, a series of C-terminally truncated ISP proteins were made by inserting a stopcodon in the ORF of the jsp_ genes at different positions (and thus making<br><br>
different 3' gene truncations). The stopcodons were inserted at random positions using the Genome Priming System (GPS, New England Biolabs, catalog #7100). Using this system, a 1.7 kb transposon (containing stopcodons in all three reading frames and 2 sequences complementary to specific primers) is inserted randomly but only once in the 'target' DNA. The position of the insertion, and therefore, the truncation can then be estimated by PCR screening using a gene-specific primer and a transposon-specific primer or can be precisely determined by sequencing. A set of constructs with a transposon at different positions in one of the |sp. genes was then transformed individually in a crystal minus Bt strain and the susceptibility of Western corn rootworm larvae to the supernatant of each recombinant Bt strain was tested using the assay described above.<br>
For truncation of the isp2 gene, a fragment containing the gene was cut out of pSUB120/ISP using BstBI and Pmil. Following the GPS reaction, this fragment was then ligated into the pSLIB120/ISP vector, cut with the same enzymes. Recombinant E. coli colonies were PCR-screened in order to estimate the position of the transposon insertion site. A set of 10 clones with the transposon at different positions in the second half (3' half) of the isp2 gene was selected. Plasmid DNA of these clones was transformed in a dcm and dam methylase negative E. coli strain GM2163. Plasmid DNA isolated from this strain was then transformed in a crystal-minus Bt strain. Supernatant was prepared and bioassayed, using supernatant from the Bt strain transformed with pSLIB120/ISP as a positive control and supernatant from the crystal-minus Bt strain as a negative control. For truncation of the ispl gene, a fragment was cut out of pSL!B120/ISP using Pmll and EcoRI. The same methodology was followed as for the truncation of the jsp2 gene.<br>
The results of the transposon insertion analysis indicate that truncation of relatively large segments of the isp2A gene at the 3' end abolishes toxicity, indicating that no or only a<br><br>
relatively short C-termina! truncation is allowed in the ISP2A protein. After sequencing, the smallest C-terminally truncated ISP2A toxin fragment retaining toxicity in this study when tested in combination with the ISP1A protein was found to end at amino acid position 449 in SEQ ID No. 4.<br>
The results of these analyses indicate that a larger truncation of the ISP1A protein at the 3' end Is possible: sequence determination showed that the toxic fragment with the largest C-terminal truncation ended at amino acid position 763 in SEQ ID No. 2. Thus, approximately 300 bp of the ISP1A coding region can be deleted at the 3' side without losing toxicity.<br>
The above study also indicates that insecticidal activity is reduced to the background level when no functional ISP1A is produced, confirming the binary nature of the ISP proteins of this invention.<br>
The ISP2A protein from amino acid position 51 to amino acid position 449 in SEQ ID No. 4 and the ISP1A protein from amino acid position 38 to amino acid position 768 in SEQ ID No. 2 are thus useful insecticidal fragments of the ISP proteins.<br>
Furthermore, a chimeric gene containing a DNA fusion of the ISP1A and ISP2A genes was expressed in a crystal-minus Bacilius thurinqiensis berliner 1715 strain, A DNA sequence encoding an Arg-Lys-!inker (RKRKRK) or a DNA sequence encoding a Gly-linker (GGGGGG) was provided between the open reading frames encoding the ISP2A and the ISP1A proteins (ISP2A stili has its N-termina! signal peptide present, while ISP1A lacks its signal peptide), so that a translational fusion protein is produced; i.e. a fusion protein in which the speficied linker connects the ISP2A protein (as the N-terminal fusion partner) to the ISP1A protein (as the C-terminal fusion partner}.   The recombinant Bt strain proved to cause mortality to Diabrotica<br><br>
virqifera which was significantly higher then that of the untransformed control strain (i.e., the crystal-minus Bt 1715 strain). This shows the possibility of producing the ISP proteins of the invention as a fusion protein in a recombinant host cell by using a single chimeric gene. Obviously, as explained in the description of the invention, multiple different approaches can be used to achieve the production of a fusion protein in the recombinant cell, e.g. cells of a plant.<br>
Example 3: production of ISP proteins in plants:<br>
To obtain optimal expression in plants, the isplA and isp2A native DNA sequences are modified to produce modified DNA sequences encoding the ISP1A and ISP2A proteins. The optimized DNA sequences encoding the ISP1A-1 and ISP2A-1 proteins with their signal peptides replaced by a methionine and alanine amino acid are shown in SEQ ID No. 9 and 7, respectively.<br>
These coding regions are inserted in a chimeric gene operably linked to suitable regulatory sequences, e.g., a promoter based on the short or long zrp2 promoter sequences of SEQ ID No. 5 or 6 using standard techniques, and appropriate 3' transcription termination and polyadenyiation sequences. In some constructs, the above chimeric genes contain a DNA sequence encoding the optimized chloroplast transit peptide (in place of the N-terminal bacterial signal peptide) as described in US Patent 5,510,471 {or Reissued US Patent RE 036449) resulting in targeting to the plastids or a signal peptide causing targeting to the cell wait. Other signal peptides effective in plant cells can similarly be used, preferably the signal peptide encoded by the alpha-amylase 3 gene of rice (Sutliff etal., 1991, Plant Molec. Biol. 16, 579-591), the signal peptide encoded by the ferredoxin NADP+ oxidoreductase gene from spinach (Oelmueller et al., 1993, Mol. Gen. Genet. 237, 261-272), or the signal peptide<br><br>
encoded by the proteinase inhibitor II gene of potato (Keil et at., 1986, Nucl. Acids Res. 14, 5641-5650).<br>
Corn cells are stably transformed with the above isplA and isp2A chimeric genes using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (Ishida etal., 1996, Nature Biotechnology 14, 745-750; and U.S. Patent No. 5,591,616), protoplast transformation as described in US patent 5,792,936, or by electroporation using wounded and enzyme-degraded embryogenic callus, as described in WO 92/09696 or US Patent 5,641,664 (ail of these above references are incorporated herein by reference). Corn plants are regenerated from the transformed cells and are selected for optimal expression levels in roots and for adequate overall agronomic characteristics. The thus obtained transgenic com plants producing the above ISP proteins of the invention cause significant mortality to Diabrotica virqifera larvae attempting to feed on such plants.<br>
In accordance with this invention, stably transformed corn plants are also obtained containing several DNA constructs, so that the corn plant can express one or both the ISP proteins of the invention in its cells under control of the suitable regulatory control regions, together with an appropriate marker gene, preferably a herbicide resistance gene. In these DNA constructs, a preferred 3' transcription termination and poiyadenylation sequence is a 215 bp fragment containing the 3' transcription termination and poiyadenylation sequences obtained from Cauliflower Mosaic virus (Oka et at., 1981, J. Mol. Biol. 147,217-226). In some constructs, a 5' untranslated leader sequence can be added, preferably those chosen from the leader sequences of a cab22 gene from Petunia (Harpster etal., 1988, Mol. Gen Genetics 212,182-190} or the zrp2 gene (Held et al, 1997, Plant Molecular Biology 35, 367-375, Genbank accession number U38790). Preferred promoters in the constructs are promoter-effective parts of the 35S promoter (e.g., Odell et al., 1985, Nature 313, 810-812) or zrp2 promoters (Held et al, 1997, Plant Molecular Biology 35, 367-375, Genbank accession number U38790). The<br><br>
constructs can also contain a signal peptide effective in plant cells besides the above optimized chloroplast transit peptide, namely the signal peptide of the alpha-amylase 3 gene of rice (Sutliff etal., 1991, Plant Molec. Biol. 16,579-591), the signal peptide of the ferredoxin NADP+ oxidoreductase from spinach (Oelmuelleretal., 1993, Mol. Gen. Genet. 237, 261-272), or the signal peptide from the proteinase inhibitor II of potato (Keil et al., 1986, Nucl. Acids Res. 14, 5641-5650). Transformations of plants with the ISP chimeric genes using a selection from the above preferred elements using techniques available to the person of ordinary skill in the art can be used to achieve the desired goal of the invention.<br>
Preferably the plants also contain a gene encoding a protein conferring resistance to glufosinate or glyphosate, for which a different promoter and/or leader sequence is used, e.g. the gos2 promoter and/or the gos2 leader (de Pater et al., 1992, Plant J. 2, 837-844).<br>
Needless to say, this invention is not limited to the above com plants, transformation methods nor to the particular ISP proteins or DNA sequences used. Rather, the invention also includes any variant or equivalent of the ISP protein retaining insecticidal activity, such as a protein having substantially the amino acid sequence of the ISP proteins of the invention and having substantially the insecticidal activity of the ISP proteins. Also, any plant which is susceptible to damage by coleopteran insects, particularly corn rootworms, weevils or potato beetles, especially Diabrotica virqifera or Leptinotarsa decemlineata, preferably an insect selected from the group consisting of: Agelastica alni, Hypera postica.
