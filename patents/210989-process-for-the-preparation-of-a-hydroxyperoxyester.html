				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a hydroxyhydroperoxide which can be used in particular in polymerizations, such as the polymerization of vinyl chloride, or in the thermosetting of polyester resins.<br>
Numerous documents of the prior art mention the preparation of peroxyesters :<br>
-	European  Patent  Application  No.  .667 ...339_, which<br>
relates  to unsaturated peroxides and to polymers<br>
obtained using these peroxides;<br>
-	European  Patent  Application  No.  126  216_, which<br>
relates  to  hydroxy-t-alkyl  peroxyesters  having<br>
10-hour half-life temperatures of less than 75°C;<br>
-	United States Patent No. 3 624 124, which relates to<br>
tertiary hydroperoxide and tertiary alkyl peresters;<br>
-	European  Patent  Application  No.  381  135,  which<br>
discloses hydroxyperoxides having 10-hour half-life<br>
temperatures of between 85 and 100°C; and<br>
-	European  Patent  Application  No.  474 227,  which<br>
relates  to  functionalized  peroxides  intended  for<br>
polymerization reactions.<br>
However, in all these documents, the peroxyesters are prepared in the presence of a solvent and sometimes of a phase transfer catalyst.<br>
During the preparation of peroxyesters having a hydroxyl group in the y position with respect to the O-O peroxide functional group, problems of decanting, that is to say of poor separation of the organic phase and of the aqueous phase, may be encountered.<br>
To overcome these problems, use is then made of a solvent which makes it possible to accelerate the phenomenon of<br>
decanting; however, this solvent poses an additional problem: part of it remains in the peroxyester, which is a nuisance during the use of the peroxyester because of the subsequent presence of solvent in the polymer.<br>
Another solution consists in patiently waiting for the decanting to take place unaided, which can take several days.<br>
It has now been discovered that it is possible to obtain rapid decanting without having recourse to a solvent.<br>
A subject-matter of the invention is therefore a process for the preparation of a peroxyester comprising the reaction of a hydroxyhydroperoxide salt with an acid halide or an acid anhydride, in which:<br>
-	the molar ratio Rb of the hydroxyhydroperoxide<br>
corresponding to the hydroxyhydroperoxide salt to<br>
the  acid halide  is  between  0.5  and  1.5;  or.<br>
alternatively the molar ratio Rb' of the hydroxy-<br>
hydroperoxide  corresponding  to  the  hydroxy-<br>
hydroperoxide  salt  to  the  acid  anhydride  is<br>
between 1.0 and 3.0;<br>
-	the  hydroxyhydroperoxide  salt  was  prepared<br>
beforehand  by  reaction  of  the  corresponding<br>
hydroxyhydroperoxide with a base according to a<br>
molar  ratio Ra of  the  base  to  the  hydroxy-<br>
hydroperoxide of between 0.5 and 1.5; and<br>
-	this process is carried out in aqueous media.<br>
Such a process therefore offers the following advantages:<br>
-	the reaction of the hydroperoxide salt with the<br>
acid halide or anhydride can now be carried out in<br>
the  absence  of  organic   solvent  and,   if<br>
appropriate, of phase transfer catalyst;<br>
-	the decanting takes place rapidly, which, first,<br>
makes possible a saving in time and, secondly,<br>
avoids the need to store certain rather unstable peroxyesters in low-temperature storage areas;<br>
-	the peroxyester obtained is devoid of any solvent;<br>
any   subsequent   stage   of   evaporation   or<br>
distillation of the solvent is thus avoided, which<br>
improves the yield;<br>
-	the  purity  of  the  peroxyester  obtained  is<br>
satisfactory;<br>
-	the absence of solvent additionally eliminates the<br>
risk of introducing, into the peroxyester or the<br>
final product, possible impurities present in the<br>
solvent;<br>
-	the peroxyester can be used as obtained, that is<br>
to say without subsequent purification,  without<br>
the  occurrence,  for  example,  during  use  in<br>
polymerization reactions, of side reactions, such<br>
as transfer reactions, or problems of colour or<br>
smell of the polymer obtained.<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention is an aqueous emulsion comprising at least one peroxyester obtained by the process according to the invention.<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention is a polymerization process employing a radical initiator comprising at least one peroxyester obtained by the process according to the invention.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will become apparent on reading the description which follows and which is illustrated by examples.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The preparation process according to the invention can therefore be carried out in the aqueous phase.<br>
It can comprise a preliminary stage of preparation of the hydroperoxide salt by reaction of a hydroperoxide with a base .<br>
Thus, the synthesis of the peroxyester can be illustrated by the following reaction scheme :<br>
Stage a) :    ' ROOH + base → ROOM<br>
Stage b)<br>
R  C( O ) X or '(R ' CO ) 20  + ROOM ; → R ' - C ( O ) - O- O-R<br>
in which :	<br>
ROOH is a hydroperoxide; ROOM is a salt of the hydroperoxide; R'C(O)X is an acid halide; (R'CO)2O is an acid anhydride.<br>
One advantage of the process according to the invention is that stage b) can be carried out in the reactor which has been used to carry out stage a) .<br>
Stage a)<br>
The starting hydroperoxide ROOH can be any hydroperoxide.<br>
It is preferably a hydroxyhydroperoxide .<br>
Use is in particular made, as hydroxyhydroperoxides, of those in which the hydroxyl group is situated in the 3 position with respect to the hydroperoxy group.<br>
In addition, it is preferable to use hydroxy (tert iary-alkyl) hydroperoxides .<br>
Mention may be made, as examples of such compounds, of those corresponding to the following general formula :<br>
HO-C(R3) (R4)-CH2-C(R1) (R2) -OOH<br>
in which :<br>
R1 and R2 are,  independently of one another,  an<br>
alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>
R3 and R4 are,  independently of one another,  a<br>
hydrogen or an alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms;<br>
R1 and R3 can be connected to one another via an<br>
alkylene bridge having 3 carbon atoms, this bridge<br>
optionally being substituted by an alkyl having from<br>
1 to 4 carbon atoms; and R3 can additionally be a -<br>
CH2-C(R1) (R2)-OOH group, R1 and R2 being as defined<br>
above.<br>
Mention may be made, as hydroxy(t-alkyl) hydroperoxides, of 3-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylpropyl, 3-hydroxy-1,1-dimethyl-butyl, l-ethyl-3-hydroxy-l-methylpentyl, 1,l-diethyl-3-hydroxybutyl and 5-hydroxy-1,3,3-trimethylcyclohexyl hydroperoxides.<br>
According to the invention, the preferred hydroxy-hydroperoxides are hexylene glycol hydroperoxides, in particular 3-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylbutyl hydroperoxide.<br>
These hydroxy(t-alkyl)  hydroperoxides can be prepared by treating the corresponding hydroxy (t-alcohols) with an excess of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a highly acidic catalyst, such as sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, perchloric acid or p-toluenesulphonic acid.<br>
For example, hexylene glycol hydroperoxide can be prepared in this way from commercial hexylene glycol according to the teachings of United States Patent No. 3 36 872.<br>
The hydroxy(t-alcohols) can in their turn be prepared in a known way.<br>
Use may be made, as base for stage a) of the process, of inorganic bases, such as NaOH, KOH, LiOH, Na2C03, K2CO3, NaHCO3, KHCO3, Ca(OH)2, Ba(OH)2, CaC03 or Na3PO4, or alternatively of organic bases, such as amines, for example pyridine, N, N-dimethylaniline, 4-(N,N-dimethyl-amino)pyridine, triethylamine, tributylamine, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.3.0]undec-7-ene, urea and tetramethyl-urea.<br>
Use is preferably made of a base, in particular potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide is the preferred base.<br>
The molar ratio Ra of the base to the hydroperoxide is generally between 0.5 and 1.5.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, the molar ratio Ra is between 0.9 and 1.3, preferably between 1.00 and 1.22 and in particular between 1.10 and 1.19.<br>
Stage a) is generally carried out at a temperature of 20-25°C, the hydroxyhydroperoxide generally being reacted as is (in the substantially pure state and without prior dissolution in an organic solvent), gradually, with stirring, with the organic base, the latter optionally being in the form of an aqueous solution.<br>
The reaction mixture is then generally kept stirred for a few minutes in order to bring the formation of the hydroxyhydroperoxide salt to completion.<br>
Stage b)<br>
This stage is carried out between the hydroperoxide salt obtained on completion of stage a) and either an acid anhydride or an acid halide.<br>
The acid anhydride can be chosen from the group consisting of the anhydrides of 2-methoxypropionic, isobutyric, tert-butyric, pivalic, 2,2-dimethylbutyric, 2-ethylbutyric, hexanoic, neohexanoic, benzoic, heptanoic, neoheptanoic, 2-ethylhexanoic, octanoic, neooctanoic, 2-phenoxypropanoic, 2-phenylpropanoic, nonanoic, isononanoic, neononanoic, 2-methyl-2-phenyl-propionic, 2-phenylbutyric, decanoic, neodecanoic, dodecanoic, 2-butyloctanoic, neododecanoic, undecanoic, neotridecanoic, methacrylic, methylcrotonic and 2-methyl-2-butenoic acids.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, stage b) is carried out with an acid halide.<br>
This acid halide generally has, as empirical formula, the formula R'COX, in which :<br>
-	R' corresponds to one of the following formulae :<br>
R5R6R7C-     and      R9CH=CR8-<br>
in which :<br>
R5 is a hydrogen or an alkyl having from 1 to 8<br>
carbon atoms;<br>
R6 is an alkyl having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms;<br>
R7 is an alkyl having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, an<br>
alkenyl having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms, an aryl<br>
having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, an alkoxy having<br>
from 1 to  6 carbon atoms or an aryloxy having from<br>
6 to 10 carbon atoms;<br>
R8 and R9 are,  independently of one another,  an<br>
alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and<br>
-	X is a halogen.<br>
Use may thus be made, as acid halides, of 2-methoxy-propionyl, isobutyroyl, tert-butyroyl, pivaloyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyroyl, 2-ethylbutyroyl, hexanoyl, neohexanoyl, benzoyl, heptanoyl, neoheptanoyl, 2-ethyl-hexanoyl,octanoyle, neooctanoyl, 2-phenoxypropanoyl, 2-phenylpropanoyl, nonanoyl, isononanoyl, neononanoyl, 2-methyl-2-phenylpropionyl, 2-phenylbutyroyl, decanoyl, neodecanoyl, dodecanoyl, 2-butyloctanoyl, neododecanoyl, undecanoyl, neotridecanoyl, methacryloyl, methyl-crotonoyl and 2-methyl-2-butenoyl halides.<br>
Preferably, the halogen X is a chlorine atom.<br>
According to the invention, the most advantageous acid halide is neodecanoyl chloride with the empirical formula t-C9H19-COCl.<br>
The acid chlorides can be prepared in a known way, for example from the corresponding acids, by reaction with chlorinating agents, such as PC13, POC13, PC15, SOC12, phosgene (in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide) or trichlorobenzene, and then by separation of the acid chloride from the reaction medium.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the molar ratio Rb of the hydroperoxide (corresponding to the hydroperoxide salt) to the acid halide is between 0.9 and 1.2, preferably between 1.00 and 1.17 and in particular between 1.10 and 1.16.<br>
In stage b), the acid anhydride or halide can be added as is (that is to say, without prior dissolution in an organic solvent) to the salt obtained on completion of stage a) , for example over 5 to 60 minutes, preferably over 10 to 20 minutes, and generally with stirring. The temperature of the beginning of addition is from 15 to 25°C and preferably from 18 to 23°C.<br>
The addition is generally fairly exothermic and there is generally a change from a temperature of 20°C to 30°C. Subsequently, the reaction temperature is generally maintained between 20 and 40°C and preferably between 25 and 35°C. Such ranges of reaction temperatures are<br>
generally sufficient to produce good reaction kinetics without causing the peroxyester formed to decompose. The reaction time is generally from 10 to 90 minutes and preferably from 20 to 40 minutes.<br>
The reaction medium is subsequently treated generally at ambient temperature.<br>
Various additional stages can be implemented.<br>
A first washing with water is carried out and the aqueous phase is separated from the organic phase and is then removed from the medium. Another washing with a 3% aqueous potassium hydroxide (or sodium hydroxide) solution is carried out and the aqueous phase is separated from the organic phase and is then removed from the medium.<br>
A phase transfer catalyst can optionally be used to facilitate the separation of the phases.<br>
The peroxyester, which is the predominant constituent of the organic phase, is thus obtained.<br>
The organic phase can subsequently be quantitatively determined by an iodometric method to determine the peroxyester content. The water content can also be approximately measured by addition of heptane to the organic phase and then more accurately by a Karl-Fischer method.<br>
Uses<br>
Peroxyesters and in particular 1,l-dimethyl-3-hydroxybutyl peroxyneodecanoate have numerous applications in industry.<br>
They can participate, in particular, in polymerization reactions, for example in the polymerization of vinyl chloride, or in the thermosetting of polyester resins.<br>

The automatically-controlled heating/cooling system is subsequently adjusted to 30°C and the reaction mass is stirred for 30 minutes at 30°C at a stirring rate of 250 revolutions per minute.<br>
Treatment is then carried out with 2 g of 50% hydrogen peroxide and the reaction medium is stirred at 30°C for 15 minutes.<br>
The automatically-controlled heating/cooling system is subsequently adjusted to 20°C, 24.4 g of water are added and the reaction medium is left standing for 5 minutes, which makes it possible to remove the aqueous phase from the medium. The medium is subsequently washed with 64.9 g of a 3% aqueous KOH solution at a stirring rate of 280 revolutions per minute for 5 minutes.<br>
After separating the phases and removing the aqueous phase, 44.9 g of an organic phase are obtained.<br>
An iodometric analysis makes it possible to measure a peroxyester purity of 78.2%; the product comprises approximately 8.9% of water, which leads to a product purity of 85.9% (water not being regarded as an impurity). The yield, based on neodecanoyl chloride, is 72.2%.<br>
Example 3 (comparative)<br>
A 250 ml jacketed reactor, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer and connected to an automatically-controlled heating/cooling system, is charged with 65 g of a 30% aqueous KOH solution.<br>

The automatically-controlled heating/cooling system is subsequently adjusted to 30°C and the reaction mass is stirred for 30 minutes at 30°C at a stirring rate of 250 revolutions per minute.<br>
The automatically-controlled heating/cooling system is subsequently adjusted to 20°C, 24.5 g of water are added and the reaction medium is left standing for 5 minutes, which makes it possible to remove the aqueous phase from the medium. The medium is subsequently washed with 64.6 g of a 3% aqueous KOH solution at a stirring rate of 280 revolutions per minute for 5 minutes.<br>
