				<td>METHOD OF MIXING AND PURIFYING LANDFILL LEACHATE OF HOUSEHOLD<br>
WASTE AND SUPERNATANT WATER OF FOOD WASTE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an efficient and economical purification<br>
method by which landfill leachate of household waste containing high concentration<br>
nitrogen and supernatant water produced in a treatment process of food waste are<br>
mixed and treated.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, unlike ordinary household sewage having an almost constant<br>
characteristic of water quality, the characteristic of water quality of leachate<br>
produced in a landfill of household waste appears in a variety of forms according to<br>
the type and amount of filling waste, the shape of the landfill, the method of<br>
reclamation, the amount of rainfall, climate conditions, and the degree of hardening,<br>
in particular, with the passage of the reclamation period, organic materials gradually<br>
decrease, thereby changing the non-biodegradable state in which it is difficult for<br>
biodegradation to happen, while nitrogen increases. Accordingly, the leachate<br>
becomes waste water which is very difficult to be treated in a single treatment<br>
process.<br>
In relation to a method of purifying the landfill leachate of household waste, a<br>
method of using microorganisms for effective treatment of high concentration<br>
nitrogen included in the leachate is generally used. In order to use the nitrogen<br>
treatment by microorganisms, the concentration ratio of organic materials to total<br>
nitrogen (biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)/T-N) should be maintained at least 3 ~<br>
5. However, in the case of landfill leachate of household waste which is over three<br>
years old, the concentration ratio is mostly equal to or less than 1, which is very low,<br>
and a large amount of an organic carbon source should be provided in order to<br>
perform an appropriate nitrogen treatment. However, since methanol which is<br>
generally used as an organic carbon source is expensive, the overall treatment cost<br>
of leachate increases. Also, in the early stage up to 1 or 2 years after reclamation<br>
begins, the BOD/COD ratio indicating the possibility of biological treatment<br>
(degradation by microorganisms) is maintained to be equal to or greater than 0.4,<br>
and the concentration of organic materials shows its maximum value. Here, COD is<br>
chemical oxygen demand. Accordingly, the state is appropriate for being treated by<br>
microorganisms. However, with the passage of time since the reclamation, the<br>
concentration of nitrogen increases due to ammonia nitrogen produced in the<br>
degradation process of household waste, while the concentration of organic<br>
materials decreases instead due to natural degradation reaction in the landfill itself.<br>
In terms of the structure of the whole organic materials, the share of organic<br>
materials that can be biologically treated decreases, while the share of recalcitrant<br>
organic materials increases. Accordingly, normal nitrogen treatment by<br>
microorganisms is made to be difficult as a whole.<br>
As a technology for solving these problems, a technology for removing<br>
nitrified nitrogen by using an organic carbon source included in waste water inflowing<br>
into a sump has been disclosed in Korean Patent No. 432645. However, only with<br>
the organic carbon source in waste water, organic materials (BOD) are not enough,<br>
and therefore nitrogen cannot be sufficiently removed. Also, a technology for<br>
introducing methanol as an external carbon source in order to supplement an<br>
organic carbon source which is not enough in the waste water, has been disclosed in<br>
Korean Patent No. 436043, but as described above, all amounts of methanol are<br>
depending on import at present and the price is also expensive, mainly causing the<br>
overall leachate treatment cost to rise.<br>
Accordingly, methods of using waste terephthalic acid (TPA), and sugar<br>
manufacturing wastewater that can replace expensive methanol as an external<br>
carbon source for removing nitrogen included in leachate by using microorganisms<br>
have been studied. However, the waste TPA is in a solid form and in order to use<br>
this as an external carbon source, a separate storage and solution apparatuses are<br>
required, and in addition, when it is solved, an increase in pH through inputting a<br>
predetermined amount of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is required. Also, since the<br>
sugar manufacturing wastewater is generated in a small volume, and therefore it is<br>
difficult to provide it stably. In addition, installation of a separate supplying facility is<br>
required and inputting of the sugar manufacturing wastewater causes color to<br>
increase. Meanwhile, in supernatant water of food waste, the concentration of<br>
organic materials is very high as illustrated in table 1, including a BOD of 100,000<br>
mg/L, a COD of 150,000 mg/L, a T-N (total nitrogen) of 3,000 mg/L, and solid<br>
materials of 150,000 mg/L, and the degree of contamination degree is very high<br>
compared to the landfill leachate of household waste.<br>
Table 1<br>
Comparison for characteristics of the quality of water between supernatant water of<br>
food waste and landfill leachate of household waste<br><br>
The supernatant water of food waste is analyzed as a mixture of supernatant<br>
water produced in a liquid storing pit, primary and secondary dewatering filtrates,<br>
and supernatant water produced in centrifugal concentrator.<br>
If the conventional biological treatment methods such as an anaerobic<br>
digestion method and an activated sludge method, which are used to treat livestock<br>
wastewater, excretions and leachate, are used as a method of treating the<br>
supernatant water of food waste, it is difficult to maintain appropriate breeding<br>
conditions for bacteria which is aerobic microorganisms and aerobic nitrification<br>
bacteria such as nitrosomonas and nitrobacter, as well as anaerobic digestion<br>
bacteria such as acid ferment bacteria and methanogens due to the excessive<br>
amount of inflowing load. Also, a problem that due to solid materials of up to 150,000<br>
mg/L it is difficult to maintain the oxygen concentration of 3 ~ 5 mg/L required for<br>
treating aerobic microorganisms has been pointed out. In addition, the biological<br>
treatment such as anaerobic digestion and activated sludge, non-biodegradable<br>
COD of equal to or greater than 3,000 mg/L and color of equal to or over 1,000<br>
degree remain, thereby requiring a separate chemicophysical treatment such as<br>
chemical condensation, oxidation, activated carbon adsorption, and reverse osmosis.<br>
Accordingly, it is very difficult to treat leachate produced from food waste solely with<br>
the conventional treatment method. As a result, most of the supernatant water of<br>
food waste is disposed at sea, and when the amount of the supernatant water is<br>
small, it is also treated on land by using a treatment method such as evaporation<br>
condensation.<br>
However, in relation to the disposal of the supernatant water at sea, contamination of<br>
the sea has been pointed out and regulations against it have been increasingly<br>
strengthened. Also, when the supernatant water is treated on land, it requires an<br>
excessive treatment cost of 200,000 ~ 300,000 Korean won per ton.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an improved method of mixing and purifying<br>
landfill leachate of household waste and supernatant water of food waste in which,<br>
by mixing and treating landfill leachate of household waste and supernatant water of<br>
food waste, the cost of using methanol occurring in a treatment process of leachate<br>
can be reduced, and sea contamination by disposal of supernatant water at sea can<br>
be prevented.<br>
More specifically, the supernatant water of food waste which is used as an<br>
organic carbon source replacing methanol in the present invention has a very low<br>
harmful material content such as heavy metals, while containing affluent organic<br>
materials that facilitate biological degradation and being in a liquid state similar to<br>
that of the leachate produced in a landfill of household waste.<br>
Accordingly, in a process for purifying landfill leachate of household waste,<br>
the supernatant water can be used directly as an externa! carbon source without<br>
requiring a separate preprocessing facility, thereby enabling a high efficiency of<br>
leachate treatment with a low cost.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of mixing and purifying<br>
landfill leachate of household waste and supernatant water of food waste with a low<br>
cost and high efficiency, in which supernatant water of food waste which has high<br>
concentration organic materials, and being in a liquid state similar to that of landfill<br>
leachate of household waste, does not require a separate preprocessing facility, is<br>
directly utilized, thereby reducing a preprocessing cost, and at the same time, by<br>
using high concentration organic materials contained in the leachate instead of<br>
methanol as an external carbon source, the expensive treatment cost of leachate<br>
occurring when only the leachate is treated is greatly reduced.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of mixing and purifying landfill<br>
leachate of household waste and supernatant water of food waste in which, by<br>
enabling supernatant water of food waste, which is difficult to treat on land due to the<br>
high concentration and is disposed at seas because of high expense occurring when<br>
it is treated on land, to be treated on land with a low cost, sea contamination due to<br>
disposal of the supernatant water of food waste at sea can be solved in addition to<br>
cost reduction effect.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of<br>
mixing and purifying landfill leachate of household waste and supernatant water of<br>
food waste, the method comprising: a mixing process for mixing and treating<br>
leachate produced in a landfill of household waste which is five years old or over in<br>
which the content of organic materials that can be degraded by microorganisms is<br>
very low (equal to or less than BOD, COD 500 mg/L) and supernatant water<br>
produced in a treatment process of food waste containing 150,000 mg/L or over<br>
COD, suspended solids, and nitrogen of 3,000 mg/L or over to a level appropriate for<br>
nitrogen treatment; an anaerobic digestion process for digestion of the mixed<br>
leachate and supernatant water to a level appropriate for denitrification and/or<br>
nitrification; a denitrification and/or nitrification process for removing nitrogen by<br>
using remaining organic materials through an anaerobic digestion process; a<br>
chemical coagulation process for clotting, precipitating and removing<br>
non-biodegradable organic materials remaining in the treated water from the<br>
denitrification and/or nitrification process, which are difficult to biologically degrade,<br>
by adding ferric sulfate which is a coagulation factor and an anion polymer coagulant<br>
which is a coagulating support agent; an oxidation coagulation process for removing<br>
remaining organic materials and color of the treated water from the chemical<br>
coagulation process, by adding ferric sulfate, hydrogen peroxide and powdered<br>
activated carbon at the same time.<br>
And, in the above purifying method, before the oxidation coagulation process,<br>
the chemical coagulation process using the ferric sulfate is executed, thereby<br>
effectively removing non-biodegradable organic materials and color, and by<br>
replacing ferrous sulfate, which is conventionally used as a catalyst in order to<br>
increase reaction of oxygenated water which is an oxidizing agent, with ferric sulfate,<br>
the treatment efficiency in the COD and color is maintained to be similar to that<br>
achieved when ferrous sulfate is used, while improving precipitation of sludge,<br>
thereby lowering the concentration of suspended solids in the treated water. Also,<br>
the suspended solids, COD, and color of the treated water can be greatly reduced by<br>
inputting powdered activated carbon.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are<br>
shown.<br>
The attached drawings illustrate embodiments of a method of purifying landfill<br>
leachate of household waste according to the present invention. FIG. 1 is a<br>
diagram illustrating a whole process, including a sump mixing process, an anaerobic<br>
digestion process, denitrification and/or nitrification process, a chemical coagulation<br>
process, and an oxidation coagulation process.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, supernatant water produced in a process of treating<br>
food waste is made to be collected in a mixing sump (5) from supernatant water<br>
storing tank (1), and leachate produced in a landfill of household waste is made to be<br>
collected in the mixing sump (5) through an extraction pipe (3) and a transportation<br>
pipe (4), thereby performing a leachate mixing process mixing the collected water.<br>
That is, performance of the process for mixing the high concentration supernatant<br>
water of food waste and the leachate produced in the landfill of household waste<br>
which is five years old or over, and performance of anaerobic digestion process (6)<br>
can be referred to significant features of the present invention.<br>
In particular, the landfill leachate of household waste having a high content of<br>
non-biodegradable organic materials and nitrogen, and supernatant water of food<br>
waste which is relatively easier to biologically degrade and has a high content of<br>
organic materials and a low content of nitrogen, are mixed in a ratio of 1 to 0.8 ~ 1.2,<br>
and through a series of processes for anaerobic digestion treatment, the<br>
concentration ratio of organic materials to nitrogen (BOD)/NH4+ -N) is adjusted to be<br>
maintained at a ratio of 4.5 ~ 5.5 to 1. Accordingly, even without inputting an<br>
expensive external carbon source such as methanol that should be separately input<br>
when the denitrification and/or nitrification process (7) is performed by conventional<br>
method, the nitrogen treatment purpose through a denitrification and/or nitrification<br>
process can be achieved.<br>
The anaerobic denitrification and/or nitrification process will now be explained<br>
in more detail.<br>
The anaerobic digestion process (6) is a treatment process in which organic<br>
materials contained in the mixed water of the leachate and the supernatant water<br>
inflowing into a digestion tank are made to be digested and degraded by anaerobic<br>
microorganisms consisted of acid formers and methanogens under an anaerobic<br>
condition. The acid formers composed of Clostridium, peptococcus, anaerobus, etc,<br>
first degrade organic materials, thereby generating organic acid and alcohol such as<br>
butyric acid, lactic acid and acetic acid, and the generated organic acid and acetic<br>
acid are finally degraded into CH4 and CO2 by methanogens.<br>
In a more specific operating method of the anaerobic digestion tank, first, the<br>
supernatant water which is mixed with leachate in a ratio of 1 to 0.8 ~ 1.2 is input to<br>
the digestion tank and then, a digestion process is performed for 10 days at an<br>
intermediate digestion temperature range of 32 ~ 38°C. Through this process, 60 ~<br>
70% of organic materials contained in the supernatant water are removed, and<br>
organic nitrogen in the form of protein included in the supernatant water is changed<br>
to ammonia nitrogen (NH/ -N), thereby adjusting the density ratio of organic<br>
materials and nitrogen (BOD/ NH4+ -N) to be maintained at the ratio of 4.5 ~ 5.5 to 1<br>
that is an appropriate level for denitrification and/or nitrification which is a backend<br>
process.<br>
The denitrification and/or nitrification process 7 is a process in which the<br>
leachate inflowing into a denitrification tank in the form of ammonia nitrogen is first<br>
inflowing into a nitrification tank installed at the back, thereby being oxidized to be<br>
nitrate nitrogen, and the nitrate nitrogen is returned to the denitrification tank installed<br>
in front, and discharged as nitrogen gas into the air by denitrifying bacteria, thereby<br>
being removed. In a biological nitrification process, ammonia nitrogen is oxidized to<br>
be nitrate nitrogen by nitrifying bacteria consisted of nitrosomonas and nitrobacter.<br>
- NH4+ + 1.502 -+ 2H+ + H2O + NO2 + 58 ~ 84 Kcal ? Nitrosomonas<br>
- NO2" + 0.5O2 ? NO3 + 15-21 Kcal ? Nitrobacter<br>
Also, the biological denitrification is a process in which NO2- and NO3- which<br>
are generated in the nitrification process are used as electron acceptors instead of<br>
oxygen in an anaerobic state and finally deoxidized to N2, N2O or NO, and<br>
discharged into the air.<br>
When a carbon source exists, denitrification reactions occur as follows:<br>
- NO3- + 1 /3 CH3OH ? NO2- + 1 /3 CO2 + 2/3H2O<br>
• NO2- + 1/2 CH3OH ? N2 + 1/2 CO2 + 1/2 H2O + OH-<br>
- NO3- + 5/6 CH3OH ? 1/2 N2 + 5/6CO2 + 7/6H2O + OH'<br>
Here, the amount of methanol required for reducing 1 g of NO3-N is approximately<br>
1.9g(2.869gCOD).<br>
However, in the above process according to the present invention, without<br>
separate input of methanol, the mixed water of the supernatant water and the<br>
leachate which is treated in the previous anaerobic digestion process so that the<br>
concentration ratio of organic materials and nitrogen (BOD/NH/ -N) can be<br>
maintained to be a ratio of 4.5 ~ 5.5 to 1 is made to inflow. This is the main<br>
characteristic of this process, and through this process constructed as will be<br>
explained later, up to an average of 90% of nitrogen can be removed.<br>
More specifically, in this process, a denitrification and/or nitrification reactor is<br>
composed entirely of seven reactors, including two denitrification reactors (7-1) and<br>
five nitrification reactors (7-2). In the denitrification and/or nitrification reactor, a<br>
constant amount of the microorganism concentration of about 8,000 ~ 12,000 mg/L<br>
should always be maintained, and therefore recirculation from the nitrification reactor<br>
to the denitrification reactor is required. That is, recirculation of the microorganisms<br>
condensed in the precipitation reactor (7-3) is referred to as an external return, and<br>
the external return ratio is made to be 100 ~ 200% of the amount of water inflowing<br>
into the denitrification and/or nitrification reactor in order to prevent excessive<br>
surface water loading of the precipitation reactor. Recirculation performed from the<br>
nitrification reactor (7-2) to the denitrification reactor (7-1) is referred to as an internal<br>
return, and the internal return ratio is made to 700 ~ 900% of the amount of water<br>
inflowing into the denitrification and/or nitrification reactor by considering the<br>
installment capacity of pumps for return, and a maximum denitrification rate.<br>
The denitrification and/or nitrification process is the most important main<br>
treatment process in the present process, and in order to maintain a constant<br>
nitrification rate and a constant denitrification rate, an optimum state of<br>
microorganisms resident in the reactors should always be maintained. For this<br>
purpose, it is important to install a variety of microorganism breeding conditions to an<br>
appropriate level. First, the water temperature which is the most important in the<br>
breeding of the microorganisms living in the denitrification and/or nitrification reactor<br>
should be made to not exceed a maximum of 43°C in summer which is the limit for<br>
growing of denitrification and/or nitrification microorganisms, and should always be<br>
maintained at equal to or higher than a minimum of 25°C in winter. In order to<br>
maintain the appropriate water temperatures, the denitrification reactor and the<br>
nitrification reactor are installed as concrete structures, and on the top part of each of<br>
the structures, an opening part which can open and close by about 5% of a cover<br>
area is installed. When the water temperature rises in summer, the opening part is<br>
opened, and in winter the opening part is closed. In this way, the water temperature<br>
is adjusted so that an appropriate water temperature can always be maintained.<br>
Also, the depth of water of the reactor is made to be 6.5 ~ 7.5 m. The reactor is<br>
installed so that about 5 ~ 6 m of the depth is positioned underground and a height<br>
margin between the water surface and the cover is maintained to be in a range of 1.5<br>
~ 2.0 m or higher so that lowering of water temperature in winter can be prevented.<br>
In the denitrification reactor, by installing only a water mixer, an anaerobic condition<br>
of the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) of equal to or less than 0.5 mg/L is<br>
maintained, thereby facilitating reduction of nitrate nitrogen to nitrogen gas (N2 or<br>
N2O). In the nitrification reactor, sufficient oxygen is provided and in order to<br>
facilitate contact between microorganisms and pollutants a mechanical agitator and<br>
a diffuser for providing air are installed together so that the concentration of DO can<br>
be maintained at 3 ~ 5 mg/L.<br>
The treated water from the denitrification and/or nitrification process is made to<br>
sequentially inflow into a chemical coagulation process.<br>
The chemical coagulation process (8) is a process for treating recalcitrant<br>
organic materials remaining in the treated water from the denitrification and/or<br>
nitrification process, color and suspended solids. In order to maintain an optimum<br>
coagulation condition of reaction pH 5.0 ~ 5.5, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) is added, and at<br>
the same time ferric sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3) which is a coagulation factor is input in which<br>
the input amount is 300 ~ 350 mgFe3+/L relative to iron (HI) ion (Fe3+). Then, for<br>
about 15-25 minutes, a rapid stirring process at about 150 rpm is performed. In<br>
the treated water in which ferric sulfate which is the coagulation factor is mixed, 5 ~<br>
15 mg/L of an anion polymer coagulant which is a coagulating support agent is input<br>
and a slow stirring process at about 50 rpm is performed for about 6 ~ 14 minutes.<br>
The reaction water in which ferric sulfate and polymer coagulant are mixed is<br>
precipitated for 2 hours, and then, the precipitating sludge is dehydrated, and the top<br>
level water (treated water positioned on the top part) is made to inflow into the<br>
oxidation coagulation process in a natural flowing method.<br>
The oxidation coagulation process (9) is a process for removing<br>
non-biodegradable organic materials and color remaining in the treated water from<br>
the chemical coagulation process. By inputting ferric sulfate and hydrogen peroxide<br>
at the same time into the treated water from the chemical coagulation process, the<br>
reaction pH is made to be maintained in a range of 3 ~ 4, and for 3 ~ 4 hours, a rapid<br>
stirring process at about 150 rpm is performed. In this case, ferric sulfate is input with<br>
a concentration of 200 ~ 300 mgFe3+/L relative to iron(m) ion (Fe3+) and hydrogen<br>
peroxide is input with a concentration of 50 ~ 70 mgH2O2/L, thereby inducing<br>
oxidation. Also, 200 ~ 300 mg/L of powder activated carbon (F equal to or less<br>
than 0.1 mm) is input into the rapid reactor in which ferric sulfate and hydrogen<br>
peroxide are input, thereby increasing reaction and sludge precipitation. After the<br>
reaction process is performed, a neutralization process is performed by using<br>
sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in order to maintain a range of 6 ~ 7pH, and about 5-15<br>
mg/L of a polymer coagulant (anion polymer) which is an anion cogulating support<br>
agent is input in the slow stirring process at about 50 rpm, in order to facilitate<br>
precipitation of sludge. In this way, by inputting powder activated carbon together,<br>
the suspended solids are reduced to 5 ~7 mg/L, which is a 50 ~ 70% decrease, COD<br>
is reduced to 50 ~ 60 mg/L which is a 50 ~ 60% decrease and color is reduced to 10<br>
~ 20 degrees, which is an 80 ~ 90 % decrease. By sufficiently increasing the<br>
oxidation coagulating reaction time which is about 30 minutes according to the<br>
conventional method, up to 3 ~ 4 hours, the negative effects (floating of precipitated<br>
sludge, increasing organic materials in the treated water, etc.) by remaining<br>
hydrogen peroxide occurring in the conventional oxidation coagulating reaction<br>
process is minimized. Through the present process, the precipitating sludge is<br>
dehydrated through a condensation process, and the top level water (treated water<br>
positioned on the top part) is discharged through a final water treatment tank.<br>
As illustrated in table 2 below, according to the result of treating wastewater<br>
which is obtained by mixing leachate and supernatant water of food waste containing<br>
high concentration non-biodegradable organic materials and nitrogen, by using the<br>
process of the present invention, the treatment efficiency of non-biodegradable<br>
organic materials is 99.5% and the treatment efficiency of nitrogen is 95.5%. Both<br>
figures are very high, indicating that the present invention has a high treatment<br>
efficiency compared to the conventional leachate purifying methods using methanol<br>
as an organic carbon source.<br><br>
The method of analyzing the BOD, CODcr and T-N is based on the Method of<br>
Environmental Pollution Process Experiment by the Ministry of Environment.<br>
When leachate of a household waste landfill and supernatant water of food<br>
waste which contains high concentration non-biodegradable organic materials and<br>
nitrogen and is mainly disposed at sea because of high cost for treatment on land,<br>
thereby becoming a major cause of sea contamination, are treated, the present<br>
invention mixes the two types of high concentration wastewater, thereby achieving a<br>
high efficiency treatment with a low cost.<br>
More specifically, since supernatant water of food waste is in a liquid state<br>
similar to that of leachate, and can be directly utilized as an external carbon source<br>
in a process for purifying leachate of a household waste landfill without a separate<br>
preprocessing facility, if the present invention is employed, the cost required for the<br>
preprocessing can be saved.<br>
Also, according to the conventional technology, methanol which is expensive<br>
is separately input as an organic carbon source in order to treat high concentration<br>
nitrogen. However, in the present invention, all the methanol is replaced by<br>
supernatant water of food waste, and the supernatant water is mixed with leachate<br>
and treated. In this way, the cost for treating leachate can be greatly reduced,<br>
thereby achieving a high treatment efficiency for leachate with a low cost. The<br>
reduction in the treatment cost achieved by the present invention is about 25,200<br>
Korean won per ton when it is calculated as a net reduction cost, as illustrated in<br>
table 3 below.<br>
When the amount of supernatant water of food waste occurring within the country is<br>
considered (about 5,000 tons/day), the cost is estimated to be about 45 billion won<br>
per year.<br>
Also, according to the present invention, before the oxidation coagulation<br>
process, the chemical coagulation process using the ferric sulfate is executed,<br>
thereby effectively removing non-biodegradable organic materials and color, and by<br>
replacing ferrous sulfate, which is conventionally used as a catalyst in order to<br>
increase reaction of hydrogen peroxide which is an oxidizing agent, with ferric sulfate,<br>
precipitation of sludge is improved and the concentration of suspended solids in the<br>
treated water is lowered to 20 ~ 30 % (2~3 mg/L), and the treatment efficiency of<br>
the COD and color is 50 ~ 60 % similar to that achieved when ferrous sulfate is used.<br>
Also, by inputting powder activated carbon in the chemical coagulation process, the<br>
suspended solids, COD and color are greatly reduced.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention enables supernatant water of food waste,<br>
which has been disposed at sea because of high concentration and high cost<br>
preventing treatment on land, to be treated on land with a low cost, thereby reducing<br>
the cost of treatment and at the same time solving the sea contamination problem.<br>
