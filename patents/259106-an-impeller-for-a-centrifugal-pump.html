				<td>IMPROVED VELOCITY PROFILE IMPELLER VANE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention: This invention relates to pump impellers<br>
and specifically relates to an impeller having vanes particularly configured<br>
to selectively determine the velocity profile of the impeller to thereby<br>
selectively modify the wear of the purnp casing when processing slurries.<br>
Description of Related Art: Rotodynamie pumps are used-in-a<br>
variety of industries to process liquids and slurries. The type of fluid<br>
being processed dictates the type and configuration of the pump that is<br>
used in the particular application. That is, pumping clear liquid places<br>
less demand on pumps than does the processing of slurries, which<br>
contain an amount of solids or particulate matter that is abrasive and<br>
degrading to the internal structures of the pump.<br>
Therefore, pump designers and engineers must consider the type<br>
of fluid or slurry that is going to be processed and select or design an<br>
impeller and pump casing that is most suitable to the application. For<br>
example, in the processing of clear liquids (e.g., water), it is typical that<br>
the pump casing is a volute, the shape of which changes in cross<br>
sectional area from the cutwater of the pump to near the outlet of the<br>
pump, and comparatively little wear is observed in the pump casing.<br>
In the processing of slurries however, pump designers must<br>
consider the effect of hydraulic surface geometry not only from the point<br>
of optimizing pump efficiency, but also from the standpoint of minimizing<br>
wear in the pump casing. Thus, it has been typical in slurry pump design<br>
to modify the general volute shape of clear liquid-processing pumps to<br>
provide, for example, wider impeller outlets and casings with parallel<br>
sides.<br>
Another factor that determines wear on the pump casing is the<br>
shape of the impeller vanes. Specifically, the outer edge of the vanes of<br>
the impeller have been demonstrated to significantly effect the flow<br>
velocity of fluid moving through the pump. It has been observed that the<br>
typical vane configuration having a straight outer edge, at or near the<br>
periphery of the shroud, produces a certain fluid velocity that leads to<br>
wear on the pump casing along the sides of the volute.<br>
Thus, it would be advantageous in the art to provide an impeller<br>
having vanes that are specifically designed or configured to produce a<br>
more even wear pattern thus extending the overall wear life of the pump<br>
casing when processing slurries, particularly those with high solids<br>
content and/or particularly abrasive solids content.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an impeller is provided<br>
having at least one vane that is particularly shaped at the outer terminal<br>
end thereof to produce flow velocities that are less deleterious to wear on<br>
the pump casing when processing slurries. The vane configurations of<br>
the present invention are adaptable for use in any rotodynamic pump<br>
which employs an impeller, but is described and illustrated herein in<br>
connection with use in a centrifugal slurry pump.<br>
The impeller of the present invention comprises at least one vane<br>
which extends from at or near a center point of the i mpeller,<br>
corresponding to the central axis of the pump, and extends radially<br>
outwardly toward the peripheral edge of the impeller where the vane has<br>
a defined outer terminal end. The impeller of the present invention may<br>
have a single shroud (generally known as a semi-open impeller), two<br>
shrouds (generally known as a closed impeller) or may have no shroud<br>
(generally known as an open impeller). The invention is described<br>
herein, however, as having at least one shroud, which is positioned for<br>
orientation toward the drive side of the pump casingi (i.e., opposite the<br>
inlet of the pump).<br>
The outer terminal end of the vanes of the present invention are<br>
configured with a radially outwardly extending portion that generally<br>
defines a convex-like edge of the vane. As used h&amp;rein, the term<br>
"convex" is not meant to be limited to the conventional definition of a<br>
curved surface, but is meant only to convey that the outer terminal edge<br>
of the vane extends radially outwardly relative to the center axis of the<br>
impeller, rather than being straight or curved radially inwardly toward the<br>
center axis of the impeller; however, the outer terminal edge may be any<br>
shape, including but not limited to hemispherical, curvilinear, or<br>
comprised of two or more intersecting lines.<br>
The convex-like outer terminal end of the vanes of the present<br>
invention generally produces a fluid velocity profile that reduces wear on<br>
the inside surface of the pump casing. The shape of the convex-like<br>
outer-terminal end of the vanes may be^particularly selected to specifically<br>
modify or determine the fluid velocity profile so that, given a particular<br>
type of slurry being processed, the wear on the pump casing can be<br>
controlled and reduced.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates representationally a conventional centrifugal<br>
pump 10 comprising an impeller 12 and a pump casing 14. An inlet 16 is<br>
provided through the pump casing 14, which delivers incoming fluid to the<br>
impeller 12. The pump casing 14 that is depicted in FIG. 1 is a volutetype<br>
casing which extends from a cutwater 18 to a discharge 20. As<br>
indicated by the arrows positioned within the pump casing 14 in FIG. 1,<br>
and as further illustrated in the cross section view of FIG. 2, it can be<br>
seen that the cross section area of the pump volute typically increases<br>
from the cutwater 18 of the pump 10 toward the discharge 20 of the pump<br>
As depicted in FIG. 2, as the impeller 12 is rotated by the drive<br>
shaft 22, fluid entering the inlet 16 moves into the impeller 12 and is<br>
expelled outwardly into the volute 24 of the pump casing 14. The<br>
expelled fluid is further moved along the volute 24 of the pump casing 14<br>
from the cutwater 18 to the discharge 20 and encounters a progressively<br>
larger cross sectional area of the pump casing 14, as depicted in FIG. 2.<br>
As further shown representationally in FIG. 1, the impeller 12 of a<br>
conventional pump has at least one vane 30, and usually a plural ity of<br>
vanes 30, which radiates outwardly from a point at or near the center 32<br>
of the impeller 12. As shown more clearly in FIG. 3, for example, the<br>
impeller 12 may have a shroud 34, which is generally formed as a<br>
flattened disk having a center point 32 corresponding to the center axis of<br>
the pump. The vanes 30 extend outwardly from at or near the center 32<br>
of the shroud 34 toward the peripheral edge 36 of the shroud 34 where<br>
the vane 30 terminates. Each vane 30 has a leading face 38 against<br>
which the incoming fluid impacts as the fluid is expelled radially outwardly<br>
toward the volute 24 of the pump casing 14 (FIG. 2).<br>
Again referring to FIGrSrthe-outer terminal end~40 of each vane<br>
30 defines an edge 42, as shown in cross sectional view taken at line Y<br>
through the vane 30. FIG. 3 depicts a first conventional configuration for<br>
a vane 30 which has a straight edge at the outer terminal end 40 of the<br>
vane 30. The straight outer edge 42 of this conventional type of vane 30<br>
is generally co-terminus with the peripheral edge 36 of the shroud 34, as<br>
shown.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates another conventional configuration of an impeller<br>
vane 30 where the outer edge 44 of the outer terminal end 40 of the vane<br>
30 is concave, as illustrated in the cross section view taken at line X<br>
through the vane 30. That is, the outer edge 44 curves inwardly toward<br>
the center point 32 of the shroud 34 and the center 46 of the outer edge<br>
44 is not co-terminus with the peripheral edge 36 of the shroud 34.<br>
It has been demonstrated that the shape of the terminal end of the<br>
vane effects the flow velocity of fluid exiting the impeller, and thereby<br>
effects the type or pattern of wear that may be experienced in the pump<br>
casing when processing slurries. As depicted in FIG. 5, for example, it<br>
has been shown that a conventional vane having a straight outer edge 42<br>
produces a flow velocity profile where fluid is expelled at a higher velocity<br>
at or near the axial sides 48, 50 of the vane than from the center of the<br>
vane between the axial sides 48, 50. Consequently, a wear pattern in the<br>
pump casing occurs on either side of the volute in a spiral-type pattern.<br>
As demonstrated in FIG. 6, the flow velocity profile produced by a<br>
conventional vane having a concave outer edge 44 is similar to the flow<br>
velocity profile produced by a vane having a straight outer edge 42,<br>
except that a double spike of flow velocity occurs, or is produced, at the<br>
axial ends of the vane. Consequently, a double spiral wear pattern is<br>
observed along the volute of the pump casing when processing slurries<br>
through the pump. In both conventional vane configurations shown in<br>
FIGS. 5 and 6, relatively less wear occurs at the center of the volute of<br>
the pump.<br>
In view of the foregoing, it would be advantageous to provide a<br>
vane configuration having an outer terminal end that is suitably shaped to<br>
produce a-flow velocity profile that results-in-more-controlled and reduced<br>
wear in the volute of the pump casing compared to conventionally known<br>
impeller vanes. The inventors have discovered that a vane 60 having a<br>
generally convex-like outer edge 62, as illustrated, for example, in FIG. 7,<br>
produces a flow velocity profile where the velocities are more evenly<br>
distributed across the volute of the pump casing, thereby resulting in<br>
more even wear of the internal casing surface than what would normally<br>
occur with conventional vane configurations.<br>
FIG. 8 more clearly illustrates that, in general, the impeller vane 60<br>
of the present invention has an outer terminal end 64 defining an outer<br>
terminal edge 62 that is convex-like in shape in that the outer edge 62<br>
includes a radially outwardly extending portion 66 that extends beyond<br>
the peripheral edge 36 of the shroud 34. Thus, the radius Rv of the<br>
outwardly extending portion 66, as measured from the center 32 of the<br>
impeller 34 to the outermost terminus 68 of the vane 60, is greater than<br>
the radius Rs of the shroud 34. As explained more fully below, the shape<br>
of the outwardly extending portion 66 of the terminal end 64 may vary,<br>
and may be specifically selected to produce the desired flow velocity<br>
profile consistent with the pumping requirements of a given application.<br>
FIG. 8, however, illustrates a first embodiment of the invention<br>
where the outer terminal end 64 of the vane 60 has an outwardly<br>
extending portion 66 that has a radius Rv which is greater than the radius<br>
Rs of the shroud 34. The outer edge 62 of the vane 60 is also configured<br>
with a portion 70, 72 on either side of the outwardly extending portion 66<br>
that has a radius RB, which, in this embodiment, is equal to the radius Rs<br>
of the shroud 34. Thus, the vane 60 has a width  and the outwardly<br>
extending portion 66 has a width-WP that is less than the width Wv of the<br>
vane 60. It should be noted that in equally suitable alternative<br>
embodiments described more fully below, the width WP of the outwardly<br>
extending portion 66 may be equal to the width Wv of the vane 60.<br>
In the first embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 8,<br>
the outwardly extending portion 66 is generally arcuate in shape as<br>
measured from Point A to the terminus 68 of the outwardly extending<br>
portion 66 thence to Point B. Thus, by way of example only, the<br>
outwardly extending portion 66 may have a radius Rc. However, the<br>
arcuate line between Point A, the terminus 68, and Point B need not have<br>
a consistent radius (i.e., an arc). Those of skill in the art, consistent with<br>
the disclosure hereof, will understand that the dimensions of the arcuate<br>
or curvilinear line forming the outwardly extending portion 66 may be<br>
suitably varied to produce a desired flow velocity profile as described.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 9, the outer<br>
edge 62 of the vane 60 includes an outwardly extending portion 66 having<br>
a terminus 68 that defines a radius Rv of the vane 60. The outer edge 62<br>
further has a portion 70, 72 on either side of the outwardly extending<br>
portion 66 the radius RB of which is less than the radius Rs of the shroud<br>
34. Further, the radius Rs of the shroud 34 is less than the radius Rv of<br>
the outwardly extending portion 66. The outwardly extending portion 66<br>
is defined between Point A, the terminus 68 of the vane 60, and Point B,<br>
and has a width WP. The width Wp of the outwardly extending portion 66<br>
is less than the width Wv of the vane 60.<br>
In the alternative embodiment of FIG. 9, the outwardly extending<br>
portion 66 is illustrated, by way of example only, as being formed of two<br>
intersecting lines the first line 74 being defined between Point A and the<br>
terminus 68 of the vane 60, and the second line 76 being defined<br>
between the terminus 68 and Point B. This embodiment further serves to<br>
illustrate that the shape of the outwardly extending portion 66 can be<br>
other than an arcuate or curved line, as shown in FIG. 8, and can be<br>
comprised of a plurality of intersecting lines. Again, those of skill in the<br>
art will understand from the disclosure herein that the shape of the outer<br>
edge 62 of the vane 60 may be suitably modified in any variety of ways to<br>
provide a desired flow velocity profile.<br>
The illustrated embodiments of the impeller vane of the present<br>
invention depict a terminus 68 of the vane 60 which is centered relative to<br>
the width Wv of the vane 60. However, it should be noted that the<br>
terminus 68 may be located other than at the centerline 80 of the vane 60<br>
and of the width Wv as may be dictated by or required to achieve the<br>
desired flow velocity profile.<br>
FIGS. 8 and 9 depict alternative embodiments of the invention<br>
where the vane radius Rv is a representational view in cross section of a<br>
fifth embodiment of the present invention is greater than either the shroud<br>
radius Rs and/or the base radius RB. FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate other<br>
alternative embodiment of the invention. FIG. 10, for example, illustrates<br>
an alternative embodiment where the vane radius Rv is slightly less than<br>
the shroud radius Rs, and both the vane radius Rv and shroud radius Rs<br>
are greater than the base radius RB.<br>
Yet another alternative is illustrated in FIG. 11 where the radius RV<br>
of the vane 60 and the radius Rs of the shroud 34 are substantially equal,<br>
and both are greater than the base radius RB of the vane 60. Both of the<br>
embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 10 and 11 achieve a desired flow<br>
velocity that produces less wear on the volute of the pump casing. It<br>
should be noted that the convex-like outwardly extending portion 66<br>
shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 is depicted as a hemispherical shape by way<br>
of example only, and other suitable convex-like shapes or dimensions are<br>
appropriate and/or useful.<br>
Further, as noted previously, the position of Point A and Point B,<br>
which define the opposing axial ends of the outwardly extending portion<br>
66, may be located anywhere from nearer the center line 80 (FIGS. 8 and<br>
.9) of the vane 60 to the axial ends 82, 84 of the vane 60 as depicted in<br>
FIG. 12. Hence, the distance D between Point A and Point B may be<br>
from D=WV to about D=Wv/3, and Point A and Point B may be equally or<br>
unequally distanced from the centerline 80 of the vane 60.<br>
Referring again to the embodiment of the invention shown in FIG.<br>
12, the axial ends of the outwardly extending portion 66, defined as Point<br>
A and Point B, extend to the axial ends 82, 84 of the vane 60. As such,<br>
the illustrated embodiment of FIG. 12 does not have side portions (70,<br>
71) as in the embodiments of FIGS. 8-11, but the axial ends (Point A,<br>
Point B) of the outwardly extending portion 66 may be viewed as defining<br>
the base radius RB of the vane 60. Thus, in a fifth embodiment of the<br>
invention shown in FIG. 12, the radius Rv of the vane 60, defined from the<br>
center axis 32 of the impeller to the terminus 68 of the vane 60, is.great.er.<br>
than the radius Rs of the shroud 34, and the base radius RB is equal to<br>
the shroud radius Rs.<br>
In a sixth alternative embodiment also shown in FIG. 12 in<br>
phantom line, the shroud 34 may extend beyond the base radius RB of<br>
the vane 60 a selected distance so that the peripheral edge 36' of the<br>
impeller extends to a radius Rs'. The radius Rv of the vane 60 is,<br>
therefore, greater than RB and Rs'.<br>
In a seventh alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 13, the<br>
terminus 68 of the vane 60 may not extend to the peripheral edge 36 of<br>
the shroud 34. Therefore, in this embodiment, the outwardly extending<br>
portion 66 of the vane 60 does not extend beyond the shroud 34, but still<br>
advantageously effects the flow velocity profile of the impeller. In the<br>
embodiment of FIG. 13, the radius Rv of the vane 60 is greater than the<br>
base radius RB, but less than the radius Rs of the shroud 34.<br>
In still another alternative embodiment of the invention shown in<br>
FIG. 14, the terminus 68 of the vane 60 extends to a point substantially<br>
equal to the peripheral edge 36 of the shroud 34 such that the radius Rv<br>
of the vane 60 and radius Rs of the shroud 34 are equal, or substantially<br>
so, and the base radius RB is less than either the radius Rv of the vane or<br>
the radius Rs of the shroud. Again, although the convex-like edge of the<br>
embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 12-14 is arcuate, the outwardly<br>
extending portion 66 may be any suitable shape as previously described.<br>
Regardless of the shape of the outwardly extending portion 66 of<br>
. the vane 60 as illustrated and described previously, the area of the shape<br>
may preferably be between about 30% to about 85% of the area defined<br>
by WV(RV-RB). The following table illustrates by way of example only,<br>

The impeller vanes of the present invention are configured to<br>
provide a selected flow velocity profile which controls and/or reduces wear<br>
on the pump casing caused by fluid slurry being expelled from the impeller<br>
toward the casing. The impeller vanes may be adapted for use in virtually<br>
any type, size or variety of rotodynamic pump. Those of skill in the art,<br>
conferring with the disclosure herein, will understand the changes and<br>
adaptations that may be made to employ the impeller vanes in various<br>
pumps to produce the desired flow velocity profile. Hence, reference<br>
herein to specific details or embodiments of the invention are byway of illustration only and not by way of limitation.<br><br><br><br>
