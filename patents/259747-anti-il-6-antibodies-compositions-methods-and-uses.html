ANTI-IL-6 ANTIBODIES, COMPOSITIONS, METHODS AND USES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to antibodies, including specified portions or variants, specific for at least one IL-6 protein or fragment thereof, as well as anti-idiotype antibodies, and nucleic acids encoding such anti-IL-6 antibodies, complementary nucleic acids, vectors, host cells, and methods of making and using thereof, including therapeutic formulations, administration and devices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
IL-6 is a pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokine produced and secreted by a wide variety of cell types most notably antigen presenting cells, T and B cells. IL-6 is involved in such diverse activities as B cell growth and differentiation, T cell activation, hematopoiesis, osteoclast activation, keratinocyte growth, neuronal growth and hepatocyte activation. IL-6 binds to transmembrane or soluble 1L-6R and signals through gpl30, which is shared by several other cytokines.<br>
IL-6 plays an important role in B cell abnormalities as demonstrated in systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple myeloma and lymphoproliferalive disorders. Similarly, IL-6 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Recently, indirect evidence suggests an association between IL-6 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. IL-6 has both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects in the immune system, indicating that this cytokine likely plays a central role in regulating the physiological response to disease. Therefore, targeting IL-6 can potentially provide therapeutic benefit in a variety of disease areas.<br><br>
An increase in the production of IL-6 has been observed in a number of diseases including: Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, myocardial infarction, Paget's disease, osteoporosis, solid tumors (renal cell carcinoma), prostatic and bladder cancers, neurological cancers, and B-cell malignancies (e.g., Casteleman's disease, certain lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma).. Research has indicated that IL-6 is linked to the pathogenesis of many of these diseases, particularly, cancer and, therefore, blocking IL-6 should translate into clinical benefits.<br>
Murine, chimeric, and other non-human anti-IL-6 antibodies have been developed; however, they may be limited in their potency, effectiveness, may often trigger an unacceptable immune response (i.e., immunogenicity) and/or require a high dosage (See, Trikha et al., Clin. Can. Res. 9, 4653-4665, Oct. 2003. herein incorporated by reference). For example, antibodies containing non-human portions often give rise to an immune response in humans. Accordingly, repeated antibody administration is unsuitable as therapy and immune complex mediated clearance of antibodies from circulation can reduce the potency/effectiveness of the antibody. Serum sickness and anaphylaxis are two exemplary conditions that may be caused by repeat administration of antibodies having non-human portions. In this regard, an anti-IL-6 antibody with less potential for immunogenicity, i.e., more tolerable in humans, and that is more potent such that it requires a smaller dosage as compared to previously used anti-IL-6 antibodies is needed.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides isolated, recombinant and/or synthetic anti-IL-6 human engineered antibodies and IL-6 anti-idiotype antibodies thereto, as well as compositions and encoding nucleic acid molecules comprising at least one<br><br>
polynucleotide encoding at least one anti-IL-6 antibody or anti-idiotype antibody. The present invention further includes, but is not limited to, methods of making and using such nucleic acids and antibodies and anti-idiotype antibodies, including diagnostic and therapeutic compositions, methods and devices.<br>
As used herein, an "anti-IL-6 antibody," "IL-6 antibody," "anti-IL-6 antibody portion," or "anti-IL-6 antibody fragment" and/or "anti-IL-6 antibody variant" and the like include any protein or peptide containing molecule that comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin molecule, such as but not limited to, at least one complementarity determining region (CDR) of a heavy or light chain or a ligand binding portion thereof, a heavy chain or light chain variable region, a heavy chain or light chain constant region, a framework region, or any portion thereof, or at least one portion of an IL-6 receptor or binding protein, which can be incorporated into an antibody of the present invention. Such antibody optionally further affects a specific ligand, such as but not limited to, where such antibody modulates, decreases, increases, antagonizes, agonizes, mitigates, aleviates, blocks, inhibits, abrogates and/or interferes with at least one IL-6 activity or binding, or with IL-6 receptor activity or binding, in vitro, in situ and/or in vivo. As a non-limiting example, a suitable anti-IL-6 antibody, specified portion or variant of the present invention can bind at least one IL-6 molecule, or specified portions, variants or domains thereof. A suitable anti-IL-6 antibody, specified portion, or variant can also optionally affect at least one of IL-6 activity or function, such as but not limited to, RNA. DNA or protein synthesis, IL-6 release, IL-6 receptor signaling, membrane IL-6 cleavage, IL-6 activity, IL-6 production and/or synthesis.<br>
The term "antibody" is further intended to encompass antibodies, digestion fragments, specified portions and variants thereof, including antibody mimetics or comprising portions of antibodies that mimic the structure and/or function of an<br><br>
antibody or specified fragment or portion thereof, including single chain antibodies and fragments thereof. Functional fragments include antigen-binding fragments that bind to a mammalian IL-6. For example, antibody fragments capable of binding to IL-6 or portions thereof, including, but not limited to, Fab (e.g., by papain digestion), Fab' (e.g., by pepsin digestion and partial reduction) and F(ab')2 (e.g., by pepsin digestion), facb (e.g., by plasmin digestion), pFc' (e.g., by pepsin or plasmin digestion), Fd (e.g., by pepsin digestion, partial reduction and reaggregation), Fv or scFv (e.g., by molecular biology techniques) fragments, are encompassed by the invention (see, e.g., Colligan, Immunology, supra).<br>
Such fragments can be produced by enzymatic cleavage, synthetic or recombinant techniques, as known in the art and/or as described herein. Antibodies can also be produced in a variety of truncated forms using antibody genes in which one or more stop codons have been introduced upstream of the natural stop site. For example, a combination gene encoding a F(ab')2 heavy chain portion can be designed to include DNA sequences encoding the CH] domain and/or hinge region of the heavy chain. The various portions of antibodies can be joined together chemically by conventional techniques, or can be prepared as a contiguous protein using genetic engineering techniques.<br>
As used herein, the term "human engineered antibody" is an antibody with at least fully human frameworks and constant regions (CL, CH domains (e.g., CH1 CH2, CH3), and hinge), and CDRs derived from antigen binding antibodies. Fully human frameworks comprise frameworks that correspond to human germline sequences as well as sequences with somatic mutations. CDRs may be derived from one or more CDRs that bind to IL-6 in the context of any antibody framework. For example, the CDRs of the human engineered antibody of the present invention may be derived from CDRs that bind IL-6 in the context of a mouse antibody framework and then<br><br>
are engineered to bind IL-6 in the context of a fully human framework. Often, the human engineered antibody is substantially non-immunogenic in humans.<br>
Similarly, antibodies designated primate (monkey, babboon, chimpanzee, etc.), rodent (mouse, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, hamster, and the like) and other mammals designate such species, sub-genus, genus, sub-family, and family specific antibodies. Further, chimeric antibodies can include any combination of the above. Such changes or variations optionally and preferably retain or reduce the immunogenicity in humans or other species relative to non-modified antibodies. Thus, a human engineered antibody is distinct from a chimeric or humanized antibody.<br>
It is pointed out that a human engineered antibody can be produced by a non-human animal or prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell that is capable of expressing functionally rearranged human or human engineered immunoglobulin (e.g., heavy chain and/or light chain) genes. Further, when a human engineered antibody is a single chain antibody, it can comprise a linker peptide that is not found in native human antibodies. For example, an Fv can comprise a linker peptide, such as two to about eight glycine or other amino acid residues, which connects the variable region of the heavy chain and the variable region of the light chain. Such linker peptides are considered to be of human origin.<br>
Bispecific, heterospecific, heteroconjugate or similar antibodies can also be used that are monoclonal, preferably, human, human engineered, or humanized, antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case, one of the binding specificities is for at least one IL-6 protein, the other one is for any other antigen. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally, the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where<br><br>
the two heavy chains have different specificities (Milstein and Cuello, Nature 305:537 (1983)). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule is usually done by affinity chromatography steps. Similar procedures are disclosed, e.g., in WO 93/08829, US Patent Nos, 6210668, 6193967, 6132992, 6106833, 6060285, 6037453, 6010902. 5989530, 5959084, 5959083,5932448,5833985, 5821333, 5807706, 5643759, 5601819, 5582996, 5496549, 4676980, WO 91/00360, WO 92/00373, EP 03089, Traunecker et al, EMBO J. 10:3655 (1991), Suresh et al., Methods in Enzymology 121:210 (1986), each entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Anti-IL-6 antibodies useful in the methods and compositions of the present invention can optionally be characterized by high affinity binding to IL-6 and, optionally and preferably, as having low toxicity. In particular, an antibody, specified fragment or variant of the invention, where the individual components, such as the variable region, constant region and framework, individually and/or collectively, optionally and preferably possess low immunogenicity, is useful in the present invention. The antibodies that can be used in the invention are optionally characterized by their ability to treat patients for extended periods with measurable alleviation of symptoms and low and/or acceptable toxicity. Low or acceptable immunogenicity and/or high affinity, as well as other suitable properties, can contribute to the therapeutic results achieved. "Low immunogenicity" is defined herein as the incidence of titrable levels of antibodies to the anti-IL-6 antibody in patients treated with anti-IL-6 antibody as occurring in less than 25% of patients treated, preferably, in less than 10% of patients treated with the recommended dose for the recommended course of therapy during the treatment period.<br><br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can be used for production of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody or specified variant thereof, which can be used to measure or effect in an cell, tissue, organ or animal (including mammals and humans), to diagnose, monitor, modulate, treat, alleviate, help prevent the incidence of, or reduce the symptoms of, at least one IL-6 condition, selected from, but not limited to, at least one of an immune disorder or disease, a cardiovascular disorder or disease, an infectious, malignant, and/or neurologic disorder or disease, or other known or specified IL-6 related condition.<br>
Such a method can comprise administering an effective amount of a composition or a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one anti-IL-6 antibody to a cell, tissue, organ, animal or patient in need of such modulation, treatment, alleviation, prevention, or reduction in symptoms, effects or mechanisms. The effective amount can comprise an amount of about 0.001 to 500 mg/kg per single (e.g., bolus), multiple or continuous administration, or to achieve a serum concentration of 0.01-5000 u.g/ml serum concentration per single, multiple, or continuous adminstration, or any effective range or value therein, as done and determined using known methods, as described herein or known in the relevant arts.<br>
Antibodies of the Present Invention - Production and Generation<br>
At least one anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention can be optionally produced by a cell line, a mixed cell line, an immortalized cell or clonal population of immortalized cells, as well known in the art. See, e.g., Ausubel, et al., ed., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., NY, NY (1987-2001); Sambrook, et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989); Harlow and Lane, Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989); Colligan, et al., eds., Current Protocols in<br><br>
Immunology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., NY (1994-2001); Colligan et al.. Current Protocols in Protein Science, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, NY, (1997-2001).<br>
Human engineered antibodies that are specific for human 1L-6 proteins or fragments thereof can be raised against an appropriate immunogenic antigen, such as an isolated IL-6 protein and/or a portion thereof (including synthetic molecules, such as synthetic peptides). Other specific or general mammalian antibodies can be similarly raised. Preparation of immunogenic antigens, and monoclonal antibody production can be performed using any suitable technique.<br>
In one approach, a hybridoma is produced by fusing a suitable immortal cell line (e.g., a myeloma cell line, such as, but not limited to, Sp2/0, Sp2/0-AG14, NSO, NS1, NS2, AE-1, L.5, L243, P3X63Ag8.653, Sp2 SA3, Sp2 MAI, Sp2 SSI, Sp2 SA5, U937, MLA 144, ACT IV, MOLT4, DA-1, JURKAT, WEIII, K-562, COS, RAJI, NIH 3T3, HL-60, MLA 144, NAMALWA, NEURO 2A, or the like, or heteromylomas, fusion products thereof, or any cell or fusion cell derived therefrom, or any other suitable cell line as known in the art) (see, e.g., www.atcc.org, www.lifetech.com., and the like), with antibody producing cells, such as, but not limited to, isolated or cloned spleen, peripheral blood, lymph, tonsil, or other immune or B cell containing cells, or any other cells expressing heavy or light chain constant or variable or framework or CDR sequences, either as endogenous or heterologous nucleic acid, as recombinant or endogenous, viral, bacterial, algal, prokaryotic, amphibian, insect, reptilian, fish, mammalian, rodent, equine, ovine, goat, sheep, primate, eukaryotic, genomic DNA, cDNA, rDNA, mitochondrial DNA or RNA, chloroplast DNA or RNA, hnRNA, mRNA, tRNA, single, double or triple stranded, hybridized, and the like or any combination thereof. See, e.g., Ausubel, supra, and Colligan, Immunology, supra, chapter 2, entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Antibody producing cells can also be obtained from the peripheral blood or, preferably, the spleen or lymph nodes, of humans or other suitable animals that have been immunized with the antigen of interest. Any other suitable host cell can also be used for expressing heterologous or endogenous nucleic acid encoding an antibody, specified fragment or variant thereof, of the present invention. The fused cells (hybridomas) or recombinant cells can be isolated using selective culture conditions or other suitable known methods, and cloned by limiting dilution or cell sorting, or other known methods. Cells which produce antibodies with the desired specificity can be selected by a suitable assay (e.g., ELISA).<br>
Methods for engineering or humanizing non-human or human antibodies can also be used and are well known in the art. A humanized or engineered antibody may have one or more amino acid residues from a source that is non-human, e.g., but not limited to, mouse, rat, rabbit, non-human primate or other mammal.  These non-human amino acid residues are replaced by residues that are often referred to as "import" residues, which are typically taken from an "import" variable, constant or other domain of a known human sequence.<br>

Such imported sequences can be used to reduce immunogenicity or reduce, enhance or modify binding, affinity, on-rate, off-rate, avidity, specificity, half-life, or any other suitable characteristic, as known in the art. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. Accordingly, part or all of the non-human or human CDR sequences are maintained while the non-human sequences of the variable and constant regions may be replaced with human or other amino acids.<br>
Antibodies can also optionally be humanized or engineered or human antibodies engineered with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal, humanized (or human) or engineered antibodies can be optionally prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized and engineered products using three-dimensional models of the parental, engineered, and humanized sequences. Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar<br><br>
to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, framework (FR) residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved.<br>
In addition, the human engineered IL-6 antibody of the present invention may comprise a human germline light chain framework. In particular embodiments, the light chain germline sequence is selected from human VK sequences including, but not limited to, Al, A10, Al 1, A14, A17, A18, A19, A2, A20, A23, A26, A27, A3, A30, A5, A7, B2, B3, LI, L10, LI 1, L12, L14, L15, L16, L18, L19, L2, L20, L22, L23, L24, L25, L4/18a, L5, L6, L8, L9, 01, Oil, 012, 014, 018, 02, 04, and 08.

In particular embodiments, the light chain variable region and/or heavy chain variable region comprises a framework region or at least a portion of a framework region (e.g., containing 2 or 3 subregions, such as FR2 and FR3). In certain embodiments, at least FRL1, FRL2, FRL3, or FRL4 is fully human. In other embodiments, at least FRH1, FRH2, FRH3, or FRH4 is fully human. In some embodiments, at least FRL1, FRL2, FRL3, or FRL4 is a germline sequence (e.g.. human germline) or comprises human consensus sequences for the particular framework (readily available at the sources of known human Ig sequences described above). In other embodiments, at least FRH1, FRH2, FRH3, or FRH4 is a germline sequence (e.g., human germline) or comprises human consensus sequences for the particular framework. In preferred embodiments, the framework region is a human framework region (e.g., the human framework regions shown below in Tables 13 and 14).

In certain embodiments, the antibody comprises an altered (e.g., mutated) Fc region. For example, in some embodiments, the Fc region has been altered to reduce or enhance the effector functions of the antibody. In some embodiments, the Fc region is an isotype selected from IgM, IgA, IgG, IgE, or other isotype.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, it may be useful to combine amino acid modifications with one or more further amino acid modifications that alter C1 q binding and/or the complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) function of the Fc region of an IL-6 binding molecule. The starting polypeptide of particular interest may be one that binds to Clq and displays complement dependent cytotoxicity. Polypeptides with pre-existing Clq binding activity, optionally further having the ability to mediate CDC may be modified such that one or both of these activities are enhanced. Amino acid modifications that alter Clq and/or modify its complement dependent cytotoxicity function are described, for example, in WO0042072, which is hereby incoiporated by reference.<br>
As disclosed above, one can design an Fc region of the human engineered IL-6 antibody of the present invention with altered effector function, e.g., by modifying Clq binding and/or FcyR binding and thereby changing CDC activity and/or ADCC activity. "Effector functions" are responsible for activating or diminishing a biological activity (e.g., in a subject). Examples of effector functions include, but are not limited to: Clq binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor; BCR), etc.   Such effector functions may require the Fc region to be combined with a<br><br>
binding domain (e.g., an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays (e.g., Fc binding assays, ADCC assays, CDC assays, etc.).<br>
For example, one can generate a variant Fc region of the human engineered IL-6 antibody with improved Clq binding and improved FcyRIIIbinding (e.g., having both improved ADCC activity and improved CDC activity). Alternatively, if it is desired that effector function be reduced or ablated, a variant Fc region can be engineered with reduced CDC activity and/or reduced ADCC activity. In other embodiments, only one of these activities may be increased, and, optionally, also the other activity reduced (e.g., to generate an Fc region variant with improved ADCC activity, but reduced CDC activity and vice versa).<br>
Fc mutations can also be introduced in engineer to alter their interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and improve their pharmacokinetic properties. A collection of human Fc variants with improved binding to the FcRn have been described (Shields et al., (2001). High resolution mapping of the binding site on human IgGl for FcyRI, FcyRII, FcyRIII, and FcRn and design of IgGl variants with improved binding to the FcyR, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-6604).<br>
Another type of amino acid substitution serves to alter the glycosylation pattern of the Fc region of the human engineered IL-6 antibody. Glycosylation of an Fc region is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used. The recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain peptide sequences are asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine,<br><br>
where X is any amino acid except proline. Thus, the presence of either of these peptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site.<br>
The glycosylation pattern may be altered, for example, by deleting one or more glycosylation site(s) found in the polypeptide, and/or adding one or more glycosylation site(s) that are not present in the polypeptide. Addition of glycosylation sites to the Fc region of a human engineered IL-6 antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). An exemplary glycosylation variant has an amino acid substitution of residue Asn 297 of the heavy chain. The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original polypeptide (for O-linked glycosylation sites). Additionally, a change of Asn 297 to Ala can remove one of the glycosylation sites.<br>
In certain embodiments, the human engineered IL-6 antibody of the present invention is expressed in cells that express beta (1,4)-N-<br>
acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT III), such that GnT III adds GlcNAc to the human engineered IL-6 antibody. Methods for producing antibodies in such a fashion are provided in WO/9954342, WO/03011878, patent publication 20030003097A1, and Umana et al., Nature Biotechnology, 17:176-180, Feb. 1999.<br>
A human anti-IL-6 antibody can be optionally generated by immunization of a transgenic animal (e.g., mouse, rat, hamster, non-human primate, and the like) capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies, as described herein and/or as known in the art. Cells that produce a human anti-IL-6 antibody can be isolated from such animals and immortalized using suitable methods, such as the methods described herein.<br><br>
Transgenic mice that can produce a repertoire of human antibodies that bind to human antigens can be produced by known methods (e.g., but not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos: 5,770,428, 5,569,825, 5,545,806, 5,625,126, 5,625,825, 5,633,425, 5,661,016 and 5,789,650 issued to Lonberg et al; Jakobovits et al. WO 98/50433, Jakobovits et al. WO 98/24893, Lonberg et al.

Generally, these mice comprise at least one transgene comprising DNA from at least one human immunoglobulin locus that is functionally rearranged, or which can undergo functional rearrangement. The endogenous immunoglobulin loci in such mice can be disrupted or deleted to eliminate the capacity of the animal to produce antibodies encoded by endogenous genes.<br>
Screening antibodies for specific binding to similar proteins or fragments can be conveniently achieved using peptide display libraries. This method involves the screening of large collections of peptides for individual members having the desired function or structure. Antibody screening of peptide display libraries is well known in the art. The displayed peptide sequences can be from 3 to 5000 or more amino acids in length, frequently from 5-100 amino acids long, and often from about 8 to 25 amino acids long. In addition to direct chemical synthetic methods for generating peptide<br><br>
libraries, several recombinant DNA methods have been described. One type involves the display of a peptide sequence on the surface of a bacteriophage or cell. Each bacteriophage or cell contains the nucleotide sequence encoding the particular displayed peptide sequence. Such methods are described in PCX Patent Publication Nos. 91/17271, 91/18980, 91/19818, and 93/08278.<br>
Other systems for generating libraries of peptides have aspects of both in vitro chemical synthesis and recombinant methods. See, PCT Patent Publication Nos. 92/05258, 92/14843, and 96/19256. See also, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,658,754; and 5,643,768. Peptide display libraries, vector, and screening kits are commercially available from such suppliers as Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and Cambridge Antibody Technologies (Cambridgeshire, UK). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4704692, 4939666, 4946778, 5260203, 5455030, 5518889, 5534621, 5656730, 5763733, 5767260, 5856456, assigned to Enzon; 5223409, 5403484, 5571698, 5837500, assigned to Dyax, 5427908, 5580717, assigned to Affymax; 5885793, assigned to Cambridge Antibody Technologies; 5750373, assigned to Genentech, 5618920, 5595898, 5576195, 5698435, 5693493, 5698417, assigned to Xoma, Colligan, supra; Ausubel supra; or Sambrook, supra.     Antibodies of the present invention can also be prepared using at least one anti-IL-6 antibody encoding nucleic acid to provide transgenic animals or mammals, such as goats, cows, horses, sheep, rabbits and the like, that produce such antibodies in their milk. Such animals can be provided using known methods. See, e.g., but not limited to, US Patent Nos. 5,827,690; 5,849,992; 4,873,316; 5,849,992; 5,994,616; 5,565,362; 5,304,489, and the like, each of which is entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Antibodies of the present invention can additionally be prepared using at least one anti-IL-6 antibody encoding nucleic acid to provide transgenic plants and cultured plant cells (e.g., but not limited to, tobacco and maize) that produce such<br><br>
antibodies, specified portions or variants in the plant parts or in cells cultured therefrom. As a non-limiting example, transgenic tobacco leaves expressing recombinant proteins have been successfully used to provide large amounts of recombinant proteins, e.g., using an inducible promoter. See, e.g., Cramer et al., CUIT. Top. Microbol. Immunol. 240:95-118 (1999) and references cited therein. Also, transgenic maize have been used to express mammalian proteins at commercial production levels, with biological activities equivalent to those produced in other recombinant systems or purified from natural sources. See, e.g., Hood et al., Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 464:127-147 (1999) and references cited therein. Antibodies have also been produced in large amounts from transgenic plant seeds including antibody fragments, such as single chain antibodies (scFv's), including tobacco seeds and potato tubers. See, e.g., Conrad et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 38:101-109 (1998) and references cited therein. Thus, antibodies of the present invention can also be produced using transgenic plants, according to known methods. See also, e.g., Fischer et al., Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 30:99-108 (Oct., 1999), Ma et al., Trends Biotechnol. 13:522-7 (1995); Ma et al, Plant Physiol. 109:341-6 (1995); Whitelam et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans. 22:940-944 (1994); and references cited therein.<br>
The antibodies of the invention can bind human IL-6 with a wide range of affinities (KD). In a preferred embodiment, at least one human mAb of the present invention can optionally bind human IL-6 with high affinity. For example, a human or human engineered mAb can bind human IL-6 with a KD equal to or less than about 10'7 M, such as but not limited to, 0.1-9.9 (or any range or value therein) X 10"7, 10"8, 10"9, 10"10, 10"", 10-12, 10"13, 10"14, 10"15 or any range or value therein, as determined by surface plasmon resonance or the Kinexa method, as practiced by those of skill in the art.<br><br>
The affinity or avidity of an antibody for an antigen can be determined experimentally using any suitable method. (See, for example, Berzofsky, et al, "Antibody-Antigen Interactions," In Fundamental Immunology, Paul, W. E., Ed., Raven Press: New York, NY (1984); Kuby, Janis Immunology, W. H. Freeman and Company: New York, NY (1992); and methods described herein). The measured affinity of a particular antibody-antigen interaction can vary if measured under different conditions (e.g., salt concentration, pH). Thus, measurements of affinity and other antigen-binding parameters (e.g., KD, Kon, K0fr) are preferably made with standardized solutions of antibody and antigen, and a standardized buffer, such as the buffer described herein.<br>
Competitive assays can be performed with the antibody of the present invention in order to determine what proteins, antibodies, and other antagonists compete for binding to IL-6 with the antibody of the present invention and/or share the epitope region. These assays as readily known to those of ordinary skill in the art evaluate competition between antagonists or ligands for a limited number of binding sites on a protein. The protein and/or antibody is immobilized or insolubilized before or after the competition and the sample bound to IL-6 is separated from the unbound sample, for example, by decanting (where the protein/antibody was preinsolubilized) or by centrifuging (where the protein/antibody was precipitated after the competitive reaction). Also, the competitive binding may be determined by whether function is altered by the binding or lack of binding of the antibody to the protein, e.g., whether the antibody molecule inhibits or potentiates the enzymatic activity of, for example, a label. ELISA and other functional assays may be used, as well known in the art.<br>
Preferred anti-IL-6 antibodies of the invention have the sequences shown in Tables 1-5 and 12-14 below. For example, an anti-IL-6 antibody of the invention<br><br>
has one of the light chain CDR sequences shown in Table 1 (i.e., CDRL1, CDRL2, and CDRL3) and one of the heavy chain CDR sequences shown in Tabic 2 (i.e., CDRH1, CDRH2, and CDRH3). More specifically, an anti-IL-6 antibody (molecule AME-A9) has the CDRL1 of SEQ ID NO: 15, CDRL2 of SEQ ID NO:27, CDRL3 of SEQ ID NO:35, CDRH1 of SEQ ID NO:47, CDRH2 of SEQ ID NO:61, CDRII3 of SEQ ID NO:91.<br>
Nucleic Acid Molecules<br>
Using the information provided herein, for example, the nucleotide sequences encoding at least 70-100% of the contiguous amino acids of at least one of the light chain variable regions of SEQ ID NOS: 93, 97, and 101, among other sequences disclosed herein, and at least one of the heavy chain variable regions of SEQ ID NOS: 95, 99, and 103, among other sequences disclosed herein, specified fragments, variants or consensus sequences thereof, or a deposited vector comprising at least one of these sequences, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention encoding at least one anti-IL-6 antibody can be obtained using methods described herein or as known in the art.<br>
Nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can be in the form of RNA, such as mRNA, hnRNA, tRNA or any other form, or in the form of DNA, including, but not limited to, cDNA and genomic DNA obtained by cloning or produced synthetically, or any combinations thereof. The DNA can be triple-stranded, double-stranded or single-stranded, or any combination thereof. Any portion of at least one strand of the DNA or RNA can be the coding strand, also known as the sense strand, or it can be the non-coding strand, also referred to as the anti-sense strand.<br>
Isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can include nucleic acid molecules comprising an open reading frame (ORF), optionally, with one or<br><br>
more introns, e.g., but not limited to, at least one specified portion of at least one CDR, such as CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3 of at least one heavy chain (e.g., SEQ ID NOS: 38, 40, 42, 44, etc.) or light chain (e.g., SEQ ID NOS: 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.); nucleic acid molecules comprising the coding sequence for an anti-IL-6 antibody or variable region (e.g., light chain variable regions of SEQ ID NOS: 94, 98, and 102, among other sequences disclosed herein, and heavy chain variable regions of SEQ ID NOS: 96, 100, and 104); and nucleic acid molecules which comprise a nucleotide sequence substantially different from those described above but which, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, still encode at least one anti-IL-6 antibody as described herein and/or as known in the art. Of course, the genetic code is well known in the art. Thus, it would be routine for one skilled in the art to generate such degenerate nucleic acid variants that code for specific anti-IL-6 antibodies of the present invention. See, e.g., Ausubel, et al., supra, and such nucleic acid variants are included in the present invention.<br>
As indicated herein, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention which comprise a nucleic acid encoding an anti-IL-6 antibody can include, but are not limited to, those encoding the amino acid sequence of an antibody fragment, by itself; the coding sequence for the entire antibody or a portion thereof; the coding sequence for an antibody, fragment or portion, as well as additional sequences, such as the coding sequence of at least one signal leader or fusion peptide, with or without the aforementioned additional coding sequences, such as at least one intron, together with additional, non-coding sequences, including but not limited to, non-coding 5' and 3' sequences, such as the transcribed, non-translated sequences that play a role in transcription, mRNA processing, including splicing and polyadenylation signals (for example, ribosome binding and stability of mRNA); an additional coding sequence that codes for additional amino acids, such as those that provide additional functionalities. Thus, the sequence encoding an antibody can be fused to a marker<br><br>
sequence, such as a sequence encoding a peptide that facilitates purification of the fused antibody comprising an antibody fragment or portion.<br>
Polynucleotides Selectively Hybridizing to a Polynucleotide as Described Herein<br>
The present invention provides isolated nucleic acids that hybridize under selective hybridization conditions to a polynucleotide disclosed herein. Thus, the polynucleotides of this embodiment can be used for isolating, detecting, and/or quantifying nucleic acids comprising such polynucleotides. For example, polynucleotides of the present invention can be used to identify, isolate, or amplify partial or full-length clones in a deposited library. In some embodiments, the polynucleotides are genomic or cDNA sequences isolated, or otherwise complementary to, a cDNA from a human or mammalian nucleic acid library.<br>
Preferably, the cDNA library comprises at least 80% full-length sequences, preferably, at least 85% or 90% full-length sequences, and, more preferably, at least 95%o full-length sequences. The cDNA libraries can be normalized to increase the representation of rare sequences. Low or moderate stringency hybridization conditions are typically, but not exclusively, employed with sequences having a reduced sequence identity relative to complementary sequences. Moderate and high stringency conditions can optionally be employed for sequences of greater identity. Low stringency conditions allow selective hybridization of sequences having about 70% sequence identity and can be employed to identify orthologous or paralogous sequences.<br>
Optionally, polynucleotides of this invention will encode at least a portion of an antibody encoded by the polynucleotides described herein. The polynucleotides of this invention embrace nucleic acid sequences that can be employed for selective<br><br>
hybridization to a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the present invention. See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; Colligan, supra, each entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Construction of Nucleic Acids<br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can be made using (a) recombinant methods, (b) synthetic techniques, (c) purification techniques, and/or (d) combinations thereof, as well-known in the art.<br>
The nucleic acids can conveniently comprise sequences in addition to a polynucleotide of the present invention. For example, a multi-cloning site comprising one or more endonuclease restriction sites can be inserted into the nucleic acid to aid in isolation of the polynucleotide. Also, translatable sequences can be inserted to aid in the isolation of the translated polynucleotide of the present invention. For example, a hexa-histidine marker sequence provides a convenient means to purify the proteins of the present invention. The nucleic acid of the present invention, excluding the coding sequence, is optionally a vector, adapter, or linker for cloning and/or expression of a polynucleotide of the present invention.<br>
Additional sequences can be added to such cloning and/or expression sequences to optimize their function in cloning and/or expression, to aid in isolation of the polynucleotide, or to improve the introduction of the polynucleotide into a cell.<br><br>
Use of cloning vectors, expression vectors, adapters, and linkers is well known in the art. (See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; or Sambrook, supra)<br>
Recombinant Methods for Constructing Nucleic Acids<br>
The isolated nucleic acid compositions of this invention, such as RNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, or any combination thereof, can be obtained from biological sources using any number of cloning methodologies known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments, oligonucleotide probes that selectively hybridize, under stringent conditions, to the polynucleotides of the present invention are used to identify the desired sequence in a cDNA or genomic DNA library. The isolation of RNA, and construction of cDNA and genomic libraries, are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. (See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; or Sambrook, supra)<br>
Nucleic Acid Screening and Isolation Methods<br>
A cDNA or genomic library can be screened using a probe based upon the sequence of a polynucleotide of the present invention, such as those disclosed herein. Probes can be used to hybridize with genomic DNA or cDNA sequences to isolate homologous genes in the same or different organisms. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that various degrees of stringency of hybridization can be employed in the assay; and either the hybridization or the wash medium can be stringent. As the conditions for hybridization become more stringent, there must be a greater degree of complementarity between the probe and the target for duplex formation to occur. The degree of stringency can be controlled by one or more of temperature, ionic strength, pH and the presence of a partially denaturing solvent, such as formamide. For example, the stringency of hybridization is conveniently varied by changing the polarity of the reactant solution through, for example, manipulation of the concentration of formamide within the range of 0% to 50%. The degree of<br><br>
complementarity (sequence identity) required for detectable binding will vary in accordance with the stringency of the hybridization medium and/or wash medium. The degree of complementarity will optimally be 100%, or 70-100%, or any range or value therein. However, it should be understood that minor sequence variations in the probes and primers can be compensated for by reducing the stringency of the hybridization and/or wash medium.<br>
Methods of amplification of RNA or DNA are well known in the art and can be used according to the present invention without undue experimentation, based on the teaching and guidance presented herein.<br>
Known methods of DNA or RNA amplification include, but are not limited to, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and related amplification processes (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,683,195, 4,683,202, 4,800,159, 4,965,188, to Mullis, et al.; 4,795,699 and 4,921,794 to Tabor, et al; 5,142,033 to Innis; 5,122,464 to Wilson, et al; 5,091,310 to Innis; 5,066,584 to Gyllensten, et al; 4,889,818 to Gelfand, et al; 4,994,370 to Silver, et al; 4,766,067 to Biswas; 4,656,134 to Ringold) and RNA mediated amplification that uses anti-sense RNA to the target sequence as a template for double-stranded DNA synthesis (U.S. Patent No. 5,130,238 to Malek, et al, with the tradename NASBA), the entire contents of which references are incorporated herein by reference. (See, e.g., Ausubel, supra; or Sambrook, supra.)<br>
For instance, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology can be used to amplify the sequences of polynucleotides of the present invention and related genes directly from genomic DNA or cDNA libraries. PCR and other in vitro amplification methods can also be useful, for example, to clone nucleic acid sequences that code for proteins to be expressed, to make nucleic acids to use as probes for detecting the presence of the desired mRNA in samples, for nucleic acid sequencing, or for other purposes. Examples of techniques sufficient to direct persons of skill through in vitro<br><br>
amplification methods are found in Berger, supra, Sambrook, supra, and Ausubel, supra, as well as Mullis, et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,683,202 (1987); and lnnis, et al., PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications, Eds., Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA (1990). Commercially available kits for genomic PCR amplification arc known in the ait. See, e.g., Advantage-GC Genomic PCR Kit (Clontech). Additionally, e.g., the T4 gene 32 protein (Boehringer Mannheim) can be used to improve yield of long PCR products.<br>
Synthetic Methods for Constructing Nucleic Acids<br>
The isolated nucleic acids of the present invention can also be prepared by direct chemical synthesis by known methods (see, e.g., Ausubel, et al., supra). Chemical synthesis generally produces a single-stranded oligonucleotide, which can be converted into double-stranded DNA by hybridization with a complementary sequence, or by polymerization with a DNA polymerase using the single strand as a template. One of skill in the art will recognize that while chemical synthesis of DNA can be limited to sequences of about 100 or more bases, longer sequences can be obtained by the ligation of shorter sequences.<br>
Recombinant Expression Cassettes<br>
The present invention further provides recombinant expression cassettes comprising a nucleic acid of the present invention. A nucleic acid sequence of the present invention, for example, a cDNA or a genomic sequence encoding an antibody of the present invention, can be used to construct a recombinant expression cassette that can be introduced into at least one desired host cell. A recombinant expression cassette will typically comprise a polynucleotide of the present invention operably linked to transcriptional initiation regulatory sequences that will direct the transcription of the polynucleotide in the intended host cell. Both heterologous and non-<br><br>
heterologous (i.e., endogenous) promoters can be employed to direct expression of the nucleic acids of the present invention.<br>
In some embodiments, isolated nucleic acids that serve as promoter, enhancer, or other elements can be introduced in the appropriate position (upstream, downstream or in the intron) of a non-heterologous form of a polynucleotide of the present invention so as to up or down regulate expression of a polynucleotide of the present invention. For example, endogenous promoters can be altered in vivo or in vitro by mutation, deletion and/or substitution.<br>
Vectors And Host Cells<br>
The present invention also relates to vectors that include isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, host cells that are genetically engineered with the recombinant vectors, and the production of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody by recombinant techniques, as is well known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook, et al., supra; Ausubel, et al., supra, each entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The polynucleotides can optionally be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for propagation in a host. Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate, such as a calcium phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus, it can be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells.<br>
The DNA insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter. The expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the mature transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating at the beginning and a termination codon<br><br>
(e.g., UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the mRNA to be translated, with UAA and UAG preferred for mammalian or eukaryotic cell expression.<br>
Expression vectors will preferably but optionally include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include, e.g., but are not limited to, methotrexate (MTX), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, US Pat.Nos. 4,399,216; 4,634,665; 4,656,134; 4,956,288; 5,149,636; 5,179,017, ampicillin, neomycin (G418), mycophenolic acid, or glutamine synthetase (GS, US Pat.Nos. 5,122,464; 5,770,359; 5,827,739) resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, and tetracycline or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in E. coli and other bacteria or prokaryotics (the above patents are entirely incorporated hereby by reference). Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are known in the art. Suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan. Introduction of a vector construct into a host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection or other known methods. Such methods are described in the art, such as Sambrook, supra, Chapters 1-4 and 16-18; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 1. 9, 13,15,16.<br>
At least one antibody of the present invention can be expressed in a modified form, such as a fusion protein, and can include not only secretion signals, but also additional heterologous functional regions. For instance, a region of additional amino acids, particularly charged amino acids, can be added to the N-terminus of an antibody to improve stability and persistence in the host cell, during purification, or during subsequent handling and storage. Also, peptide moieties can be added to an antibody of the present invention to facilitate purification. Such regions can be removed prior to final preparation of an antibody or at least one fragment thereof.<br><br>
Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Sambrook, supra, Chapters 17.29-17.42 and 18.1-18.74; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 16, 17 and 18.<br>
Those of ordinaiy skill in the ail are knowledgeable in the numerous expression systems available for expression of a nucleic acid encoding a protein of the present invention. Alternatively, nucleic acids of the present invention can be . expressed in a host cell by turning on (by manipulation) in a host cell that contains endogenous DNA encoding an antibody of the present invention. Such methods are well known in the art, e.g., as described in US patent Nos. 5,580,734, 5,641,670, 5,733,746, and 5,733,761, entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Illustrative of cell cultures useful for the production of the antibodies, specified portions or variants thereof, are mammalian cells. Mammalian cell systems often will be in the form of monolayers of cells although mammalian cell suspensions or bioreactors can also be used. A number of suitable host cell lines capable of expressing intact glycosylated proteins have been developed in the art, and include the COS-1 (e.g., ATCC CRL 1650), COS-7 (e.g., ATCC CRL-1651), HEK293, BHK21 ' (e.g., ATCC CRL-10), CHO (e.g., ATCC CRL 1610) and BSC-1 (e.g., ATCC CRL-26) cell lines, Cos-7 cells, CHO cells, hep G2 cells, P3X63Ag8.653, SP2/0-Agl4, 293 cells, HeLa cells and the like, which are readily available from, for example. American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va (www.atcc.org). Preferred host cells include cells of lymphoid origin, such as myeloma and lymphoma cells. Particularly preferred host cells are P3X63Ag8.653 cells (ATCC Accession Number CRL-1580) and SP2/0-Agl4 cells (ATCC Accession Number CRL-1851). In a particularly preferred embodiment, the recombinant cell is a P3X63Ab8.653 or a SP2/0-Agl4 cell.<br><br>
Expression vectors for these cells can include one or more of the following expression control sequences, such as, but not limited to, an origin of replication; a promoter (e.g., late or early SV40 promoters, the CMV promoter (US Pat.Nos. 5,168,062; 5,385,839), an HSV tk promoter, a pgk (phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter, an EF-1 alpha promoter (US Pat.No. 5,266,491), at least one human immunoglobulin promoter; an enhancer, and/or processing information sites, such as ribosome binding sites, RNA splice sites, polyadenylation sites (e.g., an SV40 large T Ag poly A addition site), and transcriptional terminator sequences. See, e.g., Ausubel et al., supra; Sambrook, et al., supra. Other cells useful for production of nucleic acids or proteins of the present invention are known and/or available, for instance, from the American Type Culture Collection Catalogue of Cell Lines and Hybridomas (www.atcc.org) or other known or commercial sources.<br>
When eujcaryofic host cells are employed, polyadenlyation or transcription terminator sequences are typically incorporated into the vector. An example of a terminator sequencers the polyadenlyation sequence from the bovine growth hormone gene. Sequences for accurate splicing of the transcript can also be included. An example of a splicing sequence is the VP1 intron from SV40 (Sprague, et al., J. Virol. 45:773-781 (1983)). Additionally, gene sequences to control replication in the host cell can be incorporated into the vector, as known in the art.<br>
Purification of an Antibody<br>
An anti-IL-6 antibody can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including, but not limited to, protein A purification, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. High performance liquid chromatography ("HPLC") can<br><br>
also be employed for purification. See, e.g., Colligan, Current Protocols in Immunology, or Current Protocols in Protein Science, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, NY, (1997-2001), e.g., Chapters 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, each entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Antibodies of the present invention include naturally purified products, products of chemical synthetic procedures, and products produced by recombinant techniques from a eukaryotic host, including, for example, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the antibody of the present invention can be glycosylated or can be non-glycosylated, with glycosylated preferred. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Sambrook, supra, Sections 17.37-17.42; Ausubel, supra, Chapters 10, 12, 13, 16, 18 and 20, Colligan, Protein Science, supra. Chapters 12-14, all entirely incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Anti-IL-6 Antibodies<br>
An anti-IL-6 antibody according to the present invention includes any protein or peptide containing molecule that comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin molecule, such as but not limited to, at least one ligand binding portion (LBP), such as but not limited to, a complementarity determining region (CDR) of a heavy or light chain or a ligand binding portion thereof, a heavy chain or light chain variable region, a framework region (e.g., FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4 or fragment thereof, or as shown in SEQ ID NOS: 105-112, further optionally comprising at least one substitution, insertion or deletion), a heavy chain or light chain constant region, (e.g., comprising at least one CHI, hinge 1, hinge2, hinge3. hinge4, CH2, or CH3 or fragment thereof, further optionally comprising at least one substitution, insertion or deletion), or any portion thereof, that can be incorporated into an antibody of the present invention. An antibody of the invention can include<br><br>
or be derived from any mammal, such as but not limited to, a human, a mouse, a rabbit, a rat, a rodent, a primate, or any combination thereof, and the like.<br>
The isolated antibodies of the present invention comprise the antibody amino acid sequences disclosed herein encoded by any suitable polynucleotide, or any isolated or prepared antibody. Preferably, the human antibody or antigen-binding fragment binds human IL-6 and, thereby, partially or substantially neutralizes at least one biological activity of the protein. An antibody, or specified portion or variant thereof, that partially or preferably substantially neutralizes at least one biological activity of at least one IL-6 protein or fragment can bind the protein or fragment and thereby inhibit activities mediated through the binding of IL-6 to the IL-6 receptor or through other IL-6-dependent or mediated mechanisms. As used herein, the term "neutralizing antibody" refers to an antibody that can inhibit an IL-6-dependent activity by about 20-120%, preferably by at least about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100% or more depending on the assay. The capacity of an anti-IL-6 antibody to inhibit an IL-6-dependent activity is preferably assessed by at least one suitable IL-6 protein or receptor assay, as described herein and/or as known in the art. A human antibody of the invention can be of any class (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD, etc.) or isotype and can comprise a kappa or lambda light chain. In one embodiment, the human antibody comprises an IgG heavy chain or defined fragment, for example, at least one of isotypes, IgGl, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 (e.g., yl, y2, y3, or y4). Antibodies of this type can be prepared by employing a transgenic mouse or other trangenic non-human mammal comprising at least one human light chain (e.g., IgG, IgA, and IgM) transgenes as described herein and/or as known in the art. In another embodiment, the anti-human IL-6 human antibody comprises an IgGl heavy chain and an IgGl light chain.<br><br>
At least one antibody of the invention binds at least one specified epitope specific to at least one IL-6 protein, subunit, fragment, portion or any combination thereof. The at least one epitope can comprise at least one antibody binding region that comprises at least one portion of the protein, which epitope is preferably comprised of at least one extracellular, soluble, hydrophillic, external or cytoplasmic portion of the protein. The at least one specified epitope can comprise any combination of at least one amino acid sequence of at least 1 -3 amino acids to the entire specified portion of contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO:l 15, for example, amino acid residues 151-178, more specifically, residues 171-182.<br>
Generally, the human antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the present invention will comprise an antigen-binding region that comprises at least one human complementarity determining region (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) or variant of at least one heavy chain variable region and at least one human complementarity determining region (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) or variant of at least one light chain variable region. The CDR sequences may be derived from human germline sequences or closely match the germline sequences. For example, the CDRs from a synthetic library derived from the original mouse CDRs can be used.  These CDRs may be formed by incorporation of conservative substitutions from the orginal mouse sequence. As a non-limiting example, the antibody or antigen-binding portion or variant can comprise at least one of the heavy chain CDR3 having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consiting of SEQ ID NOS: 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, and 91, and/or a light chain CDR3 having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:29, 31, 33, and 35. In a particular embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment can have an antigen-binding region that comprises at least a portion of at least one heavy chain CDR (i.e., CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3) having the amino acid sequence of the corresponding CDRs 1, 2, and/or 3 (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:37, 49, and 79). In another<br><br>
particular embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding portion or variant can have an antigen-binding region that comprises at least a portion of at least one light chain CDR (i.e., CDR1, CDR2 and/or CDR3) having the amino acid sequence of the corresponding CDRs 1, 2 and/or 3 (e.g., SEQ ID NOS:l, 17, and 29).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the three heavy chain CDRs and the three light chain CDRs of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment have the amino acid sequence of the corresponding CDR of at least one of mAb AME-A9, AME-lb, AME-18a, AME-22a, AME-20b, AME-23a, and AME-19a, as described herein. Such antibodies can be prepared by chemically joining together the various portions (e.g., CDRs, framework) of the antibody using conventional techniques, by preparing and expressing a (i.e., one or more) nucleic acid molecule that encodes the antibody using conventional techniques of recombinant DNA technology or by using any other suitable method.<br>
The anti-IL-6 antibody can comprise at least one of a heavy or light chain variable region having a defined amino acid sequence. For example, in a preferred embodiment, the anti-IL-6 antibody comprises at least one of at least one heavy chain variable region, optionally having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:95, 99, 103, 118, 122, 126, and 130, and/or at least one light chain variable region, optionally having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:93, 97, 101, 116, 120, 124, and 128. Antibodies that bind to human IL-6 and that comprise a defined heavy or light chain variable region can be prepared using suitable methods, such as phage display (Katsube, Y., et al, Int J Mol. Med, l(J):863-868 (1998)) or methods that employ transgenic animals, as known in the art and/or as described herein. For example, a transgenic mouse, comprising a functionally rearranged human immunoglobulin heavy chain transgene and a transgene comprising DNA from a human<br><br>
immunoglobulin light chain locus that can undergo functional rearrangement, can be immunized with human IL-6 or a fragment thereof to elicit the production of antibodies. If desired, the antibody producing cells can be isolated and hybridomas or other immortalized antibody-producing cells can be prepared as described herein and/or as known in the art. Alternatively, the antibody, specified portion or variant can be expressed using the encoding nucleic acid or portion thereof in a suitable host cell.<br>
Amino Acid Codes<br>
The amino acids that make up anti-IL-6 antibodies of the present invention are often abbreviated. The amino acid designations can be indicated by designating the amino acid by its single letter code, its three letter code, name, or three nucleotide codon(s) as is well understood in the art (see Alberts, B., et al, Molecular Biology of The Cell, Third Ed., Garland Publishing, Inc., New York, 1994)<br>
An anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention can include one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions, either from natural mutations or human manipulation, as specified herein. Amino acids in an anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (e.g., Ausubel, supra, Chapters 8, 15; Cunningham and Wells, Science 244:1081-1085 (1989)). The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity, such as, but not limited to, at least one IL-6 neutralizing activity. Sites that are critical for antibody binding can also be identified by structural analysis, such as crystallization, nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling (Smith, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 224:899-904 (1992) and de Vos, et al., Science 255:306-312(1992)).<br><br>
Anti-IL-6 antibodies of the present invention can include, but are not limited to, at least one portion, sequence or combination selected from 5 to all of the contiguous amino acids of at least one of SEQ ID NOS: 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, etc.<br>
Non-limiting variants that can enhance or maintain at least one of the listed activities include, but are not limited to, any of the above polypeptides, further comprising at least one mutation corresponding to at least one substitution in the residues varied among the disclosed variant amino acid sequences.<br>
An anti-IL-6 antibody can further optionally comprise a polypeptide with an amino acid sequence that varies from the sequence of the contiguous amino acids of at least one of SEQ ID NOS:95, 99, and 103, etc (e.g., one or more convservative substitutions from the sequences provided herein). Also, the present invention comprises variants of the amino acid sequence of a light chain variable region of SEQ ID NOS:93, 97, or 101, or the amino acid sequence of a heavy chain of SEQ ID NOS: 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, or 91.<br>
As those of skill will appreciate, the present invention includes at least one biologically active antibody of the present invention. Biologically active antibodies have a specific activity at least 20%, 30%, or 40%, and, preferably, at least 50%, 60%, or 70%, and, most preferably, at least 80%, 90%, or 95%-1000% or more of that of the native (non-synthetic), endogenous or related and known antibody. Methods of assaying and quantifying measures of enzymatic activity and substrate specificity are well known to those of skill in the art.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to human antibodies and antigen-binding fragments, as described herein, which are modified by the covalent attachment of an organic moiety. Such modification can produce an antibody or antigen-binding fragment with improved pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., increased<br><br>
in vivo serum half-life). The organic moiety can be a linear or branched hydrophilic polymeric group, fatty acid group, or fatty acid ester group. In particular embodiments, the hydrophilic polymeric group can have a molecular weight of about 800 to about 120,000 Daltons and can be a polyalkane glycol (e.g.. polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG)), carbohydrate polymer, amino acid polymer or polyvinyl pyrolidone, and the fatty acid or fatty acid ester group can comprise from about eight to about forty carbon atoms.<br>
The modified antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the invention can comprise one or more organic moieties that are covalently bonded, directly or indirectly, to the antibody. Each organic moiety that is bonded to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention can independently be a hydrophilic polymeric group, a fatty acid group or a fatty acid ester group. As used herein, the term "fatty acid" encompasses mono-carboxylic acids and di-carboxylic acids. A "hydrophilic polymeric group," as the term is used herein, refers to an organic polymer that is more soluble in water than in octane. For example, polylysine is more soluble in water than in octane. Thus, an antibody modified by the covalent attachment of polylysine is encompassed by the invention. Hydrophilic polymers suitable for modifying antibodies of the invention can be linear or branched and include, for example, polyalkane glycols (e.g., PEG, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG), PPG and the like), carbohydrates (e.g., dextran, cellulose, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and the like), polymers of hydrophilic amino acids (e.g., polylysine, polyarginine, polyaspartate and the like), polyalkane oxides (e.g., polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide and the like) and polyvinyl pyrolidone. Preferably, the hydrophilic polymer that modifies the antibody of the invention has a molecular weight of about 800 to about 150,000 Daltons as a separate molecular entity. For example, PEG5000 and PEG20.000, wherein the subscript is the average molecular weight of the polymer in Daltons, can be used. The hydrophilic polymeric<br><br>
group can be substituted with one to about six alkyl, fatty acid or fatty acid ester groups. Hydrophilic polymers that are substituted with a fatty acid or fatty acid ester group can be prepared by employing suitable methods. For example, a polymer comprising an amine group can be coupled to a carboxylate of the fatty acid or fatty acid ester, and an activated carboxylate (e.g., activated with N, N-carbonyl diimidazole) on a fatty acid or fatty acid ester can be coupled to a hydroxyl group on a polymer.<br>
Fatty acids and fatty acid esters suitable for modifying antibodies of the invention can be saturated or can contain one or more units of unsaturation. Fatty acids that are suitable for modifying antibodies of the invention include, for example, n-dodecanoate (C12, laurate), n-tetradecanoate (C14, myristate), n- . octadecanoate (C18, stearate), n-eicosanoate (C20, arachidate), n-docosanoate (C22, behenate), n-triacontanoate (C30), n-tetracontanoate (C40), cis'-A9-octadecanoate (C18, oleate), all cw-A5,8,l 1,14-eicosatetraenoate (C20, arachidonate), octanedioic acid, tetradecanedioic acid, octadecanedioic acid, docosanedioic acid, and the like. Suitable fatty acid esters include mono-esters of dicarboxylic acids that comprise a linear or branched lower alkyl group. The lower alkyl group can comprise from one to about twelve, preferably, one to about six, carbon atoms.<br>
The modified human antibodies and antigen-binding fragments can be prepared using suitable methods, such as by reaction with one or more modifying agents. A "modifying agent" as the term is used herein, refers to a suitable organic group (e.g., hydrophilic polymer, a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester) that comprises an activating group. An "activating group" is a chemical moiety or functional group that can, under appropriate conditions, react with a second chemical group thereby forming a covalent bond between the modifying agent and the second chemical group. For example, amine-reactive activating groups include electrophilic groups,<br><br>
such as tosylate, mesylate, halo (chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo), N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters (NHS), and the like.   Activating groups that can react with thiols include, for example, maleimide, iodoacetyl, acrylolyl, pyridyl disulfides, 5-thiol-2-nitrobenzoic acid thiol (TNB-thiol), and the like. An aldehyde functional group can be coupled to amine- or hydrazide-containing molecules, and an azide group can react with a trivalent phosphorous group to form phosphoramidate or phosphorimide linkages. Suitable methods to introduce activating groups into molecules are known in the art (see for example, Hermanson, G. T., Biocunjugale Techniques, Academic Press: San Diego, CA (1996)). An activating group can be bonded directly to the organic group (e.g., hydrophilic polymer, fatty acid, fatty acid ester), or through a linker moiety, for example, a divalent C1-C12 group wherein one or more carbon atoms can be replaced by a heteroatom, such as oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur. Suitable linker moieties include, for example, tetraethylene glycol, -(CH?)3-, -NH-(CH2)6-NH-, -(CH2)2-NH- and -CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O-CH-NH-. Modifying agents that comprise a linker moiety can be produced, for example, by reacting a mono-Boc-alkyldiamine (e.g., mono-Boc-ethylenediamine, mono-Boc-diaminohexane) with a fatty acid in the presence of l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) to form an amide bond between the free amine and the fatty acid carboxylate. The Boc protecting group can be removed from the product by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to expose a primary amine that can be coupled to another carboxylate, as described, or can be reacted with maleic anhydride and the resulting product cyclized to produce an activated maleimido derivative of the fatty acid. (See, for example, Thompson, el a!., WO 92/16221, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
The modified antibodies of the invention can be produced by reacting a human antibody or antigen-binding fragment with a modifying agent. For example, the organic moieties can be bonded to the antibody in a non-site specific manner by<br><br>
employing an amine-reactive modifying agent, for example, an NHS ester of PEG. Modified human antibodies or antigen-binding fragments can also be prepared by reducing disulfide bonds (e.g., intra-chain disulfide bonds) of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment. The reduced antibody or antigen-binding fragment can then be reacted with a thiol-reactive modifying agent to produce the modified antibody of the invention. Modified human antibodies and antigen-binding fragments comprising an organic moiety that is bonded to specific sites of an antibody of the present invention can be prepared using suitable methods, such as reverse proteolysis (Fisch et al, Bioconjugate Chem., 3:147-153 (1992); Werlen et al, Bioconjugate Chem., 5:411-417 (1994); Kumaran et al, Protein Set 6(10):2233-2241 (1997); Itoh et al, Bioorg. Chem., 24(1): 59-68 (1996); Capellas et al, Biotechnol Bioeng., 56(4):456-463 (1997)), and the methods described in Hermanson, G. T., Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press: San Diego, CA (1996).<br>
Anti-Idiotype Antibodies to Anti-Il-6 Antibody Compositions<br>
In addition to monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibodies, the present invention is also directed to an anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibody specific for such antibodies of the invention. An anti-Id antibody is an antibody which recognizes unique determinants generally associated with the antigen-binding region of another antibody.  The anti-Id can be prepared by immunizing an animal of the same species and genetic type (e.g., mouse strain) as the source of the Id antibody with the antibody or a CDR containing region thereof. The immunized animal will recognize and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing antibody and produce an anti-Id antibody. The anti-Id antibody may also be used as an "immunogen" to induce an immune response in yet another animal, producing a so-called anti-anti-Id antibody.<br>
The present invention also provides at least one anti-IL-6 antibody composition comprising at least one. at least two, at least three., at least four, at least<br><br>
five, at least six or more anti-IL-6 antibodies thereof, as described herein and/or as known in the art that are provided in a non-naturally occurring composition, mixture or form. Such compositions comprise non-naturally occurring compositions comprising at least one or two full length, C- and/or N-terminally deleted variants, domains, fragments, or specified variants, of the anti-IL-6 antibody amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of 70-100% of the contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NOS:l-l 14 and 116-138, or specified fragments, domains or variants thereof Preferred anti-IL-6 antibody compositions include at least one or two full length, fragments, domains or variants as at least one CDR or LBP containing portions of the anti-IL-6 antibody sequence described herein, for example, 70-100% of SEQ ID NOS:15, 27, 35, 47, 61, and 91, or specified fragments, domains or variants thereof Further preferred compositions comprise, for example, 40-99% of at least one of 70-100% of SEQ ID NOS: 93, 95, 97, 99. 101, 103, etc., or specified fragments, domains or variants thereof.

The invention further comprises an article of manufacture, comprising packaging material, a first vial comprising lyophilized at least one anti-IL-6 antibody, and a second vial comprising an aqueous diluent of<br><br>
prescribed buffer or preservative, wherein said packaging material comprises a label that instructs a patient to reconstitute the at least one anti-IL-6 antibody in the aqueous diluent to form a solution that can be held over a period of twenty-four hours or greater.<br>
The at least one anti-IL-6 antibody used in accordance with the present invention can be produced by recombinant means, including from mammalian cell or transgenic preparations, or can be purified from other biological sources, as described herein or as known in the art.<br>
The range of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody in the product of the present invention includes amounts yielding upon reconstitution, if in a wet/dry system, concentrations from about 1.0 ug/ml to about 1000 mg/ml, although lower and higher concentrations are operable and are dependent on the intended delivery vehicle, e.g., solution formulations will differ from transdermal patch, pulmonary, transmucosal, or osmotic or micro pump methods.<br>

The presently claimed products are useful for human pharmaceutical product use.<br>
The formulations of the present invention can be prepared by a process that comprises mixing at least one anti-IL-6 antibody and a selected buffer, preferably, a phosphate buffer containing saline or a chosen salt. Mixing the at least one anti-IL-6 antibody and buffer in an aqueous diluent is carried out using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. To prepare a suitable formulation, for example, a measured amount of at least one antibody in water or buffer is combined with the<br><br>
desired buffering agent in water in quantities sufficient to provide the protein and buffer at the desired concentrations. Variations of this process would be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the order the components are added, whether additional additives are used, the temperature and pH at which the formulation is prepared, are all factors that can be optimized for the concentration and means of administration used.<br>
The claimed stable or preserved formulations can be provided to patients as clear solutions or as dual vials comprising a vial of lyophilized at least one anti-IL-6 antibody that is reconstituted with a second vial containing a preservative or buffer and excipients in an aqueous diluent. Either a single solution vial or dual vial requiring reconstitution can be reused multiple times and can suffice for a single or multiple cycles of patient treatment and thus provides a more convenient treatment regimen than currently available.<br>
Other formulations or methods of stablizing the anti-IL-6 antibody may result in other than a clear solution of lyophilized powder comprising the antibody. Among non-clear solutions are formulations comprising particulate suspensions, said particulates being a composition containing the anti-IL-6 antibody in a structure of variable dimension and known variously as a microsphere, microparticle, nanoparticle, nanosphere, or liposome. Such relatively homogenous, essentially spherical, particulate formulations containing an active agent can be formed by contacting an aqueous phase containing the active agent and a polymer and a nonaqueous phase followed by evaporation of the nonaqueous phase to cause the coalescence of particles from the aqueous phase as taught in U.S. 4,589,330. Porous microparticles can be prepared using a first phase containing active agent and a polymer dispersed in a continuous solvent and removing said solvent from the suspension by freeze-drying or dilution-extraction-precipitation as taught in U.S.<br><br>
4,818,542. Preferred polymers for such preparations are natural or synthetic copolymers or polymers selected from the group consisting of gleatin agar, starch, arabinogalactan, albumin, collagen, polyglycolic acid, polylactic aced, glycolide-L(-) lactide poly(episilon-caprolactone, poly(epsilon-caprolactone-CO-lactic acid), poly(epsilon-caprolactone-CO-glycolic acid), poly(B-hydroxy butyric acid), polyethylene oxide, polyethylene, poly(alkyl-2-cyanoacrylate), poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate), polyamides, poly(amino acids), poly(2-hydroxyethyl DL-aspartamide), poly(ester urea), poly(L-phenylalanine/ethylene glycol/1,6-diisocyanatohexane) and poly(methyl methacrylate). Particularly preferred polymers are polyesters, such as polyglycolic acid, polylactic aced, glycolide-L(-) lactide poly(episilon-caprolactone, poly(epsilon-caprolactone-CO-lactic acid), and poly(epsilon-caprolactone-CO-glycolic acid. Solvents useful for dissolving the polymer and/or the active include: water, hexafluoroisopropanol, methylenechloride, tetrahydrofuran, hexane, benzene, or hexafluoroacetone sesquihydrate. The process of dispersing the active containing phase with a second phase may include pressure forcing said first phase through an orifice in a nozzle to affect droplet formation.<br>
Dry powder formulations may result from processes other than lyophilization, such as by spray drying or solvent extraction by evaporation or by precipitation of a crystalline composition followed by one or more steps to remove aqueous or nonaqueous solvent. Preparation of a spray-dried antibody preparation is taught in U.S. 6,019,968. The antibody-based dry powder compositions may be produced by spray drying solutions or slurries of the antibody and, optionally, excipients, in a solvent under conditions to provide a respirable dry powder. Solvents may include polar compounds, such as water and ethanol, which may be readily dried. Antibody stability may be enhanced by performing the spray drying procedures in the absence of oxygen, such as under a nitrogen blanket or by using nitrogen as the diying gas. Another relatively dry formulation is a dispersion of a<br><br>
plurality of perforated microstructures dispersed in a suspension medium that typically comprises a hydrofluoroalkane propellant as taught in WO 9916419. The stabilized dispersions may be administered to the lung of a patient using a metered dose inhaler. Equipment useful in the commercial manufacture of spray dried medicaments are manufactured by Buchi Ltd. or Niro Corp.<br>

The present invention also provides a method for modulating or treating at least one IL-6 related wound, trauma or tissue injury or related chronic condition, in a cell, tissue, organ, animal or patient, including, but not limited to, at least one of: bodily injury or a trauma associated with oral surgery including periodontal surgery, tooth extraction(s), endodontic treatment, insertion of tooth implants, application and use of tooth prosthesis; or wherein the wound is selected from the group<br><br>
consisting of aseptic wounds, contused wounds, incised wounds, lacerated wounds, non-penetrating wounds, open wounds, penetrating wounds, perforating wounds, puncture wounds, septic wounds, infarctions and subcutaneous wounds; or wherein the wound is selected from the group consisting of ischemic ulcers, pressure sores, fistulae, severe bites, thermal burns and donor site wounds; or wherein the wound is an aphthous wound, a traumatic wound or a herpes associated wound.<br>
Wounds and/or ulcers are normally found protruding from the skin or on a mucosal surface or as a result of an infarction in an organ ("stroke"). A wound may be a result of a soft tissue defect or a lesion or of an underlying condition. In the present context, the term "skin" relates to the outermost surface of the body of an animal, including a human, and embraces intact or almost intact skin as well as an injured skin surface. The term "mucosa" relates to undamaged or damaged mucosa of an animal, such as a human, and may be the oral, buccal, aural, nasal, lung, eye, gastrointestinal, vaginal, or rectal mucosa.<br>
In the present context the term "wound" denotes a bodily injury with disruption of the normal integrity of tissue structures. The term is also intended to encompass the terms "sore," "lesion," "necrosis," and "ulcer." Normally, the term "sore" is a popular term for almost any lesion of the skin or mucous membranes and the term "ulcer" is a local defect, or excavation, of the surface of an organ or tissue, which is produced by the sloughing of necrotic tissue. Lesion generally relates to any tissue defect. Necrosis is related to dead tissue resulting from infection, injury, inflammation or infarctions.<br>
The term "wound" used in the present context denotes any wound (see below for a classification of wounds) and at any particular stage in the healing process, including the stage before any healing has initiated or even before a specific wound like a surgical incision is made (prophylactic treatment). Examples of wounds<br><br>
which can be prevented and/or treated in accordance with the present invention are, e.g., aseptic wounds, contused wounds, incised wounds, lacerated wounds, non-penetrating wounds (i.e., wounds in which there is no disruption of the skin but there is injury to underlying structures), open wounds, penetrating wounds, perforating wounds, puncture wounds, septic wounds, subcutaneous wounds, etc. Examples of sores are bed sores, canker sores, chrome sores, cold sores, pressure sores, etc. Examples of ulcers are, e.g., a peptic ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, gouty ulcer, diabetic ulcer, hypertensive ischemic ulcer, stasis ulcer, ulcus cruris (venous ulcer), sublingual ulcer, submucous ulcer, symptomatic ulcer, trophic ulcer, tropical ulcer, and veneral ulcer, e.g., caused by gonorrhoea (including urethritis, endocervicitis and proctitis). Conditions related to wounds or sores which may be successfully treated according to the invention are burns, anthrax, tetanus, gas gangrene, scarlatina, erysipelas, sycosis barbae, folliculitis, impetigo contagiosa, or impetigo bullosa, etc. There is often a certain overlap between the use of the terms "wound" and "ulcer" and "wound" and "sore" and, furthermore, the terms are often used at random. Therefore, as mentioned above, in the present context the term "wound" encompasses the terms "ulcer," "lesion," "sore" and "infarction," and the terms are indiscriminately used unless otherwise indicated.<br>
The kinds of wounds to be treated according to the invention include also (i) general wounds, such as, e.g., surgical, traumatic, infectious, ischemic, thermal, chemical and bullous wounds; (ii) wounds specific for the oral cavity, such as, e.g., post-extraction wounds, endodontic wounds especially in connection with treatment of cysts and abscesses, ulcers and lesions of bacterial, viral or autoimmunological origin, mechanical, chemical, thermal, infectious and lichenoid wounds; herpes ulcers, stomatitis aphthosa, acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitis and burning mouth syndrome are specific examples; and (iii) wounds on the skin, such as, e.g., neoplasm, burns (e.g. chemical, thermal), lesions (bacterial, viral,<br><br>
autoimmunological), bites and surgical incisions. Another way of classifying wounds is as (i) small tissue loss due to surgical incisions, minor abrasions and minor bites, or as (ii) significant tissue loss. The latter group includes ischemic ulcers, pressure sores, fistulae, lacerations, severe bites, thermal burns and donor site wounds (in soft and hard tissues) and infarctions.   •<br>
Other wounds that are of importance in connection with the present invention are wounds like ischemic ulcers, pressure sores, fistulae, severe bites, thermal burns and donor site wounds. Ischemic ulcers and pressure sores are wounds which normally only heal very slowly and especially in such cases, an improved and more rapid healing process is of course of great importance for the patient. Furthermore, the costs involved in the treatment of patients suffering from such wounds are markedly reduced when the healing is improved and takes place more rapidly.<br>
Donor site wounds are wounds which, e.g., occur in connection with removal of hard tissue from one part of the body to another part of the body, e.g., in comiection with transplantation. The wounds resulting from such operations are very painful and an improved healing is therefore most valuable. The term "skin" is used in a very broad sense embracing the epidermal layer of the skin and ---- in those cases where the skin surface is more or less injured — also the dermal layer of the skin. Apart from the stratum corneum, the epidermal layer of the skin is the outer (epithelial) layer and the deeper connective tissue layer of the skin is called the dermis.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for modulating or treating osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythmatosus, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, among the other diseases listed above as IL-6 related, in a cell, tissue, organ, animal, or patient including, but not limited to, at least one of immune related disease,<br><br>
cardiovascular disease, infectious, malignant and/or neurologic disease. Such a method can optionally comprise administering an effective amount of at least one composition or pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one anti-IL-6 antibody to a cell, tissue, organ, animal or patient in need of such modulation, treatment or therapy.<br>
Any method of the present invention can comprise administering an effective amount of a composition or pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one anti-IL-6 antibody to a cell, tissue, organ, animal or patient in need of such modulation, treatment or therapy. Such a method can optionally further comprise co-administration or combination therapy for treating such diseases or disorders, wherein the administering of said at least one anti-IL-6 antibody, specified portion or variant thereof, further comprises administering, before concurrently, and/or after, at least one selected from at least one TNF antagonist (e.g., but not limited to, a TNF chemical or protein antagonist, TNF monoclonal or polyclonal antibody or fragment, a soluble TNF receptor (e.g., p55, p70 or p85) or fragment, fusion polypeptides thereof, or a small molecule TNF antagonist, e.g., TNF binding protein I or II (TBP-1 or TBP-II), nerelimonmab, infliximab, etanercept (Enbrel™), adalimulab (Humira™), CDP-571, CDP-870, afelimomab, lenercept, and the like), an antirheumatic (e.g., methotrexate, auranofin, aurothioglucose, azathioprine, gold sodium thiomalate, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, leflunomide, sulfasalzine), a muscle relaxant, a narcotic, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), an analgesic, an anesthetic, a sedative, a local anesthetic, a neuromuscular blocker, an antimicrobial (e.g., aminoglycoside, an antifungal, an antiparasitic, an antiviral, a carbapenem, cephalosporin, a flurorquinolone, a macrolide, a penicillin, a sulfonamide, a tetracycline, another antimicrobial), an antipsoriatic, a corticosteriod, an anabolic steroid, a diabetes related agent, a mineral, a nutritional, a thyroid agent, a vitamin, a calcium related hormone, an antidiarrheal, an antitussive, an antiemetic, an antiulcer,<br><br>

As used herein, a "tumor necrosis factor antibody," "TNF antibody," "TNFa antibody," or fragment and the like decreases, blocks, inhibits, abrogates or interferes with TNFa activity in vitro, in situ and/or, preferably, in vivo. For example, a suitable TNF human antibody of the present invention can bind TNFa and includes anti-TNF antibodies, antigen-binding fragments thereof, and specified mutants or domains thereof that bind specifically to TNFa. A suitable TNF antibody or fragment can also decrease block, abrogate, interfere, prevent and/or inhibit TNF RNA, DNA or protein synthesis, TNF release, TNF receptor signaling, membrane TNF cleavage, TNF activity, TNF production and/or synthesis.<br>
An example of a TNF antibody or antagonist is the chimeric antibody cA2. Additional examples of monoclonal anti-TNF antibodies that can be used in the present invention are described in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,231,024; Moller, A. et al, Cytokine 2(3):162-169 (1990); U.S. Application No. 07/943,852 (filed September 11, 1992); Rathjen et al., International Publication No. WO 91/02078 (published February 21, 1991); Rubin et al, EPO Patent Publication No. 0 218 868 (published April 22, 1987); Yone et al, EPO Patent Publication No. 0 288 088 (October 26, 1988); Liang, eta!., Biochem.

Immunol. Meth. 96:57-62 (1987).<br><br>
TNF Receptor Molecules<br>
Preferred TNF receptor molecules useful in the present invention are those that bind TNFa with high affinity (see, e.g., Feldmann et al, International Publication No. WO 92/07076 (published April 30, 1992); Schall et al, Cell 67:361-370 (1990); and Loetscher et al, Cell 61:351-359 (1990), which references are entirely incorporated herein by reference) and optionally possess low immunogenicity. In particular, the 55 kDa (p55 TNF-R) and the 75 kDa (p75 TNF-R) TNF cell surface receptors are useful in the present invention. Truncated forms of these receptors, comprising the extracellular domains (ECD) of the receptors or functional portions thereof (see, e.g., Corcoran et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 223:831-840 (1994)), are also useful in the present invention. Truncated forms of the TNF receptors, comprising the ECD, have been detected in urine and serum as 30 kDa and 40 kDa TNFa inhibitory binding proteins (Engelmann, H. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2(55:1531-1536 (1990)). TNF receptor multimeric molecules and TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecules, and derivatives and fragments or portions thereof, are additional examples of TNF receptor molecules which are useful in the methods and compositions of the present invention.<br>
TNF receptor multimeric molecules useful in the present invention comprise all or a functional portion of the ECD of two or more TNF receptors linked via one or more polypeptide linkers or other nonpeptide linkers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). An example of such a TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecule is TNF receptor/IgG fusion protein. TNF immunoreceptor fusion molecules and methods for their production have been described in the art (Lesslauer et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 27:2883-2886 (1991); Ashkenazi et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 55:10535-10539 (1991); Peppel et al, J. Exp. Med. 774:1483-1489 (1991); Kolls et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Pi:215-219 (1994); Butler et al, Cytokine 6(6):616-623 (1994);<br><br>

Such drugs are well known in the art, including formulations, indications, dosing and administration for each presented herein (see., e.g., Nursing 2001 Handbook of Drugs, 21st edition, Springhouse Corp., Springhouse, PA, 2001; Health Professional's Drug Guide 2001, ed., Shannon, Wilson, Stang, Prentice-Hall, Inc, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Pharmcotherapy Handbook, Wells et al., ed., Appleton &amp; Lange, Stamford, CT, each entirely incorporated herein by reference).<br><br>
Typically, treatment of pathologic conditions is effected by administering an effective amount or dosage of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody composition that total, on average, a range from at least about 0.01 to 500 milligrams of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody per kilogram of patient per dose, and, preferably, from at least about 0.1 to 100 milligrams antibody/kilogram of patient per single or multiple administration, depending upon the specific activity of the active agent contained in the composition. Alternatively, the effective serum concentration can comprise 0.1-5000 ug/ml serum concentration per single or multiple adminstration. Suitable dosages are known to medical practitioners and will, of course, depend upon the particular disease slate, specific activity of the composition being administered, and the particular patient undergoing treatment. In some instances, to achieve the desired therapeutic amount, it can be necessary to provide for repeated administration, i.e., repeated individual administrations of a particular monitored or metered dose, where the individual administrations are repeated until the desired daily dose or effect is achieved.<br>
Preferred doses can optionally include about 0.1-99 and/or 100-500 mg/kg/administration, or any range, value or fraction thereof, or to achieve a serum concentration of about 0.1-5000 ug/ml serum concentration per single or multiple administration, or any range, value or fraction thereof. A preferred dosage range for the anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention is from about 1 mg/kg, up to about 3, about 6 or about 12 mg/kg of body weight of the patient.<br>
Alternatively, the dosage administered can vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent, and its mode and route of administration; age, health, and weight of the recipient; nature and extent of symptoms, kind of concurrent treatment, frequency of treatment, and the effect desired. Usually a dosage of active ingredient can be about 0.1 to 100 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Ordinarily 0.1 to 50, and, preferably, 0.1 to<br><br>
10 milligrams per kilogram per administration or in sustained release form is effective to obtain desired results.<br>
As a non-limiting example, treatment of humans or animals can be provided as a one-time or periodic dosage of at least one antibody of the present invention about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg or any range, value or fraction thereof per day, on at least one of day 1- 40, or, alternatively or additionally, at least one of week 1 52, or, alternatively or additionally, at least one of 1-20 years, or any combination thereof, using single, infusion or repeated doses.<br>
Dosage forms (composition) suitable for internal administration generally contain from about 0.001 milligram to about 500 milligrams of active ingredient per unit or container. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5-99.999% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
For parenteral administration, the antibody can be formulated as a solution, suspension, emulsion, particle, powder, or lyophilized powder in association, or separately provided, with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle. Examples of such vehicles are water, saline. Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, and about 1-10% human serum albumin. Liposomes and nonaqueous vehicles, such as fixed oils, can also be used. The vehicle or lyophilized powder can contain additives that maintain isotonicity (e.g., sodium chloride, mannitol) and chemical stability (e.g., buffers and preservatives). The formulation is sterilized by known or suitable techniques.<br>

While pulmonary administration is used in the following description, other modes of administration can be used according to the present invention with suitable results. IL-6 antibodies of the present invention can be delivered in a earner, as a solution, emulsion, colloid, or suspension, or as a dry powder, using any of a variety of devices and methods suitable for administration by inhalation or other modes described here within or known in the art.<br>
Parenteral Formulations and Administration<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration can contain as common excipients sterile water or saline, polyalkylene glycols, such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, hydrogenated naphthalenes and the like. Aqueous or oily suspensions for injection can be prepared by using an appropriate emulsifier or humidifier and a suspending agent, according to known methods. Agents for injection can be a non-toxic, non-orally administrable diluting agent, such as aqueous solution, a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a solvent. As the usable vehicle or solvent, water, Ringer's solution, isotonic saline, etc. are allowed; as an ordinary solvent or suspending solvent, sterile involatile oil can be used. For these purposes, any kind of involatile oil and fatty acid can be used, including natural or synthetic or semisynthetic fatty oils or fatty acids; natural or synthetic or semisynthtetic mono- or di- or tri-glycerides. Parental administration is known in the art and includes, but is not limited to, conventional means of injections, a gas pressured needle-less injection device as described in U.S. Pat.

Alternative Delivery<br>
The invention further relates to the administration of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody by parenteral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intrarticular, intrabronchial, intraabdominal, intracapsular, intracartilaginous, intracavitary, intracelial, intracerebellar, intracerebroventricular, intracolic, intracervical, intragastric, intrahepatic, intramyocardial, intraosteal, intrapelvic, intrapericardiac, intraperitoneal, intrapleural, intraprostatic, intrapulmonary, intrarectal, intrarenal, intraretinal, intraspinal, intrasynovial, intrathoracic, intrauterine, intravesical, intralesional, bolus, vaginal, rectal, buccal, sublingual, intranasal, or transdermal means. At least one anti-IL-6 antibody composition can be prepared for use for parenteral (subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous) or any other administration particularly in the form of liquid solutions or suspensions; for use in vaginal or rectal administration particularly in semisolid forms, such as, but not limited to, creams and suppositories; for buccal, or sublingual administration, such as, but not limited to, in the form of tablets or capsules; or intranasally, such as, but not limited to, the form of powders, nasal drops or aerosols or certain agents; or transdermally, such as not limited to a gel, ointment, lotion, suspension or patch delivery system with chemical enhancers such as dimethyl sulfoxide to either modify the skin structure or to increase the drug concentration in the transdermal patch (Junginger, et al. In "Drug Permeation Enhancement;" Hsieh, D. S., Eds., pp. 59-90 (Marcel Dekker. Inc. New York 1994, entirely incorporated herein by reference), or with oxidizing agents that enable the application of formulations containing proteins and peptides onto the skin (WO 98/53847), or applications of electric fields to create transient transport pathways, such as electroporation, or to increase the mobility of charged drugs<br><br>
through the skin, such as iontophoresis, or application of ultrasound, such as sonophoresis (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,309,989 and 4,767,402) (the above publications and patents being entirely incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Pulmonary/Nasal Administration<br>
For pulmonary administration, preferably, at least one anti-IL-6 antibody composition is delivered in a particle size effective for reaching the lower airways of the lung or sinuses. According to the invention, at least one anti-IL-6 antibody can be delivered by any of a variety of inhalation or nasal devices known in the art for administration of a therapeutic agent by inhalation. These devices capable of depositing aerosolized formulations in the sinus cavity or alveoli of a patient include metered dose inhalers, nebulizers, dry powder generators, sprayers, and the like. Other devices suitable for directing the pulmonary or nasal administration of antibodies are also known in the art. All such devices can use formulations suitable for the administration for the dispensing of antibody in an aerosol. Such aerosols can be comprised of either solutions (both aqueous and non aqueous) or solid particles.<br>
Metered dose inhalers like the Ventolin® metered dose inhaler, typically use a propellent gas and require actuation during inspiration (See, e.g., WO 94/16970, WO 98/35888). Dry powder inhalers like Turbuhaler™ (Astra), Rotahaler® (Glaxo), Diskus" (Glaxo), Spiros™ inhaler (Dura), devices marketed by Inhale Therapeutics, and the Spinhaler' powder inhaler (Fisons), use breath-actuation of a mixed powder (US 4668218 Astra, EP 237507 Astra, WO 97/25086 Glaxo, WO 94/08552 Dura, US 5458135 Inhale, WO 94/06498 Fisons, entirely incorporated herein by reference). Nebulizers like AERx™ Aradigm, the Ultravent® nebulizer (Mallinckrodf), and the Acorn II® nebulizer (Marquest Medical Products) (US 5404871 Aradigm, WO 97/22376), the above references entirely incorporated herein<br><br>
by reference, produce aerosols from solutions, while metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, etc. generate small particle aerosols. These specific examples of commercially available inhalation devices are intended to be a representative of specific devices suitable for the practice of this invention, and are not intended as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Preferably, a composition comprising at least one anti-IL-6 antibody is delivered by a dry powder inhaler or a sprayer. There are several desirable features of an inhalation device for administering at least one antibody of the present invention. For example, delivery by the inhalation device is advantageously reliable, reproducible, and accurate. The inhalation device can optionally deliver small dry particles, e.g., less than about 10 μm, preferably about 1-5 urn, for good respirability.<br>
Administration of IL-6 Antibody Compositions as a Spray<br>
A spray including IL-6 antibody composition can be produced by forcing a suspension or solution of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody through a nozzle under pressure. The nozzle size and configuration, the applied pressure, and the liquid feed rate can be chosen to achieve the desired output and particle size. An electrospray can be produced, for example, by an electric field in connection with a capillary or nozzle feed. Advantageously, particles of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody composition delivered by a sprayer have a particle size less than about 10 μm, preferably, in the range of about 1 jam to about 5 μm, and, most preferably, about 2 μm to about 3 μm.<br><br>
Formulations of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody composition suitable for use with a sprayer typically include antibody composition in an aqueous solution at a concentration of about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody composition per ml of solution or mg/gm, or any range, value, or fraction therein. The formulation can include agents, such as an excipient, a buffer, an isotonicity agent, a preservative, a surfactant, and, preferably, zinc. The formulation can also include an excipient or agent for stabilization of the antibody composition, such as a buffer, a reducing agent, a bulk protein, or a carbohydrate. Bulk proteins useful in formulating antibody compositions include albumin, protamine, or the like. Typical carbohydrates useful in formulating antibody compositions include sucrose, mannitol, lactose, trehalose, glucose, or the like. The antibody composition formulation can also include a surfactant, which can reduce or prevent surface-induced aggregation of the antibody composition caused by atomization of the solution in forming an aerosol. Various conventional surfactants can be employed, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters and alcohols, and polyoxyethylene sorbitol fatty acid esters. Amounts will generally range between 0.001 and 14% by weight of the formulation. Especially preferred surfactants for purposes of this invention are polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, polysorbate 80, polysorbate 20, or the like. Additional agents known in the art for formulation of a protein, such as 1L-6 antibodies, or specified portions or variants, can also be included in the formulation.<br>
Administration of IL-6 antibody compositions by a Nebulizer<br>
Antibody compositions of the invention can be administered by a nebulizer, such as jet nebulizer or an ultrasonic nebulizer. Typically, in a jet nebulizer, a compressed air source is used to create a high-velocity air jet through an orifice. As the gas expands beyond the nozzle, a low-pressure region is created, which draws a solution of antibody composition through a capillary tube connected to a liquid<br><br>
reservoir. The liquid stream from the capillary tube is sheared into unstable filaments and droplets as it exits the tube, creating the aerosol. A range of configurations, flow rates, and baffle types can be employed to achieve the desired performance characteristics from a given jet nebulizer. In an ultrasonic nebulizer, high-frequency electrical energy is used to create vibrational, mechanical energy, typically employing a piezoelectric transducer. This energy is transmitted to the formulation of antibody composition either directly or through a coupling fluid, creating an aerosol including the antibody composition. Advantageously, particles of antibody composition delivered by a nebulizer have a particle size less than about 10 μm, preferably, in the range of about 1 μm to about 5 μm, and, most preferably, about 2 μm to about 3 jam.<br>
Formulations of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody suitable for use with a nebulizer, either jet or ultrasonic, typically include a concentration of about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody protein per ml of solution. The formulation can include agents, such as an excipient, a buffer, an isotonicity agent, a preservative, a surfactant, and, preferably, zinc. The formulation can also include an excipient or agent for stabilization of the at least one anti-IL-6 antibody composition, such as a buffer, a reducing agent, a bulk protein, or a carbohydrate. Bulk proteins useful in formulating at least one anti-IL-6 antibody compositions include albumin, protamine, or the like. Typical carbohydrates useful in formulating at least one anti-IL-6 antibody include sucrose, mannitol, lactose, trehalose, glucose, or the like. The at least one anti-IL-6 antibody formulation can also include a surfactant, which can reduce or prevent surface-induced aggregation of the at least one anti-IL-6 antibody caused by atomization of the solution in forming an aerosol. Various conventional surfactants can be employed, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters and alcohols, and polyoxyethylene sorbital fatty acid esters. Amounts will generally range between about 0.001 and 4% by weight of the formulation. Especially preferred<br><br>
surfactants for purposes of this invention are polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate, polysorbate 80, polysorbate 20, or the like. Additional agents known in the art for formulation of a protein, such as antibody protein, can also be included in the formulation.<br>
Administration of IL-6 antibody compositions By A Metered Dose Inhaler<br>
In a metered dose inhaler (MDI), a propellant, at least one anti-IL-6 antibody, and any excipients or other additives are contained in a canister as a mixture including a liquefied compressed gas. Actuation of the metering valve releases the mixture as an aerosol, preferably containing particles in the size range of less than about 10 urn, preferably, about 1 μm to about 5 μm, and, most preferably, about 2 μm to about 3 μm. The desired aerosol particle size can be obtained by employing a formulation of antibody composition produced by various methods known to those of skill in the art, including jet-milling, spray drying, critical point condensation, or the like. Preferred metered dose inhalers include those manufactured by 3M or Glaxo and employing a hydrofluorocarbon propellant. Formulations of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody for use with a metered-dose inhaler device will generally include a finely divided powder containing at least one anti-IL-6 antibody as a suspension in a non-aqueous medium, for example, suspended in a propellant with the aid of a surfactant. The propellant can be any conventional material employed for this purpose, such as chlorofluorocarbon, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon, a hydrofluorocarbon, or a hydrocarbon, including trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethanol and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, HFA-134a (hydrofluroalkane-134a), HFA-227 (hydrofluroalkane-227), or the like. Preferably, the propellant is a hydrofluorocarbon. The surfactant can be chosen to stabilize the at least one anti-IL-6 antibody as a suspension in the propellant, to<br><br>
protect the active agent against chemical degradation, and the like. Suitable surfactants include sorbitan trioleate, soya lecithin, oleic acid, or the like. In some cases, solution aerosols are preferred using solvents, such as ethanol. Additional agents known in the art for formulation of a protein can also be included in the formulation. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the methods of the current invention can be achieved by pulmonary administration of at least one anti-IL-6 antibody composition via devices not described herein.<br>
Oral Formulations and Administration<br>
Formulations for oral administration rely on the co-administration of adjuvants (e.g., resorcinols and nonionic surfactants, such as polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecylpolyethylene ether) to increase artificially the permeability of the intestinal walls, as well as the co-administration of enzymatic inhibitors (e.g., pancreatic trypsin inhibitors, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFF) and trasylol) to inhibit enzymatic degradation. Formulations for delivery of hydrophilic agents including proteins and antibodies and a combination of at least two surfactants intended for oral, buccal, mucosal, nasal, pulmonary, vaginal transmembrane, or rectal administration are taught in U.S. 6,309,663. The active constituent compound of the solid-type dosage form for oral administration can be mixed with at least one additive, including sucrose, lactose, cellulose, mannitol, trehalose, raffmose, maltitol, dextran, starches, agar, arginates, chitins, chitosans, pectins, gum tragacanth, gum arabic, gelatin, collagen, casein, albumin, synthetic or semisynthetic polymer, and glyceride. These dosage forms can also contain other type(s) of additives, e.g., inactive diluting agent, lubricant, such as magnesium stearate, paraben, preserving agent, such as sorbic acid, ascorbic acid, .alpha.-tocopherol, antioxidant such as cysteine, disintegrator, binder, thickener, buffering agent, sweetening agent, flavoring agent, perfuming agent, etc.<br><br>
Tablets and pills can be further processed into enteric-coated preparations. The liquid preparations for oral administration include emulsion, syrup, elixir, suspension and solution preparations allowable for medical use. These preparations can contain inactive diluting agents ordinarily used in said field, e.g., water. Liposomes have also been described as drug delivery systems for insulin and heparin (U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,754). More recently, microspheres of artificial polymers of mixed amino acids (proteinoids) have been used to deliver pharmaceuticals (U.S. Pat. No. 4,925,673). Furthermore, carrier compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,879,681 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,5,871,753 and used to deliver biologically active agents orally are known in the art.<br>
Mucosal Formulations and Administration<br>
A formulation for orally administering a bioactive agent encapsulated in one or more biocompatible polymer or copolymer excipients, preferably, a biodegradable polymer or copolymer, affording microcapsules which due to the proper size of the resultant microcapsules results in the agent reaching and being taken up by the folliculi lymphatic aggregati, otherwise known as the "Peyer's patch," or "GALT" of the animal without loss of effectiveness due to the agent having passed through the gastrointestinal tract. Similar folliculi lymphatic aggregati can be found in the bronchei tubes (BALT) and the large intestine. The above-described tissues are referred to in general as mucosally associated lymphoreticular tissues (MALT). For absorption through mucosal surfaces, compositions and methods of administering at least one anti-IL-6 antibody include an emulsion comprising a plurality of submicron particles, a mucoadhesive macromolecule, a bioactive peptide, and an aqueous continuous phase, which promotes absorption through mucosal surfaces by achieving mucoadhesion of the emulsion particles (U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,670). Mucous surfaces suitable for application of the emulsions of the present invention<br><br>
can include corneal, conjunctival, buccal, sublingual, nasal, vaginal, pulmonary, stomachic, intestinal, and rectal routes of administration. Formulations for vaginal or rectal administration, e.g., suppositories, can contain as excipients, for example, polyalkyleneglycols, vaseline, cocoa butter, and the like. Formulations for intranasal administration can be solid and contain as excipients, for example, lactose or can be aqueous or oily solutions of nasal drops. For buccal administration, excipients include sugars, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, pregelinatined starch, and the like (U.S. Pat. No. 5,849,695).<br>
Transdermal Formulations and Administration<br>
For transdermal administration, the at least one anti-IL-6 antibody is encapsulated in a delivery device, such as a liposome or polymeric nanoparticles, microparticle, microcapsule, or microspheres (referred to collectively as microparticles unless otherwise stated). A number of suitable devices are known, including microparticles made of synthetic polymers, such as polyhydroxy acids, such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid and copolymers thereof, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, and polyphosphazenes, and natural polymers, such as collagen, polyamino acids, albumin and other proteins, alginate and other polysaccharides, and combinations thereof (U.S. Pat. No. 5,814,599).<br>
Prolonged Administration and Formulations<br>
It can be desirable to deliver the compounds of the present invention to the subject over prolonged periods of time, for example, for periods of one week to one year from a single administration. Various slow release, depot or implant dosage<br><br>
forms can be utilized. For example, a dosage form can contain a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salt of the compounds that has a low degree of solubility in body fluids, for example, (a) an acid addition salt with a polybasic acid, such as phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, tannic acid, pamoic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalene mono- or di-sulfonic acids, polygalacturonic acid, and the like; (b) a salt with a polyvalent metal cation, such as zinc, calcium, bismuth, barium, magnesium, aluminum, copper, cobalt, nickel, cadmium and the like, or with an organic cation formed from e.g., N,N'-dibenzyl-ethylenediamine or ethylenediamine; or (c) combinations of (a) and (b), e.g., a zinc tannate salt. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention or, preferably, a relatively insoluble salt, such as those just described, can be formulated in a gel, for example, an aluminum monostearate gel with, e.g., sesame oil, suitable for injection. Particularly preferred salts are zinc salts, zinc tannate salts, pamoate salts, and the like. Another type of slow release depot formulation for injection would contain the compound or salt dispersed for encapsulation in a slow degrading, non-toxic, non-antigenic polymer, such as a polylactic acid/polyglycolic acid polymer for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919. The compounds or, preferably, relatively insoluble salts, such as those described above, can also be formulated in cholesterol matrix silastic pellets, particularly for use in animals. Additional slow release, depot or implant formulations, e.g., gas or liquid liposomes, are known in the literature (U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,222 and "Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems", J. R. Robinson ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., N.Y., 1978).<br>
Having generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended as limiting.<br>
Indications<br><br>
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)<br>
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease with autoimmune features. A number of the features of RA may be explained through an action of dysregulated IL-6.<br>
IL-6 actions of potential relevance in RA include induction of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody production (rheumatoid factor), through the actions of IL-6 as a B cell differentiation factor; the promotion of cytotoxic T cell development, in concert with IL-2; the production of acute phase proteins (CRP. SAA, fibrinogen), through hepatocyte stimulating activity; osteoclast activation, leading to periarticular osteoporosis and bone destruction; the induction of thrombocytosis, through action as megakaryocyte differentiation factor; and regulation of VEGF, and therefore potentially angiogenesis, in concert with IL-ip and TNFa.<br>
IL-6 is produced by RA synovial fibroblasts stimulated by TNFa or IL-1, and is present at high concentration in both synovial fluid (SF) and serum in RA. Correlations exist between serum levels and clinical / laboratory indices of disease activity.<br>
Anti-IL-6/IL-6R mAbs were studied in several clinical studies in patients with active RA. Results to date are briefly described below.<br>
Phase I/II studies<br>
In the first of these studies, a murine anti-IL-6 mAb (BE-8) was administered daily for 10 consecutive days in 5 patients with RA and was associated with<br><br>
transitory clinical and laboratory improvement (9) ( Wendling, D; et al. 1993 J. Rheumatol. 20:259). The humanized anti-IL-6R (80kDa) mAb (MRA; Chugai) was tested in several phase I/II studies in patients with RA. In the first of these, MRA was administered by IV infusion at doses of 1-50 mg once or twice a week, with maintenance treatment of 50 mg per week for up to 6 months. This resulted in rapid decreases in the acute phase measures, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen, and in low-grade fever, fatigue, and clinical scores, such as morning stiffness and swollen and tender joint counts. Also noted were improvements in anemia, thrombocytosis and hypergammaglobulinemia. In a subsequent study, 45 patients were treated with a single IV infusion of MRA at a dose of 0.1-10 mg/kg, and resulted in trends of improvement in clinical scores at higher dose levels, plus reductions in acute phase reactants.<br>
Phase II studies<br>
In the first of these studies, 15 patients were treated with MRA (dose levels 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg biweekly for 24 weeks), and showed ACR20 responses in 13/15 at week 24, with normalization of CRP/Serum Amyloid A (SAA). Although there were no major acute safety concerns, up to two thirds of patients showed markedly increased LDL cholesterol levels. In a second phase II study, 164 patents with RA resistant to DMARDs were treated with placebo or MRA by IV infusion (dose levels 4 or 8 mg/kg, given every 4 weeks for 3 months), and showed ACR20 response rates at week 12 of 11%, 57%, and 78% for placebo, 4 and 8 mg/kg, respectively. Finally, 359 patients with active RA received MTX alone (10-25 mg/week), MRA alone (dose levels 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg, administered monthly by IV infusion) or MTX plus MRA. MRA and MRA + MTX were more effective than MTX alone, as determined by ACR20 response.<br><br>
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)<br>
SLE is a chronic, potentially fatal, autoimmune disease with multiple protean manifestations. The etiology is unknown. One hallmark of the disease involves B cell hyperproliferation, activation, and autoantibody production against a variety of self-antigens.<br>
IL-6 induces B cells to differentiate into antibody forming cells. In SLE, there is increased production of autoantibodies (ANA, anti-dsDNA) by these antibody forming cells and immune complex deposition. IL-6 promotes cytotoxic T cell development, increases hepatic acute phase reactants, mesangial cell proliferation, keratinocyte growth, megakaryocyte differentiation and thrombosis.<br>
IL-6 levels are elevated in both SLE patients and murine SLE models. It was demonstrated that IL-6 receptor binding on B cells induces terminal differentiation of B cells into autoantibody producing cells. Linker-Israeli et al. (Linker-Israeli M et al., 1991 J Immunol 147: 117-123) have shown decreases in spontaneous polyclonal antibody production when neutralizing antibodies against IL-6 were used. Kitani and others (Kitani A, et al., 1992 Clin Exp Immunol 88: 75-83) supported these findings by demonstrating that in vitro T cell production of IL-6 doubled in SLE cultures and that SLE B cells had five fold more IL- 6 production than control B cells. However, the pathologic production of autoantibodies in SLE is not solely limited to the effects of IL-6. The role of the IL-6 receptor has been studied also. Nagafuchi and others showed IL-6 receptor up regulation in the majority of SLE B cells vs. normal B cells. Anti-IL-6 receptor antibody inhibited terminal differentiation of these B cells into antibody forming cells. The role of the soluble IL-6 receptor in SLE has yet to be determined.<br><br>
Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)<br>
Insulin resistance (impaired insulin action) and impaired P-cell function (functional deficit of pancreatic p-cells to secrete insulin) are considered to be the main causes of T2DM development. Insulin resistance is manifested as an inability of peripheral tissues to respond adequately to insulin challenge, thus causing an increase in blood glucose levels. The increase in insulin resistance and blood glucose levels is followed by compensatory hyper-secretion of insulin by pancreatic p-cells in the early stages of the disease. As T2DM progresses, the ability of P-cells to secrete insulin deteriorates.<br>
The underlining mechanisms responsible for the development of insulin resistance are unclear. The one condition most commonly associated with the development of T2DM is obesity and even a modest weight loss significantly improves glucose levels in patients with T2DM.<br>
Both obesity and insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, in combination with dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension characterized the condition called Metabolic Syndrome. The natural progression of Metabolic Syndrome to T2DM predisposes individuals to development of micro- and macro-vascular changes that may lead to cardiovascular (CV) disease and ultimately death. Obesity, insulin resistance, and hyper-insulinemia have been suggested to be the most likely links between T2DM and CV disease.<br>
Adipose tissue has been identified as one of the major organs that regulates metabolism, being both an energy storage depot and endocrine organ that secretes numerous molecules involved in insulin sensitivity regulation. In addition to leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and TNFa, adipose tissue secretes IL-6, which has been<br><br>
suggested to represent the link between obesity, inflammation, T2DM and cardiovascular (CV) disease.<br>
A positive correlation between adiposity and IL-6 levels has been documented. It is possible that increased adipose tissue in obesity may provide sustained increases in circulating IL-6 that could decrease insulin sensitivity by promoting inflammation in insulin-responsive tissues or cause insulin resistance by interfering with activity and expression of proteins involved in the insulin-signaling cascade. Both in vitro and in vivo data that support or oppose the potential role of IL-6 in the development of insulin resistance exist.<br>
In vitro data using well-defined cell systems including liver (HepG2)(44), fat (3T3L1) or isolated rat pancreatic islet cells show a direct negative effect of IL-6 on insulin signaling, glucose uptake and insulin secretion, respectively. On the other hand, data obtained from experiments done on skeletal muscle biopsies suggest that IL-6 may increase glucose uptake in exercising muscle.<br>
In vivo data on the association between IL-6 levels and insulin sensitivity are equally mixed. Models of IL-6 over-expression or complete ablation suggest that complete inhibition of IL-6 activity might not have a beneficial effect. For example, in transgenic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, over-expression of human IL-6 delays the onset of diabetes and prolongs survival. In addition, data from IL-6 null mice suggest that IL-6 may play a role in energy balance regulation since these animals develop late-onset obesity and higher glucose levels.<br>
In humans, a naturally occurring mutation within the region of the IL-6 promoter leads to an increase in IL-6 secretion rate. This mutation has been associated with both an increase and a decrease in insulin sensitivity.<br><br>
In another set of experiments, the effect of exogenous IL-6 has been evaluated. In normal subjects, IL-6 administration led to increases in glucose levels without affecting plasma insulin concentrations, whereas, in cancer patients, addition of IL-6 increased glucose disposal. In addition, the correlation between IL-6 levels and insulin resistance has been examined. Data from these experiments suggested that in both men and women, higher circulating levels of IL-6 were correlated with higher insulin resistance although a cause-and-effect relationship remains to be determined.<br>
IL-6 has been indicated to play an important role in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance. However, conflicting in vitro and in vivo data exist that both support or oppose its potential role in insulin resistance.<br>
Osteoarthritis (OA)<br>
OA is a chronic, degenerative joint disorder, characterized by loss of articular cartilage, and related changes in subchondral bone. Although varying degrees of inflammation are observed on arthroscopy or in synovial biopsy specimens, the disease is not primarily inflammatory. Rather, it is thought to originate from changes in chondrocyte and/or osteoblast metabolism. TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 are the cytokines most strongly associated with these changes.<br>
IL-6 is detectable in synovial fluid from patients with OA, although at levels substantially below those seen in inflammatory arthropathies (Bertazzolo, N. et al. 1994 Agents and Actions 41: 90-92). IL-6 is recognized to be a primary stimulus for hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, and CRP levels are associated with the presence of knee OA, even after taking into account the known association between CRP and obesity (Mohtai, M. et al. 1996 J Orthopedic Research 14: 67-73).<br><br>
IL-6 is expressed in chondrocytes from OA cartilage, but not normal cartilage (Sowers, M. et al. 2002 Osteoarthritis and Cartilage 10: 595-601). In experiments testing the effects of mechanical stress on chondrocyte cytokine expression in vitro, fluid induced shear stress markedly upregulated IL-6 mRNA and protein. This suggests that IL-6 expression in OA cartilage may result from mechanical loading. IL-6 may also be produced in response to IL-1 action on chondrocytes (Dozin, B. et al. 2002 Matrix Biology 21:449-459).<br>
In other experiments, IL-6, in combination with sIL-6R, led to inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis by human articular chondrocytes cultured ex vivo, although the effect was modest compared with IL-1 (Guerne, P. et al.  1999 Matrix Biology 18:253-260).<br>
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)<br>
COPD is a disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles and gases (Pauwels RA et al. 2001 Am.J.Respir Crit Care Med 163:1256-1276). COPD is characterized by acceleration in the normal decline in lung function seen with aging. The slowly progressive airflow limitation leads to disability and premature death. COPD is a leading cause of death and disability, but has only recently been extensively explored from a cellular and molecular perspective (Barnes P.J. et al. 2003 Eur Respir J 22:672-688). In COPD, there is a chronic inflammation that leads to fixed narrowing of small airways and alveolar destruction (emphysema). The inflammatory response is characterized by an increased number of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and the release of multiple inflammatory mediators (chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and lipids). A high level of oxidative stress may amplify the inflammation. There is also increased<br><br>
elastolysis and evidence for involvement of several elastolytic enzymes. The inflammation and proteolysis in COPD is an amplification of the normal inflammatory response to cigarette smoke. In contrast to asthma, the inflammation appears to be resistant to corticosteroids (Barnes P.J. et al. 2003).<br>
In animal models, bacterial endotoxin or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and cigarette smoke exposure induce neutrophilia and increased production of IL-6 in the bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (Underwood D.C. et al. 2000 AJPLCMP 279:L895-902). Over-expression of IL-6 in mouse lungs induces emphysema (Kuhn III Ch. et al. 2000 AJRCMB 22:289-295). In humans, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is inversely correlated with IL-6, IL-8 levels and polymorphonuclear cell counts in the BAL (Soler N. et al. 1999 Eur Respir J 14:1015-1022). Plasma TNFa, IL-6 and CRP levels are increased in subjects with mild to severe COPD (Yasuda N. et al. 1998 Respir Med 92:993-999).<br>
Acute exacerbation of COPD is defined as sustained worsening of the patient's condition, from the stable state and beyond normal day-to-day variations, that is acute in onset and necessitates a change in regular medication (Burge S. et al. 2003 Eur Respir J 21: Suppl. 41, 46s-53s). Although increased symptoms and worsening of lung function are a common cause of hospital admission (approximately 500,000 each year in the US), the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been widely investigated and are poorly understood (Wedzicha, J.A. 2002 Chest 121: 136S-141S). Acute exacerbations may be prolonged and have profound effect on quality of life and may accelerate the progression of COPD (Soto F.J. et al. 2003 Pulm Med 9:117-124). Respiratory infections are the most common causes of COPD exacerbations. The majority of these infections are caused by bacteria, but many of them are due to viral infections,<br><br>
particularly rhinovirus (Soto F.J. et al. 2003). Environmental factors, air pollutants and temperature may also play a role.<br>
During exacerbation, there is an increase in neutrophils and concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, TNFa and LTB4 in sputum of patients with COPD. Some patients with moderate-to-severe COPD are prone to frequent exacerbations (three or more exacerbations per year). This group of patients ("frequent exacerbators") has a higher level of IL-6 and a lower level of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor even when COPD is stable (Bhowmik A. et al. 2000 Thorax 55: 114-120; Gompertz S. et al. 2001 Thorax 56: 36-41; Gompertz S. et al. 2001 Eur Respir J17: 1112-1119).<br>
A number of other mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and bacterial colonization, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of COPD exacerbation as well.<br>
Example 1: Cloning and Expression of IL-6 Antibody in Mammalian Cells.<br>
A typical mammalian expression vector contains at least one promoter element, which mediates the initiation of transcription of mRNA, the antibody coding sequence, and signals required for the termination of transcription and polyadenylation of the transcript. Additional elements include enhancers, Kozak sequences and intervening sequences flanked by donor and acceptor sites for RNA splicing. Highly efficient transcription can be achieved with the early and late promoters from SV40, the long terminal repeats (LTRS) from retroviruses, e.g., RSV, HTLVI, HIVI and the early promoter of the cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, cellular elements can also be used (e.g., the human actin promoter). Suitable expression vectors for use in practicing the present invention include, for example, vectors, such as pIRESlneo, pRetro-Off, pRetro-On, PLXSN, or pLNCX (Clonetech Labs, Palo Alto, CA), pcDNA3.1 (+/-), pcDNA/Zeo (+/-) or<br><br>
pcDNA3.1/Hygro (+/-) (Invitrogen), PSVL and PMSG (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), pRSVcat (ATCC 37152), pSV2dhfr (ATCC 37146) and PBC12MI (ATCC 67109). Suitable mammalian and other host cells include human Hela, 293, H9 and Jurkat cells, mouse NIH3T3 and CI27 cells, Cos 1, Cos 7 and CV 1, quail QC1-3 cells, mouse L cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Alternatively, the gene can be expressed in stable cell lines that contain the gene integrated into a chromosome. The co-transfection with a selectable marker, such as dhfr, gpt, neomycin, or hygromycin, allows the identification and isolation of the transfected cells.<br>
The transfected gene can also be amplified to express large amounts of the encoded antibody. The DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) marker is useful to develop cell lines that carry several hundred or even several thousand copies of the gene of interest. Another useful selection marker is the enzyme glutamine synthase (GS) (Murphy, et al., Biochem. J. 227:277-279 (1991); Bebbington, et al., Bio/Technology 10:169-175 (1992)). Using these markers, the mammalian cells are grown in selective medium and the cells with the highest resistance are selected. These cell lines contain the amplified gene(s) integrated into a chromosome. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and NSO cells are often used for the production of antibodies.<br>
The expression vectors pC 1 and pC4 contain the strong promoter (LTR) of the Rous Sarcoma Virus (Cullen, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:438-447 (1985)) plus a fragment of the CMV-enhancer (Boshart, et al, Cell 41:521-530 (1985)). Multiple cloning sites, e.g., with the restriction enzyme cleavage sites BamHI, Xbal and Asp718, facilitate the cloning of the gene of interest. The vectors contain in addition to the 3' intron, the polyadenylation and termination signal of the rat prcproinsulin gene.<br><br>
Cloning and Expression in CHO Cells.<br>
The vector pC4 can be used for the expression of IL-6 antibody. Plasmid pC4 is a derivative of the plasmid pSV2-dhfr (ATCC Accession No. 37146). The plasmid contains the mouse DHFR gene under control of the SV40 early promoter. Chinese hamster ovary or other cells lacking dihydrofolate activity that are transfected with these plasmids can be selected by growing the cells in a selective medium (e.g., alpha minus MEM, Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with the chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate. The amplification of the DHFR genes in cells resistant to methotrexate (MTX) has been well documented (see, e.g., F. W. Alt, et al, J. Biol. Chem. 253:1357-1370 (1978); J. L. Hamlin and C. Ma, Biochem. et Biophys. Acta 1097:107-143 (1990); and M. J. Page and M. A. Sydenham, Biotechnology 9:64-68 (1991)). Cells grown in increasing concentrations of MTX develop resistance to the drug by overproducing the target enzyme, DHFR, as a result of amplification of the DHFR gene. If a second gene is linked to the DHFR gene, it is usually co-amplified and over-expressed. It is known in the art that this approach can be used to develop cell lines carrying more than 1,000 copies of the amplified gene(s). Subsequently, when the methotrexate is withdrawn, cell lines are obtained that contain the amplified gene integrated into one or more chromosome(s) of the host cell.<br>
High efficiency promoters other than the strong promoter of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Rous Sarcoma Virus can also be used for the expression, e.g., the human p-actin promoter, the SV40 early or late promoters or the long terminal repeats from other retroviruses, e.g., HIV and HTLVI. Clontech's Tet-Off and Tet-On gene expression systems and similar systems can be used to express the IL-6 antibody in a regulated way in mammalian cells (M. Gossen, and H. Bujard, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 5547-5551 (1992)). For the polyadenylation of the mRNA, other signals, e.g., from the human growth hormone or globin genes, can be<br><br>
used as well. Stable cell lines carrying a gene of interest integrated into the chromosomes can also be selected upon co-transfection with a selectable marker, such as gpt, G418 or hygromycin. It is advantageous to use more than one selectable marker in the beginning, e.g., G418 plus methotrexate. The plasmid pC4 is digested with restriction enzymes and then dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase by procedures known in the art. The vector is then isolated from a 1% agarose gel.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the complete IL-6 antibody is used, e.g., as presented in SEQ ID NOS: 98 and 96, corresponding to HC and LC variable regions of an IL-6 antibody of the present invention, respectively, according to known method steps. Isolated nucleic acid encoding a suitable human constant region (i.e., HC and LC regions) is also used in this construct.<br>
The isolated variable and constant region encoding DNA and the dephosphorylated vector are then ligated with T4 DNA ligase. E. coli HB101 or XL-1 Blue cells are then transformed and bacteria are identified that contain the fragment inserted into plasmid pC4 using, for instance, restriction enzyme analysis.<br>
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lacking an active DHFR gene are used for transfection. 5 micrograms of the expression plasmid pC4 are cotransfected with 0.5 microgram of the plasmid pSV2-neo using lipofectin. The plasmid'pSV2neo contains a dominant selectable marker, the neo gene from Tn5 encoding an enzyme that confers resistance to a group of antibiotics including G418. The cells are seeded • in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 1 microgram/ml G418. After 2 days, the cells are trypsinized and seeded in hybridoma cloning plates (Greiner, Germany) in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 10, 25, or 50 ng/ml of methotrexate plus 1 microgram/ml G418. After about 10-14 days, single clones are trypsinized and then seeded in 6-well petri dishes or 10 ml flasks using different concentrations of methotrexate (50 nM, 100 nM, 200 nM, 400 nM, 800 nM). Clones growing at the<br><br>
highest concentrations of methotrexate are then transferred to new 6-well plates containing even higher concentrations of methotrexate (1 mM, 2 mM. 5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM). The same procedure is repeated until clones are obtained that grow at a concentration of 100 - 200 mM. Expression of the desired gene product is analyzed, for instance, by SDS-PAGE and Western blot or by reverse phase HPLC analysis.<br>
Example 2 - Construction and Screening of Anti-IL-6 Antibodies<br>
Variants of the'IL-6 antibody (clone AME-A9) were constructed and screened for activity. In this example and otherwise herein, the CDRs are as defined by Kabat with the exception of CDRH1 which is the sum of Kabat and Chothia definitions. The length of CDRH2 made it necessary to construct two separate libraries to cover the entire region. Clones of interest were sequenced and further characterized by ELIS A and in a cell based assay and kinetic constants were determined.<br>
An example of an ELISA done with the purified IgGs is shown in Figure 9. The ELISA generally used Costar 3366 microtiter plates coated with a goat anti-human kappa antibody. Dilutions of Fab (or IgG) were incubated in the coated wells for 1 hr at 22°C. The wells were then washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and biotinylated IL-6 at 200 ng/ml was added for 1 hour. After washing, an alkaline phosphatase conjugate of NeutrAvidin was added and incubated for 1 hour at 22°C. A colorimetric substrate was added after extensive washing and the bound IL-6 was determined. A variation of this ELISA included an extended wash step in a beaker of PBS, 0.01% BSA at 37°C after the biotinylated IL-6 incubation, e.g., an 18 hour extended wash step.<br><br>
Several of the generated human engineered IL-6 reactive IgG monoclonal antibodies of the invention have affinity constants between 1x10 and 9x10   . The high affinities of these human engineered monoclonal antibodies make them suitable for therapeutic applications in IL-6-dependent diseases, pathologies or related conditions.<br>
Multiple different human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody variants were obtained by altering one or more of the CDR regions of the antibody. Table 3 below shows a summary of the beneficial mutations that were found in the individual CDR libraries (amino acid changes are relative to the AME-A9 variant). In addition, Table 13 below shows the amino acid sequences for the light and heavy chain CDRs with the possible substitution positions (marked as "X").<br>
A "combinatorial" library was constructed based on the best clones (i.e., variants) found in the individual CDR libraries. Table 4 lists the mutations that were included in the "combinatorial" library. The combinatorial library was screened and characterized as described above. The mutations found in six of the better clones are shown in Table 5A below, while the sequence ID numbers for the CDRs in these clones are shown in Table 5B.<br>
Assaying anti-IL-6 IgGs in a Cell-based Assay<br>
The chimeric anti-IL-6 and human engineered anti-IL-6 (clone AME-19a) antibodies were tested for the ability to prevent the growth of an IL-6 dependent cell line. 7TD1 cells were plated into a Costar 3610 96 well plate at 200 cells per well. Antibodies, diluted in IMDM media, were added to the wells followed by the addition of human IL-6 to a final concentration of 500 pg/ml and plates were incubated in a tissue culture incubator for 64-72 hours. At that time, 50 ul of cell lysis buffer from the ATPlite kit (Packard Bioscience) were added to all wells and<br><br>
the plates were agitated for 3 minutes. 50 μl of ATPlite substrate were added and the covered plates were shaken for 1 minute. Chemiluminescence was determined on a luminometer.<br>
The results of a cell-based assay are shown in Figure 10, with the calculated EC50 values shown in Table 6 below. The EC50 value of the chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody is 2.7 x 10"11 M (4.09 ng/ml) and that of the human engineered anti-IL-6 (clone AME-19a) antibody is 2.7 x 10"12 M (0.41 ng/ml). The EC50 value of the human engineered antibody shows about a 10-fold improvement, although it may be possible to obtain from about a 10-fold up to about a 60-fold improvement, including intervening values, in the EC50 value.<br>
Example 3 - Binding Kinetics of Human Engineered Anti-Human IL-6 antibodies.<br>
ELISA analysis confirms that purified antibody from these host cells bind IL-6 in a concentration-dependent manner. In this case, the affinity of the antibody for its cognate antigen (epitope) is measured. Quantitative binding constants are obtained using BIAcore analysis and the KinExA 3000 instrument. The results indicate that several of the human engineered monoclonal antibodies are very high affinity with KD in the range of lxl0"9 to 3x10"14.<br>
An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that uses anti-human IL-6 monoclonal antibodies (AME-A9, AME-A16, AME-18a, AME-20b, AME-22a, and AME-23a) and CNTO 328 used as a positive control to detect the bound IL-6 to the soluble IL-6 receptor, sIL-6R, was performed. The soluble human IL-6 receptor, sIL-6R, and recombinant human IL-6 were obtained from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MTN)<br><br>
(Catalog #227-SR-025 and 206-IL-010, respectively). Goat anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase-linked (H+L chain) was obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA) (Catalog # 109-035-003). Hydrogen Peroxide and OPD tablets were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) (Catalog #H-1009 and P-8287, respectively).<br>
Enzyme linked immnoassay for sgp80/IL-6/anti-IL-6 mAb complex formation<br>
Costar EIA plates (Corning/Costar, Acton, MA) (Catalog # 9018) were coated with sIL-6R (10 ug/ml in PBS, 100 ul/well) overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed with 0.15M saline containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 and wells were blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS, 200 ul/well for one hour at room temperature. The wells were washed again then in the sequential format incubated with 200 ng/ml human IL-6 (100 ul/well) in PBS for one hour at room temperature. Antibody was added to all wells in 10-fold serial dilutions from a starting concentration of 10 u,g/ml in 100 ul/well for one hour at room temperature. After washing, the wells were incubated with goat anti-human IgG (H+L)-HRP-linked, (10 ug/ml in PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The wells were washed and 100 ul/well of citrate-phosphate substrates solution (0.1M Citric Acid and 0.2M Sodium Phosphate, 0.01% H2O2 and 1 mg/ml OPD) was added for 15 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 ul/well of 4N sulfuric acid and the OD,|c)() was read via an automated ELIS A plate reader (Molecular Devices Spectromax Plus, Sunnyvale, CA).<br>
To test the effect of preincubation of IL-6 with anti hIL-6 monoclonal antibodies or CNTO 328, 200 ng/ml IL-6 (100 ul) was incubated with ten-fold serial dilutions of antibody (100 μl), starting with 10 ng/ml for one hour at room<br><br>
temperature. This pre-incubated mixture was then incubated with sIL-6R for one hour at room temperature and detection of the sIL-6R/IL-6/anti human IL-6 complex was detected using goat anti-human IgG (H+L)-HRP-linked, (10 ug/ml in PBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The remainder of the assay conditions was the same as described in the previous paragraph.<br>
Previous studies have shown that CNTO 328 can detect IL-6 when it is captured by sIL-6R.that is coated on an EIA plateinternal technical report. In addition, AME-A9, AME-A16, AME-18a, AME-20b, AME-22a, and AME-23a can detect IL-6 bound to sgp80 (sIL-6R) in a dose dependent manner using EIA. Each human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody was evaluated in reference to CNTO 328.   However, preincubation of IL-6 and any of these anti hIL-6 monoclonal antibodies precludes the ability of sIL-6R to bind IL-6.<br>
Measuring Kinetic Constants for anti-IL-6 IgGs<br>
The KinExA 3000 instrument, manufactured by Sapidyne, was used to measure binding kinetics. Briefly, human IL-6 was covalently coupled to alzactone beads and the binding of free IgG to the beads was detected on the instrument. To measure KD, individual tubes containing a constant concentration of either 0.5, 1 or 5 pM of IgG with decreasing serially diluted human IL-6, were incubated for 3-4 days at 20°C in 0.1% BSA, PBS. A total of 13 tubes were used for each KD determination. For example, the chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody was used at a constant concentration of 5 pM and individual tubes were incubated with 0-200 pM of IL-6. Incubations for the other IgGs were set in a similar manner. After the incubation, free IgG in each equilibrated sample was determined on the KinExA 3000 instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions. KD values were determined<br><br>
by the KinExA 3000 software using the KinExA 3000 instrument, as described in more detail below.<br>
To measure kon, individual IgGs at 200 pM were mixed with 100-200 pM of human IL-6 and the unbound IgG was detected by binding to human IL-6 covalently coupled to alzactone beads on the KinExA 3000 instrument. A series of measurements were taken over time. The resulting data was used to calculate the kon with the KinExA 3000 software. k0fr was calculated by using the formula KD = kofl/kon- A summary of the kinetic constants for the anti-IL-6 IgGs is shown in Table 7.<br>
Example 4: In vitro characterization of anti-IL-6 Antibody<br>
In vitro studies were conducted to characterize the sequence, epitope specificity, affinity, and biologic activity of the anti-IL-6 antibody.<br>
Human Engineered mAb<br>
Sequence analysis confirms that the anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention (embodied in different variants/clones) contains fully human frameworks. Table 5a shows a total of 10 amino acid residues changed in both the heavy and light chains of CDR1, 2, and 3 in the anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention (in different variants of the antibody) as compared with the chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody (described in PCT WO 04/039826).<br>
Epitope specificity<br>
The anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention and the chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody recognize a similar epitope on human IL-6. These antibodies do not compete with the commercial mouse anti-human IL-6 mAb from R&amp;D Systems #MAB-206 suggesting that they recognize an epitope that is uniquely different from that of the R&amp;D anti-IL-6 mAb. The anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention and the chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody do not compete with R&amp;D rat anti-human IL-6 mAb.<br><br>
Human IL-6 (200 ng/ml) was captured by plate-bound anti-IL-6 mAb (mouse anti-human IL-6 mAb, MAB-206, which was used only as plate bound mAb to capture human IL-6) (10 ng/ml) and serial dilutions of the anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention and the chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody, as indicated along the X-axis were then added to the plate. Binding to IL-6 was measured as increase in OD490 along the Y-axis. Both the anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention and the chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody show dose-dependent binding to IL-6.<br>
Conversely, the anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention and the chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody competitively bind for human IL-6, suggesting that the two molecules share a similar binding epitope on IL-6. Human IL-6 (200 ng/ml) was captured by plate-bound MAB-206 (10(ig/ml). Serial dilutions of the anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention as indicated along the X-axis and 50 ng/ml of biotinylated chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody were then added to the plate. Binding of biotinylated chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody to IL-6 was detected by streptavidin-HRP and measured as OD490 readings along the Y-axis.<br>
Moreover, the human engineered and chimeric antibodies exhibit similar properties for binding to the sIL-6/sIL-6R complex (Figure 1). The anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention binds to sIL-6/SIL-6R complex. Soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) was coated on the plate at 10 ng/ml concentration. Human IL-6 was then added to the plate at 200 ng/ml concentration. Serial dilutions of the anti-IL-6 antibody of the present invention or the chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody, as indicated along the X-axis, were then added to the plate and binding to the IL-6/sIL-6R complex was detected using HRP-anti-human IgG and measured as OD490 readings along the Y-axis.<br><br>
To further confirm the above findings, cross-species reactivity testing was conducted using IL-6-containing conditional supernatant generated from LPS and IFNy-stimulated PBMCs of different species in a 7TD1 (IL-6 dependent murine hybridoma cell line) cell-based proliferation assay. The human engineered antibody of the invention was shown to neutralize the activity of the conditioned supernatants in stimulating 7TD1 cell proliferation from a variety of primate species, including human, marmoset, cynomolgus monkey, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, baboon, pigtail monkey, and cotton top monkey, and displayed a similar cross-species reactivity pattern compared with the chimeric antibody (Table 8).<br>
Finally, when epitope mapping was conducted using the tryptic digest method, the same binding epitope for the human engineered and chimeric antibodies on human IL-6 was observed and is located on the Helix D spanning amino acid residues 168-184 (Figure 3). Recent mutational analysis confirmed that residues 179 and 182 are essential for the antibody of the invention to bind to IL-6. The epitope (amino acid residues 168-184) was identified as the surface of IL-6 that retained deuterium in the presence of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody.<br>
Biologic activity<br>
The IL-6 neutralization potency of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody was determined by 7TD1 cell-based bioassay. Human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody demonstrated a 10-fold higher neutralization potency as compared with chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody in the 7TD1 cell proliferation assay. 7TD1 cells were stimulated with 500 pg/ml of hIL-6 in the presence of serial dilutions of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody or chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody or isotype control mAb for 72 hours. Cell proliferation was measured as counts per second as indicated on the Y-axis.<br><br>
Error bars indicate the SD of duplicate samples. A closed circle indicates cells without IL-6; open circle indicates cells stimulated with 500 pg/ml of hIL-6.<br>
Human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody also inhibits IL-6-induced monocyte chemoartractant protein-1 (MCP-1) production from U937 cells (Figure 3) and IL-6/IL-ip-induced serum amyloid A (SAA) production from HepG2 human hepatoma cells (Figure 4). Figure 3 demonstrates that human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody inhibits IL-6 stimulated MCP-1 secretion from U937 cells. 5 x lO3 cells/well were treated with 1 ng/ml of hIL-6 and serial dilutions of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody for 72 hours. Cell culture supernatants were analyzed in triplicates by ELISA for the presence of MCP-1.<br>
Figure 4 shows that the human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody inhibits IL-6 and IL-ip stimulated SAA secretion from HepG2 cells. 2.25 x lO^cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of hIL-6, 200 ng/ml of sIL-6R and 1 ng/ml of IL-1|3 in the presence of serial dilutions of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody for 24 hours. Cell culture supernatants were then analyzed in duplicates by ELISA for the presence of SAA.<br>
IL-6 Dependent Stat3 Phosphorylation<br>
To assess the ability of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody to block the signaling cascade resulting from IL-6 binding to IL-6R and gpl30, an immuno-precipitation assay was performed to test the effect on IL-6 dependent STAT3 phosphorylation in THP-1 cells, which express gpl30 on the cell surface.<br>
The mAbs are sterile-filtered filter-sterilized and stored in PBS at 4°C. Recombinant human IL-6 (206-IL-010) and sIL-6R (227-SR-025) from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) were used. RPMI media (11875-085), heat-inactivated<br><br>
fetal bovine serum (16000-069), L-Glutamine (25030-081), non-essential amino acids (11140-050), and sodium pyruvate (11360-070) were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). TBS (10 mM Tris, pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl) was also used.<br>
THP-1, a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line received from research cell banks, was tested to be mycoplasma negative and bacteria free. These cells were cultured in RPMI media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Cells were subcultured or harvested when cultures reached approximately 85% confluence. Cells were routinely split 1:5 every three days.<br>
For tyrosine phosphorylation, cells were grown to 80-90% confluence in T-225 flasks. The media was removed and replaced with fresh media without serum and incubated for overnight. Following serum starvation, cells were harvested from each flask, pelleted and a final concentration of 20x106 cells per condition was resuspended in 0.5 ml media without serum.<br>
RhIL-6 (0.1 u.g/ml) was pre-incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes with the following reagents: 0.5 ml media alone, anti-IL-6 Ab (10 ug/ml); and sIL-6R (0.2 ug/ml). SIL-6R (0.2 (.ig/ml) and anti-IL-6 Ab (10 u.g/ml) were then added to cells preincubated with anti-IL-6 Ab and sIL-6R, respectively, for incubation at 37°C for 15 minutes. The cells were then combined with medium as negative control and the IL-6/Ab/sIL-6R complex and incubated at 37°C for 6 minutes. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold TBS and cell pellets were either processed as described in Section 5.4 or stored at -70°C.<br>
For immunoprecipitation, the cell pellets were lysed in 1 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton-X-100) (T-9284, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (1697498, Roche, Basel,<br><br>
Switzerland). The cells were vortexed for 30 seconds and incubated at -70 C for 20-60 minutes. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes. To reduce non-specific background staining, the samples were pre-cleared by incubation with 2 u.g rabbit IgG (15006, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) plus 50 ul Protein A agarose (SC-2001, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 hr at 4°C on an orbital mixer. The agarose beads were removed by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes. The cleared lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and incubated with anti-STAT3 (2 ng/ml) (SC-7179, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4°C on an orbital mixer, followed by addition of 50 u Protein A agarose beads and incubated for 2 hours at 4°C on an orbital shaker. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes and washed 5 times in ice-cold TBSat4°C. The agarose beads were then resuspended in 40 u.1 Laemmli sample buffer plus DTT (NP0007-465030, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and heated at 95°C for 5 minutes.<br>
The samples were resolved on a 3-8% NuPage Bis-Tris gel (EA0375BOX, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with running buffer (NP0002-465026, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 100 V for 1 hour. The proteins were transferred to a Nitrocellulose membrane (LC2001, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using transfer buffer (NP0006-465029, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 30 V for 1 hour. The membranes were blocked in 10% fat free dry milk (Nestle, Glendale, California) in TBS-T for overnight at 4°C. Following several washes in TBS-T at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-p-STAT3 Ab (SC-8059, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), which was diluted 1:1000 in TBS-T for 4 hrs at 4°C on an orbital shaker. After several washes, the membranes were then incubated with donkey anti-mouse IgG-HRP (1:1000) (SC-2318, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at room temperature for 2 hr on an orbital mixer. After several washes, the samples were detected using ECLplus Western Blot<br><br>
Detection Reagents and analysis kit (RPN2108, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) following manufacturer's protocol and visualized by exposure to ECL film. The membranes were then stripped of Ab by submerging in 100 mM DTT, 2% SDS, 62.5% mM Tris-HCI, pH 6.7 at 100°C for 30 minutes with agitation. The membranes were then washed in TBS-T and blocked overnight with the 10% fat free dry milk. The membranes were washed and incubated with anti-STAT3 (1:1000) (SC-7179, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in TBS-T for 2 hours at 4°C, washed 5 times followed by a 1 hour incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:1000) (SC2030, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and detected using ECLplus. All membranes were routinely stripped and reprobed with STAT3 to demonstrate the presence of STAT3 protein.<br>
The results showed that human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody blocked IL-6-mediated stat3 phosphorylation, a key component in the IL-6 signaling pathway (Figures 5A and 5B). Human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody (AME-19A) inhibits IL-6/sIL-6R-induced stat3 phosphorylation. Recombinant human IL-6/sIL-6R-induced stat3 phosphorylation was detected in THP-1 cells (Figure 5B). The addition of 10 ug/ml of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody (AME-19A) or chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody completely inhibited stat3 phosphorylation (Figure 5B). Figure 5A shows the presence of a similar amount of unphosphorylated stat3 protein in all samples corresponding to the different human engineered anti-IL-6 clones. As used herein, CNT0328 (or 328) designates the chimeric, human-murine antibody (also referred to as wild type (WT)), 150 designates clone AME-22a, 143 designates clone AME-23a, 140 designates clone AME-20b, 136 designates clone AME-19a, 130 designates clone AME-18a, 106 designates clone AME-A16, 104 designates clone AME-A9.<br><br>
In vivo efficacy of Human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody<br>
The efficacy of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody was assessed in two different in vivo models. First, the effects of human engineered and chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody were tested and compared in a human IL-6-induced Matrigel angiogenesis assay in mice. 200 ng/ml of human IL-6 was included in the Matrigel plug. Two Matrigel plugs were injected into each nude mouse. Groups of six mice received an i.v. injection of 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg of human engineered or chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody. PBS or an isotype control mAb was also administered for control groups. Plugs were removed on day 7 and angiogenesis was measured by hemoglobin content, microvessel length, and microvessel number in the plugs. Results showed that human IL-6 (PBS group) stimulated angiogenesis in the Matrigel plug model as measured by all three parameters.<br>
Human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody (AME-19A) inhibits the mean number of microvessels in Matrigel plugs. In addition, human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody (AME-19A) inhibits mean length of microvessels in Matrigel plugs. Also, human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody (AME-19A) inhibits hemoglobin level in Matrigel plugs.<br>
In addition, both human engineered (AME-19A) and chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody dose-dependently inhibited IL-6-mediated angiogenesis in nude mice. Finally, human engineered and chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody exhibited comparable activity in inhibiting IL-6-induced angiogenesis at 6mg/kg, the highest dose tested. Although chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody significantly inhibited human IL-6-induced angiogenesis at 3 mg/kg as measured by vessel length and vessel number, no statistically significant differences were detected between human engineered and chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody at these doses.<br><br>
An additional in vivo model was developed to further evaluate the effect of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody on human IL-6-induced acute phase reactant, serum amyloid protein A (SAA) production in Balb/C mice. Mice received an i.p. administration of 0.01, 0.5 or 5 mg/kg of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody 4 hours prior to an i.v. administration of 5 ug/kg of human IL-6 (Figure 6). PBS and isotype control mAb were used as controls. Serum SAA levels were determined at 16 hours post-IL-6 injection. Both human engineered and chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody significantly inhibited human IL-6-induced SAA production in Balb/C mice at 0.5 and 5 mg/kg, and human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody significantly inhibited SAA production at the lowest dose tested. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between human engineered and chimeric anti-IL-6 antibody at all three doses tested (Figure 6).<br>
Figure 6 shows that human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody inhibits human IL-6-induced SAA production. Each point represents the mean value of SAA for each animal and the line represents the mean of all the data points in each group. Pair-wise comparison was conducted and Tukey's 95% simultaneous confidence intervals were used in order to control the overall type I error. (** /?
Example 5 - Therapeutic rationale for anti-IL-6 mAb<br>
Rheumatoid arthritis. Effect of anti-IL-6 mAb on Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA)-an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis<br>
Preclinical in vivo disease models<br>
IL-6 has been targeted in a variety of in vivo models. Either rat anti-mouse IL-6 antibody was used in standard murine models or humanized anti-lL-6R (80kDa) mAb (MRA; Chugai) was used in primate models and in the human/mouse SCID<br><br>
model. In murine collagen induced arthritis (CIA), anti-IL-6 was effective in preventing disease if used early (day 0 or 3 post immunization with collagen), but not at later time points. In the human/mouse SCID transplant model, in which human synovial tissue is transplanted into immunodeficient mice, MRA treatment led to shrinkage of tissue implants and reduced inflammatory cells and osteoclasts. In CIA in cynomolgus monkeys, MRA inhibited development of arthritis, and improved acute phase measures.<br>
The effect of a surrogate anti-mouse IL-6 mAb on disease development has been evaluated in a CIA model. The results indicate that i.p. administration of anti-mouse IL-6 at lmg/mouse/week prior to disease induction significantly suppressed the development of collagen-induced arthritis as reflected by the marked reduction in disease severity. Arthritis was induced in 8-week old DBA/1 LacJ mice with 100 |_ig of bovine type II collagen in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) intradermally at the base of the tail. Mice were clinically monitored daily for the onset of disease. Anti-IL-6 mAb or isotype control mAb was administered i.p. 2 days prior to CIA induction and weekly thereafter at 1 mg/mouse. The arthritis score was determined based on swelling, erythema, and disfiguration of the joint.<br>
The histopathological data confirmed the clinical observation that weekly i.p. injection of anti-mouse IL-6 mAb significantly improved the parameters of collagen induced arthritis. All of the parameters of arthritis examined including the inflammatory response (synovitis and pannus formation) and the erosive changes (erosions and overall joint architecture) were significantly improved in anti-mouse IL-6 treated mice as compared with control mAb-treated animals. The anti-IL-6 mAb suppressed arthritis at a histopathological level. Synovitis was scored based on the thickness of the synovial membrane; pannus formation was scored based on the<br><br>
extent of pannus relative to joint space; and erosions were scored based on the extent into the cartilage and subchondral bone.<br>
The loss of cartilage matrix proteinswas significantly reduced in mice treated with anti-mouse IL-6 mAb. Representative joint sections obtained from control and anti-IL-6 mAb treated animals at the end of the study (day 53) were examined by Toluidine Blue staining for cartilage matrix.<br>
Micro-CT analysis supported the clinical observation that the effect of anti-mouse IL-6 therapy was exerted at the level of the progression of disease within the individual joint. Visual inspection of typical 3D CT images indicates the marked degree of erosive changes that occur in the isotype control mAb-treated group as compared with the predominantly mild soft tissue inflammatory changes in joints from anti-mouse IL-6 treated animals. The experiments were performed with representative animals treated with control mAb and anti-mouse IL-6 mAb treated animals.<br>
Lupus. Effect of anti-IL-6 in NZB/W Fl mice<br>
Pre-clinical in vivo disease models<br>
Murine models exist for SLE and these have close similarities to human disease. Studies of MRL/lpr and NZB/W Fl strains demonstrated B cell hyperproliferation, autoantibody production, and immune complex deposition that closely resemble the human disease. Anti-IL-6 mAb was shown to be effective in inhibiting autoantibody production, reducing proteinuria, and improving animal survival in NZB/W Fl mice.<br>
The effect of a surrogate anti-mouse IL-6 mAb on lupus disease development has been evaluated in NZB/W Fl mice. The preliminary results demonstrated that<br><br>
i.p. administration of anti-mouse IL-6 mAb at lmg/mouse/week for 22 weeks suppressed the production of anti-dsDNA autoantibody, a major pathogenic autoantibody in this disease model (Figure 7). Anti-dsDNA autoantibody levels in anti-IL-6 mAb treated animals were consistently lower throughout the study as compared to that in saline and control Ab treated animals.<br>
As discussed above, Figure 7 shows the inhibition of anti-dsDNA autoantibody production by anti-IL-6 mAb in NZB/W Fl mice. An Individual O.D. value for each sample was normalized to a positive control serum and presented as % positive control. Each point represents the % positive control of each sample and the line represents the mean of all the data points in each group. Significant difference is indicated as * p
In addition, anti-IL-6 mAb inhibited B-cell proliferation and reduced kidney damage when a small subset of the animals was examined. While there was no significant difference in T cell proliferation among the different treatment groups at the end of the study, B-cell proliferation induced by anti-IgM and anti-CD40 was lower in anti-IL-6 mAb treated mice compared with that of saline-treated mice over time, specifically, after 34 weeks.    This result is consistent with the reduced anti-dsDNA autoantibody production reported above and suggests that autoreactive B cells might be the direct and dominant targets for anti-IL-6 mAb treatment.<br>
Histopathological analysis indicated that animals in the study could be categorized into 3 kidney disease severity groups (mild, moderate, and severe) (Table 9). The renal disease pathology in NZB/W Fl mice indicate mixed lymphoid hyperplasia and immune complex deposition in the glomerular basement membrane.<br>
Animals treated with anti-IL-6 mAb developed less severe kidney disease. Perivascular mixed lymphoid hyperplasia and protein deposition were absent in the<br><br>
anti-IL-6 mAb treated animals while animals treated with saline and control Ab developed moderate and severe perivascular mixed lymphoid hyperplasia and protein deposition. Furthermore, immune complex deposition in the glomerular basement membrane was mild in the anti-IL-6 mAb treated animals as compared with that in the other two treatment groups. Further dissection of the mechanism of action of anti-IL-6 mAb on B, T, and macrophage cell functions is performed as these cells play critical roles in the pathogenesis of SLE.<br>
Type II Diabetes Mellitus<br>
IL-6 has been indicated to play an important role in development of insulin resistance associated with obesity. However, in vitro and in vivo data generated to date both support and oppose its potential role in insulin resistance.<br>
In vitro experiments<br>
Experiments have been performed to better understand the effects that IL-6 may have on insulin signaling and on the biological effects and function of insulin, such as glucose up-take, gene regulation, and related mechanisms using in vitro models of insulin responsive tissues (3T3 LI cells for adipose tissue, HepG2 cells for hepatic cells, C2C12 cells for skeletal muscle) and in vivo models of insulin resistance and T2DM, such as db/db mice.<br>
The in vitro data suggest that IL-6 exerts its primary effect on insulin signaling in the liver. IL-6 treatment of HepG2 cells leads to the inhibition of insulin induced Akt phosphorylation. This inhibitory effect of IL-6 on insulin signaling is blocked by an anti-IL-6 antibody. Changes in glucose metabolism and insulin effects in the liver have been suggested to be driving causes of the development of insulin resistance and T2D. The effects of IL-6 on insulin signaling<br><br>
in 3T3 LI cells (adipocyte cell line) and C2C12 (skeletal muscle cell line) are examined to determine mechanisms of IL-6 in T2D.<br>
3T3 LI. Experiments were conducted using 3T3 LI mouse adipocyte cell line. In 90% differentiated 3T3 LI cells, the effect of IL-6 on insulin induced glucose uptake was evaluated. In these experiments, treatment with 10 ng/ml of TNFa for 24 hours consistently inhibits insulin induced glucose uptake while 20 ng/ml of IL-6 did not have any effect. These data suggest that IL-6 activity on adipose tissue is not the primary mechanism of IL-6 mediated insulin resistance, but rather adipose tissue may be a main source of IL-6 that then interferes with insulin sensitivity in liver and muscle. The same data were obtained using differentiated primary human adipocytes from subcutaneous depot. The IL-6 effects on glucose uptake using human primary adipocytes from a visceral fat depot is tested because that depot could be more relevant for obesity associated insulin resistance.<br>
HepG2. HepG2 cells were chosen as an in v/tro representative of liver tissue. HepG2 cells are human hepatoma cell line where the effect of IL-6 on insulin signaling has been previously shown. In the experiments, 20 ng/ml of IL-6 blocked the insulin induced Akt phosphorylation, a crucial kinase in insulin signaling pathway, with the maximum effect being observed after 60 minutes of incubation; this is consistent with results reported in the scientific literature.<br>
Akt phosphorylation on sub-confluent HepG2 cells in 10 cm dishes was measured after rh IL-6 (20 ng/ml) incubation for 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. During the last 5 minutes of incubation, 0.5 nM, 1 nM and 5 nM insulin were added to induce Akt phosphorylation. Cells were lysed using modified RIPA lysis buffer and Akt phosphorylation was measured using Ser-Phospho-Akt ELISA. Results were obtained using pAkt and Akt ELISA kits (BioSource). At 60 minutes of IL-6 treatment, in the presence of a physiological concentration of insulin (0.5-lnM), Akt<br><br>
phosphorylation was inhibited -50% compared to the control group. Protein concentrations were quantitated with the Pierce BCA protein assay kit.<br>
Effect of IL-6 Antibody<br>
The ability of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody to inhibit IL-6 effects on insulin-induced Akt-phosphorylation was measured. 20 (.ig/ml of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody was able to inhibit the IL-6 effects in HepG2 cells. Figures 8A and 8B show the effect of IL-6 in the presence and absence of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody on insulin induced Akt phosphorylation.<br>
In the top image (Figure 8A), data represent mean +/- SEM. (* Significant compared to (+) insulin, IL-6, P=0.029; ** Significant compared to (+) insulin -t-IL-6, P= 0.02). Sub-confluent HepG2 cells were treated with 20 ng/ml of IL-6 for 60 minutes. During the last 5 minutes of treatment, 1 nM insulin was added and cells were lysed using modified RIPA buffer. Samples were analyzed by ELISA that detects phosphorylation at Ser 473 of Akt. All data were normalized to total Akt measured by ELISA. AME-19a treatment was able to restore normal Akt signaling.<br>
In the bottom image (Figure 8B), a representative western blot is shown. Top bands include samples treated with IL-6 (20 ng/ml, 60 min, 5 min with 1 nM insulin), AME-19a (20 ug/ml +/- IL-6 at 20 ng/ml for 60 minutes, 5 minutes with 1 nM insulin) or buffer. Blot was probed with anti-phospho Ser/Akt antibody (upper panel) (pS473, Biosource). The lower bands (the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-Akt from BioSource) demonstrate that equivalent protein was loaded per lane.<br>
Metlrod: HEPG2 cells were grown in 100 mm tissue culture dishes until confluency. Cells were starved overnight in DMEM-1%BSA. AME-19a (20 ug/ml)<br><br>
was incubated on cells for -30 minutes prior to IL-6 addition. IL-6 (20 ng/ml) +/-AME-19a (20 ug/ml) were incubated for -30 minutes prior to addition to cells. Samples were incubated on cells for 60 minutes, at 37°C; then 1 nM insulin (final concentration) was added to cells for 5 minutes, at room temperature. Cells were washed immediately with 3 rinses of ice cold PBS. Plates were frozen until lysis. Phospho Akt and total Akt were determined using ELISA kits (BioSource and Sigma).

Primary rat hepatocytes<br>
Primary hepatocytes represent a more relevant in vitro system suitable for testing the effect of IL-6 and anti-IL-6 antibodies (or other IL-6 antagonists) on insulin signaling and the insulin effect on liver glucose production. To determine PI3 kinase (PI3K) activation in rat hepatocytes treated by insulin, IL-6 and/or IL-6 mAb, isolated cells were treated with insulin in the presence and absence of 5 ng/ml IL-6, and the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, IRS-1 (Figure 12A), and Akt (Figure 12B) was determined using ELISA assays and Western blot analysis. In addition, the effects of IL-6 on insulin stimulated IRSl/p85 association were examined (Figures 11A and B). The experiments were performed as follows:<br>
Primary rat hepatocytes (-2 months old) in 6 well collagen coated plates were equilibrated overnight in Hepatoczyme media. On the next day, cells were starved for 6 hours in DMEM-1% BSA-penn strep; then incubated with hIL-6 (5 ng/ml); anti-IL-6 antibody (AME-19a) (20 ng/ml) or anti-IL-6 antibody (AME-19a) +bJL-6 for 90 minutes at 37°C. Cells were pretreated for 1 hour with anti-IL-6 antibody (AME-19a) prior to addition of the combination. The combination was also preincubated prior to addition to the cells. 5 nM of insulin (from BioSource)<br><br>
was added to cells for 5 minutes; then cells were aspirated and lysed immediately with BioSource extraction buffer + protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were diluted 1:10 and tested in ELISAs (from Biosource).<br>
IRSl/p85 Association:<br>
Equal amounts of protein (45 ug) were incubated overnight with 2ug of anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibody (from Upstate, Item #06-248). The samples were than immunoprecipitated with protein A beads for 1 hour and eluted with 3x sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The IP samples were than run on 4-12% SDS-Page gel and then transferred to membrane for Western blot analysis. The membranes were probed with: (1) 1:100 diluted p85 mAb (from Upstate, Item #05-217) for IRS-1 associated p85, i.e., the active PI3K (as shown in FIG. 1.1 A); and (2) 1:600 diluted IRS-1 mAb (from BD Biosciences, Item #611395) for total IRS-1 as a loading control (as shown in FIG. 1 IB).<br>
The data indicate that IL-6 treatment leads to a decrease of insulin-induced phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1 and Akt. This effect of IL-6 was abolished when cells were pretreated with anti-IL-6 antibody (clone AME-19a). In addition, IL-6 inhibited insulin induced p85 (subunits of PI3K) association with IRS-1. Again, this effect of IL-6 was inhibited by pretreatment with anti-IL-6 antibody.<br>
In vivo experiments<br>
The effects of IL-6 on insulin sensitivity have not been extensively tested in animals. In order to evaluate whether anti-IL-6 therapy would improve insulin sensitivity and T2DM, db/db mice and C57/B16 males on a high fat diet have been treated with commercial anti-mouse IL-6 antibody (obtained from R&amp;D Systems).<br>
db/db mice<br><br>
The effects of anti IL-6 treatment are tested using db/db mice of different ages. Mice between 8-10 weeks of age are characterized by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, thus representing earlier stages of the disease, while mice 12-14 weeks of age are characterized by elevated glucose levels in addition to hyperinsulinemia, thus representing advanced stages of T2DM. Both age groups of mice are used to test the ability of anti IL-6 therapy to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT).<br>
The db/db mice have non-functional leptin signaling due to the mutation within the leptin receptor. These mice develop obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance as the mice age, with the first symptoms being detected when the mice are 6-8 weeks old. Two groups of mice of different ages - 8 and 12 weeks old - have been treated with 5 mg/kg of anti IL-6 mAb and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) was performed one day and 7 days post treatment. The treatment schedule is shown in Figure 15.<br>
In 8-week old animals, treatment with anti IL-6 mAb did not have an effect on glucose clearance during GTT. Anti IL-6 mAb treatment lead to improvement in glucose tolerance (GT) in 12 week old animals, although the effect was not statistically significant (p=0.063). This improvement in GTT was seen at day 7 post treatment. In addition, serum samples before and after the completion of the study were analyzed for their adipokine and adiponectin profiles. The levels oiTL-6, TNFa and MCP-1 were below the detection levels. This data taken together with results from ipGTT may suggest that: db/db animals are not a good model to study anti IL-6 effects on insulin resistance; and tissue levels of IL-6 are more relevant for a possible role that IL-6 may play in development of insulin resistance and T2DM.<br>
Diet Induced Obesity (DIP) -Animal Model for Obesity and Insulin Resistance<br><br>
C57/B1 male mice were fed a diet comprising 60% fat for 20-35 weeks. They developed obesity (average body weight was 50.5 grams) and an increase in fasting blood glucose levels (FBG &gt;145 mg/dl). In addition, they have impaired GT.<br>
DIO animals were treated with 10 mg/kg of murine anti IL-6 Ab (R&amp;D Systems). Overall, they received 50 mg/kg of anti IL-6 mAb over the period of 3 weeks. ipGTT was performed after the first 2 doses (day 5), after the 4th dose (days 12 and<br>
16) and after the 5th dose (day 23). At the same time, blood was obtained for measurements of adipocytokines and adiponectin.<br>
Anti IL-6 treatment did not improve glucose tolerance at days 5 and 12; however, when performed at days 16 and 23, an improvement in glucose clearance as well as in levels of glucose excursion were observed. This improvement reached statistical significance at 39, 60 and 90 minutes during GTT.<br>
In another set of experiments, DIO animals were treated weekly (2 doses during the first week and 1 dose each week for the subsequent 4 weeks) with 10 and 20 mg/kg of anti IL-6 Ab and 20 mg/kg IgG isotype control via i.p route. HOMA-IR (after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment), ipGTT, ipITT and adipokine profile (at 6 weeks of treatment) have been performed.<br>
HOMA-IR Analysis on Anti-IL-6 Ab Treated DIO Animals:<br>
In these studies, there was a decrease in fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in DIO animals treated with 10 and 20 mg/kg of murine anti-IL-6 Ab and isotype control. Animals were bleed and fasting glucose and insulin levels were determined using Trace/DMA glucose (ox) (thermo Electron Corp) and Ultra Sensitive Rat Insulin Elisa (Crystal Chem), respectively. These values were used to determine HOMA-IR. The HOMA-IR index reflects the status of insulin sensitivity and it correlates well with the finding from the clamp study. HOMA-IR is<br><br>
calculated by the formula: (lasting glucose (mM) A tasting insulin (mlU/Litjj/zz.D (Figures 13 A, B and C).<br>
The improvements in HOMA-IR were observed after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment (Figures 13A-C show the data after 6 weeks of treatment). At the end of the study, ipGTT and ipITT were performed. In both tests, anti-IL-6 treatment (20mg/ml) significantly improved both glucose excursion and clearance when compared to isotype treated animals.<br>
Adipokine and cytokine analysis of serum samples from control and anti-IL-6 treated animals indicated that IL-6 neutralization lead to a decrease in circulating IL-6 and TNFa levels along with the decreased trend of MCP-1 and resistin levels. In another set of data, adiponectin levels were increased with anti-IL-6 treatment.<br>
Histological analysis of liver samples from the treatment and control groups was performed. The samples were stained with Oil Red O staining to determine the lipid content in the liver parenchyma. The liver lipid content in the DIO animals was reduced in response to treatment by the murine anti-IL-6 antibody.<br>
The staining reveals that 34% of vehicle treated liver sample were lipid related in untreated animals and only 8% in 20 mg/kg anti-IL-6 treated animals (Figures 14A-F). Figures 14A and D represent the control group; Figures 14B and E represent the untreated DIO animals; and Figures 14C and F represent the anti-IL-6 treated animals. The increased lipid liver content has been associated with development of insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Thus, it is conceivable that IL-6 neutralization lead to the improvement in insulin sensitivity and T2DM by affecting liver lipid metabolism. These data taken together strongly suggest the role of IL-6 in the pathology of Type 2 Diabetes and that neutralization of IL-6 could improve insulin sensitivity.<br><br>
Additional Studies<br>
The effects of IL-6 in the presence or absence of human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody on insulin stimulated IRS1 phosphorylation, association with p85/PI3K, insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation, glycogen syntheses, and the involvement of SOCS3 and STAT signaling in HepG2 cells are monitored. Additional experiments examine the effect of IL-6 on glucose induced insulin secretion from pancreatic islets. The data published to date describe both inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects of IL-6 on insulin secretion from rat islets. Freshly isolated rat islets (from Liefscann) are treated with IL-6 and human engineered anti-IL-6 antibody (AME-19a) in the presence or absence of glucose. Levels of insulin secreted from islets under various treatments are measured.<br>
C2C12. C2C12 cells are used to study the effect of insulin on skeletal muscle. Experiments to examine IRS 1 and Glut4 expression, insulin induced IRS 1 phosphorylation, and the effects of IL-6 on adiponectin action are performed.<br>
Advantages:<br>
Inhibition of IL-6 activity by the IL-6 antibody of the present invention could represent a significant therapeutic advance since it will be able to improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic control without the side effects of existing agents. In addition, current therapies do little to control systemic inflammation, which is suggested to be the underlining cause of T2DM, associated diabetic complications. A therapeutic like the IL-6 antibody of the present invention, in addition to increasing insulin sensitivity, would be expected to inhibit systemic inflammation and prevent development of diabetic complications.<br><br>
The number of patients affected by T2DM is growing and it is estimated to extend to 300 million individuals by 2025. An anti IL-6 antibody could be used as a monotherapy or in combination with other already existing OAD, such as sulphonylureas, biguanides (e.g., Metphormin), thiazolidinediones, meglitinide (e.g., repaglinide), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acarbose). In addition, it could be used in combination with insulin or other therapeutics, such as to improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control and avoid hypoglycemic events that are associated with insulin treatment. It is also expected that in addition to improvement of insulin sensitivity and regulation of glucose levels in T2D and Metabolic Syndrome patients, anti IL-6 therapy would have a beneficiary effect on CV changes often observed in these patients.
