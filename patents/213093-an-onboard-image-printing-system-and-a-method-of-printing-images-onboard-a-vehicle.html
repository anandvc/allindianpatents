CAMERA AND ASSOCIATED PRINTER APPARATUS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to an image printing system. The invention relates particularly, but not necessarily exclusively, to an image printing system and to a me:hod of prinimg images for use in or on a conveyance.<br>
In this specification, unless rhe context clearly indicates otherwise, the term "conveyance" is to be understood in a broad sense as any suitable device for conve\'ing persons and or goods and includes road vehicles, aircraft, rail vehicles, waterbome craft, spacecraft, or the like.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Persons on trips such as holidays generally take a number of photographs at \'arious locations m order to create a collection of images which may later be used to assist in recalling experiences or events of significance that occurred during the holiday. Also, there are times when, for business or other puiposes. ii is required to record an image. For example, at the scene of an accident, it may be necessary to take photographs of damaged vehicles and surrounding areas in order to conduct an investigation as to the cause of the accident.<br>
Typically, photographs are taken using one of a known number of photographic techniques such as exposure of a photographic film or. as is becoming increasingly popular, by digital capture of an image. Each film or memory storage device that is used to store photographs has a limited capacity. Thus, in the case of photographic film the number of images which can be recorded depends on the length of the film. hi the case of storing digital images, the resolution of the images and the memory capacity are determinative of the number of images which can be stored. Once the capacity of the storage means has been reached, the storage means must be replaced in order to capture further images.<br>
Further, in order to produce hard copies of the recorded images it is necessary to either take the storage means (or the camera itself if the storage means is not removable) to an imaging bureau for production of hard copies or to print off a copy of each photograph using a PC and a printer. Both of these approaches tend to be somewhat inconvenient as result of, firstly, the time taken to produce the hard copy images and, secondly, the different location that the storage device must be transported to in order to produce hard-copies. A third inconvenience is having to make necessary film and/or storage medium changes once the capacity of the storage means has been reached. This is particularly so in the case of digital cameras where memory storage devices can be expensive.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The system may include a receiving means which communicates with the camera to enable data relating to an image captured by the camera and stored in the camera to be received and downloaded to the processing means.<br>
The system may include a communications sub-system mounted in the conveyance for enabling data stored in the data capturing device to be transmitted to a remote location.<br>
The processing means may include a layout engine in communication with the detecting means. The layout engine may layout data elements to be communicated to the printer so that, when printed on a suitable print media, the data are presented as a visually discernible image.<br>
The processing means ma\' further comprise a data manipulating means in communication wnh ihc lav'out engine for manipulating the data to provide the formatted data.<br>
The printing unit may include a printer controller, for receiving the formatted data to be printed, and a printer. The printer may be a full color printer. Preferabl}", the printer is a photo quality color printer.<br>
Still further, the printer may be an ink jet printer. The printer may comprise a pagewidth ink jet printhead. Thus, the printhead may comprise an array of nozzles, said array being fabricated by microelectromechanical techniques.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of printing images, the method including the steps of:<br>

processing output data, which is output from said data capturing means, to provide formatted data suitable for printing; and<br>
printing, on an onboard printing unit associated with said processing means, said formatted data to provide said image.<br>
The method may include capturing the data by means of a camera which is, preferably, a digital camera.<br>
The method may include causing the camera to communicate with a receiving means in the conveyance to enable data relating to an image captured by the camera and stored in the camera to be received and downloaded.<br>
Further, the method may include causing data stored in the data capturing device to be transmitted to a remote location.<br>
In addition, the method may include performing a layout operation on data elements to be communicated to the printer so that, when printed on a suitable print media, the data are presented as a visually discernible image.<br>
The method may also include manipulating said data prior to printing the data to provide said formatted data.<br>

Detailed description of the drawings<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1 of the drawings, an image printing system, in accordance with the invention is illustrated and is designated generally by the reference numeral 10. The system 10 is intended particularly for providing hard-copies from digital cameras and is intended to be installed in a motor vehicle (not shown).<br>
Accordingly, the system 10 includes a digital camera 12. The digital camera 12 is received in a suitable receptacle such as a slot 510 (Figure 16) in an in car entertainment unit 500. Instead, the camera 12 can be received in a dedicated slot in a dashboard or other convenient fitting of the motor vehicle to communicate with the remaining parts of the system 10.<br>
AP62 PCT<br><br>
The system 10 further includes a processing means 14 which is able to be placed in communication with the camera 12 when the camera 12 is in its slot. It will be appreciated that the camera 12 has contacts thereon which, when the camera 12 is driven home in its slot, engage contacts in a base of the slot. The contacts in the base of the slot are. in turn, electrically connected to the processing means 14 to enable communication to be established bervveen the camera 12 and the processing means 14.<br>
The processing means includes a layout engine 28 which communicates with a rasterization module 34 via a data line 32. The rasterization module, in turn, communicates with a page compression module 38 of the processing means 14 via a data line 36.<br>
The system 10 includes a printing unit 16 having a printer controller 42 in communication with the page compression module 38 of the processing means 14 via a data line 40. The printer controller 42 controls operation of a printer 100 of the printing unit 16.<br>
In addition, the system 10 includes a wireless communications sub-system 50. The wireless communications sub-system 50 enables images captured by the camera 12 to be transmitted to a remote location, in addition to being printed on a printer 100 of the printing unit 16.<br>
Certain of the components of the system 10 are now described in greater detail.<br>
Referring to Figure 15 of the drawings, various forms of wireless communications sub-system 50 could be employed. One technique is to use a combination of satellite communications and a mobile telephone network.<br>
The sub-system 50 includes a mobile station 52 (being the motor vehicle in this invention) and a fixed station 54. A satellite is designated generally by the reference numeral 56. The satellite 56 communications with the mobile station 52 via a satellite recei\"er 58. The satellite 56 also communications with the base station 54 via a'satellite up link 60.<br>
In addition, the mobile station 52 includes a mobile phone network based transmitter 64 which communicates with a mobile phone network based receiver 66 at the bay station 54.<br>
To enable data to be transmitted from the mobile station 52 to the base station 54, satellite transmission via the satellite 56 is employed as well as the mobile telephone network using the transmitter 64 and the receiver 66.<br>
The layout engine 28 maybe required to manipulate data sourced from a plurality of sources. This data may have no embedded layout information. Depending on the kind of content supplied, it may be necessary to firstly create a formatted description of the content which can then be used to generate one or more pages of page description language.<br>
The page description language to be generated by the layout engine 28 determines the kinds of data elements, and the structuring of elements that may be used to compose a page. For example, if the page description language used is postscript, then the elements that are used to describe the page include filled and stroked paths consisting of line segments and curves, text with corresponding font definitions, and images.<br><br>
A template for laying out data may be d&gt;namically generated by the layout engine 28 based on user choices, may be a static built-in template, or may even be obtained from some other source such as the source suppling the data.<br>
A number of possibilities exist for layout and content descriptions that can be used to generate a set of consistent layouts for a page containing a number of elements which may be both textual and graphical.<br>
One example of a method of data layout that allows data to be sourced from a plurality of separate locations is through using a combination of XML (extensible Markup Language) and XSL (extensible Stylesheet Language).<br>
XML allows content to be marked up by applying a set of tags to the content. Tlie definition of each tag in particular XML content is described in a separate scheme referenced by the XML.<br>
XSL provides a method of transforming XVIL into another format (for example HTML) whilst simultaneously performing selection and filtering operations.<br>
The combination of XML content and XSL as a layout specification allows for descriptions of one or more pages to be produced in a fomiatting language. The fomiatting language may then be translated into a page description language suitable for prinrmg (ie, one that provides descriptions of objects, their locations and compositing details).<br>
Another possible layout and content description which can be used is a document which is specified in HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) which is supplied to the layout engine 28 for the purposes of creating a page description. One or more stylesheets specified according to CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) standard may also be supplied, allowing the layout engine 28 to associate a supplied style with a set of tags. If no style sheet is supplied a set of default styles internal to the layout engine 28 is adopted.<br>
The HTML document is then translated into a page description language suitable for printing.<br>
The rasterization module 34 is provided to convert from page description language into a format that can be sent to the print engine (not shown) of the printer 100. This format may take a number of forms depending on the characteristics of the print engine such as the color gamut of the output device, the tvpes of markers to be used, the number of markers being used (and their respective colors) and the medium being marked.<br>
The page description received by the rasterization module 34 may also take a number of forms. Many page description languages are program oriented in that a page is.described in a pragmatically generated manner. Other page description languages describe pages in terms of a set of objects placed on a page by way of a painter's algorithms. Still other page description languages describe a page in terms of a compositing model that defines a hierarchy of objects located on a page, each with a defined compositing order relative to a neighborhood of other objects.<br>
A number of ways exist in which rasterization of a page, a set of pages, a sub-set of objects on a page or a sub set of objects on a number of pages may be processed by the rasterization module 34.<br><br>
One method ot rasterization involves a divide-and-conquer approach in which the page description language is initially interpreted to form a model of the page. Tlie page is scanned and objects are rasterized as they are encountered and then composited to form pixmap output for a portion of the page. The pixmap is then mapped into the color space of the output device or dithered (or en-or defused) to match the characteristics required by the output device.<br>
Another method of rasterization which may be employed by the rasterization module 34 is to render each object in full or partially according to the t\pe of object the co\-erage of the object with respect to the page (and the portion of the page currently being rendered) and caching aspects of the object.  For instance, if a character string is to be rasterized, each character in the string may be rasterized in full and then cached for later reuse whereas a filled rectangle may only be rasterized as necessary.<br>
Depending on the output requirements for the rasterization module 34, each page to be rasterized may be generated in its entirety or generated in a band wise fashion for forwarding to the page compression module 38. In this way, if a page is larger than a certain size, and memory needs to be conserved, a page may be divided into a number of bands that may be rasterized on demand.<br>
The page compression module 38 is provided to reduce the amount of rasterized page data that needs to be transferred to the printer controller 42. The page data is compressed using one or more of a number of techniques that do not result in a visible degradation in the quality of the final printed image.<br>
A method of compressing contone data is JPEG compression.  With this compression technique. contone pixels are converted into a luminance/chrominance representation which may then efficienilv be compressed by using quantization of a discrete cosine transformation of the data. This quantized \ersion of the data is entropy coded to reduce large runs of zero valued elements resulting in an overall 10:1 reduction in data size with virtually no resulting significant loss of image quality.<br>
The wavelet transform, as adopted by the JPEG 2000' standard, is a method used to compress contone data. Two different wavelet transforms are specified by JPEG 2000, namely, a 9/7 wavelet transform for lossy compression and a 5/3 3 wavelet transform for lossless compression. Given that the results of compression using the 9.7 wavelet transform are \i5ually superior to the results of compression using the discrete cosine transform, it is reasonable to expect that a compression ratio of at least 50:1 can be achieved without significant degradation of the reconstructed image.<br>
The scan order adopted by JPEG 2000 is a spiral scan of the original image, traversed one pixel at a time. This is not convenient for printing applications since it would require that the complete page be decoded and stored or that the page be decoded multiple times for printing to be carried out. To remedy this, it may be possible to adopt an alternative scan order that traverses each image row in sequence such that each portion of the image received can be immediately decoded and printed independently of the receipt of the complete compressed page.<br><br>
Compression of bilevel images may be performed by using the commonly known Group 3 or Group 4 fax algorithms . These algorithms exploit the two dimensional properties of typical bilevel images to achieve an average 30:1 compression.<br>
Tlie JBIG (Joint Bilevel Image Group) has defined a method for the compression of bilevel images called JBIG2 that is able to yield higher compression ratios than the older Group 3 and Group 4 fax algorithnis with a more complex encoder/decoder combination.  Essentially JBIG2 relies on the encoder to successfully segment an input image into a number of regions that are compressed with techniques specialised according to the properties of the region being encoded. Regions that contain text elements arc encoded using an algorithm that stores encoded versions of bitmaps corresponding to each character. Regions that contain half toned images (particularly for the case when ordered halftoning has been used) are encoded by storing a dictionan.' of half toned patterns and the regions to which they apply. Regions that contain other elements such as line art are encoded into a compressed bitmap representation.<br>
In certain instances, page compression may not be requu'ed.  In that case, the page compression module 38 functions using null compression wherein the page is not compressed at all and the page compression module 38 functions as a pass through module.<br>
The printer controller 42 is responsible for handling the hardware specific aspects of the printing process. This enables a number of different types of printmg mechanisms or printers 100 to be adopted without changing details of the system further up the chain of print modules.<br>
The printer controller 42 receives a rasterized version of each page which is usually compressed using one of the compression techniques described above. The page may be received in its entirety or in a bandwise fashion depending on the size of the page and the functioning of the preceding modules 34 and 38.<br>
In the printer controller 42. the page data are progressively accessed in printer order, decompressed if required and organised into a format suitable for hardware of the printer 100 to enable the hardware of the printer 100 to program its printhead 300. This recognition may include such factors as may be necessary to account for special characteristics of a particular printhead 300 such as up scaling and dithering of the print data and adjustments, if necessary, for the markers and paper being used.<br>
Referring to Figures 2 to 7 of the drawings, the printer 100 is described in greater detail.<br>
The printer 100 includes a chassis 112 (Figure 3) which is covered by a top cover 116. The printer 100 has an access opening 118 in the top cover. The access opening 118 is closed off by a flap 120. The flap 120 is spring biased so that, when a cartridge 122 has been removed from the printer 100, the flap is urged upwards to close off the access opening 118.<br>
The device which sends commands to the printer 100 can either be hard wired to the printer 100, for example, via a wiring loom of the motor vehicle or, instead, the device may send commands to the printer 100 in a wireless manner. For this purpose, the printer 100 includes a port 124 able to detect wireless communications, such as infra-red communications.<br><br>
The printer 100 incorporates a printhead 300 (Figure 3). The printhead 300 is a pagewidth mk jei printhead. More particularly, the printhead 300 is a four color printhead, or three color plus infra red ink. printhead which prints photo quality prints on print media stored in the cartridge 122. The printhead 300 comprises an array of nozzles to provide printing at 1600 dpi.  The nozzles of the printhead 300 are manufactured using the applicant's Memjet technology. The prnithead is described in greater detail belov.,<br>
The printhead 300 receives commands from a printed cu'cuit board (PCB) 136 secured to the chassis 112.<br>
A pair of drive motors 13S and 140 are mounted on a sidewall 142 of the chassis 112. The dn\e motor 138, which is in the form of a stepper motor, drives a first drive arrangement in the form of a fu-st gear train 144. The first gear train 144 is mounted on a side molding 146 of the chassis 112.<br>
The drive motor 140, which is also m the form of a stepper motor, drives a drive roller 148 Ma a second drive arrangement in the form of a second gear train 150.<br>
The printhead 300 receives mk from ink hoses 152 which communicate with an ink supply reservoir 154 (Figure 7) of the cartridge 122 via an mk supply manifold 156. as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
Refeiring to Figure 4 of the drawings, an exploded \ lew of the printer 100 is illustrated. It is to he noted that the printhead 300 communicates with the PCB 136 \ia a TAB film 154.<br>
A slot 158 is defined in the side molding 146. The slot 158 receives a corresponding formation of the cartridge 122 in it. Further, a roller set 160 is mounted on a base 162 of the printer 100. The roller set 160 comprises a rotatable axle 162. A cog 164 is mounted proximate each end of the axle 162.  Each cog 164 engages a longitudinally extending rack 200, 202, one on each side of the cartridge 122, for inhibitmg skewing of the cartridge 122 as it is inserted into, or withdrawn from, the printer 100.<br>
The first gear train 144 engages a pick up roller 16S of the printer 100. The pick up roller 16S picks up print media in the form of a sheet of paper from a stack 170 of paper (Figure 5) in the cartridge 122 for feeding to the printhead 300 of the printer 100 when printing is to be effected.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figure 4 of the drawings, the first gear train 144 is powered by the stepper motor 138 via an axle 172 extending across the printer 100 to convey power from the stepper motor 138 to the first gear train 144. A gear 174 is mounted against the molding 146 at one end of the axle 172. The gear 174 drives a reduction gear set 176. Further, the reduction gear set 176 communicates,with a reversing mechanism 178. Accordingly, the gear train 144 performs two functions. When the reversing mechanism 178 is not selected, the gear train 144 engages an upper rack 180 on the cartridge 122 for feeding the cartridge 122 into the printer 100 or ejecting the cartridge 122 from the printer 100. Instead, when the reversing mechanism has been selected, it engages the pick up roller 168 or, more particularly, a gear 182 mounted at an end of the pick up roller 168. The gear train 144 then serves to feed the paper to the drive roller 148 for conveying to the printhead 300.<br>
Referring now to Figures 6 and 7 of the drawings, the cartridge 122 is described in greater detail.<br><br>
The cartridge 122 comprises a base moldmg 190. The base molding 190 is closed off by a metal cover 192. The cover 192 has a pair of transversely spaced openings 194 defined in a front edge thereof. These openings 194 permit the pick up roller 168 of the primer 100 to engage a topmost sheet of the stack 170 of paper within the cartridge 122.<br>
A toothed rack 196 is pro\'ided on one side of the cartr-.dge 122. The toothed rack 196 defines the upper rack 180 which is engaged by a gear of the first gear tram 144 for insertion of the cartridge 122 uito. or its ejection from, the printer 100. A rib 198 extends longiiudmally along the side of the toothed rack 196. The rib 198 is received in the slot 158 in the side molding 146 of the printer 100. A lower surface ot the toothed rack 196 also has one of the longitudinally extending racks 200 (Figure 7) for engagement with. one of the cogs 164. An opposed side of the base molding 190 of the cartridge 122 carries the other of the longitudinally extending racks 202 which engages the other cog 164 for inhibiting skewing of the cartridge 122 when it is inserted into, or ejected from, the printer 100.<br>
A feed slot 204 is defined at a front edge of the metal cover through which a sheet of paper to be printed is passed in use. The feed slot 204 is partially defined by a plastics strip 206 which inhibits more than one sheet of paper being fed to the printhead 300 at any one time.<br>
A transversely extending trough 208 is defined outwardly of the strip 206. The trough 208 accommodates a sprung roller 210 therein. The roller 210 is supported in the trough 208 via a pluralu\' ot clips 212.<br>
The roller 210 is biased upwardly relative to a base of the trough 208 via a plurality of leaf sprmgs 214, Tlie leaf springs 214 are formed integrally with an L-shaped metal bracket 216 which partially forms the trough 208. The roller 210 is a snap-fit in the clips 212.<br>
A platen 218 is accommodated in the base molding 190. The platen 218 is spring biased via a<br>
plurality of leaf springs 220 which engage a fioor 222 of the base molding 190 for urging the stack 1"0 oi'<br>
paper against the cover 192.	-<br>
The ink supply reservoir 154 includes an ink supply molding 224 formed integrally with the base molding 190. The ink supply molding 224 defines a plurality of ink supply channels 226. Each ink supply channel 226 contains a particular color of ink. In this context, the term '*color" is to be understood as including inks which are invisible in the visible spectrum such as, for example, infra red inks.<br>
The channels 226 are closed off by a flexible bladder-like membrane 228 which is heat-healed to the molding 224. It will be appreciated that, as ink is withdrawn from each channel 226, the associated membrane 228 collapses into the channel 226 thereby inhibiting the ingress of air into that channel 226.<br>
Each channel 226 communicates with an ink outlet 220. Each ink outlet 230 is in the form of a mpturable seal.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figure 4 of the drawings, the ink supply manifold 156 of the printer 100 includes pins 232. These pins 232 communicate with the ink supply hoses 152. When the cartridge 122 is inserted into the printer 100, and the cartridge 122 is driven home by the gear train 144, the pms 232 pierce the seals 230 to place the hoses 152 in communication -vith their associated ink supply channels 226.<br><br>
Tlie cartridge 122 includes a quality assurance chip 234. This chip 234 ensures correct communications between the cartridge 122 and the printer 100 and that the cartridge 122 is of the required quality. The chip 234 communicates with the printer 100 via chip contacts 236 mounted on the ink supply manifold 156 of the printer 100. Thus, when the cartridge 122 is driven home by the gear train 144. the chip 234 engages the contacts 236 for enabling communications to be established between the chip 234 and the circuit board 136 of the printer 100.<br>
The cartridge 122 is a disposable unit so that, once its ink.supply and paper supply have been depleted, the cartridge is disposed of  Instead, the cartridge 122 maybe re-useable.  In the latter case, once the supply of ink and paper in the cartridge 122 have been depleted and the cartridge 122 is ejected troni the printer 100, the used, empty cartridge 122 can be taken by a user to a supplier for a refund. It is to be noted that the cartridge 122 is automatically ejected from the printer 100 once its supply of paper and or ink has been depleted.<br>
Referring to Figures 8 to 14 of the drawings, the pnnthead 300 is described in greater detail. The printhead 300 comprises an array, which will be described in greater detail below, of nozzle assemblies. Referring initially to Figure 8 of the drawings, a nozzle assembly is illustrated and is designated generally by the reference numeral 400<br>
Tlie assemblv 400 includes a silicon substrate or wafer 416 on which a dielectric laver 418 is deposited. A CMOS passivation layer 420 is deposited on the dielectric layer 418.<br>
Each nozzle assembly 400 includes a nozzle 422 defining a nozzle opening 424, a connectnig member in the form of a lever arm 426 and an actuator 428. Tnt lever arm 426 connects the actuator 428 to the nozzle 422.<br>
As shown in greater detail in Figures 9 to 11 of the drawings, the nozzle 422 comprises a crown portion 430 with a skirt portion 432 depending from the cro\\"n portion 430. The skirt portion 432 forms part of a peripheral wall of a nozzle chamber 434. The nozzle opening 424 is in fluid communication with the nozzle chamber 434.  It is to be noted that the nozzle opening 424 is surrounded by a raised rim 436 which "pins" a meniscus 438 (Figure 9) of a body of ink 440 m the nozzle chamber 434.<br>
An ink inlet aperture 442 (shown most clearly in Figure 13 of the drawings) is defined in a floor 446 of the nozzle chamber 434. The aperture 442 is in fluid communication with an ink inlet channel 448 defined through the substrate 416.<br>
A wall portion 450 bounds the aperture 442 and extends upwardly from the floor portion 446. The skirt portion 432, as indicated above, of the nozzle 422 defines a first part of a peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 434 and the wall portion 450 defines a second part of the peripheral wall of the nozzle chamber 434.<br>
The wall 450 has an inwardly directed lip 452 at its free end which serves as a fluidic seal which inhibits the escape of ink when the nozzle 422 is displaced, as will be described in greater detail below.  It will be appreciated that, due to the viscosity of the ink 440 and the small dimensions of the spacing<br><br>
between the lip 452 and the skin portion 432, the inwardly directed lip 452 and surface tension function as a seal for inhibiting the escape of ink from the nozzle chamber 434.<br>
The actuator 428 is a thermal bend actuator and is connected to an anchor 454 extending up\\ardl}' from the substrate 416 or, more particularly, from the CMOS passivation layer 420. The anchor 454 is mounted on conductive pads 456 which form an electrical connection with the actuator 42S.<br>
The actuator 428 comprises a pair of first, active beams 458 arranged above a pair of second, passive beams 460. In a preferred embodmient, both pairs of beams 458 and 460 are of. or include, a conductive ceramic material such as titanium nitride (TiN).<br>
Both pairs of beams 458 and 460 have their first ends anchored to the anchor 454 and their opposed ends connected to the arm 426. When a current is caused to flow through the active beams 45S thermal expansion of the beams 458 result. As the passive beams 460, through which there is no current How, do not expand at the same rate, a bending moment is created causing the arm 426 and. hence, the nozzle 422 to be displaced downwardly towards the substrate 416 as shown in Figure 10 of the drawings. This causes ejection of ink through the nozzle opening 424 as shown at 462 in Figure 10 of the drawmgs. When the source of heat is remo\ed from the active beams 458. i.e. by stopping current tlow, the nozzle 422 returns to its quiescent position as shown in Figure 11 of the drawings. When the nozzle 422 returns to its quiescent position, an ink droplet 464 is formed as a result of the breaking of an ink droplet neck as illustrated at 466 in Figure 11 of the drawings. The ink droplet 464 then travels on to the print media such as a sheet of paper. As a result of the formation of the ink droplet 464, a "negative" meniscus is formed as shown at 468 in Figure 11 of the drawings. This "negati\'e" meniscus 468 results in an inflow of ink 440 into the nozzle chamber 434 such that a new meniscus 438 is formed in readiness for the next ink drop ejection from the nozzle assembly 400.<br>
Referring now to Figures 12 to 14 of the drawings, a part of the printhead 300 is described in greater detail. The printhead 300 is a four color printhead. Accordingly, the printhead 300 includes four groups 370 of nozzle assemblies, one for each color.  Each group 370 has its nozzle assemblies 400 arranged in two rows 372 and 374. One of the groups 370 is shown in greater detail in Figure 13 of the drawings.<br>
To facilitate close packing of the nozzle assemblies 400 in the rows 372 and 374, the nozzle assemblies 400 in the row 374 are offset or staggered with respect to the nozzle assemblies 400 in the row 372. Also, the nozzle assemblies 400 in the row 372 are spaced apart sufficiently far from each other to enable the lever arms 426 of the nozzle assemblies 400 in the row 374 to pass between adjacent nozzles 422 of the assemblies 400 in the row 372. It is to be noted that each nozzle assembly 400 is substantially dumbbell shaped so that the nozzles 422 in the row 372 nest between the nozzles 422 and the actuators 428 of adjacent nozzle assemblies 400 in the row 374.<br>
Further, to facilitate close packing of the nozzles 422 m the rows 372 and 374, each nozzle 422 is substantially hexagonally shaped.<br><br>
The substrate 416 has bond pads 376 arranged thereon which provide the electrical connections, via the pads 456, to the actuators 428 of the nozzle assemblies 400. These electrical connections are formed via the CMOS layer (not shown).<br>
A nozzle guard 380 is mounted on the substrate 416 of the printhead 300. The nozzle guard 3 SO includes a body member 382 having a plurality of passages 384 defined therethrough. The passages 3S4 are in register with the nozzle openings 424 of the nozzle assemblies 400 of the printhead 300 such that. when ink is ejected from any one of the nozzle openings 424, the ink passes through the associated passage 384 before striking the print media.<br>
The body member 382 is mounted in spaced relationship relative to the nozzle assemblies 400 by limbs or struts 386. One of the stmts 836 has air inlet openings 388 defined therein.<br>
When the printhead 300 is in operation, air is charged through the inlet openings 388 to be forced through the passages 384 together with ink travelling through the passages 384. The purpose of the air is to maintain the passages 384 clear of foreign particles. A danger exists that these foreign particles, such as dust particles, could fall onto the nozzle assemblies 400 adversely affecting their operation. With the provision of the air inlet openings 388 in the nozzle guard 380 this problem is, to a large extent, obviated.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the printer 100 is built into and forms part of an in-car entertainment unit 500, as shown in Figure 16 of the drawings.<br>
The ICE unit 500, in addition to a CD player 502 and a radio having controls 504, includes a full color LCD 506. Tlie unit 500 functions as a satellite navigation unit and may also be used for receiving television signals. The unit 500 incorporates a printer 100 of the type described above. The unit 500 includes a bank of control buttons 508. This bank of buttons 508 constitutes GPS controls and is used for satellite navigation purposes. In addition, the unit includes a slot 510 in which the camera 12 is received to enable images which have previously been captured and which are stored in the camera 12 to be downloaded and printed via the printer 100. The ICE 500 includes a further bank of buttons 512 for controlling the printer 100 and the content printed by the printer 100.<br>
In use, the user, upon returning to the motor vehicle with the camera 12 which has captured various images connects the camera 12 to the remainder of the system 10 via the receiving slot 510 for the camera 12 in the ICE 500 or via some other suitable connection, for example, by USB cable, by removing the storage device of the camera 12 and inserting it into the system 10, by wireless connection, or the like.<br>
The images captured by the camera 12 are transferred to the layout engine 28. The layout engine 28 may also receive a layout determined by the camera 12 during this process. For this purpose, the camera 12 may have built in features for selecting a layout style for each photograph or for grouping a set of photographs on a page of output. The layout engine 28 performs layout of the data elements according to the layout information and generates a description of one or more pages in a suitable page description language such as postscript or PDF which is output on the data line 32 to the rasterization module 34 of the processing means 14. The rasterization module 34, in turn, communicates data along line 36 to the page compression module 38 of the processing means 14.<br><br>
The rasterization module 34 and the page compression module 38 format the data into a suitable format to be printed by the printer 100. Formatted data is. accordingly, output from the page compression module 38 on data line 40 to the printer controller 42 of the printing unit 16. The printer controller 42 controls operation of the printer 100. as described above and the printer generates hard copies of the image captured by then camera 12.<br>
Where provided, the wireless communications sub-s\srem 50 can be used for downloading miages captured by the camera 12 to a remote storage database. This remote storage database may have tacilitics for, for e.xample, automatically publishing the set of photograpiis on a website, histead, the remote storage database may simply act as a repository from which the set of photographs may later be retrieved and viewed or otherwise used as desired by the user.<br>
Accordingly, it is an advantage of the invention that an in-vehicle image processing system is provided which effectively acts as a mobile image processing laboratory and facilitates the almost instantaneous production of photographs. Consequently, a user need not await return to a suitable place to have the images processed into hard copies.<br>
It will be appreciated that a related advantage is that, if a poor image has been captured, this can b detected and rectified while the person is at the venue rather than, possibly, missing out on having an images captured at all.<br>
Another advantage of the in\ention is tliat an integrated system is built into the vehicle having a receptacle for the camera, being the slot, and a built-in printer 100.<br><br><br><br>
