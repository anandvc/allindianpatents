				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a medicinal composition<br>
with improved absorption after oral administration which<br>
comprises a coenzyme Q10 of the following general formula (1-<br>
A) as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Coenzyme Q10 is a class of physiological substances<br>
occurring as component factors of the mitochondrial electron<br>
transfer system within the biological cell. Coenzyme Q10<br>
acts directly as an electron carrier in the oxidative<br>
phosphorylation reactions, through metabolic pathways,<br>
particularly aerobic pathways, to produce ATP and hence energy.<br>
It seems that the demand for coenzyme Q10 is increased in<br>
normal subjects in the state of severe physical fatigue and<br>
patients with cardiovascular disease, chronic debilitating<br>
disease, or on prolonged pharmacotherapy. It has been shown<br>
that a deficiency of coenzyme Q10 occurs particularly in<br>
ischemic heart diseases, senile myocardial sclerosis, and<br>
hypertensive heart diseases. Therefore, it is a sound<br>
therapeutic choice to administer coenzyme Q10 to those<br>
patients.<br>
Moreover, coenzyme Q10 has boon used for non-therapeutic<br>
purposes as a nutrient or nutritional supplement just like<br>
vitamins.<br>
In order that coenzyme Q10 may express its therapeutic<br>
efficacy or nutritional effect, it is most important to<br>
increase the coenzyme Ql0 level within the patient"s tissue<br>
cells.<br>
Coenzyme Q10 is a lipid-soluble. and practically water-<br>
insoluble substance and, therefore, it is only sparingly<br>
soluble in gastric juice. Consequently, oral dosage forms<br>
containing coenzyme Q10 in solid state, such as tablets,<br>
granules, capsules, and suspensions for extemporaneous<br>
preparation, are not well absorbed after oral administration.<br>
This means that a considerably greater amount of coenzyme Q10<br>
than actually needed must be administered to the patient but<br>
such a practice tends to cause adverse gastrointestinal<br>
reactions such as epigastric discomfort, anorexia, nausea,<br>
and diarrheas.<br>
Much research has heretofore been undertaken for<br>
overcoming those disadvantages. Japanese Kokai Publications<br>
Sho-55-81813 and Sho-6l-221131, among others, disclose<br>
coenzyme Q10 formulations of the solution type or the<br>
emulsion/dispersion type. However, such pharmaceutical<br>
devices are not sufficient to improve the absorption of<br>
coenzyme Q10 in a satisfactory measure.<br>
Japanese Kokai Publication Sho-56-18914 discloses a<br>
technology for accelerating the lymphatic absorption of<br>
coenzyme Q10. This technology has been demonstrated to<br>
increase the absorption of coenzyme Q10 in a certain measure<br>
but has not proved practically useful as yet.<br>
Japanese Kokai Publication Sho-60-89442 discloses a<br>
cyclodextrin-clathrated coenzyme Q10 formulation. Japanese<br>
Kokai Publication Sho-60-1124 discloses a coenzyme Q10-<br>
containing ribosomal formulation. Elowever, those coenzyme Q10<br>
preparations require a complicated pharmaceutical procedure<br>
for production and are not practically fully satisfactory.<br>
Italian Patent 1190442 Specification discloses a<br>
technology which, instead of using coenzyme Q10 as such,<br>
comprises converting a reduced form of coenzyme Q10 to a<br>
derivative such as an acyl ester, a sulfuric acid ester, or a<br>
phosphoric acid ester and administering this coenzyme Q10<br>
derivative for enhanced absorption. However, the effect of<br>
the technology has not been supported by experimental data.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has for its object to provide a<br>
medicinal composition comprising coenzymc Q10 as an active<br>
ingredient, which composition features an enhanced absorption<br>
after oral administration.<br>
In the course of their intensive research for overcoming<br>
the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art, the<br>
inventors of the present invention discovered that when a<br>
medicinal composition containing a reduced form of coenzyme<br>
Q10 was prepared and administered to patients by the oral<br>
route, a considerably higher bioavai.lability was surprisingly<br>
obtained as compared with the conventional medicinal<br>
composition containing only the oxidized coenzyme Q10. The<br>
present invention has been developed on the basis of the<br>
above finding.<br>
The present invention, therefore, is directed to a<br>
medicinal composition comprising coenzyme Q10 as an active<br>
ingredient with the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 accounting<br>
for more than 20 weight % of said coenzyme Q10. ACCOMPANYING <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE/DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a graphical representation of the relationship<br>
of plasma total coenzyme Q10 concentration with the time after<br>
administration; The ordinate represents the plasma total<br>
coenzyme Q10 concentration and the abscissa represents the<br>
time after administration. Each plot represents moan ?<br>
standard deviation (n=4).<br>
Fig. 2 is a graphical representation of the relationship<br>
of the total plasma coenzyme Q10 concentration at 3 hours<br>
after administration with the weight ratio of oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10 to reduced coenzyme Q10 in each sample. The<br>
ordinate represents the plasma total coenzyme Q10<br>
concentration and the abscissa represents the oxidized<br>
coenzyme Q10-reduced coenzyme Q10 ratio by weight. Each bar<br>
represents mean + standard deviation (n=4).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is now described in detail.<br>
It is known that a fairly high proportion, usually about<br>
40 to 90%, of coenzyme Q10 occurs in reduced form in the body.<br>
In vivo, the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 is readily<br>
transformed to the oxidized form, while the oxidized form of<br>
coenzyme Q10 is readily transformed into the reduced form.<br>
Therefore, coenzyme Q10 in vivo can be qenerally expressed by<br>
the following formula (1).<br>
Referring to the above formula (1), the general formula<br>
(1-A) represents the oxidized form of coenzyme Q10 and the<br>
general formula (1-B) represents the reduced form of coenzyme<br>
Q10<br>
In the conventional medicinal composition containing a<br>
coenzyme Q10 as an active ingredient, the sole active<br>
ingredient is the oxidized coenzyme Q10 of the above chemical<br>
formula (1-A). In contrast, the medicinal composition of the<br>
present invention comprises a reduced coenzyme Q10 of the<br>
above chemical formula (1-B) as an active ingredient coenzyme<br>
Q10. Consequently, as compared with the conventional<br>
medicinal composition containing only the oxidized form of<br>
coenzyme Q10 as an active ingredient, the medicinal<br>
composition of the present invention is improved in<br>
absorption after oral administration and insures a higher<br>
bioavailability.<br>
There is no particular limitation on the technology for<br>
providing said reduced form of coenzyme Q10 A typical<br>
method, which is by no means exclusive, comprises harvesting<br>
a coenzyine Q10 from a synthetic reaction mixture, a<br>
fermentation broth, or a natural source by procedures known in<br>
the art and subjecting it to chromatography to separate and<br>
concentrate the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 fraction. Where<br>
necessary, there can be followed the procedure of adding a<br>
conventional reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or<br>
sodium dithionite (sodium hydrosulfite) to the above coenzyme<br>
Q10 to reduce the oxidized coenzyme Q10 fraction of said<br>
coenzyme Q10 and, then, concentrate the reduced Q10 by<br>
chromatography. As a further alternative, the objective<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 can be obtained by permitting said<br>
reducing agent to act on the available high-purity coenzyme<br>
There is no particular limitation on the technology for<br>
manufacturing the medicinal composit ion of the invention. A<br>
typical but by no means exclusive method comprises dissolving<br>
the reduced coenzyme Ql0 thus obtained and a commercial<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 in a suitable common solvent such as<br>
isopropyl alcohol acelone or ether to provide a medicinal<br>
composition containing said reduced coenzyme Q10 in a desired<br>
proportion. As an alternative, the above-mentioned reduced<br>
and oxidized forms of coenzyme Q10 can be simply admixed in<br>
solid stage. It is also possible to directly use the mixture<br>
of oxidized and reduced forms of coenzyme Q10 obtained in the<br>
course of the above-mentioned production process for coenzyme<br>
Q10. Furthermore, the active ingredient for the medicinal<br>
composition of the invention can be directly obtained by<br>
controlling the time of reduction reaction of the high-purity<br>
coenzyme Ql0 already available and the type or amount of<br>
reducing agent to be used.<br>
In the medicinal composition of the present invention,<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10 accounts for more than 20 weight % of<br>
the total amount of coenzyme Q10. If its proportion is<br>
smaller than 20 weight. %, the bioavailability of the<br>
resulting medicinal composition will not be as high as<br>
expected. The preferred proportion is not smaller than<br>
40 weight % and the most preferred proportion is not smaller<br>
than 60 weight %. Conversely if the proportion of the reduced<br>
 form of coenzyme Q10 is too large, the production process will<br>
be complicated and the cost of production increased.<br>
Therefore, it is not necessary to increase the coenuyiue Q10<br>
content too much.<br>
The medicinal composition of the present invention can be<br>
used as, for example, a cardiotonic effective against<br>
symptoms in ischemic heart disease, senile myocardial<br>
sclerosis, hypertensive heart disease, etc. It can also be<br>
used as a nutrient, a nutritional supplement, or a veterinary<br>
medicine.<br>
There is no particular limitation on the dosage form for<br>
the medicinal composition of the present invention. It may<br>
for example be powders, granules containing a binder<br>
component, or compression-molded tablets. Such powders or<br>
granules may be filled in capsule shells to provide capsules.<br>
They may also be processed into soft capsules by adding a<br>
natural oil, an oily higher fatty acid, a higher fatty acid<br>
monoglyceride, or a mixture thereof and wrapping the<br>
medicated oil in soft capsule sheet materials. In this<br>
application, the capsule shell may be one predominantly<br>
composed of gelatin or any other water-soluble macromolocular<br>
substance. The capsule includes microcapsules.<br>
The medicinal composition of the present: invention may<br>
contain, in addition to said reduced coenzyme Ql0, a variety<br>
of pharmaceutically acceptable formulating substances as<br>
added in suitable amounts in the routine manner. There is no<br>
particular limitation on the kinds of such substances. Thus,<br>
an excipient, a disintegrator, a lubricant, a binder, an<br>
antioxidant, a coloring agent, an antiflocculant, an<br>
absorption promoter, a solubilizer for the active ingredient,<br>
a stabilizer, etc. can be added as necessary.<br>
The above-mentioned excipient includes but is not limited<br>
to sucrose, lactose, glucose, corn starch, mannitol,<br>
crystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate, and calcium sulfate.<br>
The disintegrator includes but is not limited to starch,<br>
agar, calcium citrate, calcium carbonat.fi, sodium hydrogen<br>
carbonate, dextrin, crystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl-<br>
cellulose, and gum tragacanth.<br>
The lubricant includes but is not limited to talc,<br>
magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, silica, and<br>
hydrogenated vegetable oil .<br>
The binder includes but is not limited to ethylcellulose,<br>
methylccllulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
gum tragacanth, shellac, gelatin, gum arable,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid,<br>
polymethaorylic acid, and sorbitol.<br>
The antioxidant includes but is not limited to ascorbic<br>
acid, tocophcrol, vitamin A, b -carotene, sodium<br>
hydrosulfite, sodium thiosulfate, sodium pyrolsulfite, and<br>
citric acid.<br>
There is no particular limitation on the coloring agent<br>
that can be used. For example, a variety of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable colors can be mentioned.<br>
The antiflocculant includes but is not limited to stearic<br>
acid, talc, light silicic anhydride, and hydrous silicon<br>
dioxide.<br>
The absorption promoter includes but is not limited to<br>
higher alcohols, higher fatty acids, and glycerin fatty acid<br>
esters and other surfactants.<br>
The above-mentioned solubilizer for the active ingredient<br>
includes but is not limited to organic acids such as furnaric<br>
acid, succinic acid, and malic acid.<br>
The stabilizer includes but is not limited to benzoic<br>
acid, sodium benzoate, and ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate.<br>
The dosage for the medicinal composition of the present<br>
invention should be selected according to whether the<br>
composition is used as a drug, a veterinary medicine, or a<br>
nutrient.<br>
For oral administration to domestic animals or fowls, the<br>
composition can be used as admixed into the feed or<br>
administered by a conventional forced manner.<br>
Because of the above constitution, the medicinal<br>
composition of the present invention is well absorbable after<br>
oral administration and shows a high level of bioavailability.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following examples and formulation examples are<br>
intended to illustrate the invention in further detail and<br>
should by no means be limitative of the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
(1) Preparation of samples<br>
Preparation of Samplc 1<br>
A 5:95 (w/w) mixture {0.3 g) of oxidized coenzyme Q10 and<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 was melted on a. water bath at 50°C and<br>
an olive oil was added to the melt to make 6.0 ml. This<br>
mixture was homogenized at 500c to provide an oily<br>
composition.<br>
Preparation of Comparative Sample 1<br>
Oxidized coenzyme Q10 (0.3 g) was melted on a water bath<br>
at 50°C and an olive oil was added to the melt to make<br>
6.0 ml. This mixture was homogenized at 50cC to provide an<br>
oily composition.<br>
(2) Oral absorption test<br>
Sample 1 and Comparative Sample 1 were used as tact<br>
samples. The tost was porfonnod using male Cij:CD (SD) rats<br>
(body weights 260 to 300 g). under well-fed conditions. As to<br>
dosage, each test sample was administered orally at the rate<br>
of 100 mg of total coenzyme Q10 per kg body weight. In the<br>
test, the total plasma coenzyme Q10 concentration was<br>
determined before administration (not administered) and<br>
serially after administration. Four rats were used per test<br>
sample for each time-point. The total coenzyme Q10 moans the<br>
sum of the mixture comprising the oxidized and reduced forms<br>
of coenzyme Q10. The total plasma coenzyme Q10 concentration<br>
was assayed as the concentration of oxidized coenzyme Q10 in<br>
the following manner. To 1.0 ml of the obtained plasma<br>
sample, 2.0 ml of water, 4.0 ml of ethanol, and 10.0 ml of<br>
n-hexane were added in the order mentioned. The mixture was<br>
shaken vigorously for about. 5 minutes and then centrifuged to<br>
separate into two layers. The organic layer was taken and<br>
the aqueous layer was further extracted with 10.0 ml of n-<br>
hexane twice in the same manner. The resulting organic layers<br>
and the organic layer previously taken were combined and<br>
evaporated to dryness. To the residuo was added 250 m 1 of<br>
ethanol:lN-hydrochloric acid (99:1, v/v) for use as an assay<br>
sample. The assay of coenzyme Q10 was carried out by high-<br>
performance liquid chromatography under the following<br>
conditions.<br>
Column: 250 mm long x 4.6 mm in diameter<br>
SYMMETRY C18 (Waters)<br>
Mobile phase: 0.5 M NaC1O, /C2H50H:CH ,OH:CH,CN:70%HC1O,<br>
(400:300:300:1, v:v)<br>
Detection wavelength: 27 5 nm<br>
Flow rate: 1 ml/min.<br>
The test results are presented in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the<br>
ordinate represents total plasma coenzyme Q10 concentration<br>
and the abscissa represents the time after administration.<br>
Each plot is mean ± standard deviation.<br>
It is apparent from Fig. 1 that whereas the plasma<br>
concentration peak appeared at. 3 hr after administration in<br>
the case of the composition containing only the oxidized form<br>
of coenzyme Q10, the peak appeared 1 hour earlier, i.e. at<br>
2 hours after administration, in the case of the composition<br>
comprising the reduced form of coenzyme Q10. Furthermore,<br>
the concentration level is also 2.1 times as high for the<br>
composition comprising the reduced form of coenzyme Q10. It<br>
is, thus, clear that compared with the composition containing<br>
only the oxidized form of coenzyme Q10, the medicinal<br>
composition of the present invention is absorbed faster and<br>
in a larger amount.<br>
Example 2<br>
(1) Preparation of samples<br>
Preparation of Sample 2<br>
Using a 20:80 (w/w) mixture of oxidized coenzyme Q10 and<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10, Test Sample 2 was prepared in the same<br>
manner as the preparation of Sample 1 in Example 1.<br>
Preparation of Sample 3<br>
Using a 40:60 (w/w) mixture of oxidized coenzyme Q10 and<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10, Test Sample 3 was prepared in the same<br>
manner as the preparation of Sample 1 in Example 1.<br>
Preparation of Sample 4<br>
Using a 60:40 (w/w) mixture of oxidized coenzyme Q10 and<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10, , Test Sample 4 was prepared in the same<br>
manner as the preparation of Sample 1 in Example 1.<br>
Preparation of Comparative Sample 2<br>
Using a 80:20 (w/w) mixture of oxidized coenzyme Q10, and<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10, Comparative Sample 2 was prepared in the<br>
same mariner as the preparation of Sample 1 in Example 1.<br>
(2) Oral absorption test<br>
Sample 1, Sample 2, Sample 3, Sample 4, Comparative<br>
Sample 1, and Comparative Sample 2 were Used as test samples.<br>
The test was performed in the same mariner as described in<br>
Example 1 except that the determination of total plasma<br>
coenzyme Q10 concentration was carried out at 3 hours after<br>
administration.<br>
The test results are presented in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, the<br>
ordinate represents the total plasma coenzyme Q10<br>
concentration at 3 hours after administration and the<br>
abscissa represents the weight ratio of oxidized coenzyme Q10<br>
to reduced coenzyme Q10 in the test sample. Rach bar<br>
represents mean = standard deviation.<br>
It is apparent from Fig. 2 that compared with the<br>
composition containing only the oxidized form of coenzyme Q10<br>
and the composition in which the reduced form of coenzyme Q10<br>
accounts for 20 weight % of total coenzyme Q10 administration<br>
of the compositions in which reduced coenzyme Q10 accounts for<br>
40 weight % or more of total coenzyme Ql0 resulted in higher<br>
plasma coenzyme Q10 concentrations. Moreover, with a weight<br>
ratio of contained reduced coenxyine Q10 increasing, the plasma<br>
coenzyme Q10 concentration was further increased. Those<br>
results indicate that because it contains 40 weight % or more<br>
of the reduced form of coenzyme Q10, the medicinal composition<br>
of the present invention is absorbed in a definitely larger<br>
amount than the composition containing only the oxidized form<br>
of coenzyme Q10 and the composition in which the reduced form<br>
of coenzyme Ql0 accounts for 20 weight % or,less of the total<br>
coenzyme Q10 content.<br>
Then, using a 15:85 (w/w) mixture of oxidized coenzyme<br>
Q10 and reduced coenzyme Q10 (hereinafter rpfprrpd to as main<br>
medicine) as an active ingredient, several, dosage forms were<br>
prepared by the conventional pharmaceutical procedures.<br>
Formulation Example 1 (powders)<br>
The main medicine was dissolved in acetone and the<br>
solution was adsorbed on microcrystalline cellulose, followed<br>
by drying. The product was mixed with corn starch to provide<br>
formulation Example 3 (capsules)<br>
The following components were granulated by the routine<br>
procedure and filled in hard gelatin capsule shells to<br>
provide capsules each containing 20 mg of the main medicine.<br>
Formulation Example 2 (tablets)<br>
The main medicine was dissolved in acetone and the<br>
solution was adsorbed on microcrystalline cellulose, followed<br>
by drying. The product was mixed with corn starch, lactose,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, and magnesium stearate and the<br>
mixture was granulated in the routine manner by adding an<br>
aqueous solution of poiyvinylpyrrolidone as a binder. To the<br>
granules thus obtained was added talc as a lubricant followed<br>
by mixing and the resulting composition was compressed into<br>
tablets each containing 20 mg of the main medicine.<br>
Formulation Example 4 (soft: capsules)<br>
Soybean oil was warmed to 600C and the main medicine<br>
melted at 60°C was added and dissolved. Then, vitamin E was<br>
added gradually to prepare a homogeneous mixture, which was<br>
then processed into soft capsules each containing 20 mg of<br>
the main medicine.<br>
Main medicine 20 Parts by weight<br>
Vitamin E 15 Parts by weight<br>
Soybean oil 350 Parts by weight<br>

[Title of the Invention] Medicinal Composition<br>
[Scope of the Claim for Patent]<br>
[Claim 1] A medicinal composition comprising coenzyme Q10<br>
as an active ingredient,<br>
wherin said coenzyme Q10 comprises reduced coenzyme Q10.<br>
[Claim 2] The medicinal composition according to Claim 1<br>
wherein said reduced coenzyme Q10 accounts for 20 weight % or<br>
more of the total coenzyme Q10 content.<br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a medicinal composition<br>
with improved absorption after oral administration which<br>
comprises a coenzyme Q10 of the following general formula (1-<br>
A) as an active ingredient.<br>
Coenzyme Q10 is a class of physiological substances<br>
occurring as component factors of the mitochondrial electron<br>
transfer system within the biological cell. Coenzyme Q10<br>
acts directly as an electron carrier in the oxidative<br>
phosphorylation reactions, through metabolic pathways,<br>
particularly aerobic pathways, to produce ATP and hence energy.<br>
It seems that the demand for coenzyme Q10 is increased in<br>
normal subjects in the state of severe physical fatigue and<br>
patients with cardiovascular disease, chronic debilitating<br>
disease, or on prolonged pharmacotherapy. It has been shown<br>
that a deficiency of coenzyme Q10 occurs particularly in<br>
ischemic heart diseases, senile myocardial sclerosis, and<br>
hypertensive heart diseases. Therefore, it is a sound<br>
therapeutic choice to administer coenzyme Q10 to those<br>
patients.<br>
Moreover, coenzyme Q10 has been used for non-therapeutic<br>
purposes as a nutrient or nutritional supplement just like<br>
vitamins.<br><br>
In order that coenzyme Q10 may express its therapeutic<br>
efficacy or nutritional effect, it is most important to<br>
increase the coenzyme Q10 level within the patient"s tissue<br>
cells.<br>
Coenzyme Q10 is a lipid-soluble and practically water-<br>
insoluble substance and, therefore, it is only sparingly<br>
soluble in gastric juice. Consequently, oral dosage forms<br>
containing coenzyme Q10 in solid state, such as tablets,<br>
granules, capsules, and suspensions for extemporaneous<br>
preparation, are not well absorbed after oral administration.<br>
This means that a considerably greater amount of coenzyme Q10<br>
than actually needed must be administered to the patient but<br>
such a practice tends to cause adverse gastrointestinal<br>
reactions such as epigastric discomfort, anorexia, nausea,<br>
and diarrheas.<br><br>
Much research has heretofore been undertaken for<br>
overcoming those disadvantages. Japanese Kokai Publications<br>
Sho-55-81813 and Sho-61-221131, among others, disclose<br>
coenzyme Q10 formulations of the solution type or the<br>
emulsion/dispersion type. However, such pharmaceutical<br>
devices are not sufficient to improve the absorption of<br>
coenzyme Q10 in a satisfactory measure.<br>
[0007]<br>
Japanese Kokai Publication Sho-56-18914 discloses a<br>
technology for accelerating the lymphatic absorption of<br>
coenzyme Q10. This technology has been demonstrated to<br>
increase the absorption of coenzyme Q10 in a certain measure<br>
but has not proved practically useful as yet.<br>
[0008]<br>
Japanese Kokai Publication Sho-60-89442 discloses a<br>
cyclodextrin-clathrated coenzyme Q10 formulation. Japanese<br>
Kokai Publication Sho-60-1124 discloses a coenzyme Q10-<br>
containing ribosomal formulation. However, those coenzyme Q10<br>
preparations require a complicated pharmaceutical procedure<br>
for production and are not practically fully satisfactory.<br>
[0009]<br>
Italian Patent 1190442 Specification discloses a<br>
technology which, instead of using coenzyme Q10 as such,<br>
comprises converting a reduced form of coenzyme Q10 to a<br>
derivative such as an acyl ester, a sulfuric acid ester, or a<br>
phosphoric acid ester and administering this coenzyme Q10<br>
derivative for enhanced absorption. However, the effect of<br>
the technology has not been supported by experimental data.<br><br>
[Problems which the Invention is to Solve]<br>
The present invention has for its object to provide a<br>
medicinal composition comprising coenzyme Q10 as an active<br>
ingredient, which composition features an enhanced absorption<br>
after oral administration.<br><br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In the course of their intensive research for overcoming<br>
the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art, the<br>
inventors of the present invention discovered that when a<br>
medicinal composition containing a reduced form of coenzyme<br>
Q10 was prepared and administered to patients by the oral<br>
route, a considerably higher bioavailability was surprisingly<br>
obtained as compared with the conventional medicinal<br>
composition containing only the oxidized coenzyme Q10. The<br>
present invention has been developed on the basis of the<br>
above finding.<br>
The present invention, therefore, is directed to a<br>
medicinal composition comprising coenzyme Q10 as an active<br>
ingredient with said coenzyme Q10 comprising the reduced form<br>
of coenzyme Q10.<br>
The present invention is now described in detail.<br><br>
It is known that a fairly high proportion, usually about<br>
40 to 90%, of coenzyme Q10 occurs in reduced form in the body.<br>
In vivo, the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 is readily<br>
transformed to the oxidized form, while the oxidized form of<br>
coenzyme Q10 is readily transformed into the reduced form.<br>
Therefore, coenzyme Q10 in vivo can be generally expressed by<br>
the following formula (1).<br>
Referring to the above formula (1), the general formula<br>
(1-A) represents the oxidized form of coenzyme Q10 and the<br>
general formula (1-B) represents the reduced form of coenzyme<br>
Q10.<br>
In the conventional medicinal composition containing a<br>
coenzyme Q10 as an active ingredient, the sole active<br>
ingredient is the oxidized coenzyme Q10 of the above chemical<br>
formula (1-A). In contrast, the medicinal composition of the<br>
present invention comprises a reduced coenzyme Q10 of the<br>
above chemical formula (1-B) as an active ingredient coenzyme<br>
Q10. Consequently, as compared with the conventional<br>
medicinal composition containing only the oxidized form of<br>
coenzyme Q10 as an active ingredient, the medicinal<br>
composition of the present invention is improved in<br>
absorption after oral administration and insures a higher<br>
bioavailability.<br><br>
There is no particular limitation on the technology for<br>
providing said reduced form of coenzyme Q10. A typical<br>
method, which is by no means exclusive, comprises harvesting<br>
a coenzyme Q10 from a synthetic reaction mixture, a<br>
fermentation broth, or a natural source by procedures known in<br>
the art and subjecting it to chromatography to separate and<br>
concentrate the reduced form of coenzyme Q10 fraction. Where<br>
necessary, there can be followed the procedure of adding a<br>
conventional reducing agent such as sodium borohydride or<br>
sodium dithionite (sodium hydrosulfite) to the above coenzyme<br>
Q10 to reduce the oxidized coenzyme Q10 fraction of said<br>
coenzyme Q10 and, then, concentrate the reduced Q10 by<br>
chromatography. As a further alternative, the objective<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 can be obtained by permitting said<br>
reducing agent to act on the available high-purity coenzyme<br>
Q10.<br><br>
There is no particular limitation on the technology for<br>
manufacturing the medicinal composition of the invention. A<br>
typical but by no means exclusive method comprises dissolving<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10 thus obtained and a commercial<br>
oxidized coenzyme Q10 in a suitable common solvent such as<br>
isopropyl alcohol, acetone, or ether to provide a medicinal<br>
composition containing said reduced coenzyme Q10 in a desired<br>
proportion. As an alternative, the above-mentioned reduced<br>
and oxidized forms of coenzyme Q10 can be simply admixed in<br>
solid stage. It is also possible to directly use the mixture<br>
of oxidized and reduced forms of coenzyme Q10 obtained in the<br>
course of the above-mentioned production process for coenzyme<br>
Q10. Furthermore, the active ingredient for the medicinal<br>
composition of the invention can be directly obtained by<br>
controlling the time of reduction reaction of the high-purity<br>
coenzyme Q10 already available and the type or amount of<br>
reducing agent to be used.<br><br>
In the medicinal composition of the present invention,<br>
the reduced coenzyme Q10 preferably accounts for more than 20<br>
weight % of the total amount of coenzyme Q10. If its<br>
proportion is smaller than 20 weight %, the bioavailability of<br>
the resulting medicinal composition will not be insufficient.<br>
The more preferred proportion is not smaller than 40 weight<br>
% and the most preferred proportion is not smaller than 60<br>
weight %. Conversely if the proportion of the reduced<br>
form of coenzyme Q10 is too large, the production process will<br>
be complicated and the cost of production increased.<br>
Therefore, it is not necessary to increase the coenzyme Q10<br>
content too much.<br><br>
The medicinal composition of the present invention can be<br>
used as, for example, a cardiotonic effective against<br>
symptoms in ischemic heart disease, senile myocardial<br>
sclerosis, hypertensive heart disease, etc. It can also be<br>
used as a nutrient, a nutritional supplement, or a veterinary<br>
medicine.<br><br>
There is no particular limitation on the dosage form for<br>
the medicinal composition of the present invention. It may<br>
for example be powders, granules containing a binder component,<br>
or compression-molded tablets. Such powders or granules may<br>
be filled in capsule shells to provide capsules. They may<br>
also be processed into soft capsules by adding a natural oil,<br>
an oily higher fatty acid, a higher fatty acid monoglyceride,<br>
or a mixture thereof and wrapping the medicated oil in soft<br>
capsule sheet materials. In this application, the capsule<br>
shell may be one predominantly composed of gelatin or any<br>
other water-soluble macromolecular substance. The capsule<br>
includes microcapsules.<br>
[0020]<br>
The medicinal composition of the present invention may<br>
contain, in addition to said reduced coenzyme Q10, a variety<br>
of pharmaceutically acceptable formulating substances as<br>
added in suitable amounts in the routine manner. There is no<br>
particular limitation on the kinds of such substances. Thus,<br>
an excipient, a disintegrator, a lubricant, a binder, an<br>
antioxidant, a coloring agent, an antiflocculant, an<br>
absorption promoter, a solubilizer for the active ingredient,<br>
a stabilizer, etc. can be added as necessary.<br><br>
The above-mentioned excipient includes but is not limited<br>
to sucrose, lactose, glucose, corn starch, mannitol,<br>
crystalline cellulose, calcium phosphate, and calcium sulfate.<br>
The disintegrator includes but is not limited to starch,<br>
agar, calcium citrate, calcium carbonate, sodium hydrogen<br>
carbonate, dextrin, crystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl-<br>
cellulose, and gum tragacanth.<br>
The lubricant includes but is not limited to talc,<br>
magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, silica, and<br>
hydrogenated vegetable oil.<br><br>
The binder includes but is not limited to ethylcellulose,<br>
methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyIcellulose,<br>
gum tragacanth, shellac, gelatin, gum arabic,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid,<br>
polymethacrylic acid, and sorbitol.<br>
The antioxidant includes but is not limited to ascorbic<br>
acid, tocopherol, potassium hydrogenphosphate, vitamin A, b<br>
-carotene, sodium hydrosulfite, sodium thiosulfate, sodium<br>
pyrolsulfite, sodium D-sorbitolbenzoate, citric acid, sodium<br>
citrate, magnesium silicate, sodium hydrogencarbonate and<br>
propylene glycol.<br><br>
There is no particular limitation on the coloring agent<br>
that can be used. For example, a variety of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable colors can be mentioned.<br>
The antiflocculant includes but is not limited to stearic<br>
acid, talc, light silicic anhydride, and hydrous silicon<br>
dioxide.<br>
The absorption promoter includes but is not limited to<br>
higher alcohols, higher fatty acids, and glycerin fatty acid<br>
esters and other surfactants.<br>
The above-mentioned solubilizer for the active ingredient<br>
includes but is not limited to organic acids such as fumaric<br>
acid, succinic acid, and malic acid.<br>
The stabilizer includes but is not limited to benzoic<br>
acid, sodium benzoate, and ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate.<br><br>
The dosage for the medicinal composition of the present<br>
invention should be selected according to whether the<br>
composition is used as a drug, a veterinary medicine, or a<br>
nutrient.<br>
For oral administration to domestic animals or fowls, the<br>
composition can be used as admixed into the feed or<br>
administered by a conventional forced manner.<br><br>
[Example]<br>
The following examples and formulation examples are<br>
intended to illustrate the invention in further detail and<br>
should by no means be limitative of the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
(1) Preparation of samples<br>
Preparation of Sample 1<br>
A 5:95 (w/w) mixture (0.3 g) of oxidized coenzyme Q10 and<br>
reduced coenzyme Q10 was melted on a water bath at 500C and<br>
an olive oil was added to the melt to make 6.0 ml. This<br>
mixture was homogenized at 50°C to provide an oily<br>
composition.<br><br>
Preparation of Comparative Sample 1<br>
Oxidized coenzyme Q10 (0.3 g) was melted on a water bath<br>
at 50°C and an olive oil was added to the melt to make<br>
6.0 ml. This mixture was homogenized at 50°C to provide an<br>
oily composition.<br><br>
(2) Oral absorption test<br>
Sample 1 and Comparative Sample 1 were used as test<br>
samples. The test was performed using male Crj:CD (SD) rats<br>
(body weights 260 to 300 g) under well-fed conditions. As to<br>
dosage, each test sample was administered orally at the rate<br>
of 100 mg of total coenzyme Q10 per kg body weight. In the<br>
test, the total plasma coenzyme Q10 concentration was<br>
determined before administration (not administered) and<br>
serially after administration. Four rats were used per test<br>
sample for each time-point. The total coenzyme Q10 means the<br>
sum of the mixture comprising the oxidized and reduced forms<br>
of coenzyme Q10. The total plasma coenzyme Q10 concentration<br>
was assayed as the concentration of oxidized coenzyme Q10 in<br>
the following manner. To 1.0 ml of the obtained plasma sample,<br>
2.0 ml of water, 4.0 ml of ethanol, and 10.0 ml of<br>
n-hexane were added in the order mentioned. The mixture was<br>
shaken vigorously for about 5 minutes and then centrifuged to<br>
separate into two layers. The organic layer was taken and<br>
the aqueous layer was further extracted with 10.0 ml of n-<br>
hexane twice in the same manner. The resulting organic layers<br>
and the organic layer previously taken were combined and<br>
evaporated to dryness. To the residue was added 250 m 1 of<br>
ethanol:lN-hydrochloric acid (99:1, v/v) for use as an assay<br>
sample. The assay of coenzyme Q10 was carried out by high-<br>
performance liquid chromatography under the following<br>
conditions.<br>
The test results are presented in Fig. 1. in Fig. 1, the<br>
ordinate represents total plasma coenzyme Q10 concentration<br>
and the abscissa represents the time after administration.<br>
It is apparent from Fig. 1 that whereas the plasma<br>
concentration peak appeared at 3 hr after administration in<br>
the case of the composition containing only the oxidized form<br>
of coenzyme Q10, the peak appeared 1 hour earlier, i.e. at<br>
2 hours after administration, in the case of the composition<br>
comprising the reduced form of coenzyme Q10. Furthermore,<br>
the concentration level is also 2.1 times as high for the<br>
composition comprising the reduced form of coenzyme Q10. It<br>
is, thus, clear that compared with the composition containing<br>
only the oxidized form of coenzyme Q10, the medicinal<br>
composition of the present invention is absorbed faster and<br>
in a larger amount.<br><br>
Then, using a 15:85 (w/w) mixture of oxidized coenzyme<br>
Q10 and reduced coenzyme Q10 (hereinafter referred to as main<br>
medicine) as an active ingredient, several dosage forms were<br>
prepared by the conventional pharmaceutical procedures.<br>
Formulation Example 1 (powders)<br>
The main medicine was dissolved in acetone and the<br>
solution was adsorbed on microcrystalline cellulose, followed<br>
by drying. The product was mixed with corn starch to provide<br>
powders in the routine manner.<br>
Main medicine 10 Parts by weight<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose 40 Parts by weight<br>
Corn starch 55 Parts by weight<br>
[0033]<br>
Formulation Example 2 (tablets)<br>
The main medicine was dissolved in acetone and the<br>
solution was adsorbed on microcrystalline cellulose, followed<br>
by drying. The product was mixed with corn starch, lactose,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, and magnesium stearate and the<br>
mixture was granulated in the routine manner by adding an<br>
aqueous solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone as a binder. To the<br>
granules thus obtained was added talc as a lubricant followed<br>
by mixing and the resulting composition was compressed into<br>
tablets each containing 20 mg of the main medicine.<br>
Main medicine 20 Parts by weight<br>
Corn starch 25 Parts by weight<br>

Carboxymethylcellulose calcium 10 Parts by weight<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose 40 Parts by weight<br>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone 5 Parts by weight<br>
Magnesium stearate 3 Parts by weight<br>
Talc 10 Parts by weight<br>
[0034]<br>
Formulation Example 3 (capsules)<br>
The following components were granulated by the routine<br>
procedure and filled in hard gelatin capsule shells to<br>
provide capsules each containing 20 mg of the main medicine.<br>
Main medicine 20 Parts by weight<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose 40 Parts by weight<br>
Corn starch 20 Parts by weight<br>
Lactose 62 Parts by weight<br>
Magnesium stearate 2 Parts by weight<br>

[0035]<br>
Formulation Example 4 (soft capsules)<br>
Soybean oil was warmed to 60°C and the main medicine<br>
melted at 60°C was added and dissolved. Then, vitamin E was<br>
added gradually to prepare a homogeneous mixture, which was<br>
then processed into soft capsules each containing 20 mg of<br>
the main medicine.<br>
Main medicine 20 Parts by weight<br>
Vitamin E 15 Parts by weight<br>
Soybean oil 350 Parts by weight<br>
[0036]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
Because of the above constitution, the medicinal<br>
composition of the present invention is well absorbable after<br>
oral administration and shows a high level of bioavailability.<br>
[BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS]<br>
