				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
[001] The present invention generally relates to a minimally invasive method for<br>
administering focused energy such as adaptive microwave phased array hyperthermia<br>
for treating ductal and glandular carcinomas and intraductal hyperplasia as well as<br>
benign lesions such as fibroadenomas and cysts in compressed breast tissue. In<br>
addition, the method according to the invention may be used to treat healthy tissue<br>
containing undetected microscopic pathologically altered cells of high-water content<br>
to prevent the occurrence of or the recurrence of cancerous, pre-cancerous or benign<br>
breast lesions.<br>
[002] In order to treat primary breast cancer with hyperthermia, it is necessary to<br>
heat large volumes of tissue such as a quadrant or more of the breast. It is well<br>
known that approximately 90% of all breast cancers originate within the lactiferous<br>
ductal tissues (milk ducts) with much of the remaining cancers originating in the<br>
glandular tissue lobules (milk sacks) (Harris et al., The New England Journal of<br>
Medicine, Vol. 327, pp. 390-398, 1992). Breast carcinomas often involve large<br>
regions of the breast for which current conservative treatments have a significant risk<br>
of local failure. Schnitt et al., Cancer, Vol. 74 (6) pp. 1746-1751, 1994. With early-<br>
stage breast cancer, known as Tl (0-2 cm) or T2 (2-5 cm) cancers, the entire breast is<br>
at risk and often is treated with breast-conserving surgery combined with full-breast<br>
irradiation to destroy any possible microscopic (not visible to the human eye without<br>
the aid of a microscope or mammography) cancer cells in the breast tissue<br>
(Winchester et al., CA-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, Vol. 42, No. 3, pp. 134-162,<br>
1992). The successful treatment of invasive ductal carcinomas with an extensive<br>
intraductal component (EIC) where the carcinomas have spread throughout the ducts<br>
is particularly difficult, since large portions of the breast must be treated. Over<br>
800,000 breast needle biopsies of suspicious lesions are performed annually in the<br>
United States with approximately 180,000 cases of cancer detected, the rest being<br>
nonmalignant such as fibroadenomas and cysts.<br>
[003] The use of heat to treat breast carcinomas can be effective in a number of<br>
ways, and in most cases the heat treatment must be capable of reaching,<br><br>
simultaneously, widely separated areas within the breast. Heating large volumes of<br>
the breast can destroy many or all of the microscopic carcinoma cells in the breast,<br>
and reduce or prevent the recurrence of cancer - the same approach is used in<br>
radiation therapy where the entire breast is irradiated with x-rays to kill all the<br>
microscopic cancer cells. Heating the tumor and killing a large percentage or all of<br>
the tumor cells prior to lumpectomy may reduce the possibility of inadvertently<br>
seeding viable cancer cells during the lumpectomy procedure, thus reducing local<br>
recurrences of the breast. Sometimes, the affected breast contains two or more tumor<br>
masses distributed within the breast, known as multi-focal cancer, and again the<br>
heating field must reach widely separated regions of the breast. Locally advanced<br>
breast carcinomas (known as T3) (Smart et al., A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, Vol.<br>
47, pp. 134-139, 1997) can be 5 cm or more in size and are often treated with<br>
mastectomy. Pre-operative hyperthermia treatment of locally advanced breast cancer<br>
may shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow a surgical lumpectomy procedure to be<br>
performed - similar to the way pre-operative chemotherapy is currently used. Pre-<br>
operative hyperthermia treatment of locally advanced breast cancer may destroy the<br>
tumor completely, eliminating the need of any surgery.<br>
[004] It is well known that microwave energy can preferentially heat high-water<br>
content tissues such as breast tumors and cysts, compared to the heating that occurs in<br>
low-water content tissue such as fatty breast tissue. Many clinical studies have<br>
established that hyperthermia (elevated temperature) induced by electromagnetic<br>
energy absorption in the microwave band, significantly enhances the effect of<br>
radiation therapy in the treatment of malignant tumors in the human body (Valdagni,<br>
et al., International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Vol. 28, pp. 163-<br>
169,1993; Overgaard et al., International Journal of Hyperthermia, Vol. 12, No. 1,<br>
pp. 3-20, 1996; Vemon et al., International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology<br>
Physics, Vol. 35, pp. 731-744, 1996; van der Zee et al, Proceedings of the 7th<br>
International Congress on Hyperthermic Oncology, Rome, Italy, April 9-13, Vol. II,<br>
pp. 215-217,1996; Falk and Issels, Hyperthermia in Oncology, International Journal<br>
of Hyperthermia, Vol. 17, No. 1, 2001, pp. 1-18.). Radio-resistant cells such as S-<br>
phase cells can be killed directly by elevated temperature (Hall, Radiobiology for the<br>
Radiologist, 4th Edition, JB Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, pp. 262-263, 1994;<br><br>
Perez and Brady, Principles and Practice of Radiation Oncology, Second Edition, JB<br>
Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, pp. 396-397, 1994). Hyperthermia treatments<br>
with microwave radiating devices are usually administered in several treatment<br>
sessions, in which the malignant tumor is heated to about 43° C for about 60 minutes.<br>
It is known that the amount of time to kill tumor cells decreases by a factor of two<br>
for each degree increase in temperature above about 43° C (Sapareto, et al.,<br>
International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Vol. 10, pp. 787-800,<br>
1984). Thus, a 60-minute treatment at 43° C can be reduced to only about 15 minutes<br>
at 45° C, which is often referred to as an equivalent dose (t430c equivalent minutes). It<br>
has also been clinically established that thermotherapy enhances the effect of<br>
chemotherapy (Falk and Issels, 2001). During treatments with noninvasive<br>
microwave applicators, it has proven difficult to heat semi-deep tumors adequately<br>
while preventing surrounding superficial healthy tissues from incurring pain or<br>
damage due to undesired hot spots. The specific absorption rate (SAR) in tissue is a<br>
common parameter used to characterize the heating of tissue. The SAR is<br>
proportional to the rise in temperature over a given time interval, and for microwave<br>
energy the SAR is also proportional to the electric field squared times the tissue<br>
electrical conductivity. The units of absolute SAR are watts per kilogram.<br>
[005] Non-coherent-array or non-adaptive phased array hyperthermia treatment<br>
systems typically can heat superficial tumors, but are restricted in their use for heating<br>
deep tumors or deep tissue, because they tend to overheat intervening superficial<br>
tissues, which can cause pain and/or burning. The first published report describing a<br>
non-adaptive phased array for deep tissue hyperthermia was a theoretical study (von<br>
Hippel, et al., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Insulation<br>
Research, Technical Report 13, AD-769 843, pp. 16-19, 1973). U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,895,639 to Rodler describes two-channel and four-channel non-adaptive phased<br>
array hyperthermia circuits. Recent developments in hyperthermia systems<br>
effectively targets the delivery of heat to deep tissue using adaptive phased array<br>
technology originally developed for microwave radar systems (Skolnik, Introduction<br>
to Radar Systems, Second Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1980 pp. 332-333;<br>
Compton, Adaptive Antennas, Concepts and Performance, Prentice Hall, New Jersey,<br>
p. 1 1988; Fenn, IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, Vol. 38, number 2,<br><br>
pp. 173-185,1990; U.S. Patents Nos. 5,251,645; 5,441,532; 5,540,737; 5,810,888).<br>
[006] Bassen et al., Radio Science, Vol. 12, No. 6(5), Nov-Dec 1977, pp. 15-25,<br>
shows that an electric-field probe can be used to measure the electric-field pattern in<br>
tissue, and in particular, shows several examples in which the measured electric-field<br>
has a focal peak in the central tissue. This paper also discusses a concept for real-<br>
time measurements of the electric-field in living specimens. However, Bassen et al.<br>
did not develop the concept of measuring an electric-field using real-time with an<br>
electric-probe to adaptively focus a phased array.<br>
[007] An adaptive phased array hyperthermia system uses E-field feedback<br>
measurements to focus its microwave energy on deep tissue while simultaneously<br>
nullifying any energy that might overheat surrounding healthy body tissue. Pre-<br>
clinical studies indicate that adaptive microwave phased arrays have the potential for<br>
delivering deep heat while sparing superficial tissues from excessive temperatures in<br>
deep torso (Fenn, et al., International Journal of Hyperthermia, Vol. 10, No. 2, March-<br>
April, pp. 189-208,1994; Fenn et al., The Journal of Oncology Management, Vol. 7,<br>
number 2, pp. 22-29, 1998) and in breast (Fenn, Proceedings of the Surgical<br>
Applications of Energy Sources Conference, 1996; Fenn et al., International Journal<br>
of Hyperthermia, Vol. 15, No. 1, pp. 45-61, 1999; Gavrilov et al., International<br>
Journal of Hyperthermia, Vol. 15, No. 6, pp. 495-507, 1999).<br>
[008] The most difficult aspect of implementing hyperthermia in deep breast tissues,<br>
with microwave energy, is producing sufficient heating at a predetermined depth<br>
while protecting the skin from burns. Noninvasive multiple applicator adaptive<br>
microwave phased arrays with invasive and noninvasive electric field probes can be<br>
used for producing an adaptively focused beam at the tumor position with adaptive<br>
nulls formed in healthy tissues as described in U.S. Pat Nos. 5,251,645, 5,441,532,<br>
5,540,737, and 5,810,888, all ofwhich are incorporated herein by reference. Ideally,<br>
a focused microwave radiation beam is concentrated at the tumor with minimal<br>
energy delivered to surrounding healthy tissue. To control the microwave power<br>
during treatment, a temperature-sensing feedback probe (Samaras et al., Proceedings<br>
of the 2nd International Symposium, Essen, Germany, June 2-4, 1977, Urban &amp;<br>
Schwarzenberg, Baltimore, 1978, pp. 131 -133) is inserted into the tumor, however, it<br><br>
is often difficult to accurately place the probe in the tumor. An additional difficulty<br>
occurs in delivering hyperthermia to carcinoma spread throughout the ductal or<br>
glandular tissues of the breast, because of a lack of a well defined target position for<br>
the temperature-sensing feedback probe. In other situations, it is desirable simply to<br>
avoid inserting probes (either temperature or E-field) into the breast tissue in order to<br>
reduce the risk of infection or spreading the cancer cells when the probe passes<br>
through the rumor region.<br>
[009] The standard of medical care for treating benign cysts that have been detected<br>
varies from doing nothing to draining the cysts. The medically accepted position of<br>
not treating the cysts exists because the only known method of removing cysts<br>
involves invasive surgery. The alternative to surgically cutting and removing a cyst is<br>
draining the cyst. Draining the cyst is achieved by piercing the cyst and removing the<br>
liquid inside the cyst. While this method may temporarily relieve the pain associated<br>
with the cyst, the cyst may grow back if the draining procedure failed to remove the<br>
entire cyst. Therefore, there is a need for a non-invasive removal of these benign<br>
cysts.<br>
[010] The above shortcomings are solved by the Assignee of the instant invention's<br>
method for heating cancerous conditions of the breast which comprises the steps of<br>
inserting an E-field probe sensor in the breast, monitoring temperatures of the skin<br>
surface, orienting two microwave applicators on opposite sides of the breast, setting<br>
the initial microwave power and phase delivered to each microwave applicator in<br>
order to focus the field at the inserted E-field sensor, adjusting the microwave power<br>
to be delivered to the breast based on the monitored skin temperatures, and<br>
monitoring the microwave energy dose delivered to the breast being treated and<br>
completing the treatment when a desired total microwave energy dose has been<br>
delivered by the microwave applicators.<br>
[011] Moreover, the above method by the Assignee of the instant invention has<br>
application in situations such as when there is no well-defined position to place the<br>
temperature feedback sensor, or when it is desirable to avoid inserting a temperature<br>
probe into the breast tissue. Only a single minimally invasive E-field sensor is<br>
required in the preferred method taught by the Assignee. Thus, in the case of<br>
advanced breast cancer (e.g., a tumor 5-8 cm), this method can destroy a significant<br><br>
portion of the breast cancer cells and shrink the tumor or lesion (i.e., thermal<br>
downsizing to e.g., 2 - 3 cm) thereby replacing a surgical mastectomy with a surgical<br>
lumpectomy. In the alternative, the entire advanced breast cancer lesion can be<br>
destroyed and no surgery may be required. In early-stage breast cancer or for small<br>
breast lesions, the Assignee's method may destroy all of the breast cancer cells or<br>
benign lesions with heat (i.e., a thermal lumpectomy) thereby avoiding a surgical<br>
lumpectomy. In addition, the method can be used to enhance radiation therapy or for<br>
targeted drug delivery with thermosensitive liposomes as described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,810,888 and/or targeted gene therapy delivery. The assignee's method maybe used<br>
with a recently developed temperature sensitive liposome formulation with<br>
chemotherapy agents such as doxorubicin as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,200,598<br>
"Temperature Sensitive Liposomal Formulation," March 13, 2001 to Needham, in<br>
which drug agents are released at temperatures of approximately 39 to 45 degrees<br>
Celsius.<br>
[012] The assignee's method described above destroys the cancerous cells while<br>
sparing the normal glandular, ductal, connective, and fatty tissue of the breast. Thus,<br>
a thermal lumpectomy according to the invention avoids damage to such healthy<br>
tissue and is a breast conservation technique.<br>
[013] While the Assignee's method may be achieved employing the adaptive<br>
microwave phased array technology, focussing energy, in general, may be used to<br>
heat and ablate an area of tissue. The focused energy may include electromagnetic<br>
waves, ultrasound waves or waves at radio frequency. That is, any energy that can be<br>
focused to heat and ablate an area of tissue.<br>
[014] While the Assignee's method described above non-invasively removes cysts<br>
from breast tissue, other problems arise due to the externally focused microwaves and<br>
the mechanical pressure employed to compress the breast tissue. Thus, improvements<br>
in safety of such a non-invasive thermotherapy cancer treatment are needed.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[015] Applicants overcome shortcomings in the prior art with their inventive<br>
method for treating cancerous or benign conditions of an organ by selective<br>
irradiation of the organ tissue with focused energy. The method according to the<br><br>
invention may include the steps of inserting an E-field probe sensor to an appropriate<br>
depth in the organ tissue, monitoring temperatures of the skin surface adjacent the<br>
organ, positioning two or more energy applicators around the organ, setting the initial'<br>
power level delivered to each energy applicator, setting the initial relative phase<br>
delivered to each energy applicator to focus the energy at the E-field probe positioned<br>
in the organ tissue, delivering energy to the two or more energy applicators to<br>
selectively irradiate the organ tissue with focused energy and treat at least one of<br>
cancerous and benign conditions of the organ, adjusting the level of power to be<br>
delivered to each energy applicator during treatment based on the monitored skin<br>
temperatures, monitoring the energy delivered to the energy applicators, determining<br>
total energy delivered to the energy applicators and displaying the total energy in real<br>
time during the treatment, and completing the treatment when the desired total energy<br>
dose has been delivered by the energy applicators to the organ. The preferred organ to<br>
be treated is the breast and in a preferred method the energy applicators may be<br>
positioned in a ring about the breast (or other organ).<br>
[016] According to the invention, a preferred method for treating cancerous or<br>
benign conditions of an organ by selective irradiation of the organ tissue with energy<br>
may include the steps of injecting a substance that enhances heating to an appropriate<br>
depth in the organ tissue, monitoring temperatures of the skin surface adjacent the<br>
organ, positioning at least one energy applicator about the organ, setting the initial<br>
power level delivered to each at least one energy applicator, delivering energy to the<br>
at least one energy applicator to selectively irradiate the organ tissue with energy and<br>
treat at least one of cancerous and benign conditions of the organ, adjusting the level<br>
of power to be delivered to each at least one energy applicator during treatment based<br>
on the monitored skin temperatures, monitoring the energy delivered to the at least<br>
one energy applicator, determining total energy delivered to the at least one energy<br>
applicator and displaying the total energy in real time during the treatment, and<br>
completing the treatment when the desired total energy dose has been delivered by the<br>
at least one energy applicator to the organ. That is, Applicants envision that the method<br>
according to the invention may be achieved with a single applicator and may be any<br>
energy that can be focussed on the cancerous or benign conditions of the organ.<br>
[017] In accordance with the invention, microwave absorbing pads and metallic<br><br>
shielding are attached to microwave thermotherapy applicators and to the breast<br>
compression paddles. These safety precautions added to the Assignee's method<br>
reduce the electric-field intensity and temperature outside the primary microwave<br>
applicator aperture field in the vicinity of the base of the breast, chest wall region, and<br>
head and eyes during adaptive phased array thermotherapy in compressed breast<br>
tissue for breast tumor (malignant or benign) treatment.<br>
[018] In order to minimize the amount of invasive skin entry points, combined E-<br>
field and temperature sensors within a single catheter are used with the Assignee's<br>
method. As a result, only a single minimally invasive skin entry point is required<br>
resulting in improved patient comfort and reducing the risk of infection.<br>
[019] Additionally, adaptive microwave phased array thermotherapy can be used as<br>
a heat-alone treatment for early-stage breast cancer. Or adaptive microwave phased<br>
array thermotherapy can be used in combination with a chemotherapy regimen and/or<br>
gene based modifiers for treatment of the primary breast tumor in locally advanced<br>
breast cancer. Alternatively, the breast thermotherapy heat-alone treatment can be<br>
used as a pre-surgical tool to reduce the rate of second or third incisions (additional<br>
surgery) for lumpectomy patients. An additional use of adaptive microwave<br>
thermotherapy can be in improved breast cancer prevention in which thermotherapy is<br>
used with Tamoxifen or other antiestrogen drug for blocking estrogen from binding to<br>
the estrogen receptors of breast carcinomas and for direct cancer cell kill by heat.<br>
[020] Further objectives and advantages will become apparent from a consideration<br>
of the description and drawings.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Dielectric Properties of Breast Tissue<br>
[022] A detailed lateral view of the female breast is shown in Figure 1<br>
(Mammography - A User's Guide, National Council on Radiation Protection and<br>
Measurements, NCRP Report No. 85,1 August 1987, p.6). The amount of glandular<br>
and fatty tissue within the breast can vary widely, from primarily fatty tissue to<br>
extremely dense glandular tissue. Breast cancer cells, which are high-water content<br>
cells, usually form within the lactiferous ducts and glandular tissue lobules as<br>
depicted in Figure 2 (adapted from Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, Addison Wesley,<br>
Mass., 1990, pp. 191-196). The first indication of abnormal cell growth within the<br>
duct is referred to as intraductal hyperplasia, followed by intraductal hyperplasia with<br>
atipia. When the ducts become nearly full, the condition is known as intraductal<br>
carcinoma in situ (DCIS). These three conditions are referred to as pre-cancers.<br>
Finally, when the ductal carcinomas break through the ductal wall, the lesion is<br>
referred to as invasive ductal cancer. Cancer forms in the same way in the glandular<br><br>
lobules of the breast. All of the above cells are often cited as being high-water<br>
content with the exception of pure fat tissue (low-water content) and pure<br>
glandular/connective tissue (low to medium-water content) within the breast.<br>
[023] Microwave radiation in the Industrial, Scientific, Medical (ISM) band 902 to<br>
928 MHz is commonly used in commercial clinical hyperthermia systems, and is the<br>
primary frequency band considered here. Very little detailed microwave heating<br>
information on female breast tissues exists - however, it is well known that<br>
carcinomas of the breast are selectively heated compared to surrounding fatty breast<br>
tissues. Four main articles are: 1) Chaudhary et al., Indian Journal of Biochemistry<br>
and Biophysics, Vol. 21, pp. 76-79,1984; 2) Joines et al., Medical Physics, Vol. 21,<br>
No. 4, pp. 547-550, 1994; 3) Surowiec et al., IEEE Transactions on Biomedical<br>
Engineering, Vol. 35, No. 4, pp. 257-263,1988 and 4) Campbell and Land, Physics in<br>
Medicine and Biology, Vol. 37, No. I, 193-210, 1992. Another article, Burdette,<br>
AAPM Medical Physics Monographs, No. 8, pp. 105,130, 1982, has measured data<br>
for breast tissue, however, these data were measured through the skin and probably<br>
are not representative of breast tissue itself. The dielectric properties are usually<br>
given in terms of dielectric constant and electrical conductivity as depicted for normal<br>
breast tissue and breast tumor as shown in Figure 3. At 915 MHz, removing the data<br>
from the Burdette study, the average dielectric constant of normal breast is 12.5 and<br>
the average conductivity is 0.21 S/m. In contrast, for breast tumor the average<br>
dielectric constant is 58.6 and the average conductivity is 1.03 S/m. Note: The data<br>
from Chaudhary et al (C) and Joines et al (J) studies are measured at room<br>
temperature (25° C). It should be noted that as temperature increases, generally the<br>
dielectric constant decreases and the electrical conductivity increases. The dielectric<br>
parameters of normal breast and breast tumor are similar to low-water content fatty<br>
tissue and high-water content muscle tissue, respectively. It should be noted that<br>
normal breast tissue contains a mixture of fat, glandular and connective tissues.<br>
Detailed information on 17 tissue types, including skin, muscle, and fat, is presented<br>
in an article by Gabriel et al, Phys. Med. Biol., Vol. 41, pp. 2271-2293,1996. The<br>
 article by Surowiec et al., has detailed information on selected glandular, ductal, fatty<br>
and cancerous tissues, but they only measured the parameters in the range 20 kHz to<br>
100 MHz. It is possible to estimate the electrical properties of breast tissues at 915<br><br>
MHz from data measured at 100 MHz. Applicants are not aware of any measured<br>
dielectric parameter data on pure ductal and glandular breast tissue for the frequency<br>
of interest, namely 915 MHz.<br>
[024] The article by Campbell and Land has measured dielectric parameter data at<br>
3.2 GHz, and the percent water content of breast fat, glandular and connective tissue,<br>
benign tumors (including fibroadenomas), and malignant tumors. Their measured<br>
data of percent water content can be used to assess the relative heatability of breast<br>
tissues, that is, higher water content tissues heat faster than lower water content<br>
tissues. The range of values for measured water content (by weight) is as follows:<br>
breast fat (11 to 31%), glandular and connective tissue (41 to 76%), benign tumors<br>
(62 to 84%), and malignant tumors (66 to 79%) where selected values are depicted in<br>
Figure 4. Thus based on water content, it is expected that benign breast lesions and<br>
breast tumors will heat significantly faster than glandular, connective, and fatty breast<br>
tissues. Typically, for electrical conductivity at 3.2 GHz, their best choice of<br>
I measured values is as follows: breast fat (0.11 to 0.14 S/m), glandular and connective<br>
tissue (0.35 to 1.05 S/m), benign tumors (1.0 to 4.0 S/m), and malignant tumors (3.0<br>
to 4.0 S/m). Accordingly, the electrical conductivity of benign and malignant tumors<br>
tends to be up to about four times higher than the glandular and connective tissue and<br>
to about 30 times higher than pure fat. These data are consistent with the electrical<br>
) conductivity data measured at 915 MHz by Chaudhary et al. as well as by Joines et al<br>
shown in Figure 3.<br>
[025] Moreover, Chaudhary 1984 has measured electrical conductivity data for<br>
normal breast tissue at 3 GHz, where the conductivity is 0.36 S/m, consistent with the<br>
range (0.35 to 1.05 S/m) for normal glandular and connective tissue measured by<br>
5 Campbell and Land at 3.2 GHz. Thus, from the best available data, breast fat is low-<br>
water content, glandular and connective tissue is low to medium-water content, and<br>
breast tumors are high-water content. Accordingly, it is expected that benign and<br>
malignant tumor cells will be heated much more rapidly and to significantly higher<br>
temperatures than the surrounding fat, glandular, ductal, and connective tissue cells.<br>
0 In other words, only the microscopic and visible tumor cells are preferentially heated<br>
in this treatment, with all the surrounding fat, glandular, ductal, and connective<br>
tissues spared from heat damage.<br><br>
[026] Tissue electrical conductivity is a primary controlling parameter for tissue<br>
heating with microwave energy. Tissue electrical conductivity is also referred to as<br>
tissue ionic conductivity with units of Siemens per meter. Electrical conductivity is a<br>
function of the tissue properties primarily the water content, ion content, and<br>
temperature (F.A. Duck, Physical Properties of Tissue, Academic Press, 1990,<br>
Chapter 6, pp. 167-223). The electrical conductivity increases as the water content,<br>
ion content, and temperature of the tissue increases. For example, physiological<br>
saline has a higher ionic conductivity than pure water. Warm saline has a higher<br>
ionic conductivity than cool saline. Invasive or infiltrating breast cancer cells are<br>
reported as being moderately to poorly differentiated, meaning they increasingly lose<br>
the ability to function as normal cells. As cancer cells lose their functionality they<br>
can swell in size and absorb more water thereby increasing the percent water content.<br>
Ions in the water of a cancer cell play a significant role in the cell's ionic<br>
conductivity. Ions are electrically charged particles either positive or negative. The<br>
important ions in tissues include potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), sodium (Na+), and<br>
chlorine (C1-). The calcium ion has two less electrons than protons and is positively<br>
charged (2+). Calcium can attract and hold two chlorine (C1-) ions. Potassium can<br>
attract and hold only one chlorine (C1-) ion. The calcium and chloride ions in<br>
calcium chloride (CaC12) will dissociate or separate and increase in mobility when<br>
dissolved in water that increases the ionic conductivity of the water solution. Tightly<br>
clustered calcium deposits (known as microcalcifications) appearing on<br>
mammograms are often associated with carcinomas (S.M. Love, Dr. Susan Love's<br>
Breast Book, Third Edition, Persus Publishing, 2000, pp. 130-131). A tiny cluster of<br>
microcalcifications in a milk duct is usually attributed to precancer. Big chunks of<br>
calcium are usually associated with a benign lesion such as a fibroadenoma. Some of<br>
the calcifications appearing in the breast are from calcium leaving the bone, traveling<br>
through the blood stream and randomly deposited within the breast.<br>
[027] The proteins and ionic components in breast cyst fluid have been measured<br>
(B. Gairard, et al, "Proteins and Ionic Components in Breast Cyst Fluids", in<br>
Endocrinology of Cystic Breast Disease, A. Angeli, et al editors, Raven Press, New<br>
York, 1983, pp. 191-195. H.L. Bradlow, et al, "Cations in Breast Cyst Fluid," in<br>
Endocrinology of Cystic Breast Disease, A. Angeli, et al editors, Raven Press, New<br><br>
York, 1983, pp. 197-201.) Breast cyst fluids contain sodium (NA+), potassium (K+),<br>
chloride (C1-), calcium (CA2+), phosphate (P04-), and magnesium ions (Mg2+).<br>
Bradlow cites three categories of breast cyst fluids:<br>
Type I: high levels of potassium (K+) and medium levels of sodium (Na+) and<br>
chloride (C1-),<br>
Type II: high levels of potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) and medium levels of<br>
chloride (C1-), and<br>
Type m: high levels of sodium (Na+), medium levels of chloride (C1-), and low levels<br>
of potassium (K+). The high-water and high-ion contents of breast cysts should allow<br>
preferential heating with microwaves when compared to the heating of surrounding<br>
normal healthy breast tissue.<br>
[028] There are several types of cysts: gross cysts forming palpable tumors, cysts<br>
containing inspissated (thickened) milk - so called "galactoceles", cysts evolving from<br>
duct ectasia, cysts resulting from fat necrosis, cysts associated with intraductal<br>
papilloma - so called "papillary cystadenoma, and cysts induced by the administration<br>
of estrogen. Gross (very large) cysts can develop quickly and obtain a moderate size<br>
that persists, while some decrease in size and even disappear with time. A<br>
considerable portion of gross cysts are discovered in the premenstrual or menstrual<br>
phase and enlarge rapidly and become painful and tender. Gross cysts are sometimes<br>
associated with signs of acute inflammation, pain, tenderness, and slight redness of<br>
the overlying skin. Following needle aspiration of the cyst fluid, signs of<br>
inflammation promptly subside. After aspiration is completed, only a fibrosed cyst<br>
wall remains. However, cyst fluid escaping into the surrounding breast tissue can<br>
produce acute irritation. Gross cysts are most common in the age group between 30<br>
and 54 years, or about 95% of cases. The more extensively a surgeon operating for<br>
cystic conditions explores the breast, more cysts are likely to be found.<br>
[029] Fibroadenomas (very common benign lumps, also called fibroids) are smooth<br>
and hard and can vary in size from 5 mm up to about 5 cm. Fibroadenomas have a<br>
high water content (mean 78.5%, n=6) based on a small sample of measurements<br>
) (Campbell and Land, Dielectric Properties of Female Human Breast Tissue Measured<br>
in vitro at 3.2 GHz, Phys Med Biol 1992; vol. 37(1), pp. 193-210) and should be<br>
readily heated by microwave energy compared to surrounding healthy breast tissue.<br><br>
These benign lesions are usually distinct on mammography and ultrasound and can be<br>
surgically removed if desired. Some patients will have multiple fibroadenomas, and<br>
breast conserving surgery then becomes impractical. Limited data exist for the<br>
measured water content of other benign tumors from the study by Campbell and Land<br>
as given below.<br>
[030] Benign fibrosis tumors: The median water content for one patient (age 26) in<br>
the Campbell and Land study was 65.5%, suggestive of high-water content. Fibrosis<br>
refers to the formation of fibrous tissue that can occur as a reparative or reactive<br>
process. Fibrous breast disease is a special type of fibrosis that suppresses and<br>
obliterates both the acini of the lobules and the mammary ducts in a localized portion<br>
of the breast, and forms a palpable tumor. Fibrosis is abnormally firm (but not as<br>
hard as a carcinoma) and usually requires a local excision; however, the limits of the<br>
disease are often not well defined since the lesion shape is irregularly discoid rather<br>
than rounded like a cyst.<br>
[031 ] Benign fibroadrosis tumors: The median water content for one patient (age<br>
27) in the Campbell and Land study was 73.5% suggestive of high-water content.<br>
[032] Benign epitheliosis (also known as papillomatosis) tumors: The median water<br>
content for one patient (age 40) in the Campbell and Land study was 61% suggestive<br>
of high-water content. Papillomatosis is a papillary proliferation of the ductal<br>
epithelium which partly fills up smaller ducts and to a degree distends them.<br>
Papillomatosis is usually microscopic and appears often with cystic disease, tumor<br>
adnosis, multiple papilloma, or some other tumor-forming lesion.<br>
[033] Benign adnosis tumors: The median water content for one patient (age 43) in<br>
the Campbell and Land study was 38%, suggestive of low-water content. Benign<br>
adnosis is a proliferation of the acini of the mammary lobules appearing both<br>
microscopically and as a definite tumor. These tumors (benign adnosis) may not heat<br>
significantly compared to surrounding normal breast tissue, but only one data sample<br>
was measured and may not be representative of other benign adnosis tumors.<br>
[034] In summary, benign lesions such as cysts, fibroadenomas, fibrosis,<br>
fibroadrosis, and epitheliosis (also known as papillomatosis) appear to be high-water<br>
and/or high-ionic content and should be readily heated by microwave energy. Benign<br>
adnosis lesions may not heat as rapidly as cysts having high-water and/or high-ionic<br><br>
content; however, it is unclear as the data, upon which this is based, is limited to a<br>
single patient.<br>
[035] In the case of advanced breast cancer (e.g., a tumor 5-8 cm), the Assignee's<br>
inventive method can destroy a significant portion of the breast cancer cells with heat<br>
alone or with heat in combination with chemotherapy. By shrinking the tumor or<br>
lesion (i.e., thermal downsizing to e.g., 2-3 cm) it may be possible to replace a<br>
surgical mastectomy with a surgical lumpectomy. Ideally, the entire advanced breast<br>
cancer lesion can be destroyed (that is, a thermal mastectomy or a thermochemo<br>
mastectomy) and no surgery may be required. As discussed below, early-stage breast<br>
cancer or small breast lesions maybe destroyed with the Assignee's inventive method.<br>
That is, all of the breast cancer cells or benign lesions may be destroyed with heat<br>
(i.e., a thermal lumpectomy) thereby avoiding a surgical lumpectomy.<br>
[036] Thermotherapy may be used as a heat-alone treatment prior to an initial (or<br>
second or third) lumpectomy to reduce the need for re-excision (additional surgery),<br>
which occurs when positive margins (cancerous cells) are detected in a lumpectomy<br>
specimen. Around 30% of lumpectomy specimen have positive margins that require<br>
a second incision. Since the method according to the invention heats tissue from the<br>
outside in to the target area (in contrast to RF ablation, which heats from the inside<br>
out), the method according to the invention addresses the margins. Hence, the<br>
thermotherapy treatment according to the invention can be applied prior to surgery<br>
with the expectation that cancer cells in the margins are ablated. As a result, after the<br>
initial surgery (lumpectomy), the area around the excised tissue (margins) is tested<br>
and a reduction in the cancer in the margins is expected thereby avoiding the need for<br>
a second (or third) incision. The thermotherapy treatment according to the invention<br>
theoretically could be employed as a thermo- lumpectomy, which replaces the<br>
invasive lumpectomy surgical procedure. Thus, the amount of cancer in the breast<br>
may be significantly reduced or destroyed in its entirety by the thermotherapy<br>
treatment according to the invention.<br>
[037] It is further envisioned that the thermotherapy treatment according to the<br>
invention could be used in combination with gene based modifiers to benefit patients<br>
that have abnormal (mutant) genes in their tissue, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, or other<br>
genes. The presence of these abnormal genes has been shown as increasing the risk of<br><br>
that patient getting cancer, and thus the ablation of these genes should reduce the<br>
patient's risk of getting cancer. Either a heat-alone thermotherapy treatment or<br>
thermotherapy with chemotherapy and/or gene based modifiers combined with heat<br>
should reduce breast cancer recurrence by destroying any cancerous cells in the<br>
margins thereby providing tissue free of cancer, or to destroy or repair mutant genes<br>
responsible for cancer and other diseases. In addition, the method can be used in<br>
combination with thermosensitive liposomes as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,888<br>
and/or targeted gene therapy delivery for treating breast lesions to enhance radiation<br>
therapy and/or for targeted drug delivery to aid in the destruction of cancerous or<br>
abnormal cells in the margins. Breast cancer begins within the breast ducts and then<br>
invades outwards into surrounding breast tissues and subsequently spreads outside the<br>
breast via the lymphatic and vascular (blood) systems. Thus, a thermotherapy<br>
treatment alone or in combination with chemotherapy and/or gene based modifiers<br>
should reduce breast cancer recurrence within the breast or other organs by killing<br>
cancer cells or mutant genes within the lymphatic and vascular systems of the breast.<br>
[038] The heat-treatment therapy according to the invention could be used alone or<br>
in combination with chemotherapy and/or gene based modifiers to prctreat other<br>
organs, such as the prostate, liver, ovaries, etc., in which the presence of abnormal or<br>
mutant genes may lead to a higher occurrence of cancer. In addition, the use of heat-<br>
alone thermotherapy or thermotherapy with chemotherapy and/or gene based<br>
modifiers may be beneficial when there is a presence of atypical cells in an organ, as<br>
determined by ductal lavage or other diagnostic technologies.<br>
Thermotherapy for Early -Stage Breast Cancer<br>
[039] In a small group of early-stage breast cancer patients, Phase H clinical<br>
thermotherapy treatments conducted with the Celsion Corporation Microfocus APA<br>
1000 breast thermotherapy system have significantly reduced the percent of viable<br>
tumor cells on the order of 70 to 90% employing either one or two heat-alone<br>
treatments. In certain patients, heat-alone thermotherapy may completely destroy<br>
breast cancer cells prior to a scheduled lumpectomy thereby avoiding surgery and<br>
preventing local recurrence of breast cancer. In other patients, heat-alone<br>
thermotherapy may reduce the need for second or third lumpectomies by providing<br><br>
margins free of cancer cells. These heat-alone treatments produce equivalent thermal<br>
doses (relative to 43 degrees C) up to approximately 200 minutes with peak tumor<br>
temperatures of 48.3 degrees C and a microwave energy dose of 250 kilojoules.<br>
Additional thermotherapy treatments, higher equivalent thermal dose and higher<br>
breast tumor temperatures may be required to complete heat-alone ablation of breast<br>
carcinomas. Tumor temperatures in the range of 49 to 50 degrees C or up to 55<br>
degrees C may be required for complete ablation of tumors with an equivalent<br>
thermal dose of 400 minutes and a microwave energy dose up to 500 kilojoules.<br>
With these significant thermal and microwave energy doses it may be necessary to<br>
provide additional safety methods for protecting the breast skin and adjacent healthy<br>
tissues such as the chest wall region from any heat damage.<br>
Thermotherapy for ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS)<br>
[040] Ductal carcinoma in situ, also known as DCIS or intraductal carcinoma,<br>
represents a major therapeutic dilemma. Approximately 41,000 new cases of DCIS<br>
were expected to be diagnosed in the year 2001 according to Cancer Facts and<br>
Figures 2001, American Cancir Society, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, 192,200<br>
new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected. Out of the expected 238,600 cases<br>
of new breast cancers diagnosed, 80.6% are invasive, 17% are DCIS, the rest (2.4%)<br>
are LOS (lobular carcinoma in situ) (Cancer Facts and Figures 2001). A needle<br>
biopsy diagnosis of DCIS may underestimate the presence of the invasive disease due<br>
to a sampling error. As a result of the sampling error, an accurate diagnosis of the<br>
disease progress can be difficult to obtain. Studies report that 16% to 20% of patients<br>
with DCIS diagnosed by needle biopsy were subsequently diagnosed with invasive<br>
disease upon surgical excision (D.P. Winchester, J.M. Jeske, R.A. Goldschmidt, "The<br>
Diagnosis and Management of Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ of the Breast", CA Cancer J<br>
Clin 2000; 50: pp. 184-200). Thus, surgical excision is currently a requirement for<br>
DCIS patients, in order to determine an appropriate treatment strategy. For example,<br>
after an initial diagnosis of DCIS with a subsequent determination of invasive cancer<br>
following lumpectomy and pathology, the lymph nodes (particularly the sentinel<br>
lymph node(s)) may need to be biopsied and treated. At that time, stage appropriate<br>
systemic therapy may also be required. The major goal of any pathologic evaluation<br><br><br><br><br><br>
of a DOS patient is to determine the level of risk of subsequent invasion so that<br>
proper treatment is offered and possible over- or under-treatment is avoided.<br>
[041 ] Based on mammographic and pathologic evaluation of the DCIS disease, in<br>
some cases breast-conserving surgery can be accomplished with an acceptable<br>
5 cosmetic result. However, long-term follow-up of DCIS patients treated with<br>
complete surgical excision and radiation therapy shows that as many as 19% or more<br>
of DCIS patients experience a local recurrence, with up to 50% of these local<br>
recurrences being invasive. For DCIS patients treated only with lumpectomy, the<br>
recurrence rate can be as high as 26%.<br>
10 [042] To understand the impact on the survival rates associated with a local<br>
recurrence, consider the following: For DCIS patients that have negative margins<br>
after surgery and standard postoperative radiation therapy, at least 80% will achieve<br>
long-term local control. That is, with long-term follow-up, approximately 20% of the<br>
patients will experience local recurrences. Of that 20%, 10% will have non-invasive<br>
15 recurrence and 10% will have invasive recurrence. The patients with non-invasive<br>
recurrence will achieve virtually 100% local control and cure with mastectomy. The<br>
patients with invasive local recurrence will experience a 75% five-year survival rate<br>
with mastectomy; that is, 25% wil! not survive five years. Thus, for patients with<br>
DCIS managed with breast-conserving treatment, 10% of the patients will have a<br>
20 non-invasive recurrence at a later date and must then have a mastectomy. The other<br>
10% that have an invasive recurrence must have mastectomy, and 25% of those<br>
patients will die within 5 years. Thus, about 2.5% of patients receiving breast-<br>
conserving treatment (lumpectomy and radiation) for DCIS will die within 5 years of<br>
local recurrence. Based on 41,000 DCIS cases per year, 2.5% of these patients<br>
25 represents 1,025 DCIS patients that will die within 5 years from invasive recurrence.<br>
Given these percentages, most patients will choose a breast-conserving approach;<br>
however, these patients will experience significant side effects from the radiation<br>
therapy portion of breast conservation. It should also be noted that radiation therapy<br>
is a costly procedure and time-consuming (20 to 30 fractionated treatments are<br>
30 usually required).<br>
[043] A novel approach to treating ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) is the use of<br>
thermotherapy (one or two treatments) following lumpectomy to provide a recurrence<br><br><br>
rate equal to or less than the recurrence rate for radiotherapy following lumpectomy,<br>
with fewer side effects. The cost for thermotherapy is expected to be less than the<br>
cost of radiation therapy, thus resulting in savings to the overall health cost.<br>
Thermotherapy may also be given several times with conventional radiation therapy<br>
for increased effectiveness in destroying ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS).<br>
Thermochemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer in the intact breast<br>
[044] According to the invention, for advanced breast cancer, heat and<br>
chemotherapy could be used together to destroy and/or downsize the primary breast<br>
cancer thereby converting mastectomy candidate patients to a more conservative<br>
lumpectomy surgery. In certain situations, patients may require pre-operative<br>
chemotherapy as part of their breast cancer treatment regimen. This would entail four<br>
cycles or courses of chemotherapy administered in accordance with standard pre-<br>
operative and post-operative chemotherapy delivery as in NSABP B-l 8 (Fisher et al.,<br>
1997, J. Clinical Oncology, vol. 15(7), pages 2483-2493; and Fisher et al, 1998, J.<br>
Clinical Oncology, vol. 16(8), pages 2672-2685). Each cycle of Adriamycin<br>
(Doxorubicin) at 60 mg/m2 and Cytoxan (Cyclophosphamide) at 600 mg/m2 is<br>
administered every 21 days. Tumor size is measured via a clinical exam and<br>
ultrasound imaging at the beginning of each cycle of chemotherapy. According to one<br>
embodiment of the invention, a focused microwave phased array thermotherapy<br>
session can be administered on the same day as the administration of the first, second,<br>
and third course of pre-operative AC chemotherapy or within 36 hours of<br>
administration of AC chemotherapy. The remaining (fourth) cycle of AC<br>
chemotherapy would then be administered without thermotherapy prior to surgery in<br>
order to allow sufficient time for any skin related thermotherapy effects to resolve<br>
(for example, skin blisters). It is not until after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy is<br>
completed that a final assessment is made of the breast to determine whether a<br>
mastectomy or a more conservative breast surgery will be made. Other combination<br>
chemotherapy treatments, such as Doxorubicin and Docetaxel or FAC (5-<br>
Fluorouracil, Doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide), for breast cancer could be<br>
combined with thermotherapy for neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Applicants<br>
also envision that thermotherapy could be applied prior to chemotherapy to shrink the<br>
breast tumor before chemotherapy is infused.<br><br>
[045] It is known that pre-operative AC chemotherapy will cause approximately<br>
80% of breast cancer tumors to have some shrinkage. Tumor shrinkage is usually<br>
seen after the first course of AC chemotherapy is completed and is typically observed<br>
by ultrasound imaging about 21 days after the first course of AC chemotherapy is<br>
completed. There is not enough data to prove that the combination of thermotherapy<br>
and AC chemotherapy will cause tumors to shrink as much as AC chemotherapy by<br>
itself. Thus, in another embodiment, to see significant shrinkage it may be desirable<br>
to administer at least one dose of chemotherapy prior to administering thermotherapy.<br>
If three thermotherapy courses are used, thermotherapy will be administered on the<br>
same day or within 36 hours of the administration of the second, third, and fourth<br>
course of pre-operative chemotherapy. If two thermotherapy courses are used,<br>
thermotherapy could be administered on the same day or within 36 hours of the<br>
administration of the second and third course, or third and fourth course of pre-<br>
operative chemotherapy, or second and fourth course of chemotherapy.<br>
[046] Following the delivery of chemotherapy, thermotherapy is applied so that<br>
tumor temperatures reach between approximately 43 - 46 degrees C, and tumors<br>
receive equivalent thermal doses of approximately 50 to 100 minutes per treatment,<br>
and microwave energy doses of approximately 100 to 300 kilojoules. At the end of<br>
the fourth and last course of chemotherapy, the decision is made, based on the same<br>
guidelines used when the patient was enrolled in the study (that is, size and location<br>
of tumor, size of breast, patient health, and patient age), whether the patient will<br>
receive a mastectomy or a partial mastectomy (lumpectomy) for breast conservation.<br>
Following the pre-operative thermochemotherapy regimen, the usual standard of care<br>
(including drugs and radiation) will be given to all patients. At the discretion of the<br>
physician, patients that are estrogen-receptor positive will receive Tamoxifen at 10<br>
mg twice a day for 5 years, beginning on the day after their last dose of<br>
chemotherapy. In addition, radiation therapy to the breast tissues and lymph nodes<br>
will be given as part of the standard of care for eligible patients.<br>
Thermotherapy for benign breast lesions<br>
[047] Recent Phase II clinical thermotherapy treatments of malignant breast lesions<br>
conducted with the Celsion Corporation Microfocus APA 1000 breast thermotherapy<br><br>
system revealed significant damage to breast carcinomas and benign breast lesions<br>
(cysts) from heat alone treatments. Based on these clinical treatments, tumor<br>
temperatures in the range of approximately 47 to 50 degrees C or up to approximately<br>
55 degrees C may be required for complete ablation of benign breast lesions. The<br>
above tumor temperatures together with an equivalent thermal dose of up to 360<br>
minutes and microwave energy dose up to 400 kilojoules should ablate benign breast<br>
lesions. Since analgesics (Naproxen Sodium tablets 220 mg) are normally<br>
administered to patients suffering from the pain of benign breast lesions, one or more<br>
thermotherapy treatments would be given together with analgesics for pain reduction<br>
according to a preferred procedure according to the invention.<br>
Thermotherapy and Drug Therapy for primary breast cancer prevention<br>
[048] The current standard of care for breast cancer prevention is either<br>
prophylactic mastectomy (surgical removal of the breasts) or Tamoxifen<br>
treatment. Tamoxifen (and other drugs like raloxifene) is an antiestrogen drug<br>
which has an affinity for estrogen receptors and prevents estrogen from binding to<br>
breast carcinomas. In the NSABP P-l Breast Cancer Prevention Trial, 13,175<br>
participants received either Tamoxifen (20 mg daily for 5 years) or placebo.<br>
Overall a 49% reduction in the risk of invasive breast carcinomas was observed in<br>
the Tamoxifen (trade name Nolvadex) group (Fisher B., et al. "Tamoxifen For<br>
Prevention of Breast Cancer: Report of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and<br>
Bowel Project P-l Study", Journal of National Cancer Institute, Volume 90,<br>
pp.1371 - 88, 1998; Morrow M. and Jordan V. C, "Tamoxifen for the Prevention<br>
of Breast Cancer in High-risk Woman", Annals Surg Oncol, Volume 7(1), pp. 67-<br>
71, 2000). A novel hypothesis is that thermotherapy added to a Tamoxifen<br>
prevention treatment may further increase the reduction in the risk of invasive<br>
breast carcinomas by increasing the amount of blockage of estrogen to the<br>
estrogen receptors of breast carcinomas. The amount of blockage of estrogen may<br>
be achieved by damaging or modifying the estrogen receptors and/or by killing<br>
breast carcinomas directly with the heat. In such a hypothesized clinical trial,<br>
patients in the thermotherapy and Tamoxifen arm would receive the standard dose<br>
of Tamoxifen (20 mg per day for 5 years) and thermotherapy at regular intervals<br>
during the same 5-year period. As it is envisioned that patients in such a clinical<br><br><br>
trial would not have a well defined lesion, the target region would simply be the<br>
upper portion of the breast where approximately 70% of all breast cancers occur as<br>
measured from the nipple to the upper base of the breast (Mammography - A<br>
User's Guide, NCRP Report No. 85, National Council on Radiation Protection<br>
and Measurements, Bethesda, p. 7,1987). For thermotherapy treatment targeting<br>
the upper portion of the breast, breast compression would be in the cranial-caudal<br>
(head-to-toe) position and the E-field focusing probe would be positioned<br>
approximately 0.5 to 1.5 cm toward the cranial side of the breast (as measured<br>
from the central breast depth). A microwave energy dose of approximately 180<br>
kilojoules (100 Watts total for 30 minutes) would be administered to the breast in<br>
each of multiple treatments spaced at approximately one-year intervals during the<br>
administration of Tamoxifen. A control group for this hypothetical clinical trial<br>
would include patients receiving Tamoxifen treatment only. An initial microwave<br>
power for each of the two channels may be approximately 50 Watts, which has<br>
been verified to be a safe power level based on the treatment of approximately 35<br>
breast cancer patients in Celsion Corporation's Phase I and Phase II adaptive<br>
phased array breast thermotherapy clinical studies. Skin temperature sensors may<br>
be monitored and the microwave power of the two channels would be adjusted in<br>
order to keep skin temperatures below about 41 degrees Celsius during the<br>
thermotherapy treatment.<br>
[049] In thermotherapy treatments according to the invention for one of early-stage<br>
breast cancer, locally advanced breast cancer, benign breast lesions and breast cancer<br>
prevention, it is preferred that skin temperatures remain below approximately 40 to<br>
42° C during treatment. However, as discussed above, tumor temperatures may be<br>
generated in the range of approximately 43 to 50 °C or higher.<br>
[050] During Phase I and II clinical testing of the Celsion Micro focus 1000<br>
externally focused adaptive phased array microwave system, applicants noted that, in<br>
a few, cases, the skin tissue in the vicinity of base of the breast, near the chest wall,<br>
was heated more strongly than desired. In addition, it was also discovered that<br>
mechanical compression of the breast tissue sometimes caused a non-thermal blister<br>
at the edge of the compression plate where pressure is the strongest. Consequently,<br>
the instant invention provides improvements to the Assignee's adaptive phased array<br><br>
microwave system to alleviate and/or reduce these side effects.<br>
Method for Heating Ductal and Glandular Carcinomas and Surrounding Breast<br>
Tissues<br>
[051] Figure 5 shows a preferred system for heating carcinomas in intact breast,<br>
using an adaptive microwave phased array hyperthermia system with E-field and<br>
temperature feedback. In order to heat deep tissues reliably at microwave<br>
frequencies, it is necessary to surround the body (breast) with two or more coherent<br>
applicators 100 controlled by an adaptive phased array algorithm. The black circle,<br>
indicated as focus 190, represents a tumor or healthy tissue that is to be treated. In<br>
the preferred embodiment, an E-field feedback probe 175 is used to focus the<br>
microwave radiation, and temperature feedback sensors 410 attached to the breast<br>
surface skin are used to adjust the microwave power level to heat the tumor to a<br>
desired temperature. A two-channel adaptive phased array is used to heat deep<br>
tissues within a compressed breast similar to the geometry used in x-ray<br>
mammography. Preferably, the E-field probe is used with an adaptive phased array<br>
fast-acceleration gradient search algorithm, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,888 to<br>
Fenn, to target the microwave radiation at the tumor site.<br>
T052] Additionally, air-cooled waveguide applicator apertures preferably are used to<br>
provide a heating pattern that can heat large volumes of breast tissue containing<br>
ductal and glandular carcinomas. The air for cooling the waveguide apertures can be<br>
refrigerated, air-conditioned or room temperature. Based on the dielectric parameter<br>
differences at 915 MHz between high-water content tissues and fatty breast tissue, the<br>
high-water content ductal and glandular carcinoma tissues are expected to heat more<br>
rapidly than normal breast tissue. Thus, the treated region will be concentrated on the<br>
high-water content (cancerous and pre-cancerous) carcinoma tissue and benign<br>
lesions such as fibroadenomas and cysts, while sparing the normal (healthy) breast<br>
tissue.<br>
[053] The body or breast is compressed between two compression plates 200, which<br>
are made from a dielectric such as plexiglass that is transparent to microwaves.<br>
Breast compression has a number of potential advantages for intact breast<br>
hyperthermia treatments. Utilization of breast compression results in less penetration<br>
depth required to achieve deep microwave heating and reduces blood flow which also<br><br>
improves the ability to heat tissue. Compressing the breast to a flat surface improves<br>
the interface and electric-field coupling between the microwave applicator and the<br>
breast tissue, and allows a single pair of applicators to treat a wide range of breast<br>
sizes. Cooling of the breast compression plates with air during hyperthermia<br>
treatments helps avoid the potential for skin-surface hot spots. Compressing the<br>
breast with the patient in a prone position, such as that used in 20 to 40 minute<br>
stereotactic needle breast biopsy procedures (Bassett et al., A Cancer Journal for<br>
Clinicians, Vol. 47, pp. 171 -190,1997), maximizes the amount of breast tissue within<br>
the compression device. Mild compression immobilizes the breast tissue such that<br>
any potential patient motion complications are eliminated. The compression plates<br>
200, which can include small apertures, are compatible with x-ray and ultrasound<br>
imaging techniques to accurately locate the central glandular/ductal region and assist<br>
in the placement of the invasive E-field probe sensor. The amount of compression<br>
can be varied from about 4 to 8 cm to accommodate patient tolerance during a 20 to<br>
40 minute or longer hyperthermia treatment. A patient-comfort study of breast<br>
compression in mammography indicated that mammography was painful (defined as<br>
either very uncomfortable or intolerable) in only 8% of the 560 women examined. In<br>
that study the mean compression thickness was 4.63 cm with a standard deviation (1<br>
sigma) of 1.28 cm (Sullivan et al., Radiology, Vol. 181, pp. 355-357, 1991). Thus,<br>
hyperthermia treatments under mild breast compression for 20 to 40 minutes or<br>
longer is feasible.<br>
[054] Prior to hyperthermia treatment, the breast is compressed between<br>
compression plates 200 and a single invasive E-field feedback sensor 175 is inserted<br>
within the central glandular/ductal/tumor tissue site (focus 190) in the breast, parallel<br>
to the polarization of the microwave applicators 100. E-field probe 175 is used in<br>
monitoring the focal E-field amplitude as the phase shifters are adjusted for<br>
maximum feedback signal using an adaptive phased array gradient search algorithm.<br>
Noninvasive temperature probes 410 are taped or otherwise secured to the skin<br>
surface of the breast to monitor the skin temperature. The temperature probes are<br>
typically oriented at right angles to the E-field polarization so as not to be heated by<br>
the microwave energy. The dual-applicator adaptive phased array of the invention<br>
together with the E-field feedback probe allows the phase shifters to be adjusted so<br><br>
that a concentrated E-field can be generated permitting focused heating in tissue at<br>
depth.<br>
[055] Figures 6 and 14 to 17 show an embodiment of safety methods applied to<br>
externally focused adaptive microwave phased array thermotherapy for treatment of<br>
breast tumors (malignant and benign).<br>
[056] In a preferred method illustrated in Figure 6, the patient lies prone with the<br>
breast pendulant through a hole in the treatment table 210 and the treated breast 220<br>
is compressed with flat plastic compression plates 200, which immobilize the breast<br>
tissue, reduce blood flow, and reduce the penetration depth required for the<br>
microwave radiation. The treatment table 210 may be similar to a stereotactic<br>
imaging breast needle biopsy table such as manufactured by Fischer Imaging (Denver,<br>
Colorado) in which the table is metallic and covered by a soft pad for patient comfort.<br>
For breast imaging purposes, the metallic bed serves as a rigid structural support.<br>
For breast thermotherapy, the metallic table 210 also serves as a shield to microwave<br>
radiation so that the entire body, in particular the patient's head and eyes, are fully<br>
protected from any stray microwave radiation from the microwave applicators 100.<br>
The metallic table 210 can be fabricated from aluminum or steel or from plastic with<br>
either a metal foil or metal mesh coating. The table pad 212 can bt a foam material<br>
and may contain microwave-absorbing material for additional shielding from stray<br>
microwave radiation from the applicators.<br>
[057] The breast compression plates are made of a microwave transparent plastic<br>
material, and may contain one or more apertures of rectangular or circular shape to<br>
allow imaging of breast tissues and placement of a minimally invasive E-field<br>
feedback probe 175 at the desired focal depth. Insertion of E-field feedback probe<br>
175 may be achieved under the guidance of an ultrasound transducer. To provide<br>
additional protection against skin damage from the microwave fields, air flow 180 is<br>
provided by one or more cool-air fans (not shown).<br>
[058] As shown in Figure 5, two or more temperature feedback probe sensors 410<br>
are attached to the breast skin surface and produce the temperature feedback signals<br>
400. Two microwave air-cooled waveguide applicators 100 are positioned on<br>
opposite sides of the compression plates 200. A 915 MHz microwave oscillator 105<br>
is divided at node 107 and feeds phase shifters 120. The phase control signal 125<br><br>
controls the phase of the microwave signal over the range of 0 to 360 electrical<br>
degrees. The microwave signal from phase shifter 120 feeds into the microwave<br>
power amplifier 130 which is controlled by a computer-generated control signal 135,<br>
which sets the initial microwave power level. Coherent 915 MHz microwave power<br>
is delivered to the two waveguide applicators 100 while phase shifters 120 in each<br>
channel are adjusted to maximize and focus the microwave energy at the E-field<br>
probe sensor 175 so that microwave power is maximized at the focus position 190.<br>
The treatment then begins.<br>
[059] During the hyperthermia treatment, the microwave power level delivered to<br>
each of the applicators 100 is measured as a feedback signal 500, and the power<br>
control is adjusted either manually or automatically to control the skin temperatures<br>
and equivalent thermal dose measured by the skin sensors 410 to avoid high<br>
temperatures that could cause skin bums or blisters. The amount of breast<br>
compression is adjusted by the compression plates 200 as necessary during treatment<br>
to provide patient comfort. Each time the breast compression is adjusted or the breast<br>
repositioned the phase shifters 120 are readjusted/refocused so that the E-field probe<br>
sensor 175 receives maximum power. The total microwave energy, since the start of<br>
the treatment, delivered to the microwave applicators is computed within the<br>
computer 250 and displayed on the computer monitor 260 during the treatment. The<br>
treatment is completed when a desired amount of total microwave energy is delivered<br>
to the microwave applicators 100. As an alternate embodiment, the total microwave<br>
energy calculated from the E-field feedback signal 450 received by the E-field probe<br>
175 is used to control the length of the treatment. In order to determine the<br>
effectiveness of the treatment, the breast tissue is imaged with mammography means<br>
including x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging before and after the microwave total<br>
energy dose is administered, as well as pathological results from needle biopsy of the<br>
breast tissues.<br>
[060] As an alternate embodiment, the single invasive E-field probe 175 is replaced<br>
with two noninvasive E-field probes 185 positioned on the opposing skin surfaces.<br>
The total power measured by the two noninvasive E-field probes is minimized (as in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,888) by adjusting the microwave phase shifters 120, creating a<br>
focused E-field probe in the central portion of the breast. With this embodiment,<br><br>
there is no risk of infection due to an inserted probe, there is no risk of scarring of the<br>
breast skin by the procedure of nicking the skin and inserting the probe, and any risk<br>
of spreading cancer cells by the probe passing through the tumor bed is avoided.<br>
Likewise, since both the temperature and E-field probes can be placed on the breast<br>
skin with this method embodiment, this method would work well when there is no<br>
defined single area.<br>
[061] Preferably, each channel (on either side of node 107) of the phased array<br>
contains an electronically-variable microwave power amplifier 130 (0 to 100 W), an<br>
electronically-variable phase shifter 120 (0 to 360 degrees), and air-cooled<br>
linearly-polarized rectangular waveguide applicators 100. Applicators 100 may be<br>
Model Number TEM-2 manufactured by Celsion Corporation, Columbia, MD. The<br>
rectangular aperture dimensions of a preferred pair of TEM-2 metallic waveguide<br>
applicators are 6.5 cm by 13.0 cm.<br>
[062] While the preferred embodiment discloses microwave energy at<br>
approx imately 915 MHz, the frequency of the microwave energy may be between 100<br>
MHz and 10 GHz. The frequency of the microwave energy could be selected from<br>
the range of 902 MHz and 928 MHz. In fact, lower frequencies of energy may be<br>
used to ablate or prevent cancerous tissue.<br>
[063] In a preferred embodiment, the initial microwave power delivered to each<br>
waveguide application is between 20 and 60 Watts. Over the entire treatment of the<br>
tissue, the microwave power delivered to each waveguide application may be<br>
adjusted over the range of 0-150 Watts to deliver the desired microwave energy dose<br>
and to avoid overheating the skin.<br>
[064] Dielectric loading of the side walls of the rectangular waveguide region of<br>
applicators 100 is used to obtain good impedance matching conditions for the TEM<br>
applicator microwave radiation (Cheung et al., "Dual-beam TEM applicator for<br>
direct-contact heating of dielectrically encapsulated malignant mouse tumor", Radio<br>
Science, Vol. 12, No. 6(S) Supplement, pp. 81-85,1977; Gautherie (Editor), Methods<br>
of external hyperthermic heating, Springer-Verlag, New York, p. 33, 1990). The<br>
1977 Cheung et al. article shows an example of dual-opposing non-coherent<br>
microwave applicators sequentially heating a mouse tumor - an E-field probe was not<br>
used in their experiments. Air cooling through the waveguide aperture is achieved by<br><br>
means of a fan (not shown) mounted behind a perforated conducting screen which<br>
serves as a parallel reflecting ground plane for the input monopole feed for the<br>
waveguide. Taking into account the thickness of the dielectric slabs in contact with<br>
the waveguide sidewalls, the effective cross-sectional size for the air-cooling is<br>
approximately 6.5 cm by 9.0 cm for the TEM-2 applicator. Based on the dielectric<br>
parameter differences at 915 MHz between high-water content tumor tissues and<br>
normal breast tissue, the high-water content ductal and glandular carcinomas and<br>
benign lesions are expected to heat more rapidly than normal breast tissue. Thus, the<br>
50% SAR region will be concentrated on the high-water content (cancerous, pre-<br>
cancerous, and benign lesions including fibroadenomas and cysts) tissue while<br>
sparing the normal tissue.<br>
[065] In a preferred embodiment, a 0.9-mm outside-diameter (OD) invasive E-field<br>
coaxial monopole probe (semi-rigid RG-034), with the center conductor extended 1<br>
cm, can be used to measure the amplitude of the electric field directed to the tissue<br>
and provide the feedback signal used to determine the necessary relative phase for the<br>
electronic phase shifters prior to treatment. Coaxially-fed monopole probes of this<br>
type have been used to make accurate measurements of linearly polarized electric<br>
fields in compressed breast phantoms (Fenn et al., International Symposium on<br>
Electromagnetic Compatibility 17-19 May 1994 pp. 566-569) Journal of<br>
Hyperthermia, Vol. 10, No. 2, March-April, pp. 189-208, 1994). This<br>
linearly-polarized E-field probe is inserted within a 1.5 mm OD teflon catheter.<br>
Thermocouple probes (Physitemp Instruments, Inc., Type T copper-constantan,<br>
enclosed within a 0.6 mm OD teflon catheter) were used to measure the local<br>
temperature in the tumor during treatment. These temperature probes have a response<br>
time of 100 ms with an accuracy of 0.1° C.<br>
Compressed Living Breast Tissue Heating Tests<br>
[066] As part of an FDA-approved Phase I clinical study conducted by the Assignee,<br>
Celsion Corporation, beginning in December 1999, several volunteer patients, with<br>
breast tumors varying in maximum dimension from 3 to 6 cm, were treated with an<br>
adaptive microwave phased array where both E-field and temperature probes were<br>
inserted into the breast tissue. Patients received a 40-minute treatment of<br>
hyperthermia and approximately one-week later underwent mastectomy. This clinical<br><br>
study included a measurement of the power delivered to the microwave applicators,<br>
which was used to compute the delivered microwave energy dose, but was not used to<br>
control the duration of the treatment. More detailed information regarding this Phase<br>
I clinical study is published in Gardner et al, "Focused Microwave Phased Array<br>
Thermotherapy For Primary Breast Cancer," Annals Surg Oncol, Volume 9(4), pp.<br>
326-332, May 6,2002.<br>
[067] The E-field probe was used with the adaptive phased array fast-acceleration<br>
gradient search algorithm, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,810,888 to Fenn, to target<br>
the microwave radiation at the tumor site. The temperature sensed by the invasive<br>
temperature probe in the tumor was used as a real-time feedback signal during the<br>
treatment. This feedback signal was used to control the microwave output power<br>
level of the variable power amplifiers, which set and maintained the focal temperature<br>
at the tumor site in the range of 43 to 46° C. The power and phase delivered to the<br>
two channels of the phased array were adjusted adaptively using digital-to-analog<br>
converters under computer control.<br>
[068] The breast compression plates were made of an acrylic material (plexiglass)<br>
which is a low-loss dielectric material and nearly transparent to microwave fields.<br>
The compression plates contained square cut-outs (apertures), approximately 5.5 cm<br>
on a side, which accommodate small ultrasound transducers (nominally 4 cm in<br>
length) to assist in placement of the minimally invasive probes (E-field and<br>
temperature). The cut-outs also allow improved air flow to cool the skin.<br>
[069] Based upon the results from these recent microwave hyperthermia clinical<br>
tests with adaptive microwave phased array treatment, Applicants recognized, in<br>
living breast tissue compressed to 4.5 to 6.5 cm, that a microwave energy dose of<br>
between 138 kJ (kilojoules or equivalently kW seconds) and 192 kJ produces an<br>
equivalent thermal dose ranging from 24.5 minutes to 67.1 minutes relative to 43° C<br>
as listed below in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Table 1. Equivalent thermal dose (minutes) and total microwave energy (kilojoules)<br>
delivered in the four compressed living breast tissue tests.<br>
[070] Thus, the Total Microwave Energy Dose can be used to estimate the required<br>
heating time. That is, Applicants realized that a non-invasive equivalent temperature<br>
sensing means could replace the invasive temperature probes, and that the Total<br>
Microwave Energy Dose reliably could be used to control the duration of treatment.<br>
In Table 1, the average thermal dose is 45.1 minutes and the average Total<br>
Microwave Energy is 169.5 kJ. In these four tests, the maximum energy value (192.0<br>
kJ) varies by only 13% from the average and the minimum energy value (138.0 kJ)<br>
varies by only 14% from the average. The breast compression used in these tests, as<br>
mentioned earlier, reduces blood flow which likely eliminates the effects of blood<br>
flow on the required microwave energy for treatment, and may help explain the small<br>
variation in energy required in these tests. Applicants also recognized that post<br>
treatment imaging of these four tests typically showed significant damage to the<br>
tumor, but little or no damage to the skin, breast fat, and normal glandular, ductal,<br>
and connective tissues.<br>
[071] Accordingly to a preferred embodiment of the method, the total microwave<br>
energy delivered to the waveguide applicators to determine completion of the<br>
treatment is between 25 kilojoules and 250 kilojoules. The total amount of<br>
microwave energy dose that would destroy any cancerous or precancerous tissue<br>
would be approximately 175 kilojoules. But, under certain conditions, the required<br>
microwave energy dose may be as low as 25 kilojoules. In another embodiment<br>
according to the invention, higher microwave energy doses up to 400 kilojoules may<br>
be employed to completely destroy cancerous tumor cells.<br>
[072] Table 2 below lists the breast tissue compression thickness for the four tests.<br>
It should be noted that the smallest compression thickness (4.5 cm) corresponds to the<br>
smallest energy dose (138 kJ) delivered, with both occurring in Test 4. As applicants<br>
recognized and will be proven theoretically below, smaller compression thickness<br><br><br>
may require less microwave energy aose (compared to larger compression thickness)<br>
for effective treatments in preventing or destroying cancerous, pre-cancerous or<br>
benign lesions.<br><br>
Table 2. Breast compression thickness for the four compressed living breast tissue<br>
tests.<br>
[073] From these clinical studies, it becomes apparent that it is important to select<br>
an appropriate initial microwave power level (Pi^2) delivered to each applicator as<br>
well as the proper microwave phase between the two applicators to focus the energy<br>
at the area to be treated. From the compressed breast experiments, the following data<br>
was obtained for the four tests as listed in Table 3:<br>
Initial Microwave Relative Microwave<br>
Powers P1 ,P2 (W) Phase (deg)<br><br>
Table 3. Initial microwave power and initial microwave phase to focus the radiation<br>
in compressed living breast tissue.<br>
[074] As can be seen from Tables 1 and 3, initial microwave power of 30 to 40<br>
watts for each applicator was sufficient to achieve significant thermal doses. Further,<br>
the initial relative microwave phase between the applicators varied from -10<br>
electrical degrees to -180 electrical degrees and does not follow any definite trend,<br>
proving that it is necessary to always focus the microwave radiation with an E-field<br><br>
sensor.<br>
[075] For comparable compression thickness, 6.5 and 6.0 cm in Tests 2 and 3,<br>
respectively, the microwave power level was held constant for the first few minutes<br>
of the treatments in order to determine the linear temperature rise in the tumor- this<br>
in effect provides a measurement of the SAR. It was found for 30 watts of power,<br>
that it took 2.5 minutes to achieve a one-degree C temperature rise in the tumor. For<br>
40 watts of power, it took only 1.5 minutes to achieve a one-degree C temperature<br>
rise.<br>
[076] During hyperthermia treatment, it is necessary to monitor the skin<br>
temperatures so that they do not rise significantly above about 41 degrees Celsius for<br>
more than several minutes. The equivalent thermal dose for the skin can be<br>
calculated (Sapareto, et al., International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology<br>
Physics, Vol. 10, pp. 787-800,1984) and can be used as a feedback signal. Typically,<br>
it is necessary to avoid delivering more than a few equivalent minutes thermal dose.<br>
Avoiding high skin temperatures according to the invention is accomplished by<br>
adjusting the individual powers (P1, P2) delivered to the applicators during treatment<br>
either by manual or automatic computer control.<br><br>
[077] Applicants recognize that Doppler ultrasound can be used to measure blood<br>
flow in tumors and surrounding breast tissue, before and during treatment to plan and<br>
adjust the microwave energy dose. For example, less energy dose is required when<br>
the tumor blood flow rate is reduced which can occur when the breast is compressed<br>
and/or the tumor is heated to therapeutic temperatures. Alternatively, the water<br>
content and dielectric parameters of breast tumor tissue from needle biopsies could be<br>
measured and used to determine, prior to the treatment, the required microwave<br>
energy dose. For example, higher water content and higher electrical conductivity in<br>
the tumor would reduce the amount of required microwave energy dose. In addition<br>
to the above variables, the size of the tumor impacts the required microwave energy<br>
dose. Larger tumors are more difficult to heat than smaller tumors and require a<br>
larger microwave energy dose. An initial treatment planning session involving a low-<br>
dose delivery of microwave energy to assess the heatability of the tumor, followed by<br>
a complete treatment at the full required microwave energy dose may be performed.<br>
Simplified Microwave Radiation Theory<br>
[078] Microwave energy from hyperthermia applicators, in the near field of a body,<br>
radiates, as a spherical wave with the electric-field amplitude varying, in part, as the<br>
inverse of the radial distance r from the applicator. Additionally, the amplitude<br>
decays as an exponential function of the product of the attenuation constant or of the<br>
body tissue and the distance d traversed (or depth) within the body. The electric-field<br>
phase varies linearly with distance according to the product of the phase propagation<br>
constant  and distance d. For simplicity, dual-opposing applicators are analyzed<br>
here under the assumption that the applicator radiation is approximated by a plane<br>
wave. Mathematically, the plane-wave electric field versus depth in tissue is given by<br>
E(d)=E0 exp(-d) exp(-id), where E0 is the surface electric field (in general<br>
represented by an amplitude and phase angle), / is the imaginary number (Field and<br>
Hand, An Introduction to the Practical Aspects of Clinical Hyperthermia, Taylor &amp;<br>
Francis, New York p. 263, 1990).<br>
[079] Plane-wave electromagnetic energy, at the microwave frequency of 915 MHz,<br>
attenuates at a rate of about 3 dB per cm in high-water content tissue, such as ductal<br>
or glandular breast tumor, and about 1 dB per cm in normal breast tissue. Thus, a<br>
single radiating applicator has a significant fraction of its microwave energy absorbed<br><br>
by intervening superficial body tissue compared to the energy that irradiates deep<br>
tissue, likely creating a hot spot in superficial tissue. Since skin surface cooling with<br>
either air or water protects tissue only to a maximum depth of about 0.25 to 0.5 cm, in<br>
order to avoid hot spots, it is necessary to introduce a second phase-coherent<br>
applicator, having the same microwave radiation amplitude as the first applicator.<br>
The second phase-coherent applicator can theoretically increase the power (and hence<br>
the energy) delivered to deep tissue by a factor of four compared to a single applicator<br>
(Field and Hand, p. 290,1990).<br>
[080] The phase characteristics of the electromagnetic radiation from two or more<br>
applicators (known as a phased array) can have a pronounced affect on the<br>
distribution of power delivered to different tissues. The relative specific absorption<br>
rate (S AR) in homogeneous tissue is approximated by the square of the electric-field<br>
amplitude |E|2. The SAR is proportional to the rise in temperature over a given time<br>
interval. A simplified case, homogeneous breast tissue, in which the microwave<br>
radiation is focused at a central tissue site is described in detail below. As described<br>
in article by Fenn et al., International Symposium on Electromagnetic Compatibility,<br>
Sendai, Japan, Vol. 10, No. 2, May 17-19, 1994, pp. 566-569, 1994, the effects of<br>
multiple microwave signal reflections within the breast phantom can be ignored.<br>
[081] The wavelength in homogeneous normal breast tissue (with approximate<br>
dielectric constant 12.5 and electrical conductivity 0.21 S/m (values averaged from<br>
Chaudhary et al., 1984, Joines et al., 1994) is approximately 9.0 cm at 915 MHz, and<br>
the microwave loss is (1 dB/cm). The attenuation constant  is 0.11 radians/cm and<br>
the propagation constant  is 0.69 radians/cm. (For a phantom thickness of 4.5 cm,<br>
the electric field of a single applicator radiating on the left side is E0 at the surface,<br>
-i0.8Eo (where i represents a 90-degree phase shift) at the central position (2.25 cm<br>
deep)., and -0.6Eo at the right surface. Combining two phase coherent applicators<br>
yields an electric-field value of 0.4Eo on both surfaces and -i1.6E0 at the central<br>
position (2.25 cm depth). Thus, for breast that there is a significantly lower SAR at<br>
the surface, by a factor of 16 compared to the central SAR. The 180-degree phase<br>
shift experienced by the microwave field transmitted through 4.5 cm of breast tissue,<br>
partly cancels or nulls the field entering the tissue with 0-degree phase shift. Due to<br>
destructive interference of the microwaves away from the central focus lower<br><br>
temperatures in the superficial breast tissues would be expected. Measurement and<br>
enforcement of lower SAR on the opposing skin surfaces effectively focuses the<br>
microwave energy deep in the breast.<br>
[082] The adaptive phased array system according to the invention uses two<br>
microwave channels, fed by a common oscillator 105, containing two electronically<br>
adjustable phase shifters 120 to focus the microwave energy at an E-field feedback<br>
probe 175. This inventive adaptive phased array system has significant advantage<br>
over a non-adaptive phased array. A non-adaptive phased array with two channels<br>
could, in theory, produce a null, a maximum, or an intermediate value of E-field<br>
depending on whether the two waves are 180 degrees out-of-phase, completely in-<br>
phase, or partly out-of-phase, respectively. That is, the microwave phase delivered to<br>
the microwave applicators, according to the invention, can be adjusted between -180<br>
degrees and 180 degrees before and during the treatment to create a focused field in<br>
the breast tissue.<br>
[083] Because the adaptive phased array according to the invention automatically<br>
focuses the E-field in the presence of all scattering structures in the tissue, this type of<br>
array should provide more reliable deep focused heating compared to manually<br>
adjusted or pre-treatment planning controlled phased arrays as described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,589,423 to Turner. Furthermore, the adaptive phased array system<br>
according to the preferred embodiment of the invention does not use an invasive<br>
metallic temperature probe which could scatter or alter the E-field at the tumor site.<br>
Calculation of Microwave Energy<br>
[084] Electrical energy consumption is commonly expressed in units of kilowatt<br>
hours. Mathematically, the expression for the microwave energy W delivered by an<br>
applicator is given by (Vitrogan, Elements of Electric and Magnetic Circuits,<br>
Rinehart Press, San Francisco, pp. 31-34, 1971):<br><br>
In the above equation, ∆t represents the constant intervals (in seconds) in which<br>
microwave power is measured and the summation ∑ is over the complete treatment<br>
interval with the power (in Watts) in the ith interval denoted by Pi<br>
[085] The microwave energy W has units of watt-seconds, which is also designated<br>
as Joules. For example, in three consecutive 60-second intervals if the microwave<br><br>
power is 30 watts, 50 watts, 60 watts, respectively, the total microwave energy<br>
delivered in 180 seconds is calculated as W= 60 (30 + 50 + 60) = 8,400 watt-seconds<br>
= 8,400 Joules - 8.4 kJ.<br>
[086] To understand better the focused energy per unit time W' (where ' denotes<br>
prime) deposited at a central position in homogeneous breast tissue of varying<br>
thickness (denoted by D) by dual-opposing applicators, consider the following<br>
calculation. Let P1 and P2 be the power delivered to the two applicators, respectively.<br>
The electric field radiated by each applicator is proportional to the square root of the<br>
power delivered to the applicator. Assuming symmetry, the radiated fields are in-<br>
phase at the central focused position from the two applicators. Assuming equal<br>
power from each applicator, that is, P1 = P2 = P, and plane wave illumination, then the<br>
focused energy per unit time at the central depth is expressed as<br>
W'(D) = |E|2 = 4P exp(-D) .	(2)<br>
Equation (2) was used to compute the focused 915 MHz energy per unit time at the<br>
central depth of normal breast tissue varying in thickness from 4 cm to 8 cm with the<br>
attenuation constant equal to 0.11 radians/cm, as shown in Table 4 and Figure 7.<br>
Compression	Relative Energy<br>
Thickness (cm)	at Focus<br>

4.25	0.626<br>

4.75	0.592<br>

Table 4. Relative microwave energy at a central focus in simulated<br>
normal breast tissue for dual-opposing 915 MHz plane waves.<br>
[087] For a given power level, higher energy occurs at the focus as the focal position<br>
moves towards the skin.<br>
Calculation of Equivalent Thermal Dose<br>
[088] The cumulative or total equivalent thermal dose relative to 43 degrees Celsius<br>
is calculated as a summation (Sapareto, et al., International Journal of Radiation<br>
Oncology Biology Physics, Vol. 10, pp. 787-800, 1984):<br>
t430c equivalent minutes = AtIR(4i-T), (3)<br>
where E is the summation over a series of temperature measurements during the<br>
treatment, T is the series of temperature measurements (T1, T2, T3, ...), ∆t is the<br>
constant interval of time (units of seconds and converted to minutes) between<br>
measurements, R is equal to 0.5 if 7&gt;43° C and R is equal to 0.25 if T
equivalent thermal dose calculation is useful for assessing any possible heat damage<br>
to the breast tissues and skin.<br>
Detailed Microwave Specific Absorption Rate Calculations in Simulated Breast<br>
Tissue<br>
[089] To estimate the heating pattern in normal breast tissue and in normal breast<br>
tissue with tumor exposed to microwave radiation, three-dimensional specific<br>
absorption rate (SAR) heating patterns were calculated using finite-difference time-<br>
domain theory and computer simulations (Taflove, Computational Electrodynamics:<br>
The finite-difference time-domain method, Artech House, Inc., Norwood,<br>
Massachusetts, p. 642, 1995). As depicted in Figure 7, these simulations were<br>
performed by modeling dual-opposing TEM-2 waveguide applicators (Celsion Corp.,<br>
Columbia, Maryland) operating at 915 MHz. The applicators were coherently<br>
combined to focus the radiated beam at the central position in 6 cm thick<br>
homogeneous normal (mixture of fat and glandular) breast tissue. The applicators are<br><br>
assumed to radiate through thin sheets of plexiglass that simulate the plates used for<br>
breast compression in the adaptive phased array breast hyperthermia system.<br>
[090] Each metallic waveguide is loaded on the side walls with high dielectric<br>
constant material, which is used to match and shape the radiation inside the<br>
waveguide aperture. The waveguide applicators are linearly polarized with the<br>
alignment of the E-field in they direction as in Figure 8. A flat sheet of 3 mm thick<br>
plexiglass is adjacent to each applicator and parallel to the waveguide aperture.<br>
Between the two opposing TEM-2 applicators is a 6 cm thick homogeneous normal<br>
breast tissue phantom. The remaining volume is filled with cubic cells that model air.<br>
[091 ] The SAR distributions were calculated by squaring the electric field amplitude<br>
and multiplying by the electrical conductivity of the tissue. SAR is often described in<br>
levels (50% is usually designated as the effective heating zone) relative to the<br>
maximum SAR value of 100%. The SAR is proportional to the initial rise in<br>
temperature per unit time ignoring blood flow and thermal conduction effects.<br>
[092] The SAR patterns were computed in the three principal planes (xy, xz, yz) as<br>
shown in Figures 9 to 13 for homogeneous normal breast tissue. The SAR side view<br>
(xy plane, z=0) pattern (75% uid 50% contours) in homogenous normal breast tissue<br>
is shown in Figure 9. The pattern generally is bell shaped and centered between the<br>
TEM-2 applicators. Figure 10 shows the top view (xz plane,y=0) SAR pattern (75%<br>
and 50% contours). The pattern exhibits a small elliptically shaped 75% SAR region<br>
surrounded by a three-lobe shaped elliptical 50% SAR region. The small size of the<br>
75% SAR is due to the mode shape of the radiated electric field for this type of<br>
applicator. Figure 11 shows the end view (yz plane, x=0) of the SAR pattern (75%<br>
and 50% contours). The pattern exhibits a small circularly shaped 75% SAR region<br>
surrounded by a three-lobe shaped elliptical 50% SAR region approximately the size<br>
of the waveguide aperture.<br>
[093] The results shown in Figures 9 to 11 show that a large volume of deep breast<br>
tissues can be heated by the adaptive phased array with TEM-2 waveguide<br>
applicators, whereas the superficial tissues are not substantially heated. Any high-<br>
water content tissues exposed to this large heating field will be preferentially heated<br>
compared to the surrounding normal breast tissue. To demonstrate selective<br><br>
(preferential) heating, two spherically shaped 1.5-cm diameter simulated tumors<br>
(dielectric constant 58.6, electrical conductivity 1.05 S/m) were embedded in the<br>
normal breast tissue with 5-cm spacing and the FDTD calculation for the top view is<br>
shown in Figure 12. Comparing this result with Figure 10, it is clear that the SAR<br>
pattern has changed significantly and the two high-water content tumor regions are<br>
selectively heated. To show the sharpness of the selective heating, the calculated<br>
SAR pattern along the z axis at x=0 cm is shown in Figure 13. There is a sharp peak<br>
located at the positions of the two tumors, again demonstrating selective heating of<br>
high-water content carcinoma compared to the surrounding normal breast tissue.<br>
Similar results would be expected for benign breast lesions such as fibroadenomas<br>
and cysts.<br>
[094] Figure 14 shows the externally focused adaptive phased array thermotherapy<br>
system od Figure 5 with two of the safety methods applied to the waveguide<br>
applicators 100. In the preferred embodiment, a thin metallic shielding strip 605 of<br>
width 1 to 2 cm covers the top section of the rectangular waveguide aperture 600 to<br>
block stray radiation from reaching the base of the breast near the chest wall region.<br>
A thin microwave absorbing pad 610 (for example, 0.125-inch thick Cuming<br>
Microwave Corporation MT-30 sheet absorber, attenuation 40 dB/inch) covers the<br>
entire top surface of the waveguide applicator 100 (for example, Celsion Corporation<br>
TEM2 waveguide applicator). The microwave absorbing pad 610 can attenuate or<br>
suppress any microwave surface currents that could reradiate microwave energy<br>
toward the base of the breast and chest wall region. The microwave-absorbing pad<br>
610 is glued or otherwise attached to the top surface of the waveguide applicator.<br>
[095] Figure 15 shows a side view of the externally focused adaptive phased array<br>
thermotherapy applicators 100 with breast compression plates (paddles) 200 on either<br>
side of a simple T-shaped breast phantom 700 that is used to simulate the breast for<br>
microwave heating experiments. The applicators 100 have pads 610 and microwave<br>
shielding strip 605 with additional insulating pads 620 placed between compression<br>
plate 200 and the phantom T 700 representing the chest wall or muscle supporting the<br>
breast tissue. A T-shaped phantom enclosure is fabricated preferably from plexiglass<br>
or other plastic material and is part of compression plates 200. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the upper "T" section of compression plates 200 extends between pad<br><br>
610 and pad 620 for a distance, as shown in Figure 15. The upper section of the T-<br>
shaped breast phantom 700 contains muscle equivalent phantom tissue (M. Gauthrie,<br>
editor: Methods of External Hyperthermic Heating, Springer Verlag, p. 11 (Chou<br>
formulation), 1990) and the lower section contains fatty dough breast equivalent<br>
phantom tissue (J.J. W. Lagendijk and P. Nilsson, "Hyperthermia Dough: A Fat and<br>
Bone Equivalent Phantom to Test Microwave/Radiofrequency Hyperthermia Heating<br>
Systems," Physics in Medicine and Biology, Vol. 30, No. 7, pp. 709-712, 1985).<br>
Pad 620 is soft for comfort and contains microwave-absorbing material to reduce<br>
stray microwave energy.<br>
[096] Applicators 100 are designed so that a gap region 635 is provided between the<br>
applicator and the breast tissue. Gap region 635 allows airflow from external air<br>
tubes or fans that are pointed into the gap to cool the region in proximity to the base<br>
of each side of the breast and chest wall region. In a preferred embodiment, plastic<br>
air tubes with flared or conical shaped nozzles, such as those manufactured by<br>
Lockwood Products, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR may be used to guide airflow into gap<br>
region 635 to cool the breast region.<br>
[097] In a preferred embodiment, a fiber optic temperature sensor probe 415 and an<br>
E-field microwave-focusing probe 175 are parallel to one another and co-located<br>
within a single catheter. The tip of the fiber optic temperature sensor is positioned<br>
within the tumor site or focus position 190 and the E-field focusing probe 175 is<br>
located at the same depth of the tumor as measured between the compression plates.<br>
The fiber optic temperature sensor in the tumor can be of the fluroroptic type is non-<br>
metallic and does not interfere with the microwave energy (M. Gauthrie, editor:<br>
Methods of External Hyperthermic Heating, Springer Verlag, p. 119, 1990). The<br>
metallic E-field focusing probe 175 consists of very thin metallic coaxial cable 0.020<br>
inches diameter (UT-20). The tip section of the E-field focusing probe 175 consists<br>
of the center pin of the coaxial cable extending approximately 1 cm beyond the outer<br>
jacket of the coaxial cable. The tip of the E-field focusing probe is positioned<br>
approximately 0.5 cm from the tip of the fiber optic temperature sensor.<br>
[098] Figure 16 shows a more realistically shaped breast phantom 710 in which the<br>
breast is curved. For this phantom, the curved breast portion can be fabricated using<br>
a plastic bag (polyethylene) filled with a compressible fat phantom material<br><br>
conforming to the shape of a breast. Compressible ultrasound breast imaging<br>
phantoms can also be used for microwave experiments. In Figure 16, the positions<br>
labeled 7 and 8 are on the skin surface close to the base of the breast near the chest<br>
wall region. Further, as this diagram illustrates, a portion (lower portion below the<br>
skin entry point) of the metallic coaxial E-field focusing probe 175 is not shielded by<br>
the breast tissue and is directly exposed to the microwave energy radiated by the two<br>
waveguide applicators 100. The microwave energy can possibly overheat the<br>
exposed metallic coaxial cable resulting in a skin bum where the E-field focusing<br>
probe enters the skin. In such a case, it is desirable to remove the E-field focusing<br>
probe 175 after the microwave focusing procedure is completed prior to heating the<br>
breast. The preferred E-field focusing probe 175 is a coaxial cable with the center pin<br>
extended to form a monopole antenna. However, the focusing probe can also be<br>
fabricated using a monopole or dipole antenna connected to parallel transmission<br>
lines of either metallic or carbon material. Alternatively, the focusing probe can be a<br>
monopole or dipole antenna with a microwave to optical converter connected to a<br>
fiber optic cable to avoid metallic heating effects at the skin entry point. The optical<br>
modulator may be a Mach Zehnder modulator, for example.<br>
[099] Figure 17 shows a detailed three-dimensional view of the improved safety<br>
method with compression plate 200 and pad 620. The compression plate edge 210 is<br>
a potential source for damage to the skin as a right angle is formed by the vertical and<br>
horizontal surfaces of the plate and the edge is adjacent the chest wall and breast<br>
tissue. Accordingly, microwave-absorbing pad 620 is disposed between edge 210 and<br>
the chest wall. The microwave-absorbing pad 620 serves two purposes. First, the pad<br>
contains a soft foam material and cushions the breast skin from abrasion or pressure<br>
as the breast is compressed against the compression plate edge 210. Second, the pad<br>
contains microwave-absorbing material to attenuate any stray microwave radiation<br>
from the applicators 100 that might overheat nearby tissue. The compression plate<br>
200 or paddle may contain one or more rectangular openings 205 to allow an<br>
ultrasound transducer to touch the skin for imaging the breast tissue while the E-field<br>
focusing probe and temperature probe are inserted in the breast tumor region. In<br>
another embodiment according to the invention, Figure 18 shows a side view of the<br>
waveguide applicators 100 and compression plates 200 with metallic shielding strips<br><br>
615 glued or otherwise attached to the surface of the compression plates 200 facing<br>
away from the breast skin.<br>
Shielding Experiment Results<br>
[100] As discussed above, Figure 15 shows the geometry of externally focused<br>
adaptive phased array microwave thermotherapy for breast tumor treatment. In<br>
testing, two Celsion Corporation TEM-2 microwave applicators radiating at 915 MHz<br>
were used to induce thermotherapy. For simplicity, the patient tissue is represented<br>
by a phantom consisting of a T-shaped plexiglass box containing simulated breast<br>
tissue in the lower portion and simulated muscle tissue in the upper portion.<br>
Additionally, a simulated breast tumor consisting of muscle phantom tissue<br>
(approximately 1.5 cm diameter) was located at position 1. Seven temperature probes<br>
(designated #1 to #7) were used in these experiments. Probe 1 was a fiberoptic<br>
temperature probe and the remaining probes were thermocouple probes that rest<br>
outside the simulated skin of the breast tissue. Probe 1 was positioned at the desired<br>
focus site 190 where the simulated tumor position is located. Probes 2 and 3 were<br>
located at the top comer of the compression paddles outside of the primary<br>
microwave field. Probes 4 and 5 were located in the center of the microwave field<br>
where the maximum field strength exists. Probes 6 and 7 were located above probes<br>
4 and 5 where a lower field strength would be expected. An E-field focusing probe<br>
175 was also placed at the same depth as Probe position 1 to focus the microwave<br>
energy. The E-field focusing probe 175 and fiber optic temperature probe 1 were<br>
inserted within a common catheter (Teflon, 1.65mm outer diameter).<br>
[101] Two experiments were conducted in which the microwave power to each<br>
channel was 70 Watts and the phase shifters in the array were adaptively focused to<br>
central probe position #1 in a 6 cm thick breast phantom. In the first experiment, no<br>
microwave absorbers or metallic shielding was used, as shown in Figure 5. In the<br>
second experiment, microwave absorbing pads and a metallic strip shield covering<br>
the top portion (2 cm) of the aperture was used as depicted in Figure 15. In each<br>
experiment, the initial temperature slope (degrees per minute) for each measurement<br>
sensor was calculated for the first 30-seconds of heating.<br><br><br>
Table 5. Measured temperature slopes for no absorber and no shielding.<br>
[102] The chest wall surface sites heat faster than the simulated tumor position.<br>
This is graphically shown in Figure 19.<br><br>
Table 6 Measured temperature slopes with absorber on top of the breast compression<br>
plate and on top of waveguide applicator and shielding covering the top section of the<br>
applicators.<br>
[103] As the results in Table 6 show the simulated tumor site heats significantly<br>
faster than the surface sites including that of the chest wall region. This is illustrated<br>
graphically in Figure 20.<br><br>
Accordingly, with the safety improvements, the tumor heated more rapidly and the<br>
temperature slopes for sensor positions 2 and 3 are one half those when the safety<br>
improvements are not used. The thermal results for these two experiments clearly<br>
show the effectiveness of the microwave absorber pads and metallic shielding strip<br>
covering the top section of the waveguide applicator in reducing the surface heating<br>
near the chest wall. The temperature slopes for sensor positions 4 and 5 increased<br>
with the safety improvements, but were still at least a factor of two lower than the<br>
tumor temperature slope. Additional airflow and cooled air could help to further<br>
reduce the surface heating.<br>
[104] In addition to the above-described microwave embodiment, applicants<br>
envision that other embodiments may employ any type of focused energy including<br>
electromagnetic, ultrasound, radio frequency, laser or other focused energy source<br>
that is known to those skilled in the art. That is, any energy or combination of<br>
different energies that can be focused to heat and ablate an area of tissue may be<br>
employed in the method according to Applicants' invention. While the focused energy<br>
may be the primary heating source, it may be combined with an injection of substance<br>
that increases or enhances heating at the target area (tumor). The substance may be<br>
saline water or water mixed with a metal or other electrical conducting substance,<br>
such as a metallic surgical breast clip so that the substance enhances the amount of<br>
heat delivered to the target area.<br>
[105] Since the injected substance enhances heating of the target area, this is an<br>
alternative method of obtaining selective heating of the target area. Consequently,<br>
Applicants envision that non-focused energy when combined with an injection of<br>
saline water or water mixed with metal would sufficiently heat the targeted area to<br>
ablate cancerous cells and/or benign cells. Thus, the energy applicator employed in<br>
this embodiment could be an applicator that delivers non-focused energy. In such an<br>
embodiment using only non-focused energy according to the invention, an E-field<br>
probe would not be necessary.<br>
[106] While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference<br>
 to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For instance,<br><br>
although the hyperthermia system described herein is with respect to the treatment of<br>
breast carcinomas and benign breast lesions, the invention is applicable to the<br>
treatment of other types of cancers such as prostate, liver, lung, and ovarian as well as<br>
benign disease such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Similarly, it is<br>
understood that the safety methods disclosed here can be applied to microwave or<br>
radiofrequency thermotherapy treatments of other appendages and portions of the<br>
human body such as legs and arms and the torso. [ 107] It is also understood that<br>
larger or smaller numbers of array antenna applicators, or a single antenna applicator,<br>
may be used with similar results. Furthermore, the methods disclosed here can be<br>
used with non-coherent multiple-applicator treatment systems - in a non-coherent<br>
system, a field focusing probe would not be necessary. In situations where<br>
compression of the breast or other organ is not desired or appropriate, the<br>
compression step can be omitted. If the compression step is not used, then the<br>
absorbing pads and other metallic shielding features may not be employed. Some of<br>
the methods and techniques described herein are also applicable to ultrasound<br>
hyperthermia system particularly the use of energy dose for feedback control. The<br>
method can be used to enhance radiation therapy or for targeted drug delivery using<br>
thermosensitive liposomes and/or targeted gene delivery. The invention is also<br>
applicable to non-medical hyperthermia systems, such as those used for heating of<br>
industrial or food materials.<br><br><br>
