				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MODEL <br>
BASED SHROUDED BELLOWS STIFFNESS<br>
DETERMINATIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to shrouded bellows and, more<br>
particularly, to modeling techniques used to predict natural frequency responses in<br>
tube systems that include shrouded bellows.<br>
Shrouded bellows or sealed ball joints are often used in gas turbine<br>
engine ducting systems to connect adjacent sections of fluid carrying tubing which<br>
require articulation therebetween. The shrouded bellows provide a flexible joint that<br>
prevents leakage of the fluid flowing therethrough despite potential movement<br>
between the adjacent sections of tubing. Such movement can be for example, caused<br>
as a result of thermal growth in the ducting system during engine operation.<br>
Shrouded bellows are typically located in various locations within and<br>
around the engine. To design shrouded bellows and associated hardware to withstand<br>
High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) stresses, modeling techniques are used to predict natural<br>
frequency responses in the ducting systems including the shrouded bellows<br>
components. Known modeling techniques use analytical models that approximate<br>
shrouded bellows natural frequency response with manufacturer-supplied test data.<br>
Such test data is typically obtained from static stiffness component testing. The<br>
analytical models incorporate static stiffness data by assigning a spring constant to<br>
various spring elements used to represent the shrouded bellows within the analytical<br>
models. The spring elements provide the bellows stiffness input for an analytical<br>
determination of the system natural frequency response. Because the shrouded<br>
bellows natural frequency response is based on static stiffness test data, the ability of<br>
the analytical models to accurately estimate the natural frequency response of<br>
shrouded bellows is potentially limited.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, a modeling system accurately predicts<br>
natural frequency responses in tube sub-systems that include shrouded bellows<br>
components. The modeling system characterizes the shrouded bellows using a<br>
standard geometry element that includes an assigned stiffness multiplier based on<br>
dynamic stiffness component data rather than static stiffness component test data. In<br>
the exemplary embodiment, the modeling system characterizes the shrouded bellows<br>
using a standard geometry eJement that is a tube element that includes an applied<br>
flexibility factor, and the modeling system determines the flexibility factor using<br>
regression techniques. An exemplary regression equation accounts for tube system<br>
diameter, bellows pitch, system operating pressure, and dynamic system operating<br>
input. The modeling system facilitates accurate predictions of natural frequency<br>
responses in tube sub-systems that include shrouded bellows components in a cost<br>
effective and reliable manner.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br><br>
Figure i is a front schematic illustration of a tube sub-system including<br>
a plurality of shrouded bellows;<br>
Figure 2 is a partially cut-away side view of a shrouded bellow used<br>
with the tube sub-system shown in Figure 1; and<br>
Figure 3 is a flowchart of a method for modeling natural frequency<br>
responses in tube sub-systems such as the tube sub-system shown in Figure 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 is a front schematic illustration of a tube sub-system 10<br>
including &amp; plurality of shrouded bellows 12. Tube sub-system 10 is attached radially<br>
outwardly from a gas turbine engine 14 with a plurality of rod end links 16. Rod end<br>
links 16 extend radially outward from an outer surface 20 of an engine casing 22,<br>
Each rod end link 16 includes a circular strap 24 for securing to tube sub-system 10.<br>
Tube sub-system 10 includes a plurality of tubing sections 30<br>
connected together to form a flow passageway. Each rod link strap 24 secures to one<br>
of tubing sections 30 and secures such tubing section 30 to engine casing 22. Each<br>
shrouded bellow 12, described in more detail below, is connected in flow<br>
communication between adjacent tubing sections 30 and provides a flexible joint that<br>
has substantially leak-proof angulation between adjacent sections of tubing 30.<br>
Furthermore, bellows 12 provide flexibility for tube sub-system 10 which may be<br>
required in order to physically deflect tubing sections 30 so as to improve installation<br>
ease with other components (not shown) of engine 14 and to accommodate thermal<br>
growth of tubing sections 30 during engine operation.<br>
Figure 2 is a partially cut-away side view of shrouded bellows 12 used<br>
to join a first tube 34 in flow communication with a second tube 36. Shrouded<br>
bellows 12 prevents leakage of fluid between adjacent tubes 34 and 36 while<br>
providing pivotal or articulated movement between tubes 34 and 36. First tube 34 has<br>
a first diameter 37 and second tube 36 has a second diameter 38.<br>
Shrouded bellow 12 includes a tubular outer shroud 40 which<br>
surrounds in part a coaxial tubular inner shroud 42. Outer shroud 40 is one piece and<br>
includes at a first end 44, an integral cylindrical sleeve 46 for attaching to first tube<br>
34. Shroud 40 also includes at a second end 48, an integral spherical concave annulus<br>
50.<br>
Inner shroud 42 includes at a first end 52 a cylindrical sleeve 54 for<br>
attaching to second tube 36. Shroud 42 includes at a second end 56 an integral<br>
spherical convex annulus 58. An outer diameter (not shown) of convex annulus 58 is<br>
approximately equal an inner diameter (not shown) of concave annulus 50 such that<br>
inner shroud convex annulus 58 is in slidable contact with outer shroud concave<br>
annulus 50.<br>
A tubular bellows 74 is coaxial with a center axis of inner and outer<br>
shrouds (not shown). Bellows 74 is between inner shxoud 42 and a bellows liner 75,<br>
permitting first and second pieces of tubing 34 and 36, respectively, to sealingly join<br>
while permitting limited pivotal movement therebetween. Bellows 74 include a<br>
plurality of axially spaced apart convolutions 76 that provide a flexible seal between<br>
inner and outer shrouds 42 and 40, respectively. Corresponding portions of adjacent<br>
convolutions 76 define a pitch 80 for bellows 74.<br>
Figure 3 is a flowchart 100 of a method for modeling natural frequency<br>
responses in tube sub-systems, such as tube sub-system 10 (shown in Figure 1), that<br>
include shrouded bellows 12 (shown in Figures 1 and 2). The method can be<br>
practiced on a computer (not shown), such as a personal computer or a workstation,<br>
including an interface (not shown), such as a keyboard and an a display, a processor,<br>
and a memory.<br>
Initially, input values are chosen 110 that are indicative of tube sub-<br>
system characteristics. More specifically, values for dynamic operating condition<br>
inputs 114 and shrouded bellows geometry inputs 116 arc selected. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment, dynamic operating condition inputs 114 include at least data<br>
representing an .operating pressure and vibratory environment of tube sub-system 10<br>
(shown in Figures 1 and 2) and shrouded bellows geometry inputs 116 include data<br>
representing bellows pitch 80 (shown in Figure 2) and bellows mating tube diameters<br>
37 and 38 (shown in Figure 2). Such inputs 114 and 116 are, for example, selected by<br>
an operator.<br>
A stiffness multiplier for tube sub-system 10 being analyzed is then<br>
determined 120. Instead of modeling shrouded bellows 12 (shown in Figures 1 and 2)<br>
as spring elements including an assigned spring constant that is based on static<br>
stiffness component test data, shrouded bellows 12 is characterized using a standard<br>
geometry element that includes an assigned stiffness multiplier based on dynamic<br>
stiffness component test data. The stiffness multiplier is a finite element input that<br>
may be selectively adjusted to customize a dynamic stiffness of a particular shrouded<br>
bellows element. The stiffness multiplier is determined 120 with a regression<br>
equation that accounts for tube sub-system diameter 37 and 38, system operating<br>
pressure, bellows pitch 80, and dynamic system operating inputs.<br>
The regression equation is based on dynamic stiffness test data obtained as a<br>
result of testing several different shrouded bellows configurations. Each different<br>
shrouded bellows configuration can be analytically modeled to determine a<br>
unique stiffness multiplier for that specific shrouded bellows configuration and to<br>
generate a tube sub-system analytical model. The stiffness multiplier regression<br>
equation may be used for a broad range of tube sub-system sizes and operating<br>
conditions reflective of the dynamic stiffness test data upon which the modeling<br>
was based. Within the tube sub-system analytical model, the appropriate<br>
stiffness multiplier is input 124 to the standard geometry bellows element.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, shrouded bellows 12 are characterized<br>
using a standard geometry element that is a tube element that includes a<br>
stiffness multiplier that is an applied flexibility factor. The flexibility factors were<br>
determined using an iterative scheme that optimized the flexibility factors by<br>
matching the natural frequency responses of the tube elements in a finite<br>
element analysis to the natural frequency responses of vibratory component<br>
tests. The flexibility factors assigned to the standard tube elements were varied<br>
incrementally until the analytical natural frequency response of the bellows<br>
element equaled the natural frequency response of the bellows test component.<br>
Fore example, in one embodiment, a three inch diameter shrouded bellows<br>
centered on a twelve inch cantilevered straight tube section (not shown) within a<br>
system pressurized to approximately 100 psia in an approximately constant 2g<br>
vibratory environment, produced a natural frequency response of 166 Hz. The<br>
test component was modeled using finite element analysis to determine that<br>
assigning a flexibility factor of approximately 0.328, enabled the analytical mode!<br>
to yield the same natural frequency response as the component test piece under<br>
the approximate same operating conditions.<br>
The tube sub-system analytical model is then solved 130 to determine or<br>
predict 132 a tube sub-system natural frequency response. As a result, because<br>
more accurate estimates of shrouded bellows dynamic response are facilitated,<br>
shrouded bellows tube sub-systems may be designed more reliably.<br>
In one embodiment, tube sub-system is a CF34-8 aircraft engine cooling system<br>
(not shown) available from the General Electric Aircraft Engines, Cincinnati, Ohio<br>
and the tube system natural frequency responses of the CF34-8 aircraft engine<br>
cooling system are predicted 132. A regression equation uses vibratory<br>
environment inputs 114, such as operating pressures, tube system diameters 37<br>
and 38, and bellows pitch information 80 to determine 120 flexibility factors for<br>
bellows elements 12 included in the CF34-8 aircraft engine duct system. The<br>
regression equation determines 120 the flexibility factors to be assigned to tube<br>
bellows elements. Solving the finite element analysis provides natural frequency<br>
response of the CF34-8 aircraft engine duct system for a specified engine<br>
vibratory environment. The resulting natural frequency response facilities<br>
determining locations for duct supports.<br>
The above-described modeling method is cost effective and accurate. The<br>
modeling method simulates and predicts a stiffness of shrouded bellows through<br>
the use of a regression equation. The regression equation, based on dynamic<br>
stiffness test data of a plurality of shrouded bellows configurations, permits the<br>
shrouded bellows to be characterized using a standard geometry element that<br>
includes an assigned stiffness multiplier based on the dynamic stiffness test data,<br>
As a result, the modeling method permits predictions of natural frequency<br>
responses in tube sub-systems that include shrouded bellows components in a<br>
cost effective and reliable manner.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of various specific<br>

practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims.<br>
