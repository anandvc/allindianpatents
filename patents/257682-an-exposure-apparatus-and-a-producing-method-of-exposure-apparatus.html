Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
An exposure apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showing a structure of the exposure apparatus of the embodiment. In the following description, an XYZ rectangular coordinate system shown in FIG 1 is set, and a positional relationship of various members will be explained with reference to the XYZ rectangular coordinate system. In the XYZ rectangular coordinate system, an X-axis and a Y-axis are in parallel to a plate P, and a Z-axis is perpendicular to the plate P. The XYZ coordinate system in the drawing, an X-Y plane is in parallel to a horizontal plane, and the Z-axis is oriented in the vertical direction. In this embodiment, a direction (scanning direction) in which the plate P (plate stage PST) is moved is in the X-axis direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the exposure apparatus includes an illumination optical system IL having a light source and an illumination optical system. The illumination optical system IL radiates luminous flux and allows illumination of a mask M formed with a predetermined pattern in a superposing manner. The luminous flux which passes through the pattern of the mask M forms a pattern image of the mask M on the plate P which is a photosensitive substrate having an outer diameter exceeding 500 mm through the projection optical system PL. Here, the outer diameter exceeding 500 mm means that one side or a diagonal line exceeds 500 mm. The mask M is placed on a mask stage MST in the X-Y plane. A plate P is placed on the plate stage (substrate stage) PST. The exposure apparatus moves the mask stage MST and the plate stage PST in synchronization with each other, and two dimensionally drives and<br><br>
controls the plate stage PST and in this state, the exposure apparatus carries out scanning exposure. With this, patterns of respective masks M are exposed on a plurality of exposure regions of the plate P. A plurality of flat panel display devices are formed on the plate P. In this embodiment, the illumination optical system IL, the mask stage MST and the projection optical system PL constitute an exposure body, but when an electronic mask (which is also called a variable shaping mask, and includes a DMD (Digital Micro-mirror Device) which is one kind of non-luminous image display elements (spatial light modulators) is used, the mask stage MST is unnecessary. The projection optical system PL may include a plurality of projection optical modules in which projection regions of pattern images are set in different positions at least in the Y-axis direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the exposure apparatus includes four vibration isolation systems (support members) 4a, 4b and 4c (see FIG. 2) on a base on which an exposure apparatus body is placed, and a vibration isolation system (vibration isolation system 4d, hereinafter) (not shown). FIG. 2 is a perspective view showing structures from the mask stage MST to the plate stage PST of the embodiment. In FIG. 2, the projection optical system PL is omitted.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the vibration isolation systems 4a and 4b are disposed on both ends of a lower pedestal 6a in its longitudinal direction. The lower pedestal 6a is disposed on the vibration isolation systems 4a and 4b. As shown in FIG 2, the vibration isolation systems 4c and 4d are disposed on both ends of the lower pedestal 6b in its longitudinal direction. The lower pedestal 6b is disposed on the vibration isolation systems 4c and 4d. The vibration isolation systems 4a to 4d can adjust torsion of later-described air guides 12a and 12b after the exposure apparatus is assembled. The lower pedestal 6a supported by the vibration isolation systems 4a and 4b is disposed such as to have a longitudinal direction of the lower pedestal 6a on the side of the -X direction and in a direction intersecting with a scanning direction of the<br><br>
plate stage PST (a predetermined direction, Y-axis direction in this embodiment). The lower pedestal 6b supported by the vibration isolation systems 4c and 4d is disposed such as to have a longitudinal direction of the lower pedestal 6b on the side of the +X direction and in a direction intersecting with the scanning direction of the plate stage PST (a predetermined direction). The lower pedestals 6a and 6b are separated in a direction intersecting with the longitudinal direction. In this embodiment, the lower pedestals 6a and 6b comprise two structure materials.

A linear motor stator 10a having a longitudinal direction on the side of the -Y direction and in the X direction is disposed on the lower pedestals 6a and 6b. A linear motor stator 10b having a longitudinal direction on the side of the +Y direction and in the X direction is disposed on the lower pedestals 6a and 6b.<br>
The surface plate 8 is disposed on the lower pedestals 6a and 6b.

A linear motor 16a which is an actuator of the plate stage PST in the scanning direction is connected to the air guide 14 on the side of the linear motor stator 10a. A linear motor 16b which is an actuator of the plate stage PST in the scanning direction is connected to the air guide 14 on the side of the linear motor stator 10b. Therefore, if the linear motors 16a and 16b are driven, the air guide 14 (and by extension, the plate stage PST) moves along the scanning direction. The plate stage PST is placed on the air guide 14. The plate P (not shown in FIG. 2) is adsorbed and held on the air guide 14 through a plate holder (not shown) on the plate<br><br>
stage PST. On the plate stage PST, a moving mirror 18a is provided on the -X direction and a moving mirror 18b is provided on the side of the linear motor stator 10b.

The plate stage interferometer 20a measures and control a position of the plate stage PST in the X-axis direction based on interference of laser beam reflected by the moving mirror 18a. The plate stage interferometer 20b measures and control a position of the plate stage PST in the Y-axis direction based on interference of laser beam reflected by the moving mirror 18b.<br>
The intermediate pedestal 22a is disposed on the lower pedestals 6a and 6b on the side of the -Y direction, and the intermediate pedestal 22b is disposed on the lower pedestals 6a and 6b on the side of the +Y direction. The intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b are connected to the lower pedestals 6a and 6b, and the intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b connects the lower pedestals 6a and 6b and the upper pedestal 26 with each other. The intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b are disposed such as to have longitudinal directions of the intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b in a direction intersecting with the longitudinal directions of the lower pedestals 6a and 6b (X-axis direction, direction intersecting with a predetermined direction). That is, the intermediate pedestal 22a is disposed such that the longitudinal direction of the intermediate pedestal 22a on the side of the -Y direction is in parallel to the scanning direction of the plate stage PST.

Next, the producing method of the exposure apparatus according to this embodiment will be explained. FIG 4 is a flowchart used for explaining the producing method of the exposure apparatus of the embodiment.<br>
First, the lower pedestals 6a and 6b on which the plate stage PST holding the plate P are disposed (step S10, lower pedestal disposing step).    More specifically, the lower<br><br>
pedestals 6a and 6b are disposed such as to have longitudinal directions thereof in a direction intersecting with the scanning direction of the plate stage PST (Y-axis direction).<br>
Next, the intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b are disposed on the lower pedestals 6a and 6b disposed in step S10 (step SI 1, intermediate pedestal disposing step). More specifically, the intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b are disposed such as to have longitudinal direction in the scanning direction (X-axis direction) of the plate stage PST, and the intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b and the lower pedestals 6a and 6b are connected to each other such that the longitudinal directions of the intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b and the longitudinal directions of the lower pedestals 6a and 6b intersect with each other. When connecting, they are fastened to each other through connecting members. Bolts may be used as the connecting members, or they may be adhered or welded to each other.<br>
The upper pedestal 26 on which the mask stage MST holding the mask M and the projection optical system PL are disposed is disposed on the intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b disposed in step Sll (step S12, upper pedestal disposing step). More specifically, the upper pedestal 26 is disposed such as to have longitudinal direction in a direction (Y-axis direction) intersecting with the scanning direction of the plate stage PST, and the upper pedestal 26 and the intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b are connected to each other such that the longitudinal direction of the upper pedestal 26 and the longitudinal directions of the intermediate pedestals 22a and 22b intersect with each other.<br>
The exposure apparatus of the embodiment includes two lower pedestals having longitudinal directions in a direction intersecting with the scanning direction of the plate stage, and includes two intermediate pedestals having longitudinal directions in a direction intersecting with the longitudinal direction of the lower pedestals. The exposure apparatus also includes an upper pedestal having longitudinal direction in a<br><br>
direction intersecting with the longitudinal direction of the intermediate pedestal. Therefore, the pedestal has such a size that the pedestal can be transported, and it is possible to provide an exposure apparatus having a large substrate stage on which a large photosensitive substrate exceeding 500 mm can be placed. The connection between the lower pedestal and the intermediate pedestal is provided with a connection spacer as a position-adjusting correcting member, the connection between the intermediate pedestal and the upper pedestal is provided with a correcting shim as a position-adjusting correcting member, and the connection between the pedestals is provided with the pressing reference surface. If the pedestal is divided into a plurality of parts, the assembling precision is deteriorated. However, according to the present invention, it is possible to prevent the assembling precision from being deteriorated, and to secure the high exposure precision. Thus, excellent exposing operation can be carried out by the exposure apparatus having high exposure precision. According to the producing method of the exposure apparatus of the embodiment, it is possible to produce an exposure apparatus in which the lower pedestal supporting the plate stage can be disposed, the intermediate pedestal can be disposed on the lower pedestal, and the upper pedestal supporting the mask M and the projection optical system can be disposed on the intermediate pedestal precisely, the exposure apparatus has a plurality of pedestals each having such a size that the pedestal can be transported, and the exposure can be carried out onto a large photosensitive substrate. Although the exposure apparatus of the embodiment includes two lower pedestals, the exposure apparatus may have three or more lower pedestals. In this case, at least two of the three or more lower pedestals are connected to the intermediate pedestal. The exposure apparatus may have only one lower pedestal. In this case, since the weight is increased as compared with an exposure apparatus having a plurality of lower pedestals, a honeycomb structure may be employed to reduce the weight of the lower pedestal.    Although the exposure apparatus of the embodiment has two intermediate<br><br>
pedestals, the exposure apparatus may have three or more intermediate pedestals. In this case, at least two of the three or more intermediate pedestals are connected to the upper pedestal. A honeycomb structure may be employed to reduce the weight of the plurality of intermediate pedestals.<br>
In the exposure apparatus of the embodiment, both the mask stage and projection optical system are disposed on the upper pedestal, but only one of the mask stage and projection optical system may be disposed on the upper pedestal, or a portion of the exposure body that is different from the mask stage and the projection optical system (e.g., at least a portion of the illumination optical system) may be disposed on the upper pedestal. Further, a honeycomb structure may be employed to reduce the weight of the upper pedestal. Further, like the lower pedestal, a plurality of upper pedestals each having a longitudinal direction in a direction intersecting with the longitudinal direction of each of the intermediate pedestals may be provided. In this case, each of the plurality of upper pedestals may be provided with a surface plate on which the mask stage is disposed.<br>
Although the exposure apparatus of the embodiment includes vibration isolation systems as four support members, the exposure apparatus may includes three or five or more vibration isolation systems.<br>
According to the exposure apparatus of the embodiment, the illumination optical system illuminates a mask (reticle), a transfer pattern formed on the mask is exposed on to the photosensitive substrate (exposing step), thereby producing a microdevice (semiconductor device, image pickup device, liquid crystal display element, thin film magnetic head and the like). One example when a semiconductor device as a microdevice is obtained by forming a predetermined circuit pattern on a plate as a photosensitive substrate using the exposure apparatus of the embodiment will be explained with reference to the flowchart shown in FIG. 5. First in step S301 in FIG 1, a metal film is evaporated on a plate of one lot.    In next<br><br>
step S302, a photoresist is applied onto the metal film on the plate of one lot. Then, in step S303, an image of the pattern on the mask is successively exposed and transferred onto each shot region on the plate of one lot. Then, in step S3 04, the photoresist on the plate of one lot is developed and then, a resist pattern is etched as a mask on the plate of one lot in step S305. With this, a circuit pattern corresponding to the pattern on the mask is formed on each shot region on each plate. Thereafter, the circuit pattern of an upper layer is formed and a device such as a semiconductor device is produced. According to the producing method of a semiconductor device, a fine pattern on a mask can precisely be exposed onto a substrate, and an excellent semiconductor device can be obtained.<br>
According to the exposure apparatus of the embodiment, a liquid crystal display element as a microdevice can be obtained by forming a predetermined pattern (circuit pattern, electrode pattern and the like) on a plate (glass substrate). One example of such a technique will be explained with reference to FIG. 6. In FIG. 6, in a pattern forming step S401, a so-called optical lithography step is carried out. In the optical lithography step, a pattern of a mask is transferred and exposed onto a photosensitive substrate (glass substrate to which resist is applied) using the exposure apparatus of the embodiment. By the optical lithography step, a predetermined pattern including a large number of electrodes is formed on the photosensitive substrate. Then, the exposed substrate is subjected to a developing step, an etching step, a resist-peeling off step and the like, a predetermined pattern is formed on a substrate, and the procedure is advanced to a next color filter forming step S402.<br>
Next, in the color filter forming step S402, a large number of sets of three dots corresponding to R (Red), G (Green) and B (Blue) are arranged in a matrix form, or a color filter is formed. In the color filter, sets of three filters of strips of R, G and B are arranged in a plurality of horizontal scanning directions. A cell assembling step S403 is carried out after the color filter forming step S402.    In the cell assembling<br><br>
step S403, a liquid crystal panel (liquid crystal cell) is assembled using a substrate having a predetermined pattern obtained in the pattern forming step S401 and a color filter obtained by the color filter forming step S402.<br>
In the cell assembling step S403, liquid crystal is infused between a substrate having a predetermined pattern obtained in the pattern forming step S401 and a color filter obtained in the color filter forming step S402, and a liquid crystal panel (liquid crystal cell) is produced. Then, various parts such as an electric circuit which allows the assembled liquid crystal panel (liquid crystal cell) to display, and a backlight, thereby completing a liquid crystal display element. According to the producing method of the liquid crystal display element, a fine pattern can precisely be exposed onto a large substrate, and an excellent liquid crystal display element can be obtained.
