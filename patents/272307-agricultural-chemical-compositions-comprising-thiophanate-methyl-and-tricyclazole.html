				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
AGRICULTURAL CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, AGRICULTURAL AND HORTICULTURAL PESTICIDE, AND PLANT DISEASE CONTROL METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an agricultural chemical composition containing two specific types of surfactants and agricultural chemical active ingredients.   In addition, the present invention relates to an agricultural and horticultural pesticide composition containing thiophanate-methyl and tricyclazole as active ingredients thereof, and to a method for controlling plant disease.<br>
The present application claims priority on Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-204222, filed in Japan on August 6, 2007, and on Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-204224, filed m Japan on August 6, 2007, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
Conventionally, in the cultivation of agricultural and horticultural crops, various agricultural chemical compositions have been used for the purpose of controlling weeds and harmful organisms.   Agricultural chemical compositions ordinarily contain an agricultural chemical active ingredient and a surface activating ingredient that is used for the purpose of stabilizing and enhancing the effect of the agricultural chemical active ingredient.<br>
 <br>
[0003]<br>
However, these compositions were not always considered to be satisfactory control agents due to the madequate control effects thereof, limitations on the use thereof due to the appearance of chemical-resistant pathogens, chemical damage or contamination of plant bodies, or toxicity to humans, livestock or fish and efifects on the environment.<br>
Thus, there has been a need to develop an agricultural chemical composition that can be used safely and is able to demonstrate a high level of control efifects on weeds and harmful organisms. [0004]<br>
However, rice blast is an important disease that affects paddy rice.   Rice plants that have succumb to rice blast demonstrate slow growth, decreased yield, and increased incidence of brown discolored rice and damaged rice.   The times at which rice blast is attempted to be controlled are divided into the mid-growth period during which control is targeted at rice leaf blast, and the late growth period during which control is targeted at head rice blast.   However, although leaf rice blast has conventionally been able to controlled by applying control agents to seedlings, it has been difBcult to control head rice blast. [0005]<br>
In relation to the present invention, Patent Document 1 proposes a rice blast control agent composition that contains a preventive pesticide that has preventive effects on rice blast and a medium-chain fatty acid triglyceride.<br>
In addition, Patent Document 2 also proposes a control agent for plant diseases such as rice blast (agricultural and horticultural pesticide composition).   However, since the control agent of Patent Document 2 also has inadequate control effects, has<br>
 <br>
limitations on the use thereof due to the appearance of chemical-resistant pathogens, causes chemical damage or contamination to plant bodies, or is toxic to humans, livestock or fish and affects the environment, there are a considerable number of control agents that are not necessarily satisfactory.<br>
Thus, there is a need for the development of a control agent that can be used safely and is able to demonstrate high levels of preventive effects and/or therapeutic effects (to simply be referred to as "control effects") against plant diseases such as rice blast.<br>

Specific examples of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers include polyoxyethylene (C12-C18) alkyl ethers, polyoxypropylene (C12-C18) alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block polymers and (C12-C18) alkylpolyoxyethylene- polyoxypropylene block polymer ethers.   More specifically, these include polyoxyethylene cetyl ether (Emalex 100 Series, Nippon Nyukazai) and polyoxyethylene octyl dodecyl ether (Emalex OD Series, Nippon Nyukazai). [0058]<br>
 <br>
specific examples of polycarboxylates are the same as previously described. [0059]<br>
One type of these surfactants can be used alone or two or more types can be used in combination.<br>
At least one type of these surfactants selected from the group consisting of polyoxyalkylene aryl ethers, polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers and polycarboxylates is used preferably, while a combination of polyoxyalkylene aryl ether and polycarboxylate is used more preferably. [0060]<br>
In the case of combining the use of a polyoxyalkylene aryl ether and polycarboxylate, the combination of a polyoxyalkylene tristyryl phenyl ether and polycarboxylate is more preferable.   Although there are no particular limitations on the weight ratio of the amounts of the polyoxyalkylene tristyryl phenyl ether and polycarboxylate used, it is preferably within the range of 8:2 to 3:7 and more preferably within the range of 7:3 to 5:5. [0061]<br>
The total amount of surfactant used is preferably within the range of 0.1 to 10% by weight and more preferably within the range of 1 to 5% by weight based on the total weight of the agricultural and horticultural pesticide composition. [0062]<br>
Additives such as an extender can be added as necessary, and specific examples thereof are as previously described. [0063]<br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the preparation form of the present mvention, a wettable powder is preferable.   Although there are no particular limitations<br>

Typical examples of plant diseases include the previously listed typical examples of plant diseases controlled using agricultural chemicals. [0066]<br>
The agricultural and horticultural pesticide composition of the present invention demonstrates superior effects against the plant disease of rice blast (including both leaf rice blast and head rice blast). [0067]<br>
3) Plant Disease Control Method<br>
The plant disease control method of the present invention comprises the application of the agricultural and horticultural pesticide composition of the present invention to agricultural and horticultural crops.<br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the agricultural and horticultural crops targeted for application, rice plants are particularly preferable. [0068]<br>
 <br>
Examples of methods for applying the agricultural and horticultural pesticide composition to agricultural and horticultural crops include applying the composition to the plant body, seeds, water surface or soil either directly or after suitably diluting with water and the like. [0069]<br>
For example, in the case of using the agricultural and horticultural pesticide composition in the form of a wettable powder, the wettable powder is used after diluting to a prescribed concentration with water in the form of a solution, suspension or emulsion.   The applied concentration of the wettable powder is normally 1 to 1000 ppm and preferably 10 to 250 ppm. [0070]<br>
Although varying according to weather conditions, preparation form, time of application, application method, applied location, target control disease, target crop and the like, the applied amount of the agricultural and horticultural pesticide composition is normally 1 to 1000 g and preferably 100 to 600 g as the amount of active ingredients per hectare.<br>
Although varying according to the target crop and the like, the time of application is, in the case of targeting against rice blast, for example, starting four weeks before flowering to flowering. [0071]<br>
According to the control method of the present invention, superior control effects can be obtained against various crop diseases, and particularly against rice blast.   In addition, the application period for control of crop diseases is long.   Thus, there is a high degree of freedom in the application period of the control agent (agricultural and horticultural pesticide composition).<br>
 <br>

[0074]<br>
The resulting mixture was crushed with a high-speed impact pulverizer (Contraplex 250CW, rotating speed in main unit: 11200 rpm, rotating speed at door: 2800 rpm, crushing performance: approx. 180 kg/hr, Hosokawa Micron).   Next, the crushed powder was again mixed with a ribbon blender (1150 W x 3500 L, 4.0 m^, 5.5 kw, Soda Engineering). [0075]<br>
After again crushing the resulting mixture with a jet mill (Ulmax 18BU-9N, air flow rate: approx. 10 Nm^/h, crushing performance: approx. 90 kg/hr, Soda Engineering), the crushed powder was mixed for 60 minutes with a ribbon blender (1000 W x 3000 L, 4.0 m\ 7.5 kw. Soda Engineering) to prepare a Wettable Powder 1 having a mean particle diameter of 6.58 |xm. [0076]<br>
 <br>
(Text Example 1 Rice Blast Control Effect Confirmation<br>
Test)<br>
The following test was carried out to investigate the control effects of the Wettable Powder 1 obtained in Example 1 on rice blast. [0077]<br>
Rice seeds (variety: OM1490) were planted (180 kg/ha) and grown into rice plants followed by infestation with leaf rice blast or head rice blast and spraying with the Wettable Powder 1 at the timing and in the sprayed amounts indicated below.<br>
*	When 20% of leafs were affected for leaf rice blast<br>
*	7 days before flowering for head rice blast [0078]<br>
The control effects of the Wettable Powder 1 on rice blast (both leaf rice blast and head rice blast) were evaluated based on disease incidence and disease index. [0079]<br>
a) Leaf Rice Blast<br>
(i) Disease Incidence<br>
Disease incidence was evaluated according to values calculated according to the following equation (1) by investigating the number of leaves that had been affected by rice leaf blast 1 day before, 7 days after, 14 days after and 21 days after spraying the Wettable Powder 1.   The results are shown in the following Table 2. [0080]<br>
[Equation 1]<br>

	xlOO	(1)<br>
Total no. of leafs [0081]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
(ii) Disease Index<br>
Three leaves each from the upper portions of 50 rice plants were investigated 1 day before, 7 days after, 14 days after and 21 days after spraying the Wettable Powder 1. The disease index of leaf rice blast was then calcxilated according to the following equation (2).   The results are shown in the following Table 3. [0083]<br>
[Equation 2]<br>
 <br>
[0084]<br>
In the above equation, N represents the total number of leaves investigated, ni represents the number of leaves afiFected by leaf rice blast corresponding to a score of 1, na represents the number of leaves affected by leaf rice blast corresponding to a score of 3, ns represents the number of leaves affected by leaf rice blast corresponding to a score of 5, n? represents the number of leaves afiFected by leaf rice blast corresponding to a<br>
 <br>
score of 7, and ng represents the number of leaves afifected by leaf rice blast<br>
corresponding to a score of 9.<br>
[0085]<br>
Furthermore, scores for leaves afifected by leaf rice blast were determined according to the criteria indicated below.<br>
1: Less than 1% of leaf affected<br>
3: Less than 5% of leaf affected<br>
5: Less than 25% of leaf affected<br>
7: Less than 50% of leaf affected<br>
9: 50% or more of leaf affected<br>
 <br>
b) Head Rice Blast<br>
Fifty rice plant flowers were investigated 7 days before harvesting following by investigating the number of rice heads affected by head rice blast.   The disease incidence of head rice blast was calculated according to the following equation (3).<br>
 <br>
[0088]<br>
[Equation 3]<br>
 <br>
[0089]<br>
In addition, the disease index was calculated according to the following equation (4).   The results are also shown in the following Table 4. [0090]<br>
[Equation 4]<br>
 <br>
[0091]<br>
In the above equation, N represents the number of flowers investigated, ni represents the number of flowers affected by head rice blast corresponding to a score of 1, n2 represents the number of flowers affected by head rice blast corresponding to a score of 2, nj represents the number of flowers affected by head rice blast corresponding to a score of 3, ru represents the number of flowers affected by head rice blast corresponding to a score of 4, and nj represents the number of flowers affected by head rice blast corresponding to a score of 5. [0092]<br>
Furthermore, scores for flowers afifected by head rice blast were determined according to the criteria indicated below.<br>
1: Only 1 or 2 spikelets affected<br>
2: Less than 30% of spikelet affected<br>
3: 30% to 60% of spikelet affected<br>
 <br>
4: More than 60% of spikelet affected 5: One or more panicles affected<br>
 <br>
[0094]<br>
On the basis of the above results, the Wettable Powder 1 of Example 1 was determined to demonstrate superior control effects against leaf rice blast and head rice blast without causing damage to the plants. [0095]<br>
(Test Example 2 Chemical Damage Test)<br>
The conditions of rice plants 2 days after, 4 days after and 7 days after spraying with the Wettable Powder 1 were observed to evaluate chemical damage attributable to the Wettable Powder 1.<br>
Rice plants were evaluated based on a scale of 1 to 9, assigning a score of" 1" when chemical damage was not observed and a score of "9" when the rice plant died. The results of the evaluations are shown in the following Table 1. [0096]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
On the basis of the above results, the Wettable Powder 1 of Example 1 was not observed to demonstrate chemical damage in the same manner as conventional pesticide compositions. [0098]<br>
(Example 2)<br>
Thiophanate-methyl and tricyclazole were dissolved m DMF (containing 1.5% Tween20) at the ratios indicated in Table 5 followed by adjusting to the concentrations shown in Table 5 with deionized water containing 0.02% Tween20 to prepare chemical solutions.<br>
An adequate amount of the aforementioned chemical solutions were sprayed over entire potted rice plants at about the 3.5 leaf stage using an atomizer nozzle, and after allowing the chemical solutions to air-dry, the rice plants were infested with rice blast spores (test strain: Pyricularia oryzae strain Po-5) by spraying the entire plants with a suspension thereof (approx. 5x10^ spores/ml) followed by allowing to stand undisturbed under greenhouse conditions (in acrylic boxes) in a constant temperature chamber at 23°C.   The covers of the boxes were opened after about 20 hours and then<br>
 <br>
allowed to stand undisturbed while drying in the constant temperature chamber.   The numbers of spots on the third or fourth leaf that had completely opened after infestation were investigated 7 or 8 days after infestation to calculate disease control values. Those results are shown in Table 5.   As shown in Table 5, the control values of a treated group treated with chemical solutions containing thiophanate-methyl and tricyclazole demonstrated results that were greater than Colby theoretical values.<br>
 <br>
(Example 3)<br>
Thiophanate-methyl and tricyclazole were dissolved in DMSO at the ratios shown in Tables 6 and 7, followed by dissolving the resulting solutions in PDA medium to the concentrations shown in Tables 6 and 7 to prepare agar plates. After preparing the agar plates, disks (4 mm in diameter) impregnated with Pyricularia oryzae strain Po-5 were placed on the agar plates. After allowing to stand undisturbed for 10 days at 20°C, the diameters of the resulting colonies were measured to determine mycelial growth inhibition rates. Those results are shown in Tables 6 and 7. As shown in Tables 6 and 7, the mycelial growth mhibition rates of the treated groups using agar<br>
 <br>
plates    (chemical    solutions)    containing    thiophanate-methyl    and    tricyclazole<br>
demonstrated results that were greater than the Colby theoretical values.<br>
[0101]<br>
 <br>
On the basis of the above results, the combined use of thiophanate-methyl and tricyclazole was determined to allow the obtaining of synergistic eflfects.<br>
