DUST BOOT WITH GREASE RELIEF PASSAGE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This patent application claims priority to US Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/711,207, filed August 25, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] This invention relates to a boot type seal especially adapted for ball and socket type joints. More particularly, it relates to a boot type seal for ball and socket type joints having a grease relief passage or passages on an outer surface thereof<br>
2.	Related Art<br>
[0003] Nearly all original chassis equipment, such as ball joints and tie rod ends, are sealed units* These "lube-for4ife" parts are low maintenance since they are sealed, but generally do not have the longevity of a "greaseable" part. A greaseable part is one in which additional grease may be added periodically to replace grease which has escaped or broken down during use, thereby flushing old grease, debris associated wilt wear of the joint parts or other contaminants (e.g., moisture, dirt or the like) from the joint and replacing it with new grease to reduce friction and increase the service Use of the component. Accordingly, greaseable parts are preferred for many apphcations, particularly in the automotive aftermarket and service parts markets . One challenge faced when designing a dust boot for a greaseable part is that the dust boot must serve as a barrier to prevent contamination from entering the articulating component. At the same time, the dust boot must allow grease, joint debris and other contaminants to escape when the part is flushed with new grease, such as by a repair technician, or when articulation of the joint or compression of the dust boot, or both, create conditions where there is an excess of grease within the dust boot or a portion thereof<br><br>
[0004] The dust boot is nominally compressed against a control aim or other mating component of the suspension in conjunction with its installation. In some applications and joint designs where there is a large amount of stud swing, or where the boot is compressed against the control arm or other mating component over a relatively large portion of its surface area, a condition may arise where the dust boot surface may form an additional seal around the grease relief flap thereby preventing the release of grease from the grease relief passage. This becomes a concern when the stud is articulated in the same direction as the primary grease exit passage. In other words, the compression of the boot, particularly in the region of the grease evacuation flap, can result in trapped grease in the boot. If the dust boot is not able to release the grease, it may accumulate an excess of pressure causing the boot to burst or rupture during lubrication or operation of the joint, or for the grease to be released from the dust boot and joint at a location other than the intended exit point and escape path. Therefore, it is very desirable to develop greaseable dust boots which overcome the aforementioned limitations of prior art devices.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] This invention comprises the incorporation of at least one grease relief passage on the outer surface of a dust boot. The passage is preferably located proximate to a cooperating grease rehef flap. The passage may comprise a feature such as a rib, or plurality of ribs, that protrude from the outer surface of the boot, or altemately, it may comprise a feature formed into the surface, such as a groove, a plurality of grooves or other surface relief pattern sufficient to provide the necessary passageway.<br>
[0006] In one aspect, the invention comprises a grease relief passage including three ribs located on the outer surface proximate the rehef flap which extend radically from the flap across the outer surface of the dust boot. In this embodiment one rib is located on each side of the grease evacuation flap, and one aligned directly underneath it. The two outside ribs extend from the small end of the dust boot away from the stud opening, preferably to at least three-quarters of the distance to the large<br><br>
end. The middle rib extends from just below an undercut extending next to the flap also away from the stud opening, also preferably to at least three-quarters of the distance to the large end. However, all of the ribs may terminate at the large end of the dust boot if desired.<br>
[0007] In one aspect, the invention comprises a grease relief passage including two radically extending grooves or channels formed in the outer surface separated by a rib. The surface of the rib may be co-planar with the extension of the outer surface of the boot, or may be raised above or relieved below this plane.<br>
[0008] In yet another aspect, the invention comprises a ball joint having a ball stud, a bearing, housing and a dust boot to enclose them which incorporates at least one grease relief channel on the outer surface of the dust boot.<br>
[0009] As grease is flushed from the dust boot, it is directed along a path defined by the grease rehef passage. If a dust boot becomes pinched during stud articulation, the grease relief passage provides an escape path for grease after it passes the flap. Accordingly, even if the dust boot becomes compressed so that a fold develops in the body of the dust boot and presses against the underside of the control arm or spindle, an evacuation route remakes for the grease to make a full and complete exit from the dust boot interior, thereby avoiding the pressurization of the dust boot and the possibility of its bursting or rupture, or of causing the grease to escape from the joint other than by the mended escape path.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0019] A typical ball joint assembly is generally shown at 10 in FIGS. 1^ 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8, and in an alternate arrangement in FIG. 9. The ball joint assembly 10 includes a cup-like housing 12, preferably formed from a metal such as steel, in which is captured the articulating ball portion 14 of a ball stud 16, also preferably formed from a metal such as steel The ball stud 16 also includes a shank portion 17 that extends integrally from the ball portion 14, outwardly from the housing 12. The shank portion 17 has a tapered connection surface 18 and a threaded end 20. As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, a control arm 22 may be joined to the tapered connecting surface 18 of ball joint assembly 10 and secured into position via nut 24. Instead of the depicted control arm 22, another anchoring feature such as a knuckle, spindle, link or frame or other chassis component may be used. The joint is adapted to receive grease or other lubricant through grease fitting 25<br>
[0020] Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the joint assembly also comprises a joint enclosure for enclosing and sealing the housing 12 and ball portion 14 from the external contaminants, including dust, dirt and moisture and also cooperating with<br><br>
them to retain a lubricant such as grease, comprises a dust boot, generally indicated at 26 having an outer surface 27, which generally possesses a domed shape including a large opening 28 or housing opening 28 having a lip or other feature adapted to fit tightly against the stud exit end 29 of the ball joint housing 12. Dust Boot 26 is generally formed from an elastomers, such as natural or synthetic rubber and the like, or various plastics. A material is chosen having inherent resiliency tending to reclaim its original molded shape upon deformation although accommodating such deformation without appreciable resistance. The dust boot may have other shape configurations instead of domed, including many variations of a stepped or capped cylinder, accordion-like folds or other well-known shapes. The large opening 28 of the dust boot 26 can be reinforced with a rigid ring 30, such as a zinc or cadmium plated steel ring or various rigid plastics, as perhaps best shown in the exploded view of FIG. 5. The small opening 23 or shank opening 23 of the dust boot 26 surrounds the stud 16 on shank portion 17 and includes one or more wiping lips 32 which dynamically seal against the exterior surface of shank 17. An annular rim 34 projects axially upwardly from the dust boot 26 to bear in pressing engagement against the surface of the control arm 22 (or other feature), thus perfecting a substantially fluid tight seal therebetween. The rim 34 is formed with a flexible flap 36 which is designed with respect to its shape (e.g., cross sectional profile), size (e.g., height, length and thickness), location and other aspects to yield under a sxifficient pressure differential to permit evacuation of excess grease or other lubricant from the rimed confines of the dust boot 26 at flexible flap 36 preferentially to other portions of the rim 34 or of other points of contact between elements of ball joint 10 and dust boot 26. An undercut 35 is provided just below the flap 36 which functions to thin the wall thickness adjacent to flap 36 and Tierney reduce the pressure required for grease to push open the flap 36 as compared with the pressure that would be required at other portions of rim 34.<br>
[0021] As shown in FIG. 3, excess grease passes through the wiping lips 32 along a route past the flap 36 depicted by the arrow depicting grease path 44. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 5, an insert 38 can be fitted into a retaining channel adjacent the<br><br>
wiping lips 32. One or more internal through holes in the insert 38 align with one or more chaplet holes in the rubber of the dust boot 26 to route excess lubricant from the interior of the dust boot 26 at a location spaced away from the wiping lips 32. However, in this arrangement excess grease is still directed to flap 36 where it may exit boot 26 in the manner described above along grease path 44. [0022] In some circumstances the control arm 22 (or other feature) will compress the dust boot 26 and buckle side wall of the dust boot 26 which may unintentionally block egress of lubricant from the assembly 10, and particularly dust boot 26. As explained above, this can have a damaging affect on the ball joint assembly 10. To overcome this issue, the dust boot 26 is provided with at least one grease reef passage 39. Referring to FIGS. 1-8, this passage is formed by a plurality of longitudinally and radially extending ribs 40 cooperating together with the relief passage portion 31 of outer surface 27. This may be provided by as few as one, but preferably as shown by three, longitudinally and radially extending ribs 40 protruding from the exterior surface 27 of the dust boot 26. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-8, two outside ribs 40 extend on either side of the flap 36. The third or center rib 40 may be centered directly under the flap 36 as shown, or otherwise located between the two outer ribs 40. The ribs 40 cooperate with the passage portion 31 of outer surface 27, namely the portion or portions of outer surface 27 proximate the ribs 40 and flap 36 as well as the portion of outer surface 41 of control arm 22 proximate the ribs 40 to define grease relief passage 39. Grease relief passage 39 may include one or more channels 43 through which grease exiting dust boot 26 at flap 36 may flow The two outside ribs 40 extend from the rim 34 about three-quarters of the distance to the large opening 28. The center ribs 40 extend from just below the undercut 35 along the flap 36 about three-quarters of the distance to the large opening 28. The approximate size for the rib 40 is dependent on the size of the boot 26, however a height of 0.030" has been determined to be an effective minimum size. In addition to variations in the length of ribs 40, the width and height and outer profile of the ribs may also vary and be different along their lengths, as well as from rib 40 to rib 40.<br><br>
[0023] The ribs 40 guarantee an evacuation path for the grease in the event the dust boot 26 becomes compressed or pinched during stud 16 articulation. Thus, the ribs 40 provide an grease escape path 44 for grease after the grease flows through the flap 36. [0024] It is believed that the ribs 40 may also be segmented such that the channels comprising grease relief passage 39 are effectively interconnected. It is believed that ribs 40 may also include any manner of protrusion or plurality of protrusions, such as a plurality of raised features (e.g., cylinders) or bumps, which serve to create a sufficient standoff between the outer surface 27 of dust boot 26 and outer surface of 41 of control arm 22 to form one or more channels comprising grease relief passage 39 between flap 36 and approximately the opposing end or large opening 28 of dust boot 26.<br>
[0025] Referring now to FIG. 9, it is also beeves that grease relief passage 39 may be formed as at least one channel 43 formed as a recess in passage portions 41 of outer surface 27, This channel 43' or channels 43' also extends generally longitudinally and radially from the flap 36 to the opposing end or large opening 28 of dust boot 26. It is behaved that an effective minimum depth of channel 43 is about 0.030 inches. The rib 40' shown is flush with a plane comprising the extension of surface the extension of outer surface 27, however, it is believed that rib 40* may be extended above or be recessed slightly beneath the beneath this plane. In such embodiments, the channels 43 may be formed by at least one rib 40, or alternately by a plurality of ribs 40* which may be the same (e.g., have the same height, width and length) or different, analogous to the possible variations described above for protruding ribs 40.<br>
[0026] Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in Hght of the above teachings. For example, the ribs 40 need not be continuous, but rather may have a segmented style. Alternatively, it may be possible to create a trough-like configuration which functions in much the same way to guarantee an escape path for excess grease. It is, therefore, to be understood that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
