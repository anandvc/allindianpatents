TITLE<br>
A self setting vertical flour mill<br>
APPLICANT<br>
Rohitbhai Jashbhai Patel, an Indian national, 20 GIDC Estate, Vithal Udyognagar 388121, District Anand, Gujarat, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a self setting vertical flour mill.<br>
A flour mill is used to grind solid food articles such as cereals, pulses, seeds or spices.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A typical vertical flour mill comprises a stationary grinding stone and a rotary grinding stone disposed; in a housing having their grinding :; surfaces abutting each other at the edges and provided with depressions at the center. Using a key and key way arrangement, the rotary grinding stone is locked onto a rotatably  mounted mill shaft! The rotary grinding stone is rotatable in the vertical plane with the mill shaft and is axially slidable but radially non-rotatable on the mill shaft. A manually operated pressure screw and thrust nut arrangement is provided to adjust the contact pressure of the rotary grinding stone against the stationary grinding. The rotary grinding<br><br><br>
stone is counter balanced by a compression spring disposed over the mill shaft between the grinding stones. The housing is provided with a front cover removably screw fitted thereto. The mill is located in a cabinet. Depending upon the sizes of the food articles being fed and flour size required, during each instance of operation of such a flour mill, both the contact pressure of the rotary grinding stone against the stationary grmding stone and the feed rate are to be adjusted and regulated manually separately operating the pressure screw and thrust nut arrangement and a feed distributor cum regulator provided in the feed inlet passage of the mill. Operation of both the pressure screw and thrust nut arrangement and feed distributor cum regulator separately is inconvenient, troublesome and time consuming. Because me contact pressure setting of the rotary grmding stone against the stationary stone is manual, precise control of the pressure setting is not practically possible. If the pressure setting is less than what is required, effective grinding will not take place. If the pressure setting is more than what is required which is invariably the case, excessive friction is generated between the grinding stones and the grinding stones start<br><br><br>
disintegrating fast. Due to wear and tear to the stones, the contact pressure setting goes on increasing. As a result the life of the grinding stones is reduced and the frequency of replacement of the stones increases. Due to excessive pressure setting torque/load on the mill shaft and power consumption increase thereby increasing the running cost of the mill. Besides the flour gets contaminated with stone particles thereby spoiling the quality of the flour. Excessive friction generates excessive heat because of which the mill gets overheated and the flour gets degraded. Due to excessive friction and heat generation at times the flour starts burning giving rise to smoke and the mill has to be switched off. Due to excessive heat generation the windings of the electric motor driving the mill also may be damaged. Because the contact pressure setting of the rotary stone against the stationary stone at each time of operation is fixed and is not yielding and flexible grinding takes place at the same pressure and the flour formed comprises fine particles of almost uniform sizes. It may not thus contain enough fibre content which is essential in a health food. Access into the housing for cleaning or removal of the rotary stone or repair or replacement of the<br><br><br>
components within the housing, the front cover has to be dismantled after removal of the fixing screws. At the time of refitting of the rotary stone on the mill shaft, the key and keyway are to be aligned. On completion of the work, the front cover has to be refitted with the fixing screws. All this is cumbersome and time consuming.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a self setting vertical flour mill which obviates manual setting of contact pressure of the rotary stone against the stationary stone and drawbacks associated therewith.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a self setting vertical flour mill which grinds solid food articles naturally to produce coarse and good quality flour rich in fibre.<br><br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a self setting vertical flour mill which niinimises friction and heat generation between the grinding stones and prevents over heating of the mill and damage to the windings of the electric motor driving the mill.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a self setting vertical flour mill which reduces torque/load on the mill shaft and power consumption and also damage to the grinding stones and running cost of the mill and increases life of the stones.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a self setting vertical flour mill which renders access into the housing and refitting of the rotary stone on the mill shaft is easy and convenient and less time consuming.<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a self setting vertical flour mill consisting of a stationary grinding stone and a rotary grinding stone disposed in a housing provided with a feed inlet passage and a flour outlet passage, the grinding surfaces of the grinding stones abutting each other at the edges and provided with depressions at the center, the stationery grinding stone being fixed in the housing adjacent to the backside wall of the housing and the rotary grinding stone being rotatable in the vertical plane with a rotatably mounted mill shaft passing through feed openings provided in the stationery grinding stone and the back side wall of the housing and communicating with the feed inlet passage, the rotary grinding stone being provided with a flour wiper fixed to the backside thereof, a hopper fitted in the feed inlet passage and provided with feed sensor, a feed distributor cum regulator provided in the feed inlet passage and a drive arrangement connected to the mill shaft, wherein the rotary grinding stone is connected to the inner end of the mill,shaft by a detachable, swiveling, axially translatable and radially non-rotatable coupling means and is pivotally bearing against a self setting mechanism rigidly fixed to the front<br><br><br>

Referring to Figs 1 to 4 of the accompanying drawings, 1 is a self setting vertical flour mill comprising a stationary grinding stone 2 and a rotary grinding stone 3 disposed in a housing 4 provided with a feed inlet passage 5 and a flour outlet passage 6.  7 is a reinforcing frame fixed to the<br><br>
backside of the rotary grinding stone. The reinforcing frame may be made of metals such as stainless steel, mild steel of cast iron. The grinding surfaces of the grinding stones 2 and 3 abut each other at the edges and are provided with depressions 8 and 9 at the centre respectively to define a space for solid food articles to be ground (not shown). The stationary grinding stone is fixed in the housing adjacent to the backside wall 10 of the!housing and the rotary grinding stone is rotatable in the vertical plane with a rotatably mounted mill shaft 11 passing through feed openings 12 and 13 provided in the stationary grinding stone and the back side wall of the housing respectively and communicating, with the feed inlet passage. The rotary grinding stone is provided with a flour wiper 14 fixed to the reinforcing frame. 15 is a hopper fixed in the feed inlet passage and provided with a feed sensor comprising a photo emitter 16a and a photo sensor 16b. A feed distributor cum regulator comprising a stepped diameter sleeve 17 is disposed at the lower end of the inlet passage and fixed on the mill shaft. The large diameter portion 18 of the stepped diameter sleeve is provided with spaced flutes 19 along it.   The inner end 20 of the large diameter<br><br><br>
poition is spaced from the feed opening 13 in the backside wall of the housing so as to form a gap 21 therebetween. A feed regulating strip 22 is transversely slidably disposed in the gap 21 between the inner end of the large diameter poition of the sleeve and the feed opening in the backside wall of the housing and provided with a slot 23 registering with the gap 21. The strip is fixed to a rack 24 engaged against a pinion 25 provided with a shaft 26 fitted with a knob 27 (Figs 1 and 2). The feed rate of the solid food articles into the space between the grinding stones formed by depressions 8 and 9 therein is controlled and regulated by opening and closing the gap 21 between the inner end of the large diameter poition of the sleeve and feed opening in the backside wall of the housing by transversely linearly moving the strip 22 by rotating the pinion by holding and turning the knob 27. When the strip 22 fully overlaps and closes the gap 21 inflow of food articles through the gap into the space at the centre of the grinding stones is fully stopped. The extent of overlap between the slot 23 in the strip 22 and the gap 21 between the large diameter position of the sleeve and feed opening in the backside wall of the housing decides the rate of inflow of food<br><br><br>
articles through the gap. When the slot 23 and the gap 21 register with each other fully the gap is fully opened for maximum inflow of the food articles. The feed from the hopper first falls down on the large diameter portion of the stepped diameter sleeve which is rotatable with the mill shaft. The flutes on the large diameter portion of the stepped diameter sleeve push and distribute the feed into the gap 21 between the inner end of the larger diameter portion of the sleeve and feed opening in the backside of the housing. The mill shaft 11 is rotatably mounted using bearings 28 and 29 located in a casing 30 which is fixed to the backside wall of the housing and the hopper. 31 is a detachable cover for the casing 30 removably fitted to the casing 30 using screw 32. Access into the casing is made easy because of the detachable cover. A drive arrangement is provided comprising an electric motor 33 having driver pulley 34 fitted on the output shaft 35 thereof. 33a is foundation of the motor. 36 is a driven pulley fitted on the mill shaft. The pulleys are interconnected by V-belt 37. The photosensor is electrically connected to the starter (not shown) of the motor. 33b is a cabinet for the mill.<br><br><br>
According to the invention the rotary grinding stone 3 is provided with a bush 38 at its center fitted to the frame 7 with screws 39 (Fig 3). The bush defines a circular inner wall (not marked but can be seen in Fig 3) provided with a crosspin 40 fixed thereto. The inner end 41 of the mill shaft 11 is provided with an open slot 42 and is disposed in the bush with the crosspin 40 engaged in the open slot. The inner end of the mill shaft is provided with a tapered circular outer profile defining a clearance with the inner sidewall of the bush (not marked but can be seen in Fig 3). Because of the crosspin 40 and slot 42 coupling between the bush and inner end of the mill shaft, the rotary stone does not radially rotate on the mill shaft but is rotatable with the mill shaft. The rotary stone is also axially translatable along the length of the slot 42. Because of the clearance between the inner end of the shaft and inner sidewall of the bush, the rotary grinding stone is flexible and swivelling about the inner end of the mill shaft radially. The crosspin and slot coupling between the bush and inner end of the mill shaft also makes it possible to assemble and disassemble the rotary grinding stone and mill shaft easily instantly.   A self setting mechanism is provided<br><br>
comprising a ball bearing 43 located in a casing 44 loaded by compression spring 45. The casing is removably fitted to the front cover 46 of the housing with screws 47. 48 is a groove provided along the outer race 49 of the ball bearing 43. 50 is a screw whose edge is engaged in the groove 48 along the outer race of the ball bearing 43. Screw 50 is hi thread engagement with a sidewall of the casing and is accessible from outside the casing. Ball bearing 43 is awally movable but non-rotatable in the casing due to engagement of the edge of the screw 50 in groove 48 on the outer race of the ball bearing. 51 is a pin fitted to the inner race 52 of the ball bearing 43. Pin 51 is axially movable with the ball; bearing 43 and is protruding into the housing through a slot (not marked but can be seen in Fig 3) in die front cover. 53 is a ball freely located in a circular notch (not marked but can be seen in Fig 3) at the tip of the pin and bearing against the bush. The rotary grinding stone which is axially movable and radially flexible and swivelling and rotatable with the mill shaft pivotally bears against the ball 53. Because of the point contact provided by the ball against the bush of the rotary grinding stone friction between the rotary grinding stone and ball is<br><br><br>
1<br>
negligible. Depending on the feed rate and size of the food articles being fed, the rotary grinding stone moves axially back and forth and also tilts radially and sets by itself under tension of spring 45. Thus the rotary grinding stone is self setting about the mill shaft axis responsive to feed rate and size. 54 is a bracket fitted to the front cover, 46 which is hinged (hinge marked 46a) to the housing (Figs 2 and 3). The distal end of the bracket projects out of the front cover and is provided with an open slot 55. 56 is a worm disposed along the housing in alignment with the open slot 55 in the bracket and hinged (hinge marked 57) to the housing. 58 is worm wheel in thread engagement with the worm. The worm is disposed in the open slot 55 in the bracket and the worm wheel 58 is rotated in one direction and tightened against the bracket to clamp the front cover to the housing. The front cover is undamped and opened out by joosening the worm wheel by rotating it in the opposite direction and lifting and disengaging the worm along with worm wheel from the open slot 55 in the bracket. Because the rotary grinding stone is axially movable and self setting, it is not necessary to adjust contact pressure of the rotary grinding stone against the stationary grinding<br><br>
stone at each time of operation of the mill depending upon feed rate and size. Only the feed rate is required to be controlled by adjusting the feed distributor cum regulator. Therefore, operation of the mill is easy and convenient and less time consuming. On account of the anally self setting and radially swivelling nature of the rotary grinding stone, excessive friction and heat generation between the grinding stones is eliminated. Overheating of the mill and damage to the windings of the electric motor due to overheating are prevented. Wear and tear to the grinding stones is also reduced. Torque/load on the mill shaft and power consumption are also reduced. The life of the grinding stones is increased and the frequency of replacement of the stones is reduced. Running cost of the mill is also reduced. Due to elimination of excessive friction and heat generation breakage of the stones and contamination of the flour With stone particles is avoided. Burning of the flour is also avoided. The quality of the flour is thus maintained. Due to the axially self setting and radially flexible and swivelling nature of the rotary grinding stone the rotation of the rotary grinding stone is akin to rotation of a pestle in mortar ie natural grinding.<br><br><br>
The flour thus obtained is coarse and rich in fibre which is essential in a health food. Access into the housing is easily instantly; available by simply unclamping and opening out the front cover about the hinge. Closing of the front cover is also easily instantly done by simply bringing the front cover against the housing and tightening the worm wheel against the bracket. The rotary grinding stoncis easily instantly engaged to or disengaged from the<br>
if<br>
mill shaft by simply engaging the crosspin in the bush in the open slot at the inner end of the mill shaft or disengaging the crosspin from the open slot. Therefore, opening and closing of the front cover and access into the housing for cleaning or removal of the rotary stone or repair or replacement of the components is easy, convenient and less time consuming. The invention also eliminates the compression spring between the grinding stones.<br>
Referring to Figs 5 and 6 of the accompanying drawings, the rotary grinding stone 3 is provided with a bush 59 at its center fitted to the frame 7 with screws 39. The bush defines a circular inner wall (not marked but can be seen) provided with a pair of oppositely disposed grooves 60<br><br>
along the length thereof. The inner end 61 of the mill shaft is provided with a crosspin 62 whose ends protrude outside directly opposite sides of the inner end of the mill shaft. The inner end of the mill shaft is disposed in the bush with the protruding ends of the crosspin engaged in the grooves in the inner wall of the bush. The inner end of the mill shaft is provided with a tapered circular outer profile defining a clearance (not marked but can be seen) with the inner wall of the bush. Because of the crosspin and grooves coupling between the bush and inner end of the mill shaft, the rotary grinding stone is rotatable with the mill shaft without describing any rotary motion on the mill shaft. The rotary grinding stone is also translatable axially along the length of the grooves. The clearance between the bush inner wall and tapered inner end of the mill shaft allows the rotary grinding stone to swivel about the inner end of the mill shaft radially. All, the advantages stated earlier are thus obtained in this embodiment also. The crosspin and grooves coupling between the inner end of the mill shaft and bush also facilitates easy and instant assembly and disassembly thereof.<br><br>
Referring to Figs 7 and 8 of the accompanying drawings, the rotary grinding stone 3 is provided with a bush 63 at its center fitted to the frame 7 with screws 39. The bush defines a square shaped inner wall (not marked but can be seen). The inner end 64 of the mill shaft is square shaped (not marked but can be seen) and disposed in the bush 63 defining a clearance (not marked but can be seen) with the inner wall of the bush. In Figs 9 and 10 of the accompanying drawings, the rotary grinding stone 3 is provided with a bush 65 at its inner end fitted to the frame 7 with screws 39. The bush defines a rectangular shaped inner wall (not marked but can be seen). The inner end 66 of the mill shaft is rectangular shaped (not marked but can be seen) and disposed in the bush 65 defining a clearance (not marked but can be seen) with the inner wall of the bush. In Figs 11 and 12 of the accompanying drawings, the rotary grinding stone. 3 is provided with a bush 67 at its inner end fitted to the frame 7 with screws 39. The bush defines an oval shaped inner wall (not marked but can be seen). The inner end 68 of the mill shaft is oval shaped (not marked but can be seen) and disposed in the bush defining a clearance (not marked but can be seen) with<br><br>
■»	•..,■'<br><br>
the inner wall of the bush. Because of the clearance between the bush and mill shaft, the rotary grinding stone is axially translatable on the mill shaft and also radially swivelling. At the same time the rotary grinding stone rotates with the mill shaft without describing any rotary motion on the mill shaft. Consequently all the advantages described earlier are obtained in the above three embodiments also. The rotary grinding stone and bush may be assembled and disassembled easily instantly.<br>
Referring to Figs 13 and 14 of the accompanying drawings, the self setting mechanism thereof is similar to that of Fig 3 except that the tip of the pin 51 fitted to the inner race 52 of the ball bearing 43 is square shaped marked 69 having ball 53 freely located in a circular notch (not marked but can be seen) therein. The bush 38 is fitted with a plate 38a at its back and is provided with a square shaped recess 70 in the plate 38a. The square shaped tip of the pin is engated in the square shaped recess at the back of the bush defining a clearance with the sidewall of the recess (not marked but can be seen). The ball bears against the base of the square recess. Because the<br><br>
rotary grinding stone and pin are engaged to each other through the square shaped pin tip and square shaped recess, the pin rotates with the rotary grinding stone eliminating friction between the bush and ball. The clearance between the square shaped pin tip and square shaped recess provides flexibility to the rotary grinding stone to move axially and tilt and swivel radially without describing any rotary motion on the pin tip.<br>
Referring to Fig 15 of the accompanying drawings, the self-setting mechanism of Fig 3 or Fig 13 is provided with a tension adjusting bolt 71 in thread engagement with the front wall of the casing 44. The bolt head is accessible from outside and the edge of the bolt is projecting into the casing 44 and engaged in a recess 72 provided in a transverse member 73 disposed against the compression spring at its end away from the ball bearing. The spring tension on the rotary grinding stone may be adjusted by turning and moving the bolt in and out.<br>
The bush may be made of materials such as brass, cast iron or mild steel, preferably cast iron.<br><br><br>
The above embodiments are by way of examples and should not be construed to be limitative of the scope of the invention. Several variations in the above embodiments are possible without deviating from the scope of the invention. For instance, the coupling means, self setting mechanism and clamping means may be of different constructions. The feed distributor cum regulator, feed sensor and drive arrangement also may be of different constructions. The cabinet of the mill is optional. Sprocket and chain drive may be used instead of pulleys and V-belt. Such variations are to be construed and understood to be within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
