Ampholytic copolymer, production thereof, and use of the same<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to an ampholytic copolymer, to a process for its preparation, to cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions which comprise at least one such ampholytic copolymer, and to further uses of these copolymers.<br>
Polymers with a relatively large number of ionically dissociatable groups in the main chain and/or a side chain are referred to as polyelectrolytes. If these polymers have both anionogenic/anionic groups and also cationogenic/cationic groups, then these are amphoteric polyelectrolytes or ampholytic polymers. Ampholytic polymers with a sufficient number of dissociatable groups are water-soluble or water-dispersible and have found diverse applications in the field of coatings, paper auxiliaries, hygiene compositions, in the manufacture of textiles, and especially in pharmacy and cosmetics.<br>
Cosmetically and pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers serve, for example in soaps, creams and lotions, as formulating agents, e.g. as thickener, foam stabilizer or water absorbent, or else to alleviate the irritative effect of other ingredients or to improve the dermal application of active ingredients. Their task in hair cosmetics consists in influencing the properties of the hair. In pharmacy, they serve, for example, as coatings or binders for solid medicaments. For hair cosmetics, film-forming polymers with ionic groups are used, for example, as conditioners for improving the dry and wet combability, the feel to the touch, the shine and the appearance of the hair, and also for imparting antistatic properties to the hair. Depending on the intended application, water-soluble polymers with cationic or anionic functionalities are used here. Thus, polymers with cationic functional groups have a high affinity to the negatively charged surface of the hair as a result of their structure. Polymers with anionic functionalities, such as, for example, if appropriate crosslinked polyacrylic acid, serve, for example, as thickeners, in addition polymers containing carboxylate groups are used, for example, for setting hairstyles.<br>
The provision of products with a complex profile of properties often presents difficulties. For example, there is a need for polymers for cosmetic and other compositions which have good film-forming properties and at the same time allow the rheological properties of the compositions to be adjusted. In addition, esthetic requirements are increasingly being made on cosmetic and pharmaceutical products by the consumer. For example, with products of this type, a preference for clear, opaque formulations in the form of gels is currently observed. In many cases, the desired profile of properties can only be<br><br>
achieved by using a plurality of polymers with ionic groups. However, the various polymers are often incompatible with one another, which can, for example, lead to undesired salting out. There is therefore a need for cosmetically and pharmaceutically compatible ampholytic polymers which are suitable, when used as the sole polymer component, for providing a certain profile of properties with regard to film formation and rheology and/or which are highly compatible with a large number of different polyelectrolytes.<br>
Furthermore, active substances for cosmetics, but also for medicaments, hygiene products, material protection etc., i.e. substances which develop an effect even at low concentration, e.g. a cosmetic effect on the skin or the hair, pharmacological effect within an organism etc., are often formulated and used in the form of aqueous active substance preparations. Alternatively, formulation and administration is also possible in solid form, e.g. as powder or compact (tablet, etc.), in which case, however, transportation to the actual site of action involves conversion to an aqueous form. A principal problem with aqueous active substance preparations is the low solubility in water of many active ingredients, which is often less than 5 g/l at 23Â°C/1013 mbar. Here too, there is a continual need for cosmetically and pharmaceutically compatible ampholytic polymers which serve at the same time as solubilizers for components which are insoluble or only slightly soluble in water.<br>

Polymers which comprise, in copolymerized form, at least one cationic compound chosen from N-vinylimidazole compounds, N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]acryiamide, N-[3-(dimethyl-amino)propyl]methacrylamide and mixtures thereof are not described.<br><br>
There continues to be a need for polymers which, besides good film-forming properties, also allow the rheological properties of the products to be adjusted, meaning that they can be formulated, for example, in the form of mousses or gels. Also desirable are polymers which are suitable as solubilizers for components which are insoluble or only slightly soluble in water and/or are characterized by good compatibility with other formulation constituents. In addition, polymers for use in hair cosmetics should be characterized by further advantageous properties, such as for example the production of elastic hairstyles with simultaneously strong hold even at high atmospheric humidity, good ability to be washed out and by good feel of the hair treated therewith.<br>
The invention firstly provides an ampholytic copolymer A) obtainable by free-radical copoiymerization of<br>
a)	at least one compound with a free-radically polymerizable, a,p-ethylenically unsaturated double bond and at least one anionogenic and/or anionic group per molecule,<br>
b)	at least one compound which is chosen from N-vinylimidazole compounds, N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]acrylamide, N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]methacrylamide and mixtures thereof,<br>
c)	at least one free-radically polymerizable crosslinking compound which comprises at least two a,p-ethylenicaily unsaturated double bonds per molecule.<br>
In particular at least part of the compounds a) and b) is used in the form of a monomer pair, where the molar ratio of anionogenic groups of component a) to cationogenic groups of component b) is about 1:1.<br>
The ampholytic copolymers A) according to the invention can be prepared by conventional polymerization processes, e.g. by solution polymerization, emulsion polymerization, suspension polymerization or bulk polymerization. Copolymers with particularly advantageous properties, e.g. with generally higher molecular weights and a better capability as rheology modifiers (specifically as thickeners) than are achieved by conventional polymerization processes are achieved by the preparation in accordance with the method of precipitation polymerization. A preferred embodiment of the invention are therefore ampholytic copolymers A) which are obtainable by free-radical copoiymerization in accordance with the method of precipitation polymerization. In a specific embodiment, for the production of the copolymers according to the invention, use is made of at least two free-radical initiators whose decomposition temperatures and/or whose half-lives at a certain polymerization temperature are<br><br>
different from one another. In this case, copolymers with particularly small residual monomer contents can be achieved. This is the case particularly if the initiator which decomposes at the higher temperature is added before completion, preferably before the start of the precipitation of the polymer.<br>
In the precipitation polymerization, the monomers used are soluble in the reaction medium (monomer, solvent), but the corresponding polymer is not. The polymer which forms becomes unsoluble under the chosen polymerization conditions and precipitates out of the reaction mixture.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the expression alkyl comprises straight-chain and branched alkyl groups. Suitable short-chain alkyl groups are, for example, straight-chain or branched CrCr-alkyl groups, preferably Ci-Ce-alkyI groups and particularly preferably Ci-C4-alkyl groups. These include, in particular, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, 2-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 1-methylbutyl, 2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, 1,2-dimethylpropyl, 1,1-dim ethyl propyl, 2,2-dimethyl-propyl, 1-ethylpropyl, n-hexyl, 1-methylpentyl, 2-methylpentyl, 3-methylpentyl, 4-methylpentyl, 1,2-dimethylbutyl, 1,3-dimethylbutyl, 2,3-dimethylbutyl, 1,1-dimethylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, 3,3-dimethylbutyl, 1,1,2-trimethylpropyl, 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl, 1-ethylbutyl, 2-ethylbutyl, 1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl, n-heptyl, 2-heptyl, 3-heptyl, 2-ethylpentyl, 1-propylbutyl, octyl etc.<br>
Suitable longer-chain Cs-Cso-alkyI groups and Ca-Cao-alkenyl groups are straight-chain and branched alkyl and alkenyl groups. Preference is given here to predominantly linear alkyl radicals, as also occur in natural or synthetic fatty acids and fatty alcohols and in oxo alcohols, which may, if appropriate, additionally be mono-, di- or polyunsaturated. These include, for example, n-hexyl(ene), n-heptyl(ene), n-octyl(ene), n-nonyl(ene), n-decyl(ene), n-undecyl(ene), n-dodecyl(ene), n-tridecyl(ene), n-tetradecyl{ene), n-pentadecyl(ene), n-hexadecyl(ene), n-heptadecyl(ene), n-octadecyl(ene), n-nonadecyl(ene), arachinyl(ene), behenyl(ene), lignocerinyl(ene), melissinyl(ene), etc.<br>
CycloalkyI is preferably Cs-Cs-cycloalkyI, such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl.<br>

The copolymers A) according to the invention can advantageously be formulated as gels under normal conditions (20Â°C). "Gel-like consistency" is shown by formulations which have a higher viscosity than a liquid and which are self-supporting, i.e. which retain a shape imparted to them without a shape-stabilizing covering. In contrast to solid formulations, gel-like formulations can, however, easily be deformed under the application of shear forces. The viscosity of the gel-like compositions is preferably in a range from greater than 600 to about 60 000 mPas, particularly preferably from 6000 to 30 000 mPas. The gels are preferably hair gels.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, water-soluble monomers and polymers are understood as meaning monomers and polymers which dissolve in water at 20Â°C in an amount of at least 1 g/l. Water-dispersible monomers and polymers are understood as meaning monomers and polymers which disintegrate into dispersible particles under the application of shear forces, for example by stirring. Hydrophilic monomers are preferably water-soluble or at least water-dispersible. The copolymers A) according to the invention are generally water-soluble.<br>
The ampholytic copolymers A) according to the invention have both anionogenic and/or anionic groups, and also cationogenic and/or cationic groups. To prepare them, preferably part of the monomers a) and b) is used together, i.e. in the form of a monomer pair ("monomer salt"). In this monomer composition, the molar ratio of anionogenic and anionic groups of component a) to cationogenic and cationic groups of component b) is about 1:1 (i.e. monovalent monomers are essentially used in equimolar amounts). The monomer pairs can be prepared separately prior to being used for the polymerization. However, preference is given to the "in situ" preparation of the monomer pairs through joint use (e.g. joint feed) during the preparation of the copolymers.<br>
Preferably, the amount of compounds used for the polymerization in the monomer pair is at least 1% by weight, preferably at least 2% by weight, in particular at least 3% by weight.<br>
Further monomers with ionogenic/ionic groups which are not used in the form of the monomer pair for the polymerization are preferably used in initially uncharged form, i.e. with anionogenic or cationogenic groups. If desired, for the preparation of the ampholytic copolymers according to the invention it is possible to also use already<br><br>
charged monomers, i.e. monomers with anionic and cationic groups, instead of uncharged monomers or in addition to uncharged monomers or in addition to the monomer pairs. The counterions which these monomers carry are then preferably derived from acids or bases, as are described below for adjusting the pH during the polymerization or of the polymers obtained. Cationic monomers are, in addition, used in partially or completely quaternized form.<br>
Preferably, the copolymers A) have a clear excess of anionogenic/anionic groups or of cationogenic/cationic groups. In a specific embodiment, for the copolymerization, monomers with ionogenic or ionic groups are used in amounts such that the copolymer A) has a molar excess of anionogenic/anionic groups compared with cationogenic/cationic groups or a molar excess of cationogenic/cationic groups compared with anionogenic/anionic groups of at least 1.2:1, particularly preferably at least 1.4:1, in particular at least 2:1, especially at least 2.5:1.<br>

In a specific embodiment, all of the abovementioned cationic ampholytic copolymers A) are subjected to partial or complete quaternization. Suitable quaternizing agents are those specified below.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the free-radical copolymerization of the abovementioned components a) to c) and, if present, d) to g) is carried out in the presence of at least one polyether-containing compound which has no copolymerizable double bond. Here, specific ampholytic copolymers having advantageous properties are obtained. This can be attributed, for example, to the effect of the polyether component as protective colloid or emulsifier. This can, for example, also result from an at least partial grafting onto the polyether component as graft base. However, mechanisms other than grafting are also conceivable. The ampholytic copolymers according to the invention comprise, quite<br><br>
generally, the process products of the free-radical copolymerization, which are understood as meaning, for example, pure graft polymers, mixtures of graft polymers with ungrafted compounds of the polyether component, and any desired mixtures.<br>
Preferably, the amount of polyether component used (if present) is 0.1 to 50% by weight, particularly preferably 1 to 25% by weight, based on the total weight of the components used for the polymerization.<br>
Suitable polyether-containing compounds are, for example, water-soluble or water-dispersible nonionic polymers which have alkylene oxide repeat units. The fraction of alkylene oxide repeat units is preferably at least 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the compound. Suitable polyether-containing compounds are, for example, polyalkylene glycols, as are usually also used as nonionic surfactants. Suitable polyalkylene glycols generally have a number-average molecular weight in the range from about 150 to 100 000, preferably 300 to 50 000, particularly preferably 500 to 40 000. Suitable polyalkylene glycols are, for example, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, polytetrahydrofurans and alkylene oxide copolymers. Suitable alkylene oxides for the preparation of alkylene oxide copolymers are, for example, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, epichlorohydrin, 1,2- and 2,3-butylene oxide. The alkylene oxide copolymers can comprise the copolymerized alkylene oxide units in random distribution or in the form of blocks. Advantageously, homopolymers of ethylene oxide or copolymers which comprise ethylene oxide are used. Preferably, the fraction of repeat units derived from ethylene oxide is 40 to 99% by weight. Of suitability are, for example, copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, copolymers of ethylene oxide and butylene oxide, and copolymers of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and at least one butylene oxide.<br>
The copolymers A1) are prepared in accordance with customary processes known to the person skilled in the art, e.g. by solution polymerization, precipitation polynnerization, suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization. The WAV polymerization in water with a suitable displacing agent, e.g. a salt, such as NaCi, is also suitable.<br>
Preferred solvents for the solution polymerization are aqueous solvents, such as water and mixtures of water with water-miscible solvents, for example alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, n-hexanol and cyclohexanol, and glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and butylene glycol, and the methyl or ethyl ethers of the dihydric alcohols, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, polyethylene glycols with number-average molecular weights up to about 3000, glycerol and dioxane. Particular preference is given to the<br><br>
polymerization in water or a water/aicolioi mixture, for example in a water/ethanol mixture. The polymerization temperatures in the case of solution polymerization are preferably in a range from about 30 to 120Â°C, particularly preferably 40 to 100Â°C.<br>
The ampholytic copolymers A) are particularly preferably prepared by precipitation polymerization.<br>
The precipitation polymerization preferably takes place in an anhydrous, aprotic solvent or solvent mixture, preferably in ethyl acetate and/or n-butyl acetate. The precipitation polymerization preferably takes place at a temperature in the range from 70 to 140Â°C, preferably 75 to 100Â°C, in particular from 80 to 95Â°C. The resulting polymer particles precipitate out of the reaction solution and can be isolated by customary methods, such as filtration using subatmospheric pressure. For the precipitation polymerization it is possible to use surface-active, polymeric compounds, preferably based on polysiioxanes. In the case of precipitation polymerization, the polymers obtained usually have higher molecular weights than those in the case of solution polymerization.<br>
The polymerization is usually carried out under atmospheric pressure, although it can also proceed under reduced or elevated pressure. A suitable pressure range is between 1 and 5 bar.<br>
To prepare the polymers, the monomers can be polymerized with the help of initiators which form free radicals.<br>
Initiators for the free-radical polymerization which can be used are the peroxo and/or azo compounds customary for this purpose, for example alkali metal or ammonium peroxydisulfates, diacetyl peroxide, dibenzoyi peroxide, succinyl peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butyl perbenzoate, tert-butyl perpivalate, tert-butyl peroxy-2-ethyl-hexanoate, tert-butyl permaleate, cumene hydroperoxide, diisopropyl peroxydicar-bamate, bis(o-toloyl) peroxide, didecanoyi peroxide, dioctanoyi peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, tert-butyl perisobutyrate, tert-butyl peracetate, di-tert-amyl peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile, azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride or 2-2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitri!e). Also suitable are initiator mixtures or redox initiator systems, such as, for example, ascorbic acid/iron (I I) sulfate/sodium peroxodisulfate, tert-butyl hydroperoxide/sodium disulfite, tert-butyl hydroperoxide/sodium hydroxymethanesulfinate, H2O2/CU'.<br>
In a specific embodiment, for the preparation of the copolymers according to the invention, use is made of at least two free-radical initiators which permit an essentially<br><br>
independent initiation in at least two phases. In this case, copolymers with particularly low residual monomer contents can be achieved.<br>
Preferably, for the copolymerization, at least two initiators are used whose decomposition temperatures are different from one another by at least 10Â°C. Within the scope of the invention, the decomposition temperature is defined as the temperature at which 50% of the molecules decompose into free radicals within 2.5 hours. Preferably, the copolymerization in the case of this procedure takes place until conclusion of the precipitation of the copolymer at a temperature greater than or equal to the lower decomposition temperature and less than the higher decomposition temperature, and, after the precipitation, a further reaction takes place at a temperature greater than or equal to the higher decomposition temperature.<br>
Preferably, the method according to the invention comprises a first polymerization phase at a first polymerization temperature and a second polymerization phase at a second polymerization temperature above the first polymerization temperature, where for the polymerization at least two initiators are used whose half-lives at the first polymerization temperature differ in such a way that at least one of these initiators decomposes into free radicals during the first polymerization phase and at least one of these initiators essentially does not decompose into free radicals during the first polymerization phase and decomposes into free radicals during the second polymerization phase. Preferably, in the case of this procedure, the second polymerization phase starts essentially after precipitation of the copolymer. "Essentially" after precipitation of the copolymer is understood as meaning that the copolymer is present preferably to at least 80% by weight, preferably to at least 90% by weight, in particular at least 95% by weight, based on the total weight of the copolymer, in precipitated form.<br>
The half-life of an initiator can be determined by customary methods known to the person skilled in the art, as described, for example, in the publication "Initiators for high polymers", Akzo Nobel, No. 10737. The half-life of the first polymerization initiator at the first polymerization temperature and of the second polymerization initiator at the second polymerization temperature is preferably in a range from about 1 minute to 3 hours, particularly preferably 5 minutes to 2.5 hours. If desired, shorter half-lives of, for example, 1 second to 1 minute, or half-lives longer than 3 hours can be used provided it is ensured that the initiator(s) decomposing at the higher temperature essentially decompose(s) into free radicals during the second polymerization phase.<br>
In addition to the first and second polymerization phase, further polymerization phases can be applied at polymerization temperatures different therefrom. Thus, it is, for<br><br>
example, possible to carry out a first polymerization phase at a first polymerization temperature which is chosen so that a controlled polymerization (i.e. e.g. avoiding an undesired temperature increase as a result of the heat of reaction, an excessively high reaction rate, etc.) takes place. An afterpolymerization can then, for example, follow at a temperature which is above the first and below the second polymerization temperature and is chosen so that the initiator(s) decomposing at the higher temperature does not essentially decompose into free radicals. Following completion of this afterpolymerization, to which, if desired, the initiator decomposing at the lower temperature and/or another initiator decomposing under the conditions of the afterpolymerization can also be added, the second polymerization phase can then follow.<br>
Preferably, the initiator system used comprises at least two initiators whose decomposition temperatures differ from one another by at least 15Â°C.<br>
The initiator decomposing at the lower temperature preferably has a decomposition temperature of from 50 to 100Â°C.<br>
The initiator decomposing at the higher temperature preferably has a decomposition temperature of from 80 to 150Â°C.<br>
Preferably, the initiator decomposing at the higher temperature is initially introduced at the start of the copolymerization or is added before or during the precipitation of the copolymer.<br>
Preferably, the initiator decomposing at the higher temperature is initially introduced at the start of the copolymerization or is added before the precipitation of the copolymer.<br>
In a preferred initiator combination, the initiator decomposing at the lower temperature is TrigonoxÂ® EHP (bis(2-ethylhexyl)peroxydicarbonate, CAS-No. 16111-62-9) and the initiator decomposing at the higher temperature is chosen from tert-butyl peroxypivalate (e.g. Luperox 11 M75 from Atochem), tert-butyl peroctoate, lauroyl peroxide (LPO, CAS-No. 105-74-8) or2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)hexane (TrigonoxÂ® 101).<br>
To achieve the purest polymers possible, the polymers can, for example, be subjected to a washing step with a suitable solvent, e.g. the solvent also used for the polymerization.<br>
The anionogenic groups (acid groups) of the copolymers A) can be partially or completely neutralized with a base. Bases which can be used for the neutralization of<br><br>
the polymers are alkali metal bases such as sodium hydroxide solution, potassium hydroxide solution, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium carbonate or potassium hydrogencarbonate and alkaline earth metal bases, such as calcium hydroxide, calcium oxide, magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate, and amines. Suitable amines are, for example, Ci-Ce-alkylamines, preferably n-propylamine and n-butylamine, dialkylamines, preferably diethylpropylamine and dipropylmethyl-amine, trialkylamines, preferably triethylamine and triisopropyiamine. Preference is given to amino alcohols, e.g. trialkanoiamines, such astriethanolamine, alkyl-dialkanolamines, such as methyl- or ethyldiethanolamine and dialkylalkanolamines, such as dimethylethanolamine, and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol. For use in hair-treatment compositions in particular, NaOH, KOH, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, 2-amino-2-ethylpropane-1,3-diol, diethylaminopropylamine and triisopropanolamine have proven useful for neutralizing the polymers comprising acid groups. The neutralization of the acid groups can also be carried out using mixtures of two or more bases, e.g. mixtures of sodium hydroxide solution and triisopropanolamine. Depending on the intended use, the neutralization can be carried out partially or completely.<br>
Charged cationic groups can be produced from the present cationogenic nitrogen-containing groups either by protonation, e.g. with mono- or polybasic carboxylic acids, such as lactic acid or tartaric acid, or with mineral acids, such as phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid, or by quaternization, e.g. with alkylating agents, such as Ci-C4-alkyl halides or sulfates. Examples of such alkylating agents are ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, methyl chloride, methyl bromide, dimethyl sulfate and diethyl sulfate.<br>
If the copolymers A) according to the invention are to be both quaternized and also neutralized, then the quaternization is preferably carried out first, followed by the neutralization.<br>
The ampholytic copolymers A) according to the invention are advantageously suitable for modifying the rheological properties of aqueous active substance or effect substance compositions. These may, quite generally, be for example cosmetic compositions, pharmaceutical compositions, hygiene products, paints, compositions for the paper industry and the textile industry. In a preferred embodiment, the compositions comprise at least one water-soluble or at least water-dispersible active substance or effect substance. The copolymers A) according to the invention are of course also suitable for modifying the rheological properties of compositions which comprise at least one water-insoluble (hydrophobic) active substance or effect substance.<br><br>
For the purposes of the present invention, "modifying rheological properties" is understood in the wide sense. The copolymers A) used according to the invention are generally suitable for thickening the consistency of aqueous compositions within a wide range. Depending on the basic consistency of the liquid compositions, flow properties from low viscosity to solid (in the sense of "no longer flowable") can generally be achieved depending on the amount of the copolymer A) used. "Modifying rheological properties" is therefore understood, inter alia, as meaning the increase in the viscosity of liquids, the improvement in the thixotropy properties of gels, the solidification of gels and waxes etc. The compositions according to the invention are preferably suitable for the formulation of aqueous cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Preferably, the compositions of the copolymers A) are generally clear. Thus, formulations, in particular cosmetic formulations, can advantageously be colored without impairment by the intrinsic color of the compositions. Furthermore, the compositions can be formulated in the form of opaque to clear gels.<br>
The ampholytic copolymers A) according to the invention are specifically suitable as rheology modifiers with properties which can be controlled via the pH. Thus, for example, the abovementioned anionic ampholytic copolymers A) are suitable as pH-switchable thickeners for a pH range of greater than or equal to 6. The abovementioned cationic ampholytic copolymers A) are suitable as pH-switchabie thickeners for a pH range of less than or equal to 6.5. Quaternized ampholytic copolymers A) which essentially have no protonatable groups are suitable as rheology modifiers in a pH range from about 2 to 10 irrespective of the pH.<br>
The ampholytic copolymers A) according to the invention are also specifically suitable as rheology modifiers for salt-containing compositions.<br>
Advantageously, the ampholytic copolymers A) according to the invention also act as film-forming and/or conditioning rheology modifiers. They are thus suitable specifically for cosmetic and dermatological compositions, specifically in hair-setting compositions as "setting thickeners" and in hair care compositions as "conditioning thickeners".<br>
The ampholytic copolymers A) are suitable both for the preparation of homogeneous-phase aqueous compositions, and also for the formulation of heterogeneous-phase compositions which additionally comprise at least one water-insoluble (hydrophobic) liquid or solid compound. "Homogeneous-phase compositions" have only a single phase irrespective of the number of their constituents. "Heterogeneous-phase compositions" are disperse systems of two or more immiscible components. These include solid/liquid, liquid/liquid and solid/liquid/iiquid compositions, such as dispersions and emulsions, e.g. 0/W and W/0 formulations which have at least one of the oil or fat<br><br>
components described in more detail below and water as immiscible phases. In principle, the copolymers A) can be used either in the water phase or in the oil phase. In general, heterogeneous-phase liquid/liquid compositions comprise the copolymers A) essentially in the water phase.<br>
The copolymers A) according to the invention are also suitable as solubilizer for essentially water-insoluble compounds. The invention thus further provides the use of an ampholytic copolymer A), as defined above, as solubilizer for the preparation of aqueous formulations of active substances and effect substances which have a solubility in water at 25Â°C and 1013 mbar below 10 g/l.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that the copolymers A) according to the invention are advantageously suitable as protective colloid. The invention thus further provides the use of an ampholytic copolymer A), as defined above, as protective colloid during free-radical aqueous emulsion polymerization.<br>
On the basis of the abovementioned properties, the copolymers A) according to the invention are very generally suitable for the preparation of active substance or effect substance compositions comprising<br>
A)	at least one ampholytic copolymer, as defined above,<br>
B)	at least one active substance or effect substance and<br>
C)	if appropriate at least one further active substance or auxiliary different from A) and B).<br>
Active substances for cosmetics, medicaments, hygiene compositions, textile-treatment compositions etc., i.e. substances which generally develop an effect even at low concentration, e.g. a cosmetic effect on skin and/or hair, a pharmacological effect within an organism, a cleaning and/or disinfectant effect, a modification of a textile, e.g. a crease-free finishing, and also effect substances, which impart a certain property to living beings or inanimate substrates, for example color pigments for make-up or emulsion paints, are often formulated and applied in the form of aqueous active substance or effect substance compositions.<br>
The active substance and effect substance compositions comprise the polymer component A) preferably in a fraction of from about 0.001 to 50% by weight, particularly preferably 0.01 to 30% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 20% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br><br>
The components B) and C) are chosen according to the desired field of use of the composition. Besides components which are typical of the field of use (e.g. certain pharmaceutical active substances), they are chosen from carriers, excipients, emulsifiers, surfactants, preservatives, fragrances, thickeners different from component A), polymers, gel formers, dyes, pigments, photoprotective agents, consistency regulators, antioxidants, antifoams, antistats, resins, solvents, solubility promoters, neutralizing agents, stabilizers, sterilizing agents, propellants, drying agents, opacifiers, etc.<br>
The compositions preferably have a carrier component C) which is chosen from water, hydrophilic components, hydrophobic components and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable hydrophilic carriers C) are, for example, mono-, di- or polyhydric alcohols having preferably 1 to 8 carbon atoms, such as ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, etc.<br>

As already detailed, the copolymers A) are advantageously suitable for stabilizing water-insoluble (or only slightly water-soluble) active substances and effect substances B) in aqueous phase and therefore allow the preparation of aqueous formulations of such active substances and effect substances. They are also suitable for preparing solid formulations of these active substances and effect substances, which can be converted to an aqueous formulation, e.g. commercial form, administration form or active form. This can also take place only after the solid composition has been applied (e.g. in the digestive tract of an organism, etc.).<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, the "solubility improvement" achieved with the polymers A) used according to the invention is therefore understood in the wide sense. It includes, firstly, the stabilization of heterogeneous systems in which the active substance is present as emulsified and/or dispersed phase (disperse phase) in an aqueous medium as continuous phase, it also includes the stabilization of transitional stages to homogeneous solutions, such as colloidal solutions, etc. ranging to molecularly disperse solutions. It also includes an improvement in solubility in the sense of a solubilization during which the sparingly water-soluble or water-insoluble substances are converted into clear, at most opalescent aqueous solutions. Finally, it also includes the ability to form so-called "solid solutions".<br>
A low (poor) solubility means within the scope of this invention a solubility of the active substance or effect substance in water of less than 10 g/l, in particular of less than 1 g/l and specifically of less than 0.1 g/l at 25Â°C and 1013 mbar.<br>
The aqueous active substance compositions of water-insoluble active substances or effect substances prepared using the copolymers A) comprise, besides an aqueous medium as continuous phase, at least one active substance and/or effect substance B) which is dispersed or solubilized in the continuous phase and which has a solubility in water at 25Â°C/1013 mbar of less than 10 g/l, in particular of less than 1 g/l and specifically of less than 0.1 g/l, and at least one ampholytic copolymer A).<br><br>
The active substance is present in the continuous aqueous phase in extremely finely divided form. This can, for example, be attributed to the fact that the active substance forms aggregates in the aqueous phase with the polymers A). These aggregates generally have average particle sizes of less than 1 |jm, often of less than 500 nm, in particular of less than 400 nm, specifically of less than 300 nm. Depending on the nature of the polymer and of the active substance or effect substance, and depending on the concentration ratios, the aggregates can also be so small that they are no longer present in the form of detectable discrete particles, but in dissolved form (particle size 
The particle sizes given here are weight-average particle sizes, as can be ascertained by dynamic light scattering. Methods for this are known to the person skilled in the art, for example from H. Wiese in D. Distler, Wassrige Poiymerdispersionen [Aqueous polymer dispersions], Wiley-VCH 1999, chapter 4.2.1, p. 40ff and literature cited therein, and H. Auweter, D. Horn, J. Colloid Interf. Sci. 105 (1985) 399, D. Lilge, D. Horn, Colloid Polym. Sci. 269 (1991) 704 or H. Wiese, D. Horn, J. Chem. Rhys. 94 (1991)6429.<br>

In a specific embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise at least one pharmaceutically acceptable active substance B) which has a solubility in water at 25Â°C and 1013 mbar of less than 10 g/i. For this, the copolymers A) serve as solubilizers for the sparingly soluble active substance(s). The formulation base of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention preferably comprises pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries. Pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries are auxiliaries which are known for use in the field of pharmaceuticals, food technology and related fields, in particular those listed in the relevant pharmacopeias (e.g., DAB, Ph. Eur., BP, NF), and other auxiliaries, the properties of which do not preclude a physiological application.<br>
Suitable auxiliaries can be: lubhcants, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, antiirritatives, chelating agents, emulsion stabilizers, film-forming agents, gel formers, odor-masking agents, resins, hydrocolloids, solvents, solubility promoters, neutralizing agents, permeation accelerators, pigments, quaternary ammonium compounds, refatting and superfatting agents, ointment, cream or oil base substances, silicone derivatives, stabilizers, sterilants, propellants, drying agents, opacifiers, thickeners, waxes, softeners or white oils.

In order to prepare pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention, the active substances can be mixed or diluted with a suitable auxiliary (excipient). Excipients can be solid, semiliquid or liquid materials which can act as vehicle, carrier or medium for the active substance. The admixing of additional auxiliaries is carried out, if desired, in a way known to a person skilled in the art. It relates in this connection in particular to aqueous solutions or solubilizates for oral or parenteral application. In addition, the copolymers to be used according to the invention are also suitable for use in oral administration forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders or solutions. In this connection, they can make the sparingly soluble pharmaceutical available with increased bioavailability. In the parenteral application, emulsions, for example fatty emulsions, can also be used in addition to solubilizates. The copolymers A) according to the invention are also suitable for this purpose, in order to process a sparingly soluble pharmaceutical.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of the abovementioned kind can be obtained by processing the copolymers A) to be used according to the invention with pharmaceutical active substances using conventional methods and with the use of l<nown and new active substances.></nown>
The use according to the invention can additionally comprise pharmaceutical auxiliaries and/or diluents. Cosoivents, stabilizers and preservatives are especially mentioned as auxiliaries.<br>
The pharmaceutical active substances used are substances which are soluble or insoluble or slightly soluble in water. According to DAB 9 (German Pharmacopeia), the solubility of pharmaceutical active substances is categorized as follows: slightly soluble (soluble in 30 to 100 parts of solvent); sparingly soluble (soluble in 100 to 1000 parts of solvent); virtually insoluble (soluble in more than 10 000 parts of solvent). The active substances can in this connection come from any range indicated.<br>
Particular preference is given to those of the abovementioned pharmaceutical compositions relating to formulations which can be applied parenterally.<br>
The content of copolymer A) in the pharmaceutical compositions is, depending on the active substance, in the range from 0.01 to 50% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 40% by weight, particularly preferably 1 to 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
In principle, all pharmaceutical active substances and prodrugs are suitable for the preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention. These include benzodiazepines, antihypertensives, vitamins, cytostatics, in particular taxol, anesthetics, neuroleptics, antidepressants, antibiotics, antimycotics, fungicides, chemotherapeutics, urologies, thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors, sulfonamides, spasmolytics, hormones, immunoglobulins, sera, thyroid therapeutic agents, psychopharmacological agents, antiparkinsonians and other antihyperkinetic agents, ophthalmics, neuropathy preparations, calcium metabolism regulators, muscle relaxants, narcotics, antilipemics, hepatic therapeutic agents, coronary agents, cardiacs, immunotherapeutics, regulatory peptides and their inhibitors, hypnotics, sedatives, gynecological agents, antigouts, fibrinolytic agents, enzyme preparations and transport proteins, enzyme inhibitors, emetics, circulation-promoting agents, diuretics, diagnostics, corticoids, cholinergics, bile duct therapeutics, antiasthmatics, broncholytics, beta-receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, antiarteriosclerotics, antiinflammatories, anticoagulants, antihypotensives, antihypoglycemics, antihypertonics, antifibrinolytics, antiepileptics, antiemetics,<br><br>
antidotes, antidiabetics, antiarrhythmics, antianemics, antiallergics, anthelmintics, analgesics, analeptics, aldosterone antagonists and slimming agents. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical active substances are in particular the active substances mentioned in paragraphs 0105 to 0131 of US 2003/0157170.<br>
An additional aspect of the present invention relates to the use of the ampholytic copolymers A) as solubilizers in molecularly disperse systems. Solid dispersions, that is homogeneous extremely finely disperse phases of two or more solids, and their special case of "solid solutions" (molecularly disperse systems), and their use in pharmaceutical technology, are generally known (cf. Chiou and Riegelmann, J. Pharm. Sci., 1971, 60, 1281 - 1300). In addition, the present invention also relates to solid solutions comprising at least one copolymer A) to be used according to the invention.<br>
The preparation of solid solutions can be carried out with the help of melting processes or according to the solution process.<br>
The copolymers according to the invention are suitable as polymeric auxiliary, i.e. solubilizer for the preparation of such solid dispersions or solid solutions.<br>
According to the melting process, for example, an active substance B) and the copolymer A) can be weighed out and mixed in the desired ratio, e.g., in equal parts. A tumbler mixer, for example, is suitable for the mixing. The mixture can subsequently be extruded, e.g. in a twin-screw extruder. The diameter of the cooled product strand thus obtained, consisting of a solid solution of the chosen active substance in the chosen copolymer to be used according to the invention, is dependent on the diameter of the perforation of the perforated plates of the extruder. Cylindrical particles can be obtained by cutting the cooled product strands using a rotating knife, the length of the particles depending on the distance between the perforated plate and the knife. The mean diameter of the cylindrical particles is as a rule approximately 1000 to approximately 3000 |im and the length is as a rule approximately 2000 to approximately 5000 nm. Larger extrudates can be comminuted in a downstream step.<br>
Alternatively, a solid solution can also be prepared in the solution process. For this, the active substance B) and the copolymer A) are usually dissolved in a suitable solvent. Subsequently, the solution is usually poured into a suitable mold and the solvent is removed, for example by drying. The drying conditions are advantageously chosen according to the properties of the active substance (e.g., thermal lability) and solvent (e.g., boiling point).<br><br>
Taking into consideration the characteristics of the material, the molded article produced or the extrudate, for example, can be comminuted with a suitable mill (e.g., pin mill). The solid solution is advantageously comminuted down to a mean particle size of less than approximately 2000 |am, preferably less than approximately 1000 |im and particularly preferably less than approximately 500 pm.<br>
The bulk material produced can now be processed, with suitable auxiliaries, to give a tableting mixture or to give a capsule feedstock. The tableting is advantageously carried out so that tablets with a hardness of greater than approximately 35 N, preferably greater than approximately 60 N, particularly preferably approximately 80 to approximately 100 N, are obtained.<br>
Like conventional formulations, the formulations thus obtained can, if necessary, be coated with suitable coating materials in order to achieve resistance to gastric juices, delayed release, masking of taste, and the like.<br>
Besides the use in pharmacy, the copolymers A) to be used according to the invention are also suitable in the food sector for modifying the rheological properties and/or as solubilizers for sparingly water-soluble or water-insoluble nutrients, auxiliaries or additives, such as, e.g., fat-soluble vitamins or carotenoids. Mention may be made, as examples, of clear drinks colored with carotenoids. The present invention consequently also provides food preparations comprising at least one of the copolymers A) to be used according to the invention. In the context of the present invention, the food preparations are also to be understood as including food supplements, such as, e.g., preparations comprising food dyes, and dietary foods. Moreover, the specified copolymers A) are also suitable for modifying the rheological properties and/or as solubilizers for feed supplements for animal food.<br>
Furthermore, the ampholytic copolymers A) are suitable for the preparation of aqueous preparations of food supplements such as water-insoluble vitamins and provitamins, such as vitamin A, vitamin A acetate, vitamin D, vitamin E, tocopherol derivatives, such as tocopherol acetate, and vitamin K.<br>

A list of suitable dispersion dyes is given, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 4th edition, Vol. 10, pp. 155-165 (see also Vol. 7, p. 585ff - Anthraquinone Dyes; Vol. 8, p. 244ff - Azo Dyes; Vol. 9, p. 313ff - Quinophthalone Dyes).
