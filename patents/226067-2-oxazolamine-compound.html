				<td>This invention relates to a 2-oxazolamine compound. This invention also relates to 5-HT2B receptor antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and the use of such compounds and compositions to treat various diseases.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Serotonin, also referred to as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a neurotransmitter with mixed and complex pharmacological characteristics. 5-HT acts via a number of discrete 5-HT receptors. Currently, fourteen subtypes of serotonin receptor are recognised and delineated into seven families, 5-HT1 to 5-HT7. Within the 5-HT2 family, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C subtypes are known to exist. The nomenclature and classification of 5-HT receptors has been reviewed by Martin and Humphrey, Neuropharm., 33,261-273 (1994) and Hoyer, et al., Pharm. Rev., 46, 157-203 (1994).<br>
There is evidence to suggest a role for 5-HT2B receptors in a number of medical disorders, and therefore 5-HT2B receptor antagonists are likely to have a beneficial effect on patients suffering these disorders. They include, but are not limited to: disorders of the Gl tract, and especially disorders involving altered motility, and particularly irritable bowel syndrome (WO 01/08668); disorders of gastric motility, dyspepsia, GERD, tachygastna ; migraine/neurogenic pain (WO 97/44326) ; pain (US 5 958 934) ; anxiety (WO 97/44326); depression (WO 97/44326) ; benign prostatic hyperplasia (US 5 952 331); sleep disorder (WO 97/44326) ; panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcoholism hypertension, anorexia nervosa, and priapism (WO 97/44326); asthma and obstructive airway disease (US 5 952 331);<br>
 sleep disorder (WO 97/44326); panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, alcoholism, hypertension, anorexia nervosa, and priapism (WO 97/44326); asthma and obstructive airway disease (US 5 952 331);<br>
incontinence and bladder dysfunction (WO 96/24351); disorders of the uterus, such as dysmenorrhoea, pre-term labour, post-partum remodelling, endometriosis and fibrosis; pulmonary hypertension (Launay, J.M., et al., Nature Medicine, 8(10), 1129-1135 (2002)).<br>
WO 97/44326 describes aryl pyrimidine derivatives and their use as selective 5-HT2B antagonists.  However, although this application discloses a number of compounds, it is desirable to find further classes of compounds to act as 5-HT2B antagonists, which are preferably selective against 5-HT2A and 5-HT;-r receptors.<br>

Includes Other Forms<br>
Unless otherwise specified, included in the above are the well known ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of these substituents.  For example, a reference to carboxylic acid (-COOH) also includes the anionic (carboxylate) form (-COCT) , a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms.  Similarly, a reference to an amino group includes the protonated form (-IxTHR^2) , a salt or solvate of the amino group, for example, a hydrochloride salt, as well as conventional protected forms of an amino group. Similarly, a reference to a hydroxyl group also includes the anionic form (-0") , a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected forms of a hydroxyl group.<br><br>
Isomers, Salts, Solvates and Protected Forms Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric, optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, stereoisomeric, tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and Z-forms; c-, t-, and r- forms; endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, ana meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and 1-forms; (+) and (-) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; a- and p-forms; axial and equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchair-forms; and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to as "isomers" (or "isomeric forms").<br>
Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term "isomers," as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e., isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space) .  For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCH3, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH.  Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl.  However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g., Ci--/alkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).<br>
The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for<br>
example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and riitro/aci-nitro.<br>

For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including :H, 2H (D) , and 3H (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including 12C, 13C, and 14C; 0 may be in any isotopic form, including 160 and 180; and the like.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof.  Methods for the preparation (e.g., asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g., fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of thereof, for example, as discussed below.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding salt of the active compound, for example, a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt.  Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et<br>
al., 1977, "Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts," J. Pharm. S_ci_. , Vol. 66, pp. 1-19.<br>
For example, if the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic (e.g., -COOH may be -COO"), then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation.  Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na+ and K+, alkaline earth cations such as Ca"' and Mg2+, and other cations such as A14J. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH/) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH3R+, NH2R2'1, NHR3 + , NR/} .  Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine.  An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is<br>
If the compound is cationic, or has a functional group which may be cationic (e.g., -NH2 may be -NH3+) , then a salt may be formed with a suitable anion.  Examples of suitable inorganic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following inorganic acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric, sulfurous, nitric, nitrous, phosphoric, and phosphorous.<br>
Examples of suitable organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following organic acids: 2-acetyoxybenzoic, acetic, ascorbic, aspartic, benzoic, camphorsul f onic, cinnamic, citric, edetic, ethanedisulf onic, ethanesul f onic, fumaric, glucoheptonic, gluconic, glutamic,<br>
glycolic, hydroxymaleic, hydroxynaphthalene carboxylic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauric, maleic, malic, methanesullonic, mucic, oleic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phenylsulfonic, propionic, pyruvic, salicylic, stearic, succinic, sulfanilic, tartaric, toluenesulionic, and valeric.  Examples of suitable polymeric organic anions include, but are not limited to, those derived from the following polymeric acids: tannic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound.  The term "solvate" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g., active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent.  If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle the active compound in a chemically protected form. The term "chemically protected form" is used herein in the conventional chemical sense and pertains to a compound in which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from undesirable chemical reactions under specified conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, radiation, solvent, and the like).  In practice, well known chemical methods are employed to reversibly render unreactive a functional group, which otherwise would be reactive, under specified conditions.  In a chemically protected form, one or more reactive functional groups are in the form of a protected or protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group or a blocked or blocking group).  By protecting a reactive functional group, reactions involving other unprotected<br>
reactive functional groups can be performed, without affecting the protected group; the protecting group may be removed, usually in a subsequent step, without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule.  See, for example, ££.pt.ect.i;ve Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999).<br>
A wide variety of such "protecting", "blocking", or "masking" methods are widely used and well known in organic synthesis.  For example, a compound which has two nonequivalent reactive functional groups, both of which would be reactive under specified conditions, may be derivatized to render one of the functional groups "protected," and therefore unreactive, under the specified conditions; so protected, the compound may be used as a reactant which has effectively only one reactive functional group.  After the desired reaction (involving the other functional group) is complete, the protected group may be "deprotected" to return it to its original functionality.<br>
For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=0)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=0)CH3, -OAc).<br>
For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an acetal (R-CH(OR)2) or ketal (R2C(OR)2), respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=0) is converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by<br>
hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
For example, an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide (-NRCO-R) or a urethane (-NRCO-OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3) ; a benzyloxy amide (-NHCO-OCH:&gt;C6H5, -NH-Cbz) ; as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC (CH3) 3, -NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3) ^CfcH^CeHb, -NH-Bpoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), as a 2 (-phenylsulfonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NH-Psec); or, in suitable cases (e.g., cyclic amines), as a nitroxide radical (&gt;N-0$).<br>
For example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for example, as: an Ci-7alkyl ester (e.g., a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester); a Cj-vhaloalkyl ester (e.g., a Cj-vtrihaloalkyl ester) ; a triCj^alkylsilyl-Ci-ialkyl ester; or a C5-2oaryl-Ci_7alkyl ester (e.g., a benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a methyl amide.<br>
For example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-S-CH2NHC(=0)CH3) .<br>
The term "treatment," as used herein in the context of treating a condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a human or an animal (e.g., in veterinary applications), in which some desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition of the<br>
progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate of progress, a halt in the rate of progress, amelioration of the condition, and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic measure (i.e., prophylaxis) is also included.<br>
The term "therapeutically-effective amount," as used herein, pertains to that amount of an active compound, or a material, composition or dosage from comprising an active compound, which is effective for producing some desired therapeutic effect, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, when administered in accordance with a desired treatment regimen. Suitable dose ranges will typically be in the range of from 0.01 to 20 mg/kg/day, preferably from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day.<br>
Compositions and their administration<br>
Compositions may be formulated for any suitable route and means of administration.  Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents include those used in formulations suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural) administration.  The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.  Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.  In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
For solid compositions, conventional non-toxic solid carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like may be used.  The active compound as defined above may be formulated as suppositories using, for example, polyalkylene glycols, acetylated triglycerides and the like, as the carrier. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc, an active compound as defined above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension.  If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, etc.  Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, 15th Edition, 1975.  The composition or formulation to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the active compound(s) in an amount effective to alleviate the symptoms of the subject being treated.<br>
Dosage forms or compositions containing active ingredient in the range of 0.25 to 95% with the balance made up from non-toxic carrier may be prepared.<br>
For oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic composition is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, sodium crosscarmellose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like.  Such compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, palls, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations and the like.  Such compositions may contain l%-95% active ingredient, more preferably 2-50%, most preferably 5-8%.<br>
Parenteral administration is generally characterized by injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously.  Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions.  Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like.  In addition, if desired, the pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, etc.<br>
The percentage of active compound contained in such parental compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the activity of the compound and the needs of the subject.  However, percentages of active ingredient of 0.1% to 10% in solution are employable, and will be higher if the composition is a solid which will be<br>
subsequently diluted to the above percentages. Preferably, the composition will comprise 0.2-2% of the active agent in solution.<br>

General Synthesis Methods<br>
Compounds of formula I where at least one of R2 and R3 are hydrogen, can be synthesised according to the route disclosed by Cockerill (Cockerill, A.F., et al., Synthesis, 1976, 591-593, which is herein incorporated by reference).<br>

wherein Aryl represents the optionally substituted Cg-group, and R represents a group selected from H, and optionally substituted Cj-e alkyl, d-i cycloalkyl, C3-7 cycloalkyl -Ci-4 alkyl, and phenyl-Cj-4 alkyl.<br><br>
aryl<br><br>
In this method the 2- ami no oxazole is produced by the condensation of the appropriate a-hydroxy ketone with cyanarnide or alkylcyanamide, which reaction can be carried out in aqueous solution or in the presence of a mineral acid or a base catalyst.<br>
We have found that the product of the reaction may be either the 2-amino-4-aryl-oxazole, the 2-amino-5-aryl-oxazole, or a mixture of the two, with the 2-amino-5-aryl oxazole being favoured.  It is thought that carrying out the reaction under milder conditions may favour production of the 2-amino-4-aryl oxazole.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the 2-amino-5-aryl-oxazole product results from the reaction of the tautomeric form of the starting material:<br>
The starting a-hydroxyketones can be synthesised via a-bromo and a-acetoxy intermediates, some of which are commercially available, from the parent ketones.<br>
The substitution on the 2-amino group can be introduced using a substituent on the cyanamide, or may be introduced later in the reaction scheme, again with, if necessary, protection of other functional groups in the molecule (see, for example, Examples 9 and 15 below)<br>
Compounds of formula la where R4 is an optionally substituted Cg-n aryl group and both R2 and R3 are not hydrogen can be synthesised according to a modification of the route disclosed by Gompper (Gompper, R., and Christmann, O., Chem. Ber. 92, 1944 -1949 (1959), which is herein incorporated by reference).<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
In this method the 2-amino oxazole is produced by the condensation of the appropriate a-bromo ketone with 1,1-dialkyl urea, which reaction is carried out in an organic solvent.<br>
The 5-substituent on the oxazole ring is present in the starting material as the alkyl chain of the a-bromo<br>
alkylarylketone, which can be obtained from the parent alkylarylketone if necessary.<br>
This route can be used for compounds of formula I where R4 is an optionally substituted C9_j4 aryl group and at least one of R"' and R3 are hydrogen, but is less preferred for these compounds.<br>
The starting ketones for both routes are either commercially available or accessible by, for example, Grignard reactions on the corresponding nitriles or Friedal Crafts reaction of substituted aryls.<br>
A further method of preparing compounds of formula I where R4 is an optionally substituted Cg-n aryl group is by a palladium catalysed coupling reaction of a 2-amino-4-substituted oxazole with an aryl boronic acid, or derivative thereof.  The 4-sustituent on the oxazole ring may typically be a halogen, such as bromo, iodo or chloro, or a group such as trifluoromethanesulfonate or a phophate ester.  The aryl boronic acid may also be replaced by certain magnesium, tin or zinc containing organometallic reagents.  For example, a 2-amino-4-bromo-oxazole may be reacted with an aryl boronic acid derivative in an aqueous solvent, for example a mixture of ethanol, water and dimethoxyethane, containing a palladium catalyst such as<br>
tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and an inorganic base such as sodium carbonate.  The reaction is carried out by heating at about 80-90° for several hours.<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Alternatively, the boronic acid residue, or equivalent, may be on the 4-position of the oxazole ring and the halogen, or equivalent, on the aryl group.<br>
This route is equally applicable to compounds of formula I where R1 is an optionally substituted Cg-n aryl group, where the 2-amino-4-bromo-oxazole is replaced with a 2-amino-5-bromo-oxazole:<br>
R B(OH)2 +<br>
(Figure Remove)<br><br>
This route may be varied in the same way as described above.<br>
In any of the above routes, any substitution on the Cg-n aryl group is preferably present in the relevant starting material, but could be introduced later in the reaction scheme, with, if necessary, appropriate protection of other functional groups present in the molecule (see, for example, Examples 11A, 11B, 12, 13 and 14).<br>
In a similar fashion, the RVR4 group which is not the aryl group may be the subject of further reactions to provide alternative substituent pattens.<br>

Human cloned 5-HT2B receptor binding assay<br>
The binding affinity of the compounds for human cloned 5-HT2B receptors was determined using the following assay.<br>
CHO-K1 cells expressing cloned 5-HT2B receptor were maintained in Ultra-CHO medium containing 400ug/ml of G418, lOOU/ml penicillin, lOOug/ml streptomycin, 2.5ug/ml fungizone and 1% foetal bovine serum, in 95/5% 02/C02 at 37°C. The cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin and were centrifuged at 800rpm for 8 minutes. The cells were homogenised in 50mM HEPES buffer containing ImM disodium EDTA and ImM PMSF at pH 7.4, using a Dounce homogeniser (20<br><br>
strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged at 2280rpm (lOOOg) and 4°C for 10 minutes, after which the supernatant was removed by decanting. The pellet was re-homogenised as above, and the resulting supernatant removed and combined with that already obtained. The supernatant solution was then centrifuged at 18300rpm (40000g) for 10 minutes at 4°C using a Sorvall centrifuge. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was re-suspended in 50mM buffer at pH 7.4 using a Ultra-turrax T25 Polytron, before centrifugation again at 40000g as above. This wash procedure was repeated, after which the membrane preparation was stored at a concentration of Img/ml at -80°C until use.<br>
The membranes were thawed rapidly and diluted in assay buffer containing Tris-HCl (50mM, pH 7.4), ascorbic acid (0.1%) and calcium chloride (4mM). The membranes were homogenised to resuspend them, prior to adding 10 or 15ug of membranes to assay wells containing [3H]LSD (InM), assay buffer (50mM Tris, 4mM calcium chloride and 0.1% ascorbic acid) containing pargyline (lOpM), and the test compounds (lxlO~10 to lxlO~4M) . Non specific binding was determined in the presence of lOOuM 5-HT. After 30 minutes incubation at 37°C, the assay mixture was filtered through a combination of GF-C and GF-B filters, pre-soaked in 1%<br>
polyethyleneimine, using a Brandel cell harvester, and were washed three times using 50mM Tris-HCl. Radioactivity retained on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For each test compound, the concentration that inhibited binding of [3H]LSD by 50% was determined using curve fitting software (Prism). Kd values (concentration of LSD required to occupy 50% of the receptor binding sites at equilibrium) determined from saturation binding studies were then used to calculate inhibition<br><br>

Human 5-HT2A and 5-HT2c receptor binding assays<br>
The binding affinity of ligands for human 5-HT2A and 5-HT2c receptors was determined using the following assay.  These results were then used to determine the selectivity of the test compounds for 5-HT2B receptors, over 5-HT2A and 5-HT2c receptors.<br>
Membrane preparations from CHO-K1 cells expressing the cloned human 5-HT2A receptor were obtained (Euroscreen). The membranes were thawed rapidly and diluted in assay buffer containing Tris-HCl (50mM, pH 7.7). The membranes were resuspended by homogenisation, prior to adding 15ug of membranes to assay wells containing [3H] ketanserin (InM), assay buffer (50mM Tris at pH 7.4) containing pargyline (10uM), and test compounds (IxlCT10 to lxlO~4M) . Non specific binding was determined in the presence of lOOpM mianserin. After 15 minutes incubation at 37°C, the assay mixture was filtered through a combination of GF-C and GF-B filters, pre-soaked in 0.05% Brij, using a Brandel cell harvester, and were washed three times using ice cold Tris-HCl buffer (50mM).

Human 5-HT2B receptor tissue based functional assay<br>
An in vit.ro functional assay, using human colon smooth muscle, wa. carried out to determine the affinity of the test compounds at the S-HT^B receptor in human tissues.<br>
Sections of human colon were cut open along their longitudinal axis. The sections were pinned out flat and the mucosa carefully removed using sharp dissecting scissors. Once the mucosa was removed, the section was turned over to reveal the three taenia coli (taenia mesencolica, taenia omentalis and taenia libera] and the muscle bands that lie between them. Longitudinal muscle strips (2mm wide by 20mm long) were then cut from the tissue between the taenia coli and suspended between stainless steel hooks in organ chambers containing oxygenated (95% 02/5% C02) Krebs solution at 37°C. The composition of the Krebs solution was as follows: NaCl (118.2mM), KC1 (4.69mM), MgS04.7H20 (1.18mM), KH2P04 (1.19mM), glucose (ll.lmM), NaHC03 (25.0mM), CaCl2.6H20 (2.5mM).<br>
Tissues were placed under a load equivalent to lOmN and left to equilibrate for a period of at least 60 minutes. Responses were recorded using isometric transducers coupled to an Apple Macintosh computer via a MacLab interface. After 60 minutes, the longitudinal muscle sections of the human colon were stimulated electrically (sub-maximal voltage and frequency with 60s between successive stimulations) using parallel platinum wire electrodes and a Multistim D330 pulse stimulator. Upon electrical stimulation, the strips of human colon longitudinal smooth muscle responded with a rapid contraction. Once the response to electrical stimulation had<br>
stabilised (stimulated responses differed by no more than 10';,), the strips were exposed to increasing concentrations of S-HT (1x10"'* to lxlCT'M) , in the absence or presence of Lest compounds (1x10' to lxlO~'JM, incubated for 30 minutes) . Tc determine the affinity of the compounds, the concentration of 5-HT required to produce half-maximal effects (EC*j0) was calculated in the absence and presence of test compound.  The antagonist affinity was calculated by dividing the EC^o for 5-HT in the presence of antagonist by the EC'bo for 5-HT in the absence of antagonist to yield a concentration ratio (CR) .<br>
The results are shown in table 2 below as a pKB value, which<br>
is calculated as follows:<br>
pKB =-- log(C7? - l)- log(aw/ago/7M7 concentration) .<br>

Human cloned 5-HT2B cell-based functional assay<br>
The following describes an in vitro functional assay using human cloned 5-HT2B receptors to determine the ability of compounds to block the receptor.<br>
CHO.K1 cells expressing cloned 5-HT2r, receptor were maintained In Ultra-CHO medium containing 400ug/ml of G418, lOOU/ml penicillin, lOOpg/ml streptomycin, 2.5pg/ml fungizone, in 95/5% 02/C02 at 37°C.  Ultra-CHO medium additionally supplemented with 1% foetal bovine serum was used when seeding the cells and removed after 5 hours. Cells were plated in Costar 96 well white, clear-bottomed plate at a density of 50,000 cells per well and incubated for at least 24 hours in 95/5% 02/C02 at 37°C before running the assay.<br>
Media was removed from the wells and 200pl of 4pM Fluo-4 AM added, this was incubated in a Wallace Victor 2V workstation at 37 °C for 30 minutes.  The Fluo-4 AM was then removed from the wells, which were then washed twice with 200yl of buffer (HBSS without calcium/magnesium/phenol red, 20mM HEPES, ImM Ca?\ ImM Mg2+, 2.5mM probenecid, pH to 7.4), 180yl of buffer or test compound was added to the well and incubated for 30 minutes.  The Victor 2V injectors were used to inject 20pl of 5-HT after obtaining 10 0.1-second baseline readings at 535nm, followed by 150 readings.<br>
All test compounds were aliquoted in 100% DMSO at lOmM and diluted to ImM in 50% DMSO, subsequent dilutions were made using buffer.  Buffer was also used to dilute the 5-HT. Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism, with the latter used to produce sigmoidal dose-response curves for each compound.  The compound concentration that inhibited the 5-HT response by 50% was taken (ICso - M) , and the results are shown in Table 3, as pICso, being the negative log (to the base 10) of the measured IC50 values.
