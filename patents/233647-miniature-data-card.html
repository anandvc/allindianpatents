				<td>MINIATURE DATA CARD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to data cards, such as credit cards, that contain a<br>
magnetic stripe or other means of storing information. More particularly, this invention relates<br>
to such cards that are small in size.<br>
Cards of various kinds have become ubiquitous in modern society. People often<br>
carry a number of cards in their wallet or carrying case, including credit cards, ATM or bank<br>
cards, debit cards, "smart cards," insurance cards, a driver's license, identification cards,<br>
telephone calling cards, transit cards, library cards, and card-entry hotel keys. An increasing<br>
number of consumer transactions require use of these cards, for example, as the form of<br>
payment, or as identification necessary for another form of payment or admission. Quick and<br>
accurate access to certain individual cards is useful and desirable for both the consumer and the<br>
vendor of goods or services.<br>
Typically, consumers store credit cards and other types of cards in a wallet or<br>
carrying case. These wallets and carrying cases are frequently equipped with sleeves or slotslfor<br>
holding one or more cards in an arrangement selected by the user. Because of the proliferation<br>
of the types and numbers of cards carried by consumers, cards are often held very tightly within<br>
these sleeves or slots, making retrieval of a particular card difficult. Difficulty in removing a ,<br>
single selected card increases the time necessary for the transaction, causes stored cards to be<br>
frequently reshuffled and potentially disorganized, and increases the likelihood that cards will be<br>
dropped or lost<br>
While the number of cards typically carried by consumers is increasing, most<br>
consumers use certain types of cards much more frequently than others. For example, some<br>
consumers may use a credit card for nearly every sales transaction, but only rarely, if ever, use<br>
calling cards, library cards, or insurance cards. Because a subset of the total number of cards<br>
carried by consumers must be accessed repeatedly, it is particularly desirable to improve the<br>
accessibility of these types of cards.<br>
One way to improve accessibility of frequently used cards is by allowing them to be<br>
stored in a separate location from the traditional wallet or carrying case. Such cards could be<br>
stored on key-chains, lanyards, hooks, or other similar devices that are easily retrieved from a<br>
bag or pocket. Thus, when a consumer needs to use the card during a transaction, the card may<br>
be quickly retrieved and given to the merchant. This provides an added level of convenience to<br>
the consumer by making the payment process quicker and simpler. Additionally, the merchant is<br>
able to move customers through the line more quickly, improving customer satisfaction. An<br>
additional benefit of storing frequently used cards on a key-chain or like device is that the<br>
possibility that the card will be lost is decreased. This is because a single card is much more<br>
easily misplaced than a card attached to a key-chain.<br>
Conventionally sized cards, however, are too large and cumbersome to be<br>
conveniently stored on a key-chain or like device. The individual items on a key chain must be<br>
small and compact so that the key-chain can accommodate numerous items. Further, key-chains<br>
and the like are often placed in the pockets of clothing, which may be small. Finally, larger<br>
items, such as conventional credit cards, could be bent or otherwise damaged when stored on a<br>
device such as a key-chain. Thus, for a card to be effectively carried on a key-chain, its size<br>
must be significantly reduced.<br>
The degree to which conventional cards may be reduced in size, however, is limited<br>
by the requirements of standard magnetic stripe card readers, such as point-of-sale ("POS")<br>
terminals through which the user "swipes" the card to make a purchase or payment. In order to<br>
ensure interoperability between the magnetic stripe readers and cards bearing magnetic stripes,<br>
the parameters defining the magnetic stripe are governed by the International Organization for<br>
Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (TEC). ISO/IEC 7811<br>
provides standards for the physical characteristics of the magnetic stripe including the location of<br>
the stripe on the card, the surface profile of the stripe, and the height of the stripe above the card<br>
surface. It would be advantageous for a reduced-size card to comply with ISO/IEC 7811, or<br>
otherwise be compatible with existing card readers and POS terminals.<br>
Proper functioning of the magnetic stripe is very important On conventional cards,<br>
such as credit cards, magnetic stripes contain encoded information that electronic readers can<br>
read to perform a function or confirm identification. For example, on credit and debit cards, the<br>
magnetic stripe is usually encoded with specific account information such as the credit card<br>
number, cardholder's name, the card expiration date, and a personal identification code. If the<br>
electronic device for reading the encoded information cannot properly read the magnetic stripe,<br>
the vendor must enter the information manually, using a keypad, telephone, or other similar<br>
device. Manually entering the encoded information adds both indirect and direct costs to the<br>
vendor. for example, the additional time necessary to enter the information manually may<br>
increase needs for register operators and decrease the vendor's ability to attend to other customer<br>
matters. In addition, vendors are frequently charged increased transaction fees by the card issuer<br>
for a manually entered transaction.<br>
-Thus, a need exists for providing cards, such as credit cards, that are reduced in size<br>
from currently used cards, and yet still are operable with currently used readers. Such a card<br>
would greatly enhance the efficiency of frequent transactions, including sales transactions, by<br>
allowing regularly used cards to be readily and easily reatrieved. Further, because such a card<br>
could be readily stored on a key-chain or like device, the probability that the card would be lost<br>
or misplaced is reduced. Finally, because such a card would be compatible with currently used<br>
readers, no redesign of existing card reader technology would be required.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a data card that is reduced in size from<br>
conventional credit-card-sized cards, and contains an information storage medium, such as a<br>
magnetic stripe or a computer chip, that can be read by existing card reader technology.<br>
In another aspect, a reduced-size data card is provided with a magnetic.stripe,_which_„<br>
is located near an edge of tihecard, on which data is encoded. Such a magnetic stripe is reduced<br>
in size from the magnetic stripes found on conventionally sized cards, and contains data encoded<br>
at a higher bit density than on conventionally sized cards. The magnetic stripe is compatible<br>
with existing card reader technology.<br>
In yet another aspect, a reduced-size data card is provided with a hole to allow key-<br>
chain storage, and the core may be composed, at least in part, of polyester. Additionally, the<br>
surface of a data card of the present invention may also be provided with raised dimples or<br>
craters to enhance gripability of the card. Further, information may be printed on the surface of<br>
the card, in order to reduce or eliminate the need to emboss the card with raised lettering or<br>
embossing.<br>
In still another aspect, a reduced-size data card of the present invention may have an<br>
angled edge.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made to the present preferred embodiments of the invention,<br>
examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIGs.' 1A-B illustrate one embodiment of a conventional credit card. FIG. 1A shows<br>
the front side of a conventional standard size credit card 10, which is typically embossed using<br>
raised lettering with a credit card number 11, an expiration date 12, and the name of the card-<br>
holder 13. Such a card also usually contains the name of the issuing bank 14, and the credit card<br>
company, such as American Express®, MasterCard®, or VISA®, 15. It may also contain other<br>
information, such as sponsor logos and/or a "platinum" or similar indication. Additionally, the<br>
credit card may contain an identification photograph of the card-holder for security purposes.<br>
The back side of conventional card 10, shown in FIG. 1B, typically contains a box 16 that can be<br>
signed by the card holder, which is used for verification purposes when a purchase is made.<br>
Additionally, the back side of card 10 contains a magnetic stripe 17, which runs parallel to the<br>
card's largest dimension. Magnetic stripe 17 stores information, such as credit card number, that<br>
can be read by conventional point of sale ("POS") terminals. A standard credit card is<br>
approximately 3 3/8 in. long by 2 1/4 in. high, for an aspect ratio (length/height) of<br>
approximately 1.5, and has a thickness of approximately 0.75 mm.<br>
The card of the present invention includes an information storage medium. By<br>
"information storage medium," is meant a medium that is added to the card that stores<br>
information in a magnetic, electronic, or electro-magnetic manner. This term does not include<br>
printed information either affixed to or printed directly on-the card. Exemplary information<br>
storage media suitable for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, magnetic<br>
stripes and computer chips.<br>
FIGs. 2 A-B depict a preferred embodiment of the present invention, including a<br>
generally rectangular card 20, a magnetic stripe 21, and a hole 22. The dimensions of card 20<br>
are approximately 2 1/8 in. long by 1 1/4 in. high, for an aspect ratio (length/height) of<br>
approximately 1.7, and a thickness of approximately 0.75 mm. This is a significant reduction<br>
from the dimensions of a standard credit card. As would be appreciated by one skilled in the art,<br>
the foregoing specific dimensions are representative only, and the present invention is not limited<br>
to any particular dimensions. Preferably, the present invention is carried out using cards with<br>
dimensions ranging in length from approximately 1 in. to 3 in., and ranging in height from<br>
approximately 1 in. to 1 7/8 in. Thus, the aspect ratio (length/height) could range from<br>
approximately 0.53 (1 / 1.875) to 3 (3 / 1).<br>
Magnetic stripe 21 is located on the back side of card 20, as shown in FIG. 2B, and is<br>
oriented.perpendicularly to the card's largest dimension. Alternatively, the. magnetic stripe could<br>
, be located on the front side of card 20. In one embodiment of the present invention, magnetic<br>
stripe 21 is approximately 0.41 in. in width. In another embodiment, shown for example in<br>
FIGs. 3A-B, magnetic stripe 31 is approximately 0.25 in. in width.<br>
. ISO/IEC 7811 provides standards for the location of the stripe on the card, the<br>
surface profile of the stripe, and the height of the stripe above the card surface. Generally,<br>
designers of cards attempt to comply with these standards to ensure compatibility with existing<br>
POS terminals. Unexpectedly, the card of the present invention is compatible with existing point<br>
of sale terminals without complying with several aspects of the ISO/IEC standards, as explained<br>
in more detail below.<br>
. Finally, hole 22 is shown as located in a comer of card 20, and allows the card to be<br>
readily carried on a key-chain or like device. It should be apparent to one skilled in the art that<br>
hole 20 can be located anywhere on the card that allows the card to be carried by a key-chain or<br>
similar device and does not interfere with the magnetic stripe.<br>
FIGs. 3 A-B show an alternate preferred embodiment. Like the previous<br>
embodiment, this embodiment includes a generally rectangular card 30, a magnetic stripe 31, that<br>
is oriented perpendiculairly to the card's largest dimension, and a hole 32. Here, however,<br>
magnetic stripe 31 is narrower in width than magnetic stripe 21 of FIG. 2B. A narrower<br>
magnetic stripe may be utilized when less information is needed to be stored by the magnetic<br>
stripe or when encoding; techniques allow more information to be stored in a reduced space.<br>
FIGs. 4A-D show alternate preferred embodiments. FIG. 4A shows a generally<br>
rectangular shaped card 40 with a hole 42. Card dimensions (2 1/8 in. by 1 1/4 in.) are shown on<br>
FIG. 4A and are significantly reduced from the standard size credit card. Additionally, card 40<br>
contains an identification photograph 43, various logos 44 and 45, and additional information 46.<br>
Further, embossed infomiation, such as credit card number or expiration date (not shown) could<br>
be included. Other arrangements of logos, and information should be apparent to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art from this description or from practice. For example, FIG. 4B shows card 40',<br>
which is similar to card 40 (FIG. 4A) but without the identification photograph, and with a<br>
different arrangement of logos and other information.<br>
FIG. 4C shows the back side of card 40, depicted in FIG. 4A, which includes<br>
magnetic stripe 41 oriented perpendicularly to the card's largest dimension. Additionally, FIG.<br>
4C includes signature block 47. Signature block 47 is to be signed by the card holder, and is<br>
used for signature verification when a purchase is made. Finally, the back side of card 40 may<br>
contain logos 48 and other information, as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
FIG. 4D shows an alternate arrangement of the back side of card 40r It shows '<br>
magnetic stripe 41' which is narrower than magnetic stripe 41 of FIG. 4C. Narrower magnetic<br>
stripes may be utilized when less information is required to be stored by the magnetic stripe, or<br>
when encoding techniques allow more information to be stored in less space.<br>
FIGs. 5A-B show an alternate preferred embodiment, including a generally<br>
rectangular shaped card 50 and a magnetic stripe 51, oriented perpendicularly to the card's<br>
largest dimension. Unlike previous embodiments, the present embodiment does not contain a<br>
hole. While a hole is a helpful way to attach a card of the present invention to a key-chain or like •<br>
device, such a hole is not required. Thus, the card can be attached to the key-chain by a clip or<br>
similar device. Additionally, the card of the present invention is not required to be stored on a<br>
key-chain or like device and could be stored in any fashion chosen by the consumer, such as<br>
directly in the consumer's pocket or bag. It should be readily apparent to one skilled in the art<br>
that any of the embodiments described herein could be modified such that the hole is removed.<br>
FIGs. 6A-B show still another alternate preferred embodiment, including a generally<br>
rectangular shaped card 60, a magnetic stripe 61, and a hole 62. Magnetic stripe 61 is oriented<br>
parallel to the card's largest dimension. As described above, magnetic stripe 61 is preferably<br>
compatible with existing magnetic stripe readers. Magnetic stripe 61 may be either narrow or<br>
wide, depending on the amount of date required to be stored and the degree of data compression.<br>
Because magnetic stripe 61 is oriented parallel to the card's longest dimension, it may be capable<br>
of storing a greater amount of information at a given width than magnetic stripe 21 of FIG. 2B<br>
which is oriented perpendicularly to the card's largest dimension. Thus, the present embodiment<br>
may be more easily implemented when greater amounts of information storage is required. It<br>
should be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that any of the embodiments<br>
described herein could be modified such that the magnetic stripe is oriented parallel to the card's<br>
largest dimension.<br>
Conventional credit cards and the like have been generally rectangular in shape.<br>
However, the card of the present invention may take on other shapes. For example, the card<br>
could be any number of geometric shapes such as triangular or trapezoidal. Additionally, the<br>
card could take on the shape of naturally occurring or human-made objects, such as pine trees or<br>
airplanes. Such shapes could be related to the card issuer or sponsor. Thus, a credit card that a<br>
consumer can use to accrue frequent flier miles could be in the shape of an airplane. The<br>
dimensions of such cards generally comport with the size guidelines suggested herein. Because<br>
such cards are not rectangular, the magnetic stripe would not necessarily be oriented as described<br>
above (either parallel to or perpendicular to the card's largest dimension). Thus, the magnetic<br>
stripe could be oriented in any number of ways, depending on the shape of the card.<br>
Additionally, any of the embodiments described herein could be provided with a<br>
tread to increase the gripability of the card. Such treads are described in detail in U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 09/611,320 filed on July 6,2000, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
These treads could take the form of a plurality raised dimples disposed on a surface<br>
of the card. The treads are preferably disposed on the surface or face of the card that comes into<br>
contact with the user to increase gripability. FIGs. 7A-C show three alternate preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention in which the surface of the card is provided with treads. In<br>
each a number of dimples 77 is arranged to form a plurality of treads 76 on the front face 71 of<br>
card 70. In FIG. 7 A, the dimples 77 are arranged to form treads 76 in either a triangular pattern<br>
or a line. The dimples 77, however, can also be arranged in any number of patterns. As depicted<br>
in FIGs. 7A-7C, the treads 76 are located near an edge 73 of card 70, and in each preferred<br>
embodiment depicted in FIGs. 7A-7C, a tread 76 is located near the top edge 72 of the card 70.<br>
Other arrangements of dimples 77 forming treads 76 should be apparent to one of skill in the art<br>
from this description of from practice of the invention depending on the intended or experienced<br>
use of the card.<br>
FIG. 8 A shows a sectional view of a preferred embodiment of card 70 of the present<br>
invention taken along the line X-X of FIG. 7A, in which the dimples 77 are raised from the front<br>
face 71 of the card 70. In such an embodiment, the height of each dimple should be selected so<br>
as not to interfere with the proper operation of POS terminals or other devices that require the<br>
card to be swiped by or through the device.<br>
FIG. 8B shows a sectional view of an alternate preferred embodiment of card 70 of<br>
the present invention. In this embodiment, the dimples are created in such a manner as to create<br>
individual craters 77 in which the lip of the crater is raised slightly above the front surface 71 of<br>
the card 70, while the center of the crater is slightly below the surface of the card.<br>
While the specific embodiments described herein are cards having magnetic stripes<br>
such as credit cards, debit cards, and bank cards, this is by way of example, and the invention is<br>
not limited to these types of cards. Thus, the present invention can be implemented for many<br>
different types of data cards including Smart Cards (i.e. cards containing computer chips that<br>
store information), stored value cards, proximity chip cards, and other cards that are capable of<br>
storing information. A detailed discussion of data cards containing embedded computer chips<br>
may be found in U.S. Patent No. 4,443,027 to McNeely et al., the entirety of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in<br>
greater detail. This preferred embodiment, shown in FIGs. 9A-C, includes a generally<br>
rectangular card 90, a magnetic stripe 91, and a hole 92. The front face 93 of card 90 is shown in<br>
FIG. 9A; the rear face 94 of card 90 is shown in FIG. 9B. Approximate dimensions of card 90,<br>
as indicated on FIG. 9B, are 1 9/16 inches (height) by 2 9/16 inches (length). The width of the<br>
card, shown in FIG. 9C (not to scale), is approximately 0.75 mm. These height and length<br>
dimensions are reduced from conventionally-sized credit card dimensions, which are<br>
approximately 2 1/4 inches (height) by 3 3/8 inches (length).<br>
Once again, the specific dimensions of card 90 are representative only, and the<br>
present invention is not limited to any particular dimensions. Nevertheless, the present invention<br>
is preferably carried out using cards with dimensions ranging from approximately 1 inch by 1<br>
inch to approximately 1 7/8 inches to 3 inches.<br>
The front face 93 of card 90 contains various information such as card number 95,<br>
expiration date 96, and card-holder name 97. This information may be embossed on the card. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, the card is free from or devoid of embossing or other raised lettering.<br>
In such an embodiment, the information may be printed on the card using laser printing<br>
techniques, as are known in the art.<br>
• Between front and rear faces 93 and 94 of card 90 is a core 99, as shown in FIG. 9C.<br>
This core, may.be composed of, at least in part, polyester. In one embodiment, the core is<br>
composed of 80% polyester and 20% polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The use of polyester in the core<br>
is advantageous because it increases the durability of the card. As would be apparent to one<br>
skilled in the art, various percentages of polyester and other materials may be used for the card<br>
core.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIGs. 9A-C, magnetic stripe 91 is positioned parallel to<br>
the bottom edge 98 of card 90. The bottom edge, of course, is defined with respect to the<br>
particular card orientation shown in FIG. 9B. As would be readily apparent to one skilled in the<br>
art, rotation of card 90 could cause "bottom" edge 98 to appear as if it is a right, left, or top edge.<br>
Magnetic stripe 91 is used to store encoded data such as the name of the card-holder, a credit<br>
card or other account number, card expiration date, and a personal identification code or other<br>
security information. The lengthwise dimension of magnetic stripe 91 is approximately 2 9/16<br>
inches. As defined herein, the lengthwise dimension of a magnetic stripe is the largest<br>
dimension of the magnetic stripe. However, as described above, the present invention is not<br>
limited to any particular dimensions. Preferably, the lengthwise dimension of the magnetic<br>
stripe ranges from approximately 1 inch to approximately 3 inches.<br>
The requirements of ISO/EEC 7811, which specifies the international standards for<br>
magnetic stripes will now be discussed, and then compared to the characteristics of magnetic<br>
stripe 91 of the present invention. Designers of cards bearing magnetic stripes attempt to comply<br>
with the standards set forth in ISO/IEC 7811 in order to ensure compatibility and interoperability<br>
with current magnetic stripe readers and POS terminals.<br>
ISO/IEC 7811 specifies that a magnetic stripe may contain up to three tracks of<br>
encoded information. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, each track is essentially a<br>
strip of specified width and location running the length of the magnetic stripe, on which data is •<br>
encoded. According to ISO/IEC 7811, track 1 is located closest to the edge of the card and<br>
contains data encoded at 210 bits per inch (bpi). Track 2 is adjacent to track 1 and contains data<br>
encoded at 75 bpi. FIG. 10 shows the width and location of tracks 1 and 2 as specified by<br>
ISO/IEC 7811-4, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Track 3 is the<br>
furthest from the edge of the card and contains data encoded at 210 bpi. FIG. 11 shows the<br>
width and location of track 3 as specified by ISO/IEC 7811-5, the entirety of which is hereby<br>
 incorporated by reference.<br>
In all cases, data is encoded on the tracks using two-trequency encoding, as specified<br>
in ISO/IEC 7811. As will be understood by one skilled in the art, two-frequency encoding<br>
involves the use of flux transitions to encode data. The encoding comprises data and clocking<br>
transitions together. The presence of a flux transition between clocking transitions signifies that<br>
the bit is a "one;" the absence of a flux transition signifies a "zero." Additional detailed<br>
discussion of two-frequency encoding may be found in ISO/IEC 7811-2 and 7811-6, the entirety<br>
of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Each track of data contains a "start sentinel." The start sentinel is the first data bit,<br>
and indicates the beginning of the encoded data on each track. As shown in FIG. 12, ISO/IEC<br>
7811 specifies that the location of the start sentinel is approximately 0.293 inches from the right<br>
side of the card for all tracks.<br>
FIG. 12 shows additional physical characteristics for magnetic stripes, as specified<br>
by ISO/IEC 7811. The minimum length of the magnetic stripe is specified as 3.135 inches<br>
(3.250 inches minimum from the right edge of the card to the left edge of the stripe minus the<br>
0.115 inches maximum from the right edge of the card to the right edge of the stripe). The<br>
minimum width of the magnetic stripe is 0.25 inches for cards using tracks 1 and 2, and 0.41<br>
inches for cards using all three tracks.<br>
Magnetic stripe 91 (FIG. 9B) is different in several respects from the magnetic<br>
stripes specified by ISO/IEC 7811. First, the length of magnetic stripe 91 is approximately 2<br>
9/16 inches, significantly shorter than the 3.135 inch minimum length specified by ISO/IEC<br>
7811.<br>
Second, the data on magnetic stripe 91 is encoded at bit densities higher than those<br>
prescribed in ISO/IEC 7811. Magnetic stripe 91 contains data encoded on tracks 1 and 2. In<br>
order to ensure that sufficient data is encoded in the smaller magnetic stripe area, data is encoded<br>
on track 1 at 260 bpi and on track 2 at 100 bpi. Both of these bit densities are significantly<br>
higher than those specified in ISO/IEC 7811 for tracks 1 and 2 (210 bpi and 75 bpi,<br>
respectively). As should be appreciated by one skilled in the art, data could also be encoded on<br>
track 3 if necessary or desirable in a particular circumstance. It should also be noted that the<br>
present invention is not limited by these specific bit densities, and other bit densities could be<br>
selected that ensure the storage of the appropriate amount of information in the available space.<br>
Also, as shown in FIG. 9B, the start sentinel of magnetic stripe 91 is located 0.200<br>
inches from the right edge of card 90'. This start sentinel location is significantly different from<br>
that specified in ISO/EEC 7811, which specifies that the start sentinel must be located 0.293<br>
inches from the right edge of the card. . .<br>
Preferably, the data on tracks 1 and 2 of magnetic stripe 91 is encoded using standard<br>
two-frequency encoding. However, it should be understood by one skilled in the art that the<br>
present invention is not limited to a particular encoding technique. Preferably, the width of each<br>
track and the distance of each track from the bottom edge 98 of card 90 complies with the<br>
requirements of ISO/EEC 7811, as described above and shown in FIG. 10.<br>
The dimensions of card 90) itself are different from the dimensions specified in<br>
ISO/IEC 7810, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference, which generally<br>
specifies physical parameters of identification cards. Notably, ISO/IEC 7810 establishes<br>
minimum dimensions for identification cards at 2.125 inches by 3.370 inches. The dimensions<br>
of card 90 are approximately 1 9/16 inches by 2 9/16 inches.<br>
Given that card 90 of the present invention does not comply with numerous standards<br>
and specifications set forth in ISO/IEC 7810 and 7811, it would be expected by those skilled in<br>
the art that the card would not be operable with standard magnetic stripe readers and POS<br>
terminals. However, tests performed on prototype cards indicate that the data cards of the<br>
present invention are compatible with standard equipment<br>
In order to test the prototype cards, twenty-five cards, substantially similar to that<br>
shown in FIGs. 9A and 9B and described above, were assembled and encoded with twenty-five<br>
different accounts. These twenty-five cards were then tested using five different POS terminals.<br>
The five POS terminals were standard merchant POS terminals manufactured by VeriFone Inc.<br>
A number of the twenty-five cards were tested on each of the five POS terminals. In order to<br>
ensure proper reading of the card, two tests were performed. First, after swiping each test card<br>
through the terminal, the terminal attempted to print a receipt showing, among other things, the<br>
name associated with the account encoded on each card. Second, the terminal used the data<br>
obtained from the card, and attempted to access the interchange system and obtain authorization<br>
for a transaction. All tested cards passed both tests. This testing indicates that the data card of<br>
the present invention is unexpectedly compatible with POS terminals, despite the non-<br>
compliance with numerous aspects of ISO/IEC 7810 and 7811.<br>
Additional testing was carried out using cards similar to card 130, shown in FIGs.<br>
13A and 13B. Card 130 differs from card 90 only in that edge 139 of card 130 is angled. The<br>
same testing protocol described above was performed on twenty-five cards substantially similar<br>
to card 130 as shown in FIGs. 13 A and B. The magnetic stripe 131 on card 130 is substantially<br>
the same as magnetic stripe 91 of card 90 (FIG. 9B). All cards tested passed both the receipt and<br>
authorization tests.<br>
Thus, testing the prototype cards of various embodiments reveals that cards of the<br>
present invention are interoperable with magnetic card reader technology and POS terminals<br>
despite non-compliance with several of the relevant ISO/IEC standards.<br>
Now will be described a method of use for a reduced-size data card of the present<br>
invention. As described above, such a card may be stored on a key-chain, lanyard, hook or<br>
similar device. Alternatively, the card may simply be placed in the pocket or bag of a consumer.<br>
When a consumer carrying a card of the present invention approaches a POS terminal or other<br>
card reader, such as when making sales transaction, the consumer may be required to produce the<br>
card to complete the transaction. Because of the convenience of storage, the consumer quickly<br>
and easily retrieves the card, and either gives the card to the merchant to "swipe" through the<br>
reader, or the consumer may be permitted to "swipe" the card him/herself. The POS terminal or<br>
other card reader then "reads" the encoded information on the card, such as card number, credit<br>
limit or the like, and the transaction is completed. The card may then be re-stored by the<br>
consumer until the next usage.<br>
Although particular embodiments of the invention have been described and<br>
illustrated herein, it is recognized that modifications and variations may readily occur to those<br>
skilled in the art, and consequently it is intended that the claims be interpreted to cover such<br>
modifications and equivalents.<br>
