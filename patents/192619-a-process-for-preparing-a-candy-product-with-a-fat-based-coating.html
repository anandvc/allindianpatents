				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing a candy product comprising a candy base with a fat-based coating having embedded therein at least one edible object.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Enrobed and dipped candy products and frozen products such as ice cream are known having edible objects embedded in their coatings, e.g. nuts, crumbs, fruit bits, raisins, chocolate chips, rice cereals, granola. Traditionally these edible objects are mixed into the enrobing or dipping mass before the centerpiece is covered with such mass. If the mass were not fast hardening, the edible objects would have a tendency to run off onto the slopes of the coated product. To avoid the runoff of the edible objects during the enrobing or dipping process, double enrobing is usually carried out with the edible objects being sprinkled in between the layers. In any case, large proportions of the edible objects are covered by the coating and are not exposed for the enjoyment of shape and color. Goods with fat based coatings produced in revolving pans are covered by building up the layers little by little with the layer being cooled and hardened between each application. These processes do not allow for enough adhesion to add edible objects, which subsequently will be embedded into the coating.<br>
Once the fat based coatings are established the problem with panned fat-based coatings is that the coating is too hard to embed edible objects therein.<br><br>
We have devised a method for embedding edible objects in a fat-based coated candy, which enables the enhancement of the product either visually, in texture or in flavor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing a candy product with a fat-based coating having embedded therein at least one edible object which comprises coating a candy base with a fat-based coating, softening the fat-based coating, embedding the at least one edible object in the fat-based coating and hardening the fat-based coating.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The candy base may be of any material and shape suitable for panning, for instance, a hard-boiled sweet, caramel, nougat, cream, paste, fondant dryed fruits, nuts, cereal, cookie and bread based.<br>
The fat-based coating may be any suspension of an edible solid in fat, such as chocolate, compound or yoghurt coatings. The chocolate may be, for instance, dark, milk or white chocolate. The compound includes products derived from sugar with or without milk derived components, and solids from vegetable or cocoa sources in differing proportions suspended in fat or oil in water emulsion having a moisture content less than 10%, more usually less than 5% by weight. The compound or couverture may include chocolate substitutes containing direct cocoa butter replacements, stearines, coconut oil, palm oil, butter or any mixture thereof; nut pastes such as peanut<br><br>
butter and fat; praline; confectioner's coatings, used for covering ice cream or cakes usually comprising chocolate analogues with cocoa butter replaced by a cheaper non-tempering fat; or "Caramac" sold by Nestle comprising non-cocoa butter fats, sugar and milk.<br>
The fat-based coating may be applied to the candy base on a flowing bed, for instance by a 'panning' process.<br>
Panning is a well known process in the chocolate industry and employs a rotating pan or a moving belt forming a pocket, in which the centres flow, roll and cascade over one another. The fat-based coating may be applied in melted form by hand or spray during rotation and is set by cooling air applied to the product bed as it flowes. In the way, layers of fat-based coating are built up around the centre to any desired thickness and the shape of the final article approximates to that of the centre and is usually quite smooth. A polish or glaze may be finally applied. Panning is described in detail in "Chocolate, Cocoa, and Confectionery" Bernard W.Minifie, Third Edition, 1989, Chapman &amp; Hall, pages 221-223.<br>
The fat-based coating applied to the candy base should have a thickness appropriate to embed the at least one edible object. The thickness of the coating layer is preferably equal to or thicker than the thickness of the object embeded. A coating thickness of less than the thickness of the embedded object is possible and will result in a raised appearance but this can be attractive if so desired.<br>
The fat-based coating is preferably softened sufficiently to be displaceable but not sufficiently to be flowable or pourable, e.g. the fat-based coating is<br><br>
softened by heat. The temperature is preferably between 25°C and 35°C depending on what coating is being used. Normally, the softening is reached when part of the fat is melted.<br>
The edible object should be of a non melting nature, or with a melting point higher than the coating used to cover the candy. For instance, a decorating material such as is used in cake manufacture, an encapsulated flavour which may be coloured, dried sugar pieces, colored flakes, nut pieces. The size typically depends on the curve (radius) of the candy surface to properly blend with the candy surface, without appearing to be obtrusive.<br>
The edible object is preferably visually or organoleptically different from the candy product, for instance, the edible object may be reflective or have a colour, shape, flavour or texture different from the candy. The shape may be, for instance, a sphere, cube circle, star, triangle, square, rectangle, polygon, oval or irregular, non-symmetrical, cartoon characters, etc. Suitable flavours are mint, strawberry, coffee, orange, nutflavors etc.<br>
Advantageously, the edible object is embedded in the external surface of the fat-based coating so that at least part of the edible object remains visible on the surface of the product.<br>
The edible object is preferably embedded in the fat-based coating with force, e.g. by sprinkling and fixing through the product weight, accelerating or projecting into the fat-based coating or by a stamping press.<br><br>
Preferably, there are a plurality of edible objects embedded in the fat-based coating. The number of edible objects embedded may depend on a variety of factors including their size. For example, from 25% to 90% of the candy surface may be covered, and a coverage of approximately 50% to 75% of total candy surface is often desirable.<br>
After embedding the at least one edible object, the fat-based coating may be smoothed by friction and preferably hardened by cooling with cold air setting the oils to a temperature below their melting temperatures.<br>
The process of the present invention enables new excitement to the appearance of the product with the addition of new shapes, colours, texture and flavours, thus increasing the appeal of common fat-based pan-coated products.<br>
The present invention also provides a candy product with a fat-based coating having embedded therein at least one edible object.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following Examples further illustrate the present invention.<br>
A pan is loaded with Graham cookie pieces of approximately 1 g each. Milk chocolate, 3g per piece, is formed into a coating around the Graham cookie pieces and set. The surfaces of the candies are reheated to 27°C by means of infrared and hot air. A sufficient quantity of brightly colored flakes of about 2mm in diameter, which were previously tempered to<br><br>
approximate 35°C, is sprinkled on to the conditioned rolling candies. As soon adhesion has taken place, the sequins are rolled into the surface, displacing some of the coating on the candy. The candies are now cooled to 150°C and a traditional confectionery polish is applied. After a short wile of maturing, the candies are ready to pack.<br><br><br>
