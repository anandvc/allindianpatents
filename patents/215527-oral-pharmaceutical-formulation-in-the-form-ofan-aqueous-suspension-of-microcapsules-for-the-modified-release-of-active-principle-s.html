				<td>The invention relates to suspension of microcapsules in an aqueous medium<br>
allwing the modified release of amoxilin. in the present disclosure, the expression -modified<br>
release" arbitrarily denotes release of the active principle(s) which starts as soon as the<br>
galenical form is brought into contact with its dissolution medium (in vivo or in vitro) or<br>
release of the active principle(s) which does not start until after a predetermined period<br>
ranging e.g. from 0.5 to several hours. In terms of the invention, the time taken to release<br>
50% of the active principle(s) is typically several hours and can extend e.g. from 0.5 to 30<br>
hours.<br>
More precisely, the invention relates to liquid pharmaceutical formulations for oral<br>
administration with the modified release of active pnnciple(s), excluding amoxicillin.<br>
These formulations consist of suspensions or dispersions of microcapsules, each of which<br>
is formed of a core comprising amoxicillin and of a coating enveloping said core<br>
According to the invention, the microcapsules constituting the disperse phase of the<br>
suspension are designed to allow the modified release of the active principle(s). excluding<br>
amoxicillin.<br>
Even more particularly, the invention relates especially to "multimicrocapsular"<br>
aqueous suspensions of active principle(s) for oral administration, excluding amoxicillin,<br>
said suspensions being stable throughout the treatment and allowing the modified release<br>
of the active principle (excluding amoxicillin). These suspensions are of particular value in<br>
the case of:<br>
forms for the modified release of active principles in high therapeutic doses (for<br>
example of 500 to 1000 milligrams or more);<br>
- liquid paediatric or geriatric forms for the modified release of active principles (for<br>
example sachets or reconstitutable oral suspensions in bottles);<br>
- taste masking and/or protection of sensitive active principles.<br>
The invention further relates to a specific process for the preparation of the<br>
microcapsules to be suspended in water.<br>
Oral pharmaceutical formulations for the modified release of active principle(s) are<br>
well known.<br>
Some of these formulations consist of tablets comprising a therapeutically active<br>
core covered with various thicknesses of non-digestible materials.<br>
Microcapsules or microspheres comprising a core of active principle(s) coated with<br>
layers of different permeability or solubility have appeared more recently. These<br>
microcapsules/microspheres are placed e.g. in gelatin capsules to form galenical systems<br>
for the modified release of active principle(s).<br>
The majority of modified-release pharmaceutical forms that comprise a coated core<br>
of active ingredient(s) are presented in solid form: tablets, gelatin capsules, microspheres or<br>
microcapsules.<br>
By way of illustration of microcapsules in the dry form, particular mention may be<br>
made of patent EP-B-0 709 087, ... describes a (pharmaceutical or dietetic) galenical<br>
system, preferably in the form of a tablet, advantageously a disintegrating tablet, or in the<br>
form of a powder or gelatin capsule, characterized in that it comprises microcapsules of the<br>
reservoir type containing at least one medicinal and/or nutritional active principle (AP)<br>
selected especially from antibiotics, and intended for oral administration, characterized in<br>
that:<br>
- they consist of particles of AP each covered with a film coating of the following<br>
composition:<br>
1 - at least one film-forming polymer (P1) insoluble in the tract fluids, present in an<br>
amount of 50 to 90% by dry weight, based on the total weight of the coating<br>
composition, and consisting of at least one water-insoluble cellulose derivative,<br>
ethyl cellulose and/or cellulose acetate being particularly preferred;<br>
2 - at least one nitrogen-containing polymer (P2) present in an amount of 2 to 25% by<br>
dry weight, based on the total weight of the coating composition, and consisting of<br>
at least one polyacrylamide and/or poly-N-vinylamide and/or poly-N-vinyllactam,<br>
polyacrylamide and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone being particularly preferred;<br>
3 - at least one plasticizer present in an amount of 2 to 20% by dry weight, based on the<br>
total weight of the coating composition, and consisting of at least one of the<br>
following compounds: glycerol esters, phthalates, citrates, sebacates, cetyl alcohol<br>
esters, castor oil, salicylic acid and cutin, castor oil being particularly preferred;<br>
4 - and at least one surfactant and/or lubricant present in an amount of 2 to 20% by dry<br>
weight, based on the total weight of the coating composition, and selected from<br>
anionic surfactants, preferably alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts of fatty<br>
acids, stearic and/or oleic acid being preferred, and/or from non-ionic surfactants,<br>
preferably polyethoxylated sorbitan esters and/or polyethoxylated castor oil<br>
derivatives, and/or from lubricants such as stearates, preferably calcium,<br>
magnesium, aluminium or zinc stearate, or stearylfumarate, preferably sodium<br>
stearylfumarate, and/or glycerol behenate, it being possible for said agent to<br>
comprise only one or a mixture of the above-mentioned products;<br>
- they have a particle size of between 50 and 1000 microns;<br>
- and they are designed so as to be able to reside in the small intestine for a period of at<br>
least about 5 hours, thereby allowing the absorption of the AP during at least part of<br>
their residence time in the small intestine.<br>
Said document relates only to dry pharmaceutical forms based on microcapsules<br>
and makes no mention of oral liquid pharmaceutical forms based on microcapsules.<br>
These modified-release solid pharmaceutical formulations are not always<br>
advantageous, especially when they are administered to very young children or to very<br>
elderly patients with swallowing difficulties.<br>
Such is the case when the active principles in question have to be administered<br>
orally in high doses, for example of 500 to 1000 milligrams or more, e.g. when the active<br>
principle is metformin. It is clear that such solid galenical systems are unsuitable because<br>
they are too bulky and hence very difficult to swallow, especially by young children or the<br>
elderly. This can be the cause of poor patient compliance and consequently jeopardize the<br>
success of the therapeutic treatment.<br>
Likewise, in the case of paediatric forms, where the therapeutic dose has to be<br>
adapted according to the child"s weight, the suspensions of the invention are suitable for<br>
the already existing bottles provided with syringes graduated in kg, and does not therefore<br>
necessitate the development of a novel device. The modified-release forms rarely<br>
employed hitherto for children are therefore now accessible by virtue of the invention. The<br>
advantages of such forms are the reduction in the number of daily dosage units and the<br>
optimization of the efficacy of the treatment between successive dosage units (e.g. for<br>
antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, cardiovascular treatments, etc.). Thus a controlled-release<br>
liquid pharmaceutical formulation which were easy to prepare would represent a significant<br>
advance.<br>
In this case it would be even more advantageous to use modified-release galenical<br>
systems consisting of a plurality of microcapsules with a diameter of less than 1000<br>
microns. In fact, in these systems, the dose of active principle(s) to be administered is<br>
distributed over a large number of microcapsules (typically 10,000 for a 500 mg dose) and<br>
thus has the following intrinsic advantages:<br>
• The use of a mixture of microcapsules with different modified-release profiles affords<br>
release profiles which have several release pulses or which, by appropriate regulation of<br>
the different fractions, ensure a constant plasma concentration level of the AP.<br>
• It avoids bringing the tissues into contact with a high dose of AP (dose dumping). Each<br>
microcapsule actually contains only a very reduced dose of active principle(s), thereby<br>
circumventing the risk of damage to the tissues due to a local overconcentration of<br>
aggressive active principle(s).<br>
• It is possible to combine several galenical forms (for immediate or modified release)<br>
containing one or more active principles in these "multimicrocapsular" systems.<br>
Liquid multiparticulate galenical forms or, more precisely, colloidal suspensions are<br>
known which are preferred to the solid forms for oral administration in the case of high-<br>
dosage active principles or paediatric applications.<br>
Liquid suspensions for the modified release of active principle(s) are difficult to<br>
produce. The main difficulty to be overcome is that of avoiding the release of the active<br>
principle(s) into the liquid phase during storage of the suspension, while allowing modified<br>
release as soon as it enters the gastrointestinal tract. This objective is particularly difficult<br>
to achieve because the active principle(s) is (are) stored in a liquid for a very long time<br>
compared with the desired release time in the gastrointestinal tract fluids. Furthermore, its<br>
prolonged residence in the liquid phase during storage must not perturb the modified-<br>
release system to the point of degrading the release profile and release time of the active<br>
principle(s).<br>
Furthermore, for these liquid formulations to be fully effective, it is known to be<br>
important that:<br>
o the microcapsules are very small (
o and the weight fraction of coating excipients is limited, this modality being all the more<br>
difficult to achieve because, due to their small size, the microcapsules have a large<br>
specific surface area, accelerating the release.<br>
As regards the prior art concerning oral liquid pharmaceutical forms for the<br>
modified release of active principles, French patent application FR-A-2 634 377 should be<br>
mentioned first of all; said document discloses a novel modified-release pharmaceutical<br>
form based on a resin/active principle complex coated with an ionic polymer whose<br>
polarity is opposite to that of the resin, and fixed thereto by ionic bonding. The active<br>
principle is also ionic and has a polarity opposite to that of the resin. The latter can be<br>
sodium polystyrenesulfonate and the ionic coating polymer is selected from acrylic and<br>
methacrylic acid ester polymers (EUDRAGIT®). The resin is impregnated with an aqueous<br>
solution of the active principle. The resin particles impregnated with active principle are<br>
then coated with an organic solution of ionic polymer. The resulting microcapsules can be<br>
converted to an oral suspension (Example 2 in particular). The use of an ionic resin and an<br>
ionic coating polymer limits the possible applications to ionic active principles.<br>
American patents US-B-4,999,189 and US-B-5,186,930 relate to liquid<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising ion exchange ionic resin/active principle<br>
complexes suspended in a liquid phase. These particles of resin/active principle complex<br>
are coated with a first layer of pharmaceutically acceptable wax of high melting point and<br>
with a second, outer layer of a pharmaceutically acceptable water-insoluble polymer (ethyl<br>
cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose,<br>
Eudragit®, etc.). A plasticizer such as dibutyl sebacate can be introduced into this second,<br>
outer layer. The active principle is fixed by ionic bonding to the ion exchange resin. The<br>
liquid phase consists of a glucose syrup with a high fructose content and of several other<br>
ingredients such as glycerol or propylene glycol.<br>
US-B-5,186,930 differs from the first US patent in that it makes provision for a<br>
sufficient amount of the first layer (wax) to prevent the particles of resin/active principle<br>
complexes from swelling and crackling.<br>
These US patents do not provide any data that allow the quality of the modified<br>
release of active principles to be assessed. Moreover, using ion exchange resins as the<br>
active principle support is rather inconvenient and restrictive in terms of the variety of<br>
active principles involved. Furthermore, this galenical system has nothing convincing to<br>
offer in terms of the stability and preservation of the modified-release properties of the<br>
active principle.<br>
PCT patent application WO-A-87/07833 and patent US-B-4,902,513 disclose<br>
aqueous suspensions of microcapsules of active principle (e.g. theophylline) with modified<br>
release of the active principle (e.g. 12 h). These suspensions are prepared by saturating the<br>
aqueous phase with the active principle before incorporating the microcapsules of active<br>
principle into this aqueous phase. The composition of the coating agent for the<br>
microcapsules that allows the modified release of the active principle is not described in<br>
said documents. Now, this coating composition is a decisive factor in guaranteeing the<br>
maintenance of the modified-release profile of the microcapsules after storage in the<br>
aqueous phase. The technical proposal described appears not to disclose the means of<br>
solving the dual problem of producing a liquid suspension of a modified-release<br>
microcapsular form without interfering with the stability of the modified-release profile of<br>
the active principle after the microcapsules have been stored in the liquid phase.<br>
European patent application EP-A-0 601 508 relates to an aqueous suspension for<br>
the oral administration of naxopren according to a modified-release profile. This<br>
suspension comprises coated microgranules of naxopren suspended in a syrupy aqueous<br>
liquid phase. The technical problem underlying this invention is to provide a modified-<br>
release form of naxopren containing a 1000 mg dose and capable of administration in a<br>
single daily dosage unit.<br>
The microgranules consist of naxopren, polyvinylpyrrolidone and lactose (90-300<br>
mm). Their coating is made up of 4 layers. The first comprises diethyl cellulose/diethyl<br>
phthalate/polyethylene glycol. The second is based on EUDRAGIT<br>
(meth)acrylate/(meth)acrylic copolymers. The third comprises glycerol stearate/wax/fatty<br>
alcohols and the fourth consists of an enteric covering based on cellulose acetate/phthalate.<br>
The naxopren undergoes modified release over 24 hours.<br>
Example 22 of said European patent application EP-A-0 601 508 contains a<br>
demonstration of the stability of the release profile after 30 days" storage of the liquid<br>
suspension.<br>
One of the disadvantages of this suspension derives from the enteric layer, which<br>
prohibits the use of a suspension of neutral pH because this layer is designed to disintegrate<br>
and become liquid at neutral pH. Another disadvantage of this enteric layer is that it blocks<br>
the release of the active principle in the stomach at acidic pH. Now, for AP whose<br>
absorption window is situated in the upper parts of the gastrointestinal tract, it is often<br>
advantageous to release the active principle in the stomach in order to increase the<br>
bioavailability. Furthermore, this multilayer solution to the problem is very complex and<br>
in addition specific to naproxen.<br>
PCT patent application WO-A-96/01628 discloses a liquid pharmaceutical<br>
formulation for the oral administration, according to a modified-release profile (12 hours),<br>
of an active principle consisting of moguisteine. The object is to propose a modified-<br>
release liquid formulation of moguisteine which is easy to measure out and ingest, has a<br>
release time that makes it possible to avoid multiple dosage units, is stable over time in<br>
aqueous suspension and is pleasantly flavoured in order to favour compliance, and whose<br>
manufacture does not involve the use of toxic substances like solvents. To achieve this<br>
object, the invention according to PCT patent application WO-A-96/01628 proposes a<br>
suspension, in a weakly hydrated liquid phase (essentially based on sorbitol and glycerol),<br>
of microgranules (90-300 mm) of moguisteine coated with a first, hydrophilic layer<br>
consisting of cellulose acetate/phthalate and diethyl phthalate, a second, hydrophobic layer<br>
containing glycerol stearate/wax/fatty alcohols, and a third, hydrophilic layer identical to<br>
the first.<br>
This multilayer form is very complex to prepare and in addition is specific to<br>
moguisteine.<br>
In this state of the art, the essential objective of the present invention is to propose<br>
an aqueous suspension of microcapsules of active principle(s), excluding amoxicillin, for<br>
the oral administration of the latter according to a modified-release profile, in which the<br>
coating of the microcapsules is designed in such a way that the release profile is not<br>
perturbed and does not depend on the maceration time of the microcapsules in the liquid<br>
(preferably aqueous) phase. Thus the active principle(s) contained in the microcapsules<br>
would be prevented from escaping into the liquid phase throughout the storage of the<br>
suspension, but a modified release of the active principle(s) would be allowed as soon as it<br>
entered an environment suitable for triggering the release, namely in vivo in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract and in vitro under the conditions of a dissolution test performed just<br>
after suspension of the microcapsules in the solvent (preferably aqueous) phase, using a<br>
type II apparatus according to the European Pharmacopoeia 3rd edition, in a phosphate<br>
buffer medium of pH 6.8, for a volume of 900 ml, at a temperature of 37°C.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an aqueous liquid<br>
suspension of microcapsules of active principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin) comprising a<br>
film coating formed of a single layer.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an aqueous liquid<br>
suspension of microcapsules of active principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin) in which the<br>
dissolved fraction originating from the microcapsules is less than or equal to 15% and<br>
preferably 5% of the total weight of active principles present in the microcapsules.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an aqueous liquid<br>
suspension of microcapsules of active principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin) in which one<br>
part of the active principle(s) is in an immediate-release form and the other part of the<br>
active principle(s) is in a modified-release form (microcapsules).<br>
Another essential objective of the present invention is to provide an aqueous<br>
suspension of microcapsules for the modified release of active principles (excluding<br>
amoxicillin) which makes it possible to release the active principle according to a release<br>
profile that is not degraded by the ageing of the suspension.<br>
Another essential objective of the present invention is to provide an aqueous<br>
suspension of microcapsules which is made up of individually coated particles of active<br>
principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin) and makes it possible to release the latter according to<br>
a prolonged and/or optionally delayed profile such that the release half-life t1/2 is between<br>
0.5 and 30 hours.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to propose an oral galenical form<br>
which is liquid and consists of a large number (for example in the order of several<br>
thousands) of microcapsules, this multiplicity statistically ensuring a good reproducibility<br>
of the transit kinetics of the AP throughout the gastrointestinal tract, thereby improving<br>
control of the bioavailability and hence improving efficacy.<br>
One essential objective of the present invention is to propose an oral liquid<br>
galenical form made up of a plurality of coated microcapsules which avoids the use of large<br>
amounts of coating agent, the weight fraction of coating agent being comparable to that of<br>
the monolithic forms.<br>
Another essential objective of the present invention is to provide a modified-release<br>
aqueous suspension in which the active principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin) is (are) in the<br>
form of a plurality of particles individually coated to form microcapsules and allowing the<br>
mixing of several active principles having different respective release times.<br>
Another essential objective of the present invention is to propose the use, as a<br>
means of treating human or veterinary diseases, of a (preferably aqueous) suspension of<br>
microcapsules consisting of particles of active principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin)<br>
individually coated so as to determine the modified release of the active principle(s)<br>
without the modified-release profile being affected by storage of the microcapsules in this<br>
liquid form in suspension.<br>
Another essential objective of the present invention is to propose a drug based on a<br>
preferably aqueous suspension of microcapsules consisting of particles of active<br>
principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin) individually coated so as to determine the modified<br>
release of the active principle(s) without the modified-release profile being affected by<br>
storage of the microcapsules in this liquid form in suspension.<br>
Having set themselves all the above objectives, among others, the inventors have<br>
succeeded in developing a multimicrocapsular galenical system in the form of a preferably<br>
aqueous suspension for the modified release of active principle(s), excluding amoxicillin,<br>
which:<br>
- does not degrade the optionally retarded, modified-release profile,<br>
- and is stable, easy to prepare, economic and effective.<br>
To do this the inventors have proposed to:<br>
- select a totally specific coating composition for the microcapsules,<br>
- and suspend the microcapsules in a (preferably aqueous) liquid phase saturated with<br>
active principle(s) or capable of being saturated with active principle(s) on contact with<br>
the microcapsules, using an amount of solvent (preferably water) that is limited but<br>
nevertheless sufficient for the suspension to be easy to swallow.<br>
Thus the invention which meets the objectives described above, among others,<br>
relates to a suspension of microcapsules in an aqueous liquid phase that allows the<br>
modified release of at least one active principle (excluding amoxicillin) and is intended for<br>
oral administration, characterized in that:<br>
¦ it comprises a plurality of microcapsules each consisting of a core containing at least<br>
one active principle (excluding amoxicillin) and of a film coating that:<br>
• is applied to the core,<br>
• controls the modified release of the active principle(s),<br>
• and has a composition corresponding to one of the following three families A, B<br>
andC:<br>
_ Family A<br>
? 1A - at least one film-forming polymer (P1) insoluble in the tract fluids, present<br>
in an amount of 50 to 90 and preferably of 50 to 80% by dry weight, based on<br>
the total weight of the coating composition, and consisting of at least one water-<br>
insoluble cellulose derivative;<br>
? 2A - at least one nitrogen-containing polymer (P2) present in an amount of 2 to<br>
25 and preferably of 5 to 15% by dry weight, based on the total weight of the<br>

N-vinylamide and/or poly-N-vinyllactam;<br>

and/or lubricants, it being possible for said agent to comprise only one or a<br>
mixture of the above-mentioned products;<br>
_ Family B<br>

fluids;<br>
? 2C - at least one water-soluble polymer;<br>
? 3C - at least one plasticizer;<br>
? 4C - optionally at least one surfactant/lubricant preferably selected from the<br>

¦ and the liquid phase is saturated or becomes saturated with active principle(s) on<br>
contact with the microcapsules.<br>
In terms of the present disclosure, the expression "microcapsules of active<br>
principle(s)" denotes microcapsules whose core comprises one or more active principles<br>
and optionally at least one excipient.<br>
This suspension according to the invention makes it possible to overcome the two<br>
main obstacles to the production of an aqueous suspension of microcapsules consisting of<br>
individually coated microparticles of active principles and allowing the modified release of<br>
the latter, these two obstacles being as follows:<br>
a) limiting the fraction of active principles immediately releasable from the microcapsules<br>
to a value of less than 15% and preferably 5% of the total weight of active principles<br>
used in the microcapsules;<br>
b) obtaining a modified-release system that is sufficiently robust to avoid any change or<br>
degradation of the release profile of the active principle(s) during storage of the<br>
aqueous suspension.<br>
Also, this suspension makes it possible to facilitate the oral administration of drugs<br>
which have high therapeutic doses, especially in the case of the elderly and children, there<br>
being a significant gain in terms of compliance and success of the treatment.<br>
Furthermore, for AP which have a limited absorption window, it is particularly<br>
advantageous for the modified-release form to be a plurality of microcapsules, as indicated<br>
in the preamble of the present disclosure.<br>

Preferably, the film coating consists of a single layer whose weight represents from<br>
1 to 50% and preferably from 5 to 40% of the total weight of the microcapsules.<br>
According to one preferred characteristic of the invention, the liquid phase is<br>
aqueous; even more preferably, it contains at least 20% of water and preferably at least<br>
50% by weight of water.<br>
This suspension according to the invention advantageously contains:<br>
- 30 to 95% by weight and preferably 60 to 85% by weight of liquid phase<br>
(advantageously water);<br>
- and 5 to 70% by weight and preferably 15 to 40% by weight of microcapsules.<br>
Advantageously, the amount of solvent liquid phase (preferably water) for the<br>
active principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin) is such that the proportion of dissolved active<br>
principle(s) originating from the microcapsules is less than or equal to 15% and preferably<br>
less than or equal to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the active principle(s)<br>
contained in the microcapsules.<br>
In a first embodiment of the invention, the liquid phase is at least partially and<br>
preferably totally saturated with active principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin) following the<br>
incorporation of the microcapsules into this liquid phase.<br>
In this embodiment, it is the active principle(s) contained in the microcapsules that<br>
saturate the liquid phase.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, the liquid phase is at least partially and<br>
preferably totally saturated with active principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin) by means of<br>
non-encapsulated active principle(s) prior to the incorporation of the microcapsules into<br>
this liquid phase. This embodiment is of particular value for the administration of<br>
amoxicillin in that it makes it possible to combine an immediate-release fraction with a<br>
modified-release fraction.<br>
In practice, this amounts to saturating the liquid phase with active principie(s)<br>
before the introduction of the microcapsules into the suspension, so that the active principle<br>
contained in the microcapsules plays no part, or virtually no part, in the saturation of the<br>
liquid phase. The diffusion of the active principle contained in the microcapsules is<br>
therefore suppressed or virtually suppressed.<br>
According to one preferred characteristic of the invention enabling this liquid oral<br>
formulation to be fully effective, the microcapsules have a particle size less than or equal to<br>
1000 microns, preferably of between 200 and 800 microns and particularly preferably of<br>
between 200 and 600 microns.<br>
"Particle size" is understood in terms of the invention as meaning that a proportion<br>
of at least 75% by weight of microcapsules have a diameter between the screen size limits<br>
in question.<br>
Again with the aim of improving efficacy, the amount of coating agent for the<br>
microcapsules advantageously represents from 1 to 50% and preferably 5 to 40% of the<br>
weight of the coated microcapsules. This advantageous characteristic is all the ... to<br>
acquire because, due to their small size, the microcapsules have a large specific surface<br>
area, accelerating the release.<br>
To control the in vivo in vitro release of the active principle(s), it is preferable<br>
according to the invention to use a film coating for the microcapsules which belongs to<br>
family A or C.<br>
For more detailed qualitative and quantitative information on this coating<br>
composition of family A, reference may be made to European patent EP-B-0 709 087, the<br>
content of which forms part of the present disclosure by way of reference.<br>
Another possible way of defining the liquid suspension according to the invention<br>
consists in considering an in vitro release profile obtained using a type II apparatus<br>
according to the European Pharmacopoeia 3rd edition, in a phosphate buffer medium of pH<br>
6.8 and at a temperature of 37°C, such that:<br>
? the proportion PI of active principle(s) released from the microcapsules during the first<br>
15 minutes of the dissolution test is such that:<br>
PI=15<br>
preferably PI = 5;<br>
? the active principle(s) remaining in the microcapsules is (are) released over a period<br>
such that the release time of 50% by weight of AP (t1/2) is defined as follows (in hours):<br>
0.5 = t1/2 = 30<br>
preferably 0.5 = t1/2 
Still with regard to its in vitro dissolution properties, the suspension according to<br>
the invention is characterized in that:<br>
- the initial in vitro release profile Pfi obtained just after suspension of the microcapsules<br>
in the solvent (preferably aqueous) phase, using a type II apparatus according to the<br>
European Pharmacopoeia 3rd edition, in a phosphate buffer medium of pH 6.8, for a<br>
volume of 900 ml, at a temperature of 37°C,<br>
- and the in vitro release profile Pf10 obtained 10 days after suspension of the<br>
microcapsules in the solvent (preferably aqueous) phase, using a type II apparatus<br>
according to the European Pharmacopoeia 3rd edition, in a phosphate buffer medium of<br>
pH 6.8, at a temperature of 37°C,<br>
are similar.<br>
The release profiles compared according to the recommendations of The European<br>
Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) - Human Medicines Evaluation<br>
Unit - / Committee for proprietary medicinal products (CPMP) - London, 29 July 1999,<br>
CPMP/QWP/604/96: note for guidance on quality of modified release products: A: oral<br>
dosage forms. B: transdermal dosage forms - section I (quality) - Annex 3: Similarity<br>
factor f2, produce a value of &gt;50 for the similarity factors f2 and can therefore be declared<br>
similar.<br>
These advantageous characteristics of the suspension according to the invention<br>
enable high doses of active principle(s) to be administered orally without difficulty and<br>
without detracting from the modified and optionally delayed release mode of the active<br>
principle.<br>
According to another of its advantageous physicochemical characteristics, the pH of<br>
the liquid suspension according to the invention can arbitrarily be acidic or neutral.<br>
It may be quite valuable to add at least one rheology modifier to the suspension. In<br>
particular, this can be one or more "viscosifiers" selected ... those commonly employed in<br>
the pharmaceutical industry and especially those disclosed in Handbook of pharmaceutical<br>
excipients - 3rd edition, Am. Pharmaceutical Association, Arthur H. KIBBE, 2000, ISBN<br>
0917330-96-X. Europe. 0-85369-381-1. Examples which may be mentioned are:<br>
- water-soluble cellulose derivatives (hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, etc.);<br>
- polyethylene glycols;<br>
- alginates and derivatives thereof;<br>
- carrageenans;<br>
agar-agar;<br>
- gelatin;<br>
- maltodextrins;<br>
- polydextrose;<br>
- guar, carob, acacia, xanthan, gellan and other gums;<br>
- polyvinyl alcohol;<br>
- povidone;<br>
- pectins;<br>
- silica gel;<br>
- native and modified starches and derivatives thereof;<br>
- dextrans;<br>
etc.<br>
It can also be advisable to introduce into the suspension at least one agent for<br>
modifying the solubility of the active principle in the solvent (preferably aqueous) liquid<br>
phase, for example salts, sugars, glycerol, etc. In fact, in the case of very soluble active<br>
principles, these solutes can limit the escape of the active principle from the microcapsules<br>
by lowering the saturation concentration of the active principle in the aqueous phase.<br>
For the suspension to have all the qualities of an oral galenical form that is easy to<br>
swallow, stable and palatable, it advantageously contains at least one other additive<br>
selected from the group comprising surfactants, colourants, dispersants, preservatives, taste<br>
improvers, flavourings, sweeteners, antioxidants and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of these additives which may be mentioned are those commonly<br>
employed in the pharmaceutical industry and especially those disclosed in<br>
Handbook of pharmaceutical excipients - 3rd edition. Am. Pharmaceutical Association,<br>
Arthur H. KIBBE, 2000, ISBN 0917330-96-X. Europe. 0-85369-381-1, or, in the case of<br>
emulsifiers, those described on page 5, lines 14 to 29, of EP-A-0 273 890, or again, in the<br>
case of thickeners, those indicated on page 5, lines 19 and 20, of EP-A-0 601 508.<br>
The active principles used to prepare the controlled-release suspensions according<br>
to the invention can be selected from at least one of the following wide varieties of active<br>
substances: antiulcer drugs, antidiabetics, anticoagulants, antithrombics, hypolipidaemics,<br>

Without implying a limitation, the invention applies more particularly to<br>
pharmaceutical active principles which have to be administered orally in high doses, for<br>
example of 500 to 1000 milligrams or more, and to paediatric suspensions.<br>
The active principle(s) is (are) preferably selected from the following compounds:<br>

montelukast, valaciclovir, ascorbic acid salts, diazepam, theophylline, ciprofloxacin,<br>
vancomycin, aminoglycosides, penicillins (except for amoxicillin) and mixtures thereof.<br>
According to another of its features, the present invention relates to a drug,<br>
characterized in that it comprises a suspension of modified-release microcapsules of active<br>
principle(s), as defined above.<br>
In more concrete terms, the invention further relates to a drug, or more exactly a<br>
galenical pack, characterized in that it comprises a kit for preparing the suspension as<br>
defined above, said kit containing:<br>
- microcapsules in substantially dry form containing the active principle(s) for saturating<br>
the liquid phase with active principle(s) once the two solid and liquid phases have been<br>
brought into contact;<br>
- and/or a mixture of microcapsules in substantially dry form containing the active<br>
principle(s) in the dose that is just necessary for modified release, together with<br>
immediate-release uncoated active principle(s) in a necessary and sufficient amount to<br>
saturate the liquid phase with active principle(s) once the saturation dose of active<br>
principle(s) and the liquid phase have been brought into contact;<br>
- and the liquid phase and/or at least part of the ingredients useful for its preparation,<br>
and/or the protocol for preparation of the suspension.<br>
This type of presentation of the drug according to the invention enables patients<br>
easily to prepare the modified-release suspension in a form that is stable, particularly in<br>
terms of modified release, for at least several days. The patient is thus guaranteed to have a<br>
drug that is easy to administer orally and perfectly effective from the therapeutic point of<br>
view.<br>
The microcapsules constituting the solid phase of the suspension according to the<br>
invention can be prepared by microencapsulation techniques available to those skilled in<br>
the art, the main techniques being summarized in the article by C. DUVERNEY and J.P<br>
BENOIT in "L"actualite chimique", December 1986. More precisely, the technique in<br>
question is microencapsulation by film coating, which yields individualized "reservoir"<br>
systems as opposed to matrix systems.<br>
For further details, reference may be made to patent EP-B-0 953 359 cited above.<br>
To produce the core based on active principle(s) (excluding amoxicillin) of the<br>
microcapsules according to the invention, it is advantageous to use, as starting materials,<br>
particles of active principle(s) of the desired size. Said particles can be crystals of active<br>
principle(s) which are pure and/or have undergone a pretreatment by one of the techniques<br>
conventionally employed in the art, for example granulation, in the presence of a small<br>
amount of-at least one conventional binder and/or an agent for modifying the intrinsic<br>
solubility characteristics of the AP.<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly from the point of view of its<br>
composition, properties and preparation with the aid of the Examples below, given solely<br>
by way of illustration, which demonstrate the variants and the advantages of the invention.<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of microcapsules of aciclovir:<br>
1000 g of aciclovir and 30 g of povidone® are mixed dry for 5 minutes. The mixture is<br>
granulated with water. The granules are dried at 40°C in a ventilated oven and then araded<br>
on a 500 mm screen. The 200-500 urn fraction is selected.<br>
700 g of granules obtained above are coated with 27.3 g of ethyl cellulose, 3.7 g of castor<br>
oil, 3.7 g of magnesium stearate and 2.9 g of povidone® dissolved in a 60/40 w/w<br>
acetone/isopropanol mixture, in a Glatt GPC-G1 fluidized air bed apparatus. Temperature<br>
of product: 40°C.<br>
Preparation of the suspension:<br>
0.58 g of microcapsules obtained above is placed in 37 ml of phosphate buffer of pH 6.8.<br>
Test:<br>
The above suspension is stored for 10 days at room temperature. After 10 days the<br>
suspension is analysed for dissolution using a type II apparatus according to the European<br>
Pharmacopoeia 3rd edition, phosphate buffer medium of pH 6.8, volume of 900 ml,<br>
temperature of 37°C, blade stirring at 100 rpm, UV detection at 252 nm.<br>
The result is shown in Figure 1 attached.<br>
The profiles are apparently identical: similarity factor f2 greater than 50. The<br>
microcapsules remain highly effective in aqueous suspension.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of microcapsules of spironolactone:<br>
Step 1: Granules<br>
45 g of spironolactone, 25 g of PEG 40 - hydrogenated castor oil and 30 g of povidone are<br>
first solubilized in a water/acetone/isopropanol mixture (5/57/38 w/w). This solution is<br>
then sprayed onto 800 g of cellulose spheres (of diameter between 300 and 500 Dm) in a<br>
Glatt GPC-G1 fluidized air bed apparatus.<br>
Step 2: Coating<br>
50 g of granules obtained above are coated with 1.44 g of ethyl cellulose, 0.16 g of castor<br>
oil, 0.64 g of poloxamer 188 and 0.96 g of povidone dissolved in an acetone/ isopropanol<br>
mixture (60/40 w/w), in a miniGlatt fluidized air bed apparatus.<br>
Preparation of the suspension:<br>
0.07 g of microcapsules obtained above is placed in 0.165 ml of phosphate buffer of pH<br>
6.8.<br>
Test:<br>
The above suspension is stored for 19 days at room temperature. After 19 days the<br>
suspension is analysed for dissolution using a type II apparatus according to the European<br>
Pharmacopoeia 3rd edition, phosphate buffer medium of pH 6.8, volume of 1000 ml,<br>
temperature of 37°C, blade stirring at 100 rpm, UV detection at 240 nm.<br>
The result is shown in Figure 2 attached.<br>
The profiles are apparently identical: similarity factor f2 greater than 50. The<br>
microcapsules remain very effective in aqueous suspension.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of microcapsules of metformin:<br>
740 g of metformin crystals (200-500 mm fraction) are coated with 192.4 g of ethyl<br>
cellulose, 26 g of castor oil, 26 g of magnesium stearate and 20.8 g of povidone® dissolved<br>
in a 60/40 w/w acetone/isopropanol mixture, in a Glatt GPC-G1 fluidized air bed<br>
apparatus. Temperature of product: 40°C.<br>
Preparation of the suspension (29% of free form and 71% of encapsulated form):<br>
50 g of microcapsules obtained above are mixed dry with 15 g of metformin crystals and<br>
0.7 g of xanthan gum in a 100 ml glass flask. 34.3 g of purified water are then added to the<br>
powder mixture. After manual stirring, a suspension is obtained which produces a<br>
sediment very slowly.<br>
The total metformin titre in the suspension is 0.52 g/ml.<br>
Stability test:<br>
The above suspension is stored for 12 days at room temperature. After 12 days the<br>
suspension is analysed for dissolution using a type II apparatus according to the European<br>
Pharmacopoeia 3rd edition, phosphate buffer medium of pH 6.8, volume of 900 ml,<br>
temperature of 37°C, blade stirring at 100 rpm, UV detection at 232 nm.<br>
The result is shown in Figure 3 attached.<br>
The profiles are apparently identical: similarity factor f2 greater than 50. The<br>
microcapsules remain very effective in aqueous suspension.<br>
Homogeneity test:<br>
The above suspension is stirred manually and then six 5 ml samples are taken with a<br>
graduated syringe. The metformin content of each sample is determined by HPLC and is<br>
shown below:<br>
It is seen that the samples are very homogeneous and that the dosage corresponds to the<br>
expected value of 2.60 g for 5 ml.<br>
This formulation can therefore be administered without risk of overdosing or underdosing.<br>
