f<br><br>
The invention relates to a power semiconductor module and a circuit arrangement having at least one power semiconductor module.<br>
Such power .semiconductor modules are already described, tor example, in Gennan Offenlegungsschriften DE-AI-39 31 634 and DE AI-43 30 070.<br>
In the case of these power semiconductor modules, which comprises a baseplate having at least one power semiconductor switching element, the power connections extend perpendicularly with respect to tile baseplate (see DE 39 31 634 Figure 4 and column 5, lines 24 ff. and DE 43 30 070 Figure 8). The power connections are passed out of the module housing perpendicularly with respect to the baseplate. This means that the control units have to be arranged at a certain distance, for example, above or alongside the modules. This incurs relatively long connecting lines to the control unit which serves to drive the module. The long connecting lines result in an undesirably high inductance of the arrangement, it being possible for this inductance to have a limiting effect, in particular with regard to high switching frequencies.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to specify a power semiconductor module in which the connecting lines to the control unit are as short as possible and the arrangement thereby has an inductance which is as low as possible.<br>
The object is achieved in the case of a power semiconductor module of tithe type mentioned in the<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a power semiconductor module, comprising: a housing and a baseplate, on which at least one power semiconductor switching element is arranged, the power semiconductor switching element having at least TVs power electrodes connected to corresponding power connections, said power connections extending parallel to the baseplate and passing out of the housing parallel to the baseplate, Tierney extending above one another in a plurality of planes and being connected to the nonexpanding power electrodes of the power semiconductor switching element by connecting wires, the power semiconductor module including a number of control and auxiliary  connections; characterized in that the control and auxiliary connections are passed out of the housing at right angles to the baseplate and that the control and auxiliary connections are pluggable into a control unit driving the module, and in tilt fastening means are provided on the module housing for fastening the control unit on said module housing.<br>
 	The present invention also provides a circuit arrangement having at least<br>
 	one power semiconductor module which is connected to a control unit which<br>
drives the module, wherein the power semiconductor module comprises: a housing having a baseplate on which at least one power semiconductor switching element is arranged, the power semiconductor switching element having at least two power electrodes   connected   to   corresponding   power connections,   said   power connections extending parallel to the baseplate and passing out of the housing parallel to the baseplate, thereby extending above one         another in a plurality' of planes and being connected to the corresponding power      electrodes of the power semiconductor switching element by connecting wires,       the power semiconductor modules including a plurality of control and auxiliary<br>
o<br>
CO<br><br>
connections wherein the control and auxiliary connections are passed out of the housing at right angles to the baseplate and the control and auxiliary connections arc piuggable into a control unit driving the module, said housing comprising tautening means provided on the t7iodule housing for fastening the control unit on said module housing; characterized in that the control unit is atoned parallel to the base plate on tile housing of the module.<br><br>
introduction  by  the  features  of  the   first  claim.<br>
The essence of the invention is therefore that the power connections extend parallel to the baseplate and are passed out of the housing parallel to the base¬plate. This makes it possible to mount the control unit directly on that surface of the module housing which faces away from the baseplate. This allows the use of short connecting lines and hence a low-inductance struc¬ture.<br>
In addition, if that control connection which has the smallest potential difference, ideally no potential difference at all, with respect to the control unit is arranged the furthest away from the baseplate, then this power connection still acts for the control unit as a shield for electromagnetic fields caused by the switching of  the  module.<br>
In order to fasten the control unit on the module, fastening means such as, for example, screw-holes and screws are provided on that side of the module housing which faces away from the baseplate. The control and auxiliary connections can be passed out at the top of the housing. The control unit is then plugged onto these connections and the control and auxiliary connections of the module and the corresponding connections of the control unit are connected, for example, by means of simple screw or plug contacts. This means that a direct connection between the control and auxiliary connections and the control unit is achieved, and the otherwise relatively long and hence inductance-loaded supply lines are dispensed with. Further exemplary embodiments emerge from  the  corresponding  dependent  claims.<br>
Consequently, modules according to the invention can be used to produce circuit arrangements in which the control unit of the modules is fitted directly on the modules and in which it is possible to establish the connection between the module and the control unit advantageously with a low inductance, with the result that the modules can be used particularly for higher frequencies.<br><br>

Figure  5    shows  a  sectional view of  a half-bridge module. The   reference   symbols   used   in   the   drawings   and<br>
their meaning  are  summarized  in  the  list  of  designations.<br>
In  principle,  like  parts  are  provided with  like  reference<br>
symbols  in  the  figures.<br>
Ways  of  implementing  the  invention<br>
Figure 3 shows the structure of a circuit arrangement having a power semiconductor module 1 and a control unit 12. The control unit 12 is fastened on the housing 2 of the module 1, for example by means of screws 10 which are passed through corresponding screw-holes 11. The module housing 2 can likewise have screw-holes 8, which are used for fastening in an installation. The power semiconductor module 1 has a number of control and auxiliary connections 13, which are connected to the control unit 12, in particular by means of a plug connec¬tion. The control and auxiliary connections are used, on the one hand, to turn the module 1 on and off and, on the other hand, to monitor it. In addition, the module 1 has at least two power connections 5 and 6, which are passed out of the housing 2 to the side. A load connection 7 is additionally provided in the case of a half-bridge module. Since the control unit 12 is put directly onto the housing 2 of the module, the connecting lines between the control and auxiliary connections 13 and the control unit   can   be   chosen   to   be   very   short   and   hence   of   low<br><br>
inductance.<br>
This we [sic] achieved by the fact that, as is shown in principle in Figure 1, the power connections 5 and 6 extend parallel to a baseplate 3 onto which a power semiconductor switching element 4 is fitted. The power semiconductor switching element is, in particular, an IGBT chip, that is to say a bipolar transistor chip having a gate which is arranged in an insulated manner. As Figure 2 shows from above and Figure 1 shows in section, the connection between the power electrodes and the corresponding power connections 5 and 6 can be established,   for  example,  by  means  of  bonding  wires  9.<br>
Therefore, a power semiconductor module according to the invention is structured in principle as follows: ceramic substrates 15 are soldered on a baseplate 3, for example a copper plate 8 mm thick, which can also still be used, if need be, as a cooler. The substrates are each assigned to a switching element 4. This comprises, for example, at least one IGBT chip with an associated freewheeling diode. The substrates 15 are metallized over the whole area. The power connections 5, 6 and, if applicable, 7 [sic] are supplied from the side by means of connecting lines 9, in particular by means of bonding wires ("wire bonds") or soldered strips ("solder clips"). The connecting lines 9 lead to the corresponding power connections 5 and 6, if applicable to the load connection 7 and to the control and auxiliary connections 13 which are arranged in different planes and extend parallel to the  baseplate.<br>
The power connections 5, 6 and, if applicable, 7 [sic] are passed, parallel to the baseplate 3, out of the housing 2 to the side. In contrast with the power connec¬tions 5, 6 and, if applicable, 7 [sic], the auxiliary and control connections 13 can be passed out at right angles to the baseplate 3. Using these connections, the control unit 12 can be connected by simply plugging onto the corresponding  connections.<br>
If that power connection, for example 6, which deviates   the   least,    with   reference   to   the   electrical<br><br>
potential,     from   that    of    the    control    unit    12    is    now arranged  the   furthest  away  from  the  baseplate   3   and  the nearest  to  the  control  unit   12,   then  this  power  connec¬tion  additionally  serves  as  an  electromagnetic  shield  as well.   Said  shield  protects  the  control  unit   12   from  the influence   of   the   electromagnetic   fields   caused   by   the switching  of  the  module.   These   fields  are  caused  by  the high  currents   and  voltages  which  are   to  be   switched  in the   shortest   possible   time   using   the   module.   Without special   shielding,   the   fields  may   lead  to  serious  mal¬functions  of  a  power-electronic  circuit  arrangement  and, in addition  to  other  influencing  factors,  may  also  hinder the  further  development  to  higher  switching  frequencies. It  is  also  possible using  the  structure  according to    the     invention    to    construct    complete    half-bridge modules  or  even more  extensive power-electronic  circuits, for   example   a   three-phase   module.    Figure   4    shows   the equivalent   circuit   diagram  of   a   half-bridge.   Here,   two switching   elements   4   are   connected   in   series   between   a positive  and  a  negative  connection.  Each  of  the  switching elements  is  at  least  one  switch  chip,  here  in  the  form  of an  IGBT  (IGBTl,   IGBT2),  having  an  associated  freewheeling diode   Dl,   D2.   The   common   junction   corresponds   in   this case  to  the  load  connection  7,   the  positive  and  negative connection   corresponds   to   the   load   connections    5    and 6   [sic].    The   two   IGBTs   are   driven   by   in   each   case   one gate  or  control  connection  13.<br>
Figure 5 shows such a module in section: the substrates 15 of the switching elements 4, that is to say the IGBTs (IGBTl, IGBT2, 4), are fitted on the base¬plate 3. The power connections 5 and 6 as well as the common load connection 7 are arranged in different planes and are connected to the corresponding electrodes of the semiconductor switches via the connecting wires 9. In the example illustrated, the two control connections 13 of the IGBTs are arranged on the same connection plane. In this case, the corresponding connection plane is struc¬tured, for excunple by means of conductor tracks, with the result   that   the   connections   are   electrically   isolated.<br><br>
Insulating layers 14 must be inserted between two adjac¬ent planes or connections. Of course, it is also conceiv¬able to arrange substrates and switching elements on both sides  of  the  baseplate  3.<br>
If such a half-bridge module is integrated into a structure as illustrated in Figure 3, then the load connection 7 is passed out in the figure to one side and the power connections 5 and 6 are passed out in different planes to the opposite side. It can also clearly be seen how the control unit 12 is plugged onto the control and auxiliary connections 13. The connection to the control unit 12 can be carried out, for example, by means of simple  plug  or  screw  connections.<br>
It is possible, therefore, by means of the structure according to the invention of a power semicon¬ductor module, to build [lacuna] low-inductance and hence rapid but nevertheless readily electromagnetically compatible circuit arrangement. This is of paramount importance  with  regard  to  higher  switching  frequencies.<br><br>
