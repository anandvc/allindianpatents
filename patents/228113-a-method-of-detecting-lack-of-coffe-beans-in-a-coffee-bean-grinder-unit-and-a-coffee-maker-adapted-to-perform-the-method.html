				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method of detecting lack of coffee<br>
beans in a coffee bean grinder unit, and a coffee maker adapted to perform the<br>
method.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Coffee makers of the kind referred to herein are adapted to prepare a<br>
fresh coffee beverage fully automatically. Such coffee makers comprise a coffee<br>
bean container for receiving coffee beans to be ground, a grinder unit for<br>
grinding the coffee beans, and a brewing unit to which the freshly ground coffee<br>
powder is fed. In the brewing unit, the coffee powder is compressed and,<br>
thereafter, hot pressurized brewing water flows through the compressed coffee<br>
powder to extract a coffee beverage. Such coffee makers are also called<br>
"Espresso Coffee Machines" in general language use.<br>
There is one particular problem in connection with these coffee<br>
makers, in as much as a lack of coffee beans in the grinder unit<br>
should be detected as soon as possible; otherwise, the drive motor of<br>
the grinder unit could overheat if it runs under no load conditions for a certain<br>
time. Another problem is seen in the fact that a relationship should be<br>
established as to the amount of coffee beans already ground in the actual<br>
grinding cycle once the lack of coffee beans has been detected; thereby, after<br>
refilling coffee beans, the grinding cycle can be continued to grind only the re<br><br>
maining amount of coffee beans required to complement the already<br>
ground amount such that the correct total amount of coffee powder<br>
results that is required to brew a proper coffee beverage. Other-<br>
wise, the already ground amount of coffee would have to be dis-<br>
carded without having been used and replaced by a new, full charge<br>
of coffee powder.<br>
Prior Art<br>
The detection of a lack of coffee beans in a grinder unit of a<br>
coffee maker by means of conventional sensing means is problem-<br>
atic, since these are subject to rapid contamination, the more so<br>
as coffee beans are fatty and because coffee dust develops during<br>
the grinding operation, that dust being destructive for most of<br>
the sensing means used up to now.<br>
Moreover, it is known in the prior art to measure the current;<br>
the electric motor driving the grinding unit draws and to concludes<br>
from the magnitude of the current to the presence or absence of<br>
coffee beans in the grinder unit. Such a method may be theoreti-<br>
cally possible since the motor of the grinder unit draws more cur-<br>
rent under load than during operating in a no load condition. How-<br>
ever, this method did not prove its reliability in practice be-<br>
cause, in most cases, a gearbox is arranged between motor and<br>
grinder unit, hampering the detection of a lack of coffee beans<br>
because, due to the high reduction ration of the gearbox, only a<br><br>
small difference in current draw can be observed when the motor is<br>
operated under load and under no load conditions, respectively.<br>
A further problem is presented by the fact that certain compo-<br>
nents of the grinder unit run in over the months and years, re-<br>
sulting in a continuous reduction of the current draw of the mo-<br>
tor; thus, the detection of a lack of coffee beans by means of<br>
measuring the current is additionally complicated and hampered,<br>
respectively.<br>
Finally, further parameters as, for instance, the ambient tem-<br>
perature, the ambient humidity, the kind, size and degree of<br>
roasting of the coffee beans to be ground, the selected degree ot<br>
grinding as well as changes and wear of the grinder unit due to<br>
aging can have an influence on the current draw and, therby, on<br>
the validity of the measurement.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method<br>
of detecting a lack of coffee beans in a coffee bean grinder unit<br>
of a coffee maker that is substantially independent of changing or<br>
adjustable parameters of the grinder unit, further that can be<br>
easily realized and that delivers a reliable indication of a lack<br>
of coffee beans. It is a further object of the invention to pro-<br>
vide a coffee maker, using the method of the invention, in which<br>
the means required to reliably detect a lack of coffee beans in<br><br>
glinder unit are cost efficient and simple in the practic<br>
application.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
To meet these and other objects, the present invention pro-<br>
vides, according to a first aspect, a method of detecting a lack<br>
of coffee beans in a coffee bean grinder unit. The method com-<br>
prises the steps of measuring the level and/or the spectrum of an<br>
oscillation generated by the coffee bean grinder unit during is<br>
operation, and deciding whether or not coffee beans are present in<br>
the coffee bean grinder unit in dependence of the magnitude of the<br>
measured level and/or the nature of the measured spectrum of the<br>
oscillation. The grinding operation is interrupted if it is de-<br>
cided that no coffee beans are present in the coffee bean grinder<br>
unit.<br>
According to a second aspect, the invention provides a coffee<br>
maker adapted to use the method described herein above. It com-<br>
prises a coffee bean container, a grinder unit adapted to grind<br>
coffee beans, a brewing unit having a brewing chamber for extract-<br>
ing the ground coffee beans by means of hot, pressurized brewing<br>
water, and at least one sensor means for recording the lost<br>
and/or the spectrum of the oscillation generating<br>
unit during the operation of the<br><br>
Thus, the fundamental idea of the invention consists in measuring the<br>
level and/or the spectrum of an oscillation generated by the grinder unit during its<br>
operation, and to decide on the basis of the measurement results whether beans<br>
are still present in the grinder unit or whether the latter one operates without<br>
load, i.e. without containing any coffee beans to be ground. Anyway, it has been<br>
shown that it is basically possible to detect the presence or lack of coffee beans<br>
in the grinder unit both on the basis of the measured level of oscillations and the<br>
measured nature of the spectrum of these oscillations.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the level of the oscillations is continuously<br>
recorded and the operation of the grinder unit is stopped if the measured level<br>
changes by more than a preset value or if it falls below a reference value.<br>
Thereby, particularly, advantage is taken of the fact that the level of oscillations<br>
is substantially higher during a grinding operation than during an operation of the<br>
grinder unit under no load conditions.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
A preferred embodiment of the method and of the coffee maker according<br>
to the invention will be further described in the following, with reference to the<br>
sole drawing, showing a strictly schematic illustration of a coffee maker.<br><br>
Detailed Description of a Preferred Embodiment<br>
The coffee maker 1 schematically shown in the drawing com-<br>
prises a coffee bean container 2, a coffee grinder 3, a brewing<br>
assembly 6, a beverage outlet 9, a sensor 11, an electronic moni-<br>
toring and analyzing unit 13 as well as an electronic control unit<br>
16. The coffee grinder 3 comprises an electric motor 4, driving by<br>
means of a reduction gearbox (not shown) at least one of two<br>
grinding wheels 5a, 5b. The coffee grinder 3 is located below the<br>
coffee bean container 2 and communicates with the coffee bean con-<br>
tainer 2 by means of a passage 2a.<br>
A sensor 11 is attached to the housing 3a of the coffee<br>
grinder 3 and connected to the electronic monitoring and analyzing<br>
unit 13 by means of a conductor 12. The electronic monitoring and<br>
analyzing unit 13 itself is connected to the electronic control<br>
unit 16, and the latter one is connected to the coffee grinder 3<br>
by means of a control conductor 17.<br>
The brewing assembly 6 comprises a brewing chamber 7, serving<br>
for extracting the coffee and coffee powder 8, respectively,<br>
ground by the coffee grinder 3. The coffee powder 8 received in<br>
the brewing chamber 7 is compressed by means of a not shown piston<br>
and, thereafter, extracted by the brewing water fed into the brew-<br>
ing chamber 7 under pressure. The coffee beverage prepared in the<br>
brewing assembly 6 can flow through the beverage outlet 9 into a<br>
coffee cup put below the latter one.<br><br>
Out of the two grinding wheels 5a, 5b, preferably only the<br>
grinding wheel 5a is driven by the electric motor 4, while the<br>
other grinding wheel is stationary and torque proofly attached to<br>
the housing 3a of the coffee grinder 3.<br>
The sensor 11 attached to the housing 3a of the coffee grinder<br>
3 is adapted to record a vibration or oscillation level, or a vi-<br>
bration or oscillation spectrum generated by the coffee grinder 3<br>
during its operation. The present invention takes advantage of the<br>
fact that the coffee grinder 3 generates vibration or oscillations<br>
during its operation, the spectrum and particularly the level<br>
thereof distinctively changing depending on whether coffee beans<br>
are ground in the coffee grinder 3 or the coffee grinder runs<br>
without having any coffee beans to be ground in it, i.e. in a no<br>
load condition.<br>
For monitoring the vibration or oscillations, it has proven to<br>
be advantageous to attach the sensor 11 to the housing 3a of the<br>
coffee grinder 3 or to a housing portion thereof. With a sensor 11<br>
attached in this way, the vibration or oscillations of the housing<br>
3a, excited by the operation of the electric motor 4 driving at<br>
least one of the two grinding wheels 5a, 5b, can be easily de-<br>
tected and, subsequently, electronically interpreted by the elec-<br>
tronic monitoring and analyzing unit 13. Thereby, the electronic<br>
monitoring and analyzing unit 13 comprises a filter and amplifier<br>
circuitry 14 provided with a low pass filter as well as a thresh-<br><br>
old value switching circuitry 15. The threshold value switching<br>
circuitry 15 can be realized, for instance, by a comparator, com-<br>
paring the measured value with a reference value and producing an<br>
output signal to the electronic control unit 16 as soon as the<br>
measurement value exceeds the reference value or falls below the<br>
reference value. In the case when a decision has to be take re-<br>
garding<br>
-	beans are present in the coffee bean container 2, or<br>
-	the coffee bean container 2 does not contain any beans,<br>
on the basis of the measured vibration or oscillation level, the<br>
filter/amplifier circuitry 14 is preferably designed such that<br>
short peak-like level changes art not interpreted as lack of<br>
beans. Test measurements made with different existing coffee<br>
grinding units resulted in the fact that the vibration/oscillation<br>
level of the housing 3a of the grinding unit, depending on the de-<br>
sign of the grinding unit and the boundary conditions, is differ-<br>
ent by a factor between 2 and 40 in the two operating conditions<br>
discussed here, i.e. the grinding unit is operated under load and<br>
grinds coffee beans, and the grinding unit is operated without<br>
load, i.e. it runs, but no beans are ground. Particularly, the<br>
level of vibration/oscillation is, under worst case conditions,<br>
twice as high when coffee beans are ground then when the grinding<br>
unit runs without load.<br><br>
Using a piezo-electric sensor 11, directly attached to the<br>
housing 3a of the grinder 3, differences of the level of vibra-<br>
tion/oscillation up to a factor of 15 have been measured in the<br>
two operation modes, i.e. grinding beans (under load operation) or<br>
no load operation (no beans present to be ground).<br>
Moreover, by setting a second threshold value, a blocking of<br>
the grinding unit can be detected.<br>
As soon as the electronic monitoring and analyzing unit 13<br>
recognizes a lack of coffee beans in the grinder unit 3, a corre-<br>
sponding signal is sent to the control unit 16 which in turn stops<br>
the electric motor 4 of the grinder unit 3. Simultaneously, on a<br>
display (not shown) of the coffee maker, a notice appears that the<br>
coffee bean container 2 is empty and needs refill.<br>
Instead of monitoring and analyzing the level of vibration or<br>
oscillation of the housing 3a of the grinder unit 3, also the<br>
spectrum of vibration/oscillations of the housing 3a of the<br>
grinder unit 3 can be recorded and processed by means of the sub-<br>
sequent monitoring and analyzing unit 13. Test have shown that the<br>
vibration spectrum and the vibration frequency, respectively, of<br>
the housing 3a of the grinder unit 3 changes distinctively between<br>
operating the grinding unit 3 under load and operating it in a no-<br>
load condition, i.e. without coffee beans to be ground. Particu-<br>
larly, the vibration spectrum and the vibration frequency, respec-<br>
tively, of the housing 3a of the grinder unit 3 is lower by as<br><br>
much as 50% under no-load condition. It is understood that both<br>
parameters, i.e. the level of vibration and the spectrum of vibra-<br>
tion, can be used simultaneously for detecting a lack of coffee<br>
beans in the grinder unit 3.<br>
Instead of a piezo-electric sensor, an inductive or a capaci-<br>
tive sensor could be used. Also the provision of one or more<br>
strain gauge(s) is possible, taking the function of the sensor. A<br>
further possibility is the provision of a microphone recording the<br>
airborne sound or the impact sound of the housing 3a of the<br>
grinder unit 3.<br>
Preferably, the vibration or oscillation of the housing 3a of<br>
the grinder unit 3 is measured and processed only during an actual<br>
grinding cycle. By detecting or measuring what amount of coffee<br>
beans prior to stopping the grinder unit 3 has been ground, in<br>
other words, what amount of beans has been ground between the<br>
start of the grinder unit 3 and the moment when it was detected<br>
that it runs in a no-load condition, the grinding operation can be<br>
continued, after the coffee bean container 2 having been refilled,<br>
until the desired total amount of coffee beans has been ground.<br>
This presents the advantage that the already ground amount of cof-<br>
fee beans can still be used for preparing the coffee beverage.<br>
Measuring the amount of coffee beans ground prior to stopping the<br>
grinder due to the lack of beans in the coffee bean container 2<br>
can be accomplished, for example, by measuring the number of revo-<br><br>
lutions of the coffee grinder 3 between the start of the grinding<br>
operation and the stop of the motor 4 under the influence of the<br>
control unit 16 due to lack of beans.<br>
Monitoring and analyzing the vibrations/oscillations of the<br>
housing 3a of the grinder unit 3 preferably is started simultane-<br>
ously with the grinding operation and also stopped therewith or<br>
shortly before.<br>
The method and the coffee maker according to the present in-<br>
vention present the following advantages:<br>
•	Cost efficient and simple design;<br>
•	Quick detection of a lack of beans;<br>
•	No run-in time of the grinding unit necessary;<br>
•	Useable with almost and type of grinder unit;<br>
•	Changes of the behavior of the grinder unit due to aging do<br>
not have a substantial influence on the measured result;<br>
•	Substantially temperature independent operation;<br>
•	Substantially friction independent operation;<br>
•	Measured result substantially independent of the size, kind<br>
and degree of roasting of the coffee beans;<br>
•	Substantially humidity independent operation;<br>
•	Galvanic separation between sensor and grinder unit; and<br><br>
• The grinding operation can be continued, after the coffee<br>
been container having been refilled, up to the desired amount<br>
of ground coffee.<br><br>
