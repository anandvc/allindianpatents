METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR FEEDING AND BURNING A PULVERIZED FUEL IN A GLASS MELTING FURNACE, AND BURNER FOR USE IN THE SAME.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a method and system for feeding and burning a pulverized fuel in a glass melting furnace and, more specifically to a method and system for feeding and burning pulverized petroleum coke in a glass meting furnace and a burner for use in the same. <br>
RELATED PRIOR ART<br>
Melting glass has been done in different kinds of furnaces and of the types of fuels, depending on the final characteristics of the product and also regarding the thermal efficiency of the melting and refining processes. Unit melter furnaces have been used to melt glass( by means of gas fuel), these furnaces have several burners along the sides of the furnace, the whole unit looks like a close box where there is a chimney that can be placed either in the beginning of the feeder or at the very end of the furnace, it means, going downstream. However there is an enormous heat loss in the glass leaving high-temperature operating furnaces. At 2500Â° F, for example, the heat in the flue gases is 62 per cent of the heat input for a natural gas fired furnace.<br><br>
In order to take advantage of the remaining heat of the flue gases, a more sophisticated and expensive design come out, named as the regenerative furnace. It is well known that, to operate a regenerative glass melting furnace, a plurality of gas burners are associated with a pair of sealed regenerators disposed side-by-side. Each regenerator has a lower chamber, a refractory structure above the lower chamber and an upper chamber above the structure. Each regenerator has a respective port connecting the respective upper chamber with a melting and refining chamber of the furnace. The burners are arranged to burn fuel, such as natural gas, liquid petroleum, fuel oil or other gaseous or liquid fuels which are suitable for use in the glass melting furnace and thereby supply heat for melting and refining the glass making materials in the chamber. The melting and refining chamber is fed with glass making materials at one end thereof at which is located a doghouse and has a molten distributor disposed at the other end thereof, which comprises a series of ports through which molten glass may be removed from the melting and refining chamber.<br><br>
The burners may be mounted in a number of possible configurations, for example a through-port configuration, a side-port configuration or an under-port configuration. Fuel, e.g. natural gas, is fed from the burner into the incoming stream of pre-heated air coming from each regenerator during the firing cycle, and the resultant flame and products of combustion produced in that flame extend across the surface of the melting glass, and transfer heat to that glass in the melting and refining chamber.<br>
In operation, the regenerators are cycled alternately between combustion air and exhaust heat cycles. Every 20 minutes, or 30 minutes, depending on the specific furnaces, the path of the flame is reversed. The objective of each regenerator is to store the exhausted heat, which allows a greater efficiency and a higher flame temperature that could otherwise be the case with cold air.<br>
For operating the glass melting furnace, the fuel fed to the burners and the combustion air supplied is controlled by measuring at the port mouth and the top of the structure, the quantity of oxygen and combustible material present so as to ensure that within the melting chamber or at points along the melting chamber, the combustion air fed is less than that required for complete combustion of the fuel being supplied.<br><br><br>
In the past, the fuel used to melt glass was fuel oil, coming from distillation of petroleum. For many years this kind of fuel was used, but the tighten of environmental regulations have been pushing for reduction of fuel oil, since this kind of oil has impurities coming from the petroleum crude oil, such as, sulphur, vanadium, nickel, and some other heavy metals. This kind of fuel oil produce pollutants such as SOx, NOx and particulates. Recently the glass industry has been used natural gas as a cleaner fuel. All the heavy metals and sulphur coming in the liquid stream of petroleum residuals from distillation are not contained in natural gas. However, the high temperature produced in the flame of natural gas has been very effective for producing more NOx than other pollutants. In this sense, a lot of effort has been done in order to develop low NOx burners for firing natural gas. Additionally, different technologies have been developed to prevent the NOx formation. An example of this is the Oxy-fuel Technology, which utilizes oxygen instead of air for the combustion process. This technology has the inconvenient of require a unit melter furnace with a special preparation of the refractories since air infiltration need to be prevented. The use of oxygen also produced a higher temperature flame, but with the absence of nitrogen the NOx production is drastically reduced.<br><br><br>
The other inconvenient of oxy-fuel process is the cost of the oxygen itself. In order to make it cheaper it needs to place an oxygen plant besides the furnace in order to feed the required oxygen by the melting process.<br>
However, the continuing upward spiral of energy costs (primarily natural gas) have forced the major float glass manufacturers to add "surcharges" to truckloads of flat glass. Natural gas prices have increased over 120% this year (in Mexico only or elsewre), far above previous estimates.<br>
The general consensus among Glass Industry insiders is that Distributors will be forced to take a close look at these new 'surcharges', and most likely be forced to pass them along.<br>
Taking into account the previous art, the present invention is related to apply different technologies to reduce the melting cost, using a solid fuel coming from the petroleum residuals of distillation towers, such as petroleum coke, in order to be used for glass production in an environmentally clean way.<br>
The main difference of this type of fuel regarding fuel oil and natural gas is the physical state of the matter, since fuel oil is a liquid phase, natural gas is a gas phase while petroleum coke for instance is a solid. Fuel oil and petroleum coke have the same kinds of impurities, since both of them are coming from residuals of distillation tower of crude oil. The significant difference is the amount<br><br><br>
of impurities contained in each of these. Petroleum coke is produced in three types of different processes called delayed, fluid and flexi. The residuals from the distillation process are placed in drums and then heated up to from 900Â° to 1000Â° Farenheit degrees for up to 36 hours in order to take out most of the remaining volatiles from the residuals. The volatiles are extracted from the top of the coking drums and the remaining material in the drums is a hard rock make of around 90 percent of carbon and the rest of all the impurities from the crude oil used. The rock is extracted from the drums using hydraulic drills and water pumps.<br>
A typical composition of petroleum coke is given as follow: carbon about 90%; hidrogen about 3%; nitrogen from about 2% to 4%; oxigen about   2%; sulphur from about 0.05% to 6%; and others about 1%. USE OF PETROLEUM COKE<br>
Petroleum solid fuels have already been using in cement and steam power generation industries. According to the Pace Consultants Inc. the use of petroleum coke in years 1999 for cement and power generation were between the 40% and 14% respectively.<br>
In both industries, the burning of petroleum coke is used as a direct fire system, in which the atmosphere produced by the combustion of the fuel is in<br><br><br>
direct contact with the product. In the case of cement production, a rotary kiln is needed in order to provide a thermal profiled require by the product. In this rotary kiln, a shell of molten cement is always formed avoiding the direct contact of the combustion gases and flames with the refractories of the kiln, avoiding attack thereof. In this case, the calcined product (cement) absorbs the combustion gases, avoiding the erosive and abrasive effects of vanadium, S03 and NOx in the rotary kiln.<br>
However,  due to the  high  sulfur content and  vanadium the  use of petroleum coke as fuel is not of use common in the glass industry, due to the effect negative on the structure of the refractories and to environmental problems. PROBLEMS ON THE REFRACTORIES<br>
The glass industry use several kinds of refractory materials, and most of them are used to accomplish different functions, not only the thermal conditions but also the chemical resistance and mechanical erosion due to the impurities contained by fossil fuels.<br>
Using a fossil fuel as the main energy source represents an input to the furnace of different kinds of heavy metals contained in the fuel, such as: vanadium pentoxide, iron oxide, chromium oxide, cobalt, etc. In the process of combustion most of the heavy metals evaporate because of the low vapor<br><br>
 pressure of the metal oxide and the high temperature of the melting furnace.<br>
The chemical characteristic of the flue gases coming out of the furnace is mostly acid because of the high content of sulphur from the fossil fuel. Also the vanadium pentoxide presents an acid behavior such as the sulphur flue gases. Vanadium oxide is one of metals that represents a source of damage to basic refractories, because the acid behavior of this oxide in gaseous state. Is well known that the vanadium pentoxide reacts strongly with calcium oxide forming a dicalcium silicate at 1275 Celsius degrees.<br>
The dicalcium silicate continues the damage to form a phase of merwinite and the to monticelite and finally to forsterite, which reacting with vanadium pentoxide to form a low melting point of tricalcium vanadate.<br>
The only way to reduce the damage caused to basic refractories is the reduction of the amount of calcium oxide in the main basic refractory in order to avoid the production of dicalcium silicate that continues reacting with vanadium pentoxide until the refractory may fail.<br>
On the other hand, the main problem with the use of the petroleum coke is related with the high sulfur and vanadium content, which have a negative effect on the structure of the refractories in the furnaces. The foremost requirement<br><br><br>
characteristics of a refractory is to withstand exposure to elevated temperature for extended periods of time. In addition it must be able to withstand sudden changes in temperature, resist the erosive action of molten glass, the corrosive action of gases, and the abrasive forces of particles in the atmosphere.<br>
The effect of the vanadium on the refractories has been studied in different the papers, i.e. Roy W. Brown and Karl H. Sandmeyer in the paper " Sodium Vanadate's effect on superstructure refractories", Part I and Part II, The Glass Industry Magazine, November and December 1978 issues. In this paper the investigators tested different cast refractories which were centered on overcoming the vanadium attack in the flowing cast compositions, such as alumina-zirconia-silica (AZS), alpha-beta alumina, alpha alumina and beta alumina, which are commonly used in glass tank superstructures.<br>
J.R. Mclaren and H. M. Richardson in the paper "The action of Vanadium Pentoxide on Aluminum Silicate Refractories" describe a series of experiments in which cone deformation were carried out on sets of ground samples from bricks with alumina content of 73%, 42% and 9%, each sample containing admixtures of vanadium pentoxide, alone or in combination with sodium oxide or calcium oxide.<br><br><br>
The discussion of the results were focused on the action of Vanadium Pentoxide, the action of Vanadium Pentoxide with Sodium Oxide and the Action of Vanadium Pentoxide with Calcium oxide. They concluded that:<br>
1.- Mullite resisted the action of vanadium pentoxide at temperatures up to 1700X.<br>
2.- No evidence was found of the formation of crystalline compounds or solid solutions of vanadium pentoxide and alumina or of vanadium pentoxide and silica.<br>
3.- Vanadium pentoxide may act as a mineralizer during the slagging of alumino-silicate refractories by oil ash, but it is not a major salgging agent.<br>
4.- Low-melting compounds are formed between vanadium pentoxide and sodium or calcium oxides, specially the former.<br>
5.- In reactions between either sodium or calcium vanadates and alumino-silicates, lower-melting-point slags are formed with bricks high in silica than with bricks highs in alumina.<br>
T.S. Busby and M. Carter in the paper "The effect of SO3, Na2S04 and V2O5 on the bonding minerals of basic refractories", Glass Technology Vol. 20, No. April, 1979, tested a number of spinels and silicates, the bond minerals of basic refractories, in a sulphurous atmosphere between 600 and 1400Â°C, both with and without additions of Na2SCM and V2O5. It was found that some MgO or<br><br><br>
CaO in these minerals was converted to the sulphate. The reaction rate was increased by the presence of Na2S04 or V2O5. Their results indicate that the CaO and MgO in basic refractories can be converted to the sulphate if they are used in a furnace where suphur is present in the waste gases. The formation of calcium sulphate ocuurs below 1400X and that of magnesium sulphate below about 1100Â°C.<br>
However, as was described of the above, the effect of the vanadium on the refractories produce a great amount of problems in the glass furnaces, which has not solved in its totallity <br>
PETROLEUM COKE AND THE ENVIRONMENT<br>
Another problem of the use of the petroleum coke is related with the environment. The high content of sulphur and metals as nickel and vanadium produced by the combustion of the petroleum coke have provoked environmental problems. However, already exist developments for reduce or desulphurate the petroleum coke with a high content of sulphur (over 5% by weight). For example, the US patent No. 4389388 issued to Charles P. Goforth on June 21, 1983, concerns to the desulfurization of petroleum coke. Petroleum coke is processed to reduce the sulfur content. Ground coke is contacted with hot hydrogen, under<br><br><br>
pressurized conditions, for a residence time of about 2 to 60 seconds. The desulfurized coke is suitable for metallurgical or electrode uses.<br>
The US patent No. 4857284 issued to Rolf Hauk on August 15, 1989, is related to a Process for removing sulphur from the waste gas of a reduction shaft furnace. In this patent it is described a novel process for removing the sulphur contained in a gaseous compound by absorbtion from at least part of the waste gas of a reduction shaft furnace for iron ore. The waste gas is initially cleaned in a scrubber and cooled, followed by desulphurization, during which the sulphur-absorbing material is constituted by part of the sponge iron produced in the reduction shaft furnace. Desulphurization advantageously takes place at a temperature in the range 30Â°C to 60Â° C. It is preferably carried out on the CO2 separated from the blast furnace gas and the blast furnace gas part used as export gas.<br>
The US Patent No. 4894122 issued to Arturo Lazcano-Navarro, et al, on January 16, 1990, is related to a process for the desulphurization of residuals of petroleum distillation in the form of coke particles having an initial sulphur content greater than about 5% by weight. Desulphurization is effected by means of a continuous electrothermal process based on a plurality of sequentially connected fluidized beds into which the coke particles are successively introduced. The<br><br><br>
necessary heat generation to desulphurize the coke particles is obtained by using the coke particles as an electrical resistance in each fluidized bed by providing a pair of electrodes that extend into the fluidized coke particles and passing an electrical current through the electrodes and through the fluidized coke particles. A last fluidized bed without electrodes is provided for cooling the desulphurized coke particles after the sulphur level has been reduced to less than about 1% by weight.<br>
The US Patent No. 5259864 issued to Richard B. Greenwalt on November 9, 1993, is related to a method for both disposing of an environmentally undesirable material comprising petroleum coke and the sulfur and heavy metals contained therein and of providing fuel for a process of making molten iron or steel preproducts and reduction gas in a melter gasifier having an upper fuel charging end, a reduction gas discharging end, a lower molten metal and slag collection end, and means providing an entry for charging ferrous material into the melter gasifier; introducing petroleum coke into the melter gasifier at the upper fuel charging end; blowing oxygen-containing gas into the petroleum coke to form at least a first fluidized bed of coke particles from the petroleum coke; introducing ferrous material into the melter gasifier through the entry means, reacting<br><br><br>
petroleum coke, oxygen and particulate ferrous material to combust the major portion of the petroleum coke to produce reduction gas and molten iron or steel preproducts containing heavy metals freed from combustion of the petroleum coke and a slag containing sulfur freed from combustion of the petroleum coke.<br>
An additional factor to be considered in the glass industry is the control of the environment mainly the air pollution. The melting furnace contributes over 99% of both particulates and gaseous pollutants of the total emissions from a glass plant. The fuel waste gas from glass melting furnaces consists mainly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, water vapour, sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides. The waste gases released from melting furnaces consist mainly of combustion gases generated by fuels and of gases arising from the melting of the batch, which in turn depends on chemical reactions taking place within this time. The proportion of batch gases from exclusively flame-heated furnaces represents 3 to 5 % of the total gas volume.<br>
The proportion of the air-polluting components in the fuel waste gas depends on the type of the firing fuel, its heating value, the combustion air temperature, the burner design, the flame configuration, and the excess of air<br><br><br>
supply.  The sulphur oxides  in the waste gases of glass  melting furnaces originated from the fuel used, as well as from the molten batches.<br>
Various mechanisms have been proposed that include volatilization of these metal oxides and as hydroxides. Whatever the case, it is well known as the result of chemical analysis of the actual particulate matter, that more than 70% of the materials are sodium compounds, about 10% to 15% are calcium compounds, and the balance are mostly magnesium, iron, silica and alumina.<br>
Another important considerations in the glass melting furnace is the emission of S02. The emission of SO2 is a function of the sulfur introduced in the raw materials and fuel. During the time of furnace heating such as after a rise in production level, an abundance of SO2 is given off. The emissions rate of SO2 ranges from about 2.5 pounds per ton of glass melted to up to 5 pounds per ton. The concentration of SO2 in the exhaust is generally in the 100 to 300 ppm range for melting with natural gas. While using high sulfur fuel, approximately 4 pounds of S02 per ton of glass for every 1 % of sulfur in the fuel is added.<br>
On the other hand, the formation of NOx as result of combustion processes has been studied and described by a number of authors (Zeldovich, J. The<br><br><br>
oxidation of Nitrogen in Combustion and explosions. Acta. Physiochem. 21 (4) 1946; Edwards, J.B. Combustion: The formation and emissions of trace species. Ann Arbor Science Publishers, 1974. p-39). These were recognized and by the Emissions Standards Division, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, USEPA, in their report on "NOx Emissions from glass manufacturing" include Zeldovich on homogeneous NOx formation and Edwards with his presentation of empirical ecuations. Zeldovich developed rate constants for the formation of NO and N02 as the result of high temperature combustion processes.<br>
Finally under normal operating condition, where flames are adjusted properly and the furnace is not starved for combustible air, very little CO or other residuals from incomplete combustion of fossil fuel are found in the exhaust. The gas concentration of these species will be less than 100 ppm, probably lower than 50 ppm, with a production rate of less than 0.2 %/ton. The control for these pollutants is simply a proper combustion set up.<br>
Processing techniques for the reduction of gaseous emissions are essentially restricted to the proper selection of firing fuels and raw materials, as well as to furnace design and operation. The US Patent No. 5053210 issued to Michael Buxel et al, on October 1, 1991, describes a method and apparatus for<br><br><br>
the purification of flue gases, particularly for the desulphurization of and NOx -elimination from flue gas by multistage adsorption and catalytic reaction in gravity-flow moving beds of granular, carbon-bearing materials contacted by a transverse steam of the gas, in which a minimum of two moving beds are arranged in series with reference to the gas route so that NOx -elimination takes place in the second or any downstream moving bed. Where large volumes of flue gas from industrial furnaces must be purified, purification is adversely affected by the formation of gas streaks with widely varying sulphur dioxide concentrations. This disadvantage is eliminated in that the prepurified flue gas leaving the first moving bed and having a locally variable sulphur dioxide concentration gradient is subjected to repeated mixing before ammonia is added as reactant for NOx -elimination.<br>
The US patent No. 5636240 issued to Jeng-Syan et al, on June 3, 1997, is related to an air pollution control process and apparatus for glass furnaces for use in the furnace's waste gas outlet including passing the waste gases through a spray type neutralization tower to remove sulphates in the waste gases by spraying an absorbent (NaOH) to reduce the opacity of exhaust gas, and<br><br><br>
employing a pneumatic powder feeding device to feed flyash or calcium hydroxide periodically in a path between the spray type neutralization tower and a bag house to maintain normal functioning of the filter bag in the bag house. <br>
BURNERS FOR PULVERIZED FUEL<br>
Finally, for the burning of pulverized or dust petroleum coke is necessary to consider a special type of burner design. Generally, ignition energy is supplied to a combustible fuel-air mixture for igniting the burner flame. Some burner systems have been developed to burn pulverized fuel as coal o petroleum coke.<br>
PCT application PCT/EP83/00036 of Uwe Wiedmann et al, published on September 1, 1983, describes a burner for pulvurulent, gaseous and/or liquid fuels. This burner has an ignition chamber with a wall, which opens out and having the rotation symmetry, as well as an exhaust pipe connected thereto. At the center of the chamber wall, there is arranged the inlet of a pipe for the admission of a fuel jet as well as an air supply surrounding said inlet for the admission of a vortex of combustion air which produces, inside the ignition chamber, a hot recirculation stream mixing the fuel jet and heating the latter at the ignition temperature. The air quantity of the vortex supplied to the ignition chamber is only a portion of the total combustion air required. In the area between<br><br><br>
the chamber wall and the exhaust pipe there is provided a second air admission pipe through which another portion of the combustion air may be introduced in the ignition chamber, said portion being totally or partially mixed with the fuel jet. The sum of the combustion air portions participating within the ignition chamber to the mixture with the fuel jet (an hence to the ignition and initiation of the combustion) is adjusted so as not exceed 50% of the total combustion air required. By conjugating ail those measures, there is provided a burner particularly appropriate for the production of heat for industrial process and further having at intermediary and variable power rates a stable ignition producing a flame with an elongate and thin form in the combustion chamber and thus with a low radial deflection of particles.<br>
The US patent No. 4412810 issued to Akira Izuha et al, on November 1, 1983, is related to a pulverized coal burner capable of carrying out combustion in a stable state with a reduction in the amounts of NOx, Co, and unburned carbon produced as the result of the combustion.<br><br><br>
The US Patent No. 4531461 issued to William H. Sayler on July 30, 1985, is related to a system for pulverizing and burning solid fuel, such as coal or other fossil fuel, and for burning such pulverized fuels suspended in a stream of air, principally in connection with industrial furnaces such as those used to heat gypsum-processing kettles and metallurgical furnaces.<br>
The US patent 4602575 issued to Klaus Grethe on July 29, 1986, is related a Method of burning petroleum coke dust in a burner flame having an intensive internal recirculation zone. The petroleum coke dust is supplied to that region of the intensive recirculation zone which provided the ignition energy for the petroleum coke dust which is to be burned. However, this patent describes that, depending upon the type of processing which the crude oil has undergone, the petroleum coke can contain harfuml materials such as, vanadium which not only lead to corrosive compounds during combustion in steam generators, but furthermore considerably pollute the environment when they leave the "steam generator" with the flue gas. Suggest that, when this burner is used, these negatives effects or harfuml occurrences can be extensively avoided by adding vanadium-binding additives to the combustion via the incremental of air.<br><br><br>
Another development on coal burners is illustrated in the US patent No. 4924784 issued to Dennis R. Lennon et al, on May 15, 1990, which is related to the Firing of pulverized solvent refined coal in a burner for a "boiler or the like".<br>
Finally, the US patent No. 5829367 issued to Hideaki Ohta et al, on November 3, 1998, is related a burner for combustion of a pulverized coal mixture having two kinds of rich and lean concentration has a height of a burner panel of a burner panel reduced and the overall burner simplified. The burners applied for a boiler furnace or a chemical industrial furnace.<br>
As was been described in the above, the developments has been focused to control the pollution of the petroleum coke, however, these has been focused on the desulphurization or decontamination of the petroleum coke.<br>
On the other hand, notwithstanding that the petroleum coke has already been used in other industries, in some cases the same product absorbs the pollution gases, as well, the erosive and abrasive effects of vanadium on the furnaces (see cement industry).<br>
In each case, the pollution problems and their solution depend of each industry. Each industry and furnaces have different thermal properties and problems with contaminants, with the type of refractories -which also influence<br><br><br>

ENVIRONMENT CONTROL<br>
Finally, after of the combustion of the pulverized fuel in the glass melting furnace has been carried out, an equipment for reducing and controlling the air pollution and emissions of sulfur, nitrogen vanadium, iron and nickel compounds at the atmosphere is placed at the end of the tunnel 44 and connected with the chimney 46 for the exhaust gases. The pollution control system according to the present invention is adapted in a waste gas outlet of the glass melting furnace.<br>
For the control of contaminant emissions, electrostatic precipitators have proven to perform well in the abatement of glass furnace particulate matter. The fine particulate matter of glass furnaces presents no problem for electrostatic precipitators.<br>
In the case where S02 removal is needed in addition to particulate matter, a dry or partially wet scrubber makes a good complement to an electrostatic precipitators or a fabric filter system. In fact, under the conditions of high acid gas, a scrubber is necessary to reduce the concentration of the corrosive gases. In the case of the use of a new fuel, a scrubber will be needed to lower SO2 content. It will not only serves as a benefit to the system for corrosion prevention, but it will also lower the temperature of the exhaust and therefore reduce the gas volume.<br><br>
Dry scrubbing (the injection of a dry reactive powder) and semi-wet scrubbing will take place in a large reaction chamber upstream of the electrostatic precipitators. In both dry and wet, the scrubbing materials will include Na2C03, Ca(OH)2, NaHC03, or some others. The resultant reaction materials are basic ingredients to the glass making process and therefore are generally recyclable up to a point. A rule of thumb is that for every 1% of sulfur in the fuel, there will be about 4 pounds of S02 generated per ton of glass melted. So, for high sulfur fuels there will be an abundance of dry waste, NaS04 for example. This amount of waste will vary with the capture rate and the amount of material that can be recycled, but the number will be significant. For the float furnace operating with high sulfur fuel there might be up to 5 tons of waste per day. The performance levels of scrubbing vary from 50% to 90% using dry NaHC03 or semi-wet Na2C03. Temperature control is important in all scrubbing alternative with target reaction temperatures ranging from about 250Â°C to 400Â°C on the scrubbing material. Wet scrubbers come in an almost infinite number of shapes, sizes and applications. The two major applications, relating to glass making are those that are designed to collect gases (S02), and those that are designed to capture particulate matter.<br><br>
