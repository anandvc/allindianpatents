(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br><br><br>
ORAL CARE PRODUCT<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCTVEP2OO7/O63250<br><br>
- 1 -<br>
ORAL CARE PRODUCT<br>
The present invention relates to a polymeric material matrix comprising calcium silicate bioraaterial, the preparation of 5  such materials as well as the use of such a material to form a hydroxyapatite film on tooth surface for the remineralisation and whitening of the teeth.<br>
A tooth is comprised of an inner dentin layer and an outer 10  hard enamel layer that is the protective layer of the tooth.<br>
Due to today's lifestyles with increasing consumption of acidic drinks and Â£oodsr tooth erosion is becoming more prevalent and common, which is believed to be one of the<br>
15  biggest threats to teeth in the 21s" century.  Enamel is the hard, protective coating of the tooth, which protects the sensitive dentin underneath. Acidic drinks and foods, such as fruit and fruit juices, can make enamel softer and wear away by acid attack.  If without intervention or effective<br>
20  treatment, tooth erosion could further lead to tooth<br>
sensitivity with severe pain, when the surface enamel is worn off and the inner dentin tubules are exposed.<br>
Nowadays remineralisation is usually done by adding fluoride 25  ions according to the following reaction scheme<br><br>
The hydroxy ion is replaced by the fluoride ion. The resulting fluoride apatite composition is harder than the hydroxy apatite composition and more resistant to the acidic 30  attack. For that reason a majority of oral care products contain fluoride ions.  However, such ion replacement<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063250<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
through fluoride treatment cannot achieve a complete restoring of the lost minerals. It only aims to stop erosion from getting worse. So, this method is basically a preventive treatment and does not actively recover the 5  demineralised tooth to its original chemical and mechanical states.<br>
The enamel layer of the tooth is naturally an opaque white or slightly off-white colour; however, this enamel layer can<br>
10  become stained or discoloured.  The enamel layer of the tooth is composed of hydroxyapatite mineral crystals that create a somewhat porous surface.  It is believed that this porous  nature of the enamel layer allows staining agents and discolouring substances to permeate the enamel and discolour<br>
15  the tooth.<br>
Many substances can stain or reduce the whiteness of one's teeth; in particular, certain foods, tobacco products, and fluids such as tea and coffee.  These staining and 20  discolouring substances are often able to permeate the enamel layer.  This problem occurs gradually over many years, but imparts a noticeable discoloration of the enamel of one's teeth.<br>
25 A  variety of products are currently used for teeth<br>
whitening.  Such products often comprise a peroxide compound (alone or on combination with enzymes).  Such products may be used in the form of strips.  Such products generally have to be removed after a well defined time, the peroxide<br>
30  causing damage to the teeth and/or gums if left too long.  A particular problem with peroxide (and toothpastes comprising<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063250<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
abrasive cleaners) is that it can roughen the surface of the teeth.<br>
Certain prior art treatments are known to lead to the 5  production of hydroxyapatite on the tooth surface.<br>
US 5,605,675 (Enamelon, 1997) disclosed a process for remineralisation of dental enamel by application of a two-phase composition; one phase containing a water-soluble 10  calcium compound and one phase containing a water soluble inorganic phosphate and a water-soluble fluorine compound.<br>
US 4,083,955 (P&amp;G, 1978) discloses a process for remineralisation of dental enamel by sequential application 15  of two compositions, the first comprising calcium ions and second comprising phosphate ions, or vice  versa.<br>
WO 04/017929 (Septodont ou Specialites Sepodont S.A., 2004) discloses a preparation containing: an aqueous liquid part, 20  a solid part comprising at least  one plicate selected from tricalcium silicate and dicalcium silicate; calcium chloride and a water reducing agent, to be used t0 restore a mineralised substance, particularly in the dental field.<br>
25  An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
composition which re-mineralises the eroded teeth and which simultaneously whitens the teeth.  Thi5 object may be achieved without using bleaching chemicals, thereby avoiding the disadvantages as described above.<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063250<br><br>
-   4   -<br>
The present invention involves delivering mesoporous calcium silicate to the surface of the teeth and ultimately converting this material into hydroxyapatite in  situ  by reaction with phosphate ions present in the saliva and/or 5  added the teeth from a simultaneous or sequential applied source.<br>
The in  situ  generation of hydroxyapatite results in the remineralisation of the teeth, potentially reducing the<br>
10  likelihood of tooth decay and improving the appearance of the teeth, in particular their whiteness.  The teeth may also appear smoother and shinier as a result.  Since many "whitening" treatments result in a roughening of the tooth surface, the ability to whiten and yet reduce surface<br>
15  roughness is a particular benefit of the present invention.<br>
The benefits delivered by the present invention are principally targeting at the enamel; however, it is also expected that any exposed dentin may also be beneficially 20  affected.<br>
In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an oral care product comprising a mesoporous calcium silicate biomaterial dispersed in a polymeric 25  material matrix.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of delivering a mesoporous calcium silicate biomaterial to the teeth, said method comprising 30  the application of the mesoporous calcium silicate biomaterial in a polymeric material matrix.<br><br>

In a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a product according to the first aspect of the invention for use as a medicament.<br>
5  In a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is<br>
provided the use of mesoporous calcium silicate biomaterial and polymeric material matrix in the manufacture'of an oral care product for use to improve tooth whiteness, and/or reduce tooth decay, and/or reduce sensitivity.<br>

In the context of this invention, a MCSB is an insoluble composite material of calcium oxide-silica: CaO-SiC&gt;2.  The material is characterised by being in a mesoporous state, i.e. it is a material having pores with diameters from of<br>
15  0.4 to 50 microns.  The material may be in an amorphous state or in a crystalline state.<br>
The term "insoluble" should be understood to mean insoluble in water at temperatures in the oral cavity.  Typically, 20  "insoluble" materials have a solubility of less than 0.01 mol/L at 25Â°C.<br>
The term "composite" should be understood to mean a material comprising at least two different materials.  The calcium 25  oxide-silica composite biomaterials of the present invention comprise at least calcium oxide and silica.<br>
The term "biomaterial" should be understood to mean a material that is capable of bonding to human and/or animal 30  tissue, including living tissue (such as  bone tissue and<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063250<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
tooth dentin) and non-living tissue (such as tooth enamel) and also including both soft and hard tissue.<br>
The term "pore size" should be understood to mean the pore 5  diameter.  The pore size may be measured using any suitable method or  means known to a person  skilled in the art.     For example, the pore size may be measured using BET nitrogen sorption or mercury porosimetry techniques (particularly BET nitrogen sorption techniques).<br>
10<br>
It is has been found that MCSB enables efficient calcium delivery to the teeth, at least partially overcoming problems associated with premature interaction with phosphate in the saliva of the oral cavity.<br>
15<br>
It is believed that the MCSB reacts with phosphate ions to form a calcium silicate-phosphate cement (CSPC) and that this material bonds strongly to the teeth and then gradually transforms into hydroxyapatite on the tooth surface.  It is<br>
20  believed that the high affinity of the CSPC for the tooth surface underlies the superior remineralisation and whitening benefits obtained.<br>
As shown in this description, mesoporous calcium silicate 25  (MC3) delivers calcium with much greater efficiency than<br>
non-mesoporous calcium silicate and MCS fuels the growth of hydroxyapatite with much greater efficiency than non-mesoporous calcium silicate.<br>
30  The MCSB is a silica-based material.  In other words, the biomaterial comprises a primary structure of silica, i.e.<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063250<br><br>

interconnected silicon and oxygen atoms.  The particular<br><br>
and oxygen atoms may be any suitable structure and will depend on several factors, including the nature of a 5  structure-directing agent used to prepare the composite biomaterial.  For example, when the structure-directing agent is CTAB typically a hexagonal porous structure is formed and when the structure-directing agent is F127Â® typically a cubic porous structure is formed.  Calcium atoms 10  are covalentiy bonded to the oxygen atoms in the silicon-oxygen network, so as to form a coherent and continuous mix of silicon, oxY9en and calcium atoms.  The composite material typically has a spherical shape once formed.<br>
15  Typically, the pores of the MCSB have an ordered<br>
arrangement.  The ordering of the pores can, for example, be detected by small angle X-ray diffraction, for example at angles of frof" 1Â° to 8Â° (compared to angles of 10Â° to 80Â° used for a normal crystal).  Small angle X-ray diffraction<br><br>
crystal lattice.  As the skilled person would appreciate, if the pores do not have an ordered arrangement, no peaks are observed in tfre small angle X-ray diffraction pattern.  If, however, the pores have an ordered arrangement, a sharp peak 25  is observed iP the X-ray diffraction pattern.<br>
The MCSB has a ratio of calcium to silicon (Ca:Si) that may be from 1:10 to 3:1.  The Ca:Si ratio is preferably from 1:5 to 2:1, more preferably from 1:3 to 1:1, and most preferably 30  it is about 1:2.  The MCSB may comprise mono-calcium<br>
silicate, bi-calcium silicate, or tri-calcium silicate.<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063250<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
Higher ratios of calcium to silicate are preferred because such ratios are believed to enhance active bonding to the tooth surface and subsequent transformation into hydroxyapatite; however, lower ratios are preferred for ease 5  of obtaining the desired pH {vide Infra).<br>
Throughout this specification, ratios of calcium to silicon (Ca:Si) should be understood to be atom ratios.<br>
10  In one aspect of the invention, there is present a MCSB having an average pore size (diameter) of preferably from 0.4 to 4 nm, more preferably from 0.4 to 3.5 nm, and most preferably from 0.4 to 3 nm.<br>
15  In another aspect of the invention, there is a present a MCSB having an average pore size (diameter) of preferably from 2 to 4 nm, more preferably from 2 to 3.5 nm, and most preferably from 2 to 3 nm.<br>
20  In a further aspect of the invention, there is present a MCSB having an  average pore size (diameter) of  preferably from 1 to 2.7 nm and more preferably from 1.35 to 2.45 nm.<br>
The pore size may be measured using any suitable method or 25  means.  For example, the pore size may be measured using BET nitrogen sorption or mercury porosimetry techniques (particularly BET nitrogen sorption techniques).<br>
The content of the MCSB is typically from 0.05 to 25%, 30  particularly from 0.5 to 15%, and especially from 2.5 to 10% by weight of the all the composition components of the<br><br>

desired pH and are particularly desirably at higher Ca:Si ratios, for example 1:1 and greater and especially 2:1 and greater.<br>
5  The following method of production can be used for obtaining a preferred MCSB.  This method is further described in our co-pending application PCT/EP2007/057556.<br>
10<br>
A method for preparing a calcium oxide-silica composite biomaterial having an average pore size in the range of from 0.4 to 4 nm, comprises the steps of:<br>
15<br>
(i) combining, in solution, a calcium salt, a tetra(alkyl)silicate and a structure-directing agent in the presence of an aqueous solvent whereby hydrolysis of the tetra(alkyl)silicate occurs, leading to the formation of a sol; (ii) isolating a solid from the sol; and (iii) calcinating the isolated solid.<br>
20  In step (i) of the above method, the tetra(alkyl)silicate is hydrolysed to form silica.  It is not necessary for all of the tetra (alkyl)silicate to be hydrolysed.  Typically at least 80% by weight of the tetra(alkyl)silicate is hydrolysed in step (i).<br>
25<br>
/Any suitable tetra (alkyl) silicate may be used in step (i) of the above method.  Suitable tetra(alkyl)silicates include tetraethyl orthosilicate [TEOS] (preferred) and tetramethyl orthosilicate.  It is less preferred to use tetramethyl<br>
30  orthosilicate because tetramethyl orthosilicate produces<br><br>

-   11   -<br>
methanol which potentially may disrupt the formation of the ordered structure in the sol, as well as being toxic.<br>
Any suitable concentration of tetra(alkyl)silicate may be 5  used in step (i) of the above method.  Suitable<br>
concentrations include 0.1 to 1M, particularly 0.3 to 0.6M.<br>
Any suitable calcium salt may be used in step (i) of the above method.  Suitable calcium salts include those that are 10  substantially soluble in an aqueous solution with a pH<br>
between 8 and 10.  Suitable calcium salts include calcium nitrate, calcium fluoride and calcium chloride.  In one aspect, the calcium salt is calcium nitrate.<br>
15  Any suitable structure-directing agent may be used in step (i) of the above method.  The structure-directing agent may be a cationic or a nonionic surfactant and should be organic in nature.  When the structure-directing agent is such a surfactant, the MCSB produced typically has an average pore<br>
20  size in the range of from about 1.7 to 2.7 nm.<br>
A particularly suitable cationic surfactant is cetyltrimethylammonium bromide [CTAB].  When the structure-directing agent is CTAB, the MCSB produced has an average 25  pore size of about 2.7 nm.<br>
A suitable nonionic surfactant is dodecylamine.  When dodecylamine is used, the MCSB produced has an average pore size of about 2.4 nm.<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063250<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
A further suitable nonionic surfactant is Pluronic F88Â® (ex BASF, for example), which is a nonionic block copolymer of the formula wherein EO represents ethylene<br>
oxide and PO represents propylene oxide.  When the 5  structure-directing agent is Pluronic F88Â®, the MCSB produced has an average pore size of ai&gt;out 3.5 nm.<br>
A further suitable structure-directing agent is Tetronic 908 (ex BASF, for example), which is a nonionic star<br><br>
(  When the structure-directing<br>
agent is Tetronic 908 , the MCSB produced has an average pore size of about 3.0 nm.<br>
15  A particularly preferred MCSB for use in accordance with the present invention is prepared according to the above method using, as structure-directing agent CTAB, Pluronic F88Â®, Tetronic 908 or dodecylamine.  Especially preferred is CTA.B.<br>

The polymeric material matrix can be a gel, a hydrogel as well as an entangled polymeric solution.<br>
By the term "gel" we mean a colloidal System in which a 25  porous network of interconnected nanoparticles spans the<br>
volume of a liquid medium.  In general, gels are apparently solid, jelly-like materials.  Both by Weight and volume, gels are mostly liquid in composition and thus exhibit<br><br>

densities similar to liquids, however have the structural coherence of a solid.<br>
By the term "hydrogel", we mean a mainly crosslinked 5  polymeric material, which absorbed water and which holds water.  Instead of pure water it is also possible that the hydrogel absorbed an aqueous solution additionally comprising one or more other solvent which water-miscible (such as liquid alcohols, preferably ethanol) and/or<br>
10  comprising water soluble compounds.  Usually if a hydrogel does not only comprise water, the content of the other solvent and/or compound is not more than 10 wt%.  That means that the water content is usually 90-100 wt% and the content of the additional solvent (s) and/or compound(s) is 0-10 wt%.<br>
15<br>
By the term "entangled polymeric solution", we mean a non-crosslinked or slightly crosslinked polymeric material, which does not hold water.<br>
20  The polymeric matrix according to present invention usually comprises water.  The water content of the polymeric material matrix can vary depending on the kind of composition which has to be provided.  It is possible to prepare a polymeric material matrix with a high<br>
25  concentration of the calcium silicate biomaterial and therefore a lower concentration of water as well as to prepare a polymeric material matrix with a low amount of the calcium silicate biomaterial and therefore a higher concentration of water.  The water content can go up to 99<br>
30  wt%.  Preferably the water content is between 75 and 99 wt%, more preferably between 80 and 99 wt%, based on the total<br><br>

between 1 and 25% (preferably between 1 and 20%), based on the total weight of the polymeric material matrix, of at least one polymeric material, and 0.1 to 95% of at least one MCSB.<br>
For the concentration of the polymeric material matrix as well as the calcium silicate based biomaterial it must be stated that there are in principle two possible kinds of compositions:<br>
10<br>
(a)	Ready  to  use  compositions<br>
A ready to use composition, is a composition which can be used directly for the whitening and remineralisation of the teeth without diluting it.  In such a<br>
15       composition the content of the calcium silicate based biomaterial is usually not higher than 10%.  Usually the content is between 0.1 and 10%, preferably between 1 and 10%, more preferably between 1 and 8%.  As consequence thereof, the polymeric material matrix<br>
20       content is usually at least 90%.  Usually the content<br>
is between 90 and 99.9%, preferably between 90 and 99%, more preferably between 92 and 98%.<br>
(b)	Concentrated compositions<br>
25       A concentrated composition is a composition which needs to be diluted before it can be used for putting on the teeth.  In such a concentrated composition the content of the calcium silicate based biomaterial can be as high as 95% and may range from 10%.<br>

Hence, in accordance with a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a concentrated composition comprising 5 to 90% of a polymeric material matrix, which comprises between 75 and 99% (preferably between 80 and 99%), based on the 5  total weight of the polymeric material matrix, of water and between 1 and 25% (preferably between 1 and 20%), based on the total weight of the polymeric material matrix, of at least one polymeric material, and 10 to 95%  of at least one MCSB.<br>
10<br>
The compositions according to the invention are produced usually in the way that the MCSB is added to the water and in a second step the polymeric material (gel forming material, hydrogel forming compounds ox entangled polymeric<br>
15  material) is added.<br>
Following application of a product according to the invention, the composition may be left on the teeth for from about 1 minute to 24 hours, although a preferred period is 20  30 minutes to 8 hour).  The process can carried out on a daily basis.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, oral care products according to the invention comprise an independent source of<br>
25  phosphate ions, i.e. a source of phosphate ions independent of the MCSB dispersed in a polymeric material matrix. Preferably, the source is a water soluble salt, typically having a solubility of 1% by weight or greater in water at 25Â°C.  Suitable water soluble salts include tri-sodium<br>
30  phosphate, di-sodium hydrogenphosphate, and sodium dihydrogenphosphate.<br><br>

PCTYEP2007/063250<br><br>
-   19   -<br>
The MCSB dispersed in a polymeric material matrix and the source of the phosphate ions are typically kept physically separate from one another by having them in independent 5  compositions.  The delivery of these independent<br>
compositions to the teeth may be sequential or simultaneous. In certain embodiments, for example dual phase toothpastes, the compositions are preferably delivered simultaneously.<br>
10  Vifhen employed, the source of phosphate ions is preferably present in a composition at a concentration of from 1 mM to 1000 mM, more preferably 5 mM to 100 mM, and most preferably 10 mM to 50 mM.<br>
15  In certain embodiments, the means of delivery may involve a tape, in particular an adhesive tape, onto which the source of calcium ions and the source of phosphate ions are applied, prior to the strip being placed in contact with the teeth.   Using this means of delivery, the compositions can<br>
20  be held in close contact with tooth surface, facilitating a high concentration of calcium salt and/or source of phosphate ions close to the tooth surface.  Much less of the composition(s) is/are lost into the saliva using this delivery means.<br>

Examples 15<br>
Step I - Preparation of gel compositions comprising MCS<br>
Homogeneous suspensions of fine powder MCS (Ca:Si = 1:2) in distilled water were formed in a range of concentrations from approximately 0.5% to 5%, as indicated in Table 1, 20  using ultra-sonification.  Sodium alginate gel particles<br>
were then added with vigorous stirring.  After about 5 to 15 minutes, uniform white gel suspensions resulted.  The pH of the gel suspensions were measured and are also indicated in Table 1.<br><br>

Sodium alginate (g)	5	5	5	5<br>
PH	9.32	9.72	9.76	10.03<br>
Further compositions were prepared as described above with 5  the sodium alginate present at lg, 1.5g, and 3g.  The<br>
viscosity of the resulting composition was found to be a function of the alginate level, being higher at the higher alginate levels.<br>
10  Step II - Application of the gel compositions comprising MCS<br>
Extracted human teeth were cleaned using 75% alcohol and brushed using toothpaste to remove surface bacteria and debris.  The composition designated 4 in Table 1 was<br>
15  uniformly painted onto the teeth at a level of 1.0 g per six teeth.  The teeth were then immersed in human saliva at 37Â°C.  After eight hours, the gel was washed off with tap water and the teeth re-immersed again in the saliva at 37Â°C for the rest of day.  This treatment was continued for two<br>
20  weeks.<br>
The human saliva used was collected from many subjects.  Its calcium concentration varied from 23 to 60 ppm and its<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063250<br><br>
-   26   -<br>
phosphorus concentration (present as phosphate ions) varied from 124 to 154 ppm.<br>
The surface morphology of the teeth was investigated using 5  SEM before and after treatment.  Figure 1(a) represents the appearance before treatment and Figure 1(b) represents the appearance after treatment.  It can be seen that before treatment the surface is smooth and after treatment certain new crystalline structures have grown out from the original 10  smooth surface.  At a magnification of 10,000, tiny<br>
crystalline structures can be clearly seen, measuring about 100 nm.<br>
To quantify the amount of newly formed hydroxyapatite, the 15  before and after treatment tooth samples were sectioned and polished before being examined by SEM.  The result is shown in Figure 2.  It can be clearly seen that a thin coating layer has been formed on the top of original enamel.  The thickness of the layer varies from 2 to 10 microns, but 20  seems to have a positive relation with the tooth surface<br>
roughness.  Thus, it would appear that the treatment targets those teeth in most need of repair.<br>
The chemical nature of the new crystalline material produced 25  by the treatment was investigated by EDX elemental analysis (see Figure 3) and Raman spectroscopy (see Figure 4). Figure 3 shows that the content of calcium and phosphorus in the newly formed hydroxyapatite is very similar to that in the original tooth enamel underneath.  Figure 4 indicates 30  that the chemical nature of the phosphate present in newly formed hydroxyapatite is essentially the same as that of the<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCT7EP2007/063250<br><br>
-   27   -<br>
untreated teeth, strongly suggesting that only ""natural" hydroxyapatite has been added to the teeth.<br>
Hardness testing using nano-indentation 5<br>
In this experiment, the mechanical properties of the regenerated enamel layer were investigated. Mechanical robustness is of crucial importance to the long term stability of the enamel and is essential for maintenance of 10  teeth during biting and eating food.  It is desired that the enamel has a high level of mechanical hardness.<br>
Using the same procedures as described in "Step II" (vide supra), human tooth samples were first cleaned and then<br>
15  treated with Composition 5 and saliva on a daily basis for two weeks.  On this occasion, however, an additional step was introduced: following the eight hour immersion of painted teeth in saliva, the teeth were brushed for one minute with a chalk-containing toothpaste.  They were then<br>
20  re-immersed in saliva as in the "Step II" procedure described above.<br>
State of the art nano-indentation instrumentation was used to measure the hardness of the thin film of newly deposited<br>
25  film of hydroxyapatite on the surface of the teeth.  Three treated tooth samples were measured and on each sample, nine indentations were made.  As shown in Table 3, the hardness of the remineralised layer is in the range of 5.4 and 5.7 GPa.  This is very close to the hardness of the original<br>
30  enamel surface, also shown in Table 3.   Another important mechanical parameter is Young's modulus, a basic value for a<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/063250<br><br>
-   28   -<br>
material's elasticity.  The higher the value, the stiffer the material is.  It is desirable that the remineralisation layer is similar to the natural enamel.  From the results indicated in Table 2, it is clear that the remineralised 5  film has similar mechanical properties that that of the original enamel.<br>

After forming new enamel layer	5.4 -5.7	111-121<br>
Regeneration of damaged teeth<br>
To mimic the demineralization of teeth by many  types of 15  acidic fruit juice, human teeth were etched using 37 wt% phosphoric acid for one minute.  Images of the original teeth and the phosphoric acid etched teeth were taken by SEM.  Fig. 5a represents a tooth surface before etching and Fig. 5b represents a tooth surface after etching.  By 20  treatment with Composition 5 (described below) in the manner described above, it was found possible to cure the etching caused by the phosphoric acid within one week.<br>
Composition 5:  MCS powder (0.5 g) added to water flO g) and 25  dispersed as described above, then sodium alginate (0.3 g)<br><br>

added with vigorous stirring.  A uniform gel was formed after about ten minutes stirring.<br>
The treated samples were found to have grown a significant 5  thickness of a new layer.  The newly formed layer was<br>
characterized by Raman spectroscopy.  Fig. 6a is the Raman spectrum of a tooth surface before treatment and Figure 6b is the Raman spectrum of a tooth surface after treatment. Table 3 indicates the position of the major peaks before and<br>
10  after treatment.  There is a peak at 961.42 cm"1 which corresponds to the major phosphate band.  The after treatment sample gave an essentially identical Raman spectrum to the before treatment sample, including the location of the phosphate band at 961.42 cm"1.  This implies<br>
15  that the added material is identical to that originally present and is a somewhat surprising result.<br><br>
The Raman bands Vi, v2, v3, and v4  are characteristic of the crystallinity/perfeetion of the apatite crystal lattice.<br>

- 30 -Example 6: dual phase gel product<br>
A product was prepared comprising two gel compositions: Gel I and Gel II.  Details are given in Table 4.  An MSC powder 5  as described above under "step I" was incorporated into Gel I by the method disclosed under "step I".  Gel II was prepared by adding sodium alginate to a solution of phosphate buffer and sodium fluoride.<br>

The product was applied by mixing equal weights of Gel I and Gel II and painting the mixture (total weight 2g) onto six<br>
15  teeth using a cotton bud.  The treated teeth were immersed in human saliva (15 ml) for one hour, at 37Â°C, with gentle agitation.  After this time, the teeth were rinsed and cleaned using a cotton bud to remove any remaining gel. They were then placed into fresh saliva for a further two<br>
20  hours.  This process was performed twice a day for two weeks, giving a total of 28 treatments.<br>
In a further experiment. Example 6 as described above (i.e. a 1:1 by weight mixture of Gel I and Gel II) was applied to<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>

an adhesive plastic tape.  Then the tape was then wrapped around each tooth and the wrapped teeth immersed in saliva for eight hours.  The dosage applied was 2g of the mixture of Gel I and Gel II per 6 teeth.  After this time, the teeth 5  were rinsed with water and then put into fresh saliva.  This procedure was repeated for two weeks, including a tooth brushing each day to simulate real life usage.<br>
The effects of the above treatments with Example 6, with 10  respect to tooth whitening, were investigated together with a "control" treatment involving tooth brushing (once a day) and treatment with saliva only.<br>
The whitening effect was measured using a Minolta 15  Chromameter CR-321 (3mm aperture, 45/0) to quantitatively measure the L* and b* value of each tooth before and after treatment.  L* represents the overall light intensity that is reflected from the tested surface and b* represents the light contribution from the yellow-blue.  Tooth whitening is 20  indicated by an increase in reflected light intensity (L*) and a decrease in "yellowness" (b*).  The results are shown in Table 5.  Average colour changes after two weeks treatment are expressed as AL* and Ab*.  Good whitening effects were observed with both treatments according to the 25  invention.<br><br>

These Examples were used to treat polished tooth enamel blocks.  The treatment involved brushing with a slurry of the dual phase toothpaste in water (1 part toothpaste to 2 parts water) for 3 minutes, followed by incubation of the<br>
20  blocks in saliva for 2 hours at 37Â°C.  This procedure was performed twice a day over a four week period.  A conventional *whitening" toothpaste was used as a control, as was water.<br>
25  The colour of the tooth enamel blocks was monitored using a Chromameter, as described above.  The final results are indicated in Table 7, AL* and AW* representing the changes in "lightness" and "whiteness" between before and after treatment.  "W" is a "whiteness measure" calculated as:<br>

These results indicate that Example 7 gives superior "lightening" and ^whitening" in comparison with the controls.<br>

The effect of the treatments on the hardness of the polished tooth enamel blocks was also investigated.  This was done by measuring Knoop hardness using a HM-122 hardness testing machine (from Mitutoyo, Japan).  10 samples were measured 20  for each treatment and 5 indentations made for each sample. The results shown in Table 9 illustrate that Examples 8 and<br><br>

The effect of the treatments on the roughness of the polished tooth enamel blocks was also investigated.  This 10  was done using a surface profilometer (SV2000 from Mitutoyo, Japan).  10 samples were measured for each treatment.  The results shown in Table 10 illustrate that Examples 8 and 9 led to a significant decrease in enamel roughness, i.e., a significant increase in smoothness and shine.<br><br>

- 38 -Examples 11-13: products with insoluble whitening particles<br>
The gel compositions shown in Table 13 were prepared as previously described with added insoluble whitening 5  particles as indicated.  These compositions were used treat hydroxyapatite discs (n = 6-8) for 30 minutes per day over a 4 week period.  Following the 30 minute treatment, on each day, the discs were treated with a source of phosphate ions (simulated oral fluid).  The colour of the hydroxyapatite 10  discs was monitored using a Chromameter, as described above. The final results are indicated at the bottom of Table 13.<br>

Example 15: Calcium Ion Release<br>
10<br>
Mesoporous calcium silicate (0.04 g) was dispersed in water (40 ml) using ultrasound for 5 minutes.  A dispersion of non-mesoporous calcium silicate (non-MCS) of the same concentration was also prepared.  Both the MCS and non-MCS<br>
15  had the same Ca:Si ratio (1:1).<br><br>
WO 2008/068247<br><br>
PCTYEP2007/063250<br><br>
-   40   -<br>
Samples of the dispersions described above  were diluted 10 times with water and the calcium concentrations measured using atomic absorption after 5 minutes and after 20 hours. The results are shown in Table 15.  It is clear that the MCS 5  releases significantly more calcium ions that the non-MCS.<br>

In a further experiment, M5C and non-MSC were independently incubated in phosphate buffered saline (25 mM) for 24 hours at 37Â°C.  Figure 7 is an SEM showing extensive 15  hydroxyapatite growth on the MSC sample.  Figure 8 is an SEM showing no significant growth of hydroxyapatite on the non-MCS sample.<br><br>
