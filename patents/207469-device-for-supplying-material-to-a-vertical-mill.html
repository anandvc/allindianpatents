DEVICE FOR SUPPLYING MATERIAL<br>
The invention relates to a device for supplying material to a vertical mill according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
The invention is particularly suitable for loading or filling containers and devices with material, the material being stored, processed or worked therein under an overpressure or underpressure.<br>
A preferred field of application are milling plants, where raw material is supplied to vertical mills with air flow conveying, e.g. air-swept roller mills, with the aid of conveying devices and a feed device for milling purposes.<br>
For charging a vertical mill with raw material to be crushed, e.g. predried raw lignite or cement clinker and fluxes, it is known to use a two or three-flap lock or a bucket wheel lock, which ensures the necessary sealing of an air-swept mill operated under an overpressure or underpressure.<br>
However, the disadvantage is that these material locks involve high costs, which considerably increase the overall costs of a milling plant. This is in particular due to the overall height of the flap and bucket wheel locks and the arrangement thereof roughly level with a classifier cover caused by the material being discharged vertically. Besides the costs resulting from the building height, costs are also involved for the mechanical and electrotechnical equipment -and for assembly and this has a negative effect on the total costs of a milling plant.<br>
Fig. 1 shows in a partial view a milling plant 2 in the vicinity of an air-swept roller mill as a vertical mill 6 with air flow conveying. A bucket wheel lock 45 is used as the feed mechanism.<br><br>
2<br>
for the milling material to be crushed and which is supplied from a silo or hopper 37 to a conveyor 43. The bucket wheel lock 45 is positioned above a classifier cover 46 of the vertical mill 6. The not shown milling material passes via a feed chute 47 into the milling area 12 of the vertical mill 6. Fig. 1 illustrates the considerable building height, the necessary structural plant parts and the length of the conveyor 43, which raise the total cost of the milling plant.<br>
Austrian patent 400 684 discloses a device for supplying raw coal to a mill which is under pressure. In order to limit to a minimum the parts which have to be designed in pressure shock-resistant manner, following a silo the supply device has a first conveying line, followed by a feed bunker, a second conveying line, an intermediate bunker and a third conveying line. The third conveying line is in the form of a trough chain conveyor, which serves as a proportioning member and is fully located in a pressure shock-resistant casing. By means of the supply shaft issuing centrally into the classifier cover of the mill, the raw coal passes from the third conveying line into the mill. As a result of the superimposed bunkers and the horizontally positioned, three conveying lines, the overall supply device has a relatively large overall height and requires corresponding capital, assembly and energy costs.<br>
DE 88 05 885 U1 discloses a mill for crushing moist milling material with a feed chute for supplying said material. A conveyor belt projects into the sloping feed chute, which extends into an introduction opening in the mill casing cover. In order to protect the conveyor belt parts located in the feed chute against the rising hot gases from the mill in the case of a power failure, a stack is provided which is connected to the feed chute. At the connection point of the stack in the feed chute is provided a shutoff valve as a movable part of a gas deflector, which in normal operation shuts off the stack, whereas in the case of a power failure it opens the stack and shuts off the feed chute. The additional components located in the cover-side supply device increase the overall height, as well as the<br>

capital expenditure and control technology expenditure of the milling plant.<br>
An elevator conveyor for bulk materials with two continuous conveyor belts, which engage on one another on their longitudinal edges and whereof at least one passes in a vertical area within an air box is known from DE 27 26 038 C2. Pretensioning means and sealing strips fixed to the air box are provided for the necessary marginal sealing of the conveyor belts.<br>
A double band or strap belt conveyor is known from DE 34 32 553 A1. In order to be able to convey stickly, slurry-like and highly free-flowing bulk materials reliably and without any demixing risk, the cover belt strap has longitudinal and transverse reinforcements between which are formed indentations for receiving the material to be conveyed. The identations or conveying spaces are sealed to the other side by the second, flat strap of the conveyor belt. Through longitudinal guides comprise U-shaped steel section portions and ensure the necessary seals for the ocvneying spaces.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a device for supplying material to a container, particularly raw material to be crushed in a vertical mill, which has a particularly simple and cost-saving construction and an optimized material feed as well as a smaller overall height of the plant and reduced control technology expenditure and an efficient milling and classifying process.<br>
It is fundamental idea of the invention to use as a feed device constructed for receiving an end region of a conveyor for the material to be supplied to a container and incorporated with the end region of the conveyor received in the pressure system....<br><br>
4<br>
of the container, e.g. a vertical mill with air flow conveying, a sandwich lock with a gas-tight and/or pressure-tight casing and as a conveyor to use a double strap conveyor with a double strap belt and to position the sandwich lock for a lateral supply and feeding of the material in the vicinity of a feed opening of the container or the casing of the vertical mill.<br>
According to the invention, the sandwich lock casing has a passage opening for the double strap belt and a lower and an upper slot opening for the lower and upper strap belts to be returned and which for maintaining the pressure level in the sandwich lock and in the container or vertical mill are provided with seals.<br>
Particularly for milling plants and the raw material charging of an air-swept roller mill, it is advantageous if the conveyor for the raw material is constituted by a double band or strap conveyor, which is terminally connected with a correspondingly constructed lock as the feed device. The supply device according to the invention makes unnecessary material locks, such as two or three-flap locks or bucket wheel locks, so that there are considerable cost savings in connection with construction, mechanical equipment and the associated electrical equipment.<br>
A lock integratable into a double strap conveyor can be constructed as a sandwich lock which, compared with the known material locks, has an extremely simple construction and a relatively low overall height. This also reduces the manufacturing and assembly costs. It is particularly advantageous that the device allows a lateral supply and charging of the material and economizes approximately 7 to 8 m building height. Further advantages are associated with the in particular air-tight, continuous material conveying and feeding with the aid of the double strap belt conveyor, in which conveying can take place horizontally, vertically and/or in sloping manner with any random inclination angle. Whereas in the case of the known material locks there is generally a discontinuous material entry, with the conveyor-feed unit according to the invention it is possible<br>
Amended page<br><br>
5<br>
to implement a continuous material flow entry. This provides optimization possibilities for a plant and in particular a milling and classifying process in a milling plant, which brings about a reduction in energy consumption and leads to significant ecological advantages.<br>
According to the invention it is appropriate to construct the sandwich lock with a gas-tight and/or pressure-tight casing, which is rearwardly adjacent to a container wall or mill casing and connected by means of a feed opening to the milling and/or classifying area of the mill. As a result of the fact that the material to be supplied is conveyed in a double strap belt and enclosed in sandwich-like manner between a lower and an upper strap belt, the advantageous possibility exists of an air-tight termination or sealing of the double strap belt, so that from the material side a secondary or infiltrated air entry can largely be excluded.<br>
It is appropriate to seal and in particular seal several times upstream of the sandwich lock, the double strap belt with the material enclosed therein. As sealing means are suitable rolling seals, sliding seals and bristle seals. It is appropriate for a sealed material supply and a smooth material entry into the vertical mill without secondary air entry or exit to provide the double strap belt formed by a lower and an upper strap belt marginally with sealable, material-free overlap areas, which are appropriately almost planar.<br>
The end region of the double strap conveyor extending into the sandwich lock has deflection drums for the lower and the upper strap belt. The deflection drums are appropriately constructed in complementary manner to the strap belts and are arranged in displaced manner in the sandwich lock in such a way that the upper strap belt is positioned upstream of the lower deflection drum for releasing the material to the conveyor. The lower deflection drum serves as an ejection or release device for the material and is so positioned with respect to the feed opening<br>
Amended page<br><br>
6<br>
in the container or vertical mill that the material passes into the feed opening and the container or vertical mill.<br>
If the strap belts are profiled in trough-shaped manner between the marginal, substantially planar overlap areas and rest on one another homologously with their overlap areas, a crosssectionally biconvex reception space for the material to be conveyed is formed and can be sealed in a particularly simple manner.<br>
Since as a result of the feed opening in the container or in the vertical mill, the same pressure prevails in the sandwich lock casing as in the vertical mill, seals according to the invention are formed in the vicinity of the passage opening for the double strap belt with enclosed material and a lower and an upper slotlike opening for the lower or upper, deflected and returned strap belt.<br>
Appropriately there are labyrinth packings for the returning, upper strap belt and for the returning, lower strap belt. The passage opening positioned between the slot openings is advantageously constructed in vertically adjustable manner at least in an upper sealing area for adaptation to a differently arched, upper strap belt. It is e.g. possible to provide sealing laminas, which can be pressed resiliently or in sliding manner on the upper strap belt of the double strap belt. The lower strap belt is appropriately relatively stable and provided with a constant trough for receiving the material. In order to maintain the trough-shaped construction even in the deflected, returned, lower strap belt, it is appropriately to correspondingly position backing rolls. The seal can be constituted by a labyrinth packing.<br>
The passage opening and the lower and upper slot openings can be constructed independently of the seals used in complementary manner to the cross-section of the double strap belt, as well as the deflected, lower and upper strap belt. It is particularly advantageous that through the use of a double strap belt and a<br>
Amended page<br><br>
7<br>
sandwich lock in the vicinity of a feed opening, the raw material can be supplied in free-falling manner or forcibly guided to the container or milling area. The raw material can directly reach the centre of the mill through an adjustable speed of the double strap belt as a function of the spacing of the lower deflection drum from the feed opening.<br>
The essential advantages of the device according to the invention are low structural and machine costs for the material supply as a result of the arrangement of the sandwich lock above the milling or grinding rollers in a lateral area of the mill casing or in the connection area between the mill and classifier casing. The manufacturing and assembly costs for the sandwich lock and double strap conveyor are relatively low. Another advantage is that with the double strap conveyor, which can be positioned horizontally, vertically and with any random inclination angle, a continuous material feed is ensured. This leads to a lower energy consumption for the device and to an optimized milling and classifying process.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter relative to highly diagrammatic drawings, wherein show:<br>
Fig. 1 A partial view of a grinding plant with a supply device for the raw material according to the prior art.<br>

Fig. 4 A highly diagrammatic representation of a double strap belt with enclosed material, as well as a deflected, lower and upper strap belt.<br>
The partial view of a milling plant 2 shown in fig. 2 has in the same way as the prior art-illustrating fig. 1, an air-swept roller mill as the vertical mill 6 with air flow conveying and silos 37, in which is stored the material to be crushed in the vertical mill 6. The supply device according to the invention has as the conveyor a double strap conveyor 3 and as the feed device for the not shown material supplied by the double strap conveyor 3, a lock adapted to the latter and which is referred to hereinafter as a sandwich lock 5.<br>
Said sandwich lock 5 is fixed in gas-tight and/or pressure-tight manner in the vicinity of a feed opening 11 (cf. fig. 3) to the casing 10 of the vertical mill 6.<br>
A comparison of the prior art milling plant in fig. 1 and the milling plant according to fig. 2 with a material supply according to the invention, which has a sandwich lock 5 and a double strap conveyor 3 cooperating therewith shows that there is a much lower building height in the case of the milling plant 2 of fig. 2.<br>
In this embodiment the double strap conveyor 3 is provided in the vicinity of the silos 37 with a lower, horizontal conveying area 30 to which is connected a vertical conveying area 31, which extends over an upper, horizontal conveying area 32 into the sandwich lock 5. Considerable cost savings arise due to the reduced overall height and the reduced plant and structural component costs. Fundamentally the orientation of the double strap conveyor 3 can be in accordance with the given circumstances and requirements of the plant and can e.g. be positioned over the entire conveying path vertically and/or horizontally and/or inclined with any random inclination angle.<br><br>
9<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate the construction and arrangement of a sandwich lock 5 on a vertical mill 6 with air flow conveying, only the area of the casing 10 of vertical mill 6 being shown. The sandwich lock 5 is constructed in box-like manner and has a casing 8 with a front side 28, which is provided with a passage opening 23 for the double strap belt 13 with the material 4 enclosed therein and which is in particular terminated in airtight manner (cf. fig. 4). An end region 7 of the double strap conveyor 3 is located within the casing 5 and is consequently incorporated into the pressure system of the sandwich lock 5 and the vertical mill 6 by means of the feed opening 11. In order to avoid secondary air entry or exit, the double strap belt 13 with the material received therein and the sandwich lock 5 are sealed, the sandwich lock 5 being shown in fig. 3 without a front side wall in order to illustrate the construction of the end region 7 and the deflection of the double strap belt 13.<br>
The double strap belt 13 has a lower strap belt 14 and an upper strap belt 15. For the construction of a reception area 20 for the material 4 (fig. 4), the lower belt 14 and the upper belt 15 are constructed in trough-shaped manner and in the vicinity of the marginal, material-free overlap areas 19, are superimposed in mirror symmetrical manner, so that a cross-sectionally biconvex reception space 20 is formed (cf. also fig. 4). Through suitable sealing devices, which are appropriately positioned upstream of the sandwich lock 5 and which are not shown, the double strap belt 13 is preferably sealed several times, so that on the material side a secondary air introduction into the sandwich lock 5 and vertical mill 6 can be largely excluded.<br>
The end region 7 of the double strap conveyor 3 received within the sandwich lock 5 has a lower deflection drum 17, which is positioned relatively close to the feed opening 11. An upper deflection drum 18 for the upper strap belt 15 is positioned in displaced manner, so that the not shown material resting on the lower, further extending strap belt 14 reaches an ejection point formed by the deflection drum 17 and, as a function of the speed of the double strap belt 13 and the spacing from the feed open-<br><br>
10<br>
ing 11, can be ejected virtually centrally into the vertical mill 6.<br>
The deflection drums 17, 18 are constructed in complementary manner to the trough-shaped strap belts 14, 15 resting on one another in mirror symmetrical manner. Corresponding to the virtually planar, material-free overlap areas 19, the deflection drums 17, 18 are provided with circular cylindrical front areas 21, whilst between the circular cylindrical front areas 21 (and in complementary manner to the trough-shaped strap belts 14, 15, the deflection drums 17, 18) are virtually constructed as a one-sheet hyperboloid.<br>
In order to ensure the necessary sealing of the sandwich lock 5 relative to the atmosphere pressure, also in the vicinity of the front passage opening 23 and a lower slot opening 24 for the deflected, lower strap belt 14, as well as an upper slot opening<br>
25	for the deflected, upper strap belt 15, they are provided<br>
with seals, whereof fig. 3 only shows an upper sealing area 34<br>
of a seal 33 for the passage opening 23 and a lower sealing area<br>
35. The upper sealing area 35 has vertically adjustable sealing<br>
laminas, which rest in resilient or sliding manner on the upper<br>
strap belt 15. The lower sealing area 35 of seal 33 is only<br>
partly shown. The seals of the lower slot opening 24 and upper<br>
slot opening 25 are not shown. These seals and the lower sealing area 35 can in particular be constructed as a labyrinth packing.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the construction and arrangement of the double strap belt 13 between the upper, deflected strap belt 15 and the lower, deflected strap belt 14. For supporting the trough-shaped area of the deflected, lower strap belt 14 backing rolls<br>
26	are provided. The upper, deflected strap belt 15 in principle requires no deflection drums. The double strap belt 13 between the deflected, lower and upper strap belt 14, 15 has the<br>
milling material 4 to be supplied in the crosssectionally biconvex reception area 20.<br><br>
