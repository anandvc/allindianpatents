METHANOL CARBONYLATION SYSTEM HAVING ABSORBER WITH<br>
MULTIPLE SOLVENT OPTIONS<br>
Claim for Priority<br>
This non-provisional application claims the benefit of the filing date of<br>
United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/125,791, of the same<br>
title, filed April 29, 2009. The priority of United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 61/125,791 is hereby claimed and the disclosure thereof is<br>
incorporated into this application by reference.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to acetic acid production and, in particular, to<br>
a methanol carbonylation system with a light ends absorber adapted to use<br>
different scrubber solvents and return the used solvent to the carbonylation<br>
system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Acetic acid production by way of methanol carbonylation is known in the<br>
art. Generally speaking, a methanol carbonylation production line includes a<br>
reaction section, a purification section, light ends recovery and a catalyst reservoir<br>
system. In the reaction section, methanol and carbon monoxide are contacted with<br>
rhodium or iridium catalyst in a homogenous stirred liquid phase reaction medium<br>
in a reactor to produce acetic acid. Methanol is pumped to the reactor from a<br>
methanol surge tank. The process is highly efficient, having a conversion of<br>
methanol to acetic acid of typically greater than 99 percent. The reaction section<br>
also includes a flash vessel coupled to the reactor which flashes a draw stream in<br>
order to remove crude product from the reaction section. The crude product is fed<br>
to a purification section which includes generally a light ends or stripper column,<br>
a drying column, auxiliary purification and optionally a finishing column. In the<br>
process, various vent streams containing light ends, notably methyl iodide, carbon<br>
monoxide and methyl acetate are generated and fed to the light ends recovery<br>
 <br>
section. These vent streams are scrubbed with a solvent to remove the light ends<br>
which are returned to the system or discarded.<br>
In a traditional, Monsanto methanol carbonylation plant, a high pressure<br>
and low pressure absorber are included wherein acetic acid is used as the scrubber<br>
solvent. The acetic acid solvent must subsequently be stripped of light ends,<br>
usually in another purification column so that the acid is not wasted. Such<br>
columns are expensive because they must be made of a highly corrosion resistant<br>
material such as zirconium alloys and so forth. Moreover, stripping light ends<br>
from the acid requires steam and contributes to operating expense.<br>
Nevertheless, using acetic acid as a scrubber solvent is widespread in the<br>
carbonylation art generally. See for example, United States Patent No. 5,502,243<br>
to Waller et ah, entitled "Hydrocarbonylation of Dimethyl Ether". Note the<br>
disclosure at Figure 3, and the discussion at Cols. 8 and 9 concerning operation of<br>
an absorber 321. A cool acetic stream 323 passes downwardly through this<br>
absorber and absorbs any residual co-products and volatile catalyst components<br>
from the vent gas.<br>
So also, there is disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,241,219 to Wan,<br>
entitled "Treatment of Carbonylation Effluent", a method of recovering volatile<br>
components by contact with a scrubbing solvent recovered from the reaction<br>
mixture in the same production line. See Col. 2, lines 15-30 wherein it is noted<br>
that acetic anhydride, ethylidene diacetate, acetic acid, or mixtures of them can be<br>
used as a vent gas scrubber solvent.<br>
Methanol has been suggested for use as a scrubber solvent in connection<br>
with a methanol carbonylation process. In this regard, see United States Patent<br>
No. 5,416,237 to Aubigne et ah, entitled "Process for the Production of Acetic<br>
Acid". It is noted in the '237 patent that noncondensables from a flash tank vapor<br>
overhead may be scrubbed countercurrently with chilled methanol. The methanol<br>
 <br>
scrubber solvent residual stream is added to pure methanol and then used as feed<br>
to the reactor. See Col. 9, lines 30-42. If the reactor is not consuming the residual<br>
stream, it must be stored separately or purified again contributing to capital<br>
expense and operating costs.<br>
Chinese Patent Application Publication No. 200410016120.7 discloses a<br>
method for recovering light components in vent gas from production of acetic<br>
acid/acetic anhydride by way of scrubbing with methanol and acetic acid. The<br>
system disclosed in the Publication No. 200410016120.7 discloses a two stage<br>
absorption arrangement wherein vent gas is treated sequentially with two different<br>
absorbents in a two stage system. Note particularly Figure 2. Another system is<br>
seen in an industrial publication entitled "Process of 200ktpa Methanol Low Press<br>
Oxo Synthesis AA" (SWRDICI 2006) (China). In this research publication there<br>
is shown a vent gas treatment system including a high pressure absorber as well as<br>
a low pressure absorber. Both absorbers of this system are operated utilizing<br>
methanol as a scrub fluid.<br>
While there have been advances in the art, known methods of scrubbing<br>
vent gases in methanol carbonylation systems typically involve multiple absorber<br>
towers which are expensive to fabricate and operate. In accordance with the<br>
invention, there is provided an improved methanol carbonylation system with an<br>
absorber capable of using different solvents. The inventive system reduces both<br>
capital requirements and operating costs as compared with conventional systems.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
There is provided a carbonylation system for making acetic acid having an<br>
absorber tower with multiple scrubber solvent options for treating vent gas. The<br>
absorber recovers methyl iodide and other volatiles such as methyl acetate vapor<br>
from the vent gas with scrubber solvent, the tower being coupled to first and<br>
second scrubber solvent sources which are capable of supplying different scrubber<br>
solvents. Typically, methanol is used as a scrubber solvent in a steady state mode<br>
 <br>
of operation, while acetic acid may be used during start-up or transient operation<br>
of the unit. A switching system alternatively provides either methanol or acetic<br>
acid to the tower and returns the solvent and recovered volatiles to the<br>
carbonylation system for further reaction. During changeover of scrubber<br>
solvents, the recovered material may be added to the catalyst reservoir system if<br>
so desired.<br>
The use of a one column system light ends absorber in accordance with the<br>
invention allows operation without the need for a dedicated light ends stripper for<br>
recovering methyl iodide from the system offgas vent stream. A salient benefit is<br>
capital reduction for new acetic acid carbonylation projects (eliminate stripper<br>
column system, reboiler, subcooler, and associated instrumentation and piping) by<br>
being able to use one absorber system on two different scrub mediums to<br>
accommodate all modes of operation including: startup, normal operation, upset<br>
operation and shutdown. Another benefit is energy reduction for normal operation<br>
via steam savings realized by elimination of the need for an auxiliary stripper<br>
column for scrubber solvent. Still another benefit is better scrub of light ends<br>
component methyl iodide by using sub-chilled 5-15 °C methanol for a normal<br>
operation mode.<br>
Further details and advantages will be apparent from the discussion which<br>
follows.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention is described in detail below with reference to the appended<br>
drawings, wherein like numerals designate similar parts. In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a carbonylation system for<br>
making acetic acid and<br>
 <br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram illustrating a vent gas absorber and<br>
switching system used in connection with the system of Figure 1.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention is described in detail below with reference to numerous<br>
embodiments for purposes of exemplification and illustration only. Modifications<br>
to particular embodiments within the spirit and scope of the present invention, set<br>
forth in the appended claims, will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
Unless more specifically defined below, terminology as used herein is<br>
given its ordinary meaning. % and like terms refer to weight percent, unless<br>
otherwise indicated.<br>
"Consisting essentially of and like terminology refers to a composition<br>
consisting of 90% by weight or more of the specified component. Thus a scrubber<br>
solvent stream consists essentially of methanol if it is at least 90% methanol.<br>
"Low pressure" and like terminology refers to pressures much lower than<br>
the pressure maintained in a carbonylation reactor of the class discussed herein.<br>
Low pressure thus refers to gauge pressures generally less than 10 bar, suitably<br>
less than 5 bar, typically less than about 3 bar and in some cases less than 1 bar.<br>
"Volatile" components are those compounds in vapor phase and/or having<br>
a boiling point below or equal to that of methyl acetate including methyl iodide.<br>
As used herein the "purified process stream" includes the process stream<br>
fed forward from the light ends column, and any subsequent purifications of the<br>
light ends process stream.<br>
A Group VIII catalyst metal used in connection with the present invention<br>
may be a rhodium and/or iridium catalyst. The rhodium metal catalyst may be<br>
 <br>
added in any suitable form such that rhodium is in the catalyst solution as an<br>
equilibrium mixture including [Rh(CO)2I2]- anion as is well known in the art.<br>
When rhodium solution is in the carbon monoxide-rich environment of the<br>
reactor, solubility of the rhodium is generally maintained because<br>
rhodium/carbonyl iodide anionic species are generally soluble in water and acetic<br>
acid. However, when transferred to carbon monoxide depleted environments as<br>
typically exist in the flasher, light ends column and so forth, the equilibrium<br>
rhodium/catalyst composition changes since less carbon monoxide is available.<br>
Rhodium precipitates as RhI3, for example; details as to the form of entrained<br>
rhodium downstream of the reactor is not well understood. Iodide salts help<br>
alleviate precipitation in the flasher under so-called "low water" conditions as will<br>
be appreciated by one of skill in the art.<br>
Iodide salts maintained in the reaction mixtures of the processes described<br>
herein may be in the form of a soluble salt of an alkali metal or alkaline earth<br>
metal or a quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt. In certain embodiments,<br>
the catalyst co-promoter is lithium iodide, lithium acetate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The iodide salt may be added as a mixture of salts such as a mixture of lithium<br>
iodide and sodium iodide and/or potassium iodide. Alternatively, the iodide salt<br>
may be generated in-situ since under the operating conditions of the reaction<br>
system, a wide range of non-iodide salt precursors such as alkali metal acetates<br>
will react with methyl iodide to generate the corresponding co-promoter iodide<br>
salt stabilizer. Suitable salts can be generated in situ from non-ionic precursors,<br>
such as a phosphine oxide or any suitable organic ligand or ligands if so desired.<br>
Phosphine oxides and suitable organic ligands generally undergo quaternization in<br>
the presence of methyl iodide at elevated temperatures to yield salts which<br>
maintain iodide anion concentration. For additional detail regarding iodide salt<br>
generation, see United States Patent Nos. 5,001,259 to Smith et al.; 5,026,908 to<br>
Smith et al.; and 5,144,068, also to Smith et al., the disclosures of which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
 <br>
An iridium catalyst in the liquid carbonylation reaction composition may<br>
comprise any iridium-containing compound which is soluble in the liquid reaction<br>
composition. The iridium catalyst may be added to the liquid reaction<br>
composition for the carbonylation reaction in any suitable form which dissolves in<br>
the liquid reaction composition or is convertible to a soluble form. Examples of<br>
suitable iridium-containing compounds which may be added to the liquid reaction<br>
composition include: IrCl3, IrI3, IrBr3, [Ir(CO)2I]2, [Ir(CO)2Cl]2, [Ir(CO)2Br]2,<br>
[Ir(CO)2I2]-H+, [Ir(CO)2Br2]-H+, [Ir(CO)2I4]-H+, [Ir(CH3)I3(C02]-H+, Ir4(CO)12,<br>
IrCl3.3H2O, IrBr3.3H2O, Ir4(CO)12, iridium metal, Ir2O3, Ir(acac)(CO)2, Ir(acac)3,<br>
iridium acetate, [Ir3O(OAc)6(H2O)3][OAc], and hexachloroiridic acid [H2IrCl6].<br>
Chloride-free complexes of iridium such as acetates, oxalates and acetoacetates<br>
are usually employed as starting materials. The iridium catalyst concentration in<br>
the liquid reaction composition may be in the range of 100 to 6000 ppm. The<br>
carbonylation of methanol utilizing iridium catalyst is well known and is generally<br>
described in the following United States Patents: 5,942,460; 5,932,764;<br>
5,883,295; 5,877,348; 5,877,347 and 5,696,284, the disclosures of which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference into this application as if set forth in their<br>
entirety.<br>
A supported Group VIII catalyst may employed if so desired. One<br>
preferred system includes an insoluble polymer having pendent pyrrolidone<br>
groups which support a rhodium species. One suitable catalyst is a poly-<br>
vinylpyrrolidone which has been crosslinked and rhodium loaded. Cross-linking<br>
can be achieved using a caustic catalyst as disclosed in United States Patent No.<br>
2,938,017 or by using a cross-linking agent such as disclosed in German<br>
2,059,484. These references are herein incorporated by reference. This catalyst is<br>
prepared by reacting the polymer support with an alkyl halide and a rhodium<br>
compound. Both reactions are readily accomplished by standard procedures and<br>
using known components for such reactions. For example, it is preferred to simply<br>
add an amount of the insoluble polymer such as in powder or resin bead form to<br>
what otherwise constitutes as the homogeneous medium for the methanol<br>
 <br>
carbonylation reaction. Such carbonylation reaction medium includes methanol<br>
and/or methyl acetate, acetic acid and a small amount of water in a pressure vessel<br>
along with a rhodium compound and an iodide promoter as described herein.<br>
Further details appear in United States Patent No. 5,466,874, the disclosure of<br>
 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Another system includes an insoluble, pyridine ring-containing polymer,<br>
and a Group VIII metal supported thereon and is known per se. The term<br>
"pyridine ring-containing polymer" used herein is intended to refer to a polymer<br>
 containing substituted or non-substituted pyridine rings or substituted or non-<br>
substituted, pyridine-containing polycondensed rings such as quinoline rings. The<br>
substituents include those inert to the methanol carbonylation such as an alkyl<br>
group and alkoxy group. Typical examples of the insoluble, pyridine ring-con-<br>
taining polymers include those obtained by reaction of vinylpyridine with a<br>
 divinyl monomer or by reaction of vinylpyridine with a divinyl monomer-<br>
 containing vinyl monomer, such as copolymers of 4-vinylpyridine and<br>
divinylbenzene, copolymers of 2-vinylpyridine and di-vinylbenzene, copolymers<br>
of styrene, vinylbenzene and divinylbenzene, copolymers of vinylmethylpyridine<br>
and divinylbenzene and copolymers of vinylpyridine, methyl acrylate and ethyl<br>
 diacrylate. Further details appear in United States Patent No. 5,334,755, the<br>
	disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Methyl iodide is used as the promoter. Preferably, the concentration of<br>
methyl in the liquid reaction composition is in the range 1 to 50% by weight,<br>
 preferably 2 to 30% by weight.<br>
The promoter may be combined with a salt stabilizer/co-promoter<br>
compound, which may include salts of a metal of Group IA or Group IIA, or a<br>
quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salt. Particularly preferred are iodide or<br>
 acetate salts, e.g., lithium iodide or lithium acetate.<br>
 <br>
Other promoters and co-promoters may be used as part of the catalytic<br>
system of the present invention as described in European Patent Publication EP 0<br>
849 248, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Suitable<br>
promoters are selected from ruthenium, osmium, tungsten, rhenium, zinc,<br>
cadmium, indium, gallium, mercury, nickel, platinum, vanadium, titanium,<br>
copper, aluminum, tin, antimony, and are more preferably selected from<br>
ruthenium and osmium. Specific co-promoters are described in United States<br>
Patent No. 6,627,770, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A promoter may be present in an effective amount up to the limit of its<br>
solubility in the liquid reaction composition and/or any liquid process streams<br>
recycled to the carbonylation reactor from the acetic acid recovery stage. When<br>
used, the promoter is suitably present in the liquid reaction composition at a molar<br>
ratio of promoter to metal catalyst of [0.5 to 15]: 1, preferably [2 to 10]: 1, more<br>
preferably [2 to 7.5]: 1. A suitable promoter concentration is 400 to 5000 ppm.<br>
The carbonylation apparatus or process that is the subject of the invention<br>
typically includes a reactive section, purification section, a catalyst reservoir<br>
system and a light ends recovery system. The present invention may be<br>
appreciated in connection with, for example, the carbonylation of methanol with<br>
carbon monoxide in a homogeneous catalytic reaction system comprising a<br>
reaction solvent (typically acetic acid), methanol and/or its reactive derivatives, a<br>
soluble rhodium catalyst, at least a finite concentration of water. The<br>
carbonylation reaction proceeds as methanol and carbon monoxide are<br>
continuously fed to the reactor. The carbon monoxide reactant may be essentially<br>
pure or may contain inert impurities such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen,<br>
noble gases, water and C1 to C4 paraffinic hydrocarbons. The presence of<br>
hydrogen in the carbon monoxide and generated in situ by the water gas shift<br>
reaction is preferably kept low, for example, less than 1 Bar partial pressure, as its<br>
presence may result in the formation of hydrogenation products. The partial<br>
 <br>
pressure of carbon monoxide in the reaction is suitably in the range 1 to 70 bar,<br>
preferably 1 to 35 bar, and most preferably 1 to 15 bar.<br>
The pressure of the carbonylation reaction is suitably in the range 10 to<br>
200 Bar, preferably 10 to 100 bar, most preferably 15 to 50 Bar. The temperature<br>
of the carbonylation reaction is suitably in the range 100 to 300°C, preferably in<br>
the range 150 to 220°C. Acetic acid is typically manufactured in a liquid phase<br>
reaction at a temperature of from about 150 - 200°C and a total pressure of from<br>
about 20 to about 50 bar.<br>
Acetic acid is typically included in the reaction mixture as the solvent for<br>
the reaction.<br>
Suitable reactive derivatives of methanol include methyl acetate, dimethyl<br>
ether, methyl formate and methyl iodide. A mixture of methanol and reactive<br>
derivatives thereof may be used as reactants in the process of the present<br>
invention. Preferably, methanol and/or methyl acetate are used as reactants. At<br>
least some of the methanol and/or reactive derivative thereof will be converted to,<br>
and hence present as, methyl acetate in the liquid reaction composition by reaction<br>
with acetic acid product or solvent. The concentration in the liquid reaction<br>
composition of methyl acetate is suitably in the range 0.5 to 70% by weight,<br>
preferably 0.5 to 50% by weight, more preferably 1 to 35%) by weight and most<br>
preferably 1 -20%) by weight.<br>
Water may be formed in situ in the liquid reaction composition, for<br>
example, by the esterification reaction between methanol reactant and acetic acid<br>
product. Water may be introduced to the carbonylation reactor together with or<br>
separately from other components of the liquid reaction composition. Water may<br>
be separated from other components of reaction composition withdrawn from the<br>
reactor and may be recycled in controlled amounts to maintain the required<br>
concentration of water in the liquid reaction composition. Preferably, the<br>
 <br>
concentration of water maintained in the liquid reaction composition is in the<br>
range 0.1 to 16% by weight, more preferably 1 to 14% by weight, most preferably<br>
1 to 10% by weight.<br>
The reaction liquid is typically drawn from the reactor and flashed in a one<br>
step or multi-step process using a converter as well as a flash vessel as hereinafter<br>
described. The crude vapor process stream from the flasher is sent to a<br>
purification system which generally includes at least a light ends column and a<br>
dehydration column. As noted earlier, the form of any catalyst metal which is<br>
entrained to the light ends column and beyond is not well understood; however,<br>
the entrained catalyst metal is lost in conventional systems.<br>
The present invention is further appreciated by reference to Fig. 1 which is<br>
a schematic diagram illustrating a typical carbonylation process and apparatus. In<br>
Fig. 1 there is shown a carbonylation system 10 including a reactor 12 provided<br>
with a feed system 14 including a methanol surge tank 16 and a carbon monoxide<br>
feed line. A catalyst reservoir system includes a methyl iodide storage vessel 20<br>
as well as a catalyst storage tank 22. Reactor 12 is provided with a vent 24 and an<br>
optional vent 24a. Reactor 12 is coupled to a flash vessel 26 by way of a conduit<br>
28 and optionally by way of vent 24a. The flasher, in turn, is coupled to a<br>
purification section 30 which includes a light ends or stripper column 32, a<br>
dehydration column 34 and a strong acid, silver-exchanged cation ion-exchange<br>
resin bed 36 which removes iodides from the product. Instead of a silver-<br>
exchanged, strong acid cation ion-exchange resin, it has been reported that anion<br>
ion-exchange resin can be used to remove iodides. See British Patent No. G<br>
2112394A, as well as United States Patent No. 5,416,237, Col. 7, lines 54+, which<br>
teaches the use of 4-vinylpyridine resins for iodide removal.<br>
A gaseous purge stream is typically vented from the head of the reactor to<br>
prevent buildup of gaseous by-products such as methane, carbon dioxide and<br>
hydrogen and to maintain a set carbon monoxide partial pressure at a given total<br>
 <br>
reactor pressure. A very significant improvement in processing involves<br>
minimizing or eliminating the high pressure vent from reactor 12 via line 24 to a<br>
high pressure absorber and instead utilizing a vent line such as line 24a. When<br>
operating at low water conditions as described herein, by-products and vent<br>
requirements are much reduced such that non-condensables can be vented at low<br>
pressure after flashing and stripping the light ends as is seen in Figures 1 and 2<br>
while maintaining a predetermined carbon monoxide partial pressure in the<br>
reactor. Thus, the use of a high pressure absorber can be eliminated and/or<br>
minimized saving capital and operating costs.<br>
Optionally (as illustrated in Chinese Patent No. ZL92108244.4), a so-<br>
called "converter" reactor can be employed which is located between the reactor<br>
and flasher vessel shown in Figure 1. Optionally, the gaseous purge streams may<br>
be vented through the flasher base liquid or lower part of the light ends column to<br>
enhance rhodium stability and/or they may be combined with other gaseous<br>
process vents (such as the purification column overhead receiver vents) prior to<br>
scrubbing. Carbon monoxide may be added directly to a converter vessel if so<br>
desired or may be added slightly before (upstream) or after (downstream) if so<br>
desired in order to stabilize the catalyst solution and consume any unreacted<br>
methanol. Details of such arrangements are seen in European Patent No. EP 0<br>
759 419 as well as United States Patent No. 5,770, 768 to Denis et al., the<br>
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
These variations are well within the scope of the present invention as will<br>
be appreciated from the appended claims and the description which follows.<br>
As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the different chemical<br>
environments encountered in the purification train may require different<br>
metallurgy. For example, equipment at the outlet of the light ends column will<br>
likely require a zirconium vessel due to the corrosive nature of the process stream,<br>
 <br>
while a vessel of stainless steel may be sufficient for equipment placed<br>
downstream of the dehydration column where conditions are much less corrosive.<br>
Carbon monoxide and methanol are introduced continuously into reactor<br>
12 with adequate mixing at a high carbon monoxide partial pressure. The non-<br>
condensable bi-products are vented from the reactor to maintain an optimum<br>
carbon monoxide partial pressure. The reactor off gas is treated to recover reactor<br>
condensables, i.e., methyl iodide before flaring. Methanol and carbon monoxide<br>
efficiencies are generally greater than about 98 and 90% respectively. As will be<br>
appreciated from the Smith et al. patent noted above, major inefficiencies of the<br>
process are the concurrent manufacture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen by way of<br>
the water gas shift reaction.<br>
From the reactor, a stream of the reaction mixture is continuously fed via<br>
conduit 28 to flasher 26. Through the flasher the product acetic acid and the<br>
majority of the light ends (methyl iodide, methyl acetate, water) are separated<br>
from the reactor catalyst solution, and the crude process stream 38 is forwarded<br>
with dissolved gases to the distillation or purification section 30 in single stage<br>
flash. The catalyst solution is recycled to the reactor via conduit 40.<br>
The purification of the acetic acid typically includes distillation in a light<br>
ends column, a dehydration column, and, optionally, a heavy ends column. The<br>
crude vapor process stream 38 from the flasher is fed into the light ends column<br>
32. Methyl iodide, methyl acetate, and a portion of the water condense overhead<br>
in the light end columns to form two phases (organic and aqueous) in a receiver<br>
42. Both overhead liquid phases return to the reaction section via recycle line 44.<br>
Optionally, a liquid recycle stream 45 from the light ends column may also be<br>
returned to the reactor.<br>
The purified process stream 50 is drawn off the side of the light ends<br>
column 32 and is fed into dehydration column 34. Water and some acetic acid<br>
 <br>
from this column separate and are recycled to the reaction system via recycle line<br>
44 as shown. The purified and dried process stream 52 from the dehydration<br>
column 34 feeds resin bed 36 and product is taken therefrom at 56 as shown.<br>
Carbonylation system 10 uses only two primary purification columns and is<br>
preferably operated as described in more detail in United States Patent No.<br>
6,657,078 to Scates et ah, entitled "Low Energy Carbonylation Process", the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Additional columns are<br>
generally used as desired, depending on the system.<br>
Receiver 42 is vented via line 60 to the light ends recovery system 70<br>
shown in Figure 2 which includes a switching system 72 which has a plurality of<br>
valves and pumps in order to selectively couple system 70 to scrubber solvent<br>
sources and return the used scrub solvent to the desired point in the carbonylation<br>
system as hereinafter described. Note also reactor 12 may be directly vented to<br>
system 70 via line 24 if necessary.<br>
Light ends recovery system 70 has an absorber tower 75 which is fed with<br>
vent gas via line 80 and with scrubber solvent via line 82. Preferably the scrubber<br>
solvent is chilled with a chiller 84 prior to being fed to tower 75 wherein the<br>
solvent flows countercurrently with respect to the vent gas, absorbing methyl<br>
iodide and additional relative components before exiting the tower via return line<br>
84 and being returned to the carbonylation unit. The scrubbed vent gas exits the<br>
tower at 86 and is further processed. For example, a second stage water scrub<br>
could be used to remove methyl acetate, methanol, acetic acid and so forth before<br>
flaring if so desired. Alternatively, a second stage water scrub could be provided<br>
in tower 75 if so desired. Preferably, more than 90% of the methyl iodide is<br>
removed from the vent gas. The scrubber fluid is generally chilled to a<br>
temperature of from about 5°C to about 25°C prior to use in the tower, with the<br>
proviso that when acetic acid is used as the scrubber solvent, the temperature of<br>
the solvent is held at 17°C or more to prevent freezing.<br>
 <br>
Switching system 72 includes a plurality of valves such as valves 90, 92,<br>
94, 96, 98 and one or more pumps 100,102 to raise pressure in the return lines<br>
104,106,108,110 if needed. Feed valves 96, 98 are used to select the scrubber<br>
solvent which may be methanol from tank 16 or acetic acid from stream 56<br>
depending upon the mode of operation of tower 75.<br>
In steady state operation of carbonylation system 10 valve 98 is closed and<br>
methanol is fed from tank 16 through open valve 96 via line 112 to chiller 84,<br>
wherein the methanol is cooled. From the chiller, methanol is fed to tower 75,<br>
where it flows countercurrently with vent gas and sorbs methyl iodide and other<br>
volatile components therefrom before exiting the column via line 84. The used<br>
solvent with sorbed methyl iodide is pumped back to reactor 12 or tank 16 with<br>
pumps 100,102 via line 106. In this mode of operation valves 92, 94 are closed<br>
and valve 90 is open.<br>
During start up or shut down of the system it may be desirable to operate<br>
tower 75 using acetic acid as the scrub solvent. In this mode of operation, valve<br>
98 is open and valve 96 is closed. Acid may be sourced from product stream 56<br>
or a tank from (TF) if so desired. The acid flows through line 112 to chiller 84<br>
where it is chilled and fed to tower 75 via line 82 and scrubs the vent gas supplied<br>
via lines 60, 80 as noted above. The acid exits the tower 75 via line 84 and is<br>
pumped back to the carbonylation system by way of pumps 100,102 via lines<br>
104,108. In this mode of operation of tower 75, valves 90, 94 are closed and<br>
valve 92 is open so that the used acetic acid is returned to light ends column 32,<br>
the dehydration column 34, or elsewhere in the purification system for stripping.<br>
During changeover from one solvent to the other, such as from methanol<br>
to acetic acid, it is generally undesirable to return the scrub fluid to the methanol<br>
feed system or light ends column since inefficiencies result. For such, a<br>
changeover may be accomplished in from about 5 to about 20 minutes, during<br>
which time the used scrubber solvent is fed to catalyst reservoir 22. In changeover<br>
 <br>
mode, valves 90, 92 are closed and valve 94 is open. Thus the system is operated<br>
generally by way of (a) feeding vent gas from the carbonylation unit to the<br>
absorber tower, the vent gas including methyl iodide and optionally additional<br>
volatile components; (b) supplying a first scrubber solvent to the absorber tower,<br>
the first scrubber solvent consisting essentially of acetic acid; (c) contacting the<br>
vent gas with the first scrubber solvent thereby removing methyl iodide and<br>
optionally additional volatile components from the gas and absorbing methyl<br>
iodide and optionally additional volatile components into the first scrubber solvent;<br>
(d) feeding an absorber return stream including first scrubber solvent and absorbed<br>
methyl iodide and optionally additional absorbed volatile components to the light<br>
ends column, the dehydration column or elsewhere in the purification system; (e)<br>
terminating the supply of first scrubber solvent to the absorber tower; (f) supplying<br>
a second scrubber solvent to the absorber tower, the second scrubber solvent<br>
consisting essentially of methanol; (g) contacting the vent gas with the second<br>
scrubber solvent thereby removing methyl iodide and optionally additional volatile<br>
components from the gas and absorbing methyl iodide and optionally additional<br>
volatile components into the second scrubber solvent; (h) feeding an absorber<br>
return stream including first scrubber solvent, second scrubber solvent, absorbed<br>
methyl iodide and optionally additional absorbed volatile components from the<br>
absorber tower to the reactor; and (i) following the transition period, continue<br>
feeding an absorber return stream including second scrubber solvent and absorbed<br>
methyl iodide and optionally additional absorbed volatile components to the<br>
reactor. Feed to the absorber tower is selected by operation of valves 96, 98.<br>

apparatus, modifications to these examples within the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art. In view of the<br>
