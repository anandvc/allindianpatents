A LAP FORMING APPARATUS ON A LAP-PACKAGE PRODUCING MACHINE<br>
This invention relates to a lap forming apparatus of a lap package producing machine. This apparatus is useful in producing laps with enhanced quality at higher delivery speeds.<br>
Lap package production machine or lap winding machine is used for the production of laps from slivers produced in draw frames. Drafted slivers are withdrawn from sliver cans and fed to drafting arrangements by means of feeding arrangement consisting of a number of roller pairs drivingly connected to the main motor of the machine. Lap formed from this drafted sliver is fed to table calender rollers and calender rollers for compacting and fed to lap spool which is supported by two lap discs and driven by lap rollers.<br>
Winding apparatus for the formation taps in known lap package production machine consists of two drivable and rotatable winding rollers for frictional rotation of the lap bobbin or the lap to be formed. Movable carrier arms are located on both sides of the winding rollers for receiving or supporting the lap bobbin or the lap being formed. Means are provided to move the carrier arms at a predetermined force against the lap in accordance with the increase in size of the lap which is further processed in the combing machine.<br><br>
In known lap forming machines, winding rollers, or lap rollers are driven by a common constant speed motor. Since the lap rollers and calender rollers are driven through gears, tension draft between the calender roller and the lap roller Is not variable and is set at a predetermined value. During lap build up, the lap diameter increases considerably which necessitates constinuous alteration of the tension draft between the calender roller and the lap roller. In the known lap forming process it is observed that lap bubbles are formed affecting the quality of the lap adversely. This is attributed to the constant speed ratio at which the rollers are driven during the lap build up process irrespective of the diameter of the growing lap. Yet another limitation of the existing machine is that the winding speed cannot be increased beyond certain level because of the lap bubbles.<br>
Similariy, tension draft between the lap rollers can also be set to a particular value only and cannot be varied in accordance with the increase in the lap diameter. In the absence of any means for continuous alteration of tension draft between lap rollers, lap bubble formation takes place which affects the quality of the lap adversely.<br><br>
It Is an object of this invention to provide means for continuously altering the tension draft between the calender roller and the lap roller as the winding of the lap progresses. This eliminates the formation of lap bubbles, thereby enhancing the quality of the lap produced.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to continuously alter the tension draft between the lap rollers as the winding of the lap progresses. This eliminates bubble formation in the lap and enhances the quality of the lap produced. Winding speed also can be enhanced resulting In higher productivity.<br>
The apparatus, therefore, provides means for continuously altering the tension draft between the calender roller and the first lap roller. Means for regulating the tension draft between the first and second lap rollers is also provided. This avoids bubble formation in the lap and enhances the delivery speed.<br>
Drafting rollers, calender rollers and creel rollers are driven by a motor. A sensing means is provided to measure the number of revolution of the calender roller located immediately before the first lap roller. This sensing means has an input means connected to a control means which is programmable.<br><br>
A separate drive means consisting of a variable speed motor and a variable speed drive is provided to drive the first lap roller. A sensing means for continuously measuring the number of revolution of the first lap roller with an input means and control means is also provided.<br>
The second lap roller is driven by yet another variable speed motor with variable speed drive. This drive is also provided with a sensing means input means and control unit. The sensing means is provided with an input means and a control means to continuously measure the number of revolutions of the second lap roller.<br>
A programmable contro] processing unit is provided which generates and provides necessary signals to the variable speed drives for continously varying the tension drafts between (a) the calender roller and the first lap roller and (b) tension draft between the first and the second lap rollers.<br>
This invention relates a lap forming apparatus for a lap package producing machine comprising drivable drafting rollers, calender rollers and creel rollers, a first and a second lap roller, each being provided with independent variable speed drive means, a first and a<br><br>
'Second sensor means to continuously measure the revolution of said first and second lap rollers respectively, a third sensor means to continuously measure the revolution of the calender roller located immediately before the said first lap roller, a programmable control unit capable of continuously altering the speed of the said lap rollers through the variable speed drives to control the tension draft between said lap rollers and between said first lap roller and said calender roller.<br>
The sensor means may provide digital or analog signals which are processed by the control means which is programmable. This control means may either be a logic control means or an electronic control means.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows the lap forming apparatus of this invention with independently driven lap rollers.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram showing the control circuit.<br>
\n Figure 1, Ri and R2 indicate the lap rollers. Motor Mi is drivingly connected to drive the shaft (1) mounted on antifriction bearings fixed on the machine frame.    The axes of the motor M-, and<br><br>
the drive shaft (1) are parallel to each other. Calender rollers shown by reference numeral 9,10,11 and 12. The axis of the drive shaft (1) Is parallel to the axes of these rollers. Driven pulley (2) is rotatably mounted on one side of the drive shaft (1) and is driven by drive pulley (4) mounted on the shaft of the motor Mi through flat belt (3). Another flat belt pulley (5) is mounted on the drive shaft (1) and is drivingly connected to drive the drafting rollers, creel rollers and table calender rollers. Chain wheel (6) drives calender roller (9) through chain wheel (7) and chain {8). Calender roller (9) drives the other calender rollers 10,11 and 12 through gears 13,14, 15 &amp; 16.<br>
The rotational speed of the motor Mi is determined by the variable speed drive {VO shown in Fig. 2 which receives the necessary signal from the programmable control unit ( C ). The rotational speed of the drafting rollers, calender rollers and creel rollers are set to the required value by the programmable control unit ( C) by inputting the parameters through the display unit (D).<br>
The first lap roller R2 is driven by the variable speed motor M2 the rotational speed of which is determined by variable speed drive<br><br>
. (Va) which receives necessary signals from the control unit ( C). Sensor unit {S2) continuously measures the number of revolution of the lap roller (R2) and the same is provided as input to the control unit in digital or analogue form. Sensor (S3) continuously measures the number of revolution of the calender roller (12) and feeds the data to the control unit ( C). As lap build up progresses, the control unit provides signals against a set value which is fed to the variable speed drive {V2). Motor (M2) alters the rotational speed of the first lap roller {R2) continuously based on the input related to the length of the lap wound which is proportional to the lap diameter. Tension draft between the first lap roller R2 and the calender roller (12) is altered resulting In the elimination of lap bubbles. By this it is possible to run the machine at a higher delivery speed resulting in higher productivity.<br>
The second lap roller (Ri) is driven by variable speed motor M3, the rotational speed of which is determined by variable speed drive (V3). Signals from the control unit ( C) is transmitted to this variable speed drive (V3). Sensor (Si}continuously measures the number of revolutions of the second lap roller (R^) and the data is input into the said control unit (C ). This data is converted into the length of the lap which is proportional to the diameter of the lap by the said control unit (C ). As the lap data build up progresses, from the signals received from the sensors {Si and S2), the said programmable control unit transmitts necessary signals against set value to the variable speed<br><br>
drive (V3) the speed of the said second lap roller (Ri ) is altered continuously based on these signals which are dependent on the length of the lap wound which is proportional to the diameter of the lap. This controls the tension draft between the said first lap roller (R2) and the second lap rolhr (Ri) resulting in the elimination of lap bubbles.<br>
From the signals provided by the said sensors Si, S2 and S3, the programmable control unit ( C ) generates either digital or analog signals which are used for controlling the speed of the said lap rollers (Ri ) and (R2 ) through the said variable speed drives (V2 ) and ( Vs.) A display unit (D) attached to the control unit ( C) displays various process parameters and the process parameters are input to the said control unit { C) through the said display unit (D).<br>
Though this invention is hereinbefore described and illustrated with reference to a specific embodiment, obvious alterations and modifications known to persons skilled in the art are well within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
