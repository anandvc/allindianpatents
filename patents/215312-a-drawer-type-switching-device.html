				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to	<br>
drawer-type switching device mounted into the enclosed switchgear, and a locking unit suitably used in the switching device.<br>
The enclosed switchgear is arranged so that an inside of an outer case as a box made of grounding metal is divided by partition walls made of grounding material or insulating material and thus a plurality of compartments are formed, these compartments store respectively a bus-side branched conductor connected with a common bus, a load-side conductor connected with a power transmission cable for transmitting electricity to a load such as another electric chamber and load device, a switching device comprised of a breaker for connecting/disconnecting both the conductors, and a controlling device required for monitoring and control.<br>
In such an enclosed switchgear, when the insides of the compartments are inspected, in order to prevent inspectors from getting an electric shock due to residual voltage of the internal devices, it is necessary to eliminate voltages in the internal devices before the inspection. For this reason, as described in, , for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 4-54807 (1992), the switching device is arranged so asTto be freely moved from a test position to an operating position along guiding members with a<br>
predetermined length provided in the compartment storing the switching device, and for the internal inspection, to be drawn out to the test position along the guiding members in the compartment and securely disconnect the bus-side branched conductor and load-side conductor.<br>
The following will describe the conventional drawer-type switching device on reference to FIGS. 1-8. FIG. 1 is a front view of the drawer-type switching device, FIG. 2 is a side view, FIG. 3 is a partially enlarged front view showing a vicinity of connectors, FIG. 4 is a sectional view taken along line X-X in FIG. 3, FIG. 5 is an explanatory drawing showing a state that a movable plug is connected with a stational receptacle in FIG. 3, FIG. 6 is an explanatory drawing showing a state the switching device is moved, FIG. 7 is a plan view showing only the stational receptacle and movable plug, and FIG. 8 is a perspective view of a plug cover.<br>
A conventional drawer-type switching device E includes a device main body H, which is provided with a switching circuit and a stational receptacle F to be connected with the switching circuit and can move from a test position shown in FIG. 2A to an operating position shown in FIG. 2B along guiding members G with a predetermined length, and a locking unit J for locking to constrain the movement of the device main body H.<br>
The stational receptacle F and locking unit J are provided to a front-right-lower portion of the device main body H, and a contact Y connected with the bus-side branched conductor and load-side conductor, and a contact Z connected therewith so as to be<br>
freely connected/disconnected are provided to a rear surface of the device main body H. Moreover, wheels K which are freely rotated along the guiding members G are provided to a front right and left lower portions of the device main body H.<br>
A movable plug L connected with the controller is connected with the stational receptacle F so as to be detachable from a front side of the device main body H. Moreover, an axis of a U-shaped plug hook M is pivotably supported to upper and lower surfaces of the stational receptacle F, and the plug hook M constrains the movement of the movable plug L with respect to the stational receptacle F.<br>
The locking unit J includes a hook-shaped locking body 0 supported to a right surface of the device main body H via a horizontal shaft N so as to be swingable and a plug cover P, a spring Q for applying a force to the locking body 0 in one of swinging directions, and a lock releasing lever R supported to a supporting hardware protruded from the device main body H so as to be freely moved laterally.<br>
When the movable plug L is connected with the stational receptacle F, the lock releasing lever R constrains the swing motion of the locking body 0 so as to unlock, and its one end contacts with a protrusion 01 protruded from the locking body 0, and the other end reaches the inside of the stational receptacle F. Further, a pressing portion S which can be engaged with the other end of the lock releasing lever R is provided to the movable plug L<br>
The locking body 0 is provided with a concave movement locking<br>
portion 02 for locking the movement of the device main body H by means of the engagement with one end d of a fixed shank D provided parallel with the guiding member G.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, a plug cover P is bent to the opposite side of its portion supported to the device main body H, and provided with a connection holding portion PI for holding the connection between the fixed and movable plugs F and L, a swing constraining portion P2 for constraining swing motion of the plug cover P when the device main body H is moved, a contact portion P3 which contacts with a protrusion Dl protruded from the end of the fixed shank D, and an arc-shaped guiding hole P4 for receiving a guiding pin T protruded from the device main body H.<br>
In the drawer-type switching device E having the aforementioned arrangement, when the movable plug L is connected with the stational receptacle F of the switching device E drawn out to the test position, the pressing portion S pushes the lock releasing lever R, and the locking body 0 is swung in a clockwise direction in FIG. 4 about the horizontal shaft N against the spring Q so as to be in a state shown in FIG. 5 (connection detected, lock released).<br>
Next, in the case where the switching device E is moved to the operating position along the guiding member G, accordingly the contact portion P3 of the plug cover P contacts with the protrusion Dl of the fixed shank D as shown in FIG. 5, and the plug cover P is swung in a clockwise direction in FIG. 5 about the horizontal shaft N. Therefore, during moving from the test position to the<br>
operating position, the switching device E is in a state shown in FIG. 6, the front surface of the movable plug L is covered by the connection holding portion PI of the plug cover P, and thus the connection/disconnection of the movable plug L is constrained (prevent connection/disconnection).<br>
Further, in the case where the switching device E is moved from the test position to the operating position without connecting with the movable plug L, since a force is applied to the locking body 0 toward the fixed shank D as shown in FIG. 4, the movement locking portion 02 is brought into contact with the one end d of the fixed shank D so that the movement of the switching device E is constrained (locked).<br>
Furthermore, in the case where the movable plug L was connected with the stational receptacle F of the device main body H drawn out to the test position as above, a pin of the movable plug L can be taken into an engagement hole of the plug hook M and locked by rotating the plug hook M in the clockwise direction from a position represented by a dotted line to a position represented by a continuous line in FIG. 7. After the movable plug L is locked by the plug hook M, when the switching device E is moved towards the operating position, an operating portion of the plug hook M is covered by a lock cover U in a range from the test position to the operating position just after the moving, and thus it is difficult to operate the operating portion.<br>
However, since the locking unit J of the drawer-type switching device E, as mentioned above, includes the locking body 0, plug<br>
cover P and lock releasing lever R, a number of parts is large. Therefore, workability in processing and assembly is not satisfactory, and thus the cost rises.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention will now be described in detail<br>
referring to the accompanying drawings illustrating the embodiments<br>
thereof.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
FIG. 9 is a side view showing a switching device where one<br>
portion is omitted, FIG. 10 is a front view showing the switching<br>
device where one portion is omitted, FIG. 11 is an explanatory drawing showing an operating state, FIG. 12 is an explanatory drawing showing operating processes, and FIG. 13 is a side view schematically showing an enclosed switchgear into which the switching device is mounted inside.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, an enclosed switchgear is arranged so that an inside of a rectangular outer case 1 made of metal is divided by partition walls made of grounding metal or insulating material into a bus chamber la, a cable chamber Ib, a switching device chamber Ic, and a controller chamber Id. A bus-side branched conductor A is provided in the bus chamber la, a load-side conductor B is provided in the cable chamber Ib, a switching device C is provided in the switching device chamber Ic so as to be freely moved, and a controller (not shown) is stored in the controller chamber Id.<br>
Further, a pair of guiding members 2 for guiding the switching device C from a test position to an operating position so as to be freely moved are provided in the switching device chamber Ic at a predetermined interval in a lateral direction. The guiding members 2 are formed by an upper guiding piece 21 and lower guiding piece 22 which faces each other at a predetermined interval in up-and-down direction, and a coupling piece 23 for coupling the upper guiding piece 21 and lower guiding piece 22 so that its section has a U-shape. One end of the right guiding member 2 in the lengthwise direction is provided with a notched portion 2a by notching the upper guiding piece 21 and the coupling piece 23.<br>
The switching device C has a device main body 4 to which a switching circuit and a stational receptacle 3 to be connected with the switching circuit are provided, and a locking unit 5 for constraining and locking the movement of the device main body 4 from the test position to the operating position.<br>
A movable plug 6 connected to the controller is connected with a stational receptacle 3 from a front side of the device main body 4 so as to be detachable therefrom. Moreover, a U-shaped plug hook 31 is mounted to upper and lower surfaces of the stational receptacle 3 so as to be freely rotated, and it constrains the movement of the movable plug 6 with respect to the stational receptacle 3.<br>
The stational receptacle 3 and locking unit 5 are provided to a front-right-lower portion of the device main body 4, and wheels 7 which freely rotate along the guiding member 2 are provided to front right and left lower portions so that the device main body 4 is freely moved by the wheels 7.<br>
The locking unit 5 is composed of a locking body 50, which is supported to a right surface of the device main body 4 via a supporting shaft 8 of a longitudinal direction provided across a pair of supporting pieces 4a facing each other at a predetermined interval in up-and-down direction so as to be swingable. A force is applied to the locking body 50 in a clockwise direction in FIG. 12A by a coiled spring 9 which is wound up around the supporting shaft 8.<br>
The locking body 50 according to Embodiment 1 shown in FIGS. 9<br>
- 12 is formed by a board member, and a pair of bent pieces 5a are protruded from its upper and lower ends in the center portion in a forward-and-backward direction, and the supporting shaft 8 is fitted into through holes provided to the bent pieces 5a.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, in the locking body 50 composed of the board member, a movement locking portion 51, which can contact with the upper guiding piece 21 of the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2 so as to be projected downward farther than the supporting position, is provided to a backward lower portion of the moving direction with respect to the center of the swing, and a lock releasing portion 52, which contacts with one side surface of the movable plug 6 connected with the stational receptacle 3 and constrains the swing motion of the locking body 50 due to the spring 9, and a connection holding portion 53, which is bent towards the stational receptacle 3 from a front end of the lock releasing section 52, are provided to a forward upper end of the moving direction with respect to the center of the swing so as to be projected upward farther than the supporting position. Moreover, a swing constraining portion 54, which can contact with a point edge 21a of the upper guiding piece 21 of the guiding member 2, is provided to a forward lower end of the moving direction with respect to the center of the swing so as to be projected downward farther than the supporting position.<br>
As for the drawer-type switching device C having the aforementioned arrangement, in the case where the switching device C is moved to the operating position without connecting the movable<br>
plug 6 with the stational receptacle 3 of the device main body 4 drawn out to the test position along the guiding member 2, since a force is applied to the locking body 50 towards the guiding member 2 as shown in FIG. 12A by the spring 9, the movement locking portion 51 is brought into contact with the upper guiding piece 21 of the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2 so that the movement of the switching device C is constrained (locked).<br>
In addition, in the case where the movable plug 6 is connected with the stational receptacle 3 of the switching device C drawn out to the test position, as shown in FIG. 12B, when the locking body 50 is swung in the counterclockwise direction against the spring 9, the connection holding portion 53 can be moved back from a connected path of the movable plug 6. Therefore, the movable plug 6 can be easily connected with the stational receptacle 3. Here, in the case where the locking body 50 is swung in the counterclockwise direction in FIG. 12B against the spring 9, since the notched portion 2a is provided to one end of the guiding member 2 and thus the swing constraining portion 54 does not interfere with the guiding member 2, the locking body 50 can be swung as mentioned above.<br>
After connecting the movable plug 6, the locking body 50 is swung in the clockwise direction shown in FIG. 12B by the force of the spring 9, as shown in FIG. 12C, the lock releasing portion 52 contacts with one surface of the movable plug 6 so that the swing motion of the locking body 50 due to the spring 9 is constrained, and the locking body 50 becomes parallel with the guiding member 2.<br>
Therefore, the movement locking portion 51 can be prevented from contacting with the upper guiding piece 21 of the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2, and the device main body 4 can be moved along the guiding member 2 (connection detected, lock released).<br>
In this case, as shown in FIG. 12C, since the connection holding portion 53 enters the connected path of the movable plug 6 so as to face the front surface of the movable plug 6, the extraction of the movable plug 6 can be prevented, and the connected state between the stational receptacle 3 and the movable plug 6 can be held.<br>
As mentioned above, when the movable plug 6 is connected with the stational receptacle 3, the swing motion of the locking body 50 due to the spring 9 is constrained and thus the lock can be released, so the switching device C can be moved from the test position to the operating position along the guiding member 2. According to the movement of the switching device C, the swing constraining portion 54 is brought into contact with the point edge 21a of the upper guiding piece 21 of the guiding member 2, and the swing motion of the locking body 50 is constrained by the guiding member 2. Therefore, the connected state between the stational receptacle 3 and the movable plug 6 can be held securely. Embodiment 2<br>
The following will describe Embodiment 2 shown in FIG. 14.<br>
FIG. 14 is a side view showing the switching device according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention where one portion is omitted. In Embodiment 1, the locking body 50 is supported via the<br>
longitudinal supporting shaft 8 so as to be swingable, but in Embodiment 2 as shown in FIG. 14, a locking body is supported via a transverse supporting shaft 8A so as to be swingable. Since the basic arrangement in Embodiment 2 is the same as that in Embodiment 1, the common drawings and detailed description are omitted.<br>
Embodiment 2 shown in FIG. 14 uses a locking body 50A which is supported to the right surface of the device main body 4 via the supporting shaft 8A protruded in lateral direction so as to be swingable. The locking body 50A has a substantially triangular board member, and the supporting shaft 8A is fitted into a through hole provided into upper and lower halfway portions of the locking body 50A, and a spring 9A lies between the locking body 50A and the device main body 4.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14, in the locking body 50A has the board member, a movement locking portion 51A, which can contact with the upper guiding piece 21 of the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2, is provided to the backward lower end of the moving direction with respect to the center of the swing, and a lock releasing portion 52A and connection holding portion 53A, which are bent towards the stational receptacle 3 and contacts with the front surface of the movable plug 6 connected with the stational receptacle 3 so as to constrain the swing motion of the locking body 50A due to the spring 9A, are provided to the forward upper end of the moving direction with respect to the center of the swing. Moreover, a swing constraining portion 54A, which can contact with the upper surface of the upper guiding piece 21 of the guiding<br>
member 2, is provided to the forward lower end of the moving direction with respect to the center of the swing.<br>
As for the drawer-type switching device C of Embodiment 2 having the aforementioned arrangement, in the case where the switching device C is moved to the operating position without connecting the movable plug 6 with the stational receptacle 3 of the switching device C drawn out to the test position along the guiding member 2, the locking body 50A is held in the position shown in FIG. 14 by the spring 9A, namely, in the position where the movement locking portion 51A enters the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2. For this reason, the movement locking portion 51A is brought into contact with the upper guiding piece 21 of the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2 so that the movement of the switching device C is constrained (locked).<br>
In addition, in the case where the movable plug 6 is connected with the stational receptacle 3 of the switching device C drawn out to the test position, when the locking body 50A is swung in the counterclockwise direction against the spring 9A, the connection holding portion 53A can be moved back from the connected path of the movable plug 6. Therefore, the movable plug 6 can be easily connected with the stational receptacle 3. Here, in the case where the locking body 50A is swung in the counterclockwise direction in FIG. 14 against the spring 9A, since the notched portion 2a is provided to one end of the guiding member 2 and thus the swing constraining portion 54A does not interfere with the guiding member 2, the locking body 50A can be swung as mentioned above.<br>
After connecting the movable plug 6, the locking body 50A is swung by the force of the spring 9A, the lock releasing portion 52A and connection holding portion 53A contact with the front surface of the movable plug 6 so that the swing motion of the locking body 50A due to the spring 9A is constrained, and the lower end of the locking body 50A becomes parallel with the guiding member 2. Therefore, the movement locking portion 51A can be prevented from contacting with the upper guiding piece 21 of the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2, and the switching device C can be moved along the guiding member 2 (connection detected, lock released).<br>
In this case, since the lock releasing portion 52A and the connection holding portion 53A face the front surface of the movable plug 6, the extraction of the movable plug 6 can be prevented, and the connected state between the stational receptacle 3 and the movable plug 6 can be held.<br>
As mentioned above, when the movable plug 6 is connected with the stational receptacle 3, the swing motion of the locking body 50A due to the spring 9A is constrained and thus the lock can be released, so the switching device C can be moved from the test position to the operating position along the guiding member 2. According to the movement of the switching device C, the swing constraining portion 54A is brought into contact with the upper surface of the upper guiding piece 21 of the guiding member 2, and the swing motion of the locking body 50A is constrained by the guiding member 2. Therefore, the connected state between the stational receptacle 3 and the movable plug 6 can be held securely.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
The following will describe Embodiment 3 shown in FIG. 15.<br>
FIG. 15 is a side view showing the switching device according to Embodiment 3 of the present invention where one portion is omitted. In Embodiment 2, the locking body 50A, which is supported to the device main body 4 via the transverse supporting shaft 8A so as to be swingable, is formed by a board member, but in Embodiment 3, a locking body is formed by bending a linear member as shown in FIG. 15. The basic arrangement in Embodiment 3 is the same as that in Embodiments 1 and 2, so the common drawings and detailed description are omitted.<br>
Embodiment 3 shown in FIG. 15 uses one locking body 50B which is supported to the right surface of the device main body 4 via the supporting shaft 8A protruded in the transverse direction so as to be swingable. The locking body 50B is extended in the up-and-down direction, and it includes a first lever portion 55 and a second lever portion 56 positioned in the forward and backward direction of the moving direction, and a coupling lever portion 57 for coupling the upper end of the first lever portion 55 and the lower end of the second lever portion 56. A supporting piece 58 is provided in the halfway portion of the coupling lever portion 57, and the supporting shaft 8A is fitted into the through hole provided into the supporting piece 58, and the spring 9A lies between the coupling lever portion 57 and the device main body 4.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, in the locking body 50B composed of a linear member, a movement locking portion 51B, which can contact<br><br>
with the upper guiding piece 21 of the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2, is provided to the lower end of the first lever portion 55 which is the backward lower side of the moving direction with respect to the center of the swing, and a lock releasing portion 52B and a connection holding portion 53B, which are bent towards the stational receptacle 3 and contact with the front surface of the movable plug 6 connected with the stational receptacle 3 so as to constrain the swing motion of the locking body SOB due to the spring 9A, are provided to the upper end of the second lever portion 56 which is the forward upper side of the moving direction with respect to the center of the swing. Moreover, a swing constraining portion 54B, which can contact with the upper surface of the upper guiding piece 21 of the guiding member 2, is provided to the lower end of the second lever portion 56 which is the forward lower side of the moving direction with respect to the center of the swing.<br>
As for the drawer-type switching device C according to Embodiment 3 having the aforementioned arrangement, in the case where the switching device C is moved to the operating position without connecting the movable plug 6 with the stational receptacle 3 of the switching device C drawn out to the test position along the guiding member 2, the locking body 50B is held in the position shown in FIG. 15 by the spring 9A, namely, in the position where the movement locking portion 51B enters the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2. For this reason, the movement locking portion 51B is brought into contact with the upper guiding piece 21<br>
of the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2 so that the movement of the switching device C is constrained (locked).<br>
In addition, in the case where the movable plug 6 is connected with the stational receptacle 3 of the switching device C drawn out to the test position, when the locking body SOB is swung in the counterclockwise direction against the spring 9A, the connection holding portion 53B can be moved back from the connected path of the movable plug 6. Therefore, the movable plug 6 can be easily connected with the stational receptacle 3. Here, in the case where the locking body SOB is swung in the counterclockwise direction in FIG. 15 against the spring 9A, since the notched portion 2a is provided to one end of the guiding member 2 and thus the swing constraining section 54B does not interfere with the guiding member 2, the locking body SOB can be swung as mentioned above.<br>
After connecting the movable plug 6, the locking body SOB is swung by the force of the spring 9A, the lock releasing portion 52B and connection holding portion 53B contact with the front surface of the movable plug 6 so that the swing motion of the locking body SOB due to the spring 9A is constrained, and the movement locking portion 51B of the locking body SOB is positioned above the guiding member 2. Therefore, the movement locking portion SIB can be prevented from contacting with the upper guiding piece 21 of the notched portion 2a of the guiding member 2, and the switching device C can be moved along the guiding member 2 (connection detected, lock released).<br>
In this case, since the lock releasing portion 52B and the<br>
connection holding portion 53B face the front surface of the movable plug 6, the extraction of the movable plug 6 can be prevented, and the connected state between the stational receptacle 3 and the movable plug 6 can be held.<br>
As mentioned above, when the movable plug 6 is connected with the stational receptacle 3, the swing motion of the locking body SOB due to the spring 9A is constrained and thus the lock can be released, so the switching device C can be moved from the test position to the operating position along the guiding member 2. According to the movement of the switching device C, the swing constraining portion 54B is brought into contact with the upper surface of the upper guiding piece 21 of the guiding member 2, and the swing motion of the locking body SOB is constrained by the guiding member 2. Therefore, the connected state between the stational receptacle 3 and the movable plug 6 can be held securely.<br>
Here, the aforementioned Embodiments 1 to 3 describe the switching device C using the drawer-type breaker, but the switching device C of the present invention may be a switching device such as a disconnecting switch.<br>
As this invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit of essential characteristics thereof, the present Embodiments are therefore illustrative and not restrictive, since the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims rather than by the description preceding them, and all changes that fall within metes and bounds of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds thereof are therefore intended to be embraced by<br>
the claims.<br><br><br>
