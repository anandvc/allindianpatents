BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glucocorticoids (glucocorticosteroids) are a class of steroid hormones<br>
characterized by an ability to bind with the cortisol receptor found in the cells of almost<br>
all vertebrate tissues and trigger similar effects. Glucocorticoids are distinguished from<br>
other steroids such as sex steroids by the specific receptors, target cells, and effects.<br>
Cortisol (or hydrocortisone) is the most important natural human glucocorticoid.<br>
Glucocorticoids have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive<br>
properties. This is particularly evident when they are administered at pharmacologic<br>
doses, but also is important in physiologic immune responses. As a consequence,<br>
glucocorticoids are widely used as drugs to treat inflammatory conditions such as<br>
arthritis or dermatitis, and as adjunctive therapy for conditions such as autoimmune<br>
diseases. On the other hand, excessive glucocorticoid levels, resulting from<br>
administration as a drug or hyperadrenocorticism have side-effects on many systems,<br>
some examples including inhibition of bone formation, suppression of calcium<br>
absorption and delayed wound healing.<br>
A variety of synthetic glucocorticoids, some far more potent than cortisol, have<br>
been developed for therapeutic use. They differ in the pharmacokinetics (absorption<br>
factor, half-life, volume of distribution, clearance) and in pharmacodynamics (for<br>
example the capacity of mineralocorticoid activity: retention of sodium (Na*) and<br>
water).. Because they are absorbed well through the intestines, they are primarily<br>
administered per os (by mouth), but also by other ways like topically on skin.<br>
Methylprednisolone (pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21 -trihydroxy-6-<br>
methyl-,(6a, 11P). C22H3oO5, MW 374.48) is one example of a therapeutically potent<br>
synthetic glucocorticoid drug, which, due to its hydrophobic character, is usually taken<br>
orally. Like most adrenocortical steroids, methylprednisolone is typically used for its<br>
anti-inflammatory properties. However, glucocorticoids have a wide range of effects,<br>
including changes in metabolism and immune responses. Similar to other<br>
corticosteroids, the list of diseases or pathological conditions for which<br>
methlyprednisolone is effective is rather large. Common uses includes arthritis therapy,<br>
and short-term treatment of bronchial inflammation due to various respiratory<br>
diseases.while hightly effective, their systemic application is limited because of a high<br>
incidence of serious adverse effects, especially related to long-term treatment.<br>
Efficacy and safety studies of systemic administration of glucocorticoids,<br>
revealed that in addition to the profound activity of the drug in many different tissues,<br>
these drugs have rapid clearance from plasma thereby requiring high and frequent<br>
dosing to obtain effective amounts at the target site.<br>
Thus, alternative approaches for parenteral administration were investigated. For<br>
example, developing loco-regional administration of glucocorticoids (e.g. by the use of<br>
inhalers in asthma and in intraarticular injection in arthritis) enabled the use of lower<br>
doses of the steroid while achieving sufficient drug levels in a lesion, with minimal side<br>
effects.<br>
A further approach included targeting of the drug to the target tissue by the use<br>
of a suitable carrier, such as liposomes.<br>
First attempts to encapsulate corticosteroids in liposomes were performed by<br>
Fildes FJ et al. [J Pharm. Pharmacol. 30(6):337-42 (1978)] which included steroid<br>
encapsulation in the liposome's lipid bilayer. This approach was based on the<br>
understanding that corticosteroids are hydrophobic in nature. However, such liposomal<br>
formulations turned to be unsuitable for clinical applications.<br>
Efforts were also made in developing "soluble" glucocorticoids. Examples<br>
include succinate derivatized steroids such as hydrocortisone hemisuccinate sodium salt<br>
and Methylprednisolone hemisuccinate sodium salt. Another group of soluble<br>
glucocorticoids include the phosphate derivatives of steroids. While rendering the<br>
steroid water-soluble enabled the use of the acidic steroids for injection, it was shown<br>
that these "pro-drugs" are completely cleared from plasma in less than 6 hours post<br>
injection. [Mishina EV et al Pharm Res 13(1): 141-5 (1996)]<br>
The combination of acidic steroids with liposomes was also investigated.<br>
Schmidt et al. [Schmidt J et al. Brain 126(8):1895-1904 (2003)] describe a formulation<br>
of polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-coated long-circulating sterically stabilized liposomes<br>
encapsulating prednisolone phosphate (one of the water soluble pro-drug steroids) and<br>
its beneficial effect in treating multiple sclerosis as compared to the free form of the<br>
steroid. However, attempts to similarly encapsulate methylprednisolone hemisuccinate<br>
(a weak acid) failed, as it led to an unstable formulation.<br>
Further, encapsulation in liposomes of triamcinolone acetonide phosphate, a<br>
water soluble strong acid derivative of triamcinolone (pKa below 2) was described<br>
[Gonzalez-Rothi, Ricardo J et al. Pharmaceutical Research 13(11): 1699-1703 (1996)].<br>
The liposomal formulation was prepared by passive loading of the acidic corticosteroid<br>
into the liposomes and used as an injectable dosage form (intravenous or intratracheal)<br>
for treating pulmonary conditions. Further, in ex vivo stability studies it was shown that<br>
after 24 hours the liposome retained more than 75% of the acidic corticosteroid.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on the finding that using chemically modified<br>
gluococorticoids (GC), in their amphipathic weak acid form enables the effective<br>
loading in liposomes of the acidic GC. Surprisingly, the thus formed liposomal weakly<br>
acidic GC was stable, i.e. the majority of the substance remained within the liposome as<br>
intact acidic GC after storage for 14 months at 4°C. Once released from the liposome to<br>
water or body fluids the acidic GC was hydrolyzed to obtain the active, non-acidic GC.<br>
Thus, according to a first of its aspects the invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a GC or GC derivative encapsulated in a liposome, wherein<br>
said GC or GC derivative is essentially retained in said liposome for 6 months,<br>
preferably 10 months and more preferably 14 months, the GC or GC derivative being<br>
selected from:<br>
i) an amphipathic weak base GC or GC derivative having a pKa equal or<br>
below 11 and a logD at pH 7 in the range between about -2.5 and about 1.5,<br>
preferably, in the range between about -1.5 and about 1.0;<br>
ii) an amphipathic weak acid GC or GC derivative having a pKa above 3.5<br>
and a logD at pH 7 in the range between about -2.5 and about 1.5,<br>
preferably, in the range between about -1.5 and about 1.0.<br>
The GC derivative is preferably an acidic GC, i.e. an amphipathic weak acid<br>
derivative of GC which is converted to the non-acidic form upon release from the<br>
liposome to bodily fluids. More specifically, the acidic GC is methylprednisolone<br>
sodium hemisuccinate (MPS).<br>
A preferred MPS formulation according to the invention comprises sterically<br>
stabilized liposomes formed from a combination of hydrogenated soybean<br>
phosphatidylcholine (HSPC), (methyl)polyethylene glycol coated distearoyl<br>
phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) and cholesterol at a molar ratio of 55:40:5.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition is preferably utilized for the treatment or<br>
prevention of any disease whose acceptable form of treatment includes administration<br>
of glucocorticoids.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition in accordance with the invention in generally<br>
better than the non-encapsulated GC in at least one of: better delivery to the target site,<br>
better circulation time, slower clearance, reduced side effect, increased efficacy or<br>
increased therapeutic index.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition is preferably utilized for the treatment or<br>
prevention of multiple sclerosis.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition is also preferably utilized for the treatment or<br>
prevention of cancer which are known to be sensitive to steroids, such as cancers of<br>
haematopoeitic origin including lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma, breast cancer and<br>
prostate cancer.<br>
The invention also provides the use of GC or GC derivative for the preparation<br>
of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, the GC or GC derivative being<br>
encapsulated in a liposome, wherein said GC or GC derivative is essentially retained in<br>
said liposome for 6 months, preferably 10 months and more preferably 14 months, the<br>
GC or GC derivative being selected from:<br>
i) an amphipathic weak base GC or GC derivative having a pKa equal or<br>
below 11 and a logD at pH 7 in the range between about -2.5 and about 1.5,<br>
preferably, in the range between about -1.5 and about 1.0;<br>
ii) an amphipathic weak acid GC or GC derivative having a pKa above 3.5<br>
and a logD at pH 7 in the range between about -2.5 and about 1.5,<br>
preferably, in the range between about -1.5 and about 1.0.<br>
Yet further, the invention provides a method for delivery of a glucocorticoid<br>
(GC), preferably a water immiscible GC, to a target site within a body, comprising<br>
chemically modifying said GC to an amphipathic weak acid derivative or amphipathic<br>
weak based derivative thereof as defined in any one of Claims 1 to 14, and loading said<br>
amphipathic weak acid derivative or amphipathic weak base derivative into a liposome.<br>
Specifically, the liposome is a sterically stabilized liposome and the GC derivative is<br>
loaded into the liposome by the formation of an ion or pH gradient across the liposome<br>
membrane (i.e. by active loading techniques).<br>
Yet further, the invention provides a method of the treatment or prevention of a<br>
disease or pathological condition comprising administering to a subject in need an<br>
amount of GC or GC derivative encapsulated in liposomes, the amount being sufficient<br>
to achieve a therapeutic effect.<br>
Preferably, the method comprises injection of the liposomes encapsulating GC<br>
or GC derivative.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a family of hormones that predominantly affects the<br>
metabolism of carbohydrates and, to a lesser extent, fats and proteins (and have other<br>
effects). Glucocorticoids are made in the peripheral part (the cortex) of the adrenal<br>
gland and chemically classed as steroids. Cortisol is the major natural glucocorticoid.<br>
Nonetheless, the term glucocorticoid also applies to equivalent hormones synthesized in<br>
the laboratory.<br>
A non-limiting list of glucocorticoids may be found at the internet site<br>
http://www.steraloids.com/, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Examples<br>
include prednisolone hemisuccinate, methylprednisolone heeimisuccinate,<br>
dexamethasone hemisuccinate, allopregnanolone hemisuccinate; beclomethasone 21-<br>
hemisuccinate; betamethasone 21-hemisuccinate; boldenone hemisuccinate;<br>
prednisolone hemisuccinate, sodium salt; prednisolone 21-hemisuccinate; nandrolone<br>
hemisuccinate; 19-nortestosterone hemisuccinate; deoxycorticosterone 21-<br>
hemisuccinate; dexamethasone hemisuccinate; dexamethasone hemisuccinate :<br>
spermine; corticosterone hemisuccinate; cortexolone hemisuccinate.<br>
Like with many other medicaments, administration of GC in a free form may<br>
posses some disadvantages, such as the risk of exposing the treated individual to side<br>
effects known to occur with GC treatment, rapid clearance of the steroid from the<br>
plasma, etc.<br>
In the search to overcome such disadvantages, the inventors have envisaged that<br>
while it is difficult to efficiently and stably load in a vehicle the rather hydrophobic GC,<br>
by applying a rather simple chemical modification on the glucocorticoid involving the<br>
conversion of the steroid to a water-soluble derivate, it is possible to load the derivate<br>
into liposomes.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides stable pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising a glucocorticoid (GC) or GC derivative encapsulated in a liposome, wherein<br>
said GC or GC derivative is essentially retained in said liposome for 6, preferably 10,<br>
more preferably 14 months (when stored at 4°C), the GC or GC derivative being<br>
selected from:<br>
i) an amphipathic weak base GC or GC derivative having a pKa equal or<br>
above 11 and a logD at pH 7 in the range between about -2.5 and about 1.5,<br>
preferably, in the range between about -1.5 and about 1.0;<br>
ii) an amphipathic weak acid GC or GC derivative having a pKa above 3.5<br>
and a logD at pH 7 in the range between about -2.5 and about 1.5,<br>
preferably, in the range between about -1.5 and about 1.0;.<br>
The term "GC derivative" as used herein denotes a GC molecule which was<br>
chemically modified either by the insertion of a chemical group or by the removal of a<br>
chemical group from the GC molecule, the modification results in the conversion of the<br>
molecule to an amphipathic weak base or amphipathic weak acid, depending on the type<br>
of modification applied. As well appreciated by those versed in the chemistry of<br>
steroids, these hydrophilic in nature molecules posses at least one chemically reactive<br>
group which may be conjugated with a weak acid or weak base to form a respective<br>
amphipathic weak acid or amphipathic weak base molecule. Non-limiting examples of<br>
chemically reactive group typically included in the general structure of steroids are<br>
hydroxyl, carboxyl, and the like, as known to those versed in chemistry. It should be<br>
noted that in the context of the present invention GC derivative may also encompass an<br>
active, non-modified, amphipathic and weakly acid GC.<br>
The GC derivative by one aspect is a pro-drug, i.e. it has no pharmacological<br>
activity in the form it is present in the liposome. Upon release from the liposome the GC<br>
pro-drug in converted by enzymes, such as esterases, to its pharmacologically active<br>
hydrophobic form.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect the GC encapsulated in the liposome, is<br>
already in its pharmaceutically active form, and does not have to undergo any<br>
enzymatic processing in order to become active. In accordance with the second aspect<br>
the GC itself is a weak amphipathic acid or base.<br>
The term "amphipathic weak acid" is used herein to denote a molecule having<br>
both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, the steroid backbone of the GC essentially<br>
constituting the hydrophobic group, while the weak acid moiety linked to the GC by<br>
virtue of the modification described above essentially constituting the hydrophilic<br>
group. The GC amphipathic weak acid or GC derivative is characterized by the<br>
following physical characteristics:<br>
pKa: it has a pKa above 3.0, preferably above 3.5, more preferably, in<br>
the range between about 3.5 and about 6.5;<br>
Partition coefficient: in an n-octanol/buffer (aqueous phase) system<br>
having a pH of 7.0, it has a logD in the range between about -2.5 and about 1.5 and<br>
more preferably between about -1.5 and about 1.0.<br>
Such amphipathic weak acid derivatives of GC may be obtained by reacting the<br>
GC with dicarbocylic or tricarboxylic acids or by linking the GC to the amino group of<br>
the amino acid, by techniques known to those versed in the art.<br>
Specific examples of GC derivates include, without being limited thereto,<br>
betamethasone 21-hemisuccinate prednisolone hemisuccinate sodium salt; prednisolone<br>
21-hemisuccinate; dexamethasone hemisuccinate; dexamethasone<br>
hemisuccinate:spermine; corticosterone hemisuccinate Prednisolone hemisuccinate;<br>
Methylprednisolone heeimisuccinate; Dexamethasone hemisuccinate.<br>
The term "amphipathic weak base" is used herein to denote a molecule having<br>
both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, the steroid backbone of the GC essentially<br>
constituting the hydrophobic group, while the weak base moiety linked to the GC by<br>
virtue of the modification described above essentially constituting the hydrophilic<br>
group. The GC amphipathic weak acid derivative is characterized by the following<br>
physical characteristics:<br>
pKa: it has a pKa below 11.0, more preferably between about 11.0 and<br>
about 7.5;<br>
Partition coefficient: in an n-octanol/buffer (aqueous phase) system it has<br>
a logD in the range between about -2.5 and about 1.5 and more preferably between<br>
about -1.5 and about 1.0.<br>
Such amphipathic weak base derivatives of GC may be obtained by reacting the<br>
GC with basic amino acids, such as arginine or lysine or with any amino acid through<br>
its carboxy group, leaving the amino group free or with polyamine such as spermidine<br>
or spermine.<br>
The term "liposome" is used herein to denote lipid based bilayer vesicles.<br>
Liposomes are widely used as biocompatible carriers of drugs, peptides, proteins,<br>
plasmic DNA, antisense oligonucleotides or ribozymes, for pharmaceutical, cosmetic,<br>
and biochemical purposes. The enormous versatility in particle size and in the physical<br>
parameters of the lipids affords an attractive potential for constructing tailor-made<br>
vehicles for a wide range of applications. Different properties (size, colloidal behavior,<br>
phase transitions, electrical charge and polymorphism) of diverse lipid formulations<br>
(liposomes, lipoplexes, cubic phases, emulsions, micelles and solid lipid nanoparticles)<br>
for distinct applications (e.g. parenteral, transdermal, pulmonary, intranasal and oral<br>
administration) are available and known to those versed in the art. These properties<br>
influence relevant properties of the liposomes, such as liposome stability during storage<br>
and in serum, the bio-distribution and passive or active (specific) targeting of cargo, and<br>
how to trigger drug release and membrane disintegration and/or fusion.<br>
The present invention is applicable for a variety of liposome compositions and<br>
those versed in the art will know how to select the constituents of the liposome<br>
depending on the various considerations including the choice of GC or GC derivative,<br>
the mode of administration of the final liposomal formulation and others.<br>
The liposomes are those composed primarily of liposome-forming lipids which<br>
are amphiphilic molecules essentially characterized by a packing parameter 0.74 - 1.0,<br>
or by a lipid mixture having an additive packing parameter (the sum of the packing<br>
parameters of each component of the liposome times the mole fraction of each<br>
component) in the range between 0.74 and 1.<br>
Liposome-forming lipids, exemplified herein by phospholipids, form into<br>
bilayer vesicles in water. The liposomes can also include other lipids incorporated into<br>
the lipid bilayers, such as phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) and sterol, with their<br>
hydrophobic moiety in contact with the interior, hydrophobic region of the bilayer<br>
membrane, and the head group moiety oriented toward the exterior, polar surface of the<br>
bilayer membrane. The type and level of the additional, non-liposome forming lipid<br>
components will be determined by the additive packing parameter of the entire<br>
components of the lipid bilayer to remain in the range of 0.74-1.0.<br>
The liposome-forming lipids are preferably those having a glycerol backbone<br>
wherein at least one, preferably two, of the hydroxyl groups at the head group is<br>
substituted with, preferably an acyl chain (to form an acyl or diacyl derivative),<br>
however, may also be substituted with an alkyl or alkenyl chain, a phosphate group or a<br>
combination or derivatives of same and may contain a chemically reactive group, (such<br>
as an amine, acid, ester, aldehyde or alcohol) at the headgroup, thereby providing a<br>
polar head group. Sphyngolipids, such as sphyngomyelins, are good alternative to<br>
glycerophophol ipids.<br>
Typically, the substituting chain(s), e.g. the acyl, alkyl or alkenyl chain is<br>
between 14 to about 24 carbon atoms in length, and has varying degrees of saturation<br>
being fully, partially or non-hydrogenated lipids. Further, the lipid may be of natural<br>
source, semi-synthetic or fully synthetic lipid, and neutral, negatively or positively<br>
charged. There are a variety of synthetic vesicle-forming lipids and naturally-occurring<br>
vesicle-forming lipids, including the phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC),<br>
phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol<br>
(DMPG); egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EPC), l-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidyl<br>
choline (POPC), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dimyristoyl<br>
phosphatidylcholine (DMPC); phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS) 1-<br>
palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidyl choline (POPC), and the sphingophospholipids such as<br>
sphingomyelins (SM) having 12-24 carbon atom acyl or alkyl chains. The abovedescribed<br>
lipids and phospholipids whose hydrocarbon chain (acyl/alkyl/alkenyl chains)<br>
have varying degrees of saturation can be obtained commercially or prepared according<br>
to published methods. Other suitable lipids include in the liposomes are<br>
glyceroglycolipids and sphingoglycolipids and sterols (such as cholesterol or plant<br>
sterol).<br>
Preferably, the phospholipid is egg phophatidylcholine (EPC), l-palmitoyl-2-<br>
oleoylphosphatidyl choline (POPC), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) or<br>
hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC).<br>
Cationic lipids (mono and polycationic) are also suitable for use in the<br>
liposomes of the invention, where the cationic lipid can be included as a minor<br>
component of the lipid composition or as a major or sole component. Such cationic<br>
lipids typically have a lipophilic moiety, such as a sterol, an acyl or diacyl chain, and<br>
where the lipid has an overall net positive charge. Preferably, the head group of the lipid<br>
carries the positive charge. Monocationic lipids may include, for example, 1,2-<br>
dimyristoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DMTAP) l,2-dioleyloxy-3-<br>
(trimethylamino) propane (DOTAP); N-[l-(2,3,- ditetradecyloxy)propyl]-N,N-dimethyl-<br>
N-hydroxyethylammonium bromide (DMRIE); N-[l-(2,3,-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,Ndimethyl-<br>
N-hydroxy ethyl- ammonium bromide (DORIE); N-[l-(2,3-dioleyloxy)<br>
propyl]-N,N,N- trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA); 3(3[N-(N',N'-<br>
dimethylaminoethane) carbamoly] cholesterol (DC-Choi); and<br>
dimethyl-dioctadecylammonium (DDAB).<br>
Examples of polycationic lipids include a similar lipophilic moiety as with the<br>
mono cationic lipids, to which polycationic moiety is attached. Exemplary polycationic<br>
moieties include spermine or spermidine (as exemplified by DOSPA and DOSPER), or<br>
a peptide, such as polylysine or other polyamine lipids. For example, the neutral lipid<br>
(DOPE) can be derivatized with polylysine to form a cationic lipid. polycationic lipids<br>
include, without being limited thereto, N-[2-[[2,5-bis[3-aminopropyl)amino]-loxopentyl]<br>
amino]ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-2,3-bis[(l -oxo-9-octadecenyl)oxy]-1 -<br>
propanaminium (DOSPA), and ceramide carbamoyl spermine (CCS).<br>
The lipids mixture forming the liposome can be selected to achieve a specified<br>
degree of fluidity or rigidity, to control the stability of the liposome in serum and to<br>
control the rate of release of the entrapped agent in the liposome.<br>
Further, the liposomes may also include a lipid derivatized with a hydrophilic<br>
polymer to form new entities known by the term lipopolymers. Lipopolymers preferably<br>
comprise lipids modified at their head group with a polymer having a molecular weight<br>
equal or above 750Da. The head group may be polar or apolar, however, is preferably a<br>
polar head group to which a large (&gt;750Da) highly hydrated (at least 60 molecules of<br>
water per head group) flexible polymer is attached. The attachment of the hydrophilic<br>
polymer head group to the lipid region may be a covalent or non-covalent attachment,<br>
however, is preferably via the formation of a covalent bond (optionally via a linker).<br>
The outermost surface coating of hydrophilic polymer chains is effective to provide a<br>
liposome with a long blood circulation lifetime in vivo. The lipopolymer may be<br>
introduced into the liposome by two different ways: (a) either by adding the<br>
lipopolymer to a lipid mixture forming the liposome. The lipopolymer will be<br>
incorporated and exposed at the inner and outer leaflets of the liposome bilayer [Uster<br>
P.S. et al. FEBBS Letters 386:243 (1996)]; (b) or by firstly prepare the liposome and<br>
then incorporate the lipopolymers to the external leaflet of the pre-formed liposome<br>
either by incubation at temperature above the Tm of the lipopolymer and liposomeforming<br>
lipids, or by short term exposure to microwave irradiation.<br>
Preparation of vesicles composed of liposome-forming lipids and derivati/ation<br>
of such lipids with hydrophilic polymers (thereby forming lipopolymers) has been<br>
described, for example by Tirosh et al. [Tirosh et al., Biopys. J., 74(3):1371-1379,<br>
(1998)] and in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,013,556; 5,395,619; 5,817,856; 6,043,094, 6,165,501,<br>
incorporated herein by reference and in WO 98/07409. The lipopolymers may be nonionic<br>
lipopolymers (also referred to at times as neutral lipopolymers or uncharged<br>
lipopolymers) or lipopolymers having a net negative or a net positive charge.<br>
There are numerous polymers which may be attached to lipids. Polymers<br>
typically used as lipid modifiers include, without being limited thereto: polyethylene<br>
glycol (PEG), polysialic acid, polylactic (also termed polylactide), polyglycolic acid<br>
(also termed polyglycolide), apolylactic-polyglycolic acid, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, polymethoxazoline, polyethyloxazoline,<br>
polyhydroxyethyloxazoline, polyhydroxypropyloxazoline, polyaspartamide,<br>
polyhydroxypropyl methacrylamide, polymethacrylamide, polydimethylacrylamide,<br>
polyvinylmethylether, polyhydroxyethyl acrylate, derivatized celluloses such as<br>
hydroxymethylcellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose. The polymers may be employed as<br>
homopolymers or as block or random copolymers.<br>
While the lipids derivatized into lipopolymers may be neutral, negatively<br>
charged, as well as positively charged, i.e. there is no restriction to a specific (or no)<br>
charge, the most commonly used and commercially available lipids derivatized into<br>
lipopolymers are those based on phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), usually,<br>
distearylphosphatidylethanolamine(DSPE).<br>
A specific family of lipopolymers employed by the invention include<br>
monomethylated PEG attached to DSPE (with different lengths of PEG chains, the<br>
methylated PEG referred to herein by the abbreviation PEG) in which the PEG polymer<br>
is linked to the lipid via a carbamate linkage resulting in a negatively charged<br>
lipopolymer. Other lipopolymer are the neutral methyl polyethyleneglycol<br>
distearoylglycerol (mPEG-DSG) and the neutral methyl polyethyleneglycol<br>
oxycarbonyl-3-amino-l,2-propanediol distearoylester (mPEG-DS) [Garbuzenko O. et<br>
al., Langmuir. 21:2560-2568 (2005)]. The PEG moiety preferably has a molecular<br>
weight of the head group is from about 750Da to about 20,000 Da. More preferably, the<br>
molecular weight is from about 750 Da to about 12,000 Da and most preferably<br>
between about 1,000 Da to about 5,000 Da. One specific PEG-DSPE employed herein<br>
is that wherein PEG has a molecular weight of 2000Da, designated herein 2000PEGDSPE<br>
or 2kPEG-DSPE.<br>
Preparation of liposomes including such derivatized lipids has also been<br>
described, where typically, between 1-20 mole percent of such a derivatized lipid is<br>
included in the liposome formulation.<br>
It is well established that preparation of liposomal formulation involve the<br>
selection of an appropriate lipid composition in addition to the aqueous phase<br>
ingredients, such as buffers, antioxidants, metal chelators, and cryoprotectants. Chargeinducing<br>
lipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol can be incorporated into the liposome<br>
bilayer to decrease vesicle-vesicle fusion, and to increase interaction with cells, while<br>
cholesterol and sphingomyelin can be included in formulations in order to decrease<br>
permeability and leakage of encapsulated drugs. Buffers at neutral pH can decrease<br>
hydrolysis. Addition of an antioxidant, such as sodium ascorbate can decrease<br>
oxidation, etc.<br>
Variations in ratios between these liposome constituents, dictates the<br>
pharmacological properties of the liposome, including stability of the liposomes, which<br>
is a major concern for various types of vesicular applications. Evidently, the stability of<br>
liposomes should meet the same standards as conventional Pharmaceuticals. Chemical<br>
stability involves prevention of both the hydrolysis of ester bonds in the phospholipid<br>
bilayer and the oxidation of unsaturated sites in the lipid chain. Chemical instability can<br>
lead to physical instability or leakage of encapsulated drug from the bilayer and fusion<br>
and aggregation of vesicles. Chemical instability also results in short blood circulation<br>
time of the liposome, which affects the effective access to and interaction with the<br>
target.<br>
A preferred formulation according to the invention is that comprising<br>
phosphatidylcholine (PC) such as egg PC (EPC) or hydrogenated soy PC (HSPC) as a<br>
the liposome forming lipid, PEGylated (2000Da) distearoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine<br>
(PEG-DSPE) and cholesterol. Evidently, other lipids mixtures may be utilized in the<br>
same, similar or different mole ratio, and provided that the final additive packing<br>
parameter of the different constituents of the liposome is in the range of between about<br>
0.74 and 1.0.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulation of the invention was proven to be highly stable.<br>
An exemplified embodiment of the invention in which the GC derivative,<br>
Methylprednisolone succinate (methylprednisolone modified with succinic acid) was<br>
encapsulated in a liposome comprising the above three constituents, was shown to have<br>
only marginal reduction (less than 20% from initial concentration) in the GC derivative<br>
after storage at 4°C for 14 months (Figs. 3A-3B).<br>
Thus, in the context of the present invention, the term "stability" denotes a<br>
formulation which under conventional storage conditions (4°C) retains the majority<br>
(more than 80%, preferably more than 90%) of the GC/GC derivative in the liposome,<br>
for 6 months, preferably for 10 months and more preferably for 14 months.<br>
Accordingly, the term "essentially retains" used herein denotes that 80% and preferably<br>
90% of the GC or GC derivative is retained in the liposomes under storage conditions<br>
for about 6, preferably 10 and more preferably 14 months. According to one preferred<br>
embodiment, stability of the liposomes is maintained by the use of sterically stabilized<br>
liposome (SSL), i.e. liposomes coated with a hydrophilic component. According to a<br>
preferred embodiment, the SSL comprises a combination of hydrogenated soy<br>
phosphatidylcholine (HSPC), 2000PEG-DSPE and cholesterol at a molar ratio of 55:40:5.<br>
In general, there are a variety of drug-loading methods available for preparing<br>
liposomes with entrapped drug, including passive entrapment and active remote<br>
loading. The passive entrapment method is most suited for entrapping of lipophilic<br>
drugs in the liposome membrane and for entrapping drugs having high water solubility.<br>
In the case of ionizable hydrophilic or amphipathic drugs, even greater drug-loading<br>
efficiency can be achieved by loading the drug into liposomes against a transmembrane<br>
ion gradient [Nichols, J.W., et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 455:269-271 (1976);<br>
Cramer, J., et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 75(2):295-<br>
301 (1977)]. This loading method, generally referred to as remote loading, typically<br>
involves a drug which is amphipathic in nature and has an ionizable group which is<br>
loaded by adding it to a suspension of liposomes having a higher inside/lower outside<br>
H+ and/or ion gradient.<br>
The liposomes employed in the context of the present invention are preferably<br>
loaded by the remote loading principle. The resulting formulation exhibited a<br>
significantly high GC derivative to lipid ratio. Preferably, the mole ratio between the<br>
GC derivative and lipid is between 0.01 and 2.0, more preferably, between 0.04 and<br>
0.25. For high loading of the GC derivative it is at times preferable that the<br>
concentration of the same in the liposome be such that it precipitates in the presence of<br>
a pre-entrapped counter ion.<br>
Liposomes having an H+ and/or ion gradient across the liposome bilayer for use<br>
in remote loading can be prepared by a variety of techniques. A typical procedure<br>
comprises dissolving a mixture of lipids at a ratio that forms stable liposomes in a<br>
suitable organic solvent and evaporated in a vessel to form a thin lipid film. The film is<br>
then covered with an aqueous medium containing the solute species that will form the<br>
aqueous phase in the liposome interior space. After liposome formation, the vesicles<br>
may be sized to achieve a size distribution of liposomes within a selected range,<br>
according to known methods. The liposomes utilized in the present invention are<br>
preferably uniformly sized to a selected size range between 70-100nm, preferably about<br>
80nm.<br>
After sizing, the external medium of the liposomes is treated to produce an ion<br>
gradient across the liposome membrane (typically with the same buffer used to form the<br>
liposomes), which is typically a higher inside/lower outside ion concentration gradient.<br>
This may be done in a variety of ways, e.g., by (i) diluting the external medium, (ii)<br>
dialysis against the desired final medium, (iii) gel exclusion chromatography, e.g., using<br>
Sephadex G-50, equilibrated in the desired medium which is used for elution, or (iv)<br>
repeated high-speed centrifugation and resuspension of pelleted liposomes in the<br>
desired final medium. The external medium which is selected will depend on the type of<br>
gradient, on the mechanism of gradient formation and the external solute and pH<br>
desired, as will now be described.<br>
In the simplest approach for generating an ion and/or H+ gradient, the lipids are<br>
hydrated and sized in a medium having a selected internal-medium pH. The suspension<br>
of the liposomes is titrated until the external liposome mixture reaches the desired final<br>
pH, or treated as above to exchange the external phase buffer with one having the<br>
desired external pH. For example, the original hydration medium may have a pH of 5.5,<br>
in a selected buffer, e.g., glutamate, citrate, succinate, fumarate buffer, and the final<br>
external medium may have a pH of 8.5 in the same or different buffer. The common<br>
characteristic of these buffers is that they are formed from acids which are essentially<br>
liposome impermeable. The internal and external media are preferably selected to<br>
contain about the same osmolarity, e.g., by suitable adjustment of the concentration of<br>
buffer, salt, or low molecular weight non-electrolyte solute, such as dextrose or sucrose.<br>
18<br>
In another general approach, the gradient is produced by including in the<br>
liposomes, a selected ionophore. To illustrate, liposomes prepared to contain<br>
valinomycin in the liposome bilayer are prepared in a potassium buffer, sized, then the<br>
external medium exchanged with a sodium buffer, creating a potassium inside/sodium<br>
outside gradient. Movement of potassium ions in an inside-to-outside direction in turn<br>
generates a lower inside/higher outside pH gradient, presumably due to movement of<br>
protons into the liposomes in response to the net electronegative charge across the<br>
liposome membranes [Deamer, D. W., et al., Biochim. et Biophys. Acta 274:323<br>
(1972)].<br>
A similar approach is to hydrate the lipid and to size the formed multilamellar<br>
liposome in high concentration of magnesium sulfate. The magnesium sulfate gradient<br>
is created by dialysis against 20mM HEPPES buffer, pH 7.4 in sucrose. Then, the<br>
A23187 ionophore is added, resulting in outwards transport of the magnesium ion in<br>
exchange for two protons for each magnesium ion, plus establishing a inner liposome<br>
high/outer liposome low proton gradient [Senske DB et al. (Biochim. Biophys. Acta<br>
1414: 188-204(1998)].<br>
In another more preferred approach, the proton gradient used for drug loading is<br>
produced by creating an ammonium ion gradient across the liposome membrane, as<br>
described, for example, in US Patent Nos. 5,192,549 and 5,316,771, incorporated herein<br>
by reference. The liposomes are prepared in an aqueous buffer containing an ammonium<br>
salt, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium citrate, etc., typically<br>
0.1 to 0.3 M ammonium salt, at a suitable pH, e.g., 5.5 to 7.5. The gradient can also be<br>
produced by including in the hydration medium sulfated polymers, such as dextran<br>
sulfate ammonium salt, heparin sulfate ammonium salt or sucralfate. After liposome<br>
formation and sizing, the external medium is exchanged for one lacking ammonium<br>
ions. In this approach, during the loading the amphipathic weak base is exchanged with<br>
the ammonium ion.<br>
Yet, another approach is described in US 5,939,096, incorporated herein by<br>
reference. In brief, the method employs a proton shuttle mechanism involving the salt of<br>
a weak acid, such as acetic acid, of which the protonated form trans-locates across the<br>
liposome membrane to generate a higher inside/lower outside pH gradient. An<br>
amphipathic weak acid compound is then added to the medium to the pre-formed<br>
liposomes. This amphipathic weak acid accumulates in liposomes in response to this<br>
gradient, and may be retained in the liposomes by cation (i.e. calcium ions)-promoted<br>
precipitation or low permeability across the liposome membrane, namely, the<br>
amphipathic weak acid is exchanges with the acetic acid.<br>
The liposomes loaded with the GC or GC derivative may be administered in<br>
various ways. It may be formulated in combination with physiologically acceptable<br>
excipients, as known in the art. The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients employed<br>
according to the invention generally include inert, non-toxic substances which<br>
preferably do not react with liposomes. The excipients may be any of those<br>
conventionally used and is limited only by chemical-physical considerations, such as<br>
solubility and lack of reactivity with liposomes, and by the route of administration. The<br>
excipients may also at times have the effect of the improving the delivery or penetration<br>
of the liposomal formulation to a target tissue, for improving the stability of the<br>
liposomal formulation, for slowing clearance rates, for imparting slow release<br>
properties, for reducing undesired side effects etc. The excipient may also be a<br>
substance that stabilizes the formulation (e. g. a preservative), for providing the<br>
formulation with an edible flavor, etc. The excipient may include additives, colorants,<br>
diluents, buffering agents, disintegrating agents, moistening agents, preservatives,<br>
flavoring agents, and pharmacologically compatible carriers. As an example, when<br>
treating a neurodegenerative condition, the excipient may be a molecule which is known<br>
to promote or facilitate entry through the blood brain barrier (BBB) such as transferin<br>
receptor-binding agents, antibodies, or any drug that by itself transfers through the<br>
BBB.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may have an advantage for the<br>
treatment of a variety of conditions typically those are the conditions which are known<br>
to be treated (in at lease a phase of their course by the administration of GC. Examples<br>
of such conditions include neurodegenerative conditions and cancer, as detailed<br>
hereinafter. To this end, the liposomal formulation of the invention may comprise one<br>
or more active ingredients, in addition to the GC or GC derivative. The additional active<br>
ingredients may be in a free form or also encapsulated in liposomes (together or<br>
separated from the liposomes containing the GC derivative). For example, when treating<br>
cancer, the additional active ingredient may be a cytotoxic drug, such as doxorubicin,<br>
encapsulated in the same or different liposomes. For treating a neurodegenerative<br>
condition, the liposomal formulation may be combined with Copaxone or Betaferone.<br>
The following is a non-limiting list of medical conditions which may be treated<br>
or prevented with the liposomal formulation of the invention additional conditions,<br>
which are known to benefit from GC treatment, are also included in the scope of the<br>
invention:<br>

sclerosis (MS).<br>
As well as other conditions, such as tuberculous meningitis with sub-arachnoid<br>
block or impending block when used concurrently with appropriate antituberculous<br>
chemotherapy; Trichinosis with neurological or myocardial involvement.<br>
Thus, the invention also pertains to a method of treatment or prevention of a<br>
disease or pathological condition, the method comprises providing a subject in need of<br>
said treatment an amount of the liposomal formulation of the invention, the amount<br>
being effective (hereinafter the "effective amount") to treat or prevent the disease or<br>
pathological condition. Preferred conditions to be treated by the present invention are<br>
cancer and neurodegenerative conditions.<br>
The term "treatment" as used herein denotes the administering of a an amount of<br>
the GC or GC derivative encapsulated in a liposome effective to ameliorate undesired<br>
symptoms associated with a disease, to prevent the manifestation of such symptoms<br>
before they occur, to slow down the progression of the disease, slow down the<br>
deterioration of symptoms associated with the disease, to enhance an onset of a<br>
remission period of a disease, to slow down any irreversible damage caused in a<br>
progressive chronic stage of a disease, to delay the onset of said progressive stage, to<br>
lessen the severity or cure a disease, to improve survival rate or more rapid recovery<br>
from a disease, to prevent a disease form occurring, or a combination of two or more of<br>
the above.<br>
As an example, when referring to neurodegenerative conditions, treatment<br>
denotes inhibition or slowing down of abnormal deterioration of the nervous system as<br>
well as prevention in subjects with high disposition of developing a neurodegenerative<br>
condition (as determined by considerations known to those versed in medicine) or for<br>
preventing the re-occurrence of an acute stage of a neurodegenerative condition in a<br>
chronically ill subjects. In the latter case, the pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
the liposomal GC derivative may be administered to a subject who does not have a<br>
neurodegenerative condition but is at high-risk of developing such a condition, e.g. as a<br>
result of exposure to an agent which is known to cause abnormal generation of reactive<br>
oxidative species or subjects with family history of the disease (i.e. genetic disposition).<br>
Further, as an example, when the disease is cancer, treatment denotes, inter alia,<br>
inhibition or reduction of the growth and proliferation of tumor cells: including<br>
arresting growth of the primary tumor, or decreasing the rate of cancer related mortality,<br>
or delaying cancer related mortality, which may result in the reduction of tumor size or<br>
total elimination thereof from the individual's body, or decreasing the rate of occurrence<br>
of metastatic tumors, or decreasing the number of metastatic tumors appearing in an<br>
individual.<br>
The liposomal GC derivative may be provided as a single dose, however is<br>
preferably administered to a subject in need of treatment over an extended period or<br>
time (e.g. to produce a cumulative effective amount) in a single daily dose, in several<br>
doses a day, as a single dose for several days, etc. The treatment regimen and the<br>
specific formulation to be administered will depend on the type of disease to be treated<br>
and may be determined by various considerations, known to those skilled in the art of<br>
medicine, e. g. the physicians.<br>
The term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" is used<br>
herein to denote the amount of the GC derivative when loaded in the liposome in a<br>
given therapeutic regimen which is sufficient to achieve a desired effect, e.g. inhibition<br>
or reduction of the growth and proliferation of tumor cells, or inhibition or reduction of<br>
degradation of nerve cells and thereby the deterioration of the nervous system. The<br>
amount is determined by such considerations as may be known in the art and depends<br>
on the type and severity of the condition to be treated and the treatment regime. The<br>
effective amount is typically determined in appropriately designed clinical trials (dose<br>
range studies) and the person versed in the art will know how to properly conduct such<br>
trials in order to determine the effective amount. As generally known, an effective<br>
amount depends on a variety of factors including the mode of administration, type of<br>
vehicle carrying the amphipathic weak acid/base, the reactivity of the GC derivative, the<br>
liposome's distribution profile within the body, a variety of pharmacological parameters<br>
such as half life in the body after being released from the liposome, on undesired side<br>
effects, if any, on factors such as age and gender of the treated subject, etc.<br>
The term "administering" is used to denote the contacting or dispensing,<br>
delivering or applying the Hposomal formulation, to a subject by any suitable route for<br>
delivery thereof to the desired location in the subject, these include oral, parenteral<br>
(including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneally)<br>
and intranasal administration as well as by as well as intrathecal and infusion<br>
techniques.<br>
According to one embodiment, the formulations used in accordance with the<br>
invention are in a form suitable for injection. The requirements for effective<br>
pharmaceutical vehicles for injectable formulations are well known to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art [See Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, J.B. Lippincott Co.,<br>
Philadelphia, Pa., Banker and Chalmers, eds., pages 238-250 (1982), and ASHP<br>
Handbook on Injectable Drugs, Toissel, 4th ed., pages 622-630 (1986)].<br>
It is noted that humans are treated generally longer than experimental animals as<br>
exemplified herein, which treatment has a length proportional to the length of the<br>
disease process and active agent effectiveness. The doses may be a single dose or<br>
multiple doses given over a period of several days.<br>
While the following disclosure provides experimental data with animal model,<br>
there are a variety of acceptable approaches for converting doses from animal models to<br>
humans. For example, calculation of approximate body surface area (BSA) approach<br>
makes use of a simple allometric relationship based on body weight (BW) such that<br>
BSA is equal to body weight (BW) to the 0.67 power [Freireich E.J. et.al. Cancer<br>
Chemother. Reports 1966, 50(4) 219-244; and as analyzed in Dosage Regimen Design<br>
for Pharmaceutical Studies Conducted in Animals, by Mordenti, J, in J. Pharm. Sci.,<br>
75:852-57, 1986]. Further, allometry and tables of BSA data have been established<br>
[Extrapolation of Toxicological and Pharmacological Data from Animals to Humans, by<br>
Chappell W &amp; Mordenti J, Advances in Drug Research, Vol. 20, 1- 116, 1991<br>
(published by Academic Press Ltd)]<br>
Another approach for converting doses is a pharmacokinetic-based approach<br>
using the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) or Physiologically Based<br>
PharmacoKinetic (PBPK) methods are described [Voisin E.M. et al. Regul Toxicol<br>
Pharmacol. 12(2): 107-116. (1990)].<br>
The invention will now be described by way of non-limiting examples showing<br>
the effect of SSL-MPS on EAE and lymphoma cells.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EXAMPLES<br>
General<br>
Materials<br>
Hydrogenated soybean phosphatidylcholine (HSPC) was obtained from Lipoid<br>
KG (Ludwigshafen, Germany).<br>
N-carbamyl-poly-(ethylene glycol methyl ether)-l,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-<br>
phosphoethanolamine triethyl ammonium salt (PEG-DSPE) (the polyethylene moiety of<br>
this phospholipid having a molecular mass of 2000 Da) was obtained from Genzyme<br>
Liestale, Switzerland-<br>
Cholesterol (&gt;99% pure) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).<br>
[3H] Cholesteryl hexadecyl ether (45 Ci per mmol) was from NEN Life Science<br>
Products (Boston, MA, USA). tert-Butanol (99% pure) was purchased from BDH,<br>
Poole, UK.<br>
The weak acid steroids, the pro-drugs methylprednisolone sodium hemisuccinate<br>
(MPS) and hydrocortisone sodium hemisuccinate (HYD), were obtained from Pfeizer,<br>
Belgium<br>
-25-<br>
All the other chemicals, including buffers were of analytical grade or better, and<br>
were obtained from Sigma. Purified water was obtained from WaterPro PS<br>
HPLC/Ultrafilter Hybrid model, (Labconco, Kansas City, Mo., USA).<br>
Methods<br>
Liposome preparation<br>
A stock solution HSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-DSPE-2000 at molar ratio of 55:40:5<br>
was dissolved in ethanol at 70°C to a final gel lipid concentration of 62.5% (w/v). The<br>
solution was then incubated at 70°C until all the lipids are dissolved to a clear solution.<br>
The stock solution was then added to a solution of calcium acetate 200 mM at 70°C to<br>
receive 10% lipid concentration (w/v) hence reaching a final ethanol concentration of<br>
16% (w/v). The mixture was constantly stirred at 70°C to receive a milky dispersion at<br>
this stage lipids were hydrated to form multi lamellar liposome (MLV) dispersion.<br>
The vesicles that were formed were downsized using extrusion through a<br>
polycarbonate filter of defined pore size starting with 400-nm and ending with 50-nm<br>
pore size filters, as the last extrusion step under low to medium pressure. This processes<br>
results in 80 ±15-nm liposomes. The extrusion device (Northern Lipids, Canada) was<br>
kept in a constant temperature of 70°C during the entire procedure.<br>
The removal of extraliposomal Ca acetate to create the Ca acetate gradient {[Ca<br>
acetate] in liposome»[Ca acetate] in medium} was created by dialysis against<br>
dextrose 5% or saline 0.9 at 4°C (4 exchanges x 100 volume each, the final one over<br>
night).<br>
Liposome phospholipids concentration was determined from organic phosphorus<br>
concentration by a modified Bartlet procedure [Shmeeda, H., et al. In: Methods in<br>
Enzymology "Liposomes", (DUzgUnes, N., ed.), 367:272-292 (2003)]. Lipid<br>
concentration in the resulting liposome stock solution was ~40 mM.<br>
The amount of calcium inside the liposomes was determined by the use of<br>
atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS).<br>
Preparation and characterization of radioactive-SSL<br>
[3H] cholesteryl ether-labeled sterically stabilized liposomes (SSL) composed of<br>
HSPC:Chol:2000PEG-DSPE (55:40:5 mole ratio), and a trace amount of [3H] cholesteryl<br>
hexadecyl ether (0.125 jiCi/umol PL) were prepared as described above. The liposome<br>
size was determined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) to be 87±15nm.<br>
Loading ofGC derivative into liposomes<br>
A stock solution of methylprednisolone hemi succinate sodium salt (MPS, the<br>
GC derivative) was dissolved in 5% dextrose (pH 7.2) to a concentration of ~9 mg/ml<br>
and added to the preformed SSL dispersion after the calcium acetate gradient was<br>
established. MPS concentration was ~9 mg/ml and phospholipid -32 mM phosphate.<br>
Loading was achieved by incubation of the components above for the desired<br>
time at 62°C (above matrix lipid Tm). Liposomes were then cooled to 4°C and dialyzed<br>
against 5% dextrose at 4°C to remove acetate released during loading and to remove<br>
unloaded drug or alternatively unloaded drug was removed by the ion exchanger Dowex<br>
1x400 mesh (Cl" form).<br>
State of aggregation, partition coefficient and surface tension of MPS<br>
\. State of aggregation of MPS<br>
Aggregation of MPS was determined from the change in turbidity measured as<br>
intensity of light scattered at 90° to excitation beam using a spectrofluormeter under<br>
conditions that MPS lack absorbance (excitation and emission at the same wavelength<br>
Ex= 600nm Em= 600nm). There is a large increase in the light scattered by MPS<br>
solution/dispersion due to formation of aggregates.<br>
The intensity of scattered light (at 90°to the excitation), also defined as turbidity<br>
is proportional to concentration and to the size of the aggregates. [Zuidam, N.J. and<br>
Barenholz, Y., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1368:115-128 (1998)]. The state of aggregation<br>
of MPS was tested in the following manner: To quartz cuvette MPS (2ml) at<br>
concentration of ~6.5mg/ml MPS was added. The solution was tittered with HC1<br>
(1.756M) and light scattering using excitation and emission at (both at 600nm with<br>
attenuation of 1%) and pH of the solution was monitored.<br>
2. Partition coefficient<br>
Partition coefficient (logD) of some GC derivatives (which are amphipathic<br>
weak acids) was determined by the 'shake flask1 as described [Samuni, A.M. and<br>
Barenholz, Y., Free Radicals Biol. Med. 22:1165-1174 (1997)].<br>
3. Surface Tension<br>
Surface tension was measured using utrouge S (Kibron Inc., Helsinki Finland).<br>
A solution containing GC derivative (SOOuJL) was placed in the well after calibration<br>
and zeroing of the sensor using pure water and air. The measurement was performed at<br>
26°C.<br>
Precipitation ofMPS inside SSL<br>
MPS precipitation inside the intraliposomal aqueous phase of the vesicle was<br>
visualized using Cryo TEM as described [Lasic, D.D., Frederik, P.M., Stuart, M.C.A.,<br>
Barenholz, Y. and Mclntosh, T.J., Gelation of liposome interior. A novel method for<br>
drug encapsulation. FEES Lett. 312, 255-258 (1992); Lasic, D.D., et al. Biochim.<br>
Biophys. Acta 1239, 145-156 (1995)].<br>
Precipitation studies<br>
To 600 mOsm Ca-acetate solution at 63° C and at different pH points MPS was<br>
added at final concentration of 5mg/ml, then mixed solution was incubated for 40<br>
minutes after which the solution was centrifuged and the supernatant was analyzed<br>
using HPLC.<br>
Loading efficiency<br>
Loading efficiency is the ratio between MPS/ phospholipid concentrations after<br>
and before loading. The quantification of MPS was done in an HPLC apparatus as<br>
described by Anderson, and Taphouse 1981 [Anderson B.D. and Taphouse. V. J Pharm<br>
Sci, 70:181-6 (1981)] quantification of phospholipid was done by modified Bartlet<br>
procedure [Shmeeda, H., et al. In: Methods in Enzymology "Liposomes", (Duzgunes,<br>
N., ed.), 367:272-292 (2003)].<br>
Stability determination<br>
Determination of MPS release from liposome<br>
The level of MPS released from SSL-MPS was determined by first separating<br>
the liposomes from free MPS using gel exclusion chromatography on Sepharose crosslinked<br>
CL-4B column using. Liposomes were eluted at the void volume and the free<br>
MPS at the later eluted fractions (Fig. 3A-3B).<br>
Stability upon storage at 4°C and kinetic of release at 37°C in 80% plasma was<br>
determined by gel exclusion chromatography described above. Then the different<br>
column fractions were analyzed as described above, for MPS, phospholipids and Ca in<br>
the void volume fraction.<br>
In addition, SSL-MPS were incubated with 80% human inflamed synovial fluid<br>
at a ratio of 80% plasma at 37°C. Then at different time points sample were vortexed<br>
with the anion exchange resin, DOWEX 1x400 mesh (Cl" form), which bind only free<br>
MPS. The samples were analyzed for liposome encapsulated MPS and liposome<br>
phospholipid content.<br>

Turbidity, Partition coefficient and Surface Tension ofMPS<br>
The turbidity (indicating the aggregation) of MPS was determined. The results<br>
shown in Fig. 1A indicate that at pH 7.2 the amphipathic weak acid derivative (the prodrug)<br>
is non-aggregated water soluble and in acidic pH, it aggregates, therefore showing<br>
increase in turbidity. The decline in turbidity observed at very low pH, was due to the<br>
formation of very large aggregates which precipitated. The doted arrow indicates the<br>
point of transition from titration with HC1 (^mol of H*, left side of arrow) to titration<br>
with NaOH (jamol of OH", right side of arrow).<br>
Partition coefficient of MPS was determined at different pH points. As shown in<br>
Fig. IB, MPS is indeed an amphipathic substance.<br>
Further, the surface tension of MPS was determined and as evident from<br>
Fig. 3C, MPS is surface active at all concentrations used (0.785 - 30mM) and has a<br>
CAC (critical association/aggregation concentration) point at ~5mM while GC that has<br>
a phosphate group (a strong acidic group) such as dexamethasone phosphate was not<br>
surface active at least up to concentration of 50 mM and did not self associate to form<br>
micelles and/or other organized assemblies.<br>
Precipitation of MPS by Calcium ion<br>
The precipitation of MPS in the presence of calcium acetate solution was<br>
determined as described above. Table 2 shows the percent of MPS that precipitated in<br>
the presence of calcium ions, i.e. at different pH. As shown, precipitation already<br>
occurred at pH 6.8. Precipitation was increased to a very large extent (97% of the MPS)<br>
at pH around the pKa of GC (pH 4.5).<br>
General Loading efficiency for different liposomal formulations<br>
1. Liposome loading efficiency<br>
Three separate batches (identified by dates) were used in order to determine<br>
loading efficacy of the drug into the liposomes (HSPC:Chol:2000PEG-DSPE (55:40:5<br>
mole ratio), as summarized in Table 3.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
 (Ta) MPS in liposome + MPS in the extraliposome medium<br>
(b) MPS in liposome only<br>
2. Loading efficiency of MPS for different liposomal formulations<br>
It was determined that the optimum conditions for efficient loading include -600<br>
mOsm of Calcium acetate. The loading efficiency of MPS in HSPC:Chol:2000PEGDSPE<br>
(55:40:5 mole ratio) liposomes with this MPS/phospholipids ratio was obtained<br>
when using initial pro-drug concentration between 5-10 mg/ml, preferably 9 mg/ml. The<br>
concentration of the pro-drug in the final formulation was -6.5 mg/ml which was used<br>
in the following experiments (hereinafter termed the SSL-MPS formulation or in brief<br>
SSL-MPS).<br>
Fig. 2A-2B are Cryo-TEM images of liposomes before (Fig. 2A) and after (Fig. 2B)<br>
loading clearly showing location of the precipitate in the internal aqueous space of the<br>
liposome.<br>
Stability of liposomal formulation<br>
The concentration of MPS in SSL-MPS (i.e. intact liposomal formulation) over<br>
14 months was determined as described above. Fig. 3A shows that after 14 months<br>
-80% of MPS was retained in the liposome. Part of the free MPS was hydrolyzed to its<br>
active form, methylrednisolone (MP). Fig. 3B provides a Sepharose 4B size-exclusion<br>
chromatograph of the liposomal preparation at after 14 months of storage at 4°C, with<br>
an enlargement (Fig. 3C) of the graph at fractions 8 to 17, showing the existence of free<br>
MPS as well as free MP.<br>
Further, stability of SSL-MPS in clinical relevant milieus was determined. Fig. 4<br>
shows the stability of the liposomal formulation in human plasma. The retention of<br>
100% of the encapsulated calcium in the encapsulated liposome under condition that<br>
MPS is released (with a half life in liposome of 50 hours) indicates that the liposomes<br>
are intact for at least 66 hours in plasma. This suggests that the release of MPS is due to<br>
its amphiphacy. The half life of MPS release is in a similar value to SSL half life in<br>
plasma post i.v. injection.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 - Multiple Sclerosis fMS)<br>
Induction of acute EAE experimental animal model using proteolipid protein (PLP)<br>
6-7 week old SJL female mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection with<br>
an emulsion containing proteolipid protein (PLP) 139-151 peptide and complete<br>
Freund's adjuvant (CFA), containing 150ug of peptide and 200ug of Mycobacterium<br>
tuberculosis. In order to boost the immune system Pertussis Toxin (PT) 150ng were<br>
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) to the mice on the first day and 48 hours later.<br>
Each mouse was examined daily for clinical signs of EAE using the following<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The distal part of the tail is limp and droops<br>
The whole tail is loose and droops<br>
The whole tail is loose and droops. Animal has<br>
difficulties to return on his feet when it is laid on his<br>
back<br>
Woobly walk- when the mouse walks the hind legs<br>
are unsteady<br>
The mouse has difficulties standing on its hind legs<br>
but still has remnants of movement<br>
The mouse can't move its legs at all, it looks thinner<br>
and emaciated. Incontinence<br>
The number of mice in each animal group which developed the disease (sick)<br>
was summed and the percentage thereof was calculated.<br>
In addition, the mean maximal score (MMS) by summing the maximal scores of<br>
each of the 10 mice in the group and calculating therefrom the mean maximal score of<br>
the group according to the following equation:<br>
^maximal score of each mouse/number of mice in the group<br>
Further, the mean duration of disease (MDD) expressed in days was calculated<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
^duration of disease of each mouse/number of mice in the group<br>
Further, each group's mean score (CMS) (burden of disease) was determined by<br>
summing the scores of each of the 10 mice in the group and calculating the mean score<br>
per day, according to the following equation:<br>
X total score of each mouse per day/ number of mice in the group.<br>
Treatment ofEAE with SSL-MPS<br>
The EAE induced mice were divided into treatment groups according to the<br>
following Table 5.<br>
Free-MPS 50mg/kg BW 14<br>
SSL-MPS 50mg/kg BW 14<br>
Follow up was conducted for a period of 3 weeks, and clinical signs of EAE<br>
were determined at different time points. For each group, the incidence, MMS= mean<br>
maximal score; MDD= mean disease duration (days); MDO= mean day of onset and<br>
mean score were determined (Table 6). Further, for each group the mean clinical scores<br>
at each time point was determined (Fig. 5).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Treatment of severe disease burden<br>
For mice showing a severe disease burden (determined by summing the scores<br>
of each of the 10 mice in the group and calculating the mean score per day, according to<br>
the following equation: £ total score of each mouse per day/ number of mice in the<br>
group) a different treatment was applied. Specifically, after immunization as described<br>
above, mice were treated with 50mg/kg BW SSL-MPS (days 10, 14, 18) or with free-<br>
MPS 50mg/kg BW (days 10, 14, 18) or dextrose 5% (days 10, 14, 18). For each group,<br>
the incidence, MMS= mean maximal score; MDD= mean disease duration (days);<br>
MDO= mean day of onset and mean score were determined Table 7. Further, for each<br>
group the mean clinical scores at each time point was determined (Fig. 6B) as well as<br>
the survival curve (Fig. 6A)<br>
Table 7- observed clinical signs<br>
Control 9/9(6) 5.56±0.24 11.3±0.28 7.56±2.37 4.18±0.203<br>
SSL-MPS 9/9^6) 2.61±0.36 13.9±0.92 6.78±1.88 0.705±0.09<br>
Free-MPS 9/9~(3)4.44±0.50 12.67±0.65 10.1U1.92 2.62±0.208<br>
The fact that 6 out of 9 died in the control group (untreated) and the high mean<br>
clinical score of the control group confirm that the disease developed was severe (as<br>
compared Table 6 showing the effect in animals which developed a mild disease, where<br>
no mice died and disease mean score of the untreated control group was less than 2.)<br>
The survival curve Fig. 6A, and mean clinical score in Fig. 6B, also both show<br>
that the disease developed with a severe mean score.<br>
Specific attention should be given to the following observations obtained with<br>
respect to the animals which developed a severe burden of disease:<br>
1. While there was mortality in the control and free-MPS groups, all animal<br>
survived in the SSL-MPS treated group;<br>
2. At day 19 (Fig. 6B) treatment with SSL-MPS led to a mean clinical<br>
score close to 0, as compared to that of the free-MPS treated group or control group,<br>
being ~ 3 and -4.8 respectively.<br>
3. Mean score of the disease (Table 5) for the SSL-MPS treated group was<br>
4 times lower than that of the control and ~2 times lower than that of the free-MPS<br>
treated group.<br>
Thus, it was concluded that SSL-MPS has a beneficial therapeutic effect during<br>
severe states of the disease as compared to free MPS.<br>
Comparison with conventional MS drugs in the acute EAE model<br>
SJL female mice (6-7 week old) were immunized as described above. The<br>
immunized mice were divided into groups and each group was treated on days 8, 11,<br>
and 14 post immunization with the following treatment formulations:<br>
Group I - 50mg/kg BW SSL-MPS;<br>
Group II - free-MPS 50mg/kg BW;<br>
Group III - Dextrose 5%;<br>
Group IV - Coapxone 250ug/0.1 cc;<br>
Group VI - Betaferon human 2000ui/0.1 cc.<br>
For each group, the incidence, MMS= mean maximal score; MDD= mean<br>
disease duration (days); MDO= mean day of onset and mean score were determined<br>
Table 8. Further, for each group the mean clinical scores at each time point was<br>
determined (Fig. 7)<br>
Table 8- observed clinical signs<br>
Mean Score<br>
Control 10/10(3) 3.9±0.526 11±0 9.8±1.2 2.3±0.223<br>

0.74±0158<br>
Fig. 7 presents the clinical score at different time points during the follow-up<br>
period. As observed, overall effect of SSL-MPS on the mean burden of the disease was<br>
3 time lower than that of the control of free MPS treated groups. Further, SSL-MPS was<br>
effective in lowering the mean clinical score from severe level of early paralysis to<br>
distal limp tail. Only one mouse died in the SSL-MPS treated group compared to 3 and<br>
5 death incidence in the other groups.<br>
Thus, it was concluded that SSL-MPS has a beneficial effect over the currently<br>
much more superior effect over currently clinically available drugs and this formulation<br>
has the ability to lower mean clinical score from severe state of early paralysis to mild<br>
one.<br>
Induction of acute EAE using MOG (myelin oligodendrocvte slycoprotein)<br>
Induction of chronic EAE using MOG 35-55 peptide was performed as<br>
described [Offen D et al J Mol Neurosci. 15(3):167-76 (2000)]. In general, female<br>
C57B1/6 mice were inoculated (s.c. injection in the right flank) with an<br>
encephalitogenic emulsion (MOG plus CFA enriched with MT (mycobacterium<br>
tuberculosis). Pertussis toxin was injected i.p (250 ng/mouse) on the day of inoculation<br>
and 48 hrs later. A boost of the MOG emulsion was injected s.c. in the right flank one<br>
week after first injection.<br>
After immunization as described above, mice were treated with 50mg/kg BW<br>
SSL-MPS (days 12, 14, 16). The mean clinical scores at each time point was determined<br>
(Fig. 8). As shown, SSL-MPS was effective in reducing the clinical signs of acute EAE.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 - Cancer<br>
Corticosteroids have proven therapeutic efficacy in a variety of cancer types and<br>
are used extensively in cancer therapy, particularly for hematological malignancies<br>
(leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma) and hormone-responsive cancers (breast and prostate<br>
carcinomas). Frequently, corticosteroids are used within the frame of treatment<br>
protocols that include chemotherapy. [Lorraine I. McKay and John A. Cidlowski.<br>

At day 1 of the experiment BALB/C mice were injected i.p. with 1 million<br>
J6456 lymphoma cells (mouse T-cell lymphoma) then mice were divided into groups<br>
and treated by i.v. injections with free-MPS or SSL-MPS according to the following<br>
treatment schedule (Table 9). The median of survival as determined on Day 14 of<br>
treatment was determined and is also shown in Table 9:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The above results show that median survival time was extended by SSLMPS-<br>
treatment in a dose-dependent manner.<br>
In a further assay, survival of BCL-1 (mouse B cell lymphoid leukemia) tumor<br>
bearing mice was determined. According to this assay, at day 1 of the experiment<br>
BALB/C mice were injected I.P with 1 million BCL-1 lymphoma cells (B cell line,<br>
IC50 of MPS in the nmolar range). Then, the mice were divided into groups and treated<br>
at days 5, 9, 12, 16, by i.v. injections, with the following treatment formulations:<br>
Group I - 5 mg/kg BW free-MPS;<br>
Group II - 25 mg/kg BW free-MPS;<br>
Group III - 5 mg/kg BW SSL-MPS;<br>
Group IV - 50 mg/kg BW SSL-MPS.<br>
The survival median of the different groups was determined and summarized in<br>
Table 10.<br>
Survival curve shown in Fig. 9 exhibited a beneficial effect for SSL-MPS as<br>
compared to free MPS or the control group. It is important to note that this cell line was<br>
highly sensitive to MPS.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
