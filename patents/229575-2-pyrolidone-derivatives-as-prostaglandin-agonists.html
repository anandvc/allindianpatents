2-PIPERID0NE  DERIVATIVES AS   PROSTAGLANDIN AGONISTS<br>
[0001] This invention relates to certain 2-pyrrolidone derivatives, and associated pharmaceutical compositions, methods for use as selective prostaglandin EP4 agonists, and methods of preparation thereof.<br>
[0002] There are many references in the literature to prostaglandins or prostanoids (PGs), a term which is generic to natural and synthetic prostaglandins and prostaglandin-like compounds, and it is well known that even slight differences in their chemical structures or stereochemical configurations will have profound effects on their biological activity.<br>
[0003] Prostaglandins or prostanoids (PGs) are a group of bioactive compounds derived from membrane phospholipids, and are formed from 20-carbon essential fatty acids and contain a cyclopentane ring. They fall into several main classes designated by letters and are distinguished by substitutions to the cyclopentane ring. The main classes are further subdivided by subscripts 1,2, or 3 which reflect their fatty acid precursors.<br>
[0004] An example of a particular species of the prostaglandin E is PGE2 , with the following structure-.<br><br>
[0005] At present four different receptor subtypes of PGE2 are known and they are designated EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4.<br>
[0006] Uses for compounds possessing a strong binding activity to PGE2 receptors comprise the prevention and /or treatment of immunological diseases (autoimmune diseases, organ transplantation, etc.), asthma, abnormal bone formation, neuronal cell death, thrombosis and stroke, hepatopathy, abortion, male and female sexual<br><br>
dysfunction, premature birth, inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis or retina neuropathy disorders such as glaucoma.<br>
[0007] Prostaglandins and their associated receptors are more fully described in for example: M. Abramovitz et al., The Utilization of Recombinant Prostanoid Receptors to Determine the Affinities and Selectivities of Prostaglandins and Related Analogs, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 2000,1483, 285-293.<br>
[0008] The involvement of prostaglandin E receptor agonists in bone resorption is<br>
described in, e.g., T. Suzawa et al., The Role of Prostaglandin E Receptor Subtypes in Bone Resorption: An Analysis Using Specific Agonists for the Respective EPs, Endocrinology 2000,141,1554-1559; K. Ono et al., Important Role of EP4, a Subtype of Prostaglandin (PG) E Receptor, in Osteoclast-like Cell Formation from Mouse Bone Marrow Cells Induced by PGE2, J. of Endocrinology 1998, 158, R1-R5; M. Suda et al., Prostaglandin E Receptor Subtypes in Mouse Osteoblastic Cell Line, Endocrinology 1996, 137,1698-1705.<br>
[0009] These selective prostaglandin E receptor agonists are also useful for the treatment of gastric lesions, see e.g. H. Araki, et al. The Roles of Prostaglandin E Receptor Subtypes in the Cytoprotective Action of Prostaglandin E2 in Rat Stomach, Aliment Pharmacol. Then 2000,14 (Suppl. 1), 116-124; T. Kwukata, et al,. E Type Prostaglandin Inhibits Indomethacin-Induced Small Intestinal Lesions Through EP3 and EP4 Receptors: A Study Using Rats and Knockout Mice, Gastroenterology 1 IS, abstract #3787.<br>
[00010] Other uses of prostaglandin E receptor agonists are for improvement of kidney function as described in, e.g., M. D. Breyer, et al, Prostaglandin E Receptors and the Kidney, Am. J. Physiol. 2000,279, F12-F23, and K. E. Purdy, et al., EP1 and EP4 Receptors Mediate Prostaglandin E2 Actions in the Microcirculation of Rat Kidney, Am, J. Physiol. 2000,279, F755-F764; for thrombosis and stroke as well as for other conditions where an inhibition of platelet aggregation would be beneficial as described in, e.g., B. Z. S. Paul, et al, Distribution of Prostaglandin IP and EP Receptor Subtypes and Isoforms in Platelets and Human Umbilical Artery Smooth Muscle Cells, Br. L Haematol. 1993,102,1204-1211; for antiinflammatory effects through inhibition of TNF-alpha generation as described in, e.g. K. K. Meja, et al. Characterization of prostanoid receptor(s) on human blood monocytes at which prostaglandin E2 inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced rumor necrosis factor-alpha generation, Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997,122,149-157, and A. Eigler, et al. AntiÂ¬inflammatory activities of cAMP-elevating agents: enhancement of IL-10 synthesis and concurrent suppression of TNF production, J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998, 63,101-107; or<br><br>
for glaucoma as described in, e.g., M. Takamatsu, et al. Localization of Prostaglandin E Receptor Subtypes in The Ciliary Body of Mouse Eye, Exp. Eye Res. 2000, 70,623-628, and D. F. Woodward, et al, Molecular Characterization and Ocular Hypotensive Properties of the Prostanoid EP2 Receptor, J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995,11, 447.<br>
[00011] Treatment of impotence and/or erectile dysfunction by using prostaglandins that are selective EP2 and/or EP4 receptor ligands have been disclosed in International Application Publication No. WO 99/02164 assigned to Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn AB.<br>
[00012] Additional information relating to prostaglandins and their receptors is described in Goodman &amp; Gillman's, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, ninth edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, Chapter 26, pages 601-616.<br><br><br>

A carbon atom bonded to four nonidentical substituents is termed a "chiral center".<br>
[00043] "Chiral isomer" means a compound with one chiral center. It has two enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality and may exist either as an individual enantiomer or as a mixture of enantiomers. A mixture containing equal amounts of individual enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality is termed a "racemic mixture". A compound that has more than one chiral center has 2n-1 enantiomeric pairs, where n is the number of chiral centers. Compounds with more than one chiral center may exist as either an individual diastereomer or as a mixture of diastereomers, termed a "diastereomeric mixture". When one chiral center is present, a stereoisomer may be characterized by the absolute configuration (R or S) of that chiral center. Absolute configuration refers to the arrangement in space of the substituents attached to the chiral center. The substituents attached to the chiral center under consideration are ranked in accordance with the Sequence Rule of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. (Cahn et al, Arigew. Chem. Inter. Edit 1966,5, 385; errata 511; Cahn et al., Angew. Chem. 1966, 78,413; Cahn and Ingold, J. Chem. Soc. 1951 (London), 612; Cahn et al., Experientia 1956,12,81; Cahn, J-, Chem. Educ. 1964,41,116).<br><br>
[00044]   "Geometric Isomers" means the diastereomers that owe their existence to hindered rotation about double bonds. These configurations are differentiated in their names by the prefixes cis and trans, or 2 and E, which indicate that the groups are on tihe same or opposite side of the double bond in the molecule according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.<br>
[00045] "Atropic isomers" means the isomers owing their existence to restricted rotation caused by hindrance of rotation of large groups about a central bond.<br>
[00046] The compounds of this invention may exist in stereoisomeric form, therefore they can be produced as individual stereoisomers or as mixtures.<br>
[00047] "Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" means an excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such excipient.<br>
[0004S] "Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" of a compound means a salt that is<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound. Such salts include:<br>
[00049] (l)acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the hke; or formed with, organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic add, fumaric add, tartaric acid, citric add, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic add, cinnamic acid, mandelic add, methanesulfonic add, efhanesulfonic add, 1,2-efbane-disulfonic add, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonic add, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4.-toluenesulfonic add, camphorsulfonic add, 4-rnethylbicyclo[2.2.2]-oct--2-ene-l-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic add, 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic add, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic add, glutamic acid, bydioxynaphthoic add, salicylic add, stearic acid, muconic add, and the like; or<br><br>
100050] (2)salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base such as ethanolarnine, diethanolamine, triethanolaroine, tromethamine, N-methylglucamine, and the like.<br>
[00051] It should be understood that all references to pharmaceutically acceptable salts include solvent addition forms (solvates) or crystal forms (polymorphs) as defined herein, of the same acid addition salt- "Crystal forms" (or polymorphs) means crystal structures in which a compound can crystallize in different crystal packing arrangements, all of which have the same elemental composition. Different crystal forms usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate.<br>
[00052] "Solvates" means solvent addition forms that contain either stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate, when the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one of the substances in which the water retains its molecular state as H20, such combination being able to form one or more hydrate.<br>
[00053] The terms "pro-drug" and "prodrug" are used interchangeably herein and refer to any compound which releases an active parent drug according to Formula I in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of a compound of Formula I are prepared by mo&amp;fying one or more functional group(s) present in the compound of Formula I in suchawaythatthemodification(s) maybe cleaved in vivo to release the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of Formula I wherein a hydroxy, amino, sulfhydryl, carboxy or carbonyl group in a ' compound of Formula I is bonded to any group that may be cleaved in vivo to regenerate the free hydroxy!, amino, or sulfhydryl group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, esters (e.g., acetate, diaXkylaminoacetates, formates, phosphates, sulfates, andbenzoate derivatives) and carbamates (e.g., N,N-dimethylaminocarbonyl) of hydroxy functional groups, esters groups (e.g. ethyl esters, morphohnoethanol esters) of carboxyl functional groups, N-acyl derivatives<br><br>
(e.g. N-acetyl) N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases and enaminones of amino functional groups, oximes, acetals, ketals and enol esters of ketone and aldehyde functional groups in compounds of Formula I, and the like, See Bundegaard, H. "Design of Prodrugs" pl-92, Elesevier, New York-Oxford (1985).<br>
[00054] "Protecting group" (PG) refers to a grouping of atoms that when attached to a reactive group in a molecule masks, reduces or prevents that reactivity. Examples of protecting groups can be found in T. W. Green and P. G. M. Futs, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, (Wiley, 3rd ed. 1999) and Harrison and Harrison et alâ Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, Vols. 1-8 (John "Wiley and Sons, 1971-1996). Representative amino protecting groups include, formyl, acetyl, trifiuoroacetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ), tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), trimethyl silyl (TMS), 2-trimethyisilyl-ethanesulfonyl (SES), trity] and substituted trityl groups, allyioxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC), nitro-veratryloxycarbonyl (NVOC), and the like. Representative hydroxy protecting groups include those where the hydroxy group is either acylated or alkylated such as benzyl, and trityl ethers as well as alkyl ethers, tetrahydropyranyl ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers and ally! ethers.<br>
[00055] "Treating" or "treatment" of a disease includes: (1) preventing the disease, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a mammal that maybe exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease; (2) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or its clinical symptoms; or (3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its clinical symptoms.<br>
[00056] "A therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. The "therapeutically effective amount" will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated.<br>

Synthesis<br>
[00070] Compounds of the invention can be made by a variety of methods depicted in the illustrative synthetic reaction schemes shown and described below.<br>
[00071] The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds<br>
generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis; Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-15; Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and<br><br>
Supplemental; and Organic Reactions, Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application.<br>
[00072] The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
[00073] ]Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about -78 Cto about 150 C, more preferably from about 0 C to about 125. C, and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20 C.<br>
[00074] Schemes A, B, and C below illustrate synthetic procedures usable to prepare compounds of Formula I, wherein LG is a leaving group, PG is a protecting group, R is any lower alkyl and may be the same or different in each occurrence, and m, n, A, X, Y, Z, Rl, R2, R4, R6, R7, R8, R9 and RIO are as defined herein. Specific examples of the procedure of Scheme A are provided in the following Experimental section.<br><br><br>
[00075] Scheme A illustrates the preparation of In step 1 of Scheme A, an amino adipic acid a is cyclized to form a ddta-lactam b. Various amino adipic acids of R. and S configuration usable in step 1 are commercially available or may be prepared via well known techniques. The cyclization of this step maybe carried out, for example, by simple heating of the amino adipic add in acetic add or other polar protic solvent conditions preferably under addic conditions..<br>
[00076] Reduction of a carboxylate group of delta lactam b is carried out in step 2, followed by protection of the reduction product to yield a protected alcohol c. The reduction of step 2 may be achieved by, for example, treatment of delta lactam b with, an alkalai metal borohydride or cyanoborohydride under mild, polar protic conditions. The resulting alcohol (not shown) may then be protected, for example, by treatment with alkyl vinyl ether in the presence of trifluoroacetic add to protect the alcohol as an acetal. The protection of hydroxyl groups via acetal formation is described by S. Saijo etal. Cheoi. Pharm. BaR.1980, 28,1449-1458. Protection of the hydroxyl of compound c may also be achieved via silylation as described in T. W. Green and P. G. M. Puts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, (Wiley, 3rd ed. 1999).<br>
[00077] Scheme B below illustrates the preparation of compounds of Formula I. The procedure of Scheme B may be used in embodiments wherein Y is 0,SorNRaor wherein Y can otherwise act as a nucleopbile.<br><br><br>
[00078] In step 1 of Scheme B, an N-alkylation of the lactam nitrogen of the protected alcohol c from Scheme A occurs. This alkylation maybe effected by treatment of the protected alcohol c with a base such as sodium hydride or potassium hexamethyldisilazide at reduced temperature under inert atmosphere, followed by<br><br>
reaction with alkylating agent e. The resulting alkylated product (not shown) is then deprotected by treatment with add to provide alcohol d. The leaving group LG may comprise a halo, tosyl or other suitable leaving group. The group V in Scheme B may be a protected alcohol (-0-PG) or may be R9R10CnZ.<br>
[00079] In step 2, the alcohol e of step 1 is oxidized to an aldehyde (not shown) by mild oxidation with the combination of dimefhylsulfoxide and oxalyl chloride, Dess-Martrn periodinane, the combination of TEMPO and sodium hypochlorite, PCC, PDC or the like. The aldehyde is immedidately reacted with a phosphonic acid dialkyl ester compound g in the presence of base under polar aprotic conditions to give an enone condensation product f.<br>
[00080] Zn step 3, the condensation product f of step 5 may optionally undergo<br>
reduction of the carbonyl and/or unsaturation present in the compound f, to provide a compound h. Stereoselective reduction of the carbonyl group of compound fusing the "CBS" reagents as described by R ]. Corey, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987,109, 7925-7926 or other stereoselective reducing agent maybe utilized in this step. If the preferential formation of one of the diastereomers is desired such as the S-hydroxyl isomer of Formula 1 when A is alkyl, arylalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, or aryloxyaUcyl, the stoichiometric combination ofHthium aluminum hydride-ethanol-(S)-(-)-binaphthol as described by R. Noyori, et alâ J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984,106, 6717-6725 can be used; or iftheR-hydroxyl isomer is desired, the combination of catalytic amounts of (R)-2-methyl""CBS"-oxazaborolidinewith stoichiometric borane-dimethyl sulfide as described by E. J. Corey, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987,109, 7925-7926; or stoichiometric amounts of (R)-3-pinanyl-9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane as described by M. M. Midland et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980,102, 867-869 is used. 1,2 Reduction may be effected with a hydride such as sodium borohydride, for example, in a solvent such as dichloromethane, toluene, ethanol, or tetrahydrofuran. The combination of a lanthanide salt such as cerium (III) chloride with sodium borohydide may also be used when A is aryl or heteroaryl. Catalytic hydrogenation of the double bond with Raney Ni or Pd on carbon yields a saturated side chain.<br>
i    [00081] In step 4, homologation of compound h occurs wherem the group U is displaced by reaction with nudeophilic compound j to yield compound i. Where Z is a carboxylate, hydrolysis to the corresponding acid k may optionally be carried out by procedures well known by the artisan, such as addition of a base such as h'thium, sodium of potassium hydroxide, or an acid such as sulfuric add or hydrochloric acid<br><br>
in a protic or ethereal solvent containing water, or "by employing a Lipase type VII in 0.05 M aqueous phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 as described by C. Luthy, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978,100, 6211-6217.<br>
[00082] Many variations on the procedure of Scheme B may be used. For example, in certain embodiments the delta lactam c may be N-alkylated in step 1, and the N-alkylated lactam may then subsequently be converted to an aldehyde an then alkylated and selectively reduced to provide a compound of Formula I. In another variation, enone f may be reacted with a metal or a magnesium halide of general formula Rl 1M where Rl 1 is alkyl, to introduce an additional group to the carbon attached to group A.   Other variations on Scheme B are possible and will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. Where necessary, conventional protecting group schemes maybe used in association with groups A, Y and Z.<br><br><br>
[00085] The amide compound n is cyclized in step 2 to provide a delta lactam alcohol q. This cyclization process may be effected following protection of the primary hydroxy! of compound n. A suitable protecting agent such as t-butyl-dimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate or benzyl 2,2,2-txicHoroacetimidate will, respectively, furnish the silyl or benzyl ether protecting groups. Thesecondaryhydroxylofnmay then be activated for displacement by treatment with alkyl or arylsulfonyl chloride such as merhanesulfony] chloride. The amide-secondary sulfonate (not shown) may then be treated with a base such as an alkali metal hydride or alkoxide in a polar medium such as methanol, tetrahydrofuran, or N,N-dimethylformamide to effect the cyclization. The pendent primary ether may be deprotected by the action of fluoride (tetrabutylammonium fluoride) in the case a silyl ether or catalytic hydrogenolysis " (Pd-C under hydrogen gas) in the case of a benzyl ether. Compound q may then be processed according to Scheme B, Steps 2-5, to afford compounds of Formula I. If the R-enantiomer of q were desired, asymmetric dihydroxylation, according to M. Shipman, et al. Synthesis 1998,1141-1144, maybe used.<br>

EXAMPLE 5 Functional activity of EP4. for EP2) receptor by a Luciferase Assay<br>
a.	Generation of stably transfected EP4-luciferase clones<br>
[000147] Prostanoid receptor EP4 cDNA corresponding to the full-length coding sequence was subcloned into the appropriate sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (+)/Zeo (Invitrogen). In addition, the sequence containing CAMP responsive element (CRE) and luciferase gene was cloned to a pXPl vector. The co-transfection to the CHO cells with EP4R containing pcDNA and CRE-luciferase containing pXP 1 were carried out with a DNA ratio of 5 to 1 by Eugene (Roche Molecular) in a F-12 media (Gibco) supplemented with 30% heat inactivated fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco). Three days after the transfection, the culture was replace with fresh media containing Zeocin. The culture was maintained for one month until stable clones were generated.<br>
b.	c-AMP dependent luciferase gene assay<br>
[000148] The functional activity of an EP4 agonistic ligand upon its binding to the<br>
r<br>
receptor was measured by the production of intra-cellular c-AMP. Here the level of c-AMP was measured indirectly by the translation of a reporter gene, luciferase in the EP4-luciferase clones. The cells of EP4-luciferase clone were subcultured in 200 ul of F12 (Gibco, BRL) media containing 10% FBS(Gibco, BRL), and 25 mM Hepes to 96-well plates (Packard) at the density of 40,000 cells/well. After an overnight culture at 37Â°C, 5% C02,95% air, the culture media was removed in the next morning. The cells were washed twice with 100 ul of Hanks buffer, and re-furnished with 90 ul of F12 media containing 0.1% BSA. After pre-incubation of the culture for one and half to three hours at 37oC, 5% C02, 95% air, 10 ul of compounds of interest at 10 X of desired concentration were added to culture and the incubation at 37 Â°C was continued for another three hours. 0.1 uM of PGE2 as a full agonist control was routinely included to each assay to determine the maximal stimulation of luciferase mediated through EP4 receptor.<br><br><br>
[000149] At the end of incubation, the culture media was dumped and Wotted to dry. The plate was then ready to assay for luciferase.<br>
a	Quantitation of luciferase activity<br>
[000150] An assay kit, LucLite, purchased from Packard was used to quantitate luciferase activity. 30 minutes prior to end of incubation, LucLite substrate and substrate buffer {Packard) were allowed to equilibrate to room temperature. The substrate was dissolved in the substrate buffer and mixed by inversion. Equal volumes of Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS, Gibco BRL) containing ImM MgCl2 and 1 mM CaCU were then mixed with the reconstituted substrate solution for use in the next step. 100 ulofthe mixed solution was added to each well of the 96-well plate. The plate was shaken at 300 rpm on plate shaker for 3 min. The plate cover was removed and replaced with plate sealer (Packard) for counting in a scintillation counter. The EC50 of a compound was then determined by a four-parameter curvefit program of KaleidaGraph. Compounds of Formula I showed activity using the above assay.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Competitive Binding Assay of [3HIPGE2 to rEP1. rEP2, rEPs and rEP4 Receptor<br>
a.	Cell Culture and Transfections<br>
[000151] Stably transfected cells expressing EP3 were grown in F-12 media (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated certified Petal Bovine Serum (GIBCO) and pelleted. Prostanoid receptor EP2 or EP4 cDNA corresponding to the full-length coding sequence was subcloned into the appropriate sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(-f)/Zeo (Invitrogen). Transfection-scale quantities of the vector were prepared using the Qiagen Endo-Free Plasmid Maxi Kit and transfected into COS-7 cells using FuGene 6 (Roche Molecular) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated certified Fetal Bovine Serum (GIBCO) and Gentamicin (GIBCO), and were harvested 72 hours after transfection. Cells were<br><br>
pelleted by centrifugation, washed with PBS (GIBCO), repelleted, then flash-frozen in dry-ice/Ethanol or used directly for membrane preparation.<br>
K	Membrane Preparation<br>
[000152] All procedures for membrane preparation were performed at 4Â° C. Prostanoid receptor-transfected COS-7 cells or stably transfected CHO cells were homogenized in assay buffers (see recipe, below) using a Polytron homogenizer {Bririknian) and centrifuged at 48,000 x g for 30 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in assay buffer and resuspended by sonication using a Branson sonifier. Protein concentration was determined using the BioRad DC Protein Assay following the manufacturer's directions and stored at -80Â° C.<br>
c.		Prostanoid Receptor Binding Assays<br>
[000153] Methods for competitive affinity binding assays of EP2, EP3 and EP4 were derived from those described in M. Abramovitz et al, "The utilization of recombinant prostanoid receptors to determine the affinities and selectivities of prostaglandins and related analogs" Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1483 (2000) 285-293. Binding assays were performed in a final incubation volume of 0.2 ml in the following assay buffers: 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM MgC12 (pH 7.4) (EP3) or 10 mM MES, 10 mM MnCl2, and 1 mM EDTA (pH to 6.0 with NaOH) (EP2 and EP4) and radioligand (2.25 nM (EP3) or 2.5 nM (EP2) [3H]-PGE2 (200 Ci/mmol, NEN)}. Reactions were initiated by addition of membrane protein (approximately 50 ug/reaction for EP3,100 ug for EP2 and EP4). Dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma) concentration was kept constant at 1% (v/v) in all incubations, and compounds were assayed at final concentrations of 100 uM-0.3 nM. Non-specific binding was detennined in the presence of 10 ?M of non-radioactive PGE2 (Cayman Chemical). Incubations were conducted for 60 minutes at 30Â° C (EP3) or 45 minutes at 23 C (EP2 and EP4). Incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through a 96-well Unifilter GF/B (Packard) (prewetted in 10 mM MES, 0.01% BSA, pH 6.0 for EP2) at 4 C using a Piltermate 196 96-well semi-automated cell harvester (Packard). The filters were washed with 3-4 ml of wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 for EP3,10 mM MES, 0,01% BSA, pH 6.0 for EP2 and EP4), dried for at least 1 hour at room temperature, and the residual radioactivity bound to the individual filters determined<br><br>
by scintillation counting with addition of 37.5 uL of Microscint 20 (Packard) using a Packard TopCount Microplate Scintillation Counter. Statistics of binding were determined using Prism v 3.0 software (GraphPad). Compounds of Formula I showed activity using the above assays.<br>
