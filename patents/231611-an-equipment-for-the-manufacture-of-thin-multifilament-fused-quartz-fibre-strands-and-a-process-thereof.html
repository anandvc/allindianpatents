				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an equipment for the manufacture of thin multifilament fused quartz fibre strands and a process thereof:<br>
Fused quartz fibres or filaments are very good candidates for structural composites because of their unique mechanical, thermal and electrical properties. Being the lightest structural fibres they have high tensile strength in unidirectional composite, very low coefficient of thermal expansion and good electrical characteristics of high resistivity and low dielectric constant maintained over a broad temperature and frequency ranges. Some other key features of these fibres are very low moisture absorption, high temperature resistance, high hardness and high composite lifetime along with excellent resin compatibility. These fibres in textile fonns as multiple fibre yarns, chopped strands, rovings, tapes, and mats where the continuous filament diameter varies from 9 to 15 microns find wide application in advanced composites structures, electro-magnetic windows, high-speed printed circuit boards, thermal insulation blankets for furnaces and aerospace engines, high performance cables etc.<br>
Present day method of making fused quartz fibre encompasses several processes. Reference for which may be made to the product references of Fiber Materials Incorporated, USA and Quartz Silice, France wherein single filament of quartz fibre was drawn by heating the quartz rod using hydrogen/oxygen flame. Here the fuel source is costly and handling of hydrogen is not safe but the contamination from hydrocarbon fuel is eliminated. In this process the end of the rod is first softened and subsequently the rod end is pulled into thin filament of 9 to 15 micron diameter on continuous basis onto a high speed rotating drum after applying suitable sizing or coating resin. The drawbacks of the above process are:<br>
(1)	Each quartz rod with one hydrogen/oxygen burner assembly produces only one<br>
filament. By placing multiple stages of parallel rods with array of hydrgen/oxygen<br>
burners the thin fused/quartz fibres are  drawn     coating with  sizing resin and<br>
accumulated with the help of a gathering mechanism to form strand.<br>
(2)	The control of diameter of the individual fibre is difficult which incurs strength<br>
degradation in the ultimate fibre strand.<br>
(3)	The control of environment  is cost intensive due to the explosive  nature of the<br>
fuel gas.<br>
(4)	Contamination by foreign matter is possible resulting degradation in the fibre<br>
tensile strength.<br>
(5)	Heating by hydrogen/oxygen flame does not give uniform necking in each stage<br>
also resulting in strength degradation.<br>
(6)	The requirement of space to accommodate   number of rods in a oxy/hydrogen<br>
burner assembly in a row is more which  effectively increases the cost of the<br>
technology.<br>
Reference may be made of the inventors J. Murach and R. Bruckner in 'Structure sensitive investigations on alkali metasilicate glass fibres', J. Non. Crystalline Solids, 204 (1996) 282-293, wherein they described a nozzle drawing method for making silicate glass fibres where the mass flow rate is a function of the furnace temperature and pressure on the glass at the nozzle head . The major disadvantages of this process are that the fibres get contaminated by the nozzle material and fibre diameter can not be controlled due to change of diameter of nozzle orifice by erosion. Further reference may be made of the inventors J. Murach and R. Bruckner, in "Preparation and structure-sensitive investigations on silica glass fibers", J. Non-Crystalline Solids, 211 (1997) 250-261, wherein they developed a process for fabricating fused silica fibers by heating the end of the rotating silica glass rod by a moving hydrogen /oxygen burner. The mass flow of the rod drawing method depends on the driving speed of the silica rod or of the heating source and suitable temperature profile. The diameters of the fibers drawn are in the range 5 to 25 micron using 5 -8 mm diameter silica rods.. In addition to all the drawbacks mentioned above this method does not help in very high speed drawing of thin silica fibres . Still further reference may be made to British Patent Nos. 1,196,331 &amp; 1,196,332 (1970) of PPG Industries Inc., wherein thin filament of high silicate glass fibre was drawn by bushing technology. World wide technology available for production of thin fibre is based on noble metal bushing and this process technology is capital intensive specifically suitable for large scale production.<br>
Here the process involves molten glass exuding) through the bush-nozzles under gravity or certain pressure transforms into thuTfibres by dynamic balance between the forces of surface tension and mechanical attenuation. Precise control of viscosity of the molten glass is needed to reduce fibre breaking rate. The multi filaments are drawn simultaneously from the melt through bushing which is maintained at uniform temperature and subsequently the strand is wound on a high speed drum after application of sizing resin mostly for low melting glasses. For each set of fibres the temperature profile has to be adjusted as per the environmental condition.<br>
(1)	This technology has the limitation for making fibre having high attenuation<br>
temperature where glass fibre containing more than 95% silica is not possible by this<br>
technology.<br>
(2)	Suitable bushing for drawing high purity quartz fibre better than 95% has not been<br>
developed and reported.<br>
(3)	In this conventional technology the orifice of the bushing which is made of<br>
platinum-rhodium alloys,   gradually increases due to erosion during the continuous<br>
fibre drawing process and needs to be reworked.<br>
Further reference may be made of the inventor, S. Kumar, "Glass composition for spinning fibre", in J. Non Crystalline Solids, 80 (1986) 122- 134, wherein 'A' glass fibre from waste strips of glass sheets are drawn. The fibre cools and frozen-in as it is drawn. An array of glass strips are placed in rectangular muffle furnace and thin fibres are drawn by rod pulling method. The main drawback of the process is that the technique is not suitable for high melting fused silica glass rods. Using the same process "N" glass fibres are also drawn where the thin fibre drawing temperature in all the cases is less than 1500°C.<br>
To summarise the drawbacks of the above processes it may be mentioned that<br>
(1)	the above referred   inventions are mainly involved in the heating of the starting<br>
silica rods and melting of quartz glass,<br>
(2)	in case of using hydrogen/oxygen burner, the control    of the individual fibre<br>
diameter is difficult: and it degrades the ultimate strength of the fibre strand,<br>
(3)	the fibre drawing environment control is cost intensive due to explosive nature of<br>
the fuel gases,<br>
(4)	the possibility of contamination during fibre drawing by foreign matter involves<br>
increase of breaking rates for continuous drawing,<br>
(5)	while moving the hydrogen/oxygen burner and keeping the feeding rod fixed, the<br>
process does not give high drawing speed because of improper temperature profile<br>
surrounding the end of the silica rod and<br>
(6)	the crucible melt technique does not provide suitable bushing for drawing high<br>
purity quartz fibre and it is limited by the maximum melt temperature around 1500°C,<br>
in case of silica glass melting the nozzled bushing does not withstand   temperature<br>
above 2000 °C.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an equipment for the manufacture of thin multifilament fused quartz fibre strands to obviate the above drawbacks.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the manufacture of thin multifilament fused quartz fibre strands using the equipment of the present invention.<br>
The equipment of the present invention for the manufacture of thin filament fused quartz fibre strands drawing system is developed is shown schematically in Figure 1. Of the drawing accompanying this specification.<br>
In figure 1(3) represents a mechanical jig for holding silica rods (4) in particular radial geometry.   Other end of the device is made suitable for fixing vertically into, a six-jaw chuck (2) mounted in a X-Y micropositioner (1).   The rod holding system is designed; in such a fashion that it can be adjusted in a fraction of a millimeter concentric to the opening of the induction furnace (5).<br>
The rising applicator system (6) consists of a rotating drum absolutely vibration free during operation. It is driven by a small induction motor. The whole system is placed on a precision micropositioner to make fine mechanical contact with the multiple fibres. The bunch of bibres piocls up all the size with which it comes into contact while passing over the surface of the drum or roller which is made of compressed graphite. The film thickness of the size formed around the roller is proportional to rotational speed of the roller. The wrap-round angle of the fibres over the roller is kept as low as 2° to minimize the abrasion. Below the resin applicator the fibres are bunched together with the help of a gathering shoe (7) self lubricated by the sizing solution carried by the fibres.. This is also made of compressed graphite with suitable groove on the roller. The collet drum (8) is made of stainless steel of diameter 200 mm and length 600 mm. The r.p.m. of collet drum can be achieved upto 1500 without much vibration to cause fibre breakage. The whole ropatating device is placed on a precision translation table powered by steper motor and controlled by a computer upto an accuracy of 1 micrometer per step.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an equipment for the manufacture of thin multifilament fused quartz fibre strands characterized by a movable mount (1,2,3) such as herein described, for holding a plurality of fused quartz rods(4) within a heat zone (5) such as herein described, a coating applicator(6) being coaxially fixed surrounding strands of fibre below the said quartz rods (4) and said heat zone(5), a perforated silica disc (4a) is provided at the top of the said heat zone(5) to act as a heat shield-cum-rod(s) guide, a known gathering mechanism(7)<br>
fixed below the said coating applicator(6), a strand winding machine(S) is fixed below the said gathering mechanism(7) for rotational and translational movement.<br>
In an embodiment of present invention the movable mount (1,2,3) consist of rod holding jig (3) removable fixed to a jaw chuck (2) mounted onto a micropositioner (I).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the heat zone (5) may be a furnace such as induction furnace, resistive heating furnace capable of heating quartz rods at a temperature in the range of 1900-2300°C.<br>
In still another embodiment a perforated silica disc (4a) may be provided at the top of the furnace to act as a heat shield-cup-rod (s) guide.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the rotational and translational movement of the fibre strand winding machine (8) may be provided by prime movers such as a stepper motor and a servo-motor for precision winding of the thin multifilament fibre strands.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of thin multifilament fused quartz fibre strands using the equipment fothe present invention which comprises introducing a plurality of fused quartz rods mounted on a holding jig into a furnace at: a peak temperature in the range of 1900-2300°C with a Gaussian type temperature profile along the vertical direction of the furnace, drawing fibres inside the furnace by pulling the bulk end of the rod that initially comes through the bottom of the furnace, passing the fibre over a sizing solution applicator and a gathering shoe onto a collet drum.<br>
In embodiment of the present invention the quartz rods used may be made of silica such as type-I to IV with low to high OH content and small alkali and metal impurities of various dimensions of rod diameter ranging from 3 to 10 mm and of lengths 30 mm to 1000 mm.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the sizing solution may be prepared by hydrolyzing organ metallic silicone compound at a pH in the range of 5 to 5.5 by known methods.<br>
Process description:<br>
In figure 1 (3) represents a mechanical device for holding silica rods in particular radial geometry. Other end of the device is made suitable for fixing vertically into a six-jaw chuck (2) mounted in a X-Y micropositioner (1). The rod holding system is<br>
designed in such a fashion that it can be adjusted in a fraction of a millimeter concentric to the opening of the induction furnace<br>
1.	Furnace temperature is critically adjusted for getting precise temperature profile<br>
along the vertical direction of the furnace. The furnace is of radio frequency<br>
induction type where a specially designed zirconia susceptor is centrally mounted<br>
of 40 mm diameter and 90 mm long. Power is inductively fed onto the susceptor to<br>
get desired temperature.<br>
2.	Once the temperature is adjusted silica rods are introduced into the furnace through<br>
a perforated silica disc just placed above the furnace mouth.<br>
3.	Silica rods are mounted in the fixture (3) concentrically with the furnace cross-<br>
section so that each rod gets uniform temperature. This part is important otherwise<br>
at high speed drawing the thin fibres may be snapped due to uneven necking of the<br>
rods inside the furnace. As the inside temperature distribution along the cross<br>
section of the furnace is not uniform, the alignment of the rods inside the furnace is<br>
very critical. The fixture was designed in such a fashion that the silica rods could<br>
be placed parallel with the furnace wall and able to move vertically downward in<br>
the same condition. The temperature difference from the inside surface of the<br>
furnace element to the centre of the furnace is in the range of 40 to 60°C.<br>
4.	After the necking at the rod end inside the furnace when the temperature ranging<br>
from 1910 to 2020°C is critically adjusted suitable for particular rod diameter,<br>
initially the bulk ends or gobs start coming out through the bottom of the furnace<br>
and allowed to move till it touches the rotating   collet drum.<br>
5.	Fibres are then cut and bunch together for fixing onto the rotating drum which is<br>
placed vertically down to the floor (~2 m) via a conventional gathering shoe. The<br>
rotating drum is specially designed with remote computer for precise    rotational<br>
control and drum translation with ~1 micron accuracy.<br>
6.	At this stage sizing solution is applied with the help of a sizing applicator system<br>
where a rotating graphite roller (r.p.m.~30 - 60) carries the sizing solution  from<br>
the cup,   transfers in the form of a thin jacket onto the fibre surface by fine<br>
mechanical contact.<br>
7.	The   sizing   solution   was   prepared   by   hydrolysing   organometallic   silicone<br>
compound at    pH value in the range of   5 to 5.5 , mixing with 2-5 grams<br>
ammonium chloride, 5 - 8 ml    n-propyl amine,    2- 3 gins polyvinyl acetate<br>
emulsion, 1-3 gm cationic surfactant, 5-10 ml polyethylene glycol in 60-70 ml of<br>
distilled water.  The viscosity of the solution and rotational speed of the drum are<br>
critically adjusted to get uniform thickness onto the fibre surface in order to get<br>
tensile strength of the fibres better than 2 Gpa. The centering of the system has been perfected by adjusting the applicator system with the help of a X-Y micropositioner.<br>
8.	Once the sizing resin starts coating uniformly onto the fibres the rotational speed of<br>
the collet drum is adjusted simultaneously with the feeding speed of quartz rods.<br>
This process part has been experimented with rods having diameters in the range<br>
of 2 to 10 mm. Utilizing the present designed system multi fibre strand   are<br>
smoothly wound on to the collet drum. The diameter of the individual fibre is in the<br>
range 8 to 50 micron has easily been maintained in continuous long length.   The<br>
rod feeding downward speed is critical in the present system which is 1.2 mm to<br>
20 mm per minute and collet drum winding speed 400 to 1000 r.p.m. depending<br>
upon the diameter of the initial starting fused quartz rods.<br>
9.	This process for making thin filament fused quartz fibres where the furnace<br>
environment should be maintained very clean by applying downward laminar flow<br>
(1) of particulate air (
time in a heating zone which is exposed to atmosphere. The rod holding system<br>
integrates the space subsequently reduces the cost of the technology.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

According to the present invention tensile strength and productivity of manufacturing fibre strand can be improved whereas the referred prior art equipment and processes are mainly involved in the heating of the starting silica rods and melting of glass. In case of hydrogen/oxygen burner, the control of the individual fibre diameter is difficult and it degrades the ultimate strength of the fibre strand and the fibre drawing environment control is cost intensive due to explosive nature of the fuel gases. The present invention avoids these problems and the possibility of contamination during fibre drawing by foreign matter is also less. This enhances the tensile strength of the fibre. The crucible melt technique does not provide suitable bushing for drawing high purity quartz fibre and it is limited by the maximum melt temperature around 1500°C, in case of silica glass melting the nozzled bushing does not withstand temperature &gt;<br>
1500°C. The present invention is applicable to drawing thin fibre strand from very<br>
high purity of fused silica glass in the melting range of 1900° to 2300°C.<br>
Jn the present invention, the equipment and the process make it possible to draw thin<br>
multifilament fused quartz fibre strand in a radial heating zone where a precise vertical<br>
temperature profile can be maintained.<br>
Furthermore the advantages are as follows:<br>
a)	The present invention manifests a process for manufacturing continuous multifi<br>
lament fused quartz fibre having uniform filament diameter which has very high<br>
attenuation temperature and can not be produced by multiple bushing technology.<br>
b)	The process avoids explosive fuel gases like hydrogen and integrates the working<br>
area where multiple glass rods can be mounted in circular heatzone which is<br>
exposed to ambient air. It minimizes contamination onto the fibre coming from the<br>
fuel gases.<br>
c)	Attenuation of the silica rod to thin fibre of 5 to 14 micron can be accomplished<br>
precisely in very short time and continuous fibre drawing at high drawing speed<br>
could be achieved maintaining high tensile strength of the fibre.<br>
d)	Unlike the other process this technology helps to make multiple fibre strand having<br>
uniform diameter in continuous length.<br>
e)	The gaussian type vertical temperature profile with peak temperature 1900 to<br>
2300°C specifically required for making fused quartz fibre can easily be achieved<br>
in zirconia muffle furnace.<br>
f)	By suitably increasing the furnace size more number of rods can be accommodated<br>
to increase the yield.<br>
g)	The radial heating zone integrates the optimum space required for drawing fibres<br>
from high melting glass rods.<br>
h) Thin coherent fibre bundles of various dimension from 0.5 to 2 mm diameter can be fabricated for light guiding purpose. This fibre optic bundle has very high market potential at present and future.<br><br><br><br>
