Reflector<br>
The present invention concerns a weatherproof, corrosion-resistant reflector for electromagnetic radiation, in particular for infrared radiation, visible light and ultraviolet radiation, with a high total reflection, containing a reflector body of aluminium or an aluminium alloy with a reflective surface or containing a reflective body with a reflection layer of aluminium or an aluminium alloy forming a reflective surface, and a process for production of a reflector according to the invention,<br>
It is generally known to produce strips in bright materials e.g. pure aluminium, purest aluminium or AlMg alloys based on aluminium with a purity degree of 99.5% and higher, e.g. 99.8%, which, depending on application, generate diffused or directed light reflection. It is also known to increase the targeted reflection to brighten the surfaces of such strips chemically or electrolytically and then by anodic oxidisation create a protective layer of e.g. 2 - 10 µm layer thickness.<br>
In the open air, however, such reflectors have a restricted life. Moisture in co-operation with UV radiation or CO2/ SO2<br>
or pollutants in general lead to a reduction in reflection values i.e. reduction of the brightness or total reflection.<br>
The  anodisation process  and  the  relatively high  layer thickness of the anodisation layer of for example 2 - 10 µm also lead, in particular, with less pure aluminium materials, to a reduction in the reflection degree on the surface i.e. a reduction both of the total reflection and the targeted reflection by absorption and diffuse light scatter in the oxide layer. To keep the said disadvantages within limits, therefore, high purity and expensive bright alloys based on purest  aluminitim  must  be  used.  High  purity  aluminium materials  however  often have  unsatisfactory  deformation behaviour and low limits of elasticity, i.e. their strength<br><br>
is relatively low.<br>
Reflectors are also known of glass surfaces with aluminium or silver mirroring on the rear. Such reflectors are however expensive to produce. They also have a high weight, are fragile and non-deformable.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to propose a reflector, the reflective side of which is resistant to weather and corrosion and mechanical influences and is also easy to clean. In addition, production in a continuous production process must be possible.<br>
According to the invention the task is solved in that the reflective surface of aluminium or an aluminium alloy has a roughness Ra of less than 0.1 µm to DIN 4761 to DIN 4768 and the reflector has an external final transparent protective layer of a polymer of a thickness greater than 1 µm and the reflector according to the 2000h QUV test to ASTM G 53-96 has losses of total reflection and brilliance of less than 5%.<br>
The transparent protective layer is in particular a clear colourless transparent protective layer. The protective layer is preferably a sol-gel lacquer, in particular a sol-gel lacquer of a polysiloxane and advantageously a sol-gel lacquer of a polysiloxane produced from an alcoholic silane solution and a watery colloidal silicic acid solution. Polysiloxane is the term for polymers of cross-linked siloxanes.<br>
The reflective surface can itself be formed by a metallic reflection layer applied to the reflector body or preferably by the reflector body surface itself.<br>
The reflector body consists of or has at least one free surface, in particular a coating of a metal, in particular aluminium or an aluminium alloy e.g. aluminium with a purity<br><br>
of 98.3% and higher. The reflector body consists of or has at least one free surface, in particular a coating, advantageously of aluminium with a purity of 99.0% and higher, where applicable also with a purity of 99.5% and higher, preferably however with a purity of 99.7% and higher, and in particular 99.8% and higher. As well as aluminium of the said purities, preferably aluminium alloys can also be used. Preferred alloys are those of classes AA 1000, AA 3000 and AA 5000. Other suitable alloys contain for example 0.2 5 to 5 w.%, in particular 0.5 to 4 w.% magnesium or contain 0.2 to 2 w.% manganese or contain 0.5 to 5 w.% magnesium and 0.2 to 2 w.% manganese, in particular 1 w.% magnesium and 0.5 w.% manganese, or contain 0.1 to 12 w.%, preferably 0.1 to 5 w.%, copper or contain 0.5 to 6 w.% zinc and 0-5 to 5 w.% magnesium or contain 0.5 to 6 w.% zinc, 0.5 to 5 w.% magnesium and 0.5 to 5 w,% copper or contain 0.5 to 2 w.% iron and 0.2 to 2 w.% manganese, in particular 1.5 w.% iron and 0.4 w.% manganese or AlMgSi alloys or AlFeSi alloys. Further examples are AlMgCu alloys such as A199.85MgO, 8Cu or AlMg alloys such as AlMgl, or AlFelto alloys such as AlFeMnl.5.<br>
The reflector body is preferably a rolled product and in particular a rolled sheet or strip, a rolled film or plate of reliable aluminium or a reliable aluminium alloy. The reflector body as a rolled product can where applicable be deformed e.g. by bending, deep drawing, cold flow pressing or similar.<br>
Also, as a reflector body all physical structures can be used which have at least one free surface of one of the said aluminiums or one of the said aluminium alloys or consist completely thereof. Also, only part areas or limited surface areas of the reflector body may consist of the said aluminium materials or aluminium alloys. Furthermore, the said physical structures may be profiles or bars.<br>
The reflector body may also consist of castings or forgings<br><br>
of aluminium or an aluminium alloy.<br>
Depending on use, the entire reflector body may consist of aluminium or an aluminium alloy but also only part areas or surface areas may consist thereof. The material of aluminium or aluminium alloy, e.g. in the form of a sheet, film, plate or coating, can also form part or a part surface of a laminate e.g. a film laminate or laminate of any materials e.g. plastic and aluminium, Al-coated plastic or Al-coated iron or steel plate.<br>
The reflector body surface, i.e. the aluminium surface of the reflector body, can for example be produced by chemical and/or mechanical changes e.g. rolling, forging, cold flow pressing, pressing or casting. The reflective surface of the reflector body can in addition be subjected to subsequent treatment by grinding, polishing, blasting with hard substances etc. Preferred reflector bodies are those with rolled surfaces produced with smooth or structured rollers.<br>
Preferred reflector bodies are sheets and strips, in particular rolled sheets and strips, of aluminium or an aluminium alloy of the said composition and aluminium-coated iron or steel sheet with a thickness for example of 0.1 to 10 mm, preferably 1 to 4 mm, in particular 0.2 to 1.5 mm, and particularly preferably 0.3 to 1 mm, where the aluminium coating is also an aluminium or an aluminium alloy of the said composition. One example is an aluminium sheet Al 99.5 (purity 99.5%) of thickness 0.5 mm.<br>
The surface of the reflector body or the reflective surface can be pretreated and for example have a pretreatment layer. The pretreatment layer can for example be a layer produced by chromatising, phosphatising or anodic oxidation. Preferably, the pretreatment layer consists of anodic oxidised aluminium and is in particular produced from the aluminium lying on the surface of the reflector body.<br><br><br>
The pretreatment layer can have a thickness of for example at least 10 nm, preferably at least 20 nm, in particular at least 50 nm and advantageously at least 100 nm. The maximum thickness of the pretreatment layer is for example 5000 nm, preferably 1500 nm and in particular 300 nm.<br>
The pretreatment layer is preferably an anodically generated oxide layer which was constructed in a non-redissolving and preferably a redissolving electrolyte. The pretreatment layer is preferably a porous, anodically produced oxide layer.<br>
Anodisation preferably takes place in an acid electrolyte from the range of phosphoric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, chromic acid electrolytes and in particular from the range of sulphuric acid electrolytes. Anodisation takes place in the alternating and preferably direct current process. Unit anodising and strip anodising is possible.<br>
The anodically generated oxide layer can also be subjected to a sealing or densif ication treatment. The said oxide layer is preferably not densified.<br>
The pretreatment layer can also contain a yellow chromatised layer, a green chromatised layer, a phosphate layer or a chrome-free pretreatment layer grown in an electrolyte containing at least one of the elements Ti, Zr, F, Mo or Mn.<br>
Furthermore, the aluminium surface for pretreatment can be brightened in a chemical or electrochemical process or subjected to an alkali pickling process. Such brightening or pickling processes are performed before anodising.<br>
Before application of a pretreatment layer or performance of a first pretreatment step, the reflector surface is suitably degreased and cleaned. The pretreatment may also comprise only degreasing and cleaning the reflector surface. The reflector surface can be cleaned in a known manner e.g.<br><br>
chemically and/or electrochemically by acid or alkali. Its purpose is to remove foreign substances and where applicable the naturally occurring oxide layer on the aluminium surface. Suitable cleaning agents are e.g. acidic watery degreasants, alkali degreasants based on polyphosphate and borate. Cleaning with moderate to severe material reduction is performed by pickling or etching using strong alkali or acidic pickling solutions e.g. sodium lye or a mixture of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid. The oxide layer present with its contaminants is removed. When highly aggressive alkali pickling is used, where applicable acidic secondary treatment may be required.<br>
Depending on the surface condition a mechanical surface removal by abrasive means may be required.  Such surface treatment can for example take place by grinding, blasting, brushing or polishing and where applicable be supplemented by chemical secondary treatment.<br>
In the preferred embodiment in a strip process a pretreatment layer is applied to an aluminium strip. For this an aluminium strip (Al 99.85, Ra 0.04 µm) with 500 mm width and 0.3 mm thickness is anodised continuously at around 40 m/min. The following stages are passed (through baths):<br>
a)	Degreasing at pH 9 - 9.5 at approx 50°C and bonder V6150/01,<br>
b)	Rinsing with tap water (room temperature),<br>
c)	Anodising in 20% H2SO4 at approx 25°c and 20V voltage,<br>
d)	Rinsing in tap water at around 50°C and<br>
e)	Rinsing in deionised water at approx 85°C.<br>
The protective layer or further layers can be applied to the pretreatment layer. The strip is advantageously only cut into strips of the desired size and shape after completion of the coating i.e. after coating with the protective layer.<br><br>
The reflective surface has a roughness Ra of	suitably less<br>
than 0.1 |µim, preferably less than 0.05 µm and	in particular<br>
less than 0.02 µm. The surface roughness Ra is	defined in at<br>
least one of DIN specifications 4761 to 4768.<br>
The surface of the reflector body can be smooth ox-structured and for example have a light-conductive structure in the form e.g. of a rib pattern with toothed cross-section. The structuring can for example be produced by way of a roller with corresponding embossed pattern. The surface of the reflector body with relation to structuring or roughness can be composed such that the reflection of the radiation is targeted, scattered or a combination thereof.<br>
The said roughness Ra of structured surfaces relates to the individual part areas of the surface structure i.e. the structuring itself logically is not included in the determination of roughness.<br>
In a further embodiment a reflection layer forming the reflective surface and made of a metal, e.g. a layer of aluminium, silver, copper, gold, chromium, nickel or an alloy for example containing mostly at least one of the said metals, can be applied to the reflective body or its pretreatment layer. The thickness of the reflection layer can for example be 10 to 200 nm (nanometer). Furthermore, on the reflector body or its pretreatment layer, to smooth out the surface roughness, can be applied a functional layer in the form of an organic or inorganic sol-gel layer. Usually, the reflection layer here lies directly or by way of an adhesion layer on the functional layer. The composition of the functional layer is described in detail in EP 918 236 Al.<br>
The reflection layer can also be part of a reflection layer system where the reflection layer system contains one or more transparent layers applied to the reflection layer. For example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 transparent layers -<br><br>
counted without the protective layer - advantageously fulfil with regard to optical thickness for each layer, formula λI2, where in particular each of these transparent layers is a double layer of at least 2 layers of thickness λ/4. The optical thickness of each transparent layer with formula X/2 can vary by ± 40 nm. A transparent layer is preferred, or further preferably two, three or more transparent layers which can consist of the same or different materials, where each of the transparent layers has an optical thickness of λ/2 ± 40 nm and in particular is a double layer of thickness 2.λ/4. On the said transparent layer or layers as a top layer or as the layer lying on the surface is arranged the protective layer which in turn is also transparent. λ corresponds to the intensity maximum of the wavelength of the reflective electromagnetic radiation.<br>
The materials of the transparent layers of the reflection layer system consist of or contain e.g. oxides, nitrides, fluorides, sulphides etc. of alkali metals e.g. Li, Na, K, earth alkali metals e.g. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, semi-metals e.g. Si, transitional metals e.g. Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Te, Ru, Rh, Pd, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, lanthanoids e.g. La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Dy, Yb, Lu etc. We cite here namely SiOx where x has a significance from 1.1 to 2.0 and preferably 1.8, AI2O3, MgF2, Ti02, B2O3, Be-oxide, ZnO, Sn02,  indium tin oxide (ITO) , CdS, CdTe and hafnium and<br>
zirconium  oxide.  Advantageously,  at  least  one  of  the<br>
transparent layers with the exception of the protective layer contains materials other than that of the protective layer itself.<br>
All or individual layers of the reflection layer system and the reflection layer can for example be applied to the reflector body or the pretreatment layer thereon by means of gas or vapour deposition in vacuum (physical vapour deposition, PVD), thermal vaporisation, electron beam vaporisation with or without ion support, sputtering in particular magnetron sputtering, plasma polymerisation or<br><br>
chemical vapour deposition (CVD) with or without plasma support. Other application methods are paint or dip-drawing processes of solutions produced in the sol-gel process with subsequent drying, flame pyrolytic processes or flame coating by means of Si02. Two or more processes can also be<br>
combined. E.g. PVD layers can be supplemented with a flame coating with Si02. The said reflection layer systems are for<br>
example described in detail in EP 918 236 Al.<br>
The protective layer is suitably a sol-gel lacquer produced according to the sol-gel process and applied to the reflector body surface, the pretreatment layer or where applicable the reflection layer or the reflection layer system.<br>
The sol-gel lacquer is preferably a polysiloxane produced from an alcoholic silane solution in particular alkoxysilane solution, and a colloidal silicic acid solution. The polysiloxane is produced in particular by a condensation reaction between hydrolysed and cross-linked silanes in particular alkoxysilane and colloidal silicic acid.<br>
The condensation reaction between hydrolysed silanes, in particular alkoxysilane, and hydrolysed silanes, in particular alkoxysilane, and colloidal silicic acid leads to the formation of an inorganic network of polysiloxanes. At the same time organic groups in particular alkyl groups or simple alkyl groups by way of carbon bonding are integrated in the inorganic network. The organic groups or alkyl groups, however, do not participate directly in the polymerisation or cross-linking of the siloxanes i.e. they do not serve to form an organic polymer system but are merely for functionalisation. The function is that the organic groups, in particular the alkyl groups, are attached to the outsides of the polysiloxane during the sol-gel process and as a result form an externally water-repellent layer which gives the sol-gel lacquer a pronounced hydrophobic property.<br><br>
The sol-gel process described leads as stated by targeted hydrolysis and condensation of alkoxides of the silicon and silicic acid to a sol-gel lacquer of an inorganic network with integral alkyl groups. The resulting polysiloxanes can therefore be classified rather as inorganic polymers.<br>
In the production of a preferred embodiment of a sol-gel lacquer as a protective coating suitably two basic solutions A and B are used.<br>
Solution A is an alcoholic solution of one or more different alkoxysilanes where the alkoxysilanes are present in a water-free medium in non-hydrolysed form. A suitable solvent is an alcohol e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl alcohol and preferably isopropyl alcohol.<br>
The alkoxysilanes are described by the general formula XnSi(0R)4_n in which "R" is a simple alkyl, preferably of the<br>
group comprising methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. "X" is suitably also an alkyl preferably of the group comprising methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl. Suitable alkoxysilanes are for example tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and preferably tetramethoxysilane (TEOS) and methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS) and further alkoxysilanes.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment solution A is prepared from tetramethoxysilane (TEOS) and/or methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS) with a methyl, ethyl or propyl alcohol and in particular with an isopropyl alcohol as solvent. Solution A can for example contain 25 to 35 w.% (weight %) , in particular 30 w,%, TEOS and 15 - 25 w,%, in particular 20 w.%, MTMOS, both dissolved in 40 - 60, w.% in particular 50 w.%, isopropyl alcohol.<br>
Solution B contains colloidal silicic acid dissolved in water. In a suitable embodiment solution B is adjusted by means of acid, preferably by means of nitric acid (HNO3) , to<br><br>
a pH value between 2.0 and 4, preferably between 2.5 - 3.0, and in particular 2.7,<br>
The silicic acid used is suitably a silicic acid stabilised in the acid environment where the pH of the silicic acid is advantageously 2 - 4. The silicic acid is advantageously as low in alkali as possible. The alkali content (e.g. Na20) of<br>
the silicic acid is preferably less than 0.04 w.%.<br>
Solution B contains for example 70 - 80 w.%, in particular<br>
75 w.%, water as solvent and 20 - 30 w.%, in particular 25<br>
w.%, colloidal silicic acid. Solution B is preferably set by means of nitric acid (HNO3) to a pH value between 2.0 - 3.5,<br>
preferably between 2,5 - 3.0, and in particular 2.7. A preferred silicic acid solution is for example sold by the company Nissan Chemical Industries Ltd. with the product name "SNOWTEX R 0".<br>
The merging and mixing of the two basic solutions A and B in the presence of the nitric acid leads to a hydrolysis reaction between the water contained in solution B and the alkoxysilanes contained in solution A.<br>
Hydrolysis reaction: Si{OR)n + nH20  &gt; Si(OH)n + nR(OH)<br>
At the same time a condensation reaction occurs in which, under water splitting from two Si-OH groups, a siloxane bonding (Si-O-Si) is created. Under continuous polymerisation a network of polysiloxanes results, to which are linked alkyl groups. The new mixed solution is present in a gel state.<br>
The two solutions A and B are mixed, preferably in a weight ratio of 7 : 3 parts.<br>
The sol-gel lacquer is suitably applied or deposited in gel form on the reflector body or on the corresponding surface and then dried or hardened. The drying process consists of<br><br>
  the remaining water and alcohols in the sol-gel lacquer which causes the sol-gel lacquer to harden and a weatherproof and corrosion-resistant protective layer results on the reflector surface or reflection coating,<br>
'coating is performed suitably in a continuous process by for example brushing, rolling, centrifuging, spraying, dipping   Clip-drawing processes. Particularly preferred continuous coating processes are the band-pass process or band painting process also known as the coil coating process.<br>
The layer thickness of the hardened sol-gel lacquer is for  example at least 1 µm, preferably at least 2 µm and for example maximum 40 µm, further preferably maximum 20 µm, in prticular maximum 10 µm and advantageously maximum 6 µm.<br>
The reflector coated with the sol-gel lacquer is suitably   or hardened by radiation e.g. UV radiation, electron   laser radiation or by means of heat radiation   IR radiation, or by means of convection heating or a   of the said drying or hardening processes-<br>
The increased temperature measured on the reflector body to<br>
dry   or harden the sol-gel lacquer is suitably greater than<br>
  preferably  greater  than  150°C  and  in  particular<br>
  than 200°C. The increased temperature is further<br>
suitably less than 400°C, preferably less than 350°C and in<br>
  less than 300°C. The increased temperature is referably between 250°C and 300°C. The temperature given is   metal temperature" (PMT).<br>
increased temperature can act for example on the body   5 seconds to 2 minutes. The sol-gel lacquer is dried or derdened during a time of preferably less than 90 seconds,   particular less than 60 seconds and preferably more than   seconds, in particular more than 30 seconds. When IR   is used the drying times are in the lower range of the duration times given.<br><br>
  heating  can  suitably  be  applied  by  the   of heated gases e.g. air, nitrogen, noble gases<br>
or mixtures thereof. The sol-gel lacquer is preferably dried<br>
in a passage oven.<br>
The reflectors, for example in the form of films, strips or sheetS, can be deformed even after application and drying of the protective layer. The reflectors can for example be processed into parabolic troughs, Deformation leads to   any crack formation in the protective layer.<br>
the reflectors according to  the invention have a good protective effect against weather influences,  corrosion,<br>
  degradation or abrasion or have a high scratch resistance. Chalking practically does not occur. As in production of the siloxanes colloidal silicic acid is used,   layer thicknesses in the micrometer range can be produced at which during the drying and hardening process no   formation occurs e.g. due to volume contraction.<br>
  the reflectors according to the invention allow the   of aluminium alloys without these needing to be plated   coated with pure or purest aluminium in order to achieve high brilliance and total reflection values. In contrast to<br>
  of pure or purest aluminium, those according to   invention have considerably higher strength which is   for a wide range of applications.<br>
The reflector has a total reflection to DIN 5036 part 3, in<br>
  a total reflection in the visible and infrared   range, of more than 7 5%, preferably more than   and in particular more than 83%.<br>
  the  reflector  contains  an  additional  reflection-  layer system, the said total reflection is more than 75%, preferably more than 85%, and in particular more<br>
than 90%.<br><br>
The reflector furthermore has brilliance values in the   wavelength range to DIN 6753 0 of over 75%, in particular over 80%.<br>
The said total reflection and brilliance of the reflector according to the invention, for example after 3000h QUV test<br>
and in particular after 200Oh QUV test, diminishes by less<br>
than 5%, and in particular by less than 2%.<br>
The QUV test is an artificial weathering test to assess the weather resistance of components and their surfaces in the open air. The QUV test was introduced in 1969 by the company "Q Panel" and today is an internationally standardised test method. The QUV test used in the present experiments was performed in accordance with the specifications of "Standard practice for operating light and water exposure apparatus ifluorescent UV condensation type) for exposure of non-metallic  metals" by the American Society for Testing and materials or ASTM G 53-96.<br>
Furthermore, in the lOOOh "filiform corrosion test" to DIN EN ISO 3665, the reflector according to the invention showed NO corrosion phenomena. In addition, the reduction in total reflection and brilliance in the lOOOh "acetic acid saline apray test" to DIN 50021 ESS was less than 5%, in particular Less than 2%.<br>
furthermore,  the reflectors  according to the  invention, thanks to the sol-gel protective layer of polysiloxanes, the a high surface hardness.

On the basis of an example the preparation and production of a particularly preferred embodiment of a sol-gel lacquer is described below. For this a solution A and a solution B are<br>
prepared:<br>
  A contains: 5 0 w.%    isopropyl alcohol 3 0 w.%   tetramethoxysilane (TEOS) 2 0 w.%   methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMOS)<br>
  B contains: 7 5 w.%   water<br>
25 V7.%    colloidal silicic acid. The pH value of solution B is set by addition of an acid, in<br>
  nitric acid (HNO3), to around 2.7,<br>
  sol-gel  lacquer is produced and the reflector body   in the preferred embodiment as follows:<br>
  basic solution A as described above, in a proportion of oof the mixed solution, is added under agitation a .: .solution a proportion of 30 w.% of the mixed solution. , iutions A and B are transferred to a mixed solution under<br>
  agitation  whereby  reaction-induced  heat  is<br><br>
 released.<br>
The mixed solution is agitated for a particular time for example for 1 hour to 10 hours, preferably 4 to 8 hours, in particular for around 6 hours.<br>
The mixture is then filtered. The filter' serves to retain larger particles e.g. particles of colloidal silicic acid. The pore diameter or mesh width of the filter depends on the desired layer thickness as particles of greater diameter than the target layer thickness have a harmful effect on the surface quality of the protective layer. Filtration can for example take place by means of polypropylene filters with a porosity of 1 |im.<br>
The mixed solution is suitably held at a pH value of 2 -.4, preferably 2 to 3.5, in particular 2.5 to 3 and particularly preferably 2,7. The pH value is adjusted by means of acid,<br>
preferably by means of nitric acid.<br>
After conclusion of the agitation process the sol-gel lacquer can be applied by means of one of the said processes t the reflector body or the layers lying thereon and then tried  or hardened as described above.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the production process the . to-gel lacquer after its production and before application<br>
to the reflector body is allowed to rest for a few minutes<br>
to    several hours, preferably between 1 and 24 hours,  in particular  between  12  and  22  hours  and  particularly<br>
perferably for around 17 hours.<br>
element analysis of the hardened sol-gel lacquer by means of kps   (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) shows for example the elements oxygen, silicon and around 5 - 20% (atomic percent)<br>
•carbon .<br>
