				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A process and catalyst for the direct oxidation of an olefin having three or more carbon atoms, such as propylene, by oxygen to the corresponding olefin oxide, such as propylene oxide. The process involves contacting the olefin with oxygen under reaction conditions in the presence of hydrogen and in the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst comprises gold on a titanosilicate, preferably a microporous or mesoporous titanosilicate, such as, TS-1, TS-2, Ti-beta, Ti-ZSM-48, or Ti-MCM-41. Selectivity to the olefin oxide is high at good conversions of the olefin. The catalyst is readily regenerated, and the time between catalyst regenerations is long.</td>

an overhead stirrer. After one-half of the TPAOH had been added, the TEOS solution was cloudy and began to thicken. Within five minutes the solution froze completely. At this point the remainder of the TPAOH was added, the gel was broken up with a spatula, and stirring was resumed. Deionized water (354 g) was added, and the solution was warmed to room temperature. After 5 hr the solids had largely dissolved, and an additional quantity of deionized water (708 g) was added. Stirring was continued overnight yielding a clear yellow synthesis gel containing no solids.<br>
The synthesis gel was poured into a 1 gallon (3.785 liters) stainless steel autoclave and sealed. The autoclave was heated to 120°C and then gradually to 160°C where it was kept for 6 days. The reactor contents were stirred at all times. At the end of the reaction period, the autoclave was cooled and a milky white suspension was recovered. The solids were recovered, washed, centrifuged, and resuspended in deionized water. The solids were filtered, dried at room temperature, heated slowly to 550°C, and calcined thereat for 8 hr. The solid was identified as having an MFI structure, as determined by XRD. Raman spectra did not reveal any known crystalline titania phase. A Si/Ti atomic ratio of 100 was found, as measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Yield of titanium silicalite-1: 106 g.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process of preparing an olefin oxide comprising contacting an olefin having at least three carbon atoms with oxygen in the presence of hydrogen and an optional diluent, and in the presence of a catalyst comprising gold on a titanosilicate, wherein the contacting occurs at a temperature greater than 20°C and less than 250°C sufficient to produce the olefin oxide.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of preparing a catalyst composition comprising gold on a titanosilicate, the method comprising contacting the titanosilicate with a solution containing a gold compound, wherein the pH of the solution is between 5 and 11, at a temperature between 20°C and 80°C; and thereafter recovering the solids and calcining the solids under air or under a reducing atmosphere or heating the solids in an inert atmosphere at a temperature between 250°C and 800°C.<br><br>
Example 1. Preparation of Epoxidation Catalyst<br>
Titanium silicalite TS-1 (10.042 g) having a SiyHTi atomic ratio of 100, prepared as described hereinabove, was added to an aqueous solution of chloroauric acid, HAuCI/3H20 (0.4829 g in 50 ml water). The pH was adjusted to between 7 and 8 by adding sodium carbonate. Magnesium nitrate, Mg(N03)26H20 (1.97 g), was added as was more sodium carbonate until the pH was between 7 and 8. The total amount of sodium carbonate used was 0.62 g. The mixture was stirred overnight. A solid product was filtered, and the filtercake was washed 3 times with 150 ml of water. The wet filtercake was dried at 100°C for 2 hr. The dried solid was heated over an 8 hr period to 400°C and then calcined under air at 400°C for 5 hr to yield an epoxidation catalyst comprising gold on TS-1. Catalyst composition as determined by neutron activation analysis (NAA) was the following: Au, 1.07, Si 41.0, Ti 0.77, Mg 0.21, and Na 0.31 percent. The average gold particle size was 35 A, as determined by TEM. Example 2. Oxidation of Propylene to Propylene Oxide<br>
The epoxidation catalyst of Example 1 was tested in the direct oxidation of propylene to propylene oxide. The catalyst (5 cc) was loaded into a 10 cc fixed-bed, continuous flow reactor with flows of helium, oxygen, hydrogen, and propylene. Total flow rate was 150 cc/min (or GHSV 1,800 hr'1). Feedstream composition was 5.0 mole percent hydrogen, 10.5 mole percent oxygen, and 53.6 mole percent propylene, the balance being helium. Propylene, oxygen and helium were used as pure streams; hydrogen was mixed with helium in a 20 H/80 He (v/v) mixture. Pressure was atmospheric; reactor temperature ranged from 50°C to 165°C. Products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Chrompack™ Poraplot™ S column, 25 m) with the results shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
