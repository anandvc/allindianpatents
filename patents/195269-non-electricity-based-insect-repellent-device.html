				<td>INSECT REPELLENT DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION   	<br>
The present invention relates to a non-electriciby based. insect repellent device capable of being used without electricity, said device comprising a holding means for holding an insect repellent / insecticidal material/mat, said holding means being provided with a plurality of connecting means which being connected to the holding means at one end and other end being free for placing the holding means at a place where it receives indirect heat from a heating source.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART DESCRIPTION<br>
In our country the major mosquito-bome diseases are malaria, filaria, Japanese encephalitis, dengue etc. Although some of these diseases are confined to some pockets in the form of endemic diseases, mosquito nuisance is almost everywhere. To control mosquito and mosquito-bome diseases, a lot of research has been done which has yielded two major developments i.e. Bacillus thuringiensis isralensis H-14 (Bu) toxin and Deltamethrin &amp; Allethrin group of synthetic pyrethroids.<br>
Of these Allethrin is very widely used in Mosquito-Mats and being produced by several companies. Today it has become almost an essential commodity in urban situation. "Prevention is always better then cure". These mats are used in urban situations where electricity is available.<br>
The operation of the insect repellent device are well described in Indian Patents 179304,182900 and US Patents 5,700,430 and 6,033,212. However, it should be noted that all these insect repellent devices require electricity for their operation. Many a times when there is no power supply people are compelled to open their windows since fans do not work and mosquitoes enter the houses.<br>
The use of mats in urban situation has become a traditional approach to protect from mosquito<br>
nuisance. In the situation of power failure, no protection is achieved since proper heating of mats is not<br>
possible.<br>
 Field of industry:<br>
1.	Use of mats is not seasonal, it is used 365 days in a lot of households.<br>
2.	There are continuing developmental projects going on in our country, which are causing more and mote mosquitogenic conditions and spread of mosquito-bome diseases in newer areas.<br>
3.	Each city is expanding and building construction work which is going on and will go-on since people from rural areas are migrating to cities.<br>
4.	Since every city has limited water resources, in future the supply of water day by day will be low and erratic. People will be compelled to store water, which is going to increase Ae. aegypti prevalence and incidence of dengue.<br>
5.	Similarly, development of any city will increase more breeding of An. stephensi. ft is also associated with the migration of poor people from malaria endemic rural areas to the cities, which is going to increase parasite load in the community in future.<br>
6.	The developing cities have more growing peripheral areas, leading to more pressure on sanitary drainage, which are suited and designed for a particular size of population. To combat this, practically each house in the periphery has septic tanks. This is leading to tremendous breeding of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Arm. subalbatus in open drainage and septic tanks. These mosquitoes are highly resistant to most of the present insecticides. This in turn is increasing filariasis in cities and towns. Though the peripheral areas are in the corporation limits, but they retain rural characteristic. Therefore no proper mosquito control measures can be taken.<br>
7.	The development of cities are increasing the slum areas, thus parasite load in the community for filariasis is increasing. Due to more slum areas more open drainages and gutters are avaible for mosquito breeding, which is leading to more filariasis cases.<br>
Drawbacks of prior art: The lacunae in the present form of product are as follows:<br>
1.	advertisements have taught people to use it in the nighttime to combat malaria They do not mention that dengue is spread by Aedes aegypti mosquito, which bites during daytime. One has to protect himself from mosquito in the day also, so that its use will increase not only in the houses but also in all the offices and work places. It means every one will have to use two mats everyday and this itself doubles the sell in urban areas. More and more people will be protected so that the producer is benefited and masses are benefited.	<br>
2.	even a single infective bite of Ae. aegypti is enough to cause dengue. One case in the house can be the cause of infection in entire household if the vector mosquito is prevalent.<br>
3.	mosquito Ae. aegypti breeds inside the houses. Since being highly antropophilic mosquitoes<br>
they are always very close to human being and protection from them in dengue endemic<br>
4. in India electricity is available to a limited percentage of population (Approx. 30-35%), where these mats are being sold and are being used by many people. Except for few big cities, the electric supply is erratic. In the situation of power failure, no protection is achieved since proper heating of mats is not possible. On the other hand, people are compelled to open windows since fans do not work and mosquitoes get entry into the houses. When there is a power failure, people light either candles or kerosene oil lamps. The Applicants in the present application have found a novel insect repellent device which is capable of limitation of presently available device. OBJECTS OF THE INVETNION<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide   an insect repellent device   capable of being used without electricity. STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the drawings accompanying the specification,<br>
Figure 1 shows the insect repellent device.<br>
Figure 2 shows the placement of the insect repellent device from the heat source.<br>
The invention is further described with reference to the preferred embodiments which are given by way of illustration and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention any manner.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the present application, the Applicants suggest using a novel insect repellent device capable of being operated using Kerosene oil lamps, which are universally used in villages and urban situations in the absence of electricity. When there is a power failure people light either candles or Kerosene oil lamps for illumination. This way people in rural areas and in the case of power failure in urban situation will be able to get protection form mosquito bites.<br>
In the present application, the Applicants describe an easy way to overcome the problem of using the mats in absence of electricity. The Applicants suggest a modification in the existing method, which will use Kerosene lamp to heat mosquito mats. The insect repellent device contains a circular curved metal plate (1) of a diameter of about 2cm. Two strips of perforated aluminum strips (2) are attached to the metal plate. These strips can be bent as required The central metal plate contains a thin asbestos sheet on<br>
which a circular mosquito mat can be fitted. The insect repellent device is shown in Figure 1.<br>
The strips are bent as shown in figure 2. The whole device with the mosquito repellent mat hangs on the open portion of the oil lamp (3), which acts as the heating source in this case. Burning oil flame heats the metal plate. The asbestos sheet prevents direct heating of mat thus slow heating of the mat helps in getting longer effect of the mat as in the case of electrically heated mats. The Applicants have found that better results are obtained when the distance between the flame and the metal plate is kept between 1 to 10 cm as shown in figure 2.<br>
Circular mats made of good cardboard which have more compound retention time will enhance the effectiveness of the device.<br>
The present device can also be used with other heating device such as Candles petermos light etc with suitable modifications and suitable placement of the holding device from the flame.<br>
The existing commercial mat products available in the market can additionally supply the aluminum<br>
BISC holders as an aluminum coil stand is supplied along with the mosquito coils.<br>
Advantages of Invention<br>
•	This will increase sell of mosquito mats in urban areas.<br>
•	This will open avenue for sell of mosquito mats in rural areas where electricity is not available and people do not want to bum traditional mosquito coils.<br><br><br><br><br>
