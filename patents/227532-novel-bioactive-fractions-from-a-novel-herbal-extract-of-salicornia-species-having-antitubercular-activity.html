				<td>HERBAL    EXTRACTS    OF    SALICORNIA    SPECIES,    PROCESS    OF PREPARATION THEREOF, USE THEREOF AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel extracts of Salicornia species. The present invention particularly relates to novel extracts of Salicornia species which show anti-tubercular activity. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of novel extracts of Salicornia species with anti-tubercular activity and also to the use thereof for the treatment of tuberculosis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Antitubercular chemotherapeutic drugs presently used all over the world comprise primarily of synthetic drugs, e.g., Isoniazid (i.e. Isonicotinic acid hydrazide) used singly or in combination with sodium PAS (Sodium para amino salicylate), Isonex, Erbazide (Calcium methane sulfonate of Isoniazid), Cyclocerine, Morphazinamide hydrochloride, Rifampicin, Ethambutol/ Myambutol, Sparfloxicin etc. which were developed subsequent to the synthesis of the antibiotic Streptomycin.<br>
While there are cures for tuberculosis by using the above mentioned drugs along with the BCG vaccination, several drawbacks are noticed, especially in terms of side effects of such drugs, the requirement of prolonged intake/duration of therapy. Another problem observed is that even after treatment, some mycobacterium continue to reside in the subject. It is therefore imperative to create alternatives to the above class of drugs so that either the dosage or the intake duration is reduced or the problem of resistance to the drugs is obviated.<br>
Reference is made to Usha K. et al., who in a paper entitled "Antitubercular potential of selected plant materials" in Journal of Medicinal and Aromatic plant Sciences, 111 4A-23/ 1A, 182-184 (Eng.)(2001), describe the anti-tubercular potential of the plants viz., neem, tulsi, garlic, ginger and adhatoda, which were tested by in-vitro culture using 100 mL of aqueous puree (50 % w/v) of plant material added to sputum and then inoculated in to LJ medium. All the plant extracts arrested the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which was ascribed to enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidants such as Catalase, peroxidase, total carotene, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, and polyphenols thus preventing tissue damage by ROS (reactive oxygen species). Besides the large quantity of potion that needs to be applied, it is unclear as to the extent of inhibition and the MIC of the potion.<br>
Reference is made to N. Lall et al. in a paper entitled "In vitro inhibition of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by ethno-botanically selected South African plants" in Journal of Ethno pharmacology, 66, 347-354 (1999), which describes the preliminary screening of 20 South African medicinal plant extracts against a drug-sensitive strain, H37Rv, of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by agar plate method (Middlebrook and Cohn, 1958). Herein the author ascribes 14 out of 20 acetone extracts showing inhibitory activity at concentration of 500 (ig/ml whereas acetone as well water extracts of plant species namely Cryptocarya latifolia, Euclea natalensis, Helichrysum melanacme, Nidorella anomala and Thymus vulgaris indicated MIC of 100 |J.g/ml against H37Rv strain by radiometric method.<br>
Reference is also made to Cantrell, Charles L. et al. in a review article entitled "Antimycobacterial plant terpenoids" in Journal of Planta Medica, 67(8), 685-694. (Eng.) (2001), which covers recent report on plant-derived terpenoids that have demonstrated moderate to high activity in in-vitro bioassays against M. tuberculosis. In this review, mono-, sesqui-, di- and triterpenes &amp; sterols, their structural analogue and semi synthetic derivatives have been discussed with particular emphasis on the structural features essential for Antimycobacterial activity.<br>
Reference is made to Ma, Junrui in a patent entitled "Compositions containing herbal medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis" No. CN 1265315 A 6 September, 2000, 4 pp. (Chinese) (2001), which contains the different forms of composition (aerosol, inhalant, tablet, capsule, powder, oral concentrate and liquid) for treating pulmonary tuberculosis composed of Taraktogenos, Coptis, Stemona, Cordyceps, Scutellaria, Lonicera japonica, Forsythia vahl, Herba violae, Anemarrhena, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Fructus mume, Ginkgo biloba, Anacamptis pyoamidalis Richard, Polygonatum, Glycyrrhiza, Polygonum multiflorum thunb, Brunella vulgaris, Cirsium japonicum, leaf of Thuja orientalis, Sguisorba officinalis, Heradeum, common Andrographis, Houttuynia, herba artemisiae and Magnolia officinalis. However the drawback here is the use of multiple herbs for the purpose of elucidating the positive gains of plant against mycobacterium tuberculosis and without referring to MIC level either of individual herb or collectively of the combination.<br>
Reference is made to a paper titled "Preliminary antimicrobial screening four South African asteraceae species" by F. Salie, PFK Eagles and HMJ Leng in a Journal of Ethanopharmacology 52(1996), 27-33 pp., wherein the author has investigated the<br>
flora of the Western Cape - a part of Cape Floral kingdom in South Africa. The author ascribes the efficacy of four Asteraceae species (Arctopis auriculanta, Eriocephalus africanus L, Felicia erigeroides DC. and Helichrysum crispum (L.) D. Don.) exhibiting selective anti- microbial activity to various degree for Mycobacterium smegmatis. Identifying the 8500 ug./ml. of MIC in leaves of Arctopis auriculanta. The drawback of the invention is the very high MIC value.<br>
Reference is also made to the Internet website <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2c4e4942494a45585f6c4f435d594502424958">[email&#160;protected]</a> on Salicornia plant. Where the use of the Salicornia plant as a source of edible oil and use of dried crushed stems as fuel briquettes or particleboard are reported. However, there is no mention of any bioactivity of the plant.<br>
Reference is also made to US Patent Application No. 101063 34 dt.26th March 2002 by P.K.Ghosh et. al. wherein a vegetable salt preparation from residual dry matter after removal of seeds using the halophyte has been described to maximize the value derived from the plant. However this application does not provide any utilization of the plant for drug/medicinal purpose.<br>
Reference is made to Wealth of India, vol. IX RH-SO which documents various bioresources of India and application thereof has listed Salicornia Linn, and its taxonomy beside use of the species as fodder. The plant is also listed in Flora of India by Hooker (1889), However no mention is made in both documents on any kind of bioactivity associated with Salicornia,. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

Another object is to produce an active extract from a single plant, and more preferably a single plant part.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide an active extract from a non-traditional source which also obviates the drawbacks of prolonged duration of therapy due to its high activity.<br>

The plant taxon is an annual /perennial, small erect, branched herb, 30-40 cms. in height. It has succulent and articulated stem, opposite branches and short stem internodes. The leaves are reduced to scales, forming a short sheath with rudimentary lamina and sharply pointed tips.<br>
Flowers are trinate, embedded in cavities along with the upper part of the branches. Seed spikes consist of cymes containing three flowers. The middle flower in cymes is noticeably higher than two lateral ones, resulting in at triangular conformation. Stamen one or two, style distinct, stigma subulate, embryo hook both ends pointing downwards. Seeds are erect, compressed, membranous and exalbuminous.<br>
The method of the invention comprises:<br>
1.	collecting Salicornia brachiata plant material at fully matured stage.<br>
2.	washing and drying the plant material at ambient temperature in the range of 25<br>
to 37°C while maintaining the moisture in the range of 0.5-1.5 %.<br>
3.	reducing the size of the plant material by pulverizing and selecting the material<br>
in the size range of 16-20 mesh sieve.<br>
4.	soaking the plant material in deionized water and heated up to 80-90°C<br>
temperature, and repeating the soaking step 5 times with fresh deionized water at<br>
an interval of 24 hours.<br>
5.	Concentrating the extract by conventional /herbal concentrator techniques.<br>
6.	freeze drying the concentrated extract in the temperature range of -50 to -60°C<br>
for a period in the range of 8 to 16 hours so as to recover 18- 20 % yield of crude.<br>
7.	fractionating the extract into five fractions Fl(5-15 % yield) in Butanol, F2(13-<br>
30% yield),   in 50% Methanol-Chloroform F3(34-51% yield),    in Methanol<br>
F4(9-15% yield) in 50% Methanol-Water and F5(3-9% yield) in Water.<br>
8.	Also their respective compounds present in the chromatogram developed at<br>
wavelength ranging from 220 to 254 nm, producing various peaks under varied<br>
eluant system.<br>
9.	Bioassay  and  testing  the  extract  and  fractions   in-vitro   and  in-vivo   for<br>

fractions in-vitro for anti tubercular activity.<br>
11.	Also their respective compounds present in chromatogram developed at 220 nm,<br>
producing peak under varied eluent system.<br>
According to the present invention, the plant was identified and necessary material was collected from the field at fully matured stage. This material was thoroughly washed with deionized water to remove mud, dust particles and foreign matter. The cleaned plant material was dried at room temperature under shade for a period of 3 to 4 weeks. The plant material was pulverized and sieved to obtain 16 to 20-mesh size powder, soaked in deionised water and heated on water bath at 80-90°C for 5-6 hours. The extraction cycle was repeated for five times using fresh deionised water and filtered under vacuum in Buckner funnel. All the filtrates were then mixed and concentrated using known technique to obtain crude extract. This concentrated extract was freeze dried to obtain moisture-free crude extract in the powder form. This extract was initially tested in-vitro and after several repeated positive tests the extract was further tested for in-vivo antitubercular activity. The extract was fractionated with solvent mixtures of different polarity and each fraction was tested in-vitro and in-vivo antitubercular activity. One of the active fraction was also sub fractionated and tested in-vitro.<br>
Example-1:<br>
The halophytic plant material was collected from coastal area of Gujarat near Bhavnagar district, located at 21° 75' N Latitude &amp; 72° 17' E Longitude to 21° 09' N latitude and 72° 00' E longitude at a varying altitude of 10-27 ' above the mean sea level of the Gulf of Cambay. The plant material was collected from the above site during its maturity stage in February-March. It was washed off all the debris/mud with tap water followed with deionized water. It was further processed and separated into various parts, i.e., whole plant without root, root, spikes, husk and seeds. These parts were air dried at ambient temperature. The dried plant material was powdered in mini grinding mill to obtain fine powder of the mesh size of 16 to 20 µ,. The parts were then further processed for crude extract preparation with the solvents: methanol-water (95:5), methanol-water (l:l)at ambient temperature and pure water at 80-90°C These crude extracts were subjected to bioassay for anti-tubercular activity. The results of bioactivity for many parts found are as under:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example-2:<br>
The most active extract from the example of Example-1, i.e., the water extract of root which yielded 18-20% on basis of dry material, was fractionated into 5 fractions. The first fraction (Fl) was obtained through extraction with neat butanol, the residue was subjected to extraction with methanol-chloroform (1:1) to yield the second fraction (F2), residue was then subjected to extraction with neat methanol to yield a third fraction (F3), residue was then subjected to extraction with methanol-water(l:l) to yield a fourth fraction (F4) and the residue was then treated with pure water to obtain a fifth fraction (F5) after filtration. Yields of Fl, F2, F3, F4 and F5 were 10%, 13%, 51%, 10%, and 9% respectively. All five fractions showed MIC of 25µg/ml, whereas F2, F3 and F4 show 75% inhibition even at concentration of 6.25µg/ml as compared to control. HPLC profiles of F2, F3 and F4 at 220 nm, taken on an analytical HPLC instrument using RP-18 reverse phase column and 1:1 acetonitrile/methanol isocratic eluting solvent at a flow rate of 1 mL /minute, are shown in Figure 1.<br>
Example-3:<br>
Salicornia brachiata was again collected after one year from the same location defined in Example 1. Collection was made at the same growth stage and the process of preparation of crude extract was repeated with the root of the plant as in Example 1. The extract was subjected to an identical bioassay as described in Example 1. The extract inhibited growth to M.tuberculosis H37RV in vitro at 50 µg/ml while in vivo tests showed 10-fold less load of bacilli in the lungs of mice receiving treatment.<br>
The Salicornia plant having active components was collected at fully matured stage and used for the extract preparation. The plant material is washed with tap water followed by deionized water to remove mud, dust particles and other foreign matter, dried, cut to small pieces, pulverized and soaked in the deionized water. The soaked plant material is heated on water bath at 80-90°C temp. The water-soluble extract was<br><br>
decanted and filtered. The above process was carried out for three to five days so as to recover all the water-soluble material. The filtrate was concentrated through known technique/new techniques of herbal concentrator and subsequently dried on Freeze Drier to obtain solid active extract in powder form. The active extract was fractionated in to five fractions using Butanol, Chloroform, Methanol and Water. The present process is simple, rapid, and has high and efficient recovery, thus yielding a highly active extract containing all the vital ingredients, which are effective for curing the tuberculosis disease.<br>
Specifically, the invention relates to the preparation of herbal extracts of Salicornia brachiata, an edible salt tolerant oil bearing plant, in a manner that leads to maximum    bioactivity   of   extract    against   Mycobacterium    tuberculosis    and simultaneously allows maximum utilization of the plant. Inferences/ Conclusion/ Summary of observation:<br>
In-vitro screening of antitubercular activity of plant extract or its fractions against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration<br>
The antitubercular activity of a plant extract or its fractions was determined by inhibition of growth and colony forming ability of M.tuberculosis H37Rv on 7H10 Middlebrook's medium containing OADC (B-D,USA). The medium was autoclaved and supplemented with OADC and 2 ml was dispensed in sterile tubes. A suspension of Img/ml concentration of plant extract/its fractions was prepared in DMSO (Dimethyl sulphoxide), which was added into test tubes containing supplemented medium at different concentrations keeping the volume constant, i.e., O.lml. After proper mixing, the tubes were kept in slanting position and allowed to cool and solidify. These tubes were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours to observe any contamination. If not, the tubes were streaked with a culture suspension of M.tuberculosis H37Rv (1-5 x 104 bacilli/tube). The inoculated tubes were incubated at 37°C along with two controls. One, in which no inhibitory compound was present but streaked with the same inoculum of M.tuberculosis H37Rv and second, in which a standard antitubercular compound was added at the reported minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) which will inhibit the growth of tubercle bacilli. Growth of bacilli was observed till 4 weeks of incubation. Extract/fractions containing tubes were compared with control tubes described above. Complete inhibition of growth was recorded as MIC (µg/ml).<br><br>
In-vitro antitubercular activity and MIC of plant extract or its fractions<br>
Two batches of plant extract prepared independently were tested against M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Both batches were found effective and completely inhibited the growth of tubercle bacilli at 50 ug/ml present in the medium. At next doubling diluted concentration of the extract (i.e. 25 ug/ml), partial inhibition of growth was observed and at lower concentrations there was no inhibition observed. Hence the MIC of the plant extract was determined to be 50 ug/ml. The plant extract was fractionated into different fractions (Fl to F5) as described above. All the fractions had inhibitory activity against M. tuberculosis H37Rv and the MIC was clearly 50<br>
In-vivo screening of antitubercular activity of plant extract or its fractions against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in infected mice model of experimental tuberculosis<br>
M. tuberculosis   H37R.V,   grown   on   L-J   slants,   was   harvested   and   a homogeneous suspension was prepared in Tween-saline at approximately 1-3 xlO8 bacilli/ml. Aqueous solutions of sparfloxicin and the plant extract or its fractions were prepared. Female swiss mice, bred in the animal house of Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India and weighing 1 8-20 g were taken. The mice were divided in four groups with ten mice in each group. Infection of mice with M. tuberculosis H37Rv (l-3x!07 bacilli/mouse) was carried out by injecting 0.1 ml of the bacterial suspension as prepared and described above via lateral tail vein. Treatment of mice with sparfloxicin and plant extract or its fractions was started after 72 hours post infection via intra peritoneal/oral route. The description and treatment of the four groups is as follows: Group I.    Uninfected, untreated mice Group II.   Infected, untreated mice Group III. Infected but treated with sparfloxicin at 25 mg/kg body weight for lOdays<br>
after infection.<br>
Group IV. Infected but treated with plant extract or its fractions at lOOmg/kg body weight for lOdays after infection.<br>
Mice were observed up to 35 days post infection. Mean survival time (MST), percent survival of mice, general health and appearance, body weight, bacillary load in the lungs, enlargement of spleen and lung lesions were observed as parameters to<br>
assess the effect of the test plant extract or its fractions as compared to untreated, uninfected or infected or infected but sparfloxicin treated mice. In-vivo antitubercular activity of plant extract against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in infected mice.<br>
All the mice in group I remained healthy and gained weight during the duration of observation. The mice in Group II began to loose weight after 10 days following infection. They looked weak with ruffled hairs and mortality began after 14 days of infection. All the mice died of tuberculosis within 20-22 days. The spleens were enlarged with visible lesion in the lungs. The average load of bacilli was more than 106/g of lung. All the mice in group III which were treated with sparfloxicin were healthy, gained weight and none of the mice died. The mice treated with plant extract were protected from challenge of M.tuberculosis H37Rv as the mean survival time, as compared to untreated infected group, was enhanced. 30-40% of the mice in this group survived the entire period of observation. When these surviving mice were examined, the spleen was not enlarged, there were few lesions in the lung and the load of bacilli was at least 10-fold less in the lung tissue.<br>
As a result of this invention, Salicornia which hitherto has been not studied for its bioactivity has become more commercially attractive to cultivate on saline soil for the newly identified application as a source of bioactive extract. The plant possesses bioactivity at mature stage, which allows for better utilization of the plant. The aqueous extract of the plant part has shown the highest activity, which makes the process of preparing extract more natural. The plant material retains activity when stored under ambient conditions and the extract prepared from the plant also retains total activity up to a minimum of 2 years.<br>
Fractions from the active plant extract are prepared by treating the extract successively with solvent mixtures having different polarities, with a view to enhancing the concentration of the active substance. The extracts and fractions are subjected to scientific screening against M. tuberculosis, H37Rv, both under in-vitro and in-vivo conditions. The most effective extract/fraction is identified by screening.<br>
The fractions of the invention or the crude extract can be administered as such to the patient suffering from tuberculosis or can be administered in any conventional dosage form in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as carriers, dispersants, diluents, flavoring agents and the like. Conventional forms of<br>
administration include in the form of a tablet, powder, solution, lozenge, capsules and<br>
also injectable forms.<br>
