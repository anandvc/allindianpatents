				<td>INTAKE AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM AND METHOD<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to engine diagnostic systems,<br>
and more particularly to intake air temperature sensor diagnostic systems and<br>
methods.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The background description provided herein is for the purpose<br>
of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently<br>
named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well<br>
as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the<br>
time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engines ignite a fuel and air mixture to<br>
produce a drive torque. More specifically, air is drawn into the engine through a<br>
throttle and mixed with fuel to form an air and fuel mixture. The air and fuel<br>
mixture is compressed within a cylinder by a piston and is then ignited within a<br>
cylinder to reciprocally drive the piston within the cylinder. The piston rotationally<br>
drives a crankshaft of the engine.<br>
[0004] Engine operation is regulated based on several parameters<br>
including, but not limited to, intake air temperature (IAT), manifold absolute<br>
pressure (MAP), throttle position (TPS), engine RPM and barometric pressure<br><br>
(PBARO). Traditional internal combustion engines include an IAT sensor to directly<br>
measure the IAT. In some instances, the IAT sensor may become inaccurate as<br>
a result of damage, wear and/or a number of other factors. Accordingly, the IAT<br>
sensor may be monitored to determine whether the IAT sensor reading is<br>
accurate.<br>
[0005] Some traditional internal combustion engine systems include a<br>
second IAT sensor. The reading from the second IAT sensor is compared with<br>
that of the first IAT sensor in order to determine whether the first IAT sensor is<br>
accurate. This additional IAT sensor, however, increases cost and complexity<br>
and must also be monitored for accuracy.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006] Accordingly, an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor diagnostic<br>
system may include an IAT determination module, a mass air flow (MAF)<br>
module, and a diagnostic module. The IAT determination module determines a<br>
measured IAT based on an IAT sensor. The MAF module determines a<br>
reference temperature based on a MAF sensor. The diagnostic module<br>
diagnoses faults in the IAT sensor based on a comparison between the reference<br>
temperature and the measured IAT.<br>
[0007] In another aspect, a diagnostic method for an intake air<br>
temperature (IAT) sensor may include generating a measured IAT associated<br>
with an engine using an IAT sensor, determining a reference temperature using a<br>
mass air flow (MAF) sensor, and indicating a fault condition of the IAT sensor<br><br>
when the difference between the reference temperature and the measured IAT<br>
reaches a threshold value.<br>
[0008] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0009] The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br>
[0010] FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of an internal combustion<br>
engine system that is regulated in accordance with an intake air temperature<br>
(IAT) sensor diagnostic system of the present disclosure;<br>
[0011] FIG. 2 is a control block diagram of a control module<br>
incorporating an IAT sensor diagnostic system of the present disclosure;<br>
[0012] FIG. 3 is an exemplary circuit diagram for a mass air flow<br>
sensor; and<br>
[0013] FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating exemplary steps that are<br>
executed by the IAT sensor diagnostic system of the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br><br>
application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0015] The intake air temperature (IAT) sensor diagnostic system of<br>
the present disclosure is provided to monitor and determine the rationality of the<br>
IAT sensor. A reference temperature is obtained from an existing MAF sensor.<br>
The IAT sensor diagnostic system compares a temperature measured by the IAT<br>
sensor with the reference temperature. The IAT sensor diagnostic system may<br>
determine that the IAT sensor is in a fault condition when the difference between<br>
the reference temperature and the measured IAT is or above a threshold value.<br>
[0016] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary internal combustion<br>
engine system 10 is illustrated. The engine system 10 includes an engine 12, an<br>
intake manifold (IM) 14 and an exhaust manifold (EM) 16. Air is drawn into the<br>
intake manifold 14 through an air filter 18 and a throttle 20. The air is mixed with<br>
fuel to form a fuel and air mixture. The fuel and air mixture is ignited and<br>
combusted within a cylinder 22 of the engine 12 by a piston (not shown). The<br>
combustion process releases energy that is used to reciprocally drive the piston<br>
within the cylinder 22. Exhaust air generated by the combustion process is<br>
exhausted through the exhaust manifold 16 and is released to atmosphere after<br>
being treated in an exhaust after-treatment system (not shown). Although a<br><br>
single cylinder 22 is illustrated, it is anticipated that the intake air sensor<br>
diagnostic system of the present disclosure can be implemented with engines<br>
having more than one cylinder.<br>
[0017] A control module 24 is provided for controlling engine<br>
components including, but not limited to, fuel injection, ignition timing, variable<br>
valve timing and peripherals relating to the engine operation. The control module<br>
24 may be in communication with an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor 26, a<br>
mass air flow (MAF) sensor 28, a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor 30,<br>
an engine RPM sensor 32, and a throttle position sensor 34.<br>
[0018] The control module 24 processes signals generated by these<br>
sensors 26, 28, 30, 32, 34 and regulates the engine operation based on a<br>
plurality of engine operating parameters including, but not limited to, a pre-throttle<br>
static pressure, a pre-throttle stagnation pressure (i.e., the total air pressures<br>
upstream of the throttle), IAT, MAF, MAP, an effective throttle area, an engine<br>
RPM and a barometric pressure. The control module 24 of the present<br>
disclosure may include an IAT sensor diagnostic system 36.<br>
[0019] Referring to FIG. 2, the control module 24 includes an IAT<br>
sensor diagnostic system 36. The IAT sensor diagnostic system 36 may include<br>
an IAT determination module 38, an MAF determination module 40, and an IAT<br>
sensor diagnostic module 42 in communication with the IAT determination<br>
module 38 and the MAF determination module 40. The IAT determination<br>
module 38 determines a measured IAT based on a first signal 44 from the IAT<br>
sensor 26. The MAF determination module 40 determines a mass flow rate of<br><br>
the intake air based on a second signal 46 from the MAF sensor 28. The MAF<br>
determination module 40 also determines a temperature of a reference<br>
thermistor R1 (shown in FIG. 3) of the MAF sensor 28 based on a third signal 48.<br>
The IAT sensor diagnostic module 42 monitors the rationality of the IAT sensor<br>
26 based on signals from the IAT determination module 38 and the MAF<br>
determination module 40, which will be described in more detail below. When<br>
the IAT diagnostic module 42 determines a fault condition of the IAT sensor 26, a<br>
fault signal 50 is generated and sent to an error memory 52 for later analysis<br>
and/or reported to a vehicle driver.<br>
[0020] Referring to Figure 3, the MAF sensor 28 may include a<br>
Wheatstone bridge circuit 60 including a reference thermistor R1, a second<br>
resistor R2, a third resistor R3, a measuring thermistor R4, and a fifth resistor R5.<br>
The reference thermistor R1, the second resistor R2 and the third resistors R3 are<br>
connected in series at a first leg 62 of the bridge circuit 60. The measuring<br>
thermistor R4 and the fifth resistor R5 are connected in series at a second leg 64<br>
of the bridge circuit 60. The first leg 62 and the second leg 64 are connected in<br>
parallel.<br>
[0021] The reference thermistor R1 and the measuring thermistor R4<br>
may have variable resistance and may have a positive temperature coefficient or<br>
a negative temperature coefficient depending on specific applications. The<br>
second, third and fifth resistors R2, R3 and R5 are fixed resistors and have<br>
constant resistance. The measuring resistor R4 functions as a heated sensing<br>
element for measuring the mass air flow rate. The reference thermistor R1 is<br><br>
designed for air flow measurement compensation given different intake air<br>
temperatures, and borrowed here for IAT sensor rationality diagnostic purposes.<br>
[0022] The bridge circuit 60 has terminals 68, 70, 72, 74 and 76. An<br>
input voltage V1 is applied to the bridge circuit 60 at the terminal 68. The<br>
terminal 74 is grounded. Before the intake air flow is measured, the voltage V3<br>
across terminals 72 and 76 may be set to zero to balance the bridge circuit 60.<br>
When subjected to an air flow, the bridge circuit 60 becomes unbalanced due to<br>
a resistance change in the measuring thermistor R4. This is because the air flow<br>
causes a temperature drop in the measuring thermistor R4 as a result of heat loss<br>
from the measuring thermistor R4 to the intake air. The bridge circuit 60 can be<br>
rebalanced by changing the input voltage VT to maintain zero voltage output<br>
across terminals 72 and 76. When the intake air temperature changes, the<br>
bridge circuit 60 becomes unbalanced also due to a resistance change in the<br>
compensation thermistor R1. The bridge circuit 60 can be rebalanced again by<br>
changing the input voltage V1 to maintain zero voltage output across terminals 72<br>
and 76. A second signal 46 corresponding to the input voltage V1 may be sent to<br>
the MAF determination module 40 for determining the mass air flow rate.<br>
[0023] As the mass air flow is measured, a reference voltage V2 is<br>
continuously measured at the terminal 70. A third signal 48 corresponding to the<br>
reference voltage V2 may also be sent to the MAF determination module 40.<br>
[0024] It should be understood and appreciated that the bridge circuit<br>
60 may include a different number of resistors/thermistors and may have different<br><br>
arrangement and configuration depending on specific applications without<br>
departing from the spirit of the present disclosure.<br>
[0025] Referring to Figure 4, the IAT sensor diagnostic method 100<br>
begins in step 102. In step 104, when the intake air passes over the IAT sensor<br>
26 and the MAF sensor 28, the IAT sensor 26 generates a first signal 44<br>
corresponding to the intake air temperature to the IAT determination module 38<br>
for processing. Based on the first signal 44, the IAT determination module 38<br>
determines an IAT measured by the IAT sensor 26. This measured IAT may be<br>
sent to the IAT diagnostic module 42 for rationality diagnosis. At the same time,<br>
the MAF sensor 28 may send a second signal 46 corresponding to the input<br>
voltage V1 and a third signal 48 corresponding to the reference voltage V2 to the<br>
MAF determination module 40 in step 106. In addition to determining the mass<br>
air flow rate of the intake air, the MAF determination module 40 also processes<br>
the second signal 46 and the third signal 48 to obtain a reference temperature<br>
Tref. This reference temperature Tref may be sent to the IAT diagnostic module<br>
42 for diagnostic purposes.<br>
[0026] More specifically, the resistance of the reference thermistor R1,<br>
the resistance of the resistors R2 and R3, the input voltage V1, and the reference<br>
voltage V2 have the following relationship:<br><br><br>
wherein R1 is the variable resistance of the reference thermistor;<br>
R2 is the resistance of the second resistor;<br>
R3 is the resistance of the third resistor;<br>
V1 is the input voltage applied to the bridge circuit; and<br>
V2 is the reference voltage.<br>
[0027] Because resistors R2 and R3 are fixed resistors, the resistances<br>
of the resistors R2 and R3 remain unchanged and are known. The variable<br>
resistance of the reference thermistor R1 at the measured temperature can be<br>
derived from equation 2.<br>
[0028] The reference thermistor R1 may be selected to have a linear<br>
response to a change in temperature, i.e., a constant temperature coefficient of<br>
resistance. Therefore, in step 106, the temperature Tc of the reference<br>
thermistor R1 at the measured temperature may be calculated based on the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
wherein R1(Tc) is the calculated resistance derived from Equation 2; α is the<br>
temperature coefficient of resistance of the reference thermistor R1; and R1(T0) is<br>
the resistance of the reference thermistor R1 at a starting temperature or room<br>
temperature T0 and is known.<br><br>
[0029] Since the calculated temperature Tc of the reference thermistor<br>
R1 may not accurately reflect the actual IAT, the calculated temperature Tc is<br>
calibrated to result in a reference temperature Tref in step 108. The calculated<br>
temperature Tc may be calibrated via a variety of known methods depending on<br>
the configuration and location of the MAF sensor 28. The reference temperature<br>
Tref is sent to the IAT sensor diagnostic module 42.<br>
[0030] The IAT sensor diagnostic module 42 receives signals indicative<br>
of the measured IAT and the reference temperature Tref from the IAT<br>
determination module 38 and the MAF determination module 40, respectively. In<br>
step 110, the IAT sensor diagnostic module 42 compares the IAT measured by<br>
the IAT sensor 26 with the reference temperature Tref to determine whether the<br>
measured IAT reading is rational. In step 112, when the reference temperature<br>
Tref is significantly higher or lower than the IAT, i.e., the difference between the<br>
measured IAT and the reference temperature is or above a threshold value, the<br>
IAT diagnostic module 42 may determine a fault condition of the IAT sensor 26<br>
and may generate a fault signal 50 in step 114. The fault signal 50 may be sent<br>
to an error memory 52 for later analysis and/or reported to a vehicle driver,<br>
thereby completing the diagnostic process in step 116. If the difference between<br>
the reference temperature Tref and the measured IAT is below the threshold<br>
value, the diagnostic process ends in step 116.<br>
[0031] While not shown in the figures, it should be understood and<br>
appreciated that the first signal 44, the second signal 46, and the third signal 48<br>
may be sent directly to the IAT sensor diagnostic module 42. The IAT sensor<br><br>
diagnostic module 42 may perform an algorithm similar to that previously<br>
described without the IAT determination module 38 and the MAF determination<br>
module 40.<br>
[0032] With the configuration of the present disclosure, the IAT<br>
diagnostic can be achieved by using an existing MAF sensor without any<br>
additional sensor. Therefore, the IAT sensor diagnostic system 36 of the present<br>
disclosure can reduce the costs of the engine control unit, while providing a<br>
reliable IAT sensor diagnostic.<br>
[0033] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, the specification<br>
and the following claims.<br><br>
