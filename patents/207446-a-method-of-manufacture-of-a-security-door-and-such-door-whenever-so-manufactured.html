This invention relates to a method of manufacture of a security door and such door whenever so manufactured.<br>
More particularly, the door proposed herein has a steel-wood composite structure and offers high resistance to break-in attempts, bullets fired from a gun and burglars' instruments.<br>
The manufacture of the said door involves simple and easy-to-carry out steps. The said door can thus be manufactured in the factory or even in situ, rendering the same cost-effective and economical.<br>
The security door, according to this invention, comprises a framework of rails and stiles, the spaces between the rails and stiles being packed with filler material, the two faces of the framework being adhesively bonded, respectively, to panels, each panel being composed of layers of wooden veneers together with at least one steel wire layer sandwiched between two adjacent layers of veneers, the layers of each panel being bonded together, said layers and framework being of the same shape and size.<br>
The method of manufacture of the security door, according to this invention, comprises the preparation of a framework of rails and stiles; packing the spaces between the rails and tiles with filler material: preparing panels of the shape and size of the framework, each panel being made up wooden veneers with at least one steel wire layer sandwiched between two adjacent veneer layers; adhesively bonding the layers of each panel  together ; and<br><br>
adhesively bonding the two faces of the framework, respectively, to the panels, before trimming and finishing the same<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of the various possible embodiments of the security door proposed herein<br>
Fig. 1 illustrtating in part section an assembly of the said embodiment<br>
And<br>
Fig. 2 illustrating a cut-away view of the said embodiment.<br>
A framework F of rails( which are horizontal members) and stiles (which are vertical members) is prepared. The spaces between the rails and stiles are packed with filler materials comprising at least one of the following substances: treated and seasoned wood strips, plastic extruded profiles   foams like polyurethane or phenolic or polystyrene foam. Panels P of the shape and size of the framework are prepared, each panel being made up wooden veneers V with at least one steel wire layer W sandwiched between two adjacent veneer layers.<br>
The layers of each panel are adhesively bonded together. Also, the two faces of the framework, are adhesively bonded respectively, to the panels, before trimming and finishing the same.<br><br>
The adhesive bonding between framework and panels and between the veneer layers of each panel is carried out by applying adhesives selected from natural and synthetic phenolic resins , resorcinol, cresol aldehydes, phenol formaldehyde, cross-linking PvAcs, urethane, acrylic co-polym ers.<br>
The adhesive bonding is followed by hardening with hardening agents such as phenol formaldehyde , which is novolak converted into a resol, reacting with substances selected from para-toluene, sulphonic acid, phenol, polyphenol, resorcinol, cresol, aldehydes, tanners PvAc, urethane and acrylics, ammonium a chloride or sulphate.<br>
Alternatively, the adhesive bonding is followed by hot pressing at 80 - 160 deg. C and between 18 - 28 Kg,/sq.cm.<br>
The framework is preferably made of kiln seasoned timber such as timber from plantations in order to avoid the use of forest wood for environmental reasons.<br>
The steel wire is pre-coated with an adhesive or a catalyst or both such as from natural and synthetic phenolic resins , resorcinol, cresol aldehydes, phenol formaldehyde, cross-linking PvAcs, urethane, acrylic co-polymers _ (adhesive) and para-toluene, sulphonic acid, phenol, polyphenol, resorcinol, cresol, aldehydes, tanners PvAc, urethane and acrylics, ammonium a chloride or sulphate, (catalyst).<br>
The steel wire layer is prepared by laying steel wires side by side.<br><br>
Additionally or in the alternative, the steel wires are woven together in m atrix form.<br>
Additionally or in the alternative the steel wires are prepared in mesh form to constitute the steel wire layer.<br>
The steel wires are preferably attached to each other by chemical bonding e.g. by the use of adhesives or by welding.<br>
The external lipping of the door is indicated by L.<br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitation there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the door proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
