				<td>The invention relates to new 4-benzylidene-piperidine derivatives which axe NR2B<br>
selective NMDA receptor antagonists with improved in vivo profile or are intermediates for<br>
preparing thereof.<br>
Background of the invention.<br>
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ligand-gated cation-channels widely<br>
expressed in the central nervous system. NMDA receptors are involved in developmental and<br>
plastic changes of neurons. Overactivation of NMDA receptors by glutamate, their natural<br>
ligand, can lead to calcium overload of cells. This triggers a cascade of intracellular events that<br>
alters the cell function and ultimately may lead to death of neurones. Antagonists of the NMDA<br>
receptors may be used for treating many disorders that are accompanied with excess release of<br>
glutamate or overactivation of NMDA receptor for any reason [Curr Opin Ihvestig Drugs. 2003<br>
• 4: 826-32].<br>
The NMDA receptors are heteromeric assemblies built up from at least one NR1 subunit<br>
together with one or more of the four NR2 subunits (NR2A-D). Both spatial distributions in the<br>
CNS and the pharmacological sensitivity of NMDA receptors built up from various NR2<br>
subunits are different. Particularly interesting of these is the NR2B subunit due to its restricted<br>
distribution (highest densities in the forebrain and substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord)<br>
[Neuropharmacology, 38, 611-623 (1999)]. Compounds selective for this subtype are available<br>
and have been proved to be effective in animal models of stroke [Stroke, 28, 2244-2251 (1997)],<br>
traumatic brain injury [Brain Res., 792, 291-298 (1998)], Parkinson's disease [Exp. Neurol., 163,<br>
239-243 (2000)], neuropathic and inflammatory pain [Neuropharmacology, 38,; 611-623 (1999)].<br>
Moreover, NR2B subtype selective antagonists of NMDA receptors may provide'<br>
therapeutic advantage over non-selective antagonists of NMDA receptors. The channel blocker<br>
type non-selective NMDA antagonists phencyclidine and ketamine induce psychotomimetic<br>
effects, hallucinations, dysphoria, catatonia and amnesia in man. These serious adverse effects<br>
hinder their clinical use as potential medication. Compounds belonging to this class cause<br>
behavioural abnormalities in animals, too, e.g. stimulate motor activity, induce' amnesia and<br>
impair motor-coordination. The severity of these effects in animals is considered to be predictive<br>
for the intensity of clinical side effects. NR2B subtype selective antagonists are expected to lack<br><br>
most of these side effects. In animal behavioural studies some NR2B selective compounds [Ro<br>
63-1908 in J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 302 (2002) 940-948 and Ro 25-6981 in Behav. Pharmacol., <br>
14 (2003) 477-487] were reported to increase locomotor activity while no such effect was<br>
observed with CP-101,606, another NR2B selective antagonist, and Ro 256981 by an other group<br>
[Neuropharmacology, 38, 611-623 (1999)]. Lack of locomotor stimulating effect of CP-101,606<br>
up to 56 mg/kg s.c. and 100 mg/kg i.p. was confirmed by others[Soc.Neurosc.Abs'tx. 21, 439.9.<br>
1995.]. Thus, to our best knowledge, CP-101,606 is the only NR2B selective antagonist<br>
consistently reported to lack locomotor stimulating effect. Since CP-101,606 appears to have<br>
poor oral efficacy and according to published information was investigated only by intravenous<br>
route of administration in humans, moreover it has polymorph CYP2D6 mediated metabolism<br>
[Drug Metabolism and Disposition 31: 76-87], there remains to be a great need for new NR2B<br>
antagonists with  low side effect liability (high therapeutic index) good oral efficacy<br>
(bioavailability) and good developability for therapeutic purposes, especially for oral treatment.<br>
Saturated analogues of the compounds of the present invention are described in patent<br>
No. WO 2003010159 as NR2B subtype selective NMDA antagonists. However, other close<br>
structure analogues of the 4-benzylidene-piperidine derivatives of formula (I) are unknown in the<br>
literature.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It was found that the new 4-benzylidene-piperidine derivatives of formula (I) of the<br>
present' invention are functionally active NMDA antagonists selective for NR2B subunit<br>
containing receptors. We also found that benzylidene-piperidines have in vivo analgesic potency<br>
similar to that of their saturated benzyl-piperidine analogues. Surprisingly, while the latter<br>
molecules cause locomotor stimulation at or slightly above their maximally effective analgesic<br>
dose, compounds of the present invention are free from locomotor stimulatory effect up to 40-60-<br>
fold analgesic doses. This feature may provide therapeutic advantage over NR2B selective<br>
NMDA antagonists with lower therapeutic index.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>

oxazine.ring,<br>
Z	is hydrogen or halogen atom, nitro, amino, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 alkoxy, cyano,<br>
trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy group -<br>
and optical antipodes, racemates and salts thereof.<br><br>
Furthermore objects of the present invention are' the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing new 4-benzylidene-piperidin derivatives of formula (I) or optical antipodes or<br>
racemates or the salts thereof as active ingredients.<br>
Further objects of the invention are the processes for producing new 4-benzylidene-<br>
piperidin derivatives of formula (I), and the pharmaceutical manufacture of medicaments<br>
containing these compounds, as well as the process of treatments with these compounds, "which<br>
means administering to a mammal to be treated - including human - effective amount/amounts of-<br>
new benzylidene piperidine derivatives of formula (I) of the present invention, as such' or as<br>
medicament.<br>
According to the invention the carboxylic acid amide, compounds of formula (I) can be<br>
prepared by the following process.<br>
For producing compound of formula (I), where X, Y and Z are as defined for formula (I),<br>
a secondary amine of formula (II)<br><br><br><br>
- where Z has the same meaning as given for formula (I) - is reacted with ethyl oxalylchloride in<br>
a suitable solvent in the presence of a base,<br>
the obtained ester compound of formula (HE)<br><br>
- where Z has the same meaning as given for formula (I) - is saponified with an alkali hydroxide<br>
. and<br>
the obtained oxalamid acid of formula (IV)<br><br><br>
 wherein the meaning of Z is as described above for formula (I)  or a reactive derivative of it is<br>
reacted with an aniline of formula (V)<br><br>
- wherein the meaning of X and Y are as given before for formula (I) -,<br>
then the obtained 4-benzylidene-piperidin derivatives of formula (I) - wherein the<br>
meaning of X, Y, Z are as defined for formula (I) - in given case are transformed into another<br>
compounds of formula (1) by introducing new substituents and/or modifying or removing the<br>
existing ones, and/of by forming salt and/or by liberating the compound from salts, and/or by<br>
resolving the obtained racemates using optically active acids or bases by known methods;<br>
The reaction of the carboxylic acid of formula (II) and the aniline' of formula (V), i.e. the<br>
amide bond formation is preferably carried out by preparing an active derivative from the<br>
carboxylic acid of formula (H) and this is reacted with the aniline of formula (V) preferably in the<br>
presence of a base.<br>
The transformation of a carboxylic acid into an active derivative is carried out in situ<br>
 during the amide bond formation in a solvent (for example dimethylformamide, acetdnitrile,<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons). The active derivatives can be acid chlorides (for<br>
example prepared from carboxylic acid with thionyl chloride), mixed anhydrides (for example<br>
prepared from carboxylic acid with isobutyl chloroformate in the presence of a base, e.g.<br>
triemylamine), active esters (for example prepared from carboxylic acid with hydroxybenztriazol<br>
and dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide or 0-benzotriazol-l-yl-N,'N,N\N'-tetramethyluronium<br>
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) in the presence of a base e.g. triethylamine). The active derivatives<br>
are prepared between room temperature and 0 °C. The necessary reaction time is 6-20 h. The<br>
reaction mixture is purified by column chromatography using Kieselgel 60 (Merck) as adsorbent<br><br>
and a proper eluent. The proper fractions are concentrated to give the pure product. The quality<br>
and the quantity of the product are determined by HPLC-MS method.<br>
The anilines of formula (V) are either commercially available or can be synthesized by<br>
different known methods. The syntheses of some commercially not available anilines of formula<br>
(V) and the carboxylic acids of formula (IV) are described in the Examples.<br>
As said, the new 4-benzylidene-piperidin derivatives of formula (I) of the present<br>
invention are highly effective and selective antagonists of NMDA receptor, and moreover most<br>
of the compounds are selective antagonist of NR2B subtype of NMDA' receptor. For<br>
characterization of the NR2B selective NMDA antagonist potency of the compounds we used<br>
cultured cortical neurones expressing predominantly NR2B subunit contammg-NMDA receptors.<br>
To prove their selectivity HEK-293 cells transfected with NR1/NR2A subunit combinations were<br>
used. To measure the in vivo analgesic potency and side effect liability of potent NR2B selective<br>
antagonists we used the mouse formalin and locomotor activity tests, respectively..<br>
Experimental protocols<br>
Expression of recombinant NMDA receptors<br>
To prove NR2B selectivity of the compounds, that is to investigate their effect on NR2A<br>
containing NMDA receptors, we tested the most potent ones on cell lines stably expressing<br>
recombinant NMDA receptors with subunit compositions of NR1/NR2A. cDNAs of human NR1<br>
and NR2A subunits subcloned into inducible mammalian expression vectors were introduced<br>
into HEK 293 cells lacking NMDA receptors using a cationic lipid-mediated transfection method<br>
[Biotechniques, 22, 982-987. (1997); Neurochemistry International, 43. 19-29. (2003)].<br>
Resistance to neomycin and hygromycin was used to screen for clones possessing both vectors<br>
and monoclonal cell lines were established from the clones producing the highest response to<br>
NMDA exposure. Compounds were tested for their inhibitory action on NMDA evoked cytosolic<br>
calcium elevations in fluorescent calcium measurements. Studies were performed 48-72 h after<br>
. addition of the inducing agent. Ketamine (500 µM) was also present during the induction in order<br>
to prevent cytotoxicity.<br>
Assessment of NMDA antagonist potency in vitro by measurement of intracellular calcium<br>
concentration with a plate reader fluorimeter in rat cortical cell culture<br>
The intracellular calcium measurements were carried' out on primary: neocortical cell "<br>
cultures derived from 17 day old Charles River rat embryos (for the details on the preparation of<br><br>
neocortical cell culture see Johnson, M.I.;Bunge, R.P. (1992):. Primary cell cultures of peripheral<br>
and central neurons and glia. In: Protocols for Neural Cell Culture, eds: Bedoroff, S.; Richardson<br>
A., The Humana Press Inc., 51-75.) After isolation the cells were plated onto standard 96-well<br>
microplates and the cultures were maintained in an atmosphere of 95% air-5% CO2 at 37 °C until<br>
the calcium measurements.<br>
The cultures were used for the intracellular calcium measurements after 3-7 days in vitro.<br>
The.cells at this in vitro age are believed to express predominantly NR2B containing NMDA<br>
receptors [Mol. Pharmacol. 45 846-853. (1994)]. Before the measurement the cells were loaded<br>
with a fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive dye, Fluo-4/AM (2uM). To stop loading the cells were washed<br>
twice with the solution used for the measurement (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl 2 mM CaCl2, -5<br>
mM HEPES, 5 mM HEPES-Na, 20 mM glucose, 10 µM glycine, pH=7.4). After washing, the-<br>
test compounds.were added to the cells in the above solution (90 µ]/well). Intracellular calcium<br>
measurements were carried out with a plate reader fluorimeter: elevation of Fluo-4-fmorescence<br>
and so, intracellular calcium concentration was induced by application of 40 µM NMDA.<br>
Inhibitory potency of the test compounds was assessed by measuring the reduction in the calcium<br>
elevation in the presence of different concentrations of the compounds.<br>
Dose-response curves and IC5o-values were calculated using data derived from at least<br>
three independent experiments. Inhibitory potency of a compound at a single concentration point<br>
was expressed as percent inhibition of the NMDA response. Sigmoidal concentration-inhibition<br>
curves were fit to the data and IC50 values were determined as the concentration that produces<br>
half of the maximal inhibition caused by the compound.<br>
In Table 1, NR2B antagonist potencies of the most effective compounds of this invention<br>
determined in this test are listed. The results with several known selective.NR2B antagonist<br>
reference compounds and the non-selective NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 are given in<br>
Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br>
The reference compounds are as follows:<br>

Mouse formalin test for measurement of in vivo efficacy<br>
Injection of diluted formalin into the hind paw of rats or mice is known to elicit a biphasic<br>
' pain-related behaviour measured as time spent by licking/biting of the injured paw. The second<br>
phase is generally defined as pain related events detected in the 15-60 min. time interval after-<br>
formalin injection, with peak activity at around 30 min. It is known that NMDA receptors are<br>
involved in the second phase of response to formalin injection and this behavioural response is<br><br>
sensitive to blockade of NMD A receptors [Dickenson, A. and Besson J.-M. (Editors): Chapter 1,<br>
pp. 6-7: Animal models of Analgesia; and Chapter 8, pp. 180-183: Mechanism of Central-<br>
Hypersensitivity: Excitatory Amino Acid Mechanisms and Their Control - In Pharmacology of<br>
Pain. Springer-Verlag (Berlin) 1997.] Therefore, we used the second phase of formalin test to<br>
characterize the efficacy of compounds in vivo. Inhibition of the second phase of response is<br>
considered to indicate an analgesic effect against chemically-induced persistent pain [Hunker, S.,<br>
et al.: Formalin Test in. Mice, a Useful Technique for Evaluating Mild Analgesics, Journal of<br>
Neuroscience Methods, 14 (1985) 69-76.]<br>
Male NMRI mice (20-25 g) were used. Prior to the experiment any solid food was<br>
withdrawn for approx. 16 hours but the animals had free access to 20 % glucose solution. The<br>
animals were allowed 1 hour acclimatization period in a glass cylinder (cc. 15 cm in diameter),<br>
then moved to an identical cylinder with a mirror placed behind to facilitate observation. The test<br>
substances were suspended in 5 % tween-80 (10 ml per kg body weight), and administered orally<br>
by gavage 15 rnin before the formalin injection (20 µl of 1 % formalin in 0.9 % saline injected<br>
subcutaneously into the dorsal surface of the right hindpaw). The time spent by licking and biting<br>
of the injected paw was measured from 20 to 25 min. after the formalin injection. For the<br>
determination of ED50 value, various doses (at least five) of the test-substances were given to<br>
groups of 5 mice and the results expressed as % inhibition of'the time spent by licking relative to<br>
a vehicle control group observed on the same day. ED50 values (i.e. the.dose yielding 50 %<br>
inhibition) were calculated by Boltzman's sigmoidal curve fitting.<br>
Measurement of spontaneous locomotor activity in mice<br>
' Male NMRI mice weighing 20-22 g were used in the experiments.<br>
Spontaneous locomotor activity was measured in a four-channel activity monitor. The<br>
apparatus consisted of acrylic cages (43cm x 43cm x 32cm) equipped with 2 x 16 pairs of<br>
photocells along all the bottom axis of the cage. An additional array of photocells (16 pairs) was.<br>
placed along two opposite sides of the cage at the height of 10 cm in order to detect rearing<br>
responses.<br>
Experimental groups consisted of 10 animals. Thirty minutes after the oral administration<br>
of the test compound or vehicle (tween-80), the animals were individually placed in one of four<br>
cages for one hour. Horizontal and vertical movements were determined as the number of beam<br>
interruptions for one hour at 15 min intervals.<br><br>
Mean ± SE of horizontal activity data of each group was calculated then percentual<br>
changes compared to the control (vehicle-treated) group were determined. A compound was<br>
considered to cause locomotor stimulation when its effect exceeded 50 % increase in beam<br>
interruptions. Consequently, doses defined as free from stimulatory action (LMAfree) produced<br>
less than 50 % increase.<br>
Table 3 shows the results obtained with some selected compounds of the present<br>
invention (upper table) and their close benzyl-piperidine analogues (lower table) in the analgesic<br>
and locomotor activity tests. [A = 2-(4-benzyl-piperidin-l-yl)-2-oxo-N-(2-oxo-2&gt;3-dihydro-<br>
benzoxazol-6-yl)-acetamide and B = 2-[4-[4-methyl-benzyl)-piperidin-l-yl]-2-oxo-N-(2-oxo-2,3-<br>
dihydro-lH-indol-5-yl)-acetamide] Thus, pairs 1 - A and 24 - B differ only-in the presence of<br>
double instead of single bound.<br><br><br>
Analgesic and motor activity data for the non-selective NMDA receptor antagonist MK-<br>
801 and the selective NR2B antagonists CI-1041 (Soc Neurosci Abst 2000, 26(Part 2):Abst<br>
527.4.), CP-101,606 andRo-256981 are given in Table 4.<br><br>
* CP-101,606 and Ro-256981 resulted in only 38% and 12% inhibition of formalin response,<br>
respectively, at 20 mg/kg.<br>
It can be seen that the non-selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor, MK-801 increases<br>
locomotor activity in the pharmacologically active dose range. This LMA stimulatory effect is an<br>
untoward side effect. Certain selective NR2B antagonist compounds like the reference molecule<br>
CI-1041 or benzyl-piperidine compounds [A = 2-(4-benzyl-piperidin-l-yl)-2-oxo-N-(2-oxo-2,3-<br>
dihydro-benzoxazol-6-yl)-acetamide and B = 2-[4-[4-methyl-benzyl)-piperidin-l-yl]-2-oxo-N-(2-<br>
oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-iadol-5-yl)-acetamide] described in patent application WO 2003010159 also<br>
show little separation between the doses causing analgesia and those stimulating locomotor<br>
activity. Surprisingly, the benzylidene-piperidine variants of the latter molecules, that is,<br>
compounds of the present invention do not cause hyperactivity up to very high doses (Table 3).<br>
While TIs of the tested benzylpiperidines with high in vivo potency range from 1 to 8, TIs of their<br>
benzylidenpiperidine counterparts are in a considerably higher range, between 46 and  64 or<br><br>
higher. This strikingly different profile was not expected after the seemingly minor structural<br>
modification.<br>
NR2B antagonists with large TI may be particularly advantageous for pharmacotherapy of<br>
diseases that might be treated with NR2B antagonists. Among benzylidenpiperidines there are<br>
compounds with high efficacy in persistent pain model and with high therapeutic index.<br>
Compounds of the present invention possess much more favourable profile regarding possible<br>
therapeutic use than previously patented compounds.<br>
Disorders which may be beneficially treated with NMDA antagonists acting at NR2B site,<br>
as reviewed recently by Loftis [Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics, 97 55-85(2003)] include<br>
schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, excitotoxicity evoked by hypoxia and<br>
ischemia, seizure disorders, drug abuse, and pain, especially neuropathic, inflammatory and<br>
visceral pain of any origin [Eur. J. Pharmacol., 429:71-78(2001)].<br>
Due to their reduced side effect liability compared to non-selective NMDA antagonists,<br>
NR2B selective antagonists may have utility in diseases where NMDA antagonists may be<br>
effective, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [Neurol. Res., 21 309-12 (1999)], withdrawal<br>
syndromes of e.g. alcohol, opioids or cocaine [Drug and Alcohol Depend., 59 1-15.(2000)],<br>
muscular spasms [Neurosci. Lett., 73 143-148 (1987)], dementia of various origins [Expert<br>
Opin. Investig. Drugs, 9 1397-406 (2000)], anxiety, depression, migraine, hypoglycemia,<br>
degenerative disorders of the retina (e.g. CMV retinitis), glaucoma, asthma, tinnitus, hearing loss<br>
¦ [Drug News Perspect 11 523-569 (1998) and WO 00/00197 international-patent application].<br>
Accordingly, effective amounts of the compounds of the invention may be beneficially<br>
used for the treatment of traumatic injury of brain or spinal cord, tolerance and/Or dependence to<br>
opioid treatment of pain, withdrawal syndromes of drugs of abuse e.g. alcohol, opioids or<br>
cocaine, ischemic CNS disorders, chronic neurodegenerative disorders, such as e.g. Alzheimer's<br>
disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, pain and chronic pain states, such as e.g.<br>
neuropathic pain.<br>
The compounds of the invention as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be<br>
used as such or suitably in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions (drugs)<br>
can be in solid, liquid or semiliquid form and pharmaceutical adjuvant and auxiliary materials<br>
can be added, which are commonly used in practice, such as carriers, excipients, diluents,<br><br>
stabilizers, wetting or emulsifying agents, pH- and osmotic pressure-influencing, flavoring or<br>
aromatizing, as-well as formulation-promoting or formulation-providing additives.<br>
The dosage required to exert the therapeutical effect can vary within broad limits and will<br>
be fitted to the individual requirements in each of the particular cases, depending on the stage of<br>
the disease, the condition and the bodyweight of the patient to be treated, as well as the<br>
sensitivity of the patient against the active ingredient, route of administration and number of<br>
daily treatments. The actual dose of the active ingredient to be used can safely be determined by<br>
the attending physician skilled in the art in the knowledge of the patient to be treated.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient according to the<br>
present invention usually contain 0.01 to 100 mg of active ingredient in a single dosage unit It is;<br>
of course possible that the amount of the active ingredient in some compositions exceeds, the<br>
upper or lower limits defined above.<br>
The solid forms of the pharmaceutical compositions can be for example tablets, dragees,<br>
capsules, pills or lyophilized powder ampoules useful for the preparation of injections. Liquid<br>
compositions are the injectable and infusable compositions, fluid medicines, packing fluids and<br>
drops. Semiliquid compositions can be ointments, balsams, creams, shaking mixtures and<br>
suppositories.<br>
For the sake of a simple administration it is suitable if the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprise dosage units containing-the amount of the active ingredient to be administered once, or<br>
a few multiples or a half, third or fourth part thereof. Such dosage units are e;.g. tablets,, which<br>
can be powdered with grooves promoting the halving or quartering -pf the tablet in order to<br>
exactly administer the required amount of the active ingredient<br>
Tablets can be coated with an acid-soluble layer in order to assure the release of the active<br>
ingredient content after leaving the stomach. Such tablets are enteric-coated. A similar effect can<br>
be achieved also by encapsulating the active ingredient.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can contain e.g. lactose or starch<br>
as excipients, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidine or starch<br>
paste as binders or granulating agents. Potato starch or microcrystalline cellulose is added as<br>
disintegration agents, but ultraamylopectin or formaldehyde casein can also be used. Talcum,<br>
colloidal silicic acid, stearin,.calcium or magnesium stearate can be used as: antiadhesive and<br>
lubricants.<br><br>
The tablet can be manufactured for example by wet granulation, followed by pressing-.<br>
The mixed active ingredients and excipients, as well as in given case part of the disintegrants are<br>
granulated with an aqueous, alcoholic or aqueous alcoholic solution of the binders in an<br>
appropriate equipment, then the granulate is dried. The other disintegrants, lubricants and<br>
antiadhesive agents are added to the dried granulate, and the mixture is pressed to a tablet. In<br>
given case the tablets are made with halving groove to ease the administration.<br>
The tablets can be made directly from the mixture of the active ingredient and the proper<br>
auxiliaries by pressing. In given case, the tablets can be coated by using additives commonly<br>
used in the pharmaceutical practice, for example stabilizers, flavoring, coloring agents, suchas<br>
. sugar, cellulose derivatives (methyl- or ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, etc),<br>
polyvinyl pyrroli'done, calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, food coloring agents, food laces,<br>
aroma agents, iron oxide pigments, etc. In the case, of capsules the mixture of the active<br>
ingredient and the auxiliaries is filled into capsules.<br>
Liquid oral compositions, for example suspensions, syrups, elixirs can be made by using<br>
water, glycols, oils, alcohols, coloring and flavoring agents.<br>
For rectal administration the composition is formulated in suppositories or clysters. The<br>
suppository can contain beside the active ingredient a carrier, so called adeps pro suppository.<br>
Carriers can be vegetable oils, such as hydrogenated vegetable oils, triglycerides of C12-C18 fatty<br>
acids (preferably the carriers under the trade name Witepsol). The active ingredient is<br>
homogeneously mixed with the melted adeps pro suppository and the suppositories are moulded. -<br>
For parenteral administration the composition is formulated as injection solution. For<br>
manufacturing the injection solution the active ingredients are dissolved in distilled water and/or<br>
 in different organic solvents, such as glycolethers, in given case in the. presence of solubilizers,<br>
for example polioxyethylensorbitane-monolaurate, -monooleate, or monostearate (Tween. 20,<br>
Tween 60, Tween 80). The injection solution can also contain different auxiliaries, such as<br>
conserving agents, for example emylendiamine tetraacetate, as well as pH adjusting agents and<br>
buffers and in given case local anaesthetic, e.g. lidocain. The injection solution containing the<br>
active ingredient of the invention is filtered before it is filled into ampoules, and it is sterilized<br>
after filling.<br>
"If the active ingredient is hygroscopic, then it can be stabilized by liophylization.<br><br>
Characterization method<br>
Compounds of the present invention were characterized by high performance liquid<br>
chromatography coupled to mass selective detector (LC/MS) using HP 1100 Binary Gradient<br>
chromatography system with Microplate Sampler (Agilent, Waldbronn), controlled by<br>
ChemStation software. HP diode array detector was used to acquire UV spectra at 225 and 240<br>
ran. All experiments were performed using HP MSD (Agilent, Waldbronn) single quadruple<br>
spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source to determine the structure.<br>
The synthesized products were dissolved in 1 ml of DMSO (Aldrich, Germany). 100 ul of<br>
each solution was diluted with DMSO to 1000 ul volume. Analytical chromatographic<br>
experiments were performed on Discovery RP C-16 Amide, 5 cm X. 4.6 mm X 5 urn column<br>
from Supelco (Bellefonte, Pennsylvania) with a flow rate of 1 ml/minute for Qualification. The<br>
obtained compounds were characterized by their k' value (purity, capacity factor). K' factors are<br>
evaluated by the following formula:<br>
k' = (tR-to)/t0<br>
where k'= capacity factor, tR = retention time and to = eluent retention time.<br>
