				<td>IMPLANTABLE ADJUSTABLE SPHINCTER SYSTEM<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]		The present invention relates in general to surgically implantable device<br>
	systems, and more particularly, to an implantable adjustable band system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]		Since the early 1980s, adjustable gastric bands have provided an effective<br>
	alternative to gastric bypass and other irreversible surgical weight loss treatments for<br>
	the morbidly obese. The gastric band is typically wrapped around, an upper portion of<br>
	the patient's stomach, forming a stoma that restricts food passing from an upper<br>
	portion to a lower portion of the stomach. When the stoma is of the appropriate size,<br>
	food held in the upper portion of the stomach provides a feeling of fullness that<br>
	discourages overeating. However, initial maladjustment or a change in the stomach<br>
	over time may lead to a stoma of an inappropriate size, warranting an adjustment of<br>
	the gastric band. Otherwise, the patient may suffer vomiting attacks and discomfort<br>
	when the stoma is too small to reasonably pass food. At the other extreme, the stoma<br>
	may be too large and thus fail to slow food moving from the upper portion of the<br>
	stomach, defeating the purpose altogether for the gastric band.<br>
[0003]	In addition to a latched position to set the outer diameter of the gastric band,<br>
adjustability of gastric bands is generally achieved with an inwardly directed<br>
inflatable balloon, similar to a blood pressure cuff. The inner diameter of the gastric<br>
-1-<br><br>
band may thereby be adjusted by adjusting the pressure in the balloon. Typically, a<br>
fluid such as saline is injected into the balloon through a fluid injection port to<br>
achieve a desired diameter. Since adjustable gastric bands may remain in the patient<br>
for long periods of time the fluid injection port is typically installed subcutaneously<br>
to avoid infection, for instance in front of the sternum. Adjusting the amount of fluid<br>
in the adjustable gastric band is typically achieved by inserting a Huber tip needle<br>
through the skin into a silicon septum of the injection port. Once the needle is<br>
removed, the septum seals against the hole by virtue of compressive load generated by<br>
the septum. A flexible conduit communicates between the injection port and the<br>
adjustable gastric band.<br>
[0004]	The traditional surgical technique for securing a fluid injection port developed<br>
for vascular uses has been applying sutures through a series of holes spaced about a<br>
peripheral base flange. While generally effective, suturing often proves to be difficult<br>
since adjustable gastric bands are intended for the morbidly obese. A significant<br>
thickness of fat tissue may underlie the skin, causing difficulties as the surgeon<br>
attempts to apply sutures to deeply recessed tissues (e.g.. 10-12 cm) to secure the port,<br>
often requiring 10-15 minutes to complete.<br>
[0005]	In addition to the difficulty of installing an injection port, the use of injections<br>
and injection ports for adjusting gastric bands has other disadvantages apparent to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, port-site infections are a common<br>
complication arising from the use of injection ports. In addition, the use of needles or<br>
other invasive techniques to adjust a gastric band may subject a patient to unnecessary<br>
discomfort.<br>
-2-<br><br>
[0006]	The art includes some gastric band adjustment systems that do not require the<br>
use of injections or injection ports, such as employing an electrical motor that adjusts<br>
the volume of a bellows accumulator. Power to such an implant is generally provided<br>
by transcutaneous energy transfer (TET), with control and/or feedback provided by<br>
telemetry. Such TET systems have to overcome design challenges associated with<br>
electromagnetic interference and compatibility (EMIC). In addition, a clinician who<br>
adjusts the adjustable gastric band has to invest in the external equipment necessary<br>
for TET.<br>
[0007]		Implant systems exist that employ the use of manually palpable pumps and<br>
valve assemblies in the context of penile implant systems. An example of such a<br>
system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,404,968, issued to Evans. However, in<br>
contrast to the present invention, such penile implant systems employ the use of<br>
generally linear bladders as opposed to adjustable sphincters. In addition, such penile<br>
implants provide obvious visual feedback as to which direction the fluid in the<br>
implant system is flowing. The pumps in many conventional penile implant systems<br>
arc bulbs located in the scrotum, such that the pump may be easily palpated by hand<br>
through relatively thin skin by squeezing both sides of the bulb.<br>
[0008]		Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have an implantable system<br>
whereby an adjustable sphincter, such as a gastric band, may be adjusted without the<br>
use of an injection or injection port. It would be further advantageous to have such a<br>
system that avoids the inconveniences of conventional TET implant systems.<br>
Consequently, a significant need exists for an implantable adjustable sphincter system<br>
that is percutaneously adjustable without the use of injections, an injection port, or<br>
TET.<br>
-3-<br><br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	The present invention addresses these and other problems in the prior art by<br>
providing an implantable adjustable sphincter system comprising a band, a reservoir,<br>
a valve assembly, and a manual pump that may be simply palpated to increase and/or<br>
decrease the size of a stoma formed, by the band acting as a sphincter.<br>
[0010]	In one aspect of the invention, there is an implantable adjustable sphincter<br>
system for treatment of a method condition. The system is comprised of a band<br>
configured to encircle a portion of an anatomical passageway and to resiliently<br>
receive and hold fluid. The system is further comprised of a manual pump responsive<br>
to manual palpation and a reservoir in fluid communication with the manual pump.<br>
The system is further comprised of a valve assembly in fluid communication with the<br>
band and the manual pump. The valve assembly is comprised of a first configuration<br>
and a second configuration. The first configuration permits fluid from the band to<br>
flow toward the reservoir. The first configuration also prevents fluid from flowing<br>
from the reservoir toward the band. The second configuration permits fluid from the<br>
reservoir to flow toward the band. The second configuration also prevents fluid from<br>
flowing from the band toward the reservoir. The valve assembly is operable to be<br>
manually switched between the first configuration and second configuration. The<br>
manual pump is in fluid communication with the valve assembly and the reservoir.<br>
The manual pump is manually operable to transfer fluid between the reservoir and the<br>
band in response to manual palpation when the valve assembly is in the second<br>
configuration. Thus, neither an injection port nor the use of injections or TET is<br>
required to adjust the size of the stoma created by the band.<br>

[0011]		These and other objectives and advantages of the present invention shall be<br>
	made apparent from the accompanying drawings and the description thereof.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0012]		The accompanying drawings incorporated in and forming a part of the<br>
	specification illustrate several aspects of the present invention, and together with the<br>
	description, serve to explain the principles of the invention. In the drawings:<br>
[0013]		FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic view of an implatable adjustable sphincter system.<br>
[00l4]		FIG. 2 is a view of an implanted adjustable gastric band system having an<br>
	ultrasonically activated valve assembly.<br>
[0015]		Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiment of<br>
	the invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016]		Referring now to the drawings in detail, wherein like numerals indicate the same<br>
	elements throughout the views, FIG. 1 shows an adjustable gastric band system 2. The<br>
	system 2 is comprised of a reservoir 4, a pump 6, a valve assembly 12, and an<br>
	adjustable gastric band 8. In the present example, a flexible conduit 10 connects the<br>
	reservoir 4 to the pump 6. the pump 6 to the valve assembly 12, and the valve<br>
	assembly 12 to the band 8. Each portion of the conduit 10 thus serves as a means of<br>
	fluid communication between each component that the conduit 10 connects. It will be<br>
	appreciated, however, that two or more components may be situated and/or<br>
	constructed such that the components may fluidly communicate without the need for a<br>
	conduit 10. By way of example only, the pump 6 may be integrally connected to the<br>
-5-<br><br>
	reservoir 4. In addition, or alternatively, the pump 6 may be integrally connected to<br>
	the valve assembly 12. Such types of alternate configurations of the system 2 will not<br>
	result in departure from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0017]		In the present example, the reservoir 4 is configured to hold fluid, such as<br>
	saline for example. The reservoir 4 may be made of silicone, for example, or any<br>
	other suitable biocompatible material. Preferably, the reservoir 4 will be generally<br>
	deformable or resilient. The function of the reservoir 4 relative to the system 2 as a<br>
	whole will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0018]		As is known in the art, the adjustability of a gastric band 8 may be a function<br>
	of band 8 fluid pressure or volume. In the present example, the pump 6 may be used<br>
	to increase band 8 pressure or volume when the valve assembly 12 is configured to<br>
	allow fluid to be pumped into the band 8 without allowing fluid to escape from the<br>
	band 8. The pump 6 in the present example is a silicone bulb, however any suitable<br>
	biocompatible alternative may be used. With the valve assembly 12 properly<br>
	configured, the pump 6 in the present example may be manually palpated to draw<br>
	fluid from the reservoir 4 toward the band 8, thereby increasing the band 8 pressure or<br>
	volume. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, this increase in band<br>
	8 pressure or volume will result in a reduction in the size of the stoma in the stomach<br>
	in the present example.<br>
[00l9]		As the pump 6 may be located subcutaneously, the pump 6 may be palpated<br>
	by manually applying pressure on the skin above the site where the pump 6 is located.<br>
	Alternatively, the pump 6 may be palpated by the flexing of the abdominal muscles or<br><br><br><br>
-6-<br><br>
	other bodily function. Preferably, the pump 6 should be sized to pump an appropriate<br>
	amount of fluid while not being too obtrusive to the patient.<br>
[0020]		The valve assembly 12 may be comprised of two one-way valves.<br>
	Alternatively, the valve assembly 12 may be comprised of a single one-way valve<br>
	configured such that its direction may be switched. Still other possible ways of<br>
	making the valve assembly 12 will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0021]		The valve assembly 12 is comprised of one or more configurations, such that<br>
	each configuration may dictate whether and in which direction fluid may flow through<br>
	the system 2. A first configuration may permit fluid from the band 8 to flow toward<br>
	the reservoir 4, while preventing fluid from flowing from the reservoir 4 toward the<br>
	band 8. This first configuration would thus be used when the band 8 pressure or<br>
	volume is to be decreased, thereby allowing the size of the stoma in the stomach to<br>
	increase. This flow of fluid may occur as a result of a pressure differential across the<br>
	valve assembly 12. This flow of fluid may also be made to occur by pumping. As will<br>
	be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, the pump 2 may be constructed such<br>
	that it is operable to pump fluid from the band 8 toward the reservoir 4 when the valve<br>
	assembly 12 is in this first configuration.<br>
[0022]	Alternatively, there could be a plurality of pump-valve systems such as, by<br>
	way of example only, two pumps and two valves, each being operable to draw fluid<br>
	from or toward the band 8, respectively.<br>
[0023]	Following the present example having one valve assembly 12, a second<br>
	configuration of the valve assembly 12 may permit fluid from the reservoir 4 to flow<br>
	toward the band 8, while preventing fluid from flowing from the band 8 toward the<br>
-7-<br><br>
	reservoir 4. This second configuration would be used when the band 8 pressure or<br>
	volume is to be increased, thereby causing the size of the stoma in the stomach to<br>
	decrease. In the present example, this flow of fluid would be made to occur as a result<br>
	of manual palpation of the pump 6.<br>
[0024]		It is understood that, in the present example, manual palpation of the pump 6,<br>
	while the valve assembly 12 is in the first configurations may result in fluid<br>
	circulating within the reservoir 4 and/or fluid flowing from the reservoir 4 toward the<br>
	pump 6 and/or toward the valve assembly 12. Incidentally, this flow may be in the<br>
	general direction of the band 8. Nevertheless, such flow will not result in departure<br>
	from the scope of the language defining the first configuration in part as preventing<br>
	fluid from flowing from the reservoir toward the band. Ultimately, the first<br>
	configuration would prevent fluid from flowing through the entire valve assembly 12<br>
	into the band 8.<br>
[0025]		In addition, while the manual pump 6 may be described as being manually<br>
operable to transfer fluid between the reservoir 4 and. the band 8, it will be apparent to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art that such language should not be read as limiting the<br>
invention to require the pump 6 to actually transfer fluid from the reservoir 4 into the<br>
band 8. In other words, pressure in the band 8 may be increased by the mere shifting<br>
of fluid in the reservoir 4 toward the band 8, as such shifting will cause similar<br>
shifting of fluid "upstream" of the reservoir 4 when the valve assembly 12 is in the<br>
second configuration. It is not necessary for fluid being introduced into the band 8 by<br>
palpation of the pump 6 to have actually come from the reservoir 4. Consistent with<br>
the present invention, this additional fluid may originate from any part of the system 2<br>
between the band 8 and the reservoir 4.<br>
-8-<br><br>
[0026]		A third configuration of the valve assembly 12 may prevent fluid from flowing<br>
through the valve assembly 12 at all. This third configuration may thereby prohibit<br>
fluid from flowing into or out of the band 8. In other words, the third configuration<br>
may be considered as the valve assembly 12 being bi-directionally "closed." Thus.<br>
this third configuration may be used when the band 8 pressure or volume is sought to<br>
be maintained. Preferably, the valve assembly 12 will be in this third configuration by<br>
default. In other words, it may be desirable to keep the valve assembly 12 in the third<br>
configuration most of the time, only switching it to the first or second configuration<br>
when it is desired that the band 8 pressure or volume be decreased or increased,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0027]		It will be appreciated that, without actual palpation of the pump 6, the second<br>
configuration of the valve assembly 12 may be all that is necessary to maintain band 8<br>
pressure or volume. In other words, a valve assembly 12 may be constructed within<br>
the present invention without having a third configuration. However, having a third<br>
configuration of the valve assembly 12 may be preferable to the extent that it may<br>
prevent inadvertent increase in band 8 pressure or volume. That is, to the extent that<br>
the pump 6 may be unintentionally palpated by incidental pressure on the pump 6,<br>
such as pressure caused by leaning against a table for example, the third configuration<br>
of the valve assembly 12 would prevent such unintentional palpation from causing the<br>
pressure or volume of the band 8 to increase. Nevertheless, where a valve assembly<br>
12 is constructed having only a first and second configuration, the valve assembly 12<br>
may be considered "closed"' in the second configuration to the extent that palpation of<br>
the pump 6 is required to create sufficient pressure to overcome and open a valve.<br>
-9-<br><br>
[0028]		The valve assembly 12 may be constructed such that the valve assembly 12<br>
may be switched between the various configurations, by way of a mechanism<br>
responsive to manual palpation. By way of example only, the valve assembly 12 may<br>
be constructed such that the configuration of the valve assembly 12 may be switched<br>
by percutaneous manipulation of a switch, lever, dial, button, or any other suitable<br>
switching alternative or combination thereof. Where the valve assembly 12<br>
configuration is manually switch able by such a mechanism or mechanisms, the valve<br>
assembly 12 may give tactile feedback indicating the configuration of the valve<br>
assembly 12 based on the position of the switching mechanism or mechanisms.<br>
[0029]		Alternatively, the valve assembly 12 may be constructed such that the valve<br>
assembly 12 may be switched between configurations by the transcutaneous<br>
transmission of other non-electromagnetic energy to the valve assembly 12. By way<br>
of example only, a valve assembly 12 may be constructed such that the valve<br>
assembly 12 may be switched between configurations by way of ultrasound. In other<br>
words, a valve assembly 12 may be made responsive to ultrasound such that valves<br>
are actuated or the valve assembly 12 is otherwise placed in various configurations by<br>
mechanical resonance and/or other effects created by ultrasound.<br>
[0030]		The valve assembly 12 may be made to respond differently to different<br>
frequencies of ultrasound. For example, a first frequency may actuate a first valve or<br>
otherwise place the valve assembly 12 in a first configuration, such that fluid is<br>
permitted to flow from the band 8 toward the reservoir 4, while fluid is prevented<br>
from flowing from the reservoir 4 toward the band 8. A second frequency may actuate<br>
a second valve or otherwise place the valve assembly 12 in a second configuration,<br>
such that fluid is permitted to flow from the reservoir 4 toward the band 8, while fluid<br>
-10-<br><br>
is prevented from flowing from the band 8 toward the reservoir 4. A third frequency<br>
may plate the valve assembly 12 in a third configuration, such trial fluid would be<br>
prevented from flowing through the valve assembly 12 at all. Alternatively, the valve<br>
assembly 12 may be constructed such that the valve assembly 12 is in such a third<br>
configuration by default (i.e. when it is not being exposed to a first or second<br>
frequency of ultrasound). In such an embodiment, the response, of the valve assembly<br>
12 to the first and/or second frequency may be substantially temporally limited to the<br>
duration of the exposure of the valve assembly 12 to the first and/or second<br>
frequency, respectively. In other words, the valve assembly 12 may be constructed<br>
such that the valve assembly 12 would be placed in the first or second configuration<br>
only for the approximate time of its exposure to the first or second frequency,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0031]		Alternatively, the adjustment may be enabled by a wide range of ultrasonic<br>
frequencies, relying upon sufficient strength of ultrasonic energy to avoid inadvertent<br>
enablement. Even given brief exposure to ultrasonic energy, such as for a medical<br>
diagnostic procedure wherein adjustment is not intended, integrating primary value<br>
control with pumping may ensure maintenance of fluid pressure. The ultrasonic<br>
energy may assist in overcoming static friction, for instance, within dynamic seals of<br>
the pump that enable pumping to occur, which would otherwise resist movement,<br>
[0032]		In such an ultrasonically enabled valve assembly 12, direction of adjustment<br>
may be controlled by having the pump 6 comprised of two parallel pumps, each check<br>
valve controlled to allow fluid in opposite directions with each opposing all flow<br>
when in an unactuated state. Thus, the ultrasonic ennoblement avoids inadvertent<br>
actuation of the pumps, yet specifically tailored ultrasonic sources need not be used.<br>
-11-<br><br>
[0033]		As another example in FIG 2. an electrically-powered valve controller 24 may<br>
be energized or activated by an ultrasonic frequency coming from an ultrasound<br>
emitter 20, such as with a-vibration transducer 22, and electromechanically actuate a<br>
valve or valves in response thereto, or otherwise change configurations of the valve<br>
assembly 12 in response to an ultrasonic frequency. In this embodiment, the valve<br>
assembly 12 may be coupled with or include such a transducer 22 and controller 24,<br>
along with a battery 26 as a source of power to the valve or valves. As merely<br>
providing power to a valve or valves, such a battery 26 may have a longer life than a<br>
battery that supplies power to a pump, such as those found in conventional TE'T-<br>
operated implant systems. Additionally, the valve assembly 12, including the<br>
transducer 22, controller 24, and battery 26, may all be electrically shielded to avoid<br>
EMIC considerations that are typically appurtenant to conventional TET systems.<br>
[0034]		As to any embodiment where the valve assembly 12 is responsive to<br>
ultrasound, it may be desirable to limit the responsiveness of the valve assembly 12 to<br>
certain patterns of ultrasound. That is, rather than being immediately responsive to a<br>
certain frequency or frequencies of ultrasound, the valve assembly 12 could be made<br>
such that thc valve assembly 12 will only respond to a frequency or frequencies of<br>
ultrasound being emitted in a certain pattern or patterns. By way of example only,<br>
such pattern-based requirements may alleviate concerns that the valve assembly may<br>
respond to ultrasound being emitted by unforeseen sources of ultrasound.<br>
[0035]		The process of implanting conventional gastric band systems is known in the<br>
art and therefore needs not be reiterated in detail herein. By way of example, the<br>

by reference. While the gastric bands in the above-cited patents employ the use of<br>
injection ports as the sole means to adjust the gastric band, as opposed to a pump 6<br>
and valve assembly 12, the implantation and function of the bands themselves are<br>
similar to the band 8 in the present example.<br>
[0036]		As to the band 8 in the present example, the method of securing the band 8<br>
around the stomach may be accomplished using conventional methods. The rest of the<br>
components of the system may also be implanted subcutaneously. By way of example<br>
only, the valve assembly 12, pump 6, and reservoir 4 may all be implanted anywhere<br>
convenient in the abdominal cavity. Alternatively, any or all of the components may<br>
be implanted in any other suitable location. Any or all of the components may be<br>
attached to a suitable surface within the body. Alternatively, any or all of the<br>
components may be attached to no surface within the body.<br>
[0037]		Preferably, the pump 6 will be implanted in the abdominal cavity. In this way,<br>
the pump 6 may be percutaneously palpated through relatively thick abdominal skin<br>
from one side only. The pump 6 may be placed against fascia that resists inward<br>
pressure to allow pumping by applying pressure on the side of the pump 6 opposite to<br>
the fascia.<br>
-13-<br><br>
[0038]		Once the band 8 and the components are in place, the pressure or volume of<br>
the band 8 may be brought to an initial desired level, in accordance with the initial<br>
desired size of the stoma created in the stomach by the band 8. For example, the<br>
system 2 may be implanted with all of the fluid already inside the system 2, such that<br>
palpation of the pump 6 is all that is necessary to bring the pressure or volume of the<br>
band 8 to an initial desired level, such as through an injection port 30. Alternatively,<br>
the system 2 may be implanted with less than all desired fluid inside the system 2,<br>
such that additional fluid is added to the system 2 shortly following implantation. By<br>
way of example only, where additional fluid is to be added to the system 2 shortly<br>
following implantation, such additional fluid may be added by injecting the fluid into<br>
a port on a component of the system 2. Still other ways of achieving an initial desired<br>
band 8 pressure or volume will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0039]		In use, a time may come where it is desired to have the band 8 pressure or<br>
volume decreased or increased. Where a decrease in band 8 pressure or volume is<br>
desired, the valve assembly 12 will be manually switched to the first configuration.<br>
Then, due to the fluid pressure being higher on the band 8 side of the valve assembly<br>
12 than the fluid pressure on the other side of the valve assembly 12, fluid will tend to<br>
drain toward the reservoir 4 end of the system 2 until the pressure throughout the<br>
system 2 is generally uniform. Alternatively or additionally, fluid may be drawn from<br>
the band 8 toward the reservoir 4 by manual palpation of the pump 6. When the<br>
desired amount of pressure or volume has been relieved from the band 8. the valve<br>
assembly 12 may then be switched to the second or third configuration to prevent<br>
additional fluid from escaping the band 8.<br><br><br>
-14-<br><br>
[0040]		Where an increase in band 8 pressure or volume is desired, and the valve<br>
assembly 12 is not already in the second configuration, the valve assembly 12 will be<br>
manually switched to the second configuration. Then, the pump 6 will be palpated to<br>
draw fluid from the reservoir 4 and force it toward the band 8, thereby increasing the<br>
band 8 pressure or volume. When the desired amount of pressure or volume has been<br>
added to the band 8, the person palpating the pump 6 should cease palpating the pump<br>
6. The valve assembly 12 may then be left in the second configuration, or<br>
alternatively, switched to the third configuration.<br>
[0041]		It will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the above<br>
invention has equal applicability to other types of implantable bands or adjustable<br>
sphincters. For example, bands may be used for the treatment of fecal incontinence.<br>
One such band is described in US. Patent 6,41,292, which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Bands may also be used to treat urinary incontinence. One such band is<br>
described in U.S. Patent Application 2003/0105385., which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference. Bands may also be used to treat heartburn and/or acid reflux. One such<br>
band is described in U.S. Patent 6,470,892, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Bands may also be used to treat impotence. One such band is described in U.S. Patent.<br>
Application 2003/0114729, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0042]		In summary, numerous benefits have been described which result from<br>
employing the concepts of the invention. White preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in<br>
the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only, The foregoing<br>
description of one or more embodiments of the invention has been presented for<br>
purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit<br>
-15-<br><br>
the invention to the precise form disclosed. Obvious modifications or variations are<br>
possible in light of the above teachings without departing from the invention. For<br>
example, a reservoir may include a pressure differential to the band such that one of<br>
the valve positions is sufficient to create a change in fluid volume with the band<br>
without manual pumping. A bellows accumulator within a sealed case containing a<br>
propellant that asserts a differentia! pressure is one such reservoir.<br>
[0043]		it should be understood that every structure described above has a function<br>
and such structure can be referred to as a means for performing that function. The one<br>
or more embodiments were chosen and described in order to best illustrate the<br>
principles of the invention and its practical application to thereby enable one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art to best utilize the invention in various embodiments and with<br>
various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. Accordingly, it<br>
is intended that the invention be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended<br>
