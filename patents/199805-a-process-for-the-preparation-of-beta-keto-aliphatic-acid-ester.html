				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of ß -keto aliphatic acid ester. The present invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of antimicrobial compound ß-keto aliphatic acid ester, a novel, aliphatic, fatty acid derivative from Bacillus sp. IICT - 001.<br>
Fatty acid derivatives, which are mainly of fungal and bacterial metabolites, are subdivided into saturated and unsaturated type of compounds. Previously number of compound were isolated from Bacillus sp., such as iso-13 methyl tetradecanoic acid, fatty acid (Arch. Vetr. Ital 20,215 1969) peptide (Shoji et al., J. Antibiotics activity (Aszalos et al, J. Chromatography, 37, 477, 1968). The antibacterial pseudomonic acid produced by a Pseudomonas species represents an interesting new type of fatty acid ester (Berdy, CRC Hand Book of Antibiotic Compounds Vol VI p-391 1980). It contains several unusual chemical features in this family, such as epoxy, pyran and 9-hydroxy nonanic acid constituents. These compounds are normally soluble in nonpolar organic solvents such as hydrocarbons. Hydroxy acid was isolated primarily from bacterial species (Berdy, CRC Hand Book of Antibiotic Compound Vol II, 35, 1980). Antimicrobial and antitumor activity of natural fatty acids derived from different kinds of microbes including fungi, Actinomycetes or Nyxobacteria, is a frequently reported property of such type of compounds. Fatty acid esters (Glycerides) such as monoolein, monolaurin, eoixenotid, pseudomonic acid A1-B were isolated from different microbes with varied antimicrobial activity.<br>
Cyclic acylpeptide, halobacillin from Bacillus species ll-cycloheptyI-2hydroxy undecanoic acid from thermo acidic Bacillus sp, sarcinic acid from different Bacillus sp. have been reported by earlier workers. (Comprehensive natural products chemistry Vol 8 1986).<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of P-keto aliphatic avid ester, useful as therapeutic agent, a novel aliphatic acid ester from Bacillus species IICT-001 to isolate novel antimicrobial compounds from microbes, by screening many organisms from different soil samples and isolated a new strain designated as IICT-001 to produce potent antimicrobial compounds.<br>
Another object of the present invention is the isolation, separation, purification and practical structure elucidation of a new bioactive, aliphatic, ß-keto acid ester for the first time<br>
from a new strain of Bacillus sp. IICT 001.<br><br>
Still another object of the present invention is that the new source for a new antimicrobial compound ß-keto aliphatic acid ester, showing very good broad spectrum antimicrobial activity may be used as a new antibiotic with simple isolation process and might result in a new potent source of pharmaceutically active drug.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparation of ß-keto aliphatic, acid ester, which comprises; growing a Bacillus sp.  having characteristic such as herein<br>
described at a temperature in the  range of 20-40°C and a pH in the range of 4.5-7.5 in <br>
growth medium selected from the group consisting of nutrient medium and mineral salts <br>
medium supplemented withprotein and carbon content such as soybean meal, corn steep <br>
liquor, casein, casein hydrolysate glucose, malt extract for a period of at least 3-4 days to <br>
obtain broth, extracting the said broth with organic solvent such as herein described, removing the , solvent and purifying the desired acid ester compound by conventional,method chromatographic<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the growth medium used is selected from the group consisting of nutrient medium and mineral salts medium.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the growth medium is supplemented with protein and carbon content such as soybean meal, corn steep liquor, casein, casein hydrlysate glucose, malt extract.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the growth of strain is carried out at a temperature range of 20 to 40°C and a pH in the range of 4.5-7.5.<br>
In another embodiment of the mvention the solvents for extraction of broth used comprises a chlorinated organic solvent selected from the group consisting of chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, and ethyl acetate; or a polar solvent selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol and a mixture thereof.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention the chromatographic method used comprises thin layer chromatography using silica gel as stationary phase and 1:1 methanol CHCI3 as mobile phase.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ß-keto aliphatic acid ester, a novel aliphatic IS keto acid ester from Bacillus sp. IICT - 001 a strain to produce potent antimicrobial compound, isolated in our pursuit to identify novel antimicrobial compound from terrestrial soil sample of Hyderabad. The new strain is identified based on microscopic, morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics described in tables as Bacillus sp., which was grown in soyameal supplemented broth at optimum pH and temperature and extracting the said bacterial culture broth with non-polar solvents such as chloroform and ethyl acetate in combination with methanol, ethanol to extract through the antimicrobial compound  in  a     known    manner  to     get    a    crude    fraction and purifying the<br>
antibiotic from the said crude fraction by conventional chromatography to recover antibiotic ß keto aliphatic acid ester.<br>
The new strain IICT-001 is easy to grow and maintain, and multiplies profusely on nutrient broth. The production of antibiotic is good in a conventional soyabean meal supplemented production medium constituting soyabean meal l0g, glucose 10 g, sodium chloride 5g, calcium carbonate lg, water 1 It. at optimum pH and optimum temperature.<br>
The present strain Bacillus species is a gram positive, moving rods with bulging sporangia. The temperature range for the growth is 20 - 45°C and the pH range is 4.5 - 8.0. The sodium chloride tolerance is recorded to be 4.0-7.0% Table 1 shows the colony characters while Table 2 shows the physiological characteristics such as temperature, pH, and sodium chloride tolerance. Tables 3 and 4 show the biochemical properties and utilisation of carbon source for the strain respectively.<br>

Based on the above properties the strain IICT-001 is identified as Bacillus sp. It differs from the type Bacillus sp. in the following properties. Optimum pH is 5.5-8.0, optimum temperature is 30-45°C, there is no growth conditions, The present strain Bacillus sp 001 differs from known Bacillus sp, in that it produces novel antibiotic under optimum temperature, pH and growth conditions, The growth conditions are requirement of carbon and nitrogen source along with macro and micronutrients for optimum yield of antimicrobial compound.(Buchanan and Gibbons, Bergy's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 8th ED., P.540, 1974; Sonenshein et al, Bacillus sp.. American society for Microbiol, Washington D.C.P.13,1993).<br>
The bioassay guided isolation and purification has resulted in yellow viscous, UV<br>
positive compound soluble in organic solvents as (3 keto aliphatic acid ester based on its<br>
physical and spectral properties. The spectral properties are as follows.<br>

Anti microbial Assay:<br>
All the media used are from Hi Media, Bombay, India. Bacterial strains were grown on nutrient agar and suspended in Muller Hinton broth and fungal strains in sabouroud broth. A conventional two fold serial dilution method is employed to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (Jones et al, 1984;In: Lenette EH, Ballows et al., Manual of clinical Microbiol.,972-977, Washington DC, American Society for Microbiol). The compound dissolved in acetone at 2 mg/ml concentration is diluted in respective broths in the range of 100- 1.56 g/ml culture grown at 37°C for 20 h were used as inoculum(approximately 105"6 CFU/ml). Test cultures were incubated at 37°C for 24h. All the results (average of triplicates) were presented in µg/ml (Table 5). The lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that<br>
results in the complete inhibition of microorganism represents the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC (µg/ml).<br>
The activity against the following organisms have been tested and the minimum<br>
inhibitory concentration against test microbes is presented in Table 5.<br>
