TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to construction and use of electro-chemical<br>
storage units (batteries). In particular, the disclosure relates to a low-impedance battery<br>
apparatus and methods for making and using the same.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Devices for storing and providing electrical power have been in use for a long<br>
time. Generally falling under the descriptor "battery," such devices include electro-<br>
chemical cells and collections of cells that provide an electrical potential between at least<br>
a set of terminals. The terminals can be connected to an electrical (e.g. direct current,<br>
DC) load to energize or power the load. Batteries include dry cells, wet cells (e.g. lead-<br>
acid cells), and other types of units that generally convert a chemically available<br>
electromotive force into a current.<br>
[0003] Batteries are sometimes classified into "primary" and "secondary" types.<br>
Primary batteries are single-use units that come from a manufacturer with a limited<br>
electro-chemical capacity and are exhausted and discarded after use. Secondary batteries<br>
can be "recharged" after use, and while not infinite in their capacity, allow for repeated<br>
use of the same cell through reversing the discharge process to some extent.<br>
[0004] To increase battery capacity, cells have been configured to take advantage of a<br>
large surface area between the anode (negative) and cathode (positive) elements of the<br>
cells. One such design involves placing many parallel plates in electrolyte solution to<br>
allow for ionic transfer between the anodes and cathodes. Another design separates<br>
planar layered sheets of anode and cathode materials with porous membranes, then rolls<br>
the layers into a roll, referred to as a "jelly roll" that provides a compact and mechanically<br>
stable battery. In rolled battery designs, multiple alternating sheets of anode, separator,<br>
and cathode materials are used as permitted by the spatial considerations of the battery,<br>
and the anode sheets are collectively connected to an anode terminal while the cathode<br><br>
sheets are collectively connected to a cathode terminal. The device may be rolled<br>
cylindrically or in other geometries, knows as prismatic configurations.<br>
[0005] The entire device is packaged in a rigid enclosure, usually a cylindrical can.<br>
The anode and cathode materials and terminals are prevented from making electrical<br>
contact to avoid short-circuiting or discharging the battery except through the intended<br>
terminals through an electrical load connected thereto.<br>
[0006] One problem encountered in traditional battery designs is that of the electrical<br>
impedance of the battery itself, which causes loss of electrical power and dissipation of<br>
heat internally within the battery. Another problem with present battery designs is that<br>
the ends of the cells are not well integrated into the anode and cathode terminals usually<br>
found at either end of a cylindrical battery design. Yet another deficiency of present<br>
battery designs is their inability to provide good thermal response and heat sink<br>
capabilities, especially in high-power applications. Additionally, present battery designs<br>
using collector sheets have not been successful in providing a way to connect a plurality<br>
of anode or cathode collectors together.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] One aspect of the invention is directed to an electrochemical storage device,<br>
including a coiled battery assembly comprising negative and positive electrode sheets<br>
having a separator sheet disposed between the negative and positive electrode sheets, at<br>
least one of the positive and negative electrode sheets having an edge which is<br>
substantially free of electrode active material. A conductive guidewire is positioned<br>
along the edge that is substantially free of electrode active material, thereby forming an<br>
electrode endcap suitable for connection with an electrode terminal of the electrochemical<br>
storage device.<br>
[0008] Another aspect of the invention is directed to a method of making an<br>
electrochemical, storage device, including the steps of coaxially-winding a negative<br>
electrode sheet, a separator sheet and a positive electrode sheet to form a coiled battery<br>
assembly having a separator sheet disposed between the negative and positive electrode<br>
sheets wherein at least one of the positive and negative electrode sheets has an edge<br>
substantially free of electrode active material. A conductive guidewire is disposed<br><br>
alongside and substantially in contact with at least a portion of the edge that is<br>
substantially free of electrode active material. Once assembled, the guidewire and the<br>
edge that is substantially free of electrode active material form an electrode endcap that is<br>
suitable for connection with an electrode terminal of the electrochemical storage device.<br>
[0009] Yet another aspect of the invention is directed to an electrochemical storage<br>
device, including an assembly comprising at least two electrically-complementary<br>
electrode sheets having a separator sheet disposed between the two electrically-<br>
complementary sheets, at least one of said electrode sheets having an edge substantially<br>
free of electrode active material and a conductive guidewire laid along the edge that is<br>
substantially free of electrode active material, thereby forming an endcap suitable for<br>
connection with an electrode terminal. The device can be assembled as a roll or as a stack<br>
or sandwich assembly.<br>
[0010] Another aspect of the invention is directed to a battery pack, including at least<br>
one assembly comprising at least two electrically-complementary electrode sheets having<br>
a separator sheet disposed between said two electrically-complementary sheets, at least<br>
one of said electrode sheets having an edge substantially free of electrode active material.<br>
The assembly also including a conductive guidewire laid along the edge that is<br>
substantially free of electrode active material of the at least one electrode sheet and<br>
substantially contacting at least a portion of the edge, thereby forming an endcap suitable<br>
for connection with an electrode terminal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] The following describes in detail one or more embodiments suitable for<br>
arriving at the method and apparatus described herein, and should not be taken as<br>
exhaustive, inclusive, or limiting.<br>
[0013] As mentioned previously, batteries have been formed by co-winding layers of<br>
active material (anode, cathode) and separating membrane layers in various geometries as<br>
called for by the application at hand. Some are rolled into cylindrical shapes, while<br><br>
others have rectangular or other shaped cross-sections, and are said to have "prismatic"<br>
configurations.<br>
[0014] Figure 1 shows part of a battery device 100 according to the prior art. Strips<br>
or sheets of anode 104 and cathode 108 are separated by separator membranes 106. The<br>
composition of anode 104 and cathode 108 depend on the specific type of battery, and<br>
include a layer of an electroactive material, e.g., graphite, metal, and other materials on an<br>
electrically conductive substrate. The substrate may serve as a current collector. In Li-<br>
ion batteries, LiCoO2l LiMn2O4, Li(Fe,Mn)PO4, or (Li,Nb)(Fe,Mn)PO4 are typically the<br>
electroactive cathode material. The separator membranes 106 are porous and allow ions<br>
to be transported between the anode 104 and cathode 108, but are electrically insulating<br>
and serve to insulate the two electrodes from one another.<br>
[0015] Device 100 is formed by co-winding ribbon-shaped materials 102 into a "jelly<br>
roll" 110. To provide electrical connections to the battery terminals, multiple conducting tabs 112, 114 are inserted by welding or other connections at carefully selected intervals<br>
within the structure before it is rolled up. A first set of tabs 112 are made to contact the<br>
anode material 104 and extend outward from the rolled portion 110 on one end thereof to<br>
form the anode terminal of the battery device. A second set of tabs 114 are made to<br>
contact the cathode material 108 and extend outward from the rolled portion 110 on<br>
another end thereof to form the cathode terminal of the battery device. The way in which<br>
the plurality of extended anode 112 and cathode 114 tabs or extensions are connected to<br>
each other and to other portions of the battery are a matter of design. Prior art designs of<br>
this aspect of rolled batteries have numerous shortcomings, some of which were<br>
discussed previously. These shortcomings include but are not limited to poor electrical<br>
properties (e.g. ' inpedance), poor thermal properties (poor heat dissipation), and<br>
poor mechanical and manufacturing properties.<br>
[0016] Figure 2 illustrates an anode portion of a device according to the prior art,<br>
showing a group of collector tabs 112 extending from the rolled portion 110 of a battery<br>
device. A "can" 120 houses the entire jelly roll assembly and provides the assembly with<br>
mechanical protection, prevents contamination, acts as a heat sink, and provides a cathode<br>
terminal (not shown). Again, the prior art employed several methods to connect anode<br><br>
extensions 112, but a satisfactory method that provides good electrical, thermal, and<br>
mechanical properties has been lacking.<br>
[0017] Figure 3 illustrates one way to co-wind the ribbon-shaped materials to produce<br>
the structure of Figure 1. Generally, rolls of each of the constituent materials are spooled<br>
at the appropriate feed rates and co-wound into the rolled battery structure described<br>
above. The anode, cathode, and separator materials may be provided from spools 404,<br>
406, and 402, respectively. Anode and cathode tabs are inserted using apparatus 408 for<br>
example, which welds the tabs at the appropriate intervals into the wound assembly 110.<br>
[0018] Figure 4 illustrates an embodiment of a rolled battery apparatus 200 according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention. The rolled portion 210 is shown cut away for<br>
illustrative purposes. The rolled portion 210 is formed of sheet or ribbon-shaped<br>
elements 202. Alternating sheets of cathodes 204 and anodes 208 are separated by<br>
separator membrane sheets 206. Apparatus 200 of Figure 4 includes a single cathode 204<br>
and a single anode 208. In other embodiments, however, the apparatus 200 may include<br>
several cathodes 204 and anodes 208. Anode 208 comprises a layer of clectroactive<br>
material disposed on an electrically conductive substrate, e.g., a current collector.<br>
Materials that are conventionally used in forming an anode layer of a Li-ion battery may<br>
be used in the present design, for example. Each anode 208 includes an anode extension<br>
214 that extends from the active portion of the anode 208. The anode extension 214 may<br>
be integral to or bonded or attached to the anode 208. The anode extension portion 214 is<br>
conductive and provides a way for electrical and thermal coupling to anode 208. Each<br>
cathode 204 also similarly includes a cathode extension 212 extending that extends from<br>
the active portion of the cathode 204. Cathode extension 212 may be integral to or<br>
bonded or attached to the cathode 204. Cathode 204 comprises a layer of electroactive<br>
material disposed on an electrically conductive substrate. Materials that are<br>
conventionally used in forming a cathode layer of a Li-ion battery may be used in the<br>
present design, for example. The anode extensions 214 and cathode extensions 212 are at<br>
opposite ends of the battery apparatus 200. Separator membranes 206 provide ion<br>
conductivity but prevent electronic conduction as discussed above.<br>
[0019] At one end of the apparatus 200, a first conducting guidewire 226 is disposed<br>
adjacent to a portion of the conductive anode extension 214. The guidewire 226 is<br><br>
dimensioned such that the rolled structure 210 forms a substantially tight and compact<br>
anode interface surface 222 (i.e., anode endcap 222) comprised of the coiled guidewire<br>
226 and the anode extension 214. A second conducting guidewire 220 is similarly<br>
disposed adjacent to a portion of the conductive cathode extension 212. When<br>
assembled, the guidewire 220 and the cathode extension 212 form a cathode interface<br>
surface 228, i.e., cathode endcap 228.<br>
[0020] The anode 208, cathode 204, and separator sheets 206, including the anode<br>
extensions 214, cathode extensions 212, and guidewires 220, 226, are wound together<br>
around central axis 224 to form the rolled structure 210. Any winding or stacking or<br>
layering method or design may be employed to construct the battery cell. An exemplary<br>
winding method and apparatus is depicted in Figure 9, which is discussed in greater detail<br>
below. However, substantially flat (sandwiched) layers, or layers formed by accordion-<br>
style or folded or fan-like structural configurations can also be constructed in accordance<br>
with the teachings of the present disclosure. The rolled structure 210 of Figure 4 is<br>
wound about the central axis 224. Therefore, each of the sheet-shaped materials forms a<br>
spiral (as viewed in the cross-section) about the same central axis 224.<br>
[0021] Once wound into the roll, the anode extension 214 is secured to the first<br>
guidewire 226. For example, a laser weld line or seam is applied to mechanically,<br>
thermally and electrically couple the anode extension 214 and the first guidewire 226.<br>
The cathode extension is similarly processed. In one embodiment, the first guidewire 226<br>
is selected of a material b.., the same as the material of which the anode extension 214<br>
is made. Using guidewires and extensions comprised of the same material can provide<br>
good and stable properties and welding capabilities. The anode collector extensions 214<br>
and the anode guidewire 226 may be made of aluminum, copper, titanium, carbon, or<br>
nickel, for example, while the cathode collector extensions 212 and the cathode guidewire<br>
220 may be made of aluminum or other suitable material. The present invention,<br>
however, is not limited to this choice of materials, and other catalysts or helper layers and<br>
materials may also be used as desired to improve the thermal, electrical and electrical<br>
properties that exist between the extensions 212, 214 and guidewires 220, 226,<br>
respectively.<br><br>
[0022] Additionally, the shape and dimensions of the guidewires 220, 226 are<br>
selected by design. For example, the guidewires 220, 226 may have a rectangular or<br>
other cross-section with a thickness sufficient to form endcaps in the rolled structure 210<br>
so that the guidewire provides sufficient electro-mechanical contact with the surrounding<br>
cell element extensions. Additionally, the guidewires 220,226 may be fluted, shaped, or<br>
notched in any suitable direction to have a profile allowing passage of fluid between some<br>
portions of the guidewires and the adjoining cell element extensions. In a particular<br>
embodiment, the guidewire 220,226 includes grooves or notches cut therein, or a spiral<br>
groove going around its outer surface. The grooves or notches allow gases to escape the<br>
cell under some conditions of operation, also, the grooves or notches (not shown) allow<br>
for filling or pressing the electrolyte fluid into the body of the battery device.<br>
[0023] The guidewires 220, 226 provide a low-impedance electrical connection<br>
between the terminal ends of the battery. 200 and the external circuit to which it is to be<br>
connected.<br>
[0024] Figure 5 illustrates another view of a portion of electro-chemical storage<br>
(battery) device 200. The device is shown partially rolled 210 and partially unrolled 202<br>
for clarity. Anode 208 has a conductive collector extension portion 214 extending<br>
therefrom as previously discussed, the extension 214 being substantially free of electrode<br>
active material and extending along the lower edge of the anode 208. The cathode 204 is<br>
similarly constructed (but of a different material than that of the anode 208) and has a<br>
conductive collector extension 214 extending along the upper edge of cathode 204. In<br>
some embodiments the edge of the anode 208 from which anode collector extension 214<br>
protrudes and the edge of the cathode 204 from which the cathode collector extension 212<br>
protrudes are on opposite ends of the battery device.<br>
[0025] The sheet layers, including anode 208, cathode 204, and separator sheets 206<br>
are co-wound about central axis 224. Anode guidewire 226 and anode extension 214 are<br>
co-wound with the other sheet materials to form anode conducting endcap 222 at end 230<br>
of the rolled structure 210, while cathode guidewire 220 and cathode extension 212 are<br>
similarly co-wound with the other sheet materials to form cathode conducting endcap 228<br>
at the opposite end 232 of the rolled structure 210.<br><br>
[0026] Note that the notion of co-winding the sheet should be liberally construed.<br>
That is, one or more layers.of sheet or sheet-like materials, as well as the guidewires 220<br>
and 226 are wound together onto a spool or about one another to result in a spiral<br>
configuration of each material, within which the other materials are interspersed. The<br>
exact final outcome is not necessarily cylindrical in shape, and may have other prismatic<br>
cross-sectional configurations as well. Also, being coiled, rolled, or wound about axis<br>
224 is not meant to imply that the layers form precise circular layers about axis 224.<br>
Other rolling or stacking structures are contemplated. In some embodiments the roll<br>
forms an increasing-radius spiral rather than constant-radius circular rings.<br>
[0027] Figure 6 is a portion of a cross-sectional view of a rolled electro-chemical<br>
storage device (battery) that depicts the anode extension 214 and anode guidewire 226<br>
constructed in accordance with the present invention. The cathode guidewire 220 and a<br>
portion of the cathode extension 212 have been omitted for clarity. Figure 6 is provided<br>
for illustrative purposes only and is not drawn to scale. Referring to Figure 6, graphite<br>
anode active materials 208b surround a copper anode collector 208a. The active anode<br>
material 208b and the anode substrate 208a are collectively referred to as the anode 208.<br>
The anode extension 214 is coupled to (or integral with) the anode substrate 208a and<br>
extends beyond the coored active anode material 208b. The anode extension 214 extends<br>
beyond the coated active anode element 204 by a distance sufficient to allow for<br>
installation guidewire 226 between successive windings of collector extension 214 and<br>
without having electrical contact between the guidewire 226 and the other layers of active<br>
material electrodes or separator sheet sheets 206. In the figure, a height distance of "z" is<br>
provided between the guidewire 226 and the other sheet materials.<br>
[0028] The guidewire 226 is made of copper, and has a rectangular cross-section with<br>
dimension: "x" and "y." The dimensions "x" and "y" depend on several factors, but in<br>
one or more embodiments "x" is approximately 300 micrometers and "y" is<br>
approximately 1.5 urn. In some embodiments, it is desired to minimize dimension "y",<br>
minimize dimensic n "z", or both.<br>
[0029] As mentioned earlier, it is typically useful to have the thickness of guidewire<br>
226 (dimension "x") be approximately equal to the distance between successive windings<br>
of anode copper collector extension 214. In this way, both electrical and mechanical<br><br>
contact is made between the collector extensions 214 and the guidewire 226. In some<br>
embodiments, it is desirable to minimize the dimension "y" to enhance the overall volume<br>
of electrode within the cell. Alternatively, dimension "y" is large enough to provide<br>
mechanical stability during high speed winding, and to prevent damage to the jelly roll<br>
during the operation in which the guidewire 226 is joined to the current collector<br>
extensions 214. In embodiments calling for enhanced thermal protection, dimension "y"<br>
may be increased to increase the heat capacity product to satisfy the desired heat content<br>
needs to protect the cell from overheating.<br>
[0030] Cathode active materials 204b surround an aluminum cathode collector 204a.<br>
The active cathode material 204b and the cathode substrate 204a are collectively referred<br>
to herein as the cathode 204. The cathode extension 212, which is comprised of<br>
aluminum, is coupled to (or integral with) the cathode substrate 204a and extends beyond<br>
the coated active cathode material 204b. The cathode extension 212 extends beyond the<br>
coated active cathode material 204b by a distance sufficient to allow for installation of<br>
guidewire 220 between successive windings of collector extension 212 and without<br>
having electrical contact between the guidewire 220 and the other layers of active<br>
material electrodes or separator sheet sheets 206. Although not depicted in Figure 6,<br>
guidewire 220 is constructed and arranged relative to the cathode extension 212 and<br>
cathode 204 in a similar manner as previously discussed in regards to guidewire 226.<br>
Guidewire 220 is made of aluminum, the same material that is used to form the cathode<br>
extension 212.<br>
[0031] To help establish desirable electrical, thermal and mechanical connection<br>
between the electrode collector extensions 212,214 and the guidewires 220, 226,<br>
respectively, weld joints are provided across successive portions of the cathode extension<br>
212 and guidewire 220 to form the cathode endcap 228 and other weld joints are similarly<br>
applied across successive portions of the anode extension 214 and guidewire 226 to form<br>
the anode endcap 222.<br>
[0032] Figure 7 illustrates how welds are provided to structurally maintain the<br>
cathode endcap 228 of a rolled battery apparatus 200. After the cathode endcap 228 has<br>
been formed by rolling the elements 202 as previously discussed, two radial welds 302<br>
that define equally spaced quadrants of the endcap 228 are applied across successive<br><br>
portions of cathode extension 212 and guidewire 220 (not shown individually). While<br>
Figure 7 only illustrates two welds 302 being used to form endcap 228, any number of<br>
welds might be appropriately used to properly secure the endcap 228. Anode endcap 222<br>
is to be secure through the use of similar welds 302 (not shown).<br>
[0033] After the welds 302 have been applied, cathode endcap 228 is then coupled to<br>
a cover 310. Cover 310 has a conductive center terminal 304 that is used to connect the<br>
battery to an external electrical circuit. The conductive center terminal 304 is preferably<br>
comprised of the same material that is used to form the guidewire of the electrode endcap<br>
which is be coupled to it, e.g., guidewire 220 of cathode endcap 228. The cover 310<br>
further includes an insulating ring 308 disposed around the center terminal 304 and an<br>
outer conducting ring 306. Once assembled, an electrically conductive pathway exists<br>
between the cathode endcap 228 of the rolled assembly 210 and the center terminal 304<br>
of the cover 310. The rolled assembly 210 is then inserted into the conductive can 120<br>
and the anode endcap 222 is coupled to the metal can 120 by welding a portion of the<br>
anode endcap 22 to the inside end of the can 120, for example. The cover 310 is then<br>
attached to the can 120, by welding, for example. Electrolyte can be introduced into the<br>
interior volume that is defined by the can 120 and the cover 310 via a port (not shown)<br>
once the cover 310 has been attached to the can 120. The port is plugged after the<br>
volume has been sufficiently filled. The port can be provided in the cover 310 or,<br>
alternatively, in the can 120. Alternatively, the electrolyte can be introduced into the<br>
interior volume of the can 120 prior to attaching the cover 310. After assembly, an<br>
electrically conductive pathway thus exists between the anode endcap 222 of the rolled<br>
assembly 210 and the can 120. The cathode endcap 228, in contrast, is electrically<br>
isolated from the car 120. The construction of the can 120, cover 310, and other details<br>
will depend on the z pplication for which the battery is being designed.<br>
[0034] In some embodiments, as shown in Figure 8, insulating tape 320 is used to<br>
further ensure that the cathode endcap 228 is electrically isolated from the metal can 120.<br>
Figure 8 also show s the final appearance of the endcap 228, including the spirally co-<br>
wound layers of cathode collector extension 212 and guidewire 220 being attached by<br>
weld joints 302 made in the face of the endcap 228.<br><br>
[0035] It should be appreciated that the weld joints 302 can be made by any suitable<br>
method that fits the application at hand. For example, laser welds, spot welds, ultrasonic<br>
welds, or other types of attachment can be used. Also, it should be appreciated that the<br>
weld joints 302 do not necessarily extend all the way across the face of the endcap 228,<br>
but can be multiple discrete welds that accomplish substantially the same effect, such as<br>
smaller welds that are staggered across the radial span of the endcap 228.<br>
[0036] Figure 9 illustrates an exemplary apparatus and method for making a rolled<br>
battery device as described herein. Spools 403 and 407 hold separator membrane sheet<br>
material 206. Spool 405 holds anode electrode sheet material 208, and spool 409 holds<br>
cathode electrode sheet material 204. Spool 411 holds guidewire 226 and spool 413<br>
holds cathode guidewire 220.<br>
[0037] The sheet and guidewire materials are co-wound onto spool 415, and other<br>
processing apparatus and steps may be added as necessary to complete the manufacture of<br>
rolled portion 210 of a battery.<br>
[0038] Once the roll 210 is formed, its endcaps 222 and 228 are welded as discussed<br>
above and the rolled structure 210 is inserted into a metal can, such as aluminum can 120.<br>
The endcaps 222 and 228 may be further welded or suitably attached to the can 120 or a<br>
cover 310. If an aluminum can is used for Li-ion chemistry, the cathode endcap 228 can<br>
be attached to the can 120 with the anode endcap 222 being attached the center terminal<br>
304 of the cover 310. If a steel can is used, however, the anode endcap 222 can<br>
alternatively be coupled to the can and the cathode endcap 228 is coupled to the terminal<br>
of the cover.<br>
[0039] Electrolytic filler fluids and gels may be inserted into the battery roll once<br>
formed by known techniques, such as vacuum back-filling. One way in which the battery<br>
roll 210 may be so filled also allows for gas exchange during charging and discharging of<br>
the battery. This is possible by making the guidewires or the collector extensions have<br>
grooves or notches built therein to prevent airtight seals from being formed, and to allow<br>
for passage of fluids and gases through the grooves and notches.<br>
[0040] To provide additional electrical, thermal, and mechanical utility, flexible<br>
conducting elements may be inserted between the endcaps 222, 228 and respective outer<br>
battery casing elements, such as can 120 and cover 310. For example, spring-loaded<br><br>
separators that are welded or pressure-fitted in place can be used. In some instances, a<br>
wavy-washer type apparatus can serve to provide the needed coupling between the<br>
endcaps and the external battery casing components. In other cases, a wide conductive<br>
and flexible strap can be welded to the endcap and the battery can or terminal and bent<br>
upon itself thereby providing electrical connector and spring (dynamic force)<br>
functionality.<br>
[0041] While traditional battery designs currently struggle to provide high power<br>
applications with the desired results, the embodiments described herein allow for a<br>
reduced impedance design that provide improved electrical characteristics for high power<br>
and high current applications. Lower resistance of the battery cell internals and endcaps<br>
also reduces heat generation and dissipation from the battery. The endcaps described and<br>
their method of attachment to the collector extensions provide good heat sink to the outer<br>
battery components and prevent undesired thermal buildup in the battery.<br>
[0042] In a Li-ion cell with a LiFePO4 graphite chemistry formulated for high power,<br>
electrodes are fabricated using conventional processes to coat both sides of a current<br>
collector with electroactive material. In one or more embodiments, the thickness of the<br>
two-sided cathode and anode are 200 and 100 microns, respectively. The thickness of the<br>
anode and cathode current collectors are about 12 microns. The thickness of the separator<br>
is about 25 microns. Guidewires of aluminum and copper with dimensions of about 0.16<br>
by 0.32 mm (cross section) are wound concentrically into a rolled battery configuration,<br>
such as a "18650" configuration.<br>
[0043] The length of the cathode and anode is about 55 and 61 cm, respectively.<br>
Laser welding is used to join the guidewires to the anode and cathode extended current<br>
collectors. Copper and aluminum strap (8mm by 0.1 mm by 2.0 cm) are used to join the<br>
jelly roll to a steel can and header, respectively. After activating the cell, the 1000 Hz<br>
impedance of an 18650-based configuration was about 10.5 milliohm. The cell exhibited<br>
low self-heating when pulsed at high current or continuous high current discharge. This<br>
impedance is related to the length of the electrodes used in the cell and the 1000 Hz<br>
impedance of a "26650" configuration cell with similar construction was about 8.5<br>
milliohm.<br><br>
[0044] Figure 10 illustrates a stacked embodiment of an electrochemical storage<br>
device constructed in accordance with the present invention. Two separator sheets 206a<br>
are placed between electrodes 204a and 208a. Guidewires 220a and 226a are placed<br>
adjacent to the extensions 212a and 214a respectively. The final product contains<br>
relatively flat-stacked sheets of separator and electrode material, and the guidewires are<br>
also straight to conform to the straight profiles of the flat-stacked sheets.<br>
[0045] Figure 11 illustrates yet another embodiment of the present invention whereby<br>
the separator sheet 2006 is folded in an accordion-style, including along folds 2006a and<br>
2006b. The other sheets of electrode material 2004 and 2008 and placed in opposing<br>
sides of the formation made by the folded separator 2006. End caps and terminal<br>
connections are then added to the assembly to form a battery device. This configuration,<br>
like the stacked configuration of Figure 10 can be extended (not shown) to include many<br>
layers as needed by the design at hand.<br>
[0046] Upon review of the present description and embodiments, those skilled in the<br>
art will recognize useful modifications and equivalent substitutions of various aspects of<br>
the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the invention. Thus, the<br>

above.<br><br>
