The present   invention   is for the purpose   of forming  a film-like  or sheet-like   resin-made   membrane   (signifying  a thin-film),  and relates  to a resin-made   membrane   formation casting apparatus   suitably  used, for example,  as a biaxial oriented   film machine,  a non-oriented   film machine,  a sheet machine,  and others. 2)   <br>
Figs. 31 and 32 are respectively   a side elevational view and a front elevational   view each illustratively showing  a prior resin-made   membrane formation  casting apparatus.    Although Fig. 32 shows only one end portion side of the prior apparatus   in its width  direction,  the other end portion  side is constructed   in a similar way.<br>
As shown in Figs. 31 and 32, the prior apparatus   is equipped   with at die 101  for extruding  a molten resin from an extruding  machine  (not shown) into a film-like  or sheet-like   membrane   102, a casting roll (cooling roll) 103 for receiving  the membrane   102 extruded   from the Tdie<br><br>
101  on its outer circumferential   surface to cool and deliver the membrane   102, and a suction chamber  (vacuum  box) 104 for stably making the membrane   102 come closely into contact with the surface  of the casting roll 103.<br>
In this constitution,   the casting roll 103  is supported<br><br>
by   supporting; shaft 106 to be Rota table  with respect to a side frame   107;<br>
The suction chamber   104 is fixedly secured  on one side surface  of the T die 101.   Further,   a vacuum  pump  105 is in a coupled  relation  to the suction chamber   104  so that,<br>
when  this vacuum  pump   105  is placed  into operation,   the air  <br>
chamber   104.<br>
The opening section  104a is made throughout  the overall width  of the membrane   102 in the proximity  of a portion  where the membrane   102 starts to come closely into contact with the outer circumferential   surface of the casting roll 103.   Further,  a seal gap 104b is defined  between   the suction chamber   104 and the casting roll 103.   The dimension   of the seal gap 104b is set to ensure   a required suction force (pressure   reduction   level) at the close contact section between  the membrane   102 and the casting roll 103 concurrently   with allowing the rotation  of the casting roll<br><br>
103.   In Figs. 31 and 32, reference   numeral   1 08 represents wheels  to be used when  shifting this apparatus.<br>
With the above-mentioned   constitution,   the resin molten  by the non-shown   extruding   machine  passes through   the T die 101  to be extruded   into a film-like  or sheet-like   membrane   102 which in turn, is placed on the outer circumferential   surface  of the casting roll 103  to be<br>
cooled for formation.<br><br>
sucked by the vacuum pump 105 so that the air in the close contact section between the membrane 102 and the casting roll 103 is sucked through the opening section 104a of the suction chamber 104. Whereupon, that close contact section is pressure-reduced to discharge the air taken in between the membrane 102 and the casting roll 103, with the result that the membrane 102 made of the molten resin can stably be brought  into contact with the casting roll 103.<br>
In this case, depending   upon the kind of resin, on the condition  that an interval   between   the T die 101  and the casting roll 103 is small, the orientation of the molten resin due to its extension  is not relieved,  but the resin is cooled and solidified on the casting roll 103, and hence, a necessary film characteristic   (membrane   characteristic)   is unobtainable.    In addition, under  the condition that the<br><br>
interval  between   the T die 101  and the casting roll 103 is small, the microscopic  surface irregularities   occurring at the exit of the T die 101  is uneducable  in the extension interval, and after being cooled and solidified, they remain  as the surface  roughness,   thereby   deteriorating   the film quality (membrane   quality).<br>
Accordingly,  a way of varying  the interval   between the T die 101   and the casting roll 103  in accordance  with kinds  of resins can betaken  in order to attain  the necessary film characteristic   (membrane characteristic).    However, in the prior apparatus   shown  in Figs. 31 and 32, since the suction! chamber !1Q4 is fixed with respect  to the T die 101, difficulty  is encountered   to vary the interval   between   the T die 101  and the casting roll 103.<br>
For instance, even if, in the prior apparatus shown in Figs. 31 and 32, the casting roll 103 is lowered to enlarge the interval between the Tdie 101 and the casting roll 103,, the seal gap 104b between the suction chamber 104 and the casting roll 103 results in enlargement to make it difficult to obtain a necessary suction force, so that the removal of the air taken in between the membrane 102 and the casting roll 103 becomes impossible, with the result that it is impossible to stably make the membrane 102 come closely into contact with the casting roll 103.<br><br>
Furthermore,   according  to an experiment,   in the case of forming the membrane   102 through   the use of a casting apparatus   based  upon the above-mentioned   suction chamber   104, the configuration  of the vacuum  space defined   by the membrane-like   molten  resin  immediately after  being discharged   from the T die 101, the outer circumferential   surface  of the casting roll 103  and the tip portion  of the suction chamber   104, or the occurrence  or non-occurrence   of the flow of the outside  air into that vacuum  space, has influence on the stably closely contacting condition  of the membrane   102 with the casting roll 103  in accordance  with the conditions  such as the kind  of resin being a material,  the resin viscosity when molten,  the thickness   of the membrane   102 and the formation   speed. Particularly,   in the, case of a resin  with  a relatively   low extension   viscosity,  the outside-air   flow situation   into the vacuum  space affects the stably close contact of the membrane   102 with the casting roll 103.<br>
For this reason, troubles  take place, for example,  the membrane   102 vibrates   (swings) or is brought  into the interior  of the suction chamber   104, and particularly   in the case of high-speed   formation  of the membrane   102, that influence  becomes more serious.   For example. Fig. 33 shows an outside-air  inflow situation (the dotted arrows denote air<br><br>
flows) in a cross section taken  along a line S-S of Fig. 31, and as shown  in Fig. 33, the membrane   102 vibrates   (swings) or is brought   into the interior  of the suction chamber   104 due to the occurrence  of the dynamic  pressure   at a portion designated   at B2 and the eddy caused by the suction at a portion  depicted  at Bl, which hinders   the speed-up   of the membrane   formation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present  invention   has been  developed   with a view to eliminating  the above-mentioned   problems,  and it is therefore   an object of this invention  to provide  a casting apparatus   for resin-made   membrane   formation  which is capable  of accomplishing the stable pressure reduction   by a suction chamber  without depending   upon the dimension  of the interval   between   a die and a cooling roll and of appropriately   setting  the interval   between   the die and  the cooling .roll irrespective   of any kind of resin so that the necessary   membrane   characteristic   is securable   to improve the quality  of a resin-made   membrane.<br>
For this purpose,  in accordance  with the present invention,  a casting apparatus   for resin-made   membrane formation  comprises  a die for extruding   a molten  resin into a membrane, a cooling roll for receiving  the membrane<br><br>
extruded   from the die on its outer circumferential   surface to deliver it while cooling, and a suction chamber  for sucking air between   the membrane   and the cooling roll so that the membrane   is brought closely into contact with the surface of the cooling roll, wherein   the suction chamber   is disposed independently   of the die and is located to define a necessary seal gap with respect to the cooling roll, and a circumferentially   moving mechanism  is further   provided to move  the suction chamber  along a circumferential   direction of the cooling roll in a state of maintaining   the necessary seal gap.<br>
The following mechanisms   (1) to (3) can be employed as the circumferentially   moving mechanism:<br>
(1)	A mechanism  having a driving member   in which its proximal  side is supported   to be rotatable   around   a rotary   shaft of the cooling roll and the suction chamber  is fixedly secured   to its tip side;<br>
(2)	A mechanism  having a guide member   which is attached   to a side frame for Rota ably  supporting   a side end portion! of the cooling roll and is made  to guide the suction chamber   along a circumferential  direction of the cooling roll; and	i<br>
(3)	a mechanism   having  a driving  member   in which its proximal  side is supported   to be rotatable around   a<br><br>
rotary   shaft of the cooling roll and further  having a guide member   attached   to a tip side of this driving member   to guide the suction chamber along a circumferential  direction<br>
of the cooling roll.<br>
On the other hand, it is also appropriate   to provide a radially  driving mechanism  for shifting the suction chamber in a radial direction  of the cooling roll to adjust  the<br>
necessary   seal gap.<br>
The circumferentially   moving mechanism   and  the radially  moving mechanism   can take the following structures   (4) to (6):<br>
(4)	A circumferentially   moving  mechanism     driving member  in which iu proximal side is supported   to be rotatable   around  a rotary  shaft of the cooling roll and the suction chamber is fixedly secured  to its tip side, while a radially moving mechanism   is provided  at a portion  where  the suction chamber  is fitted  to the driving member;<br>
(5)	A circumferentially   moving mechanism  is equipped   with a guide member  attached   to a side frame for rotatably   supporting  a side end portion  of the cooling roll and made  to guide the suction chamber  along a<br>
I<br>
circumferential   direction  of the cooling roll, whereas   a<br><br>
.11 radially moving<br><br>
mechanism  is constructed   as a mechanism<br><br>
for shifting the guide member  along a radial direction of the<br>
cooling roll; and<br>
(6) A circumferentially   moving mechanism   is equipped   with a driving  member  in which  its proximal  side is supported   to be rotatable   around  a rotary   shaft of the cooling roll and a guide member   fitted  to a tip side of the driving  member   to guide  the suction chamber along a circumferential   direction  of the cooling roll, whereas   a radially moving mechanism   is provided   at a portion  where the guide member   is attached   to the driving mechanism.<br>
Besides, it is also possible  that an elastic seal member is interposed   between  the die and the suction  chamber.<br>
In this case, it is possible  that the elastic seal member is disposed  throughout   a width exceeding  the overall  width of the membrane,   and is composed of a bar-like   elastic seal body based  on a foaming agent and formed by covering the whole surface of the foaming agent with a glass cloth coated with an aluminum   foil and a fixture for fixing the elastic seal body to the suction chamber  or the die, and further   is made to close the gap between   the die and the suction chamber  in a manner  that the elastic seal body is pressed against the die or the suction chamber  with an elastic force to come into contact therewith.    In addition, it is also possible that the elastic seal member  is disposed  throughout<br><br>
a width exceeding the overall width of the membrane,   and is made  up of a metallic plate spring  with a corrosion resistance   which is attached   to the suction chamber   or the die, and further   is made  to close the gap between   the die and the suction chamber  in a manner   that the metallic plate spring  is pressed   against the die or the suction chamber with an elastic force to come into contact therewith.<br>
Moreover,  a shielding  plate capable of shielding  an end portion of a suction opening section of the suction chamber  can be provided  to be movable in a width direction of the membrane.    A suction nozzle can also be provided   to suck air from an end portion  side direction  of a suction opening section of the suction chamber.    Besides, it is also appropriate   that a shielding  plate capable  of shielding  an end portion  of a suction  opening  section of the suction chamber  can be provided  to be movable in a width direction of the membrane   and further a suction nozzle is provided to suck air from an end portion  side direction  of the suction opening section of the suction chamber.<br>
As described  above, in the resin-made   membrane<br><br>
formation  casting suction chamber<br>
apparatus   according to this invention,  the is separated   from the die and is provided independently   of the die, and the suction chamber   is designed  to be moved  along the circumferential   direction of<br><br>
the cooling roll by the circumferentially   moving mechanism while the necessary   seal gap is maintained   between   the suction chamber   and the cooling roll.<br>
In the case of the use of the circumferentially moving mechanism having the driving member made such that its proximal side is supported to be rot arable around the rotary shaft of the cooling roll and the suction chamber is fixedly secured to its tip side, the suction chamber can be moved in the circumferential direction of the cooling roll in a manner that the driving member is rotated around the rotary shaft of the cooling roll.<br>
Furthermore,   in the case of the use of the circumferentially   moving mechanism   having the guide member   fitted to the side frame rotatably   supporting   the side end portion  of the cooling roll to guide the suction chamber  along the circumferential   direction  of the cooling roll, the cooling roll can be shifted  in the circumferential direction   of the cooling roll by means  of guiding  the suction chamber  along the guide member.<br>
Still further, through the use of the circumferentially moving mechanism having the driving member in which its proximal side is supported to be rotatable around the rotary shaft of the cooling roll and further   having the guide<br><br>
guide the  suction chamber   in the circumferential   direction of the cooling roll, the suction chamber  can be shifted  in the circumferential   direction  of the cooling roll in a manner   that the driving member  is rotated  around the rotary  shaft of the cooling roll and the suction chamber  is guided  along the guide member.<br>
Accordingly,  in case where   the interval   between   the die and the cooling roll is large, when  the suction chamber  is shifted  in the circumferential   direction   by the circumferentially   moving mechanism   to make  the suction inlet (opening  section) of the suction chamber  approach  the close-contact  starting   section  between   the membrane   and the cooling roll, regardless   of the dimension of the interval between   the die and the. cooling roll, the necessary  pressure reduction   level is securable,  with the result that the pressure   reduction  of the space between  the membrane   and the cooling roll can stably be done by the suction chamber. Whereupon,   it becomes possible to appropriately   set the interval   between   the die and the cooling roll for any kind of resin, which ensures  the necessary membrane   characteristic to sharply  enhances   the quality  of the resin-made membrane.<br>
In this case, if the elastic seal member   is put between the die and the suction chamber, even  if the variation  of the<br><br>
dimension   of the interval   between   the die and  the cooling roll or the position  of the suction chamber   takes  place, the elastic seal member   can close the gap between   the die and the suction chamber  following that variation,  with the result that the air tightness   of the pressure   reduction   space surrounded   by the die, the membrane   and the suction chamber   is securable   so that the necessary   pressure reduction   level is surely  obtainable   in that pressure reduction   space.<br>
Furthermore,   if the elastic seal member   is disposed throughout   a width  exceeding  the overall  width  of the membrane   and is pressed   against the die with an elastic force to come into contact therewith   to close the gap between   the die and the suction chamber,  irrespective   of the variation  of the position of the suction chamber,   the elastic member   can automatically   and certainly  close the interval   between   the suction chamber   and the die, and therefore,   the airtightness   of the pressure   reduction   space surrounded   by the die, the membrane   and the suction chamber  is securable,  thereby   surely providing  the necessary   pressure   reduction   level in the pressure reduction  space.  In addition, at the positional adjustment of the suction chamber  for obtaining  the optimal condition which is done prior to the start of each membrane<br><br>
production   operation,  it is possible  to certainly   prevent   the vibrations   of the membrane   occurring  because  of the air flow into the suction chamber through  the interval  between the intuition chamber   and the die, with the result  that the adjustnqient   work becomes  extremely   easy and the production  operation  can be conducted  immediately   after the adjustment   work.<br>
On the other hand, in another  casting apparatus   for resin-made   membrane   formation   according to this invention,  the suction chamber   is movable   in the circumferential   and radial directions  of the cooling roll in a state  where   the seal gap is maintainable   between   the suction chamber   and the cooling roll and the seal gap between   the suction chamber   and the cooling roll is adjustable,   and further,   that gap can be sealed with the elastic seal member   irrespective   of the dimension   of the interval  between   the die and the suction chamber.<br>
Accordingly, since the pressure  reduction  of the gap between   the membrane   and the cooling roll is stably achievable   by the suction chamber regardless   of the dimension   of the interval   between   the die and the cooling roll, the interval   between   the die and the cooling roll can adequately   be set for any kind of resin, which ensures   the<br><br>
necessary   membrane   characteristic   to sharply   improve   the quality  of the resin-made   membrane.<br>
In addition,  if using the shielding  plate capable  of shielding  the end portion of the suction opening  section of the suction  chamber or the suction  nozzle made   to suck the air from the end portion  side direction   of the suction opening section of the suction chamber,  the main flow into the space defined   by the membrane   extruded   from the die, the coupling roll and, the suction chamber due to the suction is controllable,  so that it is possible to suppress   the vibrations (swinging)  of the membrane   or the introduction   of the membrane   into the suction chamber,  with the result that the amble membrane   formation is feasible for any kind of resin.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Embodiments   of the present  invention  will be described   hereinbelow   with reference  to the drawings.<br>
[1]   Description  of First Embodiment<br>
Fig. 1 is a side elevational   view illustratively   showing a casting  apparatus   for resin-made   membrane   formation according  to a first embodiment   of the present   invention, and as shown in Fig. 1, the casting apparatus   according  to the first embodiment   is also composed   of a T die (die)  1 for extruding   a resin  molten  by an extruding   machine  (not shown) into a film-like  or sheet-like   membrane   (thin-film) 2, a casting roll (cooling roll) 3 for receiving the membrane   2 extruded   from the T die 1 on its outer circuniferential surface  to cool and deliver it, and a suction chamber  4 for sucking air between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3 to make  the membrane   2 stably  come closely into contact with the surface  of the casting roll 3.<br>
In this embodiment,   the suction chamber  4 is provided   independently   of the Tdie 1.  Further,  the suction chamber  4 is formed along the outer circumferential   surface of the (pasting roll 3, and a necessary   seal gap 4d is defined between   the suction chamber  4 and the outer circumferential   surface of the casting roll 3.  The dimension<br><br>
(interval)   of this seal gap 4d is set to ensure   a necessary suction force (pressure   reduction   level) at a close contact section between   the membrane 2 and the casting roll 3 while allowing the rotation  of the casting roll 3.<br>
Besides, as well as the prior art, a vacuum pump  5 is in comimunication   with the suction chamber  4, and on the operation   of this vacuum  pump  5, the air between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3 is sucked  through   an 01&gt;eiiing «eciion 4a of the auction chamber  4.  Further,  the opening section 4a (suction inlet) is made throughout   the overall  width  of the membrane   2 in the proximity   of the portion   where   the membrane   2 starts  to come closely into contact with the outer circumferential   surface of the casting roll 3.<br>
In addition,  in this embodiment,   a driving  member   7 is used as a circumferentially   moving mechanism   designed to move the suction chamber  4 along a circumferential direction  of the casting roll 3 while maintaining   the necessary   seal gap 4d.  This driving member   7 is made such that its proximal  side supported   coaxially with  a roll supporting   shaft (rotary   shaft) 3a of the casting roll 3 to be rotatable  around  the roll supporting shaft 3a (in directions of arrows A in Fig. 1) while its tip side is in a fixed relation to the suction chamber  4.<br><br>
Furthermore,   an elastic seal body (elastic seal member)   6 is interposed   between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber  4, and the gap between  the T die 1 and the suction chamber  4 is sealed by the effect of the elastic seal<br>
body 6.<br>
Since the resin-made   membrane   formation   casting apparatus   according  to the first embodiment   of this invention   is constructed   as mentioned  above, a resin molten by the non-shown  extruding machine is extruded   from the T die 1 into a film-like or sheet-like   membrane   2 which in turn, is taken  on the outer circumferential   surface  of the casting roll 3 to be cooled for formation.<br>
At this time, if the vacuum  pump  5 sucks the air within  the suction chamber  4, the air in the close contact section between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3 is sucked  through  the opening section 4a of the suction chamber 4. Whereupon,  the space close to that close-contact section is pressure-reduced   to discharge   the air taken  in between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3, so that the membrane   2 made of a molten  resin can stably  be brought into close contact with the casting roll 3.<br>
Now, consideration   is given to a case of varying  the interval   between   the T die 1 and the casting roll 3 in accordance  with the kind of resin in order to attain  a<br><br>
necessary   film characteristic   (membrane   characteristic). For instance, by retreating   (lowering) the casting roll 3, it is possible  to enlarge  the gap (interval)   between   the T die 1 and the casting roll 3.  On the contrary,  in the case of the prior apparatus,   when  only retreating   the casting roll 3, in addition   to the enlargement   of the interval   between   the membrane   2 and the opening  section 4a of the suction chamber  4, the seal gap 4d between   the suction chamber  4 and the casting roll 3 increases,   which makes  it difficult to bring  the space (pressure   reduction   space)  near  the close contact section between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3 to a necessary  pressure   reduction   level.<br>
In this embpdiment,   the suction chamber  4 is separated   from the T die 1 and disposed  independently   of the T die 1, and through  the use of the driving member  7, the suction chamber 4 is movable along the circumferential directions  of the casting roll 3 in a state where the necessary seal gap 4d is maintained   between   the suction chamber  4 and the casting roll 3.<br>
Thus, in the case that the interval between   the T die 1 and the casting roll 3 is large, the suction chamber  4 is shifted  by the driving  member   7 counterclockwise   around the roll supporting  shaft 3a to advance to a given position so that the suction inlet (opening  section 4a) of the suction<br><br>
chamber  4 approaches   the close-contact  starting   section between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3, with the result that the interval   between   the membrane   2 and the opening  section 4a of the suction chamber  4 decreases.    On the contrary,   in the case that the interval   between   the Tdie 1 and the casting roll 3 is small, the suction chamber  4 is shifted  by the driving  member   7 clockwise around   the roll supporting   shaft 3a to retreat   up to a given position.<br>
Moreover,  at this time, since the suction chamber  4 is formed   along the outer circumferential   surface  of the casting roll 3, even if the suction chamber 4 is rotated  by the driving  member  7, the necessary   seal gap 4d is always maintainable   between   the suction chamber  4 and the casting roll 3.<br>
Because of setting  the position of the suction chamber 4 and maintaining   the seal gap 4d as mentioned   above, without depending   upon the dimension  of the interval between   the Tdie 1 and the casting roll 3, the necessary pressure   reduction   level is attainable   in the pressure reduction   space, so that the pressure   reduction   in the space between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3 is stably achievable  by the suction chamber 4,<br>
Furthermore,   in a manner of varying  the dimension  of the interval between  the Tdie 1 and the casting roll 3 or the<br><br>
position of the suction chamber  4 as mentioned  above, since in this embodiment   the elastic seal body 6 is interposed between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber  4, even  if the interval   (gap) between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber 4 varies,  the clastic  seal member   closes the gap between   the Tdie 1 and the suction chamber  4 in accordance  with the variation.    Whereupon,   the airlightness   of the pressure reduction   space surrounded   by the Tdie I, the membrane   2 and the suction chamber  4 is maintainable   so that the necessary   pressure   reduction   level is certainly obtainable  in that pressure   reduction   space.<br>
I|icidentally,   the rotating  operation   of the suction chambdr  4 by roltationally  driving the driving member   7<br>
around  ihe roll supporting   shaft 3a can rely on a manual<br>
*'	■	I '<br>
operation  and can be through  anon-shown   driving mechanism  (drive  motor).<br>
As described   above, in the casting apparatus   for resin-made   membrane   formation   according to the first embodiment   of this invention,  regardless   of the dimension of the interval  between   the Tdie 1 and the casting roll 3, the pressure  reduction  in the space between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3 is stably achievable  by the suction chamber 4, and therefore,  it is possible to appropriately   set the interval   between   the Tdie 1 and the casting roll 3 with<br><br>
respect  to any kind of resin, with the result that the necessary   film characteristic   (membrane   characteristic)   is securable   to sharply   improve   the quality  of the resin-made membrane   (film or sheet)  2.<br>
[2]  Description of Second Embodiment Fig. 2 illustratively   shows a casting apparatus   for resin-made   membrane   formation   according to a second embodiment   of this invention.    Although  the casting apparatus   according  to the second embodiment   has the substantially   same construction   as that of the apparatus according  to the first embodiment  as shown in Fig. 2, in the second embodiment,   a guide member   8 is employed   as a circumferentially   moving mechanism   made  to shift a<br>
' i	I     ■<br>
suction chamber  4 along the circumferential   directions  of a casting roll 3 in a state where  a necessary   seal gap 4d is kept.<br>
This guide member 8 is fitted to a side frame 8b made to rotatably support aside end portion of the casting roll 3. The guide member 8 has an elongated hole-like guide rail 8 a made to engage with two pins (rollers) 4c, 4c fitted onto a side surface of the suction chamber 4 to guide the suction chamber 4 along circumferential directions (in directions of arrows  B in Fig. 2) of the casting roll 3.<br><br>
In the casting apparatus   according  to the second embodiment,   the structure   other than the aforesaid circumferentially   moving mechanism   is the same  as that of the first embodiment,   and hence, the description   thereof will be omitted.<br>
Since the resin-made   membrane   formation   casting apparatus   according  to the second embodiment   of this invention   is constructed as mentioned   above, in the case that the interval between  the Tdie 1 and the casting roll 3 is large, the suction chamber  4 is shifted counterclockwise   (in the left-hand   direction  in Fig. 2) along the elongated  hole-like guide rail 8a of the guide member 8 to advance   to a given po^sition so that the suction inlet (opening  section 4a) of the suction chamber  4 approaches   the close contact starting  portion  between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3, thereby   shortening   the interval   between   the membrane   2 and the opening section 4a of the suction chamber 4. On the contrary, when the interval  between  the T die 1 and the casting roll 3 is small, the suction chamber 4 is moved clockwise (in the right-hand   direction  in Fig. 2) along the elongated  hole-like guide rail 8a of the guide member   8 to retreat   to a given position.<br>
In addition,  as in the case of the first embodiment, since the suction chamber  4 is formed  along the outer<br><br>
circumferential   surface  of the casting roll 3. although  the suction chamber  4 moves along the elongated  hole-like guide rail 8a of the guide member   8, the necessary   seal gap 4d 18 always  held betv^een   the suction chamber   4 and the outer circumferential   surface  of the casting roll 3.<br>
Incidentally,   the movement   of the suction chamber  4 along the guide rail 8a can manually  done or conducted through  the use of a driving mechanism   (not shown).<br>
Thus, the resin-made   membrane   formation   casting apparatus   according  to the second embodiment   of this invention   can also offer the same effects as those of the first embodiment.<br>
[3]  Description  of Third Embodiment<br>
Fig. 3 illustratively   shows a casting apparatus   for resin-made   membrane   formation  according to a third embodiment   of this invention.    Although  the casting apparatus   has the substantially   same structure   as that of the first embodiment   as shown in Fig, 3, in the third embodiment,   a driving member   9 and a guide member   1 0 are used as the circumferentially   moving mechanism  which moves a suction chamber 4 along circumferential  directions of a casting roll 3 while keeping  a necessary   seal gap 4d.<br>
In this case, the driving member   9 is designed   such that its proximal  side is supported   coaxially with a roll<br><br>
On the contrary,   when  the interval   between   the Tdie<br>
1 and the casting roll 3 is of a small dimension,  the rough<br>
adjustment   is first made  such that the suction chamber  4 is<br>
moved  by the driving  member   9 clockwise around   the roll<br>
supporting   shaft 3a to retreat  to an appropriate   position and<br>
subsequently   the fine adjustment   is made  such that  the<br>
suction chamber  4 is shifted  along the elongated   hole-like<br>
guide rail 10a of the guide member   10 to be positioned  at a given position.<br>
In addition,  at this time, as in the case of the first embodiment,   since the suction chamber  4 is formed  along the outer circumferential   surface of the casting roll 3, although   the suction chamber  4 is rotated   by the driving member   9 and although  being shifted  along the elongated hole-like  guide rail 10a of the guide member   10, the necessary   seal gap 4d stays between   the suction chamber 4 and the outer circumferential  surface  of the casting roll 3.<br>
Incidentally, the rotation of the suction chamber 4 by rotationally driving the driving member 9 around the roll supporting shaft 3a can rely on a manual operation and can be through a non-shown driving mechanism (drive motor). Likewise, the movement of the suction chamber 4 around the guide rail lOa can rely on a manual operation and can be through  a non-shown   driving mechanism.<br><br>
thus, the resin-made   membrane   formation   casting apparatus   according  to the third  embodiment  of this invention  can also obtain the same effects as those of the first embodiment,   and since in the third embodiment   the positioning  of the suction chamber  4 is made  through   the two steps of the rough adjustment   by the driving member  9 and the fine adjustment   by the guide member   10, the positioning is achievable  with a high accuracy.<br>
Although  in the above-described   first to third embodiments   the elastic seal body 6 closes the gap between the T die 1 and the suction chamber  4, other structures   are also appropriate   as long as they can close the gap between the T die 1 and the suction chamber 4 while following the variation   of the dimension   of the gap, and in addition   to a n elastic body such as a rubber,   bellows members   or the like are also acceptable.<br>
Besides, in the above-described   embodiments, although  as the circumferentially   moving mechanism  for moving the suction chamber  4 along the cirumferential directions   of the casting roll 3 while maintaining   the necessary   seal gap 4d there have been described the three modes: the driving member  7; the guide member   8; and the combination  of the driving member  9 and the guide member   10, this invention  is not limited to these, other<br><br>
mechanisms   are also acceptable  as long as they can move the suction chamber  4 along the circumferential   directions of the casting roll 3 in a state of maintaining   the necessary<br>
seal gap 4d.<br>
[4]   Description  of Fourth  Embodiment<br>
Figs. 4 to 7 respectively   show principal  sections of a casting apparatus   for resin-made   membrane   formation according to a fourth embodiment   of this invention.   Of these drawings,  Figs. 4 and 5 are a perspective   view and a side-elevational  cross-sectional   view each showing a structure and fitted condition  of an elastic seal member  thereof.  Fig. 6 is a side-elevational cross-sectional   view showing  a mounted   condition of the elastic member,  and Fig. 7 is a side-elevational   cross-sectional   view showing a mounted condition  of an elastic seal member   different  in size from the Fig. 6 member.<br>
In this fourth embodiment,a description   will be made of a more detailed   structure   of the elastic seal body 6 interposed  between  the Tdie 1 and the suction chamber 4 in the above-described   first to third embodiments.    In the illustrations,  the same numerals   as the above-taken numerals   represent   the same parts, and the description thereof will be omitted.   In addition,  in the fourth to twelfth embodiments,   the suction chamber   (vacuum   box)<br><br>
represented at numeral 4 in the first to third embodiments will be designated at numeral 40, and the elastic seal body 6 will be described  as being an elastic seal member   50.<br>
As shown  in Figs. 4, 5 and 6, a suction chamber  40 of the casting apparatus   according to the fourth  embodiment fulfills a function similar to that of the suction chamber  4 in the first to third embodiments,   and is composed of a housing 41 comprising  upper  walls 41a, 41b, a rear wall 41c and left- and right-hand   side walls 41d, and labyrinth   packings<br>
' i	■	'     '■<br>
42, 43 fixedly secured to outer-surface   lower portions of the left- and right-hand  side walls 41d and to the rear wall 41c, respectively.    The labyrinth   packing 43 is fixed to the left-and right-hand   side walls 42d,<br>
Furthermore,   a front side (left side in Figs, 5 and 6) of the suction chamber  40 is open, and a suction inlet (opening section) 40a is made  between   the upper  wall 41a of the suction chamber  40 and an outer circumferential   surface of the casting roll 3.   In addition,  the housing 41 is closed by the outer circumferential   surface of the casting roll 3 from the below except the suction inlet 40a, and a suction room 40b is defined  between   the housing 41 and the casting roll 3.<br>
The labyrinth   packings 42, 43 stand  against the outer circumferential   surface of the casting roll 3 in a state where<br><br>
they  are in a slightly  spaced relation to each other  to possibly  suppress   the inflow of the air from below the rear wall 41c and the left- and right-hand   walls 4Id. Incidentally,   in place of the labyrinth   packings 42, 43, it is also possible  to use rubber   seals, felt seals or the like.<br>
The suction room 40b is coupled  through   a suction duct 60, fixedly secured to the upper  wall 41b, to a vacuum pump 5 (see Figs. 1 to 3).<br>
The entire  suction chamber  40 is rotatably   supported<br>
cbaxially with theicasting roll 3 (around  the roll supporting shaft 3a) through   any one of the circumferentially   moving mechanisms   described   with reference   to Figs. 1 to 3 to be revolvable   along the outer circumferential   surface  of the casting roll 3 while maintaining   the necessary   seal gap.<br>
In this embodiment,   the elastic seal member   50 is disposed  throughout   a width exceeding  the overall width of the membrane   2, and as shown in Figs. 4 to 7, is made  up of an elastic seal body 51 and fixtures (fitting tools) 52, 53.<br>
The elastic seal body 51 is made of a foaming agent such as a polyimide  foam having an excellent heat resistance,  a high impact resilience and a less compressive permanent   strain, and formed  into a semicircular  bar-like configuration   in cross section, with its front surface being covered  with a glass cloth (made  by integrally   adhering   an<br><br>
aluminium   foil through   an adhesive  to a glass cloth) coated with an aluminium   foil.<br>
This elastic seal body 51 is fixed to the suction chamber  40 in a manner   that its lower portion  is held between   rising portions  52b, 53b of the fixtures  52, 53 in the forward  and backward  directions and the fixtures 52, 5 3 are fixedly tightened   with fitting bolts 55 with respect  to the upper  wall 41a of the suction chamber  40.<br>
Furthermore,   as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the elastic seal member   50 closes the gap between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber  40 in a manner   that the elastic seal body 51 is pressed   by dn elastic force to be brought   into contact with th^! T die 1. :   ;<br>
The fixture  53 is disposed  to be placed on the fixture 52, and in a state where  elongated  holes 52a made on the fixture 52 side are aligned with elongated   holes 53a made on the fixture 53 side, the fitting bolts 55 are inserted through  washers 54 into these elongated holes 52a, 53a and tightened   with respect to the upper wall 41a of the suction chamber  40 so that the fixtures  52, 53 are fixed integrally. As shown in Fig. 5, upper wall 41a side female screws  to be engaged  with the fitting bolts 55 are constructed   as blind screws in a rear plate 41e.<br><br>
As shown  in Fig. 7, the elongated  holes 52a are made for the purpose   of changing  the position  of the fixture  53 so that elastic seal bodies 51 different   in size can be fitted  to the suction chamber  40.   Further,  the elongated   holes 53a are for the purpose   of adjusting   the fitting position of the elastic seal member   50 to the suction chamber  40 in cooperation   with the fixture  52 side elongated   holes 52a. Thus, in fitting, the elastic seal member   50 can be shifted from the position indicated   with a solid line in Figs. 6 and 7 to the position indicated  with a dashed   line A3 in Figs. 6 and 7.<br>
In Fig. 6, in the apparatus   according to the fourth embodiment,   since, for example, the membrane   (film, sheet) 2 has a thin thickness  and a relatively   weak force suffices for sucking the membrane   2 by the suction chamber  40, the distance   between   the T die 1 and the casting roll 3 is shown to be short.   In Fig. 7, in the apparatus   according  to the fourth embodiment,   since, for example, the membrane   (film, sheet) 2 is thick and the force for sucking the membrane   2<br>
I !	1<br>
by the suction chamber 40 needs to be relatively strong, the distance between the T die I and the casting roll 3 is shown to be long.<br>
Further,  although  the lower surface configuration  of the T die 1 of the apparatus   shown in Figs. 1 to 3 has a<br><br>
gradient  to spread  from a horizontal plane in the vicinity of an opening for the extrusion  of the membrane   2 toward  the external   (right-hand   side in the illustrations),   in this embodiment   shown  in Figs. 6 and 7, the lower surface configuration   of the T die 1 has two different   gradients. However, the difference   between   these T die 1 lower surface  configurations   does not particularly   make  a sense. Further,  it is also appropriate   that the elastic seal member 50 is attached   to the lower surface  of the T die 1 and is pressed   with an elastic force to be brought  into contact with the upper  surface side of the suction chamber  40.<br>
Secondly, a description  will be made hereinbelow   of an operation   of the resin-made   membrane   formation casting apparatus   according to the fourth  embodiment   thus constructed.<br>
A molten  resin  is extruded   from the T die 1 into the membrane   2 which in turn, is rolled around   the casting roll 3 to be formed  while cooled.   In the case of no use of the suction chamber  40, the membrane   2 in the molten condition is pulled by the casting roll 3 to run in a direction indicated  with a two-dot  chain line Al in Fig. 6 or 7, and at this time, air is taken  in between   the membrane   2 and the<br>
deteriorating   the quality  of the<br>
casting roll 3, thus membrane   2.<br><br>
For this reason, the sucking operation  of the suction chamber 40 produces a negative pressure  on the rear side of the membrane   2 (the right-hand   side in Figs. 6 and 7), and the pressure   difference  from the front side pressure   pulls the membrane   2 backwardly so that the membrane   2 takes the standing position shown by a solid line in Figs. 6 and 7 to enlarge  the entry  angle of the membrane   2 into the casting<br>
roll 3.<br>
For producing  the negative  pressure   on the rear side of the membrane   2, a partition  is formed on the rear  side of the membrane   2 and the air between   the partition   and the membrane   2 is sucked  by the suction chamber  40.   If this space partitioned  does not has an appropriate   dimension, an unstable   phenomenon   that the membrane   2 vibrates   by the air sucked   takes  place.   Particularly,   as indicated   with  an arrow  A2 in Fig. 6, when  the passes  through  between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber 40 to flow into the interior of the suction room 40b, the unstableness   tends  to occur.<br>
For this reason, the tip portion of the suction chamber 40 is adjusted   to take an optimal position where   the unstable  phenomenon   is hard  to occur, and for that adjustment,   there  is a need to close the gap between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber  40 to prevent   the formation<br><br>
of the air inflow passage from the external even if changing the position of the suction chamber   40.<br>
In this embodiment,   even  if the interval   between   the upper  surface  of the suction chamber  40 and the lower surface  of the Tdie 1 varies,  the elastic seal member  5 0 elastically deforms   to automatically   continue  to close the gap therebetween.    In Figs. 6 and 7, the contour configuration  of the elastic seal member  50 before the movement  of the suction chamber  40 (the contour configuration   before being pressed  by the Tdie 1 to deform) is shown  with  a two-dot  chain line.<br>
Incidentally,   in the case of largely changing the positional  relationship   between   the Tdie 1 and the casting roll 3, the elastic seal member  50 itself is replaced  with an elastic seal member   with a different  size for adjustment.<br>
Thus, in the resin-made   membrane   formation  casting apparatus   according to the fourth  embodiment   of this invention,  since the elastic seal member   50 can certainly and automatically   close the gap between   the upper  surface<br>
1!	:<br>
of the suction chamber 40 and the lower surface of the Tdie 1 even if the position of the suction chamber 40 varies, the airtightness of the pressure reduction space surrounded by the Tdie 1, the membrane 2 and the suction chamber 40 is securable,  with the result that the necessary  pressure<br><br>
reduction   level is surely  obtainable   in that pressure reduction   space.<br>
In addition,  also at the positional   adjustment   of the suction chamber   40 for the optimal  condition  which  is to be conducted   prior to the start  of the production   operation   for each membrane   (film, sheet)  2, as mentioned   above,  the elastic seal member   50 can certainly  and automatically  close the gap between   the upper  surface of the suction chamber 40 and the lower surface of the Tdie 1 even if the position of the suction chamber  40 varies, and therefore,   it is possible to surely prevent   the vibrations   of the membrane   2 taking place due to the fact that the air flows from that gap into the suction chamber  40, and the adjustment   work becomes extremely   facilitated, and even the production  operation can be started   immediately   after the adjustment   work.<br>
[5]  Description of Fifth Embodiment<br>
Figs. 8A to 8C are side-elevational   cross-sectional views each showing a structure   and fitted condition of an elastic seal member   in a casting apparatus   for resin-made membrane   formation  according to a fifth embodiment   of this invention.<br>
In this fifth embodiment,   as the elastic seal member for closing the gap between   the Tdie 1 and the suction chamber  40, instead  of the elastic seal member   50 in the<br><br>
casting apparatus   according  to the fourth  embodiment described   before  with reference   to Figs. 4 to 7, there  is used any one of plate springs 56a to 56c shown in Figs. 8A to 8C. The other components   are the same as those  in the fourth embodiment.<br>
Each of these plate springs  56a to 56c is made from a<br>
thin metal  (plate  thickness   is below  1 mm) with  a corrosion resistance  such as a stainless  steel, and is disposed<br>
' :	t       ■<br>
throughout   a width  exceeding  the overall width  of the membrane   2 and is attached   through  a fitting bolt 55 to the upper  wall 4Ia of the suction chamber  40.   Further,  each of the metallic plate springs 56a to 56c is pressed   with an elastic force to come into contact with  the lower  surface  of the T die 1, thereby   closing the gap between   the lower surface  of the T die 1 and the upper  surface  of the suction chamber  40.<br>
The plate spring 56a shown in Fig. 8A has a configuration  in which its tip portion is inflated  into an arc shape  to be returned,  and the plate spring 56b shown in Fig. SB has an angle configuration   having an arc portion at an upper section, and the plate spring 56c shown in Fig. SChas a hook-like  configuration  in which it tip side is directed upwardly.    In every  illustration,  the condition deformed  by<br><br>
the contact with the Tdie 1 is indicated  with a two-dot chain line.<br>
These plate springs 56a to 56c are made to close the gap by being brought with an elastic force into contact with both  the lower surface  of the Tdie 1 and the upper  surface of the suction chamber 40, and hence, the configuration   is not limited  to those shown  in Figs. 8A to 8C. Further,   it is also appropriate   that each of the plate  springs  56a to 56c is fitted  to the lower surface of the Tdie 1 whereas   being pressed   with an elastic force to come into contact with the upper  surface  side of the suction chamber  40.<br>
P^urthermore,   in the case of largely changing the positional  relationship   between   the Tdie 1 and the casting roll 3, each of the plate springs 56a to 56c themselves   is replaced  with a plate spring with a different  size for adjustment.<br>
Thus, the resin-made   membrane   formation   casting apparatus   according  to the fifth embodiment   of this invention  can also offer the same effects as those of the fourth  embodiment   by using the plate springs  56a to 56c shown in Figs. 8A to 8C.<br>
[6] Description of Sixth Embodiment<br>
Figs. 9 to 16 are illustrations  of a casting apparatus   for resin-made   membrane   formation   according to a sixth<br><br>
embodiment   of this invention.    Of these illustrations,  Figs. 9 and  10 are respectively  an illustrative   side elevational  view and an illustrative   front elevational   view, Figs. 11  and  1 2 are a perspective  view and a side elevational cross-sectional view respectively   showing  a structure   and fitted  condition of an elastic seal member  thereof,  Fig. 13 is a side-elevational  cross-sectional   view showing  a mounted condition  of the elastic seal member,   Fig. 14 is a side-elevational  cross-sectional   view showing a mounted condition of the elastic seal member  different  in size from Fig. 13 member,   and Figs. 15 and 16 are illustrative   side elevational   views each for describing  an example   of operations   thereof.    In the illustrations,   the same numerals as those in the above description  denote  the same or corresponding   portions,  and hence, the explanation   thereof will sometimes   be omitted.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the casting apparatus according  to the sixth embodiment   is also composed  of a T die (die) 1 for extruding  a resin molten  by an extruding machine  (not shown)  into a film-like  or sheet-like membrane   2, a casting roll (cooling roll) 3 for receiving  the membrane   2 extruded   from the T die 1 on its outer circumferential   surface to cool and deliver  it, and a suction chamber  40 for sucking air between   the membrane   2 and<br><br>
the casting roll 3 to make the membrane   2 stably come<br>
closely into contact with the surface of the casting roll 3.<br>
Further,  the casting roll 13 is supported   on a roll supporting<br>
shaft  16 to be rotatable   with respect  to a side frame   17,<br>
wheels  18 to be used when moving this apparatus   in a<br>
horizontal  direction  are fitted  to lower portions  of the side<br>
frame   17.<br>
Also in this embodiment,   the suction chamber   40 is<br>
provided   independently   of the Tdie \.   Further,   the suction chamber   40 is formed  along the outer circumferential<br>
surface of the casting roll 3, and a necessary   seal gap is<br>
defined  between   the suction chamber  40 and the outer<br>
circumferential   surface of the casting roll 3.  The dimension<br>
(interval)   of this gap is set to ensure  a necessary   suction<br>
force (pressure   reduction level) in a close contact section<br>
between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3<br>
concurrently   with allowing the rotation  of the casting roll 3.<br>
As shown  ih Figs. 11, 13 and  14, the suction chamber<br>
ji	■   ;<br>
40 is constructed   as being similar to the suction chamber 4 0<br>
in the fourth  embodiment   described   before with reference<br>
to Figs. 4 to 7.<br>
A vacuum pump 5 is coupled through  a suction duct<br>
60 to the suction chamber 40, and on the operation  of the<br>
vacuum pump 5, the air between   the membrane   2 and the<br><br>
casting roll 3 is sucked  through   a suction inlet (opening section) 40a of the suction chamber  40.  Further, the suction inlet 40a is formed  throughout   the overall width  of the membrane   2 in the proximity   of a portion  at which  the membrane   2 starts   to come closely into contact with the outer circumferential   surface  of the casting roll 3.<br>
Moreover, in the sixth embodiment,   as in the case of the first embodiment,   a driving  member   110 is used as a circumferentially   moving mechanism   for moving  the suction chamber  40 along the circumferential   directions   of the casting roll 3 while holding the necessary   seal gap.  This driving member   110 is constructed   such that its proximal side is supported   coaxially with a roll supporting   shaft (rotary  shaft)  16 of the casting roll 3 to be rotatable around the roll shaft  16 (directions  of arrows   A in Fig. 9) while its tip side is fixed to the suction chamber  40.<br>
In addition, the driving member   110 has two elongated  holes 110a made along the radial directions of the casting roll 3, and by adjusting the tightening  positions  of supporting   bolts 11 penetrating   these elongated holes 110a, the suction chamber  40 is fitted with respect  to the driving member   110 to be movable  in the radial directions  of the casting roll 3, that is, so that a necessary   seal gap between the outer circumferential   surface  of the casting roll 3 and<br><br>
the suction chamber  40 is adjustable.    A radially  moving mechanism   is constructed   with the aforesaid  elongated holes  UOa and supporting   bolts 11.   In Fig. 10, only one end portion  side of the apparatus   according  to this embodiment in the width direction  is shown, but the other end portion side is constructed   in a similar way.<br>
Furthermore,   an elastic seal member  50 is interposed between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber  40 and the interval  between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber  40 is sealed with the elastic seal member   50.<br>
This elastic seal member   50 is disposed  throughout   a width exceeding  the overall width of the membrane   2 as well as the elastic seal member  50 in the fourth embodiment   described   with reference   to Figs. 4 to 7, and is composed  of an elastic seal body 51 and fixtures  (fitting tools) 52, 53 as shown in Figs. 11 to 14.<br>
The elastic seal body 51 is made of a foaming agent such as a polyimide foam having an excellent heat resistance,   a high impact resilience  and a less compressive permanent   strain, and formed  into a semicircular   bar-like configuration  in cross section, with its front surface  being covered  with a glass cloth (made  by integrally   adhering   an aluminium   foil through  an adhesive  to a glass cloth) coated with an aluminium  foil.<br><br>
This elastic seal body 51 is fixed to the suction chamber 40 in a manner  that its lower portion is held between   rising portions  52b, 53b of the fixtures  52, 53 in the forward and backward directions and the fixtures 52, 5 3 are fixedly tightened   with  fitting bolts 55 with respect  to the upper  wall 41a of the suction chamber  40.<br>
Furthermore,   as shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the elastic seal member   50 closes the gap between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber  40 in a manner   that the elastic seal body<br>
51 is pressed  by an elastic force to be brought  into contact with the T die 1.<br>
The fixture 53 is disposed  to be placed on the fixture 52, and in a state where elongated  holes 52a made on the fixture  52 side are aligned  with elongated   holes 53a made on the fixture  53 side, the fitting bolts 55 are inserted through  washers  54 into these elongated holes 52a, 53a and tightened   with respect  to the upper  wall 41a of the suction chamber  40 so that the fixtures  52, 53 are fixed integrally. As shown in Fig. 12, upper wall 41a side female screws to be engaged  with the fitting bolts 55 are constructed   as blind screws in a rear plate 41e.<br>
As shown in Fig. 14, the elongated  holes 52a are made for the purpose of changing the position of the fixture 53 so<br><br>
that elastic seal bodies 51 different   in size can be fitted  to the suction chamber  40.<br>
In Figs. 9, 13 and 15, in the apparatus   according to the sixth embodiment,   since, for example, the membrane   2 has a thin thickness   and a relatively   weak force suffices for sucking  the membrane   2 by the suction chamber   40, the<br>
:	I<br>
distance!: between   the T die 1 and the casting roll 3 is shown to be short.   In Figs. 14 and 16, in the apparatus   according to the sixth embodiment,   since, for example,  the membrane   2 is thick and the force for sucking the membrane   2 by the suction chamber  40 needs  to be relatively   strong, the distance  between   the T die 1 and the casting roll 3 is shown to be long.<br>
Secondly, a description   will be made hereinbelow  of an operation  of the resin-made   membrane   formation casting apparatus   according to the sixth embodiment   thus constructed.<br>
Basically, the apparatus   according to the sixth embodiment   takes an operation   similar to that in the first embodiment   shown in Fig. 1. In this embodiment,   as shown in Figs. 15 and  16, the interval   between   the T die 1 and the casting roll 3 is enlarged  by retreating   the casting roll 3. However, if only retreating   the casting roll 3, the side surface  opening section made  by the membrane  2, the outer<br><br>
circumferential   surface of the casting roll 3 and the tip portion of the suction chamber 40 enlarges, so that difficulty is experienced   to reach the necessary   pressure   reduction<br>
level.<br>
For this reason, as shown in Fig. 15. the suction chamber 40 fitted to the driving member   110 is advanced  to a given; position to make the side surface opening section small and the air within the suction chamber  40 is sucked by the vacuum pump 5 up to a necessary pressure  reduction level, so that the membrane 2 in a molten  condition immediately   after the extrusion  from the T die 1 can stably be brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3.<br>
Moreover,  as mentioned   above, even if the gap (interval)   between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber  4 0 varies  by changing  the dimension   of the interval   between the T die 1 and the casting roll 3 or the position  of the suction chamber  40, in this embodiment,   the elastic seal member   50 is interposed   between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber  40, and therefore,   the elastic seal member 50 can close the gap between   the T die 1 and the suction chamber  40 while following that variation.<br>
In this embodiment,   even  if the interval   between   the upper  surface  of the suction chamber  40 and the lower surface  of the T die 1 varies, the elastic seal member   5 0<br><br>
elastically deforms  to automatically  continue to close the gap therebetween.    Whereupon,   the airtightness   of the pressure  reduction   space surrounded   by the T die 1, the inembrahe   2 and the suction chamber  40 is securable,  thus<br>
I<br>
surely   obtaining  the necessary   pressure   reduction   level in that pressure   reduction   space.   In Figs. 13 and  14, the contour configuration  of the elastic seal member   50 before the movement   of the suction chamber  40 (the contour configuration   before being pressed by the Tdie 1 to deform) is shown with a dashed  line 50a.<br>
Incidentally,   in the case of largely changing  the positional relationship   between   the Tdie 1 and the casting roll 3, a» shown in Fig. 14 or 16, the elastic seal member  5 0<br>
itself is replaced with an elastic seal member   with a different  size for adjustment.<br>
It is also appropriate   that the elastic seal member   5 0 is attached  to the lower surface of the Tdie 1 and is pressed with an elastic force to come into contact with the upper surface  side of the suction chamber 40.<br>
Thus, in the resin-made   membrane   formation   casting apparatus   according to the sixth embodiment   of this invention,  since the suction chamber 40 is movable  in the circumferential   directions of the casting roll 3 while keeping a necessary  seal gap with respect  to the casting roll 3, and<br><br>
further   is movable  in the radial directions  of the casting roll 3, and hence, the seal gap between   the suction chamber   4 0<br>
and the, casting roll 3 is adjustable,  besides  the elastic seal<br>
i<br>
membefj   50 can seal the gap between   the lower surface  of the Tdie 1 and the upper  surface of the suction chamber 4 0<br>
irrespective   of the dimension  of the gap.<br>
Accordingly,  since the pressure   reduction  in the space between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3 is stably achievable  by the suction chamber  40 regardless   of the dimension   of the interval   between   the Tdie 1 and the casting roll 3, the interval   between   the Tdie I and the casting roll 3 can appropriately   set for any kind of resin, with the result  that the necessary   film characteristic (membrane   characteristic)  is securable  to sharply enhancing   the quality  of the resin-made   membrane   (film or sheet) 2.<br>
[7] Description of Seventh Embodiment<br>
Figs. 17A to 17C are side-elevational   cross-sectional views each showing  a structure and fitted condition  of an elastic seal member   in a resin-made   membrane   formation casting apparatus   according to a seventh   embodiment   of this invention.<br>
In this seventh  embodiment,  instead of the elastic seal member   50 in the above-described   sixth embodiment, used<br><br>
I I<br>
are ariy one of plate  springs  56a to 56c similar  to those described   before  in the fifth embodiment   as shown  in Figs. 17A to 17C. The other portions  are the same as those  in the sixth embodiment.<br>
Each of these plate springs  56a to 56c is made from a thin metal (its plate thickness  is at 1 mm or below  1 mm) with a corrosion resistance   such as a stainless   steel as in the case of the fifth embodiment,   and is disposed  throughout   a width  exceeding the overall width of the membrane   2 and is attached   through  a fitting bolt 55 to the upper  wall 41a of the suction chamber 40.   Further, each of the metallic plate springs 56a to 56c is pressed   with an elastic force to come into contact with the lower surface  of the T die 1, thereby closing the gap between  the lower surface of the T die 1 and the upper  surface  of the suction chamber  40.<br>
The plate spring 56a shown in Fig, 17A has a configuration  in which its tip portion is inflated  into an arc shape to be returned,  and the plate spring 56b shown in Fig. 17B has an angle configuration   having  an arc portion   at an upper section, and the plate spring 56c shown in Fig. 17C has a hook-like  configuration  in which its tip side is directed upwardly.    In every  illustration,  the condition deformed  by the contact with the Tdie 1 is indicated with a two-dot chain line.<br><br>
These plate springs 56a to 56c are made to close the gap by being brought  with an elastic force into contact with both the lower surface of the T die 1 and the upper  surface of the suction chamber  40, and hence, the configuration   is not limited  to those  shown  in Figs. 17A to 17C. Further,   it is also appropriate   that each of the plate springs  56a to 56c is fitted to the lower surface of the T die 1 whereas   being pressed   with an elastic force to come into contact with the upper  surface  side of the suction chamber  40.<br>
Furthermore,   in the case of largely changing  the positional  relationship   between   the T die 1 and the casting roll 3, each of the plate springs  56a to 56c themselves   is replaced   with a plate spring  with a different  size for adjustment.<br>
Thus, the resin-made   membrane   formation  casting apparatus   according  to the seventh   embodiment   of this<br>
'    I     ;<br>
invention can also' offer the same effects as those of the sixth embodiment by using the plate springs 56a to 56c shown in Figs. 17A to 17C.<br>
[8]  Description of Eighth Embodiment Figs. 18 to 20 are illustrations  of a casting apparatus for resin-made   membrane   formation according  to an eighth embodiment   of this invention.    Fig. 18 is a side elevational view illustratively   showing the apparatus.   Fig. 19 is a<br><br>
perspective   view showing structures   and fitted conditions of an elastic seal member   and a shielding  plate  in the apparatus,   and Fig. 20 is an illustration  of an outside  air inflow situation in a cross section taken  along aline P-P of Fig. 18.   In the illustrations,   the same  numerals   as those in the above explanation  designate  the same or corresponding parts, and the description   thereof will be omitted.<br>
Although  having  the substantially   same construction as that of the above-described sixth embodiment   as shown in Fig. 18, in this eighth embodiment,   as shown  in Figs. 1 8 and  19, to an end portion of a suction  inlet (suction opening section) 40a of a suction chamber  40, there  is fitted a shielding  plate  160 for suppressing   the suction occurring through  the end portion  by shielding the end portion opening, with the shielding plate  160 being movable  in the width directions  of a membrane   2.<br>
More specifically, as shown in Fig. 19, the shielding plate  160 has an elongated  hole 160a made  therein,  and is fitted to the suction chamber  40 by means  of fitting bolts 162 which are placed to penetrate   the elongated   hole 160a and are tightened   through  washers   161  with respect  to an upper  wall 41a of the suction chamber  40.   The shielding plate  1 60 is movable  in the width directions  of the membrane   2 owing to the elongated  hole 160 so that the<br><br>
shielding  amount  of the end portion of the suction inlet 40a of the suction chamber 40 is adjustable.    Incidentally, although  Fig. 19 shows only one end portion side of the apparatus   according to this embodiment   in the width directions,  the other end portion  side is constructed   in a similar way.<br>
[	!      ■<br>
Since the operation  of the resin-made   membrane formation  casting apparatus   according to the eighth embodiment   of this invention   thus arranged   are basically the same as that of the sixth embodiment,   a description   of this embodiment   will be made only of the effects of the shielding plate  160 with reference   to Fig. 20.<br>
In the case of the prior example  shown  in Fig. 33, as mentioned   before, the flow from the front surface  becomes a main flow in the front surface  opening section of the suction chamber  104, and therefore, because of the dynamic pressure   at the B2 portion  and the formation  of the eddy due to the suction at theBl portion, troubles  arise in that the membrane   102 vibrates   (rocks) or is taken  into the interior  of the suction chamber   104,<br>
On the other hand, in this embodiment,   as indicated with dotted  arrows  in Fig. 20, owing to the commutation effects of the shielding plate  160, the flow from the side surface  becomes  a main flow in the front surface  opening<br><br>
section, and hence, the dynamic pressure   or the formation  of eddy is suppressible   so that the vibrations  (rocking) of the membrane   2 or the introduction   thereof into the suction chamber  40 are controllable,   which allows the stable membrane   formation   irrespective   of the kind of resin.<br>
Particularly,   this embodiment   can fulfill great effects when  the membrane   2 is stably  brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3 in the case of using a resin with a relatively   low extension  viscosity  for the membrane formation.<br>
Besides, if the shielding plate  160 is shifted  in accordance  with the necking  quantity   of the membrane   2, the air flow is appropriately   controllable.<br>
[9]  Description of Ninth Embodiment<br>
Figs. 21 to 23 illustrate   a casting apparatus   for resin-made membrane   formation  according to a ninth embodiment   of this invention.   Fig. 21 is a side elevational view illustratively   showing the apparatus.   Fig. 22 is a perspective   view showing structures   and fitted conditions of an elastic seal member  and a suction nozzle in the apparatus,   and Fig. 23 is an illustration  of an outside  air inflow situation  in a cross section taken  along a line Q-Qof Fig. 21.   The same numerals   as those in the above<br><br>
explanation   depict the same or corresponding   parts, and the description  thereof will be omitted.<br>
This ninth embodiment   is substantially   constructed like the above-described   sixth embodiment   as shown  in Fig. 21, except that, as shown  in Figs. 21 and 22, to an end portion  of a suction  inlet (suction opening  section) 40a of a suction chamber  4 0, there  is fitted  aside suction nozzle 7 0 which sucks air from a side of the end portion.   This side suction nozzle 70 is coupled to a vacuum pump 71 and the air at the end portion  of the suction  inlet 40a of the suction chamber  40 is sucked through   the side suction nozzle 70 by the vacuum  pump  71.   Incidentally,   although   the Fig. 22 shows only one end portion of the apparatus   according to this embodiment in the width  directions,  the other end portion  side is constructed   in a similar way.<br>
Basically, the operation   of the resin-made   membrane formation  casting apparatus   according to the ninth embodiment   thus arranged   is the same as that of the sixth embodiment,   and therefore,  the description  thereof to be made referring   to Fig. 23 is limited to only the effects of the side suction nozzle 70.<br>
In this embodiment,   as indicated  with dotted  arrows in Fig. 23, owing to the suction operation   of the side suction nozzle 70, the flow due to the suction by the side suction<br><br>
nozzle 70 is a main flow so that the dynamic  pressure   and the formation  of eddy are suppressible   and, hence, the vibrations   (rocking) of the membrane   2 or the introduction thereof into the suction chamber  40 is suppressible,   with the result  that the stable  membrane   formation   is feasible irrespective   of the kind of resin.<br>
Particularly,   this embodiment   can fulfill great effects when  the membrane   2 is stably  brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3 in the case of using a resin with a relatively   low extension  viscosity for the membrane formation.<br>
Besides, if the air suction amounts   into the suction chamber  40 and the side suction nozzle 70 by the vacuum pumps  5 and 71 are controlled respectively, the air flow is appropriately   controllable.<br>
[10]   Description of Tenth Embodiment<br>
'!     .        - '<br>
Figs. 24 to 26 are illustrations   of a casting apparatus for resin-made   membrane   formation  according to a tenth embodiment   of this invention.   Fig. 24 is a side elevational view illustratively   showing the apparatus,   Fig. 25 is a perspective   view showing structures   and fitted conditions of an elastic seal member,  a shielding plate and a suction liozzle in the apparatus,   and Fig. 26 is an illustration   of an outside  air inflow situation  in a cross section taken  along a<br><br>
line R-Rof Fig, 24.  In the illustrations, the same numerals   as<br>
those in the above explanation  designate  the same or corresponding   parts,  and the description   thereof  will be omitted.<br>
This tenth  embodiment   has the substantially same structure   as that of the above-described   sixth embodiment as shown  in Fig. 24, except that both a shielding  plate   160 described   in the eighth embodiment   and side suction nozzle 70 described   in the ninth  embodiment   are provided   as shown  in Figs. 24 and 25.<br>
In more detail, to an end portion  of a suction inlet (suction opening  section) 40a of a suction chamber  40 there is fitted  the shielding  plate  160 which shields  that end portion opening to suppress   the suction occurring  through the end portion, with the shielding plate  160 being movable in the width  directions  of a membrane   2.  Further,  to this shielding plate  160 (that is, the end portion of the suction inlet 40a of the suction chamber   40), there  is attached   the<br>
1 'i	i<br>
side suction nozzle 70 which sucks air from aside of the end<br>
'I	,   ■<br>
portion.   This side suction nozzle 70 is coupled  to a vacuum<br>
pump  71, so that the air at the end portion  of the suction<br>
inlet 40a of the suction chamber 40 is sucked  through   the<br>
side suction nozzle 70 by means of the vacuum pump 7 1.<br><br>
Furthermore,   as well as the eighth embodiment,   as shown  in Fig. 25, an elongated   hole 160a  is made  in the shielding  plate  160, and the shielding  plate   160 is fitted  to the suction chamber  40 in a manner   that fitting  bolts  162 penetrate   the elongated  hole 160a and is tightened   through washers   161  with respect to an upper  wall 41a of the suction chamber  40.   The shielding  plate  160 is movable   in the width  directions  of the membrane   2 owing to the elongated   hole 160, thereby   adjusting   the shielding amount at the end portion  of the suction inlet 40a of the suction chamber  40.<br>
Incidentally,   although   the Fig. 25 shows only one end portion  side of the apparatus   according  to this embodiment in the width  directions,  the other end portion  side is constructed   in a similar way.<br>
Basically, the operation   of the resin-made   membrane formation  casting apparatus   according to the tenth embodiment   thus constructed   is the same as that of the sixth embodiment,   and hence, the description  will be made of only the effects of the shielding plate  160 and the side suction nozzle 70 with reference   to Fig. 26.<br>
In this embodiment,   as indicated   with dotted   arrows<br>
M<br>
in Fig.'26, owing to the suction operation  of the side suction nozzle 70, the flow due to the suction by the side suction<br><br>
nozzle 70 is amain flow, and further  the shielding plate  160 commutates   the suction into the suction chamber  40, so that the dynamic  pressure   and the formation  of eddy  are suppressible   and, hence, the vibrations   (rocking)  of the membrane   2 or the introduction thereof into the suction chamber  40 is suppressible,   with the result that the stable membrane   formation   is feasible  irrespective   of the kind  of resin.<br>
Particularly,   this embodiment   can fulfill great effects when  the membrane   2 is stably   brought closely into contact with the casting roll 3 in the case of using a resin with a relatively   low extension  viscosity for the membrane formation.<br>
Besides, if the air suction amounts  into the suction chamber  40 and the side suction nozzle 70 by the vacuum pumps  5 and 71 are controlled respectively, the air flow is appropriately   controllable.<br>
[11]   Description of Eleventh Embodiment<br>
Figs. 27 and 28 are respectively   a side elevational view and a front elevational   view each illustratively showing  a casting apparatus   for resin-made   membrane formation  according  to an eleventh  embodiment   of this invention.<br>
:  !<br><br>
This eleventh   embodiment   relates  to a resin-made membrane   formation  casting apparatus   constructed   in a manner  that a radially moving mechanism   for shifting a suction chamber 40 in radial directions of a casting roll 3 to adjust the seal gap therebetween   to a necessary   dimension is added to the above-described   casting apparatus   according to the second embodiment.    In the illustrations,   the same numerals   as those in the above description   designate   the same or corresponding   parts,  and the description   thereof will be omitted  for brevity.<br>
In the casting apparatus   according to the eleventh embodiment,   as shown  in Figs. 27 and 28, a guide frame (guide member)   13 is used as a circumferentially   moving mechanism  for shifting the suction chamber  40 in the circumferential   directions of the casting roll 3 while keeping the necessary   seal gap.<br>
This guide frame  13 is fitted through  fitting bolts 12 to a side frame   17 for rotatably   supporting   a side end portion of a roll supporting   shaft  16 of the casting roll 3. This guide frame   13 has an elongated   hole-like  guide rail  13a made  to engage with two pins (or rollers)  11a fitted onto a side surface of the suction chamber  40 to guide the suction chamber  40 along the circumferential   directions  of the casting roll 3.<br><br>
Furthermore,   in this embodiment,   in a manner   of adjusting  the fitting height position of the guide frame   1 3 relative   to the side frame   17 by the fitting bolts  12, the necessary   seal gap between   the outer circumferential surface  of the casting roll 3 and the suction chamber  40 is adjustable.    That is, the aforesaid  fitting  bolts 12 function as the radially  moving mechanism.<br>
Incidentally,   although  Fig. 28 shows only one end portion  side of the apparatus according  to this embodiment in the width  directions,   the other  end portion   side is arranged   in a similar way.<br>
Moreover,  the interval   between   the lower surface  of the Tdie 1 and the upper  surface of the suction chamber 4 0 is closed with the above-mentioned elastic seal member   5 0 attached   to the suction chamber  40.<br>
The resin-made   membrane   formation  casting apparatus   according to the eleventh  embodiment   of this invention   thus constructed  differs from the sixth embodiment   only in the constructions   of the circumferentially   moving mechanism  and the radially moving mechanism,   and can provide   the same effects as those of the sixth embodiment.<br>
Even in this eleventh  embodiment,   it is also possible to use the elastic seal member   50 or any one of the metallic<br><br>
plate springs 56a to 56c described   in the fourth  to seventh embodiments,   and to use the shielding plate  160 or the side suction nozzle 70 described  in the eighth to tenth embodiments.<br>
[12]   Description of Twelfth Embodiment<br>
Figs. 29 and 30 are respectively   a side elevational view anid  a front elevational   view illustratively   showing  a casting apparatus   for resin-made   membrane   formation according to a twelfth  embodiment   of this invention.<br>
In this twelfth  embodiment,   a radially  moving mechanism  for shifting  a suction chamber 40 in radial directions  of a casting roll 3 to adjust the seal gap therebetween   to a necessary   dimension   is provided   in the above-described   casting apparatus   according to the third embodiment.    In the illustrations,   the same numerals   as those in the above explanation  designate  the same or corresponding   components,  and the description   thereof will be omitted  for simplicity.<br>
In the casting apparatus   according  to the twelfth embodiment,   as shown in Figs. 29 and 30, a driving member 20 and a guide frame  (guide member)  23 are used as a circumferentially   moving mechanism   for shifting  the suction chamber 40 along the circumferential   directions  of the casting roll 3 while maintaining   the necessary   seal gap.<br><br>
In this constitution,  in the driving member   20, its proximal   side is supported   coaxially with a roll supporting shaft  16 of the casting roll 3 to be rotatable   around   the roll supporting   shaft 16 while its tip side is attached   through fitting bolts 22 to the guide frame  23.   This guide frame  2 3 has an elongated   hole-like guide rail 23a made  to engage with two pins (or rollers)  11a, Ua fitted  to a side surface  of the suction chamber  40 to guide the suction chamber   4 0 along the circumferential   directions  of the casting roll 3.<br>
Furthermore,   in this embodiment,   in a manner of adjusting   the fitting  height position  of the guide frame  2 3 relative, to the driving  member   20 by the fitting  bolts 22, the necessary   seal gap between   the outer circumferential surface  of the casting roll 3 and the suction chamber  40 is adjustable.   That is, the aforesaid fitting bolts 22 function as the radially moving mechanism.<br>
Incidentally,   although  Fig. 30 shows only one end portion  side of the apparatus   according  to this embodiment in the width directions,  the other end portion  side is arranged   in a similar way.<br>
Moreover, the interval  between   the lower surface  of the T die 1 and the upper  surface of the suction chamber 4 0 is closed with the above-mentioned   elastic seal member   5 0 attached   to the suction chamber  40.<br><br>
In the resin-made   membrane   formation  casting apparatus   according  to the twelfth  embodiment   of this invention   thus constructed,   as in the case of the third embodiment,   in the case that the interval  between  the Tdie 1 and the casting  roll 3 is large, a rough  adjustment   is made such that the suction chamber  40 is shifted  by the driving member   20 counterclockwise   around  the roll supporting shaft  16 to advance   to an adequate   position, and subsequently   a fine adjustment   is made such that the suction chamber  40 is shifted  along the elongated hole-like guide rail 23a of the guide frame 23 to be positioned  at a given position, thus positioning  the suction  inlet 40a of the suction chamber 4 0 in the vicinity of a close-contact starting portion  between   the membrane   2 and the casting roll 3.<br>
On the contrary,   in the case of the interval   between the Tide 1 and the casting roll 3 being small, the rough adjustment   is made  such that the suction chamber  40 is shifted  by the driving  member  20 clockwise around   the roll supporting   shaft 16 to retreat  to an adequate   position and, subsequently,   the fine adjustment   is made  such that the suction chamber  40 is shifted  along the elongated  hole-like guide rail 23a of the guide frame 23 to be positioned  at a given position.<br><br>
This resin-hade   membrane   formation  casting apparatus   according to the twelfth embodiment   of this invention  can offer the same effects as those of the third embodiment,   and further,   because  of being different  from the sixth embodiment   only in the constructions   of the circumferentially   moving mechanism   and the radially moving  mechanism, can provide  the same effects as those of the sixth embodiment.<br>
Even in this twelfth  embodiment,   it is also possible  to use the elastic member   50 or any one of the metallic  plate springs 56a to 56c described   in the fourth  to seventh embodiments,   and to use the shielding  plate  160 or the side suction nozzle 70 described  in the eighth to tenth embodiments.<br><br><br><br><br>
