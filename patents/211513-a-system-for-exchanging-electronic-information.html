GRANTED<br><br>
23-2-2006<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
ORIGINAL<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a system for exchanging electronic information<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system, apparatus and method of providing enhanced features in a telecommunications system. More specifically, the present invention relates to the automated exchange of electronic information between subscribers during a voice telephone call.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The convergence of the old, private switched telephone network ("PSTN") for carrying voice with more modern packet networks for carrying data is radically changing the structure of networks and the services that rely on these networks. Thus, it is now possible for individual subscribers to communicate using a variety of services, such as voice, web-browsers, fax or email.<br>
In fact, subscribers typically communicate over networks using more than one service. When meeting face-to-face, it is common for subscribers to exchange business cards that bear personal information about each other, including telephone numbers, web-sites, fax numbers and email addresses. Subscribers may choose to convert this written information into electronic form by entering this information into their computers or personal digital assistants for later use. Such a process can be tedious, and has lead to the use of business card scanners which attempt to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on the card.<br>
Where subscriber's exchange an email, or visit each other's web-site, then the process of locally creating and storing electronic information about each other is less tedious. Email and web-based data services, in particular, allow subscribers to readily cut-and-paste a variety of personal information from one application to another, and to retain local copies of that information in electronic form.<br>
However, it is currently very tedious to exchange personal information when subscribers initiate contact with each other via a voice telephone call. Current technology requires that each subscriber manually transcribe, either in writing or by typing on a keyboard, the majority of personal information about the other subscriber. Caller-id services, when coupled with a personal computer,<br><br><br>
can assist in the electronic transcription of a caller's name and phone number, but are otherwise limited,in utility. The transcription of email addresses, website addresses and other personal information are still done manually. Furthermore, the exchange of more detailed information, such as maps, catalogues, or other documents, between subscribers is hampered until website addresses, email addresses or facsimile numbers have been exchanged.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel system, apparatus and method of exchanging electronic information via a communication link that obviates or mitigates at least one of the above-identified disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, there is provided a system for exchanging electronic information that comprises a first voice terminal for conducting voice telephone calls and receiving subscriber-input and a data terminal associated with a subscriber of the first voice telephone and for receiving and presenting data to the subscriber. The system also Comprises a second voice terminal for conducting voice telephone calls and receiving subscriber-input and a network that interconnects all of the terminals. The network includes persistent storage for storing an electronic address of the data terminal and electronic information respective to a subscriber of the second voice terminal. The network also includes a processing unit that is operable to transmit the electronic information to the data terminal during a telephone call.<br>
The data terminal can be a personal computer executing an email client program, which is connected to the network via an email server. Each voice terminal can be POTS (plain old telephone system) telephone, or it can be a wireless phone such as a mobile phone. As used herein, the terms voice terminal and/or data terminal are also referred to as subscriber stations.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method for exchanging electronic information in a network comprising the steps of:<br>
initiating a voice telephone connection between a first voice terminal and a second voice terminal; and<br>
transferring electronic information associated with the second voice terminal to a data terminal associated with the first voice terminal.<br><br>
The method can further comprise the step, after the initiating step, of completing the voice telephone connection.<br>
The method can further comprise the step, after the initiating step, of receiving a request to transfer electronic information associated with the second voice terminal to a first data terminal associated with the first voice terminal.<br>
The method can further comprise the step, after the transferring step, of receiving the electronic information at the data terminal and processing the electronic information according to user preferences.<br>
The electronic information can, for example, be embedded in the body of an email address or encoded as series of DTMF tones that can be decoded by the data terminal, such as where the data terminal is a computer having a modem operable to decode DTMF tones.<br>
The data terminal and the voice terminal can be integrally formed into a single device, such as a web-enabled mobile phone, or a rich-featured telephone having a multi-line display.<br>
The electronic information can include any information that is desired to send to another subscriber. For example, electronic information can include email addresses, postal addresses, website addresses, facsimile numbers, or telephone numbers. Having exchanged basic levels of electronic information, such as an email address, it is contemplated that a variety of applications can be used to allow subscribers to simultaneously conduct their voice telephone call and exchange and/or view electronic information. For example, it is expected that the present invention would be particularly useful for customers conducting transactions with business via a telephone, as a confirmation of the transactions could automatically be sent to the customer's data terminal. For example, where the customer is a traveler, and the business is a travel agency, then the traveler's itinerary could be automatically sent to the traveler, or reviewed simultaneously by the traveler during the selection of the traveler's various bookings. Alternatively, where the customer is conducting business with a financial institution by telephone, then confirmations of the customer's financial transaction could automatically be electronically delivered to the customer.<br>
The present invention provides a novel system, method and apparatus for exchanging electronic information during a voice telephone call. A subscriber during a voice telephone call can provide subscriber-input to their telephone or to request a transfer of electronic information to one or<br><br><br><br>
more other subscribers during a voice telephone call. The present invention thus obviates the need for manually transcribing electronic information such as email addresses, facsimile number or web-page addresses during a voice telephone call.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the attached Figures, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a system for exchanging electronic information in accordance with an embodiment of the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a flowchart showing a method for exchanging electronic information in accordance with another embodiment of the invention;<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic representation of a system for exchanging electronic information in accordance with another embodiment of the invention; and<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic representation of a system for exchanging electronic information in accordance with another embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to Figure 1, a system for exchanging electronic information in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is indicated generally at 20. System 20 includes a public communication network 24, such as .the PSTN, which interconnects service provider nodes 28a and 28b, such as telephone company switches, central offices and/or wireless base stations. In turn, service provider nodes 28 are each connected to at least one subscriber node 32 via a communication link 36. Where service provider node 28 is a telephone company switch, then communication link 36 will typically be wired, however, communication link 36 can also be wireless, as for example, where service provider node 28 is a base station in a wireless local loop or cellular telephone system.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, in a present embodiment there are two subscriber nodes 32a and 32b, connected to service provider nodes 28a and 28b, respectively. (It is contemplated that system 20 will typically include a plurality of subscriber nodes in addition to nodes 32a and 32b.) As used herein, the term "caller" or "calling" means a call initiated at one of the subscriber nodes 32. Similarly, the term "callee" means a call received by one of the subscriber nodes. For example,<br><br><br>
where subscriber node 32a is the caller", then subscriber node 32b is the "callee".<br>
In a present embodiment, each subscriber node 32 includes a microprocessor 40which interconnects a telephone handset 44, a monitor 48 or other user-output device, and a keyboard 52 or other user-input device. It is to be understood that the various components in subscriber nodes 32 can be substituted for substantially equivalent components, and/or combined into a single intelligent device, such as a personal digital assistant and/or rich-featured phone.<br>
Using telephone handset 44, microprocessor 40 is operable to process voice calls carried over public communication network 24. Similarly, using keyboard 52 and monitor 48, microprocessor 40 is operable to process at least one data service, such as e-mail, for carriage over communication network 24. As will be explained in greater detail below, microprocessor 40 is further operable to automatically obtain information about the data service of other subscriber nodes 32 during a voice call.<br>
System 20 further includes an electronic information object 56 associated with each subscriber node 32 that is typically resident at the service provider node 28 respective to its subscriber node 32. Electronic information object 56 is typically a data file that includes personal information about the subscriber at each subscriber node 32. In a present embodiment, such personal information includes, at least, title email address of its respective subscriber node 32. However, data object 56 can also include other personal information, such as that typically found on a business card, such as the name, postal address, telephone number, facsimile number and website address of the subscriber node 32 respective to the data object 56.<br>
A method of exchanging electronic information in accordance with another embodiment of the invention will now be discussed with reference to Figure 2. For purposes of assisting in the explanation of the present embodiment, reference will be made to the foregoing discussion of system 20. At step 100, a voice call is initiated in any usual manner. For example, the receiver of telephone set 44a at subscriber node 32a is lifted off the hook and a number is dialed. It will be assumed for purposes of explaining the present embodiment that the telephone number of subscriber node 32b is dialed. This dialed number is processed by service provider node 28a, which utilizes public communication network 24 to contact service provider node 28b, which in turn sends a ringing signal to subscriber node 32b and tings telephone set 44b.<br>
Next, at step 105, the call initiated at step 100 is established, and a voice connection is<br><br>
completed. Continuing with the example, telephone set 44b is answered, thus completing a voice call between subscriber node 32a and subscriber node 32b. It will be understood that the steps of initiating and completing a voice call between subscriber nodes 32a and 32b could occur in other ways, for example, the call could have been initiated at subscriber node 32b.<br>
The method then advances to step 110, where a request for an exchange of electronic information is received. In a presently preferred embodiment, it is contemplated that the request for the exchange of electronic information can be initiated at either subscriber station 32a or subscriber station 32b. Such a request can be to: 1) send electronic information object 56a to subscriber station 32b and/or 2) send electronic information object 56b to subscriber station 32a.<br>
Continuing with the present example, the request is accomplished using the flash-key on telephone set 44a, which is an "attention" signal mat is sent to service provider node 28a in order to signal service provider node 28a that the subscriber at subscriber node 32a wishes to Invoke a calling feature available at service provider node 28a. The use of the flash-key is followed by a predetermined dialing sequence. (Preferably the predetermined sequence is not currently in use for the invocation of other calling features, such as 3-way calling.) For example, the use of the flash-key can be followed by *222 in order to request that electronic information object 56a be sent to subscriber station 32b, or *333 in order to request that electronic information object 56b be sent to subscriber station 32a, or *444 in order to request that electronic information object 56a be sent to subscriber station 32b and that electronic information object 56b be sent to subscriber station 32a. Accordingly, service provider node 28a has now received the request for an exchange of electronic information.<br>
The method then advances to step 115, where the actual electronic information is transfened according to the request received at step 110. Thus, as appropriate me data contained in electronic information object 56a is transferred to subscriber station 32b and/or the data contained in electronic information object 56b is transferred to subscriber station 32a.<br>
The transfer can occur in a variety of ways. For example, using a suitable variation of existing caller-id technology, electronic information object 56a can be encoded into a series of DTMF tones by service provider node 28a, which are then sent over the voice connection and then decoded by software executing on microprocessor 40b. Using this method, it can be desired to mute the earpiece at both telephone set 44a and telephone set 44b during the transfer of the DTMF tones.<br><br><br>
However, the transfer of electronic information objects 56 can be accomplished in a variety of other ways. For example, in order to transfer electronic information object 56a to subscriber node 32b, software executing on service provider node 28a can query electronic information object 56b in order to access the e-mail address of subscriber node 32b. Having obtained the email address of subscriber node 32b, the complete set of electronic information stored in electronic information object 56a can simply be sent via email to subscriber node 32b. Thus, where communication link 36b is a voice telephone line with DSL internet service, the email containing the information in object 56a will arrive at microprocessor 40b for use at subscriber node 32b via the DSL link on the voice telephone line. (It will thus be apparent that, in general, link 36 is operable to carry both voice and data, and could be implemented in a variety of ways. For example, the voice portion of link 3 6 may be a wired link, while the data portion of link 36 may be via a cable-modem. Alternatively, link 36 can be a wireless link operable to carry both voice and data channels. Other implementations of link 36 will occur to those of skill in the art.)<br>
Other means of transferring information objects 56 to other subscriber nodes 32 will occur to those of skill in the art and are within the scope of the invention.<br>
The method then advances to step 120 where the electronic information is received and processed, thus completing the transfer at step 115. For example, microprocessor 40b receives the information contained in electronic information object 56a and stores it in persistent storage local to microprocessor 40b. The stored information can then be used by the subscriber interacting with applications executing on subscriber node 32b, in order to send emails or faxes to subscriber node 32a, or to access the web-pages belonging to subscriber node 32a.<br>
It will be understood that, once subscriber node 32b has the email address of the subscriber node 32a (or vice-versa), virtually any type of electronic information can be sent, (either automatically or at the request of each subscriber), between the stations 32a, 32b, depending on the application(s) executing on each subscriber station 32a, 32b. For example, where subscriber station 32a is an individual consumer, and subscriber station 32b is a travel agent, then a software application executing on subscriber station 32b can provide the consumer with an email including an complete travel itinerary, confirmation bookings, electronic airline-tickets, and the like.<br>
While in the embodiment shown in Figure 1 (and marked as system 20) shows a telephone handset 44 local to an email client executing on microprocessor 40, it will be understood that in<br><br><br><br>
other embodiments of the invention handset 44 need not be local to the email client. For example, an alternative embodiment is shown in Figure 3 and marked as system 220. Components in system 220 that are substantially the same as components in system 20 have a reference number 200 greater than the reference number of the component in system 20.   As shown in Figure 3, system 220 includes a mobile handset 244c that is connected to network node 228c via a wireless link 236c. Thus, in a present embodiment, network node 228c is a wireless base station. Mobile handset 244c is associated with electronic information object 256a and subscriber node 232a. In the present embodiment, subscriber node 232a is essentially a data terminal executing an email client program. (Such an email client is typically connected to an email server via connected to network 224, as is known to those of skill in the art.) Electronic information about mobile handset 244c and node 232a (such as the email address of subscriber node 232a and the telephone number of handset 244c) are stored in electronic information object 256a. During a voice telephone call between mobile handset 244c and handset 244b, the data on information objects 256a and 256b can be exchanged between nodes 232a and 232b in substantially the same manner as discussed in the method of Figure 2, with appropriate modifications. For example, using a predefined series of key-strokes on handset 244c, instructions can be sent to network node 228c, that cause software executing on network node 228c to query information object 256b and obtain the email address of subscriber node 232b. Next, network node 228c can use mis email address to email information object 256a to subscriber node 232b. Next, as desired, a subscriber at subscriber node 232b can use the contents information object 256a to arrange for electronic interactions directly with subscriber node 232a, such as sending information subscriber node 232a via email. It will now be apparent that other configurations, combinations and/or arrangements of voice handsets and email clients associated with a particular subscriber can be implemented, as desired.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention is shown as system 320 in Figure 4. Components in system 320 that are substantially the same as components in system 20 have a reference number 300 greater than the reference number of the component in system 20. System 320 includes a first network node, which in a present embodiment is an Email server 328a. In turn, Email server 328a is • connected to a subscriber station, which in the present embodiment is a data terminal 332a executing an email client program.<br>
System 320 also includes two additional network nodes, which in a present embodiment are<br><br><br><br>
PSTN switches 328b and 328c, Email server 328a and PSTN switches 328b and 328c are all interconnected by a network 324, which in a present embodiment combines the functionality of the PSTN for carrying voice traffic and the Internet for carrying data traffic.<br>
PSTN switch 328c stores a Caller ID object 390a which contains the email address of data terminal 332a.<br>
PSTN switches 328b and 328c are each connected via links 336c, 336b (respectively) to voice terminals, which in a present embodiment are POTS telephones 344c and 344b (respectively). PSTN switch 328b stores a plurality of electronic information objects 356a, 356b, and 356c which are associated with POTS telephone 344b. Each information object 356a, 356b and 356c can contain any type of information, as desired, and can be configured and/or defined by the subscriber at POTS telephone 334b. For instance, information object 356a can contain a map of directions to the residence of the subscriber of POTS telephone 334b; information object 356b can contain a complete business card, including phone numbers, email addresses and postal addresses of the subscriber at POTS telephone 334b; and information object 356c can contain a family photograph. It is to be emphasized, however, that there can be any number information objects 356 and that each information object 356 can contain any desired information.<br>
In operation, a caller at POTS telephone 344c dials the phone number of POTS telephone 334b. PSTN switch 328c collects the dialed digits from POTS telephone 344c and, via network 324, connects to PSTN switch 328b in order to cause POTS telephone 344b to begin ringing. Duringthe connection to PSTN switch 328b, Caller ID object 390a is delivered to PSTN Switch 328b and stored thereat for later use. Next, POTS telephone 344b is answered and a voice telephone call between POTS telephones 344c and 344b is established. During the voice telephone call, the subscriber at POTS telephone 344b decides to send electronic information to the subscriber at POTS telephone 344c. In a present embodiment, this is accomplished by pressing the 'flash' key on POTS telephone 344b, which gets the attention of PSTN switch 328b. At this point, PSTN switch 328b will typically mute the earpiece of POTS telephone 344c, and send a dial tone to the earpiece of POTS telephone 344b to obtain instructions therefrom. The subscriber at POTS telephone 344b men provides user input that a) instructs PSTN switch 328b to send an information object 356 to data terminal 332a and b) selects which of information object 356a, 356b or 356c to send. For example: the key sequence *331 could be used to send information object 356a; the key sequence<br><br><br>
*332 could be used to send information object 356b; and the key sequence *333 could be used to send information object 356c. However, any key sequence can be used.<br>
It will be understood that, depending on the functionality of POTS telephone 344b and PSTN switch 328b, then any type of user input that instruct the delivery of an information object 356 to data tenninal 332a can be used. For example, where PSTN switch 328b is operable to receive voice instructions, then the subscriber at POTS telephone 344b can issue voice instructions to instruct the delivery of an information object 356.<br>
For purposes of explaining the present embodiment, it will be assumed that the subscriber at POTS telephone 344b enters the key sequence *332, and thus instructs that information object 356b be sent to data tenninal 332a. Next, PSTN switch 328b uses this instruction to prepare an email message, using the email address of data terminal 332a previously extracted from the Caller ID stream from POTS telephone 344c. The prepared email message has information object 356b either embedded therein or attached thereto.<br>
Having prepared the email message, it is sent via network 324 to email server 328a, where it then becomes available for retrieval by the email client executing on data terminal 332a.<br>
At this point, PSTN switch 328b can automatically reactivate the earpiece of POTS telephone 344c and reestablish the complete voice connection between POTS telephones 344c and 344b. Alternatively, PSTN switch 328b can wait for more user-input (e.g. further depression of the 'flash* key) from the subscriber at POTS telephone 344b prior to reestablishing the complete voice connection.<br>
It will be understood that the various components in system 320 can be varied, modified, or substituted as desired and still achieve the same function. Furthermore, while system 320 only shows one data terminal 332a associated with POTS telephone 344c, it will be understood that a second data terminal 332 can be added to system 320 and associated with POTS telephone 344b. Similarly, a plurality of information objects can be associated with POTS telephone 344c, and an email address can be embedded into the outgoing Caller ID stream associated with POTS telephone 344b.<br>
While the embodiments discussed herein are directed to specific implementations of the invention, it will be understood that combinations, sub-sets and variations of the embodiments are within the scope of the invention. For example, it may be desired to add various security features to<br><br><br><br>
system 20 to ensure that the information object 56 of one subscriber node 32 is not inadvertently or unintentionally transferred to order subscriber nodes 32.<br>
It may desired to simply embed the entire caller's information object 56 into the caller-id stream sent to the callee subscriber node 32 during the initiation of the voice telephone call, thus eliminating the need for the explicit request for electronic information exchange at step 110. However, it is expected that privacy features, such as the ability to block the transmission of the information object 56 during me initiation of the call, may also be incorporated into such as a system.<br>
It may be desired to add certain other privacy/security features to the transmission of the electronic information. For example, the electronic information object may be encrypted during transmission, using any known encryption techniques, hi addition, the electronic information may be transmitted along with a digital signature, which can be used to verify the source of the electronic information by the recipient.<br>
The present invention may be used to allow subscribers to create and update their own personal phone directory. Such a phone book may be stored on a data tenninal located at either the network node or on a data terminal local to the subscriber's voice terminal. An application associated with the phone book could be used to allow the subscriber to automatically place telephone calls, without having to remember any phone numbers. Using any known text-to-speech converter, the phone book can be "read" to the subscriber using a voice terminal, allowing the subscriber to select a number to be dialed using an interactive voice response (TVR) menu system. Using such a text-to-speech converter system, it will be apparent that the foregoing variation envisions an implementation of the present invention that obviates the need for a data terminal local to the subscriber's voice terminal Alternatively, a data terminal associated with the subscriber's voice tenninal could present a graphical user interface that allowed the subscriber to select a number to be dialed.<br>
It may be desired to modify the present invention by allowing a caller to leave his information object 56 as part of or in addition to, a voicemail message left for the callee. Software executing on the data terminal of the callee subscriber station can be used to record all incoming calls, and the associated incoming electronic information associated therewith.<br>
The present invention can be modified for use on TDD or TDY devices used, by hearing<br><br><br>
impaired subscribers.<br>
It is contemplated that the present invention can be modified for use during a n-way conference calls, to allow multiple subscribers to exchange electronic information.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, (he various components in system 20 can be modified or varied to accomplish the same functionality. For instance, the electronic information object need not reside at the service provider node 28, but can reside, for example, at the subscriber node 32.<br>
The present invention provides a novel, system, method and apparatus for exchanging electronic information. The present invention simplifies the process of exchanging information such as email address, facsimile numbers and web-page addresses during a voice telephone call, thus allowing subscribers to accurately and readily exchange such information without the need for transcribing, in writing or otherwise, each other's electronic information.<br>
