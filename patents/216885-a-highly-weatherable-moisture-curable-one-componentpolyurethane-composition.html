				<td>HIGHLY WEATHERABLE MOISTURE-CURABLE ONE-COMPONENT<br>
POLYURETHANE COMPOSITIONS<br>
Background of the invention<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to highly weatherable, moisture-curable,<br>
one-component polyurethane compositions which are suitably used as sealants,<br>
inner and outer use adhesives, and waterproofing materials for roofs and wall<br>
surfaces.<br>
2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
Conventionally, moisture-curable, one-component polyurethane<br>
compositions have mainly been used as selants, inner and outer use adhesives,<br>
and waterproofing materials for roofs and wall surfaces. These have, however,<br>
not been free from the problems, such as early surface deterioration and crack<br>
formation in cured products, when used under exposition to the outdoor<br>
environment.<br>
With such backgrounds, the conventional moisture-curable, one-<br>
component polyurethane compositions have been prepared by addition of an<br>
antioxidant to retard the surface deterioration.<br>
Further, a polyester having an excellent weatherability have been used<br>
as the prepolymer to be blended into the moisture-curable, one-component<br>
polyurethane composition, in place of the ordinary prepolymers.<br>
Furthermore, in place of these moisture-curable, one-component<br>
compositions have in part been used, which cause less surface deterioration at<br>
the early stage of exterior exposition.<br>
However, merely adding an antioxidant to the moisture-curable, one-<br>
component poiyurethane compositions as mentioned above could not improve<br>
the weatherability well, so that a recipe for further improvement is desired.<br>
Although use of a polyester as the prepolymer performs a sufficient<br>
improvement in the weatherability, economical problems are unavoidable,<br>
because of the polyester prepolymers are more expensive than those<br>
conventional prepolymers.<br>
Also, the moisture-curable, modified silicone one-component<br>
compositions have such problems as that the adhesive strength is lower, as<br>
compared with the moisture-curable, one-component polyurethane<br>
compositions, and that the degree of surface deterioration turns more significant<br>
than those in moisture-curable, one-component polyurethane compositions,<br>
when exposed to outdoor conditions for a fairly long period of time.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In view of the above situations, an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide moisture-curable, one-component polyurethane compositions having a<br>
high weatherability, with a suppressed cost increase.<br>
After exhaustive investigations to solve the problems as mentioned<br>
above, the inventors have accomplished the present invention. Thus, moisture-<br>
curable, one-component polyurethane compositions according to the present<br>
invention are one-component (i.e. one-component or single liquid) compositions<br>
curable with moisture in the air, and contain a main component which will form a<br>
polyurethane resin upon curing, and additives, wherein said additives comprise<br>
one or more photocurable materials selected from the group consisting of<br>
unsaturated acrylic compounds, polyvinyl cinnamate and azide-containing<br>
compounds, and a hindered amine photostabilizer.<br>
The additives as mentioned above may preferably contain additionally a<br>
blocked amine compound which will form a primary or secondary amine group<br>
with moisture.<br>
Further, the additives as above may preferably further contain a<br>
thixotropy endowing agent comprising an inorganic filler treated with an organic<br>
material selected from the group consisting of fatty acids, metal salts of fatty<br>
acids, fatty acid esters, resinic acids, surface active agents and polyacrylates.<br>
Furthermore, the above additives may preferably contain a thixotropy<br>
endowing agent comprising a polyurea compound represented by the formula:<br>
R1(NHCON-R2, -R3)m<br>
wherein R1 is a residue originated from polyisocyanate; R2 and R3 are<br>
residues each originated from a monoamine, and one of these residues may be<br>
a hydrogen atom; and m is an integer of 2 to 4.<br>
Preferably, the thixotropy endowing agent comprising a polyurea<br>
compound may be added to the present composition in the form of a compound<br>
may be added to the present composition in the form of a paste formed by<br>
dispersing the agent in a phthaiate ester compound.<br>
The present moisture-curable, one-component poiyurethane<br>
compositions are highly weatherable, and can be provided with lower costs than<br>
those using a polyester prepolymer or moisture-curable, modified silicone one-<br>
component compositions.<br>
Moreover, the storage stability and thixotropy of the present<br>
compositions are much improved by blending a thixotropy endowing agent<br>
comprising an above polyurea compound to the additives.<br>
Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention will more fully be described hereinafter. The<br>
moisture-curable, one-part, polyurethane compositions according to the<br>
invention are curable with moisture in the air. Thus they can be used, for<br>
example, for filling up crevices between material parts. Particularly, they are<br>
suitably used as sealants, inner and outer use adhesives, waterproofing material<br>
for roofs and wall surfaces, and other usages in the exterior exposition situation.<br>
The present moisture-curable, one-component poiyurethane<br>
compositions are prepared by blending a main component, which will form a<br>
poiyurethane resin upon curing, with additives.<br>
The main component, which will form a poiyurethane resin upon curing<br>
are not particularly limitative, and may be any of those already known. For<br>
example, a prepoiymer having polypropylene oxide as the principal chain<br>
skeleton and isocyanate group at the terminals is suitably used.<br>
As for the isocyanate in such a prepolymer, there may be mentioned, for<br>
example, toluene 2,4-diisocyanate, toluene 2,6-dilsocyanate, phenylene<br>
diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate,<br>
polyphenylmethane polyisocyanate (Polymeric MD1), naphtylene, 1,5-<br>
diisocyanate, triphenylmethane triisocyanate, and diphenyl sulfone diisocyanate;<br>
and those hydrogenated compounds, such as 1-methyl-2,4-<br>
diisocyanateocyclohexane, 1-methyl-2,6diisocyanatocyclohexane, and<br>
dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate; ethylene diisocyanate, propylene<br>
diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate; propylene diisocyanate,<br>
tetramethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and isophorone<br>
diisocyanate; and a dimer (urethodione diisocyanate) and trimer (isocyanurate<br>
triisocyanate) of these diisocyanates.<br>
As for the additives used in the present invention, one ore more<br>
photocurable materials selected from the group consisting of unsaturated acrylic<br>
compounds, polyvinyl cinnamate and azide-containing compounds, are used,<br>
together with a hindered amine photostabilizer.<br>
Photocurable material readily suffers from a chemical change in its<br>
molecular structure by rays of light within a fairly short period of time, with a<br>
physical change such as curing. Such compounds include organic monomers,<br>
oligomers, resins, and other compositions containing them. Typically, they are<br>
unsaturated acrylic compounds, polyvinyl cinnamate and azide-containing<br>
compounds, as mentioned above.<br>
Suitable unsaturated acrylic compounds include acrylic and methacrylic<br>
monomers having one or more unsaturated groups, their oligomers, and<br>
mixtures thereof. There are illustrated propylene (or butylene or ethylene) glycol<br>
di(meth)acrylate, neopentyl glycol di(meth)acrylate, tetramethylene<br>
dimethacrylate, as monomers and oligomers having not higher than 10,000 of<br>
molecular weight.<br>
Polyvinyl cinnamate is a photosensitive resin having cinnamoyl group as<br>
the photosensitive group, and includes that prepared by esterlfying polyvinyl<br>
alcohol with cinnamic acid, and many other polyvinyl cinnamate derivatives.<br>
Azide-containing compounds have been known as photosensitive resins<br>
having azide group as the photosensitive group. Photosensitive rubber liquid<br>
containing a diazide compound as photosensitizer, as well as those illustrated in<br>
,,KANKOSEI JUSHI" (Photosensitive Resins), published on March 17, 1972, by<br>
JNSATSU GAKKAI" (Printing Academy), pages 93-, 106-, and 117-, may be<br>
used singly or as a mixture thereof. if desired, an additional sensitizer may be<br>
added.<br>
Such a photocurable material suffers from a chemical change in the<br>
molecular structure by rays of light within a fairly short period of time, with a<br>
physical change such a curing.<br>
Thus, it forms a film at the surface of the cured composition, and<br>
controls the effect of rays of light on polyurethane in the cured composition,<br>
thereby restraining the deterioration of polyurethane and the formation of cracks.<br>
Blending ratio of the photocurable material per the amount of the main<br>
component as mentioned above (for example, a prepolymer having isocyanate<br>
group at the terminals) is preferably 0.5 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by<br>
weight of the main component. An amount less thanO.5 part by weight causes<br>
insufficient photocurability in the resulting composition, which tends to provide<br>
lower weatherability. A blending amount exceeding 50 parts by weight does not<br>
improve the weatherability, when compared to that having 50 parts by weight<br>
blended, accordingly such an amount is uneconimical.<br>
As for the photocurable materials selected from the group consisting of<br>
unsaturated acrylic compounds, polyvinyl cinnamate and azide-containing<br>
compounds, any of those commercially available may be suitably used.<br>
Among them, unsaturated acrylic compounds are particularly preferred,<br>
because of effective improvement in the weatherability and the advantageous<br>
cost of production.<br>
Hindered amine photostabilizer includes UV absorbers, which absorbs<br>
photoenergy such as from sun beams and fluorescent lamp to convert to<br>
harmless heat energy, and quenchers which extinct the active center excited by<br>
photoenergy. As for resins which readily deteriorates by light, heat stabilizer and<br>
antioxidant may combinedly used along with the photostabilizer, thereby their<br>
light resistance and weatherability being significantly improved.<br>
Most of such hindered amine photostabilizers are commercially<br>
available, and include, for example, ADEKASTAB LA-52, LA-57, LA-62, LA-67,<br>
LA-63, LA-68, LA-77, LA-82 and, LA-87 (manufactured by ASAHI DENKA<br>
KOGYO K.K.); bis (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, bis (1,2,2,6,6-<br>
pentamethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, 1 -[2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-<br>
propionyloxy)ethyl]-4-[3-(3,5-di-tert-buty-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionyloxy]-2,2,6,6-<br>
tetramethylpiperidyl succinate, dimethyl- 1 -(2-hydroxyethyl)-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-<br>
tetramethylpiperidine polycondensate, poly[[6-1(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbuty)imino-<br>
1,3,5-triazin-2,4-diyl][(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperdyl)imino] hexamethylene<br>
[(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperclyl)imino]], bis(12,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidyl) 2-<br>
(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-2-n-butyl malonate and the like.<br>
Hindered amine photostabilizer absorbs UV photoenergy, for example,<br>
from sun beams and fluorescent lamp, to convert to harmless heat energy.<br>
Thus, it controls UV absorption of polyurethane in the cured composition,<br>
thereby restraining the UV deterioration of polyurethane and formation of cracks.<br>
Blending amount of the hindered amine photostabilizer per the amount<br>
of the main component as mentioned above (for example, a prepolymer having<br>
isocyanate group at the terminals) is preferably 0.01 to 10 parts by weight per<br>
100 parts by weight of the main component. An amount less than 0.01 part by<br>
weight causes insufficient photostability in the resulting composition, which<br>
causes lower weatherability. A blending amount exceeding 10 parts by weight<br>
does not improve the weatherability, when compared with that having 10 parts<br>
by weight blended, accordingly such an amount is uneconomical.<br>
Besides these photocurable materials and hindered amine<br>
photostabilizers, a blocked amine compound may be blended to the present<br>
additives, if desired.<br>
Blocked amine compounds employed are those forming primary or<br>
secondary amino group with moisture, without substantial reaction with the<br>
isocyanate group (they may merely be referred to as "blocked amine<br>
compounds", hereinafter). Such blocked amine compounds include aldimines,<br>
ketimines, enamines, oxazolidines, and other condensates of an aldehyde ore<br>
ketone with a compound having at least one primary or secondary amino group<br>
and also having an active hydrogen, such as primary or secondary amino and<br>
hydroxyl groups (hereinafter, referred to as "active hydrogen compound").<br>
Furthermore, compounds having two or more oxazolidine groups in the<br>
molecule, prepared by a reaction of N-hydroxyoxazolidine with an organic<br>
polyisocyanate, are included.<br>
Typical active hydrogen compounds include those having a primary<br>
amino group and hydroxyl group, those having a secondary amino group and<br>
and hydroxyl group, those having a primary amino group, a secondary amino<br>
group and hydroxyl group, those having to primary amino groups, those having<br>
two secondary amino group, and those having a secondary amino group and<br>
two hydroxyl group.<br>

methyl-1,6-hexanediamine, diethylenetriamine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylene-<br>
diamine, 3-aminoethylpiperazine, N-2(2-hydoxyethyl)piperazine, polyamides<br>
obtained from fatty acids (for example, dimer acid and tall oil acid) and<br>
anhydrous piperazine, 1-amino-3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyicyclohexane, N-<br>
(methylaminoethyl)-piperazine, aniline, toluidine, xylidine, isophoronediamine,<br>
diaminocyclohexane, diaminodiphenylmethane, xylylenediamine, diamino-<br>
benzene, norbomanedimethylamine (2,5(2,6)-bis(aminomethyl)-bicyclo[2,2,1]-<br>
heptane), diaminomethylbicycloheptane, ethanolamine, diethanoiamine, di-<br>
propanolamine, hexanolamine, Jeffamine D-230, D-400,D-2000 and T-403<br>
(manufactured by Jefferson Chemical, U.S.), ethylenediamine, 1,3-diamino-<br>
propane, tetramethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, heptamethylene-<br>
diamine, octamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, 4,4"-diaminodicyclo-<br>
hexylmethane, bisaminomethylcyclohexane, 2,5- or 2,6-diaminomethyl-<br>
bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane, 3(4),8(9)-bis(aminomethyl)-tricyclo[5,2,1,0,2,6]decane, di-<br>
aminodiphenylmethane, diaminodiphenyl ether, phenylenediamine, 3,5-<br>
diethyltoluene-2,4- or -2,6-diamine, polyoxyalkylenediamine (obtained by<br>
addition polymerization of propylene oxide and/or ethylene oxide with water,<br>
ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, etc. and conversion of the hydroxyl groups in<br>
the resulting polyoxyalkylene glycol to amino groups), triamines, such as 1,3,5-<br>
tris(aminomethyl)benzene and 1,3,5-tris(aminomethyl)cyclohexane, and poly-<br>
oxyalkylenetriamine (obtained by addition polymerization of propylene oxide<br>
and/or ethylene oxide with glycerol, trimethylolpropane, etc. and conversion of<br>
the hydroxyl groups in the resulting polyoxyalkylenetriol to amino groups).<br>
Aldehydes and ketones to be condensated with the active hydrogen<br>
compounds include, for example, acetaldehyde, propionic aldehyde, butylic<br>
aldehyde, isobutylic aldehyde, trlmethylacetaldehyde, triethylacetaldehyde,<br>
valeric aldehyde, allulolein, crotonic aldehyde, furfural, benzaldehyde, o-<br>
tolualdehyde, m-tolualdehyde, p-tolualdehyde, 4-ethylbenzaldehyde, 4-<br>
propylbenzaldehyde, 4-butylbenzaldehyde, 2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 2,4,6-<br>
trimethylbenzahldehyde, p-anisic aldehyde, p-ethoxybenzaldehyde, acetone,<br>
methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diethyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone,<br>
methylhepatone, cyclohexanone, trimethylcyclohexanone, isophorone,<br>
acetophenone, and the like. Reaction of the active hydrogen compound with an<br>
aldehyde or ketone may be conducted under the well known conditions.<br>
For example, polyaldimine, a kind of the aldimines as mentioned above,<br>
is prepared as follows: a polyamine and an aldehyde are heated together in a<br>
solvent, such as toluene and xylene, in the presence of an acidic catalyst for an<br>
azeotropic dehydration reaction. The reaction is continued until the distillation of<br>
water into a water separator finishes to obtain a polyaldimine. As for the ratio of<br>
polyamine and aldehyde, 1 to 2 equivalent amount of the aldehyde based on 1<br>
equivalent amount of the amine is appropriate. The reaction is generally over<br>
after several hours. After the reaction, the aldehyde and solvent are evaporated<br>
in vacuo from the reaction mixture to leave a polyaldimine.<br>
Such a blocked amine compound forms a primary or secondary amino<br>
group in the presence of moisture. Accordingly, it restrains a direct reaction of<br>
the main component isocyanate with moisture, and the primary or secondary<br>
amino group originated from the blocked amine group readily reacts with the<br>
main component isocyanate, serving for curing of the composition. Since the<br>
curing reaction with the amino group generates no gas, such as carbon dioxide,<br>
the resulting cured products are free from blistering and peeling. Furthermore,<br>
the blocked amine compound reacts with the photocurable material as<br>
mentioned above, to form a film, thus, the weatherable effect of the<br>
photocurable material and accordingly the same effect in the cured product<br>
being enhanced.<br>
Preferable blending amount of the blocked amine compound is 0.1 to<br>
2.0 as the number ratio of the amino group in the hydrolyzed polyamine to the<br>
isocyanate group in polyisocyanate and/or polyurethane prepolymer having the<br>
isocyanate group. A blending ratio of less than 0.1 gives insufficient effect of the<br>
blocked amine compound on the improvement in curability and weatherability. A<br>
ratio exceeding 2.0 provides the formation of excessive amino groups, thus, the<br>
resulting cured composition being softened with a decreased water resistivity.<br>
Additives according to the present invention may desirably further<br>
contain a thixotropy endowing agent. As for the agent, an inorganic filler treated<br>
with an organic material, as well as a polyurea compound, may be suitably used.<br>
These members can be used singly or combinedly.<br>
Thixotropy endowing agent comprising an inorganic filler treated with an<br>
organic material, includes calcium carbonate treated a fatty acid, such as lauric,<br>
stearic, palmitic, oleic and linolic acids; calcium carbonate treated with a metal<br>
salt of a fatty acid, such as calcium palmitate, calcium stearate and sodium<br>
stearate; calcium carbonate treated with a fatty acid ester, such as stearyl<br>
stearate, lauryl stearate, methyl stearate, butyl stearate, stearyl palmitate, lauryl<br>

treated with a surface active agent, such as alkyl benzenesulfonates; calcium<br>
carbonate treated with a polyacrylate; and talc and bentonite treated with an<br>
organic material in similar way as above.<br>
Various thixotropy endowing agent comprising an inorganic filler treated<br>
with an organic material are commercially available. For example, MC Coat S, M<br>

GERUTON 50, SL-101, HAKUENKA Series and HOMOKARU Series from<br>
SHIRAISHI K.K., are available.<br>
Thixotropy endowing agent comprising a polyurea compound is a<br>
compound having multiple urea linkages in the molecule and is obtained by a<br>
reaction of polyisocyanate with a monoamine. Thus, the polyurea compound is<br>
represented by the formula:<br>
R1(NHCON-R2, -R3)m<br>
Wherein R1 is a residue originated from polyisocyanate, R2 and R3 are residues<br>
each originated from a monoamine, and one of these residues may be a<br>
hydrogen atom; and m is an integer of 2 to 4; and obtained by a reaction of<br>
polyisocyanate [R1(NCO)m] with a monoamine [R2R3NH], wherein R1, R2, R3 and<br>
m have the same meanings as above.<br>
The polyisocyanate is not limitative and may be any of known aliphatic,<br>
aromatic and alicyclic polyisocyanates. Specifically, it includes straight chain or<br>
branched aliphatic polyisocyanates having 2 to 8 carbon atoms; benzene or<br>

may be linked to the aromatic ring directly or via any crosslinking group (for<br>
example, an alkylene group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms)]; and alicyclic<br>
polyisocyanates of 3 to 6 carbon atoms [the alicyclic group may be substituted<br>
with methyl or other group, and the isocyanate group may be linked to the<br>
cycloalkyl ring directly or via any crosslinking group (for example, an alkylene<br>
group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms)].<br>

diisocyanate; a dimer (urethodione diisocyanate) and trimer (isocyanurate<br>
triisocyanate) of these diisocyanates, and the like. These polyisocyanate<br>
compounds may be used singly or combinedly.<br>
Among these polyisocyanates, an arylalkylaryl diisocyanate, such as<br>
diphenylmethane diisocyanate, is particularly preferred from the view point of<br>
thixotropy, production efficiency and costs.<br>
The monoamine is not limitative and may be any of primary and<br>
secondary amines. R2 and R3 are, respectively, hydrogen atom or a group of<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons or aromatic hydrocarbons which<br>
may be substituted, provided that R2 and R3 are never hydrogen atom<br>
simultaneously.<br>
Specifically, R2 and R3 may be respectively, a hydrogen atom: a straight<br>
chain or branched, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group of 1 to<br>
8 carbon atoms; an alicycllc group of 3 to 6 carbon atoms which may be<br>
substituted with an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms; a benzene of naphtha-<br>
lene ring which may be substituted with a halogen atom or with an alkyl group of<br>
1 to 4 carbon atoms; and aryl-substituted alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms;<br>

More specifically, they may be, respectively an aliphatic primary amine,<br>
such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, butylamine,<br>
amylamine, and hexylamine; an aliphatic secondary armine, such as<br>
dimethylamine, diethylamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, and<br>
dibutylamine; an aliphatic unsaturated amine, such as allylamine and<br>
diallylamine; an aiicyclic amine, such as cyclopropylamine, cyclobutylamine,<br>
cyclopentylamine, and cyclohexylamine, and an aromatic amine, such as<br>
aniline, diphenylamine, methylaniline, ethylaniline, toludine, xylidine,<br>
benzylamine, naphthylamine, and the like. The monoamine used in the present<br>
invention is preferably a monoalkylamine, more preferably a straight chain<br>
alkylamine, among which n-butylamine is the most preferable, from the view<br>
points of thixotropy, production efficiency and costs.<br>
Reaction conditions for the polyisocyanate and monoamine are not<br>
limitative. For example, the polyisocyanate and monoamine are subjected to a<br>
reaction under conventional conditions, by dissolving or dispersing in an ester<br>
plasticizer, which is inert to isocyanate, in a ratio of 1.0 to 1.1 (isocyanate group<br>
/ amino or imino group), thereby to obtain a polyurea compound having multiple<br>
urea likages in the molecule, i.e. thixotropy endowing agent according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
The ester plasticizer includes, for example, phthalate esters, adipate<br>
esters, azelainate esters, sebacate esters, sulfonate ester, trimellitate esters,<br>
phosphate esters, fumarate esters, maleate esters, and the like.<br>
Specifically the phthalate esters include diisodecyl phthalate, dioctyl<br>
phthalate, 2-ethylhexyl phthalate, diisononyl phtalate, dibutyl phthalate, butyl<br>
benzyl phthalate, diheptyl phthalate, bis(9\10"-expoxyoctadecyl) 4,5-<br>
epoxyhexahydrophthalate, and the like. The adipate esters include dioctyl<br>
adipate, 2-ethylhexyl adipate, diisononyl adipate, diisodecyl adipate, and the<br>
like. The azelainate esters include di(2-ethylhexyt) azelainate, and the like. The<br>
sebacate esters include di(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate, and the like. The sulfonate<br>
esters include phenyl alkylsulfonates and the like. The trimellitate esters include<br>
tri(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate and the like. The phosphate esters include triphenyl<br>
phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, trixylenyl phosphate, cresyl diphenyl phosphate,<br>
xylenyl diphenyl phosphate, tris(chloroethyl) phosphate, tris(dichloropropyl)<br>
phosphate, tris(ß-chloropropyl) phosphate, tris(tribromophenyl) phosphate,<br>
tris(dibromophenyl) phosphate, tris(tribromoneopentyl) phosphate, and the like.<br>
The fumarate esters include butyl fumarate, bis(2-methylpropyl) fumarate,<br>
diisobutyl fumarate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) fumarate, and the like. The maleate esters<br>
include dimethyl maleate, diethyl maleate, and the like.<br>
While, the thixotropy endowing agent dispersed in such a plasticizer<br>
constitutes a dispersion paste of the thixotropy endowing agent of the present<br>
invention, as mentioned below.<br>
Since the thixotropy endowing agent comprising such a polyurea<br>
compound is free from water and silanol group, and inert to the polymer<br>
component, such problems as viscosity increase in the composition during the<br>
production or storage step are avoided. Thus, the composition containing such a<br>
polyurea compound has an excellent storage stability, and performs a sufficient<br>
thixotropy at the working execution.<br>
Blending amount of the thixotropy endowing agent per the amount of the<br>
main component (for example, a prepolymer having an isocyanate group at the<br>
terminals) varies depending on the cases where a thixotropy endowing agent<br>
comprising an inorganic filler treated with an organic material and that<br>
comprising a polyurea compound are used combinedly or singly. In a case of<br>
using merely a thixotropy endowing agent comprising an inorganic filler treated<br>
with an organic material, an amount of 50 to 300 parts by weight is preferable,<br>
based on 100 parts by weight of the main component. An amount less that 50<br>
parts by weight gives insufficient thixotropy in the resulting composition, with<br>
unsatisfactory coating and filling workabilities. An amount exceeding 300 parts<br>
by weight causes inferior storage stability, with unsatisfactory coating and filling<br>
workabilities.<br>
In a case of using a thixotropy endowing agent comprising a polyurea<br>
compound, an amount of 10 to 200 parts by weight is preferable, based on 100<br>
parts by weight of the main component. An amount less than 10 parts by weight<br>
gives insufficient thixotropy in the resulting composition, with unsatisfactory<br>
coating and filling workabilities, similarly as in the above inorganic filler. An<br>
amount exceeding 200 parts by weight causes inferior coating and filling<br>
workabilities.<br>
Besides the additives as mentioned above, the highly weatherable,<br>
moisture-curable, one-component polyurethane composition according to the<br>
present invention may contain other additives, fillers, plasticizers, solvents, and<br>
other conventionally used components, so far as they are consistent with the<br>
objectives of the invention.<br>
The fillers mentioned above include calcium carbonate, titanium oxide,<br>
clay, talc, zinc oxide, glass balloon, carbon black, polyamide, PVC, and the like.<br>
The plasticizer includes, for example, phthalate esters, adipate esters,<br>
azelainate esters, sebacate esters, sulfonate esters, trimellitate esters,<br>
phosphate esters, fumurate esters, maleate esters, and the like.<br>
Specifically, the phthalate esters include diisodecyl phthalate, dioctyl<br>
phthalate, 2-ethylhexyl phthalate, diisononyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate,<br>
butylbenzyl phthalate, diheptyl phthalate, bis(9",10"-epoxyoctadecyl) 4,5-<br>
epoxyhexahydrophthalate, and the like. The adipate esters include dioctyl<br>
adipate, 2-ethylhexyl adipate, diisononyl adipate, diisodecyl adipate, and the<br>
like. The azelainate esters include di(2-ethylhexyl) azelainate, and the like. The<br>
sebacate esters include di(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate, and the like. The sulfonate<br>
esters include phenyl alkylsulfonates and the like. The trimellitate estes include<br>
tri(2-ethylhexyl)trimellitate and the like. The phosphate esters include triphenyl<br>
phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, trixylenyl phosphate, cresyl diphenyl phosphate,<br>
xylenyl diphenyl phosphate, tris(chloroethyl) phosphate, tris(dichloropropyl)<br>
phosphate, tris(ß-chloropropyl) phosphate, tris(tribromophenyl) phosphate,<br>
tris(dibromophenyl) phosphate, tris(tribromopentyl) phosphate, and the like. The<br>
fumarate esters include butyl fumarate, bis(2-methylpropyl) fumarate, diisobutyl<br>
fumarate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) fumarate and the like. The maleate esters include<br>
dimethyl maleate, diethyl maleate, and the like.<br>
Besides these additives as mentioned above, there may be blended a<br>
curing catalyst, such as organic tin catalysts, amine catalysts and organic and<br>
acid catalysts (for example, methylhexahydromaleic adld anhydride [Trade<br>
name: Hardener HY 1102 BD (manufactured by Ciba-Geigy AG], or [Trade<br>
name: RIKACID MH700 (manufactured by SHIN NIPPON RIKA K.K.)]<br>
pyromellitic adid, barbituric acid, etc.) adhesiveness agent [for example, 3-<br>
glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane/burette-<br>
type HDI adduct, polyisocyanate [Trade name: SUMIDUR E21-1, E21-2, L75,<br>
N75, and N3300, DESMODUR RFE, DESMOSEAL M100 (manufactured by<br>
Sumitomo-Bayer Urethane K.K.], [Trade name: BESTANET T-1890 L<br>
(manufactured by DEGUSSA HUELLS K.K.) etc.], antioxidants, UV absorbers,<br>
organic pigments, and the like.<br>
Highly weatherable, moisture-curable, one-component polyurethane<br>
compositions of the present invention are prepared according to any<br>
conventional method, for example, under the environment wherein moisture is<br>
eliminated as far as possible, for example, under a diminished pressure.<br>
Specifically, a polymer component of the invention (the main component<br>
forming a polyurea resin upon curing) is mixed with a photocurable material and<br>
a hindered amine photostabilizer and, if desired, with a blocked amine<br>
compound and thixotropy endowing agent, in a batch-type double axes<br>
kneading mixer. If necessary, the mixture is then blended with a filler, plasticizer<br>
and other additives than the above, and further kneaded and defoamed, thereby<br>
to obtain the objective composition.<br>
The photocurable material additive in the present moisture-curable, one-<br>
component polyurethane composition forms a film at the surface of the cured<br>
product. The hindered amine photostabilizer additive in the present composition<br>
absorbs UV, thus serving for the high weatherability in the cured product. Also,<br>
use of the ordinary prepolymer in the main component allows lower production<br>
costs as compared with those using a polyester prepolymer and the moisture-<br>
curable, modified silicone one-component compositions.<br>
The blocked amine compound additive gives a sufficient curability to the<br>
composition, and excludes such problems as blistering and peeling in the cured<br>
product. Furthermore, the blocked amine compound reacts with the<br>
photocurable material to form a film. Thus, the weatherable effect of the<br>
photocurable material is enhanced, so that the weatherability of the cured<br>
composition is more improved.<br>
The thixotropy endowing agent comprising the polyurea compound<br>
effectively gives excellent storage stability and thixotropy in the resulting cured<br>
composition. Thus, the agent serves for the storage stability, as well as coating<br>
and filling workabilities, of the composition, when used as sealants, inner and<br>
outer use adhesives, and waterproofing materials for roofs and wall surfaces.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will more fully be described in reference to the<br>
working examples, as well as the comparative examples for comparison. "Part"<br>
in the examples means part by weight, unless otherwise identified.<br>
"Synthesis of thixotropy endowing agent dispersed paste (A)"<br>
An isocyanate solution made by dissolving 80 parts of diphenylmethane<br>
diisocyanate in 235 parts of diisodecyl phthalate, and an amine solution made<br>
by dissolving 40 parts of n-butylamine in 275 parts of diisodecyl phthalate, were<br>
introduced into a reaction vessel through each separated quantitative pump in<br>
each equivalent amount. The mixture was stirred by means of a static mixer for<br>
the reaction, thereby a dispersed paste of a thixotropy endowing agent having<br>
multiple urea linkages in the molecule, i.e. thixotropy endowing agent dispersed<br>
paste (A) of the invention, being obtained.<br>
"Preparation of the highly weatherable, moisture-curable, one-<br>

polyurethane composition.<br>

thereby to obtain a highly weatherable, moisture-curable, one-component<br>
polyurethane composition.<br>

the thixotropy endowing agent dispersed paste (A), 270 parts of CALFAMIN 500<br>

(DBTDL), 0.6 part of methylhexahydrophthalic acid anhydride (Trade name:<br>
Hardner HY 1102 BD) [manufactured by Ciba-Geigy AG] or RIKACID MH 700<br>
[SHIN NIPPON RIKA K.K.]) was added, to obtain a highly weatherable,<br>
moisture-curable, one-component polyurethane composition.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Similar procedure as in Example 2 was repeated, except that addition of<br>
the TMPMA (trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate) or ARONIX M-8060<br>
(manufactured by TOA GOSEI KAGAKU KOGYO K.K.) which was a<br>
photocurable material comprising an unsaturated acrylic compound was omitted,<br>
to obtain a moisture-curable, one-component polyurethane composition.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
Similar procedure as in Example 2 was repeated, except that addition of<br>

(manufactured by ASAHI DENKA K.K.) was omitted, to obtain a moisture-<br>

the TMPMA (trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate) or ARONIX M-8060<br>
(manufactured by TOA GOSEI KAGAKU KOGYO K.K.) which was a<br>
photocurable material comprising an unsaturated acrylic compound, and the<br>
hindered amine photostabilizer comprising ADEKASTAB LA-62 (manufactured<br>
by ASAHI DENKA K.K.) was omitted, to obtain a moisture-curable, one-<br>
component polyurethane composition.<br>
The compositions obtainded in Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative<br>
Examples 1 to 3 were evaluated as follows. Results from Examples 1 to 3 and<br>
from Comparative Examples 1 to 3 are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.<br>
(1)Extrudability<br>
Extrudabllities were estimated according to JIS-A-5758-1992 "Sealants<br>
for Architectural Use", "4.2 Extrudability".<br>
Thus, each sample composition just after the preparation was filled in a<br>
cartridge made of a high density polyethylene, without inclusion of foams, and<br>
the cartridge is readily loaded on an air gun. Each sample composition was<br>
extruded from the end of air gun having no nozzle with a pressure of 98.0 kPa at<br>
a temperature of 20°C, and the period of time until the whole of the sample<br>
composition was extruded out of the cartridge was measured. In this test, a<br>
shorter period of time for extrusion shows better extrudability of the composition.<br>
(2) Storage stability<br>
Each test composition was filled in a cartridge as used in the above<br>
"extrudability test", and the closed cartridge was stood at a temperature of 20°C<br>
under a condition of 55% to 65% relative humidity for one month. Thereafter, the<br>
period of time for extrusion of the whole amount of the testing composition out of<br>
the cartridge was measured in similar way as in the above "extrudability" test,<br>
thereby to estimate the storage ability. In this test, a shorter period of time for<br>
extrusion shows better storage stability of the composition.<br>
(3) Thixotropy (slumping test)<br>
Thixotropies were estimated according to JIS-A-5758-1992 "Sealants for<br>
Architectural Use", "4.3 Slumping Tests".<br>
Thus, three of channeled vessels for slumping tests (made of a<br>
corrosion resistive metal, about 1 mm thickness) were provided. Each testing<br>
composition was readily filled in each vessel, avoiding the formation of foams,<br>
and the surface of the testing composition was smoothed. Then, the testing<br>
composition was readily allowed to suspend perpendicularly for 6 hours in a<br>
50°C thermostat. Thereafter, the length from the bottom of the channels in the<br>
vessel to the end of point of the hanging down composition was measured (mm)<br>
for slump (vertical) value. The estimations were made both of just after and one<br>
month after the preperations.<br>
Lower the slump value of the testing composition, better the thixotropy.<br>
A slump value exceeding 2 mm may be said not to have enough thixtropy.<br>
(4) Weathering tests<br>
Weatherabilities were estimated according to JIS-A-1415-1977<br>
"Accelerated weathering test method for plastic architectural materials".<br>
Thus, each sample composition was cured to form a sheet of about 3<br>
mm thickness, which was then subjected to a weathering test using a sunshine<br>
weather meter (manufactured by SUGA SHIKENKI K.K.) for estimation of the<br>
surface weatherability.<br>
As shown in Table 1, the cured product from the composition in Example<br>
1 shows cracks after a 1500 hour accelerated weathering test, but it is<br>
recognized that if s weatherability is still high enough, when compared with the<br>
results in Comparative Examples 1 to 3. The cured product from the composition<br>
in Example 2 wherein a blocked amine compound comprising ALDIMIN ALD-1 is<br>
added shows no crack after a 3000 hour accelerated weathering test, thus, a<br>
significantly high weatherability being identified.<br>
In the cured product from the composition in Example 3, wherein the<br>
thixotropy endowing agent used is an inorganic filler treated with an organic<br>
material, in place of the polyurea compound, cracks are observed after a 2000<br>
hour accerelated weathering test. This fact shows that the weatherability is<br>
inferior to that in Example 2 wherein the thixotropy endowing agent is a polyurea<br>
compound, even though the weatherability is still enough when compared with<br>
those in Comperative Examples 1 to 3. In other words, the thixotropy endowing<br>
agent comprising a polyurea compound gives more advantageous effect on<br>
weatherability than that comprising an inorganic filler treated with an organic<br>
material. Furthermore, the products in Examples 1 and 2 are identified to be<br>
excellent in the extrudability and slump value, thus, also in the thixotropy, as well<br>
as in the storage stability, while, the product from Example 3 is inferior in the<br>
storage stability to that in Examples 1 and 2. Accordingly, thixotropy endowing<br>
agent comprising polyurea compound gives advantageous effect on the storage<br>
stability when compared to that comprising an inorganic filler treated with an<br>
organic material.<br><br>
On the other side, products from Comparative Examples 1 to 3 form<br>
cracks during 1200 hours, thus, it is identified that they are inferior in the<br>
weatherability to those In Examples 1 to 3.<br>
As described herein before, the highly weatherabie, moisture-curable,<br>
one-component polyurethane compositions of the present invention contain a<br>
photocurable material and hindered amin photostabilizer as the additives. Thus,<br>
the film forming activity of the photocurable material at the surface of the cured<br>
product, and the UV absorbing effect of the hindered amine photostabilizer, serve<br>
for the high weatherability in the cured products. Besides, use of an ordinary<br>
prepolymer as the main component serves for the lower production cost, when<br>
compared with the case of using a polyester prepolymer and moisture-curable,<br>
modified silicone one-component compositions.<br>
Use of a blocked amine compound as the additives gives sufficient<br>
curability to the composition, and eliminates such problems as blistering and<br>
peeling in the cured product, without foaming. Since the blocked amine<br>
compound reacts with the photocurable material mentioned above to form a film,<br>
the compound enhances the weatherabie effect of the photocurable material,<br>
thus the weatherability of the cured product from the present composition being<br>
much increased.<br>
Use of a thixotropy endowing agent comprising a polyuera compound as<br>
the additives serves for effects on the storage stability and thixotropy, so that the<br>
resulting composition possesses an excellent storage stability and thixotropy.<br>
The present composition exhibits excellent storage stability, as well as<br>
the coating and filling workabilities, when used as sealants, inner and outer use<br>
adhesives, and waterproofing materials for roofs and wall surfaces. For example,<br>
when a sealant comprising the present composition is applied or filled on a<br>
vertical surface, the material steadily stays there and is cured at the sealing<br>
places without flowing down, thus, performing the excellent water-tight and air-<br>
tight effects. Moreover, when a sealant comprising the present composition is<br>
applied for sealing between material parts, it functions as a cushion material or<br>
buffer material for the expand and contract, vibration and deformation between<br>
the material parts.<br>
