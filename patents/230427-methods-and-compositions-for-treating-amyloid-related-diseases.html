Background<br>
Amyloidosis refers to a pathological condition characterized by the presence of amyloid fibrils. Amyloid is a generic tenn referring to a group of diverse but specific protein deposits (intracellular or extracellular) which are seen in a number of different diseases. Though diverse in their occurrence, all amyloid deposits have common morphologic properties, stain with specific dyes (e.g.^ Congo red), and have a characteristic red-green birefrngent appearance in polarized light after staining. They also share common ultrastructural features and conamon X-ray diffraction and infrared spectra.<br>
Amyloid-related diseases can either be restricted to one organ or spread to several organs. The first instance is referred to as "localized amyloidosis" while the second is referred to as "systemic amyloidosis."<br>
Some amyloid diseases can be idiopathic, but most of these diseases appear as a complication of a previously existing disorder. For example, primary amyloidosis (AL amyloid) can appear without any other pathology or can follow plasma cell dyscrasia or multiple myeloma.<br>
Secondary amyloidosis is usually seen associated with chronic infection (such as tuberculosis) or chronic inflammation (such as rheunmatoid arthritis). A familial form of secondary amyloidosis is also seen in other types of familial amyloidosis, e.g.. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). This familial type of amyloidosis is genetically inherited and is found in specific population groups. In both primary and secondary amyloidosis, deposits are found in several organs and are thus considered systemic amyloid diseases.<br>
"Localized amyloidoses" are those that tend to involve a single organ system. 'Different amyloids are also characterized by the type of protein present in the deposit For example, neurodegenerative diseases such as scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and the like are charactoized by the appearance and accumulation of a protease-resistant form of a prion protein (referred to as AScr or PrP-27) in the central nervous system. Similarly, Alzheuner's disease, another<br><br>
neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In this case, the amyloid plaques found in the parenchyma and the blood vessel is formed by the deposition of fibrillar Ap amyloid protein. Other diseases such as adult-onset diabetes (type II diabetes) are characterized by the localized accumulation of amyloid fibrils in the pancreas.<br>
Once these amyloids have formed, there is no known, widely accepted therapy or treatment which significantly dissolves amyloid deposits in situ, prevents fiirther amyloid deposition or prevents the initiation of amyloid deposition.<br>
Each amyloidogenic protein has the ability to undergo a conformational change and to organize into β-sheets and form insoluble fibrils which may be deposited extracellularly or intracellularly. Each amyloidogenic protein, although different in amino acid sequence, has the same property of forming fibrils and binding to other elements such as proteoglycan, amyloid P and complement component. Moreover, each amyloidogenic protein has amino acid sequences which, although different, show similarities such as regions with the ability to bind to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) portion of proteoglycan (referred to as the GAG binding site) as well as other regions which promote β-sheet formation. Proteoglycans are macromolecules of various sizes and structures that are districuted almost everywhere in the body. They can be found in the intracellular compartment, on the surface of cells, and as part of the extracellular matrix. The basic structure of all proteoglycans is comprised of a core protein and at least one, but fi-equently more, polysaccharide chains (GAGs) attached to the core protein. Many different GAGs have been discovered including chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparin, and hyaluronan.<br>
In specific cases, amyloid fibrils, once deposited, can become toxic to the surrounding cells. For example, the Ap fibrils organized as senile plaques have been shown to be associated with dead neuronal cells, dystrophic neurites, astrocytosis, and microgliosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease. When tested in vitro, oligomeric (soluble) as well as fibrillar Ap peptide was shown to be capable of triggering an activation process of microglia (brain macrophages), which would explain the presence of microgliosis and brain inflammation found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Both oligomeric and fibrillar Aβ peptide can also induce neuronal cell death in vitro. See, e.g., MP Lambert, et al, Proc Natl Acad. Sci. USA 95, 6448-53 (1998).<br>
In another type of amyloidosis seen in patients with type II diabetes, the amyloidogenic protein LAPP, when organized in oligomeric forms or in fibrils, has been shown to induce P-islet cell toxicity in vitro. Hence, appearance of lAPP fibrils in the<br><br>
pancreas of type 11 diabetic patients contributes to the loss of the β islet cells (Langerhans) and organ dysfunction which can lead to insulinemiua.<br>
Another type of amyloidosis is related to P2 microglobulin and is found in long-ter, hemodialysis patients. Patients undergoing long term hemodialysis will develop β2-microglobulin fibrils in the carpal tunnel and in the collagen rich tissues in several joints. This causes severe pains, joint stiffness and swelling.<br>
Amyloidosis is also characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a devastating disease of the brain that results in progressive memory loss leading to dementia, physical disability, and death over a relatively long period of time. With the aging populations in developed countries, the number of Alzheimer's patients is reaching epidemic proportions.<br>
People suffering from Alzheimer's disease develop a progressive dementia in adulthood, accompanied by three main structural changes in the brain: diffuse loss of neurons in multiple parts of the brain; accumulation of intracellular protein deposits termed neurofibrillary tangles; and accumulation of extracellular protein deposits termed amyloid or senile plaques, surrounded by misshapen nerve terminals (dystrophic neurites) and activated microglia (microgliosis and astrocytosis). A main constituent of these amyloid plaques is the amyloid-p peptide (Ap), a 39-43 amino-acid protein that is produced through cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Extensive research has been conducted on the relevance of Ap deposits in Alzheimer's disease, see, e.g., Selkoe, Trends in Cell Biology 8,447-453 (1998). Ap naturally arises from the metabolic processing of the amyloid precursor protein ("APP") in the endoplasmic reticulum ("ER")the Golgi apparatus, or the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, and most is normally secreted as a 40 ("Aβ1-40") or 42 ("Aβ1-42") amino acid peptide (Selkoe, AnniL Rev. Cell Biol 10, 373-403 (1994)). A role for Ap as a primary cause for Alzheimer's disease is supported by the presence of extracellular Ap deposits in senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease, the increased production of Ap in cells harboring mutant Alzheimer's disease associated genes, eg., amyloid precursor protein, presenilin I and presenilin II; and the toxicity of extracellular soluble (oligomOTc) or fibrillar Ap to cells in culture. See e,g,, Ga^ais, Eur. Biopharm. Review 40-42 (Autumn 2001); May, DDT 6,459-62 (2001). Although symptomatic treatments exist for Alzheimer's disease, this disease cannot be prevented or cured at this time,<br>
Alzheuner's disease is characterized by diffuse and neuritic plaques, cerebral angiopathy, and neurofibrillary tangles. Plaque and blood vessel amyloid is believed to be formed by the deposition of insoluble Ap amyloid protein, which may be described as<br><br>
diffuse or fibrillary. Both soluble oligomeric Ap and fibrillar Aβ are also believed to be neurotoxic and inflammatory.<br>
Another type of amyloidosis is cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is the specific deposition of amyloid-p fibrils in the walls of leptomingeal and cortical arteries, arterioles and veins. It is commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome and normal aging, as well as with a variety of familial conditions related to stroke or dementia {see Frangione et al. Amyloid: J. Protein Folding Disord. 8, Suppl 1, 36-42 (2001)).<br>
Presently available therapies for treatment of P-amyloid diseases are almost entirely symptomatic, providing only temporary or partial clinical benefit Although some pharmaceutical agents have been described that offer partial symptomatic relief, no comprehensive pharmacological therapy is currently available for the prevention or treatment of, for example, Alzheimer's disease.<br>

In one embodiment, the compounds disclosed herein prevent or inhibit amyloid protein assembly into insoluble fibrils which, in vivo, are deposited in various organs, or it favors clearance of pre-formed deposits or slows deposition in patients already having deposits. In another embodiment, the compound may also prevent the amyloid protein, in its soluble, oligomeric form or in its fibrillar form, from binding or adhering to a cell surface and causing cell damage or toxicity. In yet another embodiment, the compound may block amyloid-induced cellular toxicity or macrophage activation. In another embodiment, the compound may block amyloid-induced neurotoxicity or microglial activation. In another embodiment, the compound protects cells from amyloid induced cytotoxicity of B-islet cells. In another embodiment, the compound may enhance clearance from a specific organ, e.g., the brain or it decreases concentration of the amyloid protein in such a way that amyloid fibril formation is prevented in the targeted organ.<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered therapeutically or prophylactically to treat diseases associated with amyloid fibril formation, aggregation or deposition The compounds of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of an amyloid related disease using any of the following mechanisms (this list is meant to be illustrative and not limiting); slowing the rate of amyloid fibril formation or deposition; lessening the degree of amyloid deposition; inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid fibril formation; inhibiting neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity induced by amyloid; inhibiting amyloid induced inflammation; enhancing the clearance of amyloid; or favoring the degradation of amyloid protein prior to its organization in fibrils.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered therapeutically or prophlactically to treat diseases associated with amyloid-p fibril formation, aggregation or deposition. The compounds of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of an amyloid-p related disease using any of the following mechanisms (this list is meant to be illustrative and not limiting): slowing the rate of amyloid-p fibril formatibn or deposition; lessening the degree of amyloid-p deposition; inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid-P fibril formation; inhibiting neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity induced by amyloid-P; inhibiting amyloid-P induced inflammation; enhancing the clearance of amyloid-P firom the brain; or favoring the degradation of amyloid-P protein prior to its organization in fibrils.<br>
Therapeutic compounds of the invention may be effective in controlling amyioid-p deposition either following their entry into the brain (following penetration of the blood brain barrier) or from the periphery. When acting firom the periphery, a conpound may alter the equilibrium of Aβ between the brain and the plasma so as to favor the exit of A)3 from the brain. It may also increase the catabolism of neuronal Aβ and change the rate of exit from the brain An increase in the exit of Aβ firom the brain would result in a decrease in Aβ brain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) concentration and therefore favor a decrease in Aβ deposition. Alternatively, compounds that penetrate the brain could control deposition by acting directly on brain Aβ eg., by maintaining it in a non-fibrillar form, favoring its clearance firom the brain, or by slowing down APP processing. These compounds could also prevent Ap in the brain fi-om interacting with the cell surface and therefore prevent neurotoxicity, neurodegeneration or inflammation. They may also decrease Aβ production by activated microglia. The compounds may also increase degradation by macrophages or neuronal cells.<br>
In one embodiment, the method is used to treat Alzheimer's disease (e.g., sporadic, familia, or early AD). The method can also be used prophylactically or therapeutically to treat other clinical occurrences of amyloid-p deposition, such as in<br><br>
Down's syndrome individuals and in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy ("CAA") or hereditary cerebral hemorrhage.<br>
In another embodiment, the method is used to treat mild cognitive impairment Mild Cognitive Impairment ("MCT") is a condition characterized by a state of mild but measurable impairment in thinking skills, which is not necessarily associated with the presence of dementia. MCI frequently, but not necessarily, precedes Alzheimer's<br>
disease.<br>
Additionally, abnormal accumulation of APP and of amyloid-β protein in muscle fibers has been implicated in the pathology of sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) (Askanas, et al., Proc. NatL Acad. ScL USA 93,1314-1319 (1996); Askanas, et al, Current Opinion in Rheumatology 7,486-496 (1995)). Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be used prophylactically or therapeutically in the treatment of disorders in which amyloid-beta protein is abnormally deposited at non-neurological locations, such as treatment of IBM by delivery of the compounds to muscle fibers.<br>
Additionally, it has been shown that Ap is associated with abnormal extracellular deposits, known as drusen, that accumulate along the basal surface of the retinal pigmented epithelium in individuals with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a cause of irreversible vision loss in older individuals. It is believed that Aβ deposition could be an important component of the local inflammatory events that contribute to atrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium, drusen biogenesis, and the pathogenesis of AMD (Johnson, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99(18), 11830-5 (2002)).<br>
The present invention therefore relates to the use of compounds of Formulae I, n, in, IV, V, VI, Vn, or otherwise described herein in the prevention or treatment of amyloid-related diseases, including, inter alia, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, mild cognitive impairment, inclusion body myositis, Down's syndrome, macular degeneration, as well as other types of amyloidosis like lAPP- related amyloidosis (e.g., diabetes), primary (AL) amyloidosis, secondary (AA) amyloidosis and β2 microglobulin-related (dialysis-related) amyloidosis.<br>
In Type II diabetes related amyloidosis (lAPP), the amyloidogenic protein lAPP induces p-islet cell toxicity when organized in oligomeric forms or in fibrils. Hence, appearance of lAPP fibrils in the pancreas of type 11 diabetic patients contributes to the loss of the p islet cells (Langerthans) and organ dysfunction which leads to insulinemia.<br>
Primary amyloidosis (AL amyloid) is usually found associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and multiple myeloma. It can also be found as an idiopathic disease.<br><br>
Secondary (AA) amyloidosis is usually seen associated with chronic infection (such as tuberculosis) or chronic inflammation (such as rheumatoid arthritis). A familial fonn of secondary amyloidosis is also seen in Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).<br>
β2 microglobulin-related (dialysis-related) amyloidosis is found in long-term hemodialysis patients. Patients undergoing long term hemodialysis will develop β2-microglobulin fibrils in the carpal tunnel and in the collagen rich tissues in several joints. This causes severe pains, joint stiffness and swelling. These deposits are due to the inability to maintain low levels of β2M in plasma of dialyzed patients. Increased plasma concentrations of β2M protein will induce structural changes and may lead to the deposition of modified β2M as insoluble fibrils in the joints.<br>
Detailed Description of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the use of compounds of Formulae I, n, HI, IV, V, VI, Vn, or compounds otherwise described herein in the treatment of amyloid-related diseases. For convenience, some definitions of terms referred to herein are set forth below.<br>
Amyloid-Related Diseases<br>
AA (Reactive) Amyloidosis<br>
Generally, AA amyloidosis is a manifestation of a number of diseases that provoke a sustained acute phase response. Such diseases include chronic inflammatory disorders, chronic local or systemic microbial infections, and malignant neoplasms. The most common form of reactive or secondary (AA) amyloidosis is seen as the result of long-standing inflammatory conditions. For example, patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis or Familial Mediterranean Fever (which is a genetic disease) can develop AA amyloidosis. The terms "AA amyloidosis" and "secondary (AA) amyloidosis" are used interchangeably.<br>
AA fibrils are generally composed of 8,000 Dalton fragments (AA peptide or protein) formed by proteolytic cleavage of serum amyloid A protein (ApoS AA), a circulating apolipoprotein which is mainly synthesized in hepatocytes in response to such cytokines as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF. Once secreted, ApoSAA is complexed with HDL. Deposition of AA fibrils can be widespread in the body, with a preference for parenchymal organs. The kidneys are usually a deposition site, and the liver and the spleen may also be affected. Deposition is also seen in the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and the skirt<br><br>
Underlying diseases which can lead to the development of AA amyloidosis include, but are not limited to inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile chronic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthropathy,  Reiter-'s syndrome. Adult Still's disease, Behcet's syndrome, and Crohn's disease. AA deposits are also produced as a result of chronic microbial infections, such as leprosy, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, decubitus ulcers, chronic pyelonephritis, osteomyelitis, and Whipple's disease. Certain malignant neoplasms can also result in AA fibril amyloid deposits. These include such conditions as Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal carcinoma, carcinomas of gut, lung and urogenital tract, basal cell carcinoma, and hairy cell leukemia. Other underlying conditions that may be associated with AA amyloidosis are Castleman's disease and Schnitzler's syndrome.<br>
AL Amyloidoses (Primary Amyloidosis)<br>
AL amyloid deposition is generally associated with almost any dyscrasia of the B lymphocyte lineage, ranging firom malignancy of plasma cells (multiple myeloma) to benign monoclonal gammopathy. At times, the presence of amyloid deposits may be a primary indicator of the underlying dyscrasia. AL amyloidosis is also described in detail in Current Drug Targets, 2004, J 159-171.<br>
Fibrils of AL amyloid deposits are composed of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains or fragments thereof. More specifically, the fragments are derived from the N-terminal region of the light chain (kappa or lambda) and contain all or part of the variable (VL) domain thereof. Deposits gneerally occur in the mesenchymal tissues, causing peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, macroglossia, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arthropathy of large joints, immune dyscrasias, myelomas, as well as occult dyscrasias. However, it should be noted that almost any tissue, particularly visceral organs such as the kidney, liver, spleen and heart, may be involved.<br>
Hereditary Systemic Amyloidoses<br>
There are many forms of hereditary systemic amyloidoses. Although they are relatively rare conditions, adult onset of symptoms and their inheritance patterns (usually autosomal dominant) lead to persistence of such disorders in the general population. Generally, the syndromes are attributable to point mutations in the precursor protein leading to production of variant amyioidogenic peptides or proteins. Table 1 summarizes thr fibril composition of exemplary forms of these disorders.<br><br><br><br><br>
Data derived from Tan SY, Pepys MB. Amyloidosis, Histopathologyy 25(5), 403-414 (Nov 1994), WHO/IUIS Nomenclature Subcommittee, Nomenclature of Amyloid and Amyloidosis. Bulletin of the WorldHealfliOrganisationl993;71:10508; and Mwlinic^a/., Clin Chem Lab Med 2001; 39(11): 1065-75.<br>
The data provided in Table 1 are exemplary and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. For example, more than 40 separate point mutations in the<br><br>
transthyretin gene have been described, all of which give rise to clinically similar fonns of familial amyloid polynem-opathy.<br>
In general, any hereditary amyloid disorder can also occur sporadically, and both hereditary and sporadic forms of a disease present with the same characteristics with regard to amyloid. For example, the most prevalent form of secondary AA amyloidosis occurs sporadicallyy, e.g. as a result of ongoing inflammation, and is not associated with Familial Mediterranean Fever. Thus general discussion relating to hereditary amyloid disorders below can also be applied to sporadic amyloidoses.<br>
Transthyretin (TTR) is a 14 kiloDalton protein that is also sometimes referred to as prealbumin. It is produced by the liver and choroid plexus, and it functions in transporting thyroid hormones and vitamin A. At least 50 variant forms of the protein, each characterized by a single amino acid change, are responsible for various forms of familial amyloid polyneuropathy. For example, substitution of proline for leucine at position 55 results in a particularly progressive form of neuropathy; substitution of methionine for leucine at position 111 resulted in a severe cardiopathy in Danish patients.<br>
Amyloid deposits isolated from heart tissue of patients with systemic amyloidosis have revealed that the deposits are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of TTR and fragments thereof, collectively referred to as ATTR, the full length sequences of which have been characterized. ATTR fibril components can be extracted from such plaques and their structure and sequence determined according to the methods known in the art (e.g,, Gustavsson, A., et ah. Laboratory Invest. 73: 703-708,1995; Kametani, F., et al., Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun, 125: 622-628. 1984; Pras, M., et al, PNAS 80: 539-42,1983).<br>
Persons having point mutations in the molecule apolipoprotein Al (e.g., Gly-&gt;Arg26; Trp-&gt;Arg50; Leu-&gt;Arg60) exhibit a form of amyloidosis ("Ostertag type") characterized by deposits of the protein apolipoprotein AI or fragments thereof (AApoAI). These patients have low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) and preset with a peripheral neuropathy or renal failure.<br>
A mutation in the alpha chain of the enzyme lysozyme (e.g., Ile-&gt;Thr56 or Asp-&gt;His57) is the basis of another form of Ostertag-type non-neuropathic hereditary amyloid reported in English, families. Here, fibrils of the mutant lysozyme protein (Alys) are deposited, and patients generally exhibit impaired renal function. This protein, unlike most of the fibril-forming proteins described herein, is usually present in whole (unfragmented) form (Benson, M.D., et al CIBA Fdn. Symp. 199:104-131, 1996).<br><br><br>
Comparison of amyloidogenic to non-amyloidogenic light chains has revealed that the fonner can include replacements or substitutions that appear to destabilize the folding of the protein and promote aggregation, AL and LCDD have been distinguished from other amyloid diseases due to their relatively small population monoclonal light chains, which are manufactured by neoplastic expansion of an antibody-producing B cell. AL aggregates typically are well-ordered fibrils of lambda chains. LCDD aggregates are relatively amorphous aggregations of both kappa and lambda chains, with a majority being kappa, in some cases KIV. Bellotti et al., JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY 13:280-89 (2000), Comparison of amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogmic heavy chains in patients having AH amyloidosis has revealed missing and/or altered components. Eulitz et ai, PROC NATL ACAD Sci USA 87:6542-46 (1990) (pathogenic heavy chain characterized by significantly lower molecular mass than non-amyloidogenic heavy chains); and Solomon et al AM JHEMAT 45(2) 171-6 (1994) (amyloidogenic heavy chain characterized as consisting solely of the VH-D portion of the non-amyloidogenic heavy chain).<br>
Accordingly, potential methods of detecting and monitoring treatment of subjects having or at risk of having AL, LCDD, AH, and the like, include but are not limited to immunoassaying plasma or urine for the presence or depressed deposition of amyloidogenic light or heavy chains, e.g., amyloid \ amyloid K, amyloid KIV, amyloid 7, or amyloid 7I.<br>
Brain Amyloidosis<br>
The most firequent type of amyloid in the brain is composed primarily of Ap peptide fibrils, resulting in dementia associated with sporadic (non-hereditary) Alzheimer's disease. In fact, the incidence of sporadic Alzheimer's disease greatly<br><br>
exceeds forms shown to be hereditary. Nevertheless, fibril peptides forming plaques are very similar in both types. Brain amyloidosis includes those diseases, conditions, pathologies, and other abnormalities of the structure or function of the brain, including components thereof in which the causative agent is amyloid. The area of the brain affected in an amyloid-related disease may be the stroma including the vasculature or the parenchyma including functional or anatomical regions, or neurons themselves. A subject need not have received a definitive diagnosis of a specifically recognized amyloid-related disease. The term "amyloid related disease" includes brain amyloidosis.<br><br><br>
the predominant form produced, 5-7% of total Aβ exists as AP42 (Cappai et al. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol 31. 885-89 (1999)).<br><br>
As used herein, the terms "β amyloid," "amyloid-p," and the like refer to amyloid β proteins or peptides, amyloid p precursor protems or peptides, intermediates, and modifications and fragments thereof mxless otherwise specifically indicated. In particular, "Aβ" refers to any peptide produced by proteolytic processing of the APP gene product, especially peptides which are associated with amyloid pathologies.<br><br><br>
Gelsolin is a calcium binding protein that binds to fragments and actin filaments. Mutations at position 187 {e.g., Asp-&gt;Asn; Asp-&gt;Tyr) of the protein result in a form of hereditary systemic amyloidosis, usually found in patients from Finland, as well as persons of Dutch or Japanese origin. In afflicted individuals, fibrils formed from gelsolin fragments (Agel), usually consist of amino acids 173-243 (68 kDa carboxyterminal fragment) and are deposited in blood vessels and basement membranes, resulting in corneal dystrophy and cranial neuropathy which progresses to peripheral neuropathy, dystrophic skin changes and deposition in other organs. (Kangas, H,, et ai Human MoL Genet 5(9): 1237-1243,1996).<br>
Other mutated proteins, such as mutant alpha chain of fibrinogen (AfibA) and mutant cystatin C (Acys) also form fibrils and produce characteristic hereditary disorders. AfibA fibrils form deposits characteristic of a nonneuropathic hereditary amyloid with renal disease; Acys deposits are characteristic of a hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy reported in Iceland (Isselbacher, Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, McGraw-IEll, San Francisco, 1995; Benson, et al). In at least some cases, patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) have been shown to have amyloid fibrils containing a non-mutant form of cystatin C in conjunction with amyloid beta protein (Nagai, A., et al Molec. Chem. NeuropathoL 33: 63-78,1998).<br>
Certain forms of prion disease are now considered to be heritable, accounting for up to 15% of cases, which were previously thought to be predominanfly infectious in<br><br>
nature. (Baldwin, etal, in Research Advances in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1995). In hereditary and sporadic prion disorders, patients develop plaques composed of abnormal isofonns of the nomial prion protein (PrPsc).<br>
A predominant mutant isoform, PrPsc, also referred to as AScr, differs from the normal cellular protein in its resistance to protease degradation, insolubility after detergent extraction, deposition in secondary lysosomes, post-translational synthesis, and high β-pleated sheet content. Genetic linkage has been established for at least five mutations resulting in Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). (Baldwin, supra) Methods for extracting fibril peptides from scrapie fibrils, determining sequences and making such ppetides are known in the art (e.g., Beekes, M., et al J. Gen. Virol. 76:2567-76,1995).<br>
For example, one form of GSS has been linked to a PrP mutation at codon 102, while telencephalic GSS segregates with a mutation at codon 117. Mutations at codons 198 and 217 result in a form of GSS in which neuritic plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease contain PrP instead of Aβ peptide. Certain forms of familial CID have been associated with mutations at codons 200 and 210; mutations at codons 129 and 178 have been found in both familial CJD and FFL (Baldwin, supra).<br>
Cerebral Amyloidosis<br>
Local deposition of amyloid is common in the brain, particularly in elderly individuals. The most frequent type of amyloid in the brain is composed primarily of Aβ peptide fibrils, resulting in dementia or sporadic (non-hereditary) Alzheimer's disease, The most common occurrences of cerebral amyloidosis are sporadic and not familial For example, the incidence of sporadic Alzheimer's disease and sporadic CAA greatly exceeds the incidence of familial AD and CAA. Moreover, sporadic and familial forms of the disease cannot be distinguished from each other (they differ only in the presence or absence of an inherited genetic mutation); for example, the clinical symptoms and the amyloid plaques formed in both sporadic and familial AD are very similar, if not identical.<br>
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) refers to the specific deposition of amyloid fibrils in the walls of leptomingeal and cortical arteries, arterioles and veins. It is commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome and normal agmg, as well as with a variety of familial conditions related to stroke or dementia (see Frangione et al. Amyloid: J. Protein Foldmg Disord. 8, Suppl. 1,36-42 (2001)). CAA can occur sporadically or be hereditary.<br><br>
Senile Systemic Amyloidosis<br>
Amyloid deposition, either systemic or focal, increases with age. For example, fibrils of wild type transthyretin (TTR) are commonly found in the heart tissue of elderly individuals. These may be asymptomatic, clinically silent, or may result in heart failure. Asymptomatic fibrillar focal deposits may also occur in the brain (Aβ), corpora amylacea of the prostate (02 microglobulin), joints and seminal vesicles.<br>
Dialysis-related Amyloidosis (DRA)<br><br><br>
result from the aggregation of the islet amyloid polypeptide (lAPP) or amylin, which is a 37 amino acid peptide, derived from a larger precursor peptide, called pro-IAPP.<br>
lAPP is co-secreted with insulin in response to β-cell secretagogues. This pathological feature is not associated with insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetes and is a unifying characteristic for the heterogeneous clinical phenotypes diagnosed as NIDDM (Type II diabetes).<br>
Longitudinal studies in cats and immunocytochemical investigations in monkeys have shown that a progressive increase in islet amyloid is associated with a dramatic decrease in the population of insulin-secreting p-cells and increased severity of the disease. More recently, transgenic studies have strengthened the relationship between lAPP plaque fonnation and p-cell apoptosis and dysfunction, indicating that amyloid dq&gt;osition is a principal factor in increasing severity of Type n diabetes.<br><br><br>
and cause death or dysfunction of the cells. This may occur even when the cells are fix)m a healthy donor and the patient receiving the transplant does not have a disease that is characterized by the presence of fibrils. For example, compounds of the present invention may also be used in preparing tissues or cells for transplantation according to the methods described in International Patent Application (PCX) number- WO 01/003680.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also stabilize the ratio of the concentrations of Pro-IAPP/IAPP, pro-Insulin/Insulin and C-peptide levels. In addition, as biological markers of efficacy, the results of the different tests, such as the arginine-insulin secretion test, the glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance and sensitivity tests, could all be used as markers of reduced β-cell mass and/or accumulation of amyloid deposits. Such class of drugs could be used together with other drugs targeting insulin resistance, hq)atic glucose production, and insulin secretion. Such compoimds might prevent insulin thCT^y by preserving P-cell fimction and be applicable to preserving islet transplants.<br>
Hormone-derived Amyloidoses<br>
Endocrine organs may harbor amyloid deposits, particularly in aged individuals. Hormone-secreting tumors may also contain hormone-derived amyloid plaques, the fibrils of which are made up of polypeptide hormones such as calcitonin (medullary carcinoma of the thyroid), and atrial natriuretic peptide (isolated atrial amyloidosis). Sequences and structures of these proteins are well known in the art.<br>
Miscellaneous Amyloidoses<br>
There are a variety of other forms of amyloid disease that are normally manifest as localized deposits of amyloid. In general, these diseases are probably the result of the localized production or lack of catabolism of specific fibril precursors or a predisposition of a particular tissue (such as the joint) for fibril depotion. Examples of such idiopathic position include nodular AL amyloid, cutaneous amyloid, endocrine amyloid, and tumor-related amyloid Other amyloid related diseases include those described in Table 1, such as failial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), seni systemic amyloidosis, Tenosynovium, familial amyloidosis, Ostertag-type, non-neuropathic amyloidosis, cranial neuropathy, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage, familial dementia, chronic dialysis, familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; Gerstmarm-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, hereditary spongiform encephalopathies, prion diseases, familial Mediterranean fever, Muckle-Well's syndrome, nepropaty, deafnss, urticaria, limb pain, cardiomyopathy, cutaneous deposits, multiple myeloma, benign monoclonal<br><br>
gammopathy, maccoglobulinaemia, myeloma associated amyloidosis, medullary carcinomas of the thyroid, isolated atrial amyloid, and diabetes.<br>
The compoundsf the invention may be administered therapeutically or prophylactically to treat diseases associated with amyloid fibril formation, aggregation or dsposition, regardless of the clinical setting. The compounds of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of an amyloid related disease using any of the following mechanisms, such as, for example but not limited to: slowing the rate of amyloid fibril formation or deposition; lessening the degree of amyloid deposition; inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid fibril formation; inhibiting amyloid induced inflammation; enhancing the clearance of amyloid firom, for example, the brain; or protecting cells from amyloid induced (oligomers or fibrillar) toxicity.<br>
In an embodiment, the compounds of the invention maybe administered therapeutically or prophylactically to treat diseases associated with amyloid-β fibril formation, aggregation or depositioon The compounds of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of an amyloid-p related disease using any of the following mechanisms (this list is meant to be illustrative and not limiting): slowing the rate of amyloid-p fibril formation or deposition lessening the degree of amyloid-β deposition; inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid-p fibril formation; inhibiting neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity induced by amyloid-p; inhibiting amyloid-p induced inflammation; enhancing the clearance of amyloid-P from the brain; or favoring greater catabolism of Aβ,<br><br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the method is used to treat Alzheimer's disease (e.g., sporadic or familial AD). The method can also be used prophylactically or therapeutically to treat other clinical occurrences of amyloid-β deposition, such as in Down's syndrome individuals and in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy ("CAA"), hereditary cerebral hemorrhage, or early Alzheimer's disease.<br>
In another embodiment, the method is used to treat mild cognitive impairment. Mild Cognitive Impairment ("MCT") is a condition characterized by a state of mild but measurable impairment in thinking skills, which is not necessarily associated with the presence of dementia, MCI frequently, but not necessarily, precedes Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Additionally, abnormal accumulation of APP and of amyloid-p protein in muscle fibers has been implicated in the pathology of sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) (Askanas, V., et al (1996) Proc. Natl Acad, Set USA 93:1314-1319; Askanas, V. et al (1995) Current Opinion in Rheumatology 7:486-496), Accordingly, the compounds of the invention can be used prophylactically or therapeutically in the treatment of disorders in which amyloid-beta protein is abnormally deposited at non-neurological locations, such as treatment of IBM by delivery of the compounds to muscle fibers.<br><br><br>
amyloidosis, e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These compounds can also improve quality of daily living in these subjects.<br>
The therapeutic compounds of the invention may treat amyloidosis related to type II diabetes by, for example, stabilizing glycemia, preventing or reducing the loss of β cell mass, reducing or preventing hyperglycemia due to loss of β cell mass, and modulating (e.g., increasing or stabilizing) insulin production. The compounds of the invention may also stabilize the ratio of the concentrations of pro-IAPP/IAPP,<br>
The thCTapeutic compounds of the invention may treat AA (secondary) amyloidosis and/or AL (primary) amyloidosis, by stabilizing renal fimction, decreasing proteinuria, increasing creatinine clearance (e.g., by at least 50% or greats: or by at least 100% or greater), by leading to remission of chronic diarrhea or weight gain (e.g., 10% or greater), or by reducing serun creatinine. Visceral amyloid content as determined, e.g., by SAP scintigraphy may also be reduced.<br>

The chemical stmctures herein are drawn according to the conventional standards known in the art Thus, where an atom, such as a carbon atom, as drawn appears to have an unsatisfied valency, then that valency is assumed to be satisfied by a hydrogen atom even though that hydrogen atom is not necessarily explicitly drawn. The structures of some of the compounds of this invention include stereogenic carbon atoms. It is to be understood that isomers arising from such asymmetry (e.g., all enantiomers<br><br>
and diastereomers) are included within the scope of this invention unless indicated otherwise.

Subjects and Patient Povulations<br>
The term "subject"' includes living organisms in which amyloidosis can occur, or which are susceptible to amyloid diseases, 6-g., Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrbmej CAA, dialysis-related (βM) amyloidosis, secondary (AA) amyloidosis, primary (AL) amyloidosis, hereditary amyloidosis, diabetes, etc. Examples of subjects include humans, chickens, ducks, peking ducks, geese, monkeys, deer, cows, rabbits, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, mice, rats, and transgenic species thereof. Administration of the compositions of the present invention to a subject to be treated can be carried out using known procedures, at dosages and for periods of time effective to modulate amyloid aggregation or amyloid-induced toxicity in the subject as further described herein. An effective amount of the therapeutic compoound necessary to achieve a therpeutic effect may vary according to factors such as the amount of amyloid already deposited at the clinical site in the subject, the age, sex, and weight of the subject, and the ability of the therapeutic compound to modulate amyloid aggregation in the subject Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the subject is in need of treatment by the methods of the invention, and is selected for treatment based on this need. A subject in need of treatment is art-recognized, and includes subjects that have been identified as having a disease or disorder related to amyloid-deposition or amyloidosis, has a symptom of such a disease or disorder, or is at risk of such a disease or disorder, and would be expected, based on diagnosis, e-g., medical diagnosis, to benefit from treatment (e.g., curing, healing, preventing, alleviating, relieving, altering, remedying, ameliorating, improving, or affecting the disease or disorder, the symptom of the disease or disorder, or the risk of the disease or disorder).<br>
In an exemplary aspect of the invention, the subject is a human. For example, the subject may be a human over 30 years old, human over 40 years old, a human over 50 years old, a human over 60 years old, a human ova- 70 years old, a human over 80 years old, a human over 85 years old, a human ova: 90 years old, or a human over 95 years old. The subject may be a female human, including a postmenopausal female human, who may be on hormone (estrogen) replacement therapy. The subject may also be a male human. In another embodiment, the subject is under 40 years old.<br><br><br>
Several genotypes are believed to predispose a subject to Alzheimer's disease. These include the genotypes such as presenilin-1, presenilm-2, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) missense mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease, and α-2-macroglobulin and LRP-1 genotypes, which are thought to increase the risk of acquiring sporadic (late-onset) Alzheimer's disease. E-van Uden, et al, X Neurosci: 22(21), 9298-304 (2002); JJ.Goto, et al, J. Mol. Neurosci 19(1-2), 37-41 (2002). Another genetic risk factor for the development of Alzherimer's disease are variants of ApoE, the gane that encodes apolipoprotein E (particulariy the apoEA genotype), a constituent of the low-density lipoprotein particle. WJ Strittmatter, et al, Annl Rev, Neurosci. 19,53-77 (1996). The molecular mechanisms by whihc the varioxis ApoE alleles alter the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease are unknown, however the role of ApoE in cholesterol metabolism is consistent with the growing body of evidence linking cholesterol metabolism to Alzheimer's disease. For example, chronic use of cholesterol-lowering dmgs such as statms has recently been associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease, and cholesterol-lowering dmgs have been shown to reduce pathology in APP transgenic mice. These and other studies suggest that cholesterol may affect APP processing. ApoE4 has been suggested to alto: Ap trafficking (in and out of the brain), and fevor retention of Ap in the brain. ApoE4 has also been suggested to favor APP processing toward Ap formation. Environmental factors have been proposed as predisposing a subject to Alzheimer's disease, including exposure to aluminum, although the epidemiological evidence is ambiguous. In addition, prior infection by certain viral or bacterial agents may predispose a subject to Alzheimer's disease, including the herpes simplex virus and chlamydia pneumoniae.<br><br>
Finally, other predisposing factors for Alzheimer's disease can include risk factors for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, including cigarette smoking, hypertension and diabetes. "At risk for Alzheimer's disease" also encompasses any other predisposing factors not listed above or as yet identified and includes an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease caused by head injury, medications, diet, or lifestyle.<br><br><br>
In still a further embodiment, the subject is shown to be at risk by a diagnostic brain imaging technique, for example, one thazt measures brain activity, plaque deposition, or brain atrophy.<br>
In still a fiirther embodiment, the subject is shown to be at risk by a cognitive test such as Clinical Dementia Rating ("CDR"), Alzeimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition ("ADAS-Cog"), or Mini-Mental Stale Examination ("MMSE"). The subject may exhibit a below average score on a cognitive test, as compared to a historical control of similar age and educational background. The subject may also exhibit a<br><br><br>
about 22, below about 20, below about 18, below about 16, below about 14, below about 12, below about 10, below about 8, below about 6, bdow about 4, below about 2, or below about 1.<br>
Another means to evaluate cognition, particularly Alzherimer's disease, is the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), or a variation tenned the<br><br>
By using the methods of the present invention, the levels of amyloid β  peptides in a subject's plasma or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be reduced from levels prior to treatment from about 10 to about 100 percent, or even about 50 to about 100 percent<br><br>
In an alternative embodiment, the subject can have an elevated level of amyloid Aβ 4o and Aβ 42 peptide in the blood and CSF prior to treatment, according to the present<br><br><br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may act to ameliorate the course of an amyloid-related disease using any of the following mechanisms (this list is meant to be illustrative and not limiting): slowing the rate of amyloid fibril formation or deposition; lessening the degree of amyloid deposition; inhibiting, reducing, or preventing amyloid fibril formation; inhibiting neurodegeneration or cellular toxicity induced by amyloid; inhibiting amyloid induced inflammation; enhancing the clearance of amyloid from the brain; enhancing degradation of Aβ  in the brain; or favoring clearance of amyloid protein prior to its organization in fibrils.<br>
"Modulation" of amyloid deposition includes both inhibition, as defined above, and enhancement of amyloid deposition or fibril formation. The term "modulating" is intended, therefore, to encompass prevention or stopping of amyloid formation or accumulation, inhibition or slowing down of further amyloid formation or accumulation in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis, e.g, already having amyloid deposition, and reducing or reversing of amyloid formation or accumulation in a subject with ongoing amyloidosis; and enhancing amyloid deposition, eg:, increasing the rate or amount of<br><br>
amyloid deposition in vivo or in vitro. Amyloid-enhancing compounds may be useful in animal models of amyloidosis, for example, to make possible the development of amyloid deposits in animals in a shorter  periodof time or to increase amyloid deposits over a selected period of time. Amyloid-enhacing compounds  may be useful in screening assays for compounds which inhibit amyloidosis in vivo, for example, in animal models, cellular assays and in vutro assays for amyloidosis. Such compounds may be used, for example, to provide faster or more sensitive assays for compounds.<br><br><br>

Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such agents can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e,g., for determining<br><br>
the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be axpressed as tbe ratio LD50/ED50, and usually a larger therapeutic index is more efficacious. While agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to unaffected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.<br>
It is understood that appropriate doses depaid upon a number of factors within the ken of the ordinarily skilled physician, veterinarian, or researcii«. The dose(s) of the small molecule will vary, for example, depending upon tbe identity, size, and condition of the subject or sample being treated, further depending upon the route by  which the composition is to be administered, if applicable, and the effect which the practitioner desires the small molecule to have upon the subject Exemplary doses include milligram or microgram amounts of the small molecule per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g., about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per kilogram, about 100 micrograms per kilogram to about 5 milligrams per kilogram, or about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 50 micrograms per kilogram). It is furthemore understood that appropriate doses depend upon the potency. Such appropriate doses may be determined using the assays described herein. When one or more of these compounds is to be administered to an animal (e.g., a human), a physician, veterinarian, or researcher may, for example, prescribe a relatively low dose at first, subsequently increasing the dose until an appropriate response is obtained In addition, it is understood that the specific dose level for any particular animal subject will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific agent employed, the age, body weight, general health, gender, and diet of the subject, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion, and any drug combination.<br>
The ability of an agent to inhibit amyloid deposition can be evaluated in an animal model system that may be predictive of efficacy in inhibiting amyloid deposition in human diseases, such as a transgenic mouse expressing human APP or other relevant animal models where Aβ deposition is seen or for example in an animal model of AA amyloidosis. Likewise, the ability of an agent to prevent or reduce cognitive impairment in a model system may be indicative of efficacy in humans. Altermiatively, the ability of an agent can be evaluated by examining the ability of the agent to inhibit amyloid fibril formation in vitro, e.g., using a fibrillogenesis assay such as that described herein, including a ThT, CD, or EM assay. Also the binding of an agent to amyloid fibrils may be measured using a MS assay as described herein The ability of the agent to protect cells from amyloid induced toxicity is determined in vitro using biochemical assays to<br><br>
determine percent cell death induced by amyloid protein. The ability of an agent to modulate renal function may also be evaluated in an appropriate animal model system-<br>
The therapeutic agent of the invention may be also be administered ex vivo to inhibit amyloid deposition or treat certain amyloid-related diseases, such as β2M amyloidosis and other amyloidoses related to dialysis. Ex vivo administration of the therapeutic agents of the invention can be accomplished by contacting a body fluid (e.g., blood, plasma, etc.) with a therapeutic compound of the invention such that the therapeutic compound is capable of performing its intended function and administering the body fluid to the subject. The therapeutic compound of the invention may perform its function ex vivo (e.g., dialysis filter), in vivo (e.g., administered with the body fluid), or both For example, a therapeutic compound of the invention may be used to reduce plasma β2M levels and/or maintain β2M in its soluble form ex vivo, in vivo, or both.<br>
Blood-Brain Barrier<br>
Regardless of the particular mechanism by which the compound exerts its biological effects, the compound prevents or treats amyloid-related diseases, such as for example Alzheimer's disease, CAA, diabetes related amyloidosis, AL amyloidosis, Down's syndrome, or JS2M amyloidosis. The compound may reverse or favor deposition of amyloid or the compound may favor plaque clearance or slow deposition. For example, the compoimd may decrease the amyloid concentration in the brain of a subject versus an untreated subject. The compound may penetrate into the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier ("BBB") to exert its biological effect The compound may maintain soluble amyloid in a non-fibrillar form, or alternatively, the compound may increase the rate of clearance of soluble amyloid from the brain of a subject versus an xmtreated subject The compound may also increase the rate of degradation of Aβ in the brain prior to organization into fibrils. A compound may also act in the periphery, causing a change in the equilibrium of the amyloid protein concentration in the two conmpartments (i.e., systemic vs, central), in which case a compoimd may not be required to penetrate the brain to decrease the concentration of Aβ in the brain (a "sink' effect).<br>
Agents of the invention that exert their physiological effect in vivo in the brain may be more useful if they gain access to target cells in the brain. Non-limiting examples of brain cells are neurons, glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia), cerebrovascular cells (muscle cells, endothelial cells), and cells that comprise the meninges. The blood brain barrier ("BBB") typically restricts access to brain cells by acting as a physical and functional blockade that separates the brain parenchyma from the systemic circulation (see, e.g,, Pardridge, et al,l Neurovirol 5(6), 556-69 (1999); Rubin, et al, Rev, Neurosci. 22,11-28 (1999)). Circulating molecules are normally able<br><br>
to gain access to brain cells via one of two processes: lipid-mediated transport through the BBB by free diffusion, or active (or catalyzed) transport.<br>
The agents of the invention may be formulated to improve distribution in vivo, for example as powdered or liquid tablet or solution for oral administration or as a nasal spray, nose drops, a gel or ointment, through a tube or catheter, by syringe, by packtail, by pledget, or by submucosal infusion. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic agents. To ensure that the more hydrophilic therapeutic agents of the invention cross the BBB, they may be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs ("targeting moieties" or "targeting groups" or "transporting vectors"), thus providing targeted drug delivery {see, eg., V.V. Ranade J, Clin. Pharmacol 29,685 (1989)). Likewise, the agents may be linked to targeting groups that facilitate penetration of the blood brain barrier. In one embodiment, the method of the present invention employs a naturally occurring polyamine linked to an agent that is a small molecule and is useful for inhibiting e.g-, Aβ deposition.<br>
To facilitate transport of agents of the invention across the BBB, they may be coupled to a BBB transport vector (for review of BBB transport vectors and mechanisms, see, Bickel, et al. Adv. Drug Delivery Review 46,247-79 (2001)), Exemplary transport vectors include cationized albumin or the OX26 monoclonal antibody to the transferrin receptor; these proteins undergo absorptive-mediated and receptor-mediated transcytosis through the BBB, respectively. Natural cell metabolites that may be used as targeting groups, include, inter alia, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, or DHA. Other exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin {see, e.g., U.S. Pat No. 5,416,016); mannosides (Umezawa, et ai, Biochem. Biophys. Res. . Commun. 153,1038 (1988)); antibodies (P.G. Bloeman,et al, FEBS Lett. 357,140 (1995); M. Owais, et ai, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39,180 (1995)); surfactant protem A receptor (Briscoe, et al, Am J. Physiol 1233,134 (1995)); gpl20 (Schreier, et al, J. Biol Chem. 269,9090 (1994)); see also, K. Keinanen and M.L. LauVkanen, FEBSLett. 346,123 (1994); JJ. Killion and LJ. Fidler,Immunomethods 4,273 (1994),<br>
Examples of other BBB transport vectors that target receptor-mediated transport systems into the brain include factors such as insulin, insulih-like growth factors ("IGF-I," and '(IGF-IT'), angiotensin II, atrial and brain natriuretic peptide ("ANP," and "BNP"), interleukin I ("IL-1") and transferrin. Monoclonal antibodies to the receptors feat bind these factors may also be used as BBB transport vectors. BBB transport vectors targeting mechanisms for absorptive-mediated transcytosis include cationic moieties<br><br>
such as cationized LDL, albumin or horseradish peroxidase coupled with polylysine, cationized albumin or cationized immunoglobulins. Small basic oligopeptides such as the dynorphin analogue E-2078 and the ACTH analogue ebiratide may also cross the brain via absorptive-mediated transcytosis and are potential transport vectors.<br>
Other BBB transport vectors target systems for transporting nutrients into the brain. Examples of such BBB transport vectors include hexose moieties, eg., glucose and monocarboxylic acids, e.g., lactic acid and neutral amino acids, eg., phenylalanine and amines, e.g,, choline and basic amino acids, eg., arginine, nucleosides, eg., adenosine and purine bases, eg., adenine, and thyroid hormone, eg., triiodothyridine. Antibodies to the extracellular domain of nutrient transporters may also be used as transport vectors. Other possible vectors include angiotensin II and ANP, which may be involved in regulating BBB penneability.<br>
In some cases, the bond linking the therapeutic agent to the transport vector may be cleaved following transport into the brain in order to liberate the biologically active agent Exemplary linkers include disulfide bonds, ester-based linkages, thioether linkages, amide bonds, acid-labile linkages, and Schiff base linkages. Avidin/biotin linkers, in which avidin is covalently coupled to the BBB drug transport vector, may also be used. Avidin itself may be a drug transport vector,<br>
Transcytosis, including receptor-mediated transport of compositions across the blood brain barrier, may also be suitable for the agents of the invention. Transferrin receptor-mediated delivery is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,672,683; 5,383,988; 5,527,527; 5,977,307; and 6,015,555. Transferrin-mediated transport is also known. P-M. Friden, et al, Phannacol Exp. Ther. 278,1491-98 (1996); H.J. Lee, J. Phannacol Exp. Titer. 292,1048-52 (2000). EGF receptor-mediated delivery is disclosed in Y. Deguchi, et al, Bioconjug. Chem. 10,32-37 (1999), and transcytosis is described in A. Cerletti, et al, J. Dmg Target. 8,435-46 (2000). Insulin firagments have also been used as carriers for delivery across the blood brain barrier, M. Fukuta, et al, Phann. Res. 11.1681-88 (1994). Delivery of agents via a conjugate of neutral avidin and cationized human albumin has also been described, Y.S. Kang, et al, Pharm. Res. 1, 1257-64 (1994),<br>

Nitric oxide is a vasodilator of the peripheral vasculature in normal tissue of the body. Increasing generation of nitric oxide by nitric oxide synthase causes vasodilation<br><br>
without loss of blood pressure. The blood-pressure-independent increase in blood flow through brain tissue increases cerebral bioavailability of blood-bom compositions. This increase in nitric oxide may be stimulated by administering L-arginine. As nitric oxide is increased, cerebral blood flow is consequently increased, and drugs in the blood stream are carried along with the increased flow into brain tissue. Therefore, L-arginine may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention to enhance delivery of agents to brain tissue after introducing a pharmaceutical composition into the blood stream of the subject substantially contemporaneously with a blood flow enhancing amount of L-arginine, as described in WO 00/56328.<br>

In general, it is well within the ordinary skill in the art to prepare an ester, amide or hydrazide derivative of an agent of the invention, for example, from the corresponding carboxylic acid and a suitable reagent For instance, a carboxylic acid-containing compound, or a reactive equivalent thereof may be reacted with a hydroxyl-containing compound, or a reactive equivalent thereof, so as to provide the corresponding ester. See, e.g., "Comprehensive Organic Transformations," 2nd Ed., by RC. Larock, VCH Publishers John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. (199989); "March's Advanced Organic Chemistry," 5th Ed., by M.B. Smith and J. Marcli, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. (2000).<br>
Prodrugs<br>
The present invention is also related to prodrugs of the agents of the Formulae disclosed herein. Prodrugs are agents which are converted in vivo to active forms {see, eg., R.B. Silverman, 1992, "The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action," Academic Press, Chp. 8). Prodrugs can be used to alter the biodistribution (e.g., to allow agents which would not typically enter the reactive site of the protease) or the pharmacokinetics for a particular agent For example, a caiboxylic acid group, can be esterified, e.g., with a methyl group or an ethyl group to yield an ester. When the ester is administered to a subject, the ester is cleaved, enzymatically or non-enzymatically, reductively, oxidatively, or hydrolytically, to reveal the amonic group. An anionic group can be esterified with moieties (eg., acyloxymethyl esters) "v^diich are cleaved to reveal an intermediate agent which subsequently decomposes to yield the active agent. The prodrug moieties maybe metabolized in vivo by esterases or by other mechanisms to carboxyUc acids.<br>
Examples of prodrugs and their uses are well known in the art {see, e.g,, Berge, et al, "Pharmaceutical Salts", J.Phann. Sci. 66,1-19 (1977)), The prodrugs can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the agents, or by separately reacting the purified agent in its free acid form with a suitable derivatizing agent Caiboxylic acids can be converted into esters via treatment with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst<br>
Examples of cleavable caiboxylic acid prodrug moieties include substituted and unsubstituted, branched or unbranched lower alkyl ester moieties, (e.g;, ethyl esters, propyl esters, butyl esters, pentyl esters, cyclopentyl esters, hexyl esters, cyclohexyl esters), lower alkenyl esters, dilower alkyl-amino lower-alkyl esters {e,g., dimethylaminoethyl ester), acylamino lower alkyl esters, acyloxy lower alkyl esters (eg-, pivaloyloxymethyl ester), aryl esters (phenyl ester), aiyl-lower alkyl esters {e.g, benzyl ester), substituted (e.g., with methyl, halo, or methoxy substituents) aryl and<br><br>
aryl-ower alkyl esters, amides, lower-alkyl amides, dilower alkyl amides, and hydroxy amides.<br>
Pharmaceuticallv Acceptable Salts<br>
Certain embodiments of the present agents can contain a basic functional group, such as amino or alkylamino, and are, thus, capable of forming phaimaceutically acceptable salts with phaimaceutically acceptable acids. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" in this respect, refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of agents of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the agents of the invention, or by separately reacting a purified agent of the invention in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed,<br>
Representative salts include the hydrohalide (including hydrobromide and hydrochloride), sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, napthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, and laurylsulphonate salts and the like. See, e.g., Berge et al, 'Pharmaceutical Salts", J. Pharm. Sci 66,1-19 (1977).<br>
In other cases, the agents of the present invention may contain one or more acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming phaimaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutically acceptable bases. The term 'phaimaceutically acceptable salts" in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic base addition salts of agents of the present invention.<br>
These salts can likewise be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the agents, or by separately reacting the purified agent in its firee acid fonn with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine and the like.<br>
'Thannaceutically acceptable salts" also includes, for example, derivatives of agents modified by making acid or base salts thereof as described further below and elsewhere in the present application. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; and alkali or<br><br>
organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids. Pharmaceutically accaptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent agent formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. Such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfarmic, phosphoric, and nitric acid; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, palmoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, silfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, tolueesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic acid, Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be synthesized from the parent agent which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts may be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these agents with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two.<br>
All acid, salt, base, and other ionic and non-ionic forms of the compounds described are included as compounds of the invention. For example, if a compound is shown as an acid herein, the salt forms of the compound are also included. Likewise, if a compound is shown as a salt, the acid and/or basic forms are also included.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, numerous equivalents to the specific procedures, embodiments, claims, and examples described herein. Such equivalents are considered to be within the scope of this invention and covered by the claims appended hereto. The contents of all references, issued patents, and published patent applications cited throughout this application are hereby incorporated by reference. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which should not be construed as further limiting.<br>
Examples<br>
Binding and Antifibnillosenic Assays<br>
The test compounds were synthesized and screened by mass spectrometry ("MS") assays, except for selected compoimds which were purchased from a commercial source. The MS assay gives data on the ability of compounds to bind to proteins, in this example, to β-amyloid and lAPP.<br>
In the MS assay for Ap40, samples were prepared as aqueous solutions (adding 20% ethanol if necessary to solubilize in water), 200 µM of a test compound and 20 µM of solubilized AP40, or 400 µM of a test compound and 40 µM of solubilized Ap40. The pH value of each sample was adjusted to 7.4 (±0,2) by addition of 0.1% aqueous sodium<br><br>
hydroxide. The solutions were then analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a Waters ZQ 4000 mass spectrometer. Samples were introduced by direct infusion at a flow-rate of 25 µlVmin within 2 hr. after sample preparation. The source temperature was kept at 70 °C and the cone voltage was 20 V for all the analysis. Data were processed using Masslynx 3.5 software. The MS assay gives data on the ability of compounds to bind to soluble Ap, whereas the ThT, EM and CD assays give data on inhibition of fibrillogenesis. The results from the assay for binding to Ap are summarized in Table 3. In Table 3, a blank box means that a value was not determined for that compound in that assay.<br>
The assay for lAPP was conducted under the same conditions except that 200 µM of test compound and 20 µM of solubilized lAPP were employed.  The key below describes the codes used in Table 3 to quantify the binding based on the intensity of the absorption.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Transgenic mice, TgCRNDS, expressing the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) develop a pathology resembling Alzheimer's disease. In particular, high levels of AP40 and Ap42 have been documented in the plasma and the brain of these animals at 8-9 weeks of age, followed by early accumulation of amyloid plaques similar to the senile plaques observed in AD patients. These animals also display progressive cognitive deficits that parallel the appearance of degbnerative changes. See, e.g., (Chishti, et al J. Biol Chem. 276,21562-70 (2001).<br>
The short term therapeutic effect of 19 compounds of the invention was studied. These compounds were administered over a 14 or 28 day period at the end of which the levels of Ap peptides in the plasma and brain of TgCRNDS animals were determined.<br>
Methods<br>
Male and female transgenic mice from the 3rd and 4th B6C3F1 generations were used in this example and given daily subcutaneous or oral administrations of one of a<br><br>
series of compounds for 14 or 28 days. The following abbreviations are used to designate these animals from the 3rd and 4th generation backcross in the present protocol: TgCRND8-2.B6C3Fl(N3); TgCRND8-2.B6C3Fl(N4).<br>
Baseline animals (Group 1) consisted of naive TgCRND8-2. B6C3F1(N3) at 11 ±1 weeks of age. These mice were used to detemine the Aβ levels in the plasma and brain of naive transgenic animals at the initiation of treatment<br>
Starting at 11 weeks of age (±1 week) animals received daily administration of their respective treatment for a period of 14 or 28 days (groups 2-21), at a dose of 250 mg/kg at 10 ml/kg or of vehicle only (water, group 2) or 1% methyl cellulose only (group 21). The route of administration was subcutaneous for water-soluble compounds and oral for compounds solubilized in methylcellulose 1% (MC 1%). At the end of the treatment periods, plasma and perfused brains were collected for quantification of Aβ levels.<br><br><br>
The mice used in this study were derived from a breeding colony at Institut Armand Frappier, and were well-acclimated to the animal facility environment prior to initiation of the study. Animals were assigned, according to age and gender, into the following experimental groups:<br><br>
Anunal Health Monitoring<br>
All animals were examined daily for signs of ill health when handled in the morning for their daily treatment and twice a day for mortality checks (once daily during weekends and holidays). Detailed examinations were performed on the treatment initiation, weekly during the study, and once before terminal procedures. More frequent observations were undertaken when considered appropriate. Death and all individual clinical signs were individually recorded. Individual body weights were recorded at randomization, once weekly during the study, and once before terminal procedures.<br>
Sample Collection<br>
At 11 ± 1 weeks of age for the Baseline group, and at the end of the treatment<br><br>
administration animals were sacrificed and samples collected. An approximate blood volume of 500 µl was collected £rom the orbital sinus and kept on ice until centrifugation at 4°C at a minimum speed of 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Plasma samples were immediately fix)zen and stored at -80 °C pending analysis. The brains were removed, frozen, and stored at -80°C awaiting analysis.<br><br><br>
Compounds were scored based on their ability to modulate levels of Ap peptides<br>
in the plasma and the cerebral soluble/insoluble levels in the brain. Levels of Aβ<br>
observed in the plasma and brain of treated animals were normalized using values from<br>
vehicle-treated (water) or methylcellulose-treated control groups and ranked according<br>
to the strength of the pharmacological effect Results are shown in Tables 3 to 11.<br>
Increases in the levels of Aβ peptides are indicated using " + " symbols, while decreases<br>
in the levels of Ap peptides are indicated using " - " symbols. The strongest effects are<br>
recorded as "-H-+" or "	" while the weakest are shown as " + " or"-".<br>
Specifically, increases in the levels of Ap (relative to untreated control) of 20 to 39% are scored as "+"; increases of 40 to 69% are scored as **++"; and increases of 70% or highler are scored as "+ -f +", Deoreases in the levels of Ap of 5 to 19% are scored as "-"; decreases of 20 to 38% are scored as "- -"; and deoreases of 39% or more are scored<br>
as — .<br>
The data are presented in Tables 6-11. Treatment with these compounds after 14 and/or 28 days resulted in a significant change in the cerebral levels of AiS40 and/or Aβ342 (Tables 8-11). Furthermore, treatment with these compounds, for instance. Compound BX (3-(t-butyl)amino-l-propanesulfonic acid), resulted after 14 and 28 days (Tables 6-7) in a significant increase in the levels of Aβ peptides in the plasma. This suggests that some of diese compounds may act by a penpheral sink effect, sequestering Ap peptides in the plasma and thereby facilitating their clearance from the CNS as previously suggested for treatment by passive immunization using anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody m266 (DeMattos et al. Science 295(5563):2264-7),<br>
The tables show levels of Aβ peptides in the plasma and brain of TgCRND8 mice treated for 14 and 28 days with compounds of the invention.<br>

Effects Of Long Term Treatment In Adult Transgenic CRND8 Mice 0verexpressing BAPP<br>
Transgenic mice, TgCRND8, as those used in the short term treatment, overexpress a human APP gene with the Swedish and Indiana mutations leading to the production of high levels of the amyloid peptides and to the development of an early-onset, aggressive development of brain amyloidosis. The high levels of Aβ peptides and the relative overabundance of Aβ42 compared to KΒAQ are believed to be associated with the severe and early degenerative pathology observed. The pattern of amyloid deposition, presence of dystrophic neuritis, and cognitive deficit has been well documented in this transgenic mouse line. The levels of Aβ peptides in the brain of these mice increase dramatically as the animals age. While the total amyloid peptide levels increase from - 1.6 x 105 pg/g of brain to - 3.8 x 106 between 9 and 17 weeks of age.<br>
While the early deposition of amyloid in this model allows the rapid testing of compounds in a relatively short time frame, the aggressivity of this model and the high levels of Aβ peptides renders therapeutic assessment in the longer term a more difficult task.<br>
The long-term therapeutic effects of compounds of the present invention on cerbral amyloid deposition and β-amyloid (Aβ) levels in the plasma and in the brains of transgenic mice, TgCRNDS, expressing the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) was studied. These compounds were administered over an 8 or 16 week period at the end of which the levels of Aβ peptides in the plasma and brain of TgCRNDS animals were determined. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the compounds at modulating the progression of the amyloidogenic process in the brain and in the plasma of a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD)<br><br>
Methods<br>
The mice used in the study consisted of animals bearing one copy of the hAl*P<br>
gene (+/-) from the 2rd and 3rd generation progenies (No and N3) dcnved from<br>
backcrosses from TgCRNDS.FVB(N2)AJ(N3) with B6AF1/J hybrid anunals.<br>
N1 -	TgCRND8.FVB(N2)AJ(N3)      x       B6AF1/J<br>
N2=	TgCRND8.FVB(N2)AJ(N3).B6AFl/J(Ni)     x     H(.AFl/J<br>
N3 =	TgCRND8.FVB(N2).AI(N3).B6AFl/J(N:;)<br>
B6AF1/J<br>
The following abbreviations are used to designate these animals in the preasent study: TgCRND8.B6AFl/J(N2); TgCRND8.B6AFl/J(N3)- Male and female traanspenic mice were given daily subcutaneous (compound BX) or oral (compounds BW and HZ) administrations of the appropriate compounds for 8 or 16 weeks.<br>
Baseline animals consisted of 9 ± 1 week old naive TgCRND8.B6AFl /J anunals from the 2" and 3rd generations. These mice were used to determine the extent oi cerebral amyloid deposits and A/3 levels in the plasma and brain of naive transgenic animals at the initiation of treatment.<br>
Starting at 9 weeks of age (±1 week) animals received daily administration of their respective treatment for a period of 8 or 16 weeks, at a dose of 30 or 1 ()() mg/ku al 10 ml/kg. The route of administration was subcutaneous for water-sohuble compounds (Compound BX) and oral for compounds solubilized in methylcelllulose 1% (MC I'/o) (Compounds BW and BZ). At the end of the treatment periods, plasma and perfused brains were collected for quantification of Aβ levels.<br>
Animal health was monitored, samples were collected and A/3 levels were measured as described above in the short term treatment study. Compounds were scored based on their ability to modulate levels of Aβ peptides in the plasma and the cerebral soluble/insoluble levels in the brain. Levels of Aβ observed in the plasma and brain of treated animals were compared to that of vehicle-treated (water) or methylcellulose' treated control groups and ranked according to the strength of the pharmacological effect. Results are shovvjn in Table 12. Increases in the levels of A/3 peptides are indicated using "+" symbols, while decreases in the levels of Aβ peptides are indicated using "-" symbols. The strongest effects are recorded as "+++" or'—" while the weakest are shown as "+" or "-".<br>
Specifically, increases in the levels of A/3 (relative to untreated control) of 5 to 14% are scored as "+"; increases of 15 to 29% are scored as "+4 "; mid increases ol :30)% or higher are scored as "+'-f +". Decreases in the levels of Aβ of 5 to 14% are scored as "-"; decreases of 15 to 29% are scored as "- -"; and decreases of 30%. or more arc scored as "—". Additionally, changes of 4% or less in either direction are scored as "O"<br><br>
Table 12 shows levels of A)3 peptides in the plasma and brain of TgCRND8 mice treated for 8 and 16 weeks with compounds of the invention. Treatment with these compounds after 8 and/or 16 weeks in many cases resulted in a change in the levels of Aβ4o and/or Aβ42 in the plasma and/or brain. For example, administration of compound BX generally resulted in a dramatic decrease m the amount of A/3 m the brain at both 8 and 16 weeks. Compound BW also resulted in a dramatic decrease in bram and plasma levels of Aβ at 8 weeks and plasma levels at 16 weeks. Additionally, preliminary histochemical experiments using ThioS staining of brain sections indicated that both the nmnber of plaques and the area occupied by the plaques were decreased in mice treated with 30 mg/kg of compound BX.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 11:        Evaluation of Compounds Binding to NAC Peptide by Mass Spectrometry<br>
Recent findings have demonstrated that a high percentage of Alzheimer Disease<br>
(AD) patients also form Lewy bodies, most abundantly in the amygdala (Hamilton.<br>
2000, Brain Pathol, 10:378; Mukaetova-Ladinska,et al. 2000. J Neuropathol Exp<br>
Neurol 59:408). Interestingly, the highly hydrophobic non-amyloid component (NAC)<br><br>
region of aα-synuclein has also been described as the second most abundant component of amyloid plaques in the brain of AD patients, after. Alpha-synuclein has been shown to form fibrils in vitro. Futhermore it binds to Ap and promotes its aggregation (Yoshimoto, et al. 1995, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92:9141). It was in fact originally identified as the precursor of the non-amyloid beta (Ap) component (NAD) of AD plaques (Ueda, et al 1993. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90:11282; Iwai. 2000. Biochem Biophys Acta 1502:95; Masliah, et al, 1996, Am J Pathol 148:201). NAC is a 35 amino acid long peptide with highly hydrophobic stretches which can self-aggregate and form fibrils in vitro. Moreover, these fibrils can efficiently seed the formation of Ap fibrils in vitro (Han, et al. 1995. Chem Biol.2: 163-169; Iwai, et al. 1995. Biochemistry 34:10139). It is in fact through its NAC domain that alpha-synuclein retains its fibrillogenic properties. Modulating the properties of NAC or targeting NAC with the compounds of the invention could therefore be a valid therapeutic avenue to inhibit the formation of protein aggregates and inclusions associated with alpha-synucleopathies, as well as the formation of aggregates between the beta-amyloid peptide and NAC of alpha-synuclein.<br>
The ability of the compounds of the present invention to bind to NAC peptide in aqueous solution was evaluated.  The binding ability correlates to the intensities of the peptide-compound complex peaks observed by the Electrospray Mass Spectrum. Millipore distilled deionized water was used to prepare all aqueous solutions. For pH determination a Beckman 36 pH meter fitted with a Coming Semi-Micro Combination pH Electrode was employed.<br>
NAC (MW 3260.6 Da) at 20µM was first analyzed at pH 7,40 and the usual sodium clusters was observed at +2, +3 and +4 at m/z 1335.5,1116.7 and 843.4 respectively. The optimal cone voltage was determined to be 20V-<br>
Mass spectrometry- Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using a Waters ZQ 4000 mass spectrometer equipped with a Waters 2795 sample manager. MassLynx 4.0 (earlier by MassLynx 3.5) was used for data processing and analysis. Test compounds were mixed with disaggregated peptides in aqueous media (6.6% EtOH) at a 5:1 ratio (20 µM NAC: 100 µM of test compound or 40 µM NAC: 200 µM of test compound). The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 7.4 (±0.2) using 0.1% NaOH (3-5 µL). Periodically, NAC peptide solution at 20 µM or 40 µM was also prepared in the same fashion and run as control. The spectra were obtained by introducing the solutions to the electrospray source by direct infusion using a syringe pump at a flow rate of 25 µl/min, and scanning from 100 to 2100 Da in the positive mode. The scan time was 0.9 sec per scan with an inter-scan delay of 0.1 sec and the run time was 5 min for each sample. All the mass spectra were sum of 300 scans. The desolvation and source<br><br>
temperature was 70°C and the cone and capillary voltage were maintained at 20 V and 3.2 kV respectively.<br>
The total area under the peaks for the bound NAC-compound complex divided by total area under the peaks for unbound NAC was determined for each compound tested. The results are summarized in Table 13 below<br><br>
The present invention also relates to novel compounds and the synthesis thereof. Accordingly, the following examples are presented to illustrate how some of those compounds may be prepared.<br><br>
