				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-l-(aryl methyl) isoquinolines. This invention particularly relates to an improved process for the production of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8- hexahydro-l-(4-methoxy phenyl/phenyl methyl) isoquino lines of formula (2) wherein R is H or methoxy group. Dextromethorphan is an important and efficient anti-tussive drug of the present time.lt is prepared from an intermediate N-2-(l'-cyclohexenyl)ethyl-4-methoxy phenyl methyl acetamide (la) wherein R is methoxy group. .The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8- hexahydro-l-(4-methoxyphenyl/phenyl methyl) isoquinolines (2) from N-2-(l'-cyclohexenyl)ethyl-4-methoxy- phenyl/phenyl acetamides (1) particularly using Lewis acids like AlCls and ZnCl2, more particularly using anhydrous aluminium chloride and potassium iodide in a solvent .The compound (2) is one of the important intermediates for the production of dextromethorphan (3-methoxy,17- methyl (9α,13α, 14α ,morphinan) and its analogues.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The literature on the cyclization of N-2-(l'-cyclohexenyl)ethyl-4-methoxy phenyl acetamide (la) to 3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-l-(4-methoxy phenyl methyl) isoquinoline (2a) is scanty .The following are the references so far available in the literature .<br>
Hitherto 3,4,5,6,7,8- hexahydro-l-(4-methoxyphenylmethyl)- isoquinoline ( 2a) has been prepared by the methods described below :<br>
By cyclodehydration of amide (1) with phosphorous oxychloride (Tet. Lett,28,(41),pp- 4829 -32,1987).<br>
According to the method disclosed in this paper, the amide(l) is allowed to react with phosphorous oxycholoride in benzene in its reflux temperature .The drawback of the method is that heating is essential and benzene, a health hazard is used as solvent along with phosphorous oxychloride .The yield of (2) is also not mentioned in the reference.<br>
By cyclodehyd rat ion of amide (l)with phosphorous pentoxide( Helv .Chim. Acta. 33, pp 1437-1448 ,1950 ;ibid, 34,2211,1951)<br>
In this reported cyclization process the amide (1) is treated with phosphorous pentoxide in warm benzene .After completion of the reaction ,the reaction mixture is treated with ice and made strongly alkaline and extracted with ether and worked-up. The drawback of the method is that phosphorous pentoxide being very much hygroscopic and corrosive chemical has to be handled with outmost caution and also the solvent benzene is a health hazard . The yield of the process is 78% only . In this process several side products are also formed which are difficult to account for.<br>
By cycloaddition of amide (1) with phosphorous oxychloride ( US Patent,4270000, May 16, 1981 and U S Patent, 5892,044, April 6,1994 ).<br>
US database patent search revealed that according to the methods described in the above two patents the amide (1) is allowed to react with phosphorous oxychloride in a solvent and the mixture is heated at the reflux temperature of the solvent (toluene). The drawbacks of the process are same with those described in methods 1 and 2 above.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of 3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-l-(aryl methyl) isoquinolines.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for cyclization of N-2-(l'-cyclohexenyl )ethyl-4-methoxyphenyl acetamide (la) to 3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-l-(4-methoxyphenylmethyl)<br>
isoquinoline (2a).<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide cyclization of N-2-(l'-cyclohexen-yl )ethyl-4-methoxy phenyl acetamide (la) to3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-l-(4-methoxyphenylmethyl) isoquinoline (2a) by elimiminating the use of benzene as solvent.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the production of 3,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-l-(arylmethyl) isoquinolines of formula (2) wherein R is H or methoxy, shown in the drawing accompanying this specification which comprises stirring N-2-[l'- cyclohexenyl] ethyl-aryl autamide of formula (1) wherein R is H or methoxy group in an organic solvent with a Lewis acid and potassium halide at a temperature in the range of 0 to 80 °C, for a period in the range of 4-12 hours, removing the solvent by distillation under reduced pressure ,treating the above said reaction mixture with ammonia solution, extracting the product using a water immiscible organic solvent, washing the organic layer with sodium thiosulphate solution ,and removing the solvent under reduced pressure to get compound of formula (2).<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
