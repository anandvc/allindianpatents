				<td>Background <br>
The present invention relates to bicyclic[3.1.0] heteroaryl amides and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, cognitive disorders, schizophrenia, dementia and other disorders in mammals, including humans. These compounds exhibit activity as inhibitors of the glycine type 1 transporter.<br>
Schizophrenia, a progressive neurological disease, is manifested in its early stages as thought disorders such as hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and bizarre thought patterns, collectively known as positive symptoms. These easily recognizable symptoms gave the disease the historical name "madness". As the disease progresses, negative symptoms, such as social withdrawal and anhedonia, and cognitive symptoms such as dementia become . more apparent. Only about one-third of schizophrenic patients can be treated successfully and returned to society, while the remainder is generally .institutionalized. The burden on society of this devastating illness and the toll it takes on family members of affected patients make it one of the most costly of all CNS diseases.<br>
Pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia has traditionally involved blockade of the dopamine system, which is thought to be responsible for its positive symptoms. Such treatment, however, ignores the negative and cognitive aspects  of the disease. Another neurotransmitter system believed to play a role in schizophrenia is the glutamate system, the major excitatory transmitter system in the brain. This hypothesis is based on the observation that blockade of the glutamate system by compounds such as PCP ("angel dust") can replicate many of the symptoms of schizophrenia, including its positive, negative, and cognitive aspects. If schizophrenia involves a deficit of glutamatergic transmission, . augmentation, of the glutamate system, and specifically the NMDA receptor, may be beneficial. While glutamate is the principle agonist at NMDA receptors, glycine is required as a co-agonist to set the "tone" of the receptor for its response to glutamate. Enhancing this "tone" by increasing the effect of glycine would augment NMDA neurotransmission, and n provide potential benefit in the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
A specific mechanism for augmenting the glycinergic "tone" of the NMDA receptor was disclosed recently by Bergeron, et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 95, 15730," (1998)}, which is hereby incorporated by reference. This group showed that a specific and potent inhibitor of the glycine type-1 transporter (
antagonist. Even though glycine levels in the brain are high relative to the amount required to act as an NMDA receptor co-agonist, this work shows that GlyT1 removes glycine efficiently at the synapse, and that inhibition of GlyT1 can augment NMDA receptor function. The present invention provides GlyT1 inhibitors as a treatment for disorders or conditions such as schizophrenia through its augmentation of glutamatergic neurotransmission.<br>

In another aspect of this invention, the compound of Formula I has the following structure:<br><br>
wherein R -R , Q, Z, Y and A are as defined above,.<br>
Specific embodiments of the present invention are shown in the Examples below.<br>
Compounds of the Formula I may have optical centers and therefore may occur in different enantiomeric and diastereomeric configurations. The present invention includes all enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomers of such compounds of the Formula I, <br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
as well as racemic compounds and racemic mixtures and other mixtures of stereoisomers thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula I include the acid addition and base salts thereof.<br>
Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts. Examples include, but are not limited to, the acetate, adipate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulphate/sulphate, borate, camsylate, citrate, cyclamate, edisylate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mandelates mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, pyroglutamate, salicylate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, sulfonate, stannate, tartrate, tosylate, trifluoroacetate and xinofoate salts.<br>
Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include, but are not limited to, the aluminium, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts.<br>
Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts.<br>
For a review on suitable salts, see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, 2002).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by one or more of three methods:<br>
(i)         by reacting the compound of Formula I with the desired acid or base; (ii)        by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the compound of Formula I or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a lactone or lactam, using the desired acid or base; or<br>
(Hi) by converting one salt of the compound of Formula I to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column.<br>
All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionization in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.<br>
The compounds of the invention may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term 'amorphous1 refers to a state in which the material lacks long range order at the molecular level and, depending upon temperature, may exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give distinctive X-ray diffraction patterns and, while exhibiting the properties of a solid, are more formally described as a liquid. Upon heating, a change from solid to liquid properties occurs which is characterised by a change of state, typically second order ('glass transition'). The term 'crystalline' refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X-ray diffraction pattern with defined peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid, but the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change, typically first order ('melting point').<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. The term 'solvate' is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term 'hydrate' is employed when said solvent is water.<br>
A currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates - see Polymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids by K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995). Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules lie In lattice<br>
channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal-ion coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion.<br>
When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichidmetry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in a mesomorphic state (mesophase or liquid crystal) when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state (either melt or solution). Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature Is described as 'thermotropic' and that resulting from the addition of a second component, such as water or another solvent, is described as 'lyotropic1. Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as 'amphiphilic1 and consist of molecules which possess an ionic (such as -COO'Na'+', -COO'K+, or -SO3~Na+) or non-ionic (such as -N"ls+(CH3)3) polar head group. For more information, see Crystals and the Polarizing Microscope by N. H. Hartshorne and A. Stuart, 4th Edition (Edward Arnold, 1970).<br>
Hereinafter all references to compounds of Formula I include references to salts, solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals thereof and to solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals of salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the invention include compounds of Formula I as hereinbefore defined, including all polymorphs and crystal habits thereof, prodrugs and isomers thereof (including optical, geometric and tautomeric Isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labeled Compounds of Formula1.<br>
As Indicated, so-called 'prodrugs' of the compounds of Formula I are also within the scope of the invention. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of Formula I which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of Formula I having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as 'prodrugs1. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and W. Stella) and Bioreversibie Carriers in Drug Design, Pergamon Press, 1987 (Ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).<br>
Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of Formula I with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-moieties' as described, for example, in Design of Prodrugs by H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).<br>
10<br>
Some examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
(i)        where the compound of Formula I contains a carboxylic acid functionality (-COOH), an ester thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the carboxyiic acid functionality of the compound of Formula (I) is replaced by (CrC8)alkyl;<br>
(ii) where the compound of Formula I contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), an ether thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the compound of Formula I is replaced by (C1-C6 alkanoyloxymethyl; and<br>
(iii) where the compound of Formula I contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (-NH2 or -NHR where R # H), an amide thereof, for example, a compound wherein, as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of Formula I is/are replaced by (C1-C10)alkanoyl.<br>
Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.<br>
Moreover, certain compounds of Formula I may themselves act as prodrugs of, other compounds of Formula I.<br>
Also included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of Formula I, that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
(I) where the compound of Formula I contains a methyl group, an hydroxymethyl derivative thereof (-CH3 -&gt; -CH2OH):<br>
(ii) where the compound of Formula I contains an alkoxy group, an hydroxy derivative thereof (-OR -&gt; -OH);<br>
(iii) where the compound of Formula I contains a tertiary amino group, a secondary amino derivative thereof (-NR1R2 -&gt; -NHR1 or -NHR2);<br>
(iv) where the compound of Formula I contains a secondary amino group, a primary derivative thereof (-NHR1 -&gt; -NH2);<br>
(v) where the compound of Formula I contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol derivative thereof (-Ph-&gt;-PhOH); and<br>
(vi) where the compound of Formula I contains an amide group, a carboxylic acid derivative thereof (-CONH2 -&gt; COOH).<br>
Compounds of Formula I containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of Formula I contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric els/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism ('tautomerism') can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of Formula I containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compoundswhich contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, an0 mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, d-lactate or /-lysine, or racemic, for example, dl-tartrate or dl-arginine.<br>
Cls/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallisation.<br>
Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). -<br>
Alternatively, the racemate or racemic mixture (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of Formula I contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.<br>
Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.<br>
When any racemate crystallises, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type Is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.<br>
While both of the crystal forms present in a racemic mixture have identical physical properties, they may have different physical properties compared to the true racemate. Racemic mixtures may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art - see, for example, Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, 1994).<br>
The present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the sameatomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature.<br>
Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon, such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as 36CI, fluorine, such as 1BF, iodine, such as 123I and 125I, nitrogen, such as 13N and 16N, oxygen, such as 16O, 17O and 18O, phosphorus, such as 32P, and sulphur, such as35S.<br>
Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful In drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.<br>
Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, I.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.<br>
Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 16O and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.<br>
Isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.<br>
Pharmaceutlcally acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, d8-acetone, d6-DMSO.<br>
When preparing compounds of Formula I in accordance with the invention, it is open to a person skilled in the art to routinely select the form of compound of Formula II which provides the best combination of features for this purpose. Such features include, but are not limited to, the melting point, solubility, processability and yield of the intermediate form and the resulting ease with which the product may be purified on isolation.<br>

The compounds of the present invention exhibit glycine transport inhibiting activity and therefore are of value in the treatment of a wide variety of clinical conditions that are characterized by the deficit of glutamateric neurotransmission in mammalian subjects, especially humans. Such conditions include the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychoses, and cognitive deficits.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be administered via either the oral, parenteral (such as subcutaneous, intraveneous, intramuscular, intrasternal and infusion techniques), rectal, intranasal or topical routes to mammals. In general, these compounds are most desirablyadministered to humans in doses ranging from about 1mg to about 2000 mg per day, although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. However, a dosage level that is in the range of from about 0.1 mg to about 20 mg per kg of body weight per day is most desirably employed. Nevertheless, variations may still occur depending upon the species of animal being treated and its individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out. In some Instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than. adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effects provided that such higher dose levels are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.<br>

General procedure for the reductive alkylation preparation of compounds of Formula IX To a stirring solution of 1.0 equiv. of a compound of formula (VIII) in 1,2-dichloroethane (0.1 M) at room temperature was added the appropriately substituted aldehyde or ketone reagent (1.0-1.5 equiv.), and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (2.0 equiv.). The reaction mixtures were stirred at room temperature for up to 24 hours. The mixtures were then quenched by the addition of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted with methylene chloride. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous MgS04 and concentrated under reduced pressure. If needed, the resulting crude material was purified by flash chromatography with 4% MeOH/CH2CI2. The product containing fractions were collected and concentrated to yield the desired tertiary amines in 70-95 % yield.<br>
The following compounds were made using the above procedure of Example 12, starting with the appropriate starting amine of formula (VIII) and the appropriate aldehyde or ketone reagent.<br>
Furthermore, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds listed below can be prepared as follows. To a stirring solution of compounds of the general formula (IX) (prepared as described above in Example 1 and Example 12,1.0 equiv.) in a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate, dioxane, diethyl ether, methyl ethyl ketone, methylene chloride/methanol (1:1) or methanol (0.1 M) at room temperature was added the appropriate acid, such as hydrochloric acid, citric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methansulfonic acid or benzene sulfonic acid (2-3 equiv) in one portion. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for up to 18 hours, then concentrated under reduced -prcssure-to-afford-the-desired-salts. <br>

To a stirring solution of 6-{[(1-Methyl-1H-imidazole-4-carbonyl)-(3-trifluoromethoxy-benzyl)-amino]-methyl}-3-aza-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-3-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester prepared above (2.63 gm, 5.63 mmol) in 30 ml DMF was added potassium carbonate (3.89 gm, 28.2 mmol), tetraethylammonium chloride (150 mg), followed by benzyl 2-bromoacetate (0.88 mL, 5.63 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 20 hours and quenched with water. The mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, the layers separated and the aqueous layer extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to yield 2.8 gm of crude material. The crude material was purified by flash chromatography to yield 2.7 gm of benzyl 2-(6-((N-(3-(trifluoromethoxy)benzyl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamido)methyl)-3-aza-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-3-yl)acetate; MS (M+M) 543.3.<br>

To a par bottle charged with benzyl 2-(6-((N-(3-(trifluoromethoxy)benzyl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamido)methyl)-3-aza-bicyclo[3.1.0Jhexan-3-yl)acetate (2.7 gm, 5.07 mmol) in 80 mL CH3OH, was added 300 mg palladium hydroxide on carbon (20%). The mixture was hydrogenated under 40 psi H2 at room temperature for 1 hour. The mixture was filtered over a celite, the celite pad was washed with CH3OH and the resulting solution was concentrated to yield 2.3 gm of 2-(6-((N-(3-(trifluoromethoxy)benzyl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamido)methyl)-3-aza-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-3-yl)acetic acid as a yellow solid; 400 MHz 1H NMR (CDCI3) 5 7.54 (s, -1H), 7.23-J33 (m, 3H), 7.15 (s, 1H), 7.05 (d, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H), 5.4 (brs, 2H), 4.81 (brs, 1H), 3.96 (brs, 1H), 3.68 (s, 3H), 3.49 (s, 2H), 3.28 (brs, 1H), 3.12 <brs ms></brs>
General Procedure for Amide Couplings<br>
A solution of 2-(6-((N-(3-(trifluoromethoxy)benzyl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamido)methyl)-3-aza-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-3-yl)acetic acid prepared above (1.0 equiv.) in 1,2-dichloroethane/triethylamine/dimethylformamide solution was added to the amines (1.9 equiv.), followed by HBTU (2.1 equiv). The reactions stirred at room temperature overnight, quenched with 1N NaOH and extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers were dried and concentrated to yield the crude amides that were further purified by flash chromatography or HPLC.<br>
Alternatively, amides could be prepared by utilizing a parallel library synthesis procedure as described below.Two dram vials were charged with amines (0.075 mmole, 1.875 eq.). 2-(6-((N-(3-(trlfluoromethoxy)benzyl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamido)methyl)-3-aza-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-3-yl)acetic acid was taken up in DCE/TEA/DMF (500/14/100) and was added as a cloudy suspension (0.04 mmol., 18.1 mg, 1.0 eq. per 0.614 ml DCE/TEA/DMF, 1.0 eq. DIEA). Add HBTU (31.3 mg, 0.0825 mmol, 2.06 eq) dissolved in 0.2 ml of DMF. Shake at room temperature overnight. Aliquot samples for LC MS analysis. Add 1.5 ml 1 N NaOH and 2.5 ml DCM. Vortex and remove the organic layer and load onto a SCX SPE (6ml, 1g, Silicycle brand). Repeat extraction 2 times. Elute SCX SPE with 5 ml DCM, then 5 ml MeOH. Switch to tarred collection vials and elute with 1 N TEA in MeOH (7.5 ml). Dry down. Weigh and prepare TFA salt (15/485 TFA/DCM). Dry down. Purification by HPLC/MS.<br>
