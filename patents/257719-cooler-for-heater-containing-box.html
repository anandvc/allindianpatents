				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COOLER FOR HEATER- CONTAINING BOX<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a box-like structure which is<br>
installed outdoor, the box having precision equipment which has a heating<br>
element such as an electronic component therein and requires cooling even<br>
in winter because of high heat generation, and whose performance and life<br>
are greatly affected by temperature. In particular, the present invention<br>
relates to a cooling device for the box.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, high performance of electronic components and<br>
densification of the electronic components with respect to a control board<br>
have been advanced, and an amount of heat generated from the control<br>
board is being dramatically increased. With this increase, the temperature<br>
within the box is likely to increase so that guarantee of operation of the<br>
electronic components provided on the control board and the product life are<br>
greatly affected by temperature within the box. Therefore, reliability is<br>
becoming difficult to be assured unless the temperature within the box is<br>
cooled down to a certain temperature or lower.<br>
As described in, for example, Unexamined Japanese Patent<br>
Publication No. 2001-156478, a cooler for heater-containing box which cools<br>
down such type of box by air heat exchanging has been conventionally<br>
known to be installed on an outer surface of the box.<br>
1<br><br>
Hereinafter, referring to FIG. 23, the conventional cooler for heater-<br>
containing box will be described.<br>
As shown in FIG. 23, the cooler for heater-containing box has, within<br>
box 301 inside air path 305 that takes the air of the cooler for heater-<br>
containing box via inside air suction port 302 and returns it to the box!<br>
outside air path 309 that takes the outside air via outside air suction port<br>
306 and exhausts it via outside air blowout port 308; and diaphragm 310<br>
placed to separate these two air paths 305 and 309. Moreover, outside air<br>
fan 303B for conveying air in outside air path 309 is arranged such that the<br>
rotating shaft of the fan is perpendicular to the air intake direction via<br>
outside air suction port 306, and inside air fan 303A for conveying air in<br>
inside air path 305 is arranged such that the rotating shaft of the fan is<br>
perpendicular to the air intake direction via inside air suction port 302.<br>
Heat exchanger 304, which is arranged at the intersection of the air paths<br>
and exchanges sensible heat of the outside air and the inside air, is further<br>
included. Box 301 is installed outside of a panel of the box containing<br>
heating element, and cools down the box containing heating element.<br>
In such conventional cooler for heater-containing box, since the<br>
rotating shaft of the fan is perpendicular to the air inlet direction, the<br>
dimension (hereinafter referred to as depth) of the cooler for heater-<br>
containing box, which is in the perpendicular direction to the panel of the<br>
box containing heating element, is restricted by the fan diameter. Thus,<br>
the conventional cooler for heater-containing box has a problem of larger<br>
size, and is required to be thinner.<br>
In addition, since one inside air fan and one outside air fan are<br>
2<br><br>
provided, the cooling device cannot function at all when the inside air fan or<br>
the outside air fan is broken. Therefore, it is required that the cooling<br>
device work even at the breakage of the fan.<br>
Furthermore, due to the complicated configuration, there are<br>
problems of complicated manufacturing, maintenance and construction.<br>
Therefore, it is required that the configuration be simple and the<br>
manufacturing, maintenance and construction be easily achieved.<br>
Moreover, as described in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No. 2004-286419, the conventional counter-current heat exchanger used in<br>
the conventional cooler for heater-containing box is a heat exchanger in<br>
which first heat transfer plate 101 and second heat transfer plate 102,<br>
which are machined by vacuum-molding of polystyrene sheet, are<br>
alternately stacked.<br>
Hereinafter, referring to FIG. 22, the heat exchanger will be<br>
described.<br>
First heat transfer plate 101 and second heat transfer plate 102<br>
have a rectangular plane shape, and are obtained by being formed by the<br>
vacuum-molding of polystyrene sheet and thereafter cutting extra sheet by a<br>
Thomson die or the like. First heat transfer plate 101 has substantially L-<br>
shaped air path ribs 103, which are formed to be in a hollow convex shape,<br>
in substantially parallel with and at substantially equal spaces to one<br>
another. Air path ribs 103 define substantially L-shaped first air path 104<br>
and heat transfer plane 105.<br>
An outlet/inlet portion of first air path 104 is provided with air path<br>
end face 106, where the edge of first heat transfer plate 101 is bent to the<br>
3<br><br>
opposite direction to the protrusion direction of air path ribs 103. Both<br>
ends of air path rib 103 are provided with a plurality of hollow convex-<br>
shaped first protrusions 107 protruded to the same direction as the<br>
protrusion direction of air path ribs 103.<br>
Peripheral rib A (not shown), which is formed to have a hollow<br>
convex shape protruded to the same direction as the protrusion direction of<br>
air path ribs 103, is provided at the peripheral edge portion other than the<br>
inlet and outlet of first air path 104 of first heat transfer plate 101, the<br>
peripheral edge portion being sandwiched between the inlet and outlet of<br>
first air path 104 and being in substantially parallel with an air path<br>
portion serving as the counter current. Peripheral rib A108b having the<br>
same shape is provided diagonally to peripheral rib A.<br>
The outer side surfaces of peripheral rib Al08b are structured to be<br>
bent to the same position as air path end face 106.<br>
Peripheral rib B109 having the same shape is provided at the<br>
peripheral edge portion other than the inlet/outlet of first air path 104 of<br>
first heat transfer plate 101 and peripheral rib A108b. Peripheral rib<br>
B109a of peripheral rib B109 is substantially parallel with peripheral rib<br>
A108, and peripheral rib Bl09b is substantially perpendicular to peripheral<br>
rib A108.<br>
Note that an alphabetic lower letter at the end of reference numeral<br>
is applied for distinguishing from the similar reference numeral because the<br>
reference numerals denote the portions having the same function but<br>
different arrangements. It should be also noted that the reference numeral<br>
having no additional character includes a plurality of reference numerals<br>
4<br><br>
with additional character.<br>
Peripheral rib B109 has a hollow convex shape protruded to the<br>
same direction as the protrusion direction of air path ribs 103. The center<br>
portion of the outer side surface of peripheral rib B109b is bent to the same<br>
position as heat transfer plane 105 and is provided with air path opening<br>
110. The both end portions thereof are bent to the same position as air<br>
path end face 106 and is provided with air path end face cover 111.<br>
Hollow convex-shaped second protrusion 112a, which is protruded to<br>
the same direction as the protrusion direction of air path ribs 103, is<br>
provided at the portion closer to air path end face 106 of peripheral rib<br>
B109a. Second protrusion 112a is substantially perpendicular to second<br>
protrusion 112b provided on second heat transfer plate 102 located<br>
thereabove. The upper surface of second protrusion 112a is abutted against<br>
the lower surfaces of peripheral ribs B109a and 109b which are provided on<br>
second heat transfer plate 102 located thereabove.<br>
Second heat transfer plate 102 has a similarity relation to first heat<br>
transfer plate 101, and is formed such that the height of peripheral ribs<br>
A108c, 108d of second heat transfer plate 102 of the portions provided at<br>
second heat transfer plate 102 is equal to the height of air path rib 103, and<br>
moreover such that the width of peripheral ribs Al08c, 108d of second heat<br>
transfer plate 102 is wider than the width of peripheral rib A108b of first<br>
heat transfer plate 101.<br>
Air path rib 103, which is being substantially parallel with first heat<br>
transfer plate 101 and peripheral rib A108b of second heat transfer plate<br>
102, is provided with a plurality of hollow convex-shaped protrusions C113<br>
5<br><br>
protruded to the same direction to the protrusion direction of air path ribs<br>
103, or air-path-rib stack portions 114 intermittently widening the width of<br>
air path rib 103. Protrusions C113 and airpath-rib stack portions 114 at<br>
first heat transfer plate 101 and second heat transfer plate 102 are not<br>
aligned with respect to the stack direction such that the upper surface of<br>
protrusion C113 is abutted against the lower surface of air path rib 103 of<br>
second heat transfer plate 102 which is located thereabove, or the upper<br>
surface of air-path-rib stack portion 114 is abutted against the lower surface<br>
of first heat transfer plate 101 which is located thereabove.<br>
First heat transfer plates 101 and second heat transfer plates 102<br>
which are formed in the above manner are alternately stacked, first air<br>
paths 104 and second air paths 115 are alternately provided, and peripheral<br>
side surfaces are heat welded and the like, thereby constituting the heat<br>
exchanger. Heat exchange is conducted between the fluid flowing in first<br>
air path 104 and the fluid flowing in second air path 115.<br>
Such conventional heat exchanger becomes easy to be flexible as the<br>
area of the heat transfer plates increases. When the pressure subjected<br>
from the fluid flowing in air paths increases, the adjacent air path ribs fit to<br>
each other so that the air-path height may become lower and air-flow<br>
resistance may increase. Therefore, it is required to maintain the air-path<br>
height and suppress the increase in air-flow resistance.<br>
In addition, since the air-path-rib stack portion is wider than the air<br>
path rib, a portion of the airpath-rib stack portion has a narrow air-path<br>
width and the air-flow resistance increases. Therefore, it is required to<br>
suppress the increase in air-flow resistance without decreasing the air-path<br>
6<br><br>
width.<br>
Moreover, since the plurality of Lrshaped air paths formed at the<br>
rectangular heat transfer plate has different air-path lengths, the air flow in<br>
each air path is different, thereby generating the temperature difference, so-<br>
called temperature distribution, of the heat-exchanged air in each air path<br>
at the discharging portion. Therefore, the improvement of the temperature<br>
distribution is required.<br>
Particularly, when a blowout port of equipment on which the heat<br>
exchanger is mounted is close to the outlet of the heat exchanger, low-<br>
temperature air caused by the temperature distribution may be blown at<br>
low outside temperature, low air flow or the like.<br>
Moreover, when the peripheral side surfaces of the stacked heat<br>
transfer plates are heat welded, the height of the opening and the air-path<br>
height at the peripheral side may be reduced due to heat contraction.<br>
Therefore, it is required to maintain the height of the opening and the air-<br>
path height at the peripheral side, and to suppress the increase in air-flow<br>
resistance.<br>
Moreover, in order to prevent poor welding during the heat welding,<br>
the welding process needs many steps. Therefore, it is required to reduce<br>
the steps of the welding process and enhance the productivity.<br>
Moreover, burr is left at the inlet or outlet portion of the air path in<br>
cutting the extra sheet from the heat transfer plate, and the burr may cause<br>
the height of the opening at the inlet or outlet portion to be lowered and the<br>
air-flow resistance to be increased. Therefore, it is required to prevent the<br>
decrease in the height of the opening due to the burr and to suppress the<br>
7<br><br>
increase in the air-flow resistance.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cooler for heater-containing box of the present invention has: an<br>
inside air path which takes the air of the box containing heating element<br>
and circulates the air by returning it into the box containing heating<br>
element; and an outside air path which takes the outside air and exhausts it<br>
to the outside, wherein an outside air fan for conveying the air on the<br>
outside air path and an inside air fan for conveying the air on the inside air<br>
path are arranged such that the rotating shaft of each fan is in parallel with<br>
the air intake direction, a heat exchanger for exchanging sensible heat of<br>
the outside air and the inside air is arranged between the outside air path<br>
and the inside air path such that a suction port provided at a longitudinal<br>
air-path side of the heat exchanger is aligned with a blowout port of the fan,<br>
and a control unit for controlling the operation of the fans is included.<br>
According to the present invention, since the depth dimension of the<br>
cooler for heater-containing box is not restricted by the fan diameter, the<br>
cooler for heater-containing box having thin depth can be provided.<br>
Moreover, in the heat exchanger used in the cooler for heater-<br>
containing box of the present invention, an air-path-retaining-member,<br>
which is provided at the portion where the fluids flowing on the first air<br>
path and the second air path form a counter current has a curved shape in<br>
stacking the first heat transfer plate and the second heat transfer plate.<br>
With this structure, the air-path height can be maintained and the<br>
increase in the air-flow resistance can be suppressed, and thereby the heat<br>
8<br><br>
exchanger capable of suppressing the increase in the air-flow resistance<br>
without decreasing the air-path width can be obtained.<br>

Moreover, in the cooler for heater-containing box of the present<br>
invention, the blowout port of the heat exchanger may be aligned with the<br>
blowout port arranged in the box of the cooler for heater-containing box.<br>
Since there is no need to provide any space between the blowout port of the<br>
heat exchanger and the blowout port arranged in the box of the cooler for<br>
heater-containing box, the cooler for heater-containing box has an effect of<br>
having the arrangement that the depth of the cooler for heater-containing<br>
box is equal to the depth of the heat exchanger.<br>
Moreover, in the cooler for heater-containing box of the present<br>

cooler for heater-containing box has effects of enabling the heat exchanger<br>
to be easily and reliably installed to fit the guide shape, and preventing the<br>
influence of the outside air temperature to the heat exchanger by the heat<br>
insulating material.<br>
Moreover, in the cooler for heater-containing box of the present<br>
invention, a groove for wirings may be provided with the heat insulating<br>
material. By fitting the wirings into the groove at the manufacturing, the<br>
cooler for heater-containing box has an effect of ensuring the wirings which<br>

Moreover, in the cooler for heater-containing box of the present<br>
invention, an operating window may be provided at a plane with which the<br>
heat exchanger of the heat insulating material is in contact. By blocking<br>
the operating window in the assembly of the heat exchanger, the dust-proof<br>
and water-proof of the connecting portion of the connector can be achieved<br>
and the connecting operation of the wirings to the connector can be easily<br>

the same structure using the common member. In addition, the mounting<br>
portion is U-shaped so that the mounting portion is hooked to a fastening<br>
screw or the like, and thereby the cooler for heater-containing box has an<br>
effect of preventing the drop of the fans.<br>
Moreover, in the cooler for heater-containing box of the present<br>

Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
with reference to the drawings.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
Hereinafter, Embodiment 1 of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 3.<br>
FIG. 1 is an installation diagram of a cooler for heater-containing<br>
box in Embodiment 1 of the present invention. FIG. 2 is an outline view<br>
and a structural diagram at the inside of the cooler for heater-containing<br>
box in Embodiment 1 of the present invention. FIG. 3 is an outline view at<br>
the outside of the cooler for heater-containing box in Embodiment 1 of the<br>
present invention, and shows the state where a plurality of cooling devices<br>
for box containing heating element 100 are installed in the horizontal<br>
20<br><br>
direction (each figure shows that two cooling devices for box containing<br>
heating element are installed).<br>
Cooler for heater-containing box 210 is attached to door 260 of box<br>
containing heating element 200, and is structured by "door integral-type"<br>
mounting.<br>
Note that cooler for heater-containing box 210 is attached to door<br>
260 of box for containing heating element 200, but cooler for heater-<br>
containing box 210 may be externally or internally attached to door 260 or a<br>
wall surface of box for containing heating element 200.<br>
Hereinafter, the internal structure of cooler for heater-containing<br>
box 210 will be described.<br>
The air within box for containing heating element 200 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as internal air) is took into turbo fan 215 of inside air fan 203 via<br>
inside air suction port 202, and then passes through heat exchanger 204 and<br>
returns back into box for containing heating element 200 via inside air<br>
blowout port 205 so as to form circulating inside air path 206.<br>
On the other hand, it is took into turbo fan 215 of outside air fan 208<br>
via outside air suction port 207, and then passes through heat exchanger<br>
204 and is exhausted to the outside air via outside air blowout port 209 so<br>
as to form outside air path 214.<br>
Heat exchanger 204 has suction ports on the top surface and the<br>
bottom surface in the longitudinal direction, as the suction ports of the<br>
longitudinal path, and has blowout ports, which serve as inside air blowout<br>
ports 216 and the outside air blowout ports, on parts of the side surfaces in<br>
the short-side direction, respectively, so as to form countercurrent air path<br>
21<br><br>
in the longitudinal direction of the inside of the heat exchanger. Heat<br>
exchanger 204 has a substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape having<br>
a substantially L-shaped air path communicating the suction ports and the<br>
blowout ports, exchanges the sensible heat of the outside air and the inside<br>
air, and is arranged between outside air path 214 and inside air path 206.<br>
In addition, heat exchanger 204 is arranged such that the short-side<br>
direction is consistent with the depth direction of cooler for heater-<br>
containing box 210.<br>
Inside air fan 203 and outside air fan 208 are arranged such that the<br>
rotating shaft of turbo fan 215 is in parallel with the air intake direction<br>
and each blowout direction of inside air fan 203 and outside air fan 208 is<br>
aligned with the suction ports of the longitudinal air path, and control unit<br>
213 is provided for controlling the operations of inside air fan 203 and<br>
outside air fan 208.<br>
Inside air blowout port 205 and outside air blowout port 209<br>
provided at the planes of box 201 are arranged such that they are in directly<br>
surface contact with and integrated with inside air blowout port 216 and<br>
outside air blowout port (not shown) of heat exchanger 204.<br>
With the above structure, cooler for heater-containing box 210 takes<br>
the outside air when the internal air temperature is higher than the outside<br>
air temperature, exchanges heat to warmer air within box containing<br>
heating element 200 by heat exchanger 204. The warmed outside air is<br>
exhausted and the cooled air is supplied into box containing heating element<br>
200, and then the temperature within box containing heating element 200 is<br>
reduced.<br>
22<br><br>
Moreover, since the air-blasting resistance is high due to heat<br>
exchanger 204 or the like in the air path, a centrifugal fan is used to blow<br>
the air to the cooling device. The depth of cooler for heater-containing box<br>
210 is determined by the air flow, that is, the diameter of turbo fan 215.<br>
Therefore, when the diameter of turbo fan 215 is larger, the centrifugal fan<br>
becomes thinner regardless of the increase and decrease in air flow since the<br>
depth of the turbo fan is consistent.<br>
Furthermore, even when inside air fan 203 or outside air fan 208 of<br>
one cooler for heater-containing box A is broken, other cooling devices for<br>
box containing heating element A hold the cooling function. All the cooling<br>
devices for box containing heating element A are less likely to be<br>
simultaneously broken, and the cooling function will not be completely<br>
failed.<br>
Furthermore, inside air blowout port 205 and outside air blowout<br>
port 209 are in directly surface contact with the inside air blowout port and<br>
the outside air blowout port of heat exchanger 204. Therefore, there is no<br>
need to provide any space therebetween, and the depth of cooler for heater-<br>
containing box A can be thinner.<br>
Furthermore, heat exchanger 204 has the suction ports on the top<br>
surface and the bottom surface in the longitudinal direction, as the suction<br>
ports of the longitudinal path, and has blowout ports, which serve as inside<br>
air blowout port 216 and the outside air blowout port, on parts of the side<br>
surfaces in the short-side direction, respectively. In heat exchanger 204,<br>
the substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape having a substantially L-<br>
shaped air path communicating the suction ports and the blowout ports is<br>
23<br><br>
arranged such that the short-side direction thereof is aligned with the depth<br>
direction of cooler for heater-containing box A. Therefore, the depth of<br>
cooler for heater-containing box A can be thinner and the heat exchange can<br>
be effectively achieved at the air path portion of the counter current portion<br>
in the longitudinal direction.<br>
Note that the description has been given using turbo fan 215 for<br>
inside air fan 203 and outside air fan 208, but any type of fan may be used.<br>

FIG. 4 is a structural diagram relating to a temperature detector of<br>
the cooler for heater-containing box in Embodiment 2 of the present<br>
invention, and shows the state where a plurality of cooling devices for box<br>
containing heating element are installed. In FIG. 4, the same reference<br>
numerals are applied to the same structural elements as in FIGS. 2 and 3<br>
and the descriptions thereof are omitted.<br>
Inside-air-temperature-detector 211 for detecting the temperature of<br>
the inside air is arranged in inside-air-via-hole 218 which is provided<br>
between inside air fans 203 of the cooling devices for box containing heating<br>
element A. Outside-air-temperature-detector 212 for detecting the<br>
temperature of the outside air is arranged in outside-air-via-hole 217 which<br>
is provided between outside air fans 208 of the cooling devices for box<br>
containing heating element A.<br>
With the above structure, each temperature detection of the adjacent<br>
two air paths can be shared with one outside-air-temperature-detector 212<br>
24<br><br>
and inside-air-temperature-detector 211, and the arrangement structure<br>
becomes simple and the manufacturing becomes easier. Moreover, even<br>
when one of inside air fan 203 or outside air fan 208 is broken, the<br>
temperature can be detected since the other fan operates to blow the air.<br>
(Embodiment 3)<br>
Next, Embodiment 3 of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a structural diagram relating to a heat insulating<br>
material of the cooler for heater-containing box in Embodiment 3 of the<br>
present invention. In FIG. 5, the same reference numerals are applied to<br>
the same structural elements as in FIG. 2 and the descriptions thereof are<br>
omitted.<br>
Cooler for heater-containing box 210 is provided with heat<br>
insulating material 219 made of foamed polystyrene or the like, which has<br>
guide 220 having a convex wall at an edge portion against which, for<br>
example, the lower end of heat exchanger 204 is abutted so as to position<br>
heat exchanger 204.<br>
With the above structure, heat exchanger 204 can be mounted and<br>
positioned such that the lower end of heat exchanger 204 is abutted against<br>
guide 220, and thus the attachment becomes easier, the arrangement<br>
becomes simple, and the manufacturing and the maintenance become easier.<br>
In addition, the effect of heat insulating allows the cooling performance to<br>
be prevented from being affected by the temperature of the outside air and<br>
the inside air.<br>
(Embodiment 4)<br>
25<br><br>
Next, Embodiment 4 of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 6.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a structural diagram relating to a heat insulating<br>
material of the cooler for heater-containing box in Embodiment 4 of the<br>

omitted.<br>
Groove 221 is provided at the rear side of the plane abutting against<br>
heat exchanger 204 of heat insulating material 219, and operating window<br>
223 is provided in groove 221.<br>
With the above structure, when intermediate wiring 222, which<br>
connects outside air fan 208 and control unit 213, is fitted into groove 221<br>
and heat insulating material 219 is mounted to the box, the wiring is<br>
simultaneously achieved. In addition, the wiring is reliably fixed, the<br>
arrangement becomes simple, and the manufacturing becomes easier.<br>
Moreover, the connecting portion between outside air fan 208 and<br>
connector 224 of intermediate wiring 222 can be housed within heat<br>
insulating member 219, and the connecting portion of connector 224 can be<br>
easily removed so that the arrangement becomes simple and the<br>
manufacturing and the maintenance become easier. Moreover, operating<br>
window 223 is blocked by incorporating heat exchanger, and thus the dust-<br>
proof and the water-proof of the connecting portion of connector 224 can be<br>
achieved.<br>
(Embodiment 5)<br>
Next, Embodiment 5 of the present invention will be described with<br>
26<br><br>
reference to FIG. 3.<br>
In FIG. 3, peaked member 244 is provided at a plane of box 201 of<br>
cooler for heater-containing box 210, which is located closer to the outside<br>
air, and in outside air blowout port 209.<br>
With the above structure, even when outside air blowout port 209 is<br>
provided in box 201 of cooler for heater-containing box 210, the attachment<br>
of peaked member 244 reinforces box 201 and achieves weather strip.<br>
(Embodiment 6)<br>
Next, Embodiment 6 of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a structural diagram of a fan of the cooler for heater-<br>
containing box in Embodiment 6 of the present invention. In FIG. 7, the<br>
same reference numerals are applied to the same structural elements as in<br>
FIG. 2 and the descriptions thereof are omitted.<br>
In inside air fan 203 and outside air fan 208, a motor (not shown)<br>
coupled to turbo fan 215 and orifice 225 for rectification are fixed to the<br>
same fan fixing plate 226.<br>
Moreover, fan fixing plate 226 may be in a top-bottom and left-right<br>
symmetric shape, and mounting portion 227 may be U-shaped.<br>
With the above structure, the rotating shaft of turbo fan 215 is likely<br>
to be aligned with the center of orifice 225. As a result, the defective<br>
assembly due to the accumulation of the tolerances of parts and the erection<br>
tolerances can be reduced, and the arrangement becomes simple and the<br>
manufacturing becomes easier.<br>
In addition, as being in a top-bottom and left-right symmetric shape,<br>
27<br><br>
the fan fixing plate can be reversely attached. Even when inside air fan<br>
203 and outside air fan 208 have to be oppositely attached, fan fixing plate<br>
226	can serve as a common member and thus inside air fan 203 and outside<br>
air fan 208 can have the same structure. Moreover, since mounting portion<br>
227	is U-shaped, the mounting portion is hooked to a fastening screw or the<br>
like at the mounting so as to achieve the prevention of the drop.<br>

mounting hole 228, cooler for heater-containing box 210 can be conveyed<br>
with a machine and can be easily moved. For example, the direction of<br>
cooler for heater-containing box A can be easily changed on the production<br>
line at the manufacturing and can be easily suspended at the packaging,<br>
thereby enhancing the productivity.<br>
Note that FIG. 8 shows mounting hole 228 provided at the top<br>

232 prevents the drop of panel 230 after the fastening member such as a<br>
screw for fixing panel 230 is removed. Therefore, the arrangement<br>
becomes simple, and the manufacturing and the maintenance become easier.<br>
In addition, the exhaust heat via exhaust heat hole 233 allows<br>
control unit 213 to be cooled down.<br>
Note that even when the inside wall surface of control unit 213 has a<br>
wall-surface structure which is not removable, rather than the panel<br>
structure, exhaust heat hole 233 can be provided.<br>

unit 213 and is in contact with inside air path 206. In other words, printed<br>
substrate 238 serves as both a fixing member and a radiating member.<br>
30<br><br>
With the above structure, there is no need to provide any space for<br>
radiation between radiating plate 237 and the outline of control unit 213<br>
when printed substrate 238 is placed within control unit 213, and thereby<br>

and collected in drain pan 240 is pumped up along the mortar-like inclined<br>
surface of drain pan 240 by blowing the air with outside air fan 208 without<br>
using any additional member such as a pump, so that the water can be<br>
exhausted via exhaust outlet 239 which is located higher than the bottom of<br>
drain pan 240. As a result, the installation position has more degree of<br>
freedom, and the construction becomes easier.<br>
(Embodiment 12)<br>
31<br><br>
Next, Embodiment 12 of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 12.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a structural diagram relating to a drain pan of the<br>

Next, the heat exchanger of the present invention which can be<br>
employed in the cooler for heater-containing box of the present invention<br>

the heat exchanger in which the increase in air-flow resistance can be<br>
suppressed without decreasing the air-path width. In addition, since the<br>
air-path height can be maintained, the thinner heat exchanger can be<br>
obtained by narrowing the air-path width and adjusting the air-flow<br>
resistance.<br>
In another structure, the airpath-retaining-member, which forms<br>

35<br><br>
a wide air-path width, and the air path having a long air-path length at the<br>
side of the second shielding member, which is close to the blowout port of the<br>
fan, has a narrow air-path width.<br>
With this structure, there can be provided the heat exchanger in<br>
which the air flow of the air path having a short air-flow length can be<br>
reduced and that of the air path having a long air-flow length can be<br>
increased, and the temperature distribution of the heat-exchanged air in the<br>
outlet of the heat exchanger can be improved.<br>
In another structure, the air-path-retaining-members are arranged<br>
at irregular intervals so as to reduce an air flow difference of the plurality of<br>
substantially Lrshaped air paths in accordance with the shape of the air<br>
paths provided in front of and at the back of a carrying member blowing air<br>
to the heat exchanger, or the heat exchanger.<br>

36<br><br>
which the difference of the air flow in each air path can be reduced, and the<br>
temperature distribution of the heat-exchanged air in the outlet of the heat<br>
exchanger can be improved.<br>

shaped air paths, the air path at the central portion has a narrow air-path<br>
width, and the air path having a short air-path length at the side of the first<br>
shielding member and the air path having a long air-path length at the side<br>
of the second shielding member have wide air-path widths.<br>
With this structure, there can be provided the heat exchanger in<br>
which the difference of the air flow in each air path can be reduced, and the<br>
temperature distribution of the heat-exchanged air in the outlet of the heat<br>
exchanger can be improved.<br>
In another structure, a side-surface-retaining-member is arranged<br>
at the locations serving as both ends of the first shielding member and<br>
corners in the longitudinal direction of the second shielding member, which<br>
are formed at the second heat transfer plate, and as the edge portion of the<br>
opening of the first heat transfer plate adjacent thereto. At the both ends<br>
of the first shielding member and at the both ends of the second shielding<br>

With this structure, there can be provided the heat exchanger in<br>
which the deformation due to heat contraction can be prevented, the<br>
opening height is maintained at the peripheral side, and the increase in air-<br>
flow resistance can be suppressed. In addition, since the opening height<br>

resistance while maintaining the air-path height.<br>
In another structure, at least one peripheral air flow retaining<br>

member formed at the second heat transfer plate located therebelow.<br>
With this structure, there can be provided the heat exchanger in<br>
which the air-path height can be maintained at the peripheral side and the<br>
increase in air-flow resistance can be suppressed. In addition, since the<br>
air-path height can be maintained, the thinner heat exchanger can be<br>
obtained by narrowing the air-path width and adjusting the air-flow<br>
resistance.<br>

edge portion is folded back to have a length longer than the air-path height<br>
with respect to the heat transfer surface, and the sealing member provided<br>
38<br><br>

portion of the opening is greater than the air-path height in the inlet and<br>
the outlet.<br>
With this structure, there can be provided the heat exchanger in<br>
which the decrease in the height of the opening due to burr can be prevented,<br>
and the increase in air-flow resistance can be suppressed. In addition,<br>
since the decrease in the height of the opening can be prevented, the thinner<br>
heat exchanger can be obtained by maintaining the air-path height,<br>
narrowing the air-path width and adjusting the air-flow resistance.<br>
Hereinafter, the embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the drawings.<br>

FIG. 13 is a schematic exploded perspective view of a heat exchanger<br>
employed in this embodiment. FIG. 14 is a schematic perspective view of<br>
the heat exchanger at the stacking of heat transfer plates. FIG. 15 is a<br>
schematic perspective view of the heat exchanger at the stacking of heat<br>
transfer plates from the stacking direction. FIG. 16 is a schematic cross<br>

prior to heat welding. FIG. 18 is a schematic cross sectional view of the<br>
39<br><br>
inlet after the heat welding.<br>
In FIGS. 13 and 14, in the heat exchanger constituted by alternately<br>
stacking first heat transfer plates 101 and second heat transfer plates 102,<br>
first air path 1 and second air path 2 are provided above and below each<br>
heat transfer plate. The fluid flowing on first air path 1 and second air<br>
path 2 exchanges heat via each heat transfer plate. At the outlet and inlet<br>
portions of each air path, the air flowing into in the longitudinal direction<br>
and the air flowing out in the short-side direction flow perpendicularly to<br>
each other. At the central portion, the airs form a counter current, which<br>
flows in the counter direction to each other in the longitudinal direction.<br>
The heat transfer plates are integrated by heat welding on the peripheral<br>
side surfaces.<br>
In practice, multiple first heat transfer plates 101 and second heat<br>
transfer plates 102 are alternately stacked, but four heat transfer plates are<br>
shown for simplification.<br>
First heat transfer plate 101 and second heat transfer plate 102 has<br>
a rectangular plane shape, and is formed by vacuum molding high-impact<br>
polystyrene sheet having a thickness of, for example, 0.2 mm.<br>
First heat transfer plate 101 is formed to be in a hollow convex<br>
shape and to have, for example, a convex height of 2.6 mm and a width of 2<br>
mm with respect to the surface of heat transfer surface 105. First heat<br>
transfer plate 101 has nine curved air path ribs 3 as substantially Lrshaped<br>
air-path-retaining-members having a curved counter-current portion to be<br>
arranged in substantially parallel and at substantially regular interval.<br>
Curved air path ribs 3 form substantially L-shaped first air path 1 and heat<br>
40<br><br>
transfer surface 105.<br>
Inlets 4 and outlets 5 of first air path 1 are provided with air flow<br>
end face 106 as a sealing member in which the edge of first heat transfer<br>
plate 101 is bent toward the direction opposite to the protrusion direction of<br>
curved air path ribs 3, for example, to the position of 2.4 mm with respect to<br>
the surface of heat transfer surface 105. Inlets 4 and outlets 5 are provided<br>
with air flow end face cover Ilia as a sealing member in which both ends of<br>
air path end face 106, e.g., the portion located 10 mm from the ends, are<br>
bent to the position of 5.2 mm with respect to the surface which is longer<br>
than air path end face 106, e.g., the surface of heat transfer surface 105.<br>
Air path opening 6a is formed of air path end face 106 and air path end face<br>
cover Ilia.<br>
Note that an alphabetic lower letter at the end of reference numeral<br>
is applied for distinguishing from the similar reference numeral because the<br>
reference numerals denote the portions having the same function but<br>
different arrangements. Hereinafter, the similar description will be<br>
applied.<br>
The both ends of curved air path rib 3 are provided with a plurality<br>
of, for example, 18 first protrusions 107 which are in a hollow convex shape<br>
in the same direction as the protrusion direction of curved air path ribs 3<br>
and have the height greater than the height of curved air path ribs 3 such<br>
that the height is, for example, 5.2 mm with respect to heat transfer surface<br>
105.<br>
At the peripheral edge portion other than the inlet and outlet of first<br>
air path 1 of first heat transfer plate 101 and at the linear portion<br>
41<br><br>
sandwiched between inlet 4 and outlet 5 of first air path 1, peripheral rib<br>
A7a is provided as the first shielding member which is in a hollow convex<br>
shape in the same direction of the protrusion direction of curved air path<br>
ribs 3 and is formed to have the equal height to first protrusion 107 such<br>
that the width is, for example, 10 mm. The upper surface of peripheral rib<br>
A7a is in parallel with heat transfer surface 105, and the outer side surfaces<br>
thereof are bent to the same position as air path end face cover Ilia. Note<br>
that peripheral rib A7 corresponding to the first shielding member is a<br>
generic name of peripheral ribs A7a and 7b.<br>
At the peripheral edge portion other than inlet 4, outlet 5, and<br>
peripheral rib A7a of first air path 1 of first heat transfer plate 101,<br>
peripheral rib B8 is formed as the Lrshaped second shielding member to<br>
have the same width as peripheral rib A7a. Peripheral rib B8a of<br>
peripheral rib B8, which is located opposite to peripheral rib A7a, is formed<br>
to have the equal height to peripheral rib A7a, and the other peripheral ribs<br>
B8b, 8c are formed to have the equal height to curved air path ribs 3. Note<br>
that peripheral rib B8 corresponding to the second shielding member is a<br>
generic name of peripheral ribs B8a to 8f.<br>
The peripheral side surfaces of peripheral rib B8a are bent to the<br>
same position as air path end face cover Ilia, and is provided with side<br>
surface cover 9 as a sealing member. The portion from the corners of the<br>
peripheral side surfaces of peripheral ribs B8b, 8c to the position having the<br>
same dimension as peripheral rib A7 is bent to the same position as air path<br>
end face cover 111a, and is provided with air path end face cover 111b. The<br>
other portions are bent to the position of, for example, 2.2 mm from the<br>
42<br><br>
upper surface of peripheral ribs B8b, 8c, and are provided with air path<br>
opening 6b.<br>
The corners of peripheral ribs B8b, 8c which are adjacent to inlet 4<br>
and outlet 5 are provided with second protrusions 112 which are in a<br>
hollowconvex shape in the same direction as the protrusion direction of<br>
curved air path ribs 3 and are formed to have the equal height to first<br>
protrusion 107.<br>
At the side of each of peripheral rib A7a and peripheral rib B8a,<br>
which is located closer to the air path, four semicircular recessed portions 10<br>
serving as the peripheral-airpath-retainingmember are provided to be<br>
flush with heat transfer surface 105.<br>
Second heat transfer plate 102 has a similarity relation to first heat<br>
transfer plate 101, and is formed such that the heights of peripheral rib A7b<br>
and peripheral ribs B8d, 8e, 8f of second heat transfer plate 102 are equal to<br>
the height of curved air path ribs 3. Second heat transfer plate is formed to<br>
have the same width as peripheral rib A7a of the first heat transfer plate.<br>
On each of peripheral rib A7b and peripheral rib B8d of second heat<br>
transfer plate 102, four side-surface reinforcing portions 11 are provided to<br>
be adjacent to semicircular recessed portion 10 provided at first heat<br>
transfer plate 101 at the stacking, the side-surface reinforcing portion 11<br>
serving as a side-surface-retaining-member which is formed in the same<br>
direction as the protrusion direction of curved air path ribs 3, for example at<br>
the height of 7.8 mm, with respect to heat transfer surface 105. Side-<br>
surface reinforcing portions 11 at both ends are aligned with the ends of<br>
peripheral rib A7b and peripheral rib B8d.<br>
43<br><br>
In the above structure, when first heat transfer plates 101 and<br>
second heat transfer plates 102 are alternately stacked, curved air path ribs<br>
3 are not aligned with curved air path ribs 3 formed at the adjacent heat<br>
transfer plate in the stacking direction, as shown in FIG. 15. Therefore,<br>
adjacent curved air path ribs 3 are not fitted into one another, the upper<br>
surfaces of curved air path ribs 3 are always abutted against the lower<br>
surface of the heat transfer plate provided thereabove, and thus the air-path<br>
height can be maintained.<br>
This air-path height is designed in terms of the performance and the<br>
fabrication of the heat exchanger such as air-flow resistance.<br>
Moreover, as shown in FIG. 16, the upper surface of side-surface<br>
reinforcing portion 11 is abutted against the lower surface of peripheral rib<br>
A7a of first heat transfer plate 101, and the lower surface of semicircular<br>
recessed portion 10 is abutted against the upper surface of peripheral rib<br>
B8d of second heat transfer plate 102. Thereby, the decrease in the height<br>
of the opening and the decrease in the air-path height at the peripheral side<br>
due to the heat contraction at the heat welding can be suppressed.<br>
Moreover, since the peripheral side surface of peripheral rib A7a and<br>
the peripheral side surface of peripheral rib B8d of the adjacent heat<br>
transfer plates can have a large welding area, the generation of non-welded<br>
portion due to the heat contraction can be prevented at the heat welding,<br>
and the productivity can be enhanced.<br>
Moreover, as shown in FIG. 17, air path opening 6a and air path<br>
opening 6b of inlet 4 are formed such that opening height h2 from the heat<br>
transfer surface is higher than air-path height h1, for example h2=3 mm &gt;<br>
44<br><br>
h1=2.6 mm. Even when burr 12 is left at the cutting portion of air path<br>
opening 6a and air path opening 6b at the cutting and burr 12 falls to block<br>
off the opening height of inlet 4 at the heat welding as shown in FIG. 18, air<br>
path opening 6a and air path opening 6b are designed such that the opening<br>
height can be maintained to be equal or more than the air-path height, that<br>
is, h3 &gt; hl=2.6 mm. Thereby, the decrease in the opening height due to<br>
burr 12 can be suppressed.<br>
In addition, since first heat transfer plate 101 and second heat<br>
transfer plate 102 can leave burr 12 within an acceptable range, the<br>
productivity is also enhanced.<br>
Note that in this Embodiment 13, high-impact polystyrene sheet is<br>
used as the material of heat transfer plates and the heat transfer plates are<br>
integrally formed by vacuum molding. However, for the material, other<br>
thermoplastic resin films such as polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene,<br>
polyethylene terephthalate, or the like, thin metal plate such as aluminum,<br>
or paper material, microporous resin film, resin-laced paper material having<br>
heat transfer property and vapor permeability, or the like can be used. For<br>
the molding method, even when the heat transfer plates are integrally<br>
formed by other techniques such as air-pressure forming, air-pressure<br>
vacuum forming, press molding, or the like, the similar operation and effect<br>
can be obtained.<br>
Moreover, the thickness of the sheet is set at 0.2 mm, but it is<br>
preferable to use the sheet of sheet material having a thickness in the range<br>
of 0.05 to 0.5mm.<br>
The reason why is that when the thickness is 0.05 mm or less, the<br>
45<br><br>
sheet material is likely to be damaged such as broken at the formation of<br>
roughness shapes and the handling of the molded heat transfer plate, and<br>
the molded heat transfer plate has no body and the handling thereof<br>
becomes worse. In addition, when the thickness is more than 0.5 mm, the<br>
heat transfer property is reduced.<br>
The thinner the sheet thickness is, the heat transfer property<br>
increases, and the formability is likely to be decreased. In contrast, the<br>
thicker the sheet thickness is, the heat transfer property is likely to be<br>
decreased.<br>
Therefore, in order to satisfy the formability and the heat transfer<br>
property, it is preferable to use the sheet of sheet material having a<br>
thickness in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 mm, and more preferably in the range<br>
of 0.15 to 0.25mm.<br>
Moreover, curved air path rib 3 is shaped to have one curve, but<br>
even when it is shaped to have a plurality of curves as long as curved air<br>
path ribs 3 of the adjacent heat transfer plates are not fitted into one<br>
another at the stacking, the similar operation and effect can be obtained.<br>
Moreover, semicircular recessed portion 10 is employed as the<br>
peripheral-airpath-retaining-member, but other shapes can achieve the<br>
similar operation and effect as long as it is abutted against the upper<br>
surface of peripheral rib B8 of second heat transfer plate 102 located below<br>
at the stacking.<br>
Moreover, the dimension and the number of each part are exemplary,<br>
and are not particularly limited to the values. Even when each part is<br>
appropriately designed in terms of the performance and the fabrication of<br>
46<br><br>
the heat exchanger, such as air-flow resistance and heat exchange rate, the<br>
similar operation and effect can be obtained.<br>
The heat exchanger described in the embodiment can be downsized<br>
in the short-side direction by adjusting the air-path width. The depth of<br>
the cooler for heater-containing box of the present invention can be further<br>
thinner by being mounted on the cooler for heater-containing box described<br>
in Embodiments 1 to 12 with inlet 4 aligning with the suction port of the<br>
longitudinal air path and outlet 5 aligning with inside air blowout port 216<br>
and the blowout port serving as the outside air blowout port at a portion of<br>
the side surface in the short-side direction.<br>
(Embodiment 14)<br>
FIG. 19 is a plan view of a first heat transfer plate. Note that the<br>
same portions as in Embodiment 13 are denoted by the same reference<br>
numerals and exhibit the same operation and effect, and the descriptions<br>
thereof are omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 19, in substantially Lrshaped first air paths la to<br>
lj which are formed at first heat transfer plate 101, first air path la<br>
provided closer to peripheral rib A7a has the shortest air-path length and<br>
first air path lj provided closer to peripheral rib B8 has the longest air-path<br>
length.<br>
The first air paths are arranged such that first air path la, which<br>
has the shortest air-path length, has a narrow air-path width and first air<br>
path lj has a wide width, and the width of each air path is designed to<br>
satisfy the relationship of the width of first air path 1a 
air path 1b 
47<br><br>
the width of first air path 1e 
first air path 1g 
1i 
appropriately designed depending on the dimension of the heat transfer<br>
plate, the air flow, and the fabricating property.<br>
Second heat transfer plate 102 is also designed in the same manner,<br>
but only first heat transfer plate 101 is shown for simplification.<br>
In the above structure, the fluid flowing from the direction indicated<br>
by arrow A in the figure flows into each first air path la to lj, conducts heat<br>
exchange, and flows out via outlet 5. Since the air path having the short<br>
air-path length has a narrow width and the air path having the long air-<br>
path length has a wide width, the difference of the air flow flowing on each<br>
air path is decreased. Therefore, as compared with the equal air-path<br>
width, the temperature difference of each air path at the outlet can be<br>
decreased. In this manner, since the difference of the air flow flowing on<br>
each air path is decreased by arranging the air-patlrretaining-members at<br>
irregular intervals, the temperature difference of each air path at the outlet<br>
can be decreased. Moreover, the efficiency of heat exchange of the heat<br>
exchanger can be improved and the heat exchanger can be downsized.<br>
Moreover, even when curved air path ribs 3 at inlet 4a of first air<br>
path la and at the inlet portion of second air path 2 (not shown) are located<br>
at the same line, curved air path ribs 3 on the adjacent heat transfer plates<br>
at the counter current portion are not fitted into one another. Therefore,<br>
each air-path width can be designed as appropriate.<br>
Note that, in the present Embodiment 14, each air path has<br>
48<br><br>
different width dimensions, but some of airpath widths may be equal, e.g.,<br>
the width of first air path 1d = the width of first air path 1e.<br>
The depth of the cooler for heater-containing box of the present<br>
invention can be further thinner by mounting the heat exchanger described<br>
in the present embodiment on the cooler for heater-containing box described<br>
in Embodiments 1 to 12.<br>
(Embodiment 15)<br>
The matters described above are useful for the case where the fluid<br>
(air) flowing into the heat exchanger has uniform wind speed and static<br>
pressure, and no structure preventing the blowing is provided near the<br>
outlet of the heat exchanger. However, the air-path shape allowing such<br>
ideal air to flow in the heat exchanger is less likely to be provided in design<br>
of the devices. For example, since the size of the blowout port of the fan is<br>
inconsistent with the size of the inlet of the heat exchanger, the uniform<br>
inflow air cannot be achieved unless there is enough distance between the<br>
blowout port of the fan and the inlet of the heat exchanger. However, such<br>
air-path shape is less likely to be selected because the size of the device<br>
becomes larger. The present invention is useful under such circumstances,<br>
and will be described based on FIGS. 20 and 21.<br>
FIGS. 20 and 21 are schematic arrangement plans showing a<br>
positional relationship between first heat transfer plate 101 and blowout<br>
port 14 of fan 13.<br>
Note that the same portions as in Embodiments 13 and 14 are<br>
denoted by the same reference numerals and exhibit the same operation and<br>
effect, and the descriptions thereof are omitted.<br>
49<br><br>
In FIG. 20, blowout port 14 of fan 13 for carrying the air to first air<br>
paths la to 1j is arranged at the location closer to the air path having a long<br>
air-path length of first air path 1. Curved air path ribs 3 are arranged such<br>
that in the air-path width of first air paths la to lj, first air path lj, below<br>
which outlet 14 of fan 13 is arranged and which has the longest air-path<br>
length, has a narrow width and first air path la has a wide width. The<br>
width of each air path is designed to satisfy the relationship of the width of<br>
first air path la &gt; the width of first air path lb &gt; the width of first air path<br>
1c &gt; the width of first air path 1d &gt; the width of first air path 1e &gt; the width<br>
of first air path 1f &gt; the width of air path A1g &gt; the width of first air path 1h<br>
&gt; the width of first air path 1i &gt; the width of first air path 1j. The width<br>
dimension of each air path is appropriately designed depending on the<br>
dimension of the heat transfer plate, the air flow, and the fabricating<br>
property.<br>
Second heat transfer plate 102 is also designed in the same manner,<br>
but only first heat transfer plate 101 is shown for simplification.<br>
In the above structure, the fluid blowing out from blowout port 14 of<br>
fan 13 flows into each first air path la to lj, conducts heat exchange, and<br>
flows out via outlet 5. Since the air path, which is arranged directly above<br>
blowout port 14 and has a long air-path length, has a narrow width, and the<br>
air path, which is located far from blowout port 14 and has a short air-path<br>
length, has a wide width, the difference of the air flow flowing in each air<br>
path located closer to first air path lj having much inflow air flow is<br>
decreased due to the relationship to blowout port 14 of fan 13. Therefore,<br>
as compared with the case where air-path widths are equal, the<br>
50<br><br>
temperature difference of each air path at the outlet can be decreased. In<br>
this manner, since the difference of the air flow flowing on each air path is<br>
decreased by arranging the air-path-retaining-members at irregular<br>
intervals, the temperature difference of each air path at the outlet can be<br>
decreased. Moreover, the efficiency of heat exchange of the heat exchanger<br>
can be improved and the heat exchanger can be downsized.<br>
Moreover, even when curved air path ribs 3 at inlet 4a of first air<br>
path la and at the inlet portion of second air path 2 (not shown) are located<br>
at the same line, curved air path ribs 3 on the adjacent heat transfer plates<br>
are not fitted into one another at the counter current portion. Therefore,<br>
each air-path width can be designed as appropriate.<br>
Note that, in the present Embodiment 15, each air path has<br>
different width dimensions, but some of air-path widths may be equal, e.g.,<br>
the width of first air path lh = the width of first air path li, at the portion<br>
having the small difference of air flow among each air path due to the<br>
arrangement relationship between the fan and the heat exchanger, or the<br>
like.<br>
Next, in FIG. 21, blowout port 14 of fan 13 for carrying the air to<br>
first air paths la to lj are arranged at the central air-path portion of first<br>
air path 1. Curved air path ribs 3 are arranged such that in the air-path<br>
width of first air paths la to lj, first air path le located at the central air-<br>
path portion below which blowout port 14 of fan 13 is arranged has a narrow<br>
width and first air paths la and lj located at both ends have wide widths.<br>
The width of each air path is designed to satisfy the relationship of the<br>
width of first air path la &gt; the width of first air path lb &gt; the width of first<br>
51<br><br>
air path lc &gt; the width of first air path Id &gt; the width of first air path le 
the width of first air path If 
first air path lh 
lj. The width dimension of each air path is appropriately designed<br>
depending on the dimension of the heat transfer plate, the air flow, and the<br>
fabricating property.<br>
Second heat transfer plate 102 is also designed in the same manner,<br>
but only first heat transfer plate 101 is shown for simplification.<br>
In the above structure, the fluid blowing out from blowout port 14 of<br>
fan 13 flows into each first air path la to lj, conducts heat exchange, and<br>
flows out via outlet 5. Since the air path at the central portion, which is<br>
arranged directly above outlet 14, has a narrow air-path width, and the air<br>
paths at the both ends, which are located far from blowout port 14, have<br>
wide air-path widths, the difference of the air flow flowing on each air path<br>
at the central portion having much inflow air flow is decreased due to the<br>
relationship to blowout port 14 of fan 13. Therefore, as compared with the<br>
case where the air-path widths are equal, the temperature difference of each<br>
air path at the outlet can be decreased.<br>
Moreover, even when curved air path ribs 3 at inlet 4a of first air<br>
path la and at the inlet portion of second air path 2 (not shown) are located<br>
at the same line, curved air path ribs 3 on the adjacent heat transfer plates<br>
are not fitted into one another at the counter current portion. Therefore,<br>
each air-path width can be designed as appropriate.<br>
Note that in the present Embodiment 15, each air path has different<br>
width dimensions, but some of air-path widths may be equal, e.g., the width<br>
52<br><br>
of first air path le = the width of first air path If, at the portion having the<br>
small difference of air flow among each air path due to the arrangement<br>
relationship between the fan and the heat exchanger, or the like.<br>
It should be noted that in the description on the embodiments of the<br>
heat exchanger, first opening 6a is referred to as inlet 4 or inlet 4a when the<br>
air actually flows, and is referred to as suction port (with no reference<br>
numeral) when it is incorporated into the body of the cooler for heater-<br>
containing box.<br>
Moreover, second opening 6b is referred to as outlet 5 when the air<br>
flows, and is referred to as blowout port (with no reference numeral), inside<br>
air blowout port 216, and outside air blowout port (with no reference<br>
numeral) when it is incorporated into the body of the cooler for heater-<br>
containing box.<br>
According to the present invention, the air-patrrretaining-member<br>
at the portion, where the fluid flowing at the first air path and the second<br>
air path forms the counter current, is shaped to be curved, and thereby<br>
there can be provided the heat exchanger having effects of maintaining the<br>
air-path height and suppressing the increase in air-flow resistance.<br>
Moreover, the air-path height is maintained without decreasing the<br>
air-path width, and thereby there can be provided the heat exchanger<br>
having an effect of suppressing the increase in air-flow resistance.<br>
Moreover, the air-patrrretaining-members, which form the portion<br>
where the fluid flowing at the first air path and the second air path forms<br>
the counter current, are arranged at irregular intervals, and thereby there<br>
can be provided the heat exchanger having an effect of improving the<br>
53<br><br>
temperature distribution.<br>
Moreover, the air-path-retaining-members are arranged at irregular<br>
intervals such that among a plurality of substantially Lrshaped air paths,<br>
the air path having a short air-path length at the side of the first shielding<br>
member has a narrow air-path width, and the air path having a long air-<br>
path length at the side of the second shielding member has a wide air-path<br>
width, and thereby there can be provided the heat exchanger having an<br>
effect of improving the temperature distribution.<br>
Moreover, the air-path-retaining-members are arranged at irregular<br>
intervals such that among a plurality of substantially Lrshaped air paths,<br>
the air path having a short air-path length at the side of the first shielding<br>
member has a wide air-path width, and the air path having a long air-path<br>
length at the side of the second shielding member has a narrow air-path<br>
width, and thereby there can be provided the heat exchanger having an<br>
effect of improving the temperature distribution.<br>
Moreover, the air-path-retaining-members are arranged at irregular<br>
intervals such that among a plurality of substantially L-shaped air paths,<br>
the air path provided at the central portion has a narrow air-path width,<br>
and the air path having a short air-path length at the side of the first<br>
shielding member and the air path having a long air-path length at the side<br>
of the second shielding member have wide air-path widths, and thereby<br>
there can be provided the heat exchanger having an effect of improving the<br>
temperature distribution.<br>
Moreover, the side-surface-retaining-member is arranged at the<br>
locations serving as both ends of the first shielding member and corners in<br>
54<br><br>
the longitudinal direction of the second shielding member, which are formed<br>
at the second heat transfer plate, and as the edge portion of the opening of<br>
the first heat transfer plate adjacent thereto. At the both ends of the first<br>
shielding member and at the both ends of the second shielding member,<br>
which is located opposite to the first shielding member, the upper surface of<br>
the first shielding member of the first heat transfer plate is abutted against<br>
the lower surface of the second shielding member of the second heat transfer<br>
plate, the upper surface of the second shielding member of the first heat<br>
transfer plate is abutted against the lower surface of the first shielding<br>
member of the second heat transfer plate, and the upper surface of the side-<br>

shielding member and the second shielding member of the first heat<br>
transfer plate. Thereby, there can be provided the heat exchanger having<br>

suppressing the increase in air-flow resistance.<br>

shielding member and the second shielding member formed at the first heat<br>
transfer plate, and the peripheral-air-path-retaining-member is abutted<br>

at the second heat transfer plate which is located below the first heat<br>
transfer plate. Thereby, the air-path height at the peripheral side is<br>
maintained and the increase in air-flow resistance is suppressed.<br>
Moreover, the sealing member formed at the peripheral edge portion<br>
is folded back to the position having the length greater than the air-path<br>
55<br><br>
height with respect to the heat transfer surface, and the second opening is<br>
formed at the sealing member provided below the inlet and the outlet.<br>
Thereby, there can be provided the heat exchanger having effects of<br>
decreasing the number of steps of the welding and improving the<br>
productivity.<br>
Moreover, the first opening and the second opening are formed such<br>
that the height of the opening between the heat transfer surface and the<br>
edge portion of the opening in the inlet and the outlet is greater than the<br>
air-path height. Accordingly, the heat exchanger having effects of<br>
preventing the decrease in the height of the opening due to burr and<br>
suppressing the increase in air-flow resistance can be provided.<br>
Therefore, the efficiency of heat exchange of the heat exchanger can<br>
be improved, and the downsized heat exchanger can be provided.<br>
