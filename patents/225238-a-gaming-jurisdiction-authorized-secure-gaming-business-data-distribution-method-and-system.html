				<td>A GAMING-JURISDICTION-AUTHORIZED SECURE<br>
GAMING-BUSINESS DATA DISTRIBUTION METHOD<br>
AND SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention. This invention relates to virtual regulated casino-type<br>
gaming systems and business processes and, more particularly, to an improved casino on-<br>
site, regulated off-site and regulated Internet remote gaming experience.<br>
2. Prior Art. A Hodges et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,446,424 discloses a remote gaming<br>
system for use with a wagering or gambling establishment such as a casino. A player<br>
participates in a selected one of a plurality of live wagering games from a remote location.<br>
The system includes a croupier station, a credit station, and a remotely located player<br>
station. The player station includes a live game display for displaying a selected one of a<br>
plurality of games being played at the croupier station, such as craps, roulette, or keno. The<br>
player station includes a separate, changeable playboard for displaying a selected one of a<br>
plurality of wagering possibilities corresponding to a selected one of the plurality of games<br>
being played and for displaying the results of the game being played at the croupier station.<br>
The player station also includes a microprocessor for controlling the operation of the live<br>
game display and the operation of the separate, changeable playboard. The betting<br>
decisions required by the remote player for the croupier games are just as complicated as the<br>
actual games and no card games are mentioned. The Hodges et at system is not practical<br>
because state gaming laws also require that the eligibility of a remote player be initially<br>
established and also be periodically verified by security personnel. No mention is made in<br>
the Hodges et .1. patent for any player authentication at the remotely located player station.<br>
such as a hotel room, or convenience store or other "licensable" off-site locations.<br>
A Molnick Patent, U.S. Patent No. 5,800,268, also discloses a method by which a<br>
remote player may participate in a live casino game from a location remote from a casing<br>
A player establishes an information link with a casino from an interface station which<br>
includes a video monitor and a keypad, where the keypad is game specific and<br>
unchangeable. The Molnick patent also uses camera, and discloses table card games. The<br>
betting scheme of Molnick is just as complicated as the actual table game. The system of<br>
Molnick is also not practical. While modems and phones .incs are used, compression and<br>
encryption are not. Molnick also does not use player eligibility authentication. Molnick<br>
displays to the remote player an entire gaming table with a number of "live" players, which<br>
would enable card counting and team playing by the remote players, both of wh.ch are not<br>
acceptable to casinos.<br>
A need exists for a practical remote casino-type gaming system that would meet<br>
state gaming regulations, which are promulgated mainly to ensure the fairness of the game<br>
and eligibility of the players, such as age and creditworthiness. A need also exists for a<br>
system which would provide a smooth progression from regulated casino gaming to<br>
regulated remote on-site and off-site gaming and eventually to regulated Internet gaming.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a practical but remote player-<br>
friendly casino-type gaming system that meets the gaming legal regulations, as promulgated<br>
by the various governmental jurisdictions. The key benefits are: (a) ease of play, (b) retains<br>
most of the excitement of actual live participation, (c) ability to control rate of play, thereby<br>
reducing player stress, (d) ensures a greater level of privacy, thereby limiting<br>
embarrassment, (e) better utilization of the existing personnel and facility infrastructure, (1)<br>
enables gaming multimedia video product creation, advertising and branding by the casino,<br>
(g) enables regulated off-site gaming, including Internet, and (h) facilitates effective novice<br>
player education.<br>
Some of the technical features of a system according to the invention include data<br>
compression with a video Codec using, for example, J/MPEG and other application-specific<br>
compression techniques. Data encryption is provided using, for example, DES 128 and<br>
strong RSA encryption. Various communication pathways are used such as copper, fiberoptic,<br>
and wireless, to interconnect the disclosed subsystems. Various communication<br>
network protocols (eg., IEEE 802.XX, ITU/CCITT V Series protocol, TCP/IP) and network<br>
topologies (e.g., ring, star) are used to implement networks such as, for example, LAN,<br>
WAN, VPN, Cable Modems, ADSL, Satellite (e.g., QAM), Internet, wherein the forward<br>
path from the multimedia video source needs, for example, about one megabyte per second<br>
(IMB/sec) data bandwidth capability and the return path needs capability in the range of<br>
about ten kilobytes per second (10KB/sec), with further reductions provided with evolving<br>
MPEG.X technology. A communication distribution hub enables multiple games to be fed<br>
in and routed to multiple remote player stations. Legally certified random number<br>
generators (RNGs) are uses to randomly select one source for video multimedia signals<br>
from several incoming gaming video multimedia sources, in an autonomous manner, for<br>
each game episode presented to the remote player, at the remote player station.<br>
The system includes' a number of features. Virtual gaming at a remote site uses<br>
legally randomized live video or pre-recorded video. Pre-recorded video could be obtained<br>
from prior casino security video storage tapes or from tapes of closed regulated<br>
tournaments. If a random pre-recorded gaming episode is selected by the remote player,<br>
thcn its playback can be slowed down to reduce player stress. A remote on-site or off-site<br>
player bets, for or against, a live player while viewing either a live casino video signal or a<br>
pre-recorded casino video from any secure multimedia storage repository (e.g., disk, tape).<br>
Wagering rules for the games are simple as compared to more complicated live casino game<br>
wagering rules resulting in a new way of wagering on existing games, as well as the creation<br>
of new wagering games. Due to the simplicity of the betting rules, a remote player can<br>
concurrently play several dissimilar games at the same remote gaming station. The remote<br>
player can, in effect, virtually roam around a casino and virtually participate in a plurality of<br>
games without leaving the remote gaming station.<br>
For remote gaming stations off-site of the casino premises, the remote gaming<br>
station is periodically monitored and recorded with a return path multimedia video<br>
camera/audio channel. Various biometric sensing systems arc also used to validate a<br>
player's identity. By using currently available videotapes or disks of all licensed table<br>
games that are recorded and stored as per currently promulgated regulatory requirements,<br>
surveillance and security functions for all the live casino tables can be cost-shared with the<br>
disclosed remote gaming system. Casino surveillance and security is enhanced by the<br>
superior quality of the live game multimedia video data used for the disclosed remote<br>
gaming station purposes. The off-site remote gaming player station is at the same security<br>
level as a bank ATM machine, perhaps including even the co-located security guards. The<br>
touch screen is spill and shatterproof and an audible alarm makes the remote player stations<br>
substantially tamperproof<br>
The multimedia video data stream for a live or pre-recorded game can be processed<br>
in real-time to generate and remotely display multimedia synthetic video signal which show,<br>
for example, enhanced images of cards, dice or roulette, as well as the progress and outcome<br>
of selected live or pre-recorded casino games.<br>
Regulated live play or pre-recorded restricted access storage repository-based<br>
multimedia video, of hired casino shills or invited professional gamblers or invited<br>
celebrities at the gaming tables, enables a licensed casino to become a provider of<br>
multimedia gaming content, certified by government gaming authorities, similar to the<br>
movie/television entertainment production industry. The equipment required includes that<br>
which is currently used in the entertainment video production, video cable-based and<br>
Intemet-bascd video, content delivery systems. Moreover, in an instructional mode of<br>
operation, novice players are instructed by example, on how to play the various games in a<br>
relatively stress-free environment, by recognized gaming experts. Moreover, the video<br>
presentation can be slowed down to enable ease of viewing of the gaming action for a<br>
novice player.<br>
Thc present invention includes a legally-authorized remote gaming system which<br>
includes a multimedia video source at a casino which provides a live video or pre-recorded<br>
restricted-access video signal depicting a legally-authorized live casino game. A player<br>
accounting and tracking subsystem manages the accounts, player compensation rating and<br>
surveillance for a remote off-site player, as well as the on-site player on casino premises. A<br>
communication distribution hub connects the multimedia video source and the player<br>
accounting and tracking subsystem to the remote player station. The remote player station<br>
includes a display for displaying to a remote player the live multimedia video or the pre-recorded<br>
multimedia video signal depicting the legally-authorized, live or pre-recorded,<br>
actual casino game. The remote player station also provides gaming information which<br>
enables the remote player to place a bet and otherwise provide inputs via a touchscreen or<br>
other means. The remote player station also provides gaming information to enable the<br>
remote player to receive a payout by electronic means or by mechanical means for the<br>
casino game currently being displayed on the station display. Moreover, the display can be<br>
a conventional color monitor or a stereo 3D head mounted goggles. The goggles can also be<br>
used to restrict viewing access, to only the eligible individual players. Biomctric sensors<br>
can also be incorporated into the head-mounted remote player station. Furthermore, the<br>
entire remote player station can be wall-mounted, to facilitate ease of installation and better<br>
space utilization.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the invention,<br>
examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will<br>
be described in conjunction with the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that they<br>
are not intended to limit the invention to these embodiments. On the contrary, the invention<br>
is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included<br>
within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
The psychology of what makes a particular game "exciting" to a player is not clearly<br>
understood, as conceded even by veterans in the casino business. A typical approach to<br>
validating the attractiveness and consequently the potential success of a game is to conduct<br>
for a few months an expensive "field trial" on a casino floor and to monitor the "excitement<br>
and appeal" of the game, in terms of player usage and the consequential generation of actual<br>
revenue. However, this inventor asserts that a simplistic betting scheme involving only a<br>
minuscule amount of decision-making in a non-confrontational non-public environment is<br>
preferred by most players. This hypothesis is validated by economic data that about two-<br>
thirds of a casino's revenue is attributed to slots in contrast to revenue obtained from table<br>
games (e.g., cards) and other games (e.g., craps, keno, roulette). Moreover, due to the<br>
complexity of the required gaming infrastructure (e.g., equipment, trained personnel), the<br>
profit margin for slots is about twice that for all of the other games. On the other hand,<br>
many players, particularly younger players below the age of forty, consider video slot<br>
gaming to be quite boring.<br>
The present invention makes the playing of non-slot games into "no-braincrs" like<br>
slot games, without also eliminating the player "excitement and appeal" that non-slot games<br>
generate, so that a player can participate without the stress and potential public shame<br>
arising from a player's misjudgnent and associated losses at a live gaming table. No other<br>
player can .see what any particular player has lost, just like at a slot machine, and without<br>
player tracking, even the casino doesn't know. On the other hand, the present invention<br>
does not preclude the welcome recognition and acclaim that casinos typically bestow on<br>
winners in the casino.<br>
An additional incentive for casinos to implement this invention is that they have a<br>
substantial long star.ding/traditional investment in non-slot gaining and it is generally<br>
acknowledged that non-slot gaming needs to improve its return c:i inves-nent (ROI).<br>
However, the recent 2civent cf unregulated Intcrrxi-based gaming with its computer-based<br>
random number gcner.nt.irs (RNd) has put tremendous uncertainty into the previously sound<br>
business rationale fcr making billion dollar "(co-located casino/ hotel/' entertainment<br>
shopping) fixed casino investments. Moreover, RNG-drivcn video slots can be<br>
inexpensively replicated by thousands of unregulated entities on the Internet, subject only to<br>
mostly unenforceable regulatory issues, while it takes a substantial capital investment to<br>
maintain a live table (e.g., cards, craps, roulette) gaming facility with the associated player<br>
"excitement and appeal", that can only be generated by a live casino type of operation.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a remote multimedia dirxibuted, virtual gaming system 10 which<br>
interacts with a remote player 12. The system includes a multimedia virtual gaming content<br>
generation array 20 which is monitored by a virtual multimedia content acquisition sensor<br>
array 22. The outputs of the sensor array 22 are sent on a data/signal bus 24 to a regulatory<br>
surveillance control center server 26 and to a raw multimedia virtual gaming episode<br>
processing array 28. Processed output signals from the processing array 28 arc sent on a bus<br>
30 to a multimedia virtual gaming content playback array 32 for storage or directly to a<br>
multimedia virtual gaming content distribution center server, or hub, 34. Alternatively, a<br>
bus 33 provides stored processed signals to the hub 34 and to the surveillance control center<br>
server 26. The distribution center server is connected by a bus 36 to a player E-commerce<br>
server 38 and by a bus 40 to a player accounting, VIP tracking, and authentication server 42.<br>
A hotel reservation server 41 is connected through a bus 43 to the player E-commcrcc server<br>
38 and to the player accounting, VTP tracking, and authentication server 42. The hotel<br>
reservation server 41 provides VIP player information to the accounting server 42. These<br>
servers 38, 41, 42 provide ancillary services to the system 10. The communication server<br>
includes a random number generator which randomly selects game content. The<br>
communication server 34 is connected by a virtual private network (VPN) signal line 44 to a<br>
remote player station 46 on the casino gaming premises. The communication server 34 i:;<br>
also connected by a signal line 48 to a regulated Internet server portal 50, which is<br>
connected through the Internet 52 to a remote virtual gaming station 54, which is located off<br>
of the casino floor site and which provides for presentation of games to a player, and which<br>
provides for player participation.<br>
FIG. 1 provides a remote multimedia virtual gaming system 10 which presents a<br>
remote player 12 with virtual gaming video and audio information from actual casino<br>
games. By actual casino panics is meant games which ars actually beir.g played by real<br>
players or restricted access pre-recorded games which have been actually but previously<br>
played by real players, bcth of which are played in a real, licensed casino or in a licensed<br>
restricted access tournarr.cr.t (e.g.. invitation-only Imih stakes poker, celebrity poker). The<br>
multimedia gaming system uses live video and live audio presentations to provide a live<br>
casino environment to the remote piayer 12. Alternatively, p.'c-rcccrccd restricted access<br>
video and audio are played back to the remote playrr 12 in an autonomous legally<br>
randomized sequence to provide a Iiccns2b!c virtual casino gaming environment.<br>
The content generation array 20 djagrammatically shows three exemplary casino<br>
games being monitored/acquired according to the invention'using the multimedia content<br>
acquisition sensor array 22 comprised of either analog or digitized video and audio sensors.<br>
I A first live video image sensing camera system 60 and a first pair of stereo audio sensing<br>
microphones 62, 64 monitor a live roulette game table 66 in a licensed casino. A second<br>
live video image sensing camera system 70 and a second pair of stereo audio sensing<br>
microphones 72, 74 monitor a live card game table 76 in a licensed casino or at a<br>
tournament. A third live video image sensing camera system 80 and a third pair of stereo<br>
audio sensing microphones 82, 84 monitor a live craps game table 86 in the licensed casino.<br>
The video image sensing camera systems 60, 70, 80 are, for example, one or more (e.g.,<br>
stereo mode) color and/or black and white video cameras commercially provided by<br>
companies such as Sony, Panasonic, CoStar, Kodak and Hitachi, with a nominal digital<br>
resolution of 640 x 480 (comparable to current consumer TV) pixels (or more), compliant<br>
with any video format, including NTSC, PAL, DTV, ATSC or other appropriate SMPTE<br>
standard, selected by those skilled in the art.<br>
The output of this multimedia acquisition sensor array 22 is then processed in the<br>
processing array 28 to create a virtual gaming episode package for each game. The first step<br>
in this process is performed in a real-time content edit processing array 90 to, autonomously<br>
or manually, rapidly edit out images and audio that detract and distract from the game,<br>
including information that may enable the viewer (e.g., remote player) of the video to<br>
identify the individual live player, due to privacy considerations. Then this game episode<br>
captured on tape or computer memory is compressed in a real-time multimedia content<br>
compression processing array 92 using J/MPEG (or equal) for video and MP3 (or equal) for<br>
audio or other appropriate SMPTE standard as approved by the appropriate regulatory<br>
agency. Then the compressed episode is encrypted in a real-time multimedia encryption<br>
processing array 94 using DES (e.g., 128 bit), and/or RSA (e.g., 1024 bit public key<br>
exchange) or any authorized encryption standard, as per the gaming control board (GCB)<br>
that has jurisdiction. Note that the underlying theoretical foundation for encryption and<br>
RNG arc related. The required video rate (e.g., 30 Hz) edit/compress/encrypt preferred by<br>
TV studio quality equipment can be purchased from Sony, Panasonic, JVC, Tektronics,<br>
Quantel, AVID or equal. This, preferably real-time, encrypted/compressed/edited<br>
multimedia game episode package is then stored in the playback array 32 on a disk, tape, or<br>
CD, or any other secure storage media, for subsequent gaming content distribution. This<br>
episode package can also be directly routed, in near real-time, to the content distribution<br>
center server, or multimedia communication/distribution hub, 34.<br>
The securely encrypted and compressed live video and audio signals from the video<br>
camera systems and the stereo microphones are also connected to, recorded, and then<br>
subsequently played back with a VCR array, harci disk array or solid state disk array, as<br>
typically illustrated by utilizing a secure, compressed virtual gaming episode data base<br>
using disk or tape farm system 96. The VCRs are commercially provided by Sony,<br>
Magnavox, Panasonic, RCA and others. The disks are provided by Seagate, Maxtor,<br>
Quantum, Loronics, IBM and others. Other bulk storage media include optical and DVD,<br>
from Toshiba, JVC and others.<br>
The multimedia' communication distribution hub 34 has a number of input/output<br>
(I/O) ports connected, directly or indirectly, to the I/O ports of the cameras, microphones,<br>
and disk/tape VCRs. The multimedia communication distribution hub 34 controls<br>
distribution of video, audio, and control signals. The communication hub 34 also functions<br>
as a switching router with audio/video output signals being selected from inputs provided by<br>
video camera systems or disk/VCRs, using a random selection method controlled by a<br>
certified random number.generator (RNG), of the numerous multimedia video packets. The<br>
communication hub 34 is, for example, a bank of video, analog or digital, switches<br>
commercially provided by companies such as Cisco, Lucent, Maxim, Brocade, Gennum,<br>
Elantec or Analog Devices, controlled by a certified RNG, running on a fast microprocessor<br>
such as a 400 MHz Intel Pentium II microprocessor from Intel, IBM, Compaq or equivalent<br>
from Sun, Motorola or others. The communication hub 34 functions as a RNG driven<br>
multiport switch for selecting among incoming multimedia video channels to outgoing<br>
distribution channels, including 1000 base-T fiber-optic or video coax or copper wired or<br>
wireless (spread spectrum) transceivers or other physical layer communication pathways.<br>
The communication hub 34 has an I/O port which is connected by a virtual private<br>
network (VPN) signal line 44, which provides a wired, fiber-optic, wireless, or other<br>
connection link to the main input port of the remote player station 46. The security of the<br>
remote player station 46 is controlled by the casino, by virtue of it being on the casino<br>
gaming premises or by being under the direct physical control of the casino', such as in a<br>
casino hotel room that has appropriate sensors, as described later. The communication<br>
connection link 44 is, for example, a fiber-optic 1000 base-T rated cable or equivalent<br>
communication pathway. Various communication protocols (e.g., IEEE, 802.XX,<br>
ITU/CCITT V Series) .and topologies (e.g., star, ring) can be used to implement the required<br>
secure authorized virtual private network-iriterprocessor connectivity.<br>
The remote on-site player terminal 46 includes a remote processor 100 which<br>
performs appropriate command, control and routing functions. The remote processor 100<br>
sends video, audio and control signals to a video monitor 102 and to speakers 104. A wager<br>
acccptor subsystem 106 and a wager payout 108 subsystem provide betting information and<br>
payouts to the remote player 12. The remote processor 100 is a 16 to 128 bit<br>
microprocessor from Intel, AMD, Lucent, Texas Instruments, Phillips, Motorola, Hitachi,<br>
Sony, SGI, Sun or equal, using various real-time operating system (OS) software such as<br>
Windows CE (from Microsoft), PSOS (from Integrated Systems), Inferno (from Lucent), or<br>
any secure compact real-time operating system, that has been approved by a governmental<br>
gaming control board GCB.. The remote processor and associated I/O interface 100 can also<br>
be implemented using field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's) from Altcra, Xylinx,<br>
Lucent or equal. Using FPGA's provides an additional level of security by protection (e.g.,<br>
tamper-proofing). The remote processor 100 is coupled to the video monitor 102 with an 8<br>
Mbyte buffered memory display screen with a 256 x 256 point or better touch screen<br>
provided by Microtouch or equivalent. Alternatively, a monoscopic or stereoscopic (3D)<br>
color or black and white display is presented to a player 112 with head-mounted goggles<br>
114. Typically, no remote terminal disk, CD, or tape drive usage is required by the designer<br>
to implement the functionality, nor is it encouraged by the regulators. The remote player<br>
station 46 is contained in a tamperproof, rugged, spill-proof, alarmed safe-like enclosure.<br>
Another I/O port of the communication hub 34 is connected by the signal line, or<br>
communication link 48 to an I/O port of an authorized Internet server 50, located in a legally<br>
sanctioned gaming property in a sovereign state or Native American territory, which<br>
communicates through the Internet media 52 with a 2-wire or 4-wire telephone cable or<br>
other secure communication link to an off-site licensed Internet remote player station 54.<br>
The regulated Internet remote off-site player station 54. includes an Internet client<br>
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) stack 120, a remote player station<br>
122 (similar to the on-site casino station noted above), and biometric authentication<br>
equipment 124, from Sensar or equal for retinas, from.Digital Privacy or equal for<br>
fingerprints, from Symbol Technology or equal, for 2D. bar code based photo ID/driver's<br>
license, which are used jointly or severally, to continuously (e.g., every 5 seconds) verify<br>
the identity and eligibility of the player at that remote station. The off-site player station 54<br>
or the remote player station 46 array include a flat panel plasma or liquid crystal or cathode<br>
ray tube video display 130 such as commercially provided by Sony, Sharp, Fujitsu, NEC,<br>
Toshiba, or equivalent with a touchscreen provided by Microtouch or equal and typically<br>
shown in FIG. 1. The off-site player station 122 typically has no disk, CD, or tape drive,<br>
while being enclosed in a tamperproof ATM kiosk-like container, otherwise functionally<br>
similar to the on-site player station 46.<br>
The flat panel plasma or liquid crystal or cathode ray rube video display 130 is<br>
adapted to be mounted, for example, on a wall 132 of a casino premises. In this case, the<br>
flat panel video display is part of a gaming station which is connected by a cable 134 or,<br>
altcrnatively, by a cable 136 to the communication server 34. The cable 134 is embedded in<br>
the wall 132 of the casino premises, and'alternatively, the cable 136 is routed along the<br>
lower edge of the wall 132 near the floor 138 of the casino. These cables arc then connected<br>
to a signal path 140 which connects to the VFN signal line 44. For use in the Internet player<br>
station 54, the signal path 140 is appropriately connected to the Internet system 52. For a<br>
casino location, the signal path 140 can be a power distribution wire in the casino which is<br>
adapted for carrying data signals or an infra red communication link, which also carries data<br>
signals.<br>
To support a large array of remote player stations (e.g., 46, 54) will typically require<br>
a corresponding array of processors within the communication distribution hub 34. This is<br>
due to the corresponding array of rapidly executing (e.g., at most 10 millisee/rarndom #)<br>
RNG's, required by GCB, for each player station, as well as, the corresponding array of<br>
multimedia virtual gaming episode packets to be managed (e.g., routed), by the distribution<br>
hub 34.<br>
It is noteworthy, that the disclosed high speed certified RNG array embedded in the<br>
communication distribution hub 34, also provides a means of transmitting and distributing a<br>
certified encrypted array of random numbers to a corresponding array of on-site or off-site<br>
player stations 46 or 54, thereby significantly reducing the required secure communication<br>
link 44 or 54 bandwidth. This functionality can also be utilized to implement local area<br>
(e.^., casino) or wide area virtual private network-based (e.g., covering an entire state)<br>
progressive gaming systems.<br>
Another I/O port of the communication hub 34 is connected through the bus 40 to an<br>
I/O port of the player accounting server 42, which also provides player authentication, usage<br>
tracking and rating compensation functions. The accounting server 42 is, for example, a<br>
400 MHz or better, dual or otherwise 24 hour x 7 day fail-safe Pentium II personal computer<br>
with a 128 Mbyte SDRAM, 32 Mbyte display RAM, and a 144 Gbytc hard disk farm<br>
operating at a sustained 40 Mbyte/sec rate or the equivalent thereof, from IBM, Dell. Intel,<br>
Compac, Gateway, Sony, Hitachi, HP, Motorola, Apple, Sun or others. The player<br>
eligibility authentication function ensures that the player .s really who he or she claims to<br>
be. The tracking function non-intrusively determines ;player's gaming habits and<br>
intercepts the actual .utilization of the various gaming facilities by each player. That<br>
information ;s then used to appropriately "rate and compensate" a player with promotional<br>
and other bonus offers, such as travel/hotel/icod/ reimbursements. The<br>
compensation and promotion budget for each cf the five major properties in l.as Vegas, for<br>
example, is currently a significantly large dollar amount (e.g.. S100M per year).<br>
Although only three dissimiiar types of games are illustrated in FIG. 1, the gaming<br>
choices for the remote players 12 or 112, include a large nu;nber of card games such as, for<br>
example, Blackjack, Stud Poker, Baccarat, and ether games such as Roulette, Craps, Keno,<br>
slots and other newly deployed slot type games such as Monopoly. The present invention<br>
also allows a remote virtual slot players to participate in the outcome of a particular lucky<br>
slot machine, which is being played by a live slot player.<br>
The terms "game" and "gaming," as used herein, include not only actual casino<br>
games with live players but also all types of electronic, electromechanical or mechanical<br>
gambling and casino game facsimiles (as defined in 15 U.S.C. 11719(a) (2) or (3)). These<br>
include games such as Faro, Monte, Roulette, Kcno, Bingo, Fan-tan, Twenty-One,<br>
Blackjack, Scvcn-and-a-IIalf, Big Injun, Klondike, Craps, Poker, Chuck-a-Luck, Chinese<br>
Chuck-a-Luck (Dai Shu), Wheel of Fortune, Chcmin dc Fir, Baccarat, Pai Gow, Beat the<br>
Banker, Panguingui, slot machines, video Poker machines, etc.; games of skill and/or<br>
strategy such as Chess, Checkers, Backgammon, board games such as Monopoly and<br>
Scrabble, card games such as Pinochle, Hearts, Spades; video-based games such as Doom,<br>
Riven, Pong, Pac Man, Myst; video games based on sports such as golf, baseball, football,<br>
basketball, soccer, rugby; arcade type games; non-house stake and parimuiual games<br>
between two or more players; and games defined by IGRA (Indian Gaining Regulatory Act)<br>
as Class II games.<br>
For the pre-recorded mode of play, the communication hub/switcher 34<br>
autonomously provides legally randomized video playback which precludes card counting<br>
based wagering strategics, as detailed for example in the book "Beat the Dealer" by Thorp.<br>
Recordings cf actual games are obtained, for example, from previously recorded casino<br>
security tapes, or from closed tournaments, such as invitation-only high-stakes poker<br>
tournaments for professional gamers or celebrities.<br>
It is noted that governmental bodies such as the Nevada (NV) Gaming Control<br>
Hoard (GCB) currently have surveillance requirements winch require the deployment of at<br>
least one video camera at every ongoing licensed casir.o game. In addition, the video<br>
cameras that are monitored by lightly manned surveillance facilities are also backed up by<br>
continuous vicicu recordings (e.g., VHS video tape) and by security personnel on the casino<br>
floor. The present invention enables the casino security and surveillance functions in the<br>
surveillance contrci center server 26 to. be cost-shared wi:h the remote gaming system 10<br>
via communication luscs 24 ar.d 33.<br>
The disclosed remote gaming system will typically have video quality which is an<br>
improvement over that currently used to meet a casino's regulatory security and surveillance<br>
requirements. As a result, improvement in the quality of a casino's camera surveillance<br>
system can be cost-justified by sharing the increased resolution and superior video data<br>
quality required of a remote virtual gaming system, to ensure remote player appeal. For<br>
surveillance purposes, an entire card table is typically acquired on video tape using a single<br>
video camera. A remote virtual gaming system will typically require better video image<br>
quality or more than one video camera to be deployed' at each card table to capture what is<br>
happening at each live player's station. Consequently, superior quality video data is made<br>
available for surveillance, for either on-line or off-line purposes, thereby improving the<br>
surveillance system effectiveness. Note that disputes between casinos and customers can<br>
expose casinos to unfavorable publicity and even to litigation. Many of these disputes are<br>
currently resolved, both in and out of court, using the casino's existing surveillance video<br>
tapes and disks. VHS recorders from Panasonic, RCA, Sony and others are typically used.<br>
Disk farms from IBM, Loronics and others are typically used. Casinos are typically<br>
required by GCB regulations to continually record and retain the surveillance video' tapes<br>
for a period of one week, after which they may be erased and reused. This disclosure makes<br>
these video tapes a more valuable casino asset by productizing each game episode into a<br>
reusable multimedia gaming episode content. However, it is noted that due to privacy,<br>
confidentiality and security considerations, the faces and other identifying features of<br>
individual ad-hoc live players cannot typically be replayed, unless the casinos have prior<br>
authorization to do so.<br>
Casinos often have individuals on their payroll, called shills, or house players or<br>
celebrities under contract, who play various card games such as Blackjack or other games<br>
such as Roulette and Craps to generate gaming "excitement" on the casino floor to attract<br>
visiting prospective casino players. The present invention extends this legal activity of<br>
these hired players by having one or more house gaming tables completely reserved for<br>
these skilled professional house players or for celebrities hired for this purpose. These<br>
legally-authorized games are then electronically acquired on multimedia video and<br>
electronically routed to the remote player stations, on-site or off-site via the distribution hub<br>
34. Indeed, the live players at these house tables could be world-class card players,<br>
tournament poker players, and other professional game players. Since these house players<br>
are employed by the casinos and are not independent live players, the casinos do not lose<br>
money at these live restricted house-only tables, nor are they exposed to privacy issues.<br>
Play at these restricted tables is an "entertainment show" designed to stimulate the visiting<br>
casino player's enthusiasm and reduce their nervousness or fear for playing at the various<br>
table and other games offered by the casino.<br>
Moreover, the games at the live house tables can also be played in a closed "secure"<br>
casino-controlled environment, recorded and then autonomously randomly selected and<br>
routed to the remote player stations. These legally randomized recorded games can also be<br>
sequentially routed to remote player stations, provided there is no possibility of a "sting"<br>
situation in which the gaming episode encrypted multimedia video signal can be intercepted<br>
and the game outcome can be either modified or substituted for. This invention enables a<br>
i licensed casino to become a video gaming content provider with content which is (almost<br>
automatically) certified by a governmental agency such as the Nevada Gaming Control<br>
Board (NGCB) at the point of creation. This multimedia video gaming content product is<br>
conceptually similar to that produced by the movie/TV entertainment industry, which<br>
produces and records video entertainment content for sale to audiences. Indeed, this<br>
disclosure further blurs the distinction between the gaming and entertainment industries.<br>
In order to conduct a legally certified game, a governmentally licensed and regulated<br>
casino is liable and responsible for ensuring that each of their games is executed "fairly" by<br>
their house employees, such as card dealers, in a procedurally predefined manner within a<br>
published set of rules. Any changes to a certified game, such as procedural changes, look-<br>
feel changes and pay table changes, require recertification by a appropriate governmental<br>
gaming control board such as those found for example in Nevada (NY), New Jersey (NJ),<br>
Illinois (III.), Wisconsin (WI), Michigan (MI), Colorado (CO), Mississippi (Miss.),<br>
Louisiana (LA), and the various Native American nations.<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of a remote gaming system 150 which is on the<br>
premises of a casino or which is otherwise monitored by the security/surveillance<br>
department of a casino. As in FIG. 1, a number of video camera systems and microphone<br>
arrangements as represented by reference characters 152, 154, are provided in a multimedia<br>
virtual gaming content acquisition array 156 to monitor various respective casino games<br>
160, 162 in a multimedia content generator array 164. In this context, a disk or tape<br>
playback farm 170 is provided, as previously disclosed as part of a multimedia content<br>
playback array 172 to both record video signals and to subsequently randomly playback pre-recorded<br>
video signals. The output signals of the video acquisition array 156 and the<br>
playback array 172, are provided to a communication hub and switcher arrangement in a<br>
multimedia virtual gaming content episode packaging and distribution system 176 which<br>
includes a video swkch/distributor/selector and digitizer 178 such as a video switch<br>
commercially provided by Maxim, Analog Devices, or Elantec. The video<br>
switch/distributor/selector and digitizer 178 includes a legally approved autonomous<br>
random number generator (RNG) for selection of one of a plurality of video sources or<br>
prestored episodes, the signals from which are transmitted to a virtual gaming episode<br>
player presentation and participation station array 180 which includes a number of remote<br>
.player stations, typically shown as 182, 184, 186, through secure authorized direct<br>
connections or secure virtual private network (VPN) connections, as previously illustrated<br>
in FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 3 is a simplified schematic block diagram of a simplified remote gaming<br>
system 200 for use within premises controlled by a casino. An acquisition system 202<br>
includes an analog video camera system 204 and microphones 206, 207 provide signals<br>
from a live regulated game 208 to a digitizer, compression, and encryption module 210<br>
which, if necessary, converts the analog camera video and audio signals with a digitizer<br>
from, for example, Analog Devices or Maxim, to a digital format. Compression is done, for<br>
i example, with MPEG2 standard compression chip sets provided by C3 Microsystems or<br>
Zoran or equal. Encryption is dons with chip sets and firmware from RPK, or Cylink or<br>
Phillips or equal. The multimedia video and audio data arc provided through a secure<br>
physical communication pathway 214, fabricated from fiber-optic or coax or power cable or<br>
wireless link, to a player terminal 216, which is part of a presentation and participation<br>
system 218, for appropriate decryption, decompression and then presentation on a display.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates the importance of data security in practicing the present invention.<br>
Casino management and the governmental regulatory agencies arc very concerned with<br>
electronic intruders tapping into the casino communication network and manipulating any<br>
player terminal, including a slot machine, to fraudulently declare a jackpot. This type of<br>
intrusion could be done with or without collusion by casino employees. Consequently, all<br>
communication datalinks are encrypted wild triple DKS encryption, RSA (public key<br>
exchange) encryption, or other approved secure encryption means Otherwise the entire<br>
system is impractical and undeployable, because it will not be approved by governmental<br>
agencies. Prior to encryption, the video data has an appropriate identification (ID) attached<br>
such as, for example, a "product source watermark" incorporating the casino/table ID, for<br>
example. A date/time and video frame ID may also be inserted to provide an additional<br>
level of tamper-proofing. As no:cd earlier, the video data is then compressed using, for<br>
example, J/MPEG, wavelet, or any other proprietary' but GCD approved techniques. It can<br>
net be overemphasized that the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCD) will not license a<br>
player station which lacks an adequate level of secure communication, utilizing encryption<br>
based protection.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a simplified display layout 250 for a player interaction screen shewn<br>
or: the video monitor of player stations as shown in FIGS. I, 2 and 3. Starting at the bottom<br>
of this Figur;, a display area 252 displays the player credit balance of SXXXX. Above this<br>
is shown a display area 254 for a simple pay table 2x which means that. for every one dollar<br>
wagered, a remote player can win two dollars. Above that a screen area 256 presents the<br>
result in collars wen. Above that a .screen area 258 .shows the actual amount<br>
wagered and the particular player number (Pit) selected. When the selected game is in<br>
progress, the screen display area 260 at the top end of the player station display, displays the<br>
live or secure pre-recorded video episode image stream, preferably at the eye level cf the<br>
remote player. This remote player station can be floor mounted r wall mounted or a<br>
5 handheld portable, -subject to GCB approvul. Note that wall mounted player stations arc<br>
particularly attractive because of their space and cost effectiveness. Indeed video gaming<br>
stations currently deployed in casinos could also be repackaged in a wall mountablc version.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a remote gaming system 300 suitable for use with player stations<br>
10 which are off-the-premises of the casino and therefore beyond the immediate reach of the<br>
physical security- personnel of the casino. A content creation and acquisition system 302<br>
provides multimedia video information from various game specific cameras 304, 306, 308,<br>
provided to a content distribution server array 310 which includes an authorized Internet<br>
communication server 312 within casino premises or within casino-controlled premises.<br>
15 The server 312 provides image processing to enhance the raw images from the video<br>
sources by creating synthetic video images using image enhancement techniques. The<br>
synthetic video images are data compressed and are transmitted at a much smaller bit rate<br>
than the incoming game related multimedia camera video signals through an authorized<br>
Internet portal 314 located in a sovereign state or Native American territory with a low<br>
20 speed, e.g. 28.8 Kbps, modem. Encryption is also provided for secure transmission through<br>
the authorized Internet portal 314 to a remote player station 316. The server 312 also<br>
provides an encoded display (ED) signal to display, for example, the image of a five of<br>
diamonds playing card, prestored at the remote player station as illustrated in FIG. 6. Thus,<br>
rather than transmitting the image of a "five of diamonds", an encrypted digital word<br>
25 representing the "five of diamonds" is transmitted over the regulated Internet or other<br>
gaming related virtual private network. For example, the four suit of cards are encoded as<br>
hearts (11), diamonds (10), clubs (01), spades (00) in the two right most LSD's. The<br>
thinccn cards arc encoded as four higher order bits, thereby resulting in a 6 bi: code<br>
(010110) providing a binary1 representation of "five cf diamonds". This binary code;s then<br>
30 encrypted using DES, for example, resulting in a much larger word length that is then<br>
distributed or otherwise utilized by the disclosed secure regulated gaming system.<br>
Thus, by using real-time image processing techniques to geneiate encoded video, the<br>
video data stream from each of the live games is processed in real-time to generate and<br>
35 remotely display the progress and outcome of each of the ongoing games. For instance, as<br>
previously mentioned, the cards played in a card game car. be identified via image<br>
processing at each live player's scat at a casino table and then transmitted to the remote off-<br>
casino site player earning station in real-time. By encoding the current status, progress and<br>
outcome of each game (e.g., via image processing) at the live player's gaming station in the<br>
casino, the video communication bandwidth required from the virtual private network or<br>
Internet is significantly reduced. This type of image processing can also be used to enhance<br>
the utility of the current casino video surveillance tape with a 7-day archive requirement,<br>
imposed by the GCB of various states, such as Nevada, Colorado, and New Jersey.<br>
FIG. 7 shows a RNG array based game distribution system 320. The remote<br>
terminal #K 322 or #K1 324 located on-site or off-site are connected via a secure Internet<br>
326 or a secure virtual private network (VPN) 328. A secure Internet portal 330 and the<br>
VPN head end 332 is co-located with the high performance computing array based server<br>
334. A multiprocessorarray 336 embedded in the server 334 generates a vector of random<br>
numbers 338, that are generated using RNG's that have been certified by the appropriate<br>
GCB. The multiprocessor array can be a multiprocessor board from Mercury Computer<br>
Systems or Sky Computer or Alacron or Analog Devices or equal. Each of remote<br>
terminals 322, 324 receives one of the encrypted random numbers and interprets it to<br>
generate the game outcome in conjunction with the particular game selected by the remote<br>
player. The available games can be built into the remote terminal player station 322, 324, or<br>
can be inserted via a cartridge 340 into the player station. This architecture is similar to<br>
conventional standalone video gaming terminals except that the RNG is located at a<br>
centralized multiprocessor based distribution server, rather than at each individual player<br>
station. The game related video does not have to be sent down from the distribution server<br>
334, but can be locally stored and retrieved based on the specific random number received<br>
by the remote terminal player station 322, 324. However, in the Internet segment of this<br>
architecture, the selected game can also be downloaded from the server to the player station,<br>
using JAVA or equal software technology, subject to GCB approval.<br>
A new generation of games based on receiving a multiple set of random numbers<br>
sequentially can be designed and implemented by those skilled in the art. Note that the<br>
remote player station 322, 324 cannot be readily tampered with to declare a false win,<br>
because the distribution server 334 "knows" all the random numbers that were generated.<br>
Moreover, this random number distribution architecture is very reliable and efficient and is<br>
directly adapted to wide area progressive gaming with several roving jackpots.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a remote gaming system 350 which provides player authentication<br>
from a remote player terminal site through communication links such as, for example, from<br>
a regulated Internet portal located in a territory, such as a sovereign state or Native<br>
American territory. For remote, otherwise "insecure'.' gaming stations outside of a casino,<br>
such as, for example, hotel/mote! rooms or convenience stores, the present invention<br>
requires that-the player activity at each of these remote gaming stations be continuously<br>
monitored and recorded at periodic intervals, such as every five seconds,.subject to GCB<br>
concurrencc, with a return path multimedia video-camera/audio channel. Other techniques<br>
such as, for example, biometricrfingerprints/rctina, driver's license pictures, and credit cards<br>
arc also employed to ensure that, at all times, each individual player at a remote otherwise<br>
"insecure" site is of a legal age (e.g., over 21). Variants of the "V" chip, which arc currently<br>
used in consumer TV sets from RCA, Sony ar,d others, and which enable parents to control<br>
the access by underage individuals, can also be gainfully employed as an additional<br>
protective measure in a "layered defensive" access control implementation strategy.<br>
Additionally, the display device can be monoscopic or stereoscopic head-mounted goggles<br>
that restrict viewing to the wearer. Other restrictions that could be promulgated include<br>
prohibitions on underage individuals being within 12 feet of the player station with stiff<br>
penalties (e.g., $10K) for violation, including imprisonment, for example, for one year. A<br>
GCB will not approve or certify any off-site remote player station without a player<br>
eligibility verification feature that is not susceptible to deception by the player and/or his<br>
cohorts. Thus the off-site room (e.g., hotel room) must be instrumented with additional<br>
cameras and other sensors (e.g., motion detection) to ensure that only eligible individuals<br>
are in the proximity of the player station in the room.<br>
The remote gaming system 350 of FIG. 8 includes a content generation 351 and<br>
acquisition array 352 which includes a plurality of video camera systems with microphones<br>
354, 356, which monitor a plurality of corresponding live games 358, 360. llie video and<br>
audio information is fed to input terminals of a distribution server 362 which includes an<br>
authorized Internet gaming portal server 364 located in a sovereign state or Native<br>
American territory, which provides digitization, video/audio streaming, data compression,<br>
and data encryption. The gaming distribution server 364 is, for example, a 400 MHz dual<br>
redundant Pentium II with 128 MB of SDRAM, 32 MB of display RAM from Intel or Sun,<br>
or NEC or Sony or equal, a TCP/IP or other appropriate protocol stack, a video Codec from<br>
Intel, Analog Devices or equal, a compression chip set from C3 Micro, Zoran or equal, and<br>
an encryption chip set from a DES and/or a RSA licensee. Downloaded data is sent through<br>
an authorized Internet pathway 366 at, for example, a I MB/sec rate to a presentation and<br>
participation module 370 which includes a remote licensed player station 372. Uploaded<br>
data is sent through the authorized Internet 366 at, for example, a reduced 10 KB/scc rate<br>
back to the server 364. The player station 372 provides player information back to the<br>
server 364. The player station 372 thereby provides a game display and a player<br>
touchscreen. The player station also decrypts and decompresses data. A biometrics sensor<br>
module 374 exports face, eye, and/or vcice information packet, from a video camera system<br>
176 to the player station 372 for transmission to the gaming server 364. The player station<br>
also provides the gaming server 2 64 with driver's license related bar coded information<br>
using a Symboltcch, r: eon:!I, 2D bar code system, a digital identity card using Drexler<br>
technology, or equal, and finpe: print data frnrr. Digital Privacy, or equal, for exnmple.<br>
Casino floor space is one of the most expensive kinds of developed real estate,<br>
ranging in price from $1000 per square foot and on up. Consequently, utilization of wall<br>
space, for example, along corridors, for player gaming stations is an important embodiment<br>
of the present invention. With GCB approval, an entire remote player station can be built<br>
into appropriate walls of a casino, for example, along corridor walls with the "attract" mode<br>
of the player station being active. Both conventional video gaming play stations and the<br>
multimedia player gaming stations according to the present invention can be implemented in<br>
a wall-mounted configuration, using flat panel displays (FPD)s from Sony, Panasonic, NEC,<br>
Hitachi, or equal. Physical layer connectivity is provided by cable either imbedded in the<br>
walls or along the lower edge of the wall at floor level. This is important from a cost<br>
perspective because it enables existing casino facilities to be economically retrofitted to<br>
accommodate a remote player station according to the present invention. Digging<br>
underground passages for cables and conduits on an existing casino floor is very disruptive<br>
and expensive. An alternative to using cables is to use secure wireless communication<br>
components from Harris, Texas Instruments, QualComm, Philips, or equal. Note that the<br>
implementation of the player station front panel as disclosed, for example, in FIG. 3 is<br>
further simplified by using "cashless" wagering with no coins or bills and using only credit<br>
cards, smart cards, or other casino-issued cash equivalent.<br>
FIGS. 9-12 diagrammatically illustrate an example of one embodiment of several<br>
elements of a remote player interface for a remotely-located player station.<br>
FIG. 9 diagrammatically shows an electromechanical acceptor-validator subsystem<br>
400 for a video display station. This subsystem physically handles inputting and outputting<br>
money and money equivalents to the system by a remote player. This subsystem includes,<br>
for example, four generic physical input and output ports. A coin slot 404 accepts or<br>
dispenses coins, tokens, chips, or the like. A currency slot 406 accepts currency. A card<br>
slot 408 receives cards, such as credit cards, debit cards, smart cards, or the like for debiting<br>
and crediting money to a remote player's account. Note that the player is paid back in the<br>
same currency denominations and currency type that was originally inserted into the remote<br>
player station. This currency matching procedure is necessary to comply with the federal<br>
(IRS) and state anti-laundering laws (e.g., NV Reg. 6). A coupon slot 410 is provided so<br>
that, if the payout amount is large, then the casino typically prints out a coupon that can be<br>
converted to cash at the casino cashier's cage. Note that the computer/terminal at the<br>
cashier's cage is linked to the casino hotel/VIP server and the player accounting server,<br>
which in tum is linked to the remote player stations, to ensure ease of authentication and<br>
regulatory compliance.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a touch-sensitive area 420 of a video screen for a remote player<br>
station. The touch-sensitive area 420 includes a number of smaller touch-sensitive selection<br>
areas, called action buttons. As described below, action buttons are touched by a player to<br>
select certain game functions.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates a video presentation and response screen area 430 which displays<br>
various video responses and/or graphic presentations by the system to the action buttons.<br>
The multimedia video presentation can also be provided by using head mounted<br>
monoscopic or stereoscopic (3D) goggles, such as those available from Kaiser Aerospace, or<br>
equal, particularly if they enhance the virtual gaming experience for younger, age 21 to 35,<br>
players. Moreover, head mounted goggles restrict unauthorized access to gaming and<br>
enhance player privacy (e.g., win/loss and net credit balance is hidden from passers by.<br>
Furthermore, by incorporating a miniature camera to within the head mounted goggle<br>
assembly to acquire an image of the remote player's retina also enables the player<br>
accounting server 42 of FIG. 1 to periodically authenticate the player, as noted earlier in<br>
FIG. 8.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a number of action-step balloons, labeled (nA) which arc used to<br>
represent various sequential steps followed by a remote player in the operation of the remote<br>
player station. A remote player touches the action buttons shown in FIG. 10 to make his or<br>
her selections. FIG. 11 shows a number of response-step balloons, labeled (nR) which<br>
indicate corresponding system responses to the action-step balloons (nA), where these<br>
system responses are displayed on the video presentation and response screen area 430 of<br>
FIG. 11. This representative action (A), response (R) sequence is shown in FIG. 11 the<br>
logical design process for facilitating player friendly interaction to enable those skilled in<br>
the art to implement other possible game presentation sequences.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 9, 10, 11, 12, a typical play sequence is described, as follows:<br>
First, in activity step 1A, the remote video player initially inserts money, in an<br>
acceptable form, such as coins, bills, or credit card, or smart card, or "cashless" player<br>
tracking card, into one of the respective slots 404-410 in the electromechanical acceptor-<br>
validator subsystem 400 of FIG. 9 to establish the remote video player's creditworthiness<br>
and age eligibility, that is, over age 21, based on his possession of the appropriate data on a<br>
legally issued card". Note that this does not preclude insertion of stolen or otherwise<br>
unauthorized cards by a dishonest player. In the corresponding response step 1R, the<br>
system responds by having a presentation and response screen area 450 display the remote<br>
video player's current credit balance in a credit balance area 451.<br>
Sccond, in activity stcp.2A, a remote player touches one of the action buttons in<br>
another touch-sensitive subaica 452 of the video screen. These action burtons include, for<br>
example, a roam button 460, a card game button 462, a dice burton 464, a roulette wheel<br>
button 466, or a button for any other game offered by a licensed gaming property. In<br>
response step 2R, the presentation screen responds, for example, with an appropriate live or<br>
pre-recorded multimedia video episode package in a response screen area 470. When the<br>
roam action button 460 is selected, the remote video player gets a video tour of the entire<br>
casino property. A specific gaming area is selected by touching the respective card, dice, or<br>
wheel buttons 460-466 in step 2A concurrently. Below the roam button 460, the live button<br>
472 enables the remote player to view the ongoing live game type selected. Otherwise, a<br>
playback speed control mode is active and the playback viewing rate can be accelerated cr<br>
de-accelerated, as selected by the remote player with a playback speed slider 474. By de-<br>
accelerating the presentation rate of the "playback" mode, the remote player can reduce the<br>
level of stress. Note that casinos expect their card dealers to average about 50 card games<br>
per hour; this can be very stressful, particularly for a novice player sitting down at a live<br>
casino table.<br>
Non-gaming related selections shown in the alternative screen area 480 in FIG. 10<br>
are activated by double-clicking the roam button 460. Optionally, this casino specific tour<br>
includes various shops and entertainment shows available. Product and service purchases<br>
and show reservations can be made and persona! messages such as e-mail and voice-mail<br>
can be received and sent, using the touch screen display, if desired, by selecting E-<br>
cemmcrce related buttons 482, 484, and 486, respectively. As noted above, these choices<br>
arc visible only after double-clicking the ream button 460 of FIG. 10. A corresponding<br>
roam video stream is presented in a response screen area 470 of FIG. 11. Specific choices<br>
associated with E-commerce shopping, entertainment shows, and interactive messaging<br>
including even stock/commodity trading arc casino property management dependent and<br>
can be appropriately implemented subject to OCB concurrence. Double-clicking the roam<br>
button 460 also causes the caid button 462, ths dice button 464, and the roulette-whec!<br>
button 466 to be no lenger visible and therefore not selectable on the touch screen. Below<br>
the roam button 460, the live button 472 enables :he reinjtc player to view the ongoing live<br>
non-gaming activities offered by the casino property (e.g., trailer of available shows). The<br>
rate at which this multimedia video is displayed in the response screen 470 of FIG. 11, car.<br>
be controlled by the player, by adjusting the playback speed control slider 474, provided the<br>
live button 472 has not been previously selected.<br>
The primary purpose of "roaming" is to enatle the remote video player to decide<br>
what specific table number (#') and player number (?#), either live or pre-recorded, to<br>
wager on, either for or against the selected player. Typically, the identity of the five or pre-<br>
recorded player is not disclosed, visually or otherwise, because of privacy issues. However,<br>
the identity of the live or pre-recorded player may be disclosed, if the selected table/game is<br>
a game sponsored by the casino using casino employees, professional gaming invitees, cr<br>
celebrities such as, for example, the cast members from the movie "Casino" or "Rounders",<br>
depicting poker players. As a result of this roaming mode, a remote video player can<br>
choose to participate in one or more ongoing or pre-recorded, regulated gaming activities<br>
such as cards, dice/craps, roulette wheel, etc. Any new games introduced by the casino can<br>
also be seamlessly integrated into this disclosed system, by installing a multimedia video<br>
content acquisition sensor array to monitor any new live game.<br>
Third, in activity step 3A, the remote video player touches one of the action buttons<br>
in a touch-sensitive subarea 490 of the video screen. The action buttons in this area include<br>
an "any" action button 492 or a "specific" action button 494. The "any" action choice is<br>
simpler and directs the system to use certified random number generators (RNG) to<br>
randomly select an ongoing live or pre-recorded game in an autonomous manner and to<br>
present that game on the response screen area .170 of the player station and to present the<br>
table (T#)/pIayer (P#) in a response screen area 496. Moreover, a "simple" set-up button<br>
495 is also available, as a part of the above-mentioned "third" group (i.e., 3 A) of actions,<br>
thereby "setting up" all the subsequent choices for the novice player. For instance, the<br>
wager amount could be automatically set to the smallest allowable amount (e.g., SI.00), the<br>
lowest risk player would be selected (i.e., player #0), etc., as per 498 and 520 in FIG. 10.<br>
The selection of the "specif c" action button 494 requires the remote video player to<br>
also input a specific table (Tf/)/playcr (P#). The player first selects T# by repeatedly<br>
pushing a T# touch button 496 (hat causes the T# to be automatically indexed upwards, until<br>
the player stops at XX. Then the player selects the P# by repeatedly pushing a P# touch<br>
button 498 that causes the P# to be automatically indexed upwards, until the piaycr stops at<br>
YY. Note that piaycr #0 is the house/dealer. A response screen area 500 now displays a<br>
pay table 502, which shows what the remote video player will receive, if the live player (P)<br>
# on whom the wager is placed wins. Typically, wagering with the house (i.e., player #0),<br>
results in a significantly smaller w::i payback, for example 10%, whereas a win against the<br>
house, by any other player, is Typically "double your money back" or 100%. The pay Table<br>
502 on the screen informs :he remote video player, in advance, what can be gained o; lost, if<br>
a wager were to be made by him ::i a timely manner.<br>
The NV GCB considers each "distirict set uf "watering rules" with a corresponding<br>
"pay table" as a "distinct" game that must be separately "certified". Thus, even when one of<br>
the rules is changed with a correspending pay table change, rccertification is required. The<br>
following details the significantly simplified wagering rules for currently deployed casino<br>
floor games that arc played remotely, as per the present invention. Each variation is<br>
considered to be a separate game with a good example of variants being the numerous video<br>
poker variants. The disclosed novel wagering concept enables any current or future game<br>
that requires one or more "live players" (LP), to be included in this novel gaming paradigm.<br>
All current or future games, by definition1, entail at least one live player in a regulated casino<br>
environment. Therefore, this disclosure also includes these future games or other games not<br>
mentioned herein, because of the broad applicability of the disclosed simple but novel "for<br>
or against" wagering concept.<br>
In all cases, remote player station touch screens are implemented to enable a remote<br>
player to make wagers and decisions in a relatively stress-free and timely manner, as<br>
compared to the stress experienced by the live player at a table in the casino. As noted<br>
earlier, casinos train and expect the card dealer to deal about 50 games per hour in a<br>
procedurally correct manner, otherwise the "productivity" of the dealer comes under the<br>
close scrutiny of the casino floor supervisor.<br>
One important aspect of this invention is that it enables the "remote player' (RP) to<br>
place a wager on a "live player" (LP), thereby making the wagering decision simple, just<br>
like placing a wager, without serious thinking, in favor of one of two opposing teams or a<br>
particular horse in a horse race. Even a "one horse race with a time deadline" can be<br>
accommodated within this paradigm, and so can live slot gaming. Live player based<br>
wagering can be done for any card table game such as, for example, Blackjack, Multi-<br>
Action 21, Mini/Baccarat, Pai Gow, Caribbean Stud, 7 Card Stud, and Texas Hold'em.<br>
Simple "for or against" wagering can also be done on Craps, Roulette, and Slots. Those<br>
skilled in the art can also devise more complicated wagering schemes and the corresponding<br>
pay table odds, subject to player appeal and excitement generated.<br>
The remote player (RP) doesn't need to know the specific rules of the selected game<br>
that he wishes to virtually participate in. The remote player only needs to be lucky and/or<br>
smart enough to pick a live player on a winning streak. This wagering paradigm only<br>
requires "matching up" with or "wagering on" a specific live player. A simple pay table is<br>
2x, if the selected live player wins. If a remote player is diligent enough to learn the<br>
specific rules and play attentively, then the remote virtual player might as well play at the<br>
live gaming table, like a typical live player dows. Note that by playing a virtual game at a<br>
remote player station that can also be slowed down using slider 474, the novice player can<br>
reduce his anxiety of playing at a live table with others watching; this is the underlying<br>
instructional facet of this disclosure.<br>
Other simple wagering variants that do not always require "matching up" with a<br>
specific live player are disclosed in the following examples of simplified games which are<br>
variants of conventional casino games; the card game specific remote player input screens<br>
as in FIG. 10 must be appropriately designed, by those skilled in the an to accommodate<br>
these arc ether games not mentioned or detailed herein:<br>
Craps/Dice: DICE-MATCH (TM) or EASY-DICE (TM) - simply "match" the dice<br>
#: (A) Match totals: call 2 cr 12, pay 30x; call 3 or 11, pay 15x; call 4 or 12, pay lOx; call<br>
5 or 9, pay 6x; call 6 or 8, pay 4x; call 7 pay 3x, (B) Match BOTH dice: call "specific<br>
same" (e.g., l&amp;l, .... 6&amp;6), pay 30x; call "specific different" (e.g., 4 &amp; 6, 3 &amp; 5), pay 15x,<br>
(C) call "same", pay 3x; call "different", payback l.lx (i.e., net gain 10%).<br>
Roulette: BALL-MATCH (I'M) or COOL-ROLL (TM) - simply -match" the ball<br>
location (e.g., ff, or color, or odd #, or even #), pay winner as per usual Roulette pay table.<br>
Note that the remote player (RP) is discouraged from placing multiple/complicated wagers<br>
that a live player (LP) can place.<br>
Card games: CARD-MATCH (TM) - simply "match" the "live player (i.e. LP<br>
#0":dcaler) or associated card totals; (A) BJ/21 - BLACK-WHAMMY (TM) or EASY-<br>
JACK (TM), (B) mini-Baccarat, (C) Caribbean Stud, and (D) LET-IT-ROLL (TM). When<br>
wagering "for or against" the pay table is l.lx, if the live player #0 wins; note that all pay<br>
tables are subject to both casino and GCB concurrence.<br>
Slots: SLOT-MATCH (TM) - simply "match-up" with a particular live slot player<br>
on a winning streak, as per card games above. This game could have been included as a part<br>
of card games, as disclosed above, but has been separated out to emphasize its novelty. The<br>
remote player (RP) can concurrently wager on multiple (e.g., 3) live players (LP), who<br>
could be celebrities, for example, on slot machines at various locations on the casino floor.<br>
Th= remote station pay table can mimic that which is presented to the live player (l.P),<br>
subject to casino and GCD concurrence. Note that the remote gaming station disclosed<br>
herein also supersedes the currcntly-deployed single and multiple game video slot gaming<br>
station in all the licensed gaming establishments including casinos, because ali the functions<br>
in a video slot gaming station including multiple games, can also be implement on the<br>
disclosed remote virtual gaming player station.<br>
All the regulated games ottered by the casino, including those noted above, can be<br>
augmented by the disclosed simple berring rules: "for or against", thereby also encluding<br>
other relatively device players to participate in a live actual game, without all the attendence<br>
stress and embarrassment of actually sitting down at a casino table and making numerous<br>
real-time decisions. To enable this participation at an actual table, appropriate means can be<br>
provided to enable this "second tier" of remote players to: (a) view the ongoing game using<br>
mirrors or cameras and monitors, for example, from a seat overlooking the actual live table<br>
on the casino floor, (b) collect their wagers prior to the start of the game, and (c) give them<br>
their appropriate payout at the end of the: game. Note that casino player tracking or other<br>
cashless cards can be very useful in making this an efficient process in a live casino floor<br>
environment. This disclosed "second tier" gaming participation is particularly attractive to<br>
relatively novice players when the actual table has players who are either professional<br>
gamers or celebrities.<br>
This disclosed virtual gaming system provides that each and every regulated casino<br>
game that is transacted on the live casino floor can be recorded and subsequently<br>
distributed, or immediately distributed, after appropriate compression and encryption,<br>
thereby automatically creating copyrightable video content, similar to an episode or scene in<br>
a video movie product. Currently, all casinos in states such as NV, CO, NJ, Miss.,<br>
continuously record and retain gaming video material for a week to comply with<br>
surveillance regulations. The present invention provides for the reusability, repurposing,<br>
and branding of such casino generated video content. This invention provides casino games<br>
with very simple wagering rules and provides various regulatory and anti-cheating/theft<br>
measures such as encryption and watermarking. Practical distribution is facilitated using<br>
data compression. The quality of the virtual video is superior because, for example, a color<br>
image resolution of 640 x 480 pixels or better is used and the casino can also provide a 3-D<br>
perspective view of a game by utilizing multiple cameras, if required, for enhanced remote<br>
player appeal.<br>
Moreover, a "bonus jackpot" such as, for example, cash, or consumer product (such<br>
as, for example, appliances, autos, and homes) can be displayed in this screen area 470,<br>
thereby creating additional player excitement. This bonus jackpot can move randomly,<br>
using a certified server-based RNG, amongst the various player stations on the casino floor<br>
and also include the regulated off-site locations, such as a licensed bar or other licensed<br>
route locations. Note that the remote video player does not have to have the skill level<br>
required to maintain a winning streak, such as that required, for example, in Poker. Nor<br>
does the remote player even need to understand the rules of the game. In this system, the<br>
remote video player's, skill or luck occurs in selecting the specific live or pre-recorded<br>
player.<br>
Fourth, in activity step 4A, audio is selected in the touch-sensitive subarea 510 of the<br>
video screen. Specific audio is obtained from a specific table number (T#) using a specific<br>
action button 512. General audio is a conventional casino soundtrack, unrelated to a<br>
selected game and selected with the touch-sensitive subarca 514 of the video screen. The<br>
present invention also enables novice players to be instructed on how to play new or<br>
existing games in a relatively stress-free environment, using expert players. This virtual<br>
playing mode is more interesting than watching the currently-available instructional video<br>
tapes. The remote player stations could be put into an "instructional" mode for an hourly<br>
fee, if desired. This mode is selected using button 516 in FIG. 10. which provides the play-<br>
panel video for the selected table game, an instructional audio track, and superimposed<br>
video captioning.<br>
Fifth, in activity step 5A, a selection is made in the touch-sensitive subarea 520 of<br>
one of a number of action buttons indicating the dollar amount of a wager. This amount is<br>
consistent with the remote video player's available credit 451 and with the house wagering<br>
limits. The portion 430 of the video screen continues to show the gaming action for the<br>
selections made. In particular, the player can see whether a game is: (a) in progress 526<br>
and no wagers can be accepted, (b) the outcome 500 of the last game: "win-or-lose" and the<br>
corresponding pay table 502, if the remote player had placed a wager, or (c) a flashing<br>
"wager now" message 528, letting the remote player know that wagers arc still being<br>
accepted, prior to the start of the next virtual game.<br>
The remote player can bot, either "for or against", the live or pre-recorded player. As<br>
a result, the skill level of the remote video player is comparable to that required of a<br>
conventional slot machine player and can be considered to be a "no-braincr". There is no<br>
unique game related decision making learning curve, anxiety, time or peer pressure<br>
associated with any game, old or new. The pay table 502 for winning a game is as per the<br>
casino published pay table, as pre-approved by GCB. One possible pay table, for this<br>
simple wagering disclosed herein, is to double the player's bet — if the selected live player<br>
wins, that is, for a $10 bet, $20 is paid. However, if the player bets that the house-dealer<br>
(i.e.. player #0) will win, then the player's payback is only "110% of the bet", that is, for a<br>
$10 bet, $ll paid if the dealer wins. A remote licensed multimedia secure player station<br>
with a such as a simple pay table and wagering decision is an important aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
More complex wagering schemes are also supported by the presentation screen<br>
although these extend the simple wagering concept advanced by the present invention.<br>
More sophisticated ar.d professional gamblers may choose to play with the usual complex<br>
wagering and playing rules, which can be activated by pushing an additional 'Complex"<br>
button curing the above-mentioned "second" group of remote video player actions<br>
However, the presentation screen for each game becomes as complex as the usual live<br>
casino games. Moreover, this "complex wagering" button disclosure still contributes<br>
sevcra! novel concepts including (a) game pre-recording/branding, (b) secure game<br>
distribution, (c) random game presentation (e.g., prevents.card counting and team play,<br>
which is discouraged by NV casinos). '<br>
Sixth, in activity step 6A, a remote video player signals that hs or she wishes to play<br>
in the next regulated virtual game by activating the play action button 524 in the touch-<br>
sensitive subarea 522. Subsequently, the remote video player only pushes the play action<br>
burton 524 in a timely manner before the in-progress light 526 in a viewing area 528 comes<br>
on. The credit balance 451 in the response screen area 450 is automatically updated at the<br>
end of each game to display the remote video player's current credit balance.<br>
A remote video player can stop playing and can leave the remote player station at<br>
any time by pushing a cash out action button 525 in the touch-sensitive subarea 522. The<br>
player is paid back in the same denomination and currency type that was originally inserted<br>
into the player station, to comply with the federal and state anti-laundering money laws. If<br>
the payout amount is large, then the casino can print out a coupon at the player station that<br>
can be converted to cash at the cashier's cage.<br>
The off-site remote player station is packaged at the same security level or better<br>
than a business safe or a bank ATM machine and includes an audible alarm to make it<br>
significantly tamperproof and to satisfy the certification requirements of government<br>
gaming agencies. The touch screen is spill and shatter proof. Note that remote video player<br>
stations which are on the premises of the casino are closely monitored by casino security<br>
personnel as required by the GCB, unlike the off-site remote video player stations, which<br>
therefore need additional protection measures to be incorporated, as disclosed herein.<br>
Slot jackpot winners typically have the opportunity to win a bonus jackpot such as a<br>
car, a vacation, and other products. The remote video player stations can also display in<br>
screen area 470 of FIG. 11, a roaming bonus jackpot that moves from station to station to<br>
thereby serve as an advertising banner similar to those typically displayed on the Internet.<br>
Since all the player stations are controlled by the gaming content<br>
distribution/communication hub (34), the jackpot can also be a progressive jackpot, either<br>
within a casino or amongst several casinos, via a virtual private network (VPN), subject to<br>
GCB approval.<br>
FIG. 12 shows the baseline piayer actions and the corresponding player station<br>
responses in a logical sequence for one embodiment of a player station graphical piayer<br>
interface (GPI) as illustrated in FIGS. '). 10, 11 and 12. Those skilled in the art can devise<br>
other player-friendly interaction schemes based on any other logical '"action-response"<br>
sequencc that may be preferred, because of the nature of the regulated virtual games being<br>
ottered or the skill level and demographics of the anticipated players. For instance, another<br>
button can be added to enable the virtual player to accelerate or slow down the time per<br>
game in the prestored mode of play. Those skilled in the art realize that cluttering up the<br>
5 player station with too many choices and displays will only serve to discourage the "novice"<br>
virtual player from playing.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates tluec concurrent games in the upper portion of the video response<br>
area, as might be played by an intermediate level gambler. The action and response sieps<br>
) are similar to those illustrated in FKiS. 9, 10, 11 and 12 for only one game. The<br>
juxtapositioning of these apparently dissimilar games, illustrates the disclosed wagering<br>
similarity between these three different panics, as provided on a remote player station.<br>
Displaying the games in this manner is intended to facilitate adjustment of a player's mental<br>
frame of reference and learning curve to that of a typical relaxed slot player. A remote<br>
i video player makes selections using the action buttons on the touch-sensitive screen. The<br>
system responds such that the presentation and response screen area provides a video<br>
response. A typical remote video player operates an action button on the video display<br>
console with an activity step (tiA) that produces a corresponding respon.se (nR). As<br>
illustrated in the left side of FIG. 13, an activity step (nA) produces a corresponding<br>
response step (nR).<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates a Black Jack (BJ) game, a crap dice game, and a roulette game.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates an important feature of the present invention, which is that a<br>
remote virtual video player, particularly a younger one, a: an intermediate skill level, can<br>
concurrently play several dissimilar games on the same gamine station; variants of this<br>
feature could be referred to as "game within a game." This type of multiple concurrent<br>
gaming is enabled by the disclosed simplicity of the wagering rules. The remote video<br>
player can virtually roam around a casino and participate in a plurality of games thai arc jus:<br>
beginning, without leaving his rcrnoie gaming station seat. The player can a'.so purchase<br>
products and entertainment shows, while in the roaming mode, without leaving his sea:.<br>

a casino and are physically controlled by the casino security staff. Off-site locations arc at<br>
licensed locations not physically controlled by thi casino, such as, for example, bars, adult<br>
clubs, card rooms, and licensed convenience stores. An initialization block 602 in FIG. 14<br>
shows virtual gaming system operation beginning with a system power-up, initialization,<br>
and diagnostics process for the casino virtual gaming control center.<br>
A decision block 604 in FIG. 14 receives information to determine whether a live<br>
player has actually sat down to play at a remote play station #K. If no live player has sat<br>
down at the remote player station ?K, the system as per block 606, assembles or otherwise<br>
builds a "screen saver" type of multimedia packet for transmission to the remote play station<br>
#K. At the remote play station #K, a "screen-saver" mode is activated to present<br>
periodically updated advertisements or other special offers and to 'attract attention" of<br>
potential players, using, for example, special-offer ads. This process is executed for all<br>
stations: l,.... K, .... N.<br>
If a live player has sat down at the remote play station UK, then the decision block<br>
604 terminates the "attract attention" mode and initiates the player housekeeping mode<br>
block 605 which perform various system housekeeping functions. One of these functions is<br>
tracking a player's gaming profile through communication links to a player accounting and<br>
tracking module 608. Another function is authentication of a remote video player's<br>
financial and age eligibility using, for example, biomerric data recorded on disks in a disk<br>
farm 610. Block 612 illustrates another function which is monitoring of the system for<br>
maintenance and dispatching of service personnel through a maintenance dispatch server<br>
system. These functional modules 608 and 610 reside within the player accounting server<br>
42 of FIG. 1.<br>
A decision block 614 of FIG. 14 determines if a player has newly "logged or." at fin<br>
off-site location, such as a sanctioned remote-player site connected to an authorized Interne:<br>
portal 52 of FIG. i. If the player has just logged c.-., a download block 616 causes a<br>
"streaming multimedia player", such as the cnes from Real Video, or Microsoft or Netscape<br>
or Lucent, or equal, to be downloaded, for example, through the regulated Internet portal 52<br>
or HG. 1 and installed at the remote player station iiK. This enable-; the remote video<br>
player to begin play.using a stream of coinpressec/encryLlcJ, video/audio multimedia<br>
gaming dala, being transmitted from the casino server 34 cf FIG. 1 through various types of<br>
distributed networks, including the regulated Internet 50 of FIG. i.<br>
A decision block 618 determines it the game to be played is live or pre-recorded. If<br>
the game is live, a certified autonomous RNG selector 620 is used to select output video and<br>
audio signals from a live video camera 622 in response to the choice of casinu game<br>
selected by the remote video player. Alternatively, an optional bypass 621 is used to<br>
directly select video and audio signals from camera 622, subject to GCB approval. If the<br>
game is pre-recorded, a certified autonomous RNG selector 624 is used to select video and<br>
5 audio output video signal from a multimedia video database 626, such as a secure disk, tape,<br>
CD or other storage media-based farm 96 of FIG. 1, where the virtual gaming episode data<br>
is compressed, encrypted, encapsulated and then pre-stored.<br>
In block 628 of FIG. 14 a compressed/encrypted streaming audio/video data packet<br>
is staged for routing via one of several possible communication pathways to the remote<br>
player station #K. In the download block 630, a selected multimedia video/audio data<br>
packet or a screen saver packet from block 606, as appropriate, is sent to the remote video<br>
player station #K from the casino virtual gaming server control center 34 of FIG. I.<br>
The remote player station block 632 of FIG. 14 illustrates the remote video player<br>
station #K first receiving, next dc-encrypting, and then de-compressing the data packet from<br>
the casino virtual gaming server control center 48 of FIG. ]. A decision block 634<br>
illustrates an authentication check of the off-site remote video player at the beginning of<br>
each game packet and periodically, for example, every 5 seconds using the pre-stored<br>
biometrics of the player, for example. The biometric data is provided, for example, as a<br>
video camera image of the player's face or retina (e.g., Sensar), fingerprint (c.g.. Digital<br>
Privacy), driver's license, credit card, signature, voiccprint (e.g., Lucent), or casino player<br>
rating/tracking ID card. If the authentication check fails at the player accounting server 42<br>
of FIG. 1, a block 636 provides that a session tcrmination-and-notification packet is<br>
generated and sent to the casino virtual gaming server control center 48 of FIG. 1 so that the<br>
session is immediately terminated and local security personnel arc informed and dispatched<br>
via messages to the surveillance server 26 of FIG. 1 as appropriate.<br>
If the off-site unauthorized remote video player is accessing the casino gaming<br>
facility via the authorized Internet portal 50 of FIG. 1. then it is very difficult to dispatch<br>
local security personnel to apprehend a violator in a timely manner. However, a practical<br>
remote off-site player authentication process for a casino can also require that a large (e.g.,<br>
$10,000) deposit or bond be posted at a neutral financial institution (i.e., a Bank) by the<br>
player, and that the deposit or bond is forfeited, if the biometrics authentication fails. To<br>
deter violations of gaming laws, additional criminal penalties including prison time and<br>
appropriate written waivers of legal rights can also be imposed. Gaming jurisdictions<br>
typically maintain that "gaming is a privilege and not a right". Prevention of underage<br>
gaming is a significant regulatory concern and typically requires continuous, unrestricted<br>
access by the regulators to any gaming related player station at any time. A 12-foot radius,<br>
for example, in front of the display can be monitored, using cameras and other electronic<br>
sensing means (e.g., motion detectors), to ensure that there arc no underage (less than 21)<br>
individuals present, at all times. Gambling addiction is another problem that the regulated<br>
and responsible gaming community wants to curb. Continuous periodic multimedia<br>
biometrics authentication, together with bond forfeiture is disclosed as a means of meeting<br>
regulatory requirements by a casino. Biometric data can be continuously recorded at the<br>
game distribution processing complex using, for example, return path camera video, thereby<br>
enabling violations to be detected and recorded on-line and then prosecuted successfully.<br>
Continuous video taping of casino gaming areas is already required by the NV/CO/NJ State<br>
GCB. Thus, video/biometric monitoring of the remote player cannot be construed as an<br>
"invasion of privacy".<br>
If the player is authenticated, a block 638 provides that the multimedia data stream is<br>
presented at the video display and speaker output pons of the player station UK, as per 54<br>
and 46 in FIG. 1.<br>
A decision block 640 of FIG. 14 illustrates monitoring of player input actions for a<br>
game when the player touches an action burton on the touch-sensitive screen as per FIG. 10.<br>
Player input action requests made via a touch screen at the remote play station are<br>
continuously monitored. Block 640 tests whether a player has made a game input action or<br>
not. If a game input action has been made, a block 642 provides for assessment of that<br>
specific game input and for a local response, within 54 or 46 of FIG. 1, as appropriate, or for<br>
transmission of information to the casino virtual gaming server control center 34 of FIG. 1.<br>
If various other action button on the touch-sensitive screen are touched, the block 640<br>
illustrates routing of that information to a block 644 which illustrates building of a<br>
command/status data packet. The block 644 also illustrates receipt of authentication failure<br>
information from the block 636.<br>
The block 644 of FIG. 14 illustrates that the player station 54 or 46 of FIG. I builds<br>
an appropriate time-stamped data packet which includes current: (a) game progress/results<br>
as per FIGS. 12, 13, (b) player inputs as per FIGS. 11, 13, and (c) biometrics authentication<br>
sensor array data 374 of FIG. 1. Note the contents of this data packet are also determined<br>
by the requirements of the player accounting server 42 of FIG. 1 at the particular casino<br>
property. Block 646-shows that this packet is then compressed using, for example, PKZIP,<br>
encrypted using, for example, DES128 (as per KV-GCB) or RSA (key exchange). Recent<br>
cryptocode breaking advances indicate that the RSA key may have to be 1024 bits or larger.<br>
A block 648 illustrates a transmit request and '.ransmission of an appropriate<br>
command/status packet for the remote vidtro player station UK. back to the virtual gaming<br>
distribution complex of the casino server control center 34 of FIG. 1.<br>
Block 650 of FIG. 14 shows that the casino virtual gaming server control center of<br>
FIG. 1 receives and decodes the command/status packet for the remote video play station<br>
#K. The command/status information is then processed by being cycled through the<br>
processes in the casino server control center, as previously described.<br>
Typically, all the secure communication pathways support bi-directional data<br>
packets that are asymmetric, that is, the forward path to the play station has a relatively high<br>
data rate of, for example, about 1 Mbps due to color video content. Whereas, the return path<br>
data rate is about 10 Kbps. However, the return path data rate can also be significantly<br>
greater, for example, if a video camera image of the player is continuously monitored for<br>
biometric authentication purposes.<br>
FIG. 15 in conjunction with FIG. 1 shows an exemplary protocol implementation of<br>
an intcrprocessor information transfer sequence, that is initiated by the remote player, when<br>
he sits down at the remote site player station 54 of FIG. 1. Biometric sensors 124 are<br>
immediately activated to collect appropriate biometric data and transfer a biometric data<br>
packet (650) to the player (e.g., VIP) accounting server (42) of FIG. 1 via the<br>
communication server (34) of FIG. 1, at appropriate (e.g., 5 second) intervals, as noted<br>
earlier. The accounting server (42) of FIG. 1 together with the possibly co-located casino<br>
hotel reservations/IP guest server 41 of FIG. 1 rapidly (e.g., within 5 seconds) authenticates<br>
the biometric data (650) by comparing it to prestored or other credit reference database and<br>
acknowledges the eligibility (e.g., age, credit) of the remote player (651). The<br>
authentication must be done rapidly and the newly seated player must be "entertained", for<br>
example, with the casino's daily special offer, while this is being accomplished, otherwise<br>
the player will get impatient and may walk away from the remote player station 46 or 54 of<br>
FIG. 1. If there is an eligibility failure, then an information package (652) is also forwarded<br>
to the security dispatch center via the surveillance server (26) of FIG. 1. This authentication<br>
may also include additional surveillance sensor information processing to ensure that no<br>
underage individuals are in the regulated vicinity of the remote-player station 46 or 54 of<br>
FIG. 1.<br>
Then, the remote player can roam and select a particular table (T#) and player (P#)<br>
and place a wager dollar amount, as described previously via FIGS. 9-12. FIG. 15 shows<br>
that the T#/P# information is captured by the communication server (34) of FIG. 1 to send<br>
out the appropriate randomized video/audio stream (661) and the wager information (662) is<br>
noted by the accounting server (42) of FIG. I to send out a wager acknowledgment signal.<br>
The duration of each card table game is typically 50 seconds, as noted earlier.<br>
Upon completion of the playback of the randomly selected video/audio stream (661),<br>
the win or loss result packet (670) of FIG". 15 can be determined by the remote station (54)<br>
or (46) based processor (100) and/or by the communication server (34), and/or the Internet<br>
Server (50) and/or by the player accounting server (42), as engineered by those skilled in the<br>
i art of FIG. 1. Note that FIG. 15 shows'the implementation, wherein the win or loss result<br>
packet (670) is determined by the remote processor (100) and then reported to the player<br>
accounting server (42) via the communication server (24) and/or Internet Server (50). The<br>
display (102) of FIG. 1 is appropriately updated with the game result (671) of FIG. 15, as<br>
shown. Note that the information packets between the various server processors arc<br>
typically encrypted and compressed, as shown. Moreover, the win/loss report (670) of FIG.<br>
15 first goes all the way back to the player (e.g., VIP) accounting server (42) of FIG. I, so<br>
that in the credit card or cashless mode of wagering, the credit balance can be appropriately<br>
updated. Similar information packet transfer diagrams can be specified and then<br>
implemented by those skilled in the art to describe the information transfer sequence, when<br>
the remote player is in the (a) roam mode prior to making a gaming related selection, or (b)<br>
roam mode associated with the casino sponsored E-commerce (38) of FIG. 1 related<br>
products and services preview, as depicted in FIG. 10.<br>
FIG. 16 shows the activation message (680) for the E-commerce product and<br>
services (P &amp; S) roam mode, which is forwarded to both the accounting (42) and the E-<br>
commcrce server (38) of FIG. 1, via the communication server (34) or Internet server (50)<br>
of FIG. 1. The E-commerce server (38) sends the P &amp; S video preview stream (681) of FIG.<br>
16 back to the remote station (122) of FIG. 1. The "relaxed" remote player (12) views the<br>
streaming multimedia P &amp; S video (2D or 3D) and makes a purchase decision (990), akin to<br>
putting an item in a virtual shopping cart. The player accounting server (42) of FIG. 1<br>
responds with a confirmation (691) of FIG. 16 of the buy decision, including a display (102)<br>
of FIG. 1 update at the remote player station on-site (46) or off-site (54) of FIG. 1. The<br>
multicomputer architecture facilitates the remote player to continue roaming (692) or to<br>
make additional buy decisions (693) as shown in FIG. 16. Note that the biometric<br>
authentication (652) is repeated every 5 seconds, or as per GCB directives. Also the E-<br>
commerce roam mode can be viewed indefinitely (682), but the eligible remote player<br>
casino policy can limit E-commerce roam time, if required.<br>
FIG. 17 provides a comprehensive business process functional block diagram of the<br>
disclosed multimedia virtual gaming method and system based on actual regulated casino<br>
games comprised of three main elements, namely, (a) content creation 700, (b) content<br>
distribution 800, and (c) content presentation 900.<br>
Gaming episode package content creation 700 consists of: (a) event generation 710,<br>
(b) acquisition of a series of "raw" episodes 720, and (c) gaming episode packaging 730.<br>
Gaming content distribution 800 consists of retrieval or staging from: (a) storage<br>
5 medium 810 of virtual gaming episodes' or direct feed of a live episode 820, (b) random<br>
episode selection based on a GCB certified RNG 830 or bypass 821, and (c) virtual episode<br>
package distribution 840. Note that near real-time delivered live episodes not susceptible to<br>
a "sting", may or may not be randomly selected, subject to GCB approval and casino policy.<br>
Moreover, content distribution 800, particularly via ilie regulated Internet Server (50) of<br>
1 FIG. 1, must be physically located in a sovereign state or Native American territory wherein<br>
Internet gaming is legally sanctioned.<br>
Content presentation 900 consists of a player station which provides for (a) casino<br>
property multimedia roaming and service selection/purchase, (b) presenting the selected<br>
virtual gaming episode, and (c) player authentication, in terms of biomctric and other player<br>
attributes, and (d) player participation in terms of cash or credit or cashless wagering. The<br>
physical implementation of the ATM-like tamper-proof player virtual gaming station 46 or<br>
54 of FIG. 1 is location dependent: versions include (I) casino floor, (2) casino wall, (3)<br>
casino hotel room, (4) off-site licensed facility (e.g.. restricted GCB license), such as a (a)<br>
bar, (b) mall, (c) convenience store (e.g., 7-11), (d) department store, (c) motel (lobby,<br>
rooms), and (4) GCB authorized route operator sites (e.g., diners, restaurants, truck stops).<br>
Content presentation may also have to be in a physical location wherein gaming is legally<br>
sanctioned, particularly if credit cards are used for watering purposes by the player. Note<br>
that GCB typically limits credit card losses on a per day basis, to deter problem gambling.<br>
Additionally, the present invention discloses economically and technically important<br>
synergistic information communication links to ancillary systems necessary to meet<br>
requirements from both the GCB and the casino, to: (a) the surveillance multimedia control<br>
system 960, (b) the player accounting and authentication system 910, (c) casino-sponsored<br>
K-commerce product-service buy/sell/convenience system (e.g., shops, shows, discount<br>
offers, services, messages, securities) 920, (d) casino-hotel reservation (VIP) system 930, (c)<br>
the security dispatch system, and (f) maintenance and diagnostics system, interconnected by<br>
secure communication pathways 750. 760, 850, and 950, as per FIG. 17.<br>

database. The pre-recorded videos are obtained from previously recorded casino security video or from closed regulated tourna-<br>
ment video recordings or from computer generated animations. The casino based multimedia source provides audio-video signals<br>
depicting various legally-authorized Jive casino games. An accounting subsystem manages the compensation, credit accounts, and<br>
authentication for a virtual player. An electronic or mechanical database distribution center connects the multimedia video source<br>
and the player accounting subsystem to a virtual player station. The virtual player station includes an appropriately secured display<br>
for displaying to the virtual player the multimedia video signal depicting the legally-authorized live casino game or a pre-recorded<br>
legally randomized casino game or the artificially generated pre-recorded game. The virtual player station also provides appropri-<br>
ately secured gaming information, which enables the legally authenticated (biometric or otherwise) virtual player to place a game<br>
episode outcome wager. The virtual player station also provides gaming information to enable the virtual player to receive a payout.<br>
Novel simplified wagering rules also enable the virtual player to bet either for or against the actual player depicted in each of the<br>
pre-recorded gaming episodes using either a live casino multimedia video signal or a restricted randomized casino multimedia game<br>
video from a pre-recorded storage medium. Pay table related</td>
