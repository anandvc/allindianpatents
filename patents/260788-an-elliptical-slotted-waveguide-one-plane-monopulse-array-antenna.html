				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION :<br>
This invention relates to mechanically scanned slotted waveguide array<br>
antennas and more specifically to multilayer elliptical resonant slotted waveguide<br>
one plane monopulse array antennas.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
High gain and efficient antennas form an integral part of any Radar<br>
utilised for ground as well as airborne applications. For airborne radar<br>
applications, the requirement for high gain, efficient and compact antennas is all<br>
the more high. These antennas could be of active as well as passive type.<br>
Active antennas employ active elements and have in-built transmit/receive<br>
modules for each of the radiating elements. Passive antennas do not employ<br>
active elements. These passive antennas can be categorised into reflector<br>
based antennas and planner phased arrays antennas. Planner phased antennas<br>
can be further categorised into electronically scanned arrays and mechanically<br>
scanned arrays. Among the mechanically scanned array antennas, waveguide<br>
slotted arrays have been attractive candidate for high efficiency planar array<br>
antennas as waveguide provides exceptionally low path loss. These arrays are<br>
known for their ruggedness, low loss and high power handling capability. This<br>
type of array generally use longitudinal off-set slot located on the broad wall of a<br>
rectangular waveguide as a radiating element, centered-inclined slot located in<br>
the common broadwall of two rectangular waveguides kept orthogonal to each<br>
other as coupling element, multilayer feeding structure comprising of a network of<br>
inclined coupling slots and corporate waveguide unequal power divider network<br>
along with monopulse comparator network..<br>
The major function of a monopulse slotted array antenna is to produce a<br>
pencil/fan shaped radiated beam of the desired polarisation, beam width, copolar<br>
side lobe levels, cross polar levels and gain at the sum port of the antenna<br>
over a desired band of operation. The difference port of the antenna gives a<br>
difference pattern of the specified beam width in a specified plane with a null at<br>
bore sight.<br>
Performance of a slotted array antenna with a low side lobe level depends<br>
on the accuracy with which individual radiating and coupling slots are<br>
characterised. The mechanical parameters for the radiating and coupling slots<br>
are determined after analysing the complex boundary value electromagnetic<br>
problems. Accurate theoretical and numerical analysis are required to achieve a<br>
high degree of accuracy in determining these parameters. A design<br>
methodology, based on extensive electromagnetic modelling using Method of<br>
Moments and Finite Element Techniques is used to meet the stringent electrical<br>
and mechanical requirements Computer aided design tools followed by<br>
computer controlled slot machining and suitable fabrication methodologies and<br>
joining processes are the key features for developing this kind of antenna.<br>
The weight, size and profile (compactness) of the antenna depends on the<br>
individual modules of the array like radiating and feeding waveguide dimensions,<br>
feeder network profile and monopulse comparator network. The mass production<br>
as well as production yield is an important issue related to the development of<br>
this class of antennas for designers/inventors all over the world. The complicated<br>
three dimensional structure with large number of modules arranged in multi<br>
layers, require a very high level of mechanical precision. It requires high<br>
accuracy of alignment in assembling different parts of antenna spread over<br>
different layers and perfects electrical contact at all the joins. At present, dip<br>
brazing and vacuum brazing technologies are used for manufacturing these<br>
array antennas.<br>
These array antennas and the methods for manufacturing the same are<br>
already known to the prior art. However, these array antennas and the methods<br>
for manufacturing the same suffer from following disadvantages.<br>
Main disadvantage of these array antennas, already known in the prior art<br>
is that these are not very compact, as these antennas utilise conventional three<br>
magic tees.<br>
Another disadvantage of these array antennas, known in the prior art is<br>
that manufacturing of these array antennas require very large infrastructure<br>
investment as these are manufactured by utilising costly dip brazing and vacuum<br>
brazing technologies.<br>
Still another disadvantage of these array antennas, known in the prior art<br>
is that these manufacturing of these antennas require highly skilled operations.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of these array antennas, known in the prior art<br>
is that Manufacturing of these antennas suffer from high rejection rate.<br>
Still another disadvantage these array antennas, known in the prior art is<br>
that these antennas suffer from high loss and low efficiency due to the<br>
accumulation of flux in the waveguide structures during the brazing operation.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The primary object of this invention is to provide an elliptical slotted<br>
waveguide one plane monopuse array antenna and a process for manufacturing<br>
the same.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an elliptical slotted waveguide<br>
one plane monopulse array antenna which can be utilised for several<br>
applications including maritime patrol air borne radar applications.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an elliptical slotted<br>
waveguide one plane monopulse array antenna which is very compact as it<br>
employs an improved feeder network incorporating waveguide with nonstandard<br>
dimensions 'having reduced height and one plane monopulse<br>
comparator network incorporating waveguide planar magic tee.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The multi layer slotted array antenna of the present invention comprises<br>
of about 50 radiating waveguides of dimensions 22.43 x 5.08 mm, stacked side<br>
by side to make an elliptical planar array of the radiating aperture size 1200 mm<br>
x 250 mm (max.). The non-standard radiating and feeding waveguide dimensions<br>
have been chosen in such a way that inter element spacing in both the<br>
waveguides (i.e. radiating waveguide and feeding waveguide) remains same.<br>
The entire aperture of the planar array is divided into 16 subarrays to get the<br>
required 400 MHz bandwidth. The radiating waveguides of each subarray are<br>
short circuited at both ends and an additional waveguide called feed guide<br>
passes perpendicular to and underneath radiating waveguides is used to feed<br>
the radiating waveguide via coupling slots (called first layer coupling slots or<br>
radiating guide feed slots). The coupling slots, one for each radiating waveguide<br>
are situated in the common broad wall of the two waveguides. These slots are<br>
spaced half a guide wavelength apart in the feeding waveguide and are<br>
alternatively inclined in opposite directions to achieve equiphase excitation from<br>
coupling slots to the radiating waveguides. These feed lines in turn are<br>
connected to the unequal power divider network through another layer<br>
waveguide containing second layer coupling slots which in turn connected to<br>
monopulse comparator network<br>
Referring to Fig (1), the antenna of the present invention comprises main<br>
sub-assemblies: radiating cavity plate (1), aperture cover plate (2), combined<br>
shield cover plate (3), power Ouision network (4), magic tee network (5) and<br>
folded short (6).<br>
Referring to Fig (2), the radiating cavity plate (1) contains 100 number of<br>
rectangular channels (7) (forming rectangular waveguides with one of their broad<br>
walls removed) of the dimensions (22.43 mm X 5.58 mm) sharing a common<br>
narrow wall (8) of thickness 1 mrn with each other. Out of 5.58 mm height, 0.5<br>
mm height (9) is used for the sealing purposes with the next assembly (2) giving<br>
actual internal waveguide dimensions of 22.43 mm X 5.08 mm after assembly.<br>
The broad walls (of thickness 1 mm) of 100 waveguides have 452 round corner<br>
rectangular slots (10) of the above dimensions and locations machined on it.<br>
Number of different types of taped holes (11, 12 &amp; 13) are provided at the cross<br>
over of rectangular channel narrow walls. This looks like as if number of<br>
rectangular waveguides are stacked side by side to make a planar aperture with<br>
one of the broad walls of these waveguides removed. A minimum of four<br>
miniature screw threads (14) provided for each waveguide channel to fix with the<br>
aperture cover plate (2). This forms the top (first) layer of the antenna.<br>
Referring to Fig (3), the aperture cover plate comprises a number of<br>
grooves (15) on one side of the plate with 100 number of round cornered<br>
centred-inclined slots (16) on a 1 mm wall. These grooves are to accommodate<br>
the sealing height (9) of the radiating cavity plate. The other side of the plate<br>
have 16 number of rectangular channels (17) made in such a way that these<br>
rectangular channels are perpendicular to the grooves of the other side of the<br>
plate. Number of different types of holes (through holes and counter bore) <br>
23) are provided to match with cavity and hinge brackets, threaded mounting<br>
pads (24-27) for integration with combined shield cover (3). This forms the<br>
second layer of the antenna.<br>
The radiating cavity plate (1) and aperture (2) cover plate are kept in such<br>
a way that a portion (9) of the narrow wall of the rectangular waveguide channel<br>
(8) of radiating cavity plate (1) sits in the groove (15) of the aperture cover plate<br>
(2) such that a common wall exists between two plates. In this arrangement, the<br>
rectangular waveguide channels of (1) and (2) are perpendicular to each other<br>
with a common broad wall where round cornered centred- inclined rectangular<br>
slots are located.<br>
Referring to Fig. (4) the combined shield cover plate (3) which is 1 mm<br>
thick sheet, is provided with about 1 mm wide and 0.3 mm .deep grooves (28)<br>
with suitable lugs (24-27) on one side of the plate to seal the rectangular channel<br>
(17) of aperture cover plate (2). The other face of the plate have sealing grooves<br>
(29) with number of suitable lugs with holes (24-27) to seal the power divider<br>
network (4), magic tee network (5) and folded shorts (6). The plate have a<br>
number of round cornered rectangular slots (30) as per location, orientation and<br>
dimension and folded short apertures (31) on the 1 mm wall.<br>
Referring to Fig. (5) Powei 'i.vision network comprises of two 1:8 unequal<br>
waveguide corporate power divo«r networks (32, 33). These power divider<br>
networks separately comprise tw 1:4 unequal power divider networks( 34, 35)<br>
and (36, 37) respectively connected through a 1:2 equal power divider networks<br>
38 and 39 of waveguide dimensions 22.43 x 5.38 mm. 0.3 mm height out of<br>
5.38 mm is utilizing in sealing with the surface groove 28 of the combined shield<br>
cover (3). This 1:2 equal waveguide power divider (38 &amp; 39) is septum based biplane<br>
tee junction. Septum 40 has been utilized to divide the incoming power into<br>
two equal parts. The length of the tee arm is kept in such a way that input of the<br>
1:4 power divider network (34 &amp; 35) receives same power both in amplitude and<br>
phase. The incoming signal in power divider (34) is divided unequally into two<br>
parts using septum (41) of dimensions 11.5 x 1.2 x 5.38 mm at said location. Two<br>
irises (42) are utilized to improve the input match along with two optimized Eplane<br>
bends (43, 44). The unequally divided signals using septum (41) is further<br>
divided into four unequal parts using septums (45) and (46). Number of irises<br>
(47, 48, 49, 50,51,52, 53 &amp; 54) are used to improve the overall input match of the<br>
power divider. As output locations (55, 56, 57 &amp; 58) of the power divider network<br>
(34 (typical) is fixed and has to match with the shielded cover inclined slot<br>
locations, number of E-plane bends (59, 60, 61, 62, 63 &amp; 64) are used. Different<br>
type of mounting lugs (65, 66 &amp; 67), distributed suitably to match with the<br>
corresponding lugs/holes of the shield cover (3) are provided to make the sealing<br>
with combined shield cover effective.<br>
Referring to Fig. (6), the planar magic tee network (5) is a two layer structure<br>
to provide monopulse capability for the array antenna. This two layer structure<br>
(68) consists of a H-plane waveguide tee junction (69) through a slot (70) to<br>
another waveguide (71) lying above and parallel to the main arm (72) of the biplane<br>
tee junction. The slot is located in the common broad wall of the two<br>
waveguides as per said dimensions and locations given. The upper waveguide<br>
(71) is fed from one end (73) and short-circuited to the other end at appropriate<br>
point (74). This waveguide will correspond to the difference arm of the magic<br>
tee. The other three magic tee ports (75, 76 &amp; 77) are located in the bottom side<br>
as shown. A septum (78) of the said dimension and location is used to divide the<br>
incoming power from the port (77) without affecting the coupling from the<br>
waveguide (71) to the waveguide (69) through slot (70). Two irises (79) and (80)<br>
are used to improve the input match of sum and difference ports. This two layer<br>
structure has to match suitably with power dividers (38) and (39). Different type<br>
of lugs/holes. (81,82) are provided for proper fixing and sealing with the power<br>
divider network.<br>
Referring to Fig. (7), when two first layer feed waveguides (17) meet end to<br>
end, there is not enough space for each waveguide to continue to a short circuit<br>
half a guide wavelength beyond tn« last slot. It is therefore necessary to fold the<br>
waveguide as shown in Fig (1) md create a short circuit at an appropriate<br>
distance equivalent to a half guide wavelength short circuit in a straight<br>
waveguide. The end folded short (83) and combined folded short (84) shown in<br>
Fig (7) are placed at appropriate places (85, 86) as shown in Fig (1).<br>
Referring to Fig. (8), The resonant planar array consists of parallel<br>
rectangular waveguides into which longitudinal - offset slots have been cut as a<br>
basic radiating element. The radiating slots (10) in each waveguide are spaced<br>
one half guide wavelength apart and are alternatively offset on opposite side of<br>
the waveguide centre line in order to have equiphase excitations. It requires<br>
coupling slots between radiating and feeding waveguide as feeding elements in<br>
addition to radiating slots.<br>
Referring to Fig. (9), a centered-inclined slot (16) located in the common<br>
broad wall of radiating and orthogonally placed feeding waveguide is the widely<br>
used coupling element because of its better off resonance behaviour. To get the<br>
required performance over a desired frequency band of operation, the entire<br>
aperture has been divided into number of sub arrays and each sub array is then<br>
connected to two layer unequal (unequal in amplitude but equal in phase)<br>
waveguide power divider network via inclined coupling slots. A monopulse<br>
compartor network forms a critical part of this antenna. This network extracts<br>
power from the two halves of the antenna to give a sum pattern and a difference<br>
pattern.<br>
Referring to Fig. (10), the coupling waveguides are connected together<br>
through a waveguide unequal power divider network, which takes care of<br>
distribution and matching. The unequal power divider network is based on Hplane<br>
tee junction with two irises, first to split the incoming power to two output<br>
ports and the second to match the input port. A number of such H-plane tee<br>
junctions in conjunction with different types of bends and matching irises are<br>
used to improve the design of two layered 1:n unequal power divider network<br>
within the space available.<br>
Referring to Fig. (11), A novel technique based on Method of Moments<br>
and FEM have been invented to design a compact, non-standard, reduced height<br>
waveguide planar magic tee junction. It is a two layer structure consisting of Hplane<br>
waveguide tee junction coupled through a slot to another waveguide lying<br>
underneath and parallel to the main arm of the H-plane tee junction. The<br>
distinguishing feature of this component is the placement of difference port on a<br>
layer separated from other three ports by a common waveguide broad wall. The<br>
two parts of the component are coupled through ^ slot located in the common<br>
broad wall of twor T-he lower waveguide (shown in dotted line) is fed from one<br>
end (port # 4) and short circuited at other end at appropriate point. This<br>
waveguide will correspond to the difference arm of the magic tee. The other three<br>
magic tee ports are located in the bottom side as shown by solid lines.<br>
Referring to Fig. (1), during transmit/receive mode of operation, a RF signal<br>
of unit amplitude is applied to the sum/difference port of the antenna manifold.<br>
The sum port / difference port Junetions split the RF signal into first half signal<br>
that corresponds to the outgoing/incoming RF signal as transmitted/received by<br>
one half of the antenna and a Second half signal that corresponds to the<br>
outgoing/incoming RF signal as transmitted/received by another half of the<br>
antenna through a waveguide unequal power divider network. The sum port<br>
junction which is a septum based H-plane tee junction, splits the signal into two<br>
halves both in amplitude and phase and thus giving a sum pattern. The<br>
difference port, which is achieved through a co-linear waveguide to waveguide<br>
coupling through a transverse slot, splits the signal into two halves equal in<br>
amplitude but opposite in phase, thus producing a difference pattern. The first<br>
half/ second half signa[ is further divided equally by the tee junction (38) and<br>
"(39")'Half slgViaTarrlvihg~af junctidn~"(38)"6f the'"waveguide power divider network<br>
gets splitted further into two parts equally (both in amplitude and phase) by<br>
septum (40). Afterwards, first quarter signal flows in quadrant (34) and the<br>
second quarter signal flows in quadrant (35) of the antenna. For the sake of<br>
simplicity, the RF signal flow in only one quadrant (34) of the antenna is<br>
described here. The signal flow in all other quadrants are similar. First quarter<br>
signal flowing in quadrant (34) power divider network get divided unequally in<br>
amplitude but equally in phase at junctions (41, 45 &amp; 46) to get the required<br>
amplitude distribution at the waveguide out put ports (input of the sub array<br>
ports). This amplitude weighting (distribution) is used to get the required side<br>
lobe pattern of the antenna during transmit and receive modes of operation. RF<br>
signal reaching waveguide power divider network output ports (55, 55, 57 and<br>
58) are coupled to the first layer feed guide rectangular channels (17) through<br>
second layer round cornered centered inclined slots (30). The orientation and<br>
dimensions of the slots are designed in such a way that the signal flowing to the<br>
power divider network output ports get coupled fully to the first layer feeder<br>
guide. The signal flowing in feed guide rectangular channels (17) are coupled to<br>
the radiating waveguide rectangular channel (7) through first layer inclined slots<br>
(10) located in the common broad wall of radiating waveguide rectangular<br>
channels (7) and first layer feed guide rectangular channel (17). The dimensions<br>
and orientation/tilt of the inclined slots are designed to get the required amplitude<br>
distribution across the first layer rectangular channels. First layer inclined slots<br>
(17), one for each rectangular channel (7), are used to excite radiating slots (10)<br>
to get the required amplitude and phase excitation across the radiating slots for a<br>
specified radiation pattern.<br>
