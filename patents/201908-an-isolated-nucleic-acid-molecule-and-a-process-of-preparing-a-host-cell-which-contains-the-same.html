Government Sponsored Research<br>
This work was supported, in part, by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (ZDH-9-29009-04), Energy Biosciences Program (FG02-96ER20222), and the Florida Agricultural Experiment Station.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Many environmental and societal benefits would result from the replacement of petroleum-based automotive fuels with renewable fuels obtained from plant materials (Lynd e( ai, (1991) Science 251:1318-1323; Olson et al. (1996) Enzyme Microh. Technol. 18:1-17; Wymane/a/., {\99S)Amâ‚¬r. Chem. Sac. Symp. 618:272-290). Each year, the United States bums over 120 billion gallons of automotive fuel, roughly equivalent to the total amount of imported petroleum. The development of ethanol as a renewable alternative fuel has the potential to eliminate United States dependence on imported oil, improve the environment, and provide new employment (Sheehan, (1994) ACS Symposium Series No. 566, ACS Press, pp 1-53).<br>
In theory, the solution to the problem of imported oil for automotive fuel appears quite simple. Rather than using petroleum, a finite resource, ethanol, a renewable resource, can be produced efficiently by the fermentation of plant material. Indeed,<br><br>
Brazil has demonstrated the feasibility of producing ethanol and the use ot ethanol as a primary automotive fuel for more than 20 years. Similarly, the United States produces over 1.2 billion gallons of fuel ethanol each year. Currently, fuel ethanol is produced from corn starch or cane syrup utilizing either Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Zymomonas mohilis (Z mohilis). However, neither of these sugar sources can supply the volumes needed to realize a replacement of petroleum-based automotive fuels. In addition, both cane sugar and com starch are relatively expensive starting materials, which have competing uses as food products.<br>
Moreover, these sugar substrates represent only a fraction of the total carbohydrates in plants. Indeed, the majority of the carbohydrates in plants are in the form of lignocellulose, a complex structural polymer containing cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin. Lignocellulose is found in, for example, the stems, leaves, hulls, husks, and cobs of plants. Hydrolysis of these polymers releases a mixture of neutral sugars including glucose, xylose, mannose, galactose, and arabinose. No known natural organism can rapidly and efficiently metabolize all of these sugars into ethanol.<br>
Nonetheless, in an effort to exploit this substrate source, the Gulf Oil Company developed a method for the production of ethanol from cellulose using a yeast-based process termed simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) (Gauss et ai (1976) U.S.P.N. 3,990,944). Fungal cellulase preparations and yeasts were added to a slurry of the cellulosic substrate in a single vessel. Ethanol was produced concurrently during cellulose hydrolysis. However, Gulfs SSF process has some shortcomings. For example, the cell cycle time for yeast is relatively long (24-36 hours) and they are unable to ferment complex sugars. Further, fungal cellulases have to be added which have been considered, thus far, to be too expensive for use in large scale bioethanol processes (Himmel et al, (1997) Amer. Chem. Soc. pp. 2-45; Ingram et ai, (1987) Appl Environ. Microbiol 53:2420-2425; Okamoto e/a/., {\99A) Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 42:563-568; Philippidis, G., (1994) Amer. Chem. Soc. pp. 188-217; Saito et al, (1990) J. Ferment. Bioeng. 69:282-286; Sheehan, J., (1994) Amer. Chem. Soc. pp 1-52; Su et al, {\993) Biotechnol Lett. 15:979-984).<br>
Moreover, producing ethanol using other organisms is difficult because pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), a key enzyme for fermenting ethanol, is common only to plants, yeast, and fungi; and is rarely found in bacteria and is absent in animals (9, 25).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The development of inexpensive enzymatic methods for ethanol fermentation has great potential for improving the efficiency of substrate utilization and the economics of the fermentation process. Accordingly, developing enzymes and.<br><br>
advantageously, biocatalysts that produce such enzymes which can be used for the efficient depolymerization of complex sugars and subsequent rapid fermentation of the sugar into alcohol, would be of great benefit.<br>
Certain microbes, such as Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria produce a number of fermentation enzymes, which are capable of catalyzing, for example, the depolymerization of cellulose and hemicellulose to produce fermentable sugars, conversion of a sugar into pyruvate, the substrate pyruvate into acetaldehyde. and finally, the substrate acetaldehyde into ethanol. However, such organisms rarely produce all of the necessarily enzymes at the most desirable levels.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylases which can be expressed at high levels in a range of organisms. Thus, when expressed in an organism, or cultured with an organism, that produces the remaining key enzymes needed for ethanol fermentation, superior levels of ethanol production can be achieved. These enzymes, for example pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), alone or in combination with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), can be used as a crude extract having a desired mixture of activity or, can be used as a purified composition.<br>
Moreover, a biocatalyst, advantageously a recombinant bacterium, more advantageously a ethanologenic bacterium, can be engineered to express one or more of these enzymatic activities in particular amounts sufficient for fermenting a sugar(s). Such a biocatalyst is suitable for the efficient degradation of complex sugars and subsequent fermentation into alcohol by a process known as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF).<br>
The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of key enzyme-encoding genes of ethanol fermentation in bacteria. In particular, the identification of ihQ pdc gene of Zymobacter palmae. Acetohacterpasteurianus, and Sarcina ventriculi has been achieved. These genes have been determined to encode pyruvate decarboxylase enzymes having superior pyruvate decarboxylase activity, substrate affinity, for, e.g., pyruvate, as well as thermostability, and superior activity at different pH. Still further, the pdc genes of the invention have a codon usage that affords for their high expression in a range of organisms.<br>

Such hybridization conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Ausubel et al, eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1995), sections 2, 4 and 6. Additional stringent conditions can be found in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual^ Sambrook et ai. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989), chapters 7, 9 and 11. A particular, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4X sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65-70Â°C (or hybridization in 4X SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50Â°C) followed by one or more washes in IX SSC, at about 65-70Â°C. A particular, non-limiting example of highly stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in IX SSC, at about 65-70Â°C (or hybridization in IX SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50'^C) followed by one or more washes in 0.3X SSC, at about 65-70Â°C. A particular, non-limiting example of reduced stringency hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4X SSC, at about 50-60Â°C (or alternatively hybridization in 6X SSC plus 50% formamide at about 40-45Â°C) followed by one or more washes in 2X SSC, at about 50-60Â°C. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited values, e.g., at 65-70Â°C or at 42-50Â°C are also intended to be encompassed by the present invention. SSPE (IX SSPE is 0.15 M NaCl, lOmM NaH2P04, and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (IX SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes each after hybridization is complete. The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5-1 OX less than the melting temperature (Tm) of the hybrid, where Tm is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, Tm(Â°C) = 2(# of A + T bases) + 4(# of G + C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, Tm(Â°C) = 81.5 + 16.6(logio[Na^]) + 0.41(%G+C) - (600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and [Na"^] is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer ([Na^] for IX SSC = 0.165 M).<br>

The regulatory sequence includes nucleic acid sequences which affect (e.g., modulate or regulate) expression of other nucleic acid sequences. In one embodiment, a regulatory sequence is included in a recombinant nucleic acid molecule or recombinant vector in a similar or identical position and/or orientation relative to a particular gene of interest as is observed for the regulatory sequence and gene of interest as it appears in nature, e.g., in a native position and/or orientation.

Alternatively, a gene of interest can be included in a recombinant nucleic acid molecule or recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to another (e.g., a different) gene in the natural organism. Alternatively, a gene of interest can be included in a recombinant nucleic acid molecule or recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence from another organism.

Advantageous regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers, termination signals, anti-termination signals and other expression control elements (e.g., sequences to which repressors or inducers bind and/or binding sites for transcriptional and/or translational regulatory polypeptides, for example, in the transcribed mRNA). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989. Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in<br><br>
a microorganism (e.g., constitutive promoters and strong constitutive promoters); those which direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in a microorganism (e.g., inducible promoters, for example, xylose inducible promoters); and those which attenuate or repress expression of a nucleotide sequence in a microorganism (e.g., attenuation signals or repressor sequences). It is also within the scope of the present invention to regulate expression of a gene of interest by removing or deleting regulatory sequences. For example, sequences involved in the negative regulation of transcription can be removed such that expression of a gene of interest is enhanced.<br>

Other promoters include re/(the translational elongation factor (TEF) promoter) and/?yc (the pyruvate carboxylase (PYC) promoter), which promote high level expression in Bacillus (e.g.. Bacillus suhtilis). Additional advantageous promoters, for example, for use in Gram positive microorganisms include, but are not limited to, the amyE promoter or phage SP02 promoters. Additional advantageous promoters, for example, for use in Gram negative microorganisms include, but are not limited to (ac. trp, iei, trp-tet, Ipp, lac, Ipp-lac, laclq, T7, T5, T3, gal, ire, ara, SP6, X-Pnor k-Pi.<br>
In another embodiment, a recombinant nucleic acid molecule or recombinant vector of the present invention includes a terminator sequence or terminator sequences (e.g., transcription terminator sequences). Typically, terminator sequences refer to the regulatory sequences which serve to terminate transcription of a gene. Terminator sequences (or tandem transcription terminators) can further serve to stabilize mRNA (^ ,g-. by adding structure to mRNA), for example, against nucleases.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a recombinant nucleic acid molecule or recombinant vector of the present invention includes sequences which altow for detection of the vector containing said sequences (/.e., detectable and/or selectable markers), for example, sequences that overcome auxotrophic mutations, for example, ura3 or ilvE, fluorescent markers, and/or colorimetric markers (e.g., /acZ/p-galactosidase), and/or antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., bla or let).<br>
It is understood that any one of iki^ pdc genes of the invention can be introduced into a vector also comprising one or more ethanologenic genes (e.g., alcohol dehydrogenase (/.e., adh)) and/or a gene encoding a gene product suitable for fermenting a sugar or degrading a sugar for subsequent fermentation as described for example, in<br><br>
Examples 8 and 9 and as provided in U.S. patent Nos. 5,821,093; 5,482,846; 5,424,202; 5,028,539; 5,000,000; 5,487,989, 5,554,520, and 5,162,516. Such two or more genes can be expressed independently using separate regulatory elements (e.g.^ promoters), common regulatory element(s), native regulatory e!ement(s), or a combination thereof.<br>
IK      Isolated Polypeptides<br>
Another aspect of the present invention features isolated polypeptides {e.g., isolated ethanologenic enzymes, for example, pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC)). In one embodiment, PDC polypeptides are produced by recombinant DNA techniques and can be isolated from microorganisms of the present invention by an appropriate purification scheme using standard polypeptide purification techniques. In another embodiment, polypeptides are synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques.<br>
An isolated or purified polypeptide {e.g., an isolated or purified PDC) is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating polypeptides from the microorganism from which the polypeptide is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. In one embodiment, an isolated or purified polypeptide has less than about 30% (by dry weight) of contaminating polypeptide or chemicals, more advantageously less than about 20% of contaminating polypeptide or chemicals, still more advantageously less than about 10% of contaminating polypeptide or chemicals, and most advantageously less than about 5% contaminating polypeptide or chemicals.<br>
In one embodiment, the PDC polypeptide or gene product is derived from a Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterium. Advantageously, the PDC polypeptide or gene product is derived from a Gram-negative microorganism selected from the group consisting of Gluconobacter, Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Alcaligenes, Rhodobacter, Rhodococcus. Azospirillum, Rhodospirillum, Sphingomonas, Burkholderia, Desulfomonas, Geospirillum, Succinomonas, Aeromonas, Shewanella, Halochromatium, Citrobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Zymomonas (e,g, Zymomonas mobilis), Zymobacter (e.g., Zymobacier palmae), and Acetohacter (e.g., Acetobacter pasteurianus).<br>
In another embodiment, the PDC polypeptide or gene product is derived from a Gram-positive microorganism selected from the group consisting of Fibrobacter, Acidobacter, Bacteroides, Sphingobacterium, Actinomyces, Corynebacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Propionibacterium, Bifidobacterium. Bacillus, Geobacillus, Paenibacillus, Sulfobacillus, Clostridium, Anaerobacter, Eubacterium, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Thermobifida, Cellulomonas, and Sarcina (e.g. Sarcina ventricuU), Advantageously, the gene product is derived from a microorganism selected from the group consisting of the Gram-negative bacteria<br><br>
Zymob'acter palmae, Acetohacter pasteurianus, and the Gram-positive bacterium Sarcina ventriculi.<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are PDC polypeptides or gene products that are Zymobacier palmae, Acetobacter pasteurianus, or Sarcina ventriculi -derived polypeptides or gene products encoded by naturally-occurring bacterial genes. Further included within the scope of the present invention are bacterial-derived polypeptides or gene products which differ from naturally-occurring bacterial and/or Zymohacter palmae, Acetobacter pasteurianus, or Sarcina ventriculi genes {e.g., pdc), for example, genes which have nucleic acids that are mutated, inserted or deleted, but which encode polypeptides substantially similar to the naturally-occurring gene products of the present invention, e.g.^ comprise a pyruvate decarboxylase activity.<br>
For example, it is well understood that one of skill in the art can mutate (e.g., substitute) nucleic acids which, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, encode for an identical amino acid as that encoded by the naturally-occurring gene. This may be desirable in order to improve the codon usage of a nucleic acid to be expressed in a particular organism. Moreover, it is well understood that one of skill in the art can mutate (e.g., substitute) nucleic acids which encode for conservative amino acid substitutions. It is further well understood that one of skill in the art can substitute, add or delete amino acids to a certain degree without substantially affecting the function of a gene product (e.g., decarboxylase activity) as compared with a naturally-occurring gene product, each instance of which is intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. The decarboxylase activity and, for example, enzyme/substrate affinity, enzyme thermostability, and/or enzyme activity at various pHs, can be readily determined using the assays described herein.<br>
In an embodiment, an isolated polypeptide of the present invention (e.g., an isolated pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme, for example isolated PDC polypeptide has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID N0:2, SEQ ID N0:4, SEQ ID N0:6, or SEQ ID N0:8. In other embodiments, an isolated polypeptide of the present invention is a homologue of the at least one of the polypeptides set forth as SEQ ID N0:2, SEQ ID N0:4, SEQ ID N0:6, or SEQ ID N0:8 (e.g.. comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 30-40% identical, advantageously about 40-50% identical, more advantageously about 50-60% identical, and even more advantageously about 60-70%, 70-80%, 80-90%, 90-95% or more identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID N0:2, SEQ ID N0:4, SEQ ID N0:6, or SEQ ID N0:8, and has an activity that is substantially similar to that of the polypeptide encoded by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID N0:2, SEQ ID N0:4, SEQ ID N0:6, or SEQ ID N0:8, respectively.<br><br>
To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acids, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino or nucleic acid sequence). When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e.. % identity = # of identical positions/total # of positions x 100), advantageously taking into account the number of gaps and size of said gaps necessary to produce an optimal alignment.<br>
The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A particular, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) Proc. Nail. Acad Sci. USA 87:2264-68, modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci, USA 90:5873-77. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul e( al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score = 100, wordlength = 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST polypeptide searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score = 50, wordlength = 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to polypeptide molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes. Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Research 25(17):3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs {e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Another particular, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller (1988) Comput Appl Biosci. 4:11-17. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program available, for example, at the GENESTREAM network server, IGH Montpellier, FRANCE or at the ISREC server. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used.<br>
In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package, using either a Blossom 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 2, 3, or 4. In yet another embodiment, the percent homology between two nucleic acid sequences can be accomplished using the GAP program in the GCG<br><br>
software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using a gap weight of 50 and a length weight of 3.<br>
Based on the foregoing isolated PDC polypeptides, immunospecific antibodies can be raised against a PDC polypeptide, or portion thereof, using standard techniques as described herein.<br>
V.        Methods of Use<br>
Methods for Producins Acetaldehyde<br>
The clean and efficient production of acetaldehyde as a desirable product has widespread commercial and industrial applications. For example, acetaldehyde is used in the production of acetic acid, flavorings, foods, beverages, perfumes, plastics, aniline dyes, synthetic rubber manufacturing, the silvering of mirrors, gelatin fiber hardening, and in laboratory research. In addition, acetaldehyde serves as a substrate for the production of ethanol through, for example, fermentation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention includes methods for the conversion of a substrate, for example, pyruvate or a pyruvate analog, into acetaldehyde, using the PDC enzymes of the invention. In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for producing acetaldehyde form pyruvate using microorganisms {e.g., a recombinant microorganisms) expressing ^pdc gene and gene product (PDC) as described herein. The methods also include biological processes which result in the production {e.g.. transformation or conversion) of pyruvate, or convertible analog thereof, which can be converted or decarboxylated to acetaldehyde, or an analog thereof<br>
The method comprises contacting a microorganism which expresses apJc gene and gene product of the invention, and optionally, one or more ethanologenic genes, with a sugar, carbon skeleton capable of being converted into pyruvate, pyruvate, or an analog thereof, under culture conditions such that acetaldehyde (or analog thereof) is produced.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the above-mentioned microorganism can be processed into a enzymatic lysate for performing the above conversion reaction. In yet another embodiment, X\ycpdc gene product is purified, as described herein, for carrying out the conversion reaction.<br>
The microorganism(s) and/or enzymes {e.g., in the form of a lysate, partially purified, or purified)) used in the conversion reactions are in a form allowing them to perform their intended function {e.g., producing a desired compound, e.g., acetaldehyde). The microorganisms can be whole cells, or can be only those portions of the cells necessary to obtain the desired end result. The microorganisms can be suspended {e.g., in an appropriate solution such as buffered solutions or media), rinsed {e.g., rinsed free of media from culturing the microorganism), acetone-dried.<br><br>
immobilized (e.g., with polyacrylamide gel or k-carrageenan or on synthetic supports, for example, beads, matrices and the like), fixed, cross-linked or permeabilized {e.g., have permeabilized membranes and/or walls such that compounds, for example, substrates, intermediates or products can more easily pass through said membrane or wall).<br>
Purified or unpurified PDC enzymes (alone or in combination with other ethanologenic enzyme(s)) can also be used in the conversion reactions. The enzyme can be in a form that allows it to perform its intended function {e.g., obtaining the desired compound, e.g., acetaldehyde, or, if in the presence of the necessary ethanologenic gene products, ethanol). For example, the enzyme can be in free form or immobilized.<br>
Methods for Producins Ethanol<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the host cell having the above mentioned attributes is also ethanologenic. Accordingly, the invention provides methods for producing ethanol using such host cells (or extracts/enzymes derived therefrom). In addition, the host cells can be applied in synergistically degrading or depolymerizing a complex saccharide into a monosaccharide. Subsequently, the cell can catabolize the simpler sugar into ethanol by fermentation. This process of concurrent complex saccharide depolymerization into smaller sugar residues followed by fermentation is referred to as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF).<br>
Typically, fermentation conditions are selected that provide an optimal pH and temperature for promoting the best growth kinetics of the producer host cell strain and catalytic conditions for the enzymes produced by the culture (Doran ef a/., (1993) Biotechnol Progress, 9:533-538). For example, for Klebsiella, e.g., the P2 strain, optimal conditions were determined to be between 35-37Â° C and pH 5.0- pH 5.4. Under these conditions, even exogenously added fungal endoglucanases and exoglucanases are quite stable and continue to function for long periods of time. Other conditions are discussed in the Examples. Moreover, it will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, that only routine experimentation is needed, using techniques known in the 2irt, for optimizing a given fermentation reaction of the invention. See. for example, U.S. patent Nos. 5,424,202 and 5,916,787, which are specifically incorporated herein by this reference.<br>

DNA Isolation and Cloning - Plasmid DNA was isolated using a Quantum Prep Plasmid Miniprep Kit from BioRad (Hercules, CA). DNA fragments were eluted from 0.8% SeaKem GTG agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) gels with IX TAE buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.5) using the QIAquick gel extraction kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Genomic DNA was isolated using the method described by Harwood and Cutting (17).<br>
Analysis of DNA and Polypeptide Sequences ofZ. palmae - Plasmids were sequenced using the Sanger dideoxy method (42) using a LICOR sequencer (DNA Sequencing Facility, Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida). Genpro 5.0 (Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco, CA), ClustalW version 1.81 (46), Treeview version 1.5 (39), and MultiAln (12) were used for DNA and polypeptide sequence alignments and comparisons. Deduced amino acid sequences were compared<br><br>
to polypeptide sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, and SwissProt at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) using the BLAST network server.<br>
Purification of PDC Polypeptides - PDC purifications were performed as presented in Table 2. All procedures were performed at room temperature and all purification buffers contained 1 mM TPP and 1 mM MgCla unless otherwise indicated. S. ventriculi PDC was purified from recombinant E. coli BL21-CodonPlus-RIL(pJAM419) and Rosetta (DE3)(pRARE, pJAM419) as previously described (45). Z mobilis PDC was purified from recombinant E. coli DH5a (pLOI276) (II) using thermal treatment, Q-Sepharose, and Superdex 200 procedures as described below for the Z palmae PDC with the exception that the Z mobilis PDC was eluted from Q-Sepharose at 0.22 to 0.32 M NaCl.<br>
(i) Purification ofZ. palmae PDC - Z palmae and E. coli DH5a (pJAM3440) cells were grown to stationary phase and harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 X jtf (10 min, 4Â°C). Cells (12 to 15 g wet wt) were resuspended in 6 volumes of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 containing 1 mM TPP and I mM MgCh (buffer A) and passed through a chilled French pressure cell at 20,000 lb per in^. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 X g (20 min, 4T). Cell lysate was heated to 60T for 30 min, chilled on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 X ^ (30 min at 4"C) to remove denatured polypeptides. The supernatant was applied to a HiLoad Q-Sepharose 26/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated in 50 mM buffer A. The column was washed with 200 ml of 50 mM buffer A and a 400-ml linear 0 - 1 M NaCl gradient was applied at 4.0 ml per min. The peak of PDC activity eluted between 0.4 and 0.5 M NaCl and was pooled. The recombinant Z palmae PDC from E. coli was purified to homogeneity by injecting aliquots (0.5 ml) onto a Superdex 200 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mM buffer A containing 150 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol at 0.2 ml per min.<br>
Purification of "native' PDC from Z palmae required additional steps. Heat-treated lysate was applied to a hydroxyapatite CHT5-1 column (BioRad) equilibrated with 10 mM buffer A. The column was washed with 30 ml of 10 mM buffer A and a 30-ml linear 10 mM - IM sodium phosphate gradient was applied at 0.5 ml per min. The peak of PDC activity eluted at 0.45 to 0.5 M sodium phosphate and was pooled. Aliquots were further purified using a Superdex 200 10/30 column as described above. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the combined active fractions to 1 M and then loaded onto a Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (low sub) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mM buffer A containing 1 M ammonium sulfate. After a 15-ml wash, the column was developed with a 15-ml decreasing linear gradient of 1 - 0 M ammonium sulfate at 0.5 ml per min. The peak of "native" PDC activity was eluted between 0.55 and 0.3 M salt.<br><br>
(ii) Purification of A. pasteurianus PDC - PDC was purified from A. pasteuhanus and E. coli ER1648(pJAM304) using heat-treatment, Q-Sepharose, Superdex 200, and hydroxyapatite as described for the Z palmae PDC with the following modifications. Cells were passed through a French pressure cell at 30,000 lb per in^. The PDC activity, which was eluted at 0.17 to 0.26 M NaCl from the Q-Sepharose column, was pooled and concentrated by dialysis against PEG8000 prior to loading onto the Superdex 200 column.<br>
The Z palmae and A. pasteurianus PDCs were stored for up to one month in 10% glycerol under liquid nitrogen without loss of activity. The S. ventriculi and Z mohilis PDCs were stored at 4'C.<br>
PDC Quantitation and Enzyme Activity Assay - Polypeptide concentration was determined using Bradford reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard (BioRad). PDC activity was measured by the coupled assay with baker's yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) as previously described (11). The reaction mixture contained 0.15 mM NADH, 5 mM MgCb, 0.1 mM TPP, 5 mM pyruvate, and 10 U ADH in 50 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.0 and was measured at 25Â°C unless otherwise indicated. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that generates 1 |imol of acetaldehyde per min.<br>
Molecular Mass and Amino Acid Sequence Determination of the PDC Polypeptide - Subunit molecular masses and enzyme purity were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 12% polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie blue R-250 (26). Molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE were as follows: phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and lysozyme (14.4 kDa). For the determination of native molecular mass, samples were applied to a Superdex 200 10/30 column equilibrated in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 150 mM NaCl. Molecular mass standards included: serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), a-amylase (200 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), and thyroglobulin (669 kDa).<br>
The N-terminal sequences of the purified PDC polypeptides were determined after SDS-PAGE and electroblotting of the polypeptides onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF-PLUS) (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA). Sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation at the Polypeptide Chemistry Core Facility of the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research.<br>
Apoenzyme Preparation - Purified PDC (0,75 mg per 0.5 ml) was diluted with 1.5 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 9.0 and immediately concentrated 8-fold using a Centricon YM30 concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After adjusting<br><br>
the volume to 0.5 ml, the polypeptide was incubated at 25Â°C for 45 min. PDC was purified from unbound cofactors by application to a Superdex 200 10/30 column equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 9.0 with 10% glycerol and 150 mM NaCl. Immediately after elution, the apoenzyme was diluted 5-fold into 50 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.0, stored at 4'C, and used within 16 h for reconstitution assays, TPP was measured by fluorescence after oxidation to thichrome diphosphate using K3Fe(CN)6 in 15% NaOH (15). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 375nni and 430nm, respectively. For reconstitution, apoenzyme (755 ng) was diluted into 1 ml of 50 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.0 with 1 mM TPP and/or 1 mM of MgC^. The mixture was assayed for PDC activity in the same buffer.<br>

Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England BioLabs. Digoxigenin-11-dUTP (2'-deoxyurid!ne-5'-triphosphate coupled by an 11-atom spacer to digoxigenin), alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibody raised against digoxigenin, and nylon membranes for colony and plaque hybridizations were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Positively charged nylon membranes for Southern hybridization were from Ambion (Austin, TX).<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PDC GENE FROM<br>
GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIUM ZYMOBACTER PALMAE<br>
In this example, the identification and characterization of a PDC gene from the Gram-negative bacterium Z palmae is described.<br>
Briefly, a pyruvate decarboxylase ipdc) operon was isolated from a genomic library of Zymobacter palmae using a degenerate oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein (Fig. 1). A 1.7-kb Pstl to BamUl subclone of this fragment (pJAM3440) was found to be required for PDC activity in recombinant E. coli. Based on DNA sequence, a 1668-bp ORF (55 mol% G+C content) was identified in this region that encoded a putative PDC polypeptide (Fig. 1). A canonical Shine-Dalgamo sequence (GGAGG) was 10 bp upstream of the translation start codon (ATG). In addition, a putative -35 and -10 promoter (TTcACt-Nn-atTAAT, where N is any nucleotide and uppercase letters match the bacterial promoter consensus) was located 16 to 44 bp upstream of the start codon (18). Downstream (21 bp) of the translation stop codon was a 62 bp sequence predicted to form two stem-loop structures followed by a 16 bp AT-rich region, consistent with p-independent transcription termination (18). All four bacterial pdc genes, including those from Z<br><br>
mohilis, S. ventriculi, and A. pasteuricmus, are predicted to be independently transcribed from a monocistronic operon (11, 40, 45).<br>
The deduced PDC polypeptide of Z palmae (ZpaPDC) contained 556 amino acids (including the N-terminal methionine) with an anhydrous molecular mass of 60,113 Da (Fig. 4). This is similar to the three other bacterial PDCs which range from 552 to 568 amino acids and 59,830 to 61,809 Da. GenBank accession number AF474145 has been assigned to the Z palmae sequence.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PDC GENE FROM<br>
GRAM-NEGATIVE AEROBIC BkCTER\\}MACETOBACTER PASTEURIANUS<br>
In this example, the identification and characterization of a PDC gene from the Gram-negative bacterium Acetohacter pasteurianus is described.<br>
Briefly, a chromosomal DNA was isolated from cells of i4. pasteurianus using the method described by Harwood et al. (17). For Southern analysis, the genomic DNA (I to 2 |ig per lane) was cleaved with restriction enzymes (.4^/11, BamWl, Clal, EcoRl, and Hindi), separated by gel electrophoresis (0.8% agarose), and transferred by downward capillary action to positively charged nylon membranes. Membranes were equilibrated at 60^C for 2 h in 5X SSC (IX SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) containing 1% blocking reagent, 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, and 0.02% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Random primers were used to label a probe with dixoigenin-11-dUTP using a 0.7-kb Kprtl fragment of the Z mohilis pdc gene as the template. After the labeled-probe (1 ng per ml) was added, membranes were incubated at GOT for 14 h and washed twice with a solution containing 2X SSC and 0.1% SDS (5 min per wash) and twice with a solution containing 0.5X SSC and 0.1 % SDS (15 min per wash at 60'C). Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using X-ray film.<br>
A sub-genomic library was generated using 5- to 7-kb Aatll fragments of ^. pasteurianus chromosomal DNA. Overhangs were converted to blunt ends using Vent DNA polymerase and ligated into the blunt (Vent DNA polymerase), de-phosphorylated (calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase) Xhol site of pLITMUS28. After transformation, recombinants were screened by hybridization using conditions similar to those for Southern analysis, which allowed the isolation of plasmid pJAM301 containing the full-length/&gt;(/c and aldl genes (Fig. 2).<br>
The A. pasteurianus DNA fragment (4.2 kb) in pJAM301 was then subcloned (Fig. 2) and sequenced by the Sanger dideoxy method (42) using a LICOR sequencer (DNA Sequencing Facility, Department of Microbiology and Cell Science, University of Florida). GenBank accession number AF368435 has been assigned to this sequence.<br><br>
Genepro 5.0 (Riverside Scientific, Seattle, WA), ClustalW version 1.81 (Thompson et al, 1994), Tree view version 1.5 (Page, 1996), and MultiAln (Corpet, 1988) were used for DNA and/or polypeptide sequence alignments and comparisons. Deduced amino acid sequences were compared to polypeptide sequences available in the GenBank, EMBL, and SwissProt databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) using the BLAST network server.<br>
A fragment of the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) gene from Z mohilis was used as a DNA-hybridization probe to isolate a 6,337 bp Aatll fragment with 58.5% G+C content from A. pasteurianus genomic DNA (Fig. 2). Based on a Blast analysis of the DNA sequence, apc/c gene was identified. This gene is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 548 amino acids (including the N-terminal formyl-methionine) with a calculated pi of 5.49 and an anhydrous molecular mass of 58,873 Da (Fig. 5). The codon usage of the/7t/c gene was compared tp the two other bacterial/7(^c genes, Z mobilis (11, 34, Reynen and Sahm, J Bacteriol. 170:3310-3313 (1988)) and S. ventriculi, as well as the E. coli K-12 genome (Table 1). Consistent with high G+C content for the A. pasteurianus pdc gene (60.4%), the codons had a predominance of C and/or G in the third base position with exception of those for Glu, His, and Tyr (Table 1). This is in contrast to the Z mobilis (52.4%) and S. ventriculi {}Q.9%)pdc genes that have lower G+C content and differ in their codon usage.<br>
Analysis of the 5'-end of the A. pasteurianus pdc gene revealed a canonical Shine-Dalgamo sequence that is 8 bp upstream of the predicted translation start codon of GTG. In addition, a region 72 to 101 bp upstream oixh^pdc gene has high identity to eubacterial -35 and -10 consensus sequence for a a^^-dependent promoter. Immediately downstream (17 bp) of thep^c translation stop codon is a series of predicted hairpin loop structures that are followed by an AT-rich region, indicating p-independent termination of pdc transcription. Thus, the A. pasteurianus pdc gene was determined to be transcribed as a monocistronic operon like that of Z mobilis (11) and S. ventriculi pdc genes.<br>
Additional open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in the pdc gene region including an ORF denoted as aldl, which is divergently transcribed from pdc (Fig. 2). The putative aW/gene is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 357 amino acids (including the N-terminal formyl-methionine) with a calculated molecular mass of 38,108 Da and pl of 6.32. The deduced polypeptide sequence (Aldl) is very similar to members of the Zn^"*"- and NAD'^-dependent medium-chain ADH family (class III) most notably the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenases (GSH-FDH) (Jomvall et al, Eur. J. Biochem 167:195-201 (1987)). Amino acid residues that are probable ligands for both the structural (C-92, C-95, C-98, and C-106) and catalytic (C-40, H-62, and C-169) zinc ions important for GSH-FDH activity are conserved. A Rossman fold<br><br>
consensus sequence (residues 194-GLGGIG-199) is also present and indicates that Aldl can bind NADCP)"^. The predicted A. pasteurianus Aldl polypeptide has little sequence identity to the three subunits of the membrane-bound ALD or ADH enzymes, necessary for ethanol oxidation in Acetobacter (Thumer et al, 1997; Kondo and Horinouchi, J Bacteriol. 177:5048-5055 (1997)). Instead, this predicted polypeptide was determined to have close evolutionary ties to GSH-FDH polypeptides. Most notably, the A. pasteurianus polypeptide encoded by aW/clusters with GSH-FDH enzymes from the a-proteobacteria, the cynaobacterium Anahaena azolla, and to a lesser extent with the P-and y-proteobacteria consistent with the taxonomic classification of the acetic acid bacteria.<br>
Subclones of the ^. pasteurianus AatW 6.3-kb genomic fragment carrying the pdc gene on a high copy number plasmid were analyzed for PDC activity by the ADH coupled assay. Significant levels of PDC activity were only detected for strains carrying plasmid pJAM304, which has the complete/?Â£/c' open reading frame in addition to 124 bp upstream and 236 bp downstream of the gene (Figs. 2 and 5). GenBank accession number AR368435 has been assigned to the Acetobacter pasteurianus sequence.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PDC GENE FROM<br>
GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIUM SARCINA VENTRICULI<br>
In this example, the identification and characterization of a PDC gene from the Gram-positive bacterium iSarc/wa ventriculi is described.<br>
Briefly, a degenerate oligonucleotide 5'-AARGARGTNAAYGTNGARCAYATGTTYGGNGT-3' (SEQ ID N0:11) was synthesized based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of PDC purified from S. ventriculi (Lowe and Zeikus, 1992)(where, R is A or G; N is A, C, G, or T; Y is C or T). This oligonucleotide was labeled at the 3'-end using terminal transferase with digoxigenin-11-dUTP and dATP as recommended by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and was used to screen genomic DNA from S, ventriculi.<br>
For Southern analysis, genomic DNA was digested with BgR, EcoKl, or Hindi, separated by 0.8% agarose electrophoresis, and transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Southern, 1975). Membranes were equilibrated at 58Â°C for 2 h in 5 X SSC (1 X SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) containing 1% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1% A^-lauroylsarcosine, and 0.02% SDS. After the probe (0.2 pmol per ml) and Poly(A) (0.0 Img per ml) were added, membranes were incubated at 58*'C for 18.5 h. Membranes were washed twice with 2 X SSC containing 0.1% SDS (5 min per wash) at 25Â°C and twice with 0.5 X SSC containing 0.1% SDS (15<br><br>
min per wash) at 58Â°C. Signals were visualized using colorimetric detection accordir to supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).<br>
For generation of a subgenomic library in plasmid pBR322, S. ventricidi chromosomal DNA was digested with Hindi and fractionated by electrophoresis. The 2.5- to 3.5-kb Hindi DNA fragments were ligated into the EcoRV site of pBR322 and transformed into Â£. coli SE2309. Colonies were screened with the degenerate oligonucleotide by colorimetric detection. By this method, plasmid pJAM400 that carries Hindi fragment containing 1,350 bp of the pdc gene was isolated (Fig. 3).<br>
The XBlueSTAR Vector System (Novagen) was used to create an additional subgenomic library to facilitate isolation of the full-length/76/c gene from S. ventriculi. Genomic DNA was digested with fic/I, separated by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose, and the 6.5- to 8,5-kb fragments were ligated with the A^BlueSTAR BamHl arms. In vitro packaging and plating of phage was performed according to the supplier (Novagen). A DNA probe was generated using an 800-bp EcoRl fragment of the/^Jc gene from pJAM400 that was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP using the random primed method as recommended by the supplier (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Plaques were screened using colorimetric detection. Cre-Zox/'-mediated subcloning was used to circularize the DNA of the positive plaques by plating XBlueSTAR phage with E. coli BM25.8 that expresses Cre recombinase (Novagen). The circularized plasmid pJAM410 was then purified and electroporated into E. coli DH5a.<br>
For generation of apc/c expression vector, the promoterless/Jt/c gene was subcloned into pET21d after amplification from pJAM413 (Fig. 3) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers were designed for directional insertion using BspHl (oligo 1) and ATzoI (oligo 2) restriction sites. The resulting fragment was ligated into compatible Ncol and^ol sites of pET2Id (Novagen) to produce pJAM419 (Fig. 3). The fidelity ofxhepdc gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing.<br>
To determine the S. ventriculi pyruvate decarboxylase operon, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the PDC polypeptide purified from S. ventriculi (Lowe and Zeikus, 1992) was used to generate a degenerate oligonucleotide for hybridization to genomic DNA. This approach facilitated the isolation of a 7.0-kb BcR genomic DNA fragment from S. ventriculi. The fragment was further subcloned in order to sequence both strands of a 3,886 bp Hindl-to-Hincll region that hybridized to the oHgonucleotide probe (Fig. 3). Analysis of the DNA sequence reveals an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,656 bp encoding a polypeptide with an N-terminus identical to that of the previously purified S. ventriculi PDC (Fig. 6). The ORF is therefore designated pt/c. A canonical Shine-Dalgamo sequence is present 7 bp upstream of the pdc translation start codon. In addition, a region 82 to 110 bp upstream of pdc has limited identity to the eubacterial -35 and -10 promoter consensus sequence. Downstream (43 bp) of the pdc translation<br><br>
stop codon is a region predicted to form a stem-loop structure followed by an AT-ric region, consistent with a p-independent transcription terminator. Thus, the S. ventricuu pdc is transcribed as a monocistronic operon like the Z mobilis pdc gene (Conway et al, 1987).<br>
A partial ORP was identified 722 bp upstream of pdc which encodes a 177 amino acid polypeptide fragment (ORFl*) (Fig. 3). ORFl* has identity (28-29 %) to several hypothetical membrane polypeptides (GenBank accession numbers CACl 1620, CAC24018, CAA22902) and is predicted to form several transmembrane spanning domains (data not shown). The gene encoding ORFl * is not predicted to be transcribed from the putative -35 and -10 promoter of the pdc operon.<br>
Based on the above studies, the S. ventricidi pdc gene was determined to encode a polypeptide of 552 amino acids (including the N-terminal methionine) with a calculated pi of 5.16 and anhydrous molecular mass of 61,737 Da. GenBank accession number AF354297 has been assigned to the Sarcina ventriculi sequence.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 METHODS FOR PRODUCING AN ANTIBODY THAT SPECIFICALLY BINDS<br>
A PDC POLYPEPTIDE<br>
In this example, methods for making an immunospecitlc antibody against a pyruvate decarboxylase are described.<br>
In brief, purified recombinant A. pasteurianus PDC polypeptide (300 \xg) was separated by SDS-PAGE. A gel fragment containing the PDC protein was excised prior to staining with Coomassie blue R-250. This was used as antigen for polyclonal antibody production in rabbits (anti-ApPDC) as recommended by the supplier (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, Penn.). For immunoblot analysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes in 10 mM MES at pH 6.0 with 10 % methanol for 16 h at 20 vohs at 4Â°C. For detection of antigen, immunoblot procedures and colorimetric detection were using standard techniques. The primary antibody, anti-ApPDC, was diluted 1:7,000. The alkaline phosphatase linked goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Fisher Biotech) was diluted 1:7,500. Using the foregoing method, a polyclonal antisera that specifically bound a PDC polypeptide was identified.<br>
If desired, the antibody molecules directed against PDC can be isolated from the mammal (e.g., from the blood) and further purified by well known techniques, such as protein A chromatography to obtain the IgG fraction. In addition, at an appropriate time after immunization, e.g., when the anti-PDC antibody titers are highest, antibody-producing cells can be obtained from the subject and used to prepare monoclonal antibodies by standard techniques, such as the hybridoma technique originally described<br><br>
by Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256:495-497; see also, e.g.. Using Antibodies: Laboratory Manual, Harlow et al, C.S.H.L. Press, Pub. (1999)).<br>
EXAMPLE 5 METHODS FOR IDENTIFYING CODON USAGE OF PDC GENES IN<br>
DIFFERENT HOST CELLS<br>
In this example, methods for identifying PDC polypeptides suitable for improved expression based on codon usage are described.<br>
Bacterial PDC can be used to engineer ethanol pathways in a wide variety of organisms. However, compatible patterns of codon usage are advantageously determined in order to ensure for functional expression in heterologous systems (4, 14, 16, 22). A simple tabulation of G+C content can serve as an initial guide. G+C contents for these foxxxpdc genes range from 60% for .4. pasteurianus to 31% for S. ventriculi. The average G+C content for E. coli ORFs is 52%, identical to that for Z mobilis pdc (52%) and similar to Z palmaepdc (55%). For most amino acids, patterns of codon usage for these two organisms were quite similar to each other and to E. coli. The Z palmae pdc was functionally expressed at high levels (approximately 1/3 of polypeptide based on activity) in recombinant E. coli. The Z mobilis pdc and A. pasteurianus pdc were expressed at lower levels (7 to 9% of polypeptide based on activity) and S. ventriculi pdc was poorly expressed in recombinant E. coli (less than 0.3% of polypeptide based on activity)(45).<br>
To produce larger amounts of functional recombinant 5". ventriculi PDC, the use of a modified E. coli host containing additional tRNA genes for rare codons such as AGA (arginine), GGA (glycine), AUA (isoleucine), and CUA (leucine) proved important for high-level polypeptide production (almost 1/4 of polypeptide based on activity) (45). The pattern of codon usage in S. ventriculi pdc is particularly useful for the genetic engineering of an ethanol pathway in low G+C Gram-positive bacteria as illustrated by the comparison to B. subtilis ORFs (Table 1). In contrast, A. pasteurianus pdc can be selected for engineering a homoethanol pathway in to high G+C cellulolytic bacteria such as Thermobifidia sp. (23) or Cellulomonas sp. (35).<br>
*<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 6 BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF PDC ACTIVITY<br>
In this example, the biochemical characterization of several representative PDC polypeptides is described.<br>
The purification of four representative bacterial PDC polypeptides was performed as presented in Table 2, infra. ZpaPDC was purified to homogeneity from Z palmae and recombinant Â£ coli. For comparison, three other bacterial PDCs were purified from recombinant E. coli. PDC was also purified from A. pasteurianus. In general, purification of the 'native' PDCs required additional steps {i.e., phenyl Sepharose and hydroxyapatite chromatography). This was due to the 10- to 250-fold lower levels of PDC activity of'native' compared to ^recombinant' cell lysate. All of the PDC polypeptides had subunit molecular masses of 55 to 60 kDa, as estimated by reducing SDS-PAGE, which were consistent with the masses calculated from the deduced polypeptide sequences.<br>
The N-terminal amino acid sequence of PDC purified from Z palmae (MYTVGMYLAE) was identical to the sequence deduced from the gene and included the N-terminal methionine. Previous studies have demonstrated that the PDC purified from S. ventriculi also retains the N-terminal methionine which is amino to a lysine residue (28, 45). In contrast, the N-terminal sequence of PDC purified from A. pasteurianus (TYTVGMYLAERL) lacked an N-terminal methionine indicating that cleavage by a native methionine aminopeptidase. The PDC purified from Z mohilis also was determined to be cleaved to expose an N-terminal serine (34). These results are consistent with the highly conserved substrate specificity of methionine aminopeptidases which is dictated by the Pi' residue (5). The N-terminal methionine is only removed if the second residue is small and uncharged. This substrate preference is opposite to the 'N-end rule' for polypeptide degradation (47).<br>
A determination of the quaternary structure of the PDC polypepfides was also performed. The ZmoPDC associates as a tetramer of 240 kDa even after removal of the cofactors TPP and Mg^"**(15). Likewise the SvePDC and ZpaPDC associated as tetramers of 240 kDa even after cofactor dissociation (data not shown). Interestingly, the ApaPDC formed both tetramers and octamers (224 and 447 kDa) of similar specific activity, and dissociated into dimers (120 kDa) after cofactor extraction. Activity and tetrameric configuration of the ApaPDC apoenzyme were fully restored after addition of Mg^"*" and TPP with half saturation constants of 3.1 |aM and 5.8 |iM and Hill constants of 1.17 to 1.22, respectively. The tetrameric configuration observed for all four bacterial PDCs is consistent with the quaternary structure of the majority oCeukaryotic PDCs. However, similar to ApaPDC higher order structures have been observed for the PDC<br><br>
from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, which associates as a homopolymeric filament of 8 to 10 nm (1). Likewise, in plants (maize, pea, and wheat germ) PDC forms complexes up to 1 MDa (24, 27, 32). The dissociation of ApaPDC into dimers after removal of the cofactors is also consistent with eukaryotic PDCs (25).<br><br>
EXAMPLE 7 CHARACTERIZATION OF PDC THERMOSTABILITY<br>
In this example, the thermostability of several representative PDC polypeptides is described.<br>
It has been observed that the ZmoPDC is thermostable after heating cell lysate to eO'C in the presence of cofactors (TPP and Mg^"^) (11). To fiirther address this phenomenon, activity of the purified bacterial PDCs was analyzed at 25'C after exposure to various temperatures in the presence of saturating cofactors (Fig. 7).   All three Gram-negative PDCs were relatively thermostable and retained 60 to 100%<br><br>
activity after heating to 60'C for 30 min. In contrast, the purified SvePDC was completely inactivated after exposure to temperatures of SO'C or higher. Although amino acid composition cannot be used as a universal guide to thermostability (30, 31, 48), it was observed that the three thermostable PDCs contained higher levels of alanine and cysteine and lower levels of phenylalanine. These changes are consistent with an increase in thermostability based on compositional comparisons of homologous enzymes (2, 31). Increased levels of alanine can stabilize Gram-negative PDC polypeptides at high temperature by facilitating the formation of helices and a more compact polypeptide core. Accordingly, the present invention also includes pdc genes which have been altered to express a PDC polypeptide comprising corresponding cysteine and/or alanine amino acid changes to achieve improved thermostability. In addition, analysis of the thermostable PDCs from the Gram-negative bacteria revealed an over 2.5-fold increase in activity when assayed at their temperature optima of 60Â°C compared to room temperature. Based on Arrhenius plots, these enzymes were estimated to have activation enthalpy in the range of 12.6 to 14.2 kJ mof' and entropy values of-92.8 to -98.2 Jmol*' K'*.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 CHARACTERIZATION OF PDC SUBSTRATE AFFINITIES AND pH OPTIMA<br>
In this example, the characterization of substrate affinity for several representative PDC polypeptides as well as pH optima are described.<br>
In particular, significant differences in pH optima were observed for the bacterial PDC polypeptides. The ZpaPDC was most active at pH 5.5 to 6.0 (Fig. 8), similar to ZmoPDC which has a pH optimum of 6.0 (34). The pH optimum of ApaPDC, however, was significantly lower than that observed for the other two Gram-negative PDCs and ranged from 5.0 to 5.5 (Fig. 8). The pH optimum for the Gram-positive SvePDC (pH 6.3 to 7.6) has been shown to be much broader and more neutral than the Gram-negative PDCs (28). This indicates that there are differences in the conformation and/or composition of charged residues at or near the active site.<br>
The eukaryotic and bacterial SvePDC exhibit positive cooperative kinetics in the presence of the substrate pyruvate (9, 25, 28). The ZpaPDC and ApaPDC, however, exhibited normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with K^ values of 0.2 to 0.4 mM for pyruvate and kcat values of 20,500 to 30,500 min'* (pH optimum, 25"C) (Table 3). The lack of allosteric control with respect to pyruvate, which was observed for these Gram-negative PDC enzymes, is similar to that established for the highly related PDC from Z mobilis (7, 34). As a further comparison, the kinetic constants of all four bacterial PDC polypeptides were determined at their pH optimum as well as at pH 7.0 (Table 3). This approach was chosen to analyze the bacterial PDC enzymes to more closely reflect the<br><br>
neutral cytosol of recombinant hosts used previously for high-level ethanol production (e.g. E. coli, Erwinia spp.). These modest pH changes had only a slight effect on the maximum rate of the reaction for all four bacterial PDC polypeptides. In contrast, pH significantly influenced the affinity of the Gram-negative PDCs for pyruvate. Most notably, an over 13-fold increase in /^m was observed when ApaPDC was shifted from its pH optimum to neutral conditions.<br><br>
These results indicate that all three Gram-negative PDCs have an amino acid residue(s) that enables the enzyme to more efficiently bind pyruvate when protonated (at the pH optimum) than deprotonated (neutral pH). However, the protonated slate of this residue does not influence the overall rate of decarboxylation. Because the changes in A^m for the Gram-negative PDCs were observed between pH values of 5 to 7, it is possible that the residue involved in modulating substrate binding for all three enzymes is a histidine. The pKa for free histidine is 6.04; whereas, the pKa for pyruvate as well as the other ionizable amino acid residues {i.e. Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg) does not fall within this pH range.<br>
Protonation of one or more histidines is important to facilitate substrate binding by forming an ion pair with the carboxyl group of pyruvate or by making the active site more substrate accessible. It is also possible that a different residue(s) is involved modulating substrate binding; however, its pKa is modified by the polypeptide environment.<br>
The effect of pH on k^JK^ compared to A:cat for the PDC enzyme of Z mobilis was determined using titration curves with pKa values estimated at 6.23 to 6.45 for the residue involved in modulating substrate binding (21, 43). The deprotonation of Hisl 13 has been indicated to lead to conformational changes that result in a flexible loop (residues 105 to 112) to close over the active site during catalysis (43). Both Hisl 13 and<br><br>
Hisl 14 are conserved in all PDC polypeptides that have been characterized. Thus, Hisl 13 is a logical candidate for the observed pH-dependent changes in Km observed for all three Gram-negative PDCs. However, five crucial residues with ionizable side-chains protruding into the active site of Z mobilis PDC (Asp27, Glu50, Hisl 13, Hisl 14, and Glu473) were modified to residues that were non-ionizable or had altered pKa values (21). The pH-dependence oikcJK^ was relatively unaffected by these modifications indicating that these residues, including Hisl 13, is not involved. Importantly, in this same study modification of Hisl 13 to a residue with significantly higher pKa value {i.e, Arg and Lys) increased the affinity of ZmoPDC for pyruvate by over 20-fold.<br>
These results show that the positively charged form of Hisl 13 keeps the active site open for substrate binding.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 COMPARISON ALIGNMENT OF PDC GENES FROM DIFFERENT<br>
ORGANISMS<br>
In this example, a comparison alignments of the amino acid sequences of pyruvate decarboxylase enzymes (PDC) from different organisms are compared and contrasted.<br>
The deduced PDC polypeptide of Z palmae (ZpaPDC) contained 556 amino acids (including the N-terminal methionine) with an anhydrous molecular mass of 60,113 Da. This is similar to the three other bacterial PDCs which range from 552 to 568 amino acids and 59,830 to 61,809 Da. The ZpaPDC had a calculated pi of 4.93 analogous to the pi determined experimentally (4.87 to 5.3) for the Z mobilis PDC (7, 33). The relatively high alanine content of ZpaPDC (13.1%) was comparable to that of the Gram-negative Z mobilis and A. pasteuhanus PDCs (Zmo and ApaPDC) but almost 2-fold higher than that of the Gram-positive S. ventriculi PDC (SvePDC) (6.9%). Multiple amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 9) and dendrogram cluster analysis revealed that ZpaPDC was most closely related to ApaPDC (72% identity) and highly related to ZmoPDC (62% identity). All three of the Gram-negative PDCs clustered in sequence similarity with the plant PDCs {e.g. Zea mays PDC; 39 to 40% identity).<br>
In contrast, the Gram-positive SvePDC was only 30 to 31% identical to the Gram-negative PDCs and instead grouped with the majorit}' of filamentous fungi and yeast PDCs {e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae PDCl; 38% identity). The N-terminal extension common to PDCs of the plant kingdom was absent from all four of the bacterial PDCs. Residues involved in TPP and Mg^"^ binding, based on the crystal structures of the Z mobilis and yeast PDCs, were conserved in all four bacterial PDCs. In contrast, residues of the yeast PDCl (Tyrl57 and Arg224) are involved in substrate<br><br>
activation, based on binding to the pyruvate analog pyruvamide (29), were only noted in the bacterial SvePDC and not found in the remaining three bacterial PDCs.<br>
The deduced A. pasteuhanus PDC amino acid sequence was aligned with PDC sequences from Z mobilis and yeast (PDCl), both of which have been analyzed by X-ray crystallography (Dyda et al, 1993; Arjunan et al, 1996; Lu et ai, 2000; Dobritzsch et al, 1998), as well as from Zea mays (Fig. 9).   The multiple alignments revealed thai the A, pasteurianus PDC is most similar to Z mobilis PDC (62% identity and 74% similarity). The N-terminal extension of the Z mays PDC, common to other plant PDCs, is not found in the fungal or bacterial PDC polypeptides including that o^A. pasteurianus. Residues demonstrated to be within 0.4 nm of the TPP and Mg^^ binding sites of the yeast and Z mobilis PDC enzymes were highly conserved in the A. pasteuhanus PDC polypeptide sequence (V24, D27, E50, T72, V75, N82, HI 13, HI 14, T384, D386. G408,1410, D435, S437, L440,1460, N462, G464,1467, E468). In addition, the motif identified in TPP-dependent enzymes which was proposed by Hawkins et al (1989) to be involved in Mg^^ and TPP binding is also conserved in the A, pasteurianus PDC polypeptide sequence (G435 to N462). Residues of the yeast PDCl (Tyrl57 and R224) proposed to be involved in allosteric control and demonstrated to bind the pyruvate analog pyruvamide (Lu et ai, 2000), were not conserved in the A. pasteurianus, Z mobilis, or Z mays PDC polypeptides. Instead these residues are restricted to the majority of fungal PDCs and related PDC polypeptide from the Gram-positive bacterium 5*. ventriculi which is substrate activated (Lowe and Zeikus, 1992). Based on the kinetics of CO2 production from pyruvate observed for cell lysate of acetic acid bacteria (King and Cheldelin, 1953), it is concluded that the A, pasteurianus PDC polypeptide, similar to the Z mobilis PDC, is not substrate activated. However, the plant PDCs do not contain these conserved residues but are regulated by substrate, indicating some differences in the mechanism of allosteric control among PDC polypeptides.<br>
Based on cluster analysis of PDC polypeptides, the A. pasteurianus PDC is most closely related to the Z mobilis PDC. This is consistent with the classification of these two bacteria as Gram-negative a-proteobacteria. In contrast to the low G+C Gram-positive S. ventriculi PDC which shares close evolutionary roots with the majority of fungal PDCs, the PDC polypeptides from the a-proteobacteria are more closely related to plant and a couple of out-grouping fungal PDCs.<br><br>
