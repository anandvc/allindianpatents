				<td>FIXING MEANS FOR FIXING A SCREEN PANEL ON<br>
A SUPPORT STRUCTURE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to improved screen panels and<br>
fixing arrangements therefor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Screen panels are well known in screening<br>
arrangements.<br>
Also well known are fixing arrangement for fixing the<br>
screens to the support frame.<br>
Various designs and constructions of both screen<br>
panels and fixing arrangements are in use throughout the<br>
World for several years.<br>
Generally, in one such screen panel, there are<br>
provided a pair of semi-circular 02: half through cavities<br>
on its sides so that the next panel of similar type can be<br>
aligned to form a full cavity, which is used to fix the<br>
panel through bolt and nut to the support frame.<br>
It is also well known that over a period of use, the<br>
screen panels get damaged cr clogged or otherwise their<br>
functional efficiency is impaired. This requires stopping<br>
the operation or interrupting the screening and removing<br>
the impaired screen panel for replacement service etc. The<br>
operation is time consuming and this means that the panel<br>
has to be freed from all sides by removing the fixing means<br>
and the replacement is again to be proceeded with by fixing<br>
along the sides of the panel.<br><br>
This is time consuming, labour intensive and careful<br>
monitoring is required for proper alignment. Moreover,<br>
every replacement means the fixing means are also to be<br>
taken out and re-fixed. Sometimes, the damaged ones are to<br>
be replaced. All this increases the inventory also.<br>
In another known type of construction, the fixing<br>
means is in the form of a series of protrusions in the<br>
screen panels itself dependent from the frame and all these<br>
protrusions are to be integrally formed on the underside of<br>
the panel frame, which is a drawback. Further, it requires<br>
great skill to properly align these protrusions to match<br>
the holes or openings in the support frame.<br>
A further drawback is that these protrusions are<br>
intended to tightly hold the screen panel to the support<br>
frame, but there is danger of these becoming lose on long<br>
use thereby affecting the efficiency of same. Further the<br>
manufacturing of the screen panels with integrating fixing<br>
means increases the cost of production and engineering<br>
requirements.<br>
In yet another fixing means, adjacent sides of the<br>
screen panels are provided with specially designed and<br>
formed locking arrangement and these are adopted to receive<br>
a common matching formed insert having complementary<br>
provisions to hold the two ends of adjacent screen, one on<br>
either side. These are supported on the support structure<br>
with the insert in the hole. However, to hold the screen<br>
tightly on the support sure, a third element is required<br>
which -has specially formed outer depending unit matching<br>
the inner complementary shape of the insert.<br>
These together form the fixing means.<br><br>
However, these increase the cost of manufacture,<br>
calls for precision engineering and it is not possible to<br>
remove or replace any desired damaged screen panel. The<br>
whole fixing unit is to be first removed and the required<br>
panels replaced and again re-fixed.<br>
There are a few other fixing means for screen panels,<br>
which have one or another drawback and to the applicant's<br>
knowledge, there is no fixing means, by which one can<br>
remove any screen panel for repair or replacement.<br>
We are also aware of the following prior-art patents:<br>
1. U.S. Pat. No. 4,596,503:<br>
This Patent refers to an expansion dowel assembly<br>
having an axially extending sleeve and a spreading element<br>
and having tongues pivotally displaceably connected to the<br>
.sleeve and located one after the other along the axial<br>
direction of the sleeve.<br>
This construction is entirely different from the<br>
applicant's invention in terms of basic principle and is<br>
not suited for the purpose of applicant's objectives.<br>
It is totally irrelevant. 2. German Patent DE<br>
19849821 A:<br>
This discloses an insert member having collapsible<br>
wing like portions (element 14 in the drawing) . The insert<br>
has grooves 9 and 4 at 90. degree.. The insert is to be<br>
pushed through are sent of grooves when the wing portions<br>
fold along the surface of the cylindrical outer surface and<br>
then it is twisted so that the wings are released and get<br>
locked the two grooves 9 and 4 are accordingly formed with<br>
precision. At the termination of the group 9, starts groove<br>
4 .<br><br>
This is also a totally different article and has<br>
nothing to do with the applicant's invention. 3. U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 3,031,049:<br>
This Patent pertains to a fastening device for metal<br>
constructions for fastening together elements thereof or<br>
for fastening separate parts or accessories into the metal<br>
construction. If recommends, the use of frames, ribs and<br>
fillets and especially formed fastening element.<br>
As the name suggests, it is a fastening device for<br>
metal construction, whereas, the applicant's invention is<br>
for fastening device between a metal and a non-metallic<br>
construction in a vibrating structure.<br>
The Patent has nothing in common with the applicant's<br>
invention and is not suitable for the purposes for which<br>
the applicant's invention is concerned with. 4. U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,379,912:<br>
This Patent is also irrelevant to applicant's<br>
invention in that it relates to an arrangement for<br>
connecting a cover panel for an electrical while the body<br>
structure of a vehicle using locking bolts etc. 5. U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 1,647,783:<br>
This Patent is nearly 80 years old, filed in 1924.<br>
The screen panel and fixing arrangement of the instant<br>
invention can not be even margined from this very old<br>
document. This U.S. patent is entirely different in that it<br>
refers to a non-resilient headed fastener having a neck and<br>
casting and an attaching member. 6. A more or less similar<br>
construction is disclosed in another 80 years old U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 1,581,206 also filed in Dec. 1924. 7. U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,984,798 :<br><br>
In this Patent, there is disclosed an assembly and a<br>
display device for the playing pieces of a two sided<br>
puzzle. There are spring mechanisms and side walls' on two<br>
complimentary sheets which is entirely different from<br>
applicant's invention.<br>
The applicant's invention differs basically from all<br>
the prior art known and discussed above in that the<br>
applicant is concerned with a fastening device in a<br>
vibrating structure contrary to static bodies of the prior<br>
art. More over in the applicant's construction a metallic<br>
and a nonmetallic bodies are used<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore a primary object of this invention to<br>
propose a simple fixing means for screen panel, which can<br>
be easily mounted and dismounted.<br>
It is another object to propose such a .fixing means,<br>
which can be precision made and can be easily maintained.<br>
It is a further object, such that the fixing means<br>
can last longer without getting affected frequently.<br>
It is a further object, such that the fixing screens<br>
is not subjected to lot of wear and tear.<br>
It is yet another object to propose such a fixing<br>
means, which will facilitate independent and individual<br>
lifting and dismantling of any screen panel, which requires<br>
replacement.<br>
It is an yet another object to propose a fixing<br>
means, which can be made of wide variety of materials,<br>
which can be selected from metal, rubber, synthetic resins<br>
and reinforced materials and can be precision made.<br><br>
It is a further object to propose a novel screen<br>
panel for use with the novel screen fixing means with the<br>
advantage of more screening area, less wear and tear, less<br>
replacement and individual replacements.<br>
These and other object will be clear from the<br>
following paragraphs.<br>
BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a<br>
fixing means for fixing a screen panel on a support<br>
structure comprising an insert member adopted to fit into a<br>
bore formed on the underside of corner of a screen panel,<br>
said insert having principally the following geometries: a.<br>
a first upper curved surface forming the major part of the<br>
insert and having a uniform curvature of substantially more<br>
than a semicircle, b. a second intermediate cylindrical<br>
grooved portion, being contiguous with the lowermost end of<br>
the first curved portion and being considerably smaller in<br>
cross section compared to 'the upper curved portion, c. a<br>
third lower straight cylindrical surface which is a<br>
straight cylindrical portion contiguous with the said<br>
second groove portion and being is smaller in cross section<br>
compared to the major top curved first portion, d. a fourth<br>
straight substantially horizontal surface and e. said<br>
insert having an inner vertical bore of suitable dimension<br>
to accommodate a holding means such as a bolt, a screw or<br>
other equivalent to fixedly hold the insert onto a panel<br>
support member.<br>
In the assembled condition, a. the said second groove<br>
portion simply fits onto a suitably formed inner ring<br>
portion in the insert and b. the third lower cylindrical<br><br>
portion, when assembled, snugly rests along side the said<br>
third portion namely cylindrical portion of the insert.<br>
There is also provided a screen panel adopted to be<br>
mounted on a screen support and held to the same comprising<br>
a screen panel having vertical bores on the underside at<br>
predetermined locations adopted to receive a screen fixing<br>
means disclosed earlier.<br>
The screen panel has the further features as follows:<br>
i. The bore on the underside of the scre'en is preferably"<br>
formed on the four corners, one at each corner, ii. the<br>
said bore has preferably five geometries as follows: a. a<br>
first upper straight closed circular portion b. a second<br>
lower cylindrical portion depending from the said first<br>
portion c. a third inner cylindrical ring portion<br>
contiguous with the said second portion d. a fourth lower<br>
straight cylindrical portion contiguous with the said ring<br>
portion e. a last substantially open circular portion f. a<br>
said second portion, namely the straight cylindrical<br>
portion being substantially bigger in height than the said<br>
fourth straight cylindrical portion.<br>
When assembled, the outer surface of the said curved<br>
portion of the insert and the upper inner end of the bore<br>
provide an annular space between the same. The top said<br>
second cylindrical portion and the fourth cylindrical<br>
portion are in the same vertical plane.<br>
In a modification of the screen, the bore is fitted<br>
with a. bolt and the insert is arranged on the support<br>
structure.<br>
Similarly in a modification of the fixing means the<br>
insert is accommodated on the support structure to simply<br>
fit a bolt fixed in the bore of the panel member.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In the accompanying drawings:<br>
FIG. 1 shows schematically the bottom view of a<br>
screen panel according to this invention.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a section of a part of the panel.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a screen member fixed on a pair of<br>
support members.<br>
FIG. 4 shows an exploded view of FIG. 3.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
It will be seen from FIG. 1 that the screen panel (1)<br>
has been provided with suitable bore holes (2) at the<br>
bottom from corners of suitable dimension and shape. The<br>
bore hole, as will be seen, has an internally extending<br>
integrally formed ring member (2a).<br>
The bore hole has straight cylindrical walls (2b and<br>
2c) above and below the internal ring (2a).<br>
The top portion (2d) of the bore hole is preferably<br>
flat and straight to serve the purposes of the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the upper cylindrical portion (2c) is<br>
longer than the lower cylindrical portion (2b) , which is<br>
also specially designed for the purposes of the invention.<br>
The fixing means is a plug member or insert 3 made of<br>
any suit-able material for the purposes of the invention.<br>
The insert 3 has four different geometries as<br><br>
The upper portion (4a) is of a curved nature having a<br>
predetermined radius of curvature to sit within the upper<br>
cylindrical portion of the bore.<br>
It is important to note that this is not a snugly<br>
fitting plug so far as the top curved portion is concerned.<br>
It will be clearly seen from FIG. 3 that above the<br>
internal ring portion, there is an annular gap formed<br>
between the outer surface of the curved portion of the<br>
insert and inner surface of the upper cylindrical part of<br>
the bore.<br>
This is also specially formed for the purposes of the<br>
invention.<br>
The insert has a second geometry in the form of a<br>
cylindrical groove 4b to match the inner ring of the bore<br>
when assembled.<br>
Below the cylindrical groove, the insert has a<br>
straight cylindrical portion 4c which is formed to match<br>
the lower cylindrical inner portion of the bore.<br>
These dimensions are to be very judiciously selected<br>
and formed with meticulous care.<br>
The fourth geometry of the insert is a straight<br>
surface 4d to lie flush with the under surface of the<br>
panel.<br>
The fixing means further includes the support<br>
structure 5 on which the insert is fixed through a bolt,<br>
preferably a hexagonal bolt. For the purpose, the insert<br>
itself is provided with a suitable hexagonal bore 5a.<br><br>
The bore and the bolt can also replaced by screwing<br>
arrangement.<br>
It will thus be appreciated that the whole<br>
arrangement is simple and convenient.<br>
Operation of the Device<br>
The screen panel is provided with preferably four<br>
bore holes at the lower surface at the four corners of the<br>
same formed meticulously to the required measures.<br>
If desired, more such bores can be formed on the<br>
bottom sides but it is not necessary.<br>
This has greatly helped us to retain all the<br>
screening surface of the screen panel and thus more<br>
operational area is available to us. This has a positive<br>
significant effect on the efficiency of operation, rate of<br>
load handled, total load screened, power consumption,<br>
labour cost and also on wear and tear.<br>
The suitably formed inserts are fixed on the frame<br>
and the underside of the screen panel is brought in<br>
alignment of the inserts and the bores.<br>
By simply pressing the panel on these inserts<br>
carefully and evenly in horizontal manner, the panel gets<br>
snap fitted on the support.<br>
There is no plug during operation.<br>
It has also given us the advantage of forming more<br>
screening area along the four sides of the panel because we<br>
have made use of only the undersides of the four corners of<br>
the panel. A number of panels can thus be easily fitted.<br><br>
When it is desired to remove a panel, it is simply-<br>
necessary to prise out a free side of the panel and it<br>
comes out easily and effortlessly.<br>
There is no need to interfere with the fixing<br>
elements at all.<br>
Further, the replacement can be carried out even<br>
during the operation of the screen and this is possible for<br>
inexperienced hand.<br>
Thus, the down time is also minimized and can be<br>
eliminated.<br>
In another embodiment, the bolt can be fixed into the<br>
bore and the insert fixed to the support structure so that<br>
the same snap action can be carried out easily even by<br>
inexperienced hand.<br>
It is obvious for those skilled in the art that as<br>
the technology develops the basic idea of the invention can<br>
be implemented in various ways. The invention and the<br>
embodiments thereof are thus not restricted to the examples<br>
described above, but they may vary within the scope of the<br>
claims.<br><br>
