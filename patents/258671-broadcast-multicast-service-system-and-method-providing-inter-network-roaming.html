Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication system and, more par-<br>
ticularly, to a broadcast/multicast service system and method supporting inter-network<br>
roaming in order to provide a broadcast/multicast service to a user when the user roams<br>
in a visiting network which may or may not be a broadcast type network.<br>
Background Art<br>
A broadcast/multicast service (referred to hereinafter as 'BCAST service') is a new<br>
type of service that provides a sky wave broadcast or supplementary information to a<br>
mobile terminal. The BCAST service includes both a broadcast service and a multicast<br>
service. A broadcast service, offered by a service provider, transmits usable in-<br>
formation to' every user who has subscribed to the services of the service provider. A<br>
multicast service, also offered by a service provider, transmits information only to a<br>
certain group of users who have subscribed for a specific subject or contents.<br>
Currently, in the mobile communication network, a simple service is provided to<br>
provide simple information to users:, but the BCAST service providing a multimedia<br>
type broadcast or various contents to users roaming in the mobile communication<br>
network is not provided yet<br>
Further, in a situation where the BCAST service is independently operated by each<br>
BCAST service provider, if a user who has subscribed to a specific service provider is<br>
moved to an area of a different service provider, continuity of the BCAST service for<br>
the user is not provided.<br>
In addition, when the user who has subscribed for a specific BCAST service with<br>
the user's home network roams to a. visiting network, there is no procedure, system or<br>
mechanism by which the BCAST service contents of the home network are provided to<br>
the user roaming in the visiting network. If the visiting network is a non-broadcast type<br>
network or is a broadcast type network which may be the same type as or different<br>
from the home network, there is no defined procedure by which the user roaming in the<br>
visiting network can obtain the BCAST service of the home network or the BCAST<br>
service of the visiting network. This inconveniences the user greatly.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[24]	A broadcast/multicast (BCAST) service system and method that provide inter-<br>
network roaming in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention<br>
will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
[25]	In the present invention, when a user (having a mobile terminal) who has<br>
subscribed to a BCAST service offered by a home network of the terminal roams from<br>
the home network to a visiting network, the user can receive, in the visiting network,<br>
the same BCAST service that is provided in the home network. In this case, the<br>
visiting network may transmit a service guide of the home network to the user in the<br>
visiting network, or incorporate the service guide of the home network with the visiting<br>
network's service guide and transmits it to the user in the visiting network.<br>
[26]	In the present invention, when a user who has subscribed to a specific BCAST<br>
service roams from the user's home network to a visiting network, the visiting network<br>
checks service authentication of the user from the home network and provides a public<br>
key (right object) used to view contents of the BCAST service in the visiting network,<br>
to the terminal of the user.<br>
[27]	In the present invention, when a user who has subscribed to a specific BCAST<br>
service roams from a broadcast type network to another same broadcast type network,<br>
or to a different broadcast type network, or to a non-broadcast type network, the user<br>
can still receive the BCAST service through the roamed network.<br>
[28]	Figure 1 is a block diagram showing the construction of a BCAST service system<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention. All the components of the<br>
BCAST service system are operatively coupled.<br>
[29]	As shown in Figure 1, the BCAST service system includes a contents provider<br>
(content creation) 10 for providing contents to distribute in the BCAST service, a<br>
broadcast/multicast (BCAST) server 17 for providing a BCAST service to a user or<br>
performing protection of the contents or mamtaining/rnanaging the BCAST service,<br>
and a terminal 30 for receiving a BCAST service selected by the user from the BCAST<br>
server 17. The terminal 30 is a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone, a PDA, etc.<br>
and includes known elements including an input unit (e.g., a keypad, buttons, etc.), a<br>
controller, a memory, etc.<br>
[30]	The BCAST service system additionally includes a broadcast distribution system<br>
(BDS) 20 or an interaction network (IN) 22 for distributing the BCAST service and<br>
performing an interaction function for bi-directional communication, and/or a BDS<br>
service distribution (BDS-SD) unit 18 for applying the interaction network according<br>
to a bearer. The units 18, 20 and 22 are involved in distributing the BCAST service<br><br>
contents provided by the server 17 to an appropriate device such as the terminal 30 or a<br>
home or visiting network.<br>
[31]	The BDS 20 or the interaction network 22 is a bearer providing a BCAST service<br>
such as a DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting-Handled), an MBMS (Multimedia<br>
Broadcast Multicast Service), a BCMCS (Broadcast Multicast Service), an ISDB-T<br>
(Integrated Service Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial), or a T/S DMB<br>
(Terrestrial/Satellite-Digital Multimedia Broadcasting). Thus the BDS 20 and the in-<br>
teraction network 22 support the broadcasting mechanism.<br>
[32]	The BCAST server 17 includes a BCAST service application (BSA) unit 12 for<br>
performing functions such as protecting BCAST service contents and/or mamtaining/<br>
managing the BCAST service, a BCAST service distribution/adaptation (BSDA) unit<br>
14 for performing and controlling broadcasting, interface and contents scheduling<br>
function by using a specific bearer (DVB-H, MBMS, BCMCS, etc.), and a BCAST<br>
subscription management (BSM) unit 16 for performing functions of protecting/<br>
managing service/contents and maintaining/managing user subscription information inorder to manage users who have subscribed to the BCAST service. In this case, the<br>
BSA unit 12, the BCAST service distribution/adaptation unit 14 and the BCAST sub-<br>
scription/management unit 16 of ths BCAST server 17 transmit or exchange in-<br>
formation and signals to each other or with each other through internal communication.<br>
Communications from the BSDA unit 14 and the BSM unit 16 may be communicated<br>
to a final destination device (e.g., the terminal 30) directly or through one or more of<br>
the BDS-SD unit 18, the BDS 20, and the interaction network 22.<br>
[33]	The terminal 30 includes an application/software for receiving the BCAST service<br>
and an application for storing and editing a portion of a BCAST service list provided<br>
by the BCAST service provider and storing information on a channel preferred by the<br>
user. A BCAST service preference list edited and generated by the user by reflecting<br>
the preferences of the user based on the BCAST service list provided; by the service<br>
provider is called a wish list. The terminal 30 and its associated network (e.g., the<br>
home network) may include an application for managing the wish list, which is called<br>
a wish list management application. The terminal 30 can be a mobile phone, a PDA,<br>
etc., but is not limited thereto and can be any device that is configured to receive<br>
BCAST services.<br>
[34]	The wish list management application manages the wish list separately, and when a<br>
user of a terminal who has subscribed to a service of a specific provider roams to a<br>
service area of a different provider and receives a different BCAST service list<br>
provided by the corresponding provider, the wish list management application stores<br>
and edits a portion of the wish list. When the service provider of the visiting network<br>
to which the user has roamed does not provide a service list with respect to the BCAST<br><br>
provided in the terminal's home network, the wish list management application<br>
receives the service list from the home network in advance and stores it, or stores a<br>
service selected by the user among the provided service list in the wish list in advance.<br>
[35]	A service provider providing a specific service can transfer a list of services<br>
provided in a network of a different service provider with which the service provider<br>
has made a roaming contract as well as a list of services provided in its own network.<br>
In this case, the service provider should indicate that the service is a service provided<br>
by a different provider and not by the service provider itself. Namely, the BCAST<br>
server includes a wish list checking application which fetches a wish list of the user's<br>
terminal and checks whether the BCAST server can currently provide any service on<br>
the wish list, and if the BCAST service cannot provide the services on the wish list, it<br>
checks whether a different provider or a different server can provide it.<br>
[36]	The wish list checking application may exist in every BCAST server, and when a<br>
roaming contact exists between service providers, wish list checking applications in the<br>
BCAST servers of different providers can interwork so that a service requested by theuser can be provided among BCAST services provided by each BCAST server. It<br>
should be noted that 'a wish list of the terminal' and 'a wish list of the user' refer to the<br>
same and are used below interchangeably.<br>
[37]	The BCAST server 17 periodically can check the wish list of the terminal 30 and<br>
store it as part of the server 17's stored service broadcast list (server BCAST list)<br>
therein or in a separate storage unit outside the BCAST server. The BCAST server 17<br>
can store therein (or in a separate storage unit) information on services which have<br>
been provided by different service providers to each requesting user. Thus, when a<br>
certain user requests a BCAST service thereafter, the BCAST server 17 searches its<br>
storage unit and obtains the current user's history of the BCAST service. And this in-<br>
formation can be used by the BCAST server or others to provide the requested BCAST<br>
service to the current user more easily and quickly. In addition, even if the user does<br>
not provide the user's wish list to the BCAST server, since the BCAST server stores<br>
the corresponding information, the BCAST service can be provided to the user.<br>
[38]	Figure 2 illustrates three different examples in which a terminal may roam and still<br>
receive a BCAST service according to the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[39]	As shown in Fig. 2, a user of the terminal can roam between the same broadcast<br>
type networks (e.g., between MBMSs), can roam between different broadcast type<br>
networks (e.g., between the MBMS and the DVB-H), or can roam between a broadcast<br>
type network and a non-broadcast type network. In the third example, the broadcast<br>
type network is not limited to the MBMS or the DVB-H, but can be the BCMCS,<br>
ISDB-T, T/S-DMB, or others, and the non-broadcast type network can be the GSM or<br>
CDMA, which does not directly offer the BCAST service or does not support the<br><br>
broadcasting mechanism.<br>
[40]	In some embodiments of the present invention, when the terminal (user) has<br>
subscribed to one or more BCAST services of a home network and roams to another<br>
network (visiting network) which may be the same type of broadcast network or a<br>
different type of broadcast network the visiting network is configured to provide the<br>
BCAST service of the home network to the terminal by obtaining the BCAST service<br>
of the home network and broadcasting the BCAST service (contents) to the terminal in<br>
the visiting network. In another embodiment, the BCAST service of the visiting<br>
network may be provided to the terminal roaming in the visiting network, once the<br>
visiting network performs a service authorization check of the terminal through the<br>
home network of the terminal. Further, even if the visiting network is a non-broadcast<br>
type network, which does not support the broadcasting mechanism, the visiting<br>
network can still provide the BCAST service of the home network to the terminal<br>
roaming in the visiting network using a unitcast method. For example, even if the<br>
 visiting network is a non-broadcast type network and only provides a general mobile<br>
communication service, the visiting network can still provide an MBMS service or a<br>
DVB-H service to the terminal.<br>
[41]	Figure 3 is a signal flow chart of a BCAST service method according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. It is assumed that a user of a terminal 300 has a<br>
subscription to one or more BCAST services offered by a home network 100 of the<br>
terminal 300 before the user roams to a visiting network 200. The home network 100<br>
may include a BSA unit 110, a BSM unit 120, a BSDA unit 130, and a BDS-SD unit or<br>
BDS or IN 140. The visiting network 200 may include a BSA unit 210, a BSM unit<br>
220, a BSDA unit 230, and a BDS-SD unit or BDS or IN 240. The terminal 300 has<br>
the same configuration as the terminal 30 in Fig. 1. These components of the system<br>
have been discussed in connection with Fig. 1. The home network 100 and the visiting<br>
network 200 can be the same brosidcast type networks or different broadcast type<br>
networks. All the components of Fig. 3 are operatively coupled.<br>
[42]	Now, referring to Fig. 3, when the user of the terminal 300, which has roamed from<br>
the home network 100 to the visiting network 200, wants to receive a BCAST service<br>
at a current position (in the visiting network), the user operates a BCAST application<br>
of the terminal 300, and then, the terminal 300 transmits a BCAST service guide<br>
request message or a BCAST service request message to the BSM unit 220 of the<br>
visiting network 200 (step S11). ThiS request message may include identification in-<br>
formation of the user/terminal, etc.<br>
[43]	The BSM unit 220 informs the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting network about the<br>
reception of the BCAST service guide request message or the BCAST service request<br>
message through internal communication (step S13), and checks the service au-<br><br>
thentication of the user of the tenrinal (step S15). For instance, a service authorization<br>
request message is sent from the BSM unit 220 to the BSM 120 of the home network.<br>
In this case, because the BCAST service subscription information of the terminal user<br>
(e.g., information on which service or which service bundle the user has subscribed to)<br>
exists in the home network 100, the BSM unit 220 of the visiting network requests the<br>
subscription information of the user from the BSM unit 120 of the home network (e.g.,<br>
by transmitting the user/terminal ID, etc.) and performs the service authentication. The<br>
service authentication may involve verifying that the current user/terminal is a<br>
subscriber to the BCAST service(s) offered by the home network 100. In the al-<br>
ternative, the home network 100 may perform the actual service authentication and the<br>
visiting network 200 may just receive the result of the service authentication from the<br>
home network 100. In this regard, a service authorization response message from the<br>
BSM unit 120 to the BSM unit 220 may include the result of the service authentication<br>
check and/or other information needed for the subsequent procedures of the visiting<br>
network 200. <br>
[44]	Upon checking the service authentication of the terminal 300, the BSM unit 220 of<br>
the visiting network informs the BSDA unit 230 that the service authentication has<br>
been completed and the current user/terminal is authorized, through internal com-<br>
munication (step S17). At this time, the BSDA unit 230 checks whether there is a wish<br>
list for the current user in a server BCAST list stored in the visiting network 200. The<br>
server BCAST list is stored in the BCAST server of the visiting network 200, and can<br>
exist in the BSA unit 210, in the BSM unit 220 or in the BSDA unit 230, or can be<br>
stored in a separate storage unit. The server BCAST list can be managed by the wish<br>
list checking application. The server BCAST list includes wish lists of a plurality of<br>
different users. A wish list of a user/terminal is the user's preferred BCAST service(s),<br>
which can be selected by the user from a list of all the BCAST services offered by the<br>
user's home network or from a list of all the BCAST services that the user has<br>
subscribed to from the user's home network. The wish list of the terminal may also<br>
include other information such as user information, which may be used to generate a<br>
service guide.<br>
[45]	The wish list of the current user may be stored as part of the server BCAST list<br>
stored in the visiting network 200. For instance, before the user roams to the visiting<br>
network, the visiting network may obtain the wish list of the user in advance through<br>
communication with the home network. This can be accomplished in many different<br>
ways. For instance, once the user subscribes to the BCAST service(s) of the home<br>
network 100 and compiles the user's wish list based on the BCAST service list offered<br>
by the home network 100, the home network 100 can be configured to transmit the<br>
wish list to the visiting network 200 so that it can be prestored in the visiting network<br><br>
200. The system can also be configured such that any updated wish list of the user,<br>
which is stored in the home network 100 and/or the terminal 300, is communicated to<br>
the visiting network 200 from the home network 100 or the terminal 300.<br>
[46]	In the example of Fig. 3, it is assumed that the wish list of the current terminal 300<br>
does not exist on the visiting network's server. However, the scenario in which the<br>
wish list of the current terminal 300 does exist on the visiting network's server, is<br>
discussed later in connection with Fig. 4.<br>
[47]	If the wish list of the terminal 300 does not exist in the server BCAST list at step<br>
S17, the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting network transmits a service guide request<br>
message to the BSDA unit 130 of the home network 100 (step S19). Then the BSDA<br>
unit 130 of the home network collects various information (e.g., subscription in-<br>
formation, user's wish list, etc.) for generating a service guide for the current terrninal<br>
300, from the BSM unit 120 and the BSA unit 110 of the home network 100 via<br>
internal communication (step S21). Thereafter, the BSDA unit 130 generates the<br>
ervice guide (BGAST servic guide) base on the wise list of the current terminal<br>
[48]	The BSDA unit 130 of the home network transmits the generated service guide to<br>
the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting network (step S23), and the BSDA unit 230 of the<br>
visiting network transmits the service guide to the terminal 300 (step S25). In this case,<br>
the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting network can transmit the service guide received<br>
from the B SDA unit 130 of the home network to the terminal 300, or can transmit a<br>
new service guide obtained by incorporating a service guide of the visiting network<br>
200 into the service guide received from the BSDA unit 130 of the home network.<br>
Namely, the service guide transmitted to the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting network<br>
from the BSDA unit 130 of the home network and the service guide transmitted from<br>
the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting network to the terminal 300 can be same service<br>
guides or different service guides. In step S31, the visiting network 200 broadcasts the<br>
service guide to the terminal 300 by using its broadcasting mechanism, e.g., through a<br>
broadcast distribution system (e.g., BDS 20 in Fig. 1) or an interaction network (e.g.,<br>
IT 22 in Fig. 1).<br>
[49]	When the user checks the BCAST service guide received by the terrninal 300 and<br>
selects contents (BCAST service) desired to be received among the programs or<br>
services identified in the BCAST service guide, the terminal 300 transmits a BCAST<br>
contents request message to the B SDA unit 230 of the visiting network (step S27). In<br>
this case, the desired contents are a BCAST service provided in the home network.<br>
Thus the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting network transmits the BCAST contents request<br>
message to the BSDA unit 130 of the home network (step S27).<br>
[50]	Upon receiving the BCAST contents request message, the BSDA unit 130 receives<br>
contents requested by the user from a contents provider 50 through internal com-<br><br>
munication with the BSA unit 110 (step S29), and transmits the received contents<br>
(BCAST service) to the terminal 300 through the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting<br>
network (step S31). The visiting network 200 transmits the contents to the terminal 300<br>
by using its broadcasting mechanism. Accordingly, the user roaming in the visiting<br>
network receives the BCAST service of the user's home network.<br>
[51]	Figure 4 is a signal flow chart of a BCAST service method according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, wherein a current terminal 300 roams to a<br>
visiting network 200. The system components discussed in the embodiment of Fig. 3<br>
are also provided in the embodiment of Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, there is a wish list of the<br>
current terminal 300 in the server BCAST list of the BCAST server of the visiting<br>
network 200, which differs from the embodiment of Fig. 3. The home network 100 and<br>
the visiting network 200 can be the same broadcast type networks or different<br>
broadcast type networks. It is assumed that the user of the terminal 300 has a sub-<br>
scription to one or more BCAST services offered by the home network 100 of the<br>
 terminal 300 before the user roams to the visiting network 200. All the components of<br>
Fig. 4 are operatively coupled.<br>
[52]	Referring to Fig. 4, when the user of the terminal 300 which has roamed from the<br>
home network 100 to the visiting network 200 wants to receive a BCAST service at a<br>
current location in the visiting network 200, the user operates a BCAST application of<br>
the terminal 300 and transmits a BCAST service guide request message or a BCAST<br>
service request message to the BSM unit 220 of the visiting network (step S41).<br>
[53]	The BSM unit 220 informs the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting network about the<br>
reception of the BCAST service guide request message or the BCAST service request<br>
message through internal communication (step S43), and checks the service au-<br>
thentication of the terminal/user through the BSM unit 120 of the home network (step<br>
S45). Steps S41, S43 and S45 correspond respectively to steps S11, S13 and S15 of<br>
Fig. 3.<br>
[54]	Upon checking the service authentication of the terminal/user, the BSM unit 220 of<br>
the visiting network informs the BSDA unit 230 that the service authentication of the<br>
current terminal 300 has been completed and the current user is authorized to receive<br>
the BCAST service, through internal communication (step S47). Then in step S47, the<br>
B SDA unit 220 of the visiting network checks whether there is a wish list of the<br>
terminal 300 in the server BCAST list. The server BCAST list exists in the BCAST<br>
server of the visiting network, and it can exist in the BSA unit 210, in the BSM unit<br>
220 or in the BSDA unit 230, and can be managed by the wish list checking ap-<br>
plication.<br>
[55]	If there is the wish list of the terminal 300 in the server BCAST list of the visiting<br>
network, the BSDA unit 230 transmits a BCAST service guide to me terminal 300<br><br>
(step 49). In this case, the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting network can transmit the<br>
BCAST service guide of the home network 100 based on the wish list of the terminal<br>
300 to the terminal 300, or can transmit a new service guide obtained by incorporating<br>
the BCAST service guide of the vi siting network 200 to the BCAST service guide of<br>
the home network 100, to the terminal 300. In addition, the BSDA unit 230 of the<br>
visiting network can collect various information (e.g., BCAST service attribute, etc.)<br>
from the BSM unit 220 of the visiting network and the BSA unit 210, for generating a<br>
service guide of the terminal 300 based on the wish list of the terminal 300 and<br>
generate the BCAST service guide for the terminal 300. The visiting network 200 can<br>
transmit the service guide to the terminal 300 by using its broadcasting mechanism,<br>
e.g., through a broadcast distribution system (e.g., BDS 20 in Fig. 1) or an interaction<br>
network (e.g.,-IT 22 in Fig. 1).<br>
[56]	When the user checks the BCAST service guide received by the terminal 300 and<br>
selects contents desired to be received among programs or services described in the<br>
service guide, the terminal 300 transmits a BCAST contents request message to the <br>
BSDA unit 130 of the home network through the BSDA unit 230 of the visiting<br>
network (step S51).<br>
[57]	Upon receiving the BCAST contents request message, the BSDA unit 130 of the<br>
home network receives contents requested by the user from a contents provider 50<br>
through internal communication with the BSA unit 110 (step S53), and transmits the<br>
received contents (BCAST service) to the terminal 300 through the BSDA unit 230 of<br>
the visiting network (step S55). The visiting network 200 transmits the BCAST service<br>
contents to the terminal 300 by using its broadcasting mechanism. Accordingly, the<br>
user roaming in the visiting network receives the BCAST service of the user's home<br>
network.<br>
[58]	Figure 5 is a signal flow chart of a BCAST service method according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment differs from the embodiments<br>
of Figs. 3 and 4 in that the visiting network 400 is a non-broadcast type network.<br>
Although the visiting network 400 does not directly offer the BCAST service, the<br>
terminal user receives the BCAST service through a uni-cast method of the visiting<br>
network according to this embodiment. The user of the terminal 300 has subscribed to<br>
the BCAST service of the home network before the user roams to the visiting network<br>
400. All the components of Fig. 5 are operatively coupled.<br>
[59]	As shown in Figure 5, since the non-broadcast type network (visiting network 400)<br>
indicated by a wireless network or a mobile communication network does not have an<br>
entity for providing the BCAST service, it transmits a service guide and/or contents<br>
transmitted from the home network 100 to the current terminal 300 through its packet<br>
switched network. That is, communications between the visiting network 400 and the<br><br>
terminal 300 occur using existing communication protocols between the visiting<br>
network 400 and the terminal 300.<br>
[60]	Referring to Fig. 5, when the user of the terminal 300 roams or moves from the<br>
user's home network 100 (namely, a broadcast type network) to another network (the<br>
visiting network 400, namely a non-broadcast type network), the user operates the<br>
BCAST application of the user's terminal 300 and the terminal 300 transmits a BCAST<br>
service guide request message or a BCAST service request message to the non-<br>
broadcast type visiting network 400 (step S61).<br>
[61]	Upon receiving the request message, the non-broadcast type visiting network (e.g.,<br>
a server therein) 400 requests the BSM unit 120 of the home network 100 to check the<br>
service authentication of the terminal user (step S63), and the BSM unit 120 of the<br>
home network checks the service authentication of the terminal user and transmits a<br>
response message including the service authentication result to the non-broadcast type<br>
visiting network 400 (step S65). In this case, because the BCAST service subscription<br>
 information of the terminal user(e.g., information on which service or which servica <br>
bundle the user has subscribed to) exists in the home network 100, the visiting network<br>
400 requests the subscription info:rmation of the user from the BSM unit 120 of the<br>
home network (e.g., by transmitting the user/terminal ID, etc.) and performs the<br>
service authentication. The service authentication may involve verifying that the<br>
current user/terminal is a subscriber to the BCAST service(s) offered by the home<br>
network 100. In the alternative, the home network 100 may perform the actual service<br>
authentication and the visiting network 400 may just receive the result of the service<br>
authentication from the home network 100.<br>
[62]	Upon checking the service authentication of the terminal 300, the non-broadcast<br>
type visiting network 400 transmits a service guide request message to the BSDA unit<br>
130 of the home network (step S67). Upon receiving the service guide request<br>
message, the BSDA unit 130 of the home network collects service guide information<br>
of the terminal 300 from the BSM unit 120 of the home network and the BSA unit 110<br>
through internal communication (step S69). In this case, since the visiting network 400<br>
is a non-broadcast type and thus does not have an entity for providing the BCAST<br>
service (via a broadcasting mechanism), the visiting network 400 does not itself have a<br>
wish list of the terminal 300 or a service guide with respect to the BCAST service<br>
provided from the home network or any other network. Accordingly, the visiting<br>
network 400 must obtain the service guide of the terminal 300 from the BSDA unit<br>
130 of the home network, and the BSDA unit 130 of the home network collects the<br>
service guide information for the current terminal 300 based on the wish list of the<br>
terminal 300 prestored in the home network or provided by the tenninal 300.<br>
[63]	The BSDA unit 130 of the home network then generates a BCAST service guide for<br><br>
the current terminal 300 using the collected service guide information. The BSDA unit<br>
130 then transmits the generated service guide to the visiting network 400 (step S71),<br>
and the visiting network 400 transmits the service guide to the terminal 300 (step S71).<br>
In this case, the service guide transmitted by the visiting network 400 to the terminal<br>
300 is the same as the service guide received from the home network 100.<br>
[64]	When the user checks the BCAST service guide received by the terminal 300 and<br>
selects contents desired to be received among programs or services listed in the service<br>
guide, the terminal 300 transmits a BCAST contents request message to the BSDA unit<br>
130 of the home network through the visiting network 400 (step S73).<br>
[65]	Upon receiving the BCAST contents request message, the BSDA unit 130 of the<br>
home network receives contents requested by the user from a contents provider 50<br>
through internal communication with the BSA unit 110 (step S75), and transmits the<br>
corresponding contents to the terminal 300 through the non-broadcast type visiting<br>
network 400 (step S77). In this case, the visiting network 400, which has received the<br>
	contents, (BCAST service) from the BSD unit 300 of the home network, transmits the<br>
contents to the terminal 300 through its packet switched network/method since the<br>
visiting network 400 is a non-broadcast type network. Namely, the contents (BCAST<br>
service) are transferred by 1:1 through a uni-cast method only between the server of<br>
the non-broadcast type visiting network 400 and the terminal 300, e.g., through a data<br>
service channel provided in a motile communication network and not through a<br>
broadcast distribution system (BDS) or an interaction network.<br>
[66]	In the embodiment of Fig. 5, if an audio/video codec supported in the network<br>
offering the BCAST service (broadcast type network) and an audio/video codec<br>
supported in a visiting mobile communication network (non-broadcast type network)<br>
do not correspond, a certain transformation process for making the codecs correspond<br>
to each other may be used. For example, if the broadcast type network for providing<br>
BCAST service contents supports MPEG4 while the mobile communication network<br>
(non-broadcast type visiting network) for receiving the BCAST service contents<br>
supports MPEG2, not MPEG4, then the mobile communication network is configured<br>
to decode the MPEG-4 contents received from the broadcast type network, encode<br>
them to MPEG2 and then transmit the MPEG-2 contents to the user terminal. In this<br>
case, a procedure for exchanging a contents coding method supported in the broadcast<br>
type network and a contents coding method supported in the mobile communication<br>
network (non-broadcasting type network) can be added before the contents are<br>
provided, and such a procedure is known. In addition, if the home network knows ca-<br>
pabilities (for example, a supported codec, a data rate, resolution of a screen of the<br>
terminal) of the user's terminal, then corresponding information (e.g., terminars<br>
capability information) can be transmitted to the visiting network so that the visiting<br><br>
network can use the information to suitably transform the contents received from the<br>
home network before transmitting it to the user's terminal.<br>
[67]	In the embodiments of Figs. 3-5, it has been described that the wish list of the<br>
current user is used to generate the service guide to be provided to the terminal<br>
roaming in the visiting network. However, the present invention is not limited thereto,<br>
and encompasses a situation where the wish list of the current user is not used to<br>
generate the service guide to the current user at the terminal. For instance, without<br>
regards to the user's wish list, the service guide, to be provided to the end user at the<br>
terminal 300, may be a service guide generated based on the user's subscription policy,<br>
or can be a service guide that includes all the BCAST services offered by the home or<br>
visiting network.<br>
[68]	Figure 6 is a signal flow chart of a BCAST service method according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a BCAST service guide is<br>
transmitted from a visiting network 200 to a terminal 300 before the terminal requests<br>
 it. That is, the visiting network, which is abroadcast type network, broadcasts its.<br>
service guide repeatedly using its broadcasting mechanism (e.g., BDS or interaction<br>
network) to all terminals roamed into the visiting network. Each terminal then can<br>
request access (request right objects) to one or more BCAST services on the service<br>
guide, and thereby accesses the BCAST service.<br>
[69]	In Fig. 6, it is assumed that the user of the current terminal 300 has a subscription to<br>
one or more (BCAST) services offered by the home network 100 of the terminal 300<br>
before the user roams to the visiting network 200. The home network 100 may include<br>
a BSA unit 110, a BSM unit 120, a BSDA unit 130, and a BDS-SD unit or BDS or IN<br>
140. The visiting network 200 may include a BSA unit 210, a BSM unit 220, a BSDA<br>
unit 230, and a BDS-SD unit or BDS or IN 240. These components have been<br>
discussed in connection with Fig. 1. The home network 100 and the visiting network<br>
200 can be the same broadcast type networks or different broadcast type networks. All<br>
the components of Fig. 6 are operatively coupled.<br>
[70]	Now, referring to Fig. 6, the terminal 300, which has roamed to the visiting network<br>
200, receives a BCAST service guide of the visiting network 200 from the BSDA unit<br>
230 of the visiting network, without being connected with the home network 100 (step<br>
S81). Namely, the visiting network 200 provides its service guide to the terminal 300<br>
which has roamed to the visiting network 200, without the user's request and without<br>
any contact with the home network 100. This may be accomplished by the visiting<br>
network 200 by repeatedly broadcasting its service to all terminals that roamed into the<br>
visiting network 200, e.g., using its broadcasting mechanism.<br>
[71]	Upon checking the service guide, the user requests a use privilege (access in-<br>
formation, e.g., right object(s) RO) in order to access a specific BCAST service<br><br>
identified in the service guide from the BSM unit 220 of the visiting network (step<br>
S83). The use privilege is a right with respect to contents requested by the user or a<br>
right for accessing or using the BCAST service. The BSM unit 220 of the visiting<br>
network receives this request and also checks the service authentication of the cor-<br>
responding terminal 300 from the BSM unit 120 of the home network. Namely, the<br>
BSM unit 220 of the visiting network transmits a service authentication request<br>
message to the BSM unit 120 of the home network (step S85), and the BSM unit 120<br>
of the home network checks the service authentication of the terminal and transmits a<br>
service authentication response message to the BSM unit 220 of the visiting network<br>
(step S87). The service authentication response message includes the result of the<br>
service authentication. The service authentication may involve detenriining whether or<br>
not the current terminal 300 is a subscriber of the home network 100, and examining in<br>
detail the subscription policy of ths user of the terminal 300 so as to determine whether<br>
or not the user should receive the specific BCAST service requested by the user at step<br>
 S81. The actual service authentication can be performed by the home network 100, or<br>
the visiting network, or in part by the home network and in part by the visiting<br>
network.<br>
[72]	If the service authentication result indicates that the terminal 300 is authorized to<br>
receive the BCAST service, the BSM unit 220 of the visiting network transmits the use<br>
privilege (access information such as RO) for allowing access and/or use of the<br>
specific BCAST service requested by the user, to the user (step S89). RO can be a key<br>
or code to open or decrypt the BCAST service (contents). The BSDA unit 230 of the<br>
visiting network transmits the user-requested contents (BCAST service) to the terminal<br>
300 through its broadcasting mechanism (step S91). In this case, the BSDA unit 230<br>
and the BSM unit 220 may transmit or exchange information and signals through<br>
internal communication.<br>
[73]	Upon receiving the contents, the terminal 300 accesses or interprets the received<br>
contents by using the RO. The BSM unit 220 of the visiting network generates<br>
charging (billing) information (e.g., charges regarding the use of the contents, etc.)<br>
according to the use of the corresponding contents (S93), and the visiting network 200<br>
can send the generated charging information to the home network 100 so that the user<br>
can be billed appropriately by the home network. The visiting network 200 sends the<br>
charging information to the home network 100 for the services the visiting network<br>
provided since the user has a subscription contract with the home network 100. The<br>
charging information may include any other service fee of the visiting network 200 for<br>
allowing the roaming user to receive a BCAST service.<br>
[74]	According to the present invention, the step of generating the charging information<br>
in step S93 may also be performed in other embodiments, e.g., in the embodiments of<br><br>
Figs. 3-5. For instance, if the visiting network merely passes on the BCAST service<br>
contents provided by the home network, the charging information may include any<br>
service fee of the visiting network 200 for merely passing on the BCAST service<br>
contents.<br>
[75]	As so far described, the broadest/multicast service system and method for<br>
supporting inter-network roaming in accordance with the embodiments of the present<br>
invention have many advantages.<br>
[76]	For example, after the terminal roams into a visiting network, it can now receive the<br>
same BCAST service as the BCAST service that the terminal has received in the home<br>
network, at a current location in the visiting network.<br>
[77]	In addition, because the user can set and receive his/her preferred BCAST service<br>
with continuity regardless of its position (e.g., whether the user is currently located in<br>
the home network or visiting network), the user's convenience and satisfaction for<br>
receiving the BCAST service can be enhanced greatly.<br>
[78] Theforegoing embodiments and advantage are merely exemplary and are not to be	<br>
construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied<br>
to other types of apparatuses or systems. The description of the preferred embodiments<br>
of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the<br>
claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the<br>
structure described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural<br>
equivalents but also equivalent structures.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
BROADCAST/MULTICAST SERVICE SYSTEM AND<br>
METHOD PROVIDING ESTER-NETWORK ROAMING<br>
A method and system for providing a broadcast/multicast (BCAST) service, are<br>
provided to guarantee continuity of the BCAST service even when a user roams in the<br>
same network or between different networks. The method involves transmitting a<br>
BCAST service guide to terminal 300 (S81), receiving a request from the terminal 300<br>
to access at least one BCAST service based on the service guide (S83), transmitting a<br>
service authorization request to a BSM unit 120 of a home network 100 (S85), receiving<br>
a service authorization response from the BSM unit 120 of the home network 100 (S87)<br>
in response to the service authorization request, transmitting to the terminal 300 at least<br>
one rights object (RO) to access the at least one BCAST service (S89), and providing<br>
the at least one BCAST service to the terminal 300 (S91).</td>
