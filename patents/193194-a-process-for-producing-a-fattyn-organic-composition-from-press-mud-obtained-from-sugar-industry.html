This invention relates to a process for producing a fatty organic composition from press mud obtained from sugar industry and a fatty organic composition produced thereby.<br>
Press mud, an agro-waste product from sugar industry is either dumped or used as a low grade organic fertilizer. It has little economic value.<br>
Solvent extraction of press mud hitherto used has not been found cost effective and eco-friendly as organic solvents are expensive and removal of solvents for recycling requires sophisticated equipments.<br>
An object of this invention is to develop a novel process for producing fatty organic composition from press mud which is simple, eco-friendly and cost effective. Press mud obtained from sugar industry is treated with an aqueous solution of any known surfactant at elevated temperature. After removing the extract, the residual filter cake is repeatedly extracted with water. For more uniform composition and to reduce volumes, the filtrates obtained at different stages were mixed and evaporated to dryness. The dry matter obtained thereby is then extracted with chloroform and the fatty organic composition recovered from the chloroform extract by evaporating the solvent. Extraction with chloroform is done to remove any anionic surfactant contamination from the waxy composition, if so desired.<br><br>
The fatty composition extracted from the press mud finds use as a possible alternate fat viz. a substitute of lanolin wool grease in leather industry. It is also useful as an alternative fat in health care and cosmetic products. However, the latt&gt;' composition of the subject invention neither has any blown nutritive value nor is known to be curative or prophylactic in nature.<br>
The fatt^' composition obtained by this method is a dark coloured mass having an acid value of 3 to 30. a saponification value of 150 to 250, an iodine value of 10 to 50 and a melting point of 50 to 90°C. These physical properties depend mainly on the source of sugar cane from which press mud is obtained.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for producing a fatt\' organic composition trom press mud obtained from sugar industry-comprising treating the press mud with an aqueous anionic surfactant solution such as paraffin sulphonate having C^ to C25 carbon atoms and a molecular weight of 300 to 500 at a temperature of 55 to 95°C. removing the extract by filtration and/or centrifuging, subjecting the residue obtained therefrom to repeated aqueous extraction, mixing the extract obtained initially with the subsequent aqueous extracts, evaporating water therefirom to obtain a dr\' mass, subjecting said diy mass to chloroform extraction and subsequently removing chloroform therefrom in a knovvn manner to obtain the fady organic composition.<br><br>
Addition of an aqueous solution of an anionic surfactant, emulsifies the extractable organic matter in the press mud and improves extraction rates in subsequent aqueous extraction step.<br>
This invention also includes a fatty organic composition when extracted by the novel process according to this invention.<br>
A specific embodiment of this invention will now be described with reference to the following example.<br>
Press mud which is a sugar industry waste product is treated with an aqueous solution containing 20 to 40 parts by weight of a known anionic surfactant (e.g. paraffin sulphonates of high carbon chain of C12 to C25 with a molecular weight range of 300 to 500) in 150 to 250 parts by weight of water. The mixture is heated to a temperature range of 55 to 95°C cooled, filtered and centrifuged. The residue obtained is repeatedly subjected to aqueous extraction with 75 to 125 parts by weight of water. The filtrates obtained fi-om all the stages were mixed and evaporated till a dry mass is obtained. This dry mass is extracted with chloroform to remove anionic surfactant contamination, if any. On removal by distillation/evaporation of chloroform, a dark colour fatty composition is obtained.<br>
The residue obtained after extraction may continue to be used as low grade organic fertilizer with similar effectiveness as press mud.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A process for producing a fatty organic composition from press mud<br>
obtained from sugar industry comprising treating the press mud with<br>
an aqueous anionic surfactant solution such as paraffin sulphonate<br>
having C12 to C25 carbon atoms and a molecular weight of 300 to 500<br>
at a temperature of 55 to 95*^0, removing the extract by filtration<br>
and/or centrifuging, subjecting the residue obtained therefrom to<br>
repeated aqueous extraction, mixing the extract obtained initially with<br>
the subsequent aqueous extracts, evaporating water therefrom to<br>
obtain a dry mass, subjecting said dry mass to chloroform extraction<br>
and subsequently removing chloroform therefrom in a known manner<br>
to obtain the fatty organic composition.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in 1, wherein the initial extract obtained with<br>
an aqeuous anionic surfactant solution is filtered and/or centrifuged<br>
before admixing with the subsequent aqueous extract.<br>
3.	A process for producing a fatty organic composition from press mud<br>
obtained from sugar industry substantially as herein described.<br><br></td>
