COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
L<br>
[See Section 10] "VEHICLE TAILLIGHT<br><br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a Vehicle Taillight.<br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement of a vehicle taillight. [0002]<br>
[Description of the Related Art] An attempt to employ a light-emitting diode (LED) as a<br>
2<br><br>
light source of a taillight is made, and in Fig. 1 in the publication of Japanese Patent No.2863926, entitled "TAILLIGHT DEVICE FOR MOTORCYCLES", for example, a taillight device 6 of two-tiered structure including a taillight unit 6T on the lower part and a stop lamp unit 6S on the upper part is shown. A bulb 9 is employed for the taillight unit 6T and a number of light-emitting diodes 10 are employed for the stop lamp unit 6S. The bulb 9 in the taillight unit 6T is lighted by closing the light switch, and the light-emitting diodes 10 in the stop lamp unit 6S are lighted when braking operation is made.<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 in the above-described publication, the light-emitting diodes 10 are simply and densely arranged on a grid in order to cover the stop light unit 6S of laterally elongated rectangular shape and to obtain a required amount of light, and there is no specific consideration in design.<br>
[0004]<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 1 in the same publication, since the light-emitting diodes 10 are mounted on a relatively thick base 17, the plurality of light-emitting diodes 10 are obliged to be arranged along a substantially vertical plane. Therefore, the light-emitting diodes 10 are forced to be arranged in a simple manner as also shown in Fig. 2, and thus<br>
3<br><br>
it is hard to say that the taillight in the same publication has a construction in which the shape can be determined as desired.<br>
[0005]<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a technique for enabling free determination of the shape of the taillight in which the light-emitting diodes are employed.<br>
[0006]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, a vehicle taillight as set forth in Claim 1 includes a lens being generally inclined longitudinally of the vehicle in such a manner that the upper portion is positioned rearward and the lower portion is positioned frontward and having a lens-cut surface of a predetermined shape, a stepped base being formed in a staircase pattern for more or less equalizing the distance to the lens and having an almost the same outer diameter as the lens-cut surface in rear view, a reflection surface formed on the rear surface of the stepped base, and a plurality of light-emitting diodes mounted on such stepped base so as to be more or less equal in distance to the lens.<br>
[0007]<br>
Since the stepped base is employed, the thickness of the taillight in the direction orthogonal to the lens may be reduced,<br>
4<br><br>
and especially for a motorcycle, an effective utilization of a space in the rear portion of the vehicle may be realized. Since a plurality of light-emitting diodes are disposed at an almost equal distance from the lens, the brightness on the lens surface may be uniformized.<br>
[0008]<br>
Since the lens may be inclined longitudinally of the vehicle, diversification of the shape of the taillight may be achieved, and the flexibility in design may be increased. In addition, since the taillight is constructed of a stepped base mounted with a lens and light-emitting diodes, the number of components may be reduced and thus the number of steps for assembling the taillight may easily be reduced.<br>
[0009]<br>
[Preferred Embodiment of he Invention]<br>
Referring now to the drawings, an embodiment of the present invention will be described. The drawings are to be viewed as reference numerals are seen in the right way.<br>

[Fig. 7]<br>
Fig. 7 is a comparative drawings of the taillight.<br>
6<br><br>
Fig. 1 is a left side view of a vehicle provided with a taillight according to the present invention. A motorcycle 10 as a vehicle is constructed by mounting a front fork 12 on a head pipe ll so as to be capable of turning, mounting a steering handle 14 on a top bridge 13 of the front fork 12, mounting a headlight 16, a front winker 17 and meters 18 between the top bridge 13 and a bottom bridge 15 on the front side via<br>
7<br><br>
a bracket, mounting a front fender 19 and a front wheel 21 at the lower portion of the front fork 12, providing a main frame 22 as a vehicle frame so as to extend rearward from the head pipe 11, providing a down tube 23 so as to extend rearward from obliquely below, interposing an engine 24 between the main frame 22 and the down tube 23, holding the engine 24 on the vehicle frame at three points of a front mounting point 25, an upper rear mounting point 26, and an lower rear mounting point 27, providing a seat rail 28 so as to extend rearward from the main frame 22, mounting a fuel tank 29 and a tandem seat 31 in sequence thereon, providing a sub frame 32 so as to extend from the down tube 23 to the seat rail 28, providing a rear swing arm 34 so as to extend from the lower rear portion of such vehicle body frame via a pivot 33, mounting a rear wheel 35 at the rear end of the rear swing arm 34 so as to be capable of rotation freely, and providing a rear cushion 36 between the rear portion of the rear swing arm 35 and the vehicle body frame (at the joint between the sub frame 32 and the seat rail 28).<br>
[0010]<br>
Reference numeral 37 designates a radiator, numeral 38 designates an air cleaner, numeral 39 designates a throttle valve, numeral 41 designates a cylinder head, numeral 42 designates an exhaust pipe, numeral 43 designates a main stand, numeral 44 designates a silencer, numeral 45 designates a rear<br>
8<br><br>
fender, numeral 45a designates a license light, numeral 46 designates a rear winker, numeral 47 designates a rear cowl, and numeral 48 designates a handrail.<br>
Reference numeral 50 designates a taillight, and the detailed description of the taillight 50 will be made below.<br>
[0011]<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of a vehicle taillight according to the present invention. Left side of the figure is the front, and the right side of the figure is the rear of the vehicle.<br>
The taillight 50 includes a lens 51 generally inclined longitudinally of the vehicle in such a manner that the upper portion is positioned rearward, and the lower portion is positioned forward, a stepped base 52 bent in a staircase pattern or of three-piece construction for being laid almost in parallel with the lens 51, a reflecting surface (indicated by numeral 53 in Fig. 3) formed on the rear surface Of the stepped base 52, and a plurality of light-emitting diodes 54-58 mounted on such stepped base 52 in almost parallel with the lens 51.<br>
[0012]<br>
When the three-piece construction is employed for the stepped base 52, vertical surfaces must simply be provided and horizontal surfaces may be omitted. As a consequence, the stepped base 52 may be constructed only of a plurality of (three,<br>
9<br><br>
when it is three-piece construction) laterally elongated plates. Since the horizontal surfaces may not be provided, material may be saved correspondingly, and it may easily be manufactured, thereby reducing the costs.<br>
[0013]<br>
By providing an angular projection 62 from an upper surface 61 of the lens 51 and inserting the angular projection 62 into a recess 63 formed within a rear cowl 47 in advance, positioning and mounting of the upper surface 61 may be achieved. Such lens 51 forms a substantially hermetical space by being joined up with a case 64, which also has a stepped cross section. The case 64 is a molded article integrally provided with a pocket portion 65. Plashing and switching of brightness of the light-emitting diodes 54-58 may be controlled by integrating a main base 66 in the pocket portion 65, providing a harness 67 so as to extend from the main base 66, attaching a coupler 68 at the extremity thereof, and coupling the coupler 68 with a coupler extending from the controller such as an on-vehicle computer, not shown. More specifically, in this embodiment, the identical light-emit ting diodes 54-58 are also used for a taillight and for a stop lamp by switching the brightness thereof, when they are used for a stop lamp, the brightness is increased than the case where they are used for a taillight, so that they are lighted more brightly.<br>
[0014]<br>
10<br><br>
Reference numeral 69 designates a sub harness for electrically connecting the main base 66 and the stepped base 52. In this embodiment, a circuit required for the taillight may be formed separately on the main base 66 and on the stepped base 52. For example, amain circuit, the diodes, a transistor, resistances, and so on are mounted on the main base 66 in a concentrated manner, and only a power dispatching circuit for the light-emitting diodes 54-58 is provided on the stepped base 52. As a consequence, by forming the stepped base 52 of a metal plate and plating on the rear surface, the base itself may be used as a reflecting surface.<br>
[0015]<br>
Fig. 3 is an enlarged view of a part indicated by numeral 3 in Fig. 2. The stepped base 52 is preferably formed by bending a copper (Cu) plate, which is a good conductor and a good thermal conductor, and glossy metal such as chromium (Cr) is plated or deposited on the rear surface thereof for forming a reflecting surface 53. Since the base 52 is formed of a good thermal conductor, even when the temperature in the hermetically closed space becomes high, the heat may be released quickly to the outside. However, since the light-emitting diodes 54-58 have lower heat generating property than a normal bulb, it is also possible to form the stepped base 52 of resin and form a circuit thereon if it is not necessary to consider about heat.<br><br>
[0016]<br>
Fig. 4 is a drawing view in the direction indicated by an arrow 4 in Fig. 2, showing the taillight 50 viewed horizontally from the rear of the vehicle (hereinafter referred to as a rear view). The lens 51 is formed with a pair of left and right approximately circular lens cut surfaces 72L, 72R (L indicates the left and R indicates the right from the rider, hereinafter), and stepped bases 52L, 52R in almost the same contour as the lens cut surfaces 72L, 72R may be seen in an overlapped manner.<br>
[0017]<br>
Fig. 5 is a drawing taken along the line 5-5 in Fig. 2, and the stepped bases 52L, 52R disposed in a substantially hermetical space are almost round shape having outer diameters as the lens cut surfaces 72L, 72R shown in Fig. 4. Reference numerals 73, 74 are step lines. The figure shows that ten light-emitting diodes 54-58 are uniformly and dispersedly disposed on the substantially circular stepped base 52 and reflecting surfaces 53L, 53R.<br>
[0018]<br>
Therefore, according to the construction shown in Fig. 4, the lens cut surfaces 72L, 72R radiate uniformly. Since the reflecting surfaces are provided only on the stepped bases 52L, 52R, the portion other than the lens cut surfaces 72L, 72R are relatively dark, and thus the pair of left and right<br>
12<br><br>
lens cut surfaces 72L, 72R radiates outstandingly.<br>
[0019]<br>
Fig. 6 is a drawing viewed in the direction of an arrow 6 in Fig. 2, showing that the lens 51 itself has vertically elongated oblong lens cut surfaces 72L, 72R. Although the stepped bases 52L, 52R are shown by broken lines just for reference, they are not accurately drawn in the figure.<br>
[0020]<br>
Fig. 7(a) and (b) are comparative drawings of the taillight.<br>
Fig. 7(a) shows the embodiment of the present invention, that is, a diagrammatic sketch corresponding to Fig. 2, showing that the light-emitting diodes 54-58 are disposed along a line 75 almost in parallel with the lens 51. Since the distances from the light-emitting diodes 54-58 to the lens 51 are almost the same, brightness over the lens 51 is uniform.<br>
[0021]<br>
Fig. 7(b) shows a comparative example, wherein light-emitting diodes 102-106 are disposed on a vertically oriented flat base 101, and an inclined type lens 107 is mounted thereon. In this example, the brightness is apt to be non-uniform in such a manner that the upper portion of the lens 107 far from the light-emitting diodes 102, 103 is darker, and the lower portion of the lens 107 near the light-emitting diodes 105, 106 is brighter. Such non-uniformity in brightness may<br>
13<br><br>
be resolved by increasing brightness of the light-emitting diodes 102, 103 and decreasing brightness of the light-emitting diodes 105, 106 by control. However, in this case, a control circuit for this purpose is additionally required.<br>
[0022]<br>
In this regard, in the example shown in Fig. 7(a), a uniform brightness may easily be maintained, and thus it is not necessary to provide a complex control circuit. In addition, a large space 76 may be secured behind the case 64, and thus on-vehicle components such as electrical equipment may be disposed in this space 76 or this space may be utilized as a small compartment.<br>
[0023]<br>
The vehicle to which the present invention is applied may be any of two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and four-wheeler. However, it is especially suitable for the motorcycle which is limited in storage space in the rear cowl.<br>
The "almost the same outer diameter as the lens cut surface" stated in Claim 1 is to be replaced with "almost the same contour or profile as the lens cut surface" when the lens cut surface is not circular form (for example, oblong or rectangular form).<br>
[0024]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
In the arrangement described above, the present<br>
14<br><br>
invention achieves the following effects.<br>
According to Claim 1, since the stepped base is employed,<br>
the thickness of the taillight in the direction orthogonal to<br>
the lens may be reduced, and thus the space in the rear portion<br>
of the vehicle may be effectively utilized especially in the<br>
case of two-wheelers. In addition, since the plurality of<br>
light-emitting diodes are disposed at the more or less equal<br>
distance from the lens, the brightness over the lens surface<br>
becomes uniform	<br>
[0025]<br>
In  addition,  since  the  lens  may  be  inclined<br>
longitudinally of the vehicle, diversification of the shape<br>
of the taillight may be achieved, and the flexibility in design<br>
may be increased.  In addition, since the taillight is<br>
constructed of a stepped base mounted with a lens and<br>
light-emitting diodes, the number of components may be reduced<br>
and thus the number of steps for assembling the taillight may<br>
easily be reduced.<br>
