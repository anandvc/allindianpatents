 [0001]  The present application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-069030 filed on March 19, 2009 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-069031 filed on March 19, 2009 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Field of the Invention <br><br>
[0002]  The present invention relates to an automatic transmission provided with a planetary gear mechanism with the automatic transmission being mounted in a vehicle.<br><br>
Description of Background Art<br><br>
 [0003] An automatic transmission for a vehicle is known wherein plural shift units are provided in which each shift unit includes a planetary gear mechanism and a gear ratio control mechanism that controls gear ratio according to the speed of revolution of an input shaft. See, for example, United States Patent No. 5514043; JP-A No. 2001-165250 and JP-A No. 2000-283251.<br><br>
 [0004] In the automatic transmission for a vehicle provided with plural planetary gear mechanisms, as a gear ratio control mechanism of each shift unit is provided with a one-way clutch that blocks the turning in one direction of one element gear configuring the planetary gear mechanism and allows the turning in a reverse direction, the one-way clutch allows the turning at gear ratio except gear ratio when each planet gear is directly driven in an engine brake and the engine brake cannot function.<br><br>
[0005] In addition, an automatic transmission for a vehicle is known that is provided with a neutral clutch for transmitting the rotation of an output shaft to an output deriving shaft and for disconnecting the transmission between the output shaft and the output deriving shaft that transmits the rotation of the output shaft to a wheel. See, for example JP-ANo. H11-270641.<br><br>
SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION <br><br>
[0006] An embodiment of the present invention is directed to an automatic transmission for a vehicle provided with plural shift units each having a planetary gear mechanism to enable the operation of an engine brake at all speeds with a simple structure. According to an embodiment of the present invention, is to facilitate the attachment/detachment of the one-way clutch for realizing the operation of the engine brake.<br><br>
[0007] According to an embodiment of the present invention, an automatic transmission for a vehicle is provided with an input shaft (20) rotated by a prime mover (E); a shift unit (Ml, M2) equipped with each planetary gear mechanism (PI, P2) having three element gears of a sun gear (30, 130), a carrier (40, 140) that supports a planet gear (41, 141) and a ring gear (50, 150) that supports a planet gear (41, 141) and each gear ratio control mechanism (CI, C2) that controls gear ratio (rl, r2) by each planetary gear mechanism (PI, P2); and an output shaft (23) that is rotated at an output speed of revolution (No) acquired by shifting an input speed of revolution (Ni) of the input shaft (20) by the shift units (Ml, M2) and that rotates a driving wheel (98) of the vehicle, and which has a characteristic that each of the gear ratio control mechanism (CI, C2) is provided with a one-way clutch (80, 180) for a shift that blocks the turning in one direction of each specific element gear (30, 150) out of the respective three element gears and a transmission control member (25) that transmits the rotation of the output shaft (23) to the input shaft (20) only when the output speed of revolution (No) exceeds the input speed of revolution (Ni) is provided between the input shaft (20) and the output shaft (23).<br><br><br>
[0008] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the input shaft (20) and the planetary gear mechanisms (PI, P2) are rotatably supported by the output shaft (23) provided outside them in a radial direction with an extended-diameter part open in an axial direction being provided to an end (21a) of the input shaft (20) and the transmission control member (25) is a one-way clutch (25) for transmission arranged inside the extended-diameter part in the radial direction.<br><br>
[0009] According to an embodiment of the present invention, in decelerating the vehicle in which the rotation of the driving wheel rotates the input shaft via the output shaft, the rotation of the output shaft is transmitted to the input shaft via the transmission control member bypassing the planetary gear mechanisms. As a result, an engine brake can also function at a gear ratio except a gear ratio at which the transmission is directly driven and accordingly, the engine brake can fiinction at all gear ratios.<br><br>
[0010] According to an embodiment of the present invention, as the one-way clutch which is the transmission control member is provided to the end of the<br>
input shaft and in addition, is attached to the extended-diameter part open in the axial direction, the detachment of the one-way clutch is facilitated.<br><br>
 [0011] In addition, as a neutral state in which the transmission of power to a wheel is discoimected cannot be acquired because of the structure of the planetary gear mechanism in the automatic transmission for a vehicle provided with the planetary gear mechanism, it is desirable that a neutral clutch for transmitting the power to the wheel and for disconnecting the transmission is provided.<br><br>
[0012] When the transmission is mounted in a plurality of types of vehicles, a further shift to adjust the speed of revolution in inputting rotation acquired in the planetary gear mechanism to the output deriving shaft may be required. <br><br>
[0013] From a viewpoint of miniaturizing the transmission, when the transmission is mounted in a motorcycle as a small-sized vehicle, it is required that the neutral clutch and the output deriving shaft are compactly arranged.<br><br>
 [0014] According to an embodiment of the present invention, a transmission mechanism is compactly arranged on the output side provided with an output deriving shaft and a neutral clutch in an automatic transmission for a vehicle provided with a shift unit equipped with a planetary gear mechanism.<br><br>
 [0015] According to an embodiment of the present invention, an automatic transmission for a vehicle includes an input shaft (20) rotated by a prime mover (E); shift imits (Ml, M2) equipped with planetary gear mechanisms (PI, P2) and gear ratio control mechanisms (CI, C2) that control each gear ratio (rl, r2) by each planetary gear mechanism (PI, P2); an output shaft (23) rotated at an output speed of revolution (No) acquired by shifting an input speed of revolution (Ni) of the input shaft (20) by the shift units (Ml, M2); and a transmission mechanism (90) on the output side equipped with an output deriving shaft (91) rotated by the output shaft (23), and which has a characteristic that the output shaft (23) is provided with an extended shank (27) axially extending from the shift unit (Ml, M2). The transmission mechanism (90) on the output side is provided with a driving rotor (92) provided to the extended shank (27) in a position in which a space (S2) is formed around the extended shank (27) in an axial predetermined range (W) between the transmission mechanism and the shift unit (Ml, M2). A driven rotor (93) is provided to the output deriving shaft (91) and driven by the driving rotor (92) and a neutral clutch (95) that transmits the turning of the driving rotor (92) to the output deriving shaft (91) and disconnects the transmission. The output deriving shaft (91) is arranged in a position overlapped with the shift unit (M2) in an axial view with the neutral clutch (95) being arranged in the predetermined range (W).<br><br>
[0016] According to an embodiment of the present invention, the planetary gear mechanisms (PI, P2) are the primary planetary gear mechanism (PI) provided with three primary element gears of a sun gear (30), a carrier (40) that supports a planet gear (41) and a ring gear (50) and the secondary planetary gear mechanism (P2) provided with three secondary element gears of a sun gear (130), a carrier (140) that supports a planet gear (141) and a ring gear (150); the gear ratio (rl, r2) is primary gear ratio (rl) and secondary gear ratio (r2); the gear ratio control mechanisms (CI, C2) are the primary gear ratio control mechanism (CI) and the secondary gear ratio control mechanism (C2); the shift units (Ml, M2) are configured by the primary shift unit (Ml) provided with the primary planetary gear mechanism (PI) and the primary gear ratio control mechanism (CI) and the secondary shift unit (M2) provided with the secondary planetary gear mechanism (P2) and the secondary gear ratio<br>
control mechanism (C2). The primary gear ratio control mechanism (CI) controls the primary gear ratio (rl) by the primary planetary gear mechanism (PI) to which the rotation of the input shaft (20) is input. The secondary gear ratio control mechanism (C2) controls the secondary gear ratio (r2) by the secondary planetary gear mechanism (P2) to which the turning of a primary output rotor (44b) of the primary shift unit (Ml) is input. The turning of a secondary output rotor (175) of the secondary shift unit (M2) is input to the output shaft (23) with the primary gear ratio control mechanism (CI) being provided with a primary one-way clutch (80) that blocks the turning in one direction of the second primary element gear (30) out of the three primary element gears. The secondary gear ratio control mechanism (C2) is provided with a secondary one-way clutch (180) that blocks the turning in one direction of the second secondary element gear (150) out of the three secondary element gears. The primary one-way clutch (80) and the secondary one-way clutch (180) are provided with a common turning regulating member (T) arranged between a primary engaged part (HI) of the primary planetary gear mechanism (PI) and a secondary engaged part (H2) of the secondary planetary gear mechanism (P2) in an axial direction.<br><br>
[0017] According to an embodiment of the present invention, as the output deriving shaft arranged in the position overlapped with the shift unit in the axial view can be arranged in a position close to the output shaft in a radial direction by utilizing the space formed outside the extended shank in the radial direction and the neutral clutch can be arranged close to the output shaft in the radial direction, the transmission mechanism on the output side provided with the output deriving shaft and the neutral clutch can be compactly arranged close to the output shaft in the radial direction. Thus, the transmission can beminiaturized in the radial direction.<br><br>
[0018] According to an embodiment of the present invention, as the primary and secondary one-way clutches are provided with the common turning regulating member arranged utilizing the space formed between the primary and secondary engaged parts in the axial direction in the primary and secondary shift units provided with the primary and secondary planetary gear mechanisms and the primary and secondary gear ratio control mechanisms, both shift units can be compactly arranged in the axial direction, compared with a transmission where primary and secondary one-way clutches provided with separate turning regulating members are arranged outside each primary and secondary planetary gear mechanism in the axial direction. Accordingly, the neutral clutch arranged in the predetermined range depending upon the length of the extended shank extended from the shift unit can be compactly arranged in the axial direction.<br><br>
[0019] Further, a component of the primary and secondary one-way clutch can be shared and the reduction of the cost by the reduction of the number of parts is enabled.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS <br><br>
[0028] Referring to Figs. 1 to 6, an embodiment of the present invention will be described below.<br><br>
[0029] As shown in Fig. 1, an automatic transmission M to which the present invention is applied configures a power unit mounted in a motorcycle as a vehicle together with an internal combustion engine E as a prime mover.<br><br>
 [0030] In this embodiment, a lateral direction and a longitudinal direction are equivalent to those of the motorcycle in which the power unit is mounted and a vertical direction is a perpendicular direction.<br><br>
[0031] In the description or in the scope of claims, an axial direction shall be a direction parallel to a rotational center line of an input shaft or an output shaft of the transmission, and a radial direction and a circumferential direction shall be those having the rotational center line as the center. When either of the right or the left is equivalent to one direction in the axial direction, the other of the right or the left is equivalent to the other direction of the axial direction. <br><br>
[0032] The gear ratio of the transmission is reduction gear ratio.<br><br>
 [0033] The internal combustion engine E, which is an air-cooled single-cylinder 4-stroke internal combustion engine, is provided with a main unit of the engine configured by a cylinder block 1 having a cylinder la into which a piston 4 is reciprocatably fitted, a cylinder head 2 connected to an upper end of the cylinder block 1 and a crankcase 3 connected to a lower end of the cylinder block 1.<br>
[0034] The cylinder head 2 includes a combustion chamber 7, an intake port (not shown) that conducts the air-fiiel mixture of air for combustion firom an intake system 8 connected to the cylinder head 2 and fiiel from a fuel injection valve 9 to the combustion chamber 7, an exhaust port (not shown) that conducts exhaust gas fi-om the combustion chamber 7 to an exhaust system connected to the cylinder head 2, an ignition plug 10a opposite to the combustion chamber 7, an intake valve and an exhaust valve (both not shown)<br><br>
which are respectively driven by a valve train 11 provided with a camshaft 11a and which respectively open and close the intake port and the exhaust port. [0035] The piston 4 is driven and reciprocated by the pressure of combustion gas generated by the combustion of the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber 7, and rotates a crankshaft 6 via a connecting rod 5. The camshaft 11a is rotated by the power of the crankshaft 6 transmitted via a timing transmission mechanism 12 provided with a chain 12a.<br>
[0036] The rotation (the rotation can be called power or torque in this description) of the crankshaft 6 with which the internal combustion engine E is provided is input to the transmission M. The power derived from an output deriving shaft 91 of the transmission M drives a rear wheel 98 which is a driving wheel as a driven object via a chain 97b configuring a transmission mechanism 97 for driving.<br>
[0037] A throttle valve 8 a with which the intake system 8 is provided controls the quantity of taken air which is a flow rate of air for combustion taken in the combustion chamber 7, the ftiel injection valve 9 which is an air-fiiel mixture producing unit controls the supplied quantity of fuel injected to the air for combustion so as to control the air-fuel ratio of air-ftiel mixture, and an ignition device 10 provided with the ignition plug 10a controls ignition timing. [0038] The throttle valve 8a, the fuel injection valve 9 and the ignition device 10 are respectively an output control device that is controlled by a controller 13 with which the internal combustion engine E is provided and that can control the output of the internal combustion engine E according to operational status of the internal combustion engine E and operational status of the transmission M and in addition, are also respectively a speed of revolution control device that controls the speed of revolution of the crankshaft 6 and the<br><br>
speed of revolution Ni (see Fig. 6) of the input shaft 20 of the transmission M throughout the control over the output of the internal combustion engine E. [0039] The controller 13 is provided with a status detecting unit that detects the operational status of the internal combustion engine E and the operational status of the transmission M and a control unit 13a to which a detection signal from the status detecting unit is input. The status detecting unit includes a clutch engaged state detecting unit 13b that detects that clutches 70, 170 for a shift of the transmission M are half engaged and a time detecting unit 13c that detects the duration of a half engaged state detected by the clutch engaged state detecting unit 13b in addition to an operational status detecting unit that detects the engine speed and a load of the internal combustion engine E. [0040] The clutch engaged state detecting unit 13b detects the half engaged state by comparing set gear ratio set beforehand according to the input speed of revolution Ni of the input shaft 20 of the transmission M and actual gear ratio calculated based upon the actual speed of revolution No detected by a speed of revolution detecting unit of the output shaft 23 of the transmission M and the actual input speed of revolution Ni detected by the speed of revolution detecting unit. For example, as the actual gear ratio is smaller than the set gear ratio when at least one of both clutches 70, 170 is slid, the clutch engaged state detecting unit 13b detects the half engaged state when it is determined that the actual gear ratio is smaller than the set gear ratio. [0041] The control unit 13a controls the operation of at least one of the throttle valve 8a, the fuel injection valve 9 and the ignition device 10 so as to control at least one output controlled variable of the quantity of intake air, the quantity of supplied fuel and ignition timing when the duration detected by the time detecting unit 13c exceeds predetermined time.    The input speed of<br><br>
revolution Ni is varied to be increased or to be decreased by the control and proceeds to a speed of revolution at which the engagement of each clutch 70, 170 is completed.<br>
[0042] The crankcase 3 is configured by a pair of case halves 3a, 3b which are mutually connected by multiple bolts and which can be divided in a direction of vehicle width (that is, in a lateral direction) and a pair of covers 3c, 3d connected to each case half 3a, 3b by multiple bolts. The crankshaft 6 is rotatably supported by the pair of case halves 3a, 3b via a pair of main bearings 14a, 14b.<br>
[0043] The crankcase 3 forms a housing 15 that houses the crankshaft 6 and the transmission M. The housing 15 is partitioned into a crank chamber 15a as a driving chamber in which the crankshaft 6 as a driving shaft is arranged and a transmission chamber 15b in which the transmission M is arranged by a transmission housing 16 as a partition wall provided in the housing 15. In this embodiment, the transmission housing 16 partially partitions the housing<br>
15	in a lower part of the housing 15 so that the crank chamber 15a and the transmission chamber 15b communicate in an upper part of the housing 15 and a bottom wall of the transmission chamber 15b is formed by the pair of case halves 3a, 3b and the cover 3d.    In another example, the transmission housing<br>
16	may also partition the housing 15 so that the crank chamber 15a and the transmission chamber 15b are mutually disposed in independent spaces. [0044] A centrifugal clutch 17 as a starting clutch that transmits the rotation of the crankshaft 6 to the transmission M and disconnects the transmission of the rotation of the crankshaft 6 according to an engine speed which is the speed of revolution of the crankshaft 6 is provided at an end 6a piercing the main bearing 14a and extending to the right of the crankshaft 6.    The centriftigal<br><br>
clutch 17 is provided with a centrifugal weight 17a that controls the engagement of the centrifugal clutch 17 in response to the variation of the engine speed.<br>
[0045] The power unit is provided with a decelerating mechanism 18 as a transmission mechanism on the input side that transmits the rotation of the crankshaft 6 to the input shaft 20 of the transmission M via the centrifugal clutch 17 the engagement of which is completed. The decelerating mechanism 18 is configured by a driving gear 18a to which the rotation of the centrifugal clutch 17 is transmitted and a driven gear 18b turned integrally with the input shaft 20 and inputs the rotation of the crankshaft 6 transmitted via the centriftigal clutch 17 as a clutch on the input side that controls the transmission of the rotation to the input shaft 20 and the disconnection of the transmission to the transmission M.<br>
[0046] As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the transmission M is provided with the input shaft 20 rotated by the crankshaft 6 of the internal combustion engine E via the driven gear 18b, a shift unit U having planetary gear mechanisms PI, P2, the output shaft 23 rotated at an output speed of revolution No to which an input speed of revolution Ni is shifted by the shift unit U, a transmission mechanism 90 on the output side having an output deriving shaft 91 rotated by the output shaft 23 and the transmission housing 16 that houses the input shaft 20, the shift unit U and the output shaft 23.<br>
[0047] The transmission housing 16 and the crankcase 3 are members not included in the following rotary members and the following rotating members, for example, members on the fixed side which are not rotated differently fi-om rotary members such as the planetary gear mechanisms PI, P2 in the shift unit U and rotating members of the transmission M such as the input shaft 20, the<br><br>
output shaft 23 and the output driving shaft 91.<br>
[0048] The input shaft 20 is rotatably supported by the transmission housing 16 and is rotatably supported by the case half 3b via the output shaft 23. The input shaft 20 is arranged in the crank chamber 15a located outside the transmission chamber 15b (or the transmission housing 16) in its axial direction and is provided with a first input shaft 21 with which the driven gear 18b is integrated and a second input shaft 22 the axial movement relevant to the output shaft 23 of which is regulated by a thrust bearing Bl. An inside periphery of the second input shaft 22 is rotatably supported by an outside periphery of the output shaft 23 and an outside periphery of the second input shaft is rotatably supported by the housing 16 via a bearing B2. [0049] The first input shaft 21 coupled to the outside periphery of the second input shaft 22 via a spline and coaxial with the second input shaft 22 is provided with an end 21a forming an opening 21b open to the crank chamber 15a in its axial direction. The end 21b is an extended-diameter part having a larger diameter than the second input shaft 22 of the input shaft 20. [0050] The output shaft 23 is rotatably supported by the case half 3b via a bearing B3 at one end 23b and is rotatably supported by the transmission housing 16 via a bearing B4 and the second input shaft 22 in a part close to the other end 23a. The output shaft 23 arranged coaxially with the input shaft 20 and having a rotational center line L2 coincident with a rotational center line LI of the input shaft 20 extends into the crank chamber 15a, piercing the shift xmit U, the input shaft 20 and the housing 16 in the axial direction. Each rotational center line LI, L2 is parallel to a rotational center line of the crankshaft 6. [0051] The  transmission  M  is  provided  with  a one-way clutch 25   for<br><br>

In another example, the clutch outer 25b is formed by a separate member from the end 21a and may also be provided at the end 21a, and the clutch inner 25a may also be formed by the end 23 a itself.<br>
[0052] The clutch element 25c is fitted to the clutch inner 25a and the clutch outer 25b when the speed of revolution No of the output shaft 23 exceeds an input speed of revolution Ni, transmits the rotation of the output shaft 23 to the input shaft 20, is not fitted to the clutch inner 25a and the clutch outer 25b when the output speed of revolution No is equal to or lower than the input speed of revolution Ni, and the rotation of the input shaft 20 is not transmitted to the output shaft 23 via the one-way clutch 25.<br>
[0053] Therefore, the one-way clutch 25 is turned to the fitted state so that the internal combustion engine E is driven by the power of the rear wheel transmitted via only the output shaft 23 without passing the shift unit U when any of gear ratios Rl to R3 (see Fig. 6) except fourth speed gear ratio R4 which is minimum gear ratio at the time at which the transmission M is in a directly driven state described later in decelerating the motorcycle is set and an engine brake works, and the one-way clutch is turned the unfitted state when<br><br>

[0058] The carrier 40 of the planetary gear mechanism PI is configured by first and second carriers 44, 45 mutually connected by a supporting shaft 43 that tumably supports each planet gear 41. The first carrier 44 is provided with a ringed part 44a which is a ringed wall that supports the supporting shaft 43 and a tubular inner shank 44b which cormects with an inner edge of the ringed part 44a and which is tumably supported by the output shaft 23 via the inner shank 51 and the sun gear 130 of the secondary planetary gear mechanism P2. The second carrier 45 is provided with a ringed part 45a which is a ringed wall that supports the supporting shaft 43 and a tubular outer shank 45b which connects with an outer edge of the ringed part 45a. The carrier 40 is a primary output gear that outputs the rotation shifted by the planetary gear mechanism PI of the input shaft 20 to the planetary gear mechanism P2 and is a third primary element gear out of the three primary element gears in the planetary gear mechanism PI.<br>
[0059] The inner shank 44b of the carrier 40 is a primary output rotor that inputs the rotation of the input shaft 20 to the planetary gear mechanism P2 via the shift unit Ml.

Therefore, the axial movement relevant to the output shaft 23 and the transmission housing 16 of the carrier 40 is blocked by<br><br>
the first regulating member 61.<br>
[0060] The sun gear 30 as a second primary element gear out of the three primary element gears in the planetary gear mechanism PI is provided with a tubular shank 31 on the outside periphery of which a tooth 32 engaged with the tooth 42 of each planet gear 41 is provided and a ringed part 33 that is a ringed wall as a supporting part which extends outward in the radial direction from the shank 31 and to which ratchet pawls 81, 82; 181, 182 described later are provided.

The pressing part 34 presses a thrust bearing 46 provided turnably integrally with the inner shank 44b to the outside periphery of the inner shank 44b in the axial direction via a Hirast bearing B6. Therefore, the movement approaching the planetary gear mechanism P2 (or the leftward movement) of the sun gear 30 for the carrier 40 by leftward first primary axial force Fib generated by the engagement with the planet gear 41 is blocked by the thrust bearing 46.<br>
[0061] These teeth 32, 42, 53 of the planetary gear mechanism PI configure a primary engaged part HI in which the three primary element gears are engaged in the planetary gear mechanism PI, that is, in which each planet gear 41 of the carrier 40 and the ring gear 50 respectively configuring a pair of primary element gears are engaged and in which each planet gear 41 of the carrier 40 and the sun gear 30 respectively configuring another pair of primary element gears are engaged.<br>

coupled to the inner shank 44b of the carrier 40 of the planetary gear mechanism PI via a spline, a tubular outer shank 132 located outside the inner shank 131 in a radial direction and a secondary gear side wall 133 that is a disclike annular wall which extends in the radial direction, which connects with the inner shank 131 at its inner edge and which connects with the outer shank 132 at an outer edge. A tooth 131a engaged with a tooth 142a of each planet gear 141 is provided on the outside periphery of the inner shank 131 tumably supported by the output shaft 23 via a bearing B7. [0063] The inner shank 131 is provided with a pushing part 134 axially extending toward the inner shank 51 of the ring gear 50 of the planetary gear mechanism PI inside the inner shank 44b of the carrier 40 in the radial direction and a stopper 135 that blocks the rightward movement in the axial direction of the sun gear 130, and the inner shank is coupled to the inner shank 44b via the spline in the pushing part 134. The stopper 135 blocks the rightward movement of the sun gear 130 by being touched to the inner shank 44b in the axial direction when the sun gear 130 is moved to the right and the pushing part 134 pushes pressing members 75, 175 described later to the right, and regulates the quantity of the axial movement of the sun gear 130. [0064] The sun gear 130 is a secondary input gear to which the rotational output from the shift unit Ml is input via the inner shank 44b in the planetary gear mechanism P2 and is a first secondary element gear out of three secondary element gears in the planetary gear mechanism P2.<br>
[0065] A supporting shaft 144 that tumably supports each planet gear 141 is provided to the carrier 140 of the planetary gear mechanism P2. The carrier 140 is provided with a ringed part 145 which is a ringed wall that supports the supporting shaft 144 and a tubular outer shank 146 that connects with a<br><br>
peripheral edge of the ringed part 145. The carrier 140 is a secondary output gear that outputs the rotation of the inner shank 44b shifted by the planetary gear mechanism P2 to the output shaft 23 and is a third secondary element gear out of the three secondary element gears in the planetary gear mechanism P2. [0066] The outer shank 146 shifts the rotation of the inner shank 44b and outputs it to the output shaft 23, and is a final output shaft in all the planetary gear mechanisms PI, P2 with which the transmission M is provided. The outer shank 146 is provided with a fixed wall 146c as a joint integrally tumably coupled to a clutch outer 172 via a spline at one end close to the planetary gear mechanism P2 in the axial direction and is provided with a supported part 146d to which a pair of thrust bearings B8 arranged with a second regulating member 62 between the pair of thrust bearings in the axial direction are provided at the other end. Therefore, the axial movement relevant to the output shaft 23 and the transmission housing 16 of the carrier 140 is blocked by the second regulating member 62.<br>
[0067] The ring gear 150 as a second secondary element gear out of the three secondary element gears in the planetary gear mechanism P2 is provided with a tubular outer shank 151 inside which a tooth 151a engaged with a tooth 143a of each planet gear 141 is provided, a ringed part 152 that is a ringed wall as a supporting part which extends inside in a radial direction from the outer shank 151 and to which the ratchet pawls 81, 82, 181, 182 are provided and a secondary pressing part 153 which is an inner shank tumably supported by the outside periphery of the inner shank 44b. The pressing part 153 located close to the planetary gear mechanism PI in the axial direction, compared with the ringed part 152 presses the thrust bearing 46 via a thrust bearing B9 in a reverse direction to a direction pressed by the pressing part 34 in the axial<br><br>
direction. Therefore, the movement approaching the planetary gear mechanism PI (or the rightward movement) apart from the carrier 140 of the ring gear 150 by rightward first secondary axial force F2b generated by the engagement with the planet gear 141 is blocked by the thrust bearing 46. [0068] Each planet gear 141 is configured by a first gear 142 provided with the first tooth 142a engaged with the tooth 131a of the sun gear 130 and a second gear 143 having a larger diameter than a diameter of the first gear 142 and provided with the second tooth 143a engaged with the tooth 151a of the ring gear 150. As the secondary gear ratio r2 is larger than the primary gear ratio rl which is the gear ratio by the planetary gear mechanism PI can be acquired by the planetary gear mechanism P2 provided with the ring gear 150 having the substantially same outside diameter as the outside diameter of the ring gear 50 of the planetary gear mechanism PI owing to the planet gear 141, the structure of the planet gear 141 contributes to the downsizing in the radial direction of the transmission M.<br>
[0069] The inclination (with the axial direction) of the first and second teeth 142a, 143a and accordingly, also the inclination of each tooth 131a, 151a are set to be larger than the inclination (with the axial direction) of the tooth 42 of each planet gear 41 of the planetary gear mechanism PI, accordingly the inclination of each tooth 32, 53.<br>
[0070] Therefore, when similar torque is applied to the planet gear 41 and the planet gear 141, each secondary axial force F2a, F2b generated between the sun gear 130 and the ring gear 150 respectively engaged with the secondary planet gear 141 is larger than each primary axial force Fla, Fib generated between the ring gear 50 and the sun gear 30 respectively engaged with the primary planet gear 41.<br><br>
[0071] For another example, the inclination of all the teeth 32, 42, 53, 131a, 142a, 143a. 151a in both planetary gear mechanisms PI, P2 may also be set to be equal.<br>
[0072] The teeth 131a, 142a, 143 a, 151a of the planetary gear mechanism P2 configure secondary engaged parts H2 where the three secondary element gears in the planetary gear mechanism P2 are engaged, that is, where each planet gear 141 of the carrier 140 and the ring gear 150 which respectively configure a pair of secondary element gears are engaged and each planet gear 141 of the carrier 140 and the sun gear 130 which respectively configure another pair of secondary element gears are engaged.<br>

[0097] The centrifugal weight 176 of the secondary clutch 170 has structure that generates the secondary pressure F2c larger than the primary pressure Flc generated by the centrifugal weight 76 of the primary clutch 70 when the clutch outers 72, 172 are turned at the same speed of revolution. As for the structure of the weight, in this embodiment, the mass of the centrifugal weight 176 is set to be larger than the mass of the centrifugal weight 76. More specifically, the mass of both centrifugal weits 76, 176 is set so that the secondary pressure F2c is larger than the primary pressure Flc, the pressing member 175 move to the right and moves the pressing member 75 that turns the clutch 70 in the engagement completed state to the right and the engagement completed state of the clutch 70 can be released when the input speed of revolution Ni is turned second predetermined speed N2 (see Fig. 6)<br><br>
described later as a first specific speed of revolution.<br>
[0098] For another example, the structure of the weight may also be a structure in which the distance between the fiilcrum part 176a and the pushing part 176d in the centrifugal weight 176 is set to be shorter than the distance between the fulcrum part 76a and the pushing part 76d in the centrifugal weight 76 and fiuther, these structures may also be used together. [0099] Each clutdi 70, 170 is in the disengaged state in which the rotation is not transmitted via the pair of clutch plates 73, 74 and the pair of clutch plates 173, 174 when each centrifugal weight 76, 176 is located in the halted position, each clutch is in the engagement completed state in which each clutch inner 71, 171 and each clutch outer 72, 172 (accordingly, the ring gear 50 and the carrier 40 and/or the sun gear 130 and tiie carrier 140) are turned at equal speed without sliding between the clutch plates 73, 74; 173, 174 when each centrifugal wght 76, 176 is IcKated in the maximum extended position, and each clutch is in a half engaged state (or in a state of partial clutch engagement) in which the turning of each clutch inner 71, 171 (accordingly, the ring gear 50 or tfie sun gear 130) is transmitted to each clutch outer 72, 172 (accordingly, each carrier 40, 140) in a condition that the clutch plates 73, 74; 173, 174 are slid when each extended centrifugal weight 76, 176 is located in an intermediate position which is located between the halted position and the maximum extended position and in which the mutually touched clutch plates 73,74; 173, 174aresHd-<br><br>
[00100] The transmission M is provided with a clutch disengaging mechanism D as a gear ratio shift mechanism that shifts the gear ratio rl of the shift unit Ml arranged on the side of the input shaft 20 in the transmission path out of the plural shift units Ml, M2 with which the transmission M is provided.    The clutch disengaging mechanism D is a mechanism that releases the engagement completed state of the clutch 70 and turns the clutch in the disengaged state and is provided with the pushing part 134 as a driving part and an intermediate transmitting member 36 that transmits the driving force of the pushing part 134 to the pressing member 75 of the clutch 70 as disengaging force for disengaging the clutch 70.<br><br>
[00101] The intermediate transmitting member 36 is provided with a tubular first intermediate transmitting member 37 which can be axially touched to the pushing part 134 and a tubular second intermediate transmitting member 38 which can be axially touched to the first intermediate transmitting member 37. The first and second intermediate transmitting members 37, 38 are turnably and axially movably supported by the output shaft 23.<br><br>
[00102]TTie second intermediate transmitting member 38 is provided with an extensible part 39 having a spring 39a which is an elastic member as a pushing member for control between axial both ends. The spring 39a which is the elastic member is configured by one or a plurality, for example, four coned disc springs 39b in this embodiment. The first intermediate transmitting member 37 is touchwl to one end configured by the extensible part 39 of the second intermediate transmitting member 38 and the iimer shank 51 of the ring gear 50 is touched to the otiier «id configured by a thrust bearing B13 of the second intermediate transmitting member 38.<br><br>
[00103]When both clutches 70, 170 are in the disengaged state, an axial interval for turning bofli intermediate transmitting members 37, 38 in a touched state when the clutch 70 is turned in the engagement completed state is formed between both intermediate transmitting members 37, 38. <br><br>
[00104]When the first intermediate transmitting member 37 pushed by the<br>
pushing part 134 is touched to the second intermediate transmitting member 38 and the leftward movement of the second intermediate transmitting member 38 is blocked, the spring 39a pushes the pressing member 75 via the ring gear 50 so that the centrifugal weight 76 is located in the halted state against the pressure Flc by the force of the ring so as to locate the pressing member 75 in the pressure released position.<br><br>
[00105] When the primary clutch 70 is in the engagement completed state, the sun gear 130 is moved to the right according to the rightward movement of the pressing member 175 in a process in which the centrifiigal weight 176 extends by the increase of the speed of revolution of the carrier 140 of the planetary gear mechanism P2 and the secondary clutch 170 is turned in the engagement completed state from the disengaged state, the pushing part 134 pushes the first and second intermediate transmitting members 37, 38, and the second intermediate transmitting membCT 38 is touched to the iimer shank 51. At this time, as the pressure F2c applied to the pressing member 175 by the centrifugal weight 176 is larger than the pressure Flc applied to the pressing member 75 of the centrifugal weight 76, the carrio- 40 and the pressing member 75 are pushed by the driving force by the pushing part 134 via the first and second intermediate transmitting members 37, 38 and are moved to the right. The clutch 70 is turned in the disengaged state via the state of partial clutch engagement by the axial movemoit of the pressing member 75.<br><br>
 [00106] To release the engagement completed state of the primary clutch 70, the pressure F2c has only to be larger than the pressure Flc. In the meantime, when an input speed of revolution Ni increases and the clutch 70 is turned in the engagement completed state again exceeding a third predetermined speed N3 (see Fig. 6) as a second specific speed of revolution after the clutch 70 is<br>
pushed by the pushing part 134 and is once turned in the disengaged state, the pressure Flc moves to the left the pressing member 75 because the extensible part 39 is axially reduced against the force of the spring 39a and the clutch 70 is turned in the engagement completed state. Accordingly, the force of the spring 39a is a force for control that prescribes an input speed of revolution Ni at which the centrifugal weight 76 is again extended.<br><br>
[00107] Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, the one-way clutches 80, 180 will be described below. As both one-way clutches 80, 180 basically have the same structure, reference numerals of members related to the one-way clutch 80 are also shown in Fig. 4.<br><br>
[00108] Each of the one-way clutchs 80 that blocks the turning in one direction Al of the sun gear 30 of the planetary gear mechanism PI and the secondary one-way clutch 180 that blocks the turning in one direction Al of the carrier 140 is provided with one or more fitting parts on the rotary side swingably supported by a supporting shaft 89; 189 provided to the ringed part 33; 152, in this embodiment, two pairs of ratchet pawls 81, 82 or two pairs of ratchet pawls 181, 182, an outer member T as a revolution regulating member to which plural pawls 83; 183 as a fitted part on the revolution regulating side that blocks the turning in one direction Al of the sun gear 30 or the ring gear 150 by fitting each ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 in one direction Al are provided and a spring 84, 184 as a pushing member that pushes each ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 in a direction in which each ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 is fitted to each pawl 83; 183. The spring 84; 184 is held by the ringed part 33; 152 and the ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 after the spring is respectively inserted into fitting holes Kl, K2 provided to the ringed part 33; 152 and the ratchet pawl 81, 82: 182, 182.<br><br>
[00109] The outer member T that covers each ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 from the outside in a radial direction is a single tubular member common to both one-way clutches 80, 180 and forms circular space SI between the outer member and the inner shank 44b in the radial direction. The outer member T is supported by the transmission housing 16 via the supporting member 65 integrated with the outer member T and extends outside in the radial direction from the outside paifthery of the onto- member T. The supporting member 65 is fixed to the fitting 16a (see Fig. 1) of the transmission housing 16 by a bolt. <br><br>
[00110]Each ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 is provided with a fitting part 81a, 82a; 181a, 182a fitted to each pawl 83; 183 and a weight part 81b, 82b; 181b, 182b. The ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 can be swung by centrifugal force that acts upon the weight part 81b, 82b; 181b, 182b until the fitting part 81a, 82a; 181a, 182a is located in an untouched position (shown by an alternate long and two short daes line in Fig. 4) which is a position where the fitting part is not fitted to a fitting part 85a; 185a of the pawl 83; 183 against a pushing force of the spring 84; 184. The untouched position is prescribed by a stopper 87; 187 provided to each ringed part 33; 152. When the ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 is located in the untouched position, the whole outside face 81c, 82c; 181c, 182c opposite to the pawl 83; 183 or the outer member T outward in the radial direction of each ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 is located on one concentric imaginary circle 88 with the rotational center lines LI, L2 and inside the imaginary circle 88 in the radial direction in an axial view.<br><br>
[00111]The pawl 83; 183 protruding close to the ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 in the radial direction is provided with a body 85; 185 having each fitting part 85a; 185a and an inclined part 86; 186 radially gradually protruding in a reverse direction A2 which is a turning direction that allows the turning of the<br><br>
sun gear 30 or the ring gear 130. When the ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 is not touched to the fitting part 85a; 185a, the ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182 is pushed by the spring 84; 184 and is touched to the inclined part 86; 186. As the inclined part 86; 186 is made of rubber as elastic material provided by baking it on the fitting part 85a; 185a, the inclined part functions as a buffering part for buffering shock and the reduces noise caused by the touch of the inclined part and the ratchet pawl 81, 82; 181, 182.<br><br>
[00112] A pair of ratchet pawls 81 and a pair of ratchet pawls 181 are respectively arranged symmetrically with the rotational center lines LI, L2 in the center, another pair of ratchet pawls 82 and another pair of ratchet pawls 182 are respectively arranged symmetrically with the rotational center lines LI, L2 in the craiter, and when each pair of ratchet pawls 81, 82; 181, 182 are located in a fitted position in which each pair of ratchet pawls are fitted to each fitting part 85a; 185a, anotfaer pair of ratchet pawls are arranged in an unfitted position in which another pair of ratchet pawls are not fitted to each fitting part 85a; 185a. Thus, a chance of the fitting to the fitting part 85a; 185a when all ratchet pawls 81, 82; 181, 182 are turned in one direction Al for the outer member T fi-om the unfitted position can be increased and the ratchet pawls can be promptly be turned in a turning blocked state.<br><br>
[00113] As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the whole primary engaged part HI and the whole secondary engaged parts H2 are housed in one gear chamber 19 formed by the pressing member 75 as a first side wall and the pressing member 175 as a second side wall respectively mutually apart in the axial direction, the clutch outers 72, 172 respectively axially extend between both pressing members 75, 175, both outer shanks 45b, 146 as a gear peripheral wall and a tubular peripheral wall formed by the outer member T as an outer peripheral wall.<br><br>
The gear chamber 19 is in a space formed in the transmission housing 16.<br><br>
 [00114] The pressing member 75 configures double walls in a radial range in which the whole of both engaged parts HI, H2 or the substantial whole when they are viewed from the axial direction is included in collaboration with the gear side wall 54 located between the pressing member 75 and the engaged part HI in the axial direction, and the pressing member 175 configures double walls in a radial range in which the whole of both engaged parts HI, H2 or the substantial whole when they are viewed from the axial direction is included in collaboration with the gear side wall 133 located between the pressing member 175 and the engaged part H2 in the axial direction.<br><br>
[00115] The first and second regulating members 61, 62 are arranged between both outer shanks 45h, 146 that cover the outer member T from the outside in the radial direction close to the supported parts 45d, 146d which are the ends mutually opposite in the axial direction of both outer shanks 45b, 146. As the first and second regulating members 61, 62 and the supporting member 65 cover both outer shanks 45b, 146 and the outer member T from the outside in the radial direction including a boundary betwe«i both outer shanks 45b, 146 and the outer member T over both outer shanks 45b, 146 and the outer member T in the axial direction, the noise caused by the sound of engagement in both engaged parts HI, H2 can be greatly reduced.<br><br>
[00116] As the clutch outer 72 and the outer shank 45b, the clutch outer 172 and the outer shank 146 and each outer shank 45b, 146 and the outer member T include an overlapped part mutually overlapped in the axial direction, the width of the peripheral wall in the axial direction can be reduced, enhancing the effect of reducing noise caused by engagement in both engaged parts HI, H2 by partially forming the double walls as the peripheral wall which is a wall<br>
 in the radial direcrion of the gear chamber 19, and both shift units Ml, M2 can be made to be compact in the axial direction.<br><br>
[00117] As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the output shaft 23 provided with an extended shank 27 extends to the left in the axial direction from the shift unit M2 rotates the output deriving shaft 91 with which the transmission mechanism 90 on the output side is provided. The transmission mechanism 90 is provided with an output gear 92 as a driving rotor provided to the extended shank 27 in a position in which sjrace S2 encircling the periphery 27a of the extended shank is formed around the extended shank 27 in a predetermined range W in the axial direction between the transmission mechanism and the shift unit M2 and around the extended shank 27, a driven gear 93 as a driven rotor tumably provided to the output deriving shaft 91 and driven by the engagement with the output gear 92 and a neutral clutch 95 that transmits the turning of the output gear 92 to the output deriving shaft 91 and disconnects the transmission in addition to the output deriving shaft 91. [00118] The whole output deriving shaft 91 is arranged in a position overlapped with the shift unit M2 in the axial direction. The output deriving shaft 91 having a rotational center line parallel to the rotational center lines LI, L2 is provided with an inside extended shank 93a axially extending in the predetermined range W opposite to the driven gear 93 and an outside extended shank 93b piercing the case half 3b and extaiding outside the crank chamber 15a. A driving sprocket 97a as a final output pari: onto which the chain 97b is wound is provided to the outside extended shank 93b.<br><br>
[00119] An end of the inside extended shank 93a is supported by a bearing 16b provided to the transmission housing 16 which is a separate member from the crankcase 3 via a bearing B14.    The output deriving shaft 91 is rotatably supported by the case half 3b ia a bearing B15 between the driving sprocket 97a and the driven gear 93.<br><br>
[00120] The output gear 92 and the driven gear 93 configure a decelerating mechanism that prescribes a gear ratio on the output side for decelerating the speed of revolution No of the output shaft 23 and further shifting the output speed of revolution No. The transmission mechanism 90 on the output side that transmits the rotation of the output shaft 23 to the driving sprocket 97a and the decelerating mechanism 18 which is a transmission mechanism on the input side are arranged on both sides of both shift units Ml, M2 in the axial direction.<br><br>
 [00121]The neutral clutch 95 is arranged on the extended shank 93a and is arranged in the predetermined range W. The neutral clutch 95 is provided with a shifter 95a which is turned integrally with the output deriving shaft 91 via a spline and which can be fitted to the driven gear 93 and a shift fork 95b that is operatwl by a chitch operating member (not shown) and movably drives the shifter 95a in the axial direction.<br><br>
[00122]The shifter 95a is axially movable on the extended shank 93a for inputting the rotation transmitted from the output gear 92 via the driven gear 93 to the output deriving shaft 91 when the shifter is located in a driving position shown by a full line in Fig. 2 and is turned at a speed of revolution acquired by adjusting the speed of revolution No of the output shaft 23 at the speed ratio set by the transmission mechanism 90 of the output deriving shaft 91. The shifter 95a disconnects Ae transmission of the rotation of the output shaft 23 to the output deriving shaft 91 when the shifter is located in a neutral position shown by an alternate long and two short dashes line in Fig. 2. <br><br>
[00123] Reforming to Figs. 1, 5(a) to 5(d) and 6, the operation of the transmission M will be described below.<br><br>
[00124] As mainly flown in Fig. 5(a), when the internal combustion engine E is started, the engine speed which is the speed of revolution of the crankshaft 6 exceeds idle speed and the centrifugal clutch 17 is engaged, the input shaft 20 and the ring gear 50 are rotated at an input speed of revolution Ni transmitted via the decelerating mechanism 18. At this time, when the input speed of revolution Ni is equal to or lower than the first predetermined speed Nl, the turning in one direction Al (see Fig. 4) of the sum gear 30 of the planetary gear mechanism PI is blocked by the one-way clutch 80 in the shift unit Ml and the sun gear is halted. Therefore, as in the planetary gear mechanism PI, the carrier 40 is turned at a speed of revolution acquired by decelerating the input speed of revolution Ni at the gear ratio rl by the planetary gear mechanism PI, the ring gear 50 moved to the right pushes by the pressing member 75 by the axial force Fla by the engagement of the planet gear 41 and the ring gear 50 in the clutch 70 and the pressing memlr 75 is located in the pressure released position, the clutch plates 73, 74 are separated, the centrifugal weight 76 is located in the halted position, and the clutch 70 is disengaged. [00125] In addition, in the shift unit M2, the turning in one direction Al (see Fig. 4) of the ring gear 150 of the planetary gear mechanism P2 is blocked by the one-way clutch 180 and the ring gear is halted. Therefore, as in the planetary gear mechanism P2, the carrier 140 is tamed at a speed of revolution acquired by decelerating the speed of revolution of the sun gear 130 tamed at an equal speed to the carrier 40 of the planetary gear mechanism PI at the gear ratio r2 by the planetary gear mechanism P2, the sun gear 130 moved to the left pushes the pressing member 175 by the axial force Fla by the engagement of the planet gear 141 and the sun gear 130 in the clutch 170 and the pressing member 175 is located in the pressure released position, the clutch plates 173,<br>
 174 are separated, the centrifiigal weight 176 is located in the halted position, and the clutch 170 is disengaged.<br><br>
[00126] In this state, the transmission M attains the first speed gear ratio Rl acquired by multiplying both gear ratios rl, r2 and the output shaft 23 is rotated at a speed of revolution acquired by shifting the input speed of revolution Ni at the first speed gear ratio Rl which is maximum gear ratio of the transmission M. Wbea the neutral clutch 95 (see Fig. 2) is located in the driving position, the rotation of the output shaft 23 is input to the output deriving shaft 91 via the output gear 92 and the driven gear 93.<br><br>
 [00127] As mainly shown in Fig. 5(b), when the input speed of revolution Ni exceeds the first predetermined speed NI and is equal to or lower than the second predetermined speed N2 higher than the first predetermined speed NI, the pressure Flc based upon centrifugal force applied to the centrifugal weight 76 sorpaes the axial force Fla by Ae increase of the speed of revolution of the carrier 40 in the clutch 70 and the centrifugal weight 76 extends in the shift unit Ml. The centrifugal weight 76 is located in the maximum extended position, the pressing member 75 moves the ring gear 50 to the left, the pressing member pushes the clutch plates 73, 74 to be touched to each other, and the clutch 70 is turned in the «igagement completed state. Therefore, the ring gear 50, the carrier 40 and the sun gear 30 are turned at the input speed of revolution Ni in the direction A2 (see Fig. 4) reverse to one direction Al and the gear ratio rl is turned '1', that is, the gears are turned in the directly driven state.<br><br>
[00128] In the meantime, in the shift unit M2, as the pressure F2c based upon centrifugal force applied to the centrifugal weight 176 is equal to or smaller than the axial force F2a though the speed of revolution of the carrier 140<br>
increases, the centrifbgai weight I "6 is located in the halted position. Therefore, the planetarv' gear mechanism P2 and the clutch 170 are in the similar state to the state when tiie first speed gear ratio Rl is set.<br><br>
 [00129] In this state, the transmission M attains the second speed gear ratio R2.<br><br>
 [00130] As mainly shown in Fig. 5(c), when the input speed of revolution Ni exceeds the second predetermined speed N2 and is equal to or lower than the third predetermined speed N3 highw than the second predetermined speed N2, the pressure F2c based upon centrifiigal force ajlied to the centrifugal weight 176 surpasses the axial force F2a by the increase of the speed of revolution of the carrier 140 in the secondary clutch 170 and the centrifugal weight 176 extends in the secondary shift unit M2. The centriftigal weight 176 is located in the maximum extraided position, the pressing member 175 moves the sun gear 130 to the right, the pressing member pushes the clutch plates 173, 174 to be touched to each o&amp;er, and the secondary clutch 170 is turned in the engagement completed state. Therefore, the ring gear 150, the carrier 140 and the sun gear 130 are turned at the primary output speed of revolution Na which is the speed of revoluticm of the carrio" 40 in the direction A2 (see Fig. 4) reverse to one direction Al and the gear ratio r2 is turned T, that is, the gears are turned in the directly driven state.<br><br>
[00131] In transition from Ae second speed gear ratio R2 as a gear ratio on the low speed side to the tiiird speed gear ratio R3 as gear ratio on the high speed side higher than the second speed gear ratio R2, the sun gear 130 is moved to the right integrally with the pressing member 175 which is moved to the right in a process in which the clutch 170 is turned in the engagement completed state from the disengaged state via the half engaged state, the pushing part 134 moves to the right the first and second intermediate members 37, 38, and<br>
further, moves the pressing member "5 of the clutch 70 \ia the ring gear 50 to the right, that is, in a direction in which the engagement completed state of the clutch 70 is released.<br><br>
[00132] Therefore, in the clutch 70, the centrifugal weight 76 is moved from the maximum extended position to the halted position, the clutch 70 is turned in the disengaged state from the engagemrait completed state via the half engaged state, and the clutdi outer 72 and the carrier 40, respectively turned at the input speed of revolution Ni, are turned at a speed of revolution acquired by decelerating the input speed of revolution Ni at the gear ratio rl. The rightward movement of the pressing member 175 and the sun gear 130 is blocked by touching the stopper 135 that regulates the quantity of the movement of the pressing member 175 and the sun gear 130 to a left end of the iimer shank 44b of the carrier 40.<br><br>
[00133] In this state, the transmission M attains the third speed gear ratio R3 equal to the gear ratio rl by the shift unit Ml.<br><br>
[00134] As the controller 13 varies the input speed of revolution Ni so as to increase the input speed of revolution Ni to be an input speed of revolution Ni at which the clufch 170 in the half engaged state is turned in the engagement completed state or the clutch 70 in Hie half engaged state is turned in the disengaged state by controlling at least one output controlled variable of the quantity of intake air, the quantity of supplied fuel and ignition timing by at least one of the throttle valve 8a, the fuel injection valve 9 and the ignition device 10 which are respectively speed of revolution control devices when the time detecting unit 13c detects that at least one of both clutches 70, 170 is turned in the half engaged state by the clutch engaged state detecting unit 13b and time in which the half engaged state continues to expeed a predetermined<br>
time in transition from tie second speed gear ratio R2 to the third speed gear ratio R3, the half engaged state of the clutch 70 or the clutch 170 is promptly shifted and transition from the second speed gear ratio R2 to the third speed gear ratio R3 is advanced.<br><br>
[00135] Conversely, in transition from the third speed gear ratio R3 to the second speed gear ratio R2, the speed of revolution control device controlled by the controller 13 varies the input speed of revolution Ni so as to decrease the input speed of revolution Ni to be input speed of revolution Ni at which the clutch 70 in the half engaged state is turned in the engagement completed state or the clutch 170 in the half engaged state is turned in the disengaged state.<br><br>
 [00136] Similarly, in transition from the first speed gear ratio Rl to the second speed gear ratio R2 and in transition fiiom the fliird speed gear ratio R3 to the fourth speed gear ratio R4, when the time detecting unit 13c detects that the duration detected by tiie clutch engaged state detecting unit 13b of the half engaged state of the clutch 70 exceeds a predetermined time, the controller 13 varies the input speed of revolution Ni so as to increase the input speed of revolution Ni to be an input speed of revolution Ni at which the clutch 70 is turned in the engagemit completed state by controlling the speed of revolution control device. In transition from the second speed gear ratio R2 to the first speed gear ratio Rl and in transition fism the fourth speed gear ratio R4 to the third q)eed gear ratio R3, when the time detecting unit 13c detects that the duration detected by the clutch engaged state detecting unit 13b of the half engaged state of the clutch 70 exceeds a predetermined time, the controller 13 makes the speed of revolution control device vary the input speed of revolution Ni so as to decrease the input speed of revolution Ni to be an input speed of revolution Ni at which the clutch 70 is turned in the disengaged<br><br>
state by controlling the speed of revolution control device.<br>
[0013 7] As mainly shown in Fig. 5(d). when the input speed of revolution Ni<br>
exceeds the third predetermined speed N3- the planetary gear mechanism P2<br>
and the clutch 170 are in a similar state to the state when the third speed gear<br>
