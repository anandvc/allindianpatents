COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10; Rule 13]<br>
A SEALING TAPE FOR SEALING AN ARTICLE;<br>
SEAL KING INDUSTRIAL CO. LTD., A COMPANY ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF TAIWAN, REPUBLIC OF CHINA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 14F-2, 888, JING-GUO ROAD, TAOYUAN 330, TAIWAN, REPUBLIC OF CHINA.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br>
16-08-2005<br><br>
TITLE<br>
SEALING TAPE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a sealing tape, and more specifically, to a sealing tape which can be adhered to an open end of an article and used to seal up the article in a repetitive peeling open/sealing close manner.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A sealing tape has been known to use for sealing up an open end of a package such as a plastic bag with a repetitive peeling open/sealing close manner, so as to prevent articles enclosed in the package from dropping out through the open end of the package. Both FIG.1 and FIG. 2 illustrate a common sealing tape<br>
Referring to FIG.1, a sealing tape 100 has a first adhesive layer 104 coated on an edge of a peel-off layer 102, a second adhesive layer 106 coated on surface of the first adhesive layer 104 on the side distant from the peel-off layer 102 wherein the second adhesive layer 106 is tighter than the first adhesive layer 104, and a release agent layer 108 coated on surface of the<br>
2<br><br>
other side of the peel-off layer 102. Thus, the sealing tape is tightly adhered via the second adhesive layer 106 to a plasjjcjriade bag 112 such that the peel-off layer 102 still adheres to the second adhesive layer 106 while the peel-off layer 102 is separated from the first adhesive layer 104.<br>
After each of the layers is coated, the sealing tape 100 is wrapped on a discoid unit illustrated in FIG.2.<br>
However, the sealing tape having two adhesive layers is inherent with significant drawbacks as it increases both fabrication complexity and fabrication costs. The sealing tape fabricated accordingly is also thicker and occupies more space. Further, the thicker sealing tape poses a certain limitation on the length of the sealing tape wrapped on a discoid unit. Since the sealing tape with a limited length is used up rapidly, a user has to frequently replace new products, so more time is spent on loading the sealing tape product onto an article such as a bag, envelope, or the like.<br>
In addition, the release agent layer 108 is partially coated on the surface of the other side of the peel-off layer 102 for peeling off the peel-off layer 102 with ease. As a result, the surface of the sealing tape 100 becomes uneven, making a thorough wrapping of the sealing tape on the discoid unit<br>
3<br><br>
difficult.<br>
Therefore, a "spool type" method has been proposed to repetitively cross-wrap the sealing tape in resolving the foregoing problem of unevenness. However, in the products fabricated using such "spool type" method, the adherent material of the adhesive layer that is not completely cured may leak from gaps between overlapping layers of the sealing tape. In other words, the adhesive layer may adhere to the gaps between overlapping layers of the sealing tape, so that the adherent material remains on the two sides of the peel-off layer, leaving a line of adherent material on the top surface of the sealing tape and creating adhesive-smearing hassles.<br>
Furthermore, a leakage-proof layer has also been provided to isolate the adhesive layer from directly contacting the peel-off layer, so that the sealing tape is wrapped up using the "spool type" method to eliminate the foregoing drawbacks such as unevenness, leakage of adherent material, unwanted lines of adherent material and an adhesive smearing hassle. However, as the leakage-proof layer is added, the fabrication process is altered and becomes more complex, while more production cost and fabrication time are spent.   Also, the sealing tape with a leakage-proof layer will be thicker,<br>
4<br><br>
leading to an increase in the volume and thickness of the fabricated product. Thus, the sealing tape produced as such occupies more space and consumes more time for loading the product onto the article such as a bag, envelope, or the like.<br>
Overaff, the seaffng tape known in the prior art is inherent with significant drawbacks such as unevenness, leakage of adherent material, undesired lines of adherent material and an adhesive smearing hassle, creating further problems such as complex fabrication process, an increase in the fabrication cost, fabrication time, the thickness and volume of the product, and time for loading the product onto the article such as a bag, envelop, or the like. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a sealing tape that eliminates the foregoing drawbacks of the sealing tape known in the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a sealing tape which can be repetitively cross-wrajpped, as a spool type product to prevent the adherent material from adherent to gaps formed between overlapping layers of the sealing tape.<br>
5<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a sealing tape to simplify the fabrication process, lower the fabrication cost, shorten the time required for fabrication, decrease the thickness and volume of products and minimize the space to be occupied by the product.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is to provide a sealing tape to reduce the time required for loading the sealing tape products onto the article such as a bag, envelope, or the like, so as to improve convenience for the user.<br>
In accordance with the above and other objectives, the present invention proposes a sealing tape having a peel-off layer, a first anti-adhesive layer<br><br>
and an adhesive layer.<br>
The peel-off layer has a first surface and a second surface, and the peel-off layer may be a structure with its second surface subjected to an anti-adhesion treatment to generate an appropriate anti-adhesion. The first anti-adhesive layer is formed on the first surface of the peel-off layer to completely cover the first surface. The adhesive layer is partially formed on the second surface of the peel-off layer. In other embodiment, the sealing tape can be selectively formed with a second anti-adhesive layer<br>
6<br><br>
eliminating drawbacks of the prior art. The sealing tape of the invention simplifies the fabrication process, lowers the fabrication cost, shortens the time for fabrication, decreases the volume and thickness of the product, reduces the space to be occupied by the product and shortens the time required for loading the sealing tape product onto an article such as a package.<br>
Therefore, the sealing tape proposed by the present invention can be adhered to an open end of an article for sealing up the article in a repetitive peeling open/ sealing close manner. A spool type product formed using such sealing tape can prevent the adherent material from adhering to the gaps between overlapping layers of the sealing tape, so as to eliminate the drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
The present invention is described in the following with specific embodiments, so that one skilled in the pertinent art can easily understand other advantages and effects of the present invention from the disclosure of the invention. The present invention is also implemented and applied according to other embodiments, and details are modified based on different views and applications without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following embodiment only serves to provide further description for the present invention with no intent to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
FIRST EMBODIMENT<br>
FIGs 3 to 6 are illustrated according to the first embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the diagrams, a sealing tape 1 is used for sealing an article 2, wherein the sealing tape 1 comprises a peel-off layer 11, a first anti-adhesive layer 13 and an adhesive layer 15. It should be noted that these figures are all simplified schematic diagrams and only illustrate the basic structure of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention is provided with a construction that is not drawn to actual shape and scale in practical implementation. The recognition mark, shape and size scale in the practical implementation belong to an optional design, while the construction resulted as such may be more complex.<br>
Referring to FIG.3, the peel-off layer 11 has a first surface 11a and a second surface 11b, wherein the first surface 11a is distant from the article 2 in a sealed state, and the second surface 11b is close to the article 2. The peel-off   layer   11    may   be   made   of   Polyethylene   (PE),   Oriented<br>
10<br><br>
Polypropylene (OPP) or other plastic materials. Preferably, the peel-off layer made of polyethylene to reduce the fabrication cost and thickness of the product since polyethylene is thinner, inexpensive, and has a highest yield. Other materials may certainly be used depending on the actual needs.<br>
The second surface 11b may be subjected to the anti-adhesion treatment, coarsening treatment or other equivalent treatments, so as to generate an appropriated adhesion for the second surface 11b. While the theories and methods involved in the anti-adhesion treatment, coarsening treatment or other equivalent treatments are well known in the prior art, the detail thereof is omitted herein.<br>
The first anti-adhesive layer 13 is formed on the first surface 11a to completely cover the first surface 11a. The first anti-adhesive layer 13 may be a release agent layer that makes the adhesive layer 15 non-adhesive to the first surface 11a of the peel-off layer 11, when the sealing tape 1 is cross-wrapped on a discoid product.<br>
The adhesive layer 15 is partially formed on the second surface 11b. In the present embodiment, the adhesive layer 15 is formed on the middle<br>
11<br><br>
portion but not on the two sides of the second surface 11b. It is noted that the adhesive layer 15 may be formed partially on other appropriate locations of the second surface 11b with no intent to be limited by the present embodiment.<br>
Furthermore, each film of the sealing tape 1 has a different adhesion in the present embodiment. The adhesive layer 15 has less adhesion for the second surface 11b of the peel-off layer 11 than the article 2. The adhesive layer 15 has less adhesion for the first anti-adhesive layer 13 than the second surface 11b of the peel-off layer 11. Lastly, the adhesive layer 15 has less adhesion for the two sides of the peel-off layer 11 than the second surface 11 b of the peel-off layer 11.<br>
Referring to FIG.4, the sealing tape 1 is repetitively cross-wrapped on a spool 3 along the overlapped portions to form a spool type product. The inconsistent thickness of the sealing tape 1 caused by partial formation of the adhesive layer 15 is balanced out by repetitively cross-wrapping the sealing tape on the spool 3. On the other hand, a planar surface of the sealing tape 1 is achieved after the different thickness of each overlapped upper and lower layer of the sealing tape 1 is balanced out. Thus, the prior art problem associated with the sealing tape not thoroughly wrapped on the<br>
12<br><br>
discoid unit is solved without using the leakage-proof layer.<br>
Referring to FiGs 5 and 6, the first anti-adhesive layer 13 is located distant from the surface of the article 2 whereas the adhesive layer 15 is adhered toward the open end or other appropriate positions of the article 2 in a sealed state. The user can then peel off the first anti-adhesive layer 13 through one of the two sides of the second surface 11b to peel off the peel-off layer 11, leaving the adhesive layer 15 on the article 2, such that a repetitive peeling open/sealing close action may be performed via the adhesive layer 15 and the part of the article 2 containing no adhesive layer 15.<br>
The sealing tape of the present invention is capable of forming a spool type product without using a leakage-proof layer, so as to overcome the problem such as unevenness and to eliminate drawbacks associated with the adhesive layer adherent to the gaps between overlapping layers of the sealing tape. Also, the entire thickness and the volume of the product can be further reduced. Moreover, in comparison to the sealing tape with no leakage-proof layer known in the prior art which can be repetitively wrapped to form a rewinding type product, the sealing tape proposed in the present invention is wrapped on the same plane to form a spool type product<br>
13<br><br>
containing overlapping portions of the sealing tape on the same plane. For example, if the sealing tape is wrapped 6 times on the same plane, the sealing tape used to form the spool type product in the present invention has a thickness reduced by 6 times as compared to the rewinding type product with the same total length known in the prior art.<br>
In other words, the present invention provides a thinner sealing tape,	So, a<br>
longer sealing tape is wrapped on the discoid unit with the same radius as compared to the prior art. Thus, it is not necessary for the user to frequently replace the new products and the time for loading the sealing tape product onto the article such as a bag, envelope, or the like can be shortened, so as to improve convenience for the user.<br>
Furthermore, the inconsistent thickness of the sealing tape 1 of the present invention can be balanced out to produce the sealing tape product with a planar surface using the spool type method when comparing to the prior art. Also, the adherent material on the interface of overlapped sealing tapes 1 is prevented from leaking into gaps between overlapping layers of the sealing tape 1. Therefore, drawbacks in the prior art such as unevenness and leakage of the adhesive material in the gaps between the overlapping layers can be avoided.   Moreover, the volume and thickness of the product<br>
14<br><br>
between the peel-off layer and the adhesive layer, such that the second anti-adhesive layer can be a film that has a different adhesion from the first anti-adhesive layer.<br>
Among different films of the sealing tape, the adhesive layer has a less adhesion for the second surface of the peel-off layer than the sealed articles. Also, the adhesive layer has a less adhesion for the first anti-adhesive layer than the second surface of the peel-off layer. Lastly, the adhesive layer has a less adhesion for two sides of the peel-off layer than the second surface of the peel-off layer.<br>
Since the adhesion between the films of the sealing tape is different, the sealing tape can be repetitively cross-wrapped using an adhesive layer with an appropriate tightness, so as to prevent the adherent material on the adhesive layer from leaking into the gaps between overlapping layers of the sealing tape. Thus, a spool type product can be fabricated to eliminate drawbacks associated with the adhesive layer adhering to the gaps formed between overlapping layers of the sealing tape as known in the prior art.<br>
Meanwhile, the structure of sealing tape proposed in the present invention is simpler than that of the conventional sealing tape and is capable of<br>
7<br><br>
and the space to be occupied by the product all can be further decreased.<br>
By comparing to the prior art, only a single adhesive layer is formed in the present invention, so as to further simplify the fabrication process, lower the fabrication cost, shorten the time for fabrication, decrease the volume and thickness of the product. Therefore, the space to be occupied by the product is dramatically reduced and the time for loading the sealing tape products onto the article is shortened.<br>
SECOND EMBODIMENT<br>
FIG.7 illustrates the second embodiment of the present invention. The sealing tape V of the present invention comprises a peel off layer 11", a first anti-adhesive layer 13", an adhesive layer 15" and a second anti-adhesive layer 17". The present embodiment is similar to the foregoing embodiment, so only the difference between these two embodiments is described to emphasize the features and advantages of the present invention.<br>
The present embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that a second anti-adhesive layer 17" is formed in the sealing tape 1" and the adhesive layer 15" can be optionally formed to align with one side edge of the sealing tape 1".<br>
15<br><br>
In the present embodiment, the second anti-adhesive layer 17" is formed between the peel-off layer 11" and the adhesive layer 15". The adhesive layer 15" has less adhesion for the second anti-adhesive layer 17" than the article 2". Also, the adhesive layer 15" has less adhesion for the first anti-adhesive layer 13" than the second anti-adhesive layer 17". Lastly, the adhesive layer 15" has less adhesion for two sides of the peel-off layer 11" than the second anti-adhesive layer 17".<br>
Accordingly, an appropriate anti-adhesion is generated from the second anti-adhesive layer without subjecting the second surface 11b" of the peel-off layer 11" to the anti-adhesion treatment, coarsening treatment or other equivalent treatments. The fist anti-adhesive layer 13" disposed on the first surface 11a" of the peel-off layer 11" has a different adhesion from that of the second anti-adhesive layer 17" disposed on the second surface 11b" of the peel-off layer 11".<br>
Therefore, it is understood that the adhesive layer has different adhesions for two sides of the peel-off layer, the first anti-adhesive layer, and/or the second anti-adhesive layer, so the adhesive material of the adhesive layer does not leak into two sides of the peel-off layer after the sealing tape is cross-wrapped to form a spool type product,  preventing the adhesive<br>
16<br><br>
material from adhering to the gaps between overlapping layers of the sealing tape.<br>
By comparing to the prior art, the simple structure of the sealing tape proposed in the present invention is fabricated with reduced fabrication process, lower fabrication cost and shortened fabrication time. Moreover, the volume and thickness of the sealing tape product are reduced to minimize the space occupied by the product, and time required for loading the product onto the article is shortened, so as to eliminate drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
The sealing tape of the present invention provides a spool type product that contains no adherent materials leaking from the gaps between overlapping layers of the sealing tape without using any leakage-proof layer. Accordingly, drawbacks of the prior art such as leakage of adhesive materials, undesired lines of adhesive materials, and hassles for adhesive smear are eliminated. Furthermore, according to the sealing tape of the present invention, the fabrication process is simplified, the fabrication cost is lowered, the fabrication time is shortened, the volume and thickness of the product are decreased, the space occupied by the product is reduced, and the convenience for the user is improved.<br>
17<br><br>

The present invention should therefore cover various modifications and variations made to the herein-described structure and operations of the present invention, provided they fall within the scope of the present invention as defined in the following appended claims.<br>
