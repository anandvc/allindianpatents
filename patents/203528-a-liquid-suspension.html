				<td>ANTIFUNGAL COMPOSITION WITH ENHANCED BIOAVAILABILITY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to stable, liquid suspensions containing an antifungally effective amount of the micronized compound represented by the chemical structural formula I:<br><br>
at least one thickening agent, a non-ionic surfactant, and a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier, and methods of using the suspensions to treat or prevent fungal infections<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,661,151 discloses the compound of formula I and its potent antifungal activity against a broad range of fungi such as Aspergillis, Candida, Cryptococcus, Fusarium, and other opportunistic fungi.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,834,472 and 5,846,971. disclose oral pharmaceutical capsule compositions of the compound of structural formula I coated onto inert beads together with a binder. However, the compound of structural formula I is highly lipophilic, and has an extremely low water solubility. Thus, aqueous compositions of the compound of structural formula I were found to have reduced<br><br>
anti-fungal activity and/or bioavailability, presumably due to the extremely low water solubility of the compound. Accordingly, a need exists for an oral pharmaceutical composition of the compound of structural formula I that has enhanced bioavailability and improved stability characteristics<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have found pharmaceutical compositions, in the form of liquid suspension, suitable for oral administration comprising micronized particles of posaconazole, the compound having the chemical structural formula I<br><br>
at least one thickening agent, a non-ionic surfactant, and a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier that provides significant advantages over the prior art.<br>
Advantages of the liquid suspensions of the present invention include improved homogeneity of the suspension and ease of dispersibility of the suspension. The solids that settle in the liquid suspension of the present invention do not form a solid cake that is difficult to re-disperse. There Is virtually no sedimentation of the solids in the unreconstituted liquid suspension of this invention for a period of at least three days. This surprising feature ensures that a patient having a fungal infection taking the liquid suspensions of the present invention will receive an antifungaily effective amount of posaconazole. The liquid suspensions<br><br>
of the present invention have a longer shelf life. Additionally, the liquid suspension, upon reconstitution, provide substantially the same antifungally effective amount posaconazole as the initially prepared suspension. These features of the liquid suspensions of the present invention provide benefits to pharmacies, pharmacists, doctors and patients having fungal infections.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a liquid suspension comprising micronized posaconazole, having the chemical structural formula I:<br><br>
at least one thickening agent, a non-ionic surfactant, and a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier.<br>
This invention also provides a liquid suspension comprising an antifungally effective amount of micronized posaconazole having the chemical structural formula I:<br><br><br>
an effective amount of at least one thickening agent, an amount of a buffer system effective to maintain the pH of the system in the range of about 4.0 to about 6.0, an effective amount of a non-ionic surfactant, and a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier.<br>
This invention further provides a liquid suspension comprising an antifungally effective amount of micronized posaconazole having the chemical structural formula I:<br><br>
wherein the micronized compound has a mean particle size in the range of about 1200 nm to about 1600 nm, an effective amount of polyoxyethylene derivatives of<br><br>
sorbitan esters of saturated or unsaturated C12to C18 acids, an effective amount of a buffer system sufficient to maintain a pH in the range of about 4.0 to about 6.0, an effective amount of a combination of two thickening agents, wherein one is a liquid sugar, and a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid canrier.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a stable suspension of micronized particles of the antifungal compound posaconazole in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid<br><br>
carrier. The suspension of the present invention is stable to settling without sedimentation when stored undisturbed for more than three days at 25°C, (See Table 1 below).<br>
Table 2 below shows that the liquid suspension formulations of this invention are stable in that the concentration of posaconazole in the suspension is substantially the same (± 2%) compared to the initial concentration (as measured by HPLC) for periods of up to 12 months.<br>
We have also found that the stable suspension of the present invention has a remarkably higher (23-36% increase) bioavailability compared to an optimized oral tablet of micronized particles of posaconazole when each is administered to subjects concurrently with a high fat breakfast. See Tables 3 and 4 and Figures 1 &amp;2<br>
One aspect of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition that contains micronized particles of posaconazole in combination with a non-ionic surfactant, such as a sorbitan ester and at least one thickening agent, preferably a combination of xanthan gum and a liquid sugar, that are easily dispersible in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as purified water. The pharmaceutical composition provides a stabilized suspension that does not settle for at least three days, thus ensuring that patients will get an effective dose of posaconazole. Another feature of the stabilized suspension of the present invention is that it is useful in treating patients with HIV-1 infections with oral thrush without posaconazole precipitating out of solution. Another aspect of the present<br><br>
invention is that the suspension of the present invention avoids formation of solid cakes which are difficult to disperse.<br>
The compound of formula I used in the suspensions of the present invention is available from Schering Corporation. Kenilworth. New Jersey , and has been prepared according to Examples 24 and 32 of U.S. Patent No. 5,661,151 and WO 95/17407.<br>
Micron-sized particles of posaconazole preferably have a mean particle size range of about 1000 nanometers (nm) to about 1800 nm, preferably about 1200 nm to about 1600 nm, and most preferably about 1400 nm. This particle size can be obtained either by the final step during the manufacture of the antifungal compound of formula I or by the use of conventional micronizing techniques after the conventional crystallization procedure(s).<br>
The preferred micronizing technique that is employed to micronize the posaconazole to the desired mean particle size range is microfluidization. Microfluidization is an alternative to traditional homogenization that utilizes the collision of two product streams at high pressures to produce a much more uniform particle size distribution (according to Microfluidics Intemational Co.) and smaller average particle size of about 1200 nm to 1600 nm. The process and equipment used in microfluidization are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,533,254.<br>
The micronized posaconazole of the present invention may also be present in crystalline form. It is preferably substantially chemically and optically pure, and it contains less than about 10 % of its optical isomers, enantiomers or other diastereomers. It may be 99% of the optically pure the levorotatory or<br><br>
dextrarotatory isomer. This optically pure compound of chemical structure I should avoid many of the untoward side effects of a mixture of other optical isomers.<br>
Posaconazole liquid suspension is employed in the composition in antifungally amounts effective to control the fungi of interest. Such antifungally effective amounts can range from about 10 mg/ml to about 100 mg/ml concentration of the liquid suspension formulations of the present invention, more preferably from about 20 mg/ml to about 60 mg/ml, and most preferably about 40 mg/ml of the compound of formula I,<br>
The present invention also provides for a method of treating and/or preventing fungal infection in a mammal comprising administering to the mammal an amount of the liquid suspension containing the micronized posaconazoie in an amount effective for treating and/or preventing such fungal infection. Antifungally effective amounts of liquid suspensions of present invention containing 40 mg/ml of the compound of formula I is administered orally in the doses of 5 ml - containing 200 mg of formula I - three times a day (TID) or four times a day (QID&gt;- or 10 ml-contalning 400 mg of the compound of formula 1-twice a day (BID). Of course, the attending clinician may change the dose and dosing regimen in view of the age, health, and sex of the patient as well as the severity of the fungal infection.<br>

Non-ionic surfactant refers to a surfactant which lacks a net ionic charge and does not dissociate to an appreciable extent in aqueous media. The properties of non-ionic surfactants are largely dependent upon the proportions of the hydrophilic<br><br>
and hydrophobic groups In the molecule. Hydrophilic groups include the oxyethylene group (-OCH2CH2-) and the hydroxy group. By varying the number of these groups in a hydrophobic molecule, such as an ester of a fatty acid, substances are obtained which range from strongly hydrophobic and water insoluble compounds, such as glyceryl monostearate. to strongly hydrophilic and water-soluble compounds, such as the macrogols. Between these two extremes types include those in which the proportions of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups are more evenly balanced, such as the macrogol esters and ethers and sorbitan derivatives.

The following examples describe compositions of the present invention containing posaconazole. but they are not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the claims.<br><br><br>
Specific examples of a composition within the scope of the invention is set forth below.<br><br><br>
This example is prepared as follows: charge approximately 5% of the final batch volume of purified water at 20 + 3°C to a suitable vessel equipped with a mixer propeller. Add 40% of the polysorbate 80 to the purified water in step 1 and mix until dissolved. Add 40% of the simethicone and mix until it is dispersed. Recirculate the mixture in step 3 through a Microfluidizer. operating at about 30,000 ± 5000 psi for approximately 5 passes. Add approximately 7% of the final batch volume of purified water at about 20 + 3°C, and mix for approximately five minutes. Add the Posaconazole to the vessel in step 5 with constant mixing. Continue mixing until it is fully dispersed. Recirculate the suspension portion from step 6 through a Microfluidizer, operating at a pressure of about 30,000 + 5,000 psi. Process the concentrate until the median of the particles shows a particle size of about 1.4 + 0.2 pm, when measured via laser diffraction techniques that are known in the art.<br>
When the particle size has been achieved, pass the suspension through the microfluidizer and collect in a suitable sized vessel. Add approximately 8-10% of the final batch volume of purified water (at 20 + 3°C) to the feed vessel, and pass through the microfluidizer operating at approximately 30,000 psi. Collect the rinse in the vessel containing the concentrate. Add approximately 22% of the final batch volume of purified water (20 + 3°C) to the vessel with the concentrate, and mix for approximately five (5) minutes. Add the remainder of the polysorbate 80 and simethicone, and mix for approximately five (5) minutes.<br>
Add the sodium benzoate, sodium citrate and citric acid and mix for approximately five (5) minutes. Add the xanthan gum slowly with constant mixing. Continue to mix after addition of the xanthan gum. Allow the xanthan gum to<br><br>
hydrate without mixing for 30 minutes. Add the glycerin with constant mixing. Add the liquid glucose slowly with constant mixing. Mix for five minutes or until it is dissolved. Add the titanium dioxide and mix using a suitable homogenizer until that ingredient is fully dispersed. Add the artificial cherry flavor, and mix for approximately five minutes. Add purified water at 20 ± 3°C. and qs up to a final volume, and mix until a uniform suspension is attained. Collect approximately 20 ml sample for pH measurement and physical observation of the suspension. The pH of the suspension of Example 1 was 5.0.<br><br><br><br>
Two bottles containing the suspension of the present invention were shaken and left to rest. The bottles were then sampled immediately (time zero), then after 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes and after 72 hours (three days) post shaking. The levels of posaconazole and of the preservative (Sodium Benzoate) in these samples were assayed by HPLC. HPLC methods of detection are well-known to one of skill in the art.<br><br>
The results of the assay of the preservative and of the posaconazole remained consistent and did not change. These ranged from 39.8 to 40.2 mg/ml (99.5 to 101 %) for the active and 1.99 to 2.02 mg/m: (99.5 to 101 %) for the preservative, respectively. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 1 above.<br>
The sodium benzoate was not expected to sediment. Surprisingly, the posaconazole was not sedimented after 3 days.<br>
Thus, the compositions of the present invention have both ease of dispersibility and homogeneity as is evidenced by the stability of the samples in Table 1.<br>
Next, accelerated homogeneity testing was performed on the liquid suspension of the present invention.<br><br>
These data (sedimentation rate experiment) were in agreement with the real time stability data (up to 6 months at 40°C/75%RH and UD to 24 months at<br><br>
25°C/60%RH) that are shown in Table 2. The assay homogeneity results, surprisingly, remained consistently homogenous and practically unchanged.<br>
After 6 months at 40X/75%RH the homogeneity results ranged from 40,7 to 40.8 mg/ml (101%) for the active and 2.01 to 2.03 mg/ml (101 to 102%) for preservative, respectively. These results were obtained regardless of the portion of the bottle assayed, i.e., top, or bottom of the bottle. Therefore, it can be concluded that the suspension was homogenous throughout the bottle even after relatively long exposure to accelerated stability conditions.<br>
After 24 months at 25°C/60%RH the homogeneity results ranged from 41.5 to 41.6 mg/ml (104%) for the active and 2.01 mg/ml (101 %) for the preservative, respectively. These results were obtained regardless of the portion of the bottle assayed, i.e.. top or bottom of the bottle. Therefore, it can be concluded that the suspension was homogenous throughout the bottle even after long term (24 months) exposure to 25°C/60%RH,<br>
Bioavailability is defined as the rate and extent to that the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety is absorbed into the systemic circulation from an administered dosage form as compared to a standard or control.<br>
Cmax value is defined as the maximum concentration of the antifungal compound measured (i.e. "peak") in the plasma serum.<br>
Formulations of the present invention have the advantage that they have an increased bioavailability and lower variability than previous formulations.<br>
The relative bioavailability of the posaconazole oral suspension was compared to a solid dosage form of posaconazole in healthy subjects.<br><br>
The first objective was to determine the relative bioavailability of posaconazole given as an oral suspension compared to an oral solid formulation when administered with a high-fat breakfast. The second objective was to determine the effect of high-fat and non-fat food relative to fasting conditions on the oral bioavailability of the compound of formula I when given as an oral suspension.<br>
Twenty healthy subjects completed this randomized, open-label. 4-way crossover, single-dose bioavailability and food effect study of posaconazole. Subjects received each of the following four treatments separated by at least a 7 day washout period:<br><br>
Subjects were randomized to either remain fasted (Treatment A), to receive a standardized high fat breakfast {Treatment B or D) or a standardized non-fat breakfast (Treatment C). Meals were consumed in a 20-minute period prior to the morning drug administration and subjects received the appropriate treatment within 5 minute of completing the breakfast.<br><br>
Blood samples (6 ml) were collected into heparinized tubes for each treatment immediately prior to dosing (0 hour) and at 0.5,1.1.5. 2, 3.4, 5, 6, 8.10. 12,16, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours after dosing. Blood was centrifuged at 4°C and plasma stored at or below -20°C until assayed. Plasma concentrations of posaconazole were assayed using a validated high performance liquid chromatographic assay with a LOQ of ng/ml.<br>
Individual plasma concentration-time data were used for pharmacokinetic analysis using model-independent methods. The maximum concentration (Cmax) and time of maximum concentration (Tmax) were the observed values. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the final quantifiable sampling time [AUC(tf)] was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method and extrapolated to infinity (I) as follows:<br><br>
where C(tf) is the estimated concentration determined from linear regression at time, tf.<br>
Total body clearance was calculated by the following:<br><br>
The apparent volume of distribution (Vdarea/F) was calculated from the ratio of the total body clearance to the terminal phase rate constant (K).<br>
Summary statistics were calculated for the plasma suspension formulation of the present invention compared to a prior art tablet formulation concentration-time data at each time point and the derived pharmacokinetic parameters. The original<br><br>
scale and log-transformed Cmax and AUG values were analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The effects due to subject, phase and treatment were extracted.<br>
The plasma concentration-time data and pharmacokinetic parameters for the compound of formula I are tabulated in Tables 3 &amp; 4 and depicted graphically in Figures 1 &amp; 2.<br>
All subjects had 0-hour concentrations on Day 1 reported as below the LOQ (5 ng/ml) except for Subject 20 in Phases 3 and 4 who had quantifiable levels of posaconazole at 0-hour for Treatments B and A of 8.5 and 22.5 ng/ml, respectively. These levels are most likely due to a carry-over effect from accumulation from previous doses.<br>
A summary of the mean pharmacokinetic parameters are provided in the table below:<br><br>
Posaconazole was slowly absorbed; the mean Tmax values ranged from 4.1 to 5.5 hr. Posaconazole was slowly eliminated with a mean terminal t1/2 of about 22 hour which was independent of treatment. This study was conducted to evaluate the bioavailability of posaconazole oral suspension (Treatment B) compared to a<br><br>
tablet formulation (Treatment D), both given with a high-fat food. The results, based on log-transformed data, are shown below:<br><br>
On average, the suspension formulation of the present invention resulted in a 23% increase in Cmax and a 36% increase in AUC(tf) compared to the tablet of the prior art.<br>
The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of high fat food (Treatment B) and non-fat food (Treatment C) compared to fasting (Treatment A) on the oral bioavailability of posaconazole administered as an oral suspension. The results, based on log-transformed data, are shown below;<br><br><br>
A high fat breakfast produced a 4-fold increase in the bioavailability of posaconazole given in a suspension. This was consistent with results from a previous study where food significantly increased the bioavailability of posaconazole by 3-5-fold for both tablet and capsule formulations. The effect of a non-fat breakfast (Treatment C) compared to fasting (Treatment A) was less, with a 2.5-3-foId increase in bioavailability.<br>
