				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for encoding mode signals of a binary shape signal; and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for encoding mode signals based on either a frame-based coding or a field-based coding.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
In digitally televised systems such as video-telephone,<br>
teleconference and high definition television systems, a large amount of digital data is needed to define each video frame signal since a video line signal in the video frame signal comprises a sequence of digital data referred to as pixel values. Since, however, the available frequency.bandwidth of a conventional transmission channel is limited, in order to transmit the large amount of digital data therethrough, it is necessary to compress or reduce the volume of data through the use of various data compression techniques, especially in the case of such low bit-rate video signal encoders as videotelephone and teleconference systems.<br>
One of such techniques for encoding video signals for a<br>
- 1A-<br><br>
low bit-rate encoding system is the so-called object-oriented analysis-synthesis coding technique, wherein an input video image is divided into objects, and three sets of parameters for defining the motion, contour and pixel data of each object are processed through different encoding channels.<br>
One example of such object-oriented coding scheme is the so-called MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) phase 4 (MPEG-4), which is designed to provide an audio-visual coding standard for allowing content-based interactivity, improved coding efficiency and/or universal accessibility in such applications as low-bit rate communication, interactive multimedia (e.g., games, interactive TV, etc.) and area surveillance.<br>
According to MPEG-4, an input video image is divided into a plurality of video object planes (VOP's), which correspond to entities in a bitstream that a user can have an access to and manipulate. A VOP can be referred to as an object and represented by a bounding rectangle whose width and height may be the smallest multiples of 16 pixels (a macroblock size) surrounding each object so that the encoder may process the input video image on a VOP-by-VOP basis.<br>
A VOP described in MPEG-4 includes shape information and color information consisting of luminance and chrominance data, wherein the shape information represented in binary shape signals is referred to as an alpha plane. The alpha plane is partitioned into a plurality of binary alpha blocks,<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
wherein each binary alpha block (BAB) has 16 x 16 binary pixels. Each of the binary pixels is classified as either a background pixel or an object pixel, wherein the background pixel located outside the object in the alpha plane is used to be assigned with a binary pixel value, e.g., 0, while the object pixel inside the object is used to be assigned with another binary pixel value, e.g., 255.<br>
Each of the binary pixels in the BAB may be encoded by using a conventional bit-map-based shape coding method such as a context-based arithmetic encoding (CAE) discipline. For instance, in an intra mode, all binary pixels of a BAB are encoded by using an intra CAE discipline to thereby generate an intra coded BAB, wherein a context value for each binary pixel of the BAB in the intra CAE discipline is calculated by using binary pixel values of a predetermined number, e.g., 10 of binary pixels surrounding said each binary pixel in the BAB. While, in an inter mode, all binary pixels of a current BAB is encoded by using an inter CAE discipline to thereby generate an inter encoded BAB, wherein a context value of each binary pixel of the current BAB in the inter CAE discipline is calculated by using binary pixel values of a predetermined number, e.g., 4 of binary pixels surrounding said each binary pixel in the current BAB and binary values of a predetermined number, e.g., 5 of binary pixels within a bordered motion compensated BAB (see MPEG-4 Video Verification Model Version 7.0, International Organisation for Standardisation, Coding<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
of Moving Pictures And Associated Audio Information, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 MPEG97/N1642, Bristol, April 1997, pp 28-30).<br>
Meanwhile, in the conventional binary shape encoding discipline, a mode signal representing or characterizing a corresponding encoding condition for the BAB is encoded to improve the coding efficiency, thereby generating and then transmitting a corresponding encoded mode signal.<br>
For example, if all of the binary pixels within a BAB are object pixels, instead of encoding binary pixel values of the object pixels to generate encoded binary pixel values to be transmitted, it will be preferable to encode a mode signal informing that all of the binary pixels within the BAB are object pixels. By employing the method described above, it is possible to enhance the coding efficiency by transmitting the corresponding encoded mode signal as binary shape information for the BAB.<br>
Referring to Table 1, there are 7 number of modes for the binary alpha information of a BAB according to a conventional mode coding discipline, wherein a motion vector difference for shape (MVD) of the BAB is a difference between a motion vector for shape (MV) and a motion vector predictor for shape (MVP); and the MVP is determined by using a conventional motion estimation disciplined see MPEG-4 Video Verification Model Version 7.0, International Organization for Standardization, Coding of Moving Pictures And Associated Audio Information, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 MPEG97/N1642, Bristol, April 1997, pp<br>

In Table 1, mode 1 represents that a motion vector difference for shape (MVD) for the BAB is defined as zero and all the binary pixels within the BAB need not be encoded; mode 2 describes that the MVD is not defined as zero and all the binary pixels within the BAB need not be encoded; mode 3 tells that the MVD is defined as zero and all the binary pixels within the BAB has been encoded by the inter CAE discipline; mode 4 signifies that the MVD is not defined as zero and all the binary pixels within the BAB has been encoded by the inter CAE discipline; mode 5 implies that all the binary pixel within the BAB has been encoded by the intra CAE discipline; ; mode 6 tells that all the binary pixels within the BAB are<br>
- 5 -	<br><br>
defined as background pixels; and mode 7 represents that all the binary pixels within the BAB are defined as object pixels. Conventional binary shape encoding methods employing the conventional mode coding method described above are basically progressive coding methods. Namely, in the conventional binary shape encoding methods, an interlaced coding technique performed by using field-by-field basis motion estimation method has not been used. Hence, even if spatial and/or temporal correlation between frames is lower than that of fields, the interlaced coding technique has not been employed, thereby limiting the capability of enhancing the coding efficiency thereof.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for coding mode signals efficiently by performing either a progressive coding or an interlaced coding adaptively.<br>
It is another primary object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for coding mode signals efficiently in the interlaced coding by modifying a bottom mode of the bottom field by a top mode of the top field.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, there is illustrated an apparatus for coding modes of shape information on a binary alpha block (BAB) basis in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, wherein the shape information represented in binary shape signals is referred to as an alpha plane. The alpha plane is partitioned into a plurality of binary alpha blocks and the binary alpha blocks are provided as the shape information to a frame detection block 10, wherein each binary alpha block (BAB) has 16 x 16 binary pixels.<br>
 The frame detection circuit 10 examines whether a coding<br>
mode  of  each  BAB  is  either  " all_0"  or  " all_255".<br><br>
Specifically, a BAB is preferably partitioned into 16 number of subblocks of 4 x 4 pixels. If all errors between all subblocks of the BAB and an all_0 subblock are smaller than or equal to a predetermined threshold, all the binary pixels of the BAB are changed to background pixels with a pixel value '0' and an indication signal S1= 'all_0' indicating that the BAB is defined as "all_0" is provided to a mode multiplexor (MUX) 90, wherein the all_0 subblock is a subblock whose binary pixel values are all '0'. If all errors between all subblocks of the BAB and an all_255 subblock are smaller than or equal to the predetermined threshold, all the binary pixels of the BAB are changed to object pixels with a pixel value '255' and an indication signal S1='all_255' indicating that<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
the BAB is defined as "all_255" is provided to the mode MUX 90, wherein the all_255 subblock is a subblock whose binary pixel values are '255'.<br>
If the coding mode of the BAB is neither "all_0" nor<br>
"all_255", the BAB's of the alpha plane are provided to a mode<br>
selection circuit 20 and a switch 25.  The mode selection<br>
circuit 20 determines whether the BAB is encoded on either a frame basis or a field basis; generates a coding mode signal S2 indicating the BAB is encoded on either a frame basis or a field basis; and provides the coding mode signal S2 to the switch 25 and the mode MUX 90. The mode MUX 90 generates a base mode signal for the BAB based on the indication signal S1 and the coding mode signal S2<br>
Referring to Table 2, there are exemplarily illustrated 4 number of base mode signals generated in the mode MUX 90.<br>

In the switch 25, the BAB is switched to either a frame coding circuit 30 or a frame divider 27 based on the coding<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
mode signal S2. Specifically, if the BAB is encoded on a frame basis, the BAB is provided as BAB frame data to frame coding circuit 30 and, if otherwise, the BAB is provided to the frame divider 27.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, there is illustrated a detailed block diagram of the frame coding circuit shown in Fig. 1, wherein the BAB frame data is provided as a current BAB to a frame no_update circuit 32, a motion estimation and motion compensation (ME &amp; MC) circuit 33, and a frame MUX 35 within a frame reconstruction unit 44.<br>
The ME &amp; MC circuit 33 determines a motion vector predictor (MVP) of the current BAB based on candidate MVP's retrieved from a memory 34 in the frame reconstruction unit 44; computes a motion vector (MV) and a motion vector difference (MVD) of the current BAB; carries out a motion compensation according to the MV to generate a bordered motion compensated (bordered MC) block; and provides the MVD and the bordered MC block to a MVD coding circuit 36 and the frame no_update circuit 32, respectively, wherein the MVD represents a displacement between the MV and the MVP and the bordered MC block represents both a motion compensated BAB (MC BAB), obtained by displacing each binary pixel of a previous BAB corresponding to the MVP with the MV, and a border of width 1 pixel around the MC BAB (see MPEG-4 Video Verification Model Version 7.0, International Organization for Standardization, Coding of Moving Pictures And Associated Audio Information,<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11 MPEG97/N1642, Bristol, April 1997, pp 20-23).<br>
The MVD coding circuit 36 generates an MVD signal S3 indicating whether or not the MVD is equal to '0' to provide the MVD signal S3 to the mode determination circuit 43 and, if the MVD is not equal to '0', the MVD coding circuit 36 encodes the MVD of the current BAB to provide the encoded MVD data itself to an inter bit calculation circuit 40 within a context_based arithmetic encoding unit(CAE unit) 45 and a data MUX 95 via a line L36.<br>
In the meantime, the frame no_update circuit 32 determines whether the current BAB is identical to the MC BAB and provides a no_update signal S4 indicating whether or not the current BAB must be encoded to the mode determination circuit 43. First of all, the frame no_update circuit 32 separates the current BAB into 16 number of current subblocks and partitions the MC BAB into 16 number of MC subblocks, wherein each of the current and MC subblocks has 4x4 pixels and the MC BAB field is obtained by discarding the border of width 1 pixel around the bordered MC BAB. The frame no_update circuit 52 determines whether each error between each of the current BAB subblocks and its corresponding MC subblock is smaller than or equal to the predetermined threshold. If all the errors are smaller than or equal to the predetermined threshold, it is reasonable that the current BAB will not be encoded so that the signal S4 indicates no_update.<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
On the contrary, if at least one error among errors between the BAB subblocks and their corresponding MC subblocks are greater than the predetermined threshold, i.e., if the current BAB must be coded as described below, the frame no_update circuit 32 provides the current BAB to an intra context_based arithmetic encoding (intra CAE) circuit 37 and an inter CAE circuit 39 within the CAE unit 45 and provides the bordered MC BAB to the inter CAE circuit 39.<br>
The intra CAE circuit 37 encodes all the binary pixels of the current BAB based on 3 number of adjacent reconstructed BAB's retrieved via a line L35 from a frame MUX 35 within the reconstruction unit 44 by using the conventional intra CAE discipline, wherein each adjacent reconstructed BAB, adjacent to the current BAB in a top-left, a top or a left direction, includes 16 x 16 reconstructed pixels. In the conventional intra CAE discipline, an intra context value for each binary pixel of the current BAB is calculated by using binary pixel values of a predetermined number, e.g., 10 of candidate binary-pixels surrounding said each binary pixel, wherein the candidate binary pixels are selected among all the reconstructed pixels in the 3 adjacent reconstructed BAB's and one or more intra encoded current pixels, if any, having already been encoded by the intra CAE discipline, and said each binary pixel is encoded based on the intra context value to be an intra encoded pixel for said each binary pixel. All the intra encoded pixels are provided as intra CAE data to an<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
intra bit calculation circuit 38 and a selector 42.<br>
The intra bit calculation block 38 calculates the number of bits which are needed to represent the intra CAE data and provides the number of bits of the intra CAE data to a comparator 41.<br>
In the meantime, the inter CAE circuit 39 encodes all binary pixels of the current BAB based on the adjacent reconstructed BAB's retrieved via the line L35 and the bordered MC BAB by using an inter CAE discipline. In the inter CAE discipline, an inter context value of each binary pixel in the current BAB is calculated by using binary pixel values of a predetermined number, e.g., 4 of reconstructed binary pixels surrounding said each binary pixel in the current BAB and binary values of a predetermined number, e.g., 5 of bordered MC binary pixels within a bordered motion compensated BAB, and said each binary pixel is encoded based on the inter context value to generate inter encoded pixel for said each binary pixel. All the inter encoded pixels are provided as inter CAE data to the inter bit calculation circuit 40 and the selector 42.<br>
The inter bit calculation circuit 40 calculates the number of bits which are needed to represent both the inter CAE data and the encoded MVD data, if any, and provides the same number of bits to the comparator 41.<br>
In the comparator 41, if the number of bits of the intra CAE data is smaller than that of the inter CAE data and the<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
encoded MVD data, an intra/inter signal S5 representing the intra CAE data is provided to the selector 42 and the mode determination circuit 43; and if otherwise, the intra/inter signal S5 representing the inter CAE data and the encoded MVD data is provided.<br>
In response to the intra/inter signal S5, the selector 42 selects either the intra CAE data or the inter CAE data and the encoded MVD data to thereby provide the selected result to the data MUX 95.<br>
In the meantime, the mode determination circuit 43 determines a frame coding mode of the current BAB based on the signals S3, S4 and S5 and provides the frame coding mode to the frame MUX 35 within the frame reconstruction unit 44 and a frame mode coding circuit 47 shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In response to the frame coding mode from the mode determination circuit 43, the frame MUX 35 reconstructs the current BAB to generate a reconstructed BAB. In other words, the frame MUX 35 displaces the current BAB itself or the MC BAB among the bordered MC BAB fed from the ME &amp; MC circuit 33 with the reconstructed BAB based on the frame coding mode. The reconstructed BAB is provided from the frame MUX 35 to the memory 34, the intra CAE circuit 37 and an inter CAE circuit 39 via the line L35 for the processing of a next BAB frame data.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 1, the frame mode coding circuit 47 generates a frame mode signal for the current BAB based on<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
a conventional statistical coding technique to provide the frame mode signal to the mode MUX 90.<br>

Referring to Table 3, there are exemplarily illustrated 5 number of frame mode signals for the frame BAB in accordance with the frame coding mode based on the signals S3, S4 and S5, wherein a motion vector difference for shape (MVD) of the frame BAB is a difference between a motion vector for shape (MV) and a motion vector predictor for shape (MVP); and the MVP is determined by using a conventional motion estimation discipline.<br>
On the contrary, if the BAB is provided from the switch 25 to the frame divider 27 in order to be encoded on a field basis in response to the coding mode signal S2, the frame divider 27 divides the BAB into a top and a bottom field BAB's, wherein the top field BAB preferably contains every odd row of the BAB and the bottom field BAB contains every even<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
row of the BAB, and provides the top and the bottom field BAB'8 as field BAB data to a top and a bottom field coding circuits 50 and 70, respectively. If the BAB has 16 x 16 pixels, it is reasonable that each of the top and the bottom field BAB's has 8 x 16 pixels. The top field coding circuit 50 is substantially identical to the bottom field coding circuit 70 so that a representative field coding circuit is described as follows.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, there is illustrated a detailed block diagram of the top/bottom field coding circuit shown in Fig. 1, wherein the field BAB data is provided as a current field BAB to a field detection circuit 51. The field coding circuit is similar to the frame coding circuit so that the field coding circuit is briefly illustrated as follows.<br>
The field detection circuit 51 examines a coding mode of each current field BAB on a field-by-field basis to check if the coding mode is either one of "all_0M and "all_255". If the coding mode of the current field BAB is either one of "all_0" and "all_255", an indication signal S6 indicating the current field is defined as either one of "all_0" and "all_255l* is provided to a mode determination circuit 63. If the coding mode of the current field BAB is neither "all_0" nor "all_255", the current field BAB is provided to a field no_update circuit 52, an ME &amp; MC circuit 53, and a field MUX 55 within a field reconstruction unit 64.<br>
The ME &amp; MC circuit 53 determines a motion vector<br>
- 17 -<br><br>
predictor (MVP) of the current field BAB based on candidate MVP's retrieved from the memory 34 in the field reconstruction unit 64 in accordance with the conventional MPEG-4 discipline, wherein each candidate MVP is preferably selected among reconstructed bottom field BAB's of the reconstructed frame BAB's in the memory 34. The memory 34 is commonly owned by the top field coding circuit 50, the bottom field coding circuit 70 and the frame reconstruction unit 44 of the frame coding circuit 30 shown in Fig. 2. After computing the MV and the MVD of the current field BAB, the ME &amp; MC circuit 53 provides the MVD and a bordered MC field block to a MVD coding circuit 56 and the field no_update circuit 52, respectively, wherein the MVD represents a displacement between the MV and the MVP and the bordered MC field block represents both a MC field BAB and a border of width 1 pixel around the MC field BAB. The MC field BAB for the top or the bottom field BAB is obtained by displacing each binary pixel of a top or a bottom field BAB of a previous BAB corresponding to the MVP by the MV.<br>
The MVD coding circuit 56 which is substantially identical to the MVD coding circuit 36 of the frame coding circuit provides an MVD signal S7 indicating whether or not the MVD is equal to '0' to the mode determination circuit 63 and, if any, encodes the MVD of the current field BAB to provide the encoded MVD data itself to an inter bit calculation circuit 60 within a CAE unit 65 and the data MUX<br>
- 18 -<br><br>
95 via a line L56.<br>
In -the meantime, the field no__update circuit 52 provides a no_update signal S8 to the mode determination circuit 63, wherein the no_update signal S8 indicates whether or not the current field BAB is identical to the MC field BAB so that the current field BAB must be encoded. If the current field BAB is identical to the MC field BAB, it is reasonable that the current BAB will not be encoded so that the signal S8 indicates no_update. On the contrary, if the current BAB must be encoded as described below, the field no_update circuit 52 provides the current field BAB and the bordered MC field BAB to the CAE unit 65 in a similar manner described before for the frame coding circuit 30, except replacing the word "frame" with the word "field".<br>
The CAE unit 65 of the top/bottom field coding circuit 50 and 70 is substantially identical to the CAE unit 45 of the frame coding circuit 30 shown in Fig. 2 and the CAE unit 65 of the top/bottom field coding circuit 50 and 70 similarly includes an intra CAE circuit 57, an intra bit calculation circuit 58, an inter CAE circuit 59, the inter bit calculation circuit 60, a comparator 61 and a selector 62. From the comparator 61, an intra/inter signal S9 indicating whether or not the intra CAE data for the current field BAB is preferable to the inter CAE data is provided to the selector 62 and the mode determination circuit 63, and, in response to the intra/inter signal S9, the selector 62 selects either the<br>
- 19 -<br><br>
intra CAE data or the inter CAE data to thereby provide the selected result to the data MUX 95.<br>
In the meantime, the mode determination circuit 63 determines a field coding mode of the current field BAB based on the signals S6, S7, S8 and S9 and provides the field coding mode to the frame MUX 55 within the reconstruction unit 64. The field coding mode is also provided to a top mode coding circuit 67 from the top field coding circuit 50 or a bottom mode code circuit 87 from the bottom field coding circuit 70 as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
In response to the field coding mode from the mode determination circuit 63, the frame MUX 55 reconstructs the current field BAB. In other words, in response to the field coding mode, the frame MUX 55 replaces any of an "all_0" field BAB, an "all_255" field BAB, the current field BAB itself fed from the field detection circuit 51 and the MC field BAB fed from the ME &amp; MC circuit 53 with the reconstructed field BAB for the current field BAB. The reconstructed field BAB is provided from the field MUX 55 to the memory 34, the intra CAE circuit 57 and the inter CAE circuit 59 via the line L55 for the processing of next field BAB data.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 1, the top mode coding circuit 67 generates a top mode signal for the current top field BAB based on the conventional statistical coding technique to provide the top mode signal to the bottom mode coding circuit 87.<br>

The bottom mode coding circuit 87 generates a modified bottom mode signal for the current bottom field BAB based on the conventional statistical coding technique, wherein the modified bottom mode signal is determined depending on the top mode signal; and attaches the top mode signal to the modified bottom mode signal to provide the attached mode signal as a<br>

Referring to Table 5, there are exemplarily illustrated 47 number of modified bottom mode signals for the bottom field BAB modified by the 7 top mode signals, wherein the Bl represents a first bottom mode indicating that a motion vector difference for shape (MVD) for the BAB is defined as zero and all the binary pixels within the BAB need not be encoded and so on. Bi is to the bottom field what Ti is to the top field, i being 1 to 7. There is no "all_0" in the bottom mode for the sixth top mode T6, because the "all_0" for the frame BAB has already been checked in the frame detection circuit 10.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 1, after generating a base mode signal based on the indication signal S1 and the coding mode signal S2 as described above, the mode MUX 90 multiples the<br>
