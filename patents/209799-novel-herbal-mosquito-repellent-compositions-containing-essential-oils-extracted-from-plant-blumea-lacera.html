The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br><br>
422/MUMNP/2007<br><br>
GRANTED<br>
23/3/2007<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to novel herbal mosquito repellant compositions. More specifically the present invention relates to mosquito repellant compositions prepared from extracts of fresh leaves of Blumea lacera [Burm.f.] DC. Further these compositions are evaluated for knock and kill effect on mosquitoes as well as their toxicity. Further this invention relates to process for preparation of extract of Blumea lacera [Burm.f] DC and their characterization by chromatographic techniques.<br>
Background and prior art:<br>
Mosquito menace is a global problem. Diseases like malaria, filariasis, Dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Ross river virus, Burma forest virus, Murrcey Valley encephalitis etc, are known to spread through mosquitoes. Even developed countries such as USA have seen a resurgence of mosquitoe menace and diseases like west Nile virus in the 21st century. Developing and least developed countries from Africa, Asia, and Latin America and rest of the world have been unsuccessfully attempting to control the mosquito menace and to eradicate the scourge of malaria and other diseases.<br>
However, elimination or eradication of mosquitoes or mosquitoes larvae, as well as development of safer, less toxic, more effective, human-friendly mosquito repellants have not received adequate attention of research communities.<br>
There are very few natural or herbal solutions for repelling mosquitoes reported in the literature. Some natural products which effectively repel mosquitoes are reported, but they require more frequent reapplication (at least every 2 hours) and higher concentration than DEET. It is believed that products that contain multiple repellants tend to be more effective than those containing a single ingredient; however this is not proven by experiments. Natural repellants hitherto reported are based on volatile plant oils such as citronella oil, Castor oil, Rosemary oil, lemongrass oil, Cedar oil, peppermint oil, clove oil, geranium oil and possibly oils from verbena, pennyroyal, lavender, pine, cajuput, cinnamon, basil, thyme, allspice, soybean and garlic. Another plant-derived substance, pyrethrum is an insecticide which comes from the flowers of the daisy Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium.<br>
Plant derived repellants:<br>
Thousands of plants have been tested as potential sources of insect repellants. None of the plant derived chemicals tested to date, demonstrate the broad effectiveness and duration of DEET. Plants essential oils have been reported to have repellant activity, but when tested, most of these oils tend to give short-lasting protection, usually less than 2 hours.<br><br><br>
Citronella is the active ingredient most commonly found in the natural or herbal insect repellants marketed in the US markets. It is registered with the EPA as an insect repellant. Studies show that citronella can be an effective repellant, but it provides shorter complete protection time than most DEET-based products. The citrosa plant (pelargonium citrosum 'van leenii') has been marketed as being able to repel mosquitoes through the continuous release of citronella oils. Unfortunately when tested, these plants offer no protection against bites.<br>
A combination of soybean oil, geranium oil, and coconut oil in a formulation under the brand name of Bite Blocker has been released in the US market in 1997. Studies proved that this product gave more than 97% protection against under field conditions where as 6.65% DEET based spray afforded 86%, and citronella based repellant gave only 40% protection during the same period.<br>
Permethrin is effective against mosquitoes, flies, ticks, and chiggers. Permethrin has low toxicity in mammals, and poorly absorbed by the skin. Permethrin should be applied directly to clothing or other fabrics. The spray form is nonstaining, nearly odor less, and resistant to degradation by heat or sun and maintains its potency for 2 weeks.<br>
Anti-malarial drugs and drugs for other vector-borne diseases are known to have bad side-effects and develop resistance very fast. Most communities needing treatment and prevention are poor and unable to afford expensive health solutions for health care and sanitation. Even though the global magnitude of the problem is alarmingly increasing the attention to seek solutions to this scourge from research communities, from both developed and developing countries are minimal and extremely disappointing. Organizations like WHO, World Bank and NGO's world over are keen to encourage and support preventive and curative research efforts in this field.<br>
We have recognized the urgency and magnitude of the need for inventing an effective, harmless, safe, non-toxic, and affordable mosquito repellant which can be formulated smoothly and effectively into a variety of compositions and delivery systems such as liquids, vapours and mats.<br>
With this objective we have evaluated herbal plant for mosquito repellant properties. There are however very few prior art patents on mosquito repellants or herbal insect repellants. A few patents describe the chemical constituent of the mosquito repellant.<br>
US patent 6291745 reports limonene and other downstream metabolites of geranyl pyrophosphate for insect control in plants. US 6362235 describes the method, apparatus and compositions for inhibiting the human scent tracking of mosquitoes in environmentally defined three dimensional spaces.<br>
Neem is known to have been used in traditional Indian Communities as an insect and mosquito repellant.<br><br><br>
Almost every household in urban India uses mosquito repellent in some form or the other. Various mosquito repellants currently marketed consist of DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), Prallathrin, Allethrin, Cyclothrin, etc. as their active chemical ingredients. Most of the mosquito repellent formulations available in the market are mainly prepared with active ingredients of synthetic origin. Safety of these constituents is doubtful, and especially their long term effects. Development of a new safe mosquito repellant from herbal source is therefore the need of the hour. Mosquito menace is ubiquitous problem in Indian subcontinent. There are various methods which local populations use against mosquitoes with varying degrees of success rates.<br>
Blumea lacera [Burm.f.] DC is a weed avoided by insects, and its insect repellant properties have already been reported. Its potential use in mosquito control however, has never been evaluated. Blumea lacera [Blufm.f.J DC (tamily Asteraceae) is a weed, growingn in abundance in major parts of tropical and sub tropical parts of India. It has aromatic essential oil, which is reported to have an insect repellant property.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
Extracts of Blumea lacera are prepared by solvent extraction and also by steam distillation. These extracts and essential oils are standardized, evaluated and characterized using chromatographic techniques.<br>
Further herbal mosquito repellent formulations in liquid, vapour and mat form are prepared from the said extracts. Polymer -bounded compositions for slow release are also prepared.<br>
Knock and kill effect of Blumea lacera extracts and their formulations on mosquitoes is evaluated and compared with marketed branded formulations. Mosquito repellant activity of Blumea lacera compositions is established as equivalent or superior to market compositions.<br>
Toxicity of the said extracts and compositions are evaluated to establish acceptable levels of active contents to optimize knock and kill effect (K&amp;K) and knock down (KD) values.<br>
Detailed description:<br>
The present investigations were undertaken to standadardise the usefulness of the plant against mosquitoes and develop a formulation for mosquito repellent. The work is divided into two parts. The first part is to evaluate the phytoconstituents in the plant using Chromatography. The second part is to evaluate the Knock and Kill effect of the essential oils of Blumea lacera on mosquitoes.<br><br>
Preparation of extracts<br>
Essential oil extraction by steam distillation:<br>
The fresh leaves were separated from the plant and then introduced into the flask through which steam was passed. The water vapors along with the oil droplets were condensed. The condensed vapors and oil were collected in a collecting vessel. The entire distillate along with the oil was transferred to a separating funnel. To it diethyl ether was added and shaken to extract the oil from the aqueous medium. The ether layer was separated, passed through anhydrous sodium sulphate and then evaporated to dryness on a rotary vaporizer under vacuum at 40°C. Yellowish colour oil was obtained. This oil was used for chromatography. A 10 μL/mL solution was prepared in diethyl ether and 20 fxL of it was used for chromatographic separation.<br>
Essential oil extraction using diethyl ether solvent:<br>
Fresh leaves were separated from the plant and transferred to a 3 liter capacity beaker. To it diethyl ether solvent was added and the mouth of the beaker was sealed with aluminum foil and kept for extraction in a refrigerator for around 6 hours. At the end of the 6 hour period of extraction the leaves were squeezed with the aid of a manual screw tight squeezer made of brass to separate the solvent from the leaves. The solvent obtained was a mixture of ether and aqueous components. To separate the ether layer from the aqueous, the mixture was transferred to a separating funnel and allowed to stand undisturbed till the two layers were separated. The ether layer was separated, passed through anhydrous sodium sulphate and then evaporated to dryness on a rotary vaporizer under vacuum at 40°C to yield a green coloured oily extract (0.08% to 0.09% of extract). This oily extract was used for chromatography. A 10 μL/mL solution was prepared in diethyl ether and 20 μL of it was used for chromatographic separation.<br>
HPTLC Analysis of the extracts:<br>
The separation of essential oils was achieved by HPTL Chromatography, using toluene and ethyl acetate as mobile phase. Solution prepared for chromatographic separation were applied on HPTLC plate and developed with toluene and ethyl acetate (9:1) mobile phase. HPTLC plate was air dried, scanned and results obtained are tabulated in Table A. Further the same HPTLC plate was sprayed with 1% vanillin-sulfuric acid reagent, confirmatory test for presence of essential oil.<br><br>
Table A: Data of Rf values for essential oil of Blumea lacera obtained through steam distillation and solvent extraction.<br><br>
Note: The Rf values marked with * gave positive reaction for essential oil test using vanillin-sulfuric acid spray reagent.<br>
HPLC Analysis of Blumea lacera extracts<br>
The oils (solution prepared for chromatographic separation) were free of ether and dissolved in acetonitrile to obtain a concentration of 1000 ppm concentration solution. A 100 ppm solution from 1000 ppm solution was made in mobile phase which was used for analysis. The separation of essential oils was achieved by using Jasco HPLC PU-1580 Pump, with acetonitrile and water as mobile phase. Table B provides details of the AUC and Rt for the peaks obtained in the chromatogram for both the extracts.<br><br>

Head-Space GC/MS analysis of Blumea lacera Extracts<br>
Head- Space GC/MS analysis of Blumea lacera are conducted with fresh leaves, and with the essential oils obtained from the extracts of steam distillation and diethyl ether. The data obtained from MS analysis for the phytoconstituents have also been provided in Table C, D and E. The comparative account of the phytoconstituents identified using the two libraries (Wiley and Nist) from fresh leaves, diethyl ether solvent extract and steam distillate are summarized in table F.<br>
Diethyl ether was selected as the solvent for extraction of essential oils as it not only gave more extraction yield but also more number of phytoconstituents by HPLC and HPTLC analysis as compared to the essential oil obtained through steam distillation. This is supported with the findings by Head Space/GC/MS analysis.<br>

Evaluation of the knock and kill effect of Blumea lacera.<br>
The cage was made of wooden frames with glass fittings. The glass fittings were made in order to facilitate in the observation of the mosquito within the cage. The internal dimensions of the cage are as below;<br>
Length	=78	cm<br>
Breath	=   68	cm<br>
Height	=68	cm<br>
Volume of the cage	=   360672	cm3<br>
The floor of the cage was marked into 8 quadrants. A plug point is provided inside the cage for fitting the vaporizing machine with external power on/off switch. This enables one to control the time for which the machine can be switched on and off during the experiment without disturbing the mosquitoes inside the cage. This plug point is refereed to as the source. The cage sides are adequately sealed with a sealant to plug leakage of vapours.<br>
The experiments were divided into two sections;<br>
Section 1: To establish the mosquito repellant activity of the herb and compare it<br>
with some marketed formulations (positive control). Section 2: To establish the KD50 and KD90 of the extract of Blumea lacera and compare it with some marketed formulations (positive control).<br>
The experiments in Section 1 are illustrated by the following Examples,<br>
General procedure:<br>
The test material is placed in the first quadrant (source). Known numbers of mosquitoes (mixed population) are introduced into the "Knock and Kill" cage. The mosquitoes are given a period of 10 minutes for acclimatization. After 10 minutes 0.00 hour reading is taken and the mosquito count with respect to their position in the quadrants recorded. Subsequent readings are made as explained in the respective experiments. Observations are made on the behaviour of the mosquitoes and for the knock and kill effect (if any) due to the test materials/conditions.<br>
Example 1: The experiments in this stage were designed to evaluate the effect of the closed cage environment without any test substance on the mosquitoes.<br>
To study the behaviour pattern of the mosquitoes in the Knock and Kill cage under normal conditions i.e. without any treatment or test substance, the mosquitoes were introduced in to the cage. Initially mosquitoes were flying randomly throughout the cage. After 10 minutes of acclimatizing to the new environment some of the mosquitoes had settled down and their count recorded. The settling and flying pattern of the mosquitoes was recorded for a period of 6.00 hours. Around 15% were still flying or active, 65% had settled down and 20% knocked down after 3.00 hours. Around 1% still active, 35% settled down, 42% knocked down and 22% death at the end of 4.00 hours was observed<br><br><br>
Example 2: The experiments in this stage were designed to evaluate the effect of deodorised kerosene, which is the solvent in the marketed formulations.<br>
To study the behaviour pattern of the mosquitoes in the "Knock and Kill" cage due to the vapours of deodorised kerosene, filled in a vial which was attached to a vaporizer introduced into the cage. When the mosquitoes were introduced in to the cage they were flying randomly throughout the cage. After 10 minutes of acclimatizing to the new environment some of the mosquitoes had settled down and their count recorded. The flying, settling, knocked down and death pattern of the mosquitoes was recorded for a period of 4.00 hours. Around 11% were still flying or active, 48% had settled down and 41% knocked down was observed at the end of half an hour of experimentation. About 7% were still sitting, 53% knock down and 40% mortality at the end of 1.00 hour of experimentation. Cent percent mortality was observed at the end of 2.00 hours of experiment. Appendage shedding was also observed at the end of 0.50 hours of experimentation.<br>
Example 3: The experiments in this stage were designed to evaluate the effect of the Positive control samples obtained from the local market in liquid and mat form (Marketed commercial products).<br>
To study the behaviour pattern of the mosquitoes in the "Knock and Kill" cage with branded formulations in the market which will serve as positive control was done. Three products were taken from the market at random. Two were in the form of mat and one as a liquid. All the three products contained the same active ingredient. The mats or the liquid were placed in position with the vaporizing machine inside the cage. The flying, settling, knocked down and death pattern of the mosquitoes was recorded for a period of 4.00 hours. Knocked down of mosquitoes was seen at the end of 0.50 hours of their contact with the vapors of the test material. The knocked down rate was almost 100% for all the three formulations containing prallathrin at concentrations ranging from 1.0% to 1.6%. Mat containing 1.0% prallathrin showed around 20% death, while mat containing 1.2% prallathrin showed around 40% death and liquid containing 1.6% prallathrin showed around 95% death at the end of 2.00 hrs. Cent percent mortality was observed for liquid sample at the end of 3.00 hrs and for 1.2% prallathrin mat it was observed after 4.00 hours. One percent prallathrin mat on the other hand showed around 70% mortality at the end of 4.00 hours. It was observed that knocked down mosquitoes showed circular movements in the upside down position. All the dead mosquitoes had their wings folded inwards. Appendage shedding was also observed at the end of 2.00 hours of experimentation.<br>
Example 4: The experiments in this stage were designed to evaluate the effect of intact fresh leaves of Blumea lacera.<br>
To study the behaviour pattern of the mosquitoes in the "Knock and Kill" cage due to the introduction of known amount of fresh leaves of Blumea lacera, weighed amount (25 g) of fresh leaves were taken in a wide mouth shallow plastic container (6 inches diameter and 3 inches height). The mouth of the container was covered with a piece of mosquito<br><br><br>
net. The container with the leaves was placed inside the cage in the first quadrant. Observations were made for 4 hours. At the end of the first hour of the mosquitoes interaction with the vapors of volatile components of the fresh leaves of Blumea lacera, 13% of the mosquitoes were still flying. Around 10% active or flying, 69% settled down and 20% knock down was observed at the end of 2.00 hours and around 27% settled down and 73% knock down at the end of 4.00 hours. At the end of first hour after the count the mosquitoes were disturbed by taping at the walls of the cage to observe if the mosquitoes that had settled down were in a position to fly or not. It was interesting to observe that the mosquitoes could not be dislodged from their position.<br>
Example 5: The experiments in this stage were designed to evaluate the effect of essential oils from fresh leaves obtained through steam distillation in liquid form.<br>
To study the behaviour pattern of the mosquitoes in the Knock and Kill cage after introduction of essential oils obtained from the fresh leaves of Blumea lacera by steam distillation in liquid form was prepared in deodorized kerosene and was used for testing the mosquito repellent activity. A 10,000ppm (12.5 %w/w) solution of the yellowish coloured oil obtained through steam distillation was prepared in deodorized kerosene and was used for testing the mosquito repellent activity. The liquid was transferred to a bottle and attached to a vaporizing machine that was placed in position inside the cage. Observations were made for 4 hours. Steam distillate extract of Blumea lacera showed 45% knock down at the end of half an hour of the mosquitoes interaction with the vapors. Around 54% mortality was observed at the end of 1.00 hour and 100% mortality at the end of 2.00 hours of experimentation. It was observed that knocked down mosquitoes showed circular movements in the upside down position. Almost all the dead mosquitoes had their wings folded inwards and some had their wings stretched out horizontally. Shedding of appendages was also observed from 0.50 hour of experimentation.<br>
Example 6: The experiments in this stage were designed to evaluate the effect of essential oils from fresh leaves obtained through diethyl ether solvent extraction in liquid form.<br>
To study the behaviour pattern of the mosquitoes in the Knock and Kill cage, a 10,000ppm (12.5 %w/w) solution of the greenish coloured oil obtained through diethyl ether solvent extraction was prepared in deodorized kerosene and was used for testing the mosquito repellent activity. The liquid was transferred to a bottle and attached to a vaporizing machine, which was placed in position inside the cage. Observations were made for 4 hours. Diethyl ether extract of Blumea lacera showed 85% knock down at the end of half an hour of the mosquitoes interaction with the vapors. Around 63% mortality was observed at the end of 1.00 hour and 100% mortality at the end of 2.00 hours. It was observed that knocked down mosquitoes showed circular movements in the upside down position. Almost all the dead mosquitoes had their wings folded inwards and some had their wings stretched out horizontally. Shedding of appendages was also observed from 0.50 hour of experimentation.<br>
Example 7: The experiments in this stage were designed to evaluate the effect of essential oils from fresh leaves obtained through diethyl ether solvent extraction in mat form. 7<br><br><br>
To study of the behaviour pattern of the mosquitoes in the Knock and Kill cage, essential oils obtained from the fresh leaves of Blumea by steam distillation and diethyl ether extract was introduced in the cage. Mats were prepared inhouse using 4 rectangular pieces of Whatman filter paper of the dimensions 4cm x 2cm. The 4 pieces of filter paper were secured together by applying staple pins. Then known amount of the extract was applied on the mat and the mat was introduced into the cage with the vaporizer. Observations were made for 4 hours for four different concentrations such as 1000 μL of extract corresponds to 400 mg, 500 μL of extract corresponds to 200 mg, 250 μL of extract corresponds to 100 mg, 100 μL of extract corresponds to  40 mg.<br>
Example 7.1 Knock down effect for 400 mg of diethyl ether extract<br>
Diethyl ether extract of Blumea showed 97% knock down at the end of half an hour of the mosquitoes interaction with the vapors. Around 24% mortality was observed at the end of 2.00 hours and 100% mortality at the end of 4.00 hours. Appendage shedding was observed in all knocked down mosquitoes. Knocked down mosquitoes showed circular movements in the upside down position. Some of the dead mosquitoes had their wings folded inwards while others had it stretched out horizontally.<br>
Example 7.2 Knock down effect for 200mg of diethyl ether extract<br>
Diethyl ether extract of Blumea showed 55% knock down at the end of half an hour of the mosquitoes interaction with the vapors. Around 22% mortality was observed at the end of 3.00 hours and 39% mortality at the end of 4.00 hours. Appendage shedding was observed only in some knocked down mosquitoes. Some of the knocked down mosquitoes showed circular movements in the upside down position. Almost all of the dead mosquitoes had their wings stretched out horizontally.<br>
