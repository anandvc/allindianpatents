SPECIFICITY<br>
Related Applications<br>
[0001]	The present application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional<br>
Patent Application No. 61/188,549, filed on August 11,2008, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/212,812, filed on April 16,2009, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to modified immunoglobulin-binding<br>
proteins, e.g., Staphylococcus protein A, having improved binding specificity for immunoglobulins and methods of making and using the same.<br>
Background<br>
[0003]	Staphylococcal protein A (SpA), is a 42kDa multi-domain protein from<br>
the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. SpA is bound to the bacterial cell wall via its carboxy-terminal cell wall binding region, referred to as the X domain. At the amino-terminal region, it includes five immunoglobulin-binding domains, referred to as E, D, A, B, and C (Sjodhal, Eur JBiochem. Sep;78(2):471-90 (1977); Uhlen et al., J Biol Chem. Feb 10;259(3):1695-702 (1984)). Each of these domains contains approximately 58 amino acid residues, and they share 65-90% amino acid sequence identity. The Z domain of SpA is an engineered analogue of the B domain of SpA and includes an alanine instead of a glycine residue at position 29.<br>
[0004]	SpA based reagents have found a widespread use in the field of<br>
biotechnology, e.g., in affinity chromatography for capture and purification of antibodies as well as in antibody detection methods. At present, SpA-based affinity media probably are the most widely used affinity media for isolation of monoclonal antibodies and their fragments from different samples including cell culture. Accordingly, various matrices comprising protein A-ligands are commercially available including, for example,<br><br>
ProSep®-vA High Capacity, ProSep® vA Ultra and ProSep® UltraPlus (Millipore) and Protein A Sepharose™, MabSelect™, MabSelect Xtra™ and MabSelect SuRe® (GE Healthcare).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0005]	The present invention provides, at least in part, novel and improved SpA<br>
variants which exhibit either decreased or increased binding to a Fab portion of an immunoglobulin compared to the previously known SpA variants, while retaining the ability to bind the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin.<br>
[0006]	In some embodiments, the present invention provides novel and<br>
improved SpA variants which exhibit reduced Fab binding compared to the many commercially available protein-A based reagents which bind Fab, a property which is sometimes undesirable.<br>

domains E, D, A, B and C, the amino acid at position 29 is a glycine, which is replaced<br>
with an amino acid other than alanine or tryptophan. In case of domain Z, the amino acid<br>
at position 29 is an alanine, which is replaced with an amino acid other than glycine or<br>
tryptophan. In a particular embodiment, the glycine at position 29 is replaced with an<br>
amino acid other than alanine, threonine and tryptophan or the alanine at position 29 is<br>
replaced with an amino acid other than glycine, threonine and tryptophan.<br>

I.	Definitions<br>
[0043]	In order that the present disclosure may be more readily understood,<br>
certain terms are first defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed<br>
description.<br>
[0044]	As used herein, the term "immunoglobulin binding protein" refers to an<br>
amino acid sequence variant of "SpA" or "protein A of Staphylococcus aureus"<br>
comprising one or more modified domains of SpA {e.g., one or more of modified E, D,<br>
A,	B, C or Z) which exhibit reduced binding to a Fab portion of an immunoglobulin or Ig<br>
molecule relative to the wild-type SpA (wtSpA) or a known variant domain of SpA {e.g.,<br>
Z domain). In some embodiments, an immunoglobulin binding protein of the present<br>
invention comprises one or more modified domains E, D, A, B, C or Z, where each<br>
domain includes an amino acid substitution at position 29. In the case of domains E, D,<br>

tryptophan and in the case of the Z domain, the alanine at position 29 is replaced with an<br>
amino acid other than glycine or tryptophan. In some embodiments, the glycine at<br>
position 29 is replaced with an amino acid other than alanine, threonine and tryptophan<br>
and the alanine at position 29 is replaced with an amino acid other than glycine, threonine<br>
and tryptophan. In some embodiments, amino acid sequence variants may differ from the<br><br>
parent amino acid sequence from which they are derived, in the substitution, deletion and/or insertion of one or more amino acids anywhere within the parent amino acid sequence and including an amino acid residue substitution at least at position 29. In some embodiments, amino acid sequence variants will possess at least about 70%, or at least about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 96%, or at least about 97%, or at least about 98% identity with the parent sequence (i.e. wt SpA domains or Z domain), where such variants bind the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin, however, exhibit reduced binding to a Fab portion of the immunoglobulin relative to an SpA amino acid sequence which includes a glycine or an alanine at position 29.<br>
[0045]	In an alternative embodiment, the glycine or alanine at position 29 is<br>
replaced with a threonine or a tryptophan, where the immunoglobulin-binding protein binds the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin and exhibits increased binding to a Fab portion of the immunoglobulin relative to an SpA amino acid sequence which includes an alanine at position 29.<br>
[0046]	The term "sequence identity" means that two nucleotide or amino acid<br>
sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 70% sequence identity, or at least 80% sequence identity, or at least 85% sequence identity, or at least 90% sequence identity, or at least 95% sequence identity or more. For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence (e.g., parent sequence), to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.<br>
[0047]	Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g.,<br>
by the local homology algorithm of Smith &amp; Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman &amp; Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson &amp; Lipman, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP,<br><br>
BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by visual inspection (see generally Ausubel et ah, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology). One example of algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm, which is described in Altschul et al, J. Mol Biol. 215:403 (1990). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (publicly accessible through the National Institutes of Health NCBI internet server). Typically, default program parameters can be used to perform the sequence comparison, although customized parameters can also be used. For amino acid sequences, the BLAST program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff &amp; Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 (1989)).<br>

an immunoglobulin or antibody that binds an antigen or competes with intact antibody<br>
(i.e., with the intact antibody from which they were derived) for antigen binding (i.e.,<br>

immunoglobulin binding protein which exhibits increased Fab binding relative to an<br>
immunoglobulin binding protein including an alanine at position 29, includes a threonine<br>
or a tryptophan at position 29. Binding to an immunoglobulin molecule can be detected<br>
using well known techniques including those described herein and including but not<br>
limited to, for example, affinity chromatography and surface plasmon resonance analysis.<br>

technique which separates the analyte {e.g., an immunoglobulin) to be measured from<br>
other molecules in the mixture and allows it to be isolated.<br>
[0068]	The term "affinity chromatography," as used herein, refers to a mode of<br>
chromatography where the analyte to be separated is isolated by its interaction with a<br>

II.	SpA Structure and Immunoglobulin Binding Sites<br>
[0069]	SpA is about a 42-kDa protein derived from the bacterium<br>
Staphylococcus aureus and contains five tandem highly homologous extracellular<br>
immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding domains at the N-terminus, designated E, D, A, B and C.<br>
Each extracellular domain of SpA possesses distinct Ig-binding sites. One site is for<br>
Fey (the constant region of IgG class of Ig) and the other is for the Fab portion of certain<br>
Ig molecules (the portion of the Ig that is responsible for antigen recognition). It has<br>
been reported that each of the domains contains a Fab binding site. The non-Ig binding<br>
portion of SpA is located at the C-terminus and is designated the X region or X-domain.<br>
[0070]	The cloning of the gene encoding SpA is described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,151,350, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
III.	Generation and Expression of SpA Variants<br>
[0071]	The SpA variants of the present invention can be made using any<br>
suitable methods known in the art. For example, standard techniques for site-directed mutagenesis of nucleic acids may be used such as those described, for example, in the laboratory manual entitled Molecular Cloning by Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis.<br><br>
Additionally, standard molecular biology techniques involving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis may be used.<br>
[0072]	In some embodiments, SpA variants are generated using standard<br>
genetic engineering techniques. For example, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a domain of SpA or portions thereof can be cloned into a suitable vector for expression in an appropriate host cell. Suitable expression vectors are well known in the art and typically include the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the variant SpA coding sequence.<br>
[0073]	SpA variants described herein may also be synthesized chemically from<br>
amino acid precursors for fragments using methods well known in the art, including solid phase peptide synthetic methods such as the Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonyl) or Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxy carbonyl) approaches (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,060,596; 4,879,378; 5,198,531; 5,240,680).<br>
[0074]	Expression of SpA variants can be accomplished in cells from<br>
eukaryotic hosts such as yeasts, insects or mammals, or in prokaryotic host cells, e.g., bacteria such as E. coli.<br>
[0075]	In some embodiments, SpA variants may be expressed on the surface of<br>
a bacteriophage such that each phage contains a DNA sequence that codes for an individual SpA variant displayed on the phage surface. In this approach, a library of SpA variants are made by synthesizing random or semi random oligonucleotides at selected positions in the SpA sequence chosen to generate a variety of amino acids at these positions. The encoding DNA is inserted into an appropriate phage vector, packaged into a phage particle and used to infect a suitable bacterial host. Each of the sequences is thus cloned in one phage vector and the SpA variant of interest {e.g., having a mutation at position 29) can be selected by finding those phage that bind to Fc but do not bind to Fab (e.g., by a method known as panning). The phages recovered in this way can be amplified and the selection repeated. Also, the phages can be isolated and the nucleotide sequence encoding selected SpA variants determined by nucleotide sequencing.<br><br>
IV.	Binding of SpA variants to Fc and Fab<br>
[0076]	Following generation of the SpA variants, the binding specificity of the<br>
SpA variants to Fab or Fc portions of an immunoglobulin is determined using standard<br>
techniques in the art and those described herein.<br>
[0077]	For example, the SpA variant may be constructed with a histidine tag<br>
((His)6-tag) for immobilization by nickel affinity chromatography. The nickel-bound<br>
SpA can then be tested for Fc and Fab binding by adding appropriate fragments to the<br>
resin. Unbound material is washed away, and Fc and Fab are detected in the elution<br>
sample by gel electrophoresis.<br>
[0078]	Alternatively, Fc and Fab binding can be measured by surface plasmon<br>
resonance analysis. The SpA variant is immobilized on a chip using amine-reactive<br>
chemistry, and Fc or Fab fragment is flowed over the chip. If Fc or Fab binds, an<br>
increase in the surface plasmon resonance signal is observed.<br>
[0079]	SpA can also be immobilized on chromatography beads. Fc or Fab<br>
binding is observed by comparing the flow-through and elution peaks for the SpA resin.<br>
V.	Use of SpA and Variants thereof for Making Chromatography Matrices<br>
[0080]	The present invention also provides a method of preparing a<br>
chromatography matrix comprising at least one immunoglobulin-binding protein with affinity for the Fc part of an antibody and having reduced or no affinity for the Fab portion of the antibody.  In one embodiment, such a method comprises: (a) providing a nucleic acid sequence encoding an isolated SpA domain (e.g., E, D, A, B, C or Z); (b) mutating the nucleic acid sequence to encode for a variant protein where at least the glycine at position 29 has been replaced by an amino acid other than alanine or tryptophan; (c) expressing the variant protein in a host cell (e.g., a suitable prokaryotic cell or a eukaryotic cell); (d) recovering the variant protein from the host cell; and (e) coupling the variant protein to a solid support.<br>
[0081]	Solid support matrices include, but are not limited to, controlled pore<br>
glass, agarose, methacrylate, and polystyrene. The protein can be coupled to the matrix, for example, by amine reactive or thiol reactive chemistry.<br><br>

should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the Figures, are incorporated herein by reference.<br>

provided in vector pJ56:8620. The parent vector pJ56 confers resistance to ampicillin,<br>
kanamycin, chloramphenicol and gentamicin. Appropriate restriction enzyme sites for<br>
the subsequent cloning of the gene into expression vectors are introduced into the gene at<br>
both 5' and 3' ends. A plasmid map of the vector is shown in Figure 5.<br>
[0084]	Glycine at position 29 is mutated to each of the 19 other amino acids by<br>
PCR-based methods using the Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).

The mutagenic primer has the sequence: 5'(P)GAAGAACAACGCAACNNNTTCATTCAGA (SEQ ID NO:19) where NNN represents the three bases encoding the amino acid at position 29. The non-mutagenic primer has the sequence 5'(P)GTTCAGGTTCGGCAGATGCAGGAT (SEQ ID NO:20). PCR is performed in 50 uL reactions containing dNTPs (0.2 mM each), 0.5 mM of each primer, 10 pg template plasmid, and 1 U of Phusion enzyme.

England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) to reduce wild type background. To each 50 µL PCR reaction, about 1µLof Dpnl enzyme is added and the samples are incubated for about one hour at 37 °C.<br>
[0086]	E. coli NEB5a competent cells (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA)<br>
are transformed with 2 µL of the -Dpni-treated PCR reaction. Cells are thawed on ice, and 2 uL of the PCR reaction is added to 25 uL of cells. Following about a 30-minute incubation on ice, cells are heat shocked for 30 seconds at about 42 °C. Cells are allowed to recover for about 5 minutes on ice, and then 125 µL of SOC media (New England BioLabs) is added. Cells are incubated for about one hour at 37 °C, and then 100 µL are plated on LB plates (Northeast Laboratory Services, Winslow, ME) containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin and grown overnight at about 37 °C. In order to obtain purified DNA, individual colonies are picked for overnight culture in LB containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin. DNA is purified using spin mini-prep kits from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Primer pJR (5' GAATATGGCTCATAACACCCCTTG) (SEQ ID NO:21) is used for sequencing the mini-prepped DNA to confirm the identity of each clone (MWG Biotech, Huntsville AL).<br>
[0087]	Following sequence confirmation of the various clones, the gene for<br>
each SpA variant is subcloned into a plasmid for expression of the variant in bacterial cells. Plasmid is digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), and the insert is gel purified on 1% agarose Reliant FastLane gels (Lonza Inc., Allendale, NJ). The relevant band is cut out of the gel and purified using the gel extraction kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The purified insert is ligated into the backbone of a suitable expression vector using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The resulting plasmid is used to transform E. coli NEB5a competent cells as described above.<br><br>
Example 2:    Expression and Purification of Protein A Variants<br>
[0088]	Any suitable bacterial expression system can be used for expressing the<br>
various SpA variants. For example, the protein may be expressed in Eschercia coli such as strain BL21(DE3) (Promega, Madison WI) from a pET vector such as pETl la (Novagen, Madison WI). A single colony is picked from a plate and grown overnight at about 37 °C in LB media containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin. The overnight culture is diluted 100-fold into fresh LB media containing 100 ng/mL ampicillin and grown to a cell density such that the optical density at 600 nm is ~0.8. Following the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, cells are grown for an additional two hours. Expression is confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and Western blotting. An exemplary protein A western blot is shown in Figure 8, which shows that protein A expression from vector PETl la:8620 in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells is detected using a chicken IgY anti-protein A antibody.<br>
[0089]	Cells are harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 minutes) and<br>
resuspended in 3 mL of phosphate buffered saline containing 20 mM imidazole. Cells are lysed by sonication, and cell debris is pelleted by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 4 °C, 30 minutes). SpA variants are purified using NiNTA spin columns (Qiagen), applying 400 uL cell lysate per spin column. Columns are washed with 2x600 uL phosphate buffered saline containing 20 mM imidazole, and SpA is eluted in 2x200 uL phosphate buffered saline containing 200 mM imidazole. SpA is dialyzed overnight into PBS. Protein concentration is confirmed using the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) relative to a standard curve prepared with bovine serum albumin.<br>
Example 3:    Binding of SpA Variants to Fc and Fab Fragments<br>
[0090]	Each SpA variant is subsequently tested for the ability to bind Fc and<br>
Fab using NiNTA agarose resin (Qiagen). Fc and F(ab)2 fragments are obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Each SpA variant is diluted to a concentration of 0.11 mg/mL, Fc is diluted to a concentration of 0.44 mg/mL and F(ab)2 is diluted to a concentration of 0.92 mg/mL, in phosphate buffered saline containing 20 mM imidazole. The NiNTA agarose resin is resuspended and about 20 µl of the resin<br><br>
slurry is pipetted into a 0.5 ml microfuge tube. The resin is subsequently pelleted and the<br>
supernatant is discarded. The resin is washed with about 100 µl PBS with 20 mM<br>
imidazole, incubated at room temperature for about 15 mins and pelleted again. The<br>
supernatent is discarded. About 250 µlof each SpA variant at 0.1 lmg/ml or PBS control<br>
is loaded onto the resin column in duplicates and incubated for about 30 mins at room<br>
temperature. The resin is pelleted and the supernatant is saved for analysis. The pellet is<br>
washed three times with 100 µl of PBS plus 20 mM imidazole each time, incubated for 5<br>
mins and pelleted again. The supernatant is discarded. About 100 µlof Fc or F(ab)2 is<br>
tested for binding with each of the SpA variants or the PBS control by incubating with<br>
the resin for about 30 mins. The resin is subsequently pelleted and the supernatant is<br>
saved for analysis. The resin is washed again three times with about 100 ul of PBS plus<br>
20 mM imidazole each time, incubated for 5 mins and pelleted. The supernatant is<br>
discarded this time. The bound fraction is eluted with about 100 ul of PBS plus 20 mM<br>
imidazole, incubated for about 15 mins and pelleted. The supernatant is saved for further<br>
analysis. The samples are subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4-15% gradient gels<br>
purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, as depicted in Figures 9-12.<br>
[0091 ]	The binding of five protein A variants to Fc and F(ab)2 is tested by<br>
surface plasmon resonance biosensor analysis. All experiments are carried out in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.005% Tween-20. Protein A variants are immobilized on ProteOn GLC sensor chip (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) via amine chemistry, with coupling to a level of 500 RU. Three fold-dilution series of Fc and F(ab)2 fragments (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) are prepared, with protein concentrations ranging from 45 nM to 185 pM, and each concentration is analyzed in duplicate. Each concentration of Fc or F(ab)2 is injected for 250 seconds, followed by 3.5 hours of PBS to measure dissociation rates. Data are fit to a heterogeneous two-site model in order to obtain on- and off-rates (kon and koff). As depicted in Figures 13A-13E, the wild type glycine 29 protein, and each of G29A, G29R, G29K and G29L bind Fc. Figures 14A-14E show that the wild type G29 is observed to bind Fab, and G29A shows weak but detectable F(ab)2 binding. No F(ab)2 binding is seen for G29R, G29K or G29L.<br><br>
[0092]	Fc and Fab binding are also evaluated following immobilization of the<br>
SpA variants on chromatography resins. Controlled pore glass beads (50 mL each, mean particle size of 60 |im, mean pore diameter of 800A) are functionalized with Protein A or Protein A variant according to the method for coupling Protein A to a solid support described in International PCT Application No. WO 90/09237, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herewin. After ligand coupling, the samples are washed three times with 150 mL volume of each (in order): 0.1M Tris with 0.15M NaCl, pH 8 followed by 0.05M Acetic Acid. Afterwards, the samples are equilibrated and stored in PBS with azide.<br>
[0093]	Controlled pore glass affinity resins immobilized with the corresponding<br>
ligand are packed in a 6.6 mm id x 70 mm L OmniFit columns. Buffers used in the experiment are: (A) 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2; and (B) 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 2, and the flow rate is 1.2 mL/min.   After the column is equilibrated in the starting buffer A, 100 µL of F(ab)2 or Fc at 1-2 mg/mL (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) in buffer A is injected into the column. After 10 column volume (CV) of buffer A, buffer B is mixed in over 20 CV in a linear gradient. Ten more column volumes of Buffer B run through the column before the column was regenerated by 2 CV of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. As depicted in Figures 15A and 15B, the wild type glycine 29 protein as well as each of G29A, G29R, G29K and G29L bind Fc. The wild type G29 is observed to bind Fab, and G29A shows weak but detectable F(ab)2 binding. No F(ab)2 binding is seen for G29R, G29K or G29L.<br>
[0094]	In another exemplary experiment, a full set of protein A variants are<br>
tested for Fc and Fab binding by capturing them on NiNTA agarose resin (Qiagen). Briefly, His-tagged protein A variants having an amino acid substitution at position 29 of the wtSpA are added in excess to the resin, the resin is washed with PBS containing 20 mM imidazole followed by the addition of Fc or Fab portion of an immunoglobulin.   The resin is washed again with PBS containing 20 mM imidazole followed by elution of SpA and IgG fragments with PBS containing 200 mM imidazole. The resulting elution fractions are analysed on a 4-20% gradient gel (BioRad) followed by Commassie blue staining (Pierce). Resin with no protein A is used as a negative control. The results of an exemplary experiment are summarized below in Table III. While no apparent difference<br><br>
in Fc binding is observed among the different variants, the Fab binding is markedly reduced for most of the variants. Most of the variants exhibit Fab binding that is less than 15%) compared to wild type. Residual Fab binding of 24% or greater is observed for three of the variants (G29A, G29T, and G29W).
