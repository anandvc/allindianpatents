CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S.<br>
Provisional Application No. 60/524,619 filed on November 25, 2003 to Daryl<br>
S. Hamilton and entitled "Methods and Systems for Tracking Delivery Items,"<br>
which is fully incorporated by reference herein, in its entirety and for all<br>
purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The invention relates to the field of delivery services, and<br>
more specifically, systems and methods for tracking delivery items.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003] Mail delivery services routinely track mail to ensure its<br>
efficient processing. This tracking may be at various stages, levels or<br>
. quantities within the mail processing system. For example, this tracking may<br>
involve individually mailed items, trays of mailed items or larger transportation<br>
containers. These transportation containers can include, for example, the<br>
General Purpose Mail Container (GPMC), the Eastern Region Mail Container<br>
(ERMC), the All Purpose Container (APC), and the like. One concept used in<br>
tracking is the idea of "nesting" mailed items, trays or containers to<br>
aggregates at various levels (i.e., letters-to-trays, trays-to containers,<br>
containers-to-transportation). This nesting strategy allows items to be<br>
grouped and tracked at a macro level, while still being able to track at the<br>
micro level. This simultaneous tracking at both the macro and micro levels is<br>
possible through the conventional concepts of inheritance, aggregation and<br>
association.<br>
[0004] Initiatives used, for example, by the United States Postal<br>
Service ("USPS") give customers, such as major mailers, the ability to track at<br>
the lowest aggregate level, i.e., individual mail piece. Other programs might<br><br>
track, for example, trays, bundles of trays (or flats), sacks, pallets or<br>
containers prepared by large mailers with the nesting information provided by<br>
mailers through electronic manifests. Additional programs might be capable<br>
of creating electronic manifests for containers at Terminal Handling Sites<br>
("THS") by scanning trays and sacks as they are loaded into air transportation<br>
containers.<br>
[0005] As more key infrastructure components are put into place,<br>
such as having the ability to uniquely identify trays, flats and containers of<br>
mail via programs such as, for example, the Enhanced Tray Label and the<br>
Mail Transport Equipment Labeler programs, there is a growing need to<br>
expand the tracking and nesting of delivery items including the nesting of<br>
trays into transport containers (e.g., GPMC, ERMC, APC, etc.), transport<br>
containers into transportation vehicle (e.g., planes, vans, trucks, trains, ships,<br>
etc.), and so on.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods and<br>
systems for tracking the nesting of delivery items.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] In accordance with the invention, methods and systems are<br>
provided comprising a method for tracking the nesting of delivery items that<br>
includes transmitting information identifying a first container in response to a<br>
trigger indicative of the first container being moved by a handler, transmitting<br>
information identifying a second container in response to a trigger indicative of<br>
the handler placing the first container into the second container, and<br>
associating the information identifying the second container with the<br>
information identifying the first container.<br>
[0008] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] The present invention will now be described in detail with<br>
reference to the drawings, which are provided as illustrative examples of the<br>
invention so as to help enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention.<br>
Notably, the figures and examples below are not meant to limit the scope of<br>
the present invention. Where appropriate, the same reference numbers will<br>
be used throughout this detailed description in conjunction with the drawings<br>
to refer to the same or like parts. Where certain elements of the present<br>

Further, the present invention encompasses present and future known<br>
equivalents to the components referred to herein by way of illustration.<br><br><br>
[0015] Figure 1 illustrates a conceptual diagram of a delivery center<br>
100, in accordance with methods and systems consistent with embodiments<br>
of the invention. The conceptual diagram of Figure 1 is exemplary only and is<br>
not meant to limit the invention; any one of numerous such delivery centers is<br>
capable of supporting embodiments of the invention. As illustrated, a mail<br>
handler 102 can place trays 104 on a conveyor system 106. It is<br>
contemplated for some embodiments of the invention that mail handler 102<br>
can be human, automated robotic handlers or any form of transport means.<br>
As used herein, a tray 104 is a container used to hold delivery items, such as,<br>
for example, letters, packages, mail flats, and the like. These trays 104 may<br>
include a label 108 identifying the tray 104. The label 108 can be, for<br>
example, a 24-digit Code 128 UCC/EAN barcode label, as specified, for<br>
example, by any one of many Enhanced Tray Label specifications. Conveyor<br>
system 106 may be, for example, a gravity-driven or motorized conveyor or<br>
set of conveyors, such as the type typically found in postal sorting or<br>
distribution operations. Conveyor system 106 may also vary in length, size<br>
and shape and may include a tray stopping mechanism at the end of the<br>
conveyer.<br>
[0016] Conveyor system 106 can transport trays 104 to the end of<br>
conveyor system 106 where, for example, it reaches a fixed barcode scanner<br>
110. This scanner 110 may be any suitable scanner for scanning label 108,<br>
such as, for example, a stationary UCC barcode scanner. Scanner 110 may<br>
have a Radio Frequency (RF) tag 112 attached to it that may be, for example,<br>
a Read Only or Read/Write RF tag, such as those used in Radio Frequency<br>
Identification (RFID) systems and commercially available from, for example,<br>
Identec Solutions of Austria. Although, embodiments of the invention are<br>
discussed with regard to RFID systems, it should be understood that other<br>
types of wireless systems or passive / active auto detection strategies may be<br>
used, such as, for example active radio tags, optical tags, and the like.<br>
[0017] Scanner 110 may be connected to an application server 124.<br>
This application server 124 may be any appropriate type of computer or<br>
handheld device functioning under any operating system. Application server<br>
124 may store information regarding tray labels, RFID tag identifications, and<br><br><br>
other related RF tag data, as well as information regarding RF interrogators.<br>
An RF interrogator can be any suitable device for reading information from<br>
RFID tags. This application server 124 may also be connected to a database<br>
126 for retrieving and storing information. This connection may be, for<br>
example, via any wired or wireless network, such as, for example, an internal<br>
USPS network.<br>
[0018] Mail handlers 114 may be positioned at the end of conveyor<br>
system 106. These mail handlers 114 may be individuals who receive trays<br>
104 from the end of conveyor system 106 and move them to the proper<br>
transport container 116. It is contemplated for some embodiments of the<br>
invention that mail handlers 114 can be human, automated robotic handlers or<br>
any form of transport means.<br>
[0019] As used herein, a transport container is any type of mail<br>
transport equipment for use in moving mail within a delivery center 100 or<br>
between delivery centers, such as, for example, railroad containers, bulk mail<br>
center over-the-road (BMC-OTR) containers (BMC Heavy), BMC in-house<br>
containers (BMC light), CON-CON containers, Eastern Region Mail<br>
Containers (ERMC) without shelves, ERMC with shelves, orange ERMC<br>
(plastic), General Purpose Mail Container (GPMC), wire containers and the<br>
like.<br>
[0020] Transport containers 116 may be equipped with unique RFID<br>
+ Presence Detection (RFID+PD) tags 128 for sending an identifier capable of<br>
identifying transport container 116 in response to detecting a RFID<br>
interrogator 120 within its range. These RFID+PD tags 128 may be, for<br>
example, commercially available RFID+PD tags, such as those commercially<br>
available from Identec Solutions of Lustenau, Austria. Additionally, although<br>
embodiments herein are discussed with regard to RFID+PD tags, it should be<br>
understood that in other embodiments RFID tags, PD tags, RF tags, or other<br>
suitable wireless devices may be used.<br>
[0021] Mail handlers 114 may be equipped with a portable<br>
communication device 118, such as a wireless personal data assistant (PDA)<br>
or other suitable wired or wireless portable device. This portable<br><br><br>
communication device 118 may be, for example, a PocketPC™ or Palm™<br>
computing type device and may, for example, use a wireless protocol, such as<br>
IEEE 802.11,802.16 or other such wireless protocol. This portable<br>
communication device 118 may also include a Radio Frequency (RF)<br>
interrogator 120 that can trigger the identifying RF, RFID, PD, or RFID+PD<br>
tags to respond with a modulated RF message. For example, portable<br>
communication device 118 may be a pocket PC such as 2x PPT2846<br>
PocketPCs (PPC) from Symbol Technologies, Inc. of Holksville, NY. Device<br>
118 may also include, for example, a PCMCIA slot or be placed in a PCMCIA<br>
sled. Also, RFID interrogators 120, such as, for example, two i-Card<br>
interrogators equipped with a "logical pyramid" algorithm commercially<br>
available from Identec Solutions may be inserted into device 118 via a<br>
PCMCIA connection.<br>
[0022] The exemplary "logical pyramid" algorithm can determine the<br>
exact container into which a handler places a tray 104. The algorithm<br>
combines various metrics in making this determination, such as, for example:<br>
the presence detection device producing a particular reading, the RF tag<br>
returning a threshold response, the dB level of the RF tag broadcast, and the<br>
like. The triggering event in this example can be the RFID+PD 128 reporting<br>
a presence within the container.<br>
[0023] Additionally, delivery center 100 may include a wireless<br>
transceiver 122 connected to application server 124 for communicating<br>
wirelessly with mail handlers' portable communication devices 118. This<br>
wireless transceiver 122 may use the same wireless protocol as portable<br>
communication device 118, such as, for example, an IEEE 802.11 protocol,<br>
so as to provide portable communication device 118 with wireless connectivity<br>
to application server 124. However, a wired communication protocol can also<br>
work with embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0024] Once a transport container 116 becomes full, it may be<br>
electronically and physically closed. After which, it may be moved through a<br>
"choke point" to a separate area of delivery center 100. A choke point, for<br>
example, is a location within the delivery center 100 through which transport<br>
container's moving to a particular location must pass for identifying the<br><br><br>
containers 116 passing through the choke point. The choke point may include<br>
an RF interrogator 130 for reading the transport container's RFID+PD tag 128.<br>
RF interrogator 130 may be connected to application server 124 for<br>
transferring information regarding the containers 116 (or, more particularly,<br>
the RFID+PD tags 128 connected to the containers 116) that pass through the<br>
choke point.<br>
[0025] Figure 2 illustrates a flow chart of a method for automatically<br>
tracking the nesting of delivery items, in accordance with methods and<br>
systems consistent with embodiments of the invention. Figure 2 will be<br>
described in reference to Figure 1. A mail handler 102 first loads trays 104<br>
arriving at delivery center 100 onto conveyor system 106 (S202). In one<br>
embodiment, the trays 104 may be loaded onto the conveyor system 106 one<br>
at a time to singulate the handling of each unit load tray. Once the trays<br>
reach the end of conveyor system 106, scanner 110 can automatically scan<br>
the tray's label 108 (S204). As discussed above, in this example, label 108<br>
can uniquely identify tray 104, and may be, for example, a 24-digit Code 128<br>
UCC/EAN barcode label, as specified by, for example, Enhanced Tray Label<br>
specifications.<br>
[0026] Barcode scanner 110 may then associate a unique,<br>
programmed RF tag 122 identifier for the scanning station (hereinafter, the<br>
scanning station ID) with the information from the uniquely identified scanned<br>
label 108 from tray 104 (hereinafter tray ID) (S206). In one example,<br>
conveyor system 106 may also stop until the tray 104 that has just been<br>
scanned is removed.<br>
[0027] A mail handler 114, such as, for example, a postal center<br>
employee, may then obtain the scanned tray 104 (S208). The mail handler's<br>
RF interrogator 120, in response to coming within range of RF tag 122 may<br>
trigger RF tag 122 to send scanning station ID and tray ID to RF interrogator<br>
120 for future confirmation that the tray will be placed in the correct container<br>
116 based upon a logical nesting of trays to a container (S210). As discussed<br>
above, mail handler 114 may have a portable communication device 118,<br>
such as a PocketPC (PPC) device, that incorporates a passive RFID<br>
interrogator 120 as well as wireless connectivity with application server 124.<br><br><br>
[0028] Portable communication device 118 may then send the<br>
information received from RF tag 122 to application/database server 124 via<br>
wireless transceiver 122 informing application/database server 124 that mail<br>
handler 114 picked up tray 104. (S212). For example, portable<br>
communication device 118 may send application/database server 124<br>
information identifying mail handler's RFID interrogator 120 (hereinafter RFID<br>
interrogator ID) along with the RFID information received from scanner's RFID<br>
tag 112 that includes the tray ID and the scanning station ID.<br>
[0029] Mail handler 114 may then carry tray 104 to the appropriate<br>
transport container 116 (S214). In this example, although mail handler's RF<br>
interrogator 120 may detect numerous signals from various transport<br>
container RFID+PD tags 128 as the mail handler 114 passes, RF interrogator<br>
120 ignores these signals until it receives a signal from RFID+PD tag 128 of<br>
the appropriate transport container 116. RF interrogator 120 may determine<br>
the appropriate container by executing a "logical nesting" pyramid algorithm<br>
that determines the transport container 116 into which mail handler 114<br>
placed tray 104. This nesting / pyramid algorithm can include, for example, a<br>
combination of the presence detection device and assumed nesting<br>
associations to produce and trigger the events that will confirm and record the<br>
proper placement of the uniquely identified tray into the uniquely identified<br>
larger container.<br>
[0030] Mail handler 114 can then place the tray 104 into transport<br>
container 116 (S216). Portable communication device 118 may then, in<br>
response to RFID+PD tag 128 reporting the presence of the tray within the<br>
container, send information to application server 124 informing application<br>
server 124 that mail handler 114 has placed tray 104 in transport container<br>
116(S218).<br>
[0031] Additionally, the "logical nesting" pyramid algorithm, in<br>
conjunction with a physical indicator (e.g., light, sound, vibration, etc.) that<br>
may be located, for example, on transport container's RFID+PD tag 128 tag,<br>
may also act as a physical guide to inform mail handler 114 whether tray 104<br>
was placed into the correct container 116 (S220). For example, a visible<br>
indicator (e.g., LED, etc.) may turn red to indicate that it is the incorrect<br><br><br>
container, or it may turn green to indicate it is the correct container. Further,<br>
portable communication device 118 may maintain communications with<br>
application server 124 (e.g., via a 802.11b wireless card built into the portable<br>
communication device 118), not only updating progression data and<br>
identification information, but also real-time error checking of tray 104<br>
containerization against the stored database information on nested unit loads.<br>
[0032] Once transport container 116 is filled to capacity (S222),<br>
container 116 can be electronically and physically closed and may then be<br>
moved through a choke point with a stationary RF Interrogator 130 to a<br>
separate area, such as, for example, through a dock door to a docking area<br>
for shipment of container 116 to a different delivery center (S224). This<br>
stationary RF Interrogator 130 should be the same as, but may also differ<br>
from, RF Interrogator 120 of portable communication device 118 by, for<br>
example, using a simpler logical pyramid that is only concerned with reading<br>
all RFID tags within a certain range. If transport container 116 is not at<br>
capacity, it may continue to be loaded with unit-loaded trays 104 (S226).<br>
[0033] In another embodiment, each transport container 116 may<br>
also have a paper based barcode placard associated with it that provides a<br>
visual unique identification of its contents (e.g., type of mail, zip code and final<br>
destination, etc.). These placards may be applied before any tray loading<br>
occurs (thus giving the mail handler visual indication of where to put the<br>
trays). When a mail handler initially sets up the area holding transport<br>
containers 116 (hereinafter referred to as the bullpen area), they may<br>
associate a unique placard barcode ID with the barcode on transport<br>
container's RFID+PD tag 128 and provide this information to application<br>
server 124. Then, when mail handler 114 loads trays 104 into transport<br>
container 116, application server 124 may associate tray 104 with the<br>
information on the transport container's placard (e.g., contents of container,<br>
destination, etc.). This association may also occur as a container is filled,<br>
taken away, and a new container is put in and set up in order to track the<br>
movement of containers 116 and individual trays 104.<br>
[0034] The overall operational strategy according to embodiments<br>
of the invention can include data that is collected, passed through a variety of<br><br><br>
decision-making steps at one or more levels (e.g., the logical pyramid level,<br>
the backend business systems level, etc.), and a final answer/association that<br>
can be written into one or more local or networked databases. Figure 3<br>
illustrates an exemplary operational flow diagram, in accordance with<br>
methods and systems consistent with embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0035] As shown in Figure 3, raw data can be collected at a base<br>
level 310 from multiple sources, such as, for example, a conveyor system's<br>
stationary barcode scanner 312 or a handler's handheld device 314. At this<br>
base level 310, stationary scanner 312 and handheld device 314 can be<br>
mutually exclusive and have no dependence on each other. Event trigger and<br>
control data associate with the raw data from handheld 314 can be forwarded<br>
directly to the business logic module 324, while all raw data from the<br>
stationary barcode scanner 312 can be forwarded directly to the business<br>
logic module 322.<br>
[0036] The raw data received from handheld 314, that is, the user<br>
ID associated with the handheld and the RF tags (e.g., on the tray, container,<br>
etc.) that handheld has 'seen,' can then be pushed 330 through a logical<br>
resolution module 340 for the tag data. The tag resolution can be completed<br>
using a series of logical algorithms that can be capable of correlating a user<br>
ID (e.g., handheld ID) to a tag ID (e.g., container) into which a handling unit<br>
(e.g., tray, flat, sack, etc.) is being nested. The logical algorithms can be<br>
based upon a characteristic of the passive tracking device (i.e., signal<br>
strength, number of reads from the tag, duration of reads, etc.). This tag<br>
resolution algorithm (TRA) process need not know the identity of the tray at<br>
this level, since its raw data input can be limited to the user ID and the<br>
tray/container ID (i.e., the RFID tag on the tray/container). Once the TRA<br>
process has resolved data of a user ID and tag/container ID, it then pushes<br>
350 the correlated or resolved data to the business logic level 360, which can<br>
operate, for example, on a backend server.<br>
[0037] The business logic module 360 is where the full associations<br>
among the users, trays and containers can reside. The backend server and<br>
the business logic can be responsible for gathering the tray data from the<br>
point of generation (e.g., via the enhanced data label and the like) and the<br><br><br>
barcode scanner at the end of the conveyance line, the logical TRA process<br>
(e.g., which user saw which tray and into which container each tray was<br>
placed), the RFID tag with pressure switch at the end of the conveyance line,<br>
and other similar data.<br>
[0038] An enhanced distribution label (EDL) in the context of<br>
embodiments of the invention can uniquely identify each tray or sack. The<br>
common UCC/EAN Code 128 barcode format can be used for the EDL.<br>
However, other formats of unique identification can also be used. The<br>
information contained in the barcode can be include, for example, a<br>
destination postal code, a contents identifier number, some service-related<br>
information, a mail processing code, and the like. This exemplary EDL can<br>
facilitate the ability to track the tray or sack as it leaves an origin point and<br>
when it arrives at a destination. Information in the EDL can also be used to<br>
link individual handling units to specific containers and facilitate container<br>
nesting and tracking throughout the entire distribution and delivery process.<br>
[0039] Through a series of metrics and decision-making programs,<br>
the business logic module 360 can decide and correlate which handler placed<br>
which tray into which container. The backend system can also simultaneously<br>
know whether or not a tray went into the correct container, and if it is not in<br>
the correct container, can notify the user that the tray was incorrectly placed.<br>
Once the backend server and business logic has made the full association of<br>
tray, user and container data, the full association is then pushed 370 to, and<br>
stored in, a database 380. As will be evident to those skilled in the relevant,<br>
art, database 380 can be one or more separate databases that are collocated<br>
or networked with the other elements of this embodiment.<br>
[0040] The backend server application 36Q portion of the invention<br>
can consist of a stand-alone console Java application that can include several<br>
modules, each performing a separate task. There need not be a user<br>
interface to speak of; the console can print messages from the application<br>
modules and respond to simple commands typed into the console. However,<br>
a network based user interface can be added, such as, for example, a<br>
browser enabled graphical user interface. The modules of the backend server<br>
application 360 can include, for example: an EDL importer, a scanner<br><br><br>
interface, a tag event processor, various database scripts, and the like.<br>
[0041] The EDL importer module can run when requested at the<br>
console. It can, for example, read an EDL export file in a specified path and<br>
can create one new 'tray" database record for each EDL line in the export file.<br>
Each 'tray' record can contain all the data associated with an EDL, and can<br>
have additional fields for tracking that unit's status through the system. This<br>
module can exit as soon as the import is complete.<br>
[0042] The scanner interface module can continuous try to read<br>
from the communications connection to the stationary barcode scanner 322<br>
(e.g., an RS-232 serial port cable, an IEEE 801.11b wireless connection, etc.).<br>
When data is received from the scanner, this module can then attempt to find<br>
the corresponding tray ID in the tray database (i.e., from a previously imported<br>
EDL record). The tray record can be modified to show that tray's status is<br>
'scanned.' This module can be started in a new thread and can be execute<br>
continuously until it is stopped.<br>
[0043] The tag event processor module can be used to receive 'tag<br>
events' 324 from the raw data module 310. The tag event processor can use<br>
the database server script(s) to process such received data. 'Tag events' are<br>
any events that occur as the result of the data server scripts, described below.<br>
These can be communicated by placing a record in a 'tag event' table, with<br>
data specific to the type of action (or event) that is being communicated. For<br>
all events, a timestamp can be added to the record. The timestamp can be<br>
used to compare and process a chronological order of events. The types of<br>
events can include, for example: a tray being picked up by a user, a tray being<br>
placed into a container, and the like.	<br>
[0044] In the example of a tray being picked up by a user, the<br>
information received in the 'tag event' record can include can include the user<br>
ID of the user and the tray ID. The user's ID can be set in the 'tray' database,<br>
which can then associate that tray ID to that user ID and can set that tray's<br>
status to 'picked up.' In the example of a tray being placed into a container,<br>
the information received in the 'tag event' record can include the user ID of<br>
the user, the tray ID and the container ID. The 'tray' database can be<br><br><br>
searched to find the tray to which this user is assigned. Then, the container<br>
ID can be placed in that 'tray' record and that tray's status can be set to 'in<br>
container.'<br>
[0045] The various database scripts can be programmed to<br>
manipulate the volumes of data received from the RF tags (via an<br>
interrogator) and save the results to the 'tag event' table for use as described<br>
above. Specifically, in this embodiment, the scripts can perform the following<br>
actions: determine which user picked up a tray when a pressure sensor switch<br>
is opened and determine into which container a user placed a tray.<br>
[0046] The following provides a description of various possibilities<br>
for placement of RFID+PD tags 128 on transport container 116. It should be<br>
understood that the following is merely an illustrative list of possible<br>
placements and is not exhaustive and not intended to be limiting.<br>
[0047] Figure 4 illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary<br>
transport container 116, in accordance with methods and systems consistent<br>
with embodiments of the invention. The exemplary transport container 116<br>
shown in Figure 4 will be used in the below description of exemplary<br>
placements for RFID+PD tag 128. It should be understood that Figure 4 is<br>
simply a generalized figure of a transport container, for use in explaining<br>
possible placements of RFID+PD tags on the transport container, and should<br>
not be used to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
[0048] A first possible location for placement of RFID+PD tags 128<br>
on containers 116 is middle back-wall 402 of container 116. That is,<br>
RFID+PD tag 128 is mounted in the center of the container's back wall (as<br>
faced by the worker), aimed outward (towards the worker). A second possible<br>
location for placement of RFID+PD tag 128 is within container's dividing tray<br>
404, aimed both up and down. This may include, for example, mounting a<br>
single RFID tag with multiple PD sensors or multiple RFID tags each with a<br>
single PD sensor within container's dividing tray 404.<br>
[0049] A third possible location for placement of RFID+PD tag 128<br>
is on the middle top of container 406, aimed downwards. A fourth possibility<br>
is mounting RFID+PD tag 128 on one of side panels 408, aimed towards the<br><br><br>
opposite side panel. A fifth possibility is mounting the RF tag on the floor of<br>
container 410 aimed upwards.<br>
[0050] A sixth possibility is mounting multiple PD sensors with each<br>
'wired' to a single tag that may, for example, look visually like a thin book<br>
mounted on the container where the RFID tag and various PD sensors are<br>
contained. In this example, RFID+PD tags 128 may be mounted such that<br>
sensors are located both above and below metal shelf 404.<br>
[0051] A seventh possibility is to mount multiple RFID+PD tags 128<br>
in a configuration with different PD sensor settings and different mounting<br>
brackets for each container 116. Since some embodiments may include a<br>
large number of containers deployed at thousands of locations with untrained<br>
people, it may be desirable to stock different tag configurations that have<br>
been factory tuned and tested in the same manner as used by home security<br>
motion detector manufacturers using "dog-tolerant" sensors, "heat and motion<br>
activated" sensors, "laser beam and heat" sensors, and the like. In this<br>
example, the sensor can be able to detect the difference between placing a<br>
tray within the containers and closing container front gates.<br>
[0052] An eighth possibility is to "auto-calibrate" a tag by installing,<br>
for example, RFID+PD tag 128 in accordance with detailed installation<br>
instructions for each container 116 and then initiate a calibration mode that<br>
sets the "normal" and "tripped" sensor readings on the actual container.<br>
[0053] The following provides a description of various possibilities<br>
for placement of the antenna for RF interrogator 120 on mail handler 114. It<br>
should be understood that the following is merely an illustrative list of possible<br>
placements and is not exhaustive.<br>
[0054] One possible option is to use a hip-mounted portable<br>
communication device 118 (e.g., PocketPC, Palm, etc.) that includes an<br>
internal RF Interrogator 120 and an internal antenna. A second possibility is<br>
to use a wrist-mounted antenna or an antenna mounted elsewhere on mail<br>
handler 114, connected via a wire to a hip-mounted portable communication<br>
device 118 with an internal RF interrogator 120. A third possibility is to use a<br>
"tool belt" or vest that holds both portable communication device 118 (with an<br><br><br>
internal RF interrogator 120) and an antenna that is 'woven' into the belt or<br>
vest.<br>
[0055] The following provides a description of exemplary methods<br>
for associating the unique label (e.g., barcode) on a tray 104 with the identity<br>
of mail handler 114 (i.e., mail handler's portable communication device 118<br>
and associated RF interrogator 120) who has acquired that tray. Several<br>
examples are provided below using different logic in which each mail handler<br>
114 takes one tray 104 at a time. However, as will be evident to those skilled<br>
in the art after the teaching of this invention, each mail handler 114 can take<br>
more than one tray 104 at a time.<br>
[0056] A first example requires that application server 124 reconcile<br>
the data that is scanned from tray label 108 by stationary scanner 126 with<br>
portable communication device 118 of mail handler 114 who picks up tray<br>
104. This may be accomplished by, for example, associating the last scanned<br>
tray label 108 with the first RF interrogator 120 comes within range of RF tag<br>
112 on stationary scanner 110. A second example is similar to the first<br>
example, but uses a time stamp system rather than a queue system to<br>
reconcile the tray data to the personal interrogator. A third example requires<br>
application/database server 124 to program RF tag 112 of scanner 110 to<br>
broadcast the tray label (barcode) data and reconcile the data using mail<br>
handler's portable communication device 118, rather than reconciling at the<br>
server side.<br>
[0057] Although the present invention has been particularly<br>
described with reference to embodiments thereof, it should be readily<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes,<br>
modifications and substitutes are intended within the form and details thereof,<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it<br>
will be appreciated that in numerous instances some features of the invention<br>
can be employed without a corresponding use of other features. Further,<br>
those skilled in the art will understand that variations can be made in the<br>
number and arrangement of components illustrated in the above figures. It is<br>
intended that the scope of the appended claims include such changes and<br>
modifications.<br><br><br>
