However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. By plants are understood here all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including transgenic plants and including plant varieties which may or may not be protectable by plant variety property rights. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, shoot-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br><br><br>
Le A 33 871-Foreign countries<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their envirorunent, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of propagation materials, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by single- or multi-layer coating.<br>
Depending on the concentration, the active compounds according to the invention are suitable for total weed control, for example on industrial sites and rail tracks and on paths and areas with or without tree growth. Equally, the compounds can be employed for controlling weeds in perennial crops, for example forests, ornamental tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards, banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on lawns and turf and pastures and for selective weed control in armual crops.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have strong herbicidal activity and a broad activity spectrum when applied on the soil and on above-ground parts of plants. To a certain extent, they are also suitable for selective control of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops, both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspo-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic substances impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is to say liquid solvents and/or solid carriers,<br><br><br>
Le A 33 871-Foreign countries<br><br>
optionally with the use of surfactants, that is to say emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents.

Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks, such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite and synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material, such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers, such as carboxymethylcellulose, natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arable, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, and also natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br><br><br><br>

Preparation Examples:<br>
Example 1<br><br>
(Process (a))<br>
0.76 g (2.9 mmol) of 5-ethoxy-4-methyl-2-phenoxycarbonyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one are dissolved in 40 ml of acetonitrile and, at room temperature (about 20°C) admixed a little at a time and with stirring with 0.75 g (3.2 mmol) of 4-methoxycarbonyl-2-methyl-thiophene-3-sulphonamide and 0.49 g (3.2 mmol) of l,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene (DBU). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hours and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is taken up in methylene chloride, washed successively with 1 N hydrochloric acid and water, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under water pump vacuum, the residue is digested with isopropanol and the resulting ciystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction.<br>
This gives 0.70 g (60% of theory) of methyl 4-[[[(3-ethoxy-4,5-dihydro-4-methyl-5-oxo-lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-carbonyl]-amino]-sulphonyl]-5-methyNthiophene-3-carboxylate (alias 5-ethoxy-4-methyl-2-[(4-methoxycarbonyl-2-methyl-thien-3-yl)-sulphonyl-amino-carbonyl]-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one)   of  melting   point 163°C.<br>
Analogously to Example 1, and in accordance with the general description of the preparation processes according to the invention, it is also possible to prepare, for example, the compounds of the general formula (I) listed in Table 1 below.<br><br>

Example (VM)<br><br>
At from 0°C to 5°C, a solution of 19.9 g (0.29 mol) of sodium nitrite in 60 ml of water is added dropwise with stirring to a solution of 42.7 g (0.25 mol) of methyl 3-amino-2-methyl-thiophene-4-carboxylate in 75 ml of 10% strength aqueous hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture is stirred at from 0°C to 5°C for 60 minutes. The excess of nitride is then destroyed using amidosulphonic acid. At from 0°C to S°C, the mixture is then added dropwise with stirring to a solution of 35 g (0.55 mol) of sulphur dioxide in 300 ml of methylene chloride. After addition of 1.5 g of copper(I) chloride and 1.5 g of dodecyl-trimethylammonium bromide, the reaction mixture is stirred at 40°C for 60 minutes and then at 20°C for 12 hours. 18 ml of 35% strength aqueous hydrochloric acid are then added, the mixture is stirred at 20°C for 4 hours and the phases are then separated. The aqueous phase is re-extracted with methylene chloride and the combined organic phases are washed with water, dried with magnesium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under water pump vacuum and the residue is crystallized from hexane.<br>

Step 1<br><br>
Under water pump vacuum, 61 g of a 20% strength solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol (213 mmol of NaOCHj) are evaporated to dryness. The residue is taken up in 80 ml of toluene, and 28.6 g (109 mmol) of ethyl 2-(2-ethoxycarbonyI-ethyithio)-3-methyl-butyrate are then added and the reaction mixture is stirred at from 70°C to 80°C for 12 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture is poured into ice-water and then acidified with cone, hydrochloric acid. The organic phase is then separated off, the aqueous phase is re-extracted with diethyl ether and the organic phases are combined, dried with magnesium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under water pump vacuum and the residue is purified by distillation under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 22.6 g (96% of theory) of ethyl 5-i-propyl-4-oxo-tetrahydrothiophene-3-carboxylate of boiling point 115°C (at 0.5 mbar).<br><br>
