				<td>Device at a card for covering of light fibre waste like<br>
short fibre, dust, fibre fragments, fly and the like<br>
The invention refers to a device at a card for covering of<br>
light fibre waste like short fibre, dust, fibre fragment,<br>
fly and the like which is released in the processing of<br>
fibre materials with a trimmed roller, in which in cross<br>
section of a suction line at least one filter area is<br>
present.<br>
In a known device (DE 3429024) it is provided to measure the<br>
dust- and dirt content of a fibre material. The fibre<br>
material is supplied over a feed device of a release roller,<br>
which shows a dust separation opening with a strainer type<br>
surface, to which a filter unit is connected, which shows in<br>
suction direction one after the other a strainer for short<br>
fibres and fly and a dust filter. As per carried out test<br>
through measurement the arisen amount of dust (at dust<br>
filter) and short fibres (at strainer) can be found out. A<br>
disadvantage exists therein that the degree of opening of<br>
release roller is constant. Besides, it disturbs that<br>
measurement and evaluation take place discontinuously, which<br>
is expensive apparatus wise.<br>
The assignment lies therefore at the base of the invention<br>
to procure a device mentioned at the entry which avoids the<br>
mentioned disadvantages, which makes possible in particular<br>
a continuous determination of fibre damage through carding<br>
at a card.<br>
The solution of this assignment takes place through the<br>
distinguished features of claim 1.<br><br>
Through the measures as per invention, it is possible to<br>
determine the fibre damage of carded fibre material<br>
continuously (on line). A special advantage lies therein<br>
that in a definite carding - over the amount in fibre waste<br>
- the fibre damage determined with measurement values can be<br>
compared for the fibre damage with gentle carding and with<br>
damaging carding and in this way an optimum setting of<br>
carding can take place.<br>
The claims 2 to 26 have advantageous further development of<br>
invention in content.<br>
The invention is explained closer followingly with the help<br>
of an execution example represented diagramitically.<br>

Fig.l Shows a card, as for example Truetzschler high<br>
capacity card DK 903, with feed roller 1, feed<br>
table 2, lickers in 3a, 3b, 3c drum 4, accepter 5,<br>
stripper roller 6, squeeze roller 7, 8, non -woven<br>
fleece guide item 9, pile funnel 10, withdrawal<br>
roller 11, 12, moving cover 13 with cover rods 14,<br>
can 15 and can stock 16. The direction of rotation<br>
of rollers are shown with bent arrows. With M the<br>
middle point (axis) of drum 4 is denoted. 4b gives<br>
the direction of rotation of drum 4. With K the<br>
working direction is given.<br>
As per Figure 2 the non woven fleece guide item 9 as for<br>
example Truetzschler WEBSPEED shows a prefunnel 9a to which a<br>
non woven fleece support item 9b is prelaid. Between the<br>
prefunnel 9a and the pile funnel 10 an air gap is present<br>
through which lighter fibre waste come out, which is sucked<br>
up wards over a suction equipment 9c as for example suction pipe,<br>
hose or the like. The fibre material F is taken out through<br>
the stipper roller 6 by the accepter 5 and turns out over a<br>
guiding item 19 through the roller gap between the squeeze<br>
rollers 7, 8, supported through the non woven fleece support<br>
item 9b in the entry opening of pre funnel 9a, runs through<br>
the pre funnel 9a and enters over the pile funnel through,<br>
from which it is withdrawn through the withdrawal rollers<br>
11, 12 as fibre sliver. At the area above of fibre materials<br>
F between the roller gap of squeeze roller 7,8 and the entry<br>
in the pre funnel 9a a further suction equipment 18, for<br>
example pipe, hose or the like is connected.<br><br>
The measuring equipment 19 for light fibre waste G covers a<br>
close pipe as for example a hose 20, at whose one end a tube<br>
distributing guide 21 with a swinging end valve 22 and ot<br>
other end a suction source, as for example a ventilator 23<br>
are located. The hose 20 is crossed by a filter disc 24,<br>
which is driven rotatably axis parallel to the hose axis<br>
around an axis 36 a by a motor 36. The filter disc 24 shows<br>
a filter medium 25, which allows the entry of suction air,<br>
however would hold back the light fibre waste G on the<br>
filter surface 25 in hose. Through rotation in direction of<br>
arrow C the filter surface gets in corresponding to Fig 30<br>
out of the position 25' in hose 20 in a cleaning position<br>
25" outside of hose 20 opposite to a cleaning equipment 37<br>
as for example suction equipment. In the internal space of<br>
hose 20 before and behind the filter disc 24 in each case a<br>
pressure sensor 37a or rather 37b is present, which<br>
determines over a difference pressure instrument 38 the<br>
difference pressure before and behind the filter surface<br>
25'. The difference pressure measuring instrument 38 is<br>
connected to an electronic control- and regulating equipment<br>
33 (see Fig. 6) in which in a storage the relation between the<br>
difference pressures and the amount of light fibre waste G<br>
located on the filter surface 25' is input. In preset<br>
reference pressure difference the motor 36 sets the filter<br>
disc 24 in motion so that a free filter surface from light<br>
fibre waste 4 gets in the cross section of hose 20. The<br>
further rotation of filter disc 24 can also take place as<br>
per a present reference time, the air flow with the light<br>
fibre waste is denoted with D. The exit of pipe distributing<br>
guide 21 is connected over a pipe 39 to the sucked filter<br>
equipment of the card.<br>
In the Fig. 4a and 4b the shifting of slide way 30 on the<br>
flexible arch 17 in direction of arrow A is represented.<br>
Through the shifting as for example around 50mm the<br>
distance between the cover set and the drum set 4a, that<br><br>
means the distance between the peak circles, is enlarged.<br>
Through it, that the slide way 30 is shifted in direction A,<br>
the cover rods 14 are lifted from the position in direction<br>
E Shown in Fig. 4a in the position shown in Fig. 4b. The<br>
cover rods 14 are moved between the cover deflecting roller<br>
13a and the cover deflecting roller 13b through a drive belt<br>
(not represented), followingly deflected and then led back<br>
again on the opposite side. With r3 the radius of convex<br>
external surface 17a of flexible arch 17, with r4 the radius<br>
of concave internal surface 20b of slide way is denoted. The<br>
cover deflector rollers 13a, 13b circulate in direction of<br>
arrow H or rather I. In the Figure 4a and 4b the<br>
Truetzschler - precision cover setting system PFS is<br>
represented.<br>
As per Fig.5 at the slide way 30 a carry item 26 is brought<br>
up, which is combined with a gear rack 27a in which a<br>
rotatable tooth gear 27b in direction O.P. engages which is<br>
driven by a drive equipment 28, as for example a reversible<br>
motor through which the slide way 30 in direction of arrow<br>
A, B is movable. At the drive equipment 28 a preset<br>
equipment 29 is connected with which a desired narrow<br>
carding gap a3, as for example 3/1000" can be preset<br>
(reference value). The setting can also take place through<br>
an electronic control and regulating equipment 33 (see<br>
Fig.6) with reference value storage and/or input equipment.<br>
In narrower (Smaller)_ carding gap corresponding to the<br>
adjustment as per Fig. 4a a damaging (aggressive) carding<br>
with increased shares at light fibre waste G takes place.<br>
Reverse in wider (larger) carding gap corresponding to the<br>
setting as per fig. 4b a gentle carding takes place with<br>
less shares in light fibre waste G. As Fig. 3c shows a<br>
relation exists between the recording of filter disc 24 with<br>
light fibre waste G and the carding on ground of setting of<br>
carding gap.<br><br>
As per Fig.6 an electronic control- and regulating equipment<br>
33 as for example micro computer is present, at which an<br>
input equipment 34 for the desired carding gap, the drive<br>
equipment 28, the setting 23 for fixing of distance between<br>
the filetting tips of cover rods 14 and the drum set 4a, an<br>
indicator equipment 25, a preset equipment 29 and a<br>
switching element 35 for the motor 36 are connected. The<br>
concepts short fibre content, dust and fibre fragments, that<br>
means lighter fibre waste, are followingly short K5F called.<br>
During the carding the material gentle carding<br>
differentiates from material damaging carding specially the<br>
increased short fibre fly the dust exit and the free<br>
release of fibre fragments at the surrounding of mechanical<br>
loading of non-woven fleece or rather slivers (release of<br>
KSF-parts). These released KSF-parts make out infact only<br>
one part of all KSF-parts in non woven fleeces, the released<br>
share acts however proportional to remaining share in non-<br>
woven fleece or rather in sliver (in constant space- and<br>
material climate). Through it that as per invention the<br>
released KSF-amounts are trapped suction technically, it is<br>
possible to describe the degree of fibre damage or rather<br>
the degree of carding.<br>
The mechanical sliver load of non woven fleece or rather of<br>
sliver appear as per carding process in area of non woven<br>
fleece acceptance. Here specially two places are to be<br>
mentioned<br>
Position above the webspeed and<br>
Position above the prefunnel at CCD funnel<br>
One receives through it a statement powerful reference<br>
variable which one relates all to the KFS-amount, which is<br>
released in material gentle carding. In case one would like<br>
to describe additionally the entire carding area by means of<br>
KFS-amount, then like wise in an extremely fibre damaging<br><br>
carding positioning the KFS-amount is covered. For change of<br>
carding intensity, as per Fig. 4a, 4b and 5 the automatic<br>
PFS-adjustment is applied.<br>
First the KFS-amount is sucked specifically and is led on the<br>
small filter medium 25 of measuring equipment 19, according<br>
to which after a definite time the pressure drop before and<br>
behind the filter medium 25 is determined, from where a<br>
pressure difference ∆P is found out. This pressure<br>
difference is proportioned to KSF-amount. In case one puts<br>
the pressure difference at gentle carding to 0%, then one<br>
can describe the degree of fibre damage of any other carding<br>
percentage wise. With this percentage variable the degree of<br>
carding on line can be described.<br>
The measurement of KFS-amount can be carried out with help<br>
of a portable measurement equipment 19 at different cards.<br>
Since the PFS in each card is available at disposal, it is<br>
possible, to integrate the KFS-amount determination in the<br>
card. For this the additional cleaning equipment 37 could be<br>
replaced through a rotation reverse of ventilator 23.<br><br>
