3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and its use thereof.<br><br>
Technical field of the invention:<br>
This invention relates to process for selective separation of active diastereomers of Tramadol hydrochloride from the mixture of corresponding trans/cis isomers by converting to its nitrate salts with high yield and purity.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Tramadol is an opioid which is used to relieve moderate to moderately severe pain. It is a synthetic agent, as a 4-phenyl-piperidine analogue of codeine. Tramadol is usually marketed as the hydrochloride salt (Tramadol hydrochloride) and is available in both the form of injectable and oral dosage form.<br>
Chemical name of Tramadol hydrochloride is [(dimethylamino) methyl] -1 -(3-methoxyphenyl) cyclohexanol hydrochloride. Tramadol hydrochloride has two chiral centers hence, it will have 4 stereoisomers (A, B, C, D)<br><br>

Out of the four isomers C and D i.e. 1S,2S and 1R,2R are found to be significantly more active (E. Frankus et al., Arzneim-Forsch., 28(1 A), 114 (1978), R. B. Reffa, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 267, 331, (1993)). Those two active isomers are present in almost equal proportion in tramadol hydrochloride. Thus, alternative chemical name of tramadol hydrochloride, representing stereochemistry is "(RR, SS)-2-[(dimethylamino) methyl]-l-(3-methoxyphenyl) cyclohexanol hydrochloride." Remaining two inactive isomers A &amp; B<br>
1 <br>
i.e. "(RS, SR)-2-[(dimethylamino) methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl) cyclohexanol hydrochloride" are impurities present in tramadol hydrochloride.<br>
The active (RR, SS) diastereomers are referred to throughout this specification as the trans isomers and the inactive (RS, SR) diastereomers are referred to throughout this specification as the cis isomers.<br>
Tramadol is commercially synthesized by Grignard reaction of 2-dimethylaminomethyl cyclohexanone/Mannich base (I) with 3-methoxy phenyl magnesium bromide (II) (Scheme-1)<br><br><br><br>
u<br>
O<br>
I<br><br><br><br>
Scheme:-1	n<br>
Reaction leads to the formation of mixture of cis and trans isomers with different proportions depending on reaction conditions.<br>
Various processes for the isolation of active trans tramadol hydrochloride have been described in the prior art.<br>
US 3652 589 describes separation of trans tramadol hydrochloride by crystallization from 1, 4-dioxane. The main disadvantage of this process is use of 1, 4-dioxane, which is listed as category-I carcinogen. It causes CNS depression and necrosis of liver and kidneys. Moreover, dioxane poses safety threats by forming hazardous peroxides. (Kirk &amp; Othmer, 3rd edition vol. 9, 386; Vol.13, 267; Vol 17, 48). Hence, the limit set for its content in API's is extremely low. Alternative processes without using 1, 4-dioxane are disclosed in subsequent patents listed below.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,414,129 discloses a selective precipitation of trans tramadol hydrochloride by treating a mixture of trans and cis isomers with a solution of<br>
2<br><br>
hydrochloric acid in the presence of an organic solvent selected from medium-molecular-weight alcohols, ketones, esters, and ethers.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,755 describes purification and isolation of (RR,SS)-2-dimethylaminomethyl-l-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol from mixture of (RR, SS) (trans)/(RS,SR) (cis) isomer by selectively dehydrating (RS,SR) isomer and selectively precipitating the desired (RR,SS) isomer as an amine acid salt; and recrystallizing the purified product.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,620 follows separation of mixture of trans tramadol and its corresponding cis isomer by selective reaction of electrophilic reagent with cis isomer and precipitating the unreacted trans tramadol from the reaction mixture.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,351 and WO 99/36390 discloses separation of cis and trans isomers of tramadol by converting into Hydrobromide salt and selectively precipitating the trans form.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,169,205 discloses process for purification by selective precipitation of (RR,SS)-2-(dimethylamino)methyl-l-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol from mixture of (RR, SS) and (RS,SR)-2-(dimethylamino)methyl-l-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanol from a solvent consisting of water and a water-miscible organic solvent.<br>
WO 99/03820 and WO 99/36389 follows separation of cis and trans isomer by formation of tramadol base hydrate as an intermediate and converting it into.<br>
Another report, WO 99/61405 and WO 99/36390 describe the separation of isomers by forming a hydrochloride, hydrobromide or hydroiodide salt and crystallizing from solvents such as nitriles and alcohols. After repetition of these processes it is observed that purity can not achieve without repeated crystallization which causes low yield. So the method may be achievable on laboratory scale but it would may create processing problems if attempted on large scale.<br>
3<br><br>
Another modification was published in EP 0778262 that describes isomeric separation of cis/trans mixture by treating it in acidic conditions using sulphuric acid or para toluene sulphonic acid thereby, selectively dehydrating to cis isomer to an alkene compound and followed by precipitating the desired (RR,SS) isomer as an amine acid salt; and recrystallizing the purified product.<br>
EP1346978 describes a process for the preparation of (RR,SS)-2-dimethylaminomefhyl-l-(3-methoxyphenyl) cyclohexanol hydrochloride by reacting a mixture of (RR,SS)^ and (RS,SR)- isomer and/or a hydrate of (RR,SS)-isomer with HC1 and water.<br>
All the above processes for isolation or purification of trans Tramadol have some significant disadvantages. For example, some methods use hazardous solvents. Some other processes require multiple steps which can make reaction tedious. Low yield, and low selectivity of the desired trans isomer are some drawbacks of the above mentioned process.<br>
The process which describes separation of desired isomer without use of 1,4-dioxane give lower yield of desired trans isomer, there by increasing cost of the product. During laboratory development work for cost effective separation process of cis and trans tramadol hydrochloride, it is observed that separation of trans tramadol isomer through conversion of tramadol base into its acid salts is high yielding and gives substantially purified product.<br>
Hence, it is necessary to develop cost effective process which gives highly pure trans isomer with high yield.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a cost effective process for isolation of trans tramadol hydrochloride with high yield and substantially free from cis isomer.<br>

Summary of the Invention:<br>
The present invention discloses process for selective separation of active diastereomers of tramadol hydrochloride. More particularly the invention discloses process for selective separation of (RR, SS)-2-[(dimethylamino) methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl) cyclohexanol (Tramadol) hydrochloride isomer trans Tramadol hydrochloride from the mixture of corresponding (RR, SS) (trans) and (RS, SR) (cis) isomers by converting to nitrate salts and separating desired trans isomer easily with high yield and purity.<br>
Detailed Description:<br>
In the process, according to the invention, the starting racemic tramadol base may be free from impurities or the tramadol base obtained directly from the reaction of 2-dimethylaminomethyl cyclohexanone with 3-methoxy phenyl magnesium bromide of varying cis/trans isomeric ratio without and further purification. The racemic tramadol base contains trans isomer in the range of 60-75% along with 15-20% cis isomer and 10-20% other impurities.<br>
The process, according to the present invention, for separation of cis and trans isomers of tramadol involves dissolution of racemic tramadol base in a suitable solvent followed by treatment with nitric acid to form nitrate salt. Nitrate salt of cis tramadol isomer is soluble in solvents while that of trans isomer is insoluble and could be separated by filtration. Purity of nitrate salt of desired trans isomer depends on solvent used for resolution and temperature of the reaction mass at the time of filtration. Generally, purity of trans tramadol nitrate obtained is in the range of 95-99.8 %. Purity can be further enhanced by refluxing the trans tramadol nitrate obtained by above process with any of the solvent.<br>
