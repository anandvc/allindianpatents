COOLING TOPICAL PATCH PREPARATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 119 (e), this application claims priority to the filing date of the United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/641,482 filed January 4, 2005, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
INTRODUCTION Background of the Invention<br>
Tissue inflammation is the result of interconnected physiological events. Inflammation of the skin, which is associated with tissue damage, can result from various skin disorders such as eczema, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, allergic dermatitis, etc. Inflammation is also associated with tissue damage resulting from ultraviolet or thermal bums, attack by certain microorganisms, insect bites, stings, etc. Inflammation of deeper structures, the muscles, tendons, bursa, and joints, which is associated with tissue damage, can result from physical trauma, e.g. sprains, strains, contusions, strenuous exercise, etc. Such inflammation may result in bursitis, tendinitis, and muscle soreness. Inflammation is also associated with tissue damage resulting from metabolic disorders, such as gout, or from immunologic disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or from changes associated with aging, such as osteoarthritis.<br>
Symptoms of inflammation are erythema (redness), edema (swelling), heat, pain, and loss of function. The immediate consequence of tissue damage is the release of certain chemical agents which are mediators of inflammation, i.e., these materials evoke and intensify the events which result in the redness, swelling, pain and heat. Examples of these chemical agents are histamine, seratonin and the kinins.<br>
Today, various topical patch formulations are employed to relieve pains such a stiff shoulder, back pain, inflammation, and so on. General active ingredients of these topical patch preparations are menthol, camphor and mint oil as a cooling effect counterirritant However, a problem with these cooling agents is their strong odor, which can be found offensive.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is a continued interest therefore in the development of new topical cooling agent compositions that could efficiently treat a subject suffering from the above conditions.<br>

TOPICAL PATCH PREPARATIONS<br>
As summarized above, the subject invention is directed to topical patch preparations of an odorless physiological cooling agent. The topical patch preparations of the subject invention are characterized by having an effective amount of the odorless physiological cooling agent present in a gel adhesive base. Figure 1 provides a representation of a topical patch preparation described according to the subject invention. As can be seen in Figure 1, this representative<br><br>
topical patch preparation 10 contains a gel adhesive base 12 present on a support 14. Each of these components is now described in greater detail.<br>
The gel adhesive base which serves as the retaining layer, is made up of the odorless physiological cooling agent that is present in, e.g., dissolved in or dispersed in, and adhesive gel base. By "physiological cooling agent" is meant an agent that, when contacted with skin of a subject, imparts a cooling sensation or effect to the subject, in a manner analogous to the cooling effect of menthol. By "odorless" is meant that the odor of the agent is less pungent than the odor of<br><br>
In certain embodiments, the cooling agent is an acyclic amide, where representative acyclic amids include compounds of the formula;<br><br>
where<br>
R1, R2 and R3 are each C1-C5 alkyl and together provide a total of at least 3„ such as from about 3-10, including from about 5-10, carbon atoms; and R' is C1 -C5 alkyl, C1 -C8 hydroxyalkyl or alkylcarboxyalkyl of up to 8 carbon atoms. In this group R1 is in representative embodiments, methyl, ethyl or n-propyl and one or both of R2 and R3 is branched in an alpha or beta position relative to the carbon atom marked (*).ln representative embodiments, the cooling agent is N,2,3-trimethyl-w-<br><br>
isopropylbutamide (also known as WS-23; trimethyl isopropyl butanimide, CAS#51115-67-4).<br>
The above compounds can be produced using any convenient protocol, where representative protocols are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,296,255.<br>
Other representative odorless physiological cooling agents of interest include, but are not limited to: linalool, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, WS-3(Millennium Chemical), FlescolatMGA(Haarman &amp; Reimer), FrescolatML(Haarmann &amp; Reimer), PMD38(Takasago), CoolactP(Takasago) and Cooling Agent 10(Takasago); and the like.<br>
The amount of odorless physiological cooling agent that is present in the adhesive gel base is an amount sufficient to administer to a subject an effective amount of the agent when applied to a skin surface of the subject, as described in greater detail below. In many embodiments, the amount of odorless physiological cooling agent present in the adhesive gel base ranges from about 0.1 to 15.0 % (w/w), sometimes from about 0.5 to 10.0 % (w/w), such as from about 1.0 to 8.0 % (w/w) and including from about 2.0 to 7.0 % (w/w).<br>
The adhesive gel base that includes the agent, as described above, is made up of a water-soluble high molecular weight substance, water and a water-retaining agent. In certain embodiments, the adhesive gel base may further include a cosolvent, e.g., an organic cosolvent. Each of these components is now described separately in greater detail.<br>
Water-soluble high molecular weight substances of interest include water-soluble polymers, where polymers of interest include, but are not limited to: gelatin, starch, agar, mannan, alginic acid, polyacryiic acid, sodium polyacrylate, dextrin, methylcellulose, sodium methylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose gum, carboxyvinyl polymer, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, Arabia gum, acacia, tragacanth gum, karaya gum, and starch acrylate copolymer or other starch sodium acrylate graft copolymers. Metallic salts of these, as well as the products of cross-linking these by means of organic or inorganic cross-linking agents, are also of interest. These water-soluble polymers can be used to bring out the properties and characteristics of the other starting materials used in the adhesive gel composition, and in practice can be used alone or in combinations of 2 or more. The amount of water soluble high molecular weight<br><br>
substance(s) present in the adhesive gel base generally ranges from about 0.5 to 20, such as from a bout 2 to 20 % (w/w).<br>
While any convenient water may be employed as the water component, of interest are distilled water or ion-exchange water or the like, which is preferred in many embodiments of the subject invention. The amount of water present in the gel adhesive is sufficient to impart the desired physical properties to the gel adhesive, and to improve the swelling of the horny or keratinized layer of the skin to thereby improve the permeability or penetration of active agent(s), where the amount of water in the gel composition generally ranges from about 10 to 80%, such as from about 30 to 60% (w/w).<br>
The water-retaining agent or water-holding agent of the subject adhesive gel compositions is any agent that is capable of at least diminishing the volatilization of water contained in the adhesive gel base so that the water content in the adhesive gel base is maintained at least a substantially constant, if not constant, level during storage and use of the preparation. One or more water-retaining agents may be employed in the subject compositions, where the amount of water-retaining agent present in the adhesive gel base may range from about 1 to 70%, such as from about 10 to 60% by weight. Examples of suitable water-retaining or water-holding agents include, but are not limited to: 1 or more types of polyvalent or polyhydric or sugars or alcohols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, and ethylene glycol, and the like.<br>
In addition, the subject gel base compositions may also include a cosolvent, where the cosolvent is generally an organic cosolvent. Examples of cosolvents of interest include, but are not limited to: n-methyl-2-pyrroIidone, deet, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol (e.g., low molecular weight polyethylene glycol, such as PEG 600 or lower, e.g., 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 etc and blends) thereof, and isopropyl myristate, etc.The cosolvent may be made up of a simple component or be incombination of two or more components.<br>
Furthermore, in addition to the aforementioned ingredients, various additives that are used in ordinary topical water-soluble patch preparations may also be suitably compounded as needed, including inorganic substances such as kaolin, bentonite, and titanium dioxide; preservatives such as paraben; anionic, cationic, and nonionic surfactants; metallic aluminum crosslinking agents such as aluminum<br><br>
chloride, dried aluminum hydroxide gel, and dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate; oils such as jojoba oil and castor oil; chelating agents such as EDTA; pH regulators such as malic acid, tartaric acid, and diisopropanolamine; alcohols such as ethanol; moisture retaining agents such as hyaluronic acid, aloe extract, and urea; and other perfumes and coloring agents.<br>
The pH of the gel base composition typically is one that lies in a physiologically acceptable range, where the pH typically may range from about 4.0 to 7.0, such as from about 4.0 to 6.0.<br>
As mentioned above, the adhesive gel composition containing the one or more active ingredients is typically present on a support or backing. The support is generally made of a flexible material which is capable of fitting in the movement of human body and includes, for example, various non-woven fabrics, woven fabrics, spandex, flannel, or a laminate of these materials with polyethylene film, polyethylene glycol terephthalate film, polyvinyl chloride film, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer film, poiyurethane film, and the like.<br>
in addition to the adhesive gel composition and the support layer, the subject topical patches may also include a release film 16 on the surface of the gel layer opposite the backing that provides for protection of the gel layer from the environment The release film may be any convenient material, where representative release films include polyesters, such as PET or PP, and the like.<br>
In many embodiments, the patch is present in a sealed package. Generally, the sealed package is fabricated from a packaging material that includes a layer made out of a material capable of preventing passage of moisture, oxygen and other agents, i.e., the package includes in a moisture/oxygen barrier material. Any suitable barrier material may be employed, where barrier materials of interest include metallic layers, e.g., aluminum, where in many embodiments, the barrier layer is an aluminum layer. This barrier layer has a thickness sufficient to provide for the barrier function, where the thickness typically ranges from about 5 to 15, usually from about 6 to 10μm. In many embodiments, the package is a laminate of the barrier layer in combination with one or more additional layers, e.g., polymeric layers, paper layers, etc. A representative aluminum containing package that may be used with the subject patch preparations is sold by Dainippon Printing Co., Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan).<br><br>
The topical patch preparations may be fabricated using any convenient protocol. One convenient protocol for fabrication of the subject patches includes preparing a gel adhesive paste through the uniform mixing of the aforementioned ingredients and then coating the paste onto the support, followed by cutting of the resultant product to the specified size to obtain the desired topical patch preparation. The resultant topical patch preparation is then heat-sealed, typically several sheets to a package, using a packaging material containing an aluminum layer, as described supra, to obtain the sealed topical patch. For a more detailed description of the fabrication protocol, see U.S. Patent No. 5,827,529; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In a representative fabrication protocol, the base used in the present invention is produced by using a mixer to uniformly blend the aforementioned ingredients by means of any convenient protocol into a paste, which is then spread by means of a spreader onto a backing or support material. As indicated above, the support material may be, for example, paper, or a woven or nonwoven cloth made of PET or PP or some other polyester fiber. For protection, the surface thereof is then covered with a release film of a polyester such as PET or PP. These steps are illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
As is described in greater detail below, in representative embodiments the hydrogel patch compositions are self-adhesive, i.e., inherently adhesive, and thus may be fixed in a position over the skin wound, i.e., removably bonded to and/or about a given skin wound, without the use of additional adhesives or other means to hold the patch in place over the formulation. For example, the hydrogel composition matrix may itself be adhesive.<br>
In representative embodiments, the hydrogel compositions are adhesive, as determined using the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) Z-0237 adhesive strength measurement protocol (see e.g., U.S. Application Serial No. 60/615,320 titled " METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING SKIN WOUNDS and filed on December 1, 2004; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference). A given hydrogel composition is considered to be adhesive if it stops at least a No. 3 size ball, such as at least about a No. 4 size ball, including at least a bout a No. 5 size ball, in this protocol. In certain embodiments, the composition is sufficiently adhesive to stop a No. 6 ball or greater, e.g., No. 7 ball or greater, e.g., No. 8 ball or<br><br>
greater, e.g., No. 9 ball or greater. In certain embodiments, the subject compositions are differentially adhesive, in that they show greater adhesiveness to non-living, as opposed to living matter.<br>
In certain other embodiments a subject hydrogel patch composition may be held in a fixed position about a skin wound using a separate adhesive such as an adhesive backing or the like or a combination of inherent adhesiveness and an additional separate adhesion means may be employed.<br>
Certain hydrogel patch compositions may be adapted and employed for use with the subject invention. Representative hydrogel patch compositions that may be adapted for use with the subject invention include, but are not limited to those described in PCT International Publication Nos.: WO 02/078757 and WO 02/078756 and U.S. Patent Nos.: 5,120,544; 5,160,328; 5,270,358; 5,423,737; 5,476,443; 5,489,262; 5,501,661; 5,827,529; 6,039,940; 6,096,333; 6,214,374; 6,296,869; 6,348,212; 6,455,065; the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The resulting product is then cut to the specified size to obtain the desired topical patch preparation composition. The shape of the patch may vary, where representative shapes include square, rectangle, oval, circle, etc. The size of the patch may also vary, where in many embodiments the size ranges from about 1 to 200 cm2, and in many embodiments from about 10 to 180 cm2, usually from about 100 to 150 cm2, e.g., 140 cm2. The weight of the base in the final topical patch may be from about 300 to about 1500 g/m2, such as from about 600 to about 1200 g/m2. This water-soluble topical patch preparation is then packaged by means of a heat seal in a packaging material that includes a layer of aluminum to obtain the final product, as shown in Figure 3.<br>
It should be noted that the above manufacturing protocols are merely representative. Any convenient protocol that is capable of producing the subject topical patch preparations, as described above, may be employed.<br>
METHODS OF USING PATCH PREPARATIONS<br>
The subject patch preparations find use in applications of topically delivering a cooling agent to a subject, particularly the skin of a subject. In practicing the<br><br>
invention, the patch may be administered to any convenient topical site. Topical sites of interest include, but are not limited to: arms, leg, torso, head, etc. The surface area that is covered by the topical patch preparation following application must be sufficient to provide for the desired amount of agent administration, and in many embodiments ranges from about 1 to 200 cm2, and in many embodiments from about 10 to 180 cm2, usually from about 100 to 150 cm2, e.g., 140 cm2.<br>
In representative embodiments, the period of time required to deliver the desired amount of agent is generally not exceeding about 48 hours, usually not exceeding about 24 hours. However, the period of time during which the preparation is maintained at the application site is, in many embodiments, at least about 30 minutes, usually at least about 1 hour.<br>
In practicing the subject methods, a topical patch may be applied a single time or a plurality of times over a given time period, e.g., the course of the disease condition being treated, where the dosing schedule when a plurality of patches are administered over a given time period may be daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, etc.<br>
The above described patches and methods find use in any application in which the administration of a physiological cooling agent to a subject is desired. Among other applications, the topical application the cooling agent according to the subject methods as described herein is effective for treating inflammation, aches, etc., including the maladies reviewed in the introduction section of this application. Generally such subjects are "mammals" or "mammalian," where these terms are used broadly to describe organisms which are within the class mammalia, including the orders carnivore (e.g., dogs and cats), rodentia (e.g., mice, guinea pigs, and rats), and primates (e.g., humans, chimpanzees, and monkeys). In many embodiments, the hosts will be humans.<br>
In representative embodiments, the subject methods find use in the treatment of a disease condition. By treatment is meant at least an amelioration of the symptoms associated with the pathological condition afflicting the host, where amelioration is used in a broad sense to refer to at least a reduction in the magnitude of a parameter, e.g. symptom, associated with the pathological condition being treated, side effects associated therewith. As such, treatment also includes situations where the pathological condition, or at least symptoms associated therewith, are completely inhibited, e.g. prevented from happening, or stopped, e.g.<br><br>
terminated, such that the host no longer suffers from the pathological condition, or at least the symptoms that characterize the pathological condition. As such, treatment includes both curing and managing a disease condition.<br>
KITS<br>
Also provided are kits, where the subject kits at least include one or more topical patch preparations, as described above. The subject topical patch preparations in the kits may be present in a package, as described supra. The topical patches of the kits are typically present in individual pouches or analogous containers, to preserve the composition of the patches until use. The subject kits also generally include instructions for how to use the patches, where the instructions typically include information about where to apply the patch, dosing schedules etc. The instructions are generally recorded on a suitable recording medium. For example, the instructions may be printed on a substrate, such as paper or plastic, etc. As such, the instructions may be present in the kits as a package insert, in the labeling of the container of the kit or components thereof (i.e. associated with the packaging or subpackaging) etc. In other embodiments, the instructions are present as an electronic storage data file present on a suitable computer readable storage medium, e.g. CD-ROM, diskette, etc.<br>
