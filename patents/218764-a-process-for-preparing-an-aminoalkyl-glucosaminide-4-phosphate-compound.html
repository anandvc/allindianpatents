				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparing an aminoalkyl glucosaminide 4-phosphate (AGP) compound. Such compounds have been found to be immunoeffectors, adjuvants for vaccines and the like, and in addition, can possess therapeutic and/or prophylactic properties of their own. In addition  this invention relates to processes for the production of glycosyl halides, which can serve as intermediates in the synthesis of AGP compounds, disaccharides, and structurally related molecules.<br>
Aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphates are described in a number of patents, published patent applications, and journal articles. Such compounds in general have five or six acyl groups in the molecular structure, together with an "aglycon" (nitrogen-containing —<br><br>
portion), which may be cyclical or acyclical. AGPs having acyclical aglycon groups are disclosed, for instance, m U.S. patents 6,113,918; 6,303,347 and 6,355,257. AGPs having cyclical aglycon groups are disclosed, for instance, in WO 02/012258.<br>
[0004]     The above-mentioned documents describe the production of the AGP compounds by two alternative processes. In one process a protected 3-0-acyloxyacylated glycosyl halide containing a phosphonate side chain is coupled with an aminoalkanol or aminoalkanethiol of the type described in the patents. The reaction product is then selectively acylated to provide additional acyl groups, as described, and protecting groups are removed. In the second process, both the phosphonate side chain and the fatty acid groups are incorporated after the coupling reaction. Additional process information for producing AGP compounds is contained m Johnson et al,, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9:2273 (1999).<br>
[00051    Disaccharides that may be produced by the processes described herein include components of the well known immunostimulant monophosphoryl lipid A (contained, for example in MPL® immunostimulant (Corixa Corp.) Other disaccharides that may be produced are disclosed in, for instance, PCT application WO 01/90129 and U.S. patents 6,013,640; 4,987,237; 4,912,094; 4,436,727; and 4,436,728. hi U.S. patent 6,103,640 the disacchaiide was prepared by coupling an N-acyloxj^cylated or N-protected glycosyl acceptor unit with a protected and/or 3-0-acyloxyacylated glycosyl donor unit. The protecting groups were variously benzyl (Bn) and 2,^,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Troc) groups. The glycosyl acceptor and donor imits were constructed separately using a series of substituent protection and deprotection steps, begiiming with the known starting materials benzyl-and 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl-2-amino-2-deoxy-4,6-0-isopropylidene-i8-D-glucopyranoside, respectively.<br>
[0006] Glycosyl haUdes are used in many processes to introduce a glycoside moiety into a molecule, typically as part of a multistep synthesis in the field of saccharide chemistry. They are useful intermediates for incorporating a wide variety of groups, typically by reaction with nucleophiles, especially oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen nucleophiles. It would be advantageous to provide a process for producing the AGP and disaccharide compounds using a glycosyl haUde as a starting material.<br>
[0007] Various ways of producing glycosyl halides have been described. Generally, they involve halogenation of an existing glycoside (which may contain typical protecting groups on reactive moieties such as amino or hydroxyl).<br><br>
[0008]    In U.S. patent 6,299,897, for example, an ethyl ester of the glycoside in question (in this instance, N-acetjd neuraminic acid) is reacted with acetyl chloride to produce the corresponding glycosyl chloride. In U.S. patent 5,843,463, a glycosyl chloride is produced by reacting the glycoside in question (3-0-allyl-5-0-benzyl-l,2-0-methoxybenzyUdene-alpha-D-ribofuranose) with trimethylsilyl chloride. The reaction is conducted by mixing the two reactants or by dissolving the glycoside in the trimethylsilyl chloride.<br>
[0009]    U.S. patent 4,613,590 discloses a process for preparation of glycosyl chloride by treatment of the glycoside with titanium tetrachloride. In Sugiyama et al.. Org. Lett. 2: 2713 (2000), glycosyl chlorides were prepared by reaction of thioglycosides with chlorosulfoniun chloride.<br>
[0010]   Kovac, Carbohydr. Res. 245:219 (2993) prepared a glycosyl chloride by reaction of the glycoside with dichloromethyl methyl ether and zinc chloride. Talceo et al., Carbohydr. Res. 245: 81 (1993) produced a glycosyl chloride by reaction with chlorine. Magnusson et al., J. Org. Chem. 55:3181 (1990) produced a glycosyl chloride by reaction of the 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl glycoside with 1,1-dichloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of a catalytic amount of zinc chloride.<br>

[0030]     The terms "oxyahphatic", "aminoaliphatic" and "thioaliphatic" are used in their conventional sense, and refer to aliphatic groups attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfiir atom, respectively. "Alkoxy", "thioalkoxy" and "aminoalkyl" refer to such groups containing saturated acyclic aliphatic moieties.<br>
[0031 ]     The term "heteroaliphatic," by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a group analogous to an aliphatic group, i.e. a saturated or unsaturated straight or branched chain, or cyclic, radical, or combinations thereof; consisting of the stated number of carbon atoms and further comprising at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfiir atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quatemized. The heteroatom(s) O, N and S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroaliphatic group or at the position at which that group is attached to the remainder of the molecule.

R", R" and R"" each independently may be hydrogen, optionally substituted allcyl, aryl optionally substituted with 1-3 halogens, optionally substituted alkoxy, optionally substituted thioalkoxy or optionally substituted aryl-(Ci-C4)alkyl groups. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R", R" and R"" groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R" and R" are attached to the same nifrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NR"R" is meant to include 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl.<br>
[0033]     "Aromatic" or "aryl" refers to the typical substituted or unsubstituted non-aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups of this class, i.e., a polyunsaturated, typically aromatic, hydrocarbon substituent, which can be a single ring or multiple rings (up to three rings) which are ftised together or linked covalently, such as phenyl, naphthyl, and the like.<br>
[0034]     "Arylalkvl" refers to alkyl groups subsisted by one or more aryl groups; for instance, ben2yl, phenethyl, triphenylmethyl, and the like.<br>
[0035]    "Acvl" refers to a group derived from an organic acid by removal of the hydroxy group. Acyl compounds may in general be aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic in nature. "Aliphatic acvl" refers to such groups derived from saturated or unsaturated aliphatic acids, and includes groups such as acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, hexanoyl, decanoyl, dodecanoyl, tetradecanoyl, and the like. Li defining acyl groups by their carbon atom content, the reference is to the carbon atom content of the entire group. Thus, acetyl is a C2 acyl group; propionyl is a C3 acyl group, tetradecanoyl is a Cu acyl group, etc.<br>
[0036]     "Alkano\doxvcarbonyr" refers to groups having a saturated or unsaturated aUphatic group, or an arylalkyl group such as benzyl, linked through an oxygen atom to a carbonyl group, i.e. a group having the general formula Alk.-OC(0)- in which Alk. stands for an aliphatic or arylalkyl groiq) as defined above.<br><br>
[0037]     " Alkanovloxvacvl" refers to a saturated or unsaturated acyl group substituted at the indicated position by an aliphatic group A1.C(0)0- in which Al. stands for an acyclic saturated or unsaturated aliphatic group. The overall aUcanoyloxy group preferably has from 2 to 24 carbon atoms, most preferably from 6 to 14 carbon atoms. The acyl portion of the alkanoyloxyacyl group contains from 6 to 14 carbon atoms. A typical group of this type is the 3-(n-alkanoyloxy)acyl group, where the acyl group is tetradecanoyl and the alkanoyloxy group contains from 2 to 20, preferably from 6 to 14, carbon atoms, inclusive. Similarly "alkanoyl" refers to a group A1.C(0)- wherein Al. is as defined above.<br>
[0038]     "Protecting group" refers to any of a large number of groups used to replace one or both hydrogens of a reactive group such as a hydroxy, amino or thiol group, so as to block, prevent, or reduce reactivity of the group. Examples of protecting groups (and a listing of commonly used abbreviations for them) can be found in T. W. Greene and P. G. Puts, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry" (Wiley), Beaucage and Iyer, Tetrahedron 48:2223 (1992) and Harrison et al.. Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, vols. 1-8 (Wiley).<br>
[0039]     Representative amino protecting groups include those that form a carbamate or amide with the nitrogen atom, as well as those groups collectively referred to in the Greene and Puts text as "special -NH protective groups". Representative examples of amino protecting groups include acetyl (Ac), trifluoroacetyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), tert.-butoxycarbonyl (Hoc), allyloxycarbonyl (Aoc), 9-fluorenylmethyloxy-carbonyl (Fmoc), nitro-versatryloxycarbonyl (Nvoc), optionally substituted phthaloyl and the like.<br>
[0040]     Representative hydroxy protecting groups include those where the hydroxy group is either acylated or alkylated, such as by the formation of ethers or esters using, for instance, acetyl, benzyl, trityl, alkyl, tetrahydropyranyl, allyl and trisubstituted silyl groups.<br>
[0041]    The choice of a protecting group for a given compound, purpose or set of conditions is within the skill of those in the art, and is done so as to protect, generally or selectively, the reactive group in question under the prevailing conditions (presence of other reactive compounds, pH, temperature, etc.) Protecting groups that may be used in this invention and are mentioned herein include phthaloyl, acetyl (Ac), benzyl (Bn), 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycaibonyl (Troc), t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS), t-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS), and 2,2,2-trichloro-l,l-dimethylethyl chloroformyl (TCBOC) groups. As is known in the art, a certain protecting group or type of group may be more suitable than others for use with a<br><br>
particular compound or in a given situation, and advantage is taken of these suitabilities in developing processes that involve compounds with reactive groups such as hydroxy and/or amino. TTius, as will be seen below, a reaction scheme can be developed for producing or reacting certain compounds in which general or selective protection or deprotection (removal of protecting groups) is carried out at certain points. For instance, in order to selectively react a hydroxy group in a compound that also contains an amino group, or vice versa, the group whose reaction is not desired at this point can be blocked with a protecting group that is not removed imder conditions of the reaction (for example, is not base-hydrolyzable if the reaction is to be conducted under basic conditions, while the group to be reacted can be protected by a group that is base-hydrolyzable, so that said group becomes unblocked, and thus reactive, at that time. Similarly as will be seen below, in order to selectively react a group, e.g., a hydroxyl group, located at one position in the molecule, it may be protected with a different protecting group than other hydroxyls in the molecule. As used herein, the designation "PG" refers to protecting groups that form esters, ethers or carbonates with hydroxy groups (i.e., with the oxygen atom of a hydroxy group] or that form amides or carbamates with amino groups [i.e. with the nitrogen atom of an amino group. The designation " PG" " is used herein to refer to optionally substituted phthaloyl groups, for example phthaloyl or tetrachlorophthaloyl, and which may be used to protect an amino group, as shown. However, in any event, the selection of particular protecting groups used or illustrated in the processes described herein is not in any way intended to limit the invention.<br>

More specifically, in this process, a glycosyl halide is formed by reacting a silyl glycoside having flie formula (II):<br>
w wherein R20 is a trisubstituted silyl group having the formula RaRbRcSi in which Ra, Rt and Re are independently selected from the group consisting of Ci-Cg alkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl and optionally substituted phenyl, preferably TBS or TBDPS, and W, X, Y, and Z independently represent H, optionally protected hydroxy, optionally protected amino, and optionally substituted alkyl groups, with a dihalomethyl alkyl ether, preferably dichloromethyl methyl ether, in the presence of zinc chloride, zinc bromide, boron trifluoride, or a similarly suitable Lewis acid. The Lewis acid is used in about a stoichiometric amount with respect to the silyl glycoside. The reaction to produce the glycosyl halide is conducted at a temperature of from about -30 °C to about 50 °C, preferably from about 0 °C to about 30 °C, and in the presence of a solvent such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, or similar solvents that are inert to the conditions required for the reaction. The temperature of the reaction is selected to allow the reactants to substantially dissolve and to prevent the dihalomethyl alkyl ether from boiling away. Yields of the desired product glycosyl halide are generally from about 50 to about 95%. Selection of such solvents is within the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art. The silyl glycosides are produced conventionally, typically in a protected form, as is known in the art. However, certain silyl glycosides, such as certain triacetylated silyl glycosides and derivatives thereof^ may be produced via novel intermediates described below, which form an aspect of the invention.<br>
[0044]     One of skill in the art will appreciate that the glycosyl halides may exist as isomers if other substituents are present on the glycosyl halide ring. The invention includes production of the separate isomers as well as mixtures of both isomers. Conditions for reactions of many nucleophiles with glycosyl halides are well known to persons of ordinary skill in the art,<br>
{0045]     The resulting glycosyl halides thus typically have the formula (ID)<br><br>

wherein A is CI, Br, or F and W, X, Y and Z are as defined above.<br>
[0046J      In one preferred embodiment, the silyl glycoside and resulting products are substituted at the 3- position (substituent X) by an aliphatic acyl group, preferably an alkanoyloxyacyl group, more preferably a 3-/i-aIkanoyloxyacyl group, and most preferably a 3-alkanoyloxytetradecanoyl group, in which the aliphatic or alkanoyl group contains from 2 to 24, preferably from 2 to 18, and most preferably from 6 to 14, carbon atoms, and the protecting groups in the compound in question are preferably Troc groups or similar aUcanoyloxycarbonyl groups.

wherein A is CI, Br, or F; R20 is a trisubstituted silyl group and R21 is an aliphatic acyl group, preferably a 3-n-atkanoyloxytetradecanoyl group. Note that in this formula and those that follow, protecting groups have been specifically identified for purposes of illustration and/or clarity. However, as known in the art, other protecting groups as defined generally above for "PG" may be used, as suitable. Thus, for instance, more generally these compounds can be represented by the formula<br>

where PG represents protecting groups that form an ether, ester or carbonate with the oxygen atom or that form an amide or carbamate with the nitrogen atom, respectively.<br><br>
[0047J    In another preferred embodiment, the silyl glycoside has a hydroxyl group at the 4-position substituted with a phosphate ester group such as a dialkylphosphonyl or diarylphosphonyl group, R21 is an alkanoyloxyacyl group, preferably a 3-n-alkanoyloxytetradecanoyl group, and the protecting groups are preferably "TCBOC" groups, obtained from 2,2,2-trichloro-1,1 -dimethylethyl chloroformate, or similar alkanoyloxycarbonyl protecting groups such as Troc; i.e., the silyl glycoside may have the specific formula (VI):<br>

[0048]    In one aspect of the invention the glycosyl chlorides thus produced are reacted with a monosaccharide, preferably in the presence of a silver salt, to produce a disaccharide by this two-step process. Monosaccharides that may be used as reactants in this process include, for example, those having the formulas (i)-(iii):<br>

10050]     Reactions to produce products (iA) -(ivA) according to this invention are generally conducted at a temperature of from about -30 °C to about 30 °C, in a chlorinated or other solvent in the preseiice of a silver catalyst such as silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate) and under anhydrous conditions, with or without other additives such as molecular sieves or buffering agents such as tetramethylurea..<br>
[0051]     In another aspect of the invention the silyl glycosides of Formula (D) are coupled with a monosaccharide directly, without proceeding through formation of a glycosyl halide. The resulting product is again a disaccharide having substituents according to the starting materials. Such a process is generally conducted at a temperature of from about -78 °C to about 50 °C in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid catalyst such as trimethylsilyl triflate of boron trifluoride etherate with or without the addition of drying or buffering agents.   In another aspect of this invention protecting groups can in effect be removed from a silyl glycoside having such groups by reacting it with a dihaloalkyl ether to produce the glycosyl halide, and then reacting the glycosyl halide with a silver salt such as silver oxide or silver carbonate in the presence of water to produce the corresponding hemiacetal.<br>
[0052]    The disaccharides produced by either process may be fiirther reacted by silylating the hydroxy! group at the 4-position of the reducing sugar with a silylating group such as TBS in the presence of imidazole and N,N-dimethylformamide to produce a 3,4- bis-silylated compound.  Addition of a phosphate group in the 4-position of the non-reducing sugar is then achieved by a sequence of steps involving (1) deprotection of the 4,6 protecting groups (typically acetate or Troc), (2) N-deprotection/acylation, (3) selective protection of the<br><br>
primary 6-position with a group such as TCBOC, and (4) by reacting the 6-protected disaccharide with a phosphonylating agent such as a phosphoramidite reagent, e.g., dibenayi diisopropylphosphoramidite [providing a dibenzylphosphono side chain], or a chlorophosphate such as bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)chlorophosphate [providing a bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)phosphono side chain] or diphenyl chlorophosphate [providing a diphenylphosphono side chain].<br>
[0053]    The invention also, analogously, includes processes for the production of triacylated disaccharides such as those having the formula (VIII):<br>
(R220)2PO<br>
R21O<br>
OBn<br>
(vm)<br>
wherein R21, R23 and R24 are aliphatic acyl, preferably alkanoyloxyacyl, groups, and R22 is an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, or arylalkyl group, by selectively protecting the C-6 hydroxyl group of a corresponding disaccharide with 2,2,2-trichloro-l,l-dimethylethyl chloroformate in the presence of a tertiary amine such as pyridine. Preferably, R21, R23 and R24 are (/?)-3-hexadecanoyloxytetradecanoyl, (R)-3-octadecanoyloxytetradecanoyl, and (i?)-3-tetradecanoyloxytetradecanoyl, respectively, but they can be the same or different depending on the desired substitutions and nature of the monosaccharide donor used in the glycosylation step.<br>
[0054] This invention also relates to processes for producing aminoalkyl and cyclic aminoalkyl glucosaminide (AGP) compounds, that is compounds of formula (I) in which X is (la) or (Ic), in which both the fatty acid and the phosphate groups are introduced onto the AGP backbone after the initial glycosylation (coupling) step. These processes involve the use of novel glycoside triol intermediates which can be selectively protected in the sugar 6-position prior to the introduction of the ester- and amide-linked acyloxyacyl residues. [0055]     One preferred method of the invention for preparing AGP compounds is shown in Scheme 1 below. Scheme 1 depicts the production of specific compounds of Formula (la) but is intended to serve only as an example of this aspect of the invention, as the same or a similar process could be used to produce other comnounds of the type of Formula (la) as well as compounds of Formula (Ic),<br><br>
10056)     In this process introduction of the aUphatic acyl, e.g. (R)-3-n-alkanoyloxy-tetradecanoyl, and phosphate groups into the glucosamine and aglycon units is also perfomied subsequent to the coupUng reaction but, in contrast to the method shown in the prior art patents, the 3-hydroxyl group is selectively esterified with an alkanoic acid substituted by an aliphatic acyl group, preferably an (R)-3-n-alkanoyloxyalkanoic acid, m the presence of an unprotected/unphosphorylated 4-hydroxyl gr6up with the 6-position blocked. This is achieved by protecting the 6-hydroxyl group of the sugar unit with a persistent protecting group in lieu of temporary protection of the 4,6-hydroxyl positions with an acetonide. Preferably, /S-glycoside 8 or the corresponding bis-Troc derivative 9, is de-0-acetylated with a suitable base to give a triol intermediate 10, which is selectively protected on the 6-position with a hindered silyl group such as t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) under standard conditions known in the art to give silyl-protected intermediate 12. The triol intermediate 10 is a novel compound 3-0-Acylation of 12 with (R)-3-n-alkanoyloxytetradecanoic acid, for instance, followed by deprotection/acylation of the sugar and aglycon amino groups, simultaneously (PG=Troc) or sequentially (PG=Aoc), using either zmc (PG=Troc) or zuic and Pd(0) (PG=Aoc) in the deprotection step and (R)-3-n-alkanoyloxytetradecanoic acid in the acylation step, provides hexaacylated intermediate 13. Pentaacylated compoimds, i.e. in which one of the acyl groups R , R, R , R   or R   is hydrogen, can be prepared by utilizing different protecting groups for the two amino groups so that one or the other can be selectively acylated; for instance, using an Aoc group for one and a Troc group for the other.<br>
(00571 Phosphorylation of the 4-hydroxyl group is carried out by methods known in the art using preferably either a dibenzyl or di-t-butyl protected chlorophosphate or phosphoramidite reagent to give the phosphotriester 14. The phosphate, silyl and any remaining protecting groups in 14 are then cleaved imder mildly acidic conditions or by other appropriate means to give compounds of Formula (la). It is important to note that the order in which the phosphate and N-linked (R)-3-n-alkanoyloxytetradecanoyl groups in 14 are introduced can be reversed by the appropriate selection of orthogonal phosphate and amine protecting groups.<br>
[00581     A variant of the method shown in Scheme 1 is shown in Scheme 2 and involves the use of a commercially available glycosyl donor such as 15 possessing either acetyl or phthalimide nitrogen-protecting groups and either an anomeric acetoxy or halide groiq). Again, this Scheme is representative of processes of the invention for producing compounds of Formula (la) or (Ic).<br><br>
[0059]     In Scheme 2, glycosyl donor 15 is coupled with a similarly N-protected acceptor xmit 16 in the presence of a suitable catalyst to give jS-glycoside 17. Since N-acetyl and phthalimide groups typically require strongly basic conditions for deprotection, the use of a base-stable ether-linked protecting group such as triphenylmethyl (trityl, Tr) on the 6-position is generally required. Accordingly, de-0-acetylation of 17 under standard conditions followed preferably by selective tritylation of the 6-position gives diol 18. Base-induced cleavage of the N-acetyl or phthalimide groups followed by simultaneous or sequential N-and 0-acylation of the resulting diamino diol intermediate with an (R)-3-n-aUcanoyloxytetradecanoic acid in ttie presence of suitable coupling reagent(s) affords the hexaacylated derivative 19. The diamino diol intermediate formed by treating compound 18 with base has the formula:<br><br>
Phosphorylation of 19 with a chlorophosphate or phosphoramidite reagent as in Scheme 1 followed by deprotection under mildly acidic conditions or by other appropriate means gives compounds of Formula (la).<br><br>
