Preparation o-f. 3-»isopropyl	111-2,1,3 benzoth^adj.aain-4 (3H)   one.<br>
2; 2' dioxides.<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing 3-isopropyl-lH-2,l,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide (I) or a salt of I<br><br>
simultaneously with sulfur trioxide or chlorosulfonic acid in the presence of an organic base or with adducts of sulfur trioxide and organic bases and phosphorus oxychloride at from 50°C to the reflux temperature, followed, if desired, by conversion into its salts.<br>
2,l,3-Benzothiadiazin-4-one 2,2-dioxide derivatives are known to be obtained by reacting anthranilic amide derivatives with sulfur trioxide derivatives in the presence of an organic base at from 0°C to room temperature to give the corresponding sulfamic acid salts, which are subsequently cyclized (DE-A 27 10 382).<br>
However, the industrial preparation of the compound I or its salts is complicated by the fact that salts or suspensions have to be handled in this process.<br>
Moreover, the purity of the resulting compounds I or their salts is not satisfactory.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that sulfamic acid salts are unstable at slevated temperature.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing the compound I or salts thereof which is simple and cost-effective and which can be used on an industrial scale, affording products of satisfactory purity.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a process for preparing 3-isopropyl-lH-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide (I) which comprises reacting the starting materials simultaneously in the presence of a base at from 50°C to reflux temperature.<br>
If the base used is 2-picoline, the reaction can be represented by the following equation:<br><br>
The process according to the invention comprises forming the sulfamic acid salt in one step in situ at from 50°C to reflux temperature and immediately cyclizing it with phosphorus oxychloride, which is already present, to give the compound I.<br>
The reaction can be carried out neat or in solution. Suitable solvents are inert organic solvents, for example aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane or octane, halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane or dichloropropane, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzenes, ethers such as diethyl ether or methyl tert-butyl ether, amides such as dimethylformamide or mixtures of these.<br>
Preference is given to carrying out the reaction in solution, in particular in a halogenated organic solvent, i.e. a halogenated aliphatic or aromatic solvent. Halogenated aliphatic solvents, in particular 1,2-dichloroethane, are preferably used.<br><br>
Suitable for use in the process according to the invention are, for example, the following organic bases: trialkylamines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, dimethylethylamine, dimethylpropylamines, dimethylbutylamines,<br>
dimethylcyclohexylamine or tributylamine; N-methylmorpholine, N-ethylmorpholine or N-methylpiperidine; N,N-dialkylanilines such as dimethylaniline, diethylaniline, methylethylaniline, N,N-dialkylamides such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide; tetraalkylureas, for example tetramethylurea or tetraethylurea; or aromatic organic bases such as pyridine, substituted pyridine, for example 2-picoline, 3-picoline or 4-picoline, quinoline, lutidine, quinaldine or mixtures of these.<br>
Bases which are preferably employed are aromatic organic bases, in particular pyridine or substituted pyridines. Most particular preference is given to using 2-picoline.<br>
The reaction is advantageously carried out by reacting from 2.0 to 1.0 mol, preferably 1.4 to 1.1 mol, of sulfur trioxide and from 4.0 to 1.6 mol of one of the abovementioned bases as mentioned above in a solvent which is inert under the conditions of the process to give the sulfur trioxide adduct. However, it is also possible to dissolve, in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions and, if appropriate, with addition of the appropriate base, sulfur trioxide adduct which has been prepared separately, and to use this solution for the further reaction. 1 mole of anthranilic isopropylamide II, in solution or neat, and from 2.0 to 0.3 mol, in particular 1.2 to 0.5 mol, of phosphorus oxychloride are added simultaneously at from 50°C to reflux temperature, preferably at from 65°C to 85°C, to the solution of the sulfur trioxide adduct. This mixture is stirred at from 50°C to reflux temperature, preferably at from 65 to 85°C, for 30 min -6 h, in particular for 30 min - 4 h. At the abovementioned reaction temperature or after cooling with water, the reaction mixture is subsequently hydrolyzed with water and worked up. To this end, the organic phase is separated off, washed with water and extracted with an aqueous base, for example inorganic bases, such as from sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, etc. and water, or, for example, organic bases such as dimethylamine, trimethylamine or diethanolamine. etc. This aqueous salt solution of I obtained by extraction may still contain some solvent which can be removed by distillation. The resulting salt solution of I can now be processed further to give presentation forms suitable for use.<br><br>
However, it is also possible to free the aqueous salt solution of I, obtained by the extraction, completely from solvent residues and water and to process the salt of I obtained in this manner further to give the presentation forms suitable for use.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to acidify the aqueous salt solution of I obtained by the extraction, for example with hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid. The precipitate of I which forms is then filtered off with suction and, if required, washed and dried. The compound I obtained in this manner can now be processed further to give the application forms.<br>
Preference is given to reacting from 2.0 to 1.0 mol, in particular 1.4 to 1.1 mol, of sulfur trioxide and from 4.0 to 1.6 mol of 2-picoline in 1,2-dichloroethane to give the sulfur trioxide adduct. 1 mole of anthranilic isopropylamide II in 1,2-dichloroethane and from 2.0 to 0.3 mol, in particular 1.2 to 0.5 mol, of phosphorus oxychloride are simultaneously added to this solution at from 50°C to reflux temperature, in particular from 65°C to 85°C. This mixture is preferably stirred at from 65°C to 85°C for 30 min - 6 h, in particular 30 min - 4 h. Work-up is subsequently carried out as explained above to give the product.<br>
Likewise, the reaction can advantageously be carried out by reacting from 2.0 to 1.0 mol, preferably 1.4 to 1.2 mol, of sulfur trioxide, from 4.0 to 1.6 mol of one of the abovementioned bases, 1 mole of anthranilic propylamide II and from 2.0 to 0.3 mol, in particular 1.2 to 0.5 mol, of phosphorus oxychloride simultaneously as mentioned above in a solvent which is inert under the process conditions, at from 50°C to reflux temperature, preferably from 65°C to 85°C. This mixture is stirred at a temperature of from 50°C to reflux temperature, preferably from 65 to 85°C, for 30 min - 6 h, in particular for 30 min - 4 h. The mixture is subsequently worked up as explained above to give the product.<br>
Preference is given to reacting from 2.0 to 1.0 mol, in particular 1.4 to 1.1 mol, of sulfur trioxide, from 4.0 to 1.6 mol of 2-picoline in 1,2-dichloroethane, 1 mole of anthranilic isopropylamide II in 1,2-dichloroethane and from 2.0 to 0.3 mol, in particular 1.2 to 0.5 mol, of phosphorus oxychloride simultaneously at from 50°C to reflux temperature, in particular at from 65°C to 85°C. This mixture is stirred at a temperature of from 50°C to reflux temperature, preferably at from 65 to 85°C, for 30 min - 6 h, in particular for 30 min - 4 h. The<br><br>
mixture is subsequently worked up as explained above to give the product.<br>
For the reaction, the ratio of base, in particular 2-picoline, to sulfur trioxide is generally chosen to be approximately 2:1.<br>
However, it is also possible to use chlorosulfonic acid instead of sulfur trioxide. In this case, the ratio of base, in particular 2-picoline, to chlorosulfonic acid is approximately 3:1.<br>
Thus, the resulting advantageous ratio of sulfur trioxide adduct formed and organic base, in particular 2-picoline, is a ratio of approximately 1:1.<br>
The solution of base in organic solvent, for example of 2-picoline in 1,2-dichlorothane, is usually of from 30 to 10% strength, preferably of from 25 to 15% strength.<br>
Moreover, the solution of anthranilic isopropylamide II in organic solvent, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, is usually of from 25 to 5% strength, preferably of from 20 to 8% strength.<br>
The base used, such as 2-picoline, and the solvent used, such as 1,2-dichloroethane, can be recovered and recycled into the process.<br>
Dry starting materials, solvents, etc. are usually employed.<br>
The process can be carried out batchwise or continuously, for example in a stirred tank battery. Preference is given to carrying out the process continuously.<br>
To this end, 1 mol/h of anthranilic isopropylamide in an inert solvent, sulfur trioxide adduct - prepared as described above in an inert solvent from 2.0 to 1.0 mol/h, preferably 1.4 to 1.1 mol/h, of sulfur trioxide and from 4.0 to 1.6 mol/h of base -and from 2.0 to 0.3 mol/h, preferably 1.2 to 0.5 mol/h, of phosphorus oxychloride are simultaneously reacted continuously, preferably at from 65°C to 85°C, in a multi-stage, preferably in a 2- to 6-stage, in particular in a 3-stage stirred tank battery, with a mean residence time of from 6.0 to 0.5 h, in particular from 4.0 to 0.5 hour. The outgoing "product stream" is continuously hydrolyzed with water at pH 0 - 1.5. After phase separation, the organic phase is extracted at pH 6 - 9 with a<br><br>
base, for example aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, aqueous potassium hydroxide solution, aqueous ammonia solution, diethanolamine. Subsequently, this aqueous phase is continuously freed from residues of the organic solvent, for example by distillative removal. The resulting salt solution of I can now be processed further to give the application forms.<br>
The solution of the sulfur trioxide adduct can be prepared in an inert solvent at from 30 to 60°C, preferably at from 35 to 50°C, in a continuous mixer circuit. To this end, base, which is dissolved in an inert solvent as described above, and sulfur trioxide, if appropriate dissolved in an inert solvent, are added continuously. The reaction mixture is mixed intimately by means of a pump. The solution of the sulfur trioxide adduct that is formed is a homogeneous liquid and is continuously removed.<br>
To recover the base that is employed, the aqueous phase which is formed during hydrolysis is adjusted to pH 10 - 11 and extracted with solvent, as mentioned above. This base/solvent mixture is dried and, if appropriate, adjusted by addition of base or solvent so that it is ready for re-use in the process.<br>
To recover the solvent, the remainder of the organic phase is, if required, dried and distilled.<br>
Preference is given to reacting 1 mol/h of anthranilic isopropylamide in 1,2-dichloroethane, 2-picoline/sulfur trioxide adduct - prepared from 2.0 to 1,0 mol/h, in particular 1.4 to 1.1 mol/h, of sulfur trioxide and from 4.0 to 1.6 mol/h of 2-picoline in 1,2-dichloroethane - and from 2.0 to 0.3 mol/h, in particular 1.2 to 0.5 mol/h, of phosphorus oxychloride simultaneously at from 50°C to reflux temperature, preferably at from 65°C to 85°C, in particular at from 70°C to 85°C. The mixture is subsequently worked up as described above to give the product.<br>
As in the batchwise process, it is possible to employ chlorosulfonic acid instead of sulfur trioxide.<br>
The 3-isopropyl-lH-2,l,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide which is preparable by this process, and salts thereof, are known crop protection agents.<br><br>

Example 7<br>
At 78°C, 100 g of 1,2-dichloroethane were initially charged in a 3-stage stirred flask battery. 593.6 g/h of a 12.5% strength solution of anthranilic isopropylamide (0.417 mol/h) in 1,2-dichloroethane, 632.3 g/h of a solution of the 2-picoline/sulfur trioxide adduct in 1,2-dichloroethane (prepared from 589.3 g/h of an 18% strength solution of 2-picoline (1.14 mol/h) in 1,2-dichloroethane and 43.0 g/h of sulfur trioxide (0.5375 mol/h)) and 39.9 g/h of phosphorus oxychloride (0.260 mol/h) were then simultaneously introduced into the first stirred flask, the content of which, after some time, flowed over into the second stirred flask, which was also kept at 78°C, and the third stirred flask, also kept at 78°C, was then filled by the overflow of the second stirred flask. Once the battery had been filled, the starting materials for the reaction were introduced into the first stirred flask for a further 2 h. The supply of starting materials was then cut and the content of the first flask was stirred for another 1.5 h, that of the second flask for another 1.0 h and that of the 3rd flask for another 0.5 h at 78°C. The reaction mixture was subsequently hydrolyzed with water. This resulted in a pH of from 1.0 to 1.3. The content of the stirred flask battery was then continuously discharged into a phase separator and the organic phase was continuously discharged into another flask and washed with about 150 ml of water. After the phases had separated, the organic phase was pumped into a 2-stage mixer/settler unit. In the first stage, the organic phase was extracted with about 150 ml of water and 67 g of aqueous sodium<br><br>
hydroxide solution (resulting in a pH of from 7 to 8). In the second stage, the organic phase was extracted with about 50 ml of water. The combined aqueous phases were concentrated by distillative removal of remaining 1,2-dichloroethane and water to give an approximately 50% strength solution.<br>
Yield:   99.4 g of the sodium salt of<br>
3-isopropyl-lH-2,l,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide<br>
(The aqueous phases obtained from the hydrolysis were made alkaline using aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (about pH 10 -11) and continuously extracted with 1,2-dichloroethane. The resulting solution of 2-picoline in 1,2-dichloroethane was subsequently freed of water by azeotropic drying under reduced pressure (at about 400 mbar), and the 2-picoline concentration was adjusted to about 18%. The solution obtained in this manner was used again for adduct formation).<br>
Example 8<br>

The filling levels of the stirred tanks were adjusted so that the total residence time was between 1.5 and 4 hours. The content of the third stirred tank flowed over continuously into another stirred tank where the reaction mixture was hydrolyzed with water at from 50°C to 70°C, resulting in a pH of from 1 to 1.4. The two-phase mixture was continuously separated. The organic phase was continuously washed with water, the phases were once again separated and the organic phase was then extracted in a 2-stage continuous mixer/settler unit, using aqueous sodium hydroxide solution in the first stage (resulting in a pH of from 7 to 8). Extraction in the second stage was carried out with a little water. The combined aqueous phases were concentrated by distillative removal of water and remaining 1,2-dichloroethane to give an approximately 50% strength solution.<br><br>

1H-2,l,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide.<br>
(The aqueous phases obtained from the hydrolysis were made alkaline using aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (about pH 10 -11) and continuously extracted with 1,2-dichloroethane. The resulting solution of 2-picoline in 1,2-dichloroethane was subsequently freed of water by azeotropic drying under reduced pressure (at about 400 mbar), and the 2-picoline concentration was adjusted to about 18%. The solution obtained in this manner was used again for adduct formation).<br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.    A process for preparing 3-isopropyl-lH-2,l,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide (I) or a salt of I<br><br>
simultaneously with sulfur trioxide of chlorosulfonic acid in the presence of an organic base or with adducts of sulfur trioxide and organic bases<br>
and<br>
phosphorus oxychloride at from 50CC to the reflux temperature, followed, optionally by conversion into its salts.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reaction is carried out in the<br>
presence of a solvent.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the anthranilic isopropylamide and,<br>
optionally the adduct of sulfur trioxide and organic base are added in a solvent.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the solvent used is a<br>
halogenated hydrocarbon.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the solvent used is 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane.<br>
6.	A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the organic base used is an<br>
aromatic organic base.<br><br>
7.	A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the<br>
organic base used is pyridine or a substituted pyridine.<br>
8.	A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the<br>
organic base used is 2-picoline.<br>
9.	A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the<br>
reaction is carried out at from 65 to 85°C.<br>
10.	A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, wherein the<br>
process is carried out continuously.<br>
A method for preparing 3-isopropy1-1H-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3H)-one 2,2-dioxide (I) or a salt of I substantially as hereinbefore described.<br><br></td>
