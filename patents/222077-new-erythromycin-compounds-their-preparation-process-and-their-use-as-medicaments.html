their use as medicaments.<br>
The present invention relates to new erythromycin derivatives, their preparation process and their use as medicaments.<br>
A subject of the invention is the compounds of formula (I):<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
in which R represents a -(CH2)nAr radical, in which n represents the number 3, 4 or 5 and Ar represents a heterocyclic radical, optionally carrying one or more substituents, chosen from the following group of radicals:<br>
and Z represents a hydrogen atom or an acid remainder, as well as their addition salts with acids.<br>
As an example of addition salts of the present derivatives with mineral or organic acids, there can be mentioned the salts formed with the following acids: acetic, propionic, trifluoroacetic, maleic, tartaric, methane-sulphonic, benzenesulphonic, p-toluenesulphonic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulphuric, phosphoric and especially stearic, ethylsuccinic and laurylsulphuric acids.<br>
The heterocyclic radical can be substituted by one or more radicals chosen from the group constituted by free, salified, esterified and amidified carboxyl radicals, hydroxyl radicals, halogen atoms, NO2 radicals, C=N radicals, linear, branched or cyclic alkyl radicals, linear or branched alkenyl or alkynyl radicals, the following radicals: O-alkyl, O-alkenyl and 0-alkynyl, S-alkyl, S-alkenyl or S-alkynyl and N-alkyl, N-alkenyl and N-alkynyl, containing up to 12 carbon atoms optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms,<br>

The products of general formula (I) possess a very good antibiotic activity on gram ® bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci.<br>
The compounds of the invention can therefore be used as<br>
medicaments in the treatment of infections caused by sensitive germs and in particular in that of staphylococcia, such as staphylococcal speticemia, malignant staphylococcia of the face or skin, pyodermititis, septic or suppurating sores, boils, anthrax, phlegmons, erysipelas and acne, staphylococcia such as primary or post-influenzal acute anginas, bronchopneumonia, pulmonary suppurations, streptococcal infections such as acute anginas, otitis, sinusitis, scarlet fever, pneumococcal infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis; brucellosis, diphtheria, gonococcal infection.<br>
The products of the present invention are also active against infections caused by germs such as Haemophilus influenzae, Rickettsia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia, Legionella, Ureaplasma, Toxoplasma or by germs of the Mycobaterium, Listeria, Meningococci and Campylobacter type.<br>
Therefore a subject of the present invention is also, as medicaments and in particular antibiotic medicaments, the products of formula (I) as defined above, as well as their addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids.<br>
A more particular subject of the invention is, as medicaments and in particular as antibiotic medicaments, the preferred products of formula (I) defined previously namely the products of Examples 1, 2, 3 and 29 to 35, as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Also a subject of the invention is the pharmaceutical compositions containing as active ingredient at least one of the medicaments defined above.<br>
These compositions can be administered by buccal, rectal or parenteral route or by local route as a topical application on the skin and mucous membranes, but the preferred administration route is the buccal route.<br>
They can be solid or liquid and can be presented in the pharmaceutical forms commonly used in human medicine, such as for example plain or sugar-coated tablets, capsules, granules, suppositories, injectable preparations, ointments, creams, gels; they are prepared according to the usual<br>
methods.  The active ingredient or ingredients can be incorporated with excipients usually employed in these pharmaceutical compositions, such as talc, gum arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, cocoa butter, aqueous or non-aqueous vehicles, fatty substances of animal or vegetable origin, paraffin derivatives, glycols, various wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents, preservatives.<br>
These compositions can also be presented in the form of a powder intended to be dissolved extemporaneously in a suitable vehicle, for example apyrogenic sterile water.<br>
The dose administered is variable according to the illness treated, the patient in question, the administration route and the product considered.  It can be, for example, comprised between 50 mg and 300 mg per day by oral route, for an adult, for the product of Example 1 or Example 2.<br>
Also a subject of the invention is a preparation process for the compounds of formula (I), characterized in that a compound of formula (II) :<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
in which Z' represents an acid remainder, is subjected to the action of a compound of formula (III):in which R is defined as previously, in order to obtain the compound of formula (IA):<br><br>
0 Z ' in which R and Z' keep their previous meaning, then if<br>
appropriate the compound of formula (IA) is subjected to the action of an agent releasing the hydroxyl function in position 2' and/or if appropriate, to the action of an acid in order to form the salt,<br>
-	the reaction of the compound of formula (II) with the<br>
compound of formula (III) takes place in a solvent such as<br>
for example acetonitrile, dimethylformamide or also<br>
tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxy ethane or dimethylsulphoxide,<br>
-	the hydrolysis of the ester function in position 2' is<br>
carried out using methanol or aqueous hydrochloric acid,<br>
-	the salification is carried out using acids according to<br>
standard processes.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) used as starting products are described and claimed in the European Patent Application 0 596 802.<br>
The compounds of formula RNH2 are generally known products, however the precise compounds used for the preparation of the products of the examples are new and are themselves a subject of the invention, their preparation is given below.<br>
The compounds of formula RNH2 can be prepared for example according to the processes described by J. Med. Chem. (1982) vol. 25 p. 947 and subsequent, Tetrahedron Letters vol. 32, No. 14, p. 1699-1702, (1991); J. Org. Chem. 54 (18)<br>

The amines used as starting products are prepared according to the following methods: A - When the chain is attached to a carbon for example<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 one can start with the corresponding aldehydes:The amines used for the preparation of the products of Examples 4, 8, 11, 12, 18, 19, 23 and 24 were prepared in this way.<br>
B - When the chain is attached to a nitrogen, the amines can be prepared in the following way:<br>
The amines used for the preparation of the products of Examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26 and 28 were prepared in this way. C - Certain amines are prepared in a particular way: the heterocycle is constructed and the chain is introduced at the same time (Example 6, 7, 10 and 27). EXAMPLES OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
Compounds were prepared containing:<br>
Product of Example 1 	 150 mg<br>
Excipient s.g.f	   1 g<br>
Detail of the excipient: starch, talc, magnesium stearate<br>
Product of Example 2 	 150 mg<br>
Excipient q.s.f	   1 g<br>
Detail of the excipient: starch, talc, magnesium stearate<br>
Product of Example 3 	 150 mg<br>
Excipient s.g.f	   1 g<br>
Detail of the excipient: starch, talc, magnesium stearate PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE INVENTION Method of dilutions in liquid medium<br>
A series of tubes is prepared into which an equal quantity of sterile nutritive medium is divided.  Increasing quantities of the product to be studied is distributed into each tube, then each tube is seeded with a bacterial strain. After incubation for twenty-four hours in a heating chamber at 37°C, the growth inhibition is evaluated by trans-illumination which permits the minimal inhibiting concentrations (M.I.C.) to be determined expressed in micrograms/cm3.<br>
