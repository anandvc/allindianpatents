COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
BIPHASIC COMPOSITION INDUCED BY POLYDEXTROSE AND SUCROSE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
GRANTED<br>
24-3-2006<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to aqueous liquid cleansing compositions which are biphasic in nature.  More                                specifically, such compositions are characterized by having (assuming they have been standing a sufficiently long period of time after shaking) both an upper aqueous layer and a separate lower aqueous layer.  In the invention, formation of the biphasic liquids is induced by use of sufficient                                           amount of polydextrose in combination with sucrose.  In a preferred embodiment, the polydextrose is within an approximate molecular weight window.  Use of sucrose widens the window of polydextrose which can be used, and lowers the levels of polydextrose necessary to achieve biphasic effect.<br><br><br>
Biphasic liquids defined by the general fact that the liquid is divided into two phases are not new.  Most of these liquids comprise one layer which is an aqueous layer and a second layer comprising a water immiscible oily material.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,718,609 (Weimer), for example, discloses a liquid detergent composition having an aqueous layer and a layer of liquid, water immiscible oily material.  When shaken, the liquid forms a temporary oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 3,810,478 (Olson Jr. et al.) discloses a two phase shampoo composition made by preparing substantially polar and lipophilic portions of a shampoo composition.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br>
 Biphasic compositions comprising an upper and lower aqueous phase are also disclosed in the art.  U.S. Serial No. 09/643,142 (Williams et al.), entitled "A Separating Multi-Phase Personal Wash Composition in a Transparent or                                        Translucent Package" discloses biphasic compositions comprising:<br>
(a)	5 % to 35 % surfactant;<br>
(b)	1 % to 12 % thickener;<br>
(c)	4 % to 20 % polyalkylene glycol; and<br>
         (d)  sufficient non-chelating mineral salt to induce phase separation.<br>
While the total amount of salt/electrolyte is not specifically discussed in the above specification, it is<br>
    apparent from the examples that the amount sufficient to<br>
induce formation of biphasic layer is at least in the order of 4 %, 5 %, 6 % and greater.  By contrast, in the subject invention, salt is not required at all for biphasic formation and, if used, is generally in an amount less than<br>
    4 % by wt, preferably about 3 % by wt. or less and more preferably about 2 % by wt. or less.  As discussed in the specification below, using small amounts of salt (i.e., about 0.5 % to 3 %, preferably 0.5 % to 1 %) does allow a smaller amount of polydextrose to be used to induce biphasic<br>
    formation.<br>
Unlike the biphasic compositions in the Williams et al. specification, the biphasic compositions of the subject invention are induced by a combination polydextrose and   sucrose (and optionally salt) .  The biphasic compositions of the invention are stable, and do not require either<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br>
thickener or polyalkylene glycol as is required by the compositions of Williams.<br>
. EP 0,116,422 (Reckett and Coleman) also discloses multi-                  layered compositions in which two liquids are dispersible and which separate on standing.  Again, at least 6 % salt/electrolyte (e.g., sodium hexamataphosphate) are required in these compositions (see page 4, lines 17-19). The biphasic liquids of the invention are induced by<br>
     polydextrose in combination with sucrose, not salt, and no salt is required, although small amounts (e.g., up to about 4 %, preferably about 3 % or less, more preferably about 1.5 % or less, more preferably about 1 % or less) may be used. Use of small amounts of salt tend to allow use of less<br>
    sucrose and/or polydextrose.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the invention (e.g., where the MW of polydextrose is above 18 00) use of some salt is preferred to help stabilise the aqueous phase which tends to                         be more opaque when higher MW polydextrose (e.g., above 1800) is used.<br>
In addition, the compositions of the subject invention are preferably used in translucent or transparent compositions   (i.e., for the sensorial benefit) and this is not taught or suggested in EP 0,116,422.<br>
The applicants have filed a co-pending application on the same date as the subject application in which biphasic     compositions are induced by the use of polydextrose alone (and optionally salt depending on levels of polydextrose).<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br><br>
The subject invention differs from this application in that the use of sucrose is required in combination with polydextrose, and this combination of polydextrose and sucrose provides greater flexibility as to amount of                                                   polydextrose used (with or without salt) .  Further, while the co-pending application requires polydextrose of defined molecular weight, it is not believed that this is required by the present invention.  However, as noted above, where the MW of polydextrose is above 1800, preferably minimal<br>
     amounts of salt, e.g., at least 0.1 %, preferably at least 0.5 %, should be used to  help stabilize the lower, more opaque layer formed from the use of higher MW polydextrose. Where no salt is used, preferably the molecular weight of polydextrose is below 1500, and more preferably below 1200.<br>
The applicants have now found that biphasic liquids (e.g., liquids which separate into top and bottom aqueous layers) may be induced by addition of sufficient quantity of specifically defined polydextrose in combination with<br>
     sucrose.  This induction can occur with or without the use of salt, although using salt may lower amount of polydextrose required (and is also preferred when the MW of polydextrose is above 1800; when such polydextrose is used, the use of stabilizer, e.g.,  xanthan gum, is also<br>
    preferred).  Very low amounts of polydextrose (e.g., as low as about 2.5 % by wt.) can be used if sucrose and/or surfactant levels are sufficiently high.<br>
More specifically, in a first embodiment the present              invention comprises liquid personal cleansing compositions comprising:<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br>
(1)  5 % to 75 %, preferably 6 % to 40 % by wt. of a<br>
surfactant selected from the group consisting of<br>
anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants,<br>
amphoteric/zwitterionic surfactants, cationic<br>
	surfactants and mixtures thereof;<br>
- (2)  at least 2.5 %, more preferably at least 10 % by<br>
wt. of polydextrose or mixture of polydextrose<br>
molecules.  It is preferred, although not required<br>
that the polydextrose has a degree of<br>
	polymerization (e.g., number of linking glucose<br>
units) of 4 to 22 (this corresponds to MW of about 600 to about 3600);<br>
(3)	at least about 2.5 % to 50 % sucrose; and<br>
(4)	the balance water and minors.<br><br>
In a second embodiment of the claims, the invention comprises compositions wherein at least 0.5 %, preferably at least 1 %, more preferably at least 2 % salt is used. Generally slightly higher salt allows use of slightly less                         polydextrose.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, when the MW of polydextrose used is above 1800, it is also preferred to use some salt.  It is further preferred to use some stabilizer                         (e.g., xanthan gum, carbopol) to stabilize the generally more opaque lower layer.<br>
The invention relates to biphasic liquid cleansing compositions wherein the formation of the biphasic liquid is                         induced by the addition of sufficient amount of polydextrose in combination with sucrose.  Preferably, the degree of<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br>
polymerization (defining number of linking glucose groups) of the polydextrose is 4 to 22.<br>
More specifically, in a preferred embodiment the invention                  comprises:<br>
(1)  5 % to 75 % by wt. of a surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic surfactant, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric/zwitterionic, cationic surfactant and mixtures thereof;<br>
       (2)  at least 2.5 %, preferably 10 % by wt. polydextrose; preferably, although not necessarily, the degree of polymerization (i.e., number of linking glucose units) of the polydextrose is 4 to 22 corresponding to a MW of<br>
	600 to 3600; preferably MW is 700 to 1800, more<br>
preferably 900 to 1500 and more preferably 900 to 1200 (at higher MW polydextrose, use of at least 0.1% to, preferably at least 0.5 % salt is preferred as is, even more preferred, use of some<br>
	additional stabilizer);<br>
(3)	at least 2.5 % sucrose; and<br>
(4)	the balance water and minors.<br>
As noted, when polydextrose of MW above 1800 is used, some                                                                         salt is preferably used.<br>
    The general concept behind the invention is that, when a sufficient amount of specified polydextrose is added in combination with sucrose, phase separation occurs.  The 30  sucrose lowers the level of polydextrose need to achieve the<br><br>
WO 2004/018609	PCT/EP2003/008638<br>
effect.  Different surfactant systems can be used, and the specific type of surfactants is not a limiting factor.<br>
The inventive compositions may be used in combination with a transparent package in order to view the liquid.  Thus, in one embodiment, the invention also comprises a system comprising said transparent or translucent package in combination with the liquid.<br>
    Typically, once the biphasic composition is formed (e.g., the composition "settles" after having been shaken), the viscosity of the lower layer is lower than that of the upper layer.<br>
    Also, the density of lower layer is typically greater than that of upper layer.<br>
Typically, in such biphasic liquids, there is no recrystallization visible after the composition has been standing for 6 months at room temperature.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, a small amount of salt is used, and the amount of polydextrose needed to induce biphasic liquid may be reduced.  More specifically,                                       in this embodiment, the composition comprises at least 0.5 % salt and at least 2.5 % polydextrose.<br>
In a third embodiment, the polydextrose is of MW above 1800 and some salt (at least 0.1 %, preferably at least 0.5 %) is             used.  More preferably, some stabilizer is added to this embodiment.<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>

The various components of the composition are discussed in greater detail below.<br>
The surfactant will generally comprise 5 % to 75 % by wt. of   the total composition.<br>
The surfactant is a surfactant which may be selected from the group consisting of anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, amphoteric/zwitterionic surfactants, cationic                             surfactants and mixtures thereof.  Preferably, there will be at least one anionic surfactant.<br>

Cationic  surfactants are another useful class of  surfactants                                            20     that can be employed as auxiliary agents.     They are<br>
          particularly useful as additives to  enhance  skin feel,   and provide skin conditioning benefits.     One class of  cationic surfactants  is the heterocyclic  ammonium salts such as cetyl or stearyl pyridinium chloride,   alkyl amidoethyl                                             25     pyrrylinodium methyl  sulfate,   lapyrium chloride.<br><br>
30<br><br>
Tetra alkyl ammonium salts is another useful class of cationic surfactants.  Examples include cetyl or stearyl trimethyl ammonium chloride or bromide; hydrogenated palm or tallow trimethyl ammonium halides; behenyl trimethyl ammonium halides or methyl sulfates; decyl isononyl dimethyl ammonium<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br>
halides; ditallow (or distearyl) dimethyl ammonium halides; behenyl dimethy ammonium chloride.<br><br>
10<br><br>
Other types of cationic surfactants that can be employed are the various ethoxylated quaternary amines and ester quats. Examples are PEG-5 stearyl ammonium lactate (e.g., Genamin KSL manufactured by Clarion) , PEG-2 coco ammonium chloride, PEG-15 hydrogenated tallow ammonium chloride, PEG 15 stearyl ammonium chloride, dialmitoyl ethyl methyl ammonium chloride, dipalmitoyl hydroxyethyl methyl sulfate, strearyl amidopropyl dimethylamine lactate.<br><br><br><br>
15<br><br>
Still other useful cationic surfactants are quaternized hydrolysates of silk, wheat, and keratin proteins.<br>
The compound which added to the formulation to induce formation of biphasic (multiphasic) liquid is polydextrose. Generally, the polydextrose has a formulation as follows:<br><br>
20<br><br><br>
25<br><br>
30  wherein n (defining number of linking glucose units) is preferably, but not necessarily, from about 4 to about 22<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT7EP2003/008638<br><br>
The preferred biphasic inducing polydextrose compounds of the invention noted above may also be defined by molecular weight in that they should have MW range of from 600 to                 5  about 3,600, more preferably 700 to 3,000, more preferably 700 to 1,800, more preferably 900 to 1,500, even more preferably 900 to 1,200.<br>
It should be understood that the critical point is that the  10  structure is such as to induce formation of a<br>
multiphasic/biphasic formulation defined by those characteristics which in turn define the biphasic liquid (e.g., viscosity and stability in the biphasic state).<br>
15  The amount of polydextrose used to induce biphasic state may vary depending on whether salt/electrolyte is used. Further, salt is preferably used (as well as stabilizer) if MW of polydextrose is sufficiently high.<br>
20  Generally, whether or not salt is used (use of no or little salt also distinguishes this invention from other biphasic liquids of the art where relatively large amounts of salt, e.g., greater than 3 % by wt., are in fact required to induce the biphasic liquid), there is needed at least 2.5 %<br>
25  by wt., preferably at least 10 % by wt. of polydextrose to induce biphasic separation.  Generally, if less than 10 % polydextrose is used, at least 2 % salt will be needed.<br>
    There is generally a balance between the amount of                          30  surfactant used and the amount of polydextrose or sucrose.   Generally lower surfactant requires more polydextrose or<br><br>
WO 2004/018609	PCT/EP2003/008638<br>
sucrose and, conversely, more surfactant requires less polydextrose or sucrose.<br>
Generally, the upper limit of polydextrose used is about 75 5  %.  This is not an upper limit with regard to inducing biphasic liquid.<br>
In addition, there is some interplay between molecular weight of polydextrose and use of salt.  Thus, although not                              10  required, if MW of polydextrose is above 1800, preferably at least 0.1 %, more preferably at least 0.5 %, salt should be used.  This is because the higher MW polydextrose tends to form a more opaque lower layer which salt helps stabilize.<br>
15  In this embodiment, it is even further preferred to add<br>
stabilizers.  Among the stabilizers which are preferred, but not necessarily used, include gums such as xanthan gum, guar gum or chemically modified guar gums.  Other stabilizers include hydrophobically modified polyethers, hydrophobically<br>
20  modified acrylates and hydrophobically modified<br>
polyurethanes, all of which are described in the "optional" section below.  If used, the stabilizers may comprise 0.01 % to 3.0 %, preferably 0.01 % to 1.0 % by wt. of the composition.<br>
25<br>
A third requirement of the invention is sucrose.  Generally, sucrose will have structure as follows:<br><br>
WO 2004/018609	PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br><br>
Generally, at least 2.5 %, preferably at least 10 % sucrose   is used, and levels can be as high as 5 %, preferably no higher than 4 0 %.<br>
If electrolyte/salt is used, it typically will be used in amount of 0.5 % to no higher than 4 %, preferably no higher                    than about 3 % by wt. of total composition.  However, if less than about 10 % polydextrose is used, generally at least about 2 % salt is needed.<br>
Preferably, the electrolyte is not a chelating electrolyte   (these are generally poor in biodegradability) .<br>
Typically, the electrolyte should be a salt of a sulphate, bisulfate, carbonate, bicarbonate, phosphate, chloride, etc. Examples include sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate,               ammonium sulphate, sodium chloride, and magnesium chloride. Magnesium sulphate and sodium chloride are particularly preferred.<br>
Finally, the balance of composition is water and minors,<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br>
The following optional ingredients may be used in the multiphasic/biphasic compositions of the invention.<br>
The composition may contain polyalkylene glycol.  The polyalkylene glycol should be an alcohol, glycol or polyether of minimal molecular weight which is not irritating to the skin.<br>
Examples of such include alcohols, particularly polyalkylene  oxides having MW 200 to 6,000, preferably 200 to 3,000. The polyalkylene glycol can be comprised of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or their mixtures either as polymers or copolymers.  Specific examples include polyethylene glycols such as PEG 400.  As noted, use of such                                  alcohols is not required.<br>
The composition may further comprise thickeners.  Generally, the thickener/viscosity modifier serves to thicken the upper and/or lower layer. As noted above, when MW of polydextrose                         is above 1,800, use of stabilizer/thickeners (as well as salt) are particularly preferred.<br>
Thickeners which may be used, generally, include hydrophobically modified polyethers.  Examples of this class                               of thickeners which may be used include but are not limited to sugar esters such as PEG (160) sorbitan triisostearate (Rheodol TWS -399C ex Kao Chemicals) or PEG-120 Pentaerythrityl Tetrastearate ex Croda.  Other examples include Glucam DOE 120 (PEG 120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate);<br>
  Rewoderm® (PEG modified glyceryl cocoate, palmate or<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br>
tallowate) from Rewo Chemicals; Antil® 141 (from Goldschmidt) ; and Carbopol® polymers from Noveon.<br>
Another class of suitable polymers are hydrophobically            modified cellulose ethers including but not limited to<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and cellulose ethers with long pendant chains such as nonoxynyl hydroxyethylcellulose (Amerchol Polymer HM 1500) .<br>
    Another class of suitable polymers are the hydrophobically modified acrylate copolymers such as Antil 208® (ex Goldschmidt) (acrylate/steareth-50 acrylate copolymer).<br>
Another class of suitable polymers are the hydrophobically   modified polyurethanes such as Acrysol series (e.g., Acrysol RM-2020) from Rhom and Haas.<br>
Another class of suitable thickeners are xanthan gums, guar gums and chemically modified guar gums.<br>
In addition to the ingredients noted above, the compositions of the invention may contain hydrotropes including but not limited to short chain monohydric or dihydric alcohols, xylene sulphonate and hexylene glycol. Their purpose is to<br>
    avoid the formation of liquid crystal phases resulting from the separation of the surfactant material into the upper phase, hence increasing its apparent concentration.<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br>
The compositions may comprise benefit agents.  Benefit agent may be any material that has potential to provide an effect on, for example, the skin.<br>
  The benefit agent may be water insoluble material that can protect, moisturize or condition the skin upon deposition from compositions of invention.  These may include silicone oils and gums, fats and oils, waxes, hydrocarbons (e.g., petrolatum), higher fatty acids and esters, vitamins,                             sunscreens.  They may include any of the agents, for<br>
example, mentioned at column 8, line 31 to column 9, line 13 of U.S. Patent No. 5,759,969.<br>
The benefit agent may also be a water-soluble material such as glycerin, polyols (e.g., saccharides), enzyme and a-  or P-hydroxy acid either alone or entrapped in an oily benefit agent.<br>
The benefit agent may be found in either the upper or the lower layer depending on its solubility and partition<br>
coefficient; for example, oil may partition into the upper layer while more water soluble agents (e.g., -hydroxyacids) may go into the lower.<br>
     The compositions may comprise perfumes, sequestering agents such as EDTA EHDP in amounts 0.01 % to 1 %, preferably 0.01 % to 0.05 %; colouring agents, opacifiers and pearlizers such as zinc stearate, magnesium stearate, TiQ.2, mica, EGMS (ethylene glycol monostrearate) or styrene/acrylate<br>
copolymers.<br><br>
WO 2004/018609<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br><br>
The compositions may further comprise antimicrobials such as<br>
2-hydroxy 4,2' 4'    trichlorodiphenylether (DP300) , 3,4,4' -<br>
trichlorocarbanilide, essential oils and preservatives such as dimethyl hydantoin (Glydant XL 1000), parabens, sorbic                 acid etc.<br>
The compositions may also comprise coconut acyl mono or diethanol amides as suds boosters, and strongly ionizing salts such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate may also be              used to advantage.<br>
Antioxidants such as, for example, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) may be used advantageously in amounts of about 0.01 % or higher if appropriate. <br>
Cationic conditioners which may be used including Quatrisoft LM-200 Polyquaternium-24, Merquat Plus 3330- Polyquaternium<br>
39; and Jaguar® type conditioners.<br>
     Compositions may also include clays such as Bentonite®<br>
clays, as well as particulates such as abrasives, glitter, and shimmer.<br>
 The compositions of the invention, when unmixed, may have a       viscosity of the lower layer which is lower than the<br>
viscosity of the upper layer, and may have a density of the lower layer which is greater than the density of the upper layer.<br><br>
PCT/EP2003/008638<br>
WO 2004/018609<br>
The compositions of the invention, in a separated state, are also stable in that no recrystallization (e.g., in the lower layer) occurs even when left sitting for more than 6 months , at temperature of 0°C. <br>
Compositions of the invention have an experiential element in that they are intended to be agitated by the consumer to mix and form a single visible phase before separating again after a time, anywhere from about a few seconds to not more                      than about 24 hours.<br>
When mixed, the compositions have a viscosity in the range of 100 to 700 cps/mPas at 25°C is measured using RV spindle #2 at 10 RPM.<br><br>
Finally, the packages in which the compositions are contained are preferably translucent or transparent.  By this is meant that the materials (e.g., plastics) have a light transmittance of greater than 50 %, preferably greater<br>
    than 75 %, more preferably greater than 85 % as measured at wavelength of 460 nm as determined by standard spectroscopic methods.  In practical terms the package should be sufficiently transparent to permit the separation of the two or more layers to be visible to the naked eye.<br><br>

Formulation Preparation<br>
A simple solution of each ingredient was prepared at about 5 wt.% to about 60 wt.% without any saccharides.  Then solutions were added to the desired level.  After adding all the solutions, samples were mixed and shaken to insure mixture was homogeneous.  The samples were left undisturbed for 24 hours at room temperature, and observations then made.<br>
Viscosity &amp; Product Appearance<br>
Formulations were screened for viscosity using standard PW protocols as set forth in methodology section above.  The formulations were observed for any discoloration and re-crystallisation of saccharides at room temperature.<br>
