Printable etching media for silicon dioxide<br>
and silicon nitride layers<br>
The present invention relates to novel compositions in the form of print-<br>
able etching media having non-Newtonian flow behaviour for the etching<br>
of surfaces in applications for the production of solar cells, and to the<br>
use thereof. The present invention furthermore also relates to composi-<br>
tions in the form of etching and doping media which are suitable both for<br>
the etching of extremely fine lines or structures in inorganic layers and<br>
also for the doping of underlying layers. In particular, they are corre-<br>
sponding particle-containing compositions by means of which extremely<br>
fine lines and structures can be etched very selectively without damag-<br>
ing or attacking adjacent areas.<br>
Prior art and object of the invention<br>
During the process for the production of solar cells, it is necessary, inter<br>
alia, to structure oxide layers on a support material. A crystalline silicon<br>
solar cell usually consists of a p-conducting substrate, into which a ho-<br>
mogeneously thick layer of an n-conducting substance, for example<br>
phosphorus, is diffused on the front. A metallically conducting contact is<br>
applied to the front and back of the wafer in order to conduct away the<br>
current produced on incidence of light. With a view to an inexpensive<br>
production method which is suitable for mass production, the contact is<br>
usually produced by screen printing.<br>
Besides the oxide layers that have to be structured during solar cell<br>
production, silicon nitride layers also have to be etched. For etching cor-<br>
responding nitride layers, the methods used have to be modified and<br>
the etching pastes adapted in a suitable manner.<br>
The surfaces of crystalline silicon solar cells are coated with thin in-<br>
organic layers during the production process, and optionally also after<br>
the end thereof. These layers have thicknesses in the range from 20 to<br>
200 nm, in most cases in the range from 50 to 150 nm.<br><br>
During the process for the production of crystalline silicon solar cells, it<br>
is therefore advantageous in a number of process steps to etch fine<br>
lines into these inorganic layers of the solar cell.<br>
These openings in the surface of the solar cell can be used, for exam-<br>
ple, for the production of a so-called selective emitter, also known as<br>
2-stage emitter. To this end, a high degree of n-doping, preferably by<br>
means of phosphorus diffusing in, is produced in a subsequent diffusion<br>
step in the partial openings of a diffusion barrier located on the silicon.<br>
In the present description, the term inorganic surfaces-is taken to mean<br>
oxidic and nitride-containing compounds of silicon, in particular silicon<br>
oxide and silicon nitride surfaces. The mode of action of such diffusion<br>
barriers is known to the person skilled in the art and is described in the<br>
literature [A. Goetzberger; B. VoB; J. Knobloch, Sonnenenergie: Photo-<br>
voltaik [Solar Energy: Photovoltaics], Teubner Studienbucher Stuttgart<br>
1997, pp 40; 107]. These diffusion barriers can be produced in a variety<br>
of ways:<br>
Very dense silicon dioxide layers are obtained, for example, by heat<br>
treatment of silicon in an oxygen-containing atmosphere at tempera-<br>
tures in the region of 900°C (thermal oxide).<br>
Also known to the person skilled in the art is the deposition of silicon di-<br>
oxide by CVD processes. Depending on the way the reaction is carried<br>
out, a distinction is made here between, inter alia, the following proc-<br>
esses:<br>
-	APCVD (atmospheric pressure CVD)<br>
-	PE-CVD (plasma enhanced CVD)<br>
-	LP-CVD (low pressure CVD)<br>
A common feature of these processes is that the desired inorganic<br>
compound is obtained from the gas phase of a volatile precursor, for<br>
example silane (SiH4) or TEOS (tetraethyl orthosilicate) in the case of<br>
silicon dioxide, by deposition of the precursor on the target substrate<br>
with decomposition.<br><br>
Silicon dioxide layers which form a diffusion barrier can also be obtained<br>
by means of wet-chemical coating with a liquid or dissolved solid pre-<br>
cursor in a solvent or solvent mixture. These liquid systems are usually<br>
applied to the substrate to be coated by spin coating. These systems<br>
are known to the person skilled in the art as spin-on-glass (SOG).<br>
In many cases, the SiO2 layer applied also remains as reflection-reduc-<br>
ing passivation layer. This is particularly frequently the case for ther-<br>
mally grown SiO2.<br>
Silicon nitride layers are used less as diffusion barriers in the art of crys-<br>
talline solar cells, although they are in principle likewise suitable for this<br>
purpose. Silicon nitride layers are mainly used as passivation and anti-<br>
reflection layers.<br>
It is also advantageous in the production of crystalline silicon solar cells<br>
to be able to produce openings in a targeted manner in the silicon ni-<br>
tride layers. An example which may be mentioned here is the applica-<br>
tion of electrically conductive pastes. These metal pastes are usually<br>
"fired through" the silicon nitride layer at temperatures in the region of<br>
600°C, facilitating an electrical contact to the emitter layer. Due to the<br>
high temperatures, polymer-based (epoxy or phenolic resin) metallisa-<br>
tion pastes cannot be used. Crystal defects and metallic contamination<br>
in the underlying silicon also arise in the "fire-through process". Due to<br>
the system, the passivation layer is additionally completely destroyed by<br>
the overlying printed-on metal paste. A partial, narrower opening of the<br>
silicon nitride layer for electrical contacting would be more advanta-<br>
geous, with retention of the passivation layer in the edge regions, which<br>
are covered by the overlying metallisation layer.<br>
Besides the pure diffusion barriers consisting of silicon dioxide or silicon<br>
nitride, it is also possible to use thin glass layers in the production of<br>
crystalline silicon solar cells.<br><br>
Definition of glass:<br>
Glass is taken to mean per se a homogeneous material, for example<br>
quartz, window glass, borosilicate glass, and also thin layers of these<br>
materials produced on other substrates (for example ceramics, metal<br>
sheets, silicon wafers) by various processes known to the person skilled<br>
in the art (CVD, PVD, spin-on, thermal oxidation, inter alia).<br>
The term glasses below is taken to mean silicon oxide- and silicon ni-<br>
tride-containing materials which are in the solid amorphous physical<br>
state without crystallisation of the glass components and which have a<br>
high degree of structural disorder in the microstructure owing to the lack<br>
of long-range order.<br>
Besides pure SiO2 glass (quartz), all glasses (for example doped<br>
glasses, such as borosilicate, phosphosilicate and borophosphosilicate<br>
glasses, coloured, milk and crystal glasses, optical glasses) which com-<br>
prise SiO2 and other components, in particular elements such as, for<br>
example, calcium, sodium, aluminium, lead, lithium, magnesium, bar-<br>
ium, potassium, boron, beryllium, phosphorus, gallium, arsenic, anti-<br>
mony, lanthanum, zinc, thorium, copper, chromium, manganese, iron,<br>
cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, titanium, gold, platinum, palla-<br>
dium, silver, cerium, caesium, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, neo-<br>
dymium, praseodymium, which occur in the glasses in the form of ox-<br>
ides, carbonates, nitrates, phosphates, sulfates and/or halides or func-<br>
tion as doping elements in the glasses, are also encompassed. Doped<br>
glasses are, for example, borosilicate, phosphosilicate, boro-<br>
phosphosilicate, coloured, milk and crystal glasses and optical glasses.<br>
The silicon nitride may likewise comprise other elements, such as bo-<br>
ron, aluminium, gallium, indium, phosphorus, arsenic or antimony.<br>
Definition of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems: Silicon ox-<br>
ide-based systems are defined below as all crystalline systems which<br>
do not fall under the definition of amorphous SiO2 glasses given above<br>
and are based on silicon dioxide; these can be, in particular, the salts<br>
and esters of orthosilicic acid and condensation products thereof - gen-<br><br>
erally known as silicates by the person skilled in the art - as well as<br>
quartz and glass-ceramics.<br>
Furthermore, other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems, in<br>
particular the salts and esters of orthosilicic acid and condensation<br>
products thereof, are encompassed. Besides pure SiO2 (quartz,<br>
tridymite, cristobalite), all SiO2-based systems built up from SiO2 or "dis-<br>
crete" and/or linked [SiO4] tetrahedra, such as, for example, meso-<br>
silicates, sorosilicates, cyclosilicates, inosilicates, phyllosilicates, tecto-<br>
silicates, and comprising other components, in particular elements/-<br>
components such as, for example, calcium, sodium, aluminium, lithium,<br>
magnesium, barium, potassium, beryllium, scandium, manganese, iron,<br>
titanium, zirconium, zinc, cerium, yttrium, oxygen, hydroxyl groups and<br>
halides, are also encompassed.<br>
Silicon nitride-based systems are defined below as all crystalline and<br>
partially crystalline (usually referred to as microcrystalline) systems<br>
which do not fall under the definition given above for the amorphous sili-<br>
con nitride glasses/layers. These include Si3N4 in its α-Si3N4 and<br>
β-Si3N4 modifications and all crystalline and partially crystalline SiNx and<br>
SiNx:H layers. Crystalline silicon nitride may comprise other elements,<br>
such as boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, phosphorus, arsenic and an-<br>
timony.<br>
Etching of structures<br>
The use of etchants, i.e. chemically aggressive compounds, results in<br>
the dissolution of the material exposed to the etchant attack. In most<br>
cases, the aim is completely to remove the layer to be etched. The end<br>
of the etching is reached by the encountering of a layer which is sub-<br>
stantially resistant to the etchant. In addition, there is the process known<br>
to the person skilled in the art of partial removal of a layer by etching to<br>
a target thickness which is usually defined.<br>
Etching of structures on silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses<br>
and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems:<br><br>
According to the current state of the art, any desired structures can be<br>
etched selectively in silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and<br>
other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems or surfaces thereof<br>
and layers thereof of variable thickness directly by laser-supported etch-<br>
ing methods or, after masking, by wet-chemical methods ([1] D.J. Monk,<br>
D.S. Soane, R.T. Howe, Thin Solid Films 232 (1993), 1; [2] J. Buhler,<br>
F.-P. Steiner, H. Baltes, J. Micromech. Microeng. 7 (1997), R1) or by<br>
dry-etching methods ([3] M. Kohler "Atzverfahren fur die Mikrotechnik"<br>
[Etching Methods for Microtechnology], Wiley VCH 1983).<br>
In the laser-supported etching methods, the laser beam scans the entire<br>
etching pattern on the glass dot by dot or line by line in the case of vec-<br>
tor-orienting systems, which, besides a high degree of precision, also<br>
requires considerable adjustment effort and time.<br>
The wet-chemical and dry-etching methods include material-intensive,<br>
time-consuming and expensive process steps:<br>
A.	Masking of the areas not to be etched, for example by:<br>
•	photolithography: Production of a negative or positive of the etching<br>
structure (depending on the resist), coating of the substrate surface<br>
(for example by spin-coating with a liquid photoresist), drying of the<br>
photoresist, exposure of the coated substrate surface, development,<br>
rinsing, optionally drying<br>
B.	Etching of the structures by:<br>
•	dip methods (for example wet etching in wet-chemistry benches): dip-<br>
ping of the substrates into the etching bath, etching operation, re-<br>
peated rinsing in H2O cascade sinks, drying<br>
•	spin-on or spray methods: the etching solution is applied to a rotating<br>
substrate, the etching operation can be carried out without/with input<br>
of energy (for example IR or UV irradiation), this is followed by rinsing<br>
and drying<br><br>
• dry-etching methods, such as, for example, plasma etching, in expen-<br>
sive vacuum units or etching with reactive gases in flow reactors<br>
C. Removal of the photoresist:<br>
In a final process step, the photoresist covering the protecting areas of<br>
the substrate must be removed. This can be carried out by means of<br>
solvents, such as, for example, acetone, or dilute aqueous alkaline solu-<br>
tions. The substrates are finally rinsed and dried.<br>
Full-area etching of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and<br>
other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems:<br>
In order to etch silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and<br>
other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems and layers of vari-<br>
able thickness thereof over the entire area completely or only to a cer-<br>
tain depth, use is predominantly made of wet-etching methods. The sili-<br>
con oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and other silicon oxide- and<br>
silicon nitride-based systems and layers of variable thickness thereof<br>
are dipped into etching baths, which usually contain the toxic and highly<br>
caustic hydrofluoric acid and optionally additives of other mineral acids.<br>
The disadvantages of the etching methods described lie in the time-<br>
consuming, material-intensive and expensive process steps which are<br>
in some cases complex in technological and safety terms and are fre-<br>
quently carried out discontinuously.<br>
International Application WO 01/83391 A describes etching media in the<br>
form of printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having<br>
non-Newtonian flow behaviour for the etching of inorganic, glass-like<br>
amorphous or crystalline surfaces, in particular of glasses or ceramics,<br>
preferably SiO2- or silicon nitride-based systems, and the use of these<br>
etching media. In particular on printing of surfaces, use of these parti-<br>
cle-free media gave rise to problems due to inadequate resilience of the<br>
printed lines, dots or structures (inadequate structure fidelity), meaning<br><br>
that a significant broadening of the originally printed lines occurs (bleed-<br>
ing of the etching species on the substrate).<br>
US 5,688,366 A uses particle-containing etching pastes for etching a<br>
transparent conductive layer (for example ITO). The etching pastes<br>
used are prepared from molten iron chloride containing water of crystal-<br>
lisation, glycerol and polymer particles. These compositions are suitable<br>
for etching lines having a width of about 1 mm. Experiments have<br>
shown that these etching pastes are not suitable for etching very thin<br>
lines having a width of less than 1 mm cleanly and without flaws, irre-<br>
spective of whether polymer particles having a diameter of 0.01 urn or of<br>
30 urn are employed for the preparation of the pastes.<br>
Objective<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide novel, inex-<br>
pensive etching pastes for etching very uniform thin lines having a width<br>
of less than 100 urn, in particular of less than 80 urn, and extremely fine<br>
structures on silicon dioxide and/or silicon nitride layers which are lo-<br>
cated on silicon solar cells. A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide novel etching media which can be removed from the treated<br>
surfaces after the etching, if necessary under the action of heat, in a<br>
simple manner without leaving residues.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
More recent experiments have now shown that, contrary to experience<br>
to date, the technical printing properties of etching pastes can advanta-<br>
geously be improved if suitable, selected finely particulate powders are<br>
added. The addition of inorganic, finely particulate powders has proven<br>
particularly suitable. These can be incorporated into the etching media<br>
together with suitable polymer particles. In particular, inorganic powders<br>
can be incorporated together with polymer particles which form a net-<br>
work in the resultant pastes by physical interaction and/or chemical re-<br>
action with the other constituents of the medium, at the same time re-<br>
sulting in an increase in the viscosity of the composition. Entirely un-<br><br>
expectedly, the added polymer particles contribute to an improvement in<br>
the printability of the medium, while the added inorganic particles have<br>
an advantageous effect on the subsequent cleaning step.<br>
Accordingly, the present object is achieved through the use of corre-<br>
sponding powders in compositions for the etching of inorganic, glass-<br>
like or crystalline surfaces selected from the group of glasses based on<br>
silicon oxide and glasses based on silicon nitride.<br>
Given a suitable choice of the added particulate components, it may<br>
even be possible completely to omit the addition of a thickener, which is<br>
usually homogeneously distributed in known particle-free pastes. Con-<br>
trary to ail expectations and surprisingly for the person skilled in the art,<br>
the compositions according to the invention in the form of pastes can be<br>
printed to give extremely fine, uniform and homogeneous lines and<br>
structures.<br>
The object of the present application is therefore also achieved by the<br>
provision of a novel printable composition in the form of a paste for the<br>
etching of inorganic, glass-like or crystalline surfaces selected from the<br>
group of glasses based on silicon oxide and glasses based on silicon ni-<br>
tride, which comprises inorganic, finely particulate powders and option-<br>
ally polymer powders consisting of a material selected from the group<br>
polystyrene, polyacrylate, polyamide, polyimide, polymethacrylate,<br>
melamine resin, urethane resin, benzoguanine resin, phenolic resin,<br>
silicone resin, fluorinated polymers (PTFE, PVDF, inter alia) and mi-<br>
cronised wax, in the presence of at least one etching component, sol-<br>
vents, thickeners, optionally at least one inorganic and/or organic acid,<br>
and optionally additives, such as antifoams, thixotropic agents, flow-<br>
control agents, deaerators, adhesion promoters, and which is active at<br>
temperatures in the range from 30 to 500°C or can optionally be acti-<br>
vated by input of energy. Preferred groups of particles which are used in<br>
the etching compositions according to the invention in the form of<br>
pastes are the subject-matter of Claims 2-11. Features of the compo-<br>
sitions prepared using the finely particulate powders are the subject-<br>
matter of Claims 12 to 26. The present invention furthermore relates to<br><br>
a process for the etching of inorganic, glass-like, crystalline surfaces in<br>
accordance with Claims 27 to 30.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Experiments have shown that the use of finely particulate powders in<br>
etching compositions in the form of pastes enables both the behaviour<br>
of the pastes during the printing process and also the achievable etch-<br>
ing result to be significantly improved. Surprisingly, it has been found<br>
that the addition of selected finely particulate powders may considerably<br>
improve the edge sharpness of the etched lines or structures, but also<br>
favourably influences the properties of the compositions with respect to<br>
the stability of the printed lines or structures.<br>
The present invention thus relates, in particular, to the use of finely par-<br>
ticulate inorganic and/or organic powders in compositions for the etch-<br>
ing of inorganic, glass-like or crystalline surfaces selected from the<br>
group of glasses based on silicon oxide and glasses based on silicon ni-<br>
tride, in particular corresponding layers which are of importance in<br>
photovoltaics.<br>
The present invention thus also relates, in particular, to compositions in<br>
the form of a printable etching paste for the etching and optionally for<br>
the doping of inorganic glass-like or crystalline layers selected from the<br>
group of glasses based on silicon dioxide and glasses based on silicon<br>
nitride, which are located on crystalline or amorphous silicon surfaces,<br>
in which<br>
a)	at least one etching component,<br>
b)	at least one solvent,<br>
c)	at least one inorganic powder in the form of finely particulate graph-<br>
ite and/or carbon black, and optionally finely particulate organic<br>
powder in the form of finely particulate plastic powders selected from<br>
the group of polystyrenes, polyacrylates, polyamides, polyimides,<br>
polymethacrylates, melamine resin, urethane resin, benzoguanine<br>
resin, phenolic resin, silicone resins, micronised cellulose and fluori-<br>
nated polymers (PTFE, PVDF),<br><br>
and optionally micronised wax,<br>
and optionally inorganic particles from the group aluminium oxides,<br>
calcium fluoride, boron oxide, sodium chloride,<br>
d)	at least one fluxing agent additive,<br>
e)	optionally a homogeneously dissolved organic thickener,<br>
f)	optionally at least one inorganic and/or organic acid, and optionally<br>
g)	additives, such as antifoams, thixotropic agents, flow-control agents,<br>
deaerators, adhesion promoters,<br>
are present.<br>
In accordance with the invention, corresponding printable etching media<br>
comprise, in particular, at least one inorganic powder in the form of<br>
finely particulate graphite and/or carbon black and/or finely particulate<br>
organic powder in the form of finely particulate plastic powders selected<br>
from the group<br>
polystyrenes, polyacrylates, polyamides, polyimides, polymethacrylates,<br>
melamine resin, urethane resin, benzoguanine resin, phenolic resin, sili-<br>
cone resins, micronised cellulose, fluorinated polymers (PTFE, PVDF)<br>
and optionally micronised waxes,<br>
and optionally inorganic particles selected from the group aluminium ox-<br>
ide, calcium fluoride, boron oxide, sodium chloride.<br>
Particularly suitable in accordance with the invention are compositions<br>
which comprise an inorganic powder whose particles have a relative di-<br>
ameter of 
Finely particulate organic powders present therein can have a relative<br>
particle diameter in the range from 10 nm to 50 urn. However, prefer-<br>
ence is given to the incorporation into the media of organic powders<br>
having a relative particle diameter in the range from 100 nm to 30 urn<br>
and very particularly preferably from 1 urn to 10 urn.<br>
Depending on the desired area of application, the etching media may<br>
comprise powders in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, based on the to-<br>
tal amount. For the printing and etching of thin lines and fine structures,<br>
use can be made of etching media which comprise powders in an<br>
amount of 10 to 50% by weight, in particular in an amount of 20 to 40%<br><br>
by weight, based on the total amount, where inorganic powder having a<br>
relative particle diameter of 
an amount of at least 0.5 to 5% by weight, based on the total amount of<br>
the etching medium.<br>
The etching media according to the invention comprise at least one<br>
etching component. It has been found in practice that suitable etching<br>
media may comprise one or more etching components in an amount of<br>
12 to 30% by weight, based on the total amount. Good results are<br>
achieved with etching media in which the latter are present in an<br>
amount in the range from 2 to 20% by weight. Particular preference is<br>
given to the use of media in which the proportion of etching components<br>
is in the range from 5 to 15% by weight, based on the total amount,<br>
since these compositions result in very selective etching results at the<br>
desired high etching rates.<br>
The particulate powders added to the compositions effect an increase in<br>
the viscosity. This is associated with improved printing properties and<br>
the possibility of printing and etching finer lines and structures. Since<br>
the compositions applied to the surfaces to be treated after printing dur-<br>
ing the etching process have a lower tendency to bleed, more precise<br>
lines can be etched. This is all the more surprising since earlier at-<br>
tempts to use particulate thickeners in the compositions gave qualita-<br>
tively unsuitable etching results. The more recent experiments have<br>
now shown that added finely particulate powders and the other compo-<br>
nents must interact with one another in such a way that, after intensive<br>
mixing of the individual components, a homogeneous mixture is formed<br>
which has a suitable viscosity which facilitates simple printing of the<br>
pastes, but no longer allows bleeding.<br>
In order to adjust the viscosity and in order to achieve an advantageous<br>
printing behaviour, additional thickeners may be incorporated into the<br>
etching media in an amount of 0.5 - 25% by weight, based on the total<br>
amount. These can be one or more homogeneously dissolved thicken-<br>
ers from the group<br>
cellulose/cellulose derivatives and/or<br>
starch/starch derivatives and/or<br><br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone<br>
polymers based on acrylates or functionalised vinyl units.<br>
Preference is given to the addition of thickeners in an amount of 3 to<br>
20% by weight, based on the total amount of the etching medium.<br>
As is known from the literature, various etching media components<br>
which have an etching action are also suitable for the doping of semi-<br>
conductor layers. It has therefore proven advantageous for the printable<br>
etching paste compositions according to the invention to comprise one<br>
or more forms of phosphoric acid, phosphoric acid salts or compounds<br>
which are decomposed to the corresponding phosphoric acid on heat-<br>
ing. Since doping by the phosphoric acids can also occur at very high<br>
temperatures, this has the advantage that etching and subsequent dop-<br>
ing of the underlying, exposed layer can be carried out directly succes-<br>
sively through the use of only one composition.<br>
The present invention thus relates to a composition in the form of a<br>
paste which comprises at least one inorganic mineral acid selected from<br>
the group hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid<br>
as etching component and/or optionally at least one organic acid, which<br>
may contain a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having 1 - 10 C<br>
atoms, selected from the group of the alkylcarboxylic acids, the hydroxy-<br>
carboxylic acids and the dicarboxylic acids. Suitable organic acids are<br>
those selected from the group formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid and<br>
oxalic acid.<br>
In total, the proportion of the organic and/or inorganic acids in the com-<br>
positions according to the invention in the form of etching pastes can be<br>
in a concentration range from 0 to 80% by weight, based on the total<br>
amount of the medium. It has proven advantageous for the added acids<br>
each to have a pKa value of between 0 and 5.<br>
Besides water, solvents which may be present in the etching medium<br>
composition according to the invention are mono- or polyhydric alco-<br>
hols, such as glycerol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,3-butanediol,<br>
1,5-pentanediol, 2-ethyl-1-hexenol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol<br>
and dipropylene glycol, and ethers thereof, such as ethylene glycol<br><br>
monobutyl ether, Methylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol<br>
monobutyl ether and dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, and esters,<br>
such as [2,2-butoxy(ethoxy)]ethyl acetate, esters of carbonic acid, such<br>
as propylene carbonate, ketones, such as acetophenone, methyl-2-hex-<br>
anone, 2-octanone, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone and 1-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidone, as such or in the form of a mixture, in an amount of 10 to<br>
90% by weight, preferably in an amount of 15 to 85% by weight, based<br>
on the total amount of the medium.<br>
In use, it has proven advantageous for the etching paste compositions,<br>
apart from the components mentioned hitherto, to comprise additives<br>
selected from the group antifoams, thixotropic agents, flow-control<br>
agents, deaerators, and adhesion promoters for improving the proper-<br>
ties. Based on the total amount, 0 to 5% by weight of additives may be<br>
present in the composition employed by the user.<br>
An essential property of the compositions according to the invention is<br>
their viscosity. The viscosity is generally usually defined as the material-<br>
dependent proportion of the frictional resistance which counters the<br>
movement when adjacent liquid layers are displaced. According to New-<br>
ton, the shear resistance in a liquid layer between two sliding surfaces<br>
arranged parallel and moved relative to one another is proportional to<br>
the velocity or shear gradient G. The proportionality factor is a material<br>
constant which is known as the dynamic viscosity and has the dimen-<br>
sion m Pas. In Newtonian liquids, the proportionality factor is pressure-<br>
and temperature-dependent. The degree of dependence here is deter-<br>
mined by the material composition. Liquids or substances having an in-<br>
homogeneous composition have non-Newtonian properties. The viscos-<br>
ity of these substances is additionally dependent on the shear gradient.<br>
In industrial use, it has been found that the etching pastes according to<br>
the invention have particularly good properties if they have, owing to<br>
their overall composition, a viscosity at 20°C in the range from 6 to<br>
35 Pa * s at a shear rate of 25 s-1 preferably in the range from 10 to<br>
25 Pa * s at a shear rate of 25 s-1 and especially at 15 to 20 Pa * s at a<br>
shear rate of 25 s-1.<br><br>
As already mentioned above, it has proven advantageous, in contrast to<br>
previous knowledge, for inorganic and/or organic finely particulate pow-<br>
ders, which also contribute to thickening of the media, to be added to<br>
the etching pastes according to the invention. WO 01/83391 A also de-<br>
scribes particle-free etching media for the etching of fine structures and<br>
lines 
the thickening. In the meantime, it has been found that the addition of<br>
suitable finely particulate inorganic and/or organic powders enables par-<br>
ticularly thin lines to be printed and etched. Particularly suitable for this<br>
purpose are polymer particles which interact with the other components<br>
of the composition and form a network by means of chemical bonds or a<br>
purely physical interaction at the molecular level. The relative particle<br>
diameters of these systems can be in the range from 10 nm to 30 urn.<br>
Corresponding polymer particles having a relative particle diameter in<br>
the range from 1 to 10 urn have proven particularly advantageous. Par-<br>
ticles which are particularly suitable for the purpose according to the in-<br>
vention can consist of the following materials:<br>
-	polystyrene<br>
-	polyacrylate<br>
-	polyamide<br>
-	polyethylene<br>
-	ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer<br>
-	ethylene-acrylic acid-acrylate terpolymer<br>
-	ethylene-acrylate-maleic anhydride terpolymer<br>
-	polypropylene<br>
-	polyimide<br>
-	polymethacrylate<br>
-	melamine resin, urethane resin, benzoguanine resin, phenolic resin<br>
-	silicone resin<br>
-	fluorinated polymers (PTFE, PVDF,...), and<br>
-	micronised waxes<br>
The use of a very finely divided polyethylene powder, which is, for ex-<br>
ample, currently marketed by DuPont PolymerPowders Switzerland un-<br>
der the trade name COATHYLENE HX® 1681, having relative particle<br><br>
diameters d50 value of 10 µm, has proven particularly suitable in the ex-<br>
periments.<br>
These particulate thickeners can be added to the etching medium in<br>
amounts of 1 to 50% by weight, advantageously in the range from 10 to<br>
50% by weight, in particular from 25 to 35% by weight.<br>
Also suitable in principle are particulate polymeric thickeners based on<br>
-	polystyrene<br>
-	polyacrylate<br>
-	polyamide<br>
-	polyimide<br>
-	polymethacrylate<br>
-	melamine resin, urethane resin, benzoguanine resin, phenolic resin<br>
-	silicone resin.<br>
Etching media comprising inorganic, finely particulate powders selected<br>
from the group carbon black and graphite are distinguished, in particu-<br>
lar, by significantly improved cleaning behaviour. After etching at tem-<br>
peratures up to 500°C, in particular up to 390°C, but also after doping at<br>
temperatures up to 1050°C, the residues of the etching media can be<br>
rinsed off in a simple manner without the need for subsequent rinsing<br>
since corresponding etching-paste residues advantageously detach<br>
from the surface in particulate form and can be rinsed off simply without<br>
re-depositing again elsewhere.<br>
Compared with the particle-free etching pastes described in<br>
WO 01/83391 A, the addition of the particulate thickeners according to<br>
the invention has enabled the following improvements to be achieved:<br>
I. The particulate thickening results in improved resilience of the etch-<br>
ing medium. The particles form a skeleton-like structure in the etch-<br>
ing medium. Similar structures are known to the person skilled in the<br>
art from highly disperse silicic acid (for example Aerosil®). In particu-<br>
lar in screen or stencil printing of the etching pastes, a broadening of<br>
the printed structures due to flow can be substantially prevented or<br><br>
at least greatly restricted by the present invention. The printed, and<br>
thus paste-covered, area therefore corresponds substantially to the<br>
area specified in the screen or stencil layout.<br>
Many inorganic particles, such as, for example, silicic acid or modi-<br>
fied silicic acid, cannot be employed for thickening the etching me-<br>
dium owing to their reactivity with the etching component employed.<br>
For example, a chemical reaction of silicic acid with NH4HF2 takes<br>
place if the latter serves as etching component.<br>
II.	With the aid of particulate thickening, lines of greater print height<br>
with retained width are, in addition, printed on use of the same<br>
screen or stencil than on use of corresponding particle-free pastes,<br>
as described, for example, in WO 01/83391 A. This simultaneously<br>
results in a greater application rate of etching component per unit<br>
area. If relatively thick silicon dioxide or silicon nitride layers<br>
(&gt; 100 nm) are to be etched, this is a particular advantage for com-<br>
plete etching.<br>
III.	The more pronounced non-Newtonian or thixotropic properties of<br>
the novel etching pastes have a particularly advantageous effect for<br>
screen or stencil printing and result in considerably improved re-<br>
sults. In particular, this is evident in a shortened etching time or an<br>
increased etching rate for the same etching time and especially in a<br>
greater etching depth in the case of relatively thick layers.<br>
IV.	The thickening associated with the addition of polymer particles ac-<br>
cording to the invention results in a considerably lower binding ca-<br>
pacity of the etching paste. Given a specific choice of the particles<br>
added, an increased etching rate and thus a considerably increased<br>
etching depth are, surprisingly, achieved for the same amount of<br>
added etching component.<br>
V.	The significantly greater print height achieved under the same print-<br>
ing conditions, i.e. on use of the same screen and the same printing<br>
parameters, furthermore causes significantly delayed drying of the<br>
printed etching species. This enables the etching species to act on<br><br>
the substrate for longer. This is particularly important in the case of<br>
accelerated etching under elevated temperatures. In addition, the<br>
material remaining after the etching process can be removed signifi-<br>
cantly more easily in the final cleaning process, in particular since<br>
the paste residues detach from the surfaces in finely divided form.<br>
Significant improvements in the present compositions arise, in particu-<br>
lar, through considerably improved screen-printing behaviour, enabling<br>
continuous printing of surfaces to be treated without interruptions. The<br>
use of the etching pastes according to the invention enables considera-<br>
bly finer etching structures since the pastes have greater viscosities on<br>
addition of the same amounts of thickener in the presence of polymer<br>
particles. This enables the pastes to be applied in printing with a higher<br>
paste layer and consequently the layers to be etched more deeply. The<br>
improved rinsing behaviour (wafer cleaning) after etching also shortens<br>
the time required for subsequent cleaning. In addition, the amount of<br>
solvent or water required for the rinsing operation is reduced since resi-<br>
dues of the etching media can be detached from the treated surface af-<br>
ter the etching operation by the finely particulate inorganic powders pre-<br>
sent thereon and rinsed off without leaving a residue.<br>
For the preparation of the compositions according to the invention, the<br>
solvents, etching components, thickeners, particles and additives are<br>
mixed successively with one another and stirred for a sufficient time un-<br>
til a viscous paste having thixotropic properties has formed. The stirring<br>
can be carried out with warming to a suitable temperature. The compo-<br>
nents are usually stirred with one another at room temperature.<br>
Preferred uses of the printable etching pastes according to the invention<br>
arise for the described processes for the structuring of oxide layers ap-<br>
plied to a support material, for the production of solar cells having a se-<br>
lective emitter layer on the light incidence side and for the production of<br>
solar cells having a selective emitter layer on the light incidence side<br>
and a back-surface field on the back.<br><br>
For application to the areas to be treated, the etching pastes can be<br>
printed through a fine-mesh screen which contains the print stencil (or<br>
etched metal screens). In a further step, the pastes can be baked in the<br>
screen-printing process by the thick-layer method (screen printing of<br>
conductive metal pastes), enabling the electrical and mechanical prop-<br>
erties to be fixed. On use of the etching pastes according to the inven-<br>
tion, the baking (firing through the dielectric layers) can instead also be<br>
omitted and the applied etching pastes washed off with a suitable sol-<br>
vent or solvent mixture after a certain exposure time. The etching action<br>
is terminated by the washing-off.<br>
Particularly suitable printing processes are essentially screen printing<br>
with screen separation or stencil printing without separation. In screen<br>
printing, the separation a of a screen is usually several hundred urn with<br>
a tilt angle a between the edge of the squeegee, which pushes the etch-<br>
ing printing paste over the screen, and the screen. The screen is held<br>
by a screen frame, while the squeegee is passed over the screen at a<br>
squeegee velocity v and a squeegee pressure P. In the process, the<br>
etching paste is pushed over the screen. During this operation, the<br>
screen comes into contact with the substrate in the form of a line over<br>
the squeegee width. The contact between screen and substrate trans-<br>
fers the vast majority of the screen printing paste located in the free<br>
screen meshes onto the substrate. In the areas covered by the screen<br>
meshes, no screen printing paste is transferred onto the substrate. This<br>
enables screen printing paste to be transferred in a targeted manner<br>
onto certain areas of the substrate.<br>
After the end of the movement E, the squeegee is lifted off the screen.<br>
The screen is tensioned uniformly using a screen stretcher with a hy-<br>
draulic/pneumatic tension and clamping device. The screen tension is<br>
monitored by defined sag of the screen in a certain area at a certain<br>
weight using a dial gauge. With specific pneumatic/hydraulic printing<br>
machines, the squeegee pressure (P), the printing velocity (V), the off-<br>
contact distance (a) and the squeegee path (horizontal and vertical,<br>
squeegee angle) can be set with various degrees of automation of the<br>
working steps for trial and production runs.<br><br>
Printing screens used here usually consist of plastic or steel-wire cloth.<br>
It is possible for the person skilled in the art to select cloths having dif-<br>
ferent wire diameters and mesh widths, depending on the desired layer<br>
thickness and line width. These cloths are structured directly or indi-<br>
rectly using photosensitive materials (emulsion layer). For the printing of<br>
extremely fine lines and in the case of requisite high precision of suc-<br>
cessive prints, it may be advantageous to use metal stencils, which are<br>
likewise provided directly or indirectly with a hole structure or line struc-<br>
ture.<br>
In order to carry out the etching, an etching paste, as described, for ex-<br>
ample, in Example 1, is prepared. Using an etching paste of this type, a<br>
thermal SiO2 having a thickness of approx. 100 nm can be removed af-<br>
ter screen printing. The etching is subsequently terminated by dipping<br>
the Si wafer into water and then rinsing with the aid of a fine water<br>
spray.<br>
For the production of solar cells, wafers comprising p-doped Cz silicon<br>
having  orientation, for example, are selected. In these, a short,<br>
basic etching enables a structure to be produced on the surface which<br>
improves the light incidence geometry for reducing reflections. A thin<br>
dopant coating film comprising a boron-containing compound can be<br>
spin-coated onto the back and dried. The wafers prepared in this way<br>
are placed in a tray and introduced into an oven pre-heated to 1000 to<br>
1100°C. An oxygen atmosphere is established in the oven, so that an<br>
oxide layer forms directly on all wafer surfaces that are not covered by<br>
the boron dopant coating film. At the same time, boron is expelled from<br>
the dopant coating film and diffuses into the back of the wafers. p+-<br>
doped regions with a depth of approx. 1 to 5 urn form. This embodiment<br>
of a solar cell is known to the person skilled in the art under the term<br>
"back-surface field". The oxide layers formed on the front can now be<br>
structured using the etching pastes described above.<br>
For example, these oxide layers can be formed as masks for high n+<br>
phosphorus dopings for the formation of selective emitter layers, while<br>
significantly less n+ doping is aimed at in the masked areas.<br><br>
After opening of the pn junction, which would result in short circuits in<br>
the solar cell, for example by plasma etching or opening using a LASER<br>
beam, the electrical contacts are applied to the front and back of the<br>
cell. This can be carried out by means of two successive screen-printing<br>
steps using a paste, which may, besides the binders and oxidic addi-<br>
tives, comprise conductive silver particles and/or aluminium. After the<br>
printing, the printed contacts are baked at about 700 to 800°C.<br>
Compositions as described by this application are improved, printable<br>
etching pastes which can be employed extremely well for the etching of<br>
surfaces of glasses which comprise elements selected from the group<br>
calcium, sodium, aluminium, lead, lithium, magnesium, barium, potas-<br>
sium, boron, beryllium, phosphorus, gallium, arsenic, antimony, lantha-<br>
num, scandium, zinc, thorium, copper, chromium, manganese, iron, co-<br>
balt, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, titanium, gold, platinum, palladium,<br>
silver, cerium, caesium, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, yttrium, neodym-<br>
ium and praseodymium.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the novel etching pastes having<br>
thixotropic, non-Newtonian properties are used to structure silicon diox-<br>
ide or nitride layers in a suitable manner during the process for the pro-<br>
duction of products for photovoltaics, semiconductor technology, high-<br>
performance electronics, of solar cells or photodiodes. Etching media<br>
having the composition described can in addition be employed in min-<br>
eralogy or the glass industry and for the production of viewing windows<br>
for valves or measuring instruments, of glass supports for outdoor appli-<br>
cations, for the production of etched glass surfaces in the medical,<br>
decorative and sanitary sectors, for the production of etched glass con-<br>
tainers for cosmetic articles, foods and beverages, for the production of<br>
markings or labels on containers and in flat-glass production, for the<br>
structuring of glasses for flat-panel screen applications or for minera-<br>
logical, geological and microstructural investigations.<br>
For the etching and doping of the surfaces to be treated, the composi-<br>
tions can be applied by screen, stencil, pad, stamp, ink-jet and manual<br>
printing processes. These are processes having a high degree of auto-<br><br>
mation and high throughput. Manual application of the etching media<br>
according to the invention is likewise possible.<br>
Owing to the particular physical properties, both at room temperature<br>
and also at elevated temperatures, the novel etching media are suitable<br>
for extremely demanding applications and can be employed for the pro-<br>
duction of glass supports for solar cells or for heat collectors. They can<br>
be used for the etching of SiO2- or silicon nitride-containing glasses as<br>
uniform homogeneous non-porous and porous solids or of correspond-<br>
ing non-porous and porous glass layers of variable thickness which<br>
have been produced on other substrates. In this connection, these etch-<br>
ing media are particularly suitable for the removal of silicon oxide/doped<br>
silicon oxide and silicon nitride layers, for the selective opening of pas-<br>
sivation layers of silicon oxide and silicon nitride for the production of<br>
two-stage selective emitters and/or local p+ back-surface fields in the<br>
process for the production of semiconductor components and integrated<br>
circuits thereof or of components for high-performance electronics. In<br>
these applications, the etching medium is applied over the entire area or<br>
selectively in a suitable manner in a single process step to the semi-<br>
conductor surface to be etched, if necessary activated by input of en-<br>
ergy, and removed again after an exposure time of 10 s - 15 min, pref-<br>
erably after 30 s to 2 min. The etching can be carried out at elevated<br>
temperatures in the range from 30 to 500°C, preferably in the range<br>
from 200 to 450°C. The etching with the novel etching media according<br>
to the invention is very particularly preferably carried out in a tempera-<br>
ture range from 320 to 390°C.<br>
The media according to the invention can be applied over the entire<br>
area in a simple manner by methods known to the person skilled in the<br>
art. The novel media can also be applied selectively using an etch mask<br>
only to the areas where etching is desired. When etching of the entire<br>
area or in selectively printed areas is complete, doping can be carried<br>
out by further heating or the spent etching medium is rinsed off using a<br>
solvent or solvent mixture or burnt off by heating. The etching medium is<br>
preferably rinsed off with water when etching is complete.<br><br>
The paste is usually printed onto the surface to be etched in a single<br>
process step and removed again after a pre-specified exposure time at<br>
suitable temperature. In this way, the surface is etched and structured in<br>
the printed areas, while unprinted areas are retained in the original<br>
state.<br>
In this way, all masking and lithography steps otherwise necessary are<br>
superfluous. The etching operation can be carried out with or without<br>
input of energy, for example in the form of thermal radiation or with IR<br>
radiation.<br>
The actual etching process is subsequently terminated by washing the<br>
surfaces with water and/or a suitable solvent. More precisely, the resi-<br>
dues of the particle-containing etching media are rinsed off the etched<br>
and optionally doped surfaces using a suitable solvent when etching is<br>
complete.<br>
The surface to be etched can, as already stated, be a surface or part-<br>
surface of silicon oxide- or silicon nitride-based glass and other silicon<br>
oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems, and/or a surface or part-sur-<br>
face of a porous and non-porous layer of glass and other silicon oxide-<br>
and silicon nitride-based systems on a support material.<br>
During the application, the novel etching pastes described exhibit par-<br>
ticularly advantageous properties compared with known compositions.<br>
In particular with respect to the surface cleaning following the etching<br>
operation, the novel formulations have more optimum properties. The<br>
improved properties become particularly clear on use of corresponding<br>
etching media in paste form.<br>
It has been found that the pastes prepared exhibit improved properties,<br>
in particular, through the addition of finely particulate, inorganic powders<br>
(graphite and/or carbon black) and/or finely particulate organic powders<br>
(plastic powders), more precisely during printing, but also during and af-<br>
ter the etching of SiNx or SiO2 layers at temperatures between 320 and<br>
400°C. An essential advantage of the novel etching media or paste for-<br>
mulations consists, in particular, in that the added inorganic powders do<br><br>
not melt at the high temperatures during the etching at 320-400°C. The<br>
active etching medium consequently only reacts in the desired areas.<br>
The novel etching media prove to be particularly advantageous during<br>
the cleaning of the etched and optionally doped surfaces. This is usually<br>
carried out using high-purity, deionised water (bidistilled water) in an ul-<br>
trasound bath.<br>
After the etching operation, the paste residues do not, like known etch-<br>
ing pastes, detach from the treated surface in strips during cleaning, but<br>
instead decompose and are taken up in the cleaning water as fine parti-<br>
cles. This advantage is found in particular for pastes to which at least<br>
one inorganic powder having a relative particle size 
added.<br>
Furthermore, the use of a salt-like additive (fluxing agent additive) in the<br>
etching paste enables significantly improved cleaning to be achieved.<br>
For this purpose, a fluxing agent additive which has a melting<br>
point 400°C and which at the<br>
same time has very good water solubility is added to the paste. After the<br>
etching step at 320-390°C, the cooled paste residue can be detached<br>
significantly better during the subsequent rinsing operation.<br>
Suitable fluxing agent additives have proven to be compounds selected<br>
from the group dimethylammonium chloride, diammonium hydrogen-<br>
phosphate, diethylamine phosphate, urea, magnesium stearate, sodium<br>
acetate, triethanolamine hydrochloride and oxalic acid dihydrate. For<br>
this purpose, they can be added to the etching media individually or in<br>
the form of a mixture. In accordance with the invention, these fluxing<br>
agent additives may be present in the etching media in an amount of<br>
0.05 to 25% by weight, based on the total amount. Media in which one<br>
or more fluxing agent additives are present in an amount of up to 17%<br>
by weight have particularly good properties in use.<br>
These improved properties give rise to significant advantages for use of<br>
the etching media according to the invention in the mass production of<br>
solar cells compared with the use of conventional etching pastes since<br><br>
the paste residues can be removed in a simple manner in the cleaning<br>
step following the etching and detached paste residues do not remain<br>
on the surfaces to be treated and do not re-deposit from the cleaning<br>
water. This means that the cleaning operation can be optimised and the<br>
requisite amount of high-purity distilled water can be reduced.<br>
Overall, the use of the compositions according to the invention for etch-<br>
ing in the form of pastes thus enables large numbers of pieces to be<br>
etched and optionally doped inexpensively in a suitable automated<br>
process on an industrial scale.<br>
For better understanding and for illustration, examples are given below<br>
which are within the scope of protection of the present invention, but are<br>
not suitable for restricting the invention to these examples. These ex-<br>
amples also serve for the illustration of possible variants.<br>
It goes without saying that, both in the examples given and also in the<br>
remainder of the description, the quoted percentage data of the compo-<br>
nents present in the compositions always add up to a total of 100% and<br>
not more.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Etching paste consisting of a particulate thickener<br>
465 g of phosphoric acid (85%)<br>
are added with stirring to a solvent mixture consisting of<br>
218 g of deionised water<br>
223 g of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone<br>
1.6 g of ethylene glycol<br>
33 g of dimethylammonium chloride.<br>
The mixture is subsequently stirred vigorously.<br>
100g of Vestosint 2070<br>
are then added to the clear homogeneous mixture, which is stirred for a<br>
further 2 hours.<br><br>
The paste, which is now ready to use, can be printed using a 280 mesh<br>
stainless-steel cloth screen. In principle, polyester or similar screen ma-<br>
