				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Protein acrylate novel graft copolymer having molecular weight upto 300 000. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a protein-acrylate graft copolymer for application as thermostable binder in leather finishing and coating in printing industry. The binder of the present invention has potential application in leather finishing to get a very good lusture without masking the grain pattern. It may be used for the formulation of leather finishing formulation to be used either for glazed finish or resin finish.<br>
One of the important ingredients used for leather finishing is binder, which is essentially a kind of film forming material holding pigment and other finishing auxiliaries on a film on the surface of the leather to be finished. Conventionally, the binders are based either on protein like casein, albumin or on resin like acrylates. Binders are selected depending on the requirement of properties and end use of the final leather.<br>
As reported by Wurtele (Grebbereiwiss Prax, 28 (1), 107, 1976), methyl methacrylate polymer used for the purpose of leather finishing formed a very good film on the leather surface imparting high wet rub fastness. Anbazhagan et al (Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 30, 391 - 400, 1985) prepared a binder for leather finishing by graft copolymerising chlorinated rubber with ethyl acrylate, n-butyl methacrylate in toluene medium under nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 80째C in the presence of benzoyl peroxide as initiator.<br><br>
Since the binders containing only synthetic polymers are not biodegradable, they contribute significantly to the environmental pollution by way of posing the problem of waste disposal. Moreover, the resin binders cannot withstand the temperature of glazing and hence are not suitable for glaze finished leather, which require thermostable protein binder in the finishing formulation.<br>
The main limitation of the protein binder is, however, its poor wet rub fastness, which is usually more in'case of resin finished leather. In this way, it seems to be very difficult to get all the desirable properties of a film by using either of them individually. This has prompted the researchers to use a proteinous source as the backbone in the preparation of binder by graft copolymerising a resin onto the proteinous backbone to ensure that their combination can obviate the said limitations.<br>
Studniarski et al (Prezylad Skorzany, 40(8), 151, 1985) used potassium persulfate redox initiator system to prepare gelatin- acrylonitrile graft copolymer for using as binder in leather finishing.<br>
Another important protein, which has been used for leather finishing is casein. Lakshminarayana et al ( Journal of American Leather Chemists Association, 79, 398-403, 1984 ) used casein for grafting acrylonitrile -styrene and acrylonitrile - n-butyl methacrylate using potassium persulphate -triethanolamine redox system at 60째 C.<br><br>
Since casein is essentially a milk protein, its application in leather industry as<br>
a backbone in the preparation of binder implies that it has to be diverted from<br>
food industry.thereby resulting in higher cost of prbduction.<br>
Attempt was made by Olteanu et al (Material Plastics (Bucharest), 18(1), 43-<br>
47, 1981) to prepare heterogeneous mixtures of collagen hydrolyzates and<br>
acrylic monomer latexes at a pH in the range of 3-4, resulting in a product<br>
exhibiting stability to temperature only upto 60째C, which is not enough for<br>
leather finishing.<br>
Rao et al (Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 16, 975 - 986, 1970) grafted<br>
collagen powder with different vinyl monomers at a temperature of   60째C<br>
using the eerie ion initiator at pH 2.0. The pre-requisite of using eerie ion is<br>
that the pH    has to be maintained around 2, which suggests careful<br>
monitoring of the reaction.<br>
One interesting feature in all the above protein-resin graft copolymers is that<br>
a film forming proteinous source has been used as the backbone for<br>
necessary grafting.<br>
Since all these proteinous sources have major applications either for medical<br>
purpose, or in food/pharmaceutical industry, the major limitation associated<br>
with all the above systems is their availability in abundant quantity for the<br>
purpose of leather finishing, whereby the cost of production of the binder<br>
goes up consequently.<br>
In this connection, a   potential proteinous source is animal blood that is<br>
available in plenty in the slaughter houses. Usually, the animal blood is<br><br>
defibrinated by vigorous churning for the purpose of isolating red blood cells (RBC), which are used for preparing haemoglobin. The serum obtained after separating the RBC is a protein, which is discarded as waste. Unlike the conventional film forming proteins, serum is not a good film former. Another limitation of the serum is that it, being a protein, is susceptible to decay by proteolytic attack. In the hitherto known process film forming protein is used as backbone and need to be used in large quantities. However, in the<br>
*<br>
present process use of non-film forming protein processed from bovine serum<br>
is being used, thereby reducing the requirement of costly film forming protein<br>
which is in high demand in other industries. Thus this process makes use of<br>
waste material and makes it more economical.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process<br>
for the preparation of a novel graft copolymer having molecular weight upto<br>
300 000, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to use a non-film forming<br>
proteinous source for the preparation of protein-acrylate graft copolymer.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to use bovine serum, a<br>
hitherto considered slaughter house waste, as the proteinous source for the<br>
preparation of binder.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple process<br>
to improve the film forming property of serum.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process to carry<br>
out polymerisation at a pH in the range of 6-8.<br><br>
Still   another objective of the present invention is to provide a process to prepare a binder having stability upto a temperature of 150째C. Accordingly    the present invention provide an improved process for the preparation of a protein acrylate novel graft copolymer having molecular weight upto 300 000, which comprises<br>
i. solubilising 1-2% w/v of a conventional film forming natural protein<br>
characterized in that in non-film forming protein processed from bovine serum in a known manner to get a mixture of serum and film forming protein,<br>
ii. graft copolymerising the said mixture of proteins with an acrylic<br>
monomer such as herein described in the range of 25-50% v/v with<br>
reference to serum using    a ratio varying from 4:1 to 8:1 (protein<br>
:monomer) in presence of 2 to 5% w/v conventional redox initiator(s),<br>
preferably persulfites, meta bisulfites of monovalent cations, 0.2-0.5%<br>
w/v of conventional crosslinking agents, 1-4% of v/v   conventional<br>
plasticizer, preferably straight chain fatty alcohols in a known manner<br>
under stirring at temperature of 45-75째C at least for 5 min., adding<br>
conventional sterilising agent in the range of 0.5-2% w/v with reference<br>
to serum, such as herein described  in the range of 0.3-1% w/v, after<br>
cooling to 20-30째C to get the novel graft copolymer.<br>
In an embodiment of present invention, the conventional film forming protein<br>
used may be such as fibrin, collagen, casein, gelatin, albumin.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the acrylic monomer used<br>
may be such as hydroxy ethylmethacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, methyl<br>
methacrylate, butyl methacrylate.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of the acrylic<br>
monomer used may be in the range of 12.5-25% v/vwith reference to serum.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the redox initiator used<br>
may be such as   ammonium persulphate, potassium persulphate, sodium<br>
meta bisulphite, benzoyl peroxide either individually or in combination.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the crosslinker used may<br>
be such as glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, basic chromium sulphate, genipin.<br>
In still another embodiment of the "present invention, the plasticiser used may<br>
be such as ethylene glycol, glycerol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene<br>
glycol, either individually or in combination.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention,  the conventional<br>
sterilising agent used may be such as sodium benzoate,sodium metabisulfite,<br>
copper sulfate, lunacid.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of the<br>
conventional sterilising agent used may be in the range of 0.3-0.5% w/v with<br>
reference to serum.<br>
The protein-acrylate graft copolymer is prepared in the following way.<br>
Serum   is heated with 1-2% w/v, of  conventional film forming protein at a<br>
temperature in the range of 45-75째C and the resulting protein mixture is graft<br>
copolymerised with 12.5-25% v/v, of acrylic monomer in presence of 2-5%<br>
w/v,  of redox initiator,  0.2-0.5%  w/v,  of crosslinker and  1-4% v/v, of<br>
plasticiser, added either simultaneously or in succession, at a temperature in<br>
the  range  of  30-75째C.  While  polymerising,   the- reactants  are  stirred<br><br>
continuously and the completion of the polymerization is ascertained by the<br>
conventional titration method.<br>
The resulting graft copolymer emulsion is then stirred with 0.3-0.5% w/v, of<br>
known sterilising agent at a temperature in the range of 20 - 30째 C to obtain<br>
the protein-acrylate graft copolymer.<br>
The novelty and non-obviousness of the present invention lies in the<br>
identification of a non film forming proteinous   source of serum, which is<br>
otherwise discarded as waste adding to environmental pollution, for preparing<br>
a protein-acrylate copolymer, having such properties as are necessary for<br>
being used as film forming binder in leather finishing, thereby suggesting an<br>
economical process to create wealth out of waste.<br>
