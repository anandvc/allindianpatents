				<td>TITLE: ORTHOTIC INSERT AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to orthotic inserts and to a method of manufacturing orthotic<br>
inserts.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be<br>
considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common<br>
general knowledge in the field.<br>
The human foot is a complex structure made up of 28 bones held together by soft<br>
tissue, muscles, ligaments and tendons.<br>
Orthotic inserts are used to provide additional support for the feet of a wearer,<br>
particularly in circumstances- where the wearer requires a degree of bio-mechanical<br>
support and control.<br>
Orthotic inserts can range from simple foam, leather, cork, or sponge rubber arch<br>
supports that can be purchased over the counter, through to relatively sophisticated<br>
custom made inserts. Typically, the more sophisticated orthotic inserts are relatively<br>
expensive and are produced on a custom made basis in accordance with detailed<br>
prescriptions provided by the examining doctor.<br>
The primary function of an orthotic insert is to control any excessive pronation<br>
and supination that a person may experience as his or her foot strikes the ground during<br>
walking or running. Pronation is the flattening or rolling inward of the foot as the foot<br>
strikes the ground, whilst supination is the rolling outward of the foot during walking or<br>
running. If either of these motions become excessive, damage to the knees, ankles and<br>
feet can occur.<br>
Known orthotic inserts rely upon the contouring of the upper surface of the insert<br>
to provide the necessary degree of support and control for the wearer. However, in<br>
certain circumstances this may not provide sufficient comfort for the wearer.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at<br>
least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To this end, a first aspect of the present invention provides a heat mouldable<br>
orthotic insert having a first and second portion, wherein said second portion is formed<br>
of a material of higher resistance to deformation than said first portion.<br>
Preferably, both the first and second portions of the orthotic insert are formed<br>
from resilient material, with the second portion being formed from a resilient material of<br>
higher resistance to deformation than said first portion.<br>
Preferably, the second portion is formed from a material of higher density than<br>
the material from which the first portion is made.<br>
Preferably, said first and second portions of the orthotic insert are formed from<br>
heat mouldable ethyl vinyl acetate. <br>
Preferably, said first and second portions of the orthotic insert are joined by<br>
bonding. More preferably, said first and second portions are joined together by gluing.<br>
Preferably, the second portion is adapted to provide support for the heel region<br>
of a person"s foot. In a further preferred embodiment, the second portion is adapted to<br>
provide support for the heel and arch regions of a person"s foot.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the second portion has a substantially<br>
U- or J-shaped configuration which extends partially around the periphery of the insert<br>
corresponding to the heel and arch regions of a person"s foot.<br>
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the<br>
claims, the words "comprise", "comprising", and the like are to be construed in an<br>
inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the<br>
sense of "including, but not limited to".<br>
Advantageously, the orthotic insert according to the present invention is able to<br>
be heat moulded to the contours of the underside of a person"s foot in the correct<br>
biomechanical position whilst standing in a weight bearing position.<br>
Advantageously, in one particularly preferred embodiment the present invention<br>
provides an orthotic insert which provides improved, support and comfort for a person"s<br>
foot around the heel and arch areas.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention provides a method of producing an<br>
orthotic insert comprising forming a first portion of the insert, forming a second portion<br>
of the insert from a material of higher resistance to deformation than said first portion of<br>
the insert, and joining said first and second portions together to form the insert.<br>
Preferably, the first portion of the insert is formed by moulding. More<br>
preferably, the first portion of the insert is formed by heat moulding.<br>
Preferably, the second portion of the insert is formed by moulding. More<br>
preferably, the second portion of the insert is formed by heat moulding.<br>
Preferably, the said first and second portions are joined together by means of<br>
bonding. More preferably, the first and second portions are joined together by gluing.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the second portion has a substantially<br>
U- or J-shaped configuration which extends partially around the periphery of the insert<br>
corresponding to the heel and arch regions of a person"s foot.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to Figs.l to 7, a preferred embodiment of an orthotic insert 1 according<br>
to the present invention is depicted. The orthotic insert depicted is for the left foot of a<br>
person and is adapted to be inserted into an article of footwear such that in use the insert<br>
lies between, the footwear and the underside of the person"s foot so as to provide a<br>
degree of biomechanical support and control for the foot. The orthotic insert depicted in<br>
the accompanying drawings is a three-quarter length insert, but it should be noted that<br>
the present invention is applicable to all lengths of orthotic inserts, such as full length<br>
inserts.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the orthotic insert is<br>
formed from portions 2, 3 of differing resistance to deformation. More particularly, in<br>
the preferred embodiment of the invention, the region of the orthotic insert surrounding<br>
the heel of the wearer comprises a portion 3 formed from a material which is more<br>
resistant to compression than the portion 2 which forms the remainder of the body of the<br>
insert. Typically, the portion 3 is between 30 to 70% more resistant to deformation than<br>
the portion 2. More typically, the portion 3 is between 40 to 60% more resistant to<br>
deformation than portion 2.<br>
The first portion 2 of the orthotic insert forms the main body of the insert and<br>
provides support for the fore foot. This portion of the orthotic insert may include an<br>
integrally formed metatarsal raise.<br>
The second portion 3 of the orthotic is located in the heel region of the insert. In<br>
the embodiment depicted in Figs. 1 to 7, the second portion 3 has a substantially U or J-<br>
shaped configuration which extends around the heel region and into the arch region of<br>
the wearer"s foot. The first portion 2 includes a tongue 4 which is located within a<br>
complementary shaped recess in the second portion. In use the tongue 4 lies beneath the<br>
calcaneus of the wearer. The first and second portions of the insert are joined together<br>
by bonding along the interface 5.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the first portion of the orthotic is formed from heat<br>
mouldable ethyl vinyl acetate.<br>
Preferably the second portion of the insert is formed from heat mouldable ethyl<br>
vinyl acetate of a higher density than that of the first portion such that it has a higher<br>
resistance to compression thereby providing firmer support in the heel and arch areas of<br>
the foot of the wearer. This preferred embodiment offers rear foot and arch control from<br>
a higher density EVA material, combined with the comfort of a softer mid-density EVA,<br>
resulting in comfort and control in the gait cycle from heel strike, midstance to toe off,<br>
whilst maintaining medial and rear foot control throughout.<br>
Whilst the preferred embodiment depicted in Figs. 1 to 7 illustrates a second<br>
portion 3 having a substantially U- or J-shaped configuration, it is to be noted that the<br>
portion of firmer material may be configured in differing shapes according to the<br>
orthotic requirements of the intended wearer. Additionally, the portion of firmer<br>
material may be located at different locations on the insert depending upon the<br>
requirements of the intended wearer. For example, an alternative embodiment of an<br>
orthotic insert according to the present invention is depicted in Figs. 8 and 9. In this<br>
embodiment, the insert includes a portion of firmer material 3 which forms<br>
approximately one half of the heel section of the insert such that the interface 5 between<br>
the two portions 2, 3 defines a longitudinally extending line. In this embodiment,<br>
portion 3 provides additional support for the inside of the heel of the wearer.<br>
Additionally, it is to be noted that the orthotic may be formed from a multitude of<br>
separate portions joined together to form the complete insert. Each portion may be<br>
formed of materials of differing properties so as to provide the desired degree of support<br>
for particular regions of the person"s foot. For example, the insert may be formed of<br>
three or more separate portions of differing material properties joined together to form<br>
the complete insert.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention both the first and second portions of<br>
the orthotic insert are formed from heat mouldable ethyl vinyl acetate of differing<br>
densities. However, it should be noted that each portion of the orthotic insert could be<br>
formed from distinctly different materials.<br>
In order to manufacture the orthotic insert each portion of the insert is cut to a<br>
basic shape and then placed into a mould. The mould is subsequently put under pressure<br>
and heated to a temperature of the order of 140°C. The moulds are then left for a period<br>
to cool down and then the portions are extracted and trimmed to their desired shapes.<br>
The two portions are then glued together using an aqueous based heat resistant glue so as<br>
to form the completed insert. The orthotic insert is then fitted to the foot of the intended<br>
wearer by means of heat moulding.<br>
In order to fit orthotic inserts according to the present invention to a patient,<br>
inserts of the appropriate size and material density for the patient are selected. An insert<br>
is then heated until the insert material softens. Heating of the insert may be performed<br>
by a number of possible means, including a hot air gun. or by placing the insert in an<br>
oven. The heated insert is then placed into the shoe of the patient and the patients foot is<br>
placed into the shoe in the subtalar neutral position. The pressure exerted on the heated<br>
insert by the weight of the patient causes the upper surface of the insert to conform to the<br>
patient"s foot. Typically the patient must maintain the position for a short period (i.e. 30<br>
seconds to a minute) to allow sufficient time for the insert to conform. Upon cooling the<br>
insert will retain the shape to which it has conformed. This process is then repeated for<br>
the other foot of the patient.<br>
Advantageously, the present invention provides a prefabricated orthotic insert that<br>
can be heat moulded to a particular foot in the correct biomechanical position whilst<br>
standing in a weight bearing position. This contrasts with custom fitted orthotic inserts<br>
which typically require the profile of the person"s foot to be scanned so as to enable a<br>
blank orthotic to be milled to provide the correct profile.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to specific examples it<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in<br>
many other forms.<br>
