				<td>The present invention is related to a replacement composition for sugar,<br>
having both the sweetening and structuring characteristics of sugar. More particularly,<br>
the present invention involves a solid or semi-solid functional sweetener that can be<br>
used to replace sugar in any preparation on a 1/1 weight basis and/or additionally on a<br>
1/1 volume basis.<br>
Sugar 13 a popular sweetening additive in human food preparation. By sugar<br>
is understood sucrose but also other commonly used calorie rich sweetening additives<br>
such as glucose, fructose and high fructose corn syrups. Popular feeding habits tend to<br>
show an over consumption of sugar. However, among other due to its high calorie<br>
content, high uptake of sugar is not recommended for dietary reasons. The most<br>
common adverse health effects of sugar are tooth decay and obesity. The rapid<br>
introduction in the 1970s of high-fructose corn syrup into the food supply, particularly<br>
in soft drinks, has been recognized as an important factor contributing to the obesity<br>
epidemic that has swept the world in the last 30 years. Further, people with diabetes<br>
need to control the intake of sugar. A high level of glucose in the blood is harmful.<br>
Even though the symptoms are not immediately severe, over time, uncontrolled high<br>
blood sugar levels can damage the smaller blood vessels, leading to complications<br>
including irreversible damage to the eyes and kidneys. Nerves can also be damaged,<br>
which can affect internal organs as well as the ability to feel sensations and 'pain.<br>
Uncontrolled diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack<br>
and stroke. Therefore, sugar replacement solutions for popular foodstuffs are of high<br>
value.<br>
The present invention relates to a new concept with respect to healthy<br>
nutritional habits and functional foods. The basic, and most important, idea for this<br>
concept is that people no longer need to change their food habits in order to improve<br>
their health. Within the concept of the invention, it is possible to consume foods with<br>
positive health effects as simple and effective as possible, without giving up anything<br>
the consumer likes such as sweet or salty taste, palatable structure and texture of the<br>
food products. The main goal is to replace those food ingredients that are used in the<br><br>
largest quantities, out at the same time present an insidious poison to - even healthy -<br>
human beings. One of the most important ingredients in this context is sugar.<br>
in this view, it is important to acknowledge the presence of complex<br>
microflora in the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), more specifically the colon, as being<br>
part of healthy human beings. In the gastrointestinal tract, microorganisms arc<br>
prevalent in the colon, where they constitute about 1011-1012 /gram of colon contents. It<br>
is known that microbes in the large intestine complete the digestion process on food<br>
components that were not digested in the small intestine, such as fibres which are oligo-<br>
and polysaccharides and are in most cases plant-derived food material.<br>
The characteristics of these oligo- and polysaccharides, are dependent on, for<br>
instance, the saccharide composition, the bonds between the saccharides and the degree<br>
of polymerisation (DP). The degree of polymerisation corresponds to the number of<br>
saccharide units (e.g.. fructose and glucose) linked to each other in the carbohydrate<br>
chain of one oligo- or polysaccharide molecule. Polysaccharides can be defined as<br>
branched or unbranched chains of saccharide units having a DP of at least 10.<br>
Oligosaccharides can be defined as branched or unbranched chains of monosaccharide<br>
units having a DP between 2 and 10. Further, the average degree of polymerisation can<br>
be defined as the total number of monosaccharide units divided by the total number of<br>
saccharide molecules present in a given oligo- or polysaccharide composition. It is<br>
advantageously measured using high performance anion exchange chromatography<br>
(HPAEC) with pulsed anrperornetric detection (PAD) as described by Blecker C. et al.,<br>
Characterisation of different inulin samples by DSC, Journal of Thermal Analysis and<br>
Calorimetry 71 (I); 215-224, 200.3. Furthermore the degree of polymerisation may also<br>
be determined by one of the following analytical methods: Campa C. et al,,<br>
Determination of average degree of polymerisation and distribution of oligosaccharides<br>
in a partially acid-hydrolysed homopolysaccharide: a comparison of four experimental<br>
methods applied to mannuronan, Journal of Chromatography A.. 2004 Feb 13;1026(1-<br>
2):271-S1; and Ravenscroft N. et al., Physico-chemical characterisation of the<br>
oligosaccharide component of vaccines, Developmental Biology 2000,103:35-47.<br>
Some cf these fibres have prebiotic properties and are called prebiotic fibres<br>
or prebiotic oligo- or polysaccharides. They are mainly soluble oligo- and<br>
polysaccharides that are non digestible, which means that they are neither digested by<br><br>
human enzymes of the GI rract nor absorbed in the uppsr digestive tract. Thus they<br>
arrive unchanged in the colon where they are at least partially fermented, mainly, by<br>
beneficial bacteria present in the colon, such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli. Hence,<br>
these beneficial bacteria utilise prebiotic fibres as selective energy source for growth<br>
and proliferation in the colon.<br>
This effect is called prebiotic activity, referring to stimulation and/or<br>
activation of health promoting bacteria in the intestinal tract, Studies on humans have,<br>
for instance, confirmed that ingestion of moderate amounts of these prebiotic fibres<br>
(from 5 g per day) results in a significant increase (up to 10 fold) of Bifidobacteria in<br>
the colon. During fermentation, these fibres are degraded and short chain fatty acids<br>
(SCFA) are produced, lowering pH levels and providing an energy source for growth<br>
and maintenance cf large intestine cells. This process leads to differentiation of cancer<br>
cells, a vital step that is required before cancer cells can be killed. The pH lowering<br>
effect of the acid production results in an improved calcium and magnesium uptake, and<br>
simultaneously creates a harmful environment for-pathogemc and putrefactive bacteria,<br>
such as Clostridia, E. coli or Bacteroides,<br>
- In relation to the complex microflora, probiorics were defined by a group of<br>
experts convened by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations<br>
(FAO). Their definition of probiotics is "live microorganisms administered in adequate<br>
amounts which confer a beneficial effect on the host". In practise mainly certain<br>
Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli are cited as having probiotic activity. They are<br>
generally referred to as probiotics when administered orally. These bacteria are capable<br>
of colonising the intestinal tract, more specifically the colon, where they exert beneficial<br>
effects on human health. However, only a few strains belonging to these two genera<br>
cause positive health effects, which are claimed in commercial applications.<br>
Beside the effect of colonizing the colon and thereby preventing the<br>
proliferation of undesired and harmful bacteria, other health effects of probiotics and<br>
possibly also some endogenous beneficial bacteria are: decreasing the incidence or<br>
duration of diarrhoea, coping with lactose intolerance, anti-hypertensive effects,<br>
decrease in cancer risk, immune system stimulation, etc. These effects may be direct or<br>
indirect, meaning that they can be caused by either bacterial activities or products, or by<br>
products created by digestion in the digestive tract.<br><br>
Replacement of sugar by intense sweeteners is a serious problem in solid<br>
and semi-solid comestibles, because sucrose fulfils both a structural and sweetening<br>
function in these products. Preparation of low sugar or no sugar added products<br>
automatically faces the problem of replacing the bulk material in the product, which, in<br>
addition, should have at least the same functionality as the replaced sugar.<br>
Several products have already been disclosed in the prior art. However,<br>
none of these products allows replacing sugar in semi-solid or solid preparations on a<br>
1/1 weight basis, while retaining all the palatability, taste, sweetening, functional and<br>
texturing properties of sugar. In this respect, E? 0 963 379 and US 6,423,358 disclose<br>
examples of fibre containing sugar substitutes on a 1/1 volume basis.<br>
Moreover, said replacement should provide essentially the same sweetness<br>
as sugar, at least the same functional effects as sugar on structure, texture, appearance<br>
and palatability of the food preparation, but should also have some additional<br>
functionality such as health promoting effects and/or increased shelf life of the<br>
processed food products. Accordingly, the sugar substitute should not only replace<br>
sugar but should additionally offer a wide range of health effects while providing the<br>
human body with the required amounts of fibres, vitamins and minerals. Summarising,<br>
it can be stated that by using the sugar substitute, a better health should be obtained<br>
without making any concessions on neither taste nor structure.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a healthy replacement for sucrose in<br>
common preparations, on a 1/1 weight basis, and preferably also on a 1/1 volume basis.<br>
This means that in any recipe requiring the presence of sugar, the amount of sugar can<br>
be replaced by the same amount of solid or semi-solid, low calorie, fibre containing<br>
sugar replacement composition according to the present invention.<br>
To this end, the present invention provides a sugar replacement composition<br>
that comprises a bulking fibre composition, which is a combination of polysaccharides<br>
having a DP of at least 10 and oligosaccharides having a DP ranging from about 2 to<br>
about 10, and a sweetener or sweetener composition.<br>
The building fibre composition comprises 30 to 75, preferably 45 to 65,<br>
weight % of polysaccharide, 5 to 45, preferably 10 to 30, weight % of oligosaccharide,<br>
the total of the sugar replacement composition being 10C weight %.<br><br>
Preferably, at least one polysaccharide and/or oligosaccharide compound is<br>
prebiotic.<br>
Further it is preferred that at least one polysaccharide and/or oligosaccharide<br>
is composed of mainly glucose units and at least one polysaccharide and/or<br>
oligosaccharide is composed of mainly fructose units.<br>
Further it is also preferred that, the average degree of polymerisation of the<br>
oligosaccharide fraction of the bullring fibre composition is 3 to 8, preferably 3 to 5,<br>
while the average degree of polymerisation of the polysaccharide fraction of the bulking<br>
fibre composition is 10 to 20, preferably 10 to 15. Preferably, each fraction is<br>
characterized by a monomodal distribution of the DP, wherein the maximum peak is<br>
within the respective range as specified above. However, if both oligosaccharide<br>
resistant maltodextrin and polysaccharide resistant maltodextrin are used,-it is also<br>
preferable to employ a single resistant maltodextrin fraction exhibiting a monomodal<br>
distribution of the DP. In this case, the maximum peak of the distribution of the DP<br>
need not necessarily be within the above-specified ranges, provided that the average DP<br>
of the oligosaccharide sub-fraction thereof and of the polysaccharide sub-fraction<br>
thereof are within the respective ranges.<br>
The sweetener composition comprises one or several high intensity<br>
sweeteners in an amount sufficient to provide to the sugar replacement composition a<br>
sweetness about equal to the sweetness of sugar. Sweetness is determined by preparing<br>
different dilutions in water and then determining the highest dilution in which a sweet<br>
taste is perceptible. The concentration of sweetener that delivers a sweet taste equal to<br>
sugar is determined by preparing different dilutions in water, which are then compared<br>
with sugar,<br>
Advantageously, said polysaccharide has a degree of polymerisation (DP)<br>
between 10 and 60. preferably between 10 and 40, and specifically between 10 and 20<br>
and said oligosaccharide has a DP between 2 and 10, preferably between 2 and 8.<br>
Throughout the present application, the term "about" is intended to permit a<br>
variation of no more than ± 10% of the given numerical value, and preferably of no<br>
more than ± 5 % of the given numerical value.<br><br>
Said polysaccharide is preferably prebiotic and is preferably selected from<br>
the group consisting of inulin, polydextrose, polysaccharide resistant maltodexrrin or<br>
can be a combination thereof.<br>

consisting of acesulfame K, neohesperidine DC, aspartame, neotaine, saccharin,<br>
sueralose, ahtame, thaurnatine, cydamate, glycyrrhizin or can be .a combination thereof.<br>
Another useful high intensity sweetener is stevioside and/or related extracts from the<br>
leaves of the Stevia rebaudiana plant (hereinafter referred to as "stevioside/stevia<br>
extract"). This is a crystalline diterpene glycoside, about 300x sweeter than sucrose. A<br>
flavour enhancer such as glucono-8-lacton can be added to the sweetener composition.<br>

According to an interesting embodiment of the invention, as represented in<br>

composition.<br><br>
Other details and features of the invention will become clear from the<br>
following description of specific embodiments of the invention, which are given by way<br>
of illustration only and are not restrictive in any respect.<br>
The basic ingredients of the sugar replacement composition according to the<br>
invention are the following:<br>
• a bulking fibre composition comprising:<br>
- polysaccharide that is preferably prebiotic such as polydextrose, inulin<br>
and/or resistant maltodextrin;<br><br>
-	oligosaccharide that is preferably prebiotic such as oligofructose<br>
and/or resistant maltodextrin;<br>
-	optionally, soluble, non selective, non digestible polysaccharide such<br>
as carrageenan, xanthan, guar gum, arabic gum,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose and/or pectin; and<br>
-	optionally, insoluble, non selective, non digestible polysaccharide<br>
such as wheat fibre; and<br>
• a sweetener composition comprising:<br>
-	high intensity sweetener such as sucnlose, acesulfame K and/or<br>
neohesperidine DC;<br>
-	optionally, low intensity or bulk sweetener such as maltitol and/or<br>
isomalt; and<br>
-	optionally, flavour enhancer such as glucono-δ-lacton.<br>
Specific embodiments of the sugar replacement composition comprise<br>
specific combinations of the above ingredients.<br>
The sweetener composition comprises a high intensity sweetener, of which<br>
examples are listed in table 9, and, optionally, a low intensity sweetener. Preferably, the<br>
caloric value of the sugar replacement composition should not exceed 200 kcal/100 g, more specifically 150 kcal/100 g. Both, the high and low intensity sweeteners arc<br>
preferably non-metabolisable.<br><br><br>
The low intensity sweetener is in particular a bulk sweetener having a<br>
sweetness that is lower than that of sucrose. However, the low intensity sweetener may<br>
also have a sweetness that is about equal to that of sucrose or is at least in same order of<br>
magnitude as that of sucrose.<br>
The low intensity sweetener may be present in an amount up to 40<br>
weight %, in particular from 10 to 40 weight %, preferably from 10 to 30 weight % of<br>
the sugar replacement composition.<br>
In a first specific embodiment of the invention, as represented in table 10,<br>
maltitol is used as low intensity sweetener, preferably in a concentration below 30<br>
weight %. In a second specific embodiment of the invention, as represented in table 11,<br>
isomalt is used as LOW intensity sweetener, preferably in a concentration below 20<br>
weight %. Maltitol and isomalt have a dual function in the mixture. Firstly, they are<br>
bulk sweeteners. Maltitol has a sweetness that is equal to about 90 % of the sweetness<br>
of sucrose. Isomalt has a sweetness that is equal to about 50 % of the sweetness of<br>
sucrose. Its negative neat of solution is very similar to that of sucrose. This means that,<br>
unlike other polyols, isomalt exhibits no cooling effect. Secondly, the molecular<br>
weights, and also their structures, are similar to that of sucrose, which makes them<br>
suitable replacements for sugar in many applications.<br><br>
In the sweetener composition according to the invention, the problem<br>
regarding replacing the bulking and texturing function of sugar can only partially be<br>
solved by the addition of maltitol and isomalt. Functionally, maltitol and isomalt are<br>
not able to replace sucrose completely. For instance, unlike sucrose, maltitol and<br>
isomalt, like other polyols, do not brown or caramelize. Nevertheless, maltitol and<br><br>
isomalt have a sweet taste that is very similar to the sweet taste of sucrose and exhibit<br>
negligible cooling effsct in the mouth compared to most other polyols.<br><br>
A high intensity sweetener is used in the composition in order to provide to<br>
the sugar replacement composition a sweetness that is about equal to the sweetness of<br>
sugar. Consequently, the high intensity sweetener has a sweetness that is higher than<br>
the sweetness of sucrose, Preferably, the high intensity sweetener is at least 30 times as<br>
sweet as sucrose. Such high intensity sweeteners are known to the man skilled in the<br>
art. Some examples of these high intensity sweeteners are listed in'table 9.<br>
As an example, Acesulfame K (Ace K) and Neohesperidine DC (NHDC)<br>
are artificial sweeteners that are used in the first and second embodiments of the<br>
invention. Although AceK has a sweetness that is 200 times as high as sucrose, it<br>
appears to have a bitter and metallic aftertaste when used alone in foods and drinks.<br>
Neohesperidine DC (NHDC) is about 200 to 1500, and even 1800, times as sweet as<br>
sucrose on threshold levels, but it is, more importantly, a perfect flavour enhancer and<br>
masks the unpleasant aftertaste of AceK, The combination of these artificial sweeteners<br>
results in a synergistic effect. Optimally the ratio of Acesulfame K to Neohesperidine<br>
DC is about 9,5 to 11,5, and in particular between 10,0 and 11,0.<br>
The high intensity sweetener may be used in combination with a flavour<br>
enhancer such as glucono-δ-lacton. In the above example with Acesulfame K (Ace K)<br>
and. Neohesperidine DC (NHDC), glucono-δ-lacton can be used in an amount of 0,15<br><br>
weight %. Glucono-δ-lacton enhances the perception cf the initial sweet taste of<br>
Neohesperidine DC.<br>
A third specific embodiment of the invention, as represented in table 12,<br>
uses sucralose as high intensity sweetener.<br><br>
It should be clear that other high intensity sweeteners may also be used and<br>
that the high intensity sweetener used in the different embodiments are interchangeable<br>
for the purpose of the invention. However, some high intensity sweeteners may be<br>
preferred above others.<br>
According to the invention, part of the sucrose is replaced by a bulking fibre<br>
composition that comprises mainly so-called prebiotic fibres. Preferably, these fibres<br>
contain oligosaccharide and/or polysaccharide polymers of mainly glucose units and<br>
also oligosaccharide and/or polysaccharide polymers of mainly fructose units.<br>
According to the first, second and third embodiments of the invention, as<br>
represented in table; 1 to 12, polydextrose is used as a prebiotic, non digestible<br>
polysaccharide in the fibre composition.<br>
Polydextrose is present in an amount of 30 to 60 weight %, preferably 40 to<br>
55 weight %.<br>
Polydextrose is a polysaccharide composed of glucose units with randomly<br>
cross-linked bonds, with 1-&gt;6 bonds predominating, containing minor amounts of<br>
bound sorbitol and acid. The average degree of polymerisation (DP) of polydextrose is<br>
about 12.<br><br>
Polydextrose is commonly used as bulking agent in sugar replacement<br>
compositions but has some major drawbacks. It is hygroscopic, which may result in a<br>
sticky texture of the final product. Polydexrrose also does not participate in browning<br>
reactions that may be desired for some baked food products. Hence, polydcxtrosc as<br>
sole bulking agent in sugar replacement compositions does not: provide the desired<br>
functionality of sugar.<br>
Furthermore, according to the second and third embodiments of the<br>
invention, represented in tables 11 and 12, mulin is aiso used as a prebiotic, non<br>
digestible polysaccharide in the fibre composition. Inulin is present in an amount up to<br>
25 weight %, preferably between 5 and 15 weight %. Inulin is a polymer of D-fruclose<br>
residues linked by β-(2-&gt;l)-linkages with a terminal. β-(2-&gt;l)-linked glucose residue.<br>
' Inulin occurs in over ] 0 000 different crops but on industrial scale it is extracted from<br>
chicory roots. The degree of polymerisation (DP) of inulin usually ranges from 10 to<br>
about 60. For the purpose of the invention a DP below 40 is preferred, or even below<br>
20.<br>
According to the first, second and third specific embodiments of the<br>
invention, represented in tables 10 to 12, oligofructose is used as prebiotic, non<br>
digestible oligosaccharide in the fibre composition. Preferably this oligoffuctose has a<br>
DP of 2 to 8 and is present in an amount of 3 to 30 weight %, preferably 5 to 10 weight<br>
%. More particularly, the oligoffuctose used in the mixture can be a fructan type<br>
oligosaccharide, produced through one of the following manufacturing processes: (fl<br>
hydrolysis or enzymatic degradation of inulin to oligofructose having a DP that ranges<br>
from 2 to about 8; or (ii) transffuctosylation of a β-fructosidase of Aspergillus niger on<br>
sucrose. The latter type of oligoffuctose, also called fructo-oligosaccharide, always has<br>
a terminal glucose residue, since it is derived from sucrose. Typically, this<br>
oligoffuctose has a DP ranging from 3 to 5. Contrary to the oligofructose derived from<br>
inulin hydrolysis, this type contains other linkage types in addition to the β-(2-&gt;l)-<br>
bonds, be it in limited numbers. For purpose of the invention, fructo-oligosaccharide is<br>
preferred. This type of oligofructose contains less free sucrose and/or fructose and has a<br>
fixed distribution of polymerisation. The terminal reducing sugar group of fructo-<br>
oligosaccharide is a glucose residue, which is less reactive in Maillard reaction than the<br><br>
terminal fructose residue of most of the oligofructose derived from inuline. The latter<br>
may result in undesired browning reactions.<br>
Furthermore, in the second and third embodiments of the invention,<br>
represented in tables 11 and 12, resistant maltodextrins are also used as prebiotic fibre<br>
in the fibre composition. These resistant maltodextrins are also called resistant dextrins,<br>
indigestible dextrins. maltodextrins, digestion resistant maltodextrins or just dextrins.<br>
. Resistant maltodextrins are glucose polymers having primarily α-(l-&gt;4) and<br>
α-(l-&gt;6) glycosidic linkages found in starch and also additional glycosidic linkages<br>
normally not found in starch. They have a more highly branched structure than amylose<br>
and amylopectin as found in starch. Due to their overall tertiary chemical structure they<br>
are resistant to digestion,' which means that they are not broken down by human<br>
digestive enzymes. Nevertheless, resistant maltodextrin exhibits all or nearly all the<br>
technological properties of digestible maltodextrins.<br>
Part of the resistant maltodextrin, i.e. oligosaccharide resistant maltodextrin,<br>
can be classified as oligosaccharide and part of the resistant maltodextrin, .i.e.<br>
polysaccharide resistant maltodextrin, can be classified as polysaccharide,<br>
In the second embodiment of the invention, represented in table 11, resistant<br>
maltodextrin is present in an amount up to 20 weight %, preferably 10 to 15 weight %.<br>
About 40 to 60 weight % of the resistant maltodextrin is oligosaccharide resistant<br>
maltodextrin and has a DP below 10. Preferably about 50 % of the resistant<br>
maltodextrin has a DP above 11.<br>
Compared to oligofructose, resistant maltodextrin offers the advantage that<br>
there is no sudden and excessive fermentation in the large intestine that can cause<br>
flatulence, abdominal pain and/or diarrhoea.<br>
One of the most important roles of oligofructose, resistant maltodextrin,<br>
inuhn and polydextrose in the compositions according to the present invention lies in<br>
their prebiotic properties. Combining short chain, i.e. DP up to 10, and long chain, i.e.<br>
DP ranging from 10 up to 60, prebiotic fibres assures that a selective energy source is<br>
available for beneficial bacteria along the colon, from the beginning to the end. Short<br>
chain fibres, e.g. oligofructose, are fermented first, in the beginning of the colon, Long<br>
chain fibres, e.g. inuhn, are available for fermentation during the transit in the colon up<br>
to the. end of the color. This results in the production of SCFA along the complete<br><br>
trajectory in the colon and a corresponding overall reduction of the pH in the colon.<br>
Due to the lower pH, uptake of Ca and Mg is improved along the complete colon.<br>
Polydextrose is also not digested or absorbed in the small intestine, but partially<br>
fermented in the large intestine. Fermentation of polydextrose also leads to the growth<br>
of favourable microflora, diminished putrefactive microflora and enhanced production<br>
of short chain fatty acids. This; leads to increased faecal bulk, reduced transit time,<br>
softer stools and lover faecal pH, from 4 to 9.<br>
Another important role of oligofructose, resistant maltodextrin, inulin and<br>
polydextrose in the compositions according to the present invention is to provide at least<br>
the same functionality to the sugar replacement composition as sucrose. It is important<br>
that products containing the sugar replacement composition can be processed in the<br>
same manner as products which contain sucrose. Further, those processed products<br>
should have the same properties with regard to, for instance, palatability and<br>
appearance.<br>
Although oligofructose has also low sweetness intensity, which is inversely<br>
correlated with the DP, the sweetness is provided for by the sweetener composition as<br>
discussed above. The sweetener composition can only partially replace the functionality<br>
of sucrose such as sweetness. It is, for instance, not suitable for obtaining the same<br>
brown colouring effect or caramelizing effect as sucrose when heated.<br>
According to the second and third embodiments of the invention, the sugar<br>
replacement composition can contain four prebiotic fibres, i.e, oligofructose, resistant<br>
maltodextrin, inulin and polydextrose, in fixed ratios, Combining oligofructose,<br>
resistant maltodextrin, inulin and polydextrose, according to the invention, results in an<br>
optimal sugar substitute with regard to e.g. the capability of caramelization of the<br>
product or, e.g, for baked food products, the ability to be processed, the brown<br>
colouring effect and the brilliance of the crust.<br>
The presence of oligofructose is necessary for certain applications such as-<br>
baked products in which a brown colouring is required. The concentration of<br>
oligofructose should not be too high, i.e. not higher than 30 weight % and preferably not<br>
higher than 25 weight %, in order to prevent a too high brown colouring effect during<br>
baking processes. Compared to oligofructose derived from inulin, fructo-<br>
oligosaccharide has the advantage that its reducing sugar groups, i.e. glucose, are less<br><br>
reactive in Maillard reaction. Further, nearly no free fructose or sucrose is present,<br>
winch otherwise could result in undesired brown colouring effects in baited food<br>
products.<br>
With respect to flatulence problems it is preferred that the concentration of<br>
oiigoffuctose should not be higher than 10 weight %. Accordingly, part of the<br>
oligoffuctose in the second and third embodiments of the invention is replaced by<br>
resistant maltodextnr... Preferably, the second and third embodiments of the invention<br>
have a concentration of oligoffuctose between 5 and 10 weight % of the. sugar<br>
replacement composition and a concentration of resistant maltodextrin, including oligo-<br>
and polysaccharide resistant maltodextrin, between 10 and 20 weight % of the sugar<br>
replacement composition,<br>
Further, the presence of oiigoffuctose is required in certain baked food<br>
products for obtaining a brilliant crust which would also be obtained by using sucrose.<br>
Leaving oat one of the four prebiotic fibres from e.g. the second or the third<br>
embodiments of th= invention may result in food products'that are less acceptable<br>
regarding the ability to be processed, the brown colouring and brilliance of the crust, but<br>
can be acceptable for certain applications such as for example sweet liquid food drinks,<br>
such as coffee, tea, soif drinks.<br>
The prebiotic, non digestible oiigo- and polysaccharides fulfil dual roles in<br>
the sugar replacement composition: they are versatile ingredients, which function as<br>
functional and bulk sugar replacements, and as source of prebiotic fibres.<br>
■Furthermore, basic formulations of the present invention supplemented with<br>
prebiotic bacterial strains belonging to for instance either the Bifidobacterium or<br>
Lactobacillus genus, provides both the probiotic strains and a selective energy source,<br>
resulting in a so-called symbiotic effect. In this way, the gut flora is supplemented with<br>
fresh bacteria, then: nutrition, and also nutrition for existing beneficial microflora, which<br>
enriches the microbial population of the human colon.<br>
The increase in microbial population is only one result of fibre intake and<br>
assimilation. Due to digestion of fibres present in the basic formulation, short chain<br>
fatty acids are produced which lower the pH in the colon. This pH drop is important for<br>
e.g. Cα- and Mg-uptake, which are essential minerals,<br><br>
In order to further improve the functionality of the sugar replacement<br>
composition, insoluble, non selective, non digestible polysaccharides may be added to<br>
the sugar replacement composition according to the second and third embodiments of<br>
the invention, as represented in tables 11 and 12. These polysaccharides may be present<br>
in an amount of 0,0: weight % to 10 weight %.<br>
The amount of soluble and insoluble fibres ma}' be determined by one of the<br>
following anaiyticai methods: Mongeau R. and Brassard R., Enzymatic gravimetric<br>
determination in foods of dietary fibre as the sum cf insoluble and soluble fibre<br>
fractions: summary of collaborative study, J. AOAC Int. 76:923-925, 1993; and Prosky<br>
L. et al, Determination of total dietary fibre in foods and food products: collaborative<br>
study, J. Assoc. Off. Anal, Chem. 68:677-679, 1985.<br>
Examples of insoluble, non selective, non digestible polysaccharides are<br>
cellulose and hemicel'miose that are present in, for instance, cereal fibre such as wheat<br>
fibre.<br>
■ Advantageously, in the second and third embodiments of the invention,<br>
wheat fibres are used that have an average length between 20 and 80 um and preferably ■<br>
of 30 urn.. They consist of approximately 76 weight % of cellulose and 24 weight % of<br>
hemicellulose. For baked products the combination of ohgofructose and these wheat'<br>
fibres result in a crusl colour and brilliance that is similar 10 the crust appearance that<br>
would be obtained when using sucrose. Further, this also results in a homogeneous<br>
crumb of the baked food products which is similar to the crumb obtained by using<br>
sucrose.<br>
The use cf ohgofructose in the sugar replacement composition without<br>
wheat fibres may result in a too dark crust and crumb of the baked products. "Wheat<br>
fibres have indeed a bleaching effect.<br>
For certain applications, die amount of insoluble fibres in the sugar replacer<br>
should be limited to e.g. below 5 weight % and preferably below 3 weight %. Higher<br>
amounts may result in an undesired fibre texture when sugar is being replaced in, for<br>
instance, recipes wherein the sugar is melted and/or caramelized.<br>
These non digestible, insoluble fibres also show some health promoting<br>
effects in, for instance, the prevention of constipation and die decrease of glucose levels<br>
in the blood of people with diabetes.<br><br>
Further, soluble, non selective, non digestible polysaccharides can be added<br>
to the sugar replacement composition according to the third and a fourth embodiment of<br>
the invention, as represented in tables 12 and 13. These polysaccharides may be present<br>
in. an amount of 0,05 weight % to 10 weight %:<br><br>
Examples of soluble, non selective, non digestible polysaccharides are<br>
xanthan, tara, carrageenan, tragacanth, locust bean gum, agar, guar gum, arable gum,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, and pectin.<br>
These polysaccharides increase the water retention in the final food product<br>
which results in increased shelf life and softness.<br>
In the third embodiment of the invention, represented in table 12, kappa<br>
carrageenan can be added in an amount between 0,05 and 2 weight %, preferably<br>
between 0,05 and 1 weight.%, about 0,5 weight %.<br>
In particular, addition of carboxymethylcellulose, or a co-processed blend of<br>
carboxymethylcellulose with micro crystalline cellulose, in die fourth embodiment of the<br>
sugar replacement composition also provides the food preparation with the desired<br>
viscosity, which would also be obtained by using sugar.<br>
These non selective polysaccharides do not selectively promote growth and<br>
proliferation of beneficial bacteria in the colon, but are non selectively fermented into<br>
short chain fart}' acids (SCFA), which are important for the prevention of colon cancer.<br>
In particular, .butyric acid, which is the most important energy source for epithelium ■<br>
cells, is important in this respect. Interestingly, combining intake of guar and pectin has<br>
a synergistic effect on production of butyric acid in the colon. Further, these soluble,<br><br>
non selective, non digestible polysaccharides, such as carboxyrnefhylcelhilose, may also<br>
reduce fat absorption.<br>
Too high intake of .prebiotic or other non digestible poly- and<br>
oligosaccharides-may result in flatulence and may also have a laxative effect as also<br>
discussed above. A too high dose of some polyols may have similar effects. Soluble,<br>
non selective, non digestible polysaccharides such as guar gum, arabic gum,<br>
carboxycellulose and pectin suppress these effects. It is also within the scope of the<br>
present invention to include one or more anti-flatulence agents, such as dimethicon,<br>
activated charcoal, and simethicom(i.e., dimethicon activated by Si02). There are also<br>
some natural anti-flatulence agents that may be used, provided that the taste of the anti-<br>
flatulent agsnt itself does not interfere with the intended use. Typical natural anti-<br>
flatulence agents are based on chili, capsaicin, garlic, ginger, krachai, lemon grassland<br>
tumeric.<br>
Optional;;.' an anti-caking agent such as SiO; is used in the formulations<br>
according to the present invention. Many ingredients in the food industry tend to show<br>
poor flow properties and cake when stored, SiCb shows a high absorption capacity, thus<br>
drylng the surface of '.he food ingredients particles and subsequently preventing them<br>
from sticking together. Furthermore, they keep the particles apart and allow them to<br>
glide past each other. SiOa is used in an amount between 0,1 and 0,5 weight %.<br>
Wheat fibres included in the second, third and fourth embodiments also<br>
have anti-caking properties,<br>
A fifth specific embodiment of the invention is represented in table 14,<br><br><br>
(*) amount sufficient to provide to the sugar replacement composition a sweetness about equal to the<br>
sweetness of sugar.<br>
A sixth and seventh specific embodiment of the invention concern a partial<br>
sugar replacement composition according to the invention in which sugar is still present.<br>
These embodiments are represented in tables 15 and 16.<br><br>
In the sixth specific embodiment sugar is used in combination with as<br>
bulking fibre composition containing inulin and resistant maltodextrin and optionally<br>
also polydextrose and ohgofructose,<br><br>
In the seventh specific embodiment, sugar is used together with<br>
polydextrose and oligofructose, and preferably also resistant maJtodextrin and inulin.<br>
Further, a high intensity sweetener is added in an amount sufficient to provide to the<br>
mixture a sweetness about equal to the sweetness of sugar.<br>
in the following, some examples of basic formulations for a sugar<br>
replacement composition according to the invention are given. Further, some examples<br>
of food preparations are given for the illustration of the invention.<br>
In. the first four examples, basic formulations for sugar replacement<br>
compositions according to the present invention are given. These, formulations allow<br>
replacing sugar in e.g. cakes on a weight by weight basis, without negative effects on<br>
taste, appearance, texture and palatability. The precise amounts of the different<br>
ingredients can of course be varied to some degree.<br>
In the first example of a basic formulation for a sugar replacement<br>
composition, according to the first embodiment of die invention, the following<br>
ingredients are mixed 10 form the 1/1 weight sugar replacement composition:<br><br><br><br>
In the third example of a basic formulation for a sugar replacement<br>
composition, according to the third embodiment of the invention, the following<br>
ingredients are mixed io form the 1/1 weight sugar replacement composition:<br><br>
In the fourth example of a basic formulatici: for a sugar replacement<br>
composition, according to the fourth embodiment of the invention, the following<br>
ingredients are mixed to form the 1/1 weight sugar replacement composition:<br><br><br>
A fifth example concerns a recipe for "quatre quarts cake" in which the<br>
following ingredients are used:<br>
-	3 medium sized eggs;<br>
-	22,5 ml skimmed milk;<br>
' - 225 g flour;<br>
-	140 g butter;<br>
-	1.5 ml of vanilla flavour; and<br>
-	225 g of sugar replacement composition of the third example.<br>
The eggs and the milk are mixed with the sugar replacement composition.<br>
Soft or slightly heated butter is added, using a wooden spatula. Subsequently, the flour<br>
is putted through a sieve and carefully added. The whole is well blended into a smooth<br>
paste. The vanilla flavour is added. The dough is poured in a buttered rectangular<br>
baking pan and baked in a warm oven at 175 °C, for about 60 minutes. The blade of a<br>
knife should come out clean and dry if the cake is ready. The cake is taken out of the<br>
oven and tinrnoulded Leave to cool.<br>
In a sixth example, basic biscuits are prepared, which arc fortified with<br>
calcium ("calcium fortified cookies"). Due to the presence of prebiotic fibres in the<br>
sugar replacement composition, the calcium absorbability will be increased.<br>
The following ingredients are used for "calcium fortified cookies";<br>
-	100 g flour;<br>
-	100.g butter;<br>
-	105 g sugar replacement of the composition of the first example;<br>
-	3 medium sized eggs;<br>
-	1 ml vanilla flavouring;<br>
-	5,2 g calcium citrate.4H2O.<br>
Mix the butter, sugar replacement composition of the first example and the<br>
vanilla flavouring to obtain a smooth dough. Subsequently add the beaten eggs and the<br>
sieved flour. Mix the whole composition, without beating to avoid too much air in the<br>
mixture. Grease the baking plate and spout the dough in 8 cm bars on a distance of app.<br>
5 cm. Bake the cookies during 10 minutes in a preheated oven at 150-175 °C. After<br>
baking, immediately remove the cookies from the tray and leave them to cool on a grid. ' •<br><br>
By using the basic formulation of the sugar replacement composition of the.<br>
second and third example, the amount of fat, i.e. butter used in most recipes can be<br>
reduced to 70 % or even 50 %. In the fifth example the fat has been reduced to 70 %<br>
compared to a cake prepared with sugar, without giving up taste, appearance and<br>
texture. When using oil, e.g. coleseed oil, in stead of butter, a further reduction in fat to<br>
30% can be obtained.<br>
Properties, such as taste,- appearance and texture, of the prepared food<br>
products of examples five and six, are not distinguishable from the properties of these<br>
food products prepared with sucrose. Similar results are obtained when the sugar<br>
replacement composite on of the third example is used in the recipe of the sixth example<br>
or when the sugar replacement composition of the second example is used in the recipes<br>
of the fifth and sixth examples. It should be clear mat the sugar replacement<br>
compositions of the first, second, third and fourth examples can be used hi both the<br>
recipes of the fifth and sixth examples.<br>
A seventh example concerns another recipe for "cake", in which the<br>
following ingredients are used:<br>
-	500 g eggs;<br>
-	lOOgmhk;<br>
-	500 g flour;<br>
-	300 g butter;<br>
-	60 g coleseed oil;<br>
-	S ml vanilla flavour; and<br>
-	500 g sugar replacement composition of the third example.<br>
Preheat oven to 230 °C. Cream the butter until softened. Mix the eggs and<br>
vanilla extract by hand, add milk and mix again. Add sugar and mix vigorously in a<br>
food processor. Blend in the soft butter and oil to make a soft dough. Fold in the flour<br>
and mix thoroughly. Pipe 30 g of the mix into small paper cake moulds and place on a<br>
wire rack, When put in oven lower temperature direct!}' to 200 °C. Bake for 28<br>
minutes. Lower temperature during baking process and bake last 10 minutes at 160 °C.<br>
The thus prepared bilked products, with either the sugar replacement<br>
composition or the same amount of sugar, were subjected to a consumer acceptance test<br>
performed by V-G Sensor)', Demze, Belgiµm. A taste panel of 62 respondents<br><br>
composed of 50 % of men and 50 % of women, of which 31 % between 18 and 35 years<br>
old, 35 % between 56 and 50 years old, and 34 % older than 50 years, were asked to<br>
taste a cake with sugar and a cake with the sugar replacer, prepared according to the<br>
. above mentioned recipe and procedure. The following criteria were evaluated:<br>
-	crumb color,<br>
-	crust color,<br>
-	mouthibel,	v<br>
-	taste<br>
Brief Description of Accompanylng Drawings<br>
Figure I shows the results, obtained by the ta.ste panel, on a 9-point score,<br>
where "1" means extremely poor quality and "9" means excellent quality. Chi-squared<br>
statistic and Kolmogorov-Srnimov test were used to determine significant differences<br>
among the obtained results. From these tests, it was concluded that - for both the crumb<br>
color and mouthfeei - those cakes prepared with the sugar replacement composition<br>
according to the invention, scored significantly better than the sugar containing calces.<br>
The overall conclusicn of the statistical evaluation was that "there is a tendency to<br>
significance: sugar-free cakes are preferred over sugar-containing cakes",<br>
An eighth example concerns a recipe for "butter cookies" in which the<br>
following ingredients are used:<br>
-	150 g eggs;<br>
-	410 g flour;<br>
-	260 g pasteurized butter;<br>
-	4 g salt;<br>
-	4 ml vanilla flavour; and<br>
-	200 g sugar replacement composition of the third example.<br>
Preheat oven to 165 °C. Cream the butter until softened. Place slightly<br>
beared eggs, vanilla extract and salt in a food processor. Blend in the soft butter to<br>
make a soft dough. Sift together the flour and sugar. Fold in the flour-sugar mixture<br>
and mix gently. Pips onto un greased baking plate. Baxc at 165 °C for 14 minutes,<br>
until golden and slightly browned around the edges. Cool the cookies on a wne rack.<br>
The thus , prepared baked products, with either the sugar replacement<br>
composition or the same amount of sugar, were subjected to a consumer acceptance test<br>
performed by V-G Sensor)', Denize, Belgiµm. A taste panel of 62 respondents<br><br>
composed of 50 % of men and 50 % of women, of which 3 : % between 18 and. 35 years<br>
old, 35 % between 35 and 50 years old. and 34 % older than 50 years, were asked to<br>
taste cookies with sugar and a cookies with the sugar replacer according to the<br>
invention, prepared according to the above mentioned recipe and procedure. The<br>
following criteria were evaluated:<br>
-	color,<br>
-	mouthfeel,<br>
-	taste,<br>
Figure 2 shows the results obtained by the taste panel, on a 9-point score,<br>
where"!" means extremely poor quality and "9" means excellent quality. Cht-squared<br>
statistic and Kolmogorov-Smimov test were .used to determine significant differences<br>
among the obtained results. The overall conclusion of the statistical evaluation was that<br>
"there is a tendency to significance: sugar-free cookies are preferred over sugar-<br>
containing cookies".<br>
The sugar replacement composition according to the present invention is<br>
perfectly capable of replacing sugar in jams or pastry cream. Moreover, the gelling<br>
properties of these jams axe improved by substituting sugar.<br>
Sugar is essential in the gelling process of jams, preserves, jellies, pastry<br>
creams, custards, ... to obtain the desired consistency and firmness. This gelling<br>
process causes fruit juices to be enmeshed in a network of fibres. For the preparation of<br>
sugar containing jams, usually pectin is added since it is a naturally occurring<br>
compound in fruits, and it has the ability to form a gsl in the presence of sugar and acid.<br>
Sugar is an essential component, because it attracts and holes water during the gelling<br>
process.<br>
Replacing sugar by the sugar replacement composition according to the<br>
invention in fruit jams and marmalades has also the advantage that no supplementary<br>
gelling agents need to be added. Compared to jams made with sugar, gelling occurs<br>
faster and remains better,<br>
A ninth example concerns the gelation of jams in which the following<br>
ingredients are used:<br>
-	1.750 g strawberries; and<br>
-	1.312,5 g sugar replacement composition of the third example.<br><br>
After cleaning and washing the ripe strawberries, mash the fruit. Place<br>
strawberries on a cooking ring and simmer over a low hear until the fruit has softened<br>
and become mush}1. Add sugar or the sugar replacer, and mix well until sugar/sugar<br>
replacer is completely dissolved. Raise the heat and boil for another 20 minutes.<br>
By determining both the linear visco-elastic range (LVR) and phase angle in<br>
an oscillatory viscosity measurement, gel strength can be measured accurately without<br>
destroylng the network that creates the gel. The methods tor these tests are described<br>
more in detail in: Mitchell, J.R. (1980), The Theology of gels, Journal of Texture<br>
Studies, 11, 315-337; Stading, M. (1991), Gel structure and rheology in. theory and<br>
practice - a literature review. SIK-report, 553, 207 p; and Stanley, D.W. et al. (1996).<br>

Figure 3 illustrates the results of the test performed at Ghent University,<br>
Ghent, Belgiµm, where the gel strength of jam with sugar and sugar replacer are<br>
compared at refrigerator temperature, i.e. 6°C. Figure 4 show the: results of a similar<br>
test performed at room temperature, i.e. 25 °C, The gel formed in the jam prepared with<br>
the composition according to the invention, is stronger than when sugar is used, This<br>
can be derived from the higher complex modulus, i.e. G"1-value, and the larger LVR.<br>
Pastry creams often need to be frozen and subsequently unfrozen. Shelving,<br>
freezing and unfreezing may cause loss of water resulting in a layer of water on top of<br>
the pastry cream prepared with sugar. A tenth example concerns the gelation of pastry<br>
creams in which the following ingredients .are used:<br>
-	51 g egg yolk;<br>
-	50 g egg;<br>
-	SO g com flour;<br>
-1.000 g milk;<br>
-	4 ml vanilla extract; and<br>
-	250 g sugar replacement composition of the third example.<br>
Under continuous stirring, add the vanilla extract, egg white and yolk, sugar<br>
or sugar replacer; and finally the com flour to the cold milk. Bring to boiling<br><br>
temperature and stir for another two minutes. Cool dowr. gently by placing the bowl<br>
containing the pastry cream in an ice bath,<br>
Pastry creams containing the sugar replacement composition according to<br>
the invention, have better water retention qualities resulting in higher shelf life. Further,<br>
the gelling of the pastry cream occurs faster with the sugar replacement composition<br>
compared to sugar. Figure 5 illustrates the results of a test, as described above,<br>
performed at Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium where the gelation behaviour of pastry<br>
cream prepared with sugar, and prepared with sugar substituted by the sugar xeplacer are<br>
compared.<br>
An eleventh example concerns whipped cream in which the following<br>
ingredients are used:<br>
-	41,87 g polydextrose;<br>
-	9,60 g resistant maltodextrine;<br>
-	6,40 g iructo-oligosaccharide;<br>
-	5,60 g mulin;<br>
-	0,40 g carrageenan;<br>
-	16,00 g isomalt;<br>
-	0,12 g sucraLose;<br>
-	420 g cream with 40 % fat content; and<br>
-	4 ml vanilla extract.<br>
Two different methods were used for preparing whipped cream.<br>
In a first method, sugar or sugar replacer are mixed with 40 % fat cream<br>
before they are dissolved. This immediate mixing of the cream with sugar did not result<br>
in a stable whipped cream. In contrast, the immediate mixing of the cream with sugar<br>
replacer did result in a stable whipped cream.<br>
In a second method, sugar or sugar replacer are dissolving in 40 % fat cream<br>
prior to mixing, This resulted for both sugar and the sugar replacer in a stable foam.<br>
The stabilisation of whipped cream was analysed by Ghent University,<br>
Ghent, Belgium by using the methods as described in detail by Moor &amp; Rapaille, 1982<br>
H. Moor and A. Rapaille, Evaluation of starches and gums in pasteunsed whipping<br>
cream. In: G.O. Phillips, DJ. Wedlock and P.A. Williams, Editors, Progress in food and<br>
nutrition science 6, Pergamon Press, Oxford (19S2), pp. 199-207.<br><br>
As shown in table 17, a higher volume of foam is obtained for cream with<br>
sugar replacer compared to cream with sugar when whipping during the same period of<br>
time.<br><br>
Further, the stability of the foam is higher when prepared using the sugar<br>
replacer, as illustrated by the spiral depth measured after 12 seconds. This parameter<br>
refers to the depth to which a spiral drops in a period of 12 seconds, when released on<br>
the surface of the whipped cream and is measured with a Slagsahne Prufgerat apparatus<br>
according to the previously mentioned method described by Moor &amp; Rapaille (1982).<br>
In whipped cream production, both stabilization and volume of the foam is<br>
improved by substituting sugar by the sugar replacement composition according to the<br>
invention.<br>
A twelfth example concerns preparation of caramel, in which the following<br>
ingredients are used:<br>
-	42,365 g polydextrose;<br>
-	12 g resistant maltodextrine;<br>
-	8 g fructo-oligosaccharide;<br>
-	7 g inulin;<br>
-	0,5 g carrageenan;<br>
-	20 g isomalt;<br>
-	0,135 g sucralose; and<br>
-	100 g water.<br>
The above, composition is heated to cooking temperature, Further heat<br>
treatment is applied until the water present in the mixture has completely evaporated.<br>
From then on, temperatures ranging between 150 °C and 170 °C are maintained, until a<br>
desired degree of caramelization has occurred. The caramel can be prepared without<br>
addition of sugar or glucose syrups, thus obtaining a low-calorie, fibre-rich caramel with<br><br>
a similar texture and mouthfeel compared to caramels made from sucrose or sugar<br>
syrups.<br>
Consequently, the sugar replacement composition according to the current<br>
invention can be used as a perfect ingredient mix for the preparation of caramel, in<br>
which oligofructose and/or fructo-oligosaccharides having a DP
caramelization reaction. As a result of this reaction, the typical caramel flavour is<br>
obtained, whereas the presence of the remaining ingredients delivers the pleasant<br>
mouthfeel usually obtained by use of sucrose.<br>
It was expected that the generation of flavours and colours in thermally<br>
induced caramelization requires sugars, normally monosaccharide structures, to initiate<br>
the reaction. However, analysis of the above composition, performed by SGS Belgium<br>
nv, indicates that the amounts of reducing sugars in the product are as follows;<br>
-	
-	
-	0,8 % sucrose.<br>
These figures show that the amount of free sugars, is too low to initiate the<br>
caramelization reaction, and it has subsequently been proven that oligofructose and/or<br>
fructo-oiigosaccharide act as the starting material for this reaction. The hypothesis is<br>
that due to the heat treatment, the α-1,2 and β-2,1 bonds are broken-down, generating<br>
reducing sugars which can then in turn be converted to the typical components of a<br>
caramel flavour: furans, furanones, pyrones and carbocyclics. A similar thermal<br>
degradation has been described for maltotriose (α-1,4 bonded glucose), which indicated<br>
that 3-deoxypentosulose was formed, by a pathway specific for oligo- and<br>
polysaccharides since it was formed from the α-l,4-glucans (Hollnagel &amp; Kroh, 2002,<br>
Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 50(6), 1659-1664). However, similar<br>
routes for degradation of 'jJ-2,1 -fructans have not been described.<br>
Consequently, for this application the degree of polymerization of the<br>
oligofructose and/or fructo-oiigosaccharide is of utmost importance and should be lower<br>
than 10, preferably lower than 8, and even more preferably between 3 and 5. Fructans<br>
with a DP higher than 10 are not suitable for initiation of the caramelization reaction,<br>
not even when they contain a contamination with up to 10 % of mono- and<br>
disaccharides.<br><br>
A thirteenth example concerns the preparation of "butterscotch" caramel,<br>
in which the same ingredients as for the twelfth example are used, but wherein the water<br>
is replaced by 100 g cream with a fat content of 40 %. Further, a small amount, e.g.<br>
approximately 5 g, of butter is added.<br>
In chocolate, the replacement of sugar is a difficult task since the smooth<br>
mouth feel, specific texture and flavour in these fat-sugar systems is hard to mimic<br>
without the addition of sucrose. A fourteenth example concerns chocolate, in which<br>
the following ingredients are used:<br>
-	18,33 gpolydextrose<br>
-	4,20 g resistant maltodextrine;<br>
-	2.80 g fructo-oligosaccharide;<br>
-	2,45 g inulin;<br>
-	0,18 gcarrageenan;<br>
-	7,00 g isomalt;<br>
-	0,05 g sucralose;<br>
-	10 g Cacao butter; and<br>
-	55 g cacao mass containing 55 % cacao butter;<br>
A fifteenth example concerns chocolate, in which the following ingredients<br>
are used:<br>
-	20,42 g polydexrrose<br>
-	4,68 g resistant maltodextrine;<br>
-	3,12 g fructo-oligosaccharide;<br>
-	2,73 g inulin;<br>
-	0,20 g carrageenan;<br>
-	7,80 g isomalt;<br>
-	0,05 g sucralose;<br>
-	22 g Cacao butter; and<br>
-	39 g cacao mass containing 55 % cacao butter;<br>
Replacement of sugar by the sugar replacement composition according to<br>
the invention as in examples fourteen and fifteen results in a perfect chocolate' with<br>
improved properties, attributed to the specific composition of this all-purpose sugar<br>
replacer.<br><br>
A sixteenth example concerns a partial sugar replacement composition still<br>
containing an amount of sucrose.<br>
The sugar replacement composition according to the invention, in particular<br>
according to one of the previous examples of the basic formulation, can be used in<br>
combination with sugar. A partial sugar replacement composition is obtained by<br>
combining the sugar replacement composition and sugar. Accordingly, the sugar<br>
replacement composition is added to sugar in concentrations up to e.g. 10 % or more,<br>
the weight of the partial sugar replacement composition being 100 %. Hence, the sugar<br>
replacement composition according to the invention, can also be used to partially<br>
replace sugar, i.e. ranging from a sugar "improver", replacing up-to 10 % of the sugar,<br>
to a complete sugar "replacer", replacing up to 100 % of the sugar.<br>
In this respect, it is also possible, according to the invention, to replace the<br>
low intensity sweetener of the sugar replacement composition by sugar, such that a<br>
partial sugar replacement composition is obtained. The amount of high intensity<br>
sweetener of this partial sugar replacement composition should be adapted in order to<br>
obtain a sweetness of about equal the sweetness of sucrose.<br>
This results in a sugar containing composition being functionally improved<br>
W2th respect to sugar.<br>
Furthermore, certain vitamins and minerals can be added to the basic<br>
formulation, consisting of a specific combination of the ingredients described above.<br>
More specific, the vitamins and minerals needed to approach the nutritional value of<br>
fruits and vegetables can be added to the formulation. In this respect, the composition<br>
of the sugar substitute can be adapted according to the fruit or vegetable that needs to be<br>
simulated. Using this approach, tasty, healthy foods can be prepared which additionally<br>
provide the essential minerals, vitamins and fibres normally absorbed through<br>
consumption of fruits and vegetables.' In that way, people do not'need to change their<br>
nutritional habits in order to assimilate the essential and vital elements necessary to<br>
maintain a good health. Functional foods can be prepared, replacing sucrose by the<br>
basic formulation, according to the invention, supplemented with vitamins and minerals<br>
to mimic the desired fruit or vegetable composition.<br>
The minerals that can be added to the basic composition comprise: calciµm,<br>
magnesiµm, potassium and phosphorus. The vitamins that can be added to the basic<br><br>
composition comprise; vitamin C, B, A, K and E. Further, trace elements such as<br>
seleniµm, iron and zinc can be added.<br>
According to the present invention, certain health promoting bacteria can be<br>
added to the basic formulation of the sugar replacement as described above. More<br>
specifically, probiotic species of the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus can be<br>
' added. In this invention the combination of polydextrose, inulin, oligofructose and<br>
resistant maltodextrin specifically results in an overall drop of the: pH since it has been<br>
proven that oligofructose and oligosaccharide resistant maltodextrin are fermented in<br>
the upper part of the colon, while polysaccharide resistant maltodextrin, polydextrose<br>
and inulin are not fermented till the lower part of the colon. This overall pH drop<br>
creates a more favourable environment for Cα- and Mg-uptake, due to the improved<br>
solubility of these minerals. This effect is particularly important in preventing<br>
osteoporosis.<br>
Such a specific formulation can be.added to ice cream and frozen desserts or<br>
other cold stored food products that do not need heat processing before consumption,<br>
Due to the cold or freezing temperatures, there is low or no risk of pre-hydrolysis of the<br>
fibres prior to ingestion.<br>
Similarly, it is conceivable to use the sugar replacement composition of the<br>
present invention in formulations for drugs, food supplements and/or pseudo-drugs,<br>
especially, if the above-mentioned additional components vitamins, minerals and/or<br>
probiotic bacteria are also present.<br>
A seventeenth- example therefore concerns a luxury ice cream, prepared on<br>
a pilot .scale level, with controlled over-run. The trial was performed at LinTech<br>
(Reading Scientific Services Limited), Reading, UK. A pilot plant scale trial was carried<br>
out to produce a 50kg batch of a formulation with either sugar or the sugar replacing<br>
product according to the invention, with controlled over-run. The following table<br>
describes the formulation of both ice cream types:<br><br><br><br>
The functional sugar replacer used was composed as shown in the following<br>
table, although it should be understood that alternative sugar replacer compositions<br>
within the scope of the appended claims may also be used.<br><br>
During the freezing process, the over-run was controlled at 500-600 g/1,<br>
Various evaluations were carried out on the ice creams including sensory, melt rate and<br>
cycle tests.<br>
Sensory comments were made after all the ice creams had been removed<br>
from the freezer and allowed to warm up for 15 minutes. Sensory testing was carried<br>
out blind, in that the samples were coded. Products were assessed by a panel of 7-9<br>
respondents, from within LinTech, who were given a randomly coded sample of each<br>
ice cream and asked to comment on the chosen attributes.<br><br>
The test and control ice creams were judged to be extremely similar in all<br>
aspects. In appearance it was noted that the.test ice cream was slightly whiter in colour<br>
than the control. Both samples were assessed as having a creamy, sweet vanilla flavour.<br>
In regards to mouthfeel, both samples were considered to have a smooth and creamy<br>
texture.<br>
Melt Rate Test: The principle behind this test was to see how quickly the<br>
different ice creams melted. This was carried out by placing a known weight of ice<br>
cream on a wire mesh and weighing how much ice cream melted through the mesh over<br>
a set time period.<br>
It was found that the sucrose control ice cream melted at a faster rate than<br>
the test ice cream.<br>
For both the test and control samples, the ice cream that was remaining after<br>
360 minutes was warm and mousse-like in texture. After 360 minutes the following<br>
percentages of ice cream had melted: Control 18.7%, Test 12.4%.<br>
The cycle test was carried out on each of the samples. Over a three-day<br>
period samples were taken out of the freezer and left at room temperature, without lids<br>
on the tubs, for half an hour, They were then placed back in the freezer and the same<br>
process repeated the following day. On the fourth day the tubs were removed from the<br>
freezer and evaluated against un-cycled samples.<br>
Some differences between the cycled and un-cycled samples were noted but<br>
it was not felt that any of the two ice creams had changed dramatically. All products<br>
were felt to be acceptable and similar observations were seen in both the control and test<br>
samples.<br>
Owing to the superior structural and Theological properties imparted to food<br>
products containing or prepared with the sugar replacer of the prssent invention, it is<br>
also possible to use these products to reduce the fat content of food products whilst<br>
maintaining satisfactory structural, theological and/or organoleptic properties of the<br>
full-fat food product. Typical applications of this embodiment of the invention are low-<br>
fat ice cream, low-fat cookies, low-fat chocolate chocolate, low-fat cake, and low-fat<br>
chocolate spread.<br>
In the production of ice cream it is, for instance, possible that the fat content<br>
can be reduced by 50% when it is prepared using the sugar replacer, without loosing the<br><br>
creamy mouthfeel of the ice cream. Thus, the functional sugar replacer not only allows<br>
to replace all the sugar, it also allows to partially reduce the fat in certain recipes.<br>
An example of an ice cream recipe in which the fat content has been<br>
reduced by 50%, is given in the table below:<br><br>
The functional sugar replacer is composed ideally as described in the<br>
previous example.<br>
Thus, the sugar replacement composition according to the invention can<br>
replace sugar in ice cream, particularly in scoop ice cream. Moreover, the amount of fat<br>
can be reduced in ice cream containing the sugar replacement composition according to<br>
the invention. Sugar and fat are important for the softness of ice cream and the ability<br>
to scoop frozen ice cream. The resulting low calorie ice cream has a softness that can<br>
be even higher than ice cream containing sugar.<br>
Sugar and also salt are added to food products in order to bind water in the<br>
food products. Examples of these food products are sugar cured meat products and high<br>
sugar foods such as jams.<br><br>
Sugar cured meat products are meat products, such as ham, to which sugar,<br>
salt, nitrite, nitrate and/or saltpetre are added for the. purpose of flavour, colour and<br>
preservation. Sugar binds water in the food, enhances the flavour and counteracts the<br>
harshness of salt. It may also act as an energy source for bacteria, fungi, moulds and<br>
yeasts. Meat products can be injected with, soaked in or rubbed with a solution of<br>
sugar. Functionally, the sugar replacement composition according to the invention is<br>
perfectly able to replace sugar in these meat applications. The same effects on structure<br>
and flavour are obtained. In addition, replacing sugar by the sugar replacement<br>
composition in these applications has the advantage that no sugar is available for<br>
spoilage bacteria and moulds, but a selective energy source is present for the favourable<br>
microflora of the colon. •<br>
Soft meringue made with the sugar replacement composition according to<br>
the invention has the .same structural stability as soft meringue made with sugar, but the<br>
brilliance is higher. Further, bacterial stability is higher and the risk of contamination<br>
with harmful and spoilage bacteria is lower.<br>
In general, compared to sugar, the sugar replacement composition has better<br>
water retention qualities in food preparations resulting in higher shelf lives and lower<br>
bacterial contamination due to the lower availability of water. The bacterial stability of<br>
these food preparations is higher since, contrary to sugar, the fibre composition is<br>
selectively fermented by beneficial bacteria which can prevent the proliferation of<br>
harmful and spoilage bacteria. Hence, the risk of contamination with harmful and<br>
spoilage bacteria is lower.<br>
The sugar replacement composition according to the invention can be added<br>
to raw meat products, such as raw ham and sausages, for controlling meat fermentation<br>
and enhancing food safety of the fermented meat products. The fibre composition will<br>
selectively promote the proliferation of beneficial bacteria, which in turn will prevent<br>
the proliferation of harmful and/or spoilage bacteria. Starter cultures may be added in<br>
order to ensure the presence of a sufficient amount of beneficial bacteria for the meat<br>
fermentation. These starter cultures should be able to ferment the fibre composition and<br>
to reduce the pH by the production of acids. In order to obtain a fast initial pH<br>
reduction, a fast fermentation of the fibre composition by the starter cultures is required.<br>
It should be clear that the sweetener composition, in particular the high intensity<br><br>
sweetener, is not required for the application in meat fermentation. However, it can be<br>
desired that a sweet taste is present after fermentation. In contrast to sugar, the high<br>
intensity sweetener will not be fermented.<br>
The current product formulation is capable of replacing sugar on a 1/1<br>
weight basis, thus providing food products with a functionality that goes far beyond the<br>
traditional sucrose.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention pertains to the fibre<br>
composition of the sugar replacer of the invention, but containing no sweetener.<br>
Consequently, this fibre composition of the invention is not as sweet as sucrose, and it<br>
may therefore advantageously be used in cases, where the improvement in rheological<br>
and/or structural properties is desired, but without concurrent sweetening effect. Typical<br>
applications are salad dressing, mayonnaise, and the like. All indications provided<br>
above with respect to preferred embodiments of the sugar replacer of the invention<br>
apply mutatis mutandis to the fibre composition embodiment of the present invention,<br>
provided, of course, that no sweetener is present. This means, of course, that all<br>
indications of relative amounts of individual components will in this case be based on<br>
100 weight% of the total fibre composition, containing no sweetener components.<br>
It is furthermore within the scope of the present invention to use the above<br>
fibre composition in combination with a reduced amount of sweetener (as compared<br>
with the sweetener content in the sugar replacer of the present invention), so as to<br>
accomplish a sweetening effect that is, however, less than that of sucrose and also less<br>
than that of the sugar replacer of the present invention. According to this embodiment,<br>
the same sweeteners and in particular high intensity sweeteners may be used as<br>
described above with respect to the sugar replacer of the invention.<br>
The sugar replacer as well as the fibre composition can be obtained simply<br>
by mixing the different ingredients, which then exert synergistic effects and represent a<br>
functional and healthy replacement for sugar in every possible application.<br>
Granulating or agglomerating the sugar replacer offers further advantages<br>
and added value to the product, such as:<br>
-	elimination of product segregation when e.g. ingredients with divergent<br>
particle size distributions are used;<br>
-	homogenous distribution of different components;<br><br>
-	Improvement of the flow properties;<br>
-	lowering of dust formation;<br>
-	visual appearance closer to granulated sugar.<br>
Hence, in order to further imitate sugar, the sugar replacement composition<br>
according to the invention may be granulated. There are several ways of granulation or<br>
agglomeration, which are suitable for the sugar replacement according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Granulation can occur spontaneously by the addition of wateT to the above<br>
described sugar replacement compositions. Possibly granulation can be obtained by the<br>
addition of water containing one or more of the ingredients of the sugar replacement<br>
composition to the remaining ingredients. Polydextrose and polyols are in this respect<br>
most suitable to be dissolved in water before they are added to the remaining ingredients<br>
of the sugar replacement composition.<br>
Agglomeration can be obtained by liquid spraylng during mixing of the<br>
compounds of the sugar replacement composition. In a first stage, low or high shear<br>
mixing technologies are used to obtain a homogenous product composition. During the<br>
second stage of this process, low mixing is continued under the slow addition of a<br>
liquid. The liquid may be pure water, or water in which a part of the product<br>
composition has already been dissolved. Sugar replacer granules with particle sizes<br>
ranging from 500 um to 2000 urn can easily be obtained using this process. Depending<br>
on the amount of liquid sprayed on the sugar replacer composition, a third stage needs<br>
to be added, which includes a drylng step. This drylng step can be performed in<br>
fluidized bed system,<br>
The use of fluidized bed technology to agglomerate the sugar replacement<br>
composition is a very economic and convenient way of including the three stages,<br>
mentioned in the above method, in one step. With this system, the powder particles are<br>
fluidized in a conical shaped bed by the inlet of hot air, which mixes the ingredients of<br>
the sugar replacer formulation. During this mixing phase, a liquid, e.g. water or water<br>
with a part of the sugar replacer-composition, is sprayed through a bottom or a top spray<br>
nozzle. Through this process, small particles are formed, so called "seeds", which<br>
continue to grow until the desired particle size is reached. During mixing and<br>
agglomeration, drylng .is obtained as well, which is controllable through both the<br><br>
temperature and humidity of the inlet air. An important condition for this process to<br>
succeed, is that the particle size distributions of the powder components that are<br>
fluidized, do not differ too much. This will avoid product segregation. •<br>
Press agglomeration is another method for obtaining a granulated form of<br>
the sugar replacer. A compacting system is used after mixing the components of the<br>
sugar replacer. Due to the perfectly balanced composition of the product, it can be<br>
easily agglomerated by compression of the product through e.g. roller compactors.<br>
With this method, the powder is compressed into a solid form, called "flakes".<br>
Subsequently, these flakes are gently milled to obtain the required particle size density,<br>
Optionally, the product can then be sieved followed by a recycling of the out-of-range<br>
material. Using this method, higher bulk densities can be obtained, which allows the<br>
sugar replacer to be used on both a weight/weight and a volume/volume basis.<br>
The granulation can also be done by spray-drylng. This agglomeration<br>
method is certainly a suitable process for the production of agglomerates from liquid<br>
feedstocks, i.e. solution, emulsion or suspension. For this process, a suspension or a<br>
solution of the complete sugar replacement composition is prepared, after which it is<br>
atomized into a spray of droplets and contacted with hot air.<br>
Each of these processes are suitable for producing an agglomerated sugar<br>
replacer product according to the invention. Moreover, the composition offers the<br>
possibility of incorporating sucrose as a part of the agglomerated product, should this be<br>
desired to obtain an "improved sugar" or a partial sugar replacer. By including sugar in<br>
the agglomerated product, an improved sugar product is created, with functionalities<br>
that go far beyond those of sucrose. However, the product has been designed and is<br>
perfectly suitable to fully replace sugar, on a 1/1 weight basis. Granulation can be<br>
important for obtaining a sugar replacement composition that is also suitable-for a 1/1<br>
volume, replacement of sugar.<br>
The granulated or agglomerated product of the present invention can<br>
furthermore be compressed to form a sugar cube-like product as a replacement for<br>
conventional sugar cubes. In view of the typical uses of sugar cubes, any type of<br>
oligosaccharide component may be employed. Whilst not being harmful, the beneficial<br>
effects on the browning characteristics that can be observed when using ffucto-<br>
oligosaccharide will not be of major importance for a sugar, cube replacer. The same is<br><br>
true when employlng the sugar replacer of the present invention in some alternative<br>
forms of application, including beverages, cream, ice cream, pastry cream, yoghurt,<br>
dairy product based deserts, chocolate, jam, or marmalade.<br>
Further examples of important functional properties of the sugar<br>
replacement composition according to the invention are:<br>
-	a minimum calorie reduction;<br>
-	a minimal caloric value;<br>
-	a low glycemic response;<br>
-	a freezing point depression.<br>
The minimum calorie reduction obtained by substitution of sugar by the<br>
functional sugar replacer should be 60 %, when sugar is replaced for 100 %.<br>
Preferably, the caloric value of the sugar replacement composition should<br>
not exceed 200 kcal/100 g, more specifically 150 kcal/100 g.<br>
Substituting sugar by the formulation as described in e.g. the above third<br>
example, results in a lowering of the blood sugar- levels, as opposed to glucose. The<br>
obtained glycamic response values were determined and certified by Reading Scientific<br>
Services Limited (RSSL), Reading, UK and are illustrated in figure 6. The chart clearly<br>
illustrates the different profile of sugar replacer compared to glucose. Relative to 25 g<br>
glucose, the increase in blood glucose observed following consumption of 25 g of the<br>
product was 27 %± 8.<br>
Interestingly, the sugar replacement composition has a similar freezing point<br>
depression as sucrose when it is dissolved in water. This characteristic is favourable for<br>
the use of the sugar replacement composition in frozen food products such as ice cream<br>
and sorbet. The freezing points of deionised water, deionised water with sugar<br>
replacement composition and deionised water with sugar were determined by<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) in two separate experiments at a cooling rate<br>
of 1 °C/min. Figure 7 and table 18 show the results of these experiments. The freezing<br>
points are compared statistically. No significant difference can be observed by T-test<br>
between the freezing point of sugar replacement composition and sugar in deionised<br>
water. .<br><br><br><br>
