				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a a method of forming a reconstituted leather sheet material trom a nurture of fibres and the reconstituted leather sheet material.<br>
This invention relates to the formation of sheet material from fibres<br>
particularly using a process known as hydroentanglement or spunlacing.<br>
Prior  patent application  PCT/GB  01/02451   describes the  use   of<br>
hydroentanglement (or spuniacing) to produce a high quality reconstituted<br>
leather sheet material from waste leather fibres.<br>
A feature.of the procedure described in the prior application is the<br>
use of specialised screens through which hydroentangiing jets are directed<br>
at  high   pressure,   in   contrast  to   previously   known   procedures   where<br>
entangling   commences  at low pressure until the fibres  are sufficiently<br>
interlocked  to   avoid   disruption   by  the  jets.      Leather  fibres   entangle<br>
particularly readily, and with previously known procedures, they form a<br>
surface layer of entangled fibres that -impedes further entanglement.   This<br>
is   particularly   disadvantageous   with   thick   webs   needed   for   leather<br>
products but by using the aforesaid screens, jets can penetrate deeply at<br>
high pressure to hydroentangle throughout the depth of the web.<br>
The difficulties with disruption and the formation of a surface layer<br>
arise because fibres resulting from the disintegration of waste leather are<br>
far shorter and finer than those normally used for hydroentangiing.   The<br>
screens of the prior patent application provide a means of constraining<br>
such fibres from being washed away by the jets, but even with screens it<br>
is difficult to constrain very short fibres such as are-produced by hammer<br>
milling waste leather.   Also, whatever the length of fibres about half the hydroentangling energy is wasted when using screens due to the solid parts of the screen shielding significant area of the web from the jets. The loss of energy when using screens and the lower output rates from using leather fibres of greater length are inherent with the procedure of the prior application.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of entangling fibres to form sheet material whereby the aforesaid problems arising from use of screens and longer fibres can be avoided or at least minimised.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention therefore there is provided a method of forming a sheet material from a mixture of fibres comprising base fibres and additional synthetic fibres, said synthetic fibres having outer meltable layers, comprising the steps of: forming the fibres into a web,<br>
heating to melt the outer layers of the additional synthetic fibres so as to cause such fibres to fuse together at intersections to form a network withjn the web,<br>
subjecting the web to entanglement to entangle the base fibres whilst constrained by the network.<br>
Preferably, the entanglement is hydroentanglement.   Preferably also the base fibres are leather fibres.<br>
Thus, in accordance with a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of forming a sheet material from a mixture of fibres<br>
comprising   leather   base   fibres   and   additional   synthetic   fibres,   said synthetic fibres having outer meltable layers comprising the steps of: forming the fibres into a web,<br>
heating to melt the outer layers of the synthetic fibres so as to cause such fibres to fuse together at intersections to form a network within the web,<br>
subjecting the web to hydroentanglement to entangle the leather fibres whilst constrained by the network.<br>
The entanglement of the method of the invention is preferably performed using high pressure jets of liquid (particularly water) preferably in multiple passes. Reference is made to the prior application for further details of such features.<br>
In  a  preferred  embodiment, the invention provides a  method  of forming sheet material with a mixture of leather fibres and man made bicomponent fibres, said bicomponent fibres having outer layers with a lower melting point than the inner cores.   The mixture of fibres is formed into a web, which advances through a heating means that melts the outer layers of the bicomponent fibres so they fuse at their intersections, and form a three dimensional network throughout the web.   Fine jets of water at high pressure are then directed onto the web so they penetrate deeply and hydroentangle the leather fibres while these are constrained by the network of bicomponent fibres.<br>
Fused bicomponent supporting networks are known but not in the<br>
context of the present invention.<br>
Such networks are used in conjunction with wood pulp fibres to impart most or all of the finished product strength for applications such as wet wipes and absorbent sanitary products.   The high pressure jets used in hydroentanglement would disrupt the bonding of such network and, where such networks are used with hydroentanglement, the bicomponent fibres    are    fused    after   hydroentanglement,    thereby    avoiding    such disruption.   With the present invention the network is used for a different purpose to that of providing structural reinforcement for the end product, and entanglement is effected after fusing.<br>
A basic requirement of entangling is that fibres must move in order to entangle, and the fused network would be expected to impede the entanglement of the fibres. Surprisingly, it has been found that leather fibres can entangle effectively within such networks even if the apparent restraining effects are enhanced by compressing the webs containing the leather and bicomponent fibres while the surfaces of the bicomponent fibres are still tacky, thereby presenting a significantly denser layer to the hydroentangling jets.<br>
With the arrangement of the invention, the network can take over part or all of the function of the external screens used in the method of the prior patent application.   However, instead of acting on the surface, the network can provide a succession of much lighter screens within the depth of the web.    Each internal screen can have relatively much more<br>
open area than an external screen, but collectively they can provide an effective and improved alternative to the external screen of the prior application. In particular the network of internal screens allows hydroentangling jets to penetrate deeply at pressures that would otherwise disrupt the web.<br>
Apart from replacing the function of the screens, the bicomponent network can also improve the way the leather fibres hydroentangle.   One of the difficulties of hydroentangling   leather fibres  is that even when using screens they consolidate so readily that they impede drainage of water through the web and the resulting flooding .can prevent optimum entanglement.    However,    the    three    dimensional    structure    of    the bicomponent network can even out the rate of consolidation of the web, which together with the deep penetration can assist the drainage of water through the web until full entanglement is achieved.<br>
It   is   believed   that   this   drainage   effect   is   achieved   by   the three-dimensional   network   of bicomponent  fibres  providing   a   resilient restraint to compaction within the body of leather fibres.   It is desirable to ensure that the network does not hold the leather fibres away from each other to the extent that there is insufficient proximity for them to entangle well with  each other since this could result in  a spongy material less desirable for leather products.  This effect can be reduced or prevented by reducing  the  quantity of bicomponent fibres  in  the  mix and/or using bicomponenrs of lower diameter and/or lower elastic modulus.<br>
In normal hydroentangling practice most of the fibres can start off too far apart to entangle effectively, and a first pass through the jets is used  to  bring  the  fibres   close  enough  to  entangle.     In   a     preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fibres are brought into closer proximity   before   entangling    commences   by   compressing   the    web containing the bicomponent network before the fused junctions of the network solidify.    This can more than halve the thickness of the web compared to conventional practice and can effectively eliminate the first hydroentangling stage used in conventional practice.<br>
In the method of the prior application the external screen helped to compress the web at the first stage of entanglement, but this can incur significant loss of hydroentangling energy because of the surface area of the web being shielded from the jets. .However in the present invention the solid  parts  of the internal bicomponent screens  can be  relatively insubstantial    so    there    can    be    substantially    less    shielding     of hydroentangling jets from-the fibres.    This can reduce the number of passes needed by the jets over the web to achieve full entanglement and reduce  the   energy   consumed.     Typical   production   speeds   can   also increase   from   6   m/min      mentioned   in   the   prior   application   to   over 10 m/min in the present invention.<br>
Being relatively fine, the bicomponent network may be less effective than externally applied screens for masking the furrows in the surface caused by the jets.   Accordingly, with the method of the present<br>
invention   external   screens   may   additionally   be   used   (which   may   be generally of the kind described in the prior application) in at least one pass to   eliminate   or  at  least  reduce   or  substantially  prevent formation   of surface   furrows   by  the   hydro-entanglement jets.      In   so   far  as   the bicomponent   network  acts   as  a  series  of internal  screens,  externalfy applied screens can have more open area than the preferred openings described  in  the prior patent application thereby reducing the loss  of energy.    Such external screens still waste some energy, but they can be confined to passes where they are needed to mask jet lines.    Typically this can be the last pass on the finish face, and possibly the first pass so that the jets bite less deeply while the fibres are least entangled.<br>
The prior patent application describes a method for producing long leather fibres to improve performance of the finished product but such fibres   also   pass   more   slowly   through   the   preferred   equipment   for air-laying the webs.    However with the present invention, short leather fibres   can   be   used   without   necessarily   adversely   affecting   product performance because the network can reduce or eliminate some of the defects that arise with short leather fibres.   For example, products made with short leather fibres are more liable to surface cracking, but short bicomponent fibres may still be beneficially used to enhance throughput from web laying equipment, as by fusing the bicomponent fibres to form a network, they act like much longer fibres and thereby more effectively constrain surface cracking.    Short fibres are also more prone to erosion<br>
during hydroentangling, but the network of fused bicomponent fibres can considerably reduce this without interfering with the relatively small movements needed for hydroentanglement.<br>
Unlike other fields of manufacture where short bicomponent fibres are fused at their intersections, the contribution of bicomponent fibres to primary strength can be negligible, and the proportion of such fibres in the total mix can preferably be minimised as they can seriously detract from leather-like handle.    In cases where the performance of products made with short fibres needs to be significantly upgraded this can be achieved by    incorporating    normal,    non-bicomponent   fibres    with    a    reduced proportion of bicomponent fibres.<br>
The proportion of bicomponent fibre needed to provide the purely process benefits of the present invention can be as low as 2% of the total weight of web, and can be many times less than the percentage used in conventional  applications   where  a  bicomponent  network  is   a  primary source of strength.    Apart from unacceptably increasing stiffness  and coarsening the surface feel of the final product, a bicomponent network that    provides   significant    structural    contribution    may    reduce    the attachment of leather fibres to internal reinforcing fabrics by impeding the leather fibres from locking into the interstices of the fabric.<br>
Because of these limitations,  in  a  preferred  embodiment of the<br>
present invention bicomponent fibres are used with weak outer sheaths to<br>
-promote  a  partial  breakdown  of the   network  as the  web  progresses<br>
through   successive   stages   of  hydroentangling.     With   each   pass   the increased   entanglement of the  leather fibres  can   compensate  for the reduction of bonds between bicomponent fibres,  and can result in end products with minimal stiffening from the network.    Such a procedure would   be   a   disadvantage   in   conventional   practice   but,   as   with   the externally applied screens of the prior application, the main purpose of the network is to overcome processing problems peculiar to hydroentangling rather than providing structural strength.<br>
Processing benefits of the bicomponent network also extend to producing the webs themselves, particularly with commercially available equipment normally used for air laying wood pulp fibres.   Such processes can have high rates of production for short fibres like wood pulp, and the bicomponent network can significantly reduce the erosion of short fibres under  hydroentanglement.      This   allows  short   leather  fibres  such   as produced by hammer milling to be hydroentangled much more effectively than by the methods of the prior application.<br>
A further processing advantage of bicomponent networks is that they can provide sufficient strength to the web before hydroentangling to allow webs to be wound onto reels at interim stages of production.   This removes the need to feed webs directly from the air laying equipment to the hydroentangling  line as in the method of the prior application, and allows the webs to be produced at optimum speeds determined by the air laying     equipment     without    compromising    the     operation     of    the<br>
hydroentangling line. Thus, in one embodiment the (or each) web is wound on a reel after formation of the network, and the web is drawn from such reel to be subjected to said entanglement.<br>
Furthermore, where the product requires two webs on either side of a reinforcing fabric, both webs can be formed using one air laying plant. Two reels of webs stabilised with bicomponent networks can then be fed to the hydroentangling line, and can result in a substantial saving of capital cost compared to the method of the prior application where two entire air laying means were required to continuously feed the hydroentangling line. Where a reinforcing fabric is used the base (leather) fibres preferably penetrate this so as to be entangled therewith.<br>
The fibre content needed to provide adequate reel handling strength depends on web thickness, bicomponent content and the strength of the melt-able  sheath  on the  bicomponent  fibres.     However,  generally the percentage of bicomponent fibre needed to impart sufficient in-process strength   for   reel   winding   need   be   no   more   than   the   same   low bicomponent content that can provide effective internal screens in the method of the present invention.   This in-process strength for individual webs is well below the strength after hydroentangling, particularly after hydroentangling webs and reinforcing fabric to form a final product.<br>
As with most fibrous products, fibre length preferably needs to be as long as possible. However, long leather fibres produced by textile reclaiming methods have a wide distribution of fibre length from around<br>
1mm to occasionally over 15mm, and the upper end of the distribution can cause very slow production rates using air laying equipment designed for wood pulp fibres.   It can therefore be preferable to limit the maximum length  of such fibres to around  6  mm, for example  by passing them through    a   conventional   granulating   machine   (taking   care   to   avoid shortening more than necessary to make a worthwhile improvement in air laying   output).       Such   methods   of   shortening   fibres   can   be   very approximate, but preferably at least 90% of the fibres should be less than 6mm for efficient air laying.    Thus, in the method of the invention, in order to obtain improved throughput from air-laying equipment designed for wood pulp fibres, at least 90% of the base fibres have a maximum fibre length of 6mm.<br>
In the case of hammer milled leather fibres there is also a wide distribution  of fibre lengths,  but lengths are generally much  less than produced by textile reclaiming .methods.    Typically the maximum length may be around 3 mm and, as with fibres produced by textile reclaiming methods, the average fibre length is significantly less than the maximum. No granulation is required for hammer milled fibres, but the much shorter length  can  result in  a need to  increase average length of the mix by adding   manmade. fibres  of predetermined  optimum  length  in  order to improve the physical properties of the final product.<br>
Unlike leather fibres, manmade fibres can be chopped to a constant length so they can all be of a length that provides the optimum balance<br>
between air laying throughput and performance of the finished product. For air laying equipment designed for wood pulp, the length of manmade inclusions may be around 6 mm, but recent improvements in air laying technique may make it feasible to increase this to over 10 mm. These indicative fibre lengths apply typically to bicomponent and non-bicomponent manmade fibres in the 1.7 dtex to 3.0 range. Finer fibres can significantly reduce air laying output unless fibre length is reduced appropriately.<br>
Air laying speeds vary considerably depending not only on fibre length and diameter, but also on the smoothness and shape of fibres.   In these respects  leather fibres are particularly unfavourable regarding  air laying throughput,  as they are usually curly and have finely fibrillated branches that can impede flow through the perforated distribution screens of air laying equipment.   Air laying rate for un-granulated   leather fibres produced by textile reclaiming methods can be as low as 3 m/min for a 200gsm   web,   but this   can   be   more   than   doubled   if the  fibres   are shortened.   Laying rates for manmade and pulp fibres can be considerably faster.<br>
Regarding the percentage  of bicomponent fibre in the mix,   it is generally preferable to keep this to the minimum as described earlier.   The degree   to   which   the   bicomponent   network   compromises   leather-like handle  depends  on  end  use,  and  for  shoes  the greater stiffness  and wearing properties conferred by the bicomponent network can be more<br>
acceptable or even be of benefit compared to (for example) clothing leather. For shoes up to 10% of 3.0 dtex bicomponent can be used, but to obtain better handle it can be preferable to use under 5% bicomponent and a greater proportion of non-bicomponent fibres. In general the overall range for additional synthetic fibres is 2% to 10% by weight with a preference towards the lower end of the range.<br>
From the viewpoint of providing effective internal screens, the number of bicomponent fibres can be as significant as their percentage by weight of total mix. For example, reducing from 3.0 to 1.7 dtex in a 5% mix would proportionately increase the number of fibres in the mix, and to obtain a similar screen effect, the percentage of 1.7 dtex fibres may need to reduce to below 3%. Using finer bicomponent fibres can also provide better surface feel to the finished product, which is an.added benefit.<br>
Commercially available bicomponent fibres are generally not less than  1.7 dtex, but end  product handle can be improved by choosing bicomponents with a low elastic modulus, such as polypropylene.   These usually   have 'polyethylene   melt-able  sheaths  that  are   not  particularly strong but can still provide sufficient reel handling strength even at low percentage   additions.      As   mentioned   earlier   some   degree   of   bond weakness can be an advantage for some product applications as this can improve the  handle of the final product.     In  applications where more stiffness is acceptable or required, stronger bicomponents can be used, such as polyester with nylon sheaths.<br>
Bonding between bicomponent fibres at their intersections can be achieved by passing hot air through the web to melt the outer coating while the fibres are held between porous belts. The bond may not be strong enough to link short fibres together to contribute significantly to the tensile strength of the final product, but the bonds may be sufficient to provide an effective network for hydroentangling and enough anchorage to resist surface cracking of the finished product.<br>
The fused intersections of the network may be at least partially disrupted by the entanglement.<br>
Resistance   to   surface   cracking   can   be   enhanced   by   including ordinary non-bicomponent manmade fibres in the mix.    Such fibres can also significantly improve peel resistance of the surface coating that is usually applied to the finished product.   Furthermore, being free to move, non-bonded synthetic fibres can be more readily driven by jets into the interstices of the reinforcing fabric and thereby  improve peel strength between   the   webs   and   the   reinforcing   fabric.      This   is   particularly important for hard wearing shoes, and relatively high percentages of such fibres (compared to bicomponent) can be used without over-stiffening the final product.<br>
In the case of a fabric reinforcing material having one or more webs or bodies of fibres united with the fabric, the (or each) web or body may contain a higher proportion of said further synthetic material adjacent the reinforcing layer than at the outer surface thereof.<br>
The   effect  on   handle   of  such   further   (non-bicomponent)   fibres depends on their fineness as well as their percentage of mix, and in this respect they should preferably be not more than 1.7 dtex.   For minimum effect on handle, such fibres can be into the "microfibre" range of well under   1.0 dtex,   and  with  sufficiently  fine  manmade   fibres,   adequate handle can be maintained at over 10% of total fibre content.    However reducing fineness increases the number of fibres present, which in itself can change the feel of the product.   Alternatively where improved peel resistance  is  more  important than  handle,  coarser fibres  can   produce better all round results.    Generally, for reasons of cost and detracting from the leather-like feel  of the  final product it is preferable to  keep further synthetic fibre content to  below  20%   by weight of the  end product sheet material.  The range may be 5-20% by weight.<br>
Particularly with coarser manmade fibres, even small percentages in the mix can detract from the characteristic surface feel of real leather, particularly as after buffing the superior abrasion resistance of manmade fibres   can   make them  more  prominent.     In  a  further feature  of the invention, hot air or other suitable heat sources are applied to the surface of the   web   after  buffing   at  sufficient temperature to  melt  back  the bicomponent fibres without adversely affecting the leather fibres.    The technique exploits the high moisture retention of leather which keeps it cool, and its property of charring rather than melting when subjected to excess local heat.    Any such charring can be brushed or lightly buffed<br>
away, leaving a substantially natural leather finish.<br>
The invention will now be described further by way of example<br>
only and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1	is a schematic view of initial stages of one form of apparatus<br>
used in the performance of the method of the invention and which shows the main operating principles of a commercially available   plant   for   making   a   fibre   web   with   a   fused bicomponent network; and Figure 2        shows further stages of the apparatus for combining such web with reinforcing fabric and hydroentangling the resulting sandwich. Referring   to   Figure   1,   waste   leather   fibres   made   by   textile reclaiming    methods    lightly    chopped    to    a    maximum    length    of approximately 6 mm are mixed with 4% of 1.7 dtex bicomponent fibres and 5% of 3.0 dtex standard polyester fibres both cut to constant 6 mm length.    The mixture is evenly distributed at around 200 g/m2 onto a driven porous belt 1 by at least one pair of perforated drums 2 while the fibres are drawn onto the porous belt by vacuum box 3.<br>
The resulting web 4 of evenly laid fibres is transferred by a conventional vacuum conveyor 5 to porous belts 6 and 7, which contain and partially compress the web while hot air from a box 8 is blown through belts 7 and 6 and web 4, and received by a suction box 9. The temperature of the hot air is sufficient to melt the outer sheath of the<br>
bicomponent fibres (but not the inner core) and thereby fuse the fibres together at their intersections.<br>
Before the melted sheaths at the intersections of the bicomponent fibres solidify, the web may be compressed by nip rollers 10 to form a denser web consisting of un-bonded leather and polyester fibres supported by a three-dimensional network of fused bicomponent fibres. On solidification of the intersections the network provides sufficient strength for the web to be wound onto reel 11 for transport and/or storage.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, two such webs 4a and 4b unwind from reels 11a and- 11b together with fabric reinforcement 4c from reel 12, and are brought together by rollers 13 to feed onto a porous belt 14.   Webs 4a, 4b and fabric 4c comprising a composite web 15 are conveyed by belt 14 through   hydroentangling  jets   16,   and   water  from  the jets   is   drawn through   web   15  and   porous   belt   14 by  vacuum   box   17.      Water rebounding from the surface of the composite web is collected in trays 18 and conveyed away as described more fully in the prior application.<br>
For  complete  hydroentanglement the  composite   web   is   passed through a plurality of successive hydroentanglement stages, one or more of which may incorporate a screen applied over the surface of the web 15.. Hydroentanglement stages are arranged so that jets can be applied to both surfaces, of the web, and for the present example, such application of jets   is   on   alternate  sides  through   5  such  stages   at a   speed  of<br>
1 0 m/min.<br>
In this example perforated screens with an open area of approximately 60% made from chemically etched stainless steel of the type described in the prior application are applied to each side of the web for the final stage of hydroentangling in order to mask the furrow marks from the jets. To prevent coincidence lines forming on the surface, the pitch of the apertures of the screen is made the same as the pitch of the jet orifices.<br>
Jet orifices for this example are 140 microns at 0.9 mm centres, and when applied through the screens, jet pressures can be at the maximum normally available in commercial hydroentangling equipment at 200 bar. Pressures without the screen may be reduced slightly to 180 bar, and unlike similar webs without a bicomponent network, this same high pressure can be applied at the first stage of hydroentangling without the need for an external screen.<br>
The resulting hydroentangled web may be finished by impregnating with emulsified oils, pigments and pigment fixatives as may be applied to natural leather, followed by drying and buffing both sides. The side that received three hydroentangling stages (and therefore has a higher degree of entanglement and attachment to the reinforcing fabric) can then be coated with a leather-like finish "by conventional means as used for coating synthetic leather.<br>
The foregoing procedures maybe suitable for shoe material, but for<br>
This may not be wholly satisfactory when the next step is to wet the webs again for hydroentangling, while the disadvantages of carding include slow rates of production and wastage from the ejection of fine fibres.<br>
A wide variety of variations are feasible within the scope of this invention. Jet orifice size, screen details, production speeds and other details provided in the prior application can broadly apply to the present invention.     The  main  departure is the  reduced   application  of surface screens, and to ensure good attachment to the reinforcing core, it is often desirable to hydroentangle on alternate sides of the fabric so that fibres are pushed evenly into the interstices of the fabric.    Also, due to the stabilising effect of the bicomponent network, pressures can be higher and leather fibres shorter than in the method of the prior application.<br>
Product compositions can vary widely and thickness of the web between the final coated surface and the internal reinforcing layer can differ substantially from the web forming the back layer.    For example, instead of the equal webs implied in the previously described example, the front one may be 150 g/m2 and contain 15% non-bicomponent synthetic fibres   and   the   back   may   be   250   g/m2   and   contain   0%   of   non-bicomponent fibre.    The bicomponent content for both webs, however/ may be constant at 4%.<br>
Fibre   lengths   can    be   determined    largely   by   the   production limitations of commercial web laying equipment and, where alternative<br>
web laying equipment (such as carding) can handle-long manmade fibres, it may not be necessary to incorporate fabric reinforcement. Also, where jet markings are acceptable in the finished product, there may be no need for surface applied screens. Alternatively, screens may be used extensively to supplement the. interna! screens ' of the bicomponent network, particularly if the latter are very light and the leather fibres are particularly short.<br>
Hydroentangling speeds can  vary widely depending  on  a  whole range of parameters, including weight per unit area  of material being hydroentangled,   open   area   of fabric  reinforcement,   jet  pressures,  jet diameter, jet spacing,  number of  passes through the jets,   weight  of bicomponent  network, type  of leather fibre,  number  of passes  using external screens, and open area of screens.   Generally lighter webs can be hydroentangled at faster speeds, and typically 600 g/m2 material may require 6 m/minute while 200 g/m2  may entangle fully at 15 m/min.<br>
The choice of using relatively long waste leather fibres made by textile   reclaiming   methods   or  short  ones   made  by   milling   (such   as conventional   hammer   or  disk   milling)   can   depend   on   the   cost   and availability of the different types of waste leather.   Milling is cheaper and can use waste leather shavings, which are usually cheaper than the sheet waste used in textile reclaiming plant.   However end product quality can be lower and more costly manmade fibre additions may be needed to achieve acceptable performance.   Blends of both types of waste fibre can<br>
also be used for intermediate quality products.<br>
As   with  the  prior application,  the  main   limitation  in  weight  of composite    webs    that    can    be   hydroentangied    is    the    onset    of hydroentanglement itself as this reduces permeability to the jets    and constricts  further entanglement.    Such constriction is far greater with leather   fibres   than   conventional   synthetic   fibres   but,   by   using   the methods of this invention, it is possible to rnake acceptable product at relatively high composite web weights of around 600 g/m2.   Producing acceptable quality end product at much above this weight is possible but becomes increasingly difficult.   Lighter webs are easier to hydroentangle, and minimum web weights can be set more by limits of web forming accuracy   and   limited   market   demand   for   exceptionally   thin   leather products.<br>
The  inter-relationships  between  all the foregoing parameters  are complex and can vary considerably for different types of end product.   An optimum   balance   between   output   rate,   cost   and   finished   product performance can be established by conducting.empirical trials within the broad guidance provided in this patent application.    The bicomponent network   and    associated   features    of   the   present   invention    assist considerably in improving production rate and product quality at lower cost compared to the methods of the prior application.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
