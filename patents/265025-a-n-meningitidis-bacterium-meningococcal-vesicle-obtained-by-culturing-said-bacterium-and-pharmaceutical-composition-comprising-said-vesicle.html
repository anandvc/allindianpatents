IMMUNOGENIC BACTERIAL VESICLES WITH OUTER MEMBRANE PROTEINS<br>
All documents cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention is in the field of vesicle preparation for immunisation purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
One of the various approaches to immunising against N.meningitidis infection is to use outer<br>
membrane vesicles (OMVs). An efficacious OMV vaccine against serogroup B has been produced<br>
by the Norwegian National Institute of Public Health [e.g. ref 1] but, although this vaccine is safe<br>
and prevents MenB disease, its efficacy is limited to the homologous strain used to make the vaccine.<br>
The 'RIVM' vaccine is based on OMVs containing six different PorA subtypes. It has been shown to<br>
be immunogenic in children in phase H clinical trials [2].<br>
Reference 3 discloses a vaccine against different pathogenic serotypes of serogroup B<br>
meningococcus based on OMVs which retain a protein complex of 65-kDa. Reference 4 discloses a<br>
vaccine comprising OMVs from genetically-engineered meningococcal strains, with the OMVs<br>
comprising: at least one Class 1 outer-membrane protein (OMP) but not comprising a Class 2/3<br>
OMP. Reference 5 discloses OMVs comprising OMPs which have mutations in their surface loops<br>
and OMVs comprising derivatives of meningococcal lipopolysaccharide (LPS).<br>
As well as serogroup B N.meningitidis, vesicles have been prepared for other bacteria. Reference 6<br>
discloses a process for preparing OMV-based vaccines for serogroup A meningococcus. References<br>
7 and 8 disclose vesicles from N.gonorrh.oeae. Reference 9 discloses vesicle preparations from<br>
N.lactamica. Vesicles have also been prepared from Moraxella catarrhalis [10,11], Shigellaflexneri<br>
[12,13], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12,13], Porphyromonas gingivalis [14], Treponema pallidum<br>
[15], Haemophilus influenzae [16 &amp; 21] and Helicobacterpylori [17].<br>
The failure of OMVs to elicit cross-protection against, non-homologous strains is not well<br>
understood, particularly as most N.meningitidis isolates share a small number of conserved protective<br>
surface antigens that, if present in OMVs, would be expected to provide broad protective coverage.<br>
One possible explanation for the failure is the existence of variable immune-dominant surface<br>
antigens that prevent the conserved antigens from exerting their protective action, and the presence<br>
of immune-dominant hyper-variable proteins such as PorA has been extensively documented and<br>
demonstrated. Other possible explanations are that the methods for OMV preparation result in<br>
contamination with cytoplasmic and/or inner membrane proteins that dilute the protective outer<br>
membrane proteins, or that antigens are lost by the detergent extraction.<br>
There have been various proposals to improve OMV efficacy. Reference 18 discloses compositions<br>
comprising OMVs supplemented with transferrin binding proteins (e.g. TbpA and TbpB) and/or<br>
Cu,zn-superoxide dismutase. Reference 19 discloses compositions comprising OMVs supplemented<br>
by various proteins. Reference 20 discloses preparations of membrane vesicles obtained from<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
N.meningitidis with a modified fur gene. Reference 21 teaches that nspA expression should be<br>
up-regulated with concomitant porA and cps knockout Further knockout mutants of N.meningitidis<br>
for OMV production are disclosed in references 21 to 23. In contrast to these attempts to improve<br>
OMVs by changing expression patterns, reference 24 focuses on changing the methods for OMV<br>
preparation, and teaches that antigens such as NspA can be retained during vesicle extraction by<br>
avoiding the use of detergents such as deoxycholate.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide further and improved vesicle preparations, together with<br>
processes for their manufacture. In particular, it is an object of the invention to provide vesicles<br>
which retain important bacterial immunogenic components from N.meningitidis.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on the surprising discovery that disruption of the pathways involved in<br>
degradation of peptidoglycan (the murein layer) gives bacteria that release vesicles into then- culture<br>
medium, and that these vesicles are rich in immunogenic outer membrane proteins and can elicit<br>
broad-ranging bactericidal immune responses. The vesicles are different from the OMVs that can be<br>
prepared by disrupting whole bacteria (e.g. by sonication and sarkosyl extraction [25]), and can be<br>
prepared without even disrupting bacterial cells e.g. simply by separating the vesicles from the â€¢<br>
bacteria by a process such as centrifugation.<br>
In particular, the inventors have found that knockout of the meningococcal mltA homolog (also<br>
referred ro as 'GNA33' or 'NMB0033' [26]) leads to the spontaneous release of vesicles that are rich'-,<br>
in immunogenic outer membrane proteins and that can elicit broadly cross-protective antibody<br>
responses with higher bactericidal titres than OMVs prepared by normal production processes. This<br>
enhanced efficacy is surprising for two reasons: first, the NMB0033 protein has previously been<br>
reported to be highly effective in raising bactericidal antibodies (e.g. see table 1 of ref. 196) and to be<br>
a strong vaccine candidate (e.g. see table 2 of ref. 27), with a recommendation in reference 28 that it<br>
should be upregulated for vesicle production, so its loss would a priori be expected to reduce<br>
bactericidal efficacy rather than to increase it; second, the knockout strains do not have the correct<br>
topological organisation of the cellular membrane, and the main constituent proteins of normal<br>
OMVs (e.g. the PorA, PBS, class 4 and class 5 outer membrane proteins) had previously been<br>
reported to be released into culture medium [25], The inventors have now found that the previously-<br>
reported release does not involve secretion of discrete proteins, but that instead the outer membrane<br>
proteins are released in the form of vesicles. These vesicles are advantageous over OMVs prepared<br>
by prior art means because they are released spontaneously into the culture medium and can thus be<br>
prepared simply and efficiently without the complicated and time-consuming disruption and<br>
purification methods that are normally used for preparing OMVs.<br>

Thus the invention provides a bacterium having a knockout mutation of its mltA gene. The bacterium<br>
preferably also has a knockout mutation of at least one further gene e.g. iheporA and/orporB and or<br>

The invention also provides a bacterium, wherein: (i) the bacterium has a cell wall that includes<br>

The invention also provides a meningococcal vesicle, -which includes one or more (i.e. 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6,<br>

The invention also provides a process for preparing bacterial vesicles, comprising the steps of: (i)<br>
culturing a MltA bacterium in a culture medium such that the bacterium releases vesicles into said<br>
 medium; and (ii) collecting the vesicles from said medium. The MltA bacterium is preferably a<br>
? MltA knockout mutant The vesicles can be collected by size separation (e.g. filtration, using a<br>
filter which allows the vesicles to pass through but which does not allow intact bacteria to pass<br>
through), which can conveniently be performed after centrifugation to preferentially pellet cells<br>
relative to the smaller vesicles (e.g. low speed centrifugation).<br>
Peptidoglycan metabolism<br>
Peptidoglycan (also known as murein, mucopeptide or glycosaminopeptide) is a heteropolymer<br>
found in the cell wall of most bacteria. Peptidoglycan is the component that is primarily responsible<br>
for the mechanical strength of the bacterial cell wall and for maintaining cellular shape. In<br>
Gram-positive bacteria it is the major component of the cell wall. In Gram-negative bacteria it occurs<br>
as a layer between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes, and is covalently linked to the outer<br>
membrane via the Braun lipoprotein.<br>
Peptidoglycan consists mainly of linear heteropolysaccbaride backbone chains that are cross-linked<br>
by 'stem' peptides to form a lattice structure. It is a polymer so large that it can be thought of as a<br>
single immense covalently linked molecule. In E. coli the saccharide backbone is formed from<br>
alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residues. A<br>
MurNAc residue may be linked to a stem tetrapeptide. Cross-links between backbone chains are<br>
usually formed direcily between D-alanine in one stem peptide and a meso DAP of another. The<br>
E.coli structure is typical for Gram-negative bacteria, but there is more variation within Gram-<br>
positive bacteria e.g. in S.aureus 30-50% of the muramic acid residues are not acetylated, the stem<br>
peptide often has L-lysine in place of meso-DAP and isoglutamine in place of D-glutamate, and<br>
cross-links can occur between stem peptides.<br>
-4-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
The initial step in E.coli peptidoglycan biosynthesis is the formation of the UDP derivative of<br>
GlcNAc, which occurs in the cytoplasm. Some UDP-GlcNAc is converted to UDP-MurNAc in a<br>
reaction of UDP-GlcNAc ' and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP),  catalysed by PEP:UDP-GlcNAc<br>
enolpyruvyl transferase. Still within the cytoplasm, amino acids are added sequentially to<br>
UDP-MurNAc to form a UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide known as the 'Park nucleotide' that includes a<br>
terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine. The Park nucleotide is then transferred to bactoprenol monophosphate<br>
in the cytoplasmic membrane, where UDP-GlcNAC is also added to make a bactoprenol-<br>
disaccharide-pentapeptide subunit The disaccharide-pentapeptide subunit is then transferred into the<br>
periplasmic region, with bactoprenol-pyrophosphate remaining in the membrane. Within the<br>
periplasm the transferred subunit is inserted into a growing peptidoglycan.<br>
To allow ceil division, changes in shape, and import/export of large complexes (e.g. during<br>
conjugation) then peptidoglycan degradation must occur. In E.coli this degradation is caused by<br>
enzymes referred to as murein hydrolases [29], which as a family includes lytic transglycosylases<br>
{mltA, mltB, mltC, mltD, slt70, emtA), endopeptidases (pbp4, pbp7, mepA) and amidases (amiC).<br>
Muraonidases such as lysozyme cleave the same B-(l-4)-glycosidic linkages between MurNAc and<br>
GlcNAc residues; unlike muramidases, however, the transglycosylases cleave the glycosidic bond<br>
with concomitant formation of 1,6-anhydromuramoyl residues (AnhMurNAc).<br>
The standard peptidoglycan anabolic and catabolic pathways are thus well-characterised, as are the<br>
minor variations and modifications that occur between bacteria. The enzymes are well-characterised,<br>
and proteins have been readily annotated as being involved in the pathways when newi bacterial<br>
genomic sequences have been published. The skilled person can thus easily determine the-enzymes<br>
involved in the peptidoglycan metabolic pathways for any given bacterium, can easily identify the<br>
enzymes involved, and can easily identify the genes encoding those enzymes.<br>
The invention is based on the knockout of the mltA gene, which encodes a membrane-bound lytic<br>
transglycosylase. The MltA family is recognised in INTERPRO (entry 'ipr005300') and PFAM<br>
(entry 'MltA' or 'PF03562'), and the PFAM record lists MltA proteins in bacteria as diverse as<br>
Rhizobiwn loti, Bradyrhizobium j'aponicum, Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis, Rhizobium meliloti,<br>

Preferred bacteria for MtA knockout are in the Naisseria genus, vnihN.memngitidis being the most<br>
preferred 'bacterium. The MltA gene in serogroup B N.meningitidis has been referred to in the<br>
literature as 'GNA33' [25,26,196],' and an example sequence has GenBank accession number<br>
'AF226391.1\ The MltA gene in serogroup A (cNMA0279') has GenBank accession number<br>
NP_283118.1. Aligned polymorphic forms of meningococcal MltA can be seen in figures 7 and 18<br>
of reference 30. Two full genome sequences of N.meningitidis are available [31,32]. For any given<br>
strain of N.meningitidis, therefore, the skilled person will be able to identify the mltA gene. For<br>
meningococcus, the knocked-out mltA gene is preferably the gene which, in the wild-type strain, has<br>
the highest sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 1 herein. MltA is a lipoprotein in meningococcus [26].<br>
Knockout of mltA can result in reduced virulence, abnormal cell separation, abnormal cell<br>
morphology, undivided septa, double septa, cell clustering and sharing of outer membranes [25]. At<br>
the same time, however, the knockout mutation has surprisingly been found to give bacteria that can<br>
spontaneously produce vesicles that are immunogenic and enriched in outer membrane proteins.<br>
Bacteria<br>
The bacterium from which vesicles are prepared may be Gram-positive, but it is preferably Gram-<br>
negative. The bacterium may be from genus Moraxella, Shigella, Pseudomonas, Treponema,<br>
Porphyromonas or Helicobacter (see above for preferred species) but is preferably from the<br>
Neisseria genus. Preferred Neisseria species are N.meningitidis and N.gonorrhoeae.<br>
Within N.meningitidis, any of serogroups A, C, W135 and Y may be used, but it is preferred to   <br>
prepare vesicles from serogroup B. Where relevant, the meningococcus can be of any serotype (e.g.  <br>
1, 2a, 2b, 4, 14, 15, 16, etc.), of any serosubtype (P1.2; P1.4; P1.5; Pl.5,2; Pl.7,16; P1.7,16b; P1.9; <br>
Pl.9,15; Pl.12,13; PI.13; P1.14; P1.15; PI.21,16; Pl.22,14; etc.) and of any immunotype (e.g. LI;<br>
L3,3,7;  L10;   etc.),  and preferred bacteria  include:  B:4:P1.4;  B:4:P1.15;  B:15:P1.7,16.  The<br>
meningococcus may be from any suitable lineage, including hyperinvasive and hypervirulent<br>
lineages e.g. any of the following seven hypervirulent lineages: subgroup I; subgroup III; subgroup<br>
IV-i; ET-5 complex; ET-37 complex; A4 cluster; lineage 3. These lineages have been defined by<br>
multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), but multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has also been<br>
used to classify meningococci [ref. 33] e.g. the ET-37 complex is the ST-11 complex by MLST, the<br>
ET-5 complex is ST-32 (ET-5), lineage 3 is ST-41/44, etc.<br>
Preferred strains within serogroup B are MC58, 2996, H4476 and 394/98. In some embodiments of<br>
the invention, however, the meningococcus is not strain MC58 and is not strain BZ232.<br>
As well as having a knockout of mltA, the bacterium may have one or more knockout mutations of<br>
other gene(s). To reduce pyrogenic activity, for instance, the bacterium should have low endotoxin<br>
(LOS/LPS) levels, and this can be achieved by knockout of enzymes involved in LPS biosynthesis.<br>
Suitable mutant bacteria are already known e.g. mutant Neisseria [34,35] and mutant Helicobacter<br>

membranes from Gram-negative bacteria are disclosed in reference 37.<br>
In N.meningitidis, a preferred further knockout is the PorA class I outer membrane protein.<br>
Advantageously, such knockouts will not display the immunodominant hypervariable strain-specific<br>
PorA protein, thereby focusing a recipient's immune response on other antigens. In a specific aspect,<br>
the invention provides a N.meningitidis bacterium, comprising both a knockout mutation of MltA<br>
and a knockout mutation of PorA. The bacterium can also carry further knockout mutations e.g. in<br>
LOS/LPS synthetic pathways {e.g. IpxA), immunodominant variable proteins, PorB, OpA, OpC, etc.<br>
As well as having knockouts of particular endogenous genes, the bacterium may express one or more<br>
genes that are not endogenous. For example, the invention may use a recombinant strain that<br>
expresses new genes relative to the corresponding wild-type strain. Although it is preferred to<br>
knockout PorA expression, in an alternative approach it is possible to engineer a rneningococcus to<br>
express multiple PorA subtypes {e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 of PorA subtypes: PI.7,16; PI.5,2; PI. 19,15;<br>
P1.5c,10; Pl.12,13; and P1.7h,4 [e.g. refs. 38, 39]). Expression of non-endogenous genes in this way<br>
can be achieved by various techniques e.g. chromosomal insertion (as used for introducing multiple<br>
PorA genes [40]), knockin mutations, expression from extra-chromosomal vectors {e.g. from<br>
plasmids); etc.<br>
As well as down-regulating expression of specific proteins, the bacterium may over-express (relative *<br>
to the corresponding wild-type strain) immunogens such as NspA, protein 287 [19], protein 741 [41], <br>
TbpA [18], TbpB [18], superoxide dismutase [18], etc.<br>
The bacterium may also include one or more of the knockout and/or over-expression mutations<br>
disclosed in reference 16, 21-24 and/or 42-43. Preferred genes for down-regulation and/or knockout<br>
include: (a) Cps, CtrA, CtrB, CtrC, CtrD, FrpB, GalE, HtrB/MsbB, LbpA, LbpB, LpxK, Opa, Ope,<br>
PilC, PorA, PorB, SiaA, SiaB, SiaC, SiaD, TbpA, and/or TbpB [16]; (b) CtrA, CtrB, CtrC, CtrD,<br>
FrpB, GalE, HtrB/MsbB, LbpA, LbpB, LpxK, Opa, Ope, PhoP, PilC, PmrE, PmrF, PorA. SiaA,<br>
SiaB, SiaC, SiaD, TbpA, and/or TbpB [21]; (c) ExbB, ExbD, rrnpM, CtrA, CtrB, CtrD, GalE, LbpA,<br>
LpbB, Opa, Ope, PilC, PorA, PorB, SiaA, SiaB, SiaC, SiaD, TbpA, and/or TbpB [42]; and (d) CtrA,<br>
CtrB, CtrD, FrpB, OpA, OpC, PilC, PorA, PorB, SiaD, SynA, SynB, and/or SynC [43].<br>
For meningococcai compositions, the selection criteria of reference 44 may be used.<br>
Preferred vesicles are prepared from menirtgococci having one of the following subtypes: PI .2;<br>
Pl.2,5; P1.4; P1.5; Pl.5,2; P1.5,c; P1.5c,10; Pl.7,16; P1.7,16b; P1.7h,4; P1.9; PI.15; Pl.9,15;<br>
Pl.12,13; PI.13; PI.14; Pl.21,16; Pl.22,14. The meningococcus is preferably in serogroup B.<br>
Vesicles may also be prepared from the Escherichia genus, such as from the E.coli species. E.coli<br>
strains have traditionally been classified as either commensal or pathogenic, and pathogenic strains<br>
are then sub-classified as intestinal or extraintestinal strains. Classification may also be based on the<br>
-7-V<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
'K' antigens. The best-studied 'K' antigen is 'K' which is considered to be the major determinant<br>
of virulence among those strains of E.coli that cause neonatal meningitis. Vesicles of the invention<br>
can be prepared from any of these E.coli strains, but are preferably from a pathogenic strain,<br>
including an extraintestinal pathogenic ('ExPEC [45]) strain, a uropathogenic (UPEC) strain or a<br>
meningitis/sepsis-associated (MNEC) strains. Genome sequences of pathogenic strains are available<br>
in the databases tinder accession numbers AE005174, BA000007 and NC-004431. Rather than use a<br>
mltA knockout, it may be preferred to knockout one or more of the components of the E.coli Tol-Pal<br>
complex [46], such as tolA, tolQ, tolB, pal and/or tolR. Knockout of tolR is preferred. The<br>
meningococci do not have a homolog of the Tol-Pal system.<br>
Vesicle compositions<br>
The invention provides the vesicles that arc spontaneously released into culture medium by bacteria<br>
of the invention. These vesicles are distinct from the vesicles that can be prepared artificially from<br>
the same bacteria, such as the sarkosyl-extracted OMVs prepared in reference 25 from '7GNA33'<br>
meningococci. They are also distinct from microvesicles (MVs [47]) and 'native OMVs' ('NOMVs'<br>
[64]), although vesicles of the invention seem to be more similar to MVs and NOMVs than to<br>
sarkosyl-extracted OMVs. The vesicles are also distinct from blebs, which are outer-membrane<br>
protrusions that remain attached to bacteria prior to release as MVs [48,49].<br>
The vesicles of the invention have a diameter of 50-100nm by electron microscopy, which is smaller<br>
than that of artificial meningococcai OMVs (diameter ~270nm [50]). The diameter is roughly the<br>
same as that of artificial OMVs that have been heat-denatured (~105nm [50]), but the vesicles of the<br>
invention retain antigenicity whereas heat-denatured  artificial  OMVs lose their antigenicity.<br>
Moreover, vesicles of the invention (unlike MVs, OMVs and NOMVs) are substantially free from<br>
cytoplasmic contamination.<br>
Vesicles of the invention preferably contain no more than 20% by weight of LOS/LPS, measured<br>
relative to the total protein (i.e. there should be at least 4x more protein than LOS/LPS, by weight).<br>
The maximum LOS/LPS level is preferably even lower than 20% e.g. 15%, 10%, 5% or lower.<br>
Unlike the starting culture, the vesicle-containing compositions of the invention will generally be<br>
substantially free from whole bacteria, whether living or dead The size of the vesicles of the<br>
invention means that they can readily be separated from whole bacteria by filtration through a<br>
0.22um filter e.g. as typically used for filter sterilisation. Thus the invention provides a process for<br>
preparing vesicles of the invention, comprising filtering the culture medium, from bacteria of the<br>
invention through a filter that retards whole bacteria but that lets the vesicles pass through e.g. a<br>
0.22um filter. Although vesicles will pass through a standard 0.22um filters, these can rapidly<br>
become clogged by other material, and so it is preferred to perform sequential steps of filter<br>
sterilisation through a series of filters of decreasing pore size, finishing with a standard sterilisation<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
filter (e.g. a Q.22Î¼m filter). Examples of preceding filters would be those with pore size of 0.8Î¼m,<br>
0.45Î¼m, etc The filtrate can be farther treated e.g. by ultracehtrifugation.<br>
Vesicles of the invention contain Iipids and proteins. The protein content of meningococcal vesicles<br>
has been analysed, and substantially all of the proteins in the vesicles are classified as outer<br>
membrane proteins by bioinformatic analysis. Outer membrane proteins seen in the vesicles include:<br>
PilE; IgA-specific serine endopeptidase; PorA; FrpB; P1B; etc. Unlike artificial OMVs, which have<br>
previously been analysed proteomically [51], the vesicles of the invention were found to lack<br>
proteins such as MinD, FtsA and phosphoenolpyruvate synthase. The vesicles also lack MtA.<br>
The vesicles of the invention are advantageous when compared to vesicles prepared by disruption of<br>
cultured bacteria because no artificial disruption is required. Simple size-based separation can be<br>
used to separate bacteria and vesicles, without any need for chemical treatments, etc. As well as<br>
being a simpler process, this avoids the risk of denaturation caused by the detergents etc. that are<br>
used during prior art OMV preparative processes.<br>
As mentioned above, vesicles of the invention may be similar to microvesicles (MVs) and 'native<br>
OMVs' ('NOMVs'), which are naturally-occurring membrane vesicles that form spontaneously<br>
during bacterial growth and are released into culture medium. MVs can be obtained by culturing<br>
Neisseria in broth culture medium, separating whole cells from the broth culture medium (e.g. by<br>
filtration or by low-speed centrifugation to pellet only the cells and not the smaller vesicles) and then<br>
collecting the MVs that are present in the cell-depleted medium {e.g. by filtration, by differential<br>
 precipitation or aggregation of MVs, by high-speed centrifugationto pellet the MVs). Strains for use<br>
in production of MVs can generally be selected on the basis of the amount of MVs produced in<br>
culture. References 52 and 53 describe Neisseria with high MV production.<br>
Vesicle combinations<br>
The invention allows the production of irnmunogenic vesicles from a bacterium of choice. The<br>
bacterium will typically have been generated by mutation of a chosen starting strain. "Where there are<br>
multiple starring strains of interest then the invention provides methods for preparing vesicles from<br>
each of the strains, and the different vesicles can be combined. This combination strategy is<br>
particularly .useful for bacteria where strain-to-strain variation means that a single strain usually does<br>
not offer clinically-useful protection e.g. serogroup B meningococcus.<br>
Thus the invention provides a composition comprising a mixture of n sets of vesicles of the<br>
invention, prepared from n different strains of a bacterium. The value of n can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc!<br>
The different strains can be in the same or different serogroups. Preferred mixtures of serogroups<br>
include: A+B; A+C; A+W135; A+Y; B+C; B+W135; B+Y; C+W135; C+Y; W135+Y; A+B+C;<br>
A+B+W135; A+B+Y; A+C+W135; A+C+Y; A+W135+Y; B+C+W135; B+C+Y; C+W135+Y;<br>
A+B+C+W135; A+B+C+Y; B+C+W135+Y; and A+B+C+W135+Y.<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
The invention also provides a kit comprising vesicles of the invention prepared from n different<br>
strains of a "bacterium. The vesicles can be kept and stored separately in the kit until they are required<br>
to be used together e.g. as an admixture, or for simultaneous separate or sequential use.<br>
The invention also provides a process comprising: preparing n sets of vesicles of the invention, one<br>
from each of n different strains of a bacterium; and combining then sets of vesicles. The different<br>
sets can be combined into a kit or into an admixture.<br>
The invention also provides the use of vesicles from a first strain of a bacterium in the manufacture<br>
of a medicament for immunising a patient, wherein the medicament is administered simultaneously<br>
separately or sequentially with vesicles from a second strain of the bacterium.<br>
The invention also the use of vesicles from a first strain of a bacterium in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for immunising a patient, wherein the patient has been pre-immunised with vesicles<br>
from a second strain of the bacterium.<br>
The bacterium is preferably N.meningitidis, and is more preferably from serogroup B. The different<br>
strains may be selected according to various criteria. Example criteria include: subtype and/or<br>
serosubtype [e.g. ref. 47]: immunotype; geographical origin of the strains; local prevalence of clinical<br>
strains; hypervirulent lineage e.g. one or more of subgroups I, IH and IV-1, ET-5 complex, ET-37<br>
complex, A4 cluster and lineage 3; multilocus sequence type (MLST) [54].<br>
Preferred criteria for selecting strains are: selection of more than one PorB serotype (class 2 or 3<br>
OMP); selection of more than one PorA serosubtype (class 1 OMP); selection of more than one<br>
different immunotype (lipopolysaccharide or lipoollgosaccharide); selection of more than one of the<br>
three different NMB1870 variants [55]. NMB1870 is seen in the vesicles of the invention, shows<br>
distinct variants, and is a good candidate antigen for vaccination [55-57]. A combination of vesicles<br>
covering two or three different NMB1870 variants is particular advantageous.<br>
As well as being selected from different meningococcal strains, vesicles can be selected from,<br>
different pathogens. Thus the invention provides a composition comprising a mixture of n sets of<br>
vesicles of the invention, prepared from n different species of bacteria. Similarly, the invention<br>
provides a kit comprising vesicles of the invention prepared from n different species of bacteria, and<br>
provides a process comprising the step of preparing n sets of vesicles of the invention, one from each<br>
of n different species of bacteria.<br>
MltA expression<br>
Bacteria of the invention do not possess functional MltA enzymatic activity. Prevention of MltA<br>
protein expression can be achieved in two main ways: removal or disruption of the endogenous mltA<br>
gene (including its control regions) to give a MltA" strain; or suppression of MltA expression in a<br>
MltA+ strain. It is preferred to use a MltA- strain.<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
MltA- strains can be constructed by conventional knockout techniques. Techniques for gene<br>
knockout are well known, and meningococcus knockout mutants of have been reported previously<br>
[e.g. refs. 25 &amp; 58-60]. The knockout is preferably achieved by deletion of at least a portion of the<br>
coding region (preferably isogenic deletion), but any other .suitable technique may be used<br>
e.g. deletion or mutation of the promoter, deletion or mutation of the start codon, etc. The bacterium<br>
may contain a marker gene in place of the knocked out gene e.g. an antibiotic resistance marker.<br>
Where suppression of expression from an endogenous mltA gene is used then techniques such as<br>
antisense inhibition and inhibitory RNA can be used, although these techniques are moTe typically<br>
used in eukaryotic hosts, in the resulting bacterium, mRNA encoding the knocked-out protein will be<br>
substantially absent and/or its translation will be substantially inhibited {e.g. to less than 1% of the<br>
itvzl of expression tinat would bs seen in the absence of suppression).<br>
As an alternative to knockout or suppression of expression, site-directed rnutagenesis of the<br>
endogenous mltA gene can be used. Reference 61 discloses mutants of meningococcal MltA in which<br>
residues Glu255, Glu323 and Asp362 were mutated and then tested for MltA catalytic activity. An<br>
E255G mutant of showed a 50% reduction in activity, and an E323G mutant showed a 70%<br>
reduction in activity. Mutagenesis of specific residues within the MltA coding region can therefore<br>
be used as a technique to knockout the lyric transglycolase enzymatic activity without knocking out<br>
the coding region.<br>
Whichever technique (or combination of techniques) is chosen, the resulting bacterium will be<br>
substantially free from MltA enzymatic activity.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising (a) vesicles of the invention and<br>
(b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The invention also provides a process for preparing such a<br>
composition, comprising the step of admixing vesicles of the invention with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier.<br>
Typical 'pharmaceutically acceptable carriers' include any carrier that does not itself induce the<br>
production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition. Suitable carriers are<br>
typically large, slowly metabolised macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, polylactic<br>
acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, and lipid aggregates (such<br>
as oil droplets or liposomes). Such carriers are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The<br>
vaccines may also contain diluents, such as water, saline, glycerol, etc. Additionally, auxiliary<br>
substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering substances, sucrose, and the like,<br>
may be present Sterile pyrogen-free, phosphate-buffered physiologic saline (e.g. pH 7.4) is a typical<br>
carrier. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients is available in reference 62.<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
Compositions of the invention will typically be in aqueous form (i.e. solutions or suspensions) rather<br>
than in a dried form (e.g. lyophilised). Aqueous compositions are also suitable for reconstituting<br>
other vaccines from a lyophilised form (e.g. a lyophilised Hib conjugate vaccine, a lyophilised<br>
meningococcal conjugate vaccine, etc.). Where a composition of the invention is to be used for such<br>
extemporaneous reconstitution, the invention provides a kit, which may comprise two vials, or may<br>
comprise one ready-filled syringe and one vial, with the aqueous contents of the syringe being used<br>
to reactivate the dried contents of the vial prior to injection.<br>
Compositions of the invention may be presented in vials, or they may be presented in ready-filled<br>
syringes. The syringes may be supplied with or without needles. Compositions may be packaged in<br>
unit dose form or in multiple dose form. A syringe will generally include a single dose of the<br>
composition, whereas a vial may include a single dose or multiple doses. For multiple dose forms,<br>
therefore, vials, are preferred to pre-fiiled syringes.<br>
Effective dosage volumes can be routinely established, but a typical human dose of the composition<br>
has a volume of about 0.5ml e.g. for intramuscular injection. The RTVM OMV-based vaccine was<br>
administered in a 0.5ml volume [63] by intramuscular injection to the thigh or upper arm. Similar<br>
doses may be used for other delivery routes e.g. an intranasal OMV-based vaccine for atomisation<br>
may have a volume of about lOOul or about 130Îœ1 per spray. [64], with four sprays administered to<br>
give a total dose of about 0.5ml.<br>
The pH of the composition is preferably between 6 and 8, and more preferably between 6.5 and 7.5<br>
(e.g. about 7 or about 7.4). The pH of the RTVM OMV-based vaccine is 7.4 [65], and a pH 
(preferably 
use of a buffer e.g. a Tris buffer, a phosphate buffer, or a bistidine buffer. Compositions of the<br>
invention will generally include a buffer. If a composition comprises an aluminium hydroxide salt, it<br>
is preferred to use a bistidine buffer [66] e.g. at between 1-l0mM, preferably about 5mM. The RIVM<br>
OMV-based vaccine maintains pH by using a l0mM Tris/HCl buffer. The composition may be<br>
sterile and/or pyrogen-free. Compositions of the invention may be isotonic with respect to humans.<br>
Compositions of the invention are immunogenic, and are more preferably vaccine compositions.<br>
Vaccines according to the invention may either be prophylactic (i.e. to prevent infection) or<br>
therapeutic (i.e. to treat infection), but will typically be prophylactic. Immunogenic compositions<br>
used as vaccines comprise an immunologically effective amount of antigen(s), as well as any other<br>
components, as needed. By 'immunologically effective amount', it is meant that the administration of<br>
that amount to an individual, either in a single dose or as part of a series, is effective for treatment or<br>
prevention. This amount varies depending upon the health and physical condition of the individual to<br>
be treated, age, the taxonomic group of individual to be treated (e.g. non-human primate, primate,<br>
etc.), the capacity of the individual's immune system to synthesise antibodies, the degree of<br>
protection desired, the formulation of the vaccine, the treating doctor's assessment of the medical<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the amount will fall in a relatively broad range<br>
that can be determined through, routine trials. The antigen content of compositions of the invention<br>
will generally be expressed in terms of the amount of protein per dose. A dose of about 0.9 mg<br>
protein per ml is typical for OMV-based intranasal vaccines [64]. The MeNZBâ„¢ OMV-based<br>
vaccine contains between 25 and 200 Î¼g of protein per millilitre e.g. between 45 and 90 jig/ml, or<br>
50Â±10 p.g/ml. Compositions of the invention preferably include less than 100Î¼g/ml of OMV per<br>
strain of bacterium.<br>
Meningococci affect various areas of the body and so the compositions of the invention may be<br>
prepared in various forms. For example, the compositions may be prepared as injectables, either as<br>
liquid solutions or suspensions. The composition may be prepared for pulmonary administration e.g.<br>
as an. inhaler, using a fine powder or a spray. The composition may be prepared as a suppository or<br>
pessary. The composition may be prepared for nasal, aural or ocular administration e.g. as spray,<br>
drops, gel or powder [e.g. refs 67 &amp; 68].<br>
Compositions of the invention may include an antimicrobial, particularly when packaged in multiple<br>
dose format. Antimicrobials such as thiomersal and 2-phenoxyethanol are commonly found in<br>
vaccines, but it is preferred to use either a mercury-free preservative or no preservative at all.<br>
Compositions of the invention may comprise detergent e.g. a Twcen (polysorbate), such as Tween<br>
80. Detergents are generally present at low levels e.g. 
Compositions of the invention may include sodium salts {e.g. sodium chloride) to give tonicity. A<br>
concentration of 10+2 mg/ml NaCl is typical. The concentration of sodium chloride is preferably<br>
greater than 7.5 mg/ml.<br>
Compositions of the invention will generally be administered in conjunction with other<br>
immunoregulatory agents. In particular, compositions will usually include one or more adjuvants,<br>
and the invention provides a process for preparing a composition of the invention, comprising the<br>
step of admixing vesicles of the invention with an adjuvant e.g. in a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier. Suitable adjuvants include, but are not limited to:<br>
A.      Mineral-containing compositions<br>
Mineral containing compositions suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include mineral salts,<br>
such as aluminium salts and calcium salts. The invention includes mineral salts such as hydroxides<br>
(e.g. oxyhydroxides), phosphates {e.g. hydroxyphosphates, orthophosphates), sulphates, etc. [e.g. see<br>
chapters 8 &amp; 9 of ref. 69], or mixtures of different mineral compounds, with the compounds taking<br>
any suitable form {e.g. gel, crystalline, amorphous, etc.), and with adsorption being preferred. The<br>
mineral containing compositions may also be formulated as a particle of metal salt [70].<br>
A typical aluminium phosphate adjuvant is amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate with PO4/AI<br>
molar ratio between 0.84 and 0.92, included at 0.6mg Al3+/ml. Adsorption with a low dose of<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
aluminium phosphate may be used e.g. between 50 and 100p.g Al3+ per conjugate per dose. Where an<br>
aluminium phosphate it used and it is desired not to adsorb an antigen to the adjuvant, this is<br>
favoured by including free phosphate ions in solution (e.g. by the use of a phosphate buffer).<br>
The RTVM vaccine was tested with adsorption to either an aluminium phosphate or an aluminium<br>
hydroxide adjuvant, and the aluminium phosphate adjuvant was found to give superior results [65].<br>
Hie MeNZBâ„¢, MenBvacâ„¢ abd VA-MENINGOC-BCâ„¢ products all include an aluminium<br>
hydroxide adjuvant<br>
A typical dose of aluminium adjuvant is about 3.3 mg/ml (expressed as Al3+ concentration).<br>
B.	-     Oil Emulsions<br>
Oil emulsion compositions suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include squalene-water<br>
emulsions, such as MF59 [Chapter 10 of ref. 69; see also ref. 71] (5% Squalene, 0.5% Tween 80, and<br>
0.5% Span 85, formulated into submicron particles using a microfluidizer). Complete Freund's<br>
adjuvant (CFA) and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) may also be used.<br>
C.	Saponin formulations [chapter 22 of ref. 69 J<br>
Saponin formulations may also be used as adjuvants in the invention. Saponins are a heterologous<br>
group of sterol glycosides and triterpenoid glycosides that are found in the bark, ieaves, stems, -roots<br>
and even flowers of a wide range of plant species. Saponin from the bark of the Quillaia saponaria<br>
Molina tree have been widely studied as adjuvants. Saponin can also be commercially obtained from<br>
Smilax ornata (sarsaprilla), Gypsophilla paniculata (brides veil), and Saponaria officianalis (soap<br>
root). Saponin adjuvant formulations include purified formulations, such as QS21, as well as lipid<br>
formulations, such as ISCOMs. QS21 is marketed as Stimulonâ„¢.<br>
Saponin compositions have been purified using HPLC and RP-HPLC. Specific purified fractions<br>
using these techniques have been identified, including QS7, QS17, QS18, QS21, QH-A, QH-B and<br>
QH-C. Preferably, the saponin is QS21. A method of production of QS21 is disclosed in ref. 72.<br>
Saponin formulations may also comprise a sterol, such as cholesterol [73].<br>
Combinations of saponins and cholesterois can be used to form unique particles called<br>
immunostimulating complexs (ISCOMs) [chapter 23 of ref. 69]. ISCOMs typically also include a<br>
phospholipid such as phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine. Any known saponin can be<br>
used in ISCOMs. Preferably, the ISCOM includes one or more of QuilA, QHA and QHC. ISCOMs<br>
are further described in refs. 73-75. Optionally, the ISCOMS may be devoid of extra detergent [76].<br>
A review of the development of saponin based adjuvants can be found in refs. 77 &amp; 78.<br>
D.      Virosomes and virus-like particles<br>
Virosomes and virus-like particles (VLPs) can also be used as adjuvants in the invention. These<br>
structures generally contain one or more proteins from a virus optionally combined or formulated<br>
with a phospholipid. They are generally non-pathogenic, non-replicating and generally do not contain<br>
any of the native viral genome. The viral proteins may be recombinantly produced or isolated from<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
whole viruses. These viral proteins suitable for use in virosomes or VLPs include proteins derived<br>
from influenza virus (such as HA or NA), Hepatitis B virus (such as core or capsid proteins),<br>
Hepatitis E virus, measles virus, Sindbis virus, Rotavirus, Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus, Retrovirus,<br>
Norwalk virus, human Papiiloma virus, HIV, RNA-phages, Q15-phage (such as coat proteins), GA-<br>
phage. fr-phage, AP205 phage, and Ty (such as retrotransposon Ty protein pi). VLPs are discussed<br>
further in refs. 79-84. Virosomes are discussed further in, for example, ref. 85<br>
E.     Bacterial or microbial derivatives<br>
Adjuvants suitable for use in the invention include bacterial or microbial derivatives such as<br>
non-toxic derivatives of enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Lipid A derivatives,<br>
immunpstimulatory oligonucleotides and ADP-ribosylating toxins and detoxified derivatives thereof.<br>
Non-toxic derivatives of LPS include monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and 3-O-deacylated MPL<br>
(3dMpL). 3dMPL is a mixture of 3 de-O-acyiated monophosphoryi lipid A with 4, 5 or 6 acylated<br>
chains. A preferred "small particle" form of 3 De-O-acylated monophosphoryi lipid A is disclosed in<br>
ref. 86. Such "small particles" of 3dMPL are small enough to be sterile filtered through a 0.22Î¼m<br>
membrane [86]. Other non-toxic LPS derivatives include monophosphoryi lipid A mimics, such as<br>
aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphate derivatives e.g. RC-529 [87,88].<br>

described for example in refs. 89 &amp; 90.<br>
Immunostimulatory oligonucleotides suitable for use as adjuvants in the invention include nucleotide<br>
sequences containing a CpG motif (a dinucleotide sequence containing an unrnethylated cytosine<br>
linked by a phosphate bond to a guanosine). Double-stranded RNAs and oligonucleotides containing<br>
palindromic or poly(dG) sequences have also been shown to be immunostimulatory.<br>
The CpG's can include nucleotide modifications/analogs such as phosphorothioate modifications and<br>
can be double-stranded or single-stranded. References 91, 92 and 93 disclose possible analog<br>
substitutions e.g. replacement of guanosine with 2'-deoxy-7-deazaguanosine. The adjuvant effect of<br>
CpG oligonucleotides is further discussed in refs. 94-99.<br>
The CpG sequence may be directed to TLR9, such as the motif GTCGTT or TTCGTT [100]. The<br>
CpG sequence may be specific for inducing a Thl immune response, such as a CpG-A ODN, or it<br>
may be more specific for inducing a B cell response, such a CpG-B ODN. CpG-A and CpG-B ODNs<br>
are discussed in refs. 101-103. Preferably, the CpG is a CpG-A ODN.<br>
Preferably, the CpG oligonucleotide is constructed so that the 5' end is accessible for receptor<br>
recognition. Optionally;, two CpG oligonucleotide sequences may be attached at their 31 ends to form<br>
"immunomers". See, for example, refs. 100 &amp; 104-106.<br>
Bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins and detoxified derivatives thereof may be used as adjuvants in the<br>
invention. Preferably,, the protein is derived from E.coli (E.coli heat labile enterotoxin "LT"), cholera<br>
("CT"), or pertussis ("PT"). The use of detoxified ADP-ribosylating toxins as mucosal adjuvants is<br>

form, of a holotoxin, comprising both A and B subunits. Preferably, the A subunit contains a<br>
detoxifying mutation; preferably the B subunit is not mutated. Preferably, the adjuvant is a detoxified<br>
LT mutant such as LT-K63, LT-R72, and LT-G192. The use of ADP-ribosylating toxins and<br>
detoxified derivaties thereof, particularly LT-K63 and LT-R72, as adjuvants can be found in refs.<br>
109-116. Numerical reference for amino acid substitutions is preferably based on the alignments of<br>
the A and B subunits of ADP-ribosylating toxins set forth in ref. 117, specifically incorporated herein<br>
by reference in its entirety.<br>

poly(a-hydroxy acid), a polyhydroxybutyric ' acid, a polyorthoester, a polyanhydride, a<br>
polycaprolactone, etc.), with poly(lactide-co-glycolide) are preferred, optionally treated to have a<br>
negatively-charged surface {e.g. with SDS) or a positively-charged surface {e.g. with a cationic<br>
detergent, such as CTAB).<br>
I.       Liposomes ('Chapters 13 &amp; 14 of ref. 69)<br>

more mineral salts (such as an aluminum salt) + a non-toxic derivative of LPS (such as 3dMPL).<br>
Other substances that act as immunostimulating agents are disclosed in chapter 7 of ref. 69. '<br>
The use of aluminium salt adjuvants is particularly preferred, and antigens are generally adsorbed to<br>
such salts. It is possible in compositions of the invention to adsorb some antigens to an aluminium<br>
hydroxide but to have other antigens in association with an aluminium phosphate, hi general,<br>
however, it is preferred to use- only a single salt e.g. a hydroxide or a phosphate, but not both. Not all<br>
vesicles need to be adsorbed i.e. some or all can be free in solution.<br>
Methods of treatment<br>
The invention also provides a method for raising an immune response in a mammal, comprising<br>
administering a pharmaceutical composition of the invention to the mammal. The immune response<br>
is preferably protective and preferably involves antibodies. The method may raise a booster<br>
responsein a patient that has already been primed against N.meningitidis. Subcutaneous and<br>
intranasal prime/boost regimes for OMVs are disclosed in ref. 136.<br>
The mammal is preferably a human. Where the vaccine is for prophylactic use, the human is<br>
preferably a child (e.g. a toddler or infant) or a teenager; where the vaccine is for therapeutic use, the<br>
    -17- .<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
human is preferably an adult. A vaccine intended for children may also be administered to adults<br>
e.g. to assess safety, dosage, immunogenicity, etc.<br>
The invention also provides vesicles of the invention for use as a medicament The medicament is<br>
preferably able to raise an immune response in a mammal (i.e. it is an immxmogenic composition)<br>
and is more preferably a vaccine.<br>
The invention also provides the use of vesicles of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament<br>
for raising an immune response in a mammal.<br>
The invention also the use of vesicles of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for<br>
immunising a patient, wherein the patient has been pre-immunised with at least one of the following:<br>
diphtheria toxoid; tetanus toxoid; acellular or cellular pertussis antigens; a conjugated Hib capsular<br>
saccharide; hepatitis B virus surface antigen: a conjugated rnenicgococcal capsular saccharide;<br>
and/or a conjugated pneumococcal capsular saccharide.<br>
These uses and methods are preferably for the prevention and/or treatment of a disease caused by<br>
N.meningitidis e.g. bacterial (or, more specifically, meningococcal) meningitis, of septicemia.<br>
One way of checking efficacy of therapeutic treatment involves monitoring Neisserial infection after<br>
administration of the composition of the invention. One way of checking efficacy of prophylactic<br>
treatment involves monitoring irnmune responses against the vesicles' antigens after administration<br>
of the composition. Immunogeniciry of compositions of the invention can be determined by<br>
administering them to test subjects (eg. children 12-16 months age, or animal models [137]) and<br>
then determining standard parameters including serum bactericidal antibodies (SBA) and ELISA<br>
titres (GMT). These immune responses will generally be determined around 4 weeks after<br>
administration of the composition, and compared to values determined before administration of the<br>
composition. A SBA increase of at least 4-fold or 8-fold is preferred. Where more than one dose of<br>
the composition is administered, more than one post-administration determination may be made.<br>
Preferred compositions of the invention can confer an antibody titre in a patient that is superior to the<br>
criterion for seroprotection for an acceptable percentage of human subjects. Antigens wifh an<br>
associated antibody titre above which a host is considered tcbe seroconverted against the antigen are<br>
well known, and such titres are published by organisations such as WHO. Preferably more than 80%<br>
of a statistically significant sample of subjects is seroconverted, more preferably more than 90%, still<br>
more preferably more than 93% and most preferably 96-100%.<br>
Compositions of the invention will generally be administered directly to a patient Direct delivery<br>
may be accomplished by parenteral injection (e.g. subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously,<br>
intramuscularly, or to the interstitial space of a tissue), or by rectal, oral, vaginal, topical,<br>
transdermal, intranasal, ocular, aural, pulmonary or other mucosal administration. Intramuscular<br>
administration to the thigh or the upper arm is preferred. Injection may be via a needle (e.g. a<br>
-18-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
hypodermic needle), but needle-free injection may alternatively "be used. A typical intramuscular<br>
dose is 0.5 ml.<br>
Dosage treatment can be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. Multiple doses may be<br>
used in a primary immunisation schedule and/or in a booster immunisation schedule. A primary dose<br>
schedule may be followed by a booster dose schedule. Suitable timing between priming doses<br>
(e.g. between 4-16 weeks), and between priming and boosting, can be routinely determined. The<br>
OMV-based RTVM vaccine was tested using a 3- or 4-dose primary schedule, with vaccination at 0,<br>
2&amp;8 or 0, 1,2&amp;8 months. MeNZBâ„¢ is administered as three doses at six week intervals. These<br>
schedules can be used according to the invention. The vesicle preparations given at each dose stage<br>
can be the same or different<br>
In methods of the invention, where a first dose is given at time zero then a second and a ihiru dose<br>
may be given over the next two months, and a fourth dose may be given between 11 and 13 months<br>
after time zero. The first, second and third doses may comprise vesicles with the same serosubtype as<br>
each other, and the fourth dose may comprises vesicles with a different serosubtype from the first<br>
three doses. The fourth dose may contain vesicles only with a different serosubtype from the first<br>
three doses, or it may contain two types of vesicle, one with a different serosubtype from the first<br>
three doses and one with the same subtype. The first, second and third doses are preferably given, at<br>
intervals of between 6 and 8 weeks. The fourth dose is preferably given about 1 year after time zero. <br>
The patient preferably receives the same quantity of vaccine at each of the four doses.<br>
As described above, the invention may involve administration of vesicles from more than one:<br>
subtype and/or serosubtype of N.meningitidis [e.g. ref. 47], either separately or in admixture.<br>
The invention may be used to elicit systemic and/or mucosal immunity.<br>
In general, compositions of the invention are able to induce serum bactericidal antibody responses<br>
after being administered to a subject. These responses are conveniently measured in mice and are a<br>
standard indicator of vaccine efficacy [e.g. see end-note 14 of reference 196]. Serum bactericidal<br>
activity (SBA) measures bacterial killing mediated by complement, and can be assayed using human<br>
or baby rabbit complement. WHO standards require a vaccine to induce at least a 4-fold rise in SBA<br>
in more than 90% of recipients. MeNZBâ„¢ elicits a 4-fold rise in SBA 4-6 weeks after administration<br>
of the third dose.<br>
Rather than offering narrow protection, compositions of the invention can induce bactericidal<br>
antibody responses against more than one hypervirulent lineage of serogroup B. In particular, they<br>
can preferably induce bactericidal responses against two or three of the following three hypervirulent<br>
lineages: (i) cluster A4; (ii) ET5 complex; and (iii) lineage 3. They may additionally induce<br>
bactericidal antibody responses against one or more of hypervirulent lineages subgroup I, subgroup<br>
m, subgroup IV-1 or ET-37 complex, and against other lineages e.g. hyperinvasive lineages. This<br>
does not necessarily mean that the composition can induce bactericidal antibodies against each and<br>
-19-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
every strain of serogroup B meningococcus within these hypervirulent lineages e.g. rather, for any<br>
given group of four of more strains of serogroup B meningococcus within a particular hypervirulent<br>
lineage, the antibodies induced by the composition are "bactericidal against at least 50% (e.g. 60%,<br>
70%, 80%, 90% or more) of the group. Preferred groups of strains will include strains isolated in at<br>
least four of the following countries: GB, AU, CA, NO, IT, US, NZ, NL, BR, and CU. The serum<br>
preferably has a bactericidal titre of at least 1024 (e.g. 210, 211, 212,213, 2M, 215, 216, 217, 218 or higher,<br>
preferably at least 214) e.g. the serum is able to kill at least 50% of test bacteria of a particular strain<br>
when diluted 1/1024, as described in reference 196.<br>
Preferred compositions can induce bactericidal responses against the following strains of serogroup<br>
B meningococcus: (i) from cluster A4, strain 961-5945 (B:2b:P1.21,16) and/or strain G2136 (B:-);<br>
(ii) from ET-5 complex, strain MC5S (B:15:P1.7,16b) and/or strain 44/76 (B:15:P1.7.16): (iii) from<br>
lineage 3, strain 394/98 (B:4:PL4) and/or strain BZ19S (B:NT:-). More preferred compositions can<br>
induce bactericidal responses against strains 961-5945, 44/76 and 394/98.<br>
Strains 961-5945 and G2136 are both Neisseria MLST reference strains [ids 638 &amp; 1002 in ref. 138].<br>
Strain MC58 is widely available (e.g. ATCC BAA-335) and was the strain sequenced in reference<br>
32. Strain 44/76 has been widely used and characterised (e.g. ref. 139) and is one of the Neisseria<br>
MLST reference strains [id 237 in ref. 138; row 32 of Table 2 in ref. 33]. Strain 394/98 was<br>
originally isolated in New Zealand in 1998, and there have been several published studies using this<br>
strain (e.g. refs. 140 &amp; 141). Strain BZ198 is another MLST reference strain [id 409 in ref. 138; row<br>
41 of Table 2 in ref. 33].<br>

-	an antigen from Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) [e.g. 170,171,172].<br>
Where a saccharide or carbohydrate antigen is used, it is preferably conjugated to a carrier in order to<br>
enhance immunogenicity. Conjugation of H.influenzae B, meningococcal and pneumococcal<br>
saccharide antigens is well known.<br>
Toxic protein antigens may be detoxified where necessary (e.g. detoxification of pertussis toxin by<br>
chemical and/or genetic means [152]).<br>
Where a diphtheria antigen is included in the composition it is preferred also to include tetanus<br>
antigen and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a tetanus antigen is included it is preferred also to<br>
include diphtheria and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a pertussis antigen is included it is<br>
preferred also to include diphtheria and tetanus antigens. DTP combinations are thus preferred.<br>
Saccharide antigens are preferably in the form of conjugates. Preferred carrier proteins for conjugates<br>
are bacterial toxins or toxoids, such as diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid The CRM197 mutant of<br>
diphtheria toxin. [173-175] is a particularly preferred carrier for, as is a diphtheria toxoid. Other<br>

be covered: B+A; B+C; B+W135; B+Y; B+C+W135; B+C+Y; B+W135+Y; B+A+C+W135;<br>
B+A+C+Y; B+A+W135+Y; B+C+W135+Y; and B+A+C+W135+Y. Two preferred combinations<br>
use serogroup B Vesicles plus conjugate antigens from either serogroups A+W135+Y or serogroups<br>
A+C+W135+Y. In general, it is possible to cover all five of serogroups A, B, C, W135 and Y by<br>
choosing Vesicles for x serogroup(s) and conjugated saccharides for the remaining 5-x serogroups.<br>

sequences, wherein n is 7 or more (eg. 8,10, 12,14,16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90,<br>
100, 150, 200, 250 or more). Preferred fragments for (b) comprise an epitope from the relevant<br>
sequence. More than one (e.g.  2, 3, 4, 5, 6) of these polypeptides may be included. The<br>
meningococcal antigens transferrin binding protein and/or Hsf protein may also be added [203].<br>
-22-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
Supplementation of the OMVs by defined meningococcal antigens in this way is particularly useful<br>
where the OMVs are from a serosubtype P1.7b,4- meningococcus or a serosubfype Pl.7,16<br>
meningococcus. Supplementation of a mixture of OMVs from both these serosubtypes is preferred.<br>
It is also possible to add vesicles that are not vesicles of the invention e.g. OMVs, MVs, NOMVs,<br>
etc. that are prepared by methods other than those of the invention (e.g. prepared by methods<br>
involving disruption of bacterial membranes, as disclosed in the prior art).<br>
Antigens in the composition will typically be present at a concentration of at least lug/mi each. In<br>
general, the concentration of any given antigen will be sufficient to elicit an immune response against<br>
that antigen.<br>
As art alternative to using protein antigens in the composition of the invention, nucleic acid encoding<br>
the antigen may be used. Protein components of the compositions of the invention may thus be<br>
replaced by nucieic acid (preferably DN A e.g. in the form of a plasmid) that encodes the protein.<br>
New meningococcal proteins<br>
The genome sequence of serogroup B meningococcus is reported in reference 32. The initial<br>
annotation of the genome has not been accepted for all of the &gt;2000 genes e.g. the start codon on<br>
NMBI870 has subsequently been re-assigned [41,55]. The inventors have found that the start codons<br>
for NMB0928, NMB0109 and NMB1057 should also be re-assigned:<br>
?	The original sequence of NMB0928 is shown in Figure 6 (SEQ ID NO: 3). The inventors believe<br>
that the true start codon for NMB0928 is the ATG encoding the methionine at residue 24 of<br>
Figure 6. With the new start codon (SEQ ID NO: 6), NMB0928 presents a typical signature of a 'â€¢<br>
surface-exposed protein, characterised by a signal peptide with a lipo-box motif (underlined).<br>
?	The .original sequence of NMBOl 09 is shown in Figure 7 (SEQ ID NO: 4). The inventors believe<br>
that the true start codon for NMB0109 is the ATG encoding the Met at residue 39 of Figure 7.<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 7)<br>
?	The original sequence of NMB1057 is shown in Figure 8 (SEQ ID NO: 5). The inventors believe<br>
that the true start codon for NMB1057 is the GTG encoding the Val at residue 14 of Figure 8.<br>
(SEQ ID NO: 8)<br>
Thus the invention provides a polypeptide comprising: (a) the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6;<br>
 (b) an amino acid sequence having at least 50% (e.g. 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%,<br>
98%, 99%, 99.5% or more) sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:6, and/or comprising an amino acid<br>
sequence consisting of a fragment of at least 7 {e.g. 8, 9, 10,11,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21,<br>
22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 225,<br>
250) contiguous amino acids from SEQ ID NO:6. Preferred polypeptides have aN-terminus cysteine<br>

The invention also provides a polypeptide comprising: (a) the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:7;<br>

amino acids of their N-teiminus.<br>
The invention also provides a polypeptide comprising: (a) the amino acid sequence of SEQ ED NO: 8;<br>
(b) .an amino acid sequence having at least 50% (e.g. 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95?/o, 96%, 97%,<br>
98%, 99%, 99.5% or more) sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:8, and/or comprising an amino acid<br>

250) contiguous amino acids from SEQ ID NO: 8. Preferred polypeptides have a N-terminus cysteine<br>
residue, preferably corresponding to Cys-Gln of SEQ ID NO:8, and the N-terminus cysteine is<br>
preferably lipidated. Other preferred polypeptides do not include the anuno acid sequence '<br>
MPCMNHQSNS (SEQ ID NO: 11) within 20 arnino acids of their N-terminus.<br>
Polypeptides can be prepared by various means e.g. by chemical synthesis (at least in part), by<br>
digesting longer polypeptides using proteases, by translation from RNA, by purification from cell<br>
culture (e.g. from recombinant expression or from N.meningitidis culture), etc. Heterologous<br>
expression in an E.coli host is a preferred expression route.<br>
Polypeptides of the invention may be attached or immobilised to a solid support. Polypeptides of the<br>
invention may comprise a detectable label e.g. a radioactive label, a fluorescent label, or a biotin<br>
label. This is particularly useful in immunoassay techniques.<br>
Polypeptides can take various forms (e.g. native, fusions, glycosylated, non-glycosylated, lipidated,<br>
disulfide bridges, etc.). Polypeptides are preferably meningococcal polypeptides.<br>
Polypeptides are preferably prepared in substantially pure or substantially isolated form (i.e.<br>
substantially free from other Neisserial or host cell polypeptides) or substantially isolated form. In<br>
general, the polypeptides are provided in a non-naturally occurring environment e.g. they are<br>
separated from their naturally-occurring environment In certain embodiments, the subject<br>
polypeptide is present in a composition that is enriched for the polypeptide as compared to a control.<br>
As such, purified polypeptide is provided, whereby purified is meant that the polypeptide is present<br>
in a composition that is substantially free of other expressed polypeptides, where by substantially<br>
-24-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
free is meant that less than 50%, usually less than 30% and more usually less than 10% of the<br>
composition is made up of other expressed polypeptides.<br>
The term "polypeptide" refers to amino acid polymers of any length. The polymer may be linear or<br>
branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The<br>
terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for<br>
example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any<br>
other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also included<br>
within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid<br>
(including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the art.<br>
Polypeptides can occur as single chains or associated chains.<br>
General<br>
The term "comprising" encompasses "including" as well as "consisting" e.g. a composition<br>
"comprising" X may consist exclusively of X or may include something additional e.g. X + Y.<br>
The term "about" in relation to a numerical value x means, for example, xÂ±10%.<br>
The word "substantially" does not exclude "completely" e.g. a composition which is "substantially<br>
free" from Y may be completely free from Y. Where necessary, the word "substantially" may be<br>
omitted from the definition of the invention.<br>
References to a percentage sequence identity between two amino acid sequences means that, when<br>
aligned, that percentage of amino acids are the same in comparing the two sequences. This alignment<br>
and the percent homology or'sequence identity can be determined using software programs known in '<br>
the art, for example those described in section 7.7.18 of reference 204. A preferred alignment is<br>
determined by the Smith-Waterman homology search algorithm using an affine gap search with a<br>
gap open penalty of 12 and a gap extension penalty of 2, BLOSUM matrix of 62. The Smith-<br>
Watennan homology search algorithm is well known and is disclosed in reference 205.<br>
References to 'NMB' proteins with a four digit number refers to the standard nomenclature of<br>
reference 32, assigned on the basis of a genome sequence of a prototypic strain of serogroup B<br>
meningococcus. The public sequence databases include these NMB sequences. For any given<br>
meningococcus, the skilled person can readily and unambiguously find the gene corresponding to a<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Preparation of meningococcal ? mltA knockout sti'ain<br>
A meningococcal strain was prepared in which the mltA gene is replaced by allelic exchange with an<br>
antibiotic cassette.<br>
N.meningitidis strain MC58 was transformed with plasmid pBSUDGNA33ERM- This plasmid<br>
contains upstream and downstream flanking regions for allelic exchange, a truncated mltA gene, and<br>
the ermC gene (encoding erythromycin resistance). The upstream flanking region (including the start<br>
-26-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
codon) from position -867 to +75 and the downstream flanking region (including the stop codon)<br>
from position +1268 to +1744 were amplified from MC58 by using the primers U33FOR, U33REV,<br>
D33FOR and D33REV [25]. Fragments were cloned into pBluescriptâ„¢ and transformed'into E.coli<br>
DH5 by using standard techniques. Once all subcloning was complete, naturally competent Neisseria<br>
strain MC58 was transformed by selecting a few colonies grown overnight on GC agar plates and<br>
mixing them with 20ul 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing lp.g plasmid DNA. The mixture was<br>
spotted onto a chocolate agar plate, incubated for 6 h at 37Â°C with 5% CO2, and then diluted in<br>
 phosphate buffered-saline (PBS) and spread on GC agar plates containing 7ug/ml erythromycin.<br>
Allelic exchange with the chromosomal mltA gene was verified by PCR, and lack of MltA expression<br>
was confirmed by Western blot analysis.<br>
As reported in reference 25, the ?mltA knockout strain does not have the correct topoiogical<br>
organisation of the cellular membrane, has abnormal cell separation, abnormal cell morphology,<br>
 undivided "septa, "double sepfa,~c'ell clustering, sharing of outer membranes arid-reduced virulence:<br>
Reference 25 also reports that the knockout strain releases various membrane proteins into the<br>
culture supernatant, including the PqrA, PIB, class 4 and class 5 outer membrane proteins.<br>
A ?mltA knockout was also made from New Zealand strain 394/98 (Kn3; B:4:P1.4), which is the<br>
strain from which the MeNZBâ„¢ product is produced.<br>
Analysis of released proteins<br>
The ?mltA strain was grown in GC culture medium in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 <br>
until OD600nm 0.5. Bacteria were collected by 10 minutes of centrifugation at 3500 x g. The<br>
supernatant {i.e. culture medium) was filtered through a 0.22 pm pore size filter (Millipore), and the <br>
cell-free  filtrate  was   subjected  to  high-speed  centrifiigation  (200,000  x g,  90  nan).  This<br>
centrifugation resulted in formation of a pellet, with about 8-12 mg protein per litre of culture<br>
medium. No such pellet was seen if wild-type MC58 bacteria were treated in the same way, and so<br>
the pellet formation is a result of the ?mltA knockout. The pellet was washed twice with PBS<br>
(centrifiigation 200,000 x g, 30 min) for further analysis.<br>
In a first analysis, material from the pellet was re-suspended in PBS and applied to a Superdex 200<br>
PC3.2/30 gel filtration column, run on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) that had been<br>
equilibrated in PBS. The flow rate was 40 pl/min, and eluate was monitored at 280 nm. The column<br>
was calibrated with 20 ug Bleu dextran (2,000 kDa), 10 u.g ferritine (440 kDa), 140 ug bovine serum<br>
albumin. (65 kDa)- and 200 fig ribonuclease A (15 kDa). As shown in Figure 3,.most offhe-proteiDS<br>
eluted in a major peak corresponding to a molecular weight substantially higher than 2,000 kDa. This<br>
result suggests that the various proteins are associated.<br>
In a second analysis, the material present in the high molecular weight peak was subjected to<br>
negative staining electron microscopy. This analysis revealed the presence of well-organised<br>
membrane vesicles with a diameter of about 50-100 nm (Figure 4).<br>
-27-     '<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
These experiments suggest that deletion of the mltA gene perturbs the normal assembly of the<br>
bacterial membrane, and that this results in the spontaneous release into the culture supernatant of<br>
membrane structures which assemble in spherical, homogeneous vesicles.<br>
Figure 12 shows SDS-PAGE analysis of culture media after growth of wild-type or ? GNA33<br>
bacteria, and shows the different protein release characteristics.<br>
Analysis of vesicles<br>
The ?mltaA-derived vesicles were compared to meningococcal vesicles prepared by the 'normal'<br>
detergent extraction method.<br>
Meningococcal strains MC58, NZ394/98 and NZ98/254, and their respective isogenic ?mltaA<br>
mutants, were grown in 20 ml or 200 ml GC culture medium in humidified atmosphere containing<br>
5% CO2 until OD620nm 0,5. Bacteria were collected by 10-rninute centrifugation at 3500g. Vesicles<br>
(DOMVs) were prepared from the wild-type bacteria by detergent extraction as described in <br>
reference 206. Vesicles of the invention ('mOMVs') were prepared from knockout strains by<br>
filtration through a 0J22um pore size filter, followed by high-speed centrifiigation (200,000g, 90<br>
min) of the filtrates, washing of the vesicle-containing pellets (centrifugation 200,000g, 30 min)<br>
twice with phosphate buffer saline, (PBS), and then re-suspension with PBS.<br>
Both the mOMVs and the DOMVs were analysed by denaturing mono-dimensional electrophoresis.<br>
Briefly, 20ug of vesicle proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualised by Coomassie Blue<br>
staining of 12.5% gels. Denaturing (2% SDS) and semi-denaturing (0.2% SDS, no ditbiothreitol, no<br>
heating) conditions were used mono-dimensional electrophoresis. The amount of protein (20ug) was<br>
determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard protein.<br>
The vesicles were denatured for 3 minutes at 95Â°C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2%<br>
SDS. 20|ig of protein were then loaded onto 12,5% acrylamide gels, which were stained with<br>
Coomassie Blue R-250. 2-dimensional electrophoresis was also performed on 200ug of protein<br>
brought to a final volume of 125U1 with re-swelling buffer containing 7M urea, 2M thiourea, 2%<br>
(w/v) (3-((3-cholanudopropyl)dimethylammonio)-l-propane-sulfonate), 65 mM ditbiothreitol, 2%<br>
(w/v) amidosulfobetain-14, 2 mM tributylphosphine, 20mM Tris, and 2% (v/v) carrier ampholyte.<br>
Proteins were adsorbed overnight onto Immobiline DryStrips (7 cm; pH-gradient 3-10 non linear).<br>
Proteins were then 2D-separated. The first dimension was run using a IPGphor Isoelectric Focusing<br>
Unit, applying sequentially 150 V for 35 min., 500 V for 35 min., 1,000 V for 30 min, 2,600 V for 10<br>
min., 3,500 V for 15 mm., 4,200 V for 15 min", and finally 5,000 V to reach 12kVh. For the second<br>
dimension, the strips were equilibrated and proteins were separated on linear 9-16.5%<br>
polyacrylamide gels (1.5-mm thick, 4x7 cm ). Gels were again stained with Coomassie Brilliant<br>
Blue G-250.266 protein spots could be seen after Colloidal Coomassie Blue staining (Figure 2).<br>
-28-'<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
The ID and 2D gels were then subjected to in-gel protein digestion and sample preparation for mass<br>
spectrometry analysis. Protein spots were excised from the gels, washed with 100 mM ammonium<br>
bicarbonate/acetonitrile 50/50 (V/V), and dried using a SpeedVac centrifuge. Dried spots were<br>
digested 2 hours at 3TC in. 12 pi of 0.012 ug/ul sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) in 50 mM<br>
ammonium bicarbonate, 5 mM. After digestion. 5 ul of 0.1 % trifiuoacetic acid was added, and the<br>
peptides were desalted and concentrated with ZTP-TIPs (CIS, Millipore). Sample were eluted with<br>
2 ul of 5 g/1 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid onto the mass<br>
spectrometer Anchorchip 384 (400 urn, Bruker, Bremen, Germany) and allowed to air dry at room<br>
temperature. MALDI-TOF spectra were acquired on a Bruker Biflex HI MALDI-TOF equipped with<br>
a 337 nmN2 laser and a SCOUT 384 muMprobe ion source set in a positive-ion reflector mode. The<br>
acceleration and reflector voltages were set at 19 kV and 20 kV, respectively. Typically, each<br>
spectrum was determined by averaging 100 laser shots. Spectra were externally calibrated using a<br>
combination of four standard peptides, angiotensin II (1,046.54 Da), substance P (1,347.74 Da),<br>
Bombensm (1,619.82 Da) and ACTH18-39 Clip human (2,465.20 Da), spotted onto adjacent<br>
position to the samples. Protein identification was carried out by both automatic and manual<br>
comparison of experimentally-generated monoisotopic values of peptides in the mass range of<br>
700-3000 Da with computer-generated fingerprint's using the Mascot software.<br>
Results from the MC58 ?mltA 'mutant are shown in Figure 18. From the 20 excised bands on just the<br>
ID gel, 25 unique proteins were identified; 24 (96%) of which were predicted to be outer-membrane<br>
proteins by the PSORT algorithm (Table 1 below). 170 protein spots on the 2D gel, corresponding to <br>
51 unique proteins, were unambiguously identified by MALDI-TOF (Table 1). 44/51 identified <br>
proteins have been assigned to the outer membrane compartment by the genome annotation [32]. The<br>
7 remaining proteins were analysed for possible errors in the original annotation. Four proteins (the<br>
hypothetical proteins NMB1870, NMB0928  and NMB0109,  and the  glutamylrranspeptidase<br>
NMB1057) could be classified as outer membrane proteins using different start codons from those in<br>
ref. 32 e.g. for NMB1870, using the start codon assigned in reference 55.<br>
The combined ID and 2D eiectrophoresis experiments identified a total of 65 proteins in the MC58<br>
?mltA mutant-derived vesicles. Of these, 6 proteins were identified in both ID and 2D gels, whereas<br>
14 and 45 were specific for the ID and 2D gels, respectively (Table 1). Moreover, 61 out of the 65<br>
identified proteins were predicted as membrane-associated proteins by current algorithms, indicating<br>
that the ?mltA vesicles (mOMVs) are mostly, and possible exclusively, constituted by membrane<br>
proteins.. .<br>
The ?mltA knockout of strain NZ394/98 was similarly subjected to ID and 2D SDS-PAGE (Figures<br>
14 &amp; 15). Table 2 shows 66 proteins that were identified in one or both of the gels, together with the<br>
predicted location of the proteins. Again, most of the proteins were predicted as membrane-<br>
associated. The 47 proteins common to Tables 1 and 2 are shown in Table 3.<br>
-29-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
Results from the NZ98/254 ?mltA mutant are shown in Figure 19. 66 proteins were identified from<br>
these two gels, 57 of which were assigned to the outer membrane compartment. Again, therefore, the<br>
mOMVs are highly enriched in outer membrane proteins. 46 of the 57 proteins had also been<br>
identified in the MC'58-derived mOMVs.<br>
 For comparison, Figure 20 shows the results from NZ98/254 DOMVs. Proteomic analysis revealed<br>
138 proteins, only 44 of which were assigned to the outer membrane compartment. The remaining 94<br>
proteins belonged to the cytoplasmic and inner membrane compartments. Of these 44 membrane<br>
proteins, 32 were also found in the 57 outer membrane proteins found in the mOMVs from the<br>
isogenic strain.<br>
While mOMVs are largely constituted by outer membrane proteins, therefore, about 70% of DOMV<br>
proteins are either cytoplasmic or inner membrane proteins. DOMVs differ from mOMVs not only<br>
. for the_ proportion of cytoplasmic proteins but also for the different profile of their outer membrane<br>
proteins. Of the 44 outer membrane proteins seen in DOMVs, only 32 were also seen in mOMVs.<br>
19 proteins seen in mOMVs from both MC58 and NZ98/254, but not in the DOMVs from NZ98/254,<br>
are listed in Table 4 below.<br>
A total cell extract of bacteria was prepared as follows: Bacterial cells were washed with PBS, and<br>
the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of 50 mM Tris-Hd pH 7.3 containing protease inhibitor<br>
cocktail (Roche Diagnostic).-2 mM EDTA and 2000 units of benzonase (Merck) were added, ceils<br>
were disrupted at 4Â°C with Basic Z 0.75V Model Cell Disrupter equipped with an "one shot head"<br>
(Constant System Ltd) by 2 cycles, and the unbroken cells were removed by centrirugationl0 min at<br>
8 000 x g at 4Â°C. This extract was analysed by SDS-PAGE, for comparison with a protein extract of<br>
the vesicles produced by ? GNA33 bacteria. As shown in Figure 13, the porins PorA and PorB<br>
(identities verified by MALDI-TOF sequencing) are seen in the wild-type bacterial outer membrane<br>
(lanes 2 &amp; 4) and also in the ? GNA33 knockout mutant's vesicles (lanes 3 &amp; 5). Moreover, these<br>
proteins are retained as stable trixners in the vesicles that do not dissociate into monomers in<br>
SDS-PAGE sample buffer with a low concentration of SDS (0.2%) under seminative conditions (no<br>
heating before electrophoresis; lanes 2 &amp; 3), but that do denature at 95Â°C (lanes 4 &amp; 5).<br>
LPS levels in detergent-extracted OMVs are typically 5-8% by weight, relative to protein [207].<br>
When tested with the Limulus assay, the endotoxin content of the vesicles was about twice as high as<br>
found in-detergent-extracted OMVs.<br>
Finally, the yield of vesicles in a growing culture was assessed. It was found that up to 20 mg of<br>
OMV-associated proteins could be recovered per gram of cells (wet weight) in culture supernatants<br>
of early exponentially growing cultures (OD620nm=0.5).<br>

Vesicle immunogenicity<br>
 As the ?7n&amp;4-derived vesicles are highly enriched in outer membrane proteins, their ability to elicit<br>
bactericidal antibodies capable of killing a broad panel of MenB clinical isolates was investigated.<br>
The strain chosen for the testing was 394/98. This strain was chosen because it is the strain from<br>
which the MeNZBâ„¢ OMV-based vaccine is prepared, thereby aiding a direct comparison of ?mltA-<br>
vesicles of the invention with OMVs prepared from the wild-type strain by typical prior art methods.<br>
 10 Î¼g of each type of vesicle was adsorbed to an aluminium hydroxide adjuvant (3mg/ml) and<br>
injected into mice 5-week old CD1 female mice (5-10 mice per group). The vesicles were given<br>
intraperitoneally on days 0 and 2 L Blood samples for-analysis were taken on day 34, and were tested<br>
for SBA against \ 5 different serogroup B strains corresponding to 11 different sub-types, including<br>
Â±e four major hypervirulent lineages, using pooled baby rabbit serum as the complement source.<br>
Serum bactericidal titers were defined as the serum dilution resulting in 50% decrease in colony<br>
forming uniis (CFU) per ml after 60 minutes incubation of bacteria with reaction mixture, compared<br>
to control CFU per ml at time 0. Typically, bacteria incubated with the negative control antibody in<br>
the presence of complement showed a 150 to 200% increase in CFU/ml during the 60 min<br>
incubation. Tilers were as follows, expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution yielding =-50%<br>
bacterial killing:<br><br>
/The results show that serum from ?mltA-derived vesicles were at least as bactericidally effective, and<br>
usually better than, OMVs prepared by chemical extraction, except for the homologous strain. The<br>
vesicles of the invention thus give much better cross-strain reactivity than typical OMVs. Moreover,<br>
talcing a 1:1024 dilution as the threshold for bactericidal efficacy, the vesicles of the invention were<br>
effective against 87% of the strains, whereas the artificial OMVs were only 40% effective.<br>
-31-<br><br>
WO 2006/046143	PCT/IB2005/003494<br>
Thus mOMVs are better than DOMVs for eliciting complement-dependent antibody killing when<br>
tested over a panel of 15 different serogroup B strains. The anti-mOMV mouse sera showed high<br>
 bactericidal activities against the homologous strain and against 14 additional strains, including i 0<br>
different PorA subtypes. In contrast, mouse sera raised against DOMVs show high bactericidal titers<br>
only against six MenB strains, belonging to two PorA subtypes. These results indicate that the<br>
protection of anti-mOMV sera was not only due to the elicitation of bactericidal antibodies against<br>
PorA, which is one of the most abundant outer membrane proteins and the most potent inducer of<br>
bactericidal antibodies, but also to other bactericidal antigens which in mOMVs are present in higher<br>
amounts than in DOMVs.<br>
Western blot<br>
To confirm  that the ?mltA-derived vesicles do contain conserved, protective antigens, ihey were run<br>
on an SDS-PAGE, iransferred onto a PDF ulier and immunobiotted using specific anti-sera against<br>
six proteins antigens previously shown to be protective and highly conserved, including l287J, '953',<br>
'741' (GNA1870) and 'NadA'.<br>
The vesicles were separated onto 10% acrylamide .SDS-PAGE gels employing a Mini-Protean H<br>
eiectrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad). After protein separation, gels were equilibrated with 48 mM<br>
Tris-PICi, 39 mM glyciae, pK 9.0,20% (v/V) nierhanoi and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane<br>
(Bio-Rad) using a Trans-Blotâ„¢ semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell. The nitrocellulose membranes<br>
 were blocked with 10% (w/v) dammed milk in PBS containing 0.2% (w/v) sodium azide.<br>
As shown in figure 5, all six proteins were abundant in the vesicles. In contrast, the same six proteins'<br>
were poorly represented in the DOMVs.<br>
In conclusion, the ?mltA-derived vesicles are predominantly constituted by outer membrane proteins,<br>
whereas DOMVs are heavily contaminated by cyloplasmic proteins. When used to immunize mice,<br>
sera raised against ?mltA-derived vesicles .showed a higher and wider strain coverage than DOMVs.<br>
Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coll<br>
A knockout strain of ExPEC CFT073 was prepared by isogenic deletion of the toIR gene, replacing it<br>
with a kanamycin resistance marker. The knockout strain was grown to OD600nm 0.4, and the culture<br>
was then ccntrifuged. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22Î¼m filter and the filtrate was<br>
prepciptated using TCA. The pellet was then resuspended in Tris buffer.<br>
The same growth and purification procedure was used for the parent's (rain, without the knockout,<br>
and SDS-PAGE analysis of the two final preparations is shown in Figure 16. The right-hand band is<br>
from the knockout srrain.and shows enrichment of several protein bands.<br>
Further toIR knockout ExPEC strains were prepared from strains DH5a, 536 and 1HE3034. Vesicles<br>
were prepared as before, and SDS-PAGE analysis of TCA precipitates is shown in Figure 17.<br>

The knockout mutant produces high amounts of vesicles, and these vesicles were subjected to<br>
proteomic analyses, including ID and 2D SDS-PAGE and tryptic digestion of surface-exposed<br>
proteins in the vesicles followed by sequence analysis of released peptides.<br>
It will be understood that the invention has been described by way of example only and modifications<br>
may be made whilst remaining within the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>

Knockout of the meningococcal mltA homolog gives bacteria that spontaneously release vesicles that are rich in immunogenic outer membrane proteins and that can elicit cross-protective antibody responses with higher bactericidal titres than OMVs prepared by normal production processes. Thus the invention provides a bacterium having a knockout mutation of its mltA gene. The invention also provides a bacterium, wherein the bacterium: (i) has a cell wall that includes peptidoglycan, and (ii) does not express a protein having the lytic transglycosylase activity of MltA protein. The invention also provides compositions comprising vesicles that, during culture of bacteria of the invention, are released into the culture medium.<br><br></td>
