PROCESS OF MAKING POLYMERIZABLE POLYOL  (ALLYL CARBONATE) COMPOSITIONS<br>
PPG INDUSTRIES OHIO,  INC.  of  3800 WEST  143RD STREET, CLEVELAND, OH 44111, U.S.A. a AMERICAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
POLYMERIZABLE POIYOL (ALLYL CARBONATE) COMPOSITIONS<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relator, to a polymerizable 5  composition.  More particularly, the present invention relates; to a polymerizable composi t.ion comprising polyol(allyI carbonate) monomer and n ur^rlvini; having at least tv/o allyl or substituted allyl groups.  The present invention relates also to polymerizar.es, e.g., lenses, obtained from the<br>
10  polymerizable compositions.<br>
Polymerizable organic romponi ci ons baaed on polyol allyl carbonate), particularly diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), and polymorizates obtained therefrom are well known in the art.  Polytnerizates of polymerizable .organic<br>
15  compositions based on homupolymerc of diethylenc glycol bis(allyl carbonate) possess excellent clarity, good flexibility and abrasion resistance.  Example:-; of appl i.c:&gt;t ionn for which such polymerisates may be used include, ophthalmic lenses, sunglasses, and iiuLumui. i ve and airur.-jft<br>
20  trancparencien.  It liar; been observed that tinting of<br>
po'lyriierizates prepared from such compositions by surface impregnation of dyes can, in certain instnncon, rem; It in an uneven tinting of the surface.  Such uneven tinting is referred to as tinting failure.<br>
25       When tinting failure occurs, it is often manitested as visually observable defects on the tinted surface(n) of the polymeri zatip, which arc commonly referred to nn "fern?;" oi. "moons."  In the case of tinted ophthalmic lensen, such as tinted ophthalmic lenses having n positive diopter, i.e., plus<br>
30  lenses, and non-corrective lenses, e.g., sunglanr.cr;, nueh<br>
tinting failure often result" in rejection and ncrapping or the tinted lens.  A iirjh.n.j.rm to t i.n( ing failure if. desiable<br><br><br>
in order to avoid the economic loss that results from the scrapping of lenses having tinting defects.<br>
United States Patent No.'s 4,994,208, 5,084,529, 5,110,881, 5,221,721, 5,230,978 and 5,246,630 describe 5  polymerizable compositions composed of polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer and at least 10 weight percent of aliphatic polyurethanes, the terminal portions of which contain allyl functional groups.  United States Patent No. 5,200,483 describes organic resin compositions containing polyol(allyl 0  carbonate) monomer and a mixture of aliphatic urethanes, the terminal portions of which contain allyl or acrylyl functional groups. ,, !<br>
It has now been discovered that cured polymerizates prepared from the polymerizable compositions of the present 5  invention are substantially free of tinting defects, for<br>
example, tinting defects referred to in the art as ferns or moons.  In accordance with the present invention there is provided a polymerizable composition comprising:<br>
(a) a major amount: of a radically polymei. izab.le 0  first monomer represented by the following general formula j,<br>
I R- (-O-C(O) -O-Rjj wherein R is a polyvalent residue of a polyol havinq at least two hydroxy group*;, R, is an allyl or substituted ally! group, 5  and i is a whole number from '?.   to 4; and<br>
[to)   a minor amount of a radically pol ymor izahl r. occond monomer roprom.uitnd by the following general formula II,<br><br><br>
wherein R3 is a polyvalent linking group that is frco of urethane linkages; R, is a residue of a material having a single hydroxy group and at least one allyl group, Rj being free of urethane linkages, acryloyl groups and methacryloyl 5  groups; and j is a number from 2 to 4, e.g., 2, 3 or 4.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, said r;ocond monomer (b) is present in said composition in an amount at least sufficient such that a polymorizate of said composition is, substantially free of tinting defects.<br>
10       The features that characterize the prenent invent, ion are pointed out with particularity in the claims, which are annexed to and form a part of this disclooure.  These and other features of the invention, its operating advantages and the specific Objects obtained by its use will be mote fully<br>
15  understood from the following detailed description and the accompanying illustrative drawing.<br>
Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, etc. used in the specification and claims<br>
20  are to be understood as modified in ail instances by the term "about."<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Figure 1 is a representation of a negative image of a 25  tinted lens having tinting defects.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In an embodiment of the present invention, the second monomer described with reference to genera J. forinuJa XX if; 30  present in the polymerizablc compositions in an amount at<br>
least sufficient such that polymerizates prepared from such componitiong am nubfitantiall y free of tinting defect?:. As used herein and in the claims, the term "tinting defects" and<br><br>
similar terms refer generally to a visually observable uneven distribution of dye over the surface of a tinted polymerizate, such as a tinted lens.  More particularly, tinting defects are often visually observable as lighter colored or untinted 5  surface patterns, sometimes in the form of ferns or moons. Tinting defects in the form of ferns can be Cur:t:li«r described with reference to Figure 1.  The tinted pol ymeri. 7.nte. 4 of Figure 1 is a tinted plus lens 11, prepared from diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate) monomer, and having<br>
10  tinting defects 15 thereon.  For purposes of illustration, the tinting defects 15 of Figure 1 arc shown an a negative im.ngo. As used herein, by "plus lens" is meant a lens having a positive (+) diopter, i.e., a lenu having a positive focal length or real focal point.  The tinting defects shown in the<br>
15  lens depicted in Figure 1 were observed in a lens having a plus five (+5) diopter,<br>
I Tinting defects in the form of moons (not shown in Figure 1) are typically observed as a series of concentric circles of varying tint strength on the surface of the tinted Jens.  In<br>
20  some instances a tinted lens will exhibit a combination of: both moon and fern type tinting defects.<br>
The occurrence of tinting defects with polyiner.izator; prepared from polyoMallyl carbonate) monomers is a largely statistical phenomenon.  Accordingly, in order to determine if<br>
25  a polymerizable composition can be used to prepare<br>
polymerizates that are "substantially free of tinting defects," more than one polymerizate, e.g., several lenses, should be prepared.  Optionally, a set of comparative pulymerlzatco may nlfjo be prepared under nlniilar mini i I i .MI.". ,<br>
JO "■.
 <br>
between 10 and 100 lenne.". are prepared to determine if they are substantially free of tinting defects.  Such a determination is described .in further detail in the Examples herein.  Typically, a set of polymerizates, e.g., 100 ophthalmic plus lenses, prepared from a polyinerizable composition according to tho pjewent inention, is conn i tiered to be substantially free of tinting defects if 10 percent or less, preferably 5 percent or less, and more preferably 0 percent of the tinted polymerizates have tinting defects, such<br>
10  as ferns.<br>
Second monomer (b) is present in the polymerizable composition of the present invention in a minor amount (e.g., from 0.1 percent by weight to 49 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the composition).  Typically, second<br>
15  monomer (b) is present in the composition of the instant invention in an amount of at least 0.1 percent by weight, 'preferably at least 0.2 percent by weight, and more preferably at least 0.3 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.  Second monomer (b) is also typically present.<br>
20  in the composition of the present invention in an amount of<br>
less than 10 percent by weight, preferably less than 5 percent by weight and more preferably less than 3 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.  The amount of second monomer (b) present in the composition of the present<br>
25  invention may range between any combination of these values,<br>
inclusive of the recited values, e.g., from 0.1 percent by<br>
weight to 10 percent by weight or from 0.3 percent by weight<br>
to 3 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
30       With reference to general formula II, second monomer (b) I is distinguishable from polyurethanes having terminal a.l lyl<br>
functional groups as described in, for example, United States<br>

5,236,978 and 5,246,630.  In general formula II, R, and K, are each free of urethane linkages, more particularly, R3 and R, are each free of internal urethane linkages.  As used herein and in the claims, the term "urethane linkage" is meant to 5  refer to the following structural linkage, -N(H) C(0)-o .  In the case when R2 is a residue of a polyisocyanate, second monomer (b) can be described as a polyisocyanate that is capped with the mono-hydroxy functional material of which R, is a residue.<br>
10       Depending on the method by which second monomer (b) i" prepared, R5 may be a residue of, for example, a polyisocyanate, i.e., a material having at least two isocyanate groups, or a polyamine, i.e., a material having at least two primary amine groups.  when the second monomer is<br>
15  prepared by capping a poly i !:ocy;uicit.
functional material of which Rn is a residue, R2 is n residue of a polyisocyanate.  The second monomer may also be prepared by first reacting the mono-hydroxy functional material of which R, is a residue with phosgene to form the corresponding<br>
20  chloroformate, which is then reacted with a polyamine, in which case Rr is a residue of a polyamine.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, R5 is a residue of a polyisocyanate having at least two isocyanate groups, and the polyisocyanate may be selected from aromaLic<br>
25  polyisocyanates, aliphatic polyisocyanates, cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates and mixtures thereof.  As used herein and in the claims, the term "polyisocyanate" is meant to be inclusive of dimers and trimers of polyisocyanates, for example, trimers of diisocyanates containing a core isocyanurnte ring.<br>

20  compositions of the present invention may be found in U.S. Patent No. 4,637,698 at column 3, linn 13 through column '&gt;, line 61.  That disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference, and is summarized above.<br>
As used in the present- description with reference to the<br>
25  radically polyinerizable monomer represented by general formula I, the term "polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer" and like names, e.g., diethylene glycol bis(allyl carbonate), is intended to mean and include the named monomers or prepolytners thereof and any related monomer or oligomer species contained therein.<br>
30       TlKi polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer is present in the<br>
polymerizabie composition of the present invention in a wnjor amount, e.g., from 51 percent by weight to 99.9 percent by-weight, based on the total weight of the polymeriznhln<br><br>
composition.  Typically, the polyol (al.ly.1 carbonate) monomer is present in the polymerizablo composition of the prencnt invention in an amount of at least 90 percent by weight, preferably at least 95 percent by weight, and more preferably 5  at least 97 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the polymerizable composition.  Also, the polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer is typically present in the composition in an amount of not greater than 9 9.9 percent by weight, preferably not greater than 99.8 percent by weight, and more<br>
10  preferably not greater than 99.7 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the polymerizable composition.  The polyol(allyl carbonate) monomer may be present in the composition of the present invention in an amount ranging between any combination of these values, inclusive of the<br>
15  recited values.<br>
Polymerization of the polymerizable composition of the present invention may be accomplished by adding to the composition an initiating amount of material capable of generating free radicals, such as organic peroxy compounds,<br>
20  i.e., an initiator.  Methods for polymerizing polyol(allyl<br>
carbonate) compositions are well known to the skilled artisan and any of those well known techniques may be used to polymerize the aforedescribed polymerizable compositions.<br>
Suitable examples of organic peroxy compounds, that may<br>
25  be used as initiators include: peroxymonocarbonate esters, such as tertiarybutylperoxy isopropyl carbonate; peroxydicarbonate estertj, cuch as di(2-ethylhoxyl) peroxydicarbpnate, di(secondary butyl) peroxydicarbonate and Uiisopropylperoxydicarbonate; diacylpcroxidon, aurli an 2,1-<br>
30  dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, isobutyryl peroxide, d«eanoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, propionyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, p-chlorobenzoyl peroxide; peroxyesters such as t-butylperoxy pivalate, t-butylperoxy<br><br>
octylate, and t-butylperoxyi nobutyrate,- rnethyJ.ethylker.one peroxide, acetylcyclohexane nulfonyl peroxide, and azobisisobutyronitrile.  Preferred initiators are those that do not discolor the resulting polymerizate.  A preferred initiator is diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate.<br>
The amount of initiator used to initiate and polymerize the polymerizable compositions of the present invention may vary and will depend on the particular initiator used.  Only that amount that is required to initiate and cuntain the<br>
10  polymerization reaction is required, i.e., an initiating amount.  With respect to the preferred peroxy compound, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, typically between 2.0 and 5.0 parts of that initiator per 100 parts of the polymerizable organic composition (phm) may be used.  More usually, between<br>
15  2.5 and 4.0 phm is used to initiate the polymerization.  The amount of initiator and the consequent cure cycle should be adequate to produce a polymerizate having a 15 second Barcol hardness of at least 1, preferably, at least 4, e.g., from 4 to 35.  Typically, the cure cycle involves heating the<br>
20  polymerizable organic composition in the presence of the<br>
initiator from room temperature to SS^C over a period of from 15 hours to 30 hours.<br>
Various conventional additives may be incorporated into the polymerizable composition of the present invention.  Such<br>
25  conventional additives may include light stabilizers, heat<br>
stabilizers, ultraviolet light abKoibers, mold release agents, &gt; pigments and flexibilizing additives that are not radically polymerizable, e.g., alkoxylated phenol benzoates and poly(alkylene glycol) dibenzoates.  Conventional additives arc<br>
3 0  typically present in the compositions of the present invention in amounts totaling lens than 10 percent by weight, more typically less than 5 percent by weight, and commonly lens<br><br>
than 3 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the polymerizable composition.<br>
Polymerizates obtained from polymerization of polymerizable organic compositions of the present invention 5  will be solid, transparent and substantially free of tinting delects.  Solid aiLlcleu Uml may be prepared liom t IK-polymerizable compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, optical lenses, such as  piano and ophthalmic lenses, sun lenses or sunglasses, windows, 10  automotive transparencies, e.g., windshields, sidelights and backlights, and aircraft transparencies, etc.<br>
The present invention is more particularly described in the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative only, since numerous modifications and variations therein will<br>
15  be apparent to those skilled in the art.  Unless otherwise<br>
i<br>
i specified, all parts and percentages are by weight.<br>

Cast Lena Examples<br>
The casting compositions A - C were each mixed at room temperature and injected separately into glass lens molds used to prepare circular lenses having a +5 diopter and an outer rim diameter of 6.5 cm.  Twenty (20) lens molds were filled at; a time and their contents polymerized using the same cuie cycle.  The cure cycle used involved heating the molds in an electric forced air oven in stages from 48 °C to 85 °C over a period of 18 hours, followed by cooling to and holding at 60°C until demolding of the lenses.<br>
The cast lenses were then tinted by imbibing them with a black dye.  An aqueous tinting solution of 1 part BPl" Molecular Catalytic™ Black Dye, commercially available from Brain Power Incorporated, and 10 parts deionized water was heated to and held at a temperature of 94°C - 95°C.  The lenses cast from casting compositions A - C were fully immersed in the heated dye solution for a period of 5 minutes, after which they were thoroughly rinsed with deionized water. The tinted lenses were evaluated for tinting defects, the reBulte of which are summarized in Table 1.<br><br>
TAMI..K   1 Evaluation of  TinLud Lenooa<br><br>
