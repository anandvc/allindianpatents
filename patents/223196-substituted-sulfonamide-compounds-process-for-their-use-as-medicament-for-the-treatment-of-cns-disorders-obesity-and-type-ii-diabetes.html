The present invention relates to substituted sulfonamide compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and to the use of the compounds for the prophylaxis and treatment of medical conditions relating to obesity, type II diabetes, and CNS disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Obesity is a condition characterized by an increase in body fat content resulting in excess body weight above accepted norms. Obesity is the most important nutritional disorder in the western world and represents a major health problem in all industrialized countries. This disorder leads to increased mortality due to increased incidences of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, digestive disease, respiratory disease, cancer and type II diabetes. Searching for compounds, which reduce body weight has been going on for many decades. One line of research has been activation of serotoninergic systems, either by direct activation of serotonin receptor subtypes or by inhibiting serotonin reuptake. The exact receptor subtype profile required is however not known.<br>
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT), a key transmitter of the peripheral and central nervous system, modulates a wide range of physiological and pathological functions, including anxiety, sleep regulation, aggression, feeding and depression. Multiple serotonin receptor subtypes have been identified and cloned. One of these, the 5-HTg receptor, was cloned by several groups in 1993 (Ruat, M. et al. (1993) Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun.193: 268-276; Sebben, M. et al. (1994) NeuroReport 5: 2553-2557). This receptor is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase and displays affinity for antidepressants such as clozapine. Recently, the effect of 5-HTg antagonist and 5-HT6 antisense oligonucleotides to<br><br>
reduce food intake in rats has been reported (Bentley, J.C. et al. (1999) Br J Pharmac. Suppl. 126, P66; Bentley, J.C. et al. (1997) J. Psychopharmacol. Suppl. A64,255).<br>
Compounds with enhanced affinity and selectivity for the 5-HT6 receptor have been t     identified, e.g. in WO 00/34242 and by Isaac, M. et al. (2000) 6-Bicyclopiperazinyl-l-arylsulfonylindoles and 6-Bicyclopiperidinyl-l-arylsulfonylindoles derivatives as novel, potent and selective S-HT6 receptor antagonists. Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters 10: 1719-1721 (2000).<br>

METHODS FOR PREPARATION<br>
The compounds according to the invention (Tables I, II, IV,V, VI) can be prepared starting from halo-nitro substituted bicyclic aromatic rings by base (potassium carbonate) catalyzed aromatic nucleophilic substitution of a halogen in the desired position of the central bicyclic ring with the diamine of choice (R3). Reduction of a nitro group properly positioned on the central bicyclic ring by Raney-Ni catalyzed reaction leads to the aniline that is substituted further by sulfonylation with the alkyl- or aryl-sulfonylchloride of choice (R1-SO2-CI). Scheme 1 and Scheme 3<br>
The compounds according to the invention (Tables III) can be prepared starting from fluoro substituted bicyclic aromatic rings in which the sulfonylchloride functionality is introduced by acid catalyzed sulfonylation. The sulfonyl group is reacted further with anilines of choice (R -NH2). The diamine group (R3) is introduced by base catalyzed aromatic nucleophilic substitution. Scheme 2<br>
The compounds according to the invention (Tables VII) can be prepared starting from iodo substituted bicyclic aromatic rings. The diamine group (R3) is introduced by Palladium catalysed nucleophilic substitution. Reduction of a nitro group properly positioned on the central bicyclic ring by Raney-Ni catalyzed reaction leads to the aniline that is substituted<br><br>
further by sulfonylation with the alkyl- or aryl-sulfonylchloride of choice (R1-SO2-Cl). Scheme 4<br>

BIOLOGICAL TESTS<br>
The ability of a compound according to the invention to bind a 5-HT6 receptor, and to be pharmaceutically  useful, can be determined using in vivo and in vitro assays known in the art.<br>
(a) 5-HT6 Intrinsic Activity Assay<br>
Antagonists to the 5-HT6 receptor were characterized by measuring inhibition of 5-<br>
HT induced increase in cAMP in HEK 293 cells expressing the human 5-HT6 receptor (see<br>
i<br>
Boess et al. (1997) Neuropharmacology 36: 713-720). Briefly, HEK293/5-HT6 cells were seeded in polylysine coated 96-well plates at a density of 25,000 / well and grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) (without phenol-red) containing 5% dialyzed Foetal Bovine Serum for 48 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The medium was then aspirated and replaced by 0.1 ml assay medium (Hanks Balance Salt Solution containing 20 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After addition of test substances, 50 fil dissolved in assay medium, the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The medium was again aspirated and the cAMP content was determined using a radioactive cAMP kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, BIOTRAK RPA559). The potency of antagonists was quantified by determining the concentration that caused 50% inhibition of 5-HT (at [5-HT]= 8 times EC50) evoked increase in cAMP, using the formula Ki=IC5o/(l+[5HTI/EC5o).<br>
The compounds in accordance with the invention have a selective affinity to 5-HTg receptors with Kj values between 0.5 nM and 5 JIM, The compounds show good selectivity for 5-HTi* 5-HT2„ 5-HT2,, 5-HT2b, 5-HT2c.<br>
(b) In vivo assay of reduction of food intake<br>
For a review on serotonin and food intake, see Blundell, J.E. and Halford, J.C.G. (1998) Serotonin and Appetite Regulation. Implications for the Pharmacological Treatment of Obesity. CNS Drugs 9:473-495.<br><br>
Obese (ob/ob) mouse is selected as the primary animal model for screening as this mutant mouse consumes high amounts of food resulting in a high signal to noise ratio. To further substantiate and compare efficacy data, the effect of the compounds on food consumption is also studied in wild type (C57BI76J) mice. The amount of food consumed during 15 hours of infusion of compounds is recorded.<br>
Male mice (obese C57BU6JBom-Lepob and lean wild-type C57Bl/6JBom; Bomholtsgaard, Denmark) 8-9 weeks with an average body weight of 50 g (obese) and 25 g (lean) are used in all the studies. The animals are housed singly in cages at 23±1°C, 40-60 % humidity and have free access to water and standard laboratory chow. The 12/12-h light/dark cycle is set to lights off at 5 p.m. The animals are conditioned for at least one week before start of study.<br>
The test compounds are dissolved in solvents suitable for each specific compound such as cyclodextrin, cyclodextrin/methane sulfonic acid, polyethylene glycol/methane sulfonic acid, saline. Fresh solutions are made for each study. Doses of 30, 50 and 100 mg kg^day*1 are used. The purity of the test compounds is of analytical grade.<br>
The animals are weighed at the start of the study and randomized based on body weight. Alzet osmotic minipumps (Model 200ID; infusion rate 8 µl/h) are used and loaded essentially as recommended by the Alzet technical information manual (Alza Scientific Products, 1997; Teeuwes and Yam, 1976). Continuous subcutaneous infusion with 24 hours duration is used. The minipumps are either filled with different concentrations of test compounds dissolved in vehicle or with only vehicle solution and maintained in vehicle pre-warmed to 37°C (approx. Ih). The minipumps are implanted subcutaneously in the neck/back region under short acting anesthesia (metofane/enflurane). This surgical procedure lasts approximately 5 min. It takes about 3 h to reach steady state delivery of die compound.<br>
The weight of the food pellets are measured at 5 p.m. and at 8 p. m. for two days before (baseline) and one day after the implantation of the osmotic minipumps. The weigh-in is performed with a computer assisted Mettler Toledo PR 5002 balance. Occasional spillage<br><br>
is corrected for. At the end of the study the animals are killed by neck dislocation and trunk blood sampled for later analysis of plasma drug concentrations.<br>
The plasma sample proteins are precipitated with methanol, centrifuged and the f    supernatant is transferred to HPLC vials and injected into the liquid chromatography /mass spectrometric system. The mass spectrometer is set for electrospray positive ion mode and Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM with the transition m/z 316 =&gt; 221). A linear regression analysis of the standards forced through the origin is used to calculate the concentrations of the unknown samples.<br>
Food consumption for 15 hours is measured for the three consecutive days and the percentage of basal level values is derived for each animal from the day before and after treatment. The values are expressed as mean ± SD and ± SEM from eight animals per dose group. Statistical evaluation is performed by Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA using the percent basal values. If statistical significance is reached at the level of p
The compounds according to the invention show an effect in the range of 50-200 mg/kg.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
