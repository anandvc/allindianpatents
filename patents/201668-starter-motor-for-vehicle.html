2.	Description of the Background Art<br>
of the accompanying drawings, Generally, as shown in Figure 1/a conventional starter motor includes a<br>
front bracket 1a, a yoke 1, an armature assembly 3 engaged to a shaft 2 in the<br>
interior of a rear bracket 1b, a stator 4 which is fixed in an inner surface of the<br>
yoke 1 in a surrounding of the armature assembly 3, a brush assembly 5 for<br>
supplying a power to the armature assembly,  an internal gear assembly 6<br>
.2<br><br>
connected with a front end of the shaft 2, and an over running clutch 7 connected with the internal gear assembly 6 for transferring a driving force to a pinion.<br>
In addition, a housing 9 in which a magnet switch 8 having a hook 80 which reciprocates based on an electric operation is provided in an upper front bracket 1a of the starter motor 1, and a lever 20 which moves the pinion for starting an engine is provided in a front portion of the magnet switch 8 and is interworks with the hook 80 of the magnet switch 8.<br>
The process for engaging the housing 9 with the magnet switch 8 to the front bracket 1a of the motor may be classified into two types.<br>
First, the lever is first inserted into the front bracket, and then the magnet switch is engaged. In this method, the housing including the magnet switch is engaged to the front bracket, and the end portion of the hook of the magnet switch is engaged to the end portion of the inserted lever. Second, in a state that the hook of the magnet switch is first engaged to the lever, the magnet switch housing is fixed to the front bracket using a bolt or a clamping method.<br>
However, in the case of the structure in which the housing is assembled in the above manner, it is possible to easily insert the hook of the magnet switch into the level However, as shown in Figure 2, a step portion 90 is formed in the front side of the housing 9 for an engagement with the front bracket 1a, when the hook 80 of the magnet switch is assembled to the lever 20, the front end of the magnet switch housing 9 may be interfered by a plunger portion 10a of the front bracket 1a,<br>
2A<br><br>
so that the front end of the hook 80 may be caught by the lever 20, whereby it is impossible to effectively engage the housing 9.<br>
In addition, when the housing is engaged in the above manner, in a state that the lever 20 is engaged to the magnet switch hook 80, since the magnet switch housing 9 must be engaged to the front bracket 1a, the number of processes is increased, so that the fabrication cost is increased, and the construction of the system is complicated.<br>
In a state that the housing is operatively assembled to the front bracket, in order to fix the same, the engagement is implemented using a bolt or clamping member. Here, in the case of using a bolt, a plurality of bolts are engaged step by step, so that it is impossible to implement a desired mass production of the product. In addition, in the case of using a clamping member, the bolts are not needed, so that it is advantages in a view of the mass production and cost, but an electrical resistance due to a durability and motor vibration of a product are high, the reliability of the product is decreased.<br>

A magnet core is fixed to the partition wall 34a using a bolt for implementing a magnet switch operation. A boss portion 38a is protruded from the engaging hole 36a formed in the partition wall 34a for fixing the magnet core. Therefore, it is possible to provide a sufficient length of the bolt, so that a supporting force of the<br>
9<br><br>
magnet core is increased.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the magnet switch housing 30 may be fixed based on a cocking work in an outer portion of the housing in insertion with the partition wall 34b therein for supporting the magnet switch 40 in the inner center portion. In addition, the bolt engaging hole 36b which is processed by a burling 38b work for fixing the magnet core which is provided for an operation of the magnet switch is formed in the partition wall 34b. Therefore, it is possible to implement a sufficient engaging distance of the bolt, so that a supporting force that the magnet core is fixedly attached to the partition wall is increased.<br>
In addition, as shown in Figure 6 of the third embodiment of the present invention, the adapter 30d and the magnet housing 30c are separated with the partition walls 34c, and 34d, so that it is possible to implement a tight heat insertion engagement between the partition walls 34c and 34d. Therefore, it is possible to implement the same effects.<br>
As described above, in the housing engaging structure of the starter motor for a vehicle according to the present invention, it is possible to implement an easier assembling of the magnet switch and the lever in a finished assembling line of the starter motor through a shape transformation of the housing, so that it is possible to decrease a product fabrication cost.
