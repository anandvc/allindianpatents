FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to communication in general and communication between normal persons and<br>
persons with hearing and speech impairment in particular. The invention discloses communication<br>
method and apparatus for the dumb.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART:<br>
Persons with hearing or speech deficiency are quite common and are encountered everywhere. Such<br>
shortcomings may be inborn or congenital, or they may develop at a later stage in life. Usually, a child<br>
born deaf cannot learn any language and in consequence becomes dumb too. That is why we<br>
commonly come across deaf and dumb persons.<br>
For persons who develop hearing impairment at a later stage in life, several devices, commonly called<br>
"hearing aids" are known in the prior art. Other devices are known to help people with certain types of<br>
speech deficiency. But ther is no apparatus or method known in the prior art which enable a person<br>
who is dumb to communicate with a normal human being. The method and apparatus in accordance<br>
with the present invention is expected to help such people communicate with normal human beings.<br>
The term "dumb" used in this specification will mean deaf and dumb persons, who are usually born<br>
deaf. There are many institutions today which impart training to such persons and many skills are<br>
learnt by them including reading and writing ability. Such persons can communicate with one another<br>
quite extensively with sign language. But a normal person will be able to communicate with them only<br>
if he or she masters this sign language.<br>
It is an established fact that most of the dumb persons possess high levels of intelligence and higher<br>
mental and physical capabilities. But most of it goes unutilized due to their impediments in hearing<br>
and speaking.<br>
The invention is thought to help a large section of dumb persons who are literate. They can hope to<br>
receive acceptance within the mainstream and mankind at large too can utilize their intellectual and<br>
other resources much better.<br>
FR 2882848 discloses that an electronic device with digital or other functionality to facilitate<br>
communication, exchange of information and otherwise, between the deaf and dumb, deaf to the<br>
outside world and vice versa, or between people of different languages is in the form and double<br>

alphanumeric keyboard, is<br><br>
characterized in that the keyboard is provided with keys having on their surface embossed or not, a<br>
double alphabet language signs or finger spelling and any conventional alphabet, and that the device<br>
includes a bilingual electronic dictionary, sign language and any conventional language, and it has a<br>
translation module for translating sign language in any conventional language, or vice versa, or<br>
between any two classical languages and in that it incorporates an image display system, a memory,<br>
the alphabet of deaf, or other classic alphabet alphabet, numbers Arab and other punctuation, a<br>
translation module keys, the concept is transferable to electronic devices or electrical.<br>

OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An object of the invention is to enable dumb persons to communicate with normal persons and<br>
vice versa.<br>
Another object of the invention is to facilitate the acceptance of dumb person into the<br>
mainstream.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to enable such persons to communicate with anybody with<br>
ease.<br>
A further object of the invention is to enable normal human beings communicate with the dumb<br>
without acquiring skill in sign language.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention discloses a method of a hand held communication apparatus to aid an audibly and<br>
speech impaired individual comprising of a keyboard means; a speaker means; a processor to<br>
process the characters of input text and converting the same to its corresponding sound signals;<br>
an input means to input environmental sound, which is further measured to determine the sound<br>
decibel; means to modify the converted sound decibels and incrementing the said decibels by a<br>
constant value, to deliver the message appearing on the screen at a higher pitch compared to the<br>
ambient noise level, thereby providing a vibrating signal to the user confirming delivery of said<br>
speech.<br>
Further the present invention discloses a method of a communication method to aid an audibly<br>
and speech impaired individual comprising the steps of inputting text by means of keyboard or<br>
template; selecting designated key to translate the generated speech into a preferable language<br>
actuating designated key to perform the task of processing text to speech and thereby delivering<br>
the speech via speaker means;<br>
The benefit of the invention can be reaped by any dumb person who has the ability to read and<br>
actuate desired buttons on the device by finger. This is a prerequisite for the invention to be<br>
performed.<br>
In the following description, the user, a dumb person meeting the above criteria has been<br>
assumed to be a male for simplicity. But the invention is equally applicable to females and<br>
children as well.<br><br>
In accordance with the invention, such a person will have the special apparatus,<br>
also called device here, with him, like a mobile phone. When he wants to<br>
communicate with a normal person nearby, he will first switch on the apparatus<br>
and then type out the sentence he wants to convey using the key pad of the<br>
device. This sentence will then be displayed on the LCD screen of the device.<br>
The user can edit the typed matter to his liking. Once he is satisfied, he presses<br>
a designated key. The software embedded in the device then transforms the<br>
typed matter into corresponding human speech and the speaker of the device<br>
then gives out the typed matter in audible speech form. The normal person,<br>
standing close within a radius of upto 20 mts to the user, can hear the spoken<br>
words as if it is the dumb person speaking. A one-way communication is so<br>
completed.<br>
A normal person will have to communicate his answer either by writing it down<br>
or by gestures or sign language.<br>
This will complete the cycle of communication, which is a two-way process.<br>
Thus, the method in accordance with the invention will remove the main obstacle<br>
faced by the dumb, that being his inability to communicate with the normal<br>
world.<br><br>
The apparatus to be used by the dumb is the vital component in performance of<br>
the invention. As mentioned earlier, it looks like a mobile phone handset, but is<br>
very different from such a handset. It has a rechargeable battery as commonly<br>
known, to be charged from an external electrical outlet, and a special key board.<br>
Apart from the alphabet keys, it is provided with several special function keys.<br>
The apparatus has a built in speaker with considerably higher output as<br>
compared to a telephone handset earpiece, because the speech emitted by it<br>
must be audible to a person with normal hearing located in the near proximity.<br>
The device has appropriate amplifier and driver circuits to achieve this. Volume<br>
control facility is also foreseen, to be used in varying conditions like indoors,<br>
outdoors on a busy street etc.<br>
The apparatus is provided with several other unique features. A voice pitch<br>
modulation circuit is incorporated with selection option. By selecting the proper<br>
pitch, one can obtain male/female/child voice from the speaker. This selection<br>
will be done by a person with normal hearing and will match the sex/age of the<br>
dumb person using the apparatus. This innovation is provided to make the<br>
output of the device appear more natural. For example, when a dumb child<br>
operates it, the output speech should preferably not be in an adult male voice,<br><br>
but in a child-like voice. The same holds true for a female or male user too.<br>
Another selection is provided for the choice of language. The user will be in<br>
aposition to choose the language in two stages. In the first stage, he can choose<br>
it for typing in and display purposes. In the second stage, he can choose the<br>
language in which the device will deliver the words. In usual circumstances, the<br>
same language is chosen for both stages. For example, he may type in English<br>
"Which way to Rly station?" and the apparatus will speak out these words in<br>
English.<br>
Another fall-out of this innovation will be that although the user may type and<br>
read in a language known to him, for example Bengali, he may choose to deliver<br>
the spoken words in say, Hindi, a language he is not familiar with. This feature<br>
will effectively make this apparatus an automatic translating tool also, and can<br>
make the user travel across various language zones and be in communication<br>
with his immediate surroundings, without his knowing the local language.<br>
The apparatus is provided with "hot keys" which will cut the process short to<br>
make quick vocal communication. These may be "Yes/No". "My name is...", "Your<br>
name?, "I am verbally disabled, but can talk with this device", or similar ones.<br>
Such prearranged or edited messages, called templates, will be stored<br><br>
Another innovative feature of the invention is that the apparatus is programmed to display a set<br>
of stored words by way of predictive text input as soon as the user starts typing, depending upon<br>
the first few letters typed by him. In most occasions, the right word will be displayed. The user<br>
then needs to merely select the right word instead of typing the whole word, to save time and<br>
effort.<br>
The idea of the invention is to make communication as simple and fast as possible.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the front view of the hand held communication device in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the flow chart of processing text to speech.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the flow chart of alarming user at high decibels.<br>
The invention will now be described in further details with help of the accompanying drawing. The<br>
following description relates to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. There can be several<br>
other embodiments of the invention, all of which are deemed to be covered by this description.<br><br>
invention, all of which are deemed to be covered by this description.<br>
The apparatus (100) in accordance with the invention is a hand-held device with<br>
LCD display screen (2) having high resolution. The screen will be illuminated<br>
during use, as is commonly known with the mobile telephone handsets. It is<br>
provided with an English language keyboard which may be a "QWERTY"<br>
keyboard, for example. However, suitable software embedded in the device will<br>
enable the user to use the same keyboard to type a speech in any selected<br>
language.<br>
The apparatus is provided with three language options. They are<br>
International/National/Regional. The languages may be English/Hindi/Bengali for<br>
example. The user will advantageously use this selection to communicate with<br>
people of any region.<br>
As described above, the apparatus gives out messages in speech form. These<br>
messages should be audible to the person for whom they are meant. For this<br>
purpose, the output decibel level of the device should be considerably higher<br>
than the ambient decibel level.<br><br>
To ensure this, the apparatus incorporates a built-in sound sensor (22), which is<br>
maintained in continuously switched-on mode. The apparatus will thus assess<br>
the level of ambient sound and adjust its own volume at a considerably higher<br>
level, so that the output speech messages are distinctly heard by a normal<br>
person. For example, when the device is operated on a railway station or street,<br>
its output decibel level will be automatically adjusted to a much higher level than<br>
when it is operated within an enclosure which is much quieter.<br>
The device has a vibrator with variable frequency of vibration as well as a<br>
plurality of colored LED lamps (23) to generate different vibrating and light<br>
emitting alarm signals.<br>
A continuous high frequency vibration associated with flashing of several red LED<br>
lamps (23) is foreseen for occasions when the built-in sound sensor senses<br>
sound of about 80 dcbl and above. This alarm is designed to warn the user, a<br>
deaf and dumb person, that there is extraordinarily loud noise in the vicinity.<br>
Such conditions are normally dangerous ones, and the user must look around to<br>
take possible evasive action, much like a normal person being alerted by a loud<br>
bang or commotion.<br><br>
An intermittent type vibration of a lower frequency along with lighting up of<br>
fewer blue LED lamps is generated as an alarm to indicate ambient sound levels<br>
of 40-70 dcbl. This will be the case when a person calls attention of the user in a<br>
loud voice. The user will then look around to locate the source of the sound. But<br>
this alarm is not a panic situation alarm.<br>
A third type of alarm will comprise of short duration normal frequency vibration<br>
with lighting up of green LED lamps. This alarm is generated when the sound<br>
sensor detects ambient sound in the range 10 to 45 dcbl. This alarm will indicate<br>
to the deaf user that there is conversation taking place in his vicinity.<br>
There can be many more types of alarm to convey to the user the existence of<br>
other conditions in his vicinity.<br>
The apparatus incorporates a built-in speaker (21) driven by suitable amplifier<br>
and driver circuits so that distinct and loud speech output is delivered, which<br>
should be audible to a person with normal hearing upto 20 meters from the<br>
device. In addition to the automatic adjustment of the output volume with the<br>
help of the sound sensor described above, provision for manual adjustment of<br>
the output volume is also made through key 20.<br><br>
The apparatus houses a wireless communication equipment which enables<br>
sending and receiving text messages to and from similar devices located within<br>
about 10m radius. This enables such handicapped persons located nearby and<br>
using similar apparatus to communicate with each other. This facility will be<br>
available without the help of any mobile telephone service provider.<br>
The apparatus is powered by a rechargeable lithium battery, which can provide<br>
about 16 hours continuous service between chargings. The battery is commonly<br>
used in mobile handsets and hence is well known in the art. A battery charger<br>
suitable for charging the battery from domestic electric outlet is separately<br>
provided.<br>
The device has an in-built clock and calendar which will display day and date and<br>
time on a continuous basis and will be updated automatically.<br>
The apparatus incorporates several softwares to support selected language<br>
display from conventional keyboard, text to speech conversion, text translation,<br>
automatic volume level adjustment, synthesized speech quality assurance,<br>
automatic day/date/time indication and updating, battery charge level indication,<br>
alarm generation etc.<br><br>
The communication apparatus for the dumb in accordance with the invention is<br>
provided with a plurality of function keys. It is switched on or off with power key<br>
(1). LCD display screen (2) has high resolution, and will display the letters or<br>
words typed or selected by the user. Talk key (3) is actuated by the user for<br>
converting the words displayed on screen (2) into audible human speech form,<br>
which are emanated from loud speaker (21). Stop key (5) is provided for<br>
stopping the process at any time. Wireless connection key (6) is actuated when<br>
the user desires to communicate with a similar apparatus in the vicinity by<br>
means of text messages which are transmitted when message sending key (17)<br>
is operated. Template key (9) is used to recall a set of pre-edited and stored<br>
short messages to the screen. Translator key (12) is used to select the language<br>
option. It is the language in which the selected message will be delivered by the<br>
speaker.<br>
The apparatus comprises an emergency key (14), which, when actuated, will<br>
override all ongoing functions at any time and give out a loud and shrill short<br>
S.O.S. speech in the form of 'HELP" or 'SAVE ME". This feature is foreseen to<br>
enable the user who is dumb to call attention of anybody when he is in distress.<br>
The emergency or S.O.S. key (14) is foreseen to be provided with red<br>
fluorescent color to make it stand out amongst other keys even in reduced<br>
illumination.<br><br>
The apparatus has a manual volume control option which can be operated<br>
through keys (20). Voice Modulation key (19) is used to select the appropriate<br>
voice (male/female/child) in which speech will be delivered by the apparatus.<br>
A set of LED lights (23) in red/blue/green colors is provided on the apparatus for<br>
visual alarm indication.<br>
The apparatus (100) has an auto sound sensor (22) for automatic adjustment of<br>
the output volume of the loud speaker (21) to be above that of the ambient<br>
noise level, but the manual volume control keys (20) can override the volume<br>
automatically set by the device.<br>
It has a plurality of other keys for letters, numbers, spacing, menu, control, enter<br>
and similar functions normally encountered in a computer keyboard.<br>
The communication method for the deaf and dumb in accordance with the<br>
invention uses the apparatus described above. The method is now presented.<br>
The user switches on the apparatus (100) by means of power key (1). As the<br>
user is dumb, which is assumed to mean a deaf and dumb person, the apparatus<br>
should be pre-set to the appropriate voice (male/female/child) through voice<br>
modulation key (19) by a person with normal hearing. The user will have to<br><br>
select the appropriate language option through translator key (12). In doing so,<br>
he chooses the language in which speech is delivered by the apparatus. The<br>
language options are "International/National/Regional" which could mean<br>
languages English/Hindi/Bengali for example. If this option is not exercised, the<br>
apparatus will select "Regional" as its speech language by default. As mentioned<br>
earlier, this facility enables the user to use the apparatus as a translating device,<br>
by means of which he can communicate with people in a different language than<br>
his regional language. For example, a user familiar with Bengali as regional<br>
language can communicate in Hindi or English, even if he is not conversant with<br>
these languages.<br>
When the user wishes to communicate, he has to write the words he wants to<br>
communicate on the display screen (2) of the apparatus. This can be done by<br>
using a plurality of keys meant for typing letters, numbers, space, shift etc". For<br>
speeding up the process of writing the text, the apparatus is provided with<br>
predictive text input facility. The user also has the option of using the stored pre-<br>
edited messages or "templates". He will recall the templates through template<br>
key (9) and select the desired one. If he can use a template, his time and effort<br>
in typing a message are saved.<br><br>
Once the message is on the screen, he will actuate talk key (3). The apparatus will deliver the<br>
message displayed on screen (2) in human speech form through loud speaker (21).<br>
If the user wants to communicate with other persons in the vicinity who have similar apparatus,<br>
he will actuate wireless connection key (6). He will then type but the message he wants to<br>
communicate to the similar apparatus present in the vicinity in the usual way described earlier.<br>
Then he will actuate wireless message sending key (17). The message will then be transmitted as<br>
a text message, and will not be delivered as a speech message by the apparatus. The message<br>
will then be received by all similar apparatus operating in the vicinity within a radius of 10 m. The<br>
users of similar apparatus can thus exchange text messages between one another. This feature<br>
will not necessiate any help from any mobile phone service provider, and thus will not involve any<br>
additional expenditure.<br>
The above said whole operation may be better explained if elaborated with the help of flow<br>
diagram processes as shown in Fig 2 and 3.<br>
Fig. 2 is a flow diagram depicting the steps of processing a text data to speech form. The<br>
software application in the device receives the text from the user which after the usual sound<br>
correction and pitch correction process is stored in a buffer. Each characters of the text are then<br>
searched in the prestored sound library for its corresponding sound code and again stored in a<br>
buffer. Now according to the embodiments of present invention, environmental sound is taken as<br>
input to determine its decibel level, in accordance to which the connected sound signals are<br>
fetched from the buffer and are modified and incremented by a constant value to deliver the text<br>
inputted speech at a higher decibel compared to ambient noise level. Now the user alarming<br>
means as claimed in claim 2 is explained in flow chart of Fig.3. In Fig. 3, the service application<br>
software of the device intakes continuous environmental sound and simultaneously displays its<br>
details on the screen. Now, depending on the ambient sound pressure level (SPL), a threshold<br>
value is pre set which again may be adjusted and altered situation wise.<br>
The device compares the ambient SPL value with the threshold value and when the SPL value<br>
exceeds the threshold value at different varying conditions, module generates a alarm by<br>
vibrating and blinking the screen with varying intensities, depending on the said conditions.<br><br>
