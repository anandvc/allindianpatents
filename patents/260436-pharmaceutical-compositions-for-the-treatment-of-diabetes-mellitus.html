COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and rulel3)<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
"Fixed dose combination of Hydroxychloroquine with antidiabetic drugs for the<br>
treatment of diabetes mellitus"<br><br><br><br>
2. APPLICANT(S):<br>
(a) NAME: IPCA LABORATORIES LIMITED<br>
(b)NATIONALITY: Indian Company incorporated under the Indian Companies ACT, 1956<br>
(c) ADDRESS: 48, Kandivli Industrial Estate, Charkop, Kandivli (West), Mumbai-400 067, Maharashtra, India.<br>
3. PREAMBLE To THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation comprising fixed dose combination of hydroxychloroquine with antidiabetic drugs such as sulphonylureas, biguanides and thiazolidinediones. In particular, it relates to a method to treat diabetes mellitus using the said pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a common disorder associated with high morbidity and mortality. In developing countries its incidence is steadily increasing due to rapid changes in lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes affects up to 10% of all adults in the general population and up to 20% of people over age 65, and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular, eye, kidney, and nerve disease. (National Institutes of Health, NIH Publication No.95-1468, 1995, pp.47-68.)<br>
A wide range of antidiabetic agents with different mechanisms of action can be used to treat diabetes. Sulphonylureas and biguanides have been mainstay of therapy in diabetes mellitus.<br>
However, although oral monotherapy is often initially successful, it is associated with a high secondary failure rate, which contributes to the development of long term diabetes complications resulting from persistent hyperglycemia. (Am J Med. 2000 Apr 17; 108 Suppl6a:15S-22S.)<br>
Accumulating evidence suggests that combination therapy using oral antidiabetic agents with different mechanisms of action may be highly effective in achieving and maintaining target blood glucose levels. Such combination therapy offers the prospects of enhanced glycaemic control, fewer adverse effects and better outcomes.<br>
2<br><br>
The best studied combination is that of sulphonylurea plus metformin, a therapeutic approach that addresses both underlying defects in the disorder: insulin deficiency and insulin resistance.<br>
Sulphonylureas act by binding to sulphonylurea receptors on pancreatic p-cells, leading to increased secretion of insulin. Possible mechanism of actions of metformin includes inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis by decreasing hepatic insulin resistance, delay in the absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract and an increase in insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake into cells.<br>
Often patients on combination therapy with sulphonylureas and metformin are not controlled and hence the option left is either addition of third drug or put patient on insulin therapy. Insulin therapy is costly as well as not preferred therapy by patient due to poor compliance. Newer antidiabetics such as thiazolidinediones are associated with adverse effects such as an excess risk of congestive heart failure, possibly acute myocardial infarction, increased rate of bone loss and liver toxicity.<br>
In the light of this, newer medications for diabetes are needed, which will have along with antihyperglycemic effect, a good tolerability profile.<br>
Diabetes is considered to be CHD risk equivalent. A drug reducing blood glucose levels along with having cardiovascular benefits is therefore preferred in diabetes.<br>
Hydroxychloroquine is a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and is being used in rheumatology for past four decades. The use of hydroxychloroquine is well established in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Hydroxychloroquine has shown antidiabetic effects in many studies. The mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine improves glucose control remains unclear. It appears to lower glucose levels without a large effect on insulin sensitivity or secretion. Data showing that the parent drug chloroquine slows insulin clearance, possibly by stabilizing intracellular lysosomes and slowing the breakdown of the internalized insulin-receptor complex<br>
3<br><br>
provides one possible explanation for the glucose lowering effect of hydroxychloroquine. This is supported by the fact that hydroxychloroquine inhibits cytosolic insulin metabolism. (Diabetes Res Clin Pract. 2002 Mar;55(3):209-19.)<br>
The glucose lowering efficacy of hydroxychloroquine has been studied in various clinical trials. A study conducted in 135 obese patients with diabetes mellitus, showed that hydroxychloroquine improved glycemic control in sulphonylurea-refractory patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes. (Diabetes Res Clin Pract. 2002 Mar;55(3):209-19.)<br>
In another prospective, multicenter observational study of 4905 adults with rheumatoid arthritis, use of hydroxychloroquine is associated with a reduced risk of diabetes. (JAMA. 2007 Jul 11 ;298(2): 187-93).<br>
Hydroxychloroquine has shown efficacy in patients with resistant diabetes also. A study conducted in 38 patients with non insulin-dependent diabetes resistant to commonly used therapies (oral drugs, insulin, combination of insulin and oral drugs) showed statistically significant improvement in patients who received the insulin and Hydroxychloroquine. The daily insulin dose in patients treated with the combined insulin and hydroxychloroquine therapy had to be reduced by an average of 30%. The trial showed that combining antidiabetic therapy with hydroxychloroquine in decompensated, treatment-refractory patients with noninsul in-dependent diabetes may help to break the vicious circle of hyperglycemia and lead to better management of the disease . (Ann Intern Med 1990 May 1;112(9):678-81)<br>
Along with antihyperglycaemic effects, hydroxychloroquine is also associated with cardiovascular benefits, due to its lipid lowering effect and antiplatelet effect.<br>
Improvement of serum cholesterol in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine has been reported. These include a decrease in serum levels of cholesterol by approximately 10% and an increase in low-density lipoprotein receptors. Hydroxychloroquine also led to a rise in both HDL and %HDL. (Ann Rheum Dis. 1997 Jun;56(6):374-7.)<br>
4<br><br>
Hydroxychloroquine therapy had a high statistical association with low serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL, irrespective of concomitant steroid administration. The hydroxychloroquine-treated group had lower cholesterol and LDL levels than those receiving neither hydroxychloroquine nor steroids. Very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced in the group receiving hydroxychloroquine, and this was associated with decreased plasma triglycerides in this group. (Br J Rheumatol. 1985 Aug; 24(3): 250-5.)<br>
In addition to its lipid lowering effect, hydroxychloroquine may be cardioprotective by reducing platelet aggregation.<br>
Hydroxychloroquine causes reduction in red blood cell aggregation without prolonging the bleeding time in humans and experimentally, reduces the size of the thrombus. There<br>
is a variably demonstrable reduction in platelet aggregation and blood viscosity in<br>
humans. (Am J Med. 1988 Oct 14;85(4A): 57-61)<br>
A more recent clinical study found a significant reduction jn plasma viscosity as well as whole blood viscosity in postoperative patients treated with hydroxychloroquine.<br>
WO/2001/032758 discloses Pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination of metformin with other anti diabetic drug, wherein the other antidiabetic agent is one or more of glyburide, glimepiride, glipyride, glipizide, chlorbropamide, gliclazide, acarbose, miglitol, troglitazone. rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, insulin and/or KRP-297.<br>
However, none of the prior art reveals compositions that comprising a fix dose combinations of Hydroxychloroquine with Sulphonyluers, Biguanides and Thiazolidinediones for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
Thus it is an object of the present invention to provide formulation comprising fixed dose combination of hydroxychloroquine with antidiabetic drugs such as sulphonyl ureas,<br>
5<br><br>
biguanides and thiazohdinediones for treatment of diabetes mellitus. Fixed dose combination of hydroxychloroquine with antidiabetic drugs such as sulphonylureas, bigUanides and thiazohdinediones will thus be an effective alternative for treatment of diabetes mellitus, because of its efficacy and safety.<br>

Example 1<br>
Experimental   study   on   fixed   dose   combination   of Hydroxychloroquine  with<br>
Glimepiride<br>
Thirty Wistar rats weighing 150 - 200 g of either sex were divided into six groups consisting of five rats each. Experimental diabetes was induced in rats by injecting alloxan monohydrate intraperitonially at a dose of 90 mg/kg body weight. Rats with blood sugar level of 250- 350 mg/dl, were considered as diabetic and employed in the study.<br>
Group 1 (normal control) consisted of normal rats that neither received alloxan monohydrate nor any drug. Group 2 served as diabetic control which received vehicle orally. Group 3 was diabetic and treated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) at the dose of 160 mg/kg; p.o. Group 4 was diabetic and treated with glimepiride (GLM) at the dose of 8 mg/kg; p.o. Group 5 was diabetic and treated with low dose combination of GLM (4mg/kg) and HCQ (80 mg/kg), whereas Group 6 was diabetic and treated with high dose combination of GLM (8mg/kg) and HCQ (160 mg/kg). The study drugs were administered for nine days.<br>
There was a significant difference between the treated groups with respect to fall in blood glucose  levels.  Both  (  low  dose  and high  dose)  combination treatment  showed<br>
10<br><br>
significantly more fall in blood glucose levels as compared to individual treatment groups (p
The present study demonstrates that GLM and HCQ in high dose combination is superior than their individual components in terms of glucose lowering activity in alloxan-induced diabetic rats.<br>
Example 2<br>
Experimental   study   on   fixed   dose   combination   of  Hydroxychloroquine  with<br>
Metformin<br>
Thirty Wistar rats weighing 150 - 200 g of either sex were divided into six groups consisting of five rats each. Experimental diabetes was induced in rats by injecting alloxan monohydrate intraperitonially at a dose of 90 mg/kg body weight. Rats with blood sugar level of 250- 350 mg/dl, were considered as diabetic and employed in the study. Group 1 (normal control) consisted of normal rats that neither received alloxan monohydrate nor any drug. Group 2 served as diabetic control which received vehicle orally. Group 3 was diabetic and treated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) at the dose of 160 mg/kg; p.o. Group 4 was diabetic and treated with metformin (MET) at the dose of 500 mg/kg; p.o. Group 5 was diabetic and treated with low dose combination of MET (250mg/kg) and HCQ (80 mg/kg), whereas Group 6 was diabetic and treated with high dose combination of MET (500 mg/kg) and HCQ (160 mg/kg). The study drugs were administered for.nine days.<br>
