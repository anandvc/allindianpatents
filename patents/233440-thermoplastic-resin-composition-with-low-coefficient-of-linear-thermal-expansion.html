ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE<br>

THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
l<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic resin composition having a low coefficient of linear thermal expansion. More particularly, the present invention relates to a styrenic thermoplastic resin composition that comprises a diene graft polymer, two kinds of vinyl cyanide-vinyl aromatic copolymers different in the range of weight-average molecular weight and a N-substituted maleimide copolymer in a specific ratio which has a low coefficient of linear thermal expansion, a decreased volatile organic compound (VOC) content and shows good impact strength and heat resistance.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A styrenic thermoplastic resin is excellent in impact resistance, mechanical strength, appearance and mold processability, therefore, the resin has been widely applied to electric/electronic appliances, interior/exterior parts of automobiles and household products. In particular, when a resin is used for interior/exterior parts of automobiles, especially for exterior parts which is exposed to the outside where temperature and weather are extremely changeable, used to be made for relatively large-sized parts of automobiles and mainly connected to metal parts, not only the above properties such as impact resistance, mechanical strength but also good heat resistance and dimensional stability are required.<br>
When the heat resistance is insufficient, the molded article of the resin composition tends to be deformed and crooked at high temperature. And when the dimensional stability is insufficient, the molded article of the resin composition does not fit to other parts during assembly and tends to be deformed and distorted, or cracks may sometimes take place under highly changeable temperature. Therefore, heat resistance and dimensional stability are highly required for use in the parts of automobiles. Especially, the moled articles assembled to the metal parts tend to be deformed after assembly according to the change in temperature even though it fits to other parts at the time of<br>
2<br><br>
assembly.<br>
The reason for this is that the coefficient of linear thermal expansion of the resin is about 4-8 times higher than that of metal. Accordingly, if the coefficient of linear thermal expansion of the resin gets close to that of the metal, the resin the resin may be used in various application even which has been limited.<br>
In order to achieve a low level of coefficient of linear thermal expansion of resin, inorganic fillers such as calcium carbonate, talc, and so forth have been used. Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 10-265644 discloses an ABS resin composition with low level of coefficient of linear thermal expansion by using an ultrafine particulate calcium carbonate as a filler. However, in this patent, although the coefficient of linear thermal expansion of the resin is somewhat improved, such a composition is limited in the range of utilization, because of poor impact strength and surface appearance.<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors have developed a thermoplastic resin composition having a low coefficient of linear thermal expansion and a decreased volatile organic compound (VOC) content as well as good impact strength and heat resistance by using diene graft polymer, two kinds of vinyl cyanide-vinyl aromatic copolymers and N-substituted maleimide copolymer in a specific ratio<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a styrenic thermoplastic resin composition having a low coefficient of linear thermal expansion without using inorganic filler.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a styrenic thermoplastic resin composition having good impact strength and heat resistance as well as low coefficient of linear thermal expansion and a decreased volatile organic compound (VOC) content.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a styrenic thermoplastic resin composition having good dimensional stability.<br>
Other objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the ensuing disclosure and appended claims.<br>
3<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The thermoplastic resin composition according to the present invention comprises (A) a diene graft polymer prepared by grafting in emulsion polymerization 100 parts by weight of a monomer mixture comprising 20-30% by weight of a vinyl cyanide compound and 70-80% by weight of a vinyl aromatic compound to 40-60 parts by weight of a diene rubber; (B) a vinyl cyanide- vinyl aromatic copolymer having a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 100,000-200,000 prepared by copolymerizing 20-40 parts by weight of a vinyl cyanide compound and 80-60 parts by weight of a vinyl aromatic compound; (C) a vinyl cyanide- vinyl aromatic copolymer having a weight-average molecular weight(Mw) of 200,000-600,000 prepared by copolymerizing 20-40 parts by weight of a vinyl cyanide compound and 80-60 parts by weight of a vinyl aromatic compound; and (D) an N-substituted maleimide copolymer, wherein (A) is 15-30 parts by weight, (B)+(C) is 40-84 parts by weight, (D) is 1-30 parts by weight, and (B): (C) is from 0 : 100 to 80 : 20. The components (A), (B), (C) and (D) will be described in detail hereinafter.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
(A) Diene graft polymer<br>
The diene graft polymer of the present invention is prepared by mixing 100 parts by weight of a monomer mixture of a vinyl cyanide compound and a vinyl aromatic compound and 40-60 parts (on the basis of solids content) by weight of diene rubber, and by grafting in a conventional emulsion polymerization the monomer mixture to the diene rubber.<br>
The monomer mixture consists of 20-30 % by weight of a vinyl cyanide compound and 80-70 % by weight of a vinyl aromatic compound. In the present invention, the graft ratio of grafting the polymer matrix onto the diene rubber is preferably 40-70 % based upon the weight of the diene graft polymer.<br>
If the graft ratio is less than 40 %, it is difficult to obtain uniform particle sized white powder during coagulation and drying process and the glossy appearance is deteriorated due to fish eye, pinhole or sandsurface formation. Further, if the graft ratio is more than 70 %, the resulting product tends to be inferior in impact strength, flowability and glossy appearance.<br>
4<br><br>
The diene rubber to be used for the preparation of the diene graft polymer (A) includes polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polychloroprene, a butadiene-styrene copolymer, and a butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer and so forth. Among them, polybutadiene, a butadiene-styrene copolymer, and a butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer may be preferably used.<br>
The average rubber particle size of the diene rubber is preferably in the range of 0.1-0.6 [M, more preferably 0.2-0.5 ;m. If the average rubber particle size is less than 0.1  lm, the resin composition cannot provide a sufficient impact strength. On the other hand, if the average rubber particle size exceeds 0.6 //m, the glossy appearance is deteriorated.<br>
Examples of the vinyl cyanide compound for preparing the diene graft polymer (A) include acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and the like. These vinyl cyanide compounds can be used alone or in combination.<br>
Examples of the vinyl aromatic compound for preparing the diene graft polymer<br>
(A)	include styrene, a -methylstyrene, p-t-butylstyrene, 2,4-dimethylstyrene, vinyltoluene and the like. These vinyl aromatic compounds can be used alone or in combination.<br>
(B)	Vinyl cyanide-vinyl aromatic copolymer having a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 100,000-200,000<br>
The vinyl cyanide-vinyl aromatic copolymer (B) of the present invention is prepared by conventional polymerization such as emulsion, suspension, solution or bulk polymerization using 20-40 parts by weight of a vinyl cyanide compound and 80-60 parts by weight of a vinyl aromatic compound.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the vinyl cyanide-vinyl aromatic copolymer (B) is preferably in the range of 100,000-200,000. If the weight average molecular weight of the copolymer is less than 100,000, although the flowability of the resin composition is improved, the resin composition cannot obtain sufficient impact strength and the product appearance is deteriorated due to pinholes and sandsurface formation.<br>
Examples of the vinyl cyanide compound include acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile<br>
5<br><br>
and the mixture thereof. These vinyl cyanide compounds can be used alone or in combination.<br>
Examples of the vinyl aromatic compound include styrene, a -methylstyrene, p-t-butylstyrene, 2,4-dimethylstyrene, vinyltoluene and the mixture thereof. These vinyl aromatic compounds can be used alone or in combination.<br>
(C)	Vinyl cyanide-vinyl aromatic copolymer having a weight-average molecular<br>
weight(Mw) of 200,000-600,000<br>
The vinyl cyanide- vinyl aromatic copolymer (C) of the present invention is prepared by conventional polymerization such as emulsion, suspension, solution or bulk polymerization using 20-40 parts by weight of a vinyl cyanide compound and 80-60 parts by weight of a vinyl aromatic compound.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the vinyl cyanide-vinyl aromatic copolymer (C) is preferably in the range of 200,000-600,000. If the weight average molecular weight of the copolymer is more than. 600,000, there is a difficulty in injection molding process due to a poor fluidity, and the value as a commercial product may be impaired.<br>
Examples of the vinyl cyanide compound include acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and the mixture thereof. These vinyl cyanide compounds can be used alone or in combination.<br>
Examples of the vinyl aromatic compound include styrene, a -methylstyrene, p-t-butylstyrene, 2,4-dimethylstyrene, vinyltoluene and the mixture thereof. These vinyl aromatic compounds can be used alone or in combination.<br>
(D)	N-substituted maleimide copolymer<br>
The N-substituted maleimide copolymer (D) of the present invention is a copolymer prepared by copolymerizing 20-60 parts by weight of a mixture of maleic anhydride and N-substituted maleimide and 40-80 parts by weight of a vinyl aromatic compound and/or a vinyl cyanide compound.<br>
If the amount of the mixture of maleic anhydride and N-substituted maleimide is less than 20 parts by weight, the glass transition temperature of N-substituted maleimide<br>
6<br><br>
is lowered, accordingly, the resin composition is not sufficiently improved in impact strength. On the other hand, if the amount of a mixture of maleic anhydride and N-substituted maleimide is more than 60 parts by weight, the glass transition temperature become so high that the molding processing is difficult.<br>
Examples of the N-substituted maleimide include N-methyl maleimide, N-ethyl maleimide, N-cyclohexyl maleimide, N-phenyl maleimide and the mixture thereof. These N-substituted maleimides can be used alone or in combination.<br>
Examples of the vinyl aromatic compound include styrene, a -methylstyrene, p-t-butylstyrene, 2,4-dimethylstyrene, vinyltoluene and the mixture thereof. These vinyl aromatic compounds can be used alone or in combination.<br>
Examples of the vinyl cyanide compound include acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and the mixture thereof. These vinyl cyanide compounds can be used alone or in combination.<br>
The N-substituted maleimide (D) can be used in the amount of 1—30 parts by weight. If the amount is more than 30 parts by weight, a flowability of the resin composition is decreased, so that the practical application is limited. On the other hand, if the amount is less than 1 part by weight, volatile organic compound (VOC) content may be increased and the resin composition cannot obtain sufficient heat resistance.<br>
In the present invention, (A) is 15-30 parts by weight, (B)+(C) is 40-84 parts by weight, (D) is 1-30 parts by weight, and (B): (C) is from 0 : 100 to 80 : 20.<br>
If the amount of diene graft polymer (A) exceeds 30 parts by weight, the coefficient of linear thermal expansion of the resin composition is increased, so that the desired properties are not obtained. And if the amount of diene graft polymer (A) is less than 15 parts by weight, the impact strength is reduced, so that the resin composition is not suitable for use.<br>
The ratio by weight of (B) to (C) is from 0: 100 to 80 : 20. If the ratio by weight of (B) is more than 80, the impact resistance of the resin composition is reduced.<br>
Other additives may be contained in the resin composition of the present invention. The additives include an oxidation inhibitor, a lubricant, an impact modifier, a light stabilizer, a filler, an inorganic additive, pigment and/or dye.<br>
The invention may be better understood by reference to the following examples<br>
