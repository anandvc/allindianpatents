The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of indoles, e.g. 1.2,3,9-tetra-hydro-carbazol-4-one and derivatives thereof.<br>
l,2,3,9-tetrahydro-carbazol-4-one (THOC) and derivatives thereof can be used as inter¬mediates in the process for the preparation of e.g. valuable active substances in medica¬ments, e.g. as an intermediate in the process for the preparation of a carbazolyl-(4)-oxy-propanolamine derivative of formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
X     is a bond, -CH2-, an oxygen or sulfur atom;<br>
Ar   is phenyl, naphthyl, indanyl or tetrahydronaphthyl;<br>
R1    is hydrogen, C]-C6alkyl, benzyl or naphthyl;<br>
R'    is hydrogen, C1-C6alkyl or arC1-C6alkyl selected from benzyl, phenylethyl and<br>
phenylpropyl; R     is hydrogen or C1-C6alkyl; R4    is hydrogen or C1-C6alkyl, or when X is an oxygen atom, R4 together with R5 is<br>
-CH2O-; R5 and R6 are independently of each other hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, C1-C6alkyl,<br>
-CONH2-, C1-C6alkoxy, benzyloxy, C1-C6alkylthio, C1-C6alkylsulphinyl or<br>
Ci-C6alkylsulphonyl; or R5 and R6 together represent methylenedioxy.<br>
e.g. of (l-(carbazol-4-yloxy-3-((2-(o-methoxyphenoxy)ethyl)amino)-2-propanol (e.g. EP 004,920) or carvedilol. A medicament containing carvedilol for the treatment of patients suffering from hypertension or congestive heart failure is commercially available, e.g. under the tradename of Dilatrend®.<br>
In one embodiment the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I<br><br><br>
wherein both R7 are, independently, C1-C6alkyl, or together are -CH2-CH2-CH2-; comprising cyclizing a compound of formula II<br><br>

in the presence of a palladium catalyst in an amount in the range from 0.00001 to lower than 5 mol %.<br>
Examples of a palladium catalyst include Pd organic compounds, like Pd(PPh3)4 wherein Ph is phenyl, trans-di(u-acetato)bis[o-(di-o-tolylphosphino)benzyl]dipalladium (II), and bis(acetonitrile)-paIladium(II)chloride. palladium salts like l2or another salt without addition of ligands, e.g. palladium acetate; and palladium catalysts on a solid support, like Pd(PPh3)4 polymer bound, e.g. commercially available from suppliers like Aldrich, e.g. catalog number 511579, and 5 % Pd/C, e.g. 5 % Pd/C 50 % H20 type E105 CA/W, or type E10N/W; 10 % Pd/C, e.g. 10 % Pd/C 50 % H20 type K-0220 from suppliers like Heraeus and Degussa; and a microencapsulated palladium catalyst.<br>
Examples of a microencapsulated palladium catalyst include catalysts prepared by im¬mobilizing palladium, e.g. colloidal palladium or palladium acetate, optionally with acti¬vating ligands, within a permeable polymer microcapsule shell. For example, a microen¬capsulated catalyst may be prepared by dissolving or dispersing a catalyst in a first phase (e.g. an organic phase), dispersing the first phase in a second, continuous phase (e.g. an aqueous phase) to form an emulsion, reacting one or more microcapsule wall-forming materials at the interface between the dispersed first phase and the continuous second phase to form a microcapsule polymer shell encapsulating the dispersed first phase core and optionally recovering the microcapsules from the continuous phase. The encapsulated<br><br>
catalyst may be recovered from the reaction medium and re-cycled as is described e.g. in WO2003006151. e.g. within a highly cross-linked polyurea matrix, e.g. Pd(0)EnCat™ NP (30 % Matrix content, 0.4 mmol Pd/g) which is commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich, e.g. under catalog number 65,366-7.<br>
The reaction may take place in a solvent like NMP. DMF, ethanol or H2O in ethanol.<br>

The process may be performed at a temperature in the range from room temperature (RT) to the corresponding boiling point of the solvent used, e.g. at 135°C or 140°C.<br>
The process may be performed during a time period of from 1 hour to 72 hours, e.g. for 20 hours or 14 hours, e.g. overnight.<br>
The process may be performed in the presence of an additional extra ligand, e.g. tetra-phenylphosphonium chloride.<br>
The catalyst may be removed from the reaction mixture by procedures known to the skilled artisan, e.g. by extraction or by suction. The removal may take place at a temperature in the range from RT to below the corresponding boiling point, e.g. in a range from 80 to 90°C. The removed catalyst may be washed once or several times with a solvent, e.g. with the solvent used in the reaction, e.g. with NMP.<br>

Examples of a base include NaOH, mineral alkaline agents like NaHC03 and Na2C03, salts of organic acids like sodium acetate, and organic bases like triethylamine and tripropylamine.<br>
Neutralization may take place by neutralization of an acid with a mineral alkaline agent or an organic base, e.g. by neutralization of an organic acid like acetic acid with a mineral alkaline agent like sodium hydroxide, an aqueous solution thereof, or with an organic base like triethylamine or tripropylamine. After neutralization, water may be eliminated by a process known to the skilled person, e.g. by destination.<br>
After the neutralization step an additional base may be added to the mixture.<br>
The ONE POT REACTION may be performed by addition of a solvent like NMP, DMF, ethanol or H20 in ethanol to the reaction mixture. The solvent may be added at different stages of the process, e.g. before or after the neutralization.<br>
The amount of the solvent may be in the range from 20 to 90 weight %, e.g. from 50 to 70 weight %.<br>
The temperature at which the ONE POT REACTION may be performed is depending on whether the catalyst had already been added or not. For example, prior to the addition of the catalyst the temperature may be in the range from RT to 100°C, e.g. 60°C. Following the addition of catalyst the temperature may be raised up to the corresponding boiling point of the solvent used, e.g. at 135°C or MOT.<br><br>
The catalyst may be removed from the reaction mixture by procedures known to the skilled artisan, e.g. by extraction or by suction. The removal may take place at a temperature in the range from RT to below the corresponding boiling point, e.g. in a range from 80 to 90°C. The removed catalyst may be washed once or several times with a solvent, e.g. with the solvent used in the reaction, e.g. with NMP.<br>
By the ONE POT REACTION the compound of formula I may be obtained in a yield of from 35 to 100 %, e.g. 60 to 90 %, e.g. 70 to 90 %, e.g. 80 to 90 %.
