PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of Application Serial No. 11/301,707, filed December 13, 2005, and a continuation-in-part of Application Serial No. 11/302,551, filed December 13, 2005. This application claims priority to and benefit from the foregoing, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Technical Field.<br>
Hie invention includes embodiments that relate to a membrane-based article. The invention includes embodiments that relate to a method of making the membrane-based article.<br>
Discussion of Related Art.<br>
Membranes with high porosity, wettability, and chemical resistance may be used, in liquid size exclusion filtration applications, coatings for medical devices, or ion exchange membranes in electrochemical cells. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) may be desirable for its chemical inertness and resistance, and expanded. PTFE (ePTFE) would be desirable for both chemical resistance and porosity. However, due to the hydrophobicity of PTFE, surface wetting may be problematic and may require treatment to render it hydrophilic. The surface, and pores in the surface, of the membrane may be rendered hydrophilic by physical adsorption, chemical modification of the bulk polymer, or surface grafting. Physical adsorption may result in an undesirable reversal of hydrophilicity in too short a period of time, and chemical modifications may be problematic during production.<br>
Commercially available hydrophilic ePTFE membranes may be used in liquid water filtration. These membranes may be pre-wet by membrane manufacturers and shipped to end-users while still wet Such a membrane may de-wet or dry. The drying of the membrane may render it ineffective, difficult to re-wet, and may necessitate undesirable shipping considerations (such as wet shipping). Other undesirable aspects include economic considerations such as the need for special handling and sealable containers, and increased shipping weight, and the like.<br>
It may be desirable to have a membrane with properties that differ from those properties of currently available membranes. It may be desirable to have a membrane produced by a method that differs from those methods currently available.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention includes embodiments that relate to a membrane-based article that includes a surfactant. The invention includes embodiments that relate to an apparatus that includes the article. The invention includes embodiments that telate to a method of using the article and/or apparatus.<br>
In the following specification and the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms have the following meanings. The singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, Approximating language, as used herein throughout the specification and claims, may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that could permissibly vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related. Accordingly, a value modified by a term such as "about" is not to be limited to the precise value specified. In some instances, the approximating language may correspond to the precision of an instrument for measuring the value. Similarly, "free" may be used in combination with a term, and may include an insubstantial number, or trace amounts, while still being considered free of the modified term. A membrane is an article of natural or synthetic material that is permeable to one or more solutes and/ or solvents in a solution.<br>
As used herein, the terms "may" and "may be" indicate a possibility of an occurrence within a set of circumstances; a possession of a specified property, characteristic or<br><br>
function; and/or qualify another verb by expressing one or more of an ability, capability, or possibility associated with the qualified verb. Accordingly, usage of "may" and "may be" indicates that a modified term is apparently appropriate, capable, or suitable for an indicated capacity, function, or usage, while taking into account that in some circumstances the modified term may sometimes not be appropriate, capable, or suitable. For example, in some circumstances an event or capacity can be expected, while in other circumstances Ihe event or capacity cannot occur - this distinction is captured by the terms "may" and "may be".<br>
An article according to an embodiment of the invention includes a porous membrane and a surfactant in contact with the porous membrane. A porous membrane includes a plurality of pores. The pore size, density, and distribution may be determined by the end used envisaged. The surfactant may function as a superspreader when in solution. A superspreader may provide surface tension values lower than other commonly used surfactants, and have the property of "super- spreading". Superspreading is the ability of a drop of the solution to spread to a diameter that is greater than the diameter of a drop of distilled water on a hydrophobic surface; and, the diameter to which the superspreader solution spreads is greater than a diameter to which a solution of water and a non-super-spreading surfactant would spread on the hydrophobic surface. In addition to the spread diameter difference, the contact angle of a superspreader solution droplet on a surface is relatively larger than a contact angle of a non-super-spreading surfactant solution droplet on a surface. Values of, for example/ the spread diameter and contact angle for superspreader surfactants are disclosed hereinbelow. Reference to "surfactant" herein is to superspreaders unless context or language indicates otherwise. Suitable superspreader surfactants include one or more of trisiloxane alkoxylate-based surfactants, Gemini silicon-based surfactants, or hydrolytically stable surfactants.<br>
A suitable surfactant includes an organsiloxane, an organosilane, or combinations of organosiloxanes and organosilanes. In one embodiment, the surfactant includes an organosiloxane having a general formula M1DnDpM2. The general formula can be expressed particularly as formula (I):<br><br>
wherein "n" is an integer from 0 to 50; "p" is an integer from 1 to 50; R1 to R9 are independently at each occurrence a hydrogen atom, an aliphatic radical, an aromatic radical, or a cycloaliphatic radical; and R10 is a polyoxyalkylene having formula (II):<br><br>
wherein "w", "y" and "z" are independently an integer from 0 to 20, with the proviso that llw" is greater than or equal to 2 and "w + x + y11 is in a range of from about 2 to<br><br>
about 20; R11 is a hydrogen atom or an aliphatic radical, R12 is a hydrogen atom, an aliphatic radical, or a carboxylate; and R13 is a divalent aliphatic radical having structure (HI);<br>
(III)    -CH2-CH<ri4xrls></ri4xrls>
wherein R14 is a hydrogen atom or an aliphatic radical, R15 is a divalent aliphatic radical, andVisOorl.<br>

In one embodiment, the surfactant includes a trisiloxane alkoxylate-based surfactant (TSA). The oxyalkylene groups in the TSA-based surfactants include one or more of oxyethylene, oxypropylene, or oxybutylene. If more than one type of oxyalkylene is present, the different oxyalkylene units in the copolymer may be present as alternating units, as blocks, or may be randomly distributed. In one embodiment, the surfactant includes a trisiloxane ethoxylate-based surfactant (TSE).<br>
TSA-based surfactants may be commercially available or may be chemically synthesized. Commercial TSA-based surfactants may be available under the trade names of SILWET, for example, SILWET L-77, SILWET L-408, SILWET L-806, or SF, such as SF1188 A, SF1288 from GE Advanced Materials, Silicones (Wilton, CT). TSA-based surfactant may be chemically synthesized by a hydrosilylation reaction of a silicon hydride-containing organosiloxane with an unsaturated polyoxyalkylene derivative.<br>
The silicon hydride-containing organosiloxane may have formula (TV):<br><br>
wherein the integers "n" and "p"; the radicals R1 to R9 are the same as defined hereinabove; and H is a hydrogen atom. The unsaturated polyoxyalkylene derivative may have formula (V):<br><br>

In one embodiment, the surfactant includes a first hydrophobic moiety linked to a spacer, which is linked to a second hydrophobic moiety to form a Gemini surfactant. The first hydrophobic moiety and the second hydrophobic moiety each includes silicon. Gemini surfactants are surfactants having two or more hydrophobic groups and at least one hydrophilic group attached to hydrophobic portions in the molecule.<br>
In one embodiment, the spacer includes a hydrophilic moiety. Suitable hydrophilic moieties include one or more of a cationic group, an anionic group, a polar nonionic group, or an amphoteric group. Suitable cationic groups include, but are not limited to, ammonium groups or positively charged peptide groups. Suitable anionic groups include, but are not limited to, carboxylic acid groups, sulfonic acid groups, sulfuric acid groups, sulfuric acid groups, phosphonic acid groups, boronic acid groups, fatty acid groups, or negatively charged peptide groups. Suitable polar non-ionic groups includes, but are not limited to, fatty acid ester groups, carbohydrate groups, or polyether and its derivatives. Suitable amphoteric groups include, but are not limited to, peptide groups. In one embodiment, a cationic group (for example an ammonium group) and an anionic group (for example a phosphate group) are present in the spacer to form an amphoteric surfactant.<br>
The terms anionic group and cationic group may encompass both protonated and deprotonated forms of the anionic and the cationic groups. For example, when the anionic group is described as a "carboxylic acid group", both the protonated form of the carboxylic acid (CO2H) and deprotonated form of the carboxylic acid (CGr) may be included within the meaning of the term "carboxylic acid group". Thus, the cationic group and the anionic group include salts of carboxylic acid group, a sulfonic acid group, a sulfuric acid group, a sulfinic acid group, a phosphoric acid group, a boronic acid group, or a fatty acid group.<br>
A peptide group for the spacer has a linear sequence of amino acids connected to the other by peptide bonds between the alpha amino and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids. The amino acids may be the standard amino acids or some other non standard amino acids. Some of the standard nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine (Ala), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (He), valine (Val), proline (Pro), phenylalanine (Phe), tryptophan (Trp) and methionine (Met). The polar neutral amino acids include glycine (Gly), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), cysteine (Cys), tyrosine (Tyr),<br><br>
asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gin). "The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine (Arg), lysine (Lys) and histidine (His). The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu). The non standard amino acids may be formed in body, for example by posttranslational modification, some examples of such amino acids being selenocysteine and pyrolysine. The peptides may be selected to have differing lengths, either in then- neutral (uncharged) form or in forms such as their salts. The peptides are optionally free of modifications such as glycosylates, side chain oxidation or phosphorylation or comprising such modifications. Substitutes for an amino acid within the sequence are selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs.

The component to be separated may include, for example, salts, ions, biomolecules, bacteria, and the like.<br>
Separation may be affected by concentration gradient or by application of a pressure differential across a membrane. Membrane-based articles for such applications may have the ability to pass certain chemical species while rejecting or preventing the passage of other molecules depending upon the relative differences between the pores size and the size of the chemical species and/or the nature of the chemical interaction between the membrane material and the chemical species. . Suitable examples of membrane-based separations include one or more of liquid filtration for example in a<br><br>
water purification system, polarity-based chemical separation, dialysis separation, or gas separation,<br>
The harsh processing as well as operating conditions for one or more of the separation systems may necessitate a need for membranes with high chemical, thermal and mechanical stability, often provided with hydrophobic membranes. However, hydrophobic membranes may often result in membrane fouling when used in a polar media, for example fouling of water filtration membranes or protein adsorption on hemodialysis membranes. Membrane fouling may necessitate expensive and labor intensive cleaning procedures, variable separation properties (permeability and/or selectivity) or complete device failure. Moreover, the separation and reusability characteristics of the membranes may also be affected by the wettability and rewettability properties of the membranes. The improved wetting properties and the hydrophilic characteristics of the articles prepared according to embodiments of the invention may aid in improved membrane performance for separation applications.<br>
A membrane-based article prepared according the embodiments of the invention may be used in a water purification or water treatment system. The water treatment system includes an article in accordance with an embodiment of the invention and a flow-inducing mechanism, The flow inducing mechanism may be operable to flow water containing a chemical species to the membrane. The membrane may filter the water to separate the chemical species from the water.<br>
The membrane architecture (thickness, symmetric/ assymetric) and pore sizes, distribution and density may be determined by the end-use application envisaged. A membrane-based article prepared according to the embodiments of the inventions may be used as a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane, a nanofiltration (NF) membrane, an ultrafiltration membrane (UF), or as a microfiltration (MF) membrane.<br>
A membrane-based article prepared according to the embodiments of the invention may be used for seawater desalination. A desalination system may affect separation of ions from water by flowing the seawater across the reverse osmosis membrane using a flow inducing mechanism. The flow inducing mechanism may generate cross-flow of water across the membrane cross-section. Separation may be affected by application of a pressure differential across the membrane in a range of from about 2 bars to about 200 bars. Prior to subjecting the sweater to reverse osmosis membrane, the sea-water may be pretreated to remove bacteria, fungi, biomolecules, divalent ions, and the like. Pre-treatment may be affected by passing the seawater through a number of microfiltration, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes. In one embodiment, a membrane-based article prepared according to the embodiments of the invention may be included in a reverse osmosis membrane system employed for desalination. In another embodiment, a membrane-based article prepared according to the embodiments of the invention may be included in one or more of microfiltration, ultrafiltration or nanofiltration systems<br><br>
employed for pre- treatment of seawater prior to desalination. The wetting properties and the hydrophilic characteristics of the articles may improve the fouling resistance resulting in improved separation performance.<br>
A membrane-based article prepared according to the embodiments of the invention may be used as an ion exchange filter, for example/ to separate the cathode and the anode in electrochemical cells. As used herein, the terms "ion exchange filter" and "ion exchange membrane" may be used interchangeably. Electrochemical cells include electrolysis cells, such as chloralkali cells; fuel cells having ion- exchange membranes, and the like. One or more properties of an ion exchange filter in an electrochemical cell include: mechanical integrity, low electrical resistance, or high ionic conductivity. Decreasing the filter thickness and/or increasing the liquid permeability may reduce electrical resistance. However, the lower limit of the thickness of the filter may be limited by resulting reduction in mechanical stability. Liquid permeability, wettability and re wettability of the filter (especially in fuel cells) may therefore be one of the factors affecting the performance of the electrochemical cells.<br>

Suitable ionic groups include one or more of, carboxylic acid groups, sulfonic acid groups, sulfuric acid groups, sulfinic acid groups, phosphonic acid groups, or boronic acid groups. The ionic groups may be present in the polymeric ionomers on the backbone or in the side chains.<br><br>
Other stable ion-exchange resins include polyvinyl alcohol, trifluorostyrene, polyamine, or divinyl benzene/styrene copolymers having the requisite functional groups. The polymers may be additionally mixed with metal salts to obtain the desired functionality and ionic conductivity. Optionally, finely divided powders or other non-ionic polymers can be incorporated into the ion-exchange materials to provide additional properties. Such a finely divided powder may be selected from inorganic compounds such as a metal oxide, nickel, silica, titanium dioxide, or platinum. Such a finely divided powder may be selected from organic compounds such as carbon black or graphite. The powder may provide specific added effects such as different aesthetic appearance (color), electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, catalytic effects, or enhanced or reduced reactant transport properties. Examples of non-ionic polymers include polyolefins, other fluoropolymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), or other thermoplastics and thermoset resins.

The ionomers maybe present as a uniform coating on the membrane-based article, may be impregnated on the surface as well as the pores of the membrane, or may be chemically reacted with the membrane material.<br>
The liquid permeability, wettability and rewettability of the IEM may be improved because of the superspreading properties of the surfactant in contact with the membrane as described in the embodiments of the the invention. The water permeability of the IEM may be in a range of greater than about 1 l/(h.m2.Atm), greater than about 10 l/(h.m2.Atm), greater than about 100 l/(h.m2.Atm), or greater than about 5001/(h.m2.Atm).<br>
A proton exchange membrane (PEM) can include an article produced according to embodiments of the invention. Such a PEM may have a relatively high water permeability, and may be suitable for use in a fuel cell or in a membrane reactor. The PEM has a reduced tendency to dry at the anode side and to excessively hydrate at the cathode side. An increased water permeability of the membrane may lower resistance to proton transport across the membrane increase electrical conductvity of the membrane in the cells.<br>
