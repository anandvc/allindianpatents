				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to wireless communications, and more<br>
particularly to elirninating data collisions in a frequency hopping communication<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wireless communication devices generally operate in either licensed RF bands<br>
or an unlicensed RF bands. Radiotelephone service providers generally acquire<br>
licenses to operate a wireless communication system in one or more of a plurality of<br>
licensed RF bands. These systems employ multiple methods to allow multiple access<br>
by multiple mobile stations on a common band of frequency channels. One such<br>
access technique, frequency division multiple access (FDMA), allows multiple access<br>
by assigning the mobile stations to different frequency channels within the RF band.<br>
Some of these systems employ frequency hopping, wherein data is transmitted to and<br>
from the intended mobile station while periodically changing the frequency channel.<br>
The periodic channel frequency hopping occurs on a regular time interval known as a<br>
frame. Coordinated frequency hopping systems use predetermined hopping patterns,<br>
or hop-sets, wherein the hop-sets are coordinated between all mobile stations to<br>
ensure that the signals to and from two or more mobile stations do not occur<br>
simultaneously on the same frequency channel. Uncoordinated frequency hopping<br>
does not coordinate the hop-set between mobile stations resulting in the periodic<br>
occurrence of simultaneous signal transmission on the same frequency. Such<br>
simultaneous transmissions are referred to as channel collisions. Data reception errors<br>
occurring during a channel collision are referred to as data collisions. Uncoordinated<br>
frequency hopping within this type of system is generally not used as the channel collisions and resultant data collisions will occur. The FCC has prohibited<br><br>
coordinated frequency hopping within the Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM)<br>
bands in order to avoid spectrum aggregation by a single type of service.<br>
Systems such as Bluetooth and 802.11 wireless communication systems, for<br>
example operate within the ISM bands. To avoid data collisions these systems may<br>
monitor the band and choose to operate only in unoccupied sub-bands. These systems<br>
may also change sub-bands as the result of the detection of interferer signal strength<br>
or the detection of signaling errors indicative of a channel collision with another<br>
transmitting station. However channel collisions still occur as devices must sense the<br>
interference caused by a channel collision in order to change the frequency sub-band.<br>
Therefore, in order for a GSM system to be compliant with FCC regulations a<br>
change to the hopping channel assignment scheme is needed such that the hopping<br>
channel assignments are uncoordinated. Therefore, what is needed is a method for the<br>
elimination of data collision errors caused by frequency hopping channel collisions in<br>
an uncoordinated frequency hopping system.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The various aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become more fully apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon careful<br>
consideration of the following Detailed Description of the Drawings with the<br>
accompanying drawings described below.<br>
FIG. 1 is an exemplary diagram of a communication system;<br>
FIG. 2 is an exemplary block diagram of a wireless communication device;<br>
FIG. 3 is an exemplary flow diagram of a data transmission method;<br>
FIG. 4 is an exemplary flow diagram of a data reception method;<br>

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
A method for the elimination of data collision errors in an uncoordinated<br>
frequency hopping communication system is disclosed. The method comprises<br>
determining that a first data set, which is to be sent to a first device, and a second data<br>
set, which is to be sent to a second device, is scheduled to be transmitted<br>
simultaneously on a first frequency, i.e. a channel collision. The data collision is<br>
avoided between the two data sets, by transmitting the first data set on the first<br>
frequency hopping frequency, while the second data set is delayed, also known as<br>
muted. The first data set is thereby transmitted unambiguously and data collisions are<br>
avoided in the first device. The final step is transmitting the second data set on a<br>
second frequency hopping frequency, sequentially next in the frequency hop pattern at<br>
the next frame. The second data set is thereby transmitted unambiguously with a<br>
delay of at least one frame. Thus the hopping channels are uncoordinated, since the<br>
original uncoordinated hopping sequences are unmodified except for the muting of<br>
the transmission to the second device during the channel collision. Data collisions are<br>
avoided in the second device during the transmission of the first data set by a<br>
determination that the second device is not the intended recipient, and suspension of<br>
data reception until another frame.<br>
Due to RF spectrum limitations, an increase in users and the cost of RF<br>
spectrum licenses, wireless telecommunications service providers can benefit from<br>
using unlicensed RF spectrum to complement the licensed spectrum portion of their<br>
systems. Although the spectrum is unlicensed, use-requirements may still apply. One<br>
example is the use of unlicensed RF bands to augment GSM radiotelephone services.<br>
The GSM system can use coordinated frequency hopping in which each mobile<br>
station in a cell uses the same set of channel frequencies and hopping pattern, and a<br>
unique time offset of the hopping pattern determined by the mobile allocation index<br>
offset (MAIO). In this way the system can accommodate one communication signal<br>
for each hopping channel without the occurrence of channel collisions within the<br>
same cell.<br>
Fig. 1 is an exemplary diagram of a wireless communication system 100<br>
according to the present invention. The system 100 includes a base station controller<br><br>
(BSC) 102, also known as a radio network controller (RNC) 102 in some systems, at<br>
least one base station 104, and a first wireless device 105, also known as a mobile<br>
station (MS) 105, and a second wireless device 107. The BSC 102 and the base<br>
stations 104 form the radio access network (RAN) 106 portion of the system which<br>
communicates with the wireless devices. A core network, which is coupled to the<br>
RAN, includes a mobile switching center (MSC) and may include a serving GPRS<br>
support node (SGSN). The core network (CN) 108 portion of the system, illustrated<br>
in FIG. 1, includes a first MSC 110 and a first SGSN 112 for a first service provider.<br>
The system 100 may also include a second MSC 114 and a second SGSN 116 for a<br>
second service provider. In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 1, only two<br>
core networks are illustrated but it is understood by one skilled in the art that a<br>
plurality of core networks may be coupled to a RAN.<br>
The base station 104 receives messages from the BSC 102 and transmits the<br>
messages to the intended wireless devices under an uncoordinated frequency hopping<br>
scheme. Communications between the base station 104 and the first wireless device<br>
105 share a first uncoprdinated hop-set while the base station 104 and the second<br>
wireless device 107 share a second uncoordinated hop-set. There is no coordination<br>
between the first uncoordinated hop-set and the second uncoordinated hop-set,<br>
however these hop-sets may comprise common frequency channels such that<br>
frequency channel collisions may occur. The wireless devices may be mobile stations<br>
or other user equipment that communicate with a serving node, such as the exemplary<br>
base station 104 of the communication system 100 in FIG.l. Each wireless device<br>
however is coordinated with the base station 104 to necessarily form the<br>
communication link between the two. Information represented in the data sets which<br>
are to be transmitted to the wireless devices either originate at the BSC 102, or are<br>
received at the BSC 102 from the core network 108 to be relayed to the intended<br>
wireless device. The information can be either packet-switched data or circuit-<br>
switched data and the information may be voice information or data information.<br>
Turning to FIG. 2, a block diagram of a wireless communication device 200 in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the invention is shown. This embodiment can be<br>
a cellular radiotelephone incorporating the present invention. However, it is to be<br><br>
understood that the present invention is not limited to this embodiment and may be<br>
utilized by other wireless communication devices such as paging devices, personal<br>
digital assistants, portable computing devices, and the like, having wireless<br>
communication capabilities. In this embodiment a frame generator 202 and a<br>
microprocessor 204, combine to generate the necessary communication protocol for<br>
operating in a wireless communication system. Microprocessor 204 uses memory 206<br>
comprising RAM 207, EEPROM 208, and ROM 209, which can be consolidated in<br>
one package 210, to execute the steps necessary to generate the protocol and to<br>
perform other functions for the wireless communication device, such as writing to a<br>
display 212, accepting information from a keypad 214, or controlling a frequency<br>
synthesizer 226 to attune the device to the appropriate frequency in a frequency<br>
hopping pattern. The memory may also include a SIM card 232. In situations where<br>
the wireless device is used for voice transmissions, the frame generator 202 processes<br>
audio transformed by audio circuitry 218 from a microphone 220 and to a speaker<br>
222.<br>
FIG. 2 also shows at least one transceiver 227 comprising receiver circuitry<br>
228, that is capable of receiving RF signals from at least one bandwidth and<br>
optionally more bandwidths. The receiver 228 may optionally comprise a first<br>
receiver and a second receiver, or one receiver capable of receiving in two or more<br>
bandwidths. The receiver 228, depending on the mode of operation, may be tuned to<br>
receive PLMRS, AMPS, GSM, EGPRS, CDMA, UMTS, WCDMA, Bluetooth, or<br>
WLAN, such as 802.11 communication signals for example. The transceiver 227<br>
includes at least one transmitter 234. The at least one transmitter 234 may be capable<br>
of transmitting to one device or base station in one frequency band and potentially on<br>
multiple frequency bands. As with the receiver 228, dual transmitters 234 may<br>
optionally be employed where one transmitter is for the transmission to a proximate<br>
device or direct link establishment to WLAN's and the other transmitter is for<br>
transmission to the base station 108.<br>
The wireless communication device 200, which can be adapted to<br>
communicate in a frequency hopping wireless communication, may also comprise a<br>
channel collision detection module 224 that detects when received messages are not<br><br>
intended to be received by the mobile station 200 and a transmission scheduling<br>
module 225 both coupled to the microprocessor 204.<br>
A base station 104 of the wireless communication system can include a<br>
transmitter 120 and a receiver 122 for communicating with a plurality of wireless<br>
communication devices. The base station 104 can also include a message reception<br>
module 124, that receives messages from the core network which are to be transmitted<br>
to one of a plurality of wireless communication devices. The base station may also<br>
include a frequency hop pattern generation module 126. The frequency hop pattern<br>
generation module 126 determines the frequency hop-set pattern for each device of<br>
the plurality of devices. The frequency hop-set patterns are uncoordinated from<br>
device to device. The base station 104 can also include a channel collision detection<br>
module 128 that detects when received messages are scheduled to be transmitted on<br>
the same frequency at the same time and a message scheduling module that<br>
reschedules or delays transmission of a data set that was determined to collide with<br>
another data set.<br>
FIG. 3 shows an exemplary flow diagram 300 illustrating how a first data set<br>
is received 302 at the base station 104 for transmission to the intended mobile station.<br>
The intended mobile station can be the first wireless device 105 in this exemplary<br>
embodiment. In step 302, the first data set is received at a first time on a first<br>
frequency of a first uncoordinated frequency hop-set. Similarly, a second data set is<br>
also received at the base station 104 for transmission to the intended mobile station,<br>
the second mobile station 107 in this exemplary embodiment. The first data set and<br>
the second data set do not necessarily arrive at the base station 104 at the same time.<br>
It is envisioned that they can in fact be received independently. The second data set<br>
can be also scheduled to be sent at the first time on the first frequency of a second<br>
uncoordinated frequency hop-set. The base station 104 can determine in step 304 that<br>
a data collision will occur as both the first and the second data set are scheduled to be<br>
transmitted on the same frequency at the same time. In step 308, the base station 104<br>
can determine which data set to send first or at all. In step 310, the first data set is<br>
then transmitted to the first wireless device 105 in this exemplary embodiment. This<br>
provides for an unambiguous transmission to the first wireless device 105. In step<br><br>
312, the second data set is delayed, or muted and not transmitted at the scheduled time<br>
or on the scheduled frequency. If the second data set is to be delayed, in step 314, the<br>
second data set may be delayed one cycle in the frequency hop-set. In step 316, the<br>
second data set can then be sent to the second device at the delayed time on the next<br>
frequency. If in step 304 the base station 104 determines that a collision will not<br>
occur, the base station 104 transmits, in step 306, both data sets as scheduled in<br>
accordance with each respective hop-set. The second data set may also be discarded<br>
instead of transmitted.<br>
Although two data sets are used for exemplary purposes throughout this<br>
disclosure, it is envisioned that a plurality of data sets may be scheduled to be<br>
transmitted simultaneously and on the same frequency as the individual frequency<br>
hop-sets associated with each device are uncoordinated between the devices. As the<br>
number of wireless devices cornmunicating in the communication system increases,<br>
the potential for data collisions also increases. Therefore the base station 104 must<br>
check the scheduling of all messages to be transmitted, in accordance with the above<br>
method, to avoid collisions.<br>
FIG. 4 is an exemplary flowchart 400 outiining the operation of a wireless<br>
device according to an exemplary embodiment. For example, the second wireless<br>
device 107 can be the intended recipient of the second data set from the base station<br>
104. As the base station 104 has delayed 312 the transmission of the second data set,<br>
the second device 107 can receive 402 the first data set during the scheduled time the<br>
second device 107 is supposed to receive the second data set. If, step 404, the second<br>
wireless device 107 determines the first data set is actually intended for the second<br>
wireless device 107, in step 406, the second wireless device 107 processes the data. If<br>
in step 404, the second wireless device 107 determines that it is not the intended<br>
recipient for the data transmitted by the base station, i.e. the first data set, the first data<br>
set is discarded 408 or reception is suspended.<br>
Continuing with reference to FIG. 4, the second device 107 can then tune 410<br>
to the next scheduled frequency in the hop pattern allowing that device to receive 412<br>
the second data set at the next frequency, at the next scheduled frame. The next<br>
frequency in the hopping pattern is the next scheduled frequency in the hop-set, such<br><br>
that the hopping pattern resumes at the next scheduled frame. In this way the two<br>
hopping patterns, a first hopping pattern for the first device 105 and a second hopping<br>
pattern for the second device 107, are uncoordinated hopping patterns since the<br>
hopping patterns are unaltered after the occurrence of a channel collision.<br>
The base station 104 should determine which data set should be transmitted<br>
after deterrnining 304 that a channel collision will occur. In one exemplary<br>
embodiment, the base station 104 or the base station controller 102 can send the data<br>
set received first in time at the base station 104 or the base station controller 102. In<br>
this exemplary embodiment, the data sets are processed on a first in first out (FIFO)<br>
basis. In another exemplary embodiment, the data set to be sent first is randomly<br>
selected. If multiple data sets are scheduled to collide, all except one data set would<br>
have to be rescheduled. It should be noted that multiple transmissions can occur at<br>
the same time. However, multiple transmissions can not occur at the same time on<br>
the same frequency without causing data collisions and resultant data errors in the<br>
wireless device receivers. In another embodiment, priority is given according to the<br>
radiated power at the base station 104. A higher priority is assigned for example to a<br>
device that requires higher radiated power at the base station 104. It may also be the<br>
case that the higher priority is assigned to a device that requires lower radiated power<br>
at the base station 104. In yet another embodiment, priority is given according to the<br>
needs of the wireless device, whereby voice data may be given higher priority than<br>
other types of data, for example. It is understood by one skilled in the art that there<br>
are a plurality of methods for determining which data set to send and in what order,<br>
and the disclosure is not limited to those exemplary embodiments listed herein.<br>
FIG. 5 is an exemplary flowchart outlining a method 500 for determining that<br>
the data is not intended to be received by either of the exemplary first wireless device<br>
105 or the second wireless device 107. For example, this process may be used in step<br>
404 of the flowchart 400. In this embodiment, a unique sub-channel code can be<br>
assigned 502 to each wireless device using the hop-set. The unique sub-channel code<br>
can be inserted 504 into each transmission. In this exemplary embodiment, the<br>
unique sub-channel code can be included in a control field in the received data set.<br>
The unique sub-channel code allows each device to determine which data set, the first<br><br>
data set or the second data set in the exemplary embodiment, is intended to be<br>
received by the respective device. The wireless device 105,107 can then decode 506<br>
the control field upon reception of the data set and determine 508 if the unique sub-<br>
channel code in the received data set matches the unique sub-channel code assigned to<br>
the wireless device by the base station 104. If the unique sub-channel code matches<br>
510, then device processes 512 the data. If the unique sub-channel code does not<br>
match 514, the data set is discarded 516.<br>
For example, in an exemplary GSM system, a GSM traffic channel (TCH)<br>
might be modified to include a temporary mobile station identity code (TMSIC),<br>
which is the unique sub-channel code having a unique value for every wireless device<br>
receiving a data set, i.e. data transmissions, from the base station on a particular hop-<br>
set of hopping frequencies channels. Upon decoding the TMSIC the second mobile<br>
station will determine that the received TMSIC is different that its TMSIC assignment<br>
and discard the received data or suspend reception.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, in another exemplary embodiment flowchart 600, the<br>
wireless devices, such as the first and second wireless devices 105,107, receive 602,<br>
from the base station 104, a unique priority code which is assigned to each wireless<br>
device using the hop-set of frequency hopping channels. The wireless devices, 105,<br>
107 then receive 604 from the base station 104 the channel frequencies and hopping<br>
patterns of all wireless devices using a hop-set. The received frequencies and hopping<br>
patterns are used by the wireless devices 105,107 to predict or determine when<br>
channel collisions will occur. For example when the first wireless device 105 detects<br>
606 a channel collision, the first device 105 can use a predetermined rule set to<br>
determine 608 the intended recipient of the information transmitted by the base station<br>
104. The predetermined rule set assures that only one recipient is assigned during a<br>
channel collision.<br>
In one exemplary embodiment of this approach, the first wireless device 105 is<br>
assigned a device priority of "1", and a device priority of "0" is assigned to all other<br>
wireless devices using the hop-set. The first device 105 will receive 610 the first<br>
message which has the higher priority code. The first device will discard 612 any<br>
message with a "0" priority. If there will not be a channel collision, the message is<br><br>
processed 614. In this embodiment, multiple devices can be given the priority of "1"<br>
and when a channel collision is detected, the rule set determines which device with<br>
the "1" priority to receive the data set, with all other data set transmissions being<br>
delayed until the next scheduled frame. In another exemplary embodiment the device<br>
priority might automatically change according to predetermined rules after each<br>
channel collision, such that the mobile stations alternate using the channel during<br>
channel collisions. Upon determining that a channel collision will occur and that the<br>
transmitted data set is intended for a different wireless device, the second mobile<br>
station suspends reception. The priority of "1" and "0" are exemplary values and the<br>
values may be integrated over a range of values for example.<br>
Complimentary to the mobile station operation, after the base station detects<br>
that the channel collision will occur; the base station must determine if the channel<br>
collision involves data being sent to at least one device with a higher priority code.<br>
The base station will determine if a first message has a priority code higher than a<br>
second message. In this exemplary embodiment, only the first wireless device with<br>
the priority of "1" will receive the transmission of the first message when a channel<br>
collision occurs. The base station will send the first message which has the higher<br>
priority code and delay the message or messages with the lower priority code.<br>
In the above exemplary embodiments, the methods allow for the avoidance of<br>
data collisions in the downlink transmissions from base station to mobile station, i.e.<br>
wireless device. Analogous techniques may be applied for avoiding data collisions on<br>
the uplink transmissions, i.e. transmissions between mobile stations and the base<br>
station. This applies to the situation in which the uplink and down-link hop sets are<br>
uncoordinated. However it is anticipated that coordination of up-link and down-link<br>
hop-sets will be allowed. In the cases such where the downlink and uplink channels<br>
are assigned in pairs, one exemplary embodiment provides a method where the uplink<br>
channel assignment follows the downlink assignment on the same frequency<br>
channels. In another exemplary embodiment, such as in the GSM case, the uplink<br>
channel follows the downlink channel with a fixed frequency offset. According to<br>
this approach, whenever a downlink channel collision occurs there will necessarily be<br>
a corresponding uplink collision. Thus, in this exemplary embodiment, when a<br><br>
wireless device receives a downlink data set during a channel collision as in<br>
accordance with one of the approaches described above, it will then transmit its uplink<br>
data set on the scheduled uplink transmission period, whereas if a wireless device<br>
does not receive a data set during a channel collision it will refrain from transmitting<br>
its data set on the scheduled uplink period, and wait until the next scheduled uplink<br>
period to transmit the data set on the next channel frequency in the hop-set, thereby<br>
avoiding an uplink data collision.<br>
While the present inventions and what is considered presently to be the best<br>
modes thereof have been described in a manner that establishes possession thereof by<br>
the inventors and that enables those of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the<br>
inventions, it will be understood and appreciated that there are many equivalents to<br>
the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein and that myriad modifications and<br>
variations may be made thereto without departing from the scope and spirit of the<br>
inventions, which are to be limited hot by the exemplary embodiments but by the<br>
appended claims.<br>
 What is claimed is:<br><br>
We Claim :<br>
1.	A method in a wireless communication device to eliminate data collisions<br>
wherein transmissions are made in an uncoordinated frequency hopping scheme such that<br>
the downlink channels and uplink channels are assigned in pairs, and wherein the uplink<br>
channel assignment follows the downlink assignment and uplink channel collisions occur<br>
following downlink channel collisions, said method comprising:<br>
determining that a downlink channel collision has occurred including<br>
determining that a downlink data set received by the device was not intended to be<br>
received by the device;<br>
refraining from transmitting an uplink data set during the scheduled uplink<br>
period; and<br>
transmitting the uplink data set on the next scheduled uplink period<br>
thereby avoiding an uplink channel collision.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein determining that a downlink channel<br>
collision has occurred involves determining that a sub-channel code included in the<br>
downlink data set received by the device does not match an assigned sub-channel code.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein determining that a downlink channel<br>
collision has occurred involves determining that a priority code does not match an<br>
assigned priority code.<br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD FOR REDUCING DATA COLLISIONS IN A FREQUENCY HOPPING<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
The invention relates to a method in a wireless communication device (105, or 107) to eliminate data<br>
collisions wherein transmissions are made in an uncoordinated frequency hopping scheme such that the<br>
downlink channels and uplink channels are assigned in pairs, and wherein the uplink channel<br>
assignment follows the downlink assignment and uplink channel collisions occur following downlink<br>
channel collisions, said method comprising determining that a downlink channel collision has occurred<br>
including determining that a downlink data set received by the device was not intended to be received<br>
by the device; refraining from transmitting an uplink data set during the scheduled uplink period; and<br>
transmitting the uplink data set on the next scheduled uplink period thereby avoiding an uplink channel<br>
collision.</td>
