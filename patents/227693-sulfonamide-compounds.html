				<td> The present invention relates to sulfonamide compounds.<br>
The present invention refers to new sulfonamide derivatives, of general formula (la, lb, lc),<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
optionally in form of one of their stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, their racemate, or in form of a mixture of at least two of their stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or their salts, preferably their corresponding, physiologically acceptable salts, or corresponding solvates; to the processes for their preparation, to their application as medicaments in human and/or veterinary therapeutics, and to the pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
The new compounds of the present invention can be used in the pharmaceutical industry as intermediates and for preparing medicaments.<br>
The superfamily of serotonin receptors (5-HT) comprises 7 classes (5-HT1-5-HT7), which cover 14 human subclasses [D. Hoyer, et al., Neuropharmacology, 1997, 36, 419]. The 5-HT6 receptor has been the last serotonin receptor identified by molecular cloning in rats [F.J. Monsma, et al., Mol. Pharmacol., 1993, 43, 320; M. Ruat, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1993, 193, 268] as well as in humans [R. Kohen, et al., J.<br><br><br>
Neurochem., 1996, 66, 47]. The compounds with an affinity for the 5-HTe receptor are useful in treating different disorders of the Central Nervous System and of the Gastrointestinal system, as well as the irritable bowel syndrome. The compounds with an affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor are useful for treating anxiety, depression and cognitive memory disorders [M. Yoshioka, et al., Ann. NYAcad. Sci,, 1998, 861, 244; A. Bourson, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 1998, 125, 1562; D.C. Rogers, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. Suppl., 1999, 127, 22P; A. Bourson, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1995, 274, 173; A.J. Sleight, et al., Behav. Brain Res., 1996, 73, 245; T.A. Branchek, et al., Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 2000, 40, 319; C. Routiedge, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 2000, 130,1606]. It has been shown that the typical and atypical antipsychotics for treating schizophrenia have a high affinity for the 5-HTe receptors [B.L. Roth, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1994, 268,1403; C.E. Glatt, et al., Mol. Med., 1995,1, 398; F.J. Mosma, et a)., Mol. Pharmacol., 1993, 43, 320; T. Shinkai, et al, Am. J. Med. Genet., 1999, 88, 120]. The compounds with an affinity for the 5-HTe receptor are useful for treating infantile hyperkinesia (ADHD, attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder) [W.D. Hirst, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 2000, 130, 1597; C. Gerard, et al., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207; M.R. Pranzatelli, Drugs of Today, 1997, 33, 379].<br>
Patent application WO 01/32646 discloses sulfonamides derived from bicycles whereby each of the rings is 6-membered, aromatic or heteroaromatic rings with 5-HTe receptor antagonist activity.<br>
Patent application EP 0 733 628 discloses sulfonamides derived from indole with 5-HT1F receptor antagonist activity, useful for the treatment of migraines.<br>
Furthermore, it has been shown that the 5-HTe receptor plays a.role in the ingestion of food [Neuropharmacology, 41, 2001, 210-219].<br>
Eating disorders, particularly obesity, are a serious and increasingly frequent threat for the health of humans of all ages, since these dieseases increase the risk of developing other serious and even mortal diseases, preferably diabetes and coronary artery diseases.<br><br><br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention was to provide new compounds, particularly suitable as active substances in medicaments, preferably in medicaments for 5-HTe receptor regulation, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of a disorder or disease related to food intake, preferably for the regulation of appetite, for the maintenance, increase or reduction of body weight, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of obesity, bulimia, anorexia, cachexia or type II diabetes (non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), preferably type II diabetes caused by obesity, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of gastrointestinal tract disorders, preferably irritable bowel syndrome, for cognitive enhancement, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, anxiety, panic disorders, depression, preferably bipolar disorders, cognitive memory disorders, senile dementia processes, neurodegenerative disorders, preferably Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and/or Multiple Sclerosis, schizophrenia, psychosis or infantile hyperkinesia (ADHD, attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder), and other disorders mediated by the 5-HTe serotonin receptor in humans and/or in animals, preferably in mammals, more preferably in humans.<br>
It has been found that the 1-sulfonylindole derivatives of general formulas (la, Ib, Ic) described below show an affinity for the 5-HTe receptor.<br>
These compounds are therefore suitable for preparing a medicament for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of a disorder or disease related to food intake, preferably for the regulation of appetite, for the maintenance, increase or reduction of body weight, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of obesity,<br>
bulimia, anorexia, cachexia or type II diabetes (non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), preferably type II diabetes caused by obesity, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of gastrointestinal tract disorders, preferably irritable bowel syndrome, for cognitive enhancement, for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, anxiety, panic disorders, depression, preferably bipolar disorders, cognitive memory disorders, senile dementia processes, neurodegenerative disorders, preferably Alzheimer's disease,<br><br>
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and/or Multiple Sclerosis, schizophrenia, psychosis or infantile hyperkinesia (ADHD, attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder), and other disorders mediated by the 5-HTe serotonin receptor in humans and/or in animals, preferably in mammals, more preferably in humans. These compounds are also suitable for the preparation of a medicament for cognitive enhancement.<br>

Pharmaceutical Methods:<br>
BINDING TO THE 5HT6 SEROTONIN RECEPTOR<br>
HEK-293 cell membranes expressing the recombinant human 5HT6 receptor were supplied by Receptor Biology. The receptor concentration in said membranes is 2.18 pmol/mg of protein and the protein concentration is 9.17 mg/ml. The experimental protocol follows the method of B.L. Roth et al. [B.L Roth, S.C. Craigo, M.S. Choudhary, A. Uluer, F.J. Monsma, Y. Shen, H.Y. Meltzer, D.R. Sibley: Binding of Typical and Atypical Antipsychotic Agents to 5-Hydroxytryptamine-6 and Hydroxytryptamine-7 Receptors. The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994, 268,1403], with slight modifications. The commercial membrane is diluted (1:40 dilution) with the binding buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCI, 10 mM MgCI2, 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). The radioligand used is [3H]-LSD at a concentration of 2.7 nM, the final volume being 200 pi. Incubation begins by adding 100 nl of the membrane suspension (« 22.9 jag of membrane protein), and is prolonged for 60 minutes at a temperature of 37°C. Incubation ends by quick filtration in a Harvester Brandel Cell through fiberglass filters of the Scheleicher &amp; Schuell GF 3362 trademark, pretreated with a 0.5% polyethyleneimine solution. The filters are washed three times with three milliliters of 50 mM Tris HCI buffer, pH 7.4. The filters are transferred to vials and 5 ml of Ecoscint H. liquid scintillation cocktail are added to each vial. The vials are left to equilibrate for several hours prior to their counting in a 1414 Wallac Winspectral scintillation counter. The non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 100 jaM of serotonin. The assays are\ carried out in triplicate. The inhibition constants (Ki, nM) are calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the EBDA/LIGAND program [Munson and Rodbard, Analytical Biochemistry, 1980,107, 220].<br><br>
MEASUREMENTS OF FOOD INGESTION (BEHAVIOR MODELS)<br>
Male W rats (200-270 g) from Marian, S.A. are used. The rats are acclimatized to the housings during at least 5 days prior to being subjected to any experiment. During this period, the animals are housed (in groups of five) in translucent cages with water and ad libitum food. The animals are adapted to individual housing at least 24 hours prior to the tests.<br>
The acute effect of the sulfonamide derivatives of general formula (I) used experimentally on food ingestion in rats in fasting conditions is determined as follows:<br>
The rats are kept in fasting conditions for 23 hours in their individual cages of origin. After this period, the rats are orally or intraperitoneally treated with a composition comprising a sulfonamide derivative of general formula (I) or a corresponding composition (vehicle) without said sulfonamide derivative. Immediately after this, the rat is left with pre-weighed food; the accumulated food intake is measured after 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours.<br>
Said food ingestion measuring method is also disclosed in the literature (Kask et al., European Journal of Pharmacology 414 (2001), 215-224, and Turnbull et al., Diabetes, Vol. 51, August, 2002). The respective parts of the descriptions are herein incorporated as a reference, and they form part of the disclosure.<br>
