Methods for producing acylphenylalanine<br>
Technical field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing easily highly-purified<br>
acylphenylalanine that is useful as a raw material of pharmaceutical products and<br>
the like.		<br>
Background Art<br>
Among methods for producing an acylamino acid, the acylamino acid containing impurities as little as possible may be obtained by reacting a carboxyhc acid corresponding to an acyl group with an amino acid ester in the presence of a condensing agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and then hydrolyzing the ester. However, because the method requires preparation of an amino acid ester once and usage of an expensive condensing agent, it has a disadvantage in high production cost.<br>
As regards another method for producing an acylamino acid, which uses an amino acid instead for an amino acid ester, it is known that the acylamino acid may be obtained by reacting a carboxyhc acid with N-hydroxy succinimide in the presence of DCC and the hke to form an activated ester, and then reacting the activated ester with an amino acid. However, because the method also requires usage of an expensive condensing agent and its jaeld is not high, it raises the production cost.<br>
At present, as regards the method for producing an acylamino acid at low cost, Schotten-Baumann reaction is considered to be the most industrially-superior<br><br>
reaction, wherein an acid chloride and an amino acid are reacted in an aqueous solvent under the alkali condition. The reaction is used for the production of various acylamino acids.<br>
Though Schotten-Baumann reaction tried to be appUed to the production of acylphenylalanine, it was found that impurities were produced in the reaction and they were not easily removed.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for preventing the production of impurities when acylphenylalanine is produced by using industrially-superior Schotten-Baumann reaction.<br>
The inventors have closely examined the impurities which are by-product formed through the production of acylphenylalanine by using Schotten-Baumann reaction and found that the impurities are acylphenylalanyl-phenylalanine (AcPP), wherein acylphenylalanine is further combined with phenylalanine.<br>
For the purpose of preventing the production of AcPP, the inventors have vigorously studied and unexpectedly found that the purpose can be easily achieved by using potassium hydroxide as a neutralizing agent in the reaction. The present invention has been completed on the basis of this finding. The present invention includes the following each invention:<br>
(1)	A method for producing acylphenylalanine, which comprises the step of reacting an acid chloride with phenylalanine in a mixed solvent of an organic solvent and water, while keeping the solvent under the alkali condition by using potassium hydroxide.<br>
(2)	The method according to (1), wherein pH of the mixed solvent is not less than 12.5.<br><br>
(3)	The method according to (1), wherein pH of the mixed solvent is not less than 13.5.<br>
(4)	The method according to (1), wherein a mixed ratio of the organic solvent to water in the mixed solvent is 10:90 to 80:20 by volume.<br>
(5)	The method according to (1), wherein a mixed ratio of the organic solvent to water in the mixed solvent is 15:85 to 40:60 by volume.<br>
(6)	The method according to (1), wherein the acid chloride is a saturated or unsaturated acid chloride having 2 to 22 carbon atoms.<br>
(7)	The method according to (1), wherein the acid chloride is selected from a group consisting of caproic chloride, caprylic chloride, capric chloride, lauric chloride, myristic chloride, palmitic chloride, stearic chloride, oleic chloride, cyclohexylcarbonyl	chloride,	methylcyclohexylcarbonyl	chloride, ethylcyclohexylcarbonyl chloride, propylcyclohexylcarbonyl	chloride, isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, toluoyl chloride, sahcyloyl chloride, cinnamoyl chloride, naphthoyl chloride and nicotinic chloride.<br>
(8)	The method according to (1), wherein the acid chloride is isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl chloride.<br>
(9)	The method according to (1), whereia the organic solvent in the mixed solvent is selected from a group consisting of acetone, methylethylketone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrUe, methanol, ethanol andisopropyl alcohol.<br>
(10)	The method according to (9), wherein the organic solvent in the mixed solvent is acetone.<br>
(11)	A method for producing acylphenylalanine, which comprises the steps of adding an acid chloride dropwise to a solution containing phenylalanine and potassium hydroxide in a mixed solvent of an organic solvent and water, while keeping the pH of the solution under the alkali condition by using potassium<br><br>
hydroxide.<br>
(12)	The method according to (11), wherein pH is not less than 12.5.<br>
(13)	The method according to (11), wherein a mixed ratio of the organic solvent to water in the mixed solvent is 10:90 to 80:20 by volume.<br>
Best Mode for Carrjdng out the Invention<br>
An acid chloride used in the present invention is not particularly Hmited but<br>
usually a saturated or unsaturated acid chloride having 2 to 22 carbon atoms, and<br>
preferably 6 to 18 carbon atoms. Examples thereof include an acid chloride<br>
derived from a fatty acid such as caproic acid, capryhc acid, capric acid, lauric acid,<br>
myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid; cyclohexylcarbonyl chloride,<br>
methylcyclohexylcarbonyl        chloride,	ethylcyclohexylcarbonyl	chloride,<br>
propylcyclohexylcarbonyl chloride, isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, toluoyl chloride, salicyloyl chloride, cinnamoyl chloride, naphthoyl chloride and nicotinic chloride.   They may contain a substituent(s).<br>
Further, the acid chloride of the present invention also includes alkyloxycarbonyl chloride such as methoxycarbonyl chloride and t-butoxycarbonyl chloride, and aryloxycarbonyl chloride such as benzyloxycarbonyl chloride in addition to the alkylcarbonyl chloride and the arylcarbonyl chloride.<br>
An aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide is used for adjusting pH in the reaction. If the pH of the reaction mixture is not less than 10, the reaction proceeds without any problems, however, the higher pH of the reaction mixture is preferable because it prevents the generation of AcPP. Preferable pH is not less than 12, more preferably not less than 12.5, further more preferably not less than 13 and further more particularly preferably not less than 13.5. However, as the reaction mixture is sometimes colored in case pH is more than 14, the pH needs to<br><br>
be carefully adjusted when coloring should be avoided. Though the pH may-deviate from the above range in adjusting it, if temporary, it does not particularly cause problem as the temporary deviance does not have a negative impact. The value of pH is herein indicated by a reading of a pH meter with glass electrodes. The concentration of the aqueous potassium hydroxide solution is not particularly hmited, but usually 2 to 50% by weight, preferably 5 to 25% by weight.<br>
The organic solvents herein used are those which may be miscible with water. For example, they include acetone, methylethylketone, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, propanol andisopropanol, and especially acetone is preferred.<br>
The mixed ratio of an organic solvent to water depends on the acid chlorides used and therefore, can not be generally defined. However, it is usually 10:90 to 80:20 and preferably 15:85 to 40:60. The lower ratio of the organic solvent tends to prevent the production of by-product, AcPR However, when an acyl group contains a large number of carbon atoms, which leads to an intended compound being high hydrophobicity, the ratio of the organic solvent needs to be heightened in order to prevent the compound from prepicitationand solidification during the reaction. The ratio herein indicates a volume ratio of an organic solvent to water and an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide added at the start point of the reaction.<br>
The temperature and the concentration of the reaction also can not be generally defined, because they depend on the add chlorides used and the reaction solvents used. However, the reaction temperature is usually -5 to 25°C and preferably 0 to 15 °C. The reaction concentration is usually 1 to 20% and preferably 2 to 10%. Their appropriate conditions can be determined in view of their yields, operationality and productivity.<br><br>
As for the reaction methods, the following method can be apphed, for instance. First, phenylalanine is dissolved in water by using approximate equivalent molar amount of aqueous potassium hydroxide solution and an organic solvent is added thereto. Aqueous potassium hydroxide solution is further added to adjust pH. Then an acid chloride is added dropwise with stirring. The drop time is preferably from about 15 minutes to about 2 hours. The molar ratio of phenylalanine to an acid chloride such as trans-4-isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl chloride used in the reaction is suitably 0.5:1 to 2:1, preferably 0.9:1 to 1.5:1. The concentration in the reaction of phenylalanine with the acid chloride such as trans-4-isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl chloride is preferably 2wt% to 15wt% in terms of the concentration of phenylalanine, when each substance is within the above range. The acylphenylalanine produced can be crystaUized by making the reaction mixture acidic with hydrochloric acid and the hke, filtered out, and taken out by being washed with water.<br>
Examples<br>
The following Examples will further illustrate the present invention, which by no means hmit the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
17 ml of water and 10.5 ml of 10% potassium hydroxide aqueous solution were added to 4.2 g of phenylalanine to dissolve it. 50 ml of acetone was added thereto and cooled to about 10°C. 5.5 g of trans-4-isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl chloride (purity: about 95%) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. In the meanwhile, 10% potassium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the reaction mixture, while keeping the pH of the mixture being 10.5 to 11.0.    Then, the<br><br>
reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC to calculate an area ratio of impurities [trans-4-isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl phenylalanyl-phenylalanine (IPP)] to an intended compound (trans-4-isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl phenylalanine). The result is shown in Table 1.<br>
Examples 2 to 6<br>
The following reactions of Examples 2 to 6 were conducted by using 10% potassium hydroxide aqueous solution and by the same procedure as that of Example 1, except that the concentration of the organic solvents and the pH in the reaction were changed as shown in Table 1. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by HPLC in a similar manner to that of Example 1. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
Examples 7 to 9<br>
44 ml of water and 16 ml of 10% potassium hydroxide aqueous solution were added to 4 g of phenylalanine to dissolve it. 15 ml of acetone was added thereto and cooled down to about 10°C.    5.3 g of trans-4-isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl<br><br>
chloride was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. In the meanwhile, 10% potassium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the reaction mixture, while keeping the pH of the mixture being the values shown in Table 2. Then, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by HPLC in a similar manner to that of Example 1.    The results are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
Examples 10 to 12<br>
The following reactions of Examples 10 to 12 were conducted by the same procedure as that of Examples 7 to 9, except that the concentration of the organic solvents were changed and pH was 13.6 to 13.9. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by HPLC in a similar manner to that of Example 1. The results are shown in Table 3.<br><br><br>
17 ml of water and 10.5 ml of 10% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution were added to 4.2 g of phenylalanine to dissolve it. 50 ml of acetone was added thereto and cooled down to about 10 °C. 5.5 g of trans-4-isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl chloride (purity: about 95%) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. In the meanwhile, 10% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the reaction mixture, while keeping the pH of the mixture being 10 to 10.5. Then, the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC to calculate an area ratio of impurities [trans-4-isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl phenylalanyl-phenylalanine (IPP)] to an intended compound (trans-4-isopropylcyclohexylcarbonyl phenylalanine). The result is shown in Table 4.<br>
Comparative Examples 2 to 5<br>
The following reactions of Comparative Examples 2 to 5 were conducted by using 10% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and by the same procedure as that of Comparative Example 1 except that the ratio of the organic solvents and the pH in the reaction were changed. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by HPLC in a similar manner to that of Comparative Example 1. The results are shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
It is apparent from comparison between the results of each Example and those of each Comparative Example described in Tables 1 to 4 that the production of IPP, which are impurities, can be considerably prevented by using potassium hydroxide aqueous solution as an alkali used in the reaction. Further, it is apparent from Examples 1 to 6 wherein the potassium hydroxide aqueous solution is used as an alkali that the lower concentration of the organic solvent (acetone) can prevent the production of IPP more effectively. However, in the methods wherein the starting materials of Examples 1 to 6 are used, it was confirmed that less usage amount of an acetone solvent than that of Example 6, for example, less than 10%, solidified the reaction mixture and made the continuation of the reaction difficult.<br>
