				<td>A VERSATILE PROCESS FOR THE OXIDATION OF CARBINOLS TO CARBONYLS TRIPHASE CATALYTIC CONDITION<br>
This invention relates to a novel process for oxidation of carbinols to carbonyls, a very important class of organic compounds used as precursors of various fine chemicals including drugs, vitamins, fragrances, perfumery, beverage and food industry apart from being a flavoring agent, solvents for resins, lacquers, dyes, nylon etc. This invention particularly relates to a novel method for oxidation of carbinols to carbonyls by triphase catalysis. The resin bound phase transfer catalyst (PTC) has been used for the oxidation of such compounds with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of sodium tungstate catalyst in a suitable solvent. Hydrogen peroxide is the best oxidant with respect to environmental and economic considerations.<br>
The hitherto known methods for preparation of important carbonyl compounds from their corresponding carbinols are<br>
1.	J. Dong; J Chem Res (s), 6,206, 1997<br>
In this method, preparation of aldehyde and ketones has been reported to be done by the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols of the formula 1 in which R1 represents alkyl or aryl group, R2 represents H, alkyl, aryl etc with K2Cr2O7 in a benzene water system.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
SCHEME -1<br>
The drawback of this method is that chromium reagents and benzene which are used, are highly toxic.<br>

Scherm; H.E. Jackson; U. S. Patent  6,825,384<br>
Prakash et al have carried out the oxidation of alcohols selectively to aldehydes with NaOCI using a TEMPO-borate catalyst system. It was shown that the oxidation could be efficiently carried out without KBr additives under solvent free<br>
conditions. Aldehydes such as 3, 3-dimethylbutyraldehyde can be produced efficiently by this method.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
SCHEME - 2<br>
The drawback of this method is that it is specific for certain type of molecules. 3     T.Mallat; A. Barker; Chem. Review 104 (6), 3037, 2004 In this method oxidation of secondary alcohol of the formula 1 in which R1 represents alkyl or aryl group, R2 represents H, alkyl, aryl etc has been reported to be carried out in water using molecular oxygen under the catalytic influence of detergent.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
SCHEME - 3<br>
The drawback is that the gas phase reaction is cumbersome to carry out.<br>
4.	S.Dorit; P. Kozner; L Asters; J. Amer. Chem. Soc.125, 5280-5281, 2003<br>
Dorit et al have reported that polyoxometalate a "self assembled" water-soluble<br>
catalyst can very conveniently oxidize alcohols to carbonyls with hydrogen peroxide in water.<br>

SCHEME-4<br>
The catalyst has the advantage of recycling but the yield is very poor.<br>
5.	P. Alsters; V. Schmieden H. Elisabeth; U.S Patent, 6,593,494<br>
In this method alcohol of the formula 1 in which R1 represents alkyl or aryl group, R2   represents H, alkyl, aryl etc was oxidized to the corresponding acid in the<br>
presence of periodate, catalytic amount of dichromate, an acid in water, and/or water/ organic solvent at a temperature range of -20 °C to +50 °C.<br>

(Scheme Removed) <br>
SCHEME - 7<br>

Patent 6, 933,405 Thottumkara et. al. have reported a user and eco-friendly hyper-valent iodine reagent (IBX), that selectively oxidises allylic and benzylic alcohols of the formula 9 in which R represents allyl or benzyl group in water and / or other eco-friendly solvents to the corresponding aldehydes.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>

But the design of the oxidant is cumbersome.<br>
11.	P. Bragd; A. C. Besemer; U. S. Patent 6,936,710<br>
In this method it is reported that primary hydroxyl groups in a substrate having both primary and secondary hydroxyl groups can be selectively oxidized to carbaldehyde and/or carboxyl groups by contacting the substrate with a cyclic nitroxyl compound in the presence of a peroxosulfate as a co-oxidant and by carrying out the reaction at a temperature below 30 °degree and at a pH below 9.<br>

SCHEME-12<br>
This method has the drawback of maintaining the anaerobic condition Oxidation of carbinols to carbonyl compounds is a very important fundamental reaction. However, preparation of such important compounds in an environmentally friendly and cost effective way have still been a challenge to the organic chemists. It is therefore, desirable to have an efficient and versatile method to<br>
obtain such important class of compounds in one step, eliminating the drawbacks stated earlier.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The major objective of the present invention is to provide a novel and efficient method for oxidation of carbinols to carbonyls.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an environment friendly method of preparation for oxidation of carbinols to carbonyls.<br>
More particularly the objective of the present invention is to provide a process for oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols of the formula R1R2CHOH as shown in the Scheme -13 at temperature range of 50-90°C in a suitable organic solvent such as dichloroethane or water using 50% hydrogen peroxide in the presence of sodium tungstate to produce the corresponding aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters avoiding the drawbacks summarized above in the hitherto known processes.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel method for oxidation of carbinols of the formula R1R2CHOH as shown in the Scheme -13 in which R1, R2 represents alkyl, aralkyl, carbocyclic, aryl etc using 50% H2O2 and sodium tungstate in the presence of basic Amberlite resin (IR-400) at an ambient temperature.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an eco-friendly and cost effective method for oxidation of carbinols to carbonyls using H2O2 and sodium tungstate in the presence of Amberlite resin (IR-400) in water at an ambient temperature.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an eco-friendly and cost effective method for oxidation of carbinols to carbonyls using H2O2 and sodium tungstate in the presence of Amberlite basic resin in an ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate at around 50 °C. The oxidation of carbinols using H2O2, sodium tungstate under triphase catalytic conditions at ambient temperature gives primarily ketones from the secondary alcohols. Primary aliphatic and aromatic alcohols give aldehydes and carboxylic acids accompanied by trace amount of esters. The solid supported triphase<br>
system can be very conveniently carried out at an ambient temperature to give the corresponding carbonyl compounds within 5-16 hrs with 60-95% yield. The result obtained is novel and non obvious. The basic Amberlite resin has found application in cation exchange reaction only. Summary of the invention<br>
