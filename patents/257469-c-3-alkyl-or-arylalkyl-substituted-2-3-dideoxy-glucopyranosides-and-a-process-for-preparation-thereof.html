				<td>The present invention relates to a novel series of anti-tubercular multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl or arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides having general formula 6a and 6b respectively<br>
(FigureRemoved) <br><br>
wherein R represents aryl groups selected from the groups consisting of mono, di, tri, substituted phenyl groups, mono, di, tri, substituted aromatic heterocyclic groups and alkyl groups selected from the groups consisting of all alkyl groups containing upto ten carbons and all their amino and hydroxyl substituted derivatives and trihalomethyl group , while R' represents, hydrogen, alkyl acyl groups selected from the groups consisting of acetyl and pivaloyl and aryl acyl group represented by p-nitrobenzoyl and different alkyl chlorides like ter/-butyldimethylsilyl and terf-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride and while R" represents alkyl groups selected from groups consisting of methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, and sugars and OR" as a whole represents thiol and all substituted thiols. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of novel multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl and - arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides.<br>
This invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of novel multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl and - arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides, a new series of anti-tubercular agents.<br>
These unsaturated 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides of general formula 6a and 6b are new chemical compounds and they had not been prepared earlier.<br>
More specifically the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel<br>
series of multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl and - arylalkyl substituted 2,3-<br>
dideoxy glucopyranosides of general formula 6a and 6b.<br>
These unsaturated C-3-alkyl and - arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides are<br>
novel compounds and are useful as anti-tubercular agents. These compounds have been<br>
tested against M.  tuberculosis H37RV by agar dilution method and some of these<br>
compounds have shown promising anti-tubercular activity. The invention thus relates to<br>
the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
Several of these novel compounds are showing promising anti-tubercular activity against<br>
M. tuberculosis //j/^by agar dilution method.<br>
Background of the present invention<br>
Tuberculosis (TB), a chronic bacterial infection is a leading cause of death worldwide, from a single infectious agent [(a) Dolin, P. J.; Raviglione, M. C.; Kochi, A. Bull. WHO 1994, 72, 213; (b) Huebner, R. E.; Castro, K. G. Ann. Rev. Med. 1995, 46, 47]. TB is caused by mycobacterium of the 'tuberculosis complex', including M. bovis, M. affricanum but mainly by M. tuberculosis [Pasqualoto, K. F. M.; Ferreira, E. I. Current Drug Target 2001, 2, 427]. According to WHO estimates roughly one-third of the world's population is latently infected with the tuberculosis bacteria [Farmer, P.; Bayona, J.; Becerra, M.; Furin, J.; Henry, C.; Hiatt, H.; Kim, J. Y.; Mitnick, C.; Nardell, E.; Shin, S. Int. J. Tuberc. LungDis. 1998, 2, 869].<br>
It is a worse killer than malaria and AIDS combined. It is estimated that by 2020 A.D. nearly one billion more people will be infected, 200 million people will get sick and 70 million will die from tuberculosis if proper steps to control it are not taken. [ (a) Daffe, M.; Draper, P. Adv. Microb. Physiol 1998,39,131; (b) WHO Global tuberculosis programme- Tuberculosis Fact Sheet, 1998. (http://www.who.int/gtb/publication/index. htm#Report)].<br>
In all, there are approximately 70 species in the genus Mycobacterium, many of which are opportunistic pathogens in humans and animals, while others like M. avium are<br>
emerging pathogens most notably in AIDS patients [Iran, T.; Saheba, E.; Arcerio, A.V.; Chavez, V.;Li, Q.; Martinez, L.E; Primm, T.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004,12,4809.].<br>
The AIDS pandemic has had a big impact on worldwide TB prevalence. One-third of the increase in the incidences of the TB in the last 5 years can be attributed to co-infection with HIV [Rattan, A.; Kalia, A. and Ahmad, N. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1998, 4, 195].The other factor responsible for increase in TB cases is the emergence of the so called MDR-TB, resistant to some or all currently known TB drugs. Emergence of MDR-TB is a result of lack of patient's compliance with long term chemotherapy, prescription of wrong drugs or wrong combination of drugs by doctors and health workers, unreliable drug supply, delay in diagnosis, variable efficacy of BCG vaccines and various other factors such as unavailability of drugs in remote areas of certain high risk regions, [(a) WHO Global tuberculosis programme- Tuberculosis Fact Sheet, 1998. [http://www.who.int/gtb/publication/index. htm#Report]. (b) WHO - Country Profiles: Brazil. Annual Report, 1997. [http://www.who.int]. (c) Rattan, A.; Kalia, A. and Ahmad, N. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1998,4, 195. (d) Chopra, P., Meena, I. S., Singh, Y. Indian J. Med. ^-.,2003,7,117].<br>
MDR-TB is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to treat with an ever rising mortality rate that raises the specter that TB will once again become an incurable disease [Pathak, A. K.; Pathak, V.; Maddry, J. A.; Suling, W. J.;Gurcha, S. S.; Besra, G. S.; Reynolds, R. C. Bioorg. Med.Chem. 2001,9, 3145]. Current strategy for treatment of TB involves use of front line drugs like INH, rifampin, PZA and ethambutol for two months followed by four months of follow up treatment with INH and rifampin [Bass, J. B., Jr.; Farer, L. S.; Hopewell, P.C.; O'Brien, R.; Jacobs, R. F.; Ruben, F.; Snider, D. E., Jr.; Thornton, G., the American Thoracic Society. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994,149, 1359]. However this combination therapy is not always successful in case of MDR suspected patients. The latest anti-TB drug was introduced almost 30 years ago when the problem of MDR-TB and co-infection with HIV did not exist and thus to effectively combat these problems there is an urgent need for development of new anti TB drugs that have unique mechanisms of action from presently used anti-tubercular drugs with improved properties such as enhanced activity against MDR strains [(a) Pathak, A. K.; Pathak, V.; Seitz, L.; Maddry, J. A.;Gurcha, S. S.; Besra, G. S.; Suling, W. J.; Reynolds,<br>
R. C.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001, P, 3129.(b) Pathak, A. K.; Pathak, V.; Maddry, J. A.; Suling, W. J.; Gurcha, S. S.; Besra, G. S.; Reynolds, R. C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001, 9, 3145.(14) (c) C.A. no. 90: 152534y Wojtowicz, M; Wienlawski, W.Acta Pol. Pharm. 1978, 35, 37. (d) C.A. no. 89: 110253e Wojtowicz, M.; Wienlawski, W. Acta Pol. Pharm. 1977, 34, 575]. These molecules should be effective against latent TB, should have shortened duration of therapy thereby reducing chances of non-compliance of patients and should also ideally have reduced toxicity, rapid mycobactericidal mechanism of action and the ability to penetrate host cells and exert anti-mycobacterial effects in the intra cellular environments [Panda, G.; Siddiqui, S.; Mishra, J. K.; Chaturvedi, V.; Srivastava, A. K.; Srivastava, R.; Srivastava, B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2004,12, 5629].<br>
The recent report [Cole, S.T.; Brosch, R.; Parkhill, J.; et al. Nature 1998, 393, 537] on complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has provided a more rational and directional approach to the search for new drug targets. In general, gene products involved in mycobacterial metabolism, persistence, transcription, synthesis of cell-wall and virulence would be possible targets for the new drug development [Chopra, P., Meena, I. S., Singh, Y. Indian J. Med. Res., 2003,1,117].<br>
The intrinsic resistance of the TB bacilli to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents can be ascribed to its unique and intricate cell wall structure which is made up of polysaccharides, proteins and lipids [Khasnobis, S.; Escuyer, V. E.; Chatterjee, D. Espert Opin.Ther. Targets 2002, 6,21].<br>
The sugar components in these polysaccharides have been identified as L-rhamnose, D-arabinofuranose and D-galactofuranose which have no role in mammalian metabolism [Lee, R.E.; Smith, M.D.; Pickering, L.; Fleet, G.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999, 40, 8689] thus making the biochemistry and attendant enzyme pathways ideal targets for the development of new,potent and selective antimycobacterial agents [Pathak, A. K.; Pathak, V.; Maddry, J. A.; Suling, W. J.; Gurcha, S. S.; Besra, G. S.; Reynolds, R. C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001, P, 3145].<br>
Due to the easy availability of carbohydrates as sources of metabolic energy, their high tolerance [Fischer, J. F.; Harrison, A.W.; Bundy, G.L.; Wilkinson, K.F.; Rush, B.D.; Ruwart, M. J. J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34 , 4140], improved pharmacokinetics [Negre, E.;<br><br>
Chance, M. L.; Hanbuta, S. Y.; Monsigny, M.; Roche, A. C.; Mayer, R. M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992, 35, 2228], better transport [Wolform, M. L.; Hanessian, S. J. Org. Chem. 1962, 27, 1800], low toxicity and their role in recognition phenomena many of which are of great pharmacological relevance [Cipolla, L.; Ferla, B. L.; Nicotra, F. Carbohydr. Polym. 1998, 37, 291], much effort is being focused towards the development of carbohydrate-based therapeutics during the last few years [McAuliffe, J.; Hindsgaul, 0. Chemistry and Industry 1997, 170]. However, current efforts are mainly directed towards the development of small molecules which are more stable, more active and whose synthesis can be easily developed [Wong, C-H. Acc.Chem. Res. 1999, 32, 376]. Certain sugar derivatives and glucofuranose analogues have been reported as antitubercular agents recently [(a) Tripathi, R.P.; Tewari, N.; Dwivedi, N.; tewari, V. K. Medicinal Research Reviews 2005, 25, 93. (b) Maddry, J. A.; Bansal, N.; Bermudez, L. E.; Comber, R.N.; Orme, W. J.; Suling, W. J.; Wilson, L. N.; Raynolds, R. C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998, 8, 237. (c) John, T.B.; Varalakshmi, D.; Todd, S.; Takayama, K.; Patrick, J. B.; Besra, G.S. Science 1997, 39, 1420. (d) Chung, G. A.; Aktar, Z.; Jackson, S.; Duncan, K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995,39,2235. (e) Namane, M.; Goujette, C.; Pillion, M.P.; Pillion, J.; Huynh, T.; Dinh, J. J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35, 3039]. During the past decades, deoxysugars, a distinct class of carbohydrates, have received special attention due to their thermal stability, hydrophobicity and important role in lipopolysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, where they serve as ligands for cell-cell interactions or as targets for toxins, antibiotics and microorganisms [Hallis, T. M.; Liu, H-W. Ace Chem.Res. 1999,32,579].<br>
In our ongoing programme on the search of new anti-tubercular agents we have been focusing our efforts on the synthesis of easily available monosaccharide derived anti-tubercular agents [(a) Gupta, M. K.; Sagar, R.; Shaw, A.K.; Prabhakar, Y. S. Bioorg. Med.Chem.2005,13,343. (b) Pathak, R.; Pant, C. S.; Shaw, A. K.; Bhaduri, A. P.; Gaikwad, A. N.; Sinha, S.; Srivastava, A.; Srivastava, K. K.; Chaturvedi, V.; Srivastava, R.; Srivastava, B. S. Bioorg. Med. Chem.20Q2, 10, 3187. (c) Pathak, R.; Shaw, A. K.; Bhaduri, A. P.; Chandrasekhar,K. V. G.; Srivastava, A.; Srivastava, K. K.; Chaturvedi, V.;Srivastava, R.; Srivastava, B. S.; Arora, S.; Sinha, S. Bioorg. Med.Chem.2W2,l 0,1695].<br>
These molecules are chain extended acyclic or cyclic deoxysugar derivatives. We found from the literature survey on antimicrobial activity of cyclic deoxysugars that 2//-pyran-3(6//)-one derivatives (I) and related compounds showed good activity against gram-positive bacteria [Georgiadis, M.P.; Couladouros, E.A.; Delitheos, A. K. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992, 1126]. The derivatives of I are components of naturally occurring anthracycline antibiotics and many new synthetic derivatives of I have been reported exhibiting several biological activities. It was reported that the double bond of the compound I is essential for their antimicrobial activity [Georgiadis, M.P. J. Med .Chem. 1976, 19, 346]. It was also mentioned in the report [Georgiadis, M.P.; Couladouros, E.A.; Delitheos, A. K. J. Pharm. Sci 1992, 1126] that ether or ester functionality at C-l (at anomeric position) and bulky group at C-6 enhanced antimicrobial activity [Laliberte, R.; Medawar, G.; Lefebvre, Y. J. Med .Chem. 1973, 16, 1084]. In continuation of our endeavor to develop new anti-tubercular molecules we were interested to synthesize unsaturated C-3-alkyl and -arylalkyl 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides and investigate their ability to act as antitubercular agents due to some specific reasons:<br>
Firstly our group had earlier reported anti TB activity in acyclic deoxy monosaccharide derivatives prepared via Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction between a,p-unsaturated sugar aldehydes and activated olefins [(a) Gupta, M. K.; Sagar, R.; Shaw, A.K.; Prabhakar, Y. S. Bioorg. Med. Ozew.2005, 13, 343. (b) Pathak, R.; Pant, C. S.; Shaw, A. K.; Bhaduri, A. P.; Gaikwad, A. N.; Sinha, S.; Srivastava, A.; Srivastava, K. K.; Chaturvedi, V.; Srivastava, R.; Srivastava, B. S. Bioorg. Med Chem. 2002, 10, 3187. (c) Pathak, R.; Shaw, A. K.; Bhaduri, A. P.; Chandrasekhar, K. V. G.; Srivastava, A.; Srivastava, K. K.; Chaturvedi, V.;Srivastava, R.; Srivastava, B. S.; Arora, S.; Sinha, S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002,10,1695].<br>
Secondly cyclic deoxy sugars are known to be biologically important compounds, being structural components of several antibiotics and other important naturally occurring molecules [Georgiadis, M.P. J. Med .Chem. 1976, 19, 346]. These sugar derivatives can be derived by replacing one hydroxyl group from common sugars with a hydrogen or non-0-linked functional group [Laliberte, R.; Medawar, G.; Lefebvre, Y. J. Med .Chem. 1973, 16, 1084]. Such a substitution brings a fundamental change in the chemical<br>
properties of the resulting sugar enhancing its thermodynamic stability and hydrophobicity.<br>
Thirdly our belief was further strengthened by the report of Elias. A. Couladouros et al that derivatives of 2//-pyran-3(6#)-one (I) having structure very similar to unsaturated C-3-alkyl and -arylalkyl 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides exhibit significant antibacterial, antifungal, anticoccidial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties besides serving as intermediates in several natural product syntheses [Laliberte, R.; Medawar, G.; Lefebvre, Y..7. Med.Chem. 1973,16, 1084]. (FigureRemoved)<br>
Encouraged by the above literature report on antimicrobial properties of 2/f-pyran-3(6//)-one derivatives (I) and related compounds [(a)Georgiadis, M.P.; Couladouros, E.A.; Delitheos, A. K. J. Pharm. Sci 1992, 1126 , (b) Couladouros, E.A.; Strongilos, A.T. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl, 2002, 41, 3677] and the intriguing biological properdes of deoxysugars, we were prompted to develop the synthesis of C-3 branched enones derivatives of type I as antimycobacterial agents. Various synthetic methods have been reported for I and their derivatives [For the preparation of 2//-pyran-3(6//)-one derivatives (I) see references 1-9 in Georgiadis, M.P.; Couladouros, E.A.; Delitheos, A. K. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992, 1126]. However, based on the retro-synthetic scheme we identified deoxy enulosides 5a-c as a versatile synthetic intermediates to synthesize various molecules of the type I involving Morita-Baylis-Hillman chemistry [Basavaiah, D.; Rao, A. J.; Satyanarayana, T. Chem. Rev. 2003,103, 811 &amp; references cited therein].<br>
In this endeavor we recently developed Morita-Baylis-Hillman chemistry of unsaturated C-3 branched deoxysugars [Sagar, R.; Pant, C. S.; Pathak, R.; Shaw, A. K. Tetrahedron<br>
2004, 60, 11399] and now we wish to report herein the in vitro antimycobacterial activity of these deoxysugar derivatives.<br>
The unpublished compounds of the series 6a are different from the published compounds of the series in terms of the R group used while in the case of 6b series the unpublished compounds differ from the published compounds both in terms of the R group used and their stereochemistry at C-4. While all the published compounds of series 6b have threo configuration the unpublished compounds of series 6b have erythro configuration.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide novel multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl and - arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides as anti-tubercular compounds.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide novel multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl and -arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides as promising anti-tubercular compounds which are better and have more potential for further exploitation, than most of the previously known anti-tubercular molecules, as they are derived from monosaccharides which are known for their easy availability as sources of metabolic energy, high tolerance [Fischer, J. F.; Harrison, A.W.; Bundy, G.L.; Wilkinson, K.F.; Rush, B.D.; Ruwart, M. J. J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34 , 4140], improved pharmacokinetics [Negre, E.; Chance, M. L.; Hanbuta, S. Y.; Monsigny, M.; Roche, A. C.; Mayer, R. M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992, 35, 2228], better transport [Wolform, M. L.; Hanessian, S. J. Org. Chem. 1962, 27, 1800], low toxicity and their role in recognition phenomena many of which are of great pharmacological relevance [Cipolla, L.; Ferla, B. L.; Nicotra, F. Carbohydr. Polym. 1998, 37, 291], and therefore have greater compatibility to the human body (living system) and thus are very suitable candidates for the development of new drugs.<br>
Further these compounds being multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl and -arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides derivatives are better from previously known anti-tubercular compounds because these novel molecules reported herein are deoxysugars, a distinct class of carbohydrates, which are thermally stable, hydrophobic in nature and play an important role in lipopolysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, where they serve as ligands for cell-cell interactions or as targets for toxins, antibiotics<br><br>
and microorganisms and because of these properties they have received special attention during the last few decades. [Hallis, T. M; Liu, H-W. Ace. Chem. Res. 1999, 32, 579]. Lastly, as it is being taken into account nowadays that small molecules are more stable, more active and whose synthesis can be easily developed [Wong, C-H. Ace. Chem. Res. 1999, 32, 376] therefore, these novel class of antitubercular compounds being monosaccharide derivatives (small molecules) are better from previously known carbohydrate derived anti-tubercular molecules most of which are macromolecules like oligosaccharides (antibiotics) or part of other large molecules. The significance of these novel molecules reported in this invention as lead molecules for the development of a new anti-TB drug can very well be gauged from the above arguments. Another major objective of the present invention is to provide novel multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl and -arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides of general formula 6a and 6b which show promising in vitro activity against M. tuberculosis /fj7/?v. Accordingly, the present invention provides novel multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl and -arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides 6aa, 6ab, 6ac, 6ad, 6ae, 6af, 6ag, 6ah, 6ai, 6aj, 6ak, 6ba, 6bb, 6bc, 6bd, 6be, 6bf, 6bg, 6bh which show in-vitro activity against M. tuberculosis H3?RV in a MIC range of 50 jxg/ml to 1.56 (o,g/ml. The objective of the present invention is also to provide a process for the preparation of novel multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl and -arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides of general formula 6a and 6b, a new series of novel compounds useful as anti-tubercular agents.<br>

ADVANTAGES<br>
i) All the compounds of series 6a and 6b reported in this invention are novel. They have<br>
been reported for the first time.<br>
ii) The compounds of series 6a and 6b reported in this invention have been reported to<br>
show anti-TB activity for the first time. The compounds 6aa, 6ab, 6ac, 6ad, 6ae, 6af,<br>
6ag, 6ah, 6ai, 6aj, 6ak, 6ba, 6bb, 6bc, 6bd, 6be, 6bf, 6bg, 6bh have been reported to<br>
show in-vitro activity against M. tuberculosis //37^?v in a MIC range of 50 ng/ml to 1.56<br>
ug/ml.<br>
iii) The most active compounds of series 6a and 6b reported in this invention showed little or no cytotoxicity on being tested on VERO cell line.<br>
iv) The novel compounds of series 6a and 6b are promising anti-tubercular compounds which are better and have more potential for further exploitation, than most of the previously known anti-tubercular molecules, as they are derived from monosaccharides which are known for their easy availability as sources of metabolic energy, high tolerance improved pharmacokinetics, better transport, low toxicity and their role in recognition phenomena many of which are of great pharmacological relevance, and therefore have greater compatibility to the human body (living system) and thus are very suitable candidates for the development of new drugs.<br>
Further these compounds being multifunctionalized unsaturated C-3-alkyl and -arylalkyl substituted 2,3-dideoxy glucopyranosides derivatives are better from previously known anti-tubercular compounds because these are deoxysugars. Deoxysugars a distinct class of carbohydrates, which are thermally stable, hydrophobic in nature and play an important role in lipopolysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, where they serve as ligands for cell-cell interactions or as targets for toxins, antibiotics and microorganisms and because of these properties they have received special attention during the last few decades. Lastly, as it is being taken into account nowadays that small molecules are more stable, more active and their synthesis can be easily developed therefore, these novel class of antitubercular compounds being monosaccharide derivatives (small molecules) are better from previously known carbohydrate derived anti-tubercular molecules most of which are macromolecules like oligosaccharides (antibiotics) or part of other large molecules. The significance of these novel molecules reported in this invention as lead molecules for the development of a new anti-TB drug can very well be gauged from the above arguments.<br>
v) All the compounds of series 6a and 6b reported in this invention have been prepared by reacting protected 2,3-dideoxy hexenopyranoside-4-uloses of formula 5 with different aldehydes using Morita-Baylis-Hillman chemistry. Morita-Baylis Hillman (MBH) chemistry has been recognized as one of the most versatile and more economically feasible C-C bond forming reactions to generate multifunctionalized allylic alcohols generally called MBH or BH adducts. Use of this methodology thus provides a most<br>
versatile and economically viable route for the preparation of a large number of BH<br>
adducts of 6a series using different aldehydes and their reduced forms (6b series).<br>
vi) The compounds of series 6a and 6b were prepared using easily available, inexpensive<br>
and benign reagents like TiCU and TBAI in dichloromethane.<br>
vii) Taking into consideration points (i) to (vi) leads to the conclusion that the novel<br>
series of compounds 6a and 6b provide a new, most promising lead for the development<br>
of a potent new anti -TB drug. This importance of this invention lies in the fact that it<br>
provides a new, entirely different lead for the development of a potent new anti -TB drug<br>
based upon monosaccharide derived 2-deoxy sugar opening up a new, promising, hitherto<br>
unexplored chapter in the race for the development of a badly needed potent new anti-TB<br>
drug.<br>
ANTITUBERCULAR ACTIVITY Agar dilution method<br>
Briefly, 2-fold serial dilutions of each test compound/drug were incorporated into 7H10 agar. Inoculum of M. tuberculosis H37Rv was prepared from fresh Lowenstein-Jensen slants adjusted to 1 mg/mL (wet weight) in Tween 80 (0.05%) saline and diluted to 10"2 to give a concentration of approximately 107 cfu/mL. 5 mL of bacterial suspension was spotted into 7H10 agar tubes containing 2-fold serial dilution of drugs per mL. The tubes were incubated at 37°C and final readings were recorded after 30 days. The MICs were read as the minimum concentration of drugs/compounds that completely inhibited the growth of M tuberculosis per spot. Ofloxacin was used as the standard drug. Microwell plate alamar blue assay (MABA)<br>
Antimycobacterial activity was determined by Microwell plate based Alamar blue assay (MABA) using M. tuberculosis H37Ra as a surrogate for the virulent H37Rv strain. The results of MABA have been found comparable to the standard agar dilution system based assay. The standard antitubercular drugs Rifamycin, Isoniazid, p-Amino salicylic acid, Ethambutol and Ethionamide (MIC range 3
Drug susceptibility testing by BACTEC radiometric susceptibility assay:<br>
The assay was done using M. tuberculosis H37Rv as test stain. The assay grows M tuberculosis in 7H12 medium containing 14C labeled palmitic acid as substrate and 14CC&gt;2 is produced. The amount of I4CC&gt;2 detected reflects the rate and amount of growth occurring in the vial and is expressed in term of the "Growth Index" (GI). On addition of an antitubercular drug to the medium suppression of growth of the test organism M tuberculosis can be detected by either a decline or very small increase of the daily GI output as compared to the control. Streptomycin (6ug/ml) and Rifampin (2ug/ml) were used as positive control. All compounds showing MIC below 25(j,g/ml in agar tube dilution were confirmed for activity against M. tuberculosis HjyRv by BACTEC radiometric assay. Cytotoxicity studies<br>
The most active compounds 6aa, 6ab, 6bb and 6ak were tested for their cytotoxicity in VERO cell line. VERO cells originally obtained from ATCC and maintained in CDRI, were seeded on a 96 well plate and incubated at 37°C in 5% CC^ and 95% air. Cells were exposed to varying concentrations (25, 50, 100 ug/ml) of the compound for 72 hours. MTT assay was performed as per the standard protocol to assess cell viability. Triplicates of each assay were carried out. 6ab, 6bb and 6ak were found to be cytotoxic at 25 ug/ml while 6aa showed no cytotoxicity at the dose of 100 ug/ml. Cytotoxicity was also observed for mouse macrophage cell line J 744A.I which is an important cell line for M tuberculosis infection has been used for the assay. The assay is based on the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] reduction. The drug concentrations used for the assay were 50, 25 and 12.5 ug/ml, in parallel with known toxic compounds and standard antimycobacterial drugs like Rifampicin and Sparfloxacin. The cell death was significantly lower (8-10-fold) than the toxic compound and very similar to standard drugs.<br>
