A PROCESS OF MAKING AQUEOUS ANTIMICROBIAL HYGIENIC COATING COMPOSITION;<br>
KANSAI NEROLAC PAINTS LTD. OF GANPATRAO KADAM MARG, LOWER PAREL, MUMBAI 400 013, MAHARASHTRA, India, INDIAN Company.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br>

ORIGINAL<br><br>
A PROCESS OF MAKING AQUEOUS ANTIMICROBIAL HYGIENIC<br>
COATING COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to an Aqueous Antimicrobial Hygieruc Coating Composition. More particularly the present invention relates to a coating composition which displays dry film (and in-can) antibacterial &amp; antifungal action. The unique paint composition including the biocides and other additives in the coating formulation confers sustained activity against tenacious bacteria such as, Pseudomonas species; and capsulated bacteria such as Klebsiella; and also against airborne surface biodeteriorating fungi<br>
The synergistic biocidal blend in the coating composition includes individually or in combination components selected from the group consisting of n-butyl-1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, N-trichloromethylthiophthalimide, 2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one/ zinc pyrithione, zinc zeolite, 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, 2-methyl-4-isothicizolin-3-one, diAio-2, 2-bis (benzmethylamide), methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamate, zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate, iodo propynyl butyl carbamate and a silver component deposited on a carrier and a salt of barium such as sulfate, chromate, metaborate monohydrate and / or chloride.<br>
HELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a dry film antibacterial and antifungal coating that shows broad spectrum and sustained antibacterial activity. The resultant composite coating shows excellent retention of antimicrobial activity even after repeated washing with water, detergent and disinfectants. The cured coating film also shows biocidal activity after repeated cold-hot cycles (-10°C to +35°C).<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION &amp; PRIOR STATE OF ART.<br>
As a technology for keeping surfaces free of microbes, a coating containing antimicrobial compounds (s) can be used. Antimicrobial coatings can be used on the surfaces of a variety of medical, domestic and commercial rooms where control of microbial growth is of particular concern.<br>
A variety of such antimicrobial coatings have been described and are available in the market. However, from the various products tested and literature studied it was found that the coatings were not effective against some of the bacteria used for tests, Pseudomonas sp. &amp; Klebsiella sp. in particular. Pseudomonas is a pathogen and a very resiUent organism tolerant to various antimicrobial agents. Klebsiella is a capsulated opportunistic pathogenic bacterium which shows resistance / tolerance to common disinfectants owing to its polysaccharide capsule. Other microbe of concern is MRSA. All these organisms pose a problem in the increased incidences of nosocomial infections. It was also observed that the available coatings lost the antibacterial activity on leaching or washing.<br>
Silver based aqueous coating compositions have been described, these show^<br>
antibacterial activity but have a limited activity against fungi, whereas 2-n-ociyl-<br>
4-isothiazolin-3-one is a superior fungicide with relatively lower activiiy against<br>
Gram-negative bacteria. Similar shortcomings were observed with zinc based<br>
coating formulations. Also, n-butyl-l,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one,<br>
N-trichloromethylthiophthalimide,	2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one,	zinc<br>
pyrithione, zinc zeolite, 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, dithio-2, 2-bis (benzmethylamide), methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamate, zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate, iodo propynyl butyl carbamate containing formulations showed varying degrees of surface and in-can antifungal &amp; antibacterial properties, but the coating formulations either did not<br><br>
possess a broad spectrum activity (especially against Pseudomonas sp. &amp; Klebsiella sp.) or lost their microbicidal activity on leaching.<br>
Barium metaborate monohydrate has been used in coating formulations for antifungal and antialgal activity. It has also been used to provide in - can bactericidal protection. Barium metaborate monohydrate based coating formulations showed good activity against Pseudomonas and moderate antifungal activity, however it showed meagre or nil activity against Gram positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus. Moreover the dry film anti Pseudomonas activity was lost readily on leaching, therefore such a coating would not withstand cleaning and disinfection regimes.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a coating that possesses broad spectrum antibacterial and anti fungal activity. The coating has been formulated in such a fashion that the antimicrobial activity remains intact even after the coated surface is subjected to detergent washings and surface treatment using common disinfectants thus ensuring a long lasting sustained antimicrobial activity.<br>
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS :<br>
The present invention utilizes the antimicrobial activity of a combination of Barium metaborate monohydrate, a silver component and other biocides (from the ones mentioned above) to achieve dry film antimicrobial properties. Various antimicrobial paint additives were tested at different use levels in the formulation. Among the agents tested only Barium metaborate monohydrate has shown significant activity against Pseudomonas sp.<br><br>
Barium metaborate monohydrate is reported to have good antibacterial activity in the wet state. It can also degrade microbial enzymes in the wet state. It has not been used for dry film antibacterial activity. Experimental studies in our laboratory revealed that Barium metaborate monohydrate is active against Pseudomonas sp. and fungi. The present invention utilizes this property of Barium metaborate monohydrate to impart anti Pseudomonas activity to a dried paint film. Barium metaborate monohydrate has however not shown significant activity against other bacteria. One other drawback observed of Barium metaborate monohydrate is its solubility in water, which resulted in reduced antibacterial activity of the cured coated surface after water leaching. Experiments were conducted to improve the leach resistance of Barium metaborate monohydrate and to supplement its antibacterial spectrum.The ideal dosage of Barium metaborate monohydrate and /or Barium chloride along with the specific types and dosages of binder, a polymer such as acrylic, vinyl, sfyrene, poly urethane have been worked out.<br>
The other antimicrobial additives used in this invention are a silver component and individually or in combination components from the group comprising n-bu1yl-l, 2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, N-trichloromethylthiophthalimide, 2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, zinc pyrithione, zinc zeolite, 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, dithio-2, 2-bis (benzmethylamide), methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamate, zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate, iodo propynyl butyl carbamate. The silver component is a commercially available AgCl coated TiO2. This additive has been found to give antibacterial and some amount of antifungal activity. It is found effective against Gram positive and some Gram negative orgarusms. The other biocidal blend has been found to impart excellent antifungal and moderate antibacterial properties to the paint film. The leach resistance of the coating has been improved by the ideal pigment / binder balance (PVC) and the use of a Silane additive.<br><br>
Examples : The following examples (A...F) constitute some paint formulations based on the above experimental work. This is not an exhaustive hst of the compositions tested. Comparative compositions G and H are examples of the prior state of art coating formulations.<br><br><br><br><br>
Manufacturing Process: Example 1<br>

Check finish with appropriate addition of binder and water in small sample of slurry and then applying by brush. Cool to below 55°C. add remaining ingredients under slow speed such as some biocides (8 - 15), binder (21), remaining defoamer (2), additives (18, 20), thickner (19) and remaining water. Tint with appropriate colourant, if particular shade is required.<br><br><br><br>
