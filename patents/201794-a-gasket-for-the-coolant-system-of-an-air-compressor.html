				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a gasket for the coolant system of an air compressor, particularly, though not exclusively, for the coolant system of an automotive air compressor.<br>
The gasket proposed herein achieves better transfer of heat from the cylinder head of the air compressor to the coolant.<br>
The gasket itself is of a simple construction, and does not lead to any significant increase in its manufacturing cost,  although it is beneficial in use.<br>
The gasket proposed herein is not confined to air compressors alone, but can also be used in like coolant systems to which such gasket is applicable. The term "air compressor" in this specification will, therefore,  have to be construed accordingly.<br>
Various other advantages of this invention will be apparent from what follows herein.<br>
According to this invention, the gasket, for the coolant system of an air compressor, serving as a seal<br><br>
between the cylinder head and the cylinder head cover of the compressor, enclosing the cool ant passages, has ribs for being seated on corresponding ridges of the coolant flow passages in the cylinder head, characterised in that the ribs sre provided with baffles located at places identified by deep pockets in the said passages, the baffles being bent downwardly into the pockets to dip in the  coolant stream in sueh pockets.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference  to<br>
the  accompanying drawings which illustrate by  way  of<br>
example,  and  not  by way of limitation,  one  of  the<br>
various  possible  embodiments of the  gasket  proposed<br>
herein. In the drawings,<br>
Fig.l  illustrates a sectional view of a  reciprocating<br>
air compressor<br>
Fig.2  i1lustrates  the cylinder head assembly  of  the<br>
compressor<br>
and<br>
Fig.3  illustrates a separate view of an embodiment  of<br><br>
the gasket proposed herein.<br>
The automotive piston type compressor illustrated in Fig.l is driven by the vehicle engine. For the sake of simplicity, only the cylinder head, cylinder and piston are shown. The compressed air delivered from the cylinder A is hot and a coolant, such as, water cools the cylinder head assembly B illustrated in Fig.2. Cooling of the cylinder head is important since, otherwise, there will be carbon build-up in the cy1inder head, degraded performance and damage to devices downstream of the system, due to high temperature of the compressed air.<br>
The gasket 6 proposed herein serves as a seal between the cylinder head H and the cylinder head cover C of the compressor.<br>
The gasket has ribs R far being seated oft corresponding ridges E of the coolant flow passages P in the cylinder head H.<br>
Deep pockets D are located in the passages P. The flow of coolant in these pockets is not what it should be.<br><br>
that is to say, sufficiently brisk. The brisk movement is generally confined to the top surface layers of the coolant stream in the pockets, the bottom layers of the coolant in the pockets being sluggish in flow. Such a situation results in inefficient transfer of heat from the cylinder head to the coolant in these pockets. In order to eliminate or, at least minimise, the problem, the gasket G proposed herein is provided with baffles F which are integral with the ribs R. The baffles F are located on the ribs R at places identified by the deep pockets D in the said passages. The baffles F are bent away from the ribs and directed downwardly such that they protrude into the pockets.<br>
As the flow of coolant takes place in the pockets, the baffles which protrude into such pockets cause a turbulence in the coolant stream therein while coming into contact therewith.<br>
Such turbulence, in turn, causes better distribution of heat from the cylinder head to the coolant. Consequently, there is better transfer of heat from the cylinder head to the coolant and greater cooling<br><br>
efficiency is achieved.<br>
Different sizes, shapes or configurations and angles of Inclination at the bent portion of the baffle F are possible to suit specific applications and therefore the baffles are not confined to the size, shape or configuration and angle of inclination J illustrated. Two or more baffles can also be used for each pocket, as necessity may dictate.<br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitation, as they do not exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, since it is understood that various other embodiments of the gasket proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this ITIVMH^<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A gasket, for the cool ant system of an air compressor, serving as a seal between the cylinder head and the cylinder head cover of the compressor, said gasket having ribs for being seated on corresponding ridges of the cool ant flow passages in the cylinder head, characterised in that the ribs are provided with baffles located at pi aces identified by deep pockets in the said passages, the baffles being bent downwardly into the pockets to dip in the coolant stream in such packets.<br>
2.	ft gasket as claimed in Claim 1 wherein at least one baffle is located at a pi ace identified by a deep pocket in the said passages.<br>
3.	ft gasket as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein<br>
the baffles are of predetermined size, shape or<br>
configuration and angle of inclination at the bent<br>
portion thereof.<br><br>
4.  A gasket for the coolant system of an air compressor,  substantially as herein described and as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Dated this the 24 fa     day of December 2002<br><br></td>
