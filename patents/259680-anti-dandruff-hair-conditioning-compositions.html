left to penetrate the hair for a period of about one to three minutes before rinsing it from the hair with water.<br>
The invention will now be further described by reference to 5  the following Examples. In the Examples, all percentages are by weight based on total weight, unless otherwise specified. Examples according to the invention are denoted by a number, whereas comparative examples are denoted by a letter.<br>
10  EXAMPLES<br>
Hair conditioning compositions were prepared having ingredients as shown in the following Table 1: Table 1<br>
15<br><br><br>
WO 2008/003677<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056643<br><br>
The compositions were evaluated for the level of climbazole deposited on skin as follows:<br>
5<br>
Product treatment<br>
Artificial skin was snapped onto plastic cylinders prior to product treatment.  Test shampoos were stirred and rubbed<br>
10  onto the artificial skin, at dilution of 1:3, using a wide diameter stirring rod for 30 seconds. Shampoo liquor was then removed from the artificial skin, followed by adequate rinsing with distilled water to remove any residual surfactants. Climbazole that was deposited from shampoo onto<br>
15  artificial skin was then extracted by ethanol. The ethanolic solution was then filtered through a 0.45 urn filter to remove any impurities. Samples were analysed using HPLC.<br>
The results of the evaluation are shown below in Table 2: 20<br>
Table 2<br><br>
	Climbazole deposition (fj.g/cm2<br>
Example A	8.37<br>
Example 1	27.33<br>
Thus the example according to the invention deposited more 25  climbazole onto the skin than the comparative example.<br><br>
