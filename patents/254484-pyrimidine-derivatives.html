Glucocorticoids (cortisol in humans, corticosterone in mice and rats) are an important class of adrenocorticosteroids that regulate many metabolic and homeostatic processes and form a key component of the response to stress. Glucocorticoids act via intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and, in some tissues, mineralocorticoid receptors; both being nuclear transcription factors. Glucocorticoid action on target tissues depends not only on circulating steroid concentrations and the cellular expression of receptors, but also on intracellular enzymes that critically determine to which extent glucocorticoids gain access to receptors in an active forms, llbeta-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenases (llbeta-HSD's) catalyze the interconversion of the principal active 11-hydroxy-glucocorticoid (Cortisol in men) and their inactive 11-keto metabolites (cortisone in men).<br>
The enzyme 1 Ibeta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (1 Ibeta-HSDl) niter-converts inactive into active glucocorticoids, thereby playing a major role in local modulation of cellular agonist concentration and thus activation of corticosteroid receptors in target tissues. In a recent study made by F. Hoffmann-La Roche differences in gene expression in lean and obese men were analyzed using gene array technology in order to identify specific changes in gene expression that might be associated with insulin resistance or altered metabolism. This study revealed that the mRNA for 1 Ibeta-HSDl is approximately two-fold up regulated in adipose tissue in obese individuals. Moreover, overexpressing I Ibeta-HSDl in adipocytes of mice led to visceral obesity and to a syndrome-X like phenotype (Masuzaki H. et al., Science. 2001 Dec 7; 294(5549):2166-70.). Taken together, these data very strongly support an important role of llbeta-HSD 1 in the induction of obesity and the impairment of glucose homeostasis and lipid parameters. Thus, selective inhibition of this enzyme could lower blood glucose levels in Type 2<br>
'diabetic patients, normalize elevated Hpid parameters and/or reduce weight in obese subjects .<br>
The first pharmacological indication that llbeta-HSDl inhibition in men might have beneficial effects were obtained by using carbenoxolone, an anti-ulcer drug which inhibits both 1 Ibeta-HSDl and the related enzyme llbeta-HSD2. Treatment with carbenoxolone led to an increase in insulin sensitivity indicating that that inhibition of llbeta-HSDl may reduce cellular cortisol levels and therefore minimizing some of its deleterious effects. (Walker et al. 1995; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 80, 31155-3159).<br>
1 Ibeta-HSDl is expressed in many tissues including liver, adipose tissue, vascular smooth muscles, pancreas and brain. Its activity is dependent on NADP(H) and it has a relatively low affinity for its substrate (compared to llbeta-HSD2). 11 beta-HSDl in tissue homogenates and when purified is bidirectional, exhibiting both llbeta-dehydrogenase and 1 Ibeta-reductase reactions, with greater stability of the dehydrogenase activity (P.M. Stewart and Z.S. Krozowski, Vitam. Honm. 57 (1999), pp. 249-324). However, when the enzyme activity is tested in intact cells, the 11 Ibeta-reductase activity predominates, which regenerates active glucocorticoids from inert 11-keto forms. Suchglucocorticoid regeneration will increase effective intracellular glucocorticoid levels and thereby amplifying glucocorticoid activity. It is this elevated cellular cortisol concentration that  might lead to increased hepatic glucose production, adipocyte differentiation and insulin resistance.<br>
Inhibition of 1 Ibeta-HSDl should not only reduce the typical Syndrome-X / Diabetes associated symptoms, but it should also be save and without major side effect Studies with the unspecific inhibitor carbenoxolone highlight the importance of developing specific llbeta-HSDl inhibitors. The inhibition of the 1 lbeta-HSD2 enzyme is badly tolerated and results in increased blood pressure. In contrast inhibition of 1 Ibeta-HSD1 should be well tolerated since llbeta-HSDl knockout mice were found be healthy and to resist hyperglycemia provoked by obesity or stress (Kotelevtsev Y. et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1997 Dec 23;94(26): 14924-9). Similar upon starvation these mice had attenuated activation ot key hepatic enzymes that are involved in gluconeogenesis. In addition, these mice had improved lipid and lipoprotein profiles suggesting that inhibition of HSDl might be highly efficacious and safe. Recent reports indicate that llbeta-HSDl inhibitors might also be beneficial to reduce high blood pressure (Masuzaki H. et al., J Clin Invest. 2003 July.l 12(1 ):83-90; Rauz S. et al., QJM. 2003 July,96(7):481-90) to improve<br>
cognition (Sandeep TC. et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2004 Apr. 27;101(17):6734-9) or to improve Alzheimer associated deficits. Taken together 1 Ibeta-HSDl inhibition might be a save and efficacious approach to treat symptoms of diabetes, obesity and other diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters are novel and have valuable pharmacological properties. In particular they are 1 Ib-HSDl inhibitors (T2D) and they display selectivity against the related 1 lbeta-HSD2 enzyme. Therefore the compounds which are specific llbeta-HSDl inhibitors (T2D) represent aa approach to e.g. lower blood glucose levels and normalize lipid parameters in Type 2 diabetic patients by modulating the local concentration of the active glucocorticoid cortisol in target tissue (liver, adipose tissue).<br>

Processes for the manufacture of compounds of formula I are an object of the invention.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula I of the present invention may be carried out in sequential or convergent synthetic routes. Syntheses of the invention are shown in the following Schemes. The skills required for carrying out the reaction and purification of the resulting products are known to those hi the art. The substituents and indices used in the following description of the processes have the significance given above unless indicated to the contrary.<br>
In general, compounds of type I are readily accessible by sulfonylation of appropriately substituted 4-amino-pyrimidines A with sulfonyi chlorides under various conditions that are known to persons skilled in the art. Examples of such conditions are -as indicated in the scheme below - e.g. pyridine at devated temperatures or THF under<br><br>
reflux  conditions  in  the presence of a base  such  as  potassium   carbonate,  sodium carbonate, sodium hydride, tritely amine or the like.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Compounds I with R5 = H obtained in this way can optionally be further substituted at the sulfonamide nitrogen by treatment with a base such as sodium hydride, cesium carbonate, potassium carbonate or the like in a solvent such as DMF or THF followed by allegation of the resulting anion with an alkylhalide such as methyl iodide, ethyl bromide, benzyl bromide or the like in order to introduce the desired R5 substituent<br>
Appropriately substituted 4-amino-pyrimidines A are either commercially available, known in the literature or can be made in analogy to literature procedures from known starting materials. A convenient synthesis uses amidines or amidine salts B as starting<br>
•<br>
materials that are - after liberation of the free amidine by treatment with a base such as triethyl amine, sodium ethoride, potassium carbonate or the like if amidine salts are used as starting materials - treated with an acrylonitrile such as 2-chloro-acrylonitiile or 3-ethoxy-acrylonitrile under conditions that have been described earlier (e. g.}. Heterocyclic Chem. 14, 1977, 1413-1414). Other, alternative approaches for the preparation of appropriately substituted 4-amino-pyrimidines are also available form the literature.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
In the presence of an appropriately substituted side chain at position 2 of the 4-amino-pyrimidine intermediate A, e. g. in case of the presence of a leaving group such as a halide in the side chain, additional but optional modifications are possible. For example, the leaving group may be exchanged by treatment of the appropriate starting material with a) alcohols and a base to furnish aryl- or alkyl ethers, or b) amines to provide aminoalkyl derivatives as illustrated in Scheme A below. When the leaving group is attached directly to the pyrimidine nudeus in position 2, reactions with alcohols are possible in similar manner to give O-substituted 2-hydroxy-4-aminopyrimidines (Scheme B).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The conversion of a compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be carried out by treatment of such a compound with an inorganic acid, for example a hydrohalic acid, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid etc., or with an organic acid, such as, for example, acetic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid. The corresponding carboxylate salts can also be prepared from the compounds of formula I by treatment with physiologically compatible bases.<br>
The conversion of compounds of formula I into pharinaceutically acceptable esters Or amides can be carried out e.g. by treatment of suited amino or h'ydroxyl groups present in the molecules with an carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, with a condensating reagent<br>
such as benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) or N.N-dicylohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI) to produce the carboxylic ester or carboxylic amide.<br>

Assay Procedures Transient expression and partial Purification:<br>
The cDNA encoding the human llbeta-HSDl protein as cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Stratagene). This construct (for detail Alex Odermatt et al J Biol Chem.,1999, Vol. 274, Issue 40, 28762-28770) was used tc transiently express the protein in HEK293 cells (ATCC number: CRL-1573, described in Graham, FX., Smile, Russell, W.C., Nairn, R.; (1977) using lipofectamine. 48h after transfection cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (Phsophate buffered Saline). Tot volume of cell suspension in PBS 2 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (50mM Tris; pH ImM EDTA; lOOmM NaCl) were added. The cells were lysed by Potter-homogenizsaon (20 strokes); The resulting homogenate was sonicated wit a tip sonicator (10% outpS 2 x 30 sec.) and cleared by a low speed centrifugation (lOmin x 9000g; 4°C). The micnsomal fraction was collected by a high speed centrifugation (60 min x 110'OOOg). The regring pellet was resuspended'in storage buffer (20mM Tris pH 7.5; 1 mM EDTA; 10% Glyorol) and the centrifugation was repeated. The resulting pellet containing the microsomal raction was again taken up into storage buffer and aliquots were kept frozen in liquid Nitrsen until use.<br>
Generation of stable cell lines expressing llbeta-HSDl:<br>
The same construct used for transient expression of huma llbeta-HSDl was also used to establish cell lines stably expressing the protein. Briefly, HEK293) cells were transfected with llbeta-HSDl construct using the lipofectamine reient (Gibco BRL) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Two days after transition, geneticin selection (0.8 nig/ml) was initiated and several stable clones were isoljed- One done was further used for pharmacological characterization.<br>
Microsome Assay<br>
Microsomes isolated from HEK293 cells transiently expressing human llbeta-HSDl (for details see above) were incubated in assay buffer (100 mM NaCl; ImM EDTA; 1mM EGTA; ImM Mgcl; 250 mM Sucrose; 20 mM Tris pH 7.4; Cortisone 50-200nM and NADPH 1mM) together with different concentrations of test substances. After 60 min. of incubation at 37°C the assay was stopped by heating to 80°C (5 min.) and by addition of the inhibitor Carbenoxolone (1 uM). The amount of Cortisol produced in this assay was determined using a commercially available, ELISA-based Cortisol-detection kit (Distributed by Assay Design, Inc.). Inhibitors were characterized by there IC50 values, e.g. the concentration at which the production of cortisol was 50% reduced.<br>
In this test preferred compounds as described above have IC50 values below 1000 nM; more preferred compounds have IC50 values below 100 nM. Most preferred compounds have IC50 values below l0nM.<br>
Cellular Assay<br>
To measure the effect of inhibitors in intact cells HEK293 cells stably expressing human beta-HSDl (see above) were cultivated in 96 well plates in DMEM. First inhibitors and 60 nun later Cortisone was added to the cells. After 60 min of incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere part of the medium was removed and the conversion from Cortisone ta Cortisol was measured using a commercially available ELISA kit (Distributed by Assay Design, Inc.).<br>
Results obtained in the microsome assay using representative compounds of the invention as the test compounds are shown in the following table: (Table Removed)<br>
 as described above have ICso values below 100 uM; more preferred compounds have IC50 values below 20 uM, particularly below 5 uM. Most preferred compounds have ICso values below 0.5 uM. These results have been obtained by using the foregoing test<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments (e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations). The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered internally, such as orally (e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions), nasally (e.g. in the form of nasal sprays) or rectally (e.g. in the form of' suppositories). However, the administration can also be effected parentally, such as intramuscularly or intravenously (e.g. in the form of injection solutions).<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic adjuvants for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc. can be used, for example, as such adjuvants for tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for soft gelatin capsules, are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid substances and liquid polyols, etc.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for the production of solutions and syrups are for example, water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose, etc.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils, etc.<br>
Suitable adjuvants for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi solid or liquid polyols, etc.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizcrs, viscosity-increasing substances, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
In accordance with the invention the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceuticafly acceptable salts can be used for the prophylaxis and treatment of arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, renal failure and particularly eating disorders and obesity. The dosage can vary in wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 0.1 mg to 20 mg per kg body weight, preferably about 0.5 mg to 4 mg per kg body weight (e.g. about 300 mg per person), divided into preferably 1-3 individual doses, which can consist, for example, of the same amounts, should be appropriate. It will, however, be dear that the upper limit given above can be exceeded when this is shown to be indicated.<br>
