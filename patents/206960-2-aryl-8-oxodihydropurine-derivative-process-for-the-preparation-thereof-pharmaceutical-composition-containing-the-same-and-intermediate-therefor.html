2-ARYL-8-OXODIHYDROPURINE DERIVATIVE, PROCESS FOR THE<br>
PREPARATION THEREOF, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION<br>
CONTAINING THE SAME, AND INTERMEDIATE THEREFOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel 2-aryl-8-oxodihydro-purine derivative selectively acting on the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, more particularly, a 2-aryl-8-oxodihydropurine derivative having an acetamide moiety at the 7-position or the 9-position of the purine nucleus, a process for the preparation thereof, a pharmaceutical composition containing the same, and an intermediate therefor. BACKGROUND ART<br>
In the tissues of the mammals including human, there are three kinds of benzodiazepine (hereinafter, occasionally referred to as BZ) recognition sites, and each is named as central-type (ω 1, ω2) benzodiazepine receptors and a peripheral-type (ω 3) benzodiazepine receptor, respectively (hereinafter, occasionally referred to as BZ ω1-receptor, BZ ω 2-receptor and BZω3-receptor, respectively).   Among them, the central-type BZ-receptors are the binding sites for BZ-compounds, and are present on the y-aminobutyric acid (hereinafter, occasionally referred to as "GABA") A-BZ-receptor-Cl" ion channel complexes.   On the other hand, the peripheral-type BZ-receptor widely distributes in the central or peripheral tissues or organs such as brain,<br><br>
kidney, liver, heart, etc., and it especially distributes with high density in the cells of the endocrinium organs such as adrenal glands, testicles, etc., or in the cells deeply participating in the inflammation-immune system in whole body such as mast cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, blood platelets, etc., so that the physiological roles of the peripheral-type BZ-receptor have recently been drawing attention.    On the other hand, the peripheral-type BZ-receptor is present a lot in the mitochondrial membrane of glial cells in the brain, and it participates in cholesterol influx into the mitochondrial membrane, and hence, it is thought to act on the biosynthesis pathway of cholesterol into neurosteroids such as progesterone, allopregnanolone, etc., via pregnenolone.   Thus, it is considered that stimulation of the peripheral-type BZ-receptor accelerates the synthesis of neurosteroids in the brain which affect the chloride ion channel gating process by binding to the neurosteroid-specific recognition site (which is a different site from the benzodiazepine receptor) on the GABAA-BZ receptor-Cl~ ion channel complexes [cf. Romeo, E., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 262, 971-978(1992)].<br>
A compound having a non-BZ nucleus and selectively showing an affinity for the peripheral-type BZ-receptor has been disclosed in Japanese Patent First Publication (Kokai) No. 201756/1983 (= EP-A-94271), and since then, various compounds have been disclosed in many patent publications, etc., however, there is no compound which has actually been used as a medicament.<br>
As a compound having a non-BZ nucleus and selectively showing an affinity for the peripheral-type BZ-receptors, the following<br><br>
compounds have been known.<br>
Japanese Patent First Publication (Kokai) No. 5946/1987 (= USP 4788199, EP-A-205375 (patent family)) discloses that amide compounds of the following formula are bound to the peripheral-type BZ-receptor, and are useful as anxiolytics, anticonvulsants and drugs for treatment of angina pectoris, and in the treatment of immunodeficiency syndrome.<br><br>
Japanese Patent First Publication (Kokai) No. 32058/1990 (= EP-A-346208, USP 5026711) discloses that 4-amino-3-carboxyquinoline compounds of the following formula show an affinity for the peripheral-type BZ-receptor both in vitro and in vivo, and can be used in the prophylaxis or treatment of human cardiovascular diseases, or as an antiallergic agent, or in the prophylaxis or treatment of infectious diseases, or in the treatment of anxiety.<br><br>
WO 96-32383 publication discloses that the acetamide derivative of the following formula selectively acts on BZω3-receptor, and<br><br>
has anxiolytic activity and anti-rheumatoid activity so that it can be used in the treatment of anxiety-relating diseases or immune diseases.<br><br>

The pharmacological activities of the present compounds are explained by the following pharmacological experiments on the representative compounds of the present invention. Experiment 1:   Central (Ω1,,Ω2) and peripheral (Ω3) benzodiazepine receptor binding assays<br>
BZΩ1 and BZω2 receptor binding assays and the preparation of receptor membrane fractions therefor were carried out according to the method of Stephens, D. N. et al. [cf., J. Pharmacol. Exp., Ther., 253, 334-343 (1990)], and BZ3 receptor binding assay and the preparation of receptor membrane fraction therefor were done according to the method of Schoemaker, H. [cf., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 225, 61-69 (1983)]<br><br>
each with slight modification.<br>
Receptor membrane fractions for Ω1,Ω2 and ω3 were prepared<br>
from the cerebellum (ω1), spinal cord (Ω2) or kidney (Ω3) in 7-8 week old male rats of Wistar strain, respectively, by the procedure described below.<br>
After the cerebellum or spinal cord was homogenized with 20 volumes of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-citrate buffer (pH 7.1), the homogenate was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 40,000 g.   The pellet obtained was washed 4 times by the same procedure, and frozen and stored for 24 hours at -60°C.   The resulting pellet, after being thawed, washed with the buffer and centrifuged, was suspended in the buffer I for the binding assay (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, 2 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2; pH 7.4) and the suspension thus<br>
obtained (containing 1 g wet tissue/40 ml) was used for the BZGΩI and BZΩ2 receptor binding assays.   On the other hand, the kidney was homogenized with 20 volumes of the ice-cold buffer II for the binding assay (50 mM Na-K phosphate buffer containing 100 mM NaCl; pH 7.4), and the mixture was filtered through 4 sheets of gauze, and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 40,000 g.   The pellet obtained was suspended in the buffer II and the suspension (containing 1 g wet tissue/100 ml) was<br>
used for the binding assay as BZQ3 receptor membrane source.<br>
[3H] Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) (final concentration: 0.3 nM for Ω1. and 1 nM for co2) and flunitrazepam (final concentration: 10 μM) were used for the BZω1 or BZΩ2 receptor binding assays as the isotope-labeled and unlabeled ligands, respectively.   For the BZω3 receptor binding assay, [3H] 4'-chlorodiazepam (7-chloro-l,3-dihydro-l-methyl-5-<br><br>
(4-chlorophenyl)-2H-l,4-diazepin-2-one) (Ro 5-4864) (final concentration: 0.5 nM) and diazepam (final concentration: 100 μ M) were used as the isotope-labeled and unlabeled ligands, respectively. Incubation was performed for 30 minutes at 37°C in the BZω1or BZω2 receptor binding assays, and for 150 minutes at 0°C in the BZ3ω receptor binding assay.   The BZΩ12 or BZΩ)2 receptor binding assays were carried out in the presence of bicuculline (final concentration: 100 liM).<br>
The binding assay was performed by the following procedure. After adding each test compound at certain known concentrations, a [3H] ligand, and the buffer I or II to each test tube, each assay was started by addition of membrane preparation (total volume of 1 ml). After incubation, the assay was terminated by filtration with suction through a Whatman GF/B glass fiber filter using a cell harvester (Brandel, USA).   The filters were rapidly washed 3 times with 5 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) forω1and Ω2, or the buffer II for ω3, and transferred to scintillation vials containing 10 ml liquid scintillation cocktail (ACS-II, Amersham, USA).   After being allowed to stand for a specific period, retained radioactivity was counted by a liquid scintillation spectrometer.   Specific binding of [3H] ligands was calculated as the difference between amounts of radioactivity bound in the presence and absence of excess unlabeled ligands.   The concentration of the test compounds causing 50% inhibition of specific binding of the [3H] ligand (IC50) was determined by probit analysis.   The results are shown in Table 3.   It is noted that all the compounds as listed in Table 5 had affinity for the BZω1and BZΩ2 receptors with IC50<br><br><br><br>
The compounds listed in Table 3 strongly bind to the BZω3 receptor, but had affinity for the BZω1 and BZG&gt;2 receptors with the IC50 value larger than 1000 nM.   Therefore, it is apparent that the compounds of the present invention have potent and highly selective affinity for the BZG&gt;3 receptor. Experiment 2:    Light and dark box test (anti-anxiety effect)<br>
Anti-anxiety effect of test compounds was examined in a box with light and dark compartments according to the method of Crawley, J. and Goodwin, F.K. [cf., Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav., 13, 167-170 (1980)] with slight modification.<br>
Light and dark box test is a useful, simple and handy method for behaviorally and pharmacologically examining anti-anxiety effect of the drugs, by utilizing the habit of rodents such as mice and rats, etc. which prefer to stay in a dark place, and regarding as positive drug effect the increase of the relative stay of the animals in the light compartment which is an uncomfortable place for the animals.   A number of drugs such as cholecystokinin B type receptor antagonists and benzodiazepine drugs, show positive effect in this test.<br>
Light and dark box test was carried out using the test box device (35 X 17 X 15 cm) which comprises: a light compartment (20 X 17 X 15 cm) consisting of transparent acrylic plates and highly illuminated by an incandescent lamp (1,700 lux); a dark compartment (15 X 17 X 15 cm) being made of black acrylic plates connected to the light compartment; and at the boundary of compartments, an opening (4.4 X 5.0 cm) in which mice can go through freely between two compartments.<br><br>
Male mice of Std-ddY strain weighing 25-30 g were used in a group of 10.   Each trial was started by placing a mouse in the center of the light compartment 30 minutes after oral administration of a test compound, and the time spent by the mouse in the light compartment during a 5 minute observation period was measured, and the rate of the stay of mice in the light compartment to the whole time spent in the experiment was calculated (rate of light compartment stay, %).<br>
The anti-anxiety effect of the test compound was represented by the minimum effective dose (MED) at which the increasing rate of the relative stay in the light compartment was regarded as statistically significant (Dunnetp test, significance level: 5 %).   The results are shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
■<br>
*: The compound of Example 1 (hereinafter, the test compound numbers mean the compounds of the corresponding Examples in the same way)<br>
The present compounds as listed in Table 4 showed antianxiety effect at doses of 1 mg/kg or below, and especially the compounds of Examples 1, 2, 5, 106, 107, 112, 136, 137, 146 and 147 showed anti-anxiety effect even at a low dose of 0.001-0.003 mg/kg. Experiment 3:    Isoniazid-induced clonic convulsion test (anticonvulsant effect)<br>
Isoniazid inhibits glutamate decarboxylase that catalyzes GABA biosynthesis, decreases brain GABA levels, and induces clonic<br><br>
convulsion.   According to the method of Auta, J. et al. [cf., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 265, 649-656 (1993)] with slight modification, antagonistic effects of the test compounds on isoniazid-induced clonic convulsion were examined.   Many drugs, which directly or indirectly enhance GABAA receptor function, are known to exhibit positive effect in this test.   Such drugs are BZ receptor agonists represented by diazepam, neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone, allotetrahydro-deoxycorticosterone (THDOC) and BZΩ3 receptor agonists, which enhance the synthesis of neurosteroids.<br>
Male mice of Std-ddY strain weighing 22-24 g were used in a group of 6.   Thirty minutes after oral administration of the test compounds, mice were injected with isoniazid (200 mg/kg) subcutaneously, and immediately thereafter, the mice were placed individually in plastic observation cages.   The onset time of clonic convulsion was measured (cut-off time: 90 minutes).   The latency in the control group was about 40 minutes.<br>
Anti-isoniazid effect of the test compounds was expressed by the dose, which prolonged the onset time by 25% compared to that in the vehicle group (ED25).   The ED25 value was calculated according to the probit method.   The results are shown in Table 5.<br><br><br>
*: The compound of Example 106 (hereinafter, the test compound numbers mean the compounds of the corresponding Examples in the same way)<br>
Experiment 4:   Acute toxicity<br>
Male mice of Std-ddY strain weighing 25-30 g were used in a group of 10 animals for examining on the compound of Example 1.   A test compound was suspended in 0.5% tragacanth and administered orally to the mice at a dose of 2000 mg/kg.   Then, lethality of the mice was observed for 7 days after the treatment, and no lethality was found in mice to which the compound of Example 1 was administered.<br>
