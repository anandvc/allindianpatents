				<td>NEW a-GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS FROM A NATURAL SOURCE<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a method for providing a-glucosidase<br>
inhibition to a subject by administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising a ctglucosidase<br>
inhibitory agent selected from pipataline (formula la), sesamin (formula<br>
Ib), pellitorine (Formula Ic), guineensine (Formula Id) and brachystamide-B<br>
(formula le). In particular this invention relates to the isolation of five compounds<br>
namely,<br>
pipataline [5-(l-dodecenyl)-l, 3-Benzodioxol], sesamin [5,5-(tetrahydro-lH,3Hfuro(<br>
3,4-<br>
e)furan-l,4-diyl)bis-l,3-Benzodioxol], pellitorine [N-(2-methyl propyl)-2,4-<br>
decaadienamide], guineensine [13-(l,3-Benzodioxol-5-yl)-N(2-methylpropyl)-2,4,12-<br>
tri decatrienamide] and Brachystamide-B [[15-(l,3-Benzodioxol-5-yl)-N(2-<br>
methy!propyl)-2,4,14-pentadecatrienamide] from the plant source Piper longum in<br>
significant yields. This invention also identifies the therapeutic application of these<br>
compounds as a-glucosidase inhibitors in the form of suitable pharmaceutical<br>
composition for diabetes mellitus, cancer, viral diseases such as hepatitis B and C,<br>
HIV, AIDS etc.<br>
Background Art<br>
The use of plants as medicines goes back to early man. Certainly the great<br>
civilization of the ancient Indians, Chinese and North Africans provided written<br>
evidences of man's ingenuity in utilizing plants for the treatment of a wide variety of<br>
diseases (Phillipson J. D phytochemistry, 2001, 56, 237-243). As, new research and<br>
clinical experience is broadening the knowledge, changes in drug therapy are also<br>
being observed. Due to the occurrence of new diseases and identification of targets<br>
with multiple therapeutic applications there is an ongoing search for new compounds<br>
having unique structures and properties.<br>
a-glucosidase enzyme has been identified as such a target. Inhibitors of aglucosidase<br>
are increasingly finding therapeutic application in metabolic disorders<br>
such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipoproteinemia Type IV (Trusch eit, E. et al,<br>
Angew. Chem.. Int. Ed. Engl. 1981,20, 744-761; Puls, W. Keupu Diabelologia, 1973,<br>
9, 97; Puls, W Habilitationssoh Chrift universitat Dusseldorf 1980), HIV, human<br>
hepatitis B virus, human cytomegalovirus and influenza (Heightman T D and vasella<br>
A T, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999, 38, 750- 770; Mehta et al, FEBS Lett.<br>
1998,430, 17-22; Watson A. A et al, Phytochemistry 2001, 56, 265-295), cancer and<br>
in immuno compromised cases. The serum level of glucosidases have been found to<br>
be increased in many patients with different tumors (Woollen, J. W and Tesiar, ' P.<br>
1965, 'din. Chem. Ada. 12, 671-683) and are being realized to be involved in the<br>
degradation of the extracellular matrix, in tumor cell invasion (Bernaki, R. J et al.,<br>
1985 Cancer metastasis Rev 4, 81-102). Therefore, inhibitors of catabolic<br>
glucosidases are being actively pursued as a therapeutic strategy for cancer (Watson,<br>
A. A etal, Phytochemistry} 2001,56,265-295).<br>
Variety of compounds bearing a-glucosidase inhibiting potential have been<br>
reviewed for their chemotherapeutic values (El Ashry et al, Pharmazie, 2000, 55,<br>
251-262, 331-348 and 403-415). Although several drugs targeted for a-glucosidase<br>
inhibition are either in clinical practice or various stages of clinical development<br>
(Drugs of the future 1986, 11, 795-797; Dugs of the future 1986, 11, 1039-1042;<br>
Watson A. A et al, Phytochemistry 2001, 56, 265-295) the impact of the burden of<br>
diseases as discussed above underscores the clear need for new agents. It is also<br>
necessary to have a large inhibitors pool as patients can develop resistance to current<br>
regimens.<br>
Historically, the knowledge gained from traditional medicinal practice and the<br>
screening of the extracts from the plants and as animals there in has yielded novel<br>
natural products which themselves as potential bioactive agents for the treatment of<br>
human diseases (Gullo. V.P, The discovery of natural products with therapeutic<br>
potential, Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston, 1994; Cragg G. Metal J. Nat. Prod. 1997,<br>
60: 52-60).<br>
The screening of natural sources has led to the discovery of many clinically<br>
useful drugs that play a major role not only in the treatment of diseases discussed<br>
above, but also in the prevention of such diseases. Therefore, increasing clinical<br>
importance of epidemics of diabetes, cancer, HIV and other viral diseases as well as<br>
drug resistance has led additional urgency to identify novel resources for active<br>
compounds to have a large pool.<br>
As described hereafter, our search for a-glucosidase inhibitors from traditional<br>
medicinal plants has led to the identification of Piper longum which contained in<br>
significant yield potent a-glucosidase inhibitors.<br>
Piper longum Linn. (Pippali) has been described in traditional medical<br>
practice of India for malarial fever, heart disease, splenomegaly, cough, oeadema and<br>
so on (P.V.Sharma, Classical uses of medicinal plants, Haridas Ayurveda series (4),<br>
Chaukambha Viswabharathi, Varanasi, 1996)<br>
The present invention relates to the identification and isolation of potent aglucosidase<br>
inhibitors from Piper longum in the form of suitable pharmaceutical<br>
composition which may find therapeutic application in the treatment of diabetes<br>
mellitus, cancer, tumor, metastasis, immunomodulation and as broad spectrum<br>
antiviral agents.<br>
Various piper species from which compounds claimed in this invention as aglucosidase<br>
inhibition has been tabulated in table 1 and their biological activities in<br>
table 2.<br>
Application and administration:<br>
The a-glucosidase inhibitors of this invention can be applied or administered<br>
by any conventional method to the management and treatment of diabetes mellitus,<br>
cancer, HIV, AIDS, Hepatitis B and or C, other viral infections, immunocompromised<br>
cases, multiple sclerosis, arthritis etc. where o-glucosidase inhibition improves and<br>
cure the disease.<br>
For human, animals and/or veterinary application compounds as a-glucosidase<br>
inhibitors of the invention may be administered through various routes as per the<br>
suitability and clinical condition. For human application compounds as a-glucosidase<br>
inhibitor may be administered through various routes including oral, intraperitoneai,<br>
intravenous, and/or intramuscular as per the case may be.<br>
Formulations:<br>
The compounds as a-glucosidase inhibitors of this invention may be<br>
formulated with any of the pharmaceutically applicable additive, carrier vehicle that<br>
by no means should alter the potency and property of the compound in any form.<br>
For human applications, the compounds of this invention as a-glucosidase<br>
inhibitors may be formulated with many of the pharmaceutical ly acceptable carriers<br>
and additives useful for administration of pharmaceutical, which is well known in the<br>
art.<br>
The selected carriers or vehicles would of course be consistent with the mode<br>
of application or administration of glucosidase inhibitors.<br>
Effective levels:<br>
The expressions "an effective amount" and or "a suppressive amount" are used<br>
to that quantity of the a-glucosidase inhibitor compound of the invention which<br>
appears necessary to obtain a reduction in the level of disease, such as reduction in<br>
post prandial blood glucose level and insulin level in cases of diabetes and<br>
suppression cancer, tumor or viral infection significantly as the case may be, relative<br>
to that occurring in an untreated control under suitable conditions of the treatment as<br>
per the disease condition and severity. It implies that an effective amount of aglucosidase<br>
inhibitor compound of this invention would be less than any amount that<br>
would induce significant unwanted side effects in the organism being treated for a<br>
particular disease. This implication is reinforced by the use of the expression<br>
"pharmaceutically effective amount". The actual rate and amount of<br>
application may vary depending on the disease conditions. This may be irrespective of<br>
the concentrations as described in the examples of the invention.<br>
The actual rate and amount of application may vary depending upon the<br>
disease and /or infection severity and may also depend upon the plurality of the<br>
factors like age and sex of the individual being treated and the mode of administration<br>
etc. Upon taking these factors into account, actual dose level and regimen could be<br>
readily determined by the person of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

Example 1<br>
Experimental protocol: A process for the isolation of pipataline, sesamin,<br>
pellitorine, guineensine and brachystamide-B.<br>
The dried, powdered fruits of Piper longum (500g) were loaded on a soxhlet<br>
apparatus. The powder was extracted with hexane. The hexane extract was<br>
concentrated under vacuum. The dark green colored residue was loaded on silica gel<br>
column 60-120 mesh, 3.5-cm dia column loaded to a height of 60 cm.<br>
Initially the column was eluted with hexane to get pipataline. The yield of pipataline<br>
is around 6.0g. Further elution of the column with 3% ethyl acetate in hexane yielded<br>
sesamin. The yield of sesamin is around 200mg.<br>
Further elution of the column with 5% ethyl acetate in hexane yielded pellitorine. The<br>
yield of pellitorine is around 200mg.<br>
Further elution of the column with 10% ethyl acetate in hexane yielded guineensine.<br>
The yield of guineensine is around 300mg.<br>
Further elution of the column with 1 1% ethyl acetate in hexane yielded<br>
Brachystamide-B. The yield of brachystamide-B is around 120mg.<br>
All the above compounds were obtained in 90% purity.<br>

Example 2:<br>
Determination of a-Glucosidase inhibition activity of compounds isolated from<br>
P. longum:<br>
The a-glucosidase inhibitory assay was done by the chromogenic method. In brief<br>
lOul of test compounds dissolved in DMSO (5mg/ml and subsequent dilutions) were<br>
incubated for 5 min. with 5u.l of yeast a-glucosidase enzyme prepared in lOOmM<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.00). After 5 minutes of incubation, SOfil of 5mM substrate (pnitrophenyl-<br>
a-D-glucopyranoside prepared in the same buffer) was added. The presubstrate<br>
and 5-min post-substrate addition absorbances were recorded at 405nm<br>
spectrophotometrically. The increase in absorbance from pre-substrates addition to<br>
post substrates reaction were obtained. Percent inhibition was calculated by (1-O.D<br>
test/O.D control)x 100 and inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) was calculated by<br>
applying suitable regression analysis.<br>
In accordance with the practice of this invention, it has been found that pipataline,<br>
sesamin, pellitorine, guineensine and brachystamide-B are isolated from Piper<br>
longum among which pipataline is from an entirely new source. The yields of<br>
these compounds are also substantial. Also, it has been found that all the above<br>
said compounds show a-glucosidase inhibition property.<br>
Advantages:<br>
a-glucosidase inhibitors recently have attracted the attention due to their broadspectrum<br>
activities in disorders of multiple origin viz. diabetes, viral disorders,<br>
cancer, HIV, Hepatitis- B and C etc. Much attention being directed now to procure the<br>
a-glucosidase inhibitors from natural sources.<br>
The compounds pipataline, sesamin, pellitorine, guineensine, brachystamide-B are<br>
used in pure form. Hence, isolation of pipataline, sesamin, pellitorine, guineensine<br>
and brachystamide-B from piper longum in significant yields as a-glucosidase<br>
inhibitors makes the invention very important.<br><br><br><br><br>
