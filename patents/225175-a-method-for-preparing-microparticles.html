				<td>Residual Solvent Extraction Method<br>
and Microparticles Produced Thereby<br>
A METHOD FOR PREPARING MICROPARTICLES<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to preparation of microparticles containing an active<br>
agent. More particularly, the present invention relates to microparticles with a reduced level<br>
of residual solvent, and to a method for the preparation of such microparticles.<br>
Related Art<br>
[0002] Various methods are known by which compounds can be encapsulated in the form<br>
of microparticles. It is particularly advantageous to encapsulate a biologically active or<br>
pharmaceutically active agent within a biocompatible, biodegradable wall-forming material<br>
(e.g., a polymer) to provide sustained or delayed release of drugs or other active agents. In<br>
these methods, the material to be encapsulated (drugs or other active agents) is generally<br>
dissolved, dispersed, or emulsified in a solvent containing the wall forming material. Solvent<br>
is then removed from the microparticles to form the finished microparticle product.<br>
[0003] An example of a conventional microencapsulation process is disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 3,737,337 wherein a solution of a wall or shell forming polymeric material in a<br>
solvent is prepared. The solvent is only partially miscible in water. A solid or core material<br>
is dissolved or dispersed in the polymer-containing solution and, thereafter, the core-material-<br>
polymer-containing solution is dispersed in an aqueous liquid that is immiscible in the<br>
organic solvent.<br>
[0004] Tice et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,389,330 describe the preparation of microparticles<br>
containing an active agent by using a two-step solvent removal process. In the Tice et al.<br>
process, the active agent and the polymer are dissolved in a solvent. The mixture of<br>
ingredients in the solvent is then emulsified in a continuous-phase processing medium that is<br>
immiscible with the solvent. A dispersion of microparticles containing the indicated<br>
ingredients is formed in the continuous-phase medium by mechanical agitation of the mixed<br>
materials. From this dispersion, the organic solvent can be partially removed in the first step<br>
of the solvent removal process. After the first stage, the dispersed microparticles are isolated<br>
from the continuous-phase processing medium by any convenient means of separation.<br>
Following the isolation, the remainder of the solvent in the microparticles is removed by<br>
extraction. After the remainder of the solvent has been removed from the microparticles,<br>
they are dried by exposure to air or by other conventional drying techniques.<br>
[0005] Another conventional method of microencapsulating an agent to form a<br>
microencapsulated product is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,407,609. This method includes:<br>
(1) dissolving or otherwise dispersing one or more agents (liquids or solids) in a solvent<br>
containing one or more dissolved wall-forming materials or excipients (usually the wall-<br>
forming material or excipient is a polymer dissolved in a polymer solvent); (2) dispersing the<br>
agent/polymer-solvent mixture (the discontinuous phase) into a processing medium (the<br>
continuous phase which is preferably saturated with polymer solvent) to form an emulsion;<br>
and (3) transferring all of the emulsion immediately to a large volume of processing medium<br>
or other suitable extraction medium, to immediately extract the solvent from the<br>
microdroplets in the emulsion to form a microencapsulated product, such as microcapsules or<br>
microspheres.<br>
[0006] U.S. Patent No. 5,650,173 discloses a process for preparing biodegradable,<br>
biocompatible microparticles comprising a biodegradable, biocompatible polymeric binder<br>
and a biologically active agent, wherein a blend of at least two substantially non-toxic<br>
solvents, free of halogenated hydrocarbons, are used to dissolve both the agent and the<br>
polymer. The solvent blend containing the dissolved agent and polymer is dispersed in an<br>
aqueous solution to form droplets. The resulting emulsion is added to an aqueous extraction<br>
medium preferably containing at least one of the solvents of the blend, whereby the rate of<br>
extraction of each solvent is controlled, whereupon the biodegradable, biocompatible<br>
microparticles containing the biologically active agent are formed. Active agents suitable for<br>
encapsulation by this process include, but are not limited to, norethindrone, risperidone, and<br>
testosterone, and a preferred solvent blend is one comprising benzyl alcohol and ethyl<br>
acetate.<br>
[0007] U.S. Patent No. 5,654,008 describes a microencapsulation process that uses a<br>
static mixer. A first phase, comprising an active agent and a polymer, and a second phase are<br>
pumped through a static mixer into a quench liquid to form microparticles containing the<br>
active agent.<br>
[0008] U.S. Patent Nos. 5,792,477 and 5,916,598 ("the Rickey et al. patents") disclose a<br>
process whereby microparticles are contacted with an aqueous washing system to reduce the<br>
level of residual organic solvent to less than about 2% by weight of the microparticles. The<br>
aqueous washing system is water, or an aqueous solution of water and a solvent for the<br>
residual solvent in the microparticles. The aqueous washing system is at a temperature in the<br>
range of from about 25°C to about 40°C. The organic solvent used in such a process is<br>
preferably a non-halogenated solvent, and most preferably benzyl alcohol alone or in<br>
combination with ethyl acetate.<br>
[0009] Because the process disclosed in the Rickey et al' patents uses an aqueous<br>
washing system that reduces solvent levels, it suffers from the drawback that it may result in<br>
unacceptable depletion of water soluble active agents, such as peptides, from the<br>
microparticles.<br>
[0010] The documents described above all disclose methods that can be used to prepare<br>
microparticles that contain an active agent. None of the documents described above solves<br>
the problem of removing residual solvent from microparticles containing a water soluble<br>
active agent, particularly when a halogenated solvent is used. None of the documents<br>
discussed above discloses a specific method for preparing microparticles that have lower<br>
residual solvent levels that is suitable for use with water soluble and non-water soluble active<br>
agents, as well as for halogenated solvents. Through the use of the non-aqueous washing<br>
system of the present invention, solvent levels can be significantly reduced to acceptable<br>
levels, while also maintaining acceptable levels of the active agent.<br>
[0011] Thus, there is a need in the art for a method for preparing microparticles having low<br>
residual solvent levels for water soluble and non-water soluble active agents. There is a<br>
further need in the art for a non-aqueous washing system that can be used to reduce residual<br>
solvent levels, for halogenated solvents and non-halogenated solvents. The present invention,<br>
the description of which is fully set forth below, solves the need in the art for such methods<br>
and system.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0012] The present invention relates to improved methods of preparing a pharmaceutical<br>
composition in microparticle form. In one aspect of the invention, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition is designed for the controlled release of an effective amount of an active agent<br>
over an extended period of time. The methods of the present invention may be carried out<br>
using pre-formed microparticles, or may additionally comprise the production of the<br>
microparticles. Particle formation may be effected by methods known to one skilled in the<br>
art, such as spray drying. More preferably, particle formation is effected by forming an<br>
emulsion, and removing solvent from the emulsion droplets to form microparticles. The<br>
invention also relates to the microparticles formed by the improved methods.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Overview<br>
[0066] The present invention relates to microparticles that contain an active agent, and<br>
methods for preparing such microparticles. The present invention provides a method for<br>
preparing microparticles, which have lower residual solvent levels, that is suitable for use<br>
with water-soluble and non-water soluble active agents, as well as for use with nalogenated<br>
solvents. Through the use of the non-aqueous washing system of the present invention,<br>
solvent levels can be significantly reduced to acceptable levels, while also maintaining<br>
acceptable levels of the active agent.<br>
[0067] In one embodiment of the present invention, a washing process is carried out on the<br>
microparticles. The washing process is carried out on a finished microparticle product, prior<br>
to any filling operation. It should be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, that the present<br>
invention is not limited to any particular method of preparing a finished microparticle<br>
product. For example, finished microparticles can be prepared using emulsion-based<br>
methods of preparing microparticles. Suitable emulsion-based methods that can be used to<br>
prepare finished microparticles include phase separation methods that use a coacervating<br>
agent Other suitable emulsion-based methods include non-phase separation methods that use<br>
other means for extracting solvent to form hardened microparticles. Suitable methods of<br>
preparing a finished microparticle product are disclosed in, for example, the following U.S.<br>
Patents, the entirety of each of which is incorporated herein by reference: 3,737,337;<br>
4,389,330; 5,407,609; 5,650,173; 5,654,008; 5,792,477; 5,916,598; 5,945,126; and<br>
6,110,503.<br>
[0068] In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the microparticles are made<br>
using an emulsion-based process. In such a preferred embodiment, the method of the present<br>
invention includes preparing an emulsion that comprises a first phase and a second phase.<br>
The first phase preferably comprises an active agent, a polymer, and a solvent for the<br>
polymer. The second phase is a continuous phase, preferably an aqueous phase. The solvent<br>
is extracted from the emulsion to form microparticles containing the active agent. The<br>
microparticles are contacted with a non-aqueous washing system to reduce the level of any<br>
halogenated solvent to less than about 0.06% by weight of the microparticles. Preferably, the<br>
non-aqueous washing system is either 100% ethanol, or a blend of ethanol and heptane.<br>
[0069] To ensure clarity of the description that follows, the following definitions are<br>
provided. By "washing system" or "washing solvent" is meant a solvent or solvent system<br>
that functions to facilitate extraction of polymer and/or active agent solvents, coacervating<br>
agents, and the like from the microparticles. By "hardening solvent" is meant a solvent that<br>
functions to harden coacervates into microparticles. The process of hardening microparticles<br>
may be referred to herein as a "quench" process. By "halogenated solvent" is meant<br>
halogenated organic solvents, i.e., C1-C4 halogenated alkanes, e.g., methylene chloride,<br>
chloroform, methyl chloride, carbon tetrachloride, ethylene dichloride, ethylene chloride,<br>
2,2,2-trichloroethane, and the like. By "microparticles" or "microspheres" is meant solid<br>
particles that contain an active agent or other substance dispersed or dissolved within a<br>
polymer that serves as a matrix or binder of the particle. The polymer is preferably<br>
biodegradable and biocompatible. By "biodegradable" is meant a material that should<br>
degrade by bodily processes to products readily disposable by the body and should not<br>
accumulate in the body. The products of the biodegradation should also be biocompatible<br>
with the body. By "biocompatible" is meant not toxic to the body, is pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable, is not carcinogenic, and does not significantly induce inflammation in body<br>
tissues. As used herein, "body" preferably refers to the human body, but it should be<br>
understood that body can also refer to a non-human animal body. By "weight %" or "% by<br>
weight" is meant parts by weight per hundred parts total weight of microparticle. For<br>
example, 10 wt.% active agent would mean 10 parts active agent by weight and 90 parts<br>
polymer by weight. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary, percentages (%) reported<br>
herein are by weight. By "controlled release microparticle" or "sustained release<br>
microparticle" is meant a microparticle from which an active agent or other type of substance<br>
is released as a function of time. By "mass median diameter" is meant the diameter at which<br>
half of the distribution (volume percent) has a larger diameter and half has a smaller<br>
diameter.<br>
Methods of the Present Invention<br>
[0070] Turning now to FIG. 1, one embodiment of a process of the present invention for<br>
making microparticles is shown. In such a process, a polymer solution is formed by<br>
dissolving the polymer in a polymer solvent such as methylene chloride (CH2Cl2, referred to<br>
herein as "MeCl"). Solvents for the polymer will vary depending upon, for example, the<br>
nature of the polymer, the active agent, and compatibility with other solvents being used. It<br>
should be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to<br>
the use of MeCl or to the use of halogenated solvents. Selection of a suitable solvent would<br>
be readily apparent to one skilled in the art. The polymer is preferably a biodegradable,<br>
biocompatible polymer, such as poly(glycolic acid), poly(d,l-lactic acid), poly(l-lactic acid),<br>
copolymers, of the foregoing, and the like. Preferred polymers include poly(lactide-co-<br>
glycolide) materials (PLGA). Solvents suitable for such polymers include MeCl, chloroform,<br>
ethyl acetate, substituted pyrrolidone, and the like. It should be readily apparent to one<br>
skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to a particular polymer. Other<br>
suitable polymers include, for example, poly(aliphatic carboxylic acids), copolyoxalates,<br>
polycaprolactone, polydioxanone, poly(ortho carbonates), poly(acetals), poly(lactic acid-<br>
caprolactone), polyorthoesters, poly(glycolic acid-caprolactone), polyanhydrides,<br>
polyphosphazines, and natural polymers including albumin, casein, and waxes, such as<br>
glycerol mono- and distearate, and the like.<br>
[0071] In a step 110, an aqueous peptide solution is emulsified with the polymer solution to<br>
form an emulsion (W/O emulsion). Peptides suitable for use with the present invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues,<br>
such as goserelin.<br>
[0072] In a step 120, silicone oil is added to the emulsion as a coacervating agent to form a<br>
combined phase. Silicone (polydimethylsiloxane) is an incompatible polymer to PLGA, and<br>
acts to extract methylene chloride from the polymer solution. As would be readily apparent<br>
to one skilled in the art, other suitable coacervating agents could be used depending upon the<br>
polymer and solvent. After addition of a small volume of silicone oil, embryonic<br>
microparticles form. Once the microparticles form, the combined phase is transferred in a<br>
step 130 to an extraction or quench tank that contains an extraction or quench medium such<br>
as heptane. Heptane is a non-solvent to the polymer, but is a good solvent for both the<br>
polymer solvent methylene chloride and the coacervating agent silicone oil. It should be<br>
understood that the present invention is not limited to use of heptane as an extraction<br>
medium. As would be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, other extraction media can be<br>
used. Preferably, the extraction medium is a non-solvent for the polymer being used, but a<br>
solvent for both the polymer solvent and coacervating agent being used. Microparticles<br>
precipitate out of the extraction medium. In a step 140, the precipitated microparticles are<br>
recovered, and optionally dried in a manner known to one skilled in the art.<br>
[0073] The microparticles recovered in step 140 have residual solvent levels of methylene<br>
chloride, a halogenated solvent, that are unacceptably high, in excess of approximately 1%.<br>
International guidelines for parenteral materials (ICH Guidelines) require a maximum MeCl<br>
level of 0.06%. In order to reduce the level of residual solvent, a washing step 150 is carried<br>
out with a non-aqueous washing system. In one embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
non-aqueous washing system is 100% of an alcohol, preferably ethanol. Other suitable<br>
alcohols include, but are not limited to, methanol, 2-propanol, and isopropanol. In an<br>
alternative embodiment of the present invention, the non-aqueous washing system is a blend<br>
of an alcohol and a liquid alkane. Suitable liquid alkanes include, but are not limited to,<br>
pentane, hexane, and heptane. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the non-<br>
aqueous washing system is a blend of ethanol and heptane. Washing step 150 is carried out<br>
to reduce the level of residual solvent in the microparticles. Preferably, washing step 150 is<br>
carried out until the level of MeCl, or other halogenated solvent in the microparticles, is less<br>
than about 0.06% by weight Thereafter, the microparticles are recovered and dried in a<br>
manner known to one skilled in the art, as shown in a step 160. The microparticles can then<br>
be filled into vials for storage and use, as shown in a step 170.<br>
[0074] The non-aqueous washing system of the present invention is preferred over<br>
conventional aqueous washing solutions, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,792,477. Although aqueous washing solutions may reduce solvent levels, they result in<br>
unacceptable depletion of the peptide from the microparticles. Through the use of the non-<br>
aqueous washing system of the present invention, solvent levels can be significantly reduced<br>
to acceptable levels, while also maintaining acceptable levels of the peptide.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0075] Microparticles were prepared in accordance with the phase separation method<br>
described above and shown in FIG. 1. The polymer solution was prepared by dissolving<br>
2.7144 g 65:35 poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid), MEDISORB® 6535 DL 2M polymer,<br>
approximately 20 kD molecular weight (Alkermes, Inc.) in 40.2 g methylene chloride. An<br>
approximate 30 wt% aqueous goserelin solution was prepared by dissolving 339.9 mg<br>
goserelin containing 82.8% peptide content (Polypeptide Laboratories) in 0.816 g deionized<br>
water. The polymer and goserelin solutions were mixed and probe sonicated for 20 seconds<br>
to form a water-in-oil emulsion. The emulsion was added to a 250-ml glass reactor. The stir<br>
speed was 1000 RPM. The polymeric precipitant, 350 centistoke silicone oil (Dow Coming)<br>
was slowly added by peristaltic pump to the reactor to induce phase separation. Addition was<br>
discontinued after adding a total of 62.2 g (1.5 to 1 ratio of silicone oil to methylene chloride)<br>
over a time period of approximately 5 minutes. The embryonic microparticles were gravity<br>
transferred into a 3 liter heptane quench at 22°C. After about 3 hours in the heptane quench,<br>
the microparticles were harvested by vacuum filtration and dried overnight under vacuum.<br>
The theoretical loading of the microparticles was 9.5 wt%.<br>
[0076] After completion of the recovery and drying step 140, samples of the goserelin<br>
microparticles were subjected to various washing treatments or process stages as shown in<br>
step 150. The processing stages included a control (no washing), and washing with the<br>
following washing systems for a period of about two hours: water at 0 °C; water at 30 °C;<br>
100% ethanol at 30 °C; 100% ethanol at 0 °C; 50% ethanol/50% water at 15 °C. After the<br>
washing treatment, the microparticles were recovered and dried. The residual solvent levels<br>
(GC), and the goserelin content (HPLC), were measured for the dried microparticles, as<br>
shown below in Table 1.<br>
[0077] As can be seen from Table 1, the control with sample 1 resulted in high levels of<br>
goserelin content, but unacceptably high levels of residual solvent, particularly MeCl. The<br>
aqueous washing systems used with samples 2, 3, and 6 resulted in significant depletion of<br>
goserelin content, although they were effective in reducing the levels of residual solvents.<br>
The non-aqueous washing system used with samples 4 and 5 reduced the residual solvent<br>
levels, while maintaining the levels of goserelin content. The 100% ethanol washing system<br>
at 30°C resulted in the highest level of goserelin content, with below detectable levels of<br>
MeCl. Since "none detected" is less than 0.01 wt %, such microparticles would meet the<br>
ICH guidelines for parental materials.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0078] Further experiments were done to determine the effect of temperature.on solvent<br>
extraction using 100% ethanol. Microparticles were prepared in accordance with the method<br>
described above for Example 1. After completion of the recovery and drying step 140,<br>
samples of the goserelin microparticles were subjected to various washing treatments as<br>
shown in step 150. The process stages included a control (no washing), and washing with the<br>
following washing systems for a period of about two hours: 100% ethanol at 10 °C; 100%<br>
ethanol at 21 °C; and 100% ethanol at 26 °C. After the washing treatment, the microparticles<br>
were recovered and dried. The residual solvent levels (GC), and the goserelin content<br>
(HPLC), were measured for the dried microparticles, as shown below in Table 2.<br>
[0079] As can be seen from Table 2, the temperature had little effect on the goserelin<br>
content, and a significant effect on the residual solvent levels. At a temperature of 26 °C, the<br>
goserelin content remained high, with a residual solvent level of MeCl of 0.05 wt. %.<br>
Example 3<br>
[0080] Three separate samples of microparticles were prepared in accordance with the<br>
method described above for Example 1. The microparticles were recovered from the<br>
extraction tank containing heptane in step 140, but were not dried. Without drying, sample 1<br>
was placed immediately into 100% ethanol. For samples 2 and 3, the microparticles were<br>
allowed to settle in the extraction tank. Because of the low specific gravity of heptane, the<br>
microparticles settle quickly. For sample 2, a portion of the heptane was decanted and<br>
ethanol added to result in a 3:1 ratio of ethanol to remaining heptane. For sample 3, a portion<br>
of the heptane was decanted and ethanol added to result in a 1:1 ratio of ethanol to remaining<br>
heptane. The washing treatment for samples 1, 2, and 3 was carried out at 20°C for a period<br>
of about two hours. After the washing treatment, the microparticles were recovered and<br>
dried. The residual solvent levels (GC), and the goserelin content (HPLC), were measured<br>
for the dried microparticles, as shown below in Table 3.<br>
[0081] As can be seen from Table 3, a washing system using ethanol and heptane<br>
maintained the levels of goserelin content while significantly reducing the residual solvent<br>
levels.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0082] Further experiments were done to determine the effect of wash time on solvent<br>
extraction using 100% ethanol. A six-gram batch of 9.5% theoretically loaded goserelin<br>
microparticles was prepared in accordance with the method described above for Example 1.<br>
The microparticles were recovered from the extraction tank containing heptane in step 140,<br>
but were not dried. Samples of the goserelin microparticles were subjected to various<br>
washing treatments as shown in step 150. The process stages included a control (no<br>
washing), and washing with 100% ethanol at 15°C for periods of IS, 30, 60, 90, and 120<br>
minutes. After the washing treatment, the microparticles were recovered and dried. The<br>
residual solvent levels (GC) and the goserelin content (HPLC), were measured for the dried<br>
microparticles, as shown below in Table 4.<br>
[0083] As can be seen from Table 4, residual levels of MeCl decrease rapidly and reach the<br>
target of 0.06% between 15 and 30 minutes. Goserelin levels are maintained for about 60<br>
minutes and then decline slightly.<br>
Example 5<br>
[0084] A 50 gram batch of 5% theoretically loaded BSA microparticles was prepared by a<br>
phase separation process. The polymer solution was prepared by dissolving 45.5 g 65:35<br>
poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid), MEDISORB® 6535 DL 2M polymer, approximately 20 kD<br>
molecular weight (Alkermes, Inc.) in 698.0 g methylene chloride. An aqueous bovine serum<br>
albumin (BSA) solution was prepared by dissolving 2.48 g BSA in 13.5 g deionized water.<br>
The polymer and BSA solutions were mixed and probe sonicated for 1 minute to establish a<br>
water-in-oil emulsion. The emulsion was added to a 2 liter glass reactor. The stir speed was<br>
set to 1000 RPM. The polymeric precipitant, 350 centistoke silicone oil (Dow Corning) was<br>
slowly added to the reactor to induce phase separation. Addition was discontinued after<br>
adding a total of 1032 g over a time period of approximately 8 minutes. The amount of<br>
silicone oil was approximately a 1.5 to 1 ratio of silicone oil to methylene chloride. The<br>
embryonic microparticles were gravity transferred into a 10 gallon heptane quench at about<br>
3°C. After about 2 hours in the heptane quench, the microparticles were collected onto a<br>
cone filter containing a 25 micron stainless steel mesh. The microparticles were backflushed<br>
into the quench tank with 14.3 kg ethanol. The jacket temperature was increased to about<br>
15°C and stirred for 5 hours. Samples of the microparticle/ethanol slurry were taken, dried<br>
overnight, and analyzed for residual solvent levels (GC).<br>
[0085] Processing stages included a control (no washing), and washing with 100% ethanol<br>
at 15°C for periods of 0.5,1,2, and 3 hours (samples 2-5, respectively). As can be seen from<br>
the residual solvent levels shown below in Table 5, a wash time of greater than about one<br>
hour resulted in residual solvent levels of MeCl of about 0.01 wt%, significantly less than<br>
about 0.06 wt%.<br>
[0086] Samples 6-9 in Table 5 were all subjected to the 3 hour ETOH wash. Samples 6-9<br>
were then dried, using either a nitrogen purge or a vacuum dry as shown in Table 5. The<br>
additional drying regimen did not appear to have any effect on the residual levels of heptane<br>
orMeCl.<br>
Example 6<br>
[0087] A 50 gram batch of 5% theoretically loaded BSA microparticles was prepared in the<br>
manner described above in Example 5. However, the ethanol wash temperature was 20°C.<br>
Samples 1 through 3 (shown below in Table 6) were taken after 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2<br>
hours, respectively, in the heptane quench, and were not subjected to a washing treatment.<br>
Samples 4 through 8 were subjected to the 100% ethanol washing system at 20°C for 45<br>
minutes, 1.5 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, and 5 hours, respectively. As can be seen from the<br>
residual solvent levels shown below in Table 6, increasing the wash time from about 45<br>
minutes to about 1.5 hours reduced the residual solvent level of Med from 0.2 wt% to none<br>
detected.<br>
[0088] Turning now to FIG. 2, another embodiment of a process of the present invention for<br>
making microparticles is shown. In such a process, a first phase is prepared that comprises an<br>
active agent, a polymer, and a solvent. The polymer is preferably a biodegradable,<br>
biocompatible polymer, such as poly(glycolic acid), poly(d,l-lactic acid), poly(l-lactic acid),<br>
copolymers of the foregoing, and the like. Preferred polymers include poh/(lactide-co-<br>
glycolide) materials (PLGA). The solvent is preferably a solvent for the polymer. The<br>
solvent may also be a solvent for the active agent. Alternatively, the active agent is<br>
dispersed, rawer than dissolved, in the first phase. In yet another alternative embodiment, a<br>
first solvent is used for the polymer, and a second solvent is used for the active agent In<br>
such an embodiment, the polymer solution and the active agent solution are combined to<br>
form the first phase. A second continuous phase is prepared. The first phase is substantially<br>
immiscible with the second phase. The first and second phases are combined in a step 210 to<br>
form an emulsion. Step 210 can be carried out, for example, by combining the first and<br>
second phases in a mixer such as a static mixer.<br>
[0089] In a step 230, solvent is extracted from the emulsion. In one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, solvent is extracted using an extraction liquid to extract solvent from the<br>
emulsion, thereby hardening the emulsion droplets to form microparticles mat contain the<br>
active agent. Such solvent extraction can be carried out, for example, in a tank containing the<br>
extraction liquid. In a step 240, the hardened microparticles are recovered, and optionally<br>
dried in a manner known to one skilled in the art.<br>
[0090] In order to further reduce the level of residual solvents in the microparticles, a<br>
washing step 250 is carried out with a non-aqueous washing system. In one embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the non-aqueous washing system is an alcohol, preferably 100%<br>
ethanol. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the non-aqueous washing<br>
system is a blend of an alcohol and a liquid alkane, preferably ethanol and heptane. Washing<br>
step 250 is carried out to reduce the level of residual solvent in the microparticles.<br>
Preferably, washing step 250 is carried out until the level of residual solvent in the<br>
microparticles is reduced to acceptable levels. Thereafter, the microparticles are recovered<br>
and dried in a manner known to one skilled in the art, as shown in a step 260. The<br>
microparticles can then be filled into vials for storage and use, as shown in a step 270.<br>
Example 7<br>
[0091] Microparticles containing risperidone were prepared at the one-kilogram scale in<br>
accordance with the method described above and shown in FIG. 2. The 1 Kg process (400<br>
grams of active agent and 600 grams of polymer) provides a theoretical drug loading of the<br>
microparticles of 40%.<br>
[0092] A 16.7 wt. % polymer solution was prepared by dissolving 600 grams of 90:10 poly<br>
(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid), MEDISORB® 9010 DL, approximate molecular weight of 100-<br>
120 kD (Alkennes, Inc.) in ethyl acetate (EtAc). A 24 wt. % drug solution was prepared by<br>
dissolving 400 grams of risperidone (Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium) in benzyl<br>
alcohol (BA). An active agent/polymer solution (organic phase) was prepared by mixing the<br>
drug solution into the polymer solution. The active agent/polymer solution was maintained at<br>
a temperature of 25±5°C.<br>
[0093] The second, continuous phase was prepared by preparing a 30 liter solution of 1%<br>
PVA, the PVA acting as an emulsifier. To this was added 2086 grams of ethyl acetate to<br>
fonn a 6.5 wt% solution of ethyl acetate. The two phases were combined using a static<br>
mixer, such as a 1" Kenics static mixer available from Chemineer, Inc., North Andover, MA,<br>
to form an emulsion as shown in step 210.<br>
[0094] The emulsion was transferred to a solvent extraction medium, as in step 230. The<br>
solvent extraction medium was 2.5% solution of ethyl acetate and water-for-injection (WFI)<br>
at 5-10°C. The volume of the solvent extraction medium is 0.25L per gram of batch size.<br>
[0095] After completion of the solvent extraction step, the microparticles were collected,<br>
de-watered, and dried, as in step 240. The temperature was maintained at less than about<br>
15°C.<br>
[0096] After completion of the recovery and drying step 240, samples of the risperidone<br>
microparticles were subjected to various process stages or washing treatments as shown in<br>
step 250. The process stages included a control (no washing), and washing with the<br>
following washing systems for a period of about six hours: . 100% ethanol at ambient<br>
temperature (20°C); 100% ethanol at 4 °C; and 100% ethanol at 10 °C. After the washing<br>
treatment, the microparticles were collected onto a 25 um screen, rinsed with cold WFI, and<br>
dried to form finished microparticles. The residual solvent levels (GC), and the risperidone<br>
content (HPLC), were measured for the finished microparticles, as shown below in Table 7.<br>
[0097] The finished microparticles for samples 1-3 were free flowing powders, indicating<br>
that the level of residual solvents, particularly benzyl alcohol, had been reduced to acceptable<br>
levels for a useful product. Preferably, the level of residual processing solvents is<br>
individually reduced to a level in the range of from about 0.2 to about 2.0 wt. %. As can be<br>
seen from Table 7, the 100% ethanol washing system of the present invention significantly<br>
reduced the individual residual solvent level to less than about 0.2 wt. %, while maintaining<br>
the risperidone content at an acceptable level.<br>
[0098] Turning now to FIG. 3, another embodiment of a process of the present invention for<br>
making microparticles is shown. In such a process, an active agent is dispersed or dissolved<br>
in an aqueous medium. The aqueous solution is mixed with an organic solvent in which is<br>
dissolved a polymer, resulting in a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion. The polymer is preferably a<br>
biodegradable, biocompatible polymer, such as poly(glycolic acid), poly(d,l-lactic acid),<br>
poly(l-lactic acid), copolymers of the foregoing, and the like. Preferred polymers include<br>
poly(lactide-co-glycolide) materials (PLGA). The aqueous solution and the polymer solution<br>
are combined in a step 310 to form an emulsion. Step 310 can be carried out, for example, by<br>
combining the two solutions in a mixer such as a static mixer. Alternatively, step 310 can be<br>
carried out using suitable emulsion techniques such as sonication or homogenization.<br>
[0099] In a step 320, a coacervating agent is added to the emulsion, preferably with<br>
continuous stirring. The coacervating agent is preferably a non-solvent for the polymer.<br>
Suitable coacervating agents include, but are not limited to, dimethicone and silicone oil.<br>
The polymer precipitates to encapsulate the active agent to form coacervates or embryonic<br>
microparticles.<br>
[0100] In a step 330, the dispersion of coacervates is added to a solvent blend that includes<br>
a hardening solvent and a washing solvent. The solvent blend extracts polymer solvent and<br>
the coacervating agent from the coacervates, to thereby form hardened microparticles. The<br>
solvent blend is a physical blend of two types of solvents: a hardening solvent that is used to<br>
harden the coacervates into microparticles; and a washing solvent that is used to facilitate<br>
extraction of polymer solvent and coacervating agent from the microparticles. Suitable<br>
hardening solvents include, but are not limited to, heptane, hexane, cyclohexane, diethyl<br>
ether, petroleum ether, mineral oil, fatty acid esters, and caprylate triglyceride. Suitable<br>
washing solvents include, but are not limited to, ethanol and isopropanol. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the hardening solvent is a liquid alkane, and the<br>
washing solvent is an alcohol. In an alternate preferred embodiment, the hardening solvent is<br>
heptane and the washing solvent is ethanol. In further embodiments, the solvent blend is<br>
made up of 90% heptane and 10% ethanol, and 95% heptane and 5% ethanol. Preferably, the<br>
solvent blend is made up of from about 50% heptane and about 50% ethanol to about 95%<br>
heptane and about 5% ethanol.<br>
[0101] In one embodiment of the method shown in FIG. 3, a step 340 is earned out after<br>
step 330 to rinse the microparticles with a hardening solvent. The hardening solvent used in<br>
step 340 may be the same as, or different from, the hardening solvent used in step 330. The<br>
volume of hardening solvent used in step 340 is preferably equal to or less than the volume of<br>
the solvent blend used in step 330. Step 340 may be carried out to ensure complete hardening<br>
of the microparticles.<br>
[0102] In a step 350, the hardened microparticles are recovered, and optionally dried in a<br>
manner known to one skilled in the art. The microparticles can then be filled into vials for<br>
storage and use, as shown in a step 360. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention,<br>
step 340 is eliminated, and the microparticles are recovered and optionally dried in step 350<br>
after step 330.<br>
Example 8<br>
[0103] Microparticles were prepared in accordance with the method described above and<br>
shown in FIG. 3. The polymer solution was prepared by dissolving 9.8g 50:50 poly(d,l-<br>
lactic-co-glycolic acid), MEDISORB® 5050DL 4A polymer, approximate molecular weight<br>
of 50 kD (Alkermes, Inc.) in methylene chloride in an Erlenmeyer flask. About 100 mg of<br>
sucrose was dissolved in 2 g of water for injection at room temperature in a scintillation vial.<br>
The sucrose solution was added to the polymer solution and sonicated using a probe sonicator<br>
at 40% amplitude for 1 minute duration. The sonication was repeated 3 times with a 3 minute<br>
gap in between. The resulting emulsion was transferred into a 500 ml reactor and stirred at<br>
907 rpm using an impeller. 225 g of dimethicone (350 centistoke) was added using a glass<br>
syringe and funnel over a period of 20 minutes. The coacervate dispersion was transferred<br>
into 3 different beakers containing 1000 g of the following solvents: 100% heptane (Batch<br>
1 A); 90% heptane/10% ethanol (Batch 1B); and 50% heptane/50% ethanol (Batch 1C).<br>
[0104] The solvents were kept in an ice bath (2.2 to 2.5°C) and stirred for about 60 minutes.<br>
The suspension was allowed to settle down and the solvents were decanted. 1000 g of fresh<br>
heptane was added to each of the beakers, and stirred for 30 minutes. The microparticles<br>
were collected using vacuum filtration. The collected microparticles were transferred to<br>
petri-dish and allowed to dry at room temperature overnight<br>
[0105] Two additional batches (2A and 2B) were prepared using the process described<br>
above for Batches 1A-1C. After the sonication step described above, the emulsion was<br>
transferred to a 500 ml reactor. With continuous stirring at 1630 rpm, 225 g of dimethicone<br>
(1000 centistoke) was slowly added to the reactor using a peristaltic pump. The coacervate<br>
dispersion was transferred to 2 separate beakers each containing 1000 g of heptane<br>
(Batch 2A) and 90% heptane/10% ethanol (Batch 2B) respectively. After 60 minutes of<br>
mixing, the solvent was decanted and the microparticles were further hardened with 500g of<br>
fresh heptane. The products were recovered and dried in a static cone dryer.<br>
[0106] The residual solvent levels for Batches lA-lC and 2A-2B are shown below in<br>
Table 8. As shown in Table 8, the 90% heptane/10% ethanol and 50% heptane/50% ethanol<br>
solvent combinations produced microparticles with lower levels of methylene chloride (e.g.,<br>
reduction improvement of 48% to 68%) and heptane (e.g., reduction improvement of 12% to<br>
28%) compared to the 100% heptane solvent. However, microparticles produced with the<br>
50% heptane/50% ethanol solvent combination had poor handling characteristics, while the<br>
90% heptane/10% ethanol solvent combination resulted in microparticles with acceptable<br>
handling characteristics.<br>
Example 9<br>
[0107] Two batches of microparticles (Batches 1 and 2) were prepared using a two-step<br>
quench (or harden)/wash process, consisting of a heptane quench step followed by an ethanol<br>
wash step. Batch 1 was prepared at a 100 gram scale, containing 1% sucrose. Batch 2 was<br>
prepared at a 10 gram scale in the same manner as described below for Batch 1.<br>
[0108] The microparticles were manufactured by a phase separation process. The polymer<br>
solution was prepared by dissolving 98 g 50:50 poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid),<br>
MEDISORB® 5050DL 4A polymer, molecular weight of approximately 50 kD (Alkermes,<br>
Inc.) in 1533 g methylene chloride. The sucrose encapsulate solution was prepared by<br>
dissolving 0.98 grams sucrose in 21 grams deionized water. The polymer and sucrose<br>
solutions were mixed and probe sonicated for 3 minutes to form a water-in-oil emulsion. The<br>
emulsion was added to a 3-liter stainless steel reactor. The stir speed was set to 2100 RPM.<br>
The polymeric precipitant (coacervating agent), 350 centistoke silicone oil (Dow Coming),<br>
was added to the reactor to induce phase separation. Addition was discontinued after adding<br>
a total of 1534 g over a time period of approximately 4.25 minutes. The embryonic<br>
microparticles were gravity transferred into a 35-liter heptane quench at 20°C. After about 1<br>
hour in the heptane quench, the agitation was terminated to allow the microparticles to<br>
sediment. The heptane was decanted via a peristaltic pump. The microparticle washing stage<br>
was initiated by charging the concentrated slurry with 14.7 kg ethanol. After 2 hours, the<br>
microparticles were collected and dried for three days using a nitrogen purge.<br>
[0109] Two batches of microparticles were prepared by a one-step quench (or harden) and<br>
wash process in accordance with the method described above and shown in FIG. 3. For<br>
Batch 3, the polymer solution was prepared by dissolving 98 g 50:50 polytd.l-lactic-co-<br>
glycolic acid), MEDISORB® 5050DL 4A polymer, molecular weight of approximately<br>
50 kD (Alkermes, Inc.) in 1536 g methylene chloride. The sucrose encapsulate solution was<br>
prepared by dissolving 1.0 gram sucrose in 20 grams deionized water. The polymer and<br>
sucrose solutions were mixed and probe sonicated for 2 minutes to form a water-in-oil<br>
emulsion. The emulsion was added to a 3-liter stainless steel reactor. The stir speed was set<br>
to 1730 RPM. The polymeric precipitant (coacervating agent), 1000 centistoke silicone oil<br>
(Dow Coming), was added to the reactor to induce phase separation. Addition was<br>
discontinued after adding a total of 1534 g over a time period of approximately 5 minutes.<br>
The embryonic microparticles were gravity transferred into a 24 kg quench made up of 90%<br>
heptane and 10% ethanol at 5°C. After about 1 hour in the heptane quench, the agitation was<br>
terminated to allow the microparticles to sediment The heptane/ethanol was decanted via a<br>
peristaltic pump. The microparticles were rinsed with 12.6 kg heptane for 1 hour, collected,<br>
and dried for three days using a nitrogen purge.<br>
[0110] For Batch 4, 101.3 mg of sucrose and 99 mg AC2993 were dissolved in 2g acetate<br>
buffer (pH 4). 9.8 g of polymer, poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid), MEDISORB® 5050DL 4A<br>
polymer, molecular weight of approximately 50 kD (Alkermes, Inc.) was weighed and<br>
dissolved in 153 g of methylene chloride in an Erlenmeyer flask. The aqueous phase was<br>
added to the organic phase using syringe/needle and sonicated for 1 minute. Sonication was<br>
repeated twice with a 3 minute gap in between. The resulting emulsion was transferred into a<br>
coacervation reactor, and stirred at 1617 RFM using an impeller. 225 g of dimethicone (1000<br>
centistoke) was transferred to the reactor using a peristaltic pump over a period of 25<br>
minutes. The contents were mixed for 15 minutes at 1617 RPM. The coacervate dispersion<br>
was transferred by gravity into another tank containing 3600 g of heptane and 400 g ethanol<br>
stirred at approximately 800 RPM, and at a temperature of 3.9°C. After 90 minutes, stirring<br>
was stopped, and the microparticles were allowed to settle. The supernant was decanted.<br>
2000 g of fresh pre-chilled heptane (5°C) was added to the tank, and the agitation was<br>
continued for 1 hour. The tank was pressurized, and the product was collected in a cone filter<br>
assembly at 3°C. A final rinse/filtration was performed with 1000 g of fresh pre-chilled<br>
heptane. Drying was performed at 3°, 25°, and 35°C in a static cone dryer.<br>
[0111] The residual solvent levels for Batches 1-4 are shown below in Table 9. Table 9<br>
shows the residual solvent data for microparticles prepared using separate hardening and<br>
wash steps, and a 90% heptane/10% ethanol solvent combination step. As shown in Table 9,<br>
the 90% heptane/10% ethanol solvent combination step produced microparticles with lower<br>
levels of methylene chloride (e.g., reduction improvement of 55% to 56%) and heptane (e.g.,<br>
reduction improvement of 16% to 58%) compared with the separate hardening and wash<br>
steps.<br>
[0112] Preferred active agents that can be encapsulated by the process of the present<br>
invention include peptides. Preferred peptides include luteinizing-hormone-releasing-<br>
hormone analogues, such as goserelin, and exendin and exendin analogues. Other preferred<br>
active agents include 1,2-benzazoles, more particularly, 3-piperidinyl-substituted 1,2-<br>
benzisoxazoles and 1,2-benzisothiazoles, including 3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-<br>
1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one<br>
("risperidone") and 3-[2-[4-(6-fluro-1,2-ben2isoxazol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-6,7,8,9-<br>
tetrahydro-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one ("9-hydroxyrisperidone")<br>
and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Risperidone (which term, as used herein, is<br>
intended to include its pharmaceutically acceptable salts) is most preferred. Risperidone can<br>
be prepared in accordance with the teachings of U.S. Patent No. 4,804,663, the entirety of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. 9-hydroxyrisperidone can be prepared in<br>
accordance with the teachings of U.S. Patent No. 5,158,952, the entirety of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0113] Preferred examples of polymer matrix materials include poly(glycolic acid),<br>
poly(d,l-lactic acid), poly(l-lactic acid), copolymers of the foregoing, and the like. Various<br>
commercially available poly(lactide-co-glycolide) materials (PLGA) may be used in the<br>
method of the present invention. For example, poly (d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) is<br>
commercially available from Alkermes, Inc. (Blue Ash, OH). A suitable product<br>
commercially available from Alkermes, Inc. is a 50:50 poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid)<br>
known as MEDISORB® 5050 DL. This product has a mole percent composition of 50%<br>
lactide and 50% glycolide. Other suitable commercially available products are MEDISORB®<br>
6535 DL, 7525 DL, 8515 DL, 9010DL and poly(d,l-lactic acid) (100 DL). Poly(lactide-co-<br>
glycolides) are also commercially available from Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany) under its<br>
Resomer® mark, e.g., PLGA 50:50 (Resomer® RG 502), PLGA 75:25 (Resomer® RG 752)<br>
and d,l-PLA (Resomer® RG 206), and from Birmingham Polymers (Birmingham, Alabama).<br>
These copolymers are available in a wide range of molecular weights and ratios of lactic acid<br>
to glycolic acid.<br>
[0114] The molecular weight of the polymeric matrix material is of some importance. The<br>
molecular weight should be high enough to permit the formation of satisfactory polymer<br>
coatings, i.e., the polymer should be a good film former. Usually, a satisfactory molecular<br>
weight is in the range of 5,000 to 500,000 daltons, preferably from about 50,000 to 150,000<br>
daltons. However, since the properties of the film are also partially dependent on the<br>
particular polymeric matrix material being used, it is very difficult to specify an appropriate<br>
molecular weight range for all polymers. The molecular weight of the polymer is also<br>
important from the point of view of its influence upon the biodegradation rate of the polymer<br>
and the desired drug release duration of the product.<br>
[0115] The formulation prepared by the process of the present invention contains an active<br>
agent dispersed in the microparticle polymeric matrix material. The amount of such agent<br>
incorporated in the microparticles usually ranges from about 1 wt.% to about 90 wt.%.<br>
