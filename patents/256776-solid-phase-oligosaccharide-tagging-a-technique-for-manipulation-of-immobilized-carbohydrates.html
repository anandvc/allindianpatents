Solid-Phase Oligosaccharide Tagging: A technique for manipulation of immo-<br>
bilized carbohydrates.<br>
All patent and non-patent references cited herein are hereby incorporated by refer-<br>
ence.<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of carbohydrate manipulation. In particular,<br>
the invention relates to methods of manipulating immobilised carbohydrates by deri-<br>
vatisation. Depending on the nature of the derivatisation, the carbohydrate may<br>
thereby be more easily detected and/or identified or handled. Thus, in one aspect<br>
the invention relates to the field of carbohydrate detection and identification.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Carbohydrates exist in many forms in nature. In animals including man, examples<br>
include free reducing sugars in solution (such as the monosaccharide glucose in<br>
serum), free oligosaccharides in solution (such as the disaccharide lactose in milk),<br>
they can be attached to peptides or proteins through covalent linkages to a variety of<br>
amino acids (such as asparagine, serine, threonine and others), covalently attached<br>
to lipids such as ceramide (as in gangliosides) or attached to membrane anchors via<br>
phosphatidylinositols. Sugars are also found attached to many small molecules in-<br>
cluding some involved in metabolism, such as glucuronides. In the above examples,<br>
the length of the sugar chains can vary from one to over 100 sugar residues.<br>
In lower organisms, including bacteria and plants, an even wider array of structures<br>
exists. The surface of bacterial cells can be covered by sugar polymers that are<br>
thousands of residues long, which can act as antigens in the detection of bacteria<br>
and as vaccines. Sugars are an integral part of bacterial cell walls. The sugars can<br>
themselves be antibiotics (such as the aminoglycoside antibiotics, for example<br>
streptomycin), or can be found as essential components of antibiotics (such as<br><br>
erythromycin and vancomycin), as enzyme inhibitors (as in Acarbose) or as anti-<br>
cancer agents (such as for example calicheamycin).<br>
One area of particular interest is the structure of the carbohydrate chains (glycans)<br>
found attached to glycoproteins and glycoiipids. The glycosylation pattern of glyco-<br>
proteins has been shown to be important for their biologlcal functions, including their<br>
bioavailablity, their targeting, and have even been directly correlated with the metas-<br>
tatic potential of tumor cells. The glycosylation pattern of human serum transferrin,<br>
for example, is being used as a diagnostic test for a series of genetic diseases<br>
termed Carbohydrate-Deficient Glycosylation Syndromes. Specific glycolipid se-<br>
quences have been shown to be involved in neuronal development and cell surface<br>
signalling, in diabetes, and are accumulated in certain specific metabolic diseases<br>
such as Tay-Sachs, for which they are diagnostic.<br>
The linkages between the sugar residues in the oligosaccharides and polysaccha-<br>
rides described above can have either the alpha or beta configurations, and the gly-<br>
cans can be multiply branched. The diversity of structures possible for glycan chains<br>
is therefore enormous and their structural characterization is therefore inherently<br>
complex. There is therefore a strong interest in methods for the detection, structural<br>
characterization, identification, quantitation, and chemical/enzymatic manipulation of<br>
carbohydrate and glycan structures, in research, in diagnostics, in monitoring the<br>
glycosylation of recombinant glycoproteins and in the development of new pharma-<br>
ceutical agents.<br>
Several methods are in current use for the analysis for carbohydrate structures, and<br>
these have recently been reviewed. Underivatized oligosaccharides and glycoiipids<br>
can be analyzed by NMR-spectroscopy, by mass-spectrometry, and by chromatog-<br>
raphy. For the much larger glycoproteins, mass spectrometry provides more limited<br>
information but analysis of their proteolytic digests, i.e. glycopeptides, has been ex-<br>
tensively used. Indirect structural information about underivatized oligosaccharides<br>
can also be deduced from their abilities to interact with carbohydrate-binding pro-<br>
teins such as lectins, antibodies or enzymes.<br>
Carbohydrates themselves have no characteristic chromophores, only N-acetyl<br>
groups, so monitoring their separation by optical or spectroscopic detection is not<br><br>
commonly used. Pulsed amperometric detection of the polyols has however been an<br>
important technique for detection in chromatography.<br>
The most widely used method for high-sensitivity detection of carbohydrates has<br>
been the labeling of the reducing ends (lactols, tautomers of hydroxyaidehydes and<br>
hydroxyketones) with either radioactive or fluorescent TAGs. Both chemical and<br>
enzymatic methods have been described that cleave carbohydrates from glycopro-<br>
teins and glycolipids, permitting the generation of the required reducing sugars from<br>
glycoproteins, glycolipds and other glycoconjugates. Most commonly, such reducing<br>
sugars are reacted with amino-containing derivatives of fluorescent molecules under<br>
conditions of reductive amination: i.e., where the initially formed imines (C=N) are<br>
reduced to amines (CH-NH) to produce a stable linkage. In most cases, the labeling<br>
reactions have been performed in solution using a large excess of labeling agent.<br>
This requires separation of the excess labeling agent and its by-products prior to or<br>
during analysis. Other TAGs of utility in mass-spectrometry have been added in the<br>
same manner, by either amination or reductive amination, the detection then being<br>
performed by the mass-spectrometer.<br>
Once the label has been added to permit specific detection, the carbohydrates de-<br>
scribed above can subsequently be subjected to separation and detec-<br>
tion/quantification. Additional structural information can be obtained by exposing the<br>
tagged carbohydrates to enzymes such as glycosidases. If specific glycosidases act<br>
on the tagged carbohydrates, they can cleave one or more sugar residues resulting<br>
in a change in chromatographic or electrophoretic mobility, as detected by, for ex-<br>
ample, a fluorescence detector in HPLC, CE or by a change in their mobility in SDS-<br>
PAGE, or a change in their mass as detected by a change in m/z value in a mass-<br>
spectrometer. Arrays of enzymes have been used to provide a higher throughput<br>
analysis.<br>
Below a short overview of prior art is glven:<br>
Gao et al. 2003 reviews suitable techniques for derivatisation of carbohydrates in<br>
solution. In solution carbohydrates may be derivatised by reductive amination. In<br>
general, -NH2 groups of amines may react with aidehyde or ketone group of reduc-<br>
ing sugars, thereby producing compounds of -C=N structure. Such compounds may<br><br>
further be reduced for example by NaCNBH3. Gao et al., 2003 does not disclose<br>
manipulation of immobilised carbohydrates.<br>
US5,100,778 describes a method for oligosaccharide sequencing comprising plac-<br>
ing an identifylng label on the reducing terminal residue of an oligosaccharide, divid-<br>
ing into a plurality of separate portions, treating each portion with for example spe-<br>
cific glycosidases, pooling product and analysing the pools obtained. The document<br>
does not describe immobilised oligosaccharides.<br>
US4,419,444 describes methods for chemically binding organic compounds contain-<br>
ing carbohydrate residues to a support bearing reactive -NH2 groups. The methods<br>
involve either the periodate oxidation of carbohydrate diols to produce reactive aide-<br>
hydes by cleaving of C-C bonds in the carbohydrate or oxidation of -CH2OH groups<br>
to -CHO groups enzymatically. Both oxidations will result in alteration of the struc-<br>
ture of the carbohydrate. The reactive aidehydes can be immobilised by reaction<br>
with the -NH2 groups. After immobilisation of the carbohydrate containing com-<br>
pound a reduction step (for example using NaBH4) may be performed to increase<br>
stability. The document describes neither the immobilization of a reducing sugar<br>
through its reducing end nor manipulation of immobilised altered carbohydrate con-<br>
taining compounds via the reduced amine bond. Furthermore, the chemical nature<br>
of the carbohydrate has been altered and this alteration may impair further modula-<br>
tions, such as specific enzymatic cleavage by glycosidases. The document also<br>
does not describe the addition of any chemical reagents to the immobilised oligo-<br>
saccharide that result in the addition of molecular structures to it.<br>
W092/719974 describes a method of sequencing oligosaccharides. The method<br>
involves immobilising oligosaccharides on a solid support and subsequent treatment<br>
with a variety of glycosidases. Prior to immoblisation, the oligosaccharide may be<br>
linked to a conjugate. The document does not describe modulation of immobilised<br>
oligosaccharides other than glycosidase treatment.<br>
The above describes the biologlcal importance and complexity of glycans, and<br>
summarizes some benefits of attaching TAGs to reducing sugars, such as mono-<br>
saccharides, as well as to the reducing sugar end of oligosaccharides. To date, such<br>
attachment has been performed in solution using large excesses of tagglng agent<br><br>
(and often additional chemical agents such as reducing agents), and thus require<br>
time consuming and frequently difficult separation techniques to be applied before<br>
either detection or further manipulation. Such separation techniques invariably result<br>
in losses of material, and dilution, thus considerably complicating and biasing the<br>
analysis. There is therefore a great need for simple methods that can install a TAG<br>
onto a carbohydrate structure and further manipulate the structure, without the need<br>
for complex and biased methods for separating reaction starting materials, reagents,<br>
by-products and sought after products. We describe herein such simple methods.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods of covalent attachment of reducing sugars,<br>
(which may be any of the reducing sugars mentioned herein below in the section<br>
"Reducing sugar") to a solid-support (which may be any of the solid supports de-<br>
scribed herein below in the section "Solid support") through reaction with an immobi-<br>
lized molecule consisting of an optional spacer (i.e. with or without spacer) and a<br>
linker (which can be cleavable) that incorporates a capture group containing an -NH2<br>
functionality. The resulting immobilized sugar has an acyclic form with a C=N bond,<br>
which may be in equilibrium with it's cyclic glycosylamine tautomer.<br>
Free -NH2 groups on the solid support after immobilisation may be capped and the<br>
C=N bond can be reduced. This method is outlined in fig. 1 A+B^E. The figure<br>
shows an underivatised pyranose, which however is meant to represent any reduc-<br>
ing sugar.<br>
In a variation, the methods of the invention may comprise reduction of the immobi-<br>
lized sugar containing a C=N bond (exemplified by structure C, fig. 1) to CH-NH prior<br>
to capping free -NH2 groups, producing a compound of structure Cred (fig. 1). The -<br>
NH2 groups in Cred may then be capped at this stage to produce a compound of the<br>
same structure E as that produced by the sequence C to D to E described above<br>
and shown in fig. 1.<br>
Compounds of the structure E may thus be produced by either the sequence A+B<br>
goes to C goes to D goes to E, or A+B goes to C goes to Cred goes to E.<br><br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide methods of preparing a<br>
reactive sugar, said method comprising the steps of<br>
i. Providing a sample comprising a reducing sugar (such as A in fig. 1)<br>
ii. Providing a solid support (e.g. solid in fig. 1) covalently attached to a<br>
linker comprising a capture group comprising an -NH2 group, wherein<br>
said linker optionally is attached to said solid support via a spacer (such<br>
as B in fig. 1)<br>
iii. Reacting said reducing sugar with said -NH2 group, thereby obtaining<br>
an immobilised sugar (such as C in fig. 1),<br>
iv. Reacting free -NH2 groups with a capping agent, wherein the capping<br>
agent comprises a reactive group capable of reacting with a -NH2 group<br>
v. Reducing C=N bonds with a reducing agent<br>
vi. thereby obtaining a reactive sugar containing the structure SugarCHn-<br>
NH- linked to a solid support via a linker and optionally a spacer, wherein<br>
n is 1 or 2 (such as compound E of fig. 1),<br>
wherein steps iv and v may be performed in any order.<br>
In embodiments of the invention wherein step iv is performed prior to step v, capping<br>
-NH2 groups in step iv will for example result in compound D of fig. 1, whereas the<br>
reduction performed in step v will for example result in compound E of fig. 1;<br>
In embodiments of the invention wherein step v is performed prior to step iv, then<br>
the reduction of the C=N bond (for example of compound C of fig. 1) will for example<br>
result in compound Cred of fig. 1. The capping of the -NH2 groups in step iv will for<br>
example produce the compounds of structure E, fig.1. It is comprised within the pre-<br>
sent invention that the sample comprising the reducing sugar may be incubated with<br>
the solid support and the reducing agent simultaneously. Thus, reduction of C=N<br>
bonds (step v) will be performed immediately following reaction of the reducing<br>
sugar with the -NH2 group of the solid support (step iii).<br><br>
In step iii), preferably, the reducing end of said reducing sugar is reacted with said -<br>
NH2 group. Thus preferably the aidehyde group or the hemiacetal of the reducing<br>
sugar is reacted with the -NH2 group.<br>
it is preferred that the methods further comprise the step of<br>
vii. Reacting the -NH- group of the reactive sugar (for example com-<br>
pound E of fig. 1) with a derivatising agent comprising a nitrogen-<br>
reactive functional group (X), thereby obtaining a sugar covalently at-<br>
tached to said agent. Said sugar covalently attached to said agent may<br>
for example be compound F of fig. 1 (when the derivatising agent is a<br>
TAG) or compound H of fig.1, when the derivatising agent is a tether<br>
linked to functional group.<br>
The term "TAG" in the present context, and in fig. 1 (vide infra) is meant to indicate<br>
any atom, molecule or entity that can become covalently attached to another mole-<br>
cule thereby labelling said another molecule as having undergone the covalent at-<br>
tachment.<br>

Detalled description of the invention<br>
Methods of manipulating a reducing sugar.<br>
The present invention relates to methods of manipulating a reducing sugar. An ex-<br>
ample of the methods of the invention is outlined in fig. 1. It should be noted that the<br>
methods of the invention do not necessarily involve all of the steps illustrated in fig.<br>
1. Thus the methods may comprise only some of the steps outlined in fig. 1. Pref-<br><br>
erably, the methods will comprise at least the steps A+B—&gt;C, C-&gt;D and D-&gt;E, or the<br>
steps A+B-&gt;C, C—&gt;Cred and Cred-&gt;E  In fig, 1 the reducing sugar is exemplified by a<br>
pyranose, however any reducing sugar may be used with the invention, in particular<br>
any of the reducing sugars described herein below in the section "Reducing sugar".<br>
The -OH group dissecting the pyranose ring in fig. 1 is meant to indicate that the<br>
reducing sugar may bear one or more hydroxyl groups attached to it.<br>
Each of the steps of the methods of the invention are described herein below in<br>
more detall, wherein capital letters A to J and Cred refer to fig. 1<br>
The identity of each of the compounds or intermediates of the present invention, for<br>
example of compounds A, B, C, Cred D, E, F, G, H, I or J may be verified by stan-<br>
dard techniques known to the skilled person, such as by NMR.<br>
A. Reducing sugar<br>
The term "reducing sugar" as used herein covers the classical definition of sugars<br>
that are capable of reducing Cu2+ to Cu+. Whether a sugar is reducing may for ex-<br>
ample be tested using Fehlings reagent. In more modem terminology, reducing<br>
sugars are sugars that comprise an aidehyde group or a hemiacetal of the formula<br>
R2C(OH)OR', wherein R' is not H. Preferably, a reducing sugar is a carbohydrate<br>
structure containing an aidehyde, which is in equilibrium with the cyclized form<br>
called a hemiacetal. D-glucose is a non-iimiting example of such a reducing sugar.<br>
The most abundant cyclic forms contain 5-membered rings, termed furanoses, and<br>
6-membered rings termed pyranoses. (See rules of nomenclature).<br>
The term "sugar" as used herein covers monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, poly-<br>
saccharides, as well as compounds comprising monosaccharide, oligosaccharide,<br>
or polysaccharide. The terms "carbohydrate" and "sugar" are herein used inter-<br>
changeably.<br><br>
Oligosaccharides and polysaccharides are compounds consisting of monosaccha-<br>
rides linked glycosidically. in general polysaccharides comprise at least 10 mono-<br>
saccharide residues, whereas oligosaccharides in general comprise in the range of<br>
2 to 10 monosaccharides. Oligosaccharides and polysaccharides may be linear or<br>
branched. A monosaccharide is defined as a polyhydroxy aidehyde H-(CHOH)n-<br>
CHO or polyhydroxyketone H-(CHOH)n-CO-(CHOH)m-H, wherein m and n are inte-<br>
gers. Preferred monosaccharides comprises in the range of 4 to 9 carbons, thus<br>
preferably for polyhydroxy aidehydes n is an integer in the range of 3 to 8 and for<br>
polyhydroxyketones n+m is an integer in the range of 3 to 8. Monosaccharides are<br>
compounds such as aidoses and ketoses and a wide variety of derivatives thereof.<br>
Derivation includes those obtained by oxidation, deoxygenation, replacement of one<br>
or more hydroxyl groups by preferably a hydrogen atom, an amino group or thiol<br>
group, as well as alkylation, acylation, sulfation or phosphorylation of hydroxy<br>
groups or amino groups. According to IUPAC nomenclature, carbohydrates are<br>
compounds of the stoichiometric formula Cn(H2O)n, such as aidoses and ketoses as<br>
well as substances derived from monosaccharides by reduction of the carbonyl<br>
group (aiditols), by oxidation of one or more terminal groups to carboxylic acids, or<br>
by replacement of one or more hydroxyl group(s) by a hydrogen atom, an amino<br>
group, thiol group or similar groups or derivatives of these compounds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the reducing sugar is a naturally occurring reducing<br>
sugar or a reducing sugar, which has been liberated from a naturally occurring or<br>
recombinantly produced compound comprising a carbohydrate, preferably without<br>
having been subject to furthermore modifications after liberation. In particular it is<br>
preferred that the reducing sugar, is a naturally occurring reducing sugar or a reduc-<br>
ing sugar liberated from a naturally occurring or recombinantly produced compound,<br>
wherein none of the alcohol groups of said naturally occurring sugar or said liber-<br>
ated sugar have been enzymatically transformed to an aidehyde or ketone by oxida-<br>
tion at the level of the oligosaccharide. It is also preferred that the reducing sugar, is<br>
a naturally occurring reducing sugar or a reducing sugar liberated from a naturally<br>
occurring or recombinantly produced compound, wherein said naturally occurring<br>
sugar or said liberated sugar have not been subjected to periodate treatment. It is<br>
thus generally preferred that no alcohol group of said naturally occurring sugar or<br>
said liberated sugar have been transformed to an aidehyde or ketone. In this context<br><br>
recombinantly produced compounds are compounds produced by a living organism<br>
with the aid of recombinant technologles, for example heterologous glycoproteins.<br>
Reducing sugars may be derived from a variety of sources. For example the reduc-<br>
ing sugar may be obtained from a living organism or part of a living organism, such<br>
as animals or plants or from one or more specific animal or plant tissues, from or-<br>
ganisms such as prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, from viruses, from in vitro culti-<br>
vated mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, fungl, bacterial cells, yeast, or<br>
phages. For example the reducing sugar may be isolated from extracts of any of the<br>
aforementioned cells, microbial organisms or living organisms. Such extracts may<br>
comprise reducing sugars, such as free carbohydrates. Extracts may also comprise<br>
compounds comprising monosaccharide, oligosaccharide, polysaccharide or carbo-<br>
hydrate moieties, notably glycoproteins or glycolipids or small organic molecules to<br>
which carbohydrates are attached, which are generally referred to as glycosides.<br>
Glycoproteins are compounds in which a carbohydrate component is linked to a<br>
peptide, polypeptide or protein component. Thus as used herein the term glycopro-<br>
tein also cover proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. Glycolipids are compounds<br>
containing one or more monosaccharide, oligosaccharide, polysaccharide or carbo-<br>
hydrate moieties bound by a glycosidic linkage to a hydrophobic moiety such as an<br>
acylglycerol, a sphingoid, a ceramide (W-acylsphingoid) or a prenyl phosphate. Gly-<br>
cosides are meant to describe small (MWt 100 - 5000) organic molecule glycosidi-<br>
cally linked to one or more sugars via elther O, N or S.<br>
Reducing sugars may also be the products of chemical synthesis, or chemi-<br>
cal/enzymatic synthesis, such as oligosaccharides prepared in vitro by chemical<br>
synthesis in solution or on the solid phase. These same synthetic oligosaccharides<br>
may be further modified by enzymatic reaction, such as for example by the sulfation,<br>
phosphorylation or glycosylation. Thus the methods described herein may also be<br>
used for manipulation of synthetic or semi-synthetic oligosaccharides or oligosac-<br>
charide libraries.<br><br>
Preferably, the monosaccharide, oligosaccharide, polysaccharide or carbohydrate<br>
moiety is liberated from the glycoprotein, prior to performing the methods of the in-<br>
vention. This may be done by standard methods known to the skilled person, N-<br>
linked monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides or carbohydrates may<br>
be cleaved from glycoproteins by chemical or enzymatic methods. Enzymatic<br>
methods may for example involve use of glycosidases such as endoglycosidases H<br>
and F or N-glycanases such as PNGase-F.O-linked monosaccharides, oligosac-<br>
charides, polysaccharides or carbohydrates may be cleaved from glycoproteins by<br>
chemical methods, including hydrazinolysis or alkaline β-elimination or enzymatically<br>
using enzymes such as an O-glycosidase. Chemical methods useful for release of<br>
both N-linked and O-linked includes reactions with strong nucleophiles and/or strong<br>
bases such as hydrazine. Carbohydrates may be cleaved from small organic mole-<br>
cules using elther acidic or basic reactions, or by the action of glycosidases.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention a predetermined amount of a reference stan-<br>
dard is added to the sample comprising the reducing sugar. This may facilitate<br>
quantification of said reducing sugar after immobilisation or after immobilisation and<br>
release in embodiments of the invention wherein the linker is cleavable.<br>
The reference standard may be any compound capable of reacting with -NH2, for<br>
example any compound comprising one of the nitrogen reactive functional groups<br>
described herein below in the section "E-&gt;F. Adding TAGs". Preferably the refer-<br>
ence standard is an aidehyde or a ketone, more preferably a sugar. In another em-<br>
bodiment of the invention, the same or different reference standard is added to the<br>
solid support prior to contact with the solution containing the reducing sugar with or<br>
without the added reference standard included in the solution (see herein below in<br>
section "B. Solid support"). Thus two or more reference standards may be used, one<br>
(or more) added to the solid support prior to contact of the solid support with the<br>
solution comprising a reducing sugar, and one or more added to the solution con-<br>
taining the reducing sugar.<br>
One or more reference standards may also be added to to the solid support after<br>
contact with the reducing sugar, but preferably prior to capping. Thus for example<br>
the reference standard may be added to compound C or Cred of fig. 1, preferably<br>
after a washing step.<br><br>
In embodiments of the invention wherein the solid support is coupled to a reference<br>
standard (see herein below in section "B. Solid support") it is preferred that different<br>
reference standards are used.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the methods comprises a step of pre-treatment<br>
of the sample to be used with the method. In particular, a sample comprising glyco-<br>
sidically-linked sugars such as a glycoproteins, glycolipids or glycosides may be<br>
pretreated with a scavenger resin prior to reaction with the solid support. The scav-<br>
enger resin is preferably a resin comprising a nucleophilic group capable of reacting<br>
with aidehydes and ketones, including reducing sugars, preferably the scavenger<br>
resin comprises an amino group or a hydrazine. Incubation of the sample with the<br>
scavenger resin will thus remove additional aidehydes, ketones and reducing sug-<br>
ars. After pre-treatment, such methods will in general further comprise the step of<br>
liberating reducing sugars from said glycosidically-linked sugars thereby obtaining a<br>
sample comprising reducing sugars. The vast majority of aidehydes and ketone<br>
within said sample will thus be reducing sugars released from glycosidically-linked<br>
sugars. Said reducing sugars may be liberated by a number of methods, including<br>
chemical or enzymatic methods, such as any of the methods described herein<br>
above in this section. Treatment of the pretreated sample with for example<br>
PNGaseF can cause the release of reducing oligosaccharides into solution for cap-<br>
ture and manipulation according to the methods of the invention. The oligosaccha-<br>
rides thus released will be essentially free of contaminating carbonyl compounds.<br>
Release of reducing carbohydrates may also be effected by other enzymes, such as<br>
glycosidases, or using chemical reactions, after scavenglng of contaminating car-<br>
bonyl compounds as described above.<br>
B. Solid support<br>
The methods according to the present invention involve immobilisation of a reducing<br>
sugar to a solid support. Solid phase chemistry offers a number of advantages, such<br>
as easy handling, purification and concentration of immobiiised compounds. How-<br>
ever, not all reactions doable in solution can be performed on solid phases. The<br>
attachment to a solid support practically confer infinite size to each molecular entity.<br><br>
This has the effect that the molecule reacts much more slowly in a bimolecular reac-<br>
tion than the same molecule would do in solution. Some reactions that may be car-<br>
ried out in solution with an acceptable yleld simply will not perform on solid support.<br>
The term "solid support" as used herein covers physical solids as well as insoluble<br>
polymers, insoluble particles, surfaces, membranes and resins, preferably the solid<br>
support is an insoluble polymer, an insoluble particle, a surface or a resin.<br>
Thus the "solid support" may be an insoluble inorganic matrix (such as glass), an<br>
insoluble polymer (such as a plastic, for example polystyrene), an insoluble matrix<br>
consisting of parts of both organic and inorganic components (e.g. some hybrid<br>
silicates, such as compounds of the structure R-Si-O-), organic polymers in common<br>
use in solid-phase synthesis (polystyrenes, PEGA resins, PEG resins, SPOCC res-<br>
ins and hybrids thereof), polyethylene glycol chains (which can be soluble in certain<br>
organic solvents and made insoluble by the addition of other solvents). The solid<br>
may also be a metal (such as gold), an alloy, or a composite such as for example<br>
indium-tin oxide or mica.<br>
Any of the above listed solid supports may additionally be coated with agents that<br>
have an affinity for carbohydrates, such as but not limited to aryl boronates or poly-<br>
mers thereof. Such coatings can increase the concentration of carbohydrate at the<br>
surface of the solid support, enhancing the rate and yleld of capture.<br>
Organic polymers used in solid-phase synthesis for example includes<br>
TentaGel (commercially available from Rapp polymere, Tubingen, Germany), Ar-<br>
goGel (commercially available from Argonaut Technologles Inc., San Carlos, CA),<br>
PEGA (commercially available from Polymer Laboratories, Amherst, MA), POEPOP<br>
(Renil et al., 1996, Tetrahedron Lett., 37; 6185-88; available from Versamatrix, Co-<br>
penhagen, Denmark) and SPOCC (Rademann et al, 1999, J. Am, Chem. Soc., 121:<br>
5459-66; available from Versamatrix, Copenhagen, Denmark).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the solid support is a sensor, such as a surface<br>
acoustic wave sensor (such as any of the sensors described in Samoyolov et al.<br>
2002, J. Molec. Recognit. 15:197-203) or a surface plasmon resonance sensor<br>
(such as any of the sensors reviewed by Homola et at., 1999, Sensors and Actua-<br><br>
tors B, 54: 3-15). Such solid supports may be inorganic materials such as glass,<br>
metals such as gold, organic polymeric materials or hybrids thereof and may be<br>
covered various coatings such as proteins or polysaccharides, oligomers such as as<br>
dendrimers or polymers such as polyacrylamide or polyethylene glycol.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the solid support is glass or PEGA resins.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention the solid support is coupled to a refer-<br>
ence standard, which may facilitate quantification of immobilised reducing sugar. In<br>
particular, it is preferred that said reference standard is attached to the solid support<br>
(elther directly or indirectly) by a cleavable linker, which could facilitate quantification<br>
of immobilised and released reducing sugar. In embodiments of the invention<br>
wherein the reducing sugar is immobilised to the solid support via a cleavable linker,<br>
it is preferred that the reference standard is immobilised to the solid support via an<br>
identical or similar cleavable linker.<br>
The reference standard may be any detectable compound, for example the refer-<br>
ence standard may or may not be a sugar, preferably however it is carbohydrate.<br>
The amount of reference standard may vary, in general the solid support may com-<br>
prise in the range of 20 to 500, preferably in the range of 50 to 200, such as in the<br>
range of 90 to 110 -NH2 groups per reference standard.<br>
B. Spacer<br>
According to the present invention the solid support is optionally coupled to a linker<br>
via a spacer. However, it is also comprised within the present invention that the solid<br>
support is directly coupled to the linker.<br>
A spacer is a chemical entity in the range of 1 to 1000 atoms long. Preferably, said<br>
spacer is a linear or branched chain and/or a ring structure. The nature of the spacer<br>
may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic or have a mixture of these two properties. The<br>
group of spacers comprises molecules in common use in solid phase synthesis and<br>
on-bead, in-well or on-slide assays involving the detection of molecules attached via<br>
spacers to solid-supports. The skilled person will readily be able to identify a useful<br>
spacer for a glven solid support.<br><br>
The spacer is preferably an alkyl chain (more preferably a C1 to C1000 alkyl chain),<br>
which optionally may be branched, wherein said alkyl chain optionally is substituted<br>
at one or more positions by groups containing one or more of B, O, N, S, P, Si, F,<br>
CI, Br or I. The spacer may also comprise one or more aryl residues which optionally<br>
may be branched or substituted in the same manner. In one preferred embodiment,<br>
the spacer is selected from the group consisting of amides and ethers. Thus the<br>
spacer may essentially consist of a chain containing one or more amide bonds (-<br>
CONH-), one more ethylene glycol units (-CH2-CH2-O-), or combinations of these<br>
units with the alkyl or aryl chains.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the spacer preferably does not comprise elther<br>
a primary or a secondary amine. In another embodiment of the invention any amines<br>
comprised within the spacer are capped.<br>
B. Linker<br>
The present invention relates to capture of reducing sugars onto solid supports co-<br>
valently attached to a linker comprising a capture group. The linker serves to link the<br>
capture group, terminating in -NH2, to the solid support optionally through a spacer.<br>
The linker may be any of a large variety of linkers such as those in common use in<br>
solid-phase organic synthesis.<br>
The linker may elther be a non-cleavable linker or a cleavable linker.<br>
Non-cleavable linkers may for example be alkyl, aryl, ethers or amides, wherein any<br>
of the aforementioned may optionally be substituted. For example any of the afore-<br>
mentioned may be substituted with heteroatoms or they may contain, 0-alkyl,alkyl,<br>
aryl or heteroatoms as branches. In one example the linker comprises or essentially<br>
consists of PEG and/or polyamide.<br>
The linker may comprise a site where a reaction can be made to occur to sever the<br>
part containing the capture group (including the molecules it has captured and which<br>
have been optionally further modified) from the spacer and the solid support. Such<br>
linkers are referred to as cleavable linkers, and are in wide use in solid phase or-<br><br>
ganic synthesis. Examples of cieavable linkers are known where the cleavage can<br>
be effected by electrophiles, nucleophiles, oxidizing agents, reducing agents, free<br>
radicals, acid, base, light, heat or enzymes.<br>
Cieavable linkers may for example be acid labile (for example, the Rink amide as<br>
described in Rink, 1987, Tetrahedron) Lett., 28: 387 and traceless silyl linkers as<br>
described in Plunkett et at., 1995, J. Org. Chew., 60: 6006-7), base labile (for exam-<br>
ple, HMBA as described in Atherton et al. 1981, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans, 1:<br>
538), or photolabile (for example, 2-nitrobenzyl type as described in Homles et al.,<br>
1995, J. Org. Chem., 60: 2318-2319). The linkers may be more specific and restric-<br>
tive of the type of chemistry performed, such as silyl linkers (for example, those<br>
cleaved with fluoride as described in Boehm et al., 1996, J. Org. Chem., 62: 6498-<br>
99), allyl linkers (for example, Kunz et al., 1988, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 27:<br>
711-713), and the safety catch sulfonamide linker (for example, as described in<br>
Kenner et al., 1971, Chem. Commun., 12: 636-7). Enzyme cieavable linkers may for<br>
example be any of the enzyme cieavable linkers described in Reents et al., 2002,<br>
Drug Discov. Today, 7: 71-76, or any functionalised derivatives of the enzyme-labile<br>
protecting groups described in the review by Waidmann et al., 2001, Chem. Rev.<br>
101: 3367-3396. Heat labile linkers may for example be of the type described in<br>
Meng et al., 2004, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 43: 1255-1260.<br>
B. Capture group<br>
According to the present invention the linker comprises a capture group, wherein the<br>
capture group comprises at least one -NH2 group. In a favourable format, the cap-<br>
ture group terminates in an -NH2 group that is attached to the linker through an op-<br>
tional group R. Thus the capture group preferably is of the structure R-NH2. R may<br>
be a simple alkyl, aryl or substituted alkyl or aryl group. Preferably, R should contain<br>
a heteroatom directly attached to the -NH2 group, to produce structures of the type<br>
linker-M-NH2, wherein M is a heteroatom (i.e. not carbon), preferably M is selected<br>
from the group consisting of N, O and S. Especially favourable are compounds<br>
where M is a heteroatom, such as in the structures linker-O-NH2 linker-NH-NH2,<br>
linker-CO-NH-NH2, linker-NH-CO-NH-NH2, linker-S(O)2NH-NH2 and Iinker-S-NH2.<br><br>
A+B—&gt;C, Methods of capture<br>
The capture of the reducing sugar is done by reacting the -NH2 group of the capture<br>
group with the reducing end of said reducing sugar, i.e. with the aidehyde or he-<br>
miacetal group. The reaction can occur at any pH values but is most favored in the<br>
range of pH 2 - 9. The methods may involve the addition of one or more additives,<br>
such as additives which may elther facilitate or favourably alter the equllibrium be-<br>
tween the open chain aidehyde form of the reducing sugar and the hemiacetal form<br>
of the reducing sugar (e.g. compound A, fig. 1), wherein the open chain aidehyde<br>
form is preferred. The additive may for example be metal ions, boronates or sili-<br>
cates. The capture produces a species attached to the solid support through a cova-<br>
lent double bond (shown as C=N) where the C is derived from the sugar moiety and<br>
N from the capture group. This immobilized sugar may also be in equllibrium with its<br>
cyclic ring form, in particular if the reducing sugar was a pyranose, then the immobi-<br>
lised sugar may be in equllibrium with its cyclic 6-membered ring form (see for ex-<br>
ample compounds C and C of fig. 1), but it may also be in equllibrium with its 5-<br>
membered ring form if the appropriate OH group on the sugar is unsubstituted.<br>
The capture reaction may be performed in any useful solvent. A person of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will readily be able to identify a useful solvent for any glven com-<br>
pounds A and B. The solvent may for example be selected from the group consist-<br>
ing of water, aqueous buffer, organic solvents and mixed aqueous and organic sol-<br>
vents. The solvent may also be any of the aforementioned comprising one or more<br>
additives such as acids, bases, salts, divalent metal cations, detergents, complex-<br>
ing agents including inclusion-complex-forming molecules such as cyclodextrins or<br>
calixarenes, chelating agents (for example EDTA), borates, boronates or silicates.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the amount of solid support (compound B of fig. 1) added<br>
to the reaction is adjusted so that a molar excess of capture groups are present in<br>
relation to the reducing sugar, preferably said excess is large, such as at least 2<br>
times, preferably at least 5 times, more preferably at least 10 times, such as at least<br>
50 times, for example at least 100 times or more. This excess will ensure a more<br>
efficient capture of the reducing sugar.<br><br>
The capture reaction may be carried out at any temperature, but preferably at tem-<br>
peratures in the range of 0 to 100°C.<br>
C. Washing<br>
Once the reducing sugar has been immobilised on the solid support through reac-<br>
tion with the capture group (step A+B-&gt;C of fig. 1) the solid supports may be<br>
washed to remove non-covalently bound material. Accordingly, if the reducing sugar<br>
is provided in a solution comprising other compounds, in particular other compounds<br>
that do not comprise -NH2 reactive groups, the reducing sugar may be purified from<br>
said solution. It is thus comprised within the present invention that the reducing<br>
sugar is provided in a non-purified form, such as in the form of a crude cellular ex-<br>
tract or the like. It is also comprised that the reducing sugar may be produced from a<br>
purified or partially purified glycoprotein, glycolipid or glycoside by the action of an<br>
enzymes such as glycosidase or an amidase or through the cleavage of a glycosidic<br>
bond by chemical reagents.<br>
The skilled person will readily be able to identify sultable washing conditions for a<br>
glven immoblised sugar (compound C, fig. 1). The washing may for example be<br>
done with any of the above-mentioned solvents optionally comprising any of the<br>
above-mentioned additives in addition to detergents and denaturing agents. The<br>
washing my be performed at any temperature, but preferably at temperatures in the<br>
range of 0-100°C.<br>
C-&gt;D. Capping<br>
The solid support coupled to the immobilised sugar (such as compound C of fig. 1)<br>
still contains unreacted free -NH2 groups and can be subjected to unique manipula-<br>
tions that increase the scope of its utility.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, subsequent to immobilisation of the<br>
reducing sugar, unreacted -NH2 groups are capped by a capping agent, such as an<br>
acylating agents (e.g. acetic anhydride) or other nitrogen-reactive agents well known<br><br>
in the art, under conditions where the C=N bond of C does not react. After capping<br>
the solid support will no longer comprise any free amine groups, but only capped<br>
nitrogen atoms (N(H)CAP) of very low reactivity towards electrophiles. The product<br>
of the capping of compound C has for example the general structure D (see fig. 1)<br>
containing an -R-N(H)CAP group, wherein the (H) may or may not be present de-<br>
pending on the structure of the CAP group.<br>
Thus if the C=N bond linking the sugar to the solid support is reduced to an -NH-, it<br>
will be a formally SP3-hybridized nitrogen atom in the sequence R-NH-CH2-. Specific<br>
reactions may thus be directed to this group allowing specific and stoichimetric reac-<br>
tions at the reducing sugar.<br>
Preferably the capping agent specifically reacts with the remaining -NH2 groups,<br>
without substantially reacting with the C=N functionality. Such reagents are well<br>
known in the art an include common acylating agents used for amid bond formation,<br>
e.g. acetic anhydride, other alkanoic acid anhydrides, aromatic anhydrides (e.g.<br>
benzoic anhydride), cyclic anhydrides (e.g. succinic anhydride, phthalic anhydride),<br>
other active esters such as N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, pentafluorophenyl esters<br>
and a variety of active esters in common use in amide bond formation including in<br>
the solid phase synthesis of peptide bonds. The -NH2 groups may alternatively be<br>
capped by adding the corresponding free acids and an in-situ activating agent such<br>
as DCC, in common use in peptide-bond formation thereby creating an active ester<br>
in situ. Other reagents known to be reactive towards -NH2 groups can be used, such<br>
as alkyl isothiocyanates (R-NCS), aryl isothiocyantes (Ar-NCS), alkylating agents R-<br>
L (where L is a leaving group typically from the series CI, Br, I, OS(O)2R' where R'<br>
can be alkyl or aryl), Michael acceptors such as alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl<br>
compounds (CHR=CH-CO- where R can be H, alkyl or aryl or substituted alkyl or<br>
aryl) or alpha-beta unsaturated sulfones (CHR=CHS(O)2R' or Ar where R can be H,<br>
alkyl or aryl or substituted alkyl or aryl), sulfonating agents (such as RSO2CI) and<br>
derivatives thereof. In a similar manner, the -NH2 groups can be capped by reaction<br>
with active esters of carbonates of the general formual RO-C(O) L, where L is des-<br>
ribed as above.<br><br>
D-&gt;E. Reduction<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the C=N bond linking the sugar to the<br>
linker (for example compound D of fig. 1) is reduced using a reducing agent. The<br>
C=N bond may be reduced by a variety of well known reducing agents, preferably<br>
the reducing agent is capable of saturating the double bond while placing a hydro-<br>
gen atom on the N.<br>
Of special value are boranes or borohydrides comprising a BH bond, examples in-<br>
clude NaBH4, NaCNBH3, and BH3 complexes such as BH3-pyridine, BH3-<br>
dimethylsulfide or the like. Silanes with the structures R3SiH can also be used, such<br>
as silanes comprising SiH bonds, as can hydrogen transfer agents such as diimides,<br>
or homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts or hydrogenation catalysts comprising a<br>
metal-H bond.<br>
The reduction results in a reactive sugar containing the structure SugarCH-NH-<br>
preferably linked to a solid support via a linker and optionally a spacer. In general, if<br>
the reducing sugar was an aidehyde, then reduction will result in a compound of the<br>
structure SugarCH2-NH-. If the reducing sugar was a ketone, then the reduction will<br>
result in a compound of the structure SugarCH-NH-.<br>
The products of the reduction are for example of the general structure E (fig. 1) con-<br>
taining a formally SP3 hybridized N atom.<br>
C-»Cred—&gt;E<br>
In another preferred implementation of the method, the order of the capping and<br>
reduction steps is reversed. Reduction of the C=N bond in compound C (fig. 1) can<br>
be effected by any of the reagents described in D=E above to produce a compound<br>
of the structure Cred (fig. 1). The reduction may also be performed in situ, meaning<br>
that a reducing agent (such as NaCNBH3) may be added to the solid support (e.g.<br>
compound B) simultaneously with the reducing sugar so that the C=N bond is re-<br>
duced as it forms producing also Cred. It is thus comprised within the present inven-<br>
tion that the sample comprising the reducing sugar may be incubated with the solid<br><br>
support and the reducing agent simultaneously. Thus, reduction of C=N bonds (step<br>
v) will be performed immediately following reaction of the reducing sugar with the NH2 group of the solid support (step iii). The free -NH2 groups in Cred may then be<br>
capped using any of the reagents described in C-&gt;D above under conditions that do<br>
not cause reaction with the SugarCH-NH-moiety. In particular, in this embodiment of<br>
the invention it is preferred that the capping agent preferentially reacts with primary<br>
amino groups over secondary amino group. It is also preferred that reaction tem-<br>
perature and time are adjusted to yleld preferential reaction with primary over sec-<br>
ondary amino groups. Virtually all compounds that react with amino groups react<br>
more qulckly with primary amino groups than with more substituted amino groups,<br>
but this is especially the case when such compounds are sterically large, such as for<br>
example active benzoyl esters, isopropanoic acid active-esters, pivaloyl active-<br>
esters, Boc anhydride or Boc-azide and the like. Useful compounds and conditions<br>
for preferential reaction with primary amino groups over secondary amino groups<br>
are described in Greene et al. 1999, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd.<br>
Ed., Chaper 7, pp. 503-653. Other very preferred capping agents are NHS-esters or<br>
sterically hindered pentafluorophenyl (PFP) esters or tetrafluorophenyl (TFP) es-<br>
ters.<br>
E-&gt;F. Adding TAGs<br>
Compound E, fig. 1, obtained by elther of the above routes, contains solids linked to<br>
a capped nitrogen atom (N(H)CAP) of very low reactivity towards electrophiles and a<br>
formally SP3-hybridized nitrogen atom in the sequence SugarCH2-NH-R. Reaction of<br>
E with sultable nitrogen-reactive functional groups (preferably the nitrogen-reactive<br>
functional group is a mild electrophile) therefore results in the exclusive, or near ex-<br>
clusive, addition of the electrophile to the SP3 nitrogen atom effectively adding a<br>
molecular structure, herein described as "TAG", or another derivatising agent onto<br>
the nitrogen to which the sugar is attached. The product of the addition of a TAG is<br>
shown as Fin fig. 1.<br>
Throughout the description the term "nitrogen-reactive group" is used to describe<br>
reactivity towards a formally SP3-hybridized nitrogen, such as in compounds of the<br>
structure R-NH-R', for example amines, wherein R and R' independently are alkyl,<br><br>
or aryl (optionally substituted) or compounds wherein R' has an heteroatom such as<br>
O or N attached to the -NH- such as in hydroxylamine derivatives (R-NH-OR') or<br>
hydrazine derivatives (R-NH-NH-R').<br>
The identity of the derivatising agent (for example a TAG), i.e. the specific chemical<br>
structure of the derivatising agent, may be selected by the user. For addition to the<br>
SP3 nitrogen in E, the derivatising agent (for example the TAG) should itself com-<br>
prise an nitrogen-reactive functional group designated "X" in fig. 1„ Preferably the<br>
TAG should contain an electrophile, or be attached to an nitrogen-reactive functional<br>
group X. Preferably the derivatising agent is of the general structure TAG-X (see fig.<br>
1), wherein X is a nitrogen-reactive functional group. Preferably X is any mild elec-<br>
trophile that is reactive with SP3 nitrogen atoms, but preferably mild electrophiles<br>
that react poorly with the -OH groups present on the sugar. Such mild electrophiles<br>
include isothiocyanates (TAG-NCS), active esters (TAG-C(O)-L) where L is a leav-<br>
ing group commonly used in amide bond formation such as in the synthesis of pep-<br>
tide bonds, carboxylic acids (TAG-COOH) which can be activated to active esters in<br>
situ by methods commonly used in amide bond formation such as in the synthesis of<br>
peptide bonds, alkylating agents (TAG-L) where L is a leaving group preferably but<br>
not exclusively from the series CI, Br, I, OS(O)2R where R can be alkyl or aryl, TAGs<br>
comprising Michael acceptors (typically containing the sequence -CR=CH-C(O)-) or<br>
alpha-beta unsaturated sulfones (-CR=CH-S(O)2-) and derivatives of any of the<br>
aformentionned, aidehydes or ketone that may react with the sugarCH2-NH-amino<br>
group by reductive amination, or substituted haloaromatic groups where the aro-<br>
matic ring bears electronegative groups such as nitro groups, for example as in the<br>
Sanger reagent 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene or the 4-halo-7-nitro-2-oxa-1,3-diazole<br>
(NBD) reagents where the halogenis preferably F or CI.<br>
The TAG may for example be a fluorescent moiety, a mass spectrometry TAG, a<br>
first binding partner capable of binding to a second binding partner, a nuclelc acid<br>
wherein any of the aforementioned TAGs preferably comprises or are attached to an<br>
nitrogen-reactive functional group. In particular the TAG may be any of the TAGs<br>
described in more detall herein below, wherein any of these TAGs may be attached<br>
to any of the aforementioned nitrogen-reactive functional groups.<br><br>
An example of a compound which may be obiained by adding a TAG to compound<br>
E is shown as F in fig. 1.<br>
F. Washing<br>
In one embodiment the tagged sugar (e.g. compound F, fig. 1) is washed prior to<br>
any futher manipulations. Thus any amount of unbound TAG is removed. Washing<br>
may easily be accomplished because the tagged sugar is immobilised on a solid<br>
support.<br>
After washing, only covalent bound TAG will be present. Thus the amount of TAG<br>
will be correlatable to the amount of immobilised sugar. Accordingly, by determining<br>
the presence of TAG, the amount of immobilised sugar may be determined. If esset-<br>
tially all reducing sugar in a glven sample was immobilised, the methods therefore in<br>
one aspect allow determining the amount of reducing sugar present in a sample.<br>
The skilled person will readily be able to identify sultable washing conditions for a<br>
glven tagged, immoblised sugar (e.g. compound F, fig. 1). The washing may for ex-<br>
ample be done with a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, aqueous<br>
buffer, organic solvents and mixed aqueous and organic solvents. The solvent may<br>
also be any of the aforementioned comprising one or more additives such as salts,<br>
divalent metal cations, detergents, complexing agents including inclusion-<br>
conmplex-forming molecules such as cyclodextrins or calixarenes, chelating agents<br>
(for example EDTA), borates, boronates or silicates. Furthermore, the solvent may<br>
optionally comprise detergents and denaturing agents. The washing my be per-<br>
formed at any temperature, but preferably at temperatures in the range of 0 -<br>
100°C.<br>
H. Cleavage of cleavable linker<br>
When the linker used is a cleavable linker, then methods of the invention may com-<br>
prise a step of cleaving said cleavable linker thereby releasing captured sugar. Pref-<br>
erably the cleavage is performed subsequent to addition of a derivatising agent,<br>
such as a TAG (added using TAG-X) or a tether-Y (added using X-tether-Y) to the -<br>
NH- group of the immobilised sugar. Thus a tagged sugar (compound G or com-<br><br>
pound J in fig. 1) may be released into solution from F or from I, respectively. G<br>
consists of a sugar portion that bears a TAG on the Nitrogen atom which is attached<br>
to the residue (if any) of the linker that remains after cleavage, and for simpliclty is<br>
denoted as sugar-TAG. J consists of a sugar portion that bears a tether on the ni-<br>
trogen atom, which is attached to the residue (if any) that remains after cleavage.<br>
The tether may optionally be linked to a TAG.<br>
However, the cleavable linker may be cleaved at any desirable time within the<br>
method.<br>
If the TAG added to compound E has beneficlal spectroscopic properties such as<br>
fluorescent properties, the amount of sugar-TAG (compound G, fig. 1) can be quan-<br>
titiated in solution. Furthermore, the sugar-TAG (compound G, fig. 1) can be sub-<br>
jected to analytical separation techniques such as HPLC or CE, and if more than<br>
one sugar is present, the individual components can be separated, thelr relative<br>
ratios determined, and they can be identified if authentic standards are available,<br>
and they can be quantitated. They can also be used as ligands that may bind to car-<br>
bohydrate-recognizing proteins, thus providing information on the structure of elther<br>
the carbohydrate or the protein.<br>
If the TAG is a structure glving the sugar-TAG properties that are beneficlal to the<br>
practice of mass-spectrometry, elther due to increased sensitivity, simplification of<br>
spectral interpretation, or permitting the performance of differential analysis using<br>
isotope encoding, then the sugar-TAG released into solution can be favourably ana-<br>
lyzed by mass-spectrometry.<br>
F. TAGs with spectroscopic properties<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the TAG added to e.g. compound E or<br>
compound H has beneficlal spectroscopic properties. Preferably, the TAG with the<br>
beneficlal spectroscopic properties is added to e.g. compound E using a derivative<br>
of the structure X-TAG, wherein X is a nitrogen reactive functional group, such as<br>
any of the nitrogen reactive functional groups described herein above in the section<br>
"E-&gt;F Adding TAGs". By beneficial spectroscopic properties is meant that the TAG<br><br>
can easily be visualised, for example by spectrometry. Thus the TAG may for exam-<br>
ple be spectroscopically detectable. In a preferred embodiment the TAG is a fluo-<br>
rescent TAG. Examples of such tagglng include the reaction with isothiocyanates<br>
(e.g. FITC, TRITC), active esters, Michael acceptors, alpha-beta-unsaturated sul-<br>
fonyls (speclfically vinyl sulfones) and alkylating agents such as alkyl halides and<br>
tosylates, an halo-aryl compounds such as for example the Sanger reagent<br>
The product of addition of such a TAG (for example compound F of fig. 1) can ab-<br>
sorb and re-emit light that can be detected. The number of such TAGs present on F<br>
will reflect the number of sugar molecules A added to B and captured to produce C.<br>
The number of reducing sugar molecules (A) origlnally present in a sample can<br>
therefore be estimated by the fluorescence of compound F, provided that the pro-<br>
vided solid supports (compound B) comprise an excess of capture groups. TAGs<br>
other than fluorescent molecules can also be used. These can include radioactive<br>
TAGs, phosphorescent TAGs, chemiluminescent TAGs, UV-absorbing TAGs,<br>
nanoparticles, quantum dots, coloured compounds,, electrochemically-active TAGs,<br>
infrared-active TAGs, TAGs active in Raman spectroscopy or Raman scattering,<br>
TAGs detectable by atomic force microscopy or TAGs comprising metal atoms or<br>
clusters thereof.<br>
If the solid support of compound F is a sensor, such as a surface acoustic wave<br>
sensor or a surface plasmon resonance sensor, then addition of such a specles that<br>
binds speclfically to the TAG can result in the production of a signal that is propor-<br>
tional to the TAG and therefore to the number of sugar molecules. An example is<br>
when the TAG is a biotin residue, commonly introduced by reaction with an active<br>
ester of biotin. Addition of an avidin-protein to compound E, when the TAG is a bio-<br>
tin residue, can result in signal that is readily detected and reported by the sensor.<br>
Other examples of sensors that can be used to detect the binding of second binding<br>
partners to immobilized TAGs include but are not limited to piezoelectric sensors,<br>
amperometric sensors, surface plasmon fluorescence spectroscopy sensors, dual<br>
polarization interferometry (DPI) sensors, wavelength-interrogated optical sensors<br>
(WIOSs), impedence sensors, optical wavegulde grating coupler sensors, acoustic<br>
sensors and calorimetric sensors.<br>
Once the sugar has been attached to a TAG with spectroscopic properties, then<br>
said spectroscopic properties may be determined. The optical properties may be<br><br>
determined for sugars still immobilised on the solid support (such as for compound F<br>
or I of fig. 1) or for sugars released to solution (for example for compound G or J of<br>
fig. 1). The latter requlres that the linker is a cleavable linker. Depending on the na-<br>
ture of the TAG with spectroscopic properties, said properties may be determined<br>
using conventional methods, such as spectrometry. Thus the methods of the inven-<br>
tion may comprise the step of detecting the TAG attached to the sugar by spec-<br>
trometry.<br>
F. Mass-spectrometry TAGs<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the TAG is a mass spectrometry TAG. Said<br>
mass spectrometry TAG is preferably added by a reagent of structure X-TAG,<br>
wherein X is a nitrogen-reactive functional group, such as any of the nitrogen-<br>
reactive functional group mentioned herein above in the section "Adding TAGs". The<br>
term "mass spectrometry TAGs" as used herein refers to molecules that improve the<br>
detection and structural characterization of the products by mass spectrometry, pref-<br>
erably after cleavage from the solid support (as described herein above in the sec-<br>
tion "Cleavage of cleavable linker"). Examples include the introduction of a bromine<br>
label which imparts a characteristic isotope pattern in the mass-spectrum. Such a<br>
bromine label may be added, for example, by addition of p-bromophenyl isothiocy-<br>
anate to compound E producing a compound of structure F where the TAG contains<br>
a bromine atom. The usefulness of bromine-containing labels in the mass-<br>
spectrometry of carbohydrates has been described for example in Li et al., 2003,<br>
Rapid. Commun. Mass Spectr., 17:1462-1466.. Another example includes introduc-<br>
tion of molecules that impart elther positive charges or negative charges for en-<br>
hanced detection in elther positive-ion mode or negative-ion mode of mass/charge<br>
separation. Another example includes the introduction of molecules that improve<br>
performance or sensitivity in electrospray, MaidI or other techniques of ionization<br>
common in the practice of mass spectrometry. Yet another example includes the<br>
introduction of stable isotope-labeled molecules that allow quantitation of the la-<br>
belled specles by mass-spectrometry. Useful methods for isotope labelling are for<br>
example reviewed in Tao et al., 2003, Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 14: 110-<br>
118.<br><br>
Once the sugar has been attached to a mass spectrometry TAG, then the tagged<br>
sugar (F or G or I or J, fig. 1) may be detected by mass spectrometry. Mass spec-<br>
trometry may be performed on sugars still immobilised on the solid support (such as<br>
for compounds F and I of fig. 1), but preferably is performed on sugars released to<br>
solution, for example by cleavage of a cleavable linker (for example for compounds<br>
G or J of fig. 1). It is thus preferred that the linker is a cleavable linker. The skilled<br>
person will be able to perform a sultable mass spectrometry depending on the na-<br>
ture of the mass spectrometry TAG . Thus the methods of the invention may com-<br>
prise the step of detecting the sugar attached to the mass spectrometry TAG by<br>
mass spectrometry,<br>
F. Binding partner TAGs<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the TAG is a first binding<br>
partner, capable of speclfic interaction with a second binding partner, wherein said<br>
first binding partner is added to for example compound E (or to compound H)<br>
through the reaction with a reagent of structure X-TAG, wherein X is a nitrogen-<br>
reactive functional group (e.g. a "derivatising agent"). The second binding partner is<br>
preferably labelled with a detectable label, such as a dye, a fluorescent label, a ra-<br>
dioactive isotope, a heavy metal or an enzyme. The first binding partner may for<br>
example be a molecule that is a ligand for a protein useful in the detection of the<br>
resulting immobilized ligand, elther stochiometrically or following amplification. The<br>
first binding partner may also be a protein and the second binding partner a ligand<br>
for said protein.<br>
Examples of binding partners include (igand-protein palrs in common use in ELISA<br>
assays. For example compound E may be reacted with a biotinylation reagent, and<br>
after washing, detecting the now immobilized biotin with streptavidin (or other avid-<br>
ins) that is directly labelled with a detectable label, such as with a fluorescent TAG,<br>
a radioactive isotope or a heavy metal, or with streptavidin (or other avidins) that is<br>
conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase that can catalyze a<br>
chemical reaction that results in the production of a signal that can be detected by<br>
spectrometry.<br><br>
Other examples of binding partners are antibody-epitope palrs. Thus the one binding<br>
partner could comprise an epitope and the other binding partner could be an anti-<br>
body capable of binding said epitope with high affinity, preferably an antibody spe-<br>
clfically binding said epitope.<br>
F. Nuclelc acld TAGs<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the TAG is a nuclelc acld. Nuclelc aclds ac-<br>
cording to the invention may be any nuclelc acld, such as DNA or RNA, or ana-<br>
logues thereof such as LNA, PNA, HNA or the like. Preferably the nuclelc acld is<br>
DNA, preferably a DNA oligomer. Preferably, said DNA is derivatised with an nitro-<br>
gen-reactive functional group, such as any of the nitrogen-reactive functional groups<br>
mentioned herein above in the section "Adding TAGs". It is preferred that the se-<br>
quence of said nuclelc acld TAG is known or at least partially known, which will en-<br>
able the skilled person to readily detect said TAG using standard methods.<br>
The nuclelc acld TAG may be any desirable length, preferably at least a length<br>
which will allow speclfic detection. Thus preferably the nuclelc acld is at least 6 nu-<br>
cleotides, more prefereably at least 10 nucleotides, for example in the range of 10 to<br>
5000 nucleotides long.<br>
After addition of a nitrogen-reactive nuclelc acld TAG to the sugar, then the nuclelc<br>
acld, such as the DNA oligomers can then be detected directly on the solid support<br>
by hydridisation to thelr complementary nuclelc aclds or essentially complementary<br>
nuclelc acld. By essentially complementary nuclelc aclds, is meant a nuclelc acld,<br>
which may hybridise to a glven nuclelc acld under stringent conditions as for exam-<br>
ple described in Sambrook et al., 1989, in "Molecular Cloning/A Laboratory Manual",<br>
Cold Spring Harbor. Preferably, said complementary nuclelc aclds may be attached<br>
to a detectable label. Said detectable label may for example be a flourescent label<br>
or a radioisotope or an enzyme, preferably a fluorescent label. Thus, the nuclelc<br>
acld TAG may for example be detected by hybridisation to thelr complementarty<br>
fluorescently-labeled DNA. Alternatively, a nuclelc acld TAG may be amplified using<br>
conventional methods known in the art, such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)<br>
or ligase chain reactin. Thus, the immobilised nuclelc acld TAG may be subjected to<br><br>
PCR reactions to amplify the immobilized DNA oligomer which can be measured in<br>
solution by a variety of well know techniques for quantification in PCR. This process<br>
has particular value in the indirect detection and quantification of very low amounts<br>
of SugarCH-NH-Linker-Spacer-Solid present on the solid support. Alternatively, the<br>
Sugar bound to DNA may be released to solution by cleavage of the linker and<br>
thereafter amplified in solution by for example PCR or detected in solution by virtue<br>
of speclfic hybridisation to essentially complementary nuclelc aclds.<br>
E-&gt;H Tethers<br>
The derivatising agent according to the present invention may also be a tether cou-<br>
pled to at least two functional groups. Such bifunctional reagents will in general be<br>
of the structure X-tether-Y or X-tether-Yp, wherein X is an nitrogen-reactive func-<br>
tional group and Y is a second reactive functional group and Yp is a latent reactive<br>
functional group or a protected reactive group Y. The product of the reaction of<br>
compound E with X-tether-Y (or X-tether-Yp) may for example have the general<br>
structure of compound H of fig. 1. The second reactive functional group Y may be<br>
reactive to any of the types of reagents in use in solid-phase synthesis. For exam-<br>
ple, the N in SugarCH-NH-Linker-Spacer-Solid can be reacted with bifunctional<br>
reagents (X-tether-Y) where one function reacts by making a bond to the immobi-<br>
lized nitrogen (the nitrogen reactive functional group X) and the other function can<br>
elther be, or can be converted to (by for example unmasking, deprotection or further<br>
reaction) a second reactive functional group Y.<br>
The tether may be any useful tether, for example alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl (which may<br>
be linear, branched or cyclic), aryl or any of the aforementioned comprising amide<br>
bonds (NC(O)R) or etyleneglycol groups (-CH2CH2-O-) or substituted with heteroa-<br>
toms and thelr derivatives.<br>
The second functional reactive group Y may for example be selected from the group<br>
consisting of thiols, carboxyl groups, activated carboxyl groups, disulfides, activated<br>
disulfides, alkylating agents, alkenes, alkynes, aidehydes, ketones and azides. The<br>
alkylating agent may for example be an alkyl halide or an alpha-halo carbonyl group.<br>
Yp may for example be protected amines or protected derivatives of any of the<br><br>
aforementioned groups Y. Thus Yp may for example be selected from the group con-<br>
sisting of protected amines, protected thiols, protected carboxyl groups, protected<br>
aidehydes and protected ketones. Protected reactive groups are herein denoted Yp,<br>
wherein Yp may be deprotected to yleld a functional reactive group Y. Useful pro-<br>
tecting groups can be found in Greene et al., 1999, "Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis", 3rd. Ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York, speclfically for carbonyl<br>
groups (chapter 4, pp. 293 - 368 ), for carboxyl groups (chapter 5, pp. 369 453-),<br>
for thiols (chapter 6, pp. 454 - 493) and for amino groups (chapter 7, pp. 494 - 653).<br>
Examples of protected amines include, but are not limited to, those in common use<br>
in solid-phase peptide synthesis, such as Fmoc, Boc, Alloc, p-<br>
ntirobenzyloxycarbonyl, trityl and substituted trityl, o-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, N-<br>
sulfenyl or azido. However, the second reactive functional group may be any func-<br>
tional groups Y, or protected functional groups (Yp) that have been made to react on<br>
the solid phase, such as examples well known in the art of solid phase synthesis<br>
and the coupling of small molecules to solid supports and surfaces. These function-<br>
alized groups can then directly, or after deprotection to reactive specles, capture a<br>
second derivatising agent comprising a functional group (Z) capable of reacting with<br>
the second functional group Y.<br>
If Y in compound H contains an NH2 group, or on deprotection can be made to con-<br>
tain an NH2 group, then any of the amine reactive reagents described in E-goes-to-F<br>
(for example, isothiocyanates) can be used to add a TAG to produce compounds of<br>
the general structure I (fig. 1).<br>
The second derivatising agent made to react with any of the functional groups Y in<br>
compound H (fig. 1) may for example be spectroscopic TAGs or any of the TAGs<br>
mentioned above in section E-&gt;F, wherein said TAGs in stead of a nitrogen reactive<br>
group, comprises or are derivatised with a functional group (Z) capable of reacting<br>
with Y. They may also be small molecules like drugs, imaglng agents, peptides, pro-<br>
teins, enzymes and other molecules exhibiting biologlcal activities, nuclelc aclds<br>
such as DNA or RNA<br>
Said small molecules, imaglng agents, peptides or nuclelc aclds preferably com-<br>
prises or are attached to a functional group Z, capable of reacting with the glven<br>
second functional reactive group Y. The skilled person will readibly be able to iden-<br><br>
tify useful functional groups Y and Z. The second derivatising agent may also be any<br>
of the above-mentioned TAGs described above in the sections "TAGs with Spectro-<br>
scopic properties", "Mass spectrometry TAGs", "Binding partner TAGs" and "Nuclelc<br>
acld TAGs", wherein said TAGs in place of a nitrogen reactive functional group con-<br>
tains a functional group Z capable of reacting with the functional group Y. The func-<br>
tional group attached to the tether in H (fig. 1) may also be a latent or protected<br>
group (Yp) that can be converted by chemical or enzymatic reaction into Y which<br>
may then react further as described above. If this latent group can be converted to a<br>
primary or secondary amine (i.e. Y will comprise the structure -NH2 or -NH-), then<br>
any of the amine-reactive specles described in E-*F above may be added to pro-<br>
duce tagged compounds of the structure I.<br>
The methods of the invention may therefore comprise the step of<br>
vii. Reacting the -NH- group of the reactive sugar with a bifunctional<br>
reagent of the structure X-tether-Y or X-tether-Yp, wherein X is a nitro-<br>
gen-reactive functional group and Y is a second reactive functional<br>
group and Yp is a latent functional group that can be converted to or<br>
deprotected to a reactive functional group Y, thereby obtaining a sugar<br>
covalently attached to said tether-Y or said tether-Yp.<br>
This step is preferably performed using compound E of fig. 1 as starting material.<br>
Thus this step may for example generate a compound of the general structure H of<br>
fig. 1.<br>
In embodiments of the invention wherein the bifunctional reagent is of the structure<br>
X-tether-Yp, then preferably, the method furthermore comprises the step of convert-<br>
ing or deprotecting Yp to obtain a reactive functional group Y. This step may be per-<br>
formed before or after reacting X with -NH-, preferably it is performed subsequent to<br>
reacting X with -NH-.<br>
In addition the methods of the invention may furthermore comprise the steps of<br>
viii. providing a second derivatising agent comprising a functional<br>
group (Z) capable of reacting with Y<br><br>
ix. reacting the functional groups Z and Y, thereby covalently attaching<br>
the second derivatising agent to the sugar via a tether and the first de-<br>
rivatising agent.<br>
Alternatively, the methods of the invention may further comprise the step of:<br>
viii. providing a particle selected from the group consisting of eu-<br>
karyotic cells, prokaryotic cells, microbial organisms, micelles, phages,<br>
vira and nanoparticles, wherein the particle comprises a functional<br>
group (Z) capable of reacting with Y.<br>
ix. reacting the functional groups Z and Y, thereby covalently attaching<br>
the particle to the sugar via the tether and and the agent.<br>
Step ix. may thus generate a compound of the general structure I outlined in fig. 1<br>
where the TAG is a particle. Provided that the linker is a cleavable linker, the meth-<br>
ods may further comprise the step of cleaving the linker thereby for example gener-<br>
ating a compound of the general structure J of fig. 1.<br>
The product of the reaction of SugarCH-NH-Linker-Spacer-Solid (e.g. compound E<br>
of fig. 1) with Afunctional reagents X-tether-Y for example has the general structure<br>
H and may contain, or can be made to contain, further reactive groups that can<br>
form covalent bonds to assemblies larger than molecules: for example bacteria,<br>
phage, yeast, micelles, viruses, nanoparticles or eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells.<br>
Cleavage of the linker then results in specles of the general formula SugarCH-<br>
N(assembly)-Linker, effectively adding the sugar to the assembly. Thus, the sugar<br>
can in princlple be transferred from a solid support to an assembly.<br>
Enzyme treatment<br>
If the solid support is biocompatible, i.e. permits contact with biologlcal macromoie-<br>
cules like enzymes without significantly altering thelr activities, then the immobilised<br>
sugar molecule can be acted on by enzymes that will alter its structure. The immobi-<br>
lised sugar molecule may for example be a compound of any of the general struc-<br>
tures C, Cred, D, E, F, H or I of fig. 1.<br><br>
Non-limiting examples of biocompatible solid supports includes glass, PEGA,<br>
SPOCC or polysaccharide gels. Within this embodiment it is preferred that the linker<br>
is relatively long, and thus it is preferred that the linker comprises at least 2 atoms,<br>
preferably at least 6 atoms, more preferably the linker comprises a chain of at least<br>
6 atoms, for example the longest chain of atoms within the linker is at least 6 atoms<br>
long, such as in the range of 6 to 1000 atoms long. It is also preferred that the linker<br>
is hydrophilic.<br>
It is also possible to contact the sugars liberated into solution by cleavage of a<br>
cleavable linker, such as the compounds G or J of fig. 1 with biologlcal macromole-<br>
cules, such as enzymes.<br>
The enzymes can belong to any class that can act on carbohydrates, for example<br>
glycosidases, glycosyltransferases, and enzymes that modify the alcohol groups by<br>
acylation, phosphorylation, sulfation or oxidation. Alternatively, if the sugars are al-<br>
ready substituted on -OH groups, such as acylated, phosphorylated or sulphated,<br>
then deacylases, phosphatases and sulfatases can alter thelr structures. Thus the<br>
methods of the invention may furthermore comprise the step of contacting the sugar<br>
(for example any of the compounds C, Cred, D, E, F, G, H, I or J of fig. 1) with one or<br>
more enzymes selected from the classes of glycosyltransferases, sulfatases, pho-<br>
phorylases, sulfotransferases, phosphotransferases, glycosynthases and transgly-<br>
cosidases, thereby converting said sugar into a new structure. In a preferred em-<br>
bodiment the methods furthermore comprise the step of contacting the sugar (for<br>
example any of the compounds C, Cred, D, E, F, G, H, I or J of fig. 1) with one or<br>
more glycosidases, thereby generating a new reducing sugar, provided that the first<br>
sugar is a substrate for said glycosidase(s).<br>
An example would include the incubation of uncapped Sugar-C=N-Linker-Spacer-<br>
Solid (for example, compounds C of fig. 1), which still contains free -NH2 groups,<br>
with an exoglycosidase causing the decrease in the length of the sugar by one<br>
monosaccharide residue. The cleavage of this monosaccharide residue leaves an<br>
oligosaccharide attached to the solid support that is one sugar unit shorter, and pro-<br>
duces a reducing sugar which can be captured by the same or a different solid sup-<br>
port, such as a solid support of the general structure B in fig 1, which can subse-<br>
quently be submitted to any of the manipulations described above in B to J.<br><br>
Thus the methods of the invention may furthermore comprise the steps of<br>
a)	providing one or more enzymes that can act on carbohydrates<br>
b)	contacting the sugar with said one or more enzymes<br>
These steps may be performed at any glven time during the method. The enzymes<br>
may be any of the enzymes described in the present section.<br>
In a particular embodiment the enzyme is a glycosidase and the method described<br>
herein above in the summary section comprises the further steps of:<br>
iii.a) providing one or more glycosidases that can act on carbohydrates<br>
iii.b) contacting the sugar with said one or more glycosidases, thereby generating a<br>
new reducing sugar, provided that the first sugar is a substrate for said glycosi-<br>
dase(s).<br>
iii.c) immobilising newly generated reducing sugar(s) on a solid support.<br>
The steps iii.a-iii.c may be carried out following step iii. of the method outlined in the<br>
section "Summary of the invention" herein above. However, the steps iii.a to iii.c<br>
may also be carried out following any of steps iv, v, vi or vii of said method. Accord-<br>
ingly, steps iii.a-iii.c may be carried out on any of the immobilized sugars exemplified<br>
by structures C, Cred- D, E, F, H or I of fig. 1.<br>
In particular, said newly generated reducing sugars may be immobilised to free -<br>
NH2 groups of the same solid support or on another solid support. Said other solid<br>
support may for example elther be unsubstituted or carry an immobilised reference<br>
standard. It is preferred that said other solid support is a solid support as described<br>
herein above, and that the solid support is attached to a linker (optionally via a<br>
spacer), wherein said linker comprises a capture group (see detalled description of<br>
linkers, capture groups and spacers herein above).<br>
Of particular value is the reduction and fluorescence labeling of the glycosidase<br>
product and the released monosaccharide on the same or a different solid support,<br>
for purposes of obtaining structural information. A speclfic example includes the cap-<br>
ture of Gal-GlcNAc-Gal-glc (lacto-N-tetraose, LNT) on NH2-Linker-Spacer-Solid of<br><br>
structure B (fig 1), incubation of the captured and immobilized LNT (an example of a<br>
compound of structure C of fig. 1) with beta-galactosidase followed by capture of the<br>
released galactose on the same solid support (C) to yleld a mixture of unreacted<br>
Gal-GlcNAc~Gal-GlcC=N-Linker-Spacer-Solid, and the products of the reaction<br>
which are GlcNAc-Gal-GlcC=N-Linker-Spacer-Solid and Gal- C=N-Linker-Spacer-<br>
Solid. Capping, reduction, fluorescence tagglng with TRITC and cleavage form the<br>
solid as described in step F—&gt;G above then allows confirmation that the immobilized<br>
LNT had a terminal beta-galactose residue, by co-migration of the trisaccharide and<br>
monosaccharide products with known standards.<br>
Many useful glycosidases are described in the art, for example any of the glycosi-<br>
dases described in US5,100,778 or W092/19974 may be employed with the present<br>
invention.<br>
If the solid support is biocompatible, then the unreacted -NH2 groups in Sugar-C=N-<br>
Linker-Spacer-Solid (e.g. compound C, fig 1) can be capped (for example with ace-<br>
tic anhydride as described in C-&gt;D above) and then exposed to carbohydrate-active<br>
enzymes, or further reduced to SugarCH-NH-Linker-Spacer-Solid (as described in<br>
section D—&gt;E above) and then exposed to carbohydrate-active enzymes. Alterna-<br>
tively, compound C of fig. 1 can be reduced to Cred and then exposed to carbohy-<br>
drate active enzymes. The SugarCH-NH-Linker-Spacer-Solid (e.g. compound E, fig<br>
1) can be further tagged (as described in sections E-»F herein above) to yleld Sug-<br>
arCH-N(TAG)-Linker-Spacer-Solid (e.g. compound F, fig 1), and then exposed to<br>
carbohydrate-active enzymes. In any of these processes, the product of the enzyme<br>
reaction that remains attached to the solid support can be further manipulated ac-<br>
cording to the methods of the invention or cleaved by reaction at the linker, for fur-<br>
ther analysis. Any product of the enzyme reaction that results in cleavage of frag-<br>
ments of the immobilized sugar will appear in solution, where it may be further in-<br>
vestigated using established techniques of analytical chemistry or, in the case where<br>
it is itself a reducing sugar, may be subjected to the manipulations described for the<br>
generic sugar A in Fig 1.<br>
The individual sugars may be detected by capillary gas chromatography (GC), mi-<br>
crocolumn supercritical fluld chromatography (SFC), microcolumn liquld chromatog-<br>
raphy (LC), high performance liquld chromatography (HPLC), high performance cap-<br><br>
illary electrophoresis (HPCE), ion-exchange chromatography or mass-spectrometry.<br>
Detection of individual sugars may be done before or after labelling with a derivatis-<br>
ing agent, and elther in solution or on the solid phase.<br>
Detection agents<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the method comprises the steps of<br>
viii. contacting the sugar with a detection agent capable of assoclating<br>
with said sugar<br>
ix. detecting the detection agent<br>
Preferably, said sugar is immobilised on a solid support as described herein above,<br>
and thus for example a compound of the general structure C, Cred, D, E, F, H or I of<br>
fig. 1 may be contacted with said detection agent. It is also possible that said sugar<br>
has been released from the solid support by cleavage of a cleavable linker, as thus<br>
a compound of the general structure G or J may also be contacted with said detec-<br>
tion agent.<br>
The detection agent may be any agent capable of assoclating with said sugar. Pre-<br>
ferred detection agents are compounds capable of assoclating with sugars with<br>
much higher affinity than with any other compounds, such as compounds having at<br>
least a 2-fold, such as at least a 5-fold higher affinity for sugars, than for any other<br>
compound.<br>
In addition it is preferred that said detection agent is directly or indirectly detectable<br>
by a method known to the skilled person. For example the detection agent may itself<br>
be for example a fluorescent or coloured compound, The detection agent may also<br>
be a compound for which easy detection methods are avallable.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the detection agent comprises an aryl boronate<br>
or heteroaryl boronate where the aryl moiety is substituted with a spectroscopically<br>
active group such as a fluorescent TAG or any of the other detectable TAGs de-<br>
scribed herein above in the section "F. TAGs with spectroscopic properties".<br><br>
In another embodiment the detection agent is a polypeptide, preferably a polypep-<br>
tide selected from the group consisting of lectins, selectins and other carbohydrate<br>
binding proteins, toxins, receptors, antibodies and enzymes. When the detection<br>
agent is a polypeptide, said polypeptide may be coupled to a detectable label, such<br>
as an enzyme or a fluorescent compound. The polypeptide may also be detected by<br>
the aid of antibodies or similar high affinity compounds.<br>
Examples<br>
The following are illustrative examples of the methods of the invention and should<br>
not be considered as limiting for the invention. Unless otherwise clear from the con-<br>
text, capital letters A, B, C, Cred, D, E, F, G, H, I and J refers to the general struc-<br>
tures outlined in fig. 1.<br>

N-Fmoc-4-aminooxymethyl-benzoic acld (12, 2.0 g, 5.14 mmol) was dissolved in<br>
DMF (30 mL) and Cs2CO3 (0.84 g, 2.57 mmol) was added followed by stirring for 5<br>
min at rt. Benzyl bromide (1.05 g, 6.17 mmol) was added and the mixture was al-<br>
lowed to stir for another 30 min at rt. Water (200 mL) was added and the mixture<br><br>
was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 x 100 mL). The combined organic phases were<br>
washed with water (3 x 50 mL), dried over MgSO4, evaporated to dryness to yleld an<br>
oil which was used without further characterization in the next experiment.<br>
17: Removal of Fmoc-group from benzyl-(N-Fmoc-4-aminooxymethyl)-<br>

The crude product (16) obtained in the previous experiment was stirred with 20%<br>
piperidine in DMF (20 mL) for 1 min and passed through a bed of silica gel to re-<br>
move the majority of DMF and piperidine by suction. The product was eluted from<br>
the bed of silica gel with a mixture of ethyl acetate and pet. ether (1:1) and concen-<br>
trated on a rotavap. Further purification was achieved by flash column chromatogra-<br>
phy (ethyl acetate, petroleum ether 1:1) to glve a clear oil in a yleld of 1.16 g (88%,<br>

18: Oxime formation between galactose and benzyl-(4-aminooxymethyl)-<br>
benzoate<br>
Galactose (90 mg, 0.50 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of DMSO and AcOH (7:3,<br>
3 mL) and (17,128 mg, 0.50 mmol) was added. The mixture was heated for 3 h at<br>
55°C and poured into water (30 mL) and cooled on an ice bath which caused the<br>
product to crystallize as fine white crystals. The product was isolated by filtration,<br>
washed with water (2x10 mL) and dried under vacuum to yleld the 170 mg (83%)<br>

19: Reduction of "galaclose-oxime" (18) with BH3-pyridine<br>
The oxime (18, 150 mg, 0.36 mmol) obtained in the previous experiment was dis-<br>
solved in methanol (10 mL). BH3-pyridine (225 µL, 8 M solution in pyridine, 1.80<br>
mmol, Fluka) and CCl3CO2H (0.50 mL, 50% aqueous solution) were added and the<br>
mixture was stirred for 1 h at rt. The reaction mixture was carefully poured into a<br>
half-saturated solution of Na2CO3 (20 mL) and extracted with a 1:1 mixture of ether<br>
and hexanes (2x10 ml) to remove excess borane reagent. The pH was now ad-<br>
justed to 2-3 by careful addition of Hcl(COnc.) and the volume was reduced to half of<br>
the origlnal on a ratovap. During the evaporation the product separated out as nice<br>
white crystalline solid, which was filtered of, washed with water (2x10 mL), ether (2<br>
x 10 mL) and finally the product was dried under vacuum to glve 112 mg (75%) of<br>
pure product. 1H-NMR (250 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ = 3.31-3.33 (2H, m), 3.40-3.55 (5H,<br>

20: Labelling of reduced product (19) using TRITC<br>
A small amount of the product (19,4.2 mg, 10 µmol) prepared in previous experi-<br>
ment was dissolved in DMF (1 mL) and TRITC (4.4 mg, 10 µmol) was added. After<br>
stirring for 1 h water (10 mL) was added and the preclpitated product was re-<br>
dissolved by addition of Hcl(Conc.) and the clear red solution was applied to a small C-<br>
18 Sep-Pak column to bind the product. The column was flushed several times with<br>
water (total volume 30 mL) followed by release of the product with methanol (5 mL).<br>
The volume was reduced to approximately 0.5 mL and the material was purified by<br>
flash column chromatography on silica gel with a mixture of CH2Cl2, methanol, wa-<br>
ter, AcOH (70:20:9:1). The identity of the compound was confirmed by MS and used<br>
directly in the next experiment. MS (MaidI-TOF) m/z = 865 (MH+).<br>
21: Hydrolysis of ester protecting group to glve final standard<br>
All the material (2O) obtained in the previous experiment was dissolved in 1 M LiOH<br>
(1 mL) and stirred for 30 min followed by addition of water (10 mL) and acldification<br>
with Hcl(conc.) to glve a clear red solution. The product was desalted on a small C-18<br>
Sep-Pak column by repeated washings with water (total volume 30 mL) followed by<br><br>
release of the product with methanol (5 mL). The volume was reduced to approxi-<br>
mately 0.5 mL and the product was purified by flash column chromatography on<br>
silica gel with a mixture of chloroform, methanol, water (120:85:2O). The identity of<br>
the compound was confirmed by high resolution MS and its purity was analysed<br>
using CE. HRMS (ES) calculated (C39H43N4O11S): 775,2649 found: 775.2700<br>
Standards of the remaining monosaccharides (glucose, mannose, N-<br>
acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, xylose, fucose and glucuronic acld)<br>
were prepared using the same protocol as described for galactose in similar ylelds<br>
and purity. The compounds' identities were likewise confirmed by high resolution<br>
mass spectroscopy (see table below). Each compound gave a single peak in CE,<br>
and all 8 compounds (21-28) could be resolved in CE (Fig. 10).<br><br>
3. Examples of B: Preparation and nomenclature of solid supports<br>
Solid supports of general structure B (Fig. 1) were prepared using both PEGA resin<br>
(PEGA 1900, Versamatrix A/S) and controlled-pore glass (CPG). Bp indicates a<br>
PEGA resin where the linker is attached directly to the amino groups on the com-<br>
merclal resin without a spacer. B°, B1 and B2 indicate CPG where the linker has<br>
been attached through 0,1 and 2 spacers respectively to aminopropylated glass<br><br>
(AMP-CPG, CPG-Biotech). The structures of the four solid supports are shown in<br>
Fig. 6.<br>
3.1	Bp (PEGA resin of general structure B)<br>
1 g of commerclal PEGA 1900 resin (loading of amino groups: 0.23 mmol/g) swelled<br>
in methanol was washed repeated time with DMF to ensure complete removal of the<br>
methanol. The linker (14) (308 mg, 0.69 mmol), TBTU (207 mg, 644 mmol) and<br>
DIPEA (119 mg, 0.92 mmol) were mixed in DMF (10 mL) and left to pre-activate for<br>
5 min before adding the mixture to the resin. After 3 h the reagents were removed<br>
by suction and the resin was washed with CH2Cl2 (5 x 20 mL).<br>
A small portion of the resin was taken out for Kalser test which confirmed a success-<br>
ful coupling of the linker to the resin. Likewise, the loading of linker on the resin was<br>
determined as described in example 3.3 and found to be approximately 0.20 mmol/g<br>
by comparison with a standard curve. The hydroxylamine protecting group (Fmoc)<br>
was now removed from the remaining resin by treatment with 20% piperidine in<br>
DMF (15 mL for 2 min and 15 mL fori 8 min) followed by extensive washings with<br>
DMF (5 x 20 mL) and CH2Cl2 (7 x 20 mL). The resin was dried under high vacuum<br>
for 24 h to glve the final PEGA resin (Bp) which was used for all subsequent experi-<br>
ments.<br>
3.2	B°, B1 and B2 (Controlled pore glass, CPG)<br>
B°: Coupling of linker 14 with CPG-NH2<br>
AMP CPG (250 mg, loading = 50.1 µmol/g, 0.0125 mmol. Millipore, product no.<br>
AMP1400B) was washed with DMF (3 x 2 mL), 50% DIPEA in DMF (3 x 2 mL), and<br>
DMF (3x2 mL). The beads were treated with a mixture of 14 (17 mg, 0.038 mmol),<br>
TBTU (12 mg, 0.037 mmol), and DIPEA (8.6 µL, 0.05 mmol) in DMF at rt over night.<br>
The beads were washed with DMF (3x2 mL), CH2Cl2 (3x2 mL), and treated with<br>
50% of AC20 in pyridine for 15 min at rt, washed with CH2Cl2 (3^2 mL), DMF (3x2<br>
mL), CH2Cl2 (3x2 mL), and dried. The loading was determent to 14.2 µmol/g as<br>
described for B1. The Fmoc group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF for 2<br>
x 10 min at rt and washed with, DMF (3x2 mL), CH2Cl2 (3x2 mL), and ethanol (3<br>

3.3 Example of the estimation of the loading of capture groups on solid sup-<br>
ports of general structure B (Fig. 1)<br>
Seven concentrations of Fmoc-Gly-OH in 20% piperidine in DMF (0.0 mM, 0.1 mM,<br>
0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM, 1.5 mM, 2,0 mM) were prepared. The UV absorbance of<br>
released fulvene were measured at 290 nm using nonodrop technology (Saveen<br>
Werner Nanodrop, Model: ND-1000, Serial No: 0911). The absorbance was plotted<br>
against the concentration glving a linear curve with slope 0.581 mM"1.<br>
Fmoc protected B1 beads (4.8 mg) were treated with 20% piperidine in DMF (200<br>
pL) for 10 min. The UV absorbance at 290 nm was measured to 0.410 and the lib-<br>
erated fulvene concentration was calculated<br><br>
4. Examples of A+B-&gt;C, and processing of C.<br>
4.1 Variation of capture conditions using glucose as the reducing sugar and<br>
B2 as the solid support.<br>
Various solvents, temperatures and additives were examined in order to find prefer-<br>
able conditions for the capture of reducing sugars on solid supports of general struc-<br>
ture B, to produce C. D-glc was used as the model compound, as the amount of<br>
uncaptured Glc in solution could be readily estimated with high sensitivity using the<br><br>
Ampiex Red assay from Molecular Probes. The amount of Glc captured was thus<br>
calculated to be the amount added minus the amount remaining in solution after<br>
incubation.<br>
15-20 mg of beads (B2) were treated with a solution of glucose under different con-<br>
ditions. After end reaction time the supernatant was removed and the amount of un-<br>
reacted glucose was estimated using the Amplex Red Glucose/Glucose Oxidase<br>
Assay Kit (A-22189, Molecular Probes).<br>
Capture of glucose using different solvents, concentrations, temperatures and<br>
reaction times<br><br>
4.2 Capture, processing and analysis of representative reducing sugars on Bp.<br>
The following designations are used below to describe compounds of the general<br>
structures C, Cred, D, E, F,G, H, I and J (Fig. 1). The particular letter describing the<br>
particular structure under discussion is glven first, e.g. C or E. The next superscript<br>
number refers to which of the four solid supports shown in Fig. 6 was used. Thus, by<br>
way of example if Bp (Fig. 6) is used to capture a sugar, then the product will have<br>
the general structure C which is further designated as Cp. The next number refers to<br>
which of the ten samples of reducing sugars shown in Fig. 2 was captured. Thus,<br>
Cp2 refers to the product of the PEGA resin Bp that has captured galactose (com-<br>
pound 2 of Fig. 2). In the same way, D25 would refer to the product obtained when<br><br>
the solid support B2 has captured the tetrasaccharide LNT (5, Fig. 2) to glve Cz5,<br>
and then been further capped to D25.<br>

5. Reaction of immobilized oligosaccharides with enzymes<br>
5.1 Reaction of an immobilized tagged oligosaccharide with a glycosidase<br>
5.1.1	Reaction of immobilized lacto-N-tetraose (LNT, 5) of structure F (cap = acetyl,<br>
TAG = TMR) with beta-galactosidase (bovine testes, SIGMA product G-4142,<br>
1U/mL) on CPG supports with none (F°5), one (F15) and two (F25)spacers. All 3<br>
immobilized oligosaccharides were prepared essentially as described for F15 (sec-<br>
tion 4.3.2).<br>
The solid supports (5 mg) were incubated with beta-galactosidase (100 ul_ of 0.2<br>
U/mL solution in 0.1 M cltrate/phosphate buffer pH 5.0 containing 0.2% BSA for 23 h<br>
at 37°C, and the resin was then washed with 3 x water, 3 × ethanol, 3 × CH2Cl2, 3 x<br>
Et ethanol OH, and 3 x water. The beads were treated with 1 M solution of LiOH (60 3<br>
µL) for 1 h at rt glving products of the general structures G°5, G15, and G25 in solu-<br>
tion. Each red solution was collected by filtration. The filtrate was neutralised with<br>
50% AcOH and analysed using CE.<br>
Fig. 20 shows that there was no detectable cleavage of galactose from LNT for F°5,<br>
39% conversion for F15 (i.e. 39% of the tetrasaccharide had lost the terminal Gal<br>
residue and been converted to the trisaccharide) and 83% conversion for F25. The<br>
nature of the spacer was therefore found to be important to the course of the en-<br>
zyme reaction.<br>
5.1.2	Reaction of immobilized maltotriose F24 (cap = acetyl, TAG = TMR) with glu-<br>
coamylase 2 from Asperglllus niger (kindly provided by Dr. Birte Svensson, Carls-<br>
berg Laboratories) on CPG support with two spacers. F24 was prepared essentially<br>
as described for F15 (section 4.3.2) but using maltotriose (G3, Fig. 2) as the reduc-<br>
ing sugar and B2 as the solid support. F24 (ca 5 mg) was incubated for 23 h at 37°C<br>
with 50 µL of 0.1 mg/mL of enzyme in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.5 contain-<br>
ing 0.2% BSA. After washing and cleavage as described above, the product was<br>
analyzed by CE (Fig. 21), which showed complete conversion of immobilized la-<br>
belled maltotriose to a new peak eluting between labelled maltotriose and glucose,<br>
therefore assigned as the maltobiose (G2) TMR adduct.<br><br>
5.2 Reaction of an immobilized untagged oligosaccharide with a glycosidase and<br>
capture of the released reducing monosaccharide on the same support.<br>
Reaction of immobilized LNT of structure C25 (non-reduced, non-capped, non-<br>
tagged) with beta-galactosidase (bovine testes) was carried out on CPG solid sup-<br>
port with two spacers. C25 was prepared essentially as described for C15 (section<br>
4.3.2). Prior to use, the enzyme solution was freed from small-molecule contami-<br>
nants by repeated centrifugation using a Microcon YM-3 centrifugal filter device (Mil-<br>
lipore). C25 (5 mg) was incubated for 23 h at 37°C with 55 µL of 0.9 U/mL of enzyme<br>
in 0.1 M cltrate/phosphate, pH 5.0, containing 0.2% BSA, and then a further 20 h at<br>
55CC to permit capture of released galactose. The solid was washed, reduced,<br>
capped with acetic anhydride, tagged using TRITC and cleaved with LiOH as de-<br>
scribed above for the conversion of C15 to G15. The CE of cleaved product is shown<br>
in Fig. 22 which shows the presence of unreacted LNT (32%) and similar amounts<br>
of both the TMR-labelled product trisaccharide and cleaved galactose. This experi-<br>
ments confirms the capture of cleaved sugar on the same uncapped support from<br>
which it was cleaved.<br>
6. Variation of capping agents<br>
6.1. Capping of C to produce D<br>
A selection of capping agents was used to effect the conversions C goes to D (Fig.<br>
1). C22 was used as the substrate (where the solid was CPG with 2 spacers and the<br>
captured sugar was galactose). The amino groups on C were then capped with,<br>
among others, acetic anhydride, benzoic anhydride, tricholoracetic anhydride and<br>
dibromoxylene (Fig. 6). The capping was carried with 50% solutions of the capping<br>
agent in ethanol, for 15-120 min at it The samples were then processed as de-<br>
scribed for the conversion of C12 to G12 (section 4.3.1), i.e., reduction, labelling us-<br>
ing TRITC, base-cleavage and analysis by CE. The results are shown in Fig. 23<br>
which shows that all conditions provided the target TMR-labelled galactose (com-<br>
pound 21, Fig. 5) with varylng amounts of other impurities appearing before com-<br>
pound 21 in the electropherogram.<br><br>
6.2 ExampJe of capping of Cred to produce E<br>
C22 from section 6.1 above was reduced with BH3-pyridine as described for the con-<br>
version of D12 to E12 above (section 4.3.1). The product CreCl22 differs from E12 in<br>
that it contains uncapped NH2 groups. Cred22 (5 mg) was reacted with benzoic acld<br>
NHS-ester (0.4 mg, 1.75 µmol) and TEA (1.0 µL) in DMF (50 pL) over night at 60°C.<br>
The product of the reaction having the general structure E22 (with the cap being a<br>
benzoate) was then washed and processed as usual, by tagglng using TRITC,<br>
cleavage and analysis by CE. Fig. 24 shows the product to be substantially the<br>
same as that formed by the sequence C goes to D goes to E and on to G. The iden-<br>
tity of the product was confirmed by its MS (ES) m/z = 775.0 (Mt-f).<br>
