This invention relates to the inspection of cosmetically tinted contact<br>
lenses or molds that are used in the formation of the tinted contact lenses,<br>
more particularly to pad printed molds that are used in the formation of the<br>
tinted contact lenses.<br>

(VTN0602) all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.<br>
Before this invention, automated inspection techniques had not been<br>
30     used for inspecting the application of tint to a tinted contact lens.  The<br>
application of the tint was either not inspected of it was done manually, by<br>
operators who visually inspect each lens to determine if the tint contains any<br>
irregularities, and if the layers of tint are concentric to the edge of the mold. If<br><br>
WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br><br>
any irregularity or flaw in the tint was found and it made the lens unsuitable for<br>
consumer use, the lens was identified so that it was not subsequently sold to a<br>
consumer.<br>
This prior art inspection system is subject to human error. Additionally,<br>
5     a manual inspection step would likely be located after the lens hast gone<br>
through most, if not all, of the manufacturing steps. An automated inspection<br>
system that could be inserted at any convenient location within the<br>
manufacturing line would be desirable to avoid fully processing lenses that will<br>
ultimately be rejected. Additionally, if the inspection system is immediately<br>
10     after the application of the colorant to a lens or to a lens mold, then if there are<br>
a high number of rejects, a problem within the area of the machine where the<br>
colorants are applied can be immediately addressed, and not discovered much<br>
later during production after many more lenses have been made having a<br>
defect in the colorant,<br>
15                This invention provides a method and system that inspects the tint<br>
and/or printed patterns on a contact lens or mold for molding a contact lens<br>
therein. The method and system finds defects including voids in the colorant,<br>
excess colorant, and incorrect position of the colorant and/or pattern(s) of the<br>
colorant with respect to the center and for edges of the ophthalmic products,<br>
20     e.g. mold or contact lens or other colorant layers.<br>
One benefit of this invention is that the inspection does not have to be<br>
done on finished lenses, but can be done immediately after the colorant is<br>
added to the mold or lens. This provides immediate feedback to the machine<br>
to relect for various defects and allows the machine operator to react quickly if<br>
25     numerous defects in the colorant arts being made. Art additional benefit is that<br>
because defects are difficult to define, standardize and learn, human<br>
inspection often gave inconsistent results, whereas the automated system<br>
gives more consistent results. This invention also comprises the system<br>
described herein for performing the method of this invention.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
This invention provides a method for inspecting ophthalmic parts comprising<br>
15     colorants the method comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of the<br>
steps of:<br>
a)       capturing an image of said ophthalmic part comprising at least<br>
one colorant wherein said image comprises an array of pixels and said<br>
at least one colorant is present in a portion of said image;<br>
20                b)       locating a reference means in said image of said ophthalmic part<br>
and finding the center of said reference means;<br>
c)        faceting at least one first pixel area in the portion of said image of<br>
said ophthalmic part comprising said at least one colorant,<br>
d)        comparing the location of said at least one first pixel area to the<br>
25                 location of a first pixel standard to determine the location of said<br>
colorant center, and<br>
comparing the location of the center of said reference means lo<br>
the Location of said colorant center to determine if said at least one<br>
colorant is properly located on said ophthalmic part.<br>
30<br>
As used herein, the term "ophthalmic part" refers to a tinted contact lenses or<br>
transparent or semi-transparent object used in the production of the tinted<br>
contact lenses. Ophthalmic parts may be tinted by a number of methods which<br>
3<br><br>
WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br>
include but are not limited to pad printing on the contact lens, pad printing on<br>
the fens mold, tinting in a solution, adding colorants la the reaction mixture<br>
used to form the contact lens; however, the preferred ophthalmic parts are lens<br>
molds that are pad printed with colorants. As used herein, the term "colorant"<br>
5      means any organic or inorganic composition that may be used to impart a<br>
visible color an article. The inspection of a pad printed lens mold having<br>
colorant thereon will be described below, but these methods maybe applied to<br>
all tinted ophthalmic parts.<br>
When lens molds are tinted, the colorant can be applied in single or<br>
10      multiple layers of transparent colorants and/or opaque colorants or<br>
combinations of any of those. The methods and system of the invention<br>
inspect and verify the print quality and registration tolerance (either or both<br>
concentriclly and the pattern to pattern distance) of each printed layer of<br>
colorant either step-wise after each individual colorant layer is applied or in one<br>
15      step after all the colorant has been applied to the lens mold.  If multiple<br>
colorant layers are applied the colorants are typically applied in individual<br>
layers that typically overlap, although colorant layers that do not overlap could<br>
be inspected using the machine vision system described herein. Additionally,<br>
there may be a clear binder layer added to the ophthalmic part as a separate<br>
20      layer without added colorant, which may be referred to as a "foundation layer".<br>
This layer is typically transparent so unless there is a major defect in the binder<br>
layer, it will not be inspected in the method of this invention.<br>
Currently, there are two types of tinted contact lenses in the industry.<br>
Enhancer contact lenses enhance a user's natural iris color and opaque<br>
25      contact lenses change the user's natural iris color. Both types of lenses can be<br>
made by using lens molds containing colorant. The enhancer contact lens<br>
mold is composed of at least one layer of translucent colorant. The translucent<br>
colorant is applied in one or more layers to a circular area of the contact lens<br>
covering the iris and pupil area or to a donut-shaped (iris-shaped) area of the<br>
30     contact lens covering only the iris of the contact lens wearer. The transparent<br>
layers of the enhancers are shown in Figures 1(covering the iris) and 7. (iris-<br>
shaped). Opaque contact lens molds contain 2 or more layers of opaque<br>
and/or translucent layers in any combination.  Preferably the opaque contact<br>
4<br><br>
WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br>
lens molds contain at least one translucent layer as shown in Figure 1 or 2, and<br>
at least one opaque layer. The opaque layers typically are not solid colorant<br>
layers that cover the entire iris, but consist of patterns within a boundary having<br>
a donut-shape (iris shape), such as shown fn Figures 3 and 4.   Figures 3 and<br>
5     4 show the patterns that make up a striae layer and a feather layer,<br>
respectively; however, any pattern e.g. consisting of dots, or cross-hatches,<br>
etc. can be used to create the colorant patterned layers of the opaque lens. In<br>
one preferred embodiment, the contact lens molds comprise a binder layer, a<br>
translucent layer, an opaque layer comprising a striae design and may be<br>
10 referred to as the "striae layer" and another opaque layer comprising a feather<br>
design and may be referred to as the "feather layer". However, the inspection<br>
methods and system described herein can be used to inspect enbsneere, and<br>
opaque contact lens molds with any number or combination of layers.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the tinted mold, is preferably the front<br>
15     curve lens mold which may or may not be attached to a frame, mounted onto a<br>
pallet are pad printed with layers of colorant as described in U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial Nos. 09/745,511; 09/792,671; 10/027,579; and 10/165,058,<br>
incorporated earlier by reference. After printing, the molds are conveyed to the<br>
inspection system. Molds, frames and pallets have been disclosed in the prior<br>
20      art, such as, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,094,609; 6,368,572 and 6,007t228, incorporated<br>
herein in their entireties.<br>
As used herein, the term "reference means" defines an area of the<br>
captured image that does not contain a colorant. The reference means may be<br>
the knife edge, outside edge of the mold, tab, or a feature added to the lens<br>
25     mold, such as a hatch mark, or the like, added to the mold specifically to be a<br>
registration means, in the preferred embodiment, the reference means is the<br>
knife edge 800 which as shown in Figure 8 shows up as a dark circular line;<br>
that is, a circular pattern of low intensity pixels (on a gray scale of 0-255, low<br>
intensity is less than or equal to about 30) in the pixel image. Alternatively, for<br>
30     a contact lens, the reference means could be the lens edge, which can be<br>
located as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,732. The same gradient orocess<br>
described in U.S. Pat No. 5,500,732 or in U.S. Pat. No, 5,640,464 that is used<br><br>
5<br><br>
WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br>
many layers, a model of each layer may be prepared.   In this invention, it is<br>
preferred that computer generated models of the colorant designs are used.<br>
As used herein, the phrase, "first pixel standard" refers to an area in a model of<br>
the colorant design. This area must be distinguishable from other areas<br>
5      containing colorant. Preferably the first pixel standard covers an area of the<br>
model of about 5x5 pixels, but can be larger.  This first pixel standard may be<br>
anywhere in the model other than the equivalent of the Optical Zone (defined<br>
hereinafter) or the reference means (defined hereinafter).  Preferably, the first<br>
pixel standard is in the area of the image equivalent to the iris of an eye, As<br>
10     used herein, the phrase "second pixel standard" refers an area of the model<br>
having the same characteristics as the first pixel standard, but located in a<br>
different portion of the model.<br>
As used herein, "capturing an image" tan be accomplished as described<br>
in U.S. Patent 5,500,732. In the presently preferred mode, the lighting is done<br>
15     with a constant-on (LED-Light Emitting Diode), white light source, using an<br>
electronic shutter mechanism on the camera to capture the image when the<br>
molds are properly positioned and stationary under the cameras.   If<br>
manufacturing requirements increase and fast conveying of the molds<br>
becomes necessary the imaging step could be accompolished using a storebe<br>
20     with moving parts as described in US 5,500,732. The frames or pallets<br>
carrying the molds are conveyed under the cameras, and above the lighting<br>
source, the shutter of the cameras is activated and the cameras capture in<br>
image of the maid carrying the colorant. The cameras may be gray-scale or<br>
color cameras. If a color camera is used the image will be divided into the red,<br>
25     green and blue layers on 3 chips in the color camera. If the camera is a gray-<br>
scale image the intensity of the light in the image is assigned a value of 0 to<br>
255 for each pixel in the image. Preferably, a 1024 by 1024 pixel array is used<br>
to capture the image for the single gray-scale image, although less or more<br>
resolution can be used if desired. For the color arrays, preferably fewer pixels<br>
30      are used, e.g., 768 by 494 pixel arrays for each color image, because more<br>
calculations have to be performed when three colors are captured within an<br>
individual images.  Figure 8 shows a single image of a mold and all the<br>
colorant layers thereon.  It is presently preferred to capture a color image of the<br>
7<br><br>
WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br><br>
mold and the colorant layers, so that the captured image can he separated into<br>
the red, green and blue portions of the entire image.<br>
The preferred system is shown in Figure 5.  Figure 5 shows four<br>
cameras 40. The cameras a me preferably color cameras. Sony XC-003 having<br>
5      having a 55 mm focal length Telecentric lenses 70 (with 0,75x Extension) with<br>
a 5 mm spacer between the camera body and the telecentric fens. The<br>
cameras are focused above a surface (not shown) upon which the lens curve<br>
molds (not shown) optionally on pallets (not shown) are pushed, so that the<br>
cameras are focused onto the lens curves (not shown).   In the surface (not<br>
10      shown) are holes through which light from light sources 80 is directed at the<br>
tens curves. The light sources am attached to a power supply 100 via power<br>
cables 90.<br>
Any conveyor mechanism can be used, for example a pusher arm or<br>
walking beam as described in US 5,5100,732, which is hereby incorporated by<br>
15     reference in its entirety. The molds attached to the frame can be conveyed<br>
without a pallet, individual molds are preferably conveyed on a pallet. The<br>
frame or pallet may ride on the surface in a channel directed by guide rails.<br>
Four lens curves (not shown) are placed between the cameras 40 and the light<br>
sources 80. Alternatively, the cameras may be mounted underneath the<br>
20     surface on which the pallets are conveyed facing up to allow imaging of the<br>
convex side of the pattern. An image of the colorant on the mold is captured<br>
by camera 40 and communicated via cables 50 to the Vision Processor/ Frame<br>
Grabber20 for processing. The Processor/Frame Grabber 20 is housed within<br>
computer 10.<br>
25                The software in the PC contains various algorithms that analyze the<br>
image of the lens mold having the colorant thereon.  The decision is sent via<br>
the PB 24 Opto IO Rack 13 and cable 12 to an external PLC computer (not<br>
shown) that controls a material handling device. This device will either allow<br>
the mold having colorant layers) thereon to continue through the process of<br>
30      manufacturing the tinted contact tens or it will remove it from further material<br>
processing.<br>
The next step is to analyze the captured image or images to determine if<br>
the colorant is property oriented on the ophthalmic part. The reference means<br>

of the image and the center of the reference means are located as previously<br>
discussed. As shown in Figure 9 the intensity values of the pixel image are<br>
scanned in multiple lines either across or up and down the image (lines A, B<br>
across two rows of pixels are shown) to find a reference means. After<br>
5     scanning the image, and locating adjacent pixels having low intensity that are<br>
part of the knife edge, the algorithm can define the circular Knife edge by<br>
calculating the circumference of the circle. Additional points can be located<br>
either before or after the circle is calculated to check for a misshapen mold, or<br>
to verify that the knife edge has been property located.<br>
10                If a single gray scale image of the colorant layer(s) is processed to<br>
determine the position of the design in the lens mold, then all three colorant<br>
layers may be treated as a single shape and the same gradient techniques<br>
described above that were used to locate the knife edge or outside edge of the<br>
mold in the pixel image are used to find the inside and for outside boundaries of<br>
15     the single colorant layer shape.  Using the location of the first pixel area and<br>
the location of the first pixel standard, the center of the colorant may be found.<br>
If location of the calculated colorant center is not within a specific distance of<br>
the location of the center of the reference means, ophthalmic part is rejected.<br>
Preferably parts are rejected if the distance between the center of the<br>
20     reference means and the colorant center are greater than about 0.9 mm, more<br>
preferably greater than about 0.6 mm, preferably greater than about 0.550 mm,<br>
more preferably, greater than about 0.300 mm, most preferably greater than<br>
about 0.200 mm.<br>
For the preferred embodiment three color images (red, green and blue<br>
25     color images) are created by the camera. The reference means on the<br>
ophthalmic part is found on at least one of the color images using the gradient<br>
technique described above, and then the algorithm calculates the location of<br>
the center of reference means.  Each color pixel image is analyzed using any<br>
the gradient processes, previously described, to locate the first pixel area and<br>
30     the colorant center of the colorant layers,  if parts of the individual layers are<br>
occluded by others, the visible parts of the layers are identified. Alternatively,<br>
when the design has multiple layers, the individual layers are compared to a<br>
previously stored pattern that was created by a commercially available graphics<br>

WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br>
design package. The colorant centers of each Individual layer may be<br>
calculated as described above,  Then, either the individual colorant centers<br>
determined from the individual color images are compared to each other or to<br>
the reference center to determine if the colorant layer or layers are in the<br>
5     proper location. If the centers are not within a specified distance from each<br>
other, preferably no than about 0.9 mm, more preferably greater than about 0.6<br>
mm, preferably greater than about 0.550 mm, more preferably, greater than<br>
about 0.300 mm, most preferably greater than about 0.200 mm, the ophthalmic<br>
part is rejected.<br>
10                  If using the outer edges of the pattern in the one or more colorant layers<br>
to form a circle to determine the center of the colorant layer is problematic<br>
since the outer edges of the pattern in the colorant layer may vary in their<br>
distance from the center of the colorant layer, the algorithm can be modified to<br>
search along a circle made midway through the expected location of the<br>
15     colorant layer. Along this circle, known features of the pattern are identified.<br>
Further, when several features of the pattern are identified, the center of the<br>
pattern is known, because the expected pattern is known.<br>
A further aspect of the indention provides a method for inspecting<br>
ophthalmic parts comprising colorants the method comprising, consisting<br>
20     esaentially of, or consisting of the steps of.<br>
a)       capturing an image of said ophthalmic part comprising at least<br>
one colorant wherein said image comprises an array of pixels and said<br>
at least one colorant is present in a portion of said image:<br>
b)       locating a reference means in said image of said ophthalmic part<br>
:25                  and finding the center of said reference means;<br>
c) analyzing said portion of said image comprising at least one<br>
colorant to determine the dimension of said portion and finding the<br>
colorant center of said image;<br>
d)       comparing the location of the center of said reference means to<br>
30                  said colorant center to determine if said at least one colorant is properly<br>
located on said ophthalmic part.<br>

The terms ophthalmic part, colorant, reference means, colorant center, and<br>
capturing an image all have their aforementioned meanings and preferred<br>
ranges. The terms "analyzing said portion" refers to measuring the contrast<br>
(difference in intensity) between the colorant portion and the remainder of the<br>
5     lens mold and using those measurements to calculate the circular area of that<br>
portion and its colorant center, using known non-linear regression analysis or<br>
known area-weighted (centroidial) calculations.  Once the location of the<br>
colorant center is known, it may be compared with the location of the reference<br>
center as previously described to determine if the lens mold may be used to<br>
10      prepare a tinted contact lens.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a method for inspecting<br>
ophthalmic parts comprising colorants the method comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of, or consisting of the steps of:<br>
a)        capturing an image of said ophthalmic part having at least one<br>
15                 colorant wherein said image comprises an array of pixels and said at<br>
least one colorant is present in a portion of said image:<br>
b)        capturing a reference image of a standard ophthalmic part<br>
wherein said reference image comprises an array of pixels and said at<br>
least one colorant is present in a portion of said reference image;<br>
20                c)        comparing the intensities of the image from step a) with the<br>
reference image from step b) to determine whether the image from step<br>
a) contains defects.<br>
The terms ophthalmic part, colorant, and capturing an image all have their<br>
aforementioned meanings and preferred ranges.<br>
25                The terms "reference image" and "standard ophthalmic part" refers to an<br>
image of an acceptable ophthalmic part which be used as the standard for<br>
judging other ophthalmic parts. The term "defects" refers to either the absence<br>
of colorant in a particular area of an ophthalmic part, (a void) or the presence<br>
of too much colorant (an excess) in a particular area of an ophthalmic part.<br>
30     The preferred ranges for defects shall be described in detail in later<br>
paragraphs.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, reference images are captured by a<br>
camera 40 and taught to the Vision Processor/Frame Grabber 20 for<br>
11<br><br>
WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br>
processing in computer 10 (Fig. 5) and stored in that system. Preferably the<br>
system is taught by imaging an ophthalmic part with an acceptable colorant<br>
layer thereon and having the system generate a pixel map for each of the color<br>
images in that colorant layer. If the ophthatmic part has multiple color layers,<br>
5     this step is repeated for alI colorant layers to be applied to the ophthalmic part,<br>
and for the ophthalmic part having all the colorant layers. The system<br>
generates individual images (pixel maps) for each individual colorant layer and<br>
for the all the colorant layers together. These images (pixel maps) can be used<br>
while performing inspections to analyze the images of the ophthalmic parts to<br>
10     be inspected. Alternatively, an ophthalmic part having all colorant layers can<br>
be taught to the system in a single step, and the system can develop the<br>
individual pixel maps by extracting the individual colorant layers from the full<br>
image.<br>
The intensities of the image of the part to be inspected and the<br>
15      reference image can be compared as a whole, by analyzing all portions of each<br>
image in a systematic matter.  In the preferred embodiment, the images may<br>
be compared in discrete zones.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, the zones include the optical zone 801, the iris<br>
pattern zone 800 and the knife edge zone 802. By defining the zones, the<br>
20     algorithm can begin its analysis of the pixels within each zone.<br>
The optical zone and the knife edge zone are checked to be sure that<br>
there is no stray colorant in those areas.   Colorant can mistakenly drip, or<br>
splash in the optical zone or knife edge zone by the pad printing equipment, or<br>
be present within these zones by the application of a improperly located<br>
25      colorant layer.  In the preferred embodiment the optical zone is the central 4<br>
mm of the image.  For this analysis, values for the sensitivity threshold, which<br>
is an allowable contrast in intensity between neighboring pixels, minimum<br>
defect size, which is an area in which the intensity values of the pixels are not<br>
within an acceptable range of intensities, and the defect size thresholds, which<br>
30      is the minimum allowable sum of the area of all the defects in a zone, are<br>
inputted into the algorithm and used by the system during the area inspections.<br>
Each zone can have different sensitivities and defect sizes depending upon<br>
12<br><br>
WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br><br>
how important it is to have an area free of excess colorant, or other defects in<br>
the colorant.<br>
Sensitivities for each zone of the image are set by an off-line lest<br>
method. The method involves presenting multiple images with absences and<br>
5     excess colorant to multiple human observers. For example, when the<br>
observers decide to reject an image for a given access, the sensitivity setting<br>
for excess iS first set to an insensitive level (e.g. 50) to ensure the lens passes<br>
when processed. The image is then reprocessed multiple times, each time<br>
with a slighily more sensitive setting (e.g. 49, 48, 47 ,46), until the image is<br>
10     rejected by the system. The sensitivity value that makes the image fail is used<br>
as a basis for the sensitivity setting for production.   This method continues for<br>
multiple excesses and absences in each of the image zones until all<br>
sensitivities for each color being produced are determined as shown in Table<br>
A. Defect size thresholds and minimum defect sizes are also determined in a<br>
15     similar fashion and are included in Table A.<br><br>
13<br><br>
WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br><br><br>
WO 2lH&gt;4/fmSi5                                                                                                 PCT/US2{H»mjfc*78<br><br>
Therefore, the sensitivity of the optical zone is typically high and the<br>
allowable amount of excess colorant is very low. In contrast, the sensitivity of<br>
5     the iris pattern zone can be relatively lower to allow some excess colorant.<br>
Excess colorant is a cosmetic consideration in the iris Pattern Zone and does<br>
not effect visual acuity, whereas excess colorant in the Optical Zone may affect<br>
visual acuity. Further, the knife edge zone, the area outside of the printed<br>
pattern, may also have lower sensitivity and a higher allowable area of excess<br>
10     ink than the optical zone for the same reason. All of these sensitivity values<br>
can be determined by the above described off-line method experimentation by<br>
analyzing acceptable and unacceptable tinted ophthalmic parts.<br>
For enhancer lens molds the range of minimum defect size for excesses<br>

For enhancer lens molds the range of minimum defect size for excesses<br>
in the outer buffer zone is about 0.8 mm to about 0.2 mm, preferably about<br>

The algorithm analyzes the pixels in the image to the optical zone for<br>
changes in intensity from one pixel to another (i.e. contrast).  Every pixel that is<br>
found above the intensity level corresponding to the sensitivity threshold is<br>
tracked in a database with its location, and the process continues with<br>
25     neighboring pixels to determine the size of the defect. The defect size is the<br>
area of neighboring pixels that are outside the allowed contrast range and the<br>
allowed pattern area.  (An area is determined based on the number of pixels,<br>
because the mold size is known and the total number of pixels within the area<br>
of the imaged mold is known.) Once the defect size has been determined, it is<br>
30      compared to the value for the minimum defect size area allowed.  If the defect<br>
size is below the minimum allowed defect size the process of analyzing the<br>
intensity levels of pixels continues to find any other defects if any. For each<br>
zone all the defect sizes found are preferably summed and compared to the<br>
17<br><br>
WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br>
value for the defect size threshold. If this summation exceeds the defect size<br>
threshold, the image is rejected. To analyze the pixels, the eight neigh to ring<br>
pixels can be analyzed as describe in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,732, earlier<br>
incorporated by reference. The eight neighboring pixel analysis continues for<br>
5     all the pixels within the zone, either until the defect areas or thresholds for the<br>
zone have been exceeded, or unit the all the pixels in the zone have been<br>
analyzed.  Each zone is analyzed in the same way; however the allowable<br>
range of sensitivities in the zone, the defect areas and the defect size<br>
thresholds can be adjusted; for each zone.<br>
10                 The preferred method of printing the lens molds causes darker colorant<br>
intensities at the borders of the iris pattern zone; therefore, in the most<br>
preferred method of inspecting, the algorithm defines two additional areas<br>
called the inner buffer zone and the outer buffer zone. The inner buffer zone<br>
and the outer buffer zone sensitivities and defect sizes are set to different<br>
15 values from the rest of the iris pattern zone. The inner buffer zone is preferably<br>
0.1 mm from the inside colorant border. The outer buffer zone is preferably 0.5<br>
mm from the outside colorant border.<br>
Alternatively, for colorant layers having sufficiently different and<br>
definable intensity ranges for each colorant layer in a single gray-scale image,<br>
20     e.g. for an ophthalmic part having a transparent enhancer layer and a dark<br>
opaque layer, the inspection could be performed by an algorithm that would<br>
determine based on the relative intensity values which intensity values<br>
correspond to which colorants. For example the lowest intensity value would<br>
correspond to no color, the next level of intensity values would correspond to<br>
25     the first colorant, e.g. transparent layer, and the next range of intensity values<br>
would correspond to the second colorant, e.g. the opaque layer. The values<br>
assigned to each colorant can also be checked by knowing the pattern for each<br>
colorant and comparing the pixel intensity values in the captured image to the<br>
expected location of the pixels in the patterns.<br>
30                 An alternate method of inspecting the zones would be to define, the<br>
numbers of pixels falling within specified ranges of intensities that correlate to<br>
ihs expected intensities of the colorants in the zone. As the intensities for<br>
pixels in a zone are read, they could be categorized into the specified ranges<br>
18<br><br>
WO 20O4/044545                                                                                                           PCT/US2003/036378<br>
and each range summed. If the number of pixels within those defined ranges<br>
does not correspond to an expected number, based on the known patterns and<br>
colorants that make up the colorant layers, then the mold is rejected.<br>
Therefore, if a pattern of an acceptable intensity e.g. between 100-200 gray<br>
5     levels and if it covers 80% of the iris pattern zone, then the mold would pass.<br>
The accuracy of the inspection could be improved by more specifically defining<br>
intensity ranges at several different levels and the expected number of pixels<br>
within each range. As the pixels falling within the individual ranges and outside<br>
all the ranges are encountered they can be added to a record in the database<br>
10     that sums the pixels for the various ranges, and when the analysis is complete<br>
the individual totals for the individual ranges can be compared to the expected<br>
number for each of those ranges. If the pixels counted within each intensity<br>
range differ from the expected number of pixels and allowing for a small error<br>
margin that were mathematically calculated based an the expected pattern,<br>
15     then the mold is passed.  If not the mold is rejected.<br>
Alternatively, the pixels can be snalyzod using the modified eight-<br>
neighbor method that skips every other pixel during its analysis to look for<br>
intensities within the zone. The modified eight-neighbor method is described in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,732.<br>
20                Alternately, index marks can be introduced into the pattern to allow for<br>
easy recognition of the rotational position and displacement of each colorant<br>
layer.  Commercially available pattern recognition software could be adapted to<br>
locate the index mark and to measure the angle and displacement between<br>
each of the index marks.  This technique would then provide a means to<br>
25     compare the relative position of the different colorant layers that does not rely<br>
on finding the center of an individual colorant layer.   Note that these index<br>
marks would not be so obvious as to detract from the cosmetic appearance of<br>
the lens, but would be easily recognized by a pattern recognition system. The<br>
index marks can be lines or clusters of dots that differ from the rest of the<br>
30 pattern in the colorant lavers, but that cannot be fully covered by the colorant<br>
pattern of another layer when property applied. Alternatively the index marks<br>
could be added to the colorant layers in areas of those layers that are not<br>

expected to overlap.  If the index mark or pattern could not be located on the<br>
ophthalmic part the part would be relected.<br>
Another optional step in the method of inspection includes determining<br>
the rotation of the colorant layers. Rotation of a colorant layer's pattern can be<br>
5     determined relative to the taught image. This is accomplished by comparing<br>
the angular position of one or more features in the pattern. The angle between<br>
a feature on the outer edge of the taught image and the corresponding feature<br>
on the captured image yields the amount of rotation.  The algorithm can<br>
provide for multiple features or for the ability to repeat the search if an attempt<br>
10     to find a feature is unsuccessful such as in the case of distortion of the applied<br>
colorant or a missing area of pattern on the captured image. The amount of<br>
rotation of the pattern is the angular difference between the expected or<br>
desired position of the feature in the taught image and the location of the<br>
feature in the captured image and can be averaged if multiple individual angle<br>
15     measurements are measured. For example if the tip of a 'feather" in the<br>
feather layer is supposed to be located at the zero degree position, in fine with<br>
the tab on the mold, and it is located in the pixel image at the one degree<br>
position instead, then the pattern was rotated by the pad printing process by<br>
one degree. In some embodiments of tinted lens designs, the rotation of a<br>
20     pattern may be very important if multiple colorant layers must be applied in<br>
exact angular positions to achieve a desired cosmetic effect.<br>
The methods and associated apparatuses and systems, provide a multi-<br>
step process of analyzing the colorant on an ophthalmic part; however, the<br>
steps can be done individually or in any order depending upon the<br>
35      characteristics of the ophthalmic part to be inspected or the requirements of<br>
the manufacturer. If it is only important that concentricity of the patterns be<br>
checked, then that step can be done alone. If it is only important that the<br>
optical area be free of stray colorant and/or of a uniform intensity of colorant<br>
then that step can be done alone. However, if it is imperative that every pixel<br>
30      be analyzed to make sure that it matches the expected pattern, then that can<br>
be done also. Additionally the sensitivity of the system to the pixel intensity<br>
variations can be adjusted as desired, and can vary from high sensitivity, for<br>

Embodiments of the method invention are described in further detail in the<br>
following steps:<br>
Method of Inspecting a Mold for an Opaque Lens:<br>
1.        Capture the image with a color or gray-level camera<br>
10     2.        Image is divided into RGB layers from the 3 chips of the color camera<br>
3.        Check for Proper Registration (centered locations) of the Image:<br>
3.1      Find the knife-edge of the mold. This is the dark, narrow outer circle in<br>
the image of the plastic curve. It is not part of the print. Locate the center of<br>
the knife edge.<br>
15     3.2     Scan left to right and tip and down (grid pattern) to find the patterns in<br>
the opaque image.<br>
3.3      Separate the full Image (all 3 layers of color) into in divide layers<br>
3.4      Locate the center point of each individual layer<br>
3.5      Locate the clock position of each pattern (i.e. rotation clockwise or<br>
20      counterclockwise when compared to the laught image for each layer).<br>
3.6      Compare the position of the center point of the feather layer to the knife<br>
edge center.  Likewise, compare the center point of the enhancer and striae<br>
layer to the center point of the knife edge. This is the concentricity<br>
measurement.<br>
25     3.7      Compare the concentricity for the feather layer to the allowable<br>
concentricity.<br>
3.8      If the concentricity is less than or equal to the allowable value, accept<br>
the image for this test and proceed with processing.  If concentricity is above<br>
this value, reject the image.  In addition, the relative center distance between<br>
30     the feather and the striae layer and between the feather and the foundation<br>
layer may be calculated.  This may be compared to an allowable value and<br>
accepted or rejected accordingly.<br>

4.1       Identify possible defect areas. For the optical zone, the central 4mm of<br>
the image, identify pixels with excess color.<br>
4.2      Calculate the Minimum Defect Size of possible defect areas. Through<br>
the calibration process, the size of each pixel is calculated using a known<br>
5 standard that is presented to the camera. Using the known number of mm per<br>
pixel, calculate the area of each possible defect area that was found in the step<br>
above.<br>
4.3      Compare this area to the allowable Defect area = 4 square mm.  If the<br>
area of each possible defect is greater than or equal to the Minimum Defect<br>
10     Size, for the area is considered a detect.<br>
4.4      Take the sum of all of the defect areas above and compare them to the<br>
Defect Size Threshold.  If this sum is greater than or equal to this Threshold,<br>
the lens mold is rejected.<br>
4.5      Calculation for each of the areas shown in Fig. 5 continues in the same<br>
15     way as described above for Optical Zone Excess. These calculations include:<br>
4.6      Iris Pattern Zone — excess color and absence of color including special<br>
regions:<br>
4.6.1.1           Inner Buffer zone - (an annulus of approximately .1 mm on the<br>
outer edge of the iris pattern zone) - excess color and absence of color.<br>
20     4.6.1.2           Outer Suffer zone - (an annulus of approximately .5 mm on the<br>
inner edge of the Iris pattern zone) - excess color and absence of color.<br>
4.7      Knife Edge Zone — (the area between the outside of the pattern and the<br>
knife edge) - excess color.<br>
5         The calculations are completed and compared to the allowable levels,<br>
25     images with values that are not within the allowable levels are rejected.<br>
Processing may be discontinued after any of the calculations yield a rejection.<br>
Alternatively, at calculations can be completed to give an overall report to assist<br>
troubleshooting.<br>
Diagnostic Prints for Opague Lens Molds:<br>

Figure 12 illustrates an example of image of a diagnostic opaque lens<br>
mold. The area which defines the optical zone is represented by the dashed<br>
line 901.  Excess colorant in the optical zone, 902 is shown and if the area of<br>
excess color is greaterman 0.06 mm2, the lens mold will be rejected.   The<br>
10     center of the reference means, 909 is calculated from the knife edge of the<br>
image, 911. The colorant center is 910, and if the difference, 908, between the<br>
canter of the reference means and the colorant center, 909 is greater is than<br>
0.55 mm the lens mold will be rejected. Excess colorant near the diagnostic<br>
letters, 900, is shown and if the square area of such colorant is greater than<br>
15     0.01 mm2 the lens mold will be rejected. Any voids appear in the diagnostic<br>
letters, 907, if the area of the voids is greater than 0.035 mm2, the lens mold<br>
will be rejected.  If the overlap between the diagnostic lettering and the<br>
beginning of the chopped is pattern is greater than 0.15 mm (906), the lens<br>
mold will be rejected. Excess colorant in the area outside of the iris pattern,<br>
20     905, is shown and if that area if greater than 0.4 mm2 the lens mold will be<br>
rejected. Avoid inside the iris pattern, 903 is shown, if this void has an area<br>

standard that is presented to the camera. Using the known number of mm per<br>
pixel, calculate the area of each possible defect area that was found in the step<br>
15     above.<br>
4.3     Compare this area to the allowable area (Optical Zone. Excess,<br>
Minimum Defect Size ). If the area of each possible defect is greater than or<br>
equal to the Minimum Defect Size, the area is considered a defect.<br>
