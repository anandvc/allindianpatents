R1, R2, R3 and RA are each independently H, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, substituted aralkyl or R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 5 or 6 membered ring; It is preferred that the dye of Formula (1) has at least as many carboxy groups as sulpho groups.<br>
Each of the groups Ar1 and Ar2 is preferably naphthyl or phenyl, especially phenyl which may carry further substituents in addition to the two carboxy groups.  The additional substituents are preferably selected from alkyl, especially C1-4-alkyl; alkoxy, especially C1-4-alkoxy; -SO3H; -PO3H2; -COSH; -OH; -CO2H; halogen, especially Cl or Br; and optionally substituted C1-4-alkyl.  However, it is preferred that each of Ar1 and Ar2 carries only two carboxy groups, and is more preferably dicarboxyphenyl, such as 2,A-dicarboxyphenyl, 2,3-dicarbcxy-phenyl, 3,A-dicarboxyphenyl, and especially 3,5-dicarboxyphenyl.  It is also preferred that Ar1 and Ar2 are identical.<br>
It is preferred that the chromophores Ar1N=N-J- and Ar2N=N-J- are identical or similar so that they absorb light at approximately the same wavelength.<br>
The variable -S03H group in each J, which may be meta- or para- with respect to the NH group, is preferably in the meta-position, so that J is the divalent residue of H-acid.<br>
Examples of the alkyl, alkoxy and alkenyl groups represented by T , T2, T3 and TA in the divalent group L are methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, iso-butoxy, t-butoxy and allyl.  In the group of Formula (3a), T1 and T2 are preferably identical more preferably C1-4-alkyl and, especially, each is methyl, so that L is especially 2,5-dimethylphen-l,4-ylene-diamino.

Where Z is alkyl or alkoxy these preferably contain from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Where at least one Z is halogen, the compound of Formula (1) may be reactive with cellulose under appropriate temperature and pH conditions. However, this does not appear to contribute to the wet-fastness of the compound when applied to a paper substrate under the normal conditions used in ink jet printing and compounds in which Z is not a cellulose reactive group have been found to give equally wet-fast prints on paper to those in which Z is a cellulose reactive group.<br>
Each of R1, R2, R3 and RA independently is preferably<br>
selected from H, C1-10-alkyl especially C1-4-alkyl, substituted C1-10-alky! especially substituted C1-4-alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, (CH2)1-4-phenyl and substituted (CH2)1-4-phenyl especially benzyl and substituted benzyl.

When R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen radical to which they are attached form a 5- or 6-membered ring, this is preferably morpholine, piperidine or piperazine especially the latter in which the free ring N-atom may be, and preferably is, substituted by a C1-4-alkyl or hydroxy-C2-4-alkyl group.<br>
The present invention relates not only to a compound of Formula (1) in the free acid form, but also to a salt thereof, especially an alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium salt. Although Formulae (4), (5) and (6) are represented in neutral form, the present invention also covers quaternised forms thereof, particularly where the compound of Formula (1) is in zwitterionic form.<br>
1<br><br>
Especially preferred compounds of the present invention are those of Formula (1) in the form of ammonium, methylammonium or dimethylammonium salts in which Ar1 and Ar2 are both 3,5-dicarboxy-phenyl; each J is of Formula (2) in which the sulpho groups are in the 3,6-positions; each X is of Formula (4) in which Z is Cl, NR!R2 or OR3 and L is 2,5-dimethylphen-l,4-ylenediamino, 2-methylpiperazin-l,4-ylene or 2,5-dimethylpiperazin-l,4-ylene.  In such a compound of Formula (1) it is especially preferred that Z is halogen, especially Cl; OH; C1-4-alkoxy, especially methoxy; hydroxy-C2-4-alkylamino, especially 2-hydroxyethylamino; morpholin-1-yl; piperidin-1-yl, piperazin-1-yl, 4-(C1-4-alkyl)piperazin-l-yl and 4-(hydroxy-C2-4-alkyl)-piperazin-1-yl.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of Formula (1) comprising (i)        diazotisation of amines Ar1NH2 and Ar2NH2 with a diazotising<br>
agent such as HN02, in the cold and preferably below 5°C to<br>
give the corresponding diazonium salts; (ii)       condensation of HJH with a compound halo-X-halo, preferably<br>
cyanuric chloride, preferably in the presence of base, to<br>
give a compound, HJ-X-halo, in which X is as defined above<br>
except that Z is Cl; (iii)      coupling each of the diazonium salts from (i) above with an<br>
equivalent of a compound, HJ-X-halo to give compounds,<br>
Ar!N=N-J-X-halo and Ar2N=N-J-X-halo, in which each X is the<br>
same or different to each other and in which each X is as<br>
defined above except that Z is Cl; (iv)       the products from (iii) are each condensed with a diamine,<br>
H-L-H; (v)        optionally condensing the product from (iv) with a compound,<br>
ZH, preferably in the presence of base;<br>
wherein Ar1, Ar2, J, X, L and Z are as defined above unless otherwise stated.<br>
Examples of amines, Ar1NH2 and Ar2NH2, which may be used in the preparation of compounds of Formula (1), are, 2-aminoisophthalic acid, 4-aminoisophthalic acid, 5-aminoisophthalic acid, 3-aminophthalic acid, 4-aminophthalic acid and 2-aminoterephthalic acid.<br><br><br>
The divalent group J may be derived from H-acid or K-acid, but preferably from the former. The two groups represented by J may be the same or different.<br>
Each group X is preferably derived from cyanuric chloride and the free halogen atom in the group of formula (4), may be subsequently replaced with a different group, Z.<br>
A compound of Formula (1) is suitable for use as a colorant especially for cellulosic substrates and gives a good strong magenta shade on paper and related cellulosic substrates, especially those having a surface pH below 7, with especially good light- and wet-fastness properties.  However some of the present compounds have been found to give prints having a high water-fastness on substrates with a surface pH of 7 or above.  For example, the dye of Example 5 gives a high wet-fast print on an alkaline paper (Xerox Hammermill 4DP).  The brightness of shade, and often the wet-fastness, of a print on paper of a compound of Formula (1) is significantly better than that given by an equivalent of the compound of Formula (1) in which the group L is replaced by a different phen-1,4-ylene-diamino or piperazin-l,4-ylene group not containing an alkyl, alkoxy or alkenyl group in one or both of the 2- and 5-positions.<br>
The compounds of Formula (1) are especially useful as<br>
colorants in inks, especially aqueous inks, used in ink jet printing and particularly thermal ink jet printing and according to a further feature of the present invention there is provided an ink, especially an ink jet printing ink, comprising a compound of Formula (1) (hereinafter referred to as the colorant) in a liquid medium.<br>
The water fastness of the colorant on paper is increased if it is printed from an aqueous medium in the form of an ammonium or substituted ammonium salt, especially such a salt derivable from ammonia or a. volatile amine.  Preferred volatile amines have a vapour pressure of less than 60mm Hg, more preferably less than 20mm Hg, at 20°C and atmospheric pressure.  Examples of preferred volatile amines include methylamine, dimethylamine, diethylamine, methylethylamine, propylamine and isopropylamine.<br>
Preferred alkali metal salts are the sodium, potassium and lithium salts, and mixtures thereof with NH4+ or other substituted ammonium ions derivable from the volatile amines.<br><br>
The substituted ammonium salt may contain a cation of the formula +NQ4 in which each Q independently is an organic radical, or two or three Qs together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring and all remaining Qs are selected from C1-4-alkyl.  Preferred organic radicals represented by Q are C1-4-alkyl radicals, especially methyl radicals. Preferred heterocyclic rings formed by NQ4 are 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic rings.<br>
As examples of substituted ammonium cations of formula +NQ4 there may be mentioned N+(CH3)4, N+(CH2CH3)4, N-methylpyridinium, N,N-dimethylpiperidinium and N,N-dimethylmorpholinium.<br>
Preferably the substituted ammonium salt contains a cation of the formula +NHG3 wherein each G independently is H or C1-4-alkyl provided at least one G is C1-4-alkyl, or two or three groups represented by G together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 5- or 6-membered ring, especially a pyridine, piperidine or morpholine ring.  It is preferred that the substituted ammonium cation is derived from a preferred volatile amine as hereinbefore defined.<br>
As examples of substituted ammonium cations of formula +NHG; there may be mentioned (CH3)3N+H, (CH3)2N+H2, H2N+(CH3)(CH2CH3), CH3N+H3, CH3CH2N+H3, HZN+(CH2CH3)2, CH3CH2CH2N+H3, CH3CH2CH2N+H3, (CH3)2CHN%, isopropylammonium, pyridinium, piperidinium and morpholinium.  Examples of amines used to form such salts include methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, ethylamine, n-propylamine, iso-propylamine, n-butylamine, iso-butylamine, sec-butylamine, tert-butylamine, piperidine, pyridine, morpholine, allylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine and mixtures thereof.  It is not essential that the colorants are completely in the form of the ammonium or substituted ammonium salt and mixed alkali metal and either ammonium or substituted ammonium salts are effective, especially those in which at least 501 of the cations are ammonium or substituted ammonium ions.<br>
If the natural pH value of the paper surface is<br>
significantly above pH 6, this can be adjusted downwards, by the addition to the ink of a salt of an acid with a volatile base, such as ammonia.  When the ink dries the base evaporates to leave the free acid which will lower the pH of the paper surface in the region of the dye. To minimise damage to the paper it is preferred to use a weak acid, such as acetic acid.<br>
7<br><br>
Suitable ink jet printing inks generally contain from 0.5Z to 202 preferably from II to 102 and especially from 12 to 62 by weight of the colorant and are generally maintained at a pH from 5 to 9, especially from 6 to 8 which favours solubility of the colorant in the solvent medium while minimising attack upon the print head or pen.<br>
Suitable liquid media include water alone and mixtures of water with various water-soluble or water-miscible organic solvents.<br>
The liquid medium is preferably water or an aqueous medium comprising a mixture of water and one or more water-soluble organic solvents, preferably in a weight ratio of water to the solvent(s) from 99:1 to 1:99, more preferably from 95:5 to 50:50 and especially from 90:10 to 60:40.<br>
The water-soluble organic solvent is preferably a C1-4-alkanol such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol or isobutanol;  an amide such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide;  an ester such as diacetine;  a ketone or ketoalcohol such as acetonemethylethylketone, methylisobutyl ketone or diacetone alcohol;  an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane;  a polyalkylene glycol such as polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol preferably having molecular weights up to 1000 and especially from 100 to 500 such as diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol; an alkylene glycol containing 2 to 6 carbon atoms such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butan-l,4-diol, pentan-1,5-diol and hexan-l,6-diol; a polyol such as glycerol or 1,2,6-hexanetriol;  a lower alkyl ether of a polyhydric alcohol such as 2-methoxyethanol, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol, 2-[2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)ethoxy]ethanol or 2-[2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxy]-ethanol; a heterocyclic ketone such as 2-pyrrolidone or N-methylpyrrolidone.  In all the above solvents the oxygen atoms may be replaced by sulphur atoms where thio equivalents exist.  The liquid medium preferably contains from 1 to 5 water-soluble organic solvents, more preferably 1, 2 or 3 such solvents.<br>
Preferred water-soluble organic solvents are selected from lactams, especially 2-pyrrolidone and N-methylpyrrolidone; alkylene glycols or lower alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols especially ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol and especially 2-methoxy-2-ethoxy-2-ethoxyethanol; and polyethylene glycols having a<br><br>
molecular weight of up to 500. A preferred specific solvent mixture is a binary mixture of water and either diethylene glycol, 2-pyrrolidone or N-methylpyrrolidone in a weight ratio as mentioned above.<br>
The ink jet printing ink may also contain one or more of the following other ingredients<br>
(a)	a kogation reducing agent to prevent or inhibit the build up<br>
of residues (koga) on the resistor surfaces of thermal ink<br>
jet printers, and<br>
(b)	a buffer, such as sodium borate, to stabilise the pH of the<br>
ink.<br>
The kogation-reducing agent is preferably an oxo anion, such as described in EP 425150A.  The oxo-anion may be C2O42", SO32', SO42", molybdate, AsO43' or more preferably a phosphate ester, a diorganophosphate or more especially a phosphate salt which is particularly effective in reducing kogation. As examples of phosphate salts there may be mentioned dibasic phosphates (HP042~), monobasic<br>
phosphates (H2P04'   .  ,  ,   .     „ „ 4    „,,    ,   .    ,-   •<br>
L   ) and polyphosphates (P2O7*~).  The selection of counter<br>
ion is not believed to be critical and examples include alkali metals, ammonium and aIkylammonium cations.  The kogation-reducing agent is preferably present in the ink at a concentration from 0.001Z to 15Z, based on oxo-anion, and more preferably from 0.012 to 1Z (by weight).<br>
The ink preferably contains less than 5Z, more preferably less than 21, especially less than II inorganic salts, e.g. NaCl, KC1 and NaN03, in order to enhance solubility of the colorant in the liquid medium and reduce the tendency to deposition of solids in the jets of an ink jet printer.  If the colorant contains significant amounts of inorganic salts these may be reduced to a desired level by treating an aqueous solution or suspension of the colorant with a membrane separation process, such as reverse osmosis.<br>
An ink containing the colorant as sole colour material is useful as a component of a range of 3 or 4 primary printing inks (yellow, magenta, cyan and black) for use in trichromatic printing. However, the ink may also contain other coloured materials, especially wet-fast water-soluble coloured materials in addition to the colorant.<br>
The invention also provides a process for ink jet printing a substrate with an ink characterised in that the ink contains a compound<br><br>
of formula (1) or is as hereinbefore defined.  The preferred substrate is a paper.<br>
