				<td>COOKING VESSEL WITH HANDLE<br>
Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a cooking vessel with a<br>
handle, in particular a pot or a pan with a handle, the<br>
grip region of said handle being made of metal, the<br>
handle having at least a first substantially metallic<br>
fastening portion for fastening to the cooking vessel,<br>
a transition portion and a substantially metallic grip<br>
portion, the transition portion having in cross section<br>
a metal cross section which is reduced compared to the<br>
adjacent portions.<br>
Prior art<br>
The prior art discloses a number of cooking vessels of<br>
this type with grips, in which there is a zone of<br>
transition to the cooking vessel itself, which zone<br>
serves as a thermal brake. FR 2,730,399 discloses a<br>
grip of this type consisting of a one-piece, flat,<br>
horizontally arranged metallic element in which there<br>
are arranged, in a region close to the cooking vessel,<br>
holes which locally reduce the metallically heat-<br>
conductive cross section and thus cause the grip region<br>
which is more remote from the cooking vessel to heat up<br>
less intensively for the user.<br>
US 5,121,848 discloses a pan with a metallic handle<br>
consisting of a single punched element which is bent<br>
over at its center and thus forms two hollow half-<br>
shells for the grip region. In the region close to the<br>
cooking vessel, the two ends of the handle, which are<br>
connected to the cooking vessel, are perpendicular to<br>
the bottom plane of the vessel and thus form between<br>
them a conduit through which, for example, hot air<br>
rising up the pan can ascend.<br><br>
DE 92 11 465 U1 discloses a cooking vessel in which<br>
slots, which allow the passage of warm air rising up<br>
the pot, are provided in the edge region adjoining the<br>
handle.<br>
The devices according to the prior art are all intended<br>
to facilitate the passage of warm air and gases rising<br>
up the cooking vessel, so said warm air and gases do<br>
not excessively heat the handle.<br>
Some of these are very simple designs which are awkward<br>
for the user to handle. In addition, the provision of<br>
the various conduits leads to a weakening of the<br>
subsequent grip region and thus, in particular in the<br>
case of filled relatively large pots or pans, to<br>
instabilities of the handle, especially when used for a<br>
relatively long period of time.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Starting from this prior art, the invention is based on<br>
the object of disclosing a cooking vessel which has an<br>
improved handle and in which the abovementioned<br>
drawbacks of the prior art are avoided. The term<br>
"cooking vessel" includes without limitation pans,<br>
high-sided frying pans, casseroles, pots, etc. -<br>
ultimately all kitchen appliances which can be placed<br>
on a hotplate or heating surface in a kitchen,<br>
irrespective of whether the heat is generated by<br>
induction, heating coils or gas flames.<br>
This object is achieved by a cooking vessel with an<br>
improved handle according to the features of Claim 1 in<br>
that the transition portion respectively consists<br>
either of a metal portion, which is integrally<br>
connected to the adjacent portions, and a thermal<br>
barrier or exclusively of a thermal barrier, the<br>
thermal barriers being connected to the adjacent<br>
adjoining metal portions in an interlocking or force-<br>
transmitting manner.<br><br>
The thermal barrier thus allows reduced conduction of<br>
heat into the grip region without reducing the<br>
stability of the handle.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments are characterized in<br>
the sub-claims.<br>

Detailed description of the exemplary embodiments<br>
Figure 1 shows a handle 10 for a cooking vessel (not<br>
shown in the drawings) according to a first exemplary<br>
embodiment of the invention. The handle 10 is, for<br>
example, U-shaped and is fastened at its two free ends<br>
11 to a cooking vessel. It can however also be L-shaped<br>
and have just one free end 11 for fastening to a<br>
cooking vessel. The fastening to the cooking vessel by,<br>
for example, projection welding is preferably carried<br>
out after fitting of the handle according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Advantageously, this one-piece handle 10 is made of<br>
metal and is hollow, it is manufactured from a tube or<br>
a sheet metal part, or it is manufactured from solid<br>
material by, for example, forging or casting. Both free<br>
ends 11 can have a respective fastening region 12 which<br>
is adjoined by a transition region 13 according to the<br>
invention and finally the actual first portion of the<br>
handle region 14. The regions 12 and 13 are in this<br>
case arranged respectively parallel to one another in<br>
relation to their longitudinal axis on both sides and<br>
are perpendicular to the actual handle region 15. The<br>
handle region 15 has a length which allows a user<br>
conveniently to grasp by hand the region 15, including<br>
a pot cloth or similar aid gripped beforehand by the<br>
user.<br>
The portion 14 is advantageously oriented in alignment<br>
with the portions 12 and 13, although it can also be<br>
very short in its configuration, provided that it (see<br><br>
below) is sufficient to receive the protruding length<br>
of the locking pin 95. The portion 12 is fastened to<br>
the pot, as an example of a cooking vessel, and is<br>
conventionally oriented in this case not directly<br>
radially to the. center of the pot. The deviation from<br>
the radial orientation depends on the length of the<br>
grip region 15 and the size of the cooking vessel.<br>
Crucial for simple utilization of a handle 10 of this<br>
type with two free ends or one free end 11 is the<br>
tangential orientation of the grip region 15.<br>
In the case of a handle for a pan, it is often<br>
desirable to have just a single rod-shaped handle, the<br>
grip portion 15 being oriented radially. All portions<br>
12, 13 and 14 are then oriented preferably radially to<br>
the grip portion 15.<br>
In the case of a hollow handle 10, the metal sleeve<br>
forming said handle can have in cross section a metal<br>
thickness in the jacket of between 1/20 and 1/8 of the<br>
total diameter of the handle 10. In the transition<br>
region 13, a partial region of the jacket material of<br>
the handle 10 is omitted and thus forms a lateral<br>
opening 19 which is arranged relative to a remaining<br>
metal region 23. In the embodiment illustrated in<br>
Figure 1, this is the respectively inwardly directed<br>
half of the handle. Upper and lower jacket rims 16 are<br>
thus formed in the upper and lower region of the<br>
transition region 13. Preferably, the omitted regions<br>
have not been removed in the case of a hollow grip of<br>
the transition region 13 but rather have been bent over<br>
inward to form the closure regions 17 at the opposing<br>
ends of the transition region 13. The closure regions<br>
17 cover in each case advantageously the total cross<br>
section of the handle 10 relative to the adjoining<br>
regions 12 and 14. A bore 18 is provided in the<br>
transition regions 17 in each case approximately<br>
centrally, i.e. in alignment with the longitudinal axis<br>
of the portions 12 and 14.<br><br>
Inserted into the lateral opening 19 which results from<br>
the omitted region and is in this case 50 % of the<br>
jacket, but can also be between 1/3 and 2/3 of the<br>
total metal surface area, is a ceramic piece 90 which<br>
advantageously has an outer jacket surface 91<br>
corresponding substantially to the omitted jacket<br>
surface of the transition region 13, thus forming<br>
between the regions 12, 13 and 14 a smooth surface such<br>
as may be seen in the left-hand side of the image of<br>
Fig. 1.<br>
The ceramic piece 90 has, on its inwardly directed<br>
side, a contour surface 92 which advantageously fills<br>
said cavity of the opening 19 in the omitted transition<br>
region 13. The upper and lower rims 93 of the ceramic<br>
piece 90 thus rest on the rims 16 of the metal sleeve<br>
of the transition region 13 so as to close them off in<br>
an interlocking manner. The four corner rims of the<br>
ceramic piece 90 can be beveled in order to abut<br>
corresponding corner rims 21 on the upper or lower<br>
jacket rims 16.<br>
The ceramic piece 90 can be fastened in the socket of<br>
the opening 19 by bonding or by soldering. A suitable<br>
adhesive must, like the material of the piece 90,<br>
likewise withstand elevated temperatures, for example<br>
temperatures of at least 250 degrees Celsius and<br>
advantageously up to 300 degrees Celsius. According to<br>
the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the ceramic piece<br>
90, which is otherwise made of a solid material, is<br>
however provided with a through-bore 94 which is<br>
oriented in alignment with the hole 18 in the closure<br>
surface 17, thus allowing a locking pin 95 to be<br>
inserted from the free end 11 of the handle 10 through<br>
these holes and bores 18 and 94. The locking pin 95 is<br>
in this case advantageously an elongate spring washer<br>
which, in its compressed state, is inserted through the<br><br>
bores 18 and 94 in order then in the relaxed state to<br>
hold the ceramic piece 90 securely in the handle 10.<br>
After this production step, the handle 10 is then<br>
fastened to the cooking vessel in a known manner, for<br>
example by welding.<br>
Instead of the ceramic piece 90, a plastics material<br>
piece can also be used in all exemplary embodiments of<br>
the invention, a plastics material which withstands<br>
high temperatures, for example temperatures of 250 or<br>
even 300 degrees Celsius, being selected.<br>
Figure 2 shows a handle 20 for a cooking vessel<br>
according to a second exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention. Identical and similar features are in all<br>
figures denoted in the various exemplary embodiments by<br>
the same reference numerals. The handle 20 has, in this<br>
case too, the three successive regions 12, 13 and 14 at<br>
the free ends 11. In contrast to the first exemplary<br>
embodiment, the metal material which ultimately forms<br>
the opening 19 is in this case however completely<br>
punched out or omitted in the transition region 13,<br>
thus forming lateral jacket surfaces 26 to the left and<br>
right next to the upper and lower jacket rims 16. The<br>
regions of transition between the rim surfaces 16 and<br>
26 are also approximated by transition rims 27 so as to<br>
avoid an acute angle in the corners. Instead of the<br>
rims 27 in the form of a polygonal course consisting of<br>
three regions, transition regions 27 which are rounded<br>
or elliptical in shape can also be provided.<br>
The ceramic piece 80 to be used in this case has, like<br>
the ceramic piece 90 in the first exemplary embodiment,<br>
an outer jacket surface 91 which, in interplay with the<br>
recess 19, allows complete outward closure of the<br>
transition region 13. Accordingly, rim regions 81 are<br>
configured at this location to form with the rims 27<br>
the closure in the corners. A groove 82 is provided on<br><br>
the inner side relative to the handle 20 to receive a<br>
holding clip 85. The remainder of the back of the<br>
ceramic piece 80 is in this case configured so as to be<br>
not fully complementary to the remainder of the jacket<br>
region of the transition region 13. There is however at<br>
the upper and lower end of the ceramic piece 80 a<br>
protruding projection 83 which respectively engages<br>
below the rims 16 with the cavity of the opening 19.<br>
During fitting, the holding clip 85, which has the<br>
function of a clasp, is inserted from the free end 11<br>
into the fastening portion 12 and braced in the regions<br>
12	and 14 by the lateral side arm regions 86 following<br>
the inner and outer shape of the portions 12 and 14.<br>
The longitudinal clip arm 87, which extends parallel to<br>
the main axis of the regions 12, 13 and 14, is in this<br>
case arranged in the cavity 19 in such a way that the<br>
groove 82 in the ceramic piece 80 can be clipped into<br>
this cavity to ensure a connection, which is held with<br>
prestressing, between the ceramic piece 80 and handle<br>
20.<br>
Figure 3 shows the exemplary embodiment of Figure 2 now<br>
in a fitted state, the inner elements being indicated<br>
by broken lines. As may clearly be seen, a respective<br>
partial region 83 of the ceramic insert piece 80 is<br>
arranged below the jacket in the transition region 13<br>
and thus forms a further sealing closure. In this case,<br>
the jacket surface 91 of the ceramic piece 80 is<br>
configured in such a way that parts of the upper and<br>
lower jacket rims 16 and parts of the lateral jacket<br>
surfaces 26 protrude, i.e. the jacket surface 91 is not<br>
configured flush with the surface of the portions 12,<br>
13 and 14, but is rather slightly set back.<br>
Figure 4 shows a third exemplary embodiment of a handle<br>
30 according to the teaching of the invention. In this<br>
case, the transition region 13 is formed as a result of<br>
the fact that an end piece 31 of the third handle 30<br><br>
has been separated from the remaining handle and is<br>
thus, in particular, cut off from the region 14. A<br>
hollow tube may in this case have been split<br>
accordingly. It may however also, as in the exemplary<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 4, have been<br>
manufactured separately and in particular from solid<br>
material. In this respect, the transition region 13 in<br>
the handle 30 according to Figure 4 consists<br>
exclusively of a ceramic piece 70. This ceramic piece<br>
70 is in this case configured in a somewhat smaller<br>
diameter than the adjacent portions 12 and 14, so a<br>
small edge 36 protrudes peripherally on both sides<br>
relative to the portions 12 and 14.<br>
The ceramic piece 70 can however also be configured<br>
flush with the handle. The two regions 12 and 14 are<br>
advantageously configured with a closure lid 37 which<br>
closes them and in each case advantageously has a bore<br>
38 in its central orientation and longitudinal<br>
orientation. The ceramic piece 70 itself likewise has a<br>
central bore 74.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 4,<br>
the end region 31 is made not of a thin metal sheet but<br>
rather of solid material in which a cylindrical bore 32<br>
is formed. Through this bore, which has a narrowing<br>
step, corresponding to the diameter of the bore 33, in<br>
the ceramic part 70 can be inserted from the free end<br>
region 11 a screw 75 (in this case with a hexagon<br>
socket) which screws the part 31, the ceramic part 70<br>
and the remainder of the handle 30 in the bore 33 if a<br>
corresponding thread is provided at this location in<br>
the portion 14.<br>
Finally, Figure 5 shows a handle 40 for a cooking<br>
vessel in a fitted state according to a fourth<br>
exemplary embodiment of the invention. The construction<br>
of the ceramic piece 6 0 corresponds to that of the<br>
first exemplary embodiment. As may clearly be seen, the<br><br>
respective rims 93 of the ceramic insert piece 60 are<br>
in this case arranged symmetrically relative to the<br>
underside of the handle 40, so the insert piece 60 is<br>
oriented downward. The remaining jacket 43 of the<br>
handle 15 in the transition region 13 is arranged<br>
oriented upward and thus forms a conductive region<br>
which is exposed still less to the heat. In this case,<br>
the jacket surface of the ceramic piece 60 is<br>
configured in such a way that the ceramic piece covers<br>
all of the lower surface of the handle 40; in cross<br>
section (not shown), this corresponds to 180 degrees.<br>
For the remainder of the jacket, this angular coverage<br>
leads to a substantially identical angle of coverage of<br>
180 degrees. The ceramic or plastics material piece can<br>
also take up a smaller angle which can be, for example,<br>
up to at least 120 degrees (advantageously plus/minus<br>
60 degrees with respect to the horizontal plane in the<br>
exemplary embodiments according to Fig. 1 to 3 and with<br>
respect to the vertical plane in the exemplary<br>
embodiment according to Fig. 5). Larger angles of up to<br>
270 degrees are also possible.<br>
Figures 6 to 8 are perspective views of a fifth<br>
exemplary embodiment according to the present<br>
invention. Like parts are provided with the same<br>
reference numerals. The fifth exemplary embodiment<br>
comprises substantially a handle 100, a ceramic piece<br>
110 and a spring piece 120.<br>
The handle 100 has an opening 19 which is delimited by<br>
jacket edges 16 and lateral jacket edges 26. The<br>
opening 19 is substantially rectangular in its<br>
configuration. The region in which the jacket edges 16<br>
meet the lateral jacket edges 26 is preferably rounded<br>
in its configuration with a transition region 27. The<br>
handle 100 is hollow in its configuration and has an<br>
inner wall 103. In its free end region, the handle 100<br>
additionally has an insertion opening 102. The ceramic<br>
piece 110 and the spring piece 120 can be inserted into<br><br>
the hollow handle 100 through the insertion opening<br>
102.<br>
The ceramic piece 110 comprises substantially a ceramic<br>
body 113 with a jacket surface 111 having jacket rims<br>
112 and a back 115. The jacket surface 111 corresponds<br>
substantially to the omitted jacket surface of the<br>
transition region 13, thus forming a smooth surface<br>
between the regions 12, 13 and 14 on insertion of the<br>
ceramic piece 110 in the opening 19. The jacket surface<br>
111 is delimited by the jacket rims 112. The form of<br>
the jacket rims 112 is in this case configured so as to<br>
correspond substantially to the contour of the opening<br>
19 which is defined by the jacket edges 16, the lateral<br>
jacket edges 26 and the transition regions 27.<br>
Accordingly, the ceramic piece 110 can be fitted into<br>
the opening 19 in an interlocking manner. As soon as<br>
the ceramic piece 110 has been fitted, it rests with<br>
the stop surface 114 of the ceramic body 113 against<br>
the inner wall 103 of the handle 100. Preferably, the<br>
distance between the stop surface 114 and jacket<br>
surface 111 corresponds to the thickness of the wall of<br>
the handle. Thus, the ceramic piece 110 can be arranged<br>
or fitted in such a way that the jacket surface 111 is<br>
flush with the outer surface of the handle 100.<br>
Figure 8 shows the ceramic piece 110 from behind. The<br>
ceramic piece 110 has on the back 115 receiving<br>
openings 116. The back 115 is arranged relative to the<br>
jacket side 111 on the ceramic body 113. The receiving<br>
openings 116 can receive parts of the spring body 120.<br>
The receiving openings 116 have substantially a<br>
rectangular cross section.<br>
The spring piece 120 has in a central region a basic<br>
element 121 with a spring tab 122 and a respective<br>
spring leg in the two end regions 123 adjoining the<br>
central region. The spring tab 122 and the spring legs<br>
123 protrude from the basic element 121 in differing<br><br>
directions. The spring tab 122 is in this case in the<br>
form of a web protruding from the basic element 121.<br>
The spring legs 123 are configured as bent-over legs<br>
protruding from the basic element. The spring legs 123<br>
engage with the receiving openings 116 in the ceramic<br>
piece 110. The shape of the bend at their ends enables<br>
the spring legs 123 to produce, after compression of<br>
the bend, a spring leg force which is substantially<br>
perpendicular to the spring legs 123.<br>
By means of the spring piece 120, which is arranged<br>
between the inner wall 103 and the ceramic body 113,<br>
the spring tabs 122 produce a spring force which<br>
presses the spring piece 120 with the surface 114<br>
against the inner wall 103 of the handle. In this case,<br>
the spring legs 123 are in engagement with the ceramic<br>
body 110 and the spring tab 122 rests on a region of<br>
the inner wall 103 that opposes the opening 19.<br>
The spring piece 120 is connected in a first step to<br>
the ceramic piece 110. In other words, the spring legs<br>
122 engage with the described receiving openings 116.<br>
The spring leg force ensures that the spring piece 120<br>
cannot become detached from the ceramic piece 110.<br>
Subsequently, the ceramic piece 110 is inserted with<br>
the spring piece 120 into the hollow handle 100 through<br>
the insertion opening 102. As soon as the spring tab<br>
122 has been inserted into the cavity and accordingly<br>
touches the inside 103, this spring tab 122 exerts a<br>
spring force onto the ceramic piece 110 and presses the<br>
ceramic piece with the jacket surface 111 against the<br>
inside 103. The ceramic piece 110 and the spring piece<br>
120 are then pushed further until the jacket rims 112<br>
are congruent with the jacket edges 16, the lateral<br>
jacket edges 26 and the transition regions 27. Then,<br>
the ceramic piece 110 is pressed by the spring piece<br>
120 in the direction of the opening 19 and then engages<br>
in an interlocking manner. As a result of the spring<br>
force which presses the ceramic piece in the direction<br><br>
of the inner wall 103 and as a result of the<br>
interlocking delimitation provided by the jacket edges<br>
16, the lateral jacket edges 26 and by the transition<br>
regions 2 7, the ceramic piece is blocked in the opening<br>
19 in a force-transmitting or an interlocking manner.<br>
All exemplary embodiments have in common the fact that<br>
there is a fastening portion 12 at and by which the<br>
handle 10, 20, 30 or 100 is fastened to a cooking<br>
vessel. This fastening portion 12 can, in particular,<br>
have a length of from 5 to 25 millimeters. As a result,<br>
the thinned or missing metal portion 13 commences<br>
advantageously at a distance of from 5 to 25<br>
millimeters, especially preferably between 10 and 15<br>
millimeters, after a portion 12 close to the cooking<br>
vessel, and heat conduction can be prevented<br>
effectively in the direction of the grip region 15. On<br>
the one hand the thinned or missing metal region in the<br>
portion 13 tends to reduce the conduction of heat from<br>
the cooking vessel itself, on the other hand the hot<br>
air, which is found in particular in gas stoves and<br>
rises at the edge of the pot, or other gases can no<br>
longer heat the handle 10, 20, 30 or 100. Firstly<br>
improved heat insulation is achieved as a result of the<br>
closure of the hollowed-out or omitted intermediate<br>
region 13 by means of a ceramic element 70, 80, 90 or<br>
110, secondly the interlocking fit resulting from this<br>
ceramic element 70, 80, 90 or 110 improves the<br>
stability of the handle and finally this configuration<br>
allows the handle 10, 20, 30 or 100 to be configured in<br>
a hollow design, in particular by shaping a thin metal<br>
sheet, preferably in tubular form, to form a grip<br>
region 15 without the gases rising in proximity to the<br>
edge of the pot being able to infiltrate and directly<br>
heat up this hollow region. The transition portion 13<br>
itself advantageously has a length of from 10 to 30<br>
millimeters, particularly preferably between 15 and 25<br>
millimeters. The jacket surface 91 or 71 in this case<br>
interlocks with the adjacent regions 12 and 14,<br><br>
preferably substantially similarly with only low rim<br>
steps. The remaining metal regions 23 of the portion 13<br>
can, as is illustrated, be configured perpendicularly<br>
and thus be oriented in the main direction of hot gases<br>
flowing past, although they can also be arranged<br>
substantially horizontally, in which case the ceramic<br>
pieces 60 are directed downward counter to the gases<br>
flowing past. In other embodiments not illustrated in<br>
the figures, the heat-insulating pieces 60, 70, 80, 90,<br>
110 are arranged on the respectively outwardly directed<br>
half of the handle, wherein the term "half" is to be<br>
understood in the sense of primarily on this side, as<br>
the angular coverage can, as mentioned above, also be<br>
greater and less than 180 degrees.<br>
The drawings show in each case pot grips 10, 20, 30,<br>
40, 100 with two free ends. It will be clear to a<br>
person skilled in the art that there can also be<br>
configured in this way, for example, pan grips which<br>
have just one free end 11, so there is also only one<br>
respective portion 12, 13 and 14.<br>
The metallic material used for the portions 12, 13, if<br>
present, 14 and 15 is in particular stainless steel,<br>
although further metals used for handles in the kitchen<br>
area are also possible.<br>
The ceramic material used can be all materials having<br>
high thermal stability, such as 250 degrees Celsius,<br>
preferably greater than 300 °C, and low thermal<br>
conductivity, preferably less than 5 Wk-1m-1, such as<br>
for example zirconium oxide, magnesium aluminum<br>
silicate or else glass ceramic.<br>
The portions 12 and 14 are substantially metallic.<br>
Nevertheless, it will be clear to a person skilled in<br>
the art that elements in the portions 12 and 14, in<br>
particular in the grip region 15, made of other heat-<br>
resistant materials, for example of plastics material,<br><br>
do not lead a pot grip of this type out of the scope of<br>
the present invention either. Other substances may also<br>
be used for these thermal barriers, provided that they<br>
withstand temperatures of preferably greater than 300<br>
°C and have low thermal conductivity, preferably in the<br>
range of less than 5 Wk-1m-1<br><br>
