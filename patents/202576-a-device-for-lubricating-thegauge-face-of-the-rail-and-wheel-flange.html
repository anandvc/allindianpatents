				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates 'to a device for lubricating the gauge face of the rail and wheel flange of rolling stock.<br>
More specifically the invention relates to a grease container fixed outside the rail track is connected to a pump for supplying grease and the said grease is pumped by a plunger to an applicator which lubricates the gauge face of the rail and wheel flange when the rolling stock passes over the plunger.<br>
In the prior art only the gauge face of the rail ,could be lubricated manually by gangman and also P &amp; M lubricators are used for lubricating gauge face of the rai1 and wheel flange. The P &amp; M lubricators are directly mounted on the rail by means of nut and bolt by drilling a hole through the rail. The said P &amp; M lubricator becomes loose due to vibration and thus fails to lubricate the gauge face of the rai1 and the wheel flange. It also have the limitation of the length of the rai1 section which is to be lubricated. Moreover, since P &amp; M lubricator is fixed only on straight portion of the rail, it cannot be used on curved section of the rail track. In P &amp; M lubricator, grease conta i ner, pump and app 1 i cat or forms a si nor 1 e un i t and for filling the container with grease, the container has to be removed from the rail. Moreover, the bolt used for fixing the P &amp; M lubricator to the rail has a gap at the centre through which grease flows into the applicator for lubricating the gauge face of .the rail and wheel flange and there is frequent failure of lubrication.<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a lubricating  device  such  that the  grease  container  is  fixed<br>
2<br><br>
outside the rail track to supply grease continuously to a pump.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide multiple pumps and applicators fixed on the rail at intervals connected to a single grease container for greasing the gauge face of the rail and wheel flange simultaneously, whenever a rolling stock passes the said pumps and applicators.<br>
The present invention provides a grease container fixed on concrete foundation outside the track. The container contains grease pressurized by spring pressure. A grease outlet pipe from the container is connected to a pump for supplying grease to the pump. The pump comprising a plunger and a non-return valve is mounted on a base. The said base and an applicator is fixed to the rail by a pair of U-clamps which clamp the base and the applicator by means of clamping bolt and lock nuts. When the plunger is pushed down by the wheel of the rolling stock passing over the plunger, grease in the pump flows out through the grease delivery pipe into the applicator and grease is sprayed on the rail gauge and wheel flange.<br>
The advantage of the present invention is that the lubrication of the gauge face of the rail at the curved section of the rail track is also possible and wastage of grease is minimum. Another advantage is that the base and applicator is fixed to the rail without drilling hole on the rail. Another advantage is that multiple pumps and applicators are provided for lubricating full length of the gauge face of the rail from a single grease container.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided :<br>
A device for lubricating the gauge face of the rail and wheel flange<br>
3<br><br>
comprises:<br>
a container containing pressurized grease, said container is fixed to a concrete foundation outside the rail track ;<br>
a  pump comprising plunger and non-return valve fixed  on  a base ;<br>
an applicator for greasing the rail gauge and wheel flange ;<br>
said base and applicator are fixed to the rail by a pair of U-clamp by means of lock nuts and clamping bolts.<br>
The invention is now described in details with reference to the accompanying drawings :<br>
Fig.l shows a grease container connected to the pump fixed to the rail.<br>
Fig.2 shows the various pumps and applicators fixed on the rax Is connected to a single grease container.<br>
Fig.3 shows the pump arrangement in detail.<br>
Fig.4 shows the pump arrangement when the plunger is pressed down by wheel of the rolling stock.<br>
The container(7) containing grease is provided with a grease inlet(3), a piston(6) attached to a threaded stud(3)/ a stud nut(4) and spring(5). The piston(6) is raised against the spring pressure by rotating the stud nut(4) on the threaded stud(3) and grease is filled into the container(7) through the grease inlet(8) and subsequently the stud nut(4) is released. The spring(5) action on the piston(6) keeps the grease in the container under pressure. The grease container is fixed on the concrete foundation(1) outs ide the rai1 track by nut and bolts(2). The grease container is covered by detachable cover(20) and grease inlet(8) is covered by port cover(21). A pump(13), for<br>
4<br><br>
greasing the gauge face of the rail(15) and wheel flange(24), is fixed to a base(22) and the said base(22) and applicatar(16) is fixed to the rail(15) by a pair of U-clamps(12) which are tightened by lock nuts(ll) and clamping bolts(lO) on the rail wherein said U-clamps run under the rail from outer side of the rail to the inner side of the rail. The grease outlet pipe(9) from the container(7) is 'connected to the pump(13) for supplying grease to the pump(13). The pump comprises a plunger(14) and a non-return valve(25), wherein the plunger projects out of the pump above the rail surface. When the wheel(23) of a rolling stock presses down the plunger(14), the non-return valve(25) is also pressed down and the grease in the pump flows out of the / pump into the applicator(16) through grease delivery pipe(17) and grease is sprayed on the rail gauge and wheel flange(24). As the wheel(23) of the rolling stock crosses the plunger(14), the plunger is released, thereby releasing the non-return valve and back-flow of grease from the applicator is blocked and subsequently the grease from the container is again filled into the pump.<br>
Multiple pumps(13) and applicators(16) are connected to a single grease container(7) by means of grease outlet pipe(9) and these pumps and applicators are fixed at various sections on the rail track.<br>
Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings/ it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modification and adaption of the invention are possible without departure from the spirit and scope of the invention as claimed hereinafter.<br>
