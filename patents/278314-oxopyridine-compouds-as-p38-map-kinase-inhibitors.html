P38 MAP Kinase Inhibitors<br>
This invention relates to a series of amino acid and amino acid ester compounds, to compositions containing them, to processes for their preparation and to their use in medicine as p38 MAP kinase inhibitors for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, atopic dermatitis, graft versus host disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and others.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Inappropriate activation of leukocytes including monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils leading to the production of elevated levels cytokines such as TNF-a, IL1-p and IL-8, is a feature of the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and psoriasis. The production of cytokines by inflammatory cells is a result of response to a variety of external stimuli, leading to the activation of a number of intracellular signalling mechanisms. Prominent amongst these is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily consisting of highly conserved signalling kinases that regulate cell growth, differentiation and stress responses. Mammalian cells contain at least three families of MAPKs: the p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPKs, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 MAPK (also termed p38a/Mpk2/RK/SAPK2a/CSBP1/2). p38 MAPK was first cloned following its identification as a kinase that is tyrosine phosphorylated after stimulation of monocytes by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [Han et al, Science 1994,265,808]. Additional homologues of mammalian p38 have been described and include p38p [Jiang et al, J.Biol.Chem, 1996, 271, 17920], p38y [Li et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1996, 228, 334] and p385 [Jiang et al, J.Biol.Chem. 1997, 272, 30122]. While p38a and p38p are ubiquitously expressed, p38v is restricted primarily to skeletal muscle and p385 is predominantly expressed in lung and kidney.<br>
The release of cytokines by host defence cells and the response of leukocytes to cytokines and other pro-inflammatory stresses are to varying extent regulated by p38 MAPK [Cuenda et al, FEBS Lett, 1995, 364, 229-233]. In other cell types, p38 MAPK<br>
 <br>
controls stress responses such as the production of IL-8 by bronchial epithelial cells stimulated by TNF-a, and the up-regulation of the cell adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in LPS-stimulated endothelial cells. Upon activation, via dual phosphorylation of a TGY motif by the dual specificity kinases MKK3 and MKK6, p38 MAPK exerts its effects through phosphorylation of transcription factors and other kinases. MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2) has been identified as a target for p38 phosphorylation. It has been demonstrated that mice [Kotlyarov et al, Nat. Cell Biol. 1999,1, 94-97] lacking MAPKAP-K2 release reduced levels of TNF-a, IL-1p, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-y in response to LPS/galactosamine mediated endotoxic shock. The regulation of the levels of these cytokines as well as COX-2 is at the mRNA level. TNF-a levels are regulated through translational control via AU-rich elements of the 3'-UTR of TNF-a mRNA, with MAPKAP-K2 signalling increasing TNF-a mRNA translation. MAPKAP-K2 signalling leads to increased mRNA stability for COX-2, IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein. MAPKAP K2 determines the cellular location of p38 MAPK as well as transducing p38 MAPK signalling, possessing a nuclear localisation signal at its carboxyl terminus and a nuclear export signal as part of its autoinhibitory domain [Engel et al, EMBO J. 1998, 17, 3363-3371]. In stressed cells, MAPKAP-K2 and p38 MAPK migrate to the cytoplasm from the nucleus, this migration only occurring when p38 MAPK is catalytically active. It is believed that this event is driven by the exposure of the MAPKAP-K2 nuclear export signal, as a result of phosphorylation by p38 MAPK [Meng et al, J. Biol. Chem. 2002, 277, 37401-37405]. Additionally p38 MAPK either directly or indirectly leads to the phosphorylation of several transcription factors believed to mediate inflammation, including ATF1/2 (activating transcription factors 1/2), CHOP-10/GADD-153 (growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 153), SAP-1 (serum response factor accessory protein-1) and MEF2C (myocyte enhancer factor-2) [Foster et al, Drug News Perspect. 2000, 13, 488-497].<br>
It has been demonstrated in several instances that the inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by small molecules, is useful for the treatment of several disease states mediated by inappropriate cytokine production including rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, asthma and cerebral ischemia. This modality has been the subject of several reviews [Salituro et al, Current Medicinal Chemistry, 1999, 6, 807-823 and Kumar et al, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2003, 2, 717-726].<br>
 <br>
Inhibitors of p38 MAPK have been shown to be efficacious in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, such as collagen-induced arthritis in rat [Revesz et al, Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2000, 10,1261-1364] and adjuvant-induced arthritis in rat [Wadsworth et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1999, 291, 1685-1691]. In murine models of pancreatitis-induced lung injury, pretreatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor reduced TNF-a release in the airways and pulmonary edema [Denham et al, Crit. Care Med., 2000, 29, 628 and Yang et al, Surgery, 1999, 126, 216], Inhibition of p38 MAPK before ovalbumin (OVA) challenge in OVA-sensitized mice decreased cytokine and inflammatory cell accumulation in the airways in an allergic airway model of inflammation, [Underwood et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 2000,293, 281]. Increased activity of p38 MAP kinase has been observed in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease [Waetzig et al, J. Immunol, 2002,168, 5432-5351]. p38 MAPK inhibitors have been shown to be efficacious in rat models of cardiac hypertrophy [Behr et al, Circulation, 2001, 104,1292-1298] and cerebral focal ischemia [Barone et al, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 2001, 296, 312-321].<br>
We have now discovered a group of compounds which are potent and selective inhibitors of p38 MAPK (p38a,(3,Y and 6) and the isoforms and splice variants thereof especially p38a, p38p and p38p2. The compounds are thus of use in medicine, for example in the treatment and prophylaxis of immune and inflammatory disorders described herein. The compounds are characterised by the presence in the molecule of an amino acid motif or an amino acid ester motif which is hydroiysabie by an intracellular carboxylesterase. Compounds of the invention having the lipophilic amino acid ester motif cross the cell membrane, and are hydrolysed to the acid by the intracellular carboxylesterases. The polar hydrolysis product accumulates in the cell since it does not readily cross the cell membrane. Hence the p38 MAP kinase activity of the compound is prolonged and enhanced within the cell. The compounds of the invention are related to the p38 MAP kinase inhibitors encompassed by the disclosures in International Patent Application WO03076405 but differ therefrom in that the present compounds have the amino acid ester motif referred to above.<br>

The radical -Y-L1-X1-[CH2]Z-<br>
This radical (or bond) arises from the particular chemistry strategy chosen to link the<br>
amino acid ester motif R1CH(R2)NH- to the ring system A. Clearly the chemistry strategy for that coupling may vary widely, and thus many combinations of the variables Y, L1, X1 and z are possible. The precise combination of variables making up the linking chemistry between the amino acid ester motif and the ring system A will often be irrelevant to the primary binding mode of the compound as a whole. On the other hand, that linkage chemistry will in some cases pick up additional binding interactions with the enzyme. It should also be noted that the benefits of the amino acid ester motif (facile entry into the cell, esterase hydrolysis within the cell, and accumulation within the cell of active carboxylic acid hydrolysis product) are best achieved when the linkage between the amino acid ester motif and the ring system A is not a substrate for peptidase activity within the cell, which might result in cleavage of the amino acid from the molecule. Of course, stability to intracellular peptidases is easily tested by incubating the compound with disrupted cell contents, and analysing for any such cleavage.<br>
 <br>
With the foregoing general observations in mind, taking the variables making up the radical -Y-L1-X1-[CH2]Z- in turn:<br>
z may be 0 or 1, so that a methylene radical linked to the ring system A is optional;<br>
specific preferred examples of Y when macrophage selectivity is not required include-(C=0)-, -(C=0)NH-, and -(C=0)0-; Where macrophage selectivity is required any of the other options for Y, including the case where Y is a bond, are appropriate.<br>
In the radical L1, examples of Alk1 and Alk2 radicals, when present, include —CH2-, —CH2CH2-, —CH2CH2CH2*, — CH2CH2CH2CH2-, -CH=CH-, -CH=CHCH2-, -CH2CH=CH-, CH2CH=CHCH2-CsC-, -C=CCH2-, CH2C=C-, and CH2C=CCH2. Additional examples of Alk1 and Alk2 include -CH2W-, -CH2CH2W-, -CH2CH2WCH2-, -CH2CH2WCH(CH3)-, -CH2WCH2CH2-, -CH2WCH2CH2WCH2- and -WCH2CH2- where W is -0-, -S-, -NH-, -N(CH3)-, or -CH2CH2N(CH2CHzOH)CH2-. Further examples of Alk1 and Alk2 include divalent cyclopropyi, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl radicals.<br>

In L1, when n is 0, the radical is a hydrocarbon chain (optionally substituted and perhaps having an ether, thioether or amino linkage). Presently it is preferred that there be no optional substituents in L1. When both m and p are 0, L1 is a divalent mono- or bicyclic carbocyclic or heterocyclic radical with 5-13 ring atoms (optionally substituted). When n is 1 and at least one of m and p is 1, L1 is a divalent radical including a hydrocarbon chain or chains and a mono- or bicyclic carbocyclic or heterocyclic radical with 5-13 ring atoms (optionally substituted). When present, Q may be, for example, a divalent phenyl, naphthyl, cyclopropyi, cyclopentyl, or cyclohexyl radical, or a mono-, or bi-cyclic heterocyclic radical having 5 to13 ring members, such as piperidinyl, piperazinyl, indolyl, pyridyl, thienyl, or pyrrolyl radical, but 1,4-phenylene is presently preferred.<br>
 <br>
Specifically, in some embodiments of the invention, L1, m and p may be 0 with n being 1. In other embodiments, n and p may be 0 with m being 1. In further embodiments, m, n and p may be all 0. In still further embodiments m may be 0, n may be 1 with Q being a monocyclic heterocyclic radical, and p may be 0 or 1. Alk1 and Alk2, when present, may be selected from -CH2-, -CH2CH2-, and -CH2CH2CH2- and Q may be 1,4-phenylene.<br>
 <br>
The group F^<br>
In one class of compounds of the invention, R^ is a carboxylic acid group. Although compounds of this class may be administered as the carboxylic acfd or a salt thereof, it is preferred that they be generated in the cell by the action of an intracellular esterase on a corresponding compound in which Ri is an ester group.<br>
The ester group Ri must be one which in the compound of the invention is hydrolysable by one or more intracellular carboxylesterase enzymes to a carboxylic acid group. Intracellular carboxylesterase enzymes capable of hydrolysing the ester group of a compound of the invention to the corresponding acid include the three known human enzyme isotypes hCE-1, hCE-2 and hCE-3. Although these are considered to be the main enzymes, other enzymes such as biphenylhydrolase (BPH) may also have a role in hydrolysing the ester. In general, if the carboxylesterase hydrolyses the free amino acid ester to the parent acid it will also hydrolyse the ester motif when covalently conjugated to the inhibitor. Hence, the broken cell assay and/or the isolated carboxylesterase assay described herein provide a straightforward, quick and simple first screen for esters which have the required hydrolysis profile. Ester motifs selected in that way may then be re-<br>
 <br>
assayed in the same carboxylesterase assay when conjugated to the inhibitor via the chosen conjugation chemistry, to confirm that it is still a carboxylesterase substrate in that background.<br>
Subject to the requirement that they be hydrolysable by intracellular carboxylesterase enzymes, examples of particular ester groups R, include those of formula -(C=0)OR14 wherein R14 is R8R9R10C- wherein<br>
(i)        R8 is hydrogen or optionally substituted (Ci-C3)alkyl-(Z1)a-[(C1-C3)alkyl]b-or (C2-C3)alkenyl-(Z1)a-[(Ci-C3)alkyl]b- wherein a and b are independently 0 or 1 and Z1 is -0-, -S-, or -NRir wherein Ru is hydrogen or (CrC3)alkyl; and R9 and R10 are independently hydrogen or (CrC3)alkyl-;<br>
(ii)       R8 is hydrogen or optionally substituted R12Ri3N-(CrC3)alkyl- wherein R12 is hydrogen or (d-C3)alkyl and R13 is hydrogen or (d-C3)alkyl; or R12 and R13 together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form an optionally substituted monocyclic heterocyclic ring of 5- or 6- ring atoms or bicyclic heterocyclic ring system of 8 to 10 ring atoms, and R9 and R10 are independently hydrogen or (CrC3)alkyl-;or<br>
«<br>
(iii) R8 and R9 taken together with the carbon to which they are attached form an optionally substituted monocyclic carbocyclic ring of from 3 to 7 ring atoms or bicyclic carbocyclic ring system of 8 to 10 ring atoms, and R10 is hydrogen.<br>
Within these classes, Rio is often hydrogen. Specific examples of R14 include methyl, ethyl, n- or iso-propyl, n-, sec- or tert-butyl, cyclohexyl, allyl, phenyl, benzyl, 2-, 3- or 4-pyridylmethyl, N-methylpiperidin-4-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl or methoxyethyl. Currently preferred is where R14 is cyclopentyl.<br>
Macrophages are known to play a key role in inflammatory disorders through the release of cytokines in particular TNFu and IL-1 (van Roon etal, Arthritis and Rheumatism, 2003, 1229-1238). In rheumatoid arthritis they are major contributors to the maintenance of joint inflammation and joint destruction. Macrophages are also involved in tumour growth and development (Naldini and Carraro, Curr Drug Targets Infiamm Allergy,<br>
 <br>
2005, 3-8). Hence agents that selectively target macrophage cell proliferation could be of value in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease. Targeting specific cell types would be expected to lead to reduced side-effects. The inventors have discovered a method of targeting p38 kinase inhibitors to macrophages which is based on the observation that the way in which the esterase motif is linked to the p38 kinase inhibitor determines whether it is hydrolysed, and hence whether or not it accumulates in different cell types. Specifically it has been found that macrophages contain the human carboxylesterase hCE-1 whereas other cell types do not. In the general formula (I) when the nitrogen of the esterase motif R1CH(R2)NH- is not directly linked to a carbonyl (-C(=0)-), ie when Y is not a -C(=0), -C(=0)0- or -C(=0)NR3- radical, the ester will only be hydrolysed by hCE-1 and hence the inhibitors will only accumulate in macrophages. Herein, unless "monocyte" or "monocytes" is specified, the term macrophage or macrophages will be used to denote macrophages (including tumour associated macrophages) and/or monocytes.<br>
The amino acid side chain R2<br>
Subject to the requirement that the ester group Ri be hydrolysable by<br>
intracellular carboxylesterase enzymes, the identity of the side chain group R2 is not critical.<br>

Presently preferred R2 groups include phenyl, benzyl, iso-butyl, cyclohexyl and t-butoxymethyl.<br>
For compounds of the invention which are to be administered systemically, esters with a slow rate of carboxylesterase cleavage are preferred, since they are less susceptible to pre-systemic metabolism. Their ability to reach their target tissue intact is therefore increased, and the ester can be converted inside the cells of the target tissue into the acid product. However, for local administration, where the ester is either directly applied to the target tissue or directed there by, for example, inhalation, it will often be desirable that the ester has a rapid rate of esterase cleavage, to minimise systemic exposure and consequent unwanted side effects. In the compounds of this invention, if the carbon adjacent to the alpha carbon of the alpha amino acid ester ester is monosubstituted, ie R2 is CH2RZ (Rz being the mono-substituent) then the esters tend to be cleaved more rapidly than if that carbon is di- or tri-substituted, as in the case where R2 is, for example, phenyl or cyclohexyl.<br>
As mentioned above, the compounds with which the invention is concerned are inhibitors of p38 MAK kinase activity, and are therefore of use in the treatment of<br>
 <br>
diseases such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, atopic dermatitis, graft versus host disease, or systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, in which p38 MAP kinase activity plays a part.<br>
It will be understood that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing treatment. Optimum dose levels and frequency of dosing will be determined by clinical trial.<br>
The compounds with which the invention is concerned may be prepared for administration by any route consistent with their pharmacokinetic properties. The orally administrable compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, liquid or gel preparations, such as oral, topical, or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricant, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants for example potato starch, or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents.<br>
 <br>
For topical application to the skin, the drug may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. Cream or ointment formulations which may be used for the drug are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example as described in standard textbooks of pharmaceutics such as the British Pharmacopoeia.<br>
For topical application by inhalation, the drug may be formulated for aerosol delivery for example, by pressure-driven jet atomizers or ultrasonic atomizers, or preferably by propellant-driven metered aerosols or propellant-free administration of micronized powders, for example, inhalation capsules or other "dry powder" delivery systems. Excipients, such as, for example, propellants (e.g. Frigen in the case of metered aerosols), surface-active substances, emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, flavorings, and fillers (e.g. lactose in the case of powder inhalers) may be present in such inhaled formulations. For the purposes of inhalation, a large number of apparata are available with which aerosols of optimum particle size can be generated and administered, using an inhalation technique which is appropriate for the patient. In addition to the use of adaptors (spacers, expanders) and pear-shaped containers (e.g. Nebulator®, Volumatic®), and automatic devices emitting a puffer spray (Autohaler®), for metered aerosols, in particular in the case of powder inhalers, a number of technical solutions are available (e.g. Diskhaler®, Rotadisk®, Turbohaler® or the inhalers for example as described in European Patent Application EP 0 505 321).<br>
«<br>
For topical application to the eye, the drug may be made up into a solution or suspension in a suitable sterile aqueous or non aqueous vehicle. Additives, for instance buffers such as sodium metabisulphite or disodium edeate; preservatives including bactericidal and fungicidal agents such as phenyl mercuric acetate or nitrate, benzalkonium chloride or chlorhexidine, and thickening agents such as hypromellose may also be included.<br>
The active ingredient may also be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. Depending on the vehicle and concentration used, the drug can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agent can be dissolved in the vehicle.<br>
Synthesis<br>
 <br>
There are multiple synthetic strategies for the synthesis of the compounds (I) with which the present invention is concerned, but all rely on known chemistry, known to the synthetic organic chemist. Thus, compounds according to formula (I) can be synthesised according to procedures described in the standard literature and are well-known to those skilled in the art. Typical literature sources are "Advanced organic chemistry, 4th Edition (Wiley), J March, "Comprehensive Organic Transformation", 2nd Edition (Wiley), R.C. Larock , "Handbook of Heterocyclic Chemistry, 2nd Edition (Pergamon), A.R. Katritzky), review articles such as found in "Synthesis", "Ace. Chem. Res", "Chem. Rev", or primary literature sources identified by standard literature searches online or from secondary sources such as "Chemical Abstracts" or "Beilstein".<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared by a number of processes generally<br>
described below and more specifically in the Examples hereinafter. In the reactions<br>
described below, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example<br>
hydroxyl, amino and carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to<br>
avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions [see for example Greene, T.W.,<br>
"Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and Sons, 1999]. Conventional<br>
protecting groups may be used in conjunction with standard practice. In some instances<br>
deprotection may be the final step in the synthesis of a compound of general formula (I)<br>
and the processes according to the invention described herein after are understood to<br>
extend to such removal of protecting groups.	*<br>
Examples of such methods that may be employed to the synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) are set out, but not limited to the reactions shown in Scheme 1 below.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Thus, amino esters of general formula (A) may be prepared by treatment of the tert-butylcarbamate of general formula (2a) with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane. Intermediates of general formula (2) may be prepared by methods described in WO 03/076405 and references therein. Amino esters of general formula (2b) may be formed as a bi-product in the synthesis of compounds of formula (2a) and treated with trifluoroacetic acid to give compounds of general formula (B).<br>
Intermediate esters of general formula (5) may be prepared by the procedures shown in Scheme 2.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

Hydrogenation of the nitrobenzyl intermediate (6) over palladium-carbon catalyst in THF provides amines of general formula (5). Intermediates of formula (6) may be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding amine with di-tert-butoxycarbonate in inert solvent such as THF at ambient temperature. Intermediates of general formula (7) may be produced by the alkylation of amino esters of formula (8) with 4-nitrobenzyl bromide. The reaction may be performed in a dialkylamide solvent such as DMF in the presence of an inorganic base such as potassium or ceasium carbonate Such reactions are set forth in March's Advanced Organic Chemistry [John Wiley and Sons, 1992].<br>
An alternative general method for the synthesis of N-benzylamino acid esters of general formula (9), where further functionalisation is required on the aryl nng of the benzyl substituent is set out in Scheme 3.<br>
 <br>
11	10	9<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, amino esters of general formula (9) may be prepared by, but not limited to, the reactions set out in Scheme 3. Thus benzonitriles of general formula (11), which are either commercially available or can be readily synthesized by methods known to those skilled in the art, may be converted to the corresponding benzaldehyde of general formula (10) by reduction with an appropriate metal hydride<br>
 <br>
such as DIBAL-H and acid hydrolysis of the intermediate imine [see for Example LeBel J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1964, 86, 3759]. The N-benzyl amino acid ester of general formula (9) may be prepared by reaction with the said benzaldehyde under conditions of reductive alkylation, employing borohydride reagents such as NaBH3CN or NaBH(OAc)3 under acidic conditions in a protic solvent such as methanol [see for example Borsch et al, J.Am. Chem. Soc, 1971, 93, 2897].<br>
Scheme 4<br>
 <br>
In a further aspect of the invention, compounds of general formula (C) may be prepared by methods set out in Scheme 4, from the alkylation of intermediates of general formula (8) with mesylates of general formula (12). The alkylation may be carried out in an inert ether solvent such as THF, in the presence of sodium iodide and inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the corresponding alkylbromides or alkylchlorides will be of utility in this process. The preparation of mesylate (12) may be performed by treatment of the primary alcohol (13) with methanesulphonyl chloride in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane and in the presence of organic base such as triethylamine. Compounds of general formula (14) may be prepared by methods described in WO 03/076405 and references therein.<br>
 <br>
In a further aspect to the invention compounds of general formula (D) may be prepared by, but not limited to, the reactions in Scheme 5.<br>
Scheme 5<br>
 <br>
Thus, alcohols of general formula (14) can be alkylated with an appropriately protected cycloalkanol derivative such as 1,4-dioxaspiro[4,5]decan-8-ol using triphenylphosphine and a dialkyl azadicarboxylate such as DEAD in an inert ethereal solvent [see for example Mitsunobu et al, Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1967, 40, 2380]. Ketals of general formula (16) may be deprotected to the corresponding ketone under aqueous acidic conditions. Reductive amination of compounds of formula (16) may be achieved by treatment with amino acid esters of general formula (8) in the presence of borohydride reagents such as sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium triacetoxyborohydride under acid conditions to give compounds of general formula (D).<br>
In a further aspect to the invention compounds of general formula (E) may be prepared by, but not limited to, the reactions in Scheme 6.<br>
Scheme 6<br>
 <br>
 <br>
19	18	17	E<br>
Reductive amination of compounds of formula (22) may be achieved by treatment with dibenzylamine in the presence of borohydride reagents such as sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium triacetoxyborohydride under acid conditions to give compounds of general formula (21). Hydrogenation of (21) and subsequent reaction with thiophosgene can give the isocyanate of general formula (20). Compounds of general formula (19) may be prepared by reaction of (20) with the corresponding acetophenone using sodium tert-butoxide. Alkylation of (19) with iodoethane may be carried out using an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as acetone. Compounds of general formula (18) may be subjected to cyclisation, oxidation and then subsequent ammonia displacement to give ketals of general formula (17). Thus ketals of general formula (17) may be deprotected to the corresponding cyclohexanone intermediate under aqueous acidic conditions, the cycohexanone then reacted with amino acid esters of general formula (8) under conditions of reductive amination employing borohydride reagents such as sodium cyanoborohydride and sodium triacetoxyborohydride.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, amino acids of general formula (F) may be prepared by, but not restricted to methods set out in Scheme 7.<br>
Scheme 7<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Thus, for example, amino acid esters of general formula (C) may be hydrolysed to the corresponding amino acids (F) by treatment with aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide, or any appropriate base, at ambient temperature in a co-solvent such as methanol or ethanol.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, amino acids of general formula (G) may be prepared by, but not restricted to methods set out in Scheme 8.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Thus, amino esters of general formula G may be prepared by the alkylation of intermediates of general formula (8) with mesylates of general formula (23). The alkylation may be carried out in an inert ether solvent such as THF, in the presence of sodium iodide and inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate. The preparation of mesylate (23) may be performed by treatment of the primary alcohol (24) with methanesulphonyl chloride in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane and in the presence of organic base such as triethylamine. The alcohol (24) may be prepared by deprotection of the acetyl group of intermediate (25) under acidic conditions such as HCI. Intermediates of general formula (4), (25) and (26) may be prepared by similar methods described in WO 03/076405 and references therein.<br>

Route I (exemplified for Intermediate 9) Stage 1 - Ester formation<br>
 <br>
To a solution of (S)-2-fert-butoxycarbonylamino-3-cyclohexyl-propionic acid (5g, 19.4mmol) in DMF (50ml) at 0°C was added cyclopentanol (8.8ml, 97.15mmol), EDCI (4.09g, 21.37mmol) and finally DMAP (237mg, 1.94mmol). The reaction mixture was warmed to RT and stirred for 18h. The DMF was removed in vacuo to give a clear oil. This was separated between water and EtOAc. The organic phase was dried (MgS04) and concentrated in vacuo. The crude extract was purified by column chromatography (25% EtOAC in heptane) to yield the desired product as a clear oil (14.87g, 55%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, d6-DMSO) 5; 7.09 (1H, d), 5.08 (1H, t), 3.76 (1H, t), 1.50-1.85 (10H, br m), 1.39 (9H, s), 1.00-1.25 (9H, br m).<br>
Stage 2 - Boc deprotection to yield cyclopentyl (2S)-amino(cyclohexyl)acetate hydrochloride (Intermediate 9)<br>
 <br>
Stage 1 product (14.87g, 45.69mmol) was dissolved in DCM (100ml) and treated with 4M HCI/dioxane (22.8ml, 91.38mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 24h. The crude mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give an orange oil. This was triturated with Et20 to give a white precipitate. This was further washed with Et20 to<br>
 <br>
give the desired product as a white powder (7.78g, 65%). 1H NMR (300MHz, Ce-DMSO) 6; 8.45 (3H, br s), 5.22 (1H, t), 3.28 (1H, d), 1.95-1.50 (10H, br m), 1.30-0.90 (9H, br m).<br>
Route II (exemplified for Intermediate 10)<br>
Stage 1 - Ester formation to yield (1 S)-2-(cyclopentyloxy)-2-oxo-1-phenylethanaminium<br>
4-methylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 10)<br>
 <br>
To a slurry of (S)-phenylglycine (5g, 33.1 mmol) in cyclohexane (150ml) was added cyclopentanol (29.84ml, 331 mmol) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (6.92g, 36.4mmol). The reaction was fitted with a Dean-Stark receiver and heated to 135°C for complete dissolution. After 12h, the reaction was cooled to RT leading to the precipitation of a white solid. The solid was filtered and washed with EtOAc before drying under reduced pressure to give the required product as a white powder (11.01g, 85%). 1H NMR (300MHz, afc-DMSO) 5; 8.82 (2H, br s), 8.73 (1H, brs), 7.47 (7H, m), 7.11 (2H, d), 5.25 (1H, br s), 5.18 (1H, m), 2.29 (3H, s), 1.87-1.36 (8H, m).<br>
Intermediates 11 and 12 were prepared using 2-indanol and a-norborneol respectively, instead of cyclopentanol (via Route II). In a similar manner, intermediates 13 and 14 were prepared using dimethylaminoethanol and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine respectively (via Route I). Intermediate 15 was prepared via route I using commercially available Z-Dab(Boc)-OH (N-a-Z-N-Y-Boc-L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid).<br>
The corresponding (R)-amino acid esters of the above intermediates can be prepared in a similar manner to shown above, starting from the relevant commercially available (R)-amino acids. In addition, the corresponding Leucine and Phenylglycine tert-butyl esters are commercially available and are used directly where appropriate.<br>

Measurement of biological activities<br>
P38 MAP Kinase activity<br>
 <br>
The ability of compounds to inhibit p38 MAP a Kinase activity was measured in an assay performed by Upstate (Dundee UK). In a final reaction volume of 25yL, p38 MAP Kinase a (5-10 mU) is incubated with 25mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.002 mMEGTA, 0.33 mg/mL myelin basic protein, 10mM MgAcetate and [g-33p-ATP] (specific activity approx. 500cpm/pmol, concentration as required). The reaction is initiated by the addition of the MgATP mix. After incubation for 40 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by the addition of 5j.iL of a 3% phosphoric acid solution. 10j.iL of the reaction is then spotted onto a P30 filtermat and washed three times for 5 minutes in 75 mM phosphoric acid and once in methanol prior to drying and scintillation counting.<br>
Duplicate data points are generated from a 1/3 log dilution series of a stock solution in DMSO. Nine dilutions steps are made from a top concentration of 10jiM, and a 'no compound' blank is included. The standard radiometric filter-binding assay is performed at an ATP concentration at, or close to, the Km. Data from scintillation counts are collected and subjected to free-fit analysis by Prism software. From the curve generated, the concentration giving 50% inhibition is determined and reported.

 <br>
Preparation of cell extract<br>
U937 or Hut78 tumour cells (~ 109) were washed in 4 volumes of Dulbeccos PBS (~ 1 litre) and pelleted at 525 g for 10 min at 49C. This was repeated twice and the final cell pellet was resuspended in 35 ml of cold homogenising buffer (Trizma 10 mM, NaC1130 mM, CaCI2 0.5 mM pH 7.0 at 25°C). Homogenates were prepared by nitrogen cavitation (700 psi for 50 min at 4°C). The homogenate was kept on ice and supplemented with a cocktail of inhibitors at final concentrations of:<br>
Leupeptin 1 j.iM<br>
Aprotinin 0.1 \xM<br>
E64 8 nM<br>
Pepstatin 1.5 |.iM<br>

Chymostatin 33 ILIM After clarification of the cell homogenate by centrifugation at 525 g for 10 min, the resulting supernatant was used as a source of esterase activity and was stored at -80°C until required.<br>
Measurement of ester cleavage<br>
Hydrolysis of esters to the corresponding carboxylic acids can be rfieasured using the cell extract, prepared as above. To this effect cell extract (-30 ug / total assay volume of 0.5 ml) was incubated at 37°C in a Tris- HCI 25 mM, 125 mM NaCI buffer, pH 7.5 at 25°C. At zero time the ester (substrate) was then added at a final concentration of 2.5 |.iM and the samples were incubated at 37°C for the appropriate time (usually 0 or 80 min). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 x volumes of acetonitrile. For zero time samples the acetonitrile was added prior to the ester compound. After centrifugation at 12000 g for 5 min, samples were analysed for the ester and its corresponding carboxylic acid at room temperature by LCMS (Sciex API 3000, HP1100 binary pump, CTC PAL). Chromatography was based on an AceCN (75x2.1 mm) column and a mobile phase of 5-95 % acetonitrile in water /0.1 % formic acid.<br>
