Original <br>
162/MUMNP/2005<br><br>
BEVERAGE DISPENSING MACHINE<br>
FIELD OF. THE. INVENTION <br>
The present invention is directed to a beverage dispensing or brewing machine. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a beverage dispensing or brewing machine comprising a delivery means suitable to deliver a beverage enhancing component<br>
     to a beverage precursor.  The delivery means is suitable to<br>
deliver beverage enhancing component to the beverage precursor directly, to the diluent directly, to the beverage precursor when it is being combined with diluent or after the beverage precursor has been combined with diluent.  The beverage dispensed from the<br>
     beverage, dispensing machine of the present invention has superior flavor and aroma characteristics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
        Methods for preparing ready-to-dispense beverages, like tea beverages, are known.  For example, many food establishments have brewing systems that dispense tea-based beverages ready for consumption.  Typically, such systems operate by mixing an instant tea or a brewed tea concentrate<br>
     with hot water to produce a hot water composition that is combined with cold water to thereby produce a tea beverage that is ready to drink.<br>
Unfortunately, however, when preparing beverages, like tea     beverages, from a beverage precursor in the manner described above, the beverages often have, for example, flavor and aroma characteristics that do not meet desired expectations, especially when the beverage precursor employed has aged.  This is true<br><br>
because beverage enhancing components, like flavor- and aroma-generating compounds found in beverage precursors, typically, degrade within the beverage precursor, a direct result of their unstable nature in the presence of conventional beverage    precursor components.<br>
It is of increasing" interest to develop a beverage dispensing machine that comprises a delivery means for delivering a beverage enhancing component (not formulated within a beverage<br>
     precursor) to a beverage precursor.  This invention, therefore, is directed to a beverage dispensing machine comprising a delivery means suitable to deliver a beverage enhancing component to a beverage precursor directly, to a diluent directly, to the beverage precursor when it is being combined with diluent, or to<br>
     a mixture comprising beverage precursor and diluent. Such an apparatus can store beverage precursor and beverage enhancing component separately from each other.  The apparatus can also deliver beverage precursor and beverage enhancing component so that a beverage, of superior flavor and aroma, can be made for<br>
     consumption.<br>
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br>
        Efforts have been disclosed for making beverages.  In U.S. Patent No. 6,413,570, a brewed tea concentrate suitable for making a tea beverage is described.<br>
Still other efforts have been disclosed for dispensing      beverages.  In U.S. Patent No. 6,135,009, a beverage brewing system on. a. serving cart assembly is described.<br><br>
Even other efforts have been disclosed for dispensing beverages.  In world Application WO 01/65985, a brewing device having automatic and semi-automatic brewing modes is described.<br>
       None of the additional information above describes a<br>
beverage dispensing machine comprising a delivery means suitable to deliver a beverage enhancing component to a beverage precursor within the beverage dispensing machine.<br><br><br>
