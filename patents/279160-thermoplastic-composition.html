				<td>THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITION<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION <br>
[0001]      The invention relates to a composition containing a particulate solid, a plastic material (such as a thermoplastic polymer) and a compound containing an amide group. The compound is capable of being a dispersant.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
[0002] Thermoplastics such as PP, PE, etc., are typically coloured using pigment concentrates. The pigment concentrates are often referred to as masterbatches or compounds. These concentrates are prepared by mixing ingredients together and subjecting them to any of the processes commonly used for dispersing particulate solids in a thermoplastic polymer. Compounding or mixing in a twin-screw extruder is one of these processes. Pigment concentrations in masterbatches may contain up to 70% of pigment, and optionally other additives. Other additives may include waxes, dispersants, lubricants and UV stabilizers.<br>
[0003] Production of masterbatches typically utilises a pigment dispersed in thermoplastic polymer, i.e., fine particles with limited amounts of aggregates. However, aggregates are known to form from the pigments in the production of masterbatches. The presence of aggregates tends to result in filter blocking of the extruder.<br>
[0004] In addition, particular requirements are important for finished articles containing the thermoplastic polymer. The thermoplastic polymer may be in the form of a solid article, a film or fiber. In solid articles, acceptable dispersion of the pigment is necessary in order to maximise colour development, tinctorial strength and reduced speck levels. For films, incomplete dispersion of the pigment may lead to cracking, unwanted light scattering effects and specks. In fibres, incomplete dispersion of the pigment may result in fiber breakage.<br>
[0005] U.S. Patent No. 4,797,400 discloses the use of a polymer containing a carboxylate functionality, e.g., poly(12-hydroxystearic acid) or polyricinoleic acid,<br>
 <br>
as a dispersant in the presence of a particulate solid, a lubricant and a thermoplastic<br>
polymer.<br>
[0006]      Waxes are also known to disperse particulate solids in thermoplastic<br>
polymers, see U.S. Patent Application 2002/0151639.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <br>
[0007] The composition described herein is able to minimise at least one of any of the technical challenges discussed above. These challenges may lead to less efficient processing in expensive extruder-type equipment, causing production costs to increase. The present invention therefore identifies compounds and compositions thereof capable of dispersing a pigment allowing a thermoplastic to have at least one of (i) a reduction in aggregates and specks, (ii) provides a finer state of dispersion (for example having a lower filter pressure value), (iii) has acceptable tinctorial strength and has improved brightness, and (iv) faster rates of dispersion. [0008] In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a particulate solid, a plastic material (such as a thermoplastic polymer) and a compound, wherein the compound is represented by Formula (1):<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein:<br>
T is a lipophilic component of an alk(en)yl group containing 6 or more carbon atoms, a polyester, or mixtures thereof;<br>
G is an acylating group (including an acyl group or polyacyl groups), typically containing one or two carbonyl groups;<br>
Z is -N(R)j or -N(R)V(B-D)-, bonded to a carbonyl group of G to form either an amide or imide group;<br>
j is 1 or 2, R is independently H or a C1-18 alk(en)yl group with the proviso when j is 2 each R group can be the same or different;<br>
v is 0 or 1, with the proviso that when v is 1, R is independently H or a C1-18 alk(en)yl group, and when v is 0 nitrogen forms an imide group;<br>

B is an alkylene radical, a hydroxyalkylene radical, a nitrogen-containing alkylene radical, a nitrogen-containing hydroxyalkylene radical, or mixtures thereof, typically containing 2-12, or 2 to 10 carbon atoms; and<br>
v is 0 or 1, with the proviso that when v is 1 R is independently H or a C1-18 alk(en)yl group, and when v is 0 nitrogen forms an imide group. [0011]      The compound of Formula (la) may also be represented by:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>

dispersing a particulate solid in a thermoplastic medium.  The composition may be<br>
suitable for manufacture of films, fibres and solid articles.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0015]      The present invention provides a composition as disclosed herein above. [0016]      As used herein the term "alk(en)yl" encompasses both alkyl and alkenyl groups.<br>

fatty acids listed above.<br>
[0026]      In one embodiment, the polyester may be made from a mixture of<br>

Industrial Application<br>
[0029]      In one embodiment, the compound as described herein is a processing aid<br>
or dispersant.<br>
[0030]      The   compound   in  different   embodiments  may  be  present   in  the<br>
composition of the invention in a range selected from 0.1 to 50 wt. %, or 0.25 to 35<br>
wt. %, and 0.5 to 30 wt. %.<br>
[0031]      The particulate solid present in the composition may be any inorganic or<br>
organic solid material. In one embodiment, the particulate solid is a pigment.<br>
[0032]      In one embodiment, the particulate solid is an organic pigment from any<br>
of the recognised classes of pigments described, for example, in the Third Edition<br>
of the Colour Index (1971) and subsequent revisions of, and supplements thereto,<br>
under the chapter headed "Pigments".<br>
[0033]      Examples of organic pigments are those from the azo, disazo, trisazo,<br>
condensed azo, azo lakes, naphthol pigments, anthrapyrimidine, benzimidazolone,<br>
carbazole, diketopyrrolopyrrole, flavanthrone, indigoid pigments, isoindolinone, isoindoline, isoviolanthrone, metal complex pigments, oxazine, perylene, perinone, pyranthrone, pyrazoloquinazolone, quinophthalone, triarylcarbonium pigments, triphendioxazine, xanthene, thioindigo, indanthrone, isoindanthrone, anthanthrone, anthraquinone, isodibenzanthrone, triphendioxazine, quinacridone and phthalocyanine series, especially copper phthalocyanine and its nuclear halogenated derivatives, and also lakes of acid, basic and mordant dyes, and carbon black. Carbon black, although strictly inorganic, behaves more like an organic pigment in its dispersing properties. In one embodiment, the organic pigments are phthalocyanines, especially copper phthalocyanines, monoazos, disazos, indanthrones, anthranthrones, quinacridones, diketopyrrolopyrroles, perylenes and carbon black.<br>
[0034] Inorganic solids include: extenders and fillers such as talc, kaolin, montmorillonites including bentonites, hectorites and saponites, mica, silica, barytes and chalk, flame-retardant fillers such as alumina trihydrate, natural magnesium hydroxide; or brucite, particulate ceramic materials such as alumina, silica, zirconia, titania, silicon nitride, boron nitride, silicon carbide, boron carbide, mixed silicon-aluminium nitrides and metal titanates; particulate magnetic materials such as the magnetic oxides of transition metals, especially iron and chromium, e.g., gamma-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and cobalt-doped iron oxides, calcium oxide, ferrites, especially barium ferrites; and metal particles, especially metallic iron, nickel, cobalt, copper and alloys thereof.<br>
[0035] Examples of other inorganic pigments include metallic oxides such as titanium dioxide, rutile titanium dioxide and surface coated titanium dioxide, titanium oxides of different colours such as yellow and black, iron oxides of different colours such as yellow, red, brown and black, zinc oxide, zirconium oxides, aluminium oxide, oxymetallic compounds such as bismuth vanadate, cobalt aluminate, cobalt stannate, cobalt zincate, zinc chromate and mixed metal oxides of manganese, nickel, titanium, chromium, antimony, magnesium, cobalt, iron and aluminium, Prussian blue, vermillion, ultramarine, zinc phosphate, zinc sulphide, molybdates and chromates of calcium and zinc, metal effect pigments such as<br>
aluminium flake, copper, and copper/zinc alloy, pearlescent flake such as lead carbonate and bismuth oxychloride.<br>
[0036] In one embodiment, thermoplastic resins include polyolefins, polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, polystyrenics, poly(meth)acrylates, celluloses and cellulose derivatives. Said compositions may be prepared in a number of ways but melt mixing and dry solid blending are typical methods. [0037] Examples of a suitable thermoplastics include (low density, or linear low density or high density) polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), nylon 6, nylon 6-6, nylon 6-12, nylon 11, nylon 12, nylon 4-6, polymethylmethacrylate, polyethersulphone, polysulphone, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, thermoplastic polyurethane, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), Victrex PEEK™ polymers (such as oxy-1, 4-phenylenoeoxy-l, 4-phenylene-carbonyl-l, 4-phenylene polymers) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polymers (ABS); and various other polymeric blends or alloys.<br>
[0038] The compositions typically contain from 1 to 95% by weight of the particulate solid, the quantity depending on the nature of the solid and the relative densities of the solid and the polar organic liquid. For example, a composition in which the solid is an organic material, such as an organic pigment, in one embodiment contains from 15 to 60% by weight of the solid whereas a composition in which the solid is an inorganic material, such as an inorganic pigment, filler or extender, in one embodiment contains from 40 to 90% by weight of the solid based on the total weight of composition.<br>
[0039] The composition may include other ingredients such as antifogging agents, nucleators, blowing agents, flame retardants, process aids, surfactants, heat stabilizers, UV absorbers, fragrances, anti-microbial agents, biocides, impact modifiers, antioxidants, antistatic agents, coupling agents, foaming agents, mould-release agents, lubricants (external and internal), plasticisers, slip agents, UV stabilisers, viscosity depressants, dispersants other than the compound of the present invention, and air-release agents.<br>
[0040]      The composition may be prepared by any of the conventional methods<br>
known for preparing thermoplastic compounds.   Thus, the solid, the thermoplastic<br>
polymer, and the dispersant may be mixed in any order, the mixture then being<br>
subjected to a mechanical treatment to reduce the particles of the solid to an<br>
appropriate size, for example, by Banbury mixing, ribbon blending, twin-screw<br>
extrusion,  twin-roll  milling,  compounding  in  a Buss  co-kneader,  or  similar<br>
equipment.<br>
[0041]      In one embodiment, the composition of the invention further includes<br>
one or more additional known dispersants.<br>
[0042]      In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising:<br>
(a)	0.1 to 50 wt. %, or 0.25 to 35 wt. %, and 0.5 to 30 wt. % of the compound disclosed above;<br>
(b)	0   to   90   wt.   %   of an   amorphous  poly-a-olefin,   such  as   a polyethylene/polypropylene mixture;<br>
(c)	0 to 90 wt. % of a wax, typically a polyolefin wax, such as a polyethylene wax;<br>
(d)	0 to 30 wt. % of a crystalline polyolefin; and<br>
(e)	0 to 75 wt. % of a hydrogenated castor oil wax.<br>
[0043]      In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising:<br>
(a)	0.1 to 50 wt. %, or 0.25 to 35 wt. %, and 0.5 to 30 wt. % of the compound disclosed above;<br>
(b)	0   to   90   wt.   %   of an   amorphous   poly-a-olefin   such   as   a polyethylene/polypropylene mixture;<br>
(c)	0 to 90 wt. % of a wax, typically a polyolefin wax such as a polyethylene wax; and<br>
(d)	0 to 30 wt. % of a crystalline polyolefin, and<br>
(e)	0 to 75 wt. % of a hydrogenated castor oil wax,<br>
with the proviso that at least one of (b) and (c) is present at 0.1 wt % or more. [0044]      The polyolefin wax (such as a polyethylene wax) may be described as a carrier, co-agent or synergist.<br>
[0045] In one embodiment, the invention provides for a micronised composition as is described herein. In one embodiment, the composition further comprising at least one of either (i) an amorphous poly-a-olefin, or (ii) polyolefin wax, has a particle size fraction of at least 10 wt % having a diameter of 1 mm or less, or 0.5 mm or less, or 0.1 mm or less, or 0.05 mm or less. In one embodiment, the particle size fraction may be 50 nm to 1 mm, or 100 nm to 0.05 mm.<br>
[0046] Another inventive use of the compound of Formula (1) consists in the production of dispersible solids in powder particle and/or fibre particle form, particularly of dispersible pigments or polymeric fillers, where the particles are coated with the dispersant. Coatings of this kind, of both organic and inorganic solids, are carried out in a known way, as described for example in EP-A-0 270 126. In this case a solvent or emulsion medium may either be removed or remain in the mixture, forming pastes. These pastes are customary commercial products and may further comprise binder fractions and also further auxiliaries and additives. In the case of pigments it is possible to coat the pigment surface during or after the synthesis of the pigments, by, for example, adding the compound of Formula (1) of the invention to the pigment suspension, or during or after the operation of pigment finish. The pigments pretreated in this way are notable for greater ease of incorporation and also for enhanced viscosity, flocculation and gloss performance and for higher colour strength, as compared with untreated pigments. [0047] The composition comprising the compound of Formula (1) and the plastic material may be formulated with the particulate solid in a similar manner to that described hereinbefore for the compound of Formula (1), and the plastic material. This composition may then be treated as a "master batch" and added to additional polymeric material when forming fabricated articles. The amount of "master batch" which is mixed with the additional polymeric material may vary over wide limits depending on the nature of polymeric material and the particulate solid. In different embodiments, the amount of "master batch" ranges include 0.5 to 50%, or 10 to 50%, or 20 to 50% based on the total weight of the final plastic article (typically thermoplastic). Although the plastic material used in preparing the "master batch" may differ from the addition of further plastic material, but<br>
typically it may be the same.   The use of "master batches" is especially useful<br>
where      the      plastic      material      includes      polypropylene,      polyethylene,<br>
polyethylene/polypropylene diene, ethyl vinyl acetate, polychloroprene, chlorinated<br>
polyethylene, chlorosulphonated polyethylene, poly vinyl chloride, natural and<br>
synthetic rubber such as butadiene-based elastomers  (for instance butadiene-<br>
styrene, butadiene-acrylonitrile rubbers, polybutadiene), polyisoprene or natural<br>
rubber.<br>
[0048]      The following examples provide illustrations of the invention.   These<br>
examples are non exhaustive and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0049]      Melt 1 (MELT): Ethylene-bis-stearamide   (37   parts)   (commercially<br>
from Aldrich) is melt mixed with polypropylene (20 parts, ex Aldrich weight<br>
average molecular weight (MW) 14,000) and polyethylene (43 parts, ex Aldrich,<br>
medium density).<br>
[0050]      Example   1   (EX1):      Polyisobutylene   succinic   anhydride   (with   a<br>
polyisobutylene having a number average molecular weight of 950) 148.2 g is<br>
charged to a 250 ml 3 neck round bottom flask and stirred at 70°C under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere.    Ethylene diamine (4.45g) is added slowly dropwise to the stirred<br>
liquid.  An exotherm resulted and the temperature is allowed to cool back to 70°C<br>
and held at this temperature for 3 hours.   The temperature is then raised to 180°C<br>
