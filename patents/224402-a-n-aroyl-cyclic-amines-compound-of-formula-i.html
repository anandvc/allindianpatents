				<td>The present invention relates to a n-aroyl cyclic amines compound of formula<br>
This invention relates to N-aroyl cyclic amine derivatives and their use as pharmaceuticals.<br>
Many medically significant biological processes are mediated by proteins participating in signal transduction pathways that involve G-proteins and/or second<br>
messengers...	<br>
Polypeptides and polynucleotides encoding the human 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled neuropeptide receptor, orexin-1 (HFGAN72), have been identified and are disclosed in EP-A-875565, EP-A-875566 and WO 96/34877. Polypeptides and polynucleotides encoding a second human orexin receptor, orexin-2 (HFGANP), have been identified and are disclosed in EP-A-893498.<br>
Polypeptides and polynucleotides encoding polypeptides which are ligands for the orexin-1 receptor, e.g. orexin-A (Lig72A) are disclosed in EP-A-849361.<br>
Orexin receptors are found in the mammalian host and may be responsible for many biological functions, including pathologies including, but not limited to, depression; anxiety; addictions; obsessive compulsive disorder; affective neurosis/disorder; depressive neurosis/disorder; anxiety neurosis; dysthymic disorder; behaviour disorder; mood disorder; sexual dysfunction; psychosexual dysfunction; sex disorder; sexual disorder; schizophrenia; manic depression; delerium; dementia; severe mental retardation and dyskinesias such as Huntington's disease and Gilles de la Touretfs syndrome; disturbed biological and circadian rhythms; feeding disorders, such as anorexia, bulimia, cachexia, and obesity; diabetes; appetite/taste disorders; vomiting/nausea; asthma; cancer; Parkinson's disease; Cushing's syndrome / disease; basophil adenoma; prolactinoma; hyperprolactinemia; hypopituitarism; hypophysis tumor / adenoma; hypothalamic diseases; Froehlich's syndrome; adrenohypophysis disease; hypophysis disease; hypophysis tumor / adenoma; pituitary growth hormone; adrenohypophysis hypofunction; adrenohypophysis hyperfunction; hypothalamic hypogonadism; Kallman's syndrome (anosmia, hyposmia); functional or psychogenic amenorrhea; hypopituitarism; hypothalamic hypothyroidism; hypothalamic-adrenal dysfunction; idiopathic hyperprolactmemia; hypothalamic disorders of growth hormone deficiency; idiopathic growth hormone deficiency; dwarfism; gigantism; acromegaly; disturbed biological and circadian mythms; and sleep disturbances associated with such diseases as neurological disorders, neuropathic pain and restless leg syndrome, heart and lung diseases; acute and congestive heart failure; hypotension; hypertension; urinary retention; osteoporosis; angina pectoris; myocardial infarction; ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke; subarachnoid haemorrhage; head injury such as sub-arachnoid haemorrhage associated with traumatic head injury; ulcers; allergies; benign prostatic hypertrophy; chronic renal failure; renal disease; impaired glucose tolerance; migraine; hyperalgesia; pain; enhanced or exaggerated sensitivity to pain, such as hyperalgesia, causalgia and allodynia; acute pain; burn pain; atypical facial pain; neuropathic pain; back pain; complex regional pain syndromes I and II; arthritic pain; sports injury pain; pain related to infection, e.g. HIV, post-polio syndrome, and post-herpetic neuralgia; phantom limb pain; labour pain; cancer pain; post-chemotherapy pain; post-stroke pain; post¬operative pain; neuralgia; nausea and vomiting; conditions associated with visceral pain<br><br><br>
including irritable bowel syndrome, migraine and angina; urinary bladder incontinence e.g.<br>
urge incontinence; tolerance to narcotics or withdrawal from narcotics; sleep disorders;<br>
sleep apnea; narcolepsy, insomnia; parasomnia; jet-lag syndrome; and neurodegenerarive<br>
disorders, which includes nosological entities such as disinhibra'on-dementia-parkinsonismamyotrophy<br>
complex; pallido-ponto-nigral degeneration, epilepsy, and seizure disorders.<br>
Experiments have shown that central administration of the ligand orexin-A<br>
(described in more detail below) stimulated food intake in fieely-feeding rats during a 4<br>
hour time period. This increase was approximately four-fold over control rats receiving<br>
vehicle. These data suggest that orexin-A may be an endogenous regulator of appetite.<br>
Therefore, antagonists of its receptor may be useful in'the treatment of obesity and diabetes,<br>
see Cell, 1998,92,573-585.<br>
There is a significant incidence of obesity in westernised societies. According to<br>
WHO definitions a mean of 35% of subjects in 39 studies were overweight and a further<br>
22% clinically obese. It has been estimated that 5.7% of all healthcare costs in the USA are<br>
a consequence of obesity. About 85% of Type 2 diabetics are obese, and diet and exercise<br>
are of value in all diabetics. The incidence of diagnosed diabetes in westernised countries is<br>
typically 5% and there are estimated to be an equal number undiagnosed. The incidence of<br>
both diseases is rising, demonstrating the inadequacy of current treatments which may be<br>
either ineffective or have toxicity risks including cardiovascular effects. Treatment of<br>
diabetes with sulfonylureas or insulin can cause hypoglycaemia, whilst metformin causes GI<br>
side-effects. No drug treatment for Type 2 diabetes has been shown to reduce the long-term<br>
complications of the disease. Insulin sensitisers will be useful for many diabetics, however<br>
they do not have an anti-obesity effect<br>
Rat sleep/EEG studies have also shown that central administration of orexin-A, an<br>
agonist of the orexin receptors, causes a dose-related increase in arousal, largely at the<br>
expense of a reduction in paradoxical sleep and slow wave sleep 2, when administered at<br>
the onset of the normal sleep period. Therefore antagonists of its receptor may be useful in<br>
the treatment of sleep disorders including insomnia.<br>
The present invention provides JV-aroyl cyclic amine derivatives which are nonpeptide<br>
antagonists of human orexin receptors, in particular orexin-1 receptors, hi<br>
particular, these compounds are of potential use in the treatment of obesity, including<br>
obesity observed in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes patients, and/or sleep<br>
disorders. Additionally these compounds are useful in the treatment of stroke, particularly<br>
ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke, and/or blocking the emetic response; i.e. useful in the<br>
treatment of nausea and vomiting.<br>

WOOO/47580 disclose phenyl urea derivatives and WOOO/47576 discloses quinolinyi<br>
cinnamide derivatives as orexin receptor antagonists. WO01/96302 discloses N-aroyl cyclic<br>
amine derivatives.<br>

It will be appreciated that compounds of formula (T) may exist as R or S<br>
enantiomers. The present invention includes within its'scope all such isomers, including<br>
mixtures. Where additional chiral centres are present in compounds of formula (I), the<br>
present invention includes within its scope all possible diasterepismers, including mixtures<br>
thereof. The different isomeric forms may be separated or resolved one from the other by<br>
conventional methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by conventional synthetic<br>
methods or by stereospecific or asymmetric syntheses.<br>
It will be understood that the invention includes pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives of compounds of formula (I) and that these are included within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
Particular compounds according to the invention include those mentioned in the<br>
examples and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives.<br>
As used herein "pharmaceutically acceptable derivative" includes any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or salt of such ester of a compound of formula (Figure Removed)<br><br>
which, upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a<br>
compound of formula (I) or an active metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
It will be appreciated that for use in medicine the salts of the compounds of formula<br>
(I) should be pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will<br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art and include acid addition salts formed with inorganic<br>
acids e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric or phosphoric acid; and organic acids<br>
e.g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzoic, p-toluenesulfonic,<br>
methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. Other salts e.g. oxalates, may be used, for<br>
example in the isolation of compounds of formula (I) and are included within the scope of<br>
this invention. Also included within the scope of the invention are solvates and hydrates of<br>
compounds of formula (I).<br>
Certain of the compounds of formula (I) may form acid addition salts with one or<br>
more equivalents of the acid The present invention includes within its scope all possible<br>
stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric forms.<br>
Since the compounds of formula (I) are intended for use in pharmaceutical<br>
compositions it will readily be understood that they are each preferably provided in<br>
substantially pure form, for example at least 60% pure, more suitably at least 75% pure and<br>
preferably at least 85%, especially at least 98% pure (% are on a weight for weight basis).<br>
Impure preparations of the compounds may be used for preparing the more pure forms used<br>

According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a process for the<br>
preparation of compounds of formula (1) and derivatives thereof. The following schemes<br>
detail some synthetic routes to compounds of the invention.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein Ar1, Ar2, Y, m, p and R are as defined for formula (I), L1 and L2 are leaving groups,<br>
and P is a protecting group.<br>
Examples of suitable leaving groups L1 include halogen, hydroxy, OSC^Me,<br>
OSO2(4-tolyl). The reaction of (V) with (VT) preferably proceeds in an inert solvent such as<br>
N^f-dimethylformamide in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, sodium hydride or<br>
potassium t-butoxide.<br>
Scheme Ib<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Reaction of (VIS) with (IX) proceeds in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide<br>
or xylene in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate or diisopropylethylamine,<br>
preferably at elevated temperatures.<br>
Alternatively where m is 1 and p is 0 or 1 compounds maybe prepared as shown in<br>
scheme Ic.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Reaction of (XT) with an alkylating agent (Ci-fiL1 proceeds in the presence of a base<br>
such as sodium hydride in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide.<br>
Examples of suitable leaving groups L2 include halogen, hydroxy, QC(=O)alkyl and<br>
OC(=O)O-aIkyI. The transformation (U) to (I) may be carried out in an inert solvent such as<br>
dichloromethane, in the presence of a base such as triethyiamine. Alternatively this step<br>
may be carried out when L2 represents hydroxy, in which case reaction with (H) takes place<br>
in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of a diimide reagent such as 1-<br>
ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiiniide hydrochloride, and an activator such as 1-<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole.<br>
Examples of protecting groups P include f-butyloxycarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl ,<br>
optionally substitued benzyl and benzyloxycarbonyl, Deprotection conditions are<br>
respectively, acid (e.g. trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane), base (e.g. sodium hydroxide<br>
in a solvent such as aqueous methanol) and catalytic hydrogenolysis in an inert solvent (e.g<br>
using palladium on charcoal in a lower alcohol or ethyl acetate).<br>
Compounds of formula (V), (VT) and (DQ are known in the literature or can be<br>
prepared by known methods. Compounds (VJH) can be prepared by known methods.<br>
Within the schemes above there is scope for functional group interconversion; for<br>
example in compound (V), conversion of one value of L1 to another value of L1; or hi<br>
compounds (TV) conversion of protecting group P for another protecting group P, or<br>
conversion of one compound of formula (I) to another of formula (I) by interconversion of<br>
substituents.<br>
When R1 is an aromatic group, the substituent R1 may be introduced at the final<br>
stage as illustrated in Scheme 2 by reaction of a compound of formula (VD) where L3<br>
represents a leaving group such as halogen (preferably bromo or iodo) or<br>
trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy, and all other variables are as previously defined, with a reagent<br>
R!M, where M is the residue of an organometallic species e.g. B(OH)2 or trialkylstannyl.<br>
Such a process may be carried out in an inert solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane or 1,4-<br>
dioxan, in the presence of a transition metal catalyst such as Pd(PPh3)4.<br>

where an antagonist of a human Qrexin receptor is required.<br>
The invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (T), or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the<br>
treatment or prophylaxis of diseases or disorders where an antagonist of a human Orexin<br>
receptor is required<br>
For use in therapy the compounds of the invention are usually administered as a<br>
pharmaceutical composition. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof,<br>
and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The compounds of formula (T) and then- pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives<br>
may be administered by any convenient method, e.g. by oral, parenteral, buccal, sublingual,<br>
nasal, rectal or transdennal administration, and the pharmaceutical-compositions adapted<br>
accordingly. '<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives<br>
which are active when given orally can be formulated as liquids or solids, e.g. as syrups,<br>
suspensions, emulsions, tablets, capsules or lozenges.<br>
A liquid formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the active<br>
ingredient hi a suitable liquid carriers) e.g. an aqueous solvent such as water, ethanol or<br>
glycerine, or a non-aqueous solvent, such as polyethylene glycol or an oil. The formulation<br>
may also contain a suspending agent, preservative, flavouring and/or colouring agent<br>
A composition in the form of a tablet can be prepared using any suitable<br>
pharmaceutical carrier(s) routinely used for preparing solid formulations, such as<br>
magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, sucrose and cellulose.<br>
A composition in the form of a capsule can be prepared using routine encapsulation<br>
procedures, e.g. pellets containing the active ingredient can be prepared using standard<br>
carriers and then filled into a hard gelatin capsule; alternatively a dispersion or suspension<br>
can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carriers), e.g. aqueous gums, celluloses,<br>
silicates or oils and the dispersion or suspension then filled into, a soft gelatin capsule.<br>
Typical parenteral compositions consist of a solution or suspension of the active<br>
ingredient in a sterile aqueous carrier or parenterally acceptable oil, e.g. polyethylene glycol,<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, lecithin, arachis oil or sesame oil. Alternatively, the solution can be<br>
lyophilised and then reconstituted with a suitable solvent just prior to administration.<br>
Compositions for nasal administration may conveniently be formulated as aerosols,<br>
drops, gels and powders. Aerosol formulations typically comprise a solution or fine<br>
suspension of the active ingredient in a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous or nonaqueous<br>
solvent and are usually presented in single or multidose quantities in sterile form in<br>
a sealed container which can take the form of a cartridge or refill for use with an atomising<br>
device. Alternatively the sealed container may be a disposable dispensing device such as a<br>
single dose nasal inhaler or an aerosol dispenser fitted with a metering valve. Where the<br>
dosage form comprises an aerosol dispenser, it will contain a propellant which can be a<br>
compressed gas e.g. air, or an organic propellant such as a fluorochlorohydrocarbon or<br>
hydrofluorocarbon. Aerosol dosage forms can also take the form of pump-atomisers.<br>
Compositions suitable for buccal or sublingual administration include tablets,<br>
lozenges and pastilles where the active ingredient is formulated with a carrier such as sugar<br>
and acacia, tragacanth, or gelatin and glycerin.<br>
Compositions for rectal administration are conveniently in the form of suppositories<br>
containing a conventional suppository base such as cocoa butter.<br>
Compositions suitable for transdermal administration include ointments, gels and<br>
patches.<br>
Preferably the composition is in unit dose form such as a tablet, capsule or ampoule.<br>
The dose of the compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative thereof, used in the treatment or prophylaxis of the abovementioned disorders or<br>
diseases will vary in the usual way with the particular disorder or disease being treated, the<br>
weight of the subject and other similar factors. However, as a general rule, suitable unit<br>
doses may be 0.05 to 1000 mg, more suitably 0.05 to 500 mg. Unit doses may be<br>
administered more than once a day for example two or three times a day, so that the total<br>
daily dosage is in the range of about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg; and such therapy may extend for a<br>
number of weeks or months. In the case of pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives the<br>
above figures are calculated as the parent compound of formula (I).<br>
No lexicological effects are indicated/expected when a compound of formula (I) is<br>
administered in the above mentioned dosage range.<br>
Human Orexin-A has the amino acid sequence:<br>
pyroGlu Pro Leu Pro Asp Cys Cys Arg Gin Lys Thr Cys Ser Cys Arg Leu<br>

Leu-NH2<br>
Orexin-A can be employed in screening procedures for compounds which inhibit the<br>
ligand's activation of the orexin-1 receptor.<br>
In general, such screening procedures involve providing appropriate cells which<br>
express the orexin-1 receptor on their surface. Such cells include cells from mammals,<br>
yeast, Drosophila or E. coll. In particular, a polynucleotide encoding the orexin-1 receptor<br>
is used to transfect cells to express the receptor. The expressed receptor is men contacted<br>
with a test compound and an orexin-1 receptor ligand to observe inhibition of a functional<br>
response. One such scieenmgprcK^ure involves the use of rnelanophores which are<br>
transfected to express the orexin-1 receptor, as described hi WO 92/01810. ~<br>
Another screening procedure involves introducing RNA encoding the orexin-1<br>
receptor.into Xenopus oocytes to transiently express the receptor. The receptor oocytes are<br>
then contacted with a receptor ligand and a test compound, followed by detection of<br>
inhibition of a signal hi the case of screening for compounds which are thought to inhibit<br>
activation of the receptor by the ligand.<br>
Another method involves screening for compounds which inhibit activation of the<br>
receptor by determining inhibition of binding of a labelled orexin-1 receptor ligand to cells<br>
which have the receptor on their surface. This method involves transfecting a eukaryotic<br>
cell with DNA encoding the orexin-1 receptor such that the cell expresses the receptor on its<br>
• surface and contacting the cell or cell membrane preparation with a compound in the<br>
presence of a labelled form of an orexin-1 receptor ligand. The ligand may contain a<br>
radioactive label. The amount of labelled ligand bound to the receptors is measured, e.g. by<br>
measuring radioactivity.<br>
Yet another screening technique involves the use of FLEPR equipment for high<br>
throughput screening of test compounds that inhibit mobilisation of intracellular calcium<br>
ions, or other ions, by affecting the interaction of an orexin-1 receptor ligand with the<br>
orexin-1 receptor.<br>

Determination of Orexin-1 Receptor Antagonist Activity<br>
The orexin-1 receptor antagonist activity of the compounds of formula (T) was<br>
determined in accordance with the following experimental method.<br>
Experimental Method<br>
CHO-DG44 cells expressing the human orexin-1 receptor were grown in cell<br>
medium (MEM medium with Earl's salts) containing 2 mM L-Glutamine, 0.4 mg/mL G418<br>
Sulphate from GEBCO BRL and 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum from Gibco BRL.<br>
The cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/100 /tlAvell into 96-well black clear bottom sterile<br>
plates from Costar which had been pre-coated with 10 /tg/well of poly-L-Iysine from<br>
SIGMA. The seeded plates were incubated overnight at 37C in 5% COa-<br>
Agonists were prepared as 1 mM stocks in watenDMSO (1:1). EC50 values (the<br>
concentration required to produce 50% maximal response) were estimated using 1 Ix half<br>
log unit dilutions (Biomek 2000, Beckman) in Tyrode's buffer containing probenecid (10<br>
mM HEPES with 145mM NaCl, lOmM glucose, 2.5 mM KC1,1.5 mM CaCl2,1.2 mM<br>
MgCl2 and 2.5mM probenecid; pH7.4). Antagonists were prepared as 10 mM stocks in<br>
DMSO (100%). Antagonist IC50 values (the concentration of compound needed to inhibit<br>
50% of the agonist response) were determined against 3.0 nM human orexin-A using 1 Ix<br>
half log unit dilutions in Tyrode's buffer containing 10% DMSO and probenecid.<br>
On the day of assay 50 fd of cell medium containing probenecid (Sigma) and<br>
FluoS AM (Texas Fluorescence Laboratories) was added (Quadra, Tomtec) to each well to<br>
give final concentrations of 25 mM and 4 /iM, respectively. The 96-well plates were<br>
incubated for 60 min at 37C in 5% CO2. The loading solution containing dye was then<br>
aspirated and cells were washed with 4x150 /il Tyrode's buffer containing probenecid and<br>
0.1% gelatin (Denley Cell Wash). The volume of buffer left in each well was 125 jil.<br>
Antagonist or buffer (25 /il) was added (Quadra) the cell plates gently shaken and incubated<br>
at 37C in 5% CQz for 30 minutes. Cell plates were then transferred to the Fluorescent<br>
Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices) instrument Prior to drug addition a<br>
single image of the cell plate was taken (signal test), to evaluate dye loading consistency.<br>
The run protocol used 60 images taken at 1 second intervals followed by a further 24 images<br>
at 5 second intervals. Agonists were added (by the FLIPR) after 20 seconds (during<br>
continuous reading). From each well, peak fluorescence was determined over the whole<br>
assay period and me mean of readings 1-19 inclusive was subtracted from this figure. The<br>
peak increase in fluorescence was plotted against compound concentration and iteranVely<br>
curve fitted using a four parameter logistic fit (as described by Bowen and Jerman, TIPS,<br>
1995,16,413-417) to generate a concentration effect value. Antagonist Kb values were<br>
calculated using the equation:<br>
Kb= IC50/(l+([3/EC50])<br>
where EC50 was the potency of human orexin-A detennined in the assay (in nM<br>
terms) and IC50 is expressed in molar terms.<br>
Compounds of Examples tested according to mis method had pKb values hi the<br>
range 6.7 - 9.7 at the human cloned orexiri-1 receptor.<br>
The orexin-2 receptor antagonist activity of me compounds of formula (I) was detennined in<br>
accordance with the following experimental method.<br>
Experimental Method<br>
CHO-DG44 cells expressing the human orexin-2 receptor were grown hi cell<br>
medium (MEM medium with Earl's salts) containing 2 mM L-Glutamine, 0.4 mg/mL G418<br>
Sulphate from GIBCO BRL and 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum from Gibco BRL.<br>
The cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/100 /ilAvell into 96-well black clear bottom sterile<br>
plates from Costar which had been pre-coated with 10 /tg/well of poly-I/-lysine from<br>
SIGMA. The seeded plates were incubated overnight at 37C in 5% CC^.<br>
Agonists were prepared as 1 mM stocks in watenDMSO (1:1). EC50 values (the<br>
concentration required to produce 50% maximal response) were estimated using 1 Ix half<br>
log unit dilutions (Biomek 2000, Beckman) hi Tyrode's buffer containing probenecid (10<br>
mM HEPES with 145mM NaCL lOmM glucose, 2.5 mM KCL. 1 -5 mM CaCl2,1.2 mM<br>
MgCl2 and 2.5mM probenecid; pH7.4). Antagonists were prepared as 10 mM stocks in<br>
DMSO (100%). Antagonist IC50 values (the concentration of compound needed to inhibit<br>
50% of the agonist response) were determined against 10.0 nM human orexin-A using 1 Ix<br>

give final concentrations of 2.5 mM and 4 /iM, respectively. The 96-well plates were<br>
incubated for 60 min at 37C hi 5% CQj. The loading solution containing dye was then<br>
aspirated and cells were washed with 4x150 [A Tyrode's buffer containing probenecid and<br>
0.1% gelatin (Denley Cell Wash). The volume of buffer left in each well was 125 fd.<br>
Antagonist or buffer (25 /d) was added (Quadra) the cell plates gently shaken and incubated<br>
at 37C in 5% COa for 30 min. Cell plates were then transferred to the Fluorescent Imaging<br>
Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices) instrument Prior to drug addition a single image<br>
of the cell plate was taken (signal test), to evaluate dye loading consistency. The run<br>
protocol used 60 images taken at 1 second intervals followed by a further 24 images at 5<br>
second intervals. Agonists were added (by the FUPR) after 20 sec (during continuous<br>
reading). From each well, peak fluorescence was determined over the whole assay period<br>
and the mean of readings 1-19 inclusive was subtracted from this figure. The peak increase<br>
in fluorescence was plotted against compound concentration and iteratively curve fitted<br>
using a four parameter logistic fit (as described by Bowen and Jerman, TiPS, 1995,16,413-<br>
417) to generate a concentration effect value. Antagonist Kb values were calculated using<br>
the equation:<br>
Kb=IC50/(l+([3/BC50])<br>
where EC50 was the potency of human orexin-A determined in the assay (in nM<br>
terms) and IC50 is expressed in molar terms.<br>
Compounds of Examples tested according to this method had pKb values in the range 
- 9.1 at the human cloned orexin-2 receptor.<br>
