				<td>This invention relates to an automised roaster, that roasts all types of articles with or without intermediate material. It basically consists of a main body, housing a totally insulated inner container in which the grains are rosted. It also houses a stirrer assembly unit which not only can rotate along its axis but also can move up and down linearly, driven by a motor. As the stirrer assembly moves up, the roasted grains accumulate at the bottom of the inner container, wherein an exist point is provided, manned by a door. Roasting of grains is taken care of by the flue gas from a burner provided tangential to the inner container. The profile of the flame way surrounding the inner container is such that its area goes on decreasing as we move from bottom to the top of the inner container and this has been found to be most ideal.</td>

This mvention relates to an IMPROVISED AUTOMATIC SANDLESS BATCH ROASTER.<br>
This IMPROVISED AUTOMATIC SANDLESS BATCH ROASTER can roast all types of particles, either with the intermediate material or without the intermediate material. This Improvised Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster is totally automised and requires minimal unskilled labour. This Machine is of batch type production, ensures uniform heating of the particles. Further, the roasting container is not exposed to the atmosphere, thereby making the operation hygenic. This Improvised Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster is compact in size and as such occupies less space. The stirrer derives rotatmg power from the motor adjusted to suit the required torque and rpm. Further, temperature controller is coupled to the burner, which controls the roasting of the particles to the required temperature and thus also saves fuel. Provision has been made in the Control Panel to control the roasting time also.<br>
This IMPROVISED AUTOMATIC SANDLESS BATCH ROASTER basically consists of a Main Body (2) housing an Inner Container (3), which is well insulated by Insulation Material (5), such as Fire Bricks Wool etc., well designed to contain the flame around the inner container. A Burner (7) is positioned tangential to the Inner Container as substantially shown in the accompanying Drawing. A Passage (6) for the flame way is provided all around the outer of the inner container Inlet Funnel (1) is fixed to the top of the Main Body, through which the particles to be roasted are fed. A Bottom Door (8) is provided at the bottom of the inner container, through which the roasted particles exit. A handle (9) is provided to open and close the exit door.<br><br>
stirrer blades (4) along with the stirrer pipe (11) is mounted along with the stirrer housmg (15) above the inner container. Stirrer Shaft (14) is inserted into the stirrer Pipe (11) and a slot (17) on this stirrer pipe helps to rotate the pipe with the shaft and also facilitates upward and downward movements. The Stirrer Pipe and Door Handle (9) are linked through a Connecting Pipe(16). This provision helps in opening the door automatically as and when the rotating stirrer moves upwards and vice-versa, A Control panel (10) is provided with automatic lime and temperature control gadgets along with a stabilizer, a contactor and motor switches. A Motor (13) is provided at the lop, which drives the stirrer rod to the required rpm through a suitable pulley. A Flue Gas Outlet Pipe (12) ensures the safe exit of the flue gases.<br>
The particles to be roasted i,e., grains in this case are fed to the Inner Container through the Inlet Funnel Owing to the force exerted by the stirrer, the grains are made to strike against the Inner Wall of the Inner Container. The flame from the burner passes through the flame way and surrounds the outer of the Inner Container heating the container and consequently roasting the grains. The temperature and the time controlling gadgets provided on the Control Panel, take care of the prescribed parameters. Once the required temperature is reached and the grains have been roasted to suffice the requirement, the movement of the stirrer in the upward direction facilitates the gathering of the roasted grains at the bottom of the Inner Container, ready for exit, once the bollom door (8) gives way. A Voltage stabilizer is provided in the Control Panel to take care of the Voltage fluctuations. As the arrangement in the said Improvised Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster is for roasting without intermediate material roasting with intermediate material is also possible by providing a perforated assembly to separate grains from intermediate material at the outlet end.<br><br>
In the conventional pan roasting method, after the roasting of the grains and the intermediate material, the operation has to be stopped to separate the roasted grains from the intermediate material by using a mesh, manually. In such cases, uniform heating of the grains is not ensured. Consequent to which, each grain particle gets heated to a different degree, which has been overcome to a great extent in this Improvised Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster. Further, in this Improvised Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster, we can vary the roasting time depending upon the moisture content in the grain. In the conventional systems, roasting depends upon the skill of the operator and many a times these are chances that the grains get over-roasted. This draw back has been overcome to a great extent in this Improvised Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster.<br>
A significant draw-back in the Continuous type Roaster is that the exit of all the roasted grains from the heating zone I not simultaneous as in the case of batch-type roaster and is in the form of a queue. Consequently, there is a time lag. When taken to the Crushing Section, between the first grain and the last grain that have left the Roaster, as the first grain that exits would have collected at the bottom of the collection container and the last grain in that exits at the top of the collection container. This gestation period owing to the non-simultaneous exit of the roasted grains adversely affects the crushing quality, which has been overcome in this Improvised Automatic Sandless Batch Roaster.<br>
The Flame Way surrounding the Inner Container is crucial for the etTiciency of the system and it has been tried out and established that a flame way whose area goes on decreasing as we move up from the bottom to the top of the Inner Container is the most suitable to maximise the heatine and consequently a profile of the flame way surrounding the Inner Container as shown in the accompanying drawings is preferred.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim,<br>
1.	An Improvised automatic Sandless Batch Roaster, basically consisting of a Main Body, housing an Inner Container in which the Particles/grains are roasted, which in turn accommodates a stirrer-blade stirrer-pipe assembly, which not only rotates along their axis, but also can move up and down linearly by virtue of their engagement with the stirrer shaft, which derives its rotary motion from a motor-pulley arrangement and as the stirrer-blade stirrer-pipe assembly moves up, the roasted particles/grains collect at the bottom of the Inner Container, where an exit point for the roasted grains is provided, manned by a door, provided with a handle, either to open or close the door, the stirrer pipe and the handle being linked by a connecting rod in order to synchronize the movements; roasting of the particles/grains being taken care by the flue gas from the burner provided tangential to the Inner Container and at 90 degrees from the axis of the stirrer shaft.<br>
2.
