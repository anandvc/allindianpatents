				<td>SAFETY COVER FOR THE NEEDLE OF INTRAVENOUS CATHETER APPARATUS<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a Safety Cover for the needle of Intravenous (IV) Catheter Apparatus. In particular this invention provides Safety Cover for covering the needle of I.V.Catheter Apparatus after cannulation, prior to the needle being disposed off, which prevents accidental pricking of the used needle of IV Catheter Apparatus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
An IV Catheter Apparatus is used to inject medicines, glucose and other nourishment in liquid form, into the blood stream of patients during their treatment. Such IV Catheter Apparatus is known from the prior art and permit the inlet of different media flow during the treatment of the patient. After the needle along with flexible catheter of IV catheter is inserted in the vein of the patient and blood enters the IV Catheter Set, the needle is withdrawn from the vein. The flexible Catheter portion continues to remain in the vein to inject medicines, glucose and other nourishment in liquid form into the blood stream of patient. After the needle is withdrawn from the vein it needs to be disposed off. If the used needle is not covered with some protective device on its tip, it can prick anyone who comes in contact including medical professionals and people in-charge of disposal of hospital waste. If the used needle pricks any person it is dangerous and at times can be fatal as the needle may be infected by blood borne diseases like Hepatitis B, AIDS etc. In view of the foregoing a safety device is necessitated to cover the tip of the needle while disposing it to prevent accidental pricking.<br>
The prior arts recognize that a safety device or tip guard is placed upon the tip of the needle after the needle is withdrawn from the catheter. The prior arts have few disadvantages: (i) Safety device are miniature devices in the prior art which requires advanced technology to manufacture which makes the manufacturing costly (ii) there is chance that blood on or near the needle tip may surface out of the safety device as the size of safety device is small (iii) the safety device in prior art covers only the tip of the needle while it may be noted that as the needle is inserted upto certain length in the vein of a patient during cannulation, the infection in all probability is spread along the length of the needle not completely covered by miniature safety device. In view of the above the prior arts fail to provide complete protection from spread of infection, (iv) In prior arts the safety device is provided as an additional part fitted to the main body of IV Catheter Apparatus which increases the cost of the apparatus and makes the main body bulky (v) To allow the safety device to function, the needle is pinched near its tip which invariably decreases the area of needle internal bore thus delaying the flash back of blood. This creates confusion among the paramedic staff performing cannulation.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Primary object of this invention is to propose a Safety Cover for needle of the IV Catheter Apparatus which covers the needle to ensure safe disposal of the needle of the IV Catheter Apparatus after cannulation i.e. after needle is used.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a Safety Cover for needle of the IV Catheter Apparatus in which the disadvantages of prior art are overcome.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a Safety Cover for the needle of the I.V. Catheter Apparatus, which covers the needle externally, and can be<br>
separated from the IV Catheter Apparatus before cannulation, which makes the device simple and less bulky.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose Safety Cover for the needle of IV Catheter Apparatus, which completely covers the needle, from its base to its tip.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose Safety Cover for the needle of IV Catheter Apparatus which prevents the spread of infection more effectively as the whole needle remains completely within the safety cover.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose Safety Cover for the needle of IV Catheter Apparatus, which require simplified technology for production which makes it cost effective and readily available.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a Safety Cover for the needle of IV Catheter Apparatus which covers the needle in assembled position before use as well as it covers the needle after cannulation, thus performs dual functions and making it more economical to manufacture.<br>
To the accomplishment of above and to such further objects as may hereinbelow appear, the present invention relates to safety cover for IV sets as described in the following specification and as considered with the accompanying drawings.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
An Intravenous Catheter Apparatus in assembled condition prior to use, includes a needle covered by the safety cover. The assembly of needle attached to needle hub has catcher on either sides. The Safety Cover which has two legs have a slit or window on each leg. To proceed, first the Safety Cover is removed and the needle is taken out. The needle along with catheter is inserted<br>
into the vein of a patient. When the blood in the vein of patient flashes into the catheter and reach the flash back chamber, the needle is withdrawn from the vein. The catheter continues to remain in the vein for injecting medicines, glucose and other nourishment. The needle is replaced into the safety cover after withdrawal from vein<br>
The size of window of safety cover and catcher of needle hub is such that catcher can enter the window. To engage the two, the needle hub is held in one hand and Safety Cover in other hand. The needle tip is carefully guided in the Safety Cover in such a manner that the catcher of needle hub and window of Safety Cover are in same line. On further insertion of needle inside the Safety Cover, the catcher is pressed against respective window on each side such that catcher enters the window with snap action and expands/projects outwardly. As a result the catcher and window on either side of needle hub are interlocked. After the interlocking is attained, the needle cannot be pulled out or come out of the Safety Cover. The assembly of Safety Cover, needle &amp; needle hub is now safe to handle and dispose off without any risk of needle pricking anybody and thereby prevents spreading of infection.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 show an intravenous (IV) catheter apparatus 10 of the present invention. The IV catheter apparatus is viewed as a finished product prior to use and includes a needle cover 12, a wing housing 14, having wings 50, a port having a cap 16 in unitary assembly with the wing housing 14, a needle hub 18 attached to the wing housing 14 and a flash back chamber 24 attached to needle hub 18 which ends in luer lock 52. The needle hub 18 has catcher 36 at it's base on either side.<br>
As seen in the cross section depicted in Figure 2, a needle 20 extends from the needle hub 18 through the wing housing 14 and ends in a needle tip 22 under the needle cover 12.<br>
The needle 20 is hollow and the needle tip 22 is cut diagonally. When the needle tip 22 is inserted into vein of a patient the needle 20 encounters fluid pressure and the blood gushes through the needle tip 22 into the needle 20 and reaches the flash back chamber 24 through the wing housing 14. Surrounding the needle 20 is a catheter 26 that is attached to the wing housing 14 by catheter base 28. The catheter 26 is a flexible tube that will remain in the vein of user/patient to provide fluids, nourishment, or medicines. The safety cover 12 extends from needle tip 22 till base of port having cap 16 covering the catheter base 28 and part of wing housing 14 excluding the wing housing chamber 30. Inner radius of the safety cover 12 and outer radius of catheter base 28 is such<br>
that the safety cover 12 fits tightly over the catheter base 28 in assembly of IV sets before the use of it by the Paramedical.<br>
Figure 3 represent safety cover 12 separated from IV set 10. Safety cover 12 is cylindrical tube 62 closed at end 54 while the open end 56 formed in 'U' shape having two legs 32. Each leg 32 has a rectangular window 34. The inner walls of each leg 32 has ribs 60 which hold tightly the catheter base 28 of IV set 10 in assembled state (i.e. Figure 2). The "U" shape of legs 32 enables them to flex which helps in working of Safety Cover 12.<br>
The needle 20 and the catheter 26 are inserted into the body of patient by holding at the wing housing 14 and pushing at needle hub 18. After the needle 20 reaches vein, the blood gushes into the needle 20 and reach the flash back chamber 24. The needle 20 is than pulled out of the vein of the patient. The needle 20 is withdrawn by grasping the wing housing 14 and pulling upon the needle hub 18 such that the needle 20 move out of the catheter 26 and consequently out of wing housing 14.<br>
Figure 4 represent assembly separated from wing housing 14 after use of IV set 10 consisting needle 20, needle hub 18 and flash back chamber 24. The needle hub 18 at it's base on either side has catchers 36.<br>
Figure 5A to 5D represent stages of assembling the safety cover 12 and used needle 20. The needle tip 22 is inserted in open end 56 of safety cover 12 by holding at needle hub 18 and flash back chamber 24 such that the needle 20 enters the safety cover 12. When the entire needle 20 enters the safety cover 12, it is rotated about the axis 6-6 till each window 34 on either legs 32 gets aligned along one catcher 36 on either side of needle hub 18.<br>
Now the safety cover 12 is pressed against the catcher 36. The legs 32 encounter obstruction from ramp 38 of catcher 36 as seen in Figure 5 A<br>
Figure 6 represent lateral three dimensional view of figure 5 A. As seen, the needle 20 is completely inside the safety cover 12 while the ramp 38 of catcher 36 abuts the leg 32. Figure 6 A is enlarged view of Section 8 of Figure 6. Since the legs 32 are made flexible, they expand outwardly as in figure 5 B such that the legsw 32 ride through the ramps 38 on either catcher 36 such that needle hub 18 enter open end 56 of safety cover 12. The catchers 36 on being further pushed against leg 32, enter the window 34 with snap action, thereafter, the legs 32 fall back such that outer diameter of leg 32 is reduced. Now the reverse taper 40 of legs 32 abut the lug 42 of needle hub 18 and the undercut 46 of catcher 36 abuts the side of window 34.<br>
Figure 5 C represent the leg 32 riding through the tip 48 of catcher 36 whereas Figure 5 D represent the interlocking of catcher 36 and window 34 on either side of needle hub 18.<br>
Figure 7 is three dimensional view of figure 5D wherein the needle hub 18 is settled between the two legs 32 of safety cover 12 while the needle 20 is completely covered by cylindrical tube 62. The interlocking of window 34 and catcher 36 is more evident from Figure 7 A.<br>
Thus the needle 20 does not travel further inside the safety cover 12. The needle 20 cannot now be pulled out of the safety cover 12 as the catcher 36 expands/projects outwards the window 34 such that reverse collect 44 abuts the side of window 34. Thus the catcher 36 and window 34 are interlocked and the whole assembly of safety cover 12, needle 20, needle hub 18 and flash back chamber 24 is safe for disposal such that the needle 20 does not prick any person who subsequently comes in contact with the assembly.<br>
The invention as been shown and described above with the preferred embodiments, and it is understood that many modifications, substitutions, and additions may be made which are within the intended spirit and scope of the invention. In the foregoing, it can be seen that the present invention accomplishes at least all of its stated objectives.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
