FAST REACQUISITION AFTER LONG SLEEP IN SLOTTED MODE OPERATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/391,939, filed June 28,2002, the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present application relates to wireless communication systems, and more particularly to improving standby time of a mobile station utilizing sleep until<br>
handoff.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Wireless communication systems may operate using fixed infrastructure equipment or in ad-hoc configurations. In fixed infrastructure models, wireless communication systems typically comprise a plurality of base stations and mobile stations that communicate using an over-the-air communication protocol using physical layer technologies such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology.<br>
[0004] Wireless communications systems such as CDMA typically operate using a variety of channels. In CDMA, for example, channelization is accomplished using orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal codes. Different channels generally have different purposes. Common channels are used to communicate to a plurality of mobile stations or base stations at the same time while dedicated channels are typically used for communication to and from one mobile station.<br><br>
[0005] In a CDMA-equipped system, a mobile station communicates with any one or more of a plurality of base stations dispersed in a geographic region. Each base station continuously transmits a pilot signal having the same spreading code but with a different code phase offset. Phase offset allows the pilot signals to be distinguished from one another, which in turn allows the base stations to be distinguished. Furthermore, a mobile station can measure the signal-to-noise of each pilot signal, which indicates the pilot's relative signal strength.<br>
[0006] In wireless systems, the ability to minimize power consumption in a mobile station is important. Slotted paging systems provide the ability for a mobile station to conserve power by not monitoring paging messages for a duration of time. Thus, the mobile station can sleep when paging messages are not being demodulated. Paging messages contain information about a base station including neighbor lists. Power consumption in the mobile station can further be minimized in a slotted paging system if the signal is acquired prior to the paging slot,<br>
[0007] A hybrid Access Terminal may monitor multiple systems, such as one system for voice communications and a second system for data communications. In particular, hybrid systems using slotted paging can benefit because of increased sleep time resulting in less power consumption in the mobile station.<br>
[0008] What is needed is a system that minimizes the amount of time monitoring on the second system while still providing "instant on" access when desired.<br>
SUMMARY [0009] The mobile station is in the sleep mode until just prior to a designated slot. Upon wakeup, the mobile station ensures a link is maintained with the network by<br><br>
measuring the strength of several pilots. If a neighbor pilot is stronger than the current pilots, a handoff is performed After handoff, the Control Channel Capsule (CCC) may be demodulated by the mobile station to obtain new overhead information, such as neighbor pilots. If no handoff is performed, the reacquisition slew for the current pilot is measured and fed back to the sleep controller to determine the next wake-up time. If the mobile station does not receive a page, the mobile station returns to sleep mode.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] Figure 1 illustrates components of an exemplary wireless communication system. A mobile switching center 102 communicates with base stations 104a-104k (only one connection shown). The base stations 104a-104k (generally 104) broadcasts data to and receives data from mobile stations 106 within cells 108a-108k (generally 108). The cell 108 is a geographic region, roughly hexagonal, having a radius of up to 35 kilometers or possibly more.<br>
[0018] A mobile station 106 is capable of receiving data from and transmitting data to a base station 104. In one embodiment, the mobile station 106 receives and transmits data according to the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) standard. CDMA is a communication standard permitting mobile users of wireless communication devices to exchange data over a telephone system wherein radio signals carry data to and from the wireless devices.<br>
[0019] Under the CDMA standard, additional cells 108a, 108c, 108d, and 108e adjacent to the cell 108b permit mobile stations 106 to cross cell boundaries without interrupting communications. This is so because base stations 104a, 104c, 104d, and 104e in adjacent cells assume the task of transmitting and receiving data for the mobile stations 106. The mobile switching center 102 coordinates all communication to and from mobile stations 106 in a multi-cell region. Thus, the mobile switching center 102 may communicate with many base stations 104.<br>
[0020] Mobile stations 106 may move about freely within the cell 108 while communicating either voice or data. Mobile stations 106 not in active communication with other telephone system users may, nevertheless, scan base station 104 transmissions<br><br>
in the cell 108 to detect any telephone calls or paging messages directed to the mobile station 106.<br>
[0021] One example of such a mobile station 106 is a cellular telephone used by a pedestrian who, expecting a telephone call, powers on the cellular telephone while walking in the cell 108. The cellular telephone scans certain frequencies (i.e., frequencies known to be used by CDMA) to synchronize communication with the base station 104. The cellular telephone then registers with the mobile switching center 102 to make itself known as an active user within the CDMA network.<br>
[0022] When detecting a call, the cellular telephone scans data frames broadcast by the base station 104 to detect any telephone calls or paging messages directed to the cellular telephone. In this call detection mode, the cellular telephone receives, stores, and examines paging message data, and determines whether the data contains a mobile station identifier matching an identifier of the cellular telephone. If a match is detected, the cellular telephone establishes a call with the mobile switching center 102 via the base station 104. If no match is detected, the cellular telephone enters an idle state for a predetermined period of time, and then exits the idle state to receive another transmission of paging message data.<br>
[0023] Figure 2 illustrates a mobile station 106 according to one embodiment of the disclosed subject matter. The mobile station 106 includes a processor 200, memory 205, and a receiver 210. The receiver 210 may be a transceiver capable of receiving and transmitting a plurality of signals over the wireless communication system. The processor 200 is configured to activate and deactivate the receiver at designated times, as well as process the signals received by the receiver 210. The memory 205 stores<br><br>
information, and can either receive information from, or supply information to the processor 200.<br>
[0024] Figure 3 isan example of a hybrid wireless network 300 capable of voice and data communications. In the hybrid wireless network 300, the mobile station 106 communicates with a base station 305 connected to a combination voice and data network and a base station 310 connected to a data network. The wireless network can utilize any format for the voice and data communications. For example, CDMA 2000 can be used for the voice communications and lxev, otherwise known as High Data Rate (HDR) can be used for data communications. The base station 305 connected to a voice network is linked to a packet data serving node (PDSN) 315 for data communications and is also linked to the phone company 320 for voice or voice and data communications. The PDSN 315 is connected to both the phone company 320 and the Internet 330. The phone company S20 may be connected to a Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) 322 for voice communication. The base station 310 connected to the data network is linked to a PDSN 325, which in turn in connected to the Internet 330. Monitoring both the voice and data systems causes the mobile station to use approximately twice the amount of power than, monitoring only a single system. This increased power usage significantly reduces the battery life.<br>
[0025] To save power, there are many times when it is not necessary to monitor one of the .two systems, so that system is handec over to the other system. For purposes of illustration, the system that is handed over will be assumed to be the second system, or the data system. Of course, it may by any system that is handed over. Although it is not necessary to monitor the second system, it is desirable to ensure fast access. By receiving pilot signals but only demodulating the pilot signals after handoff, "instant on" access<br><br>
may be provided for the second system. Utilizing "Sleep Until HandofT can therefore be used to continue monitoring the second system and still have "instant on" access, but also significantly reducing power consumption.<br>
[0026] Overhead information changes infrequently, and does not need to be received more than once from any pilot. If no handoff is required, the mobile station may return to sleep. If a handoff is required, the CCC may be monitored to obtain overhead information (such as a neighbor list) for the new pilot. When the data session is transferred to the voice session, the mobile station does not need to monitor the CCC for pages, as none will be coming. Thus, the mobile station may return to sleep mode (low power consumption) faster, resulting in a shorter awake (high power consumption) time. Because the mobile station still monitors the neighbor pilot strengths, and will handoff from pilot to pilot as the mobile station moves through the network, the system is immediately available when needed, and gives the appearance of always on.<br>
[0027] Using "Sleep Until Handoff," the mobile station is in the sleep mode until just prior to a designated slot. Upon wakeup, the mobile station ensures a link is maintained with the network by measuring the strength of several pilots. If a neighbor pilot is stronger than the current pilot, a handoff is performed. After handoff, the Control Channel Capsule (CCC) may be demodulated by the mobile station to obtain new overhead information, such as neighbor pilots. If no handoff is performed, the reacquisition slew for the current pilot is measured and fed back to the sleep controller to determine the next wake-up time. The mobile station then returns to sleep mode.<br>
[0028] If the mobile station is not moving and is approximately equal distance between a plurality of base stations, it is possible that the mobile station may try to continually handoff between the base stations. To save power, the mobile station may<br><br>
cache overhead information and obtain the necessary handoff information from the cache rather that demodulating the pilot signal.<br>
[0029] Figure 4 illustrates the process 400 of utilizing the sleep until handoff of the mobile station 106. The process 400 begins in a START state 405. Proceeding to block 410, the mobile station 106 transfers the monitoring of the second system to the first system. By transferring the monitoring of the second system, the mobile station 106 does not need to monitor the CCC for pages, as none will be coming. Because only one system is now monitored, the mobile station 106 may enter the sleep mode more quickly.<br>
[0030] Proceeding to block 415, the mobile station 106 enters the sleep mode. In the sleep mode, most operations of the mobile station are shut off, thereby reducing power consumption. The longer the mobile station 106 remains in the sleep mode, the battery life of the mobile station 106 increases. Thus, it is desirable to have the mobile station 106 remain in the sleep mode as much as possible.<br>
[0031] Proceeding to block 420, the mobile station 106 wakes up at a designated time and measures the strengths of the pilot signals. The reacquisition slew determines when the mobile station wakes up to process the pilot signals at a designated slot. The mobile station 106 wakes up prior to a designated slot and checks the pilot signals. The relative strengths of the pilot signals may be measured to determine if a handoff is<br>
needed.<br>
[0032] Proceeding to block 425, the mobile station 106 determines if a handoff is needed. Typically, if a neighboring pilot signal is stronger than the current pilot signal, a handoff to that neighbor would be desirable. Thus, the processor of the mobile station 106 compares the relative strength of the measured pilot signals, and if a signal other that the current pilot signal has the highest power, a handoff is warranted and the process 400<br><br>
proceeds along the YES branch to block 430. In block 430, the pilot signal is demodulated to obtain overhead information such as the channel list and a new list of neighbors. The signal is only demodulated following a handoff, thereby allowing the mobile station 106 to enter the sleep mode faster if no handoff is necessary.<br>
[0033] Proceeding to block 435, the overhead information is stored in the memory of the mobile station 106. This information may be used if the mobile station 106 is stationary and is approximately equal distance between two base stations. The mobile station may cache this overhead information in memory and obtain the necessary information for the handoff from the cache memory rather than demodulating the pilot signal. After storing the overhead information, the process 400 returns to block 415 where the mobile station 106 reenters the sleep mode.<br>
[0034] Returning to block 425, if the current pilot signal remains the strongest, no handoff is necessary and the process 400 proceeds along the NO branch to block 445. In block 445, the reacquisition slew is measured for the current pilot signal. The reacquisition slew is used to inform the mobile station 106 when it next needs to check the pilot signals. After determining when it next needs to wake up, the mobile station 106 returns to the sleep mode in block 415.<br>
[0035] Figure 5 is a timing diagram showing the timing of the voice session, the data session, and a hybrid of the two. In the voice session, the mobile station 106 is activated periodically for a predetermined period of time as indicated at 505. In the data session, the mobile station 106 is also activated periodically for a predetermined period of time as indicated at 510. When the mobile station 106 monitors both systems, the mobile station 106 activates during each of the predetermined time periods 505, 510, resulting in the mobile station being active quite frequently.<br><br>
[0036] Figure 6 is a timing diagram showing the timing of the voice session, the data session, and a hybrid of the two using the disclosed method. In the hybrid session, the receiver of the mobile station 106 is turned off prior to the slot when monitoring the data session. Thus, the period of time 610 the mobile station 106 monitors the data session is significantly shorter than the period of time 510. This allows the mobile station to reenter the sleep mode sooner, thereby consuming less power.<br>
