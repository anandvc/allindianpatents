				<td>Technical Field<br>
[001J The present invention relates to an overload protector having an explosion prevention structure, and more particularly, to an overload protector having an explosion prevention structure which can prevent an explosion of surrounding flammable gas or steam that is caused by arc leakages occurring when contacts provided inside the protector are switched on/off due to the occurrence of an overload or abnormal operation of a compressor motor.<br>
Background Art<br>
[002] Generally, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 5, an overload protector 1 is briefly composed of a main body part 10 and a cover part 20 detachably coupled to the main body part.<br>
[003] The main body part 10 includes a main body 11 having a plurality of recessed portions 11a and an opening hole (not illustrated), an external connection terminal 12 provided on one side of the main body and electrically connectable to an external power supply, a heater coil 13 accommodated in the recessed portion 1 la provided in the center of the main body 11 and having one end portion thereof electrically connected to the external connection terminal 12, a movable arm 14 having a fixed end portion thereof electrically connected to the other end portion of the heater coil and a movable contact 14a provided at a free end thereof, a bimetal disk 15 provided in a center portion of the main body 11 located between the heater coil 13 and the movable arm 14, and a fixed contact support 16 provided on one side of the main body 11 corresponding to the movable contact 14a of the movable arm 14 and having a fixed contact 16a provided on one side of an upper portion thereof (See FIG. 2).<br>
[004] The cover part 20 includes a cover 21 having a fixing pin 21a detachably fixed in an opening hole (not illustrated) of the main body part 10 and a connector accommodation portion 21b formed on an upper portion thereof, and a pin connector 22 detachably fitted into the connector accommodation portion 21 b of the cover and having one end portion thereof electrically connected to the fixed contact support 16 of the main body 11 and the other end portion thereof electrically connectable to a corresponding terminal pin of a compressor motor (not illustrated) (See FIG. 2).<br>
[005] Also, on one portion of a side wall of the overload protector 1 that is composed of the main body part 10 and the cover part 20, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, an opening la is<br><br>
further formed, in which an outer end portion 16b of the fixed contact support 16 is extended in a direction perpendicular to horizontal surfaces of the main body 11 and the cover 21. The opening la is formed on both side walls of the main body 11 and the cover 21 of the overload protector 1.<br>
[006] However, the outer end portion 16b of the fixed contact support 16 and the opening la of the main body 11 have a gap formed therebetween. Accordingly, in the case where the overload protector 1 is installed on a compressor (not illustrated), there exists a great anxiety that arc, which is generated between the movable contact 14a of the movable arm 14 and the fixed contact 16a of the fixed contact support 16 when the contacts 14a and 16a are switched on/off, leaks to an outside through the gap between the opening la of the main body 11 and the outer end portion 16b of the fixed contact support 16, to cause an explosion of surrounding flammable gas or steam.<br>
