FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention in general relates to multi function peripherals (MFP) more specifically printers. Further, this invention encompasses a method to manage print jobs in the queue of a printer using the printer alone without requiring the use of a PC if the user has authorization login access More particularly, this invention relates to a system and method to display and manage print job information using a display panel in the MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
In big organizations, a common network printer is used across the floor and all the people on the floor make use of the same printer for printing documents. Sometimes there are situations when one person needs to get a printout urgently while someone else is printing a large document. Hence one needs to check the job origin from the spooler window on the PC in order to put the larger printing job on hold to print the more urgent job. Also, print queues can be currently managed only from the PC.<br>
Presently, the user has to check the spooler window from PC to ascertain the origin of the job and has no option to cancel the jobs of other users present in the job queue if the user does not have administrative privileges.<br><br>
The print queue shows list of the documents which are in queue for printing. For each item or job on the list, information, such as the print status and number of pages, is provided. The following table shows the information displayed for each document in the queue:<br><br>
A user may pause, resume, or cancel printing of a document; restart printing of a document; or may view and change job settings, such as the priority and the person notified when the job is done. For the documents waiting in queue for printing, the same can be viewed, but the settings such as the page orientation, paper source, number of copies etc. cannot be changed.<br><br>
For managing the queue, user has to:<br>
1.	Open Printers window<br>
2.	Double-click the printer which is being used, which opens the print<br>
queue or click the printer icon on System tray if the user has submitted a print job<br>
And then check or change the priority or delete the print job or click pause or resumes if the job is paused etc.<br>
For doing each operation the user has to log on to the personnel computer and then make the changes. However the proposed invention shall provide a method to manage the printer queue as well as see the origin of the job on the printer panel itself and then can make the changes accordingly.<br>
US Patent no. 6,667,810 details about the general job which could be delayed fax (i.e. the fax which is to be sent after time set by the user) which is saved into the memory and other current jobs are being sent. Hence the status of such jobs is being discussed and alert mails are sent for the status of the job to the user. Also the US Patent No. 6,667,810 states that the user/manager can view if any jobs are pending and allows a notification /facility to delete. It talks about a menu being displayed allowing to delete the job.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br><br>
For managing and editing the documents to be printed, the user has to log on to the PC from which the document originated. Standing at the printer, one cannot get to know the origin of the current print job in process. There is no such option available to manage the print queue from the printer itself<br>
Further, any amendment to the print queue itself such as pause, resume, cancel, etc cannot be done at the printer itself.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to invent a method and system to display and manage print queue and display job origin information on LCD panel.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method to facilitate the management of the print queue from the printer itself.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method to easily identify the origin of the current print job by displaying the owner information on the LCD panel of the printer.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a method to provide information about the amount of job left or printed job information in percentage on the LCD so that the user can get an idea of the approximate time required to complete the print job.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method and system to display and manage print queue and display job origin information on the LCD or any display panel of the printer. This invention is targeted at controlling the printer queue and to view the origin of the print job on the printer LCD or display pane) itself rather than on the personal computer to which the printer is connected. There are many situations where the user wants to control the print queue from the printer itself. The situation could be when the printer is shared in any organization and a specific user has to go a long way to collect his print out. There is a possibility that the printer could be busy with printing some other document and the specific user has to wait for a long time to get his printing done But if the option of managing the print queue is available on the printer either through dedicated button or from administrative menu, the user can change the priority or reshuffle print jobs in order to get the printing done on priority.<br>
This invention also provides for information on the time left for the present print to complete and also information on the already printed jobs in percentage type representation on the LCD panel of the printer so that the user can get an idea of the approximate time required to complete the print job<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a system to display and manage print job<br>
information using a display panel in the MFP comprising:<br>
1.  an input unit, having plurality of keys to input commands from a user;<br><br>
2.	authentication means for authenticating the user for managing a print queue;<br>
3.	print unit, which prints the printing data;<br>
where the said display in the MFP is controlled by a display unit and the said management of the print job is controlled by a control unit characterized in that the control unit receives printing information about a page currently being printed and manages the print queue associated with the MFP based on the received information and the said display unit act as a user interface for the said print queue management.<br>
When the MFP receives a print job the said MFP receives information about the job origin and display the said information on the display unit. The user views and manages the print queue using the display unit and the input unit. The control unit receives from the printer information about the total number of pages of a job which is included in a header of the printing data and reschedules the job according to the reorganized print queue set by the user. The incoming print jobs are stored in an order, in an intermediate storage location, which is manageable by the user.<br>
Accordingly, this invention also explains a method to display and manage print job information using a display panel in the MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
1.	checking for a login interrupt by a user;<br>
2.	authenticating a user for managing a print queue if there is a login interrupt;<br><br>
3. controlling the display of the MFP by a display unit; and controlling the said management of the print job by a control unit characterized in that the control unit receives printing information about a page currently being printed and manages the print queue associated with the MFP based on the received information and the said display unit act as a user interface for the said print queue management.<br>
The user inputs command for rescheduling the print job in print queue where a print handler identifies the current job being printed and a last page is printed. A scheduled new job is printed by a print handler putting the remaining current job to the print queue and after adding a separator page in the print output. The user can resume the rescheduled job after printing the new scheduled job. The information about the amount of job left or printed job information in percentage is provided on the display panel of the display unit. The printer handler causes a separator page to be printed to separate the print jobs in the print queue sent by the said printer handler for printing. A dedicated button or an administrative menu is used which prompts for user authorization to manage the print queue.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the innovation. Numerous specific details are described to provide a through understanding of the present invention. However in certain instances well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br><br>
The present invention provides a system and method to display and manage the print queue on the printer hardware using the display device on the printer and the set of keys available at the printer, so that user can ascertain the origin of each print job on the print queue and the status of each job- Presently the user has to log on to the computer to which the printer is connected in order to check the status of the job as the print spooler is on the PC ! he present invention will help the user to ascertain the position of their print job in the print queue. There would be a provision to reshuffle the print queue if the user has permission to do so. Hence, the total management of any print job in the print queue can be done on the printer hardware itself which was not possible till now.<br>
A US Patent No. 6,641,312 deals with storing user ID/ Application information / Printer driver features or print usage information into a non volatile memory present in the printer hardware. This information can be printed with some methods detailed in the invention description section, it talks mostly about the memory storage type and data stored in the memory store and executing/ creation of print job.<br>
Whereas the present invention is to display the print queue on the printer hardware so that user can get to know the origin of each print job in the queue and the status of the job. This will help the user to know the position of their job in the print queue. There would be a provision to reshuffle the print queue if the user has permission to do so. The US Patent No. 6,641,312 talks of memory unit where user information is stored. If such information is just stored and not<br><br>
displayed it is of no use. The present invention will provide for displaying details such as origin of the job, percentage of job left etc on the printer display which can be viewed by the user at any time.<br>
Another US Patent No. 6,587,126 discusses in general about the job and the process types. Here the jobs pending for particular apparatus when selected are displayed according to the process type selection. This patent, further, talks about the ability to control various printer apparatus by selecting them. This is equivalent of print spool manager available on the HOST PCs. Subsequently it talks about some mail transmission which is not related to this invention.<br>
Whereas the present invention allows controlling of the print job from the printer itself which is absent in the above patent. It is especially useful in large office setups where a single printer is shared amongst many users. After a user fires a print job and goes to collect the print and if his job is not finished yet or printed then to manage/view the print queue the user is required to go again to his/her workstation and check the printer queue for his/her job status. The present invention will allow the user to do the same at ihe printer itself after authentication using the printer display and the keys on the printer. The present invention allows for the print queue to be displayed on the printer hardware so that user can get to know the origin and status of each job This will help the user to know the position of their job in the print queue. There would be a provision to reshuffle the print queue if the user has permission to do so. Hence this invention<br><br>
provides facility to managing the print queue on the printer itself. Presently, the user has to manage it from computer if he/she has a permission to do so.<br>
OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 relates to prior art which shows screenshot showing the options available to user to mange print queue on PC.<br>
While many workstations generating print jobs are usually linked to a network, a smaller number of printers are used and, in a typical case, a single printer is used with several workstations. Thus, in order that a number of print jobs generated from a plurality of workstations are executed in a predetermined order, the print job controller builds a print queue, according to which a specific print process will be performed. The printer will also display the status of current job which will include the origin of the current job, the percentage of job to be completed etc. This information will be available for viewing for everyone on the printer display device which can be an LCD. This displayed information will help in identifying the job origin. Using this information, if an urgent print is required the concerned person can be contacted and asked to re-schedule / cancel his / her print job.<br>
The user will initiate a print job and the job would be lined up in the print queue of the printer. This is shown in Figure 5.<br>
The print queue to be managed by the print job manager consists of the<br><br>
associated queue identifiers Q1, Q2, Qn that are arranged in the order set by a particular sort option or by other algorithm and the print jobs are successively outputted for printout by the printing processor, with the print job content at the head of the queue having identifier Q1 being outputted first. The printing processor executes print jobs according to the order of queue identifiers in the print queue table.<br>
Each of the print job contents is maintained in a file storage means in the printer or in a file storage means (file server) linked to the network and is outputted to the printing processor at the time of printout, namely the time when the associated queue identifier has come to the head of the print queue table.<br>
This invention would facilitate the printer job identification and job queue management using the display panel on the printer and the keys on the front panel of the printer. There would be either a dedicated button or an administrative menu which would prompt for user authorization so that any person without authorization cannot change/edit the print queue.<br>
The user can reshuffle the print queue if he has the authonzation. There could be some standard algorithms provided which will detail how the print jobs would be reshuffled such as:<br>
1.  Make the selected print job the first one once the current job is printed irrespective of the priorities of other print jobs<br><br>
2.	Make the selected print job the first one in that particular priority job group<br>
3.	Make the selected job to print immediately suspending the current job and resume the suspended job once the selected job is done.<br>
Whenever the printer receives a print job it will also receive information about the job origin and display the same on the LCD panel of the pnnter.<br>
The printer's keys will be used to input commands from the user menu selection and the current operation of the printer. When the user selects the view/manage the print queue option he can browse the current print jobs in the print queue. Under the menu there will be an option to manage the queue.<br>
If the user needs to manage the print queue he will have to select the menu option on selection of which the user will be prompted for a username. The user can enter the username and password once the user's password is authenticated using the provided credentials, he will be allowed to cancel/delete the jobs or increase priorities of the jobs selected by the user. In other words, on authentication of the user's password, he will be allowed to manage the print jobs in the queue.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the present invention which shows the sequence of operations involved in user trying to manage the print queue on the printer. First, the user initiates a print job. Printer starts the print job and displays information of job origin. Printer prints and checks for any login interrupt If there is an interrupt,<br><br>
it prompts the user for login name and password. Then the system authenticates the user using the provided credentials. If the login ^s successful, the user is allowed to manage the print queue. If the login is a failure, the user is not allowed to alter the print queue<br>
The present method allows facilitating the management of the print queue from the printer itself. A command to print is selected from the PC through the application and the printer driver transmits the total page number information, user name etc in the header of the printing data to the printer. After that, the host interface of the printer transmits the printing data to the control unit. Then, the control unit judges that the printing data is transmitted from the PC, and receives the information about the total number of pages from the header information. Furthermore, the control unit processes the printing data for printing. Control unit reads the information from the header about the user and display the information on the display unit of the printer. The user can use a key on the printer which allows him to view the job queue. Along with the pnnt queue in the Ul (User Interface) there will also be an option to manage the print queue. When the user selects the option to manage the printer, he will be prompted for the authentication credentials such as username and password. This is explained in the flowchart given in figure 4. Only when these user credentials are verified the user will be allowed to make changes to the print queue.<br>
The information in the header also contains the job details such as job owner, amount of job, etc. This information will be displayed on the printer display device<br><br>
to easily identify the owner of the current print job.<br>
Information about the amount of job left or printed job information in percentage is provided on the display of the printer so that the user can get an idea of the approximate time required to complete the print job Figure 3 is a block diagram showing a printer capable of displaying the state of completion of a printing job according to the present invention. The printer includes an input unit, a host interface, a state of completion display unit, a print unit, and a control unit.<br>
The input unit has a plurality of keys (not shown) to input commands from a user for menu selection and operation of the printer. The host interface interfaces printing data with an external device through a cabie (not shown). Here, the external device can be a PC having a printer driver and an application to request printing of a document.<br>
The display unit could be an LCD or any other alphanumeric display mechanism along with its driver.<br>
Spooler program receives the printable information as incoming information stream and stores it, in incoming order, in an intermediate storage location. Also, a notification is sent to a print server that a new print job exists. The print server program is a standard program that monitors all print jobs that have been created and also checks the available printers to determine their status.<br><br>
Once a print job has been completely spooled or stored in intermediate storage, the print server notifies a printer handler. The printer handler is a type of printer driver that controls and drives a specific printer. The purpose of printer handler is to convert text and graphic information into printer readable form for any particular printer type. Typically, a printer handler can only process one print job and any other jobs that are created and directed towards the associated printer are queued for later processing. The printer handler contains a de-spooler program that retrieves the spooled data from intermediate storage and provides the information to an imaging engine. The imaging engine converts the incoming data stream into the command signals that are necessary to drive the printing elements to produce the final printed document. The commands are provided to the actual print device for printing.<br>
Once a print job is completely printed, the printer handler checks its queue for another print job and, if a job is present, begins processing it. Alternatively, if there are no new print jobs to process, the printer handler becomes inactive. After a particular print job is completed, the information stored in intermediate storage in is deleted and the storage is reclaimed. As an option, the storage can be retained until a user deletes the storage.<br>
The printing unit prints the data transmitted through the host interface under the control of the control unit. The control unit controls the other elements of the printer to process an image of the printing data transmitted through the host interface, and to allow the data to be printed on the printing paper through the<br><br>
printing unit. Moreover, the control unit receives from the printer information about a total number of pages of a job which is included in a header of the printing data. Further, the control unit receives information about a page currently being printed, when the data is printed on the paper through the printing unit. Further, based on the information about the total number of pages and the currently printed page, the control unit controls the data on the display panel of the printer based on the received information.<br>
Figure 4 is a flowchart which illustrates the steps of pausing the first print job and printing new schedule job. User browses the LCD menu and sends the command for rescheduling the print job in print queue to print server. Print handler identifies the current job being printed and the last page is printed. Print handler then puts the remaining current job to the print queue. Then a separator page (The separator page is a blank page or a page with the user name, date, number of pages etc., the separator page separates the two print jobs) is printed. Then the scheduled new job is printed. Again a separator page is printed. After that the paused job which was suspended by the user is resumed.<br>
First, a command to print is selected from the PC through the application and the printer driver transmits the total page number information, user name etc in the header of the printing data to the printer. After that, the host interface of the printer transmits the printing data to the control unit Then, the control unit judges that the printing data is transmitted from the PC, and receives the information<br><br>
about the total number of pages from the header information. Further, the control unit processes the image to perform the printing of the data.<br>
Control unit reads the information from the header about me user and display the information on the display panel. If the printer is on pnnt servers which are normally in an organization as explained in the figure, it can directly get the information about the user name, the size of the job and other spooler information from the print server itself. The user can authenticate him after entering the user name and password as explained and then can manage the print queue. Appropriate signal would be sent to the print server after the user makes some changes in the print queue.<br>
When the user issues a print job rescheduling command through user interface menu to the printer handler, the printer handler identifies a first print job that is printing and the last page of that job that has been, or is still being, printed. The printer handler instructs the print device to complete the printing of the current page in the current print job and to return the remaining portion of the first print job to the queue. The remainder of the paused print job can be rescheduled, such as by placing it back in the print queue, because the printer handler can track the status of the print job, including identifying the last page printed from a paused print job. It is especially beneficial for the printer handler to identify the last page printed or the next page that is to be printed so that only the remaining portion of the first print job is queued, thereby avoiding duplicate printing of pages and thereby avoiding a requirement that the user must resend the print<br><br>
job. The printer handler causes a separator page to be printed to separate the print out. In this manner, the paused print job and the advanced print job can be easily parsed by a visual inspection of the printer output tray. The next print job in the print queue is sent by the printer handler to the pnnt device to be printed. It is important to note that this second print job is subject to pausing as was the first job and so forth.<br>
After that, the control unit controls the print unit to allow the image processed printing data to be printed on the printing paper. Moreover, the control unit receives the information about the currently printed page whenever the printing is completed. Here, the operation to receive the information about the currently printed page of the printing data can be a start time of the image processing, the completion time of the image processing, or the start time of the printing of the print unit.<br>
Next, the control unit calculates the information to be displayed on display panel through the information about the total number of pages received when receiving the printing data and the information regarding the currently printed page.<br>
According to the printer capable of displaying the state of completion of the printing job and the method of controlling the same, the user can easily know the state of completion of the printing job, thus the user does not have to wait in front of the printer. Further, the user does not have to separately ascertain the number of remaining pages in the case when many people use one printer.<br><br>
