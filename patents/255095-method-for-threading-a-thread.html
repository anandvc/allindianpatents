HIRAL CHANDRAKANT JOSHI AGENT FOR OERLIKON TEXTILE GMBH &amp; CO. KG<br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a method for operating a textile machine according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
In textile machines for producing bobbins, such as, for example, winding machines or open-end spinning machines, it is provided in the case of an interruption of the thread supply due to a thread break or a cop or bobbin change or the like, that a thread connecting process is to be initiated in order to be able to resume normal operation. After the thread break the thread is generally located, in this case, outside a thread guide which traverses it during the winding process, so that once the thread connection has been completed, the thread has to be returned to the thread guide.<br>
A method for transferring a thread to the thread guide at a winding head of a textile machine is known from DE 39 30 136 Al, the thread being transferred by a thread transfer device to an individually driven thread guide that goes back and forth. For this purpose, the movement of the thread transfer device and the traversing movement of the thread guide are matched to one another in such a way that the thread and the thread guide arrive virtually simultaneously at a transfer point to transfer the thread. To make this possible a sensor device for monitoring the movement of the thread transfer device and the thread guide is provided in each case and these are connected to control devices which determine the precise transfer point of the thread from the thread transfer device to the thread guide.<br>
The complexity of the device, which is required to monitor the thread transfer device and the thread guide to determine the precise instant and transfer site has proven to be disadvantageous. In addition, in the method known from DE 39 30 136 Al, because of the transfer of the thread taking place when the bobbin starts to run, middle bands or disordered layers may be placed on the bobbin, which can adversely affect the later running off behaviour.<br><br><br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method for threading a thread, which allows simple and reliable threading of a thread into a thread guide.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a method according to the characterising features of claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
According to claim 1 it is proposed that before the beginning of the threading, the thread guide is transferred into a starting position, that the thread guide is then transferred into a threading position and entrains the thread to be threaded, that a relative movement is in this case produced between the thread guide and the thread, in order to thread the thread into the thread guide and that the thread is held under tension for the threading. The relative movement occurring while the thread under tension is being entrained brings about a movement directed along the outer contour of the thread guide in the direction of the slot opening of the guide slot. In this manner, a reliable threading of the thread into the thread guide is achieved without having to carry out any laborious determination of the position of the thread guide. In addition, no additional auxiliary means is required for threading, such as the thread transfer device known from the prior art, the movement course of which has to be matched for transfer of the thread to the thread guide with its movement course. In addition, a simplification of the structure of the textile machine is achieved as devices, such as sensors and the like required to maintain a precise transfer point, are omitted as a result of dispensing with auxiliary means and therefore also with monitoring said auxiliary means as well as the thread guide and the control thereof.<br>
The starting position may preferably be selected such that the thread to be threaded into the thread guide is located in a position between the thread guide and the threading position in order to ensure the reliable entraining of the thread during the transfer of the thread guide out of the starting position into the threading position.<br><br><br>
For this purpose, the starting position may be located in the region of the reversal point opposing the threading position.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the thread guide may carry out an oscillating movement about the threading position. The oscillating movement brings about a relative movement between the thread guide and the thread in the form of a shaking effect which leads to a reliable threading of the thread already arranged adjacent to the slot opening into the guide slot.<br>
As an alternative or additionally, the threading position may be located so far outside the traversing stroke that the thread, which is entrained by the thread guide into the threading position, moves along the outer contour of the thread guide into the region of the slot opening of the guide slot during the transfer. In this alternative, the relative movement is substantially caused by the maintained tension of the thread during threading. The tensile force acting here on the thread means that the thread does not follow the dipping down of the thread guide and, substantially by remaining in a horizontal plane slides along the outer contour of the thread guide in the direction of the slot opening of the guide slot.<br>
In a further variant of the method, a guide contour may be provided, by means of which the thread to be threaded is raised in such a way that the thread moves along the outer contour of the thread guide into the region of the slot opening of the guide slot. In this case, a movement of the thread guide into a position which is outside the traversing stroke is not necessary to bring about the relative movement for threading the thread into the guide slot. The relative movement is achieved here by raising the thread held under tension.<br>
The guide slot may preferably be limited by two legs of different lengths. Thus, during threading, the thread under tension can be prevented from sliding away over the guide slot, as the thread is caught by the longer leg and this contributes to reliable threading.<br><br><br>
In this case, the guide slot formed between the two legs may have a depth such that the thread located in the guide slot, during the process of transfer to the bobbin, is located so far in the guide slot that it cannot slide out of the thread guide slot within the traversing stroke. Thus, during regular operation of the textile machine, a disruption-free course of the bobbin production is favoured.<br>
For this purpose, the threading position should be located in the region of the reversal point facing the shorter leg. By establishing the threading position in the region of the reversal point of the thread guide facing the shorter leg it is ensured that, during the entraining of the thread during the transfer of the thread guide from the starting position into the threading position, the thread rests on the outer contour of the shorter leg or on the inner contour of the longer leg and the thread to be threaded is caught, so reliable entraining during transfer of the thread guide into the threading position is achieved.<br>
In particular, the bobbin may be driven in reverse during the process of threading, so the thread passes through the thread guide counter to the winding direction. This has the advantage that formation of middle bands or disordered layers on the bobbin is avoided during the process of threading the thread into the thread guide.<br>
Furthermore, the textile machine may comprise a suction nozzle, the position of which is matched to the thread guide during the process of threading. This is used to position the thread to be threaded at an angle to the thread guide, the cross-wound bobbin and the suction nozzle in such a way that the thread is located in a position which is optimised for the entraining by and the threading into the thread guide. If the thread is held by the suction nozzle in such a way that the thread encloses an obtuse angle to the horizontal and the thread therefore substantially rests on the drive roller, the thread held under tension cannot be threaded into the guide slot owing to the relative movement produced during threading between the thread guide and the thread. If the angle of the thread, which is enclosed between the thread and the horizontal is too acute, the thread is not grasped during the transfer<br><br><br>
of the thread guide from the starting position into the threading position by said thread guide because the thread is held by the suction nozzle above the thread guide. In order to ensure during the pivoting of the thread guide back into the centre position that the thread does not unthread from the thread guide during this movement, the thread is held tautly at an angle by the suction nozzle in such a way that the thread only rests on the longer leg.<br>
The thread to be threaded can preferably be held by the suction nozzle in a position in which the thread slides on the guide contour when being entrained by the thread guide. It is thus achieved that the thread only slides on the guide contour during the process of threading and during the transfer of the thread guide, while entraining the thread to be threaded, into the transfer position, the thread is raised therefrom. During regular operation, the guidance of the thread always takes place such that the thread guide guides the thread below the guide contour between the regular reversal points.<br>
In this case, the thread guide can be transferred into a centre position to conclude the threading and the suction nozzle can carry out a pitching movement synchronously thereto. This serves to introduce the thread deeper into the slot to achieve better and more reliable guidance during the transfer of the thread.<br>
The present invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins with a thread guide driven by a single motor;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic front view of the thread guide driven by a single motor.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a side view of the workstation 2 of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins. In the present case, this is a so-called automatic<br><br><br>
cross-winding machine 1. On the workstations 2 of automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type, as known and therefore not described in more detail, the spinning cops 3 produced on a ring spinning machine are rewound to form large-volume cross-wound bobbins 5.<br>
Once they have been completed, the cross-wound bobbins 5 are transferred by means of an automatically operating service unit (not shown), preferably a so-called cross-wound bobbin changer, onto a cross-wound bobbin transporting device 7 along the length of the machine and transported to a bobbin loading station or the like arranged at the end of the machine. Automatic cross-winding machines 1 of this type generally also have a logistics device in the form of a bobbin and tube transporting system 6. In this bobbin and tube transporting system 6, the spinning cops 3 or empty tubes revolve on transporting plates 11. Furthermore, an automatic cross-winding machine 1 of this type has a central control unit 32, which is connected via a machine bus 33 to the separate workstation computers 31 of the individual winding heads 2.<br>
Of the bobbin and tube transporting system 6, only the cop supply section 17, the reversibly drivable storage section 18, one of the transverse transporting sections 19 leading to the winding heads 2 and the tube return section 20 are shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The individual winding heads 2 also have, as known and therefore only indicated, various devices, which ensure proper operation of workstations 2 of this type.<br>
One of these devices is the winding mechanism, for example. The winding mechanism characterised as a whole by the reference numeral 4 has a creel 8, which is movably mounted about a pivot pin 12. The creel 8 may also be pivotable about a further pin arranged orthogonally with respect to the pivot pin 12, for example for producing conical cross-wound bobbins.<br><br><br>
During the winding process, the cross-wound bobbin 5 rests with its surface, for example, on a support and pressure roller 9 and entrains this driveless support and pressure roller 9 by a frictional engagement. The cross-wound bobbin 5 is driven, in this case, by a speed-controllable drive device, not shown, which is preferably configured as an electronically commutatable direct current motor and is arranged directly on the creel 8 or integrated into the creel 8.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the cross-wound bobbin 5 rests during the winding process on a drive roller driven by a single motor. In this case, the cross-wound bobbin 5 is entrained by means of frictional engagement by the driven drive roller.<br>
A thread traversing device 10, which is only indicated schematically in Fig. 1, is provided to traverse the thread 16 during the winding process. A thread traversing device 10 of this type is described in detail, for example in DE 198 58 548 Al. The thread traversing device 10 substantially consists of a finger-shaped thread guide 13 which, driven by an electromechanical drive 14, traverses the thread 16 between the two end faces of the cross-wound bobbin 5. The traversing stroke of the thread guide 13 is limited by reversal points.<br>
The thread guide 13 shown schematically in Fig. 2 has, at its free end, an elongate guide slot 21 extending perpendicularly to the bobbin axis, which is used to receive the thread 16 to be guided during transfer to the cross-wound bobbin 5. The guide slot 21 has a depth such that the thread 16 located in the guide slot 21 is located during the process of transfer to the cross-wound bobbin 5 so far into the guide slot 21 that it can no longer slide out of the thread guide slot 21 within the traversing stroke. The legs 22, 23 of the thread guide 13 limiting the guide slot 21 have different lengths here. In the present embodiment, the left leg 22 is longer than the right leg 23.<br>
Furthermore, a guide contour 34 is arranged on the workstation 2, which projects at least in portions in the vertical direction over the support and pressure roller 9.<br><br><br>
Guide contour 34 is spaced apart from the support and contact roller 9 in such a way that the thread guide 13 is located during traversing behind the guide contour 34. The thread 13, during the regular winding process, is always guided by the thread guide 16 below the guide contour 34 between the two regular reversal points.<br>
In Fig. 1, a suction nozzle is designated 24 and a gripper tube 25. Such winding heads 2 also have a splicing device 26, a thread tensioning device 30, a thread clearer 28, a thread cutting device 27, a thread tensile force sensor 29 as well as a lower thread sensor 22. The process of threading the thread into the thread guide 13 is described with the aid of a thread connecting process to be carried out upon a thread interruption, for example owing to a cop change or thread break.<br>
The process of threading can similarly be carried out during a first equipping of the textile machine when the cop 3 and the cross-wound bobbin 5 are first supplied to the respective winding head 2. The carrying out of the process of threading is independent of whether a thread has already been wound on to prepare the process of winding onto the cross-wound bobbin 5 or whether the thread to be wound on coming from the cop 3 first has to be supplied to the cross-wound bobbin 5.<br>
To thread the thread 16, the thread guide 13 is transferred before the beginning of thread connecting process into a starting position A. The starting position A of the thread guide 13 is reached when the thread guide 13 is located in the region of one of its regular reversal points on the bobbin travel. The selection of the reversal point provided as the starting position A depends on the configuration of the thread guide 13 in such a way that the region of the reversal point is the starting position A which is located on the side remote from the shorter leg 23. By establishing one of the regular reversal points as the starting position A it is achieved that the thread guide 13 always adopts a position in which it is located in front of or behind the thread 16. It is thus achieved that the thread 16 is always entrained by the thread guide 13 during transfer from the starting position A into the threading position E.<br><br><br>
As an alternative, another position inside or outside the traversing stroke can also be selected as the starting position A, with the thread guide 13 having to be firstly pivoted proceeding from this starting position A into a position in which the thread 16 to be threaded is located between the thread guide 13 and the threading position E to allow reliable entraining of the thread 16 into the threading position E.<br>
Following the transfer of the guide thread 13 into the starting position A, the drive of the cross-wound bobbin 5 is firstly reversed, so the cross-wound bobbin 5 runs in reverse. The suction nozzle 24 carries out a pitching movement, wherein it sucks up the thread unwound from the cross-wound bobbin 5 and holds it under tension. The suction nozzle positions the thread 16 in such a way that it is located in an optimised position to be entrained by the thread guide 13.<br>
The thread guide 13 is now transferred from its starting position A into a threading position E, which the thread guide 13 adopts on reaching a position in the region of the reversal point opposing that of the starting position A. The threading position E of the thread guide 13 is such that the thread guide 13 is located in a region of the reversal point, so that once threading has taken place it is ensured that the thread 16 is located so far in the guide slot 21 that the thread 16 does not lift out of the guide slot 21 during regular winding operation.<br>
During the transfer of the thread guide 13 from the starting position A into the threading position E, the thread 16 held under tension and provided by the suction nozzle 24 in the manner already described is grasped by the thread guide 13 and entrained. The thread 16 in the process generally rests on the outside of the short leg 23 of the thread guide 13. However, the thread 16 may likewise rest on the inside of the longer leg 22. In this case, the thread 13 is in a position spaced apart from the support and pressure roller 9.<br>
Owing to the transfer of the thread guide 13 into the threading position E it slides around the threading position E onto the guide contour 34 and is raised, in this case,<br><br><br>
by the guide contour 34 in such a way that the thread 16 to be threaded can move along the outer contour of the thread guide 13 into the region of the slot opening of the guide slot 21. On reaching the threading position E, the thread 16 is threaded into the guide slot 21 of the thread guide 13. For this purpose, the thread guide 13 carries out an oscillating movement about the threading position E. This oscillating movement brings about a relative movement of the thread 16 relative to the thread guide 13 in such a way that the thread 16 moves along the short leg 23 in the direction of the slot opening of the guide slot 21 and slides therein.<br>
Thereupon, the thread guide 13 is transferred from the threading position E into a centre position M between the two reversal points. At the same time, on reaching the centre position M of the thread guide 13, the suction nozzle 24 carries out a further pitching movement. In this case, the thread 16 already threaded into the slot 21 of thread guide 13 is pulled further downward by the pitching movement of the suction nozzle 24 inside the guide slot 21 to guide it deeper into the guide slot 21. When the suction nozzle 24 finishes carrying out the pitching movement, the drive of the cross-wound bobbin 5 is stopped. In addition, the thread 16 is held by the suction nozzle 24 at an angle in such a way that when transferring the thread guide 13 from the threading position E into the centre position M, the thread 16 is prevented from being unthreaded. Following the completed process of threading, the thread connecting process is carried out in a known manner and following this, the regular winding operation can be resumed.<br><br><br>
