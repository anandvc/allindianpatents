				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ready-to-use cereal flakes coated with meat powder.<br>
Cereal flake are a popular product widely consumed in India. Among them rice flakes are the most common. About 5% rice flakes are produced from the total rice production in country. At present the rice flakes are consumed as a snack item after seasoning with fat and spices. Not much attention has been paid towards value addition to such a popular product. In this invention a process is developed to prepare ready-to-use cereal flakes coated with meat powder. The product would have vast potential both in domestic as well as export markets.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no CN 1137355 by Weijian Lin; Wei Ping Liu dated June 1998 (Nutritious health-care glutinous rice chicken fast series foods) wherein, glutinous rice and chicken meat is used along with carrot, Chinese date, sugar and some herbs and passed through steam treatment. The drawbacks are use of glutinous rice and chicken meat that needs refrigeration facilities for storage of the product and also product contains specific herbs and sugar that restricts its uses.<br>
Reference may be made to patent no GB963739 by Minnie Ruth Larralde dated July 1964 (Process and apparatus for the production of flavored cereals) wherein, the outer layer of grain cereals are coated with a desired flavoring with an envelop of flour and finally surrounding the envelops with a thin film of hydrogenated fat. The flavored grains then rapidly cooled to a temperature 0 to 5° C. The drawbacks are too many steps of processing and use of particular machines designed specifically for multi layer coating the product.<br>
Reference to be made to patent no CN 1107009 dated August 1995 by Jiaping HU (Making method for fowl and animal meat powder mixed with grain.) wherein, the meat powder is mixed with crushed cereal and then undergone the bulking treatment and the resultant bulking stock is crushed and mixed with adjuncts of flavouring to obtain the final product. The drawbacks are the grains are crushed to powder and thus loose its identity and the texture is very much affected.<br>
Reference to be made to patent no CN 1183236 dated July 1998 by Shi Maoming (Instant rice for fast food) wherein, the instant rice is made up of rice, soybean powder, egg powder, sesame powder, refined vegetable oil, table salt and flavouring through cooking, crushing, mixing, making semi-finished food, vacuum drying,<br>
shaping, roasting and vacuum packing. The drawbacks are the grains are crushed that looses its identity and product will have different texture. Also the process is a elaborative technique for its preparation which restricts its application.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of ready-to-use cereal flakes coated with meat powder, which obviates the drawbacks as defined above.<br>

Example 1<br>
One kg of rice flake (hard variety) is sieved through 60-mesh sieve to remove fine particles of rice powder and dust partials if any. Fifteen gram of cornstarch is dispersed in 1 It. of water. The contents are boiled to 95° C and cooled to 45° C. The gelatinized starch solution obtained is 800 ml, and is mixed with sieved 1 kg rice flakes in a coating machine for 2-3 min, then it is mixed with coating mix containing 70 gm wheat flour as a binder, 200 gm chicken powder, 15 gm garlic powder, 10 gm ginger powder, 30 gm red chilly powder, 2 gm turmeric powder, 30 gm salt, 10 gm white pepper, and 2 gm citric acid and 5 gm garam masala in a coating machine for 3 mint. The coated rice flakes is conditioned at room temperature (25 ! 2° C) for 8 mins. After conditioning the rice flakes are again mixed for 3 mints. The coated rice flakes are spread on trays and dried in cross flow drier at 70!3 ° C for 30 mins. to get ready-to-use product. Quality of the product is analysed in terms of proximate composition, sensory quality and instrumental measurement of compression values. The percentage of coating after drying is calculated by weighing the uncoated powder mix after sieving the dried flakes through 60-mesh sieve. For sensory analysis, the 100 gm product is soaked in 100 ml of water at room temperature 25-27° C for 20 mints. The re-hydrated i.e. soaked rice flake coated with meat is seasoned with 10 ml oil at 80-90° C for 4 mints.. The seasoned product is presented for sensory analysis.<br>
