				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to phthalazinone derivatives, and their<br>
use as Pharmaceuticals. In particular, the present invention relates<br>
to the use of these compounds to inhibit the activity of the enzyme<br>
poly (ADP-ribose)polymerase, also known as poly(ADP-ribose)synthase<br>
and poly ADP-ribosyltransferase, and commonly referred to as PARP.<br>
The mammalian enzyme PARP (a 113-kDa multidomain protein) has been<br>
implicated in the signalling of DNA damage through its ability to<br>
recognize and rapidly bind to DNA single or double strand breaks<br>
(DAmours, et al., Biochem. J., 342, 249-268 (1999)).<br>
Several observations have led to the conclusion that PARP participates<br>
in a variety of DNA-related functions including gene amplification,<br>
cell division, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA base excision repair<br>
and also effects on telomere length and chromosome stability (d'Adda<br>
di Fagagna, et al., Nature Gen., 23(1), 76-80 (1999)).<br>
Studies on the mechanism by which PARP modulates DNA repair and other<br>
processes has identified its importance in the formation of poly (ADPribose)<br>
chains within the cellular nucleus (Althaus, F.R. and Richter<br>
C., ADP-Ribosylation of Proteins: Enzymology and Biological<br>
Significance, Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1987)). The DNA-bound,<br>
activated PARP utilizes NAD to synthesize poly (ADP-ribose) on a<br>
variety of nuclear target proteins, including topoisomerase, histones<br>
and PARP itself (Rhun, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 245, 1-<br>
10 (1998))<br>
Poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation has also been associated with malignant<br>
transformation. For example, PARP activity is higher in the isolated<br>
nuclei of SV40-transformed fibroblasts, while both leukemic cells and<br>
colon cancer cells show higher enzyme activity than the equivalent<br>
normal leukocytes and colon mucosa (Miwa, et al., Arch. Biochem.<br>
Biophys., 181, 313-321 (1977); Burzio, et al. , Proc. Soc. Exp. Bioi.<br>
Med., 149, 933-938 (1975); and Hirai, et al., Cancer Res., 43, 3441-<br>
3446 (1983)).<br>
A number of low-molecular-weight inhibitors of PARP have been used to<br>
elucidate the functional role of poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation in DNA<br>
repair. In cells treated with alkylating agents, the inhibition of<br>
PARP leads to a marked increase in DNA-strand breakage and cell<br>
killing (Durkacz, et al., Nature, 283, 593-596 (1980); Berger, N.A.,<br>
Radiation Research, 101, 4-14 (1985)).<br>
Subsequently, such inhibitors have been shown to enhance the effects<br>
of radiation response by suppressing the repair of potentially lethal<br>
damage (Ben-Hur, et al., British Journal of Cancer, 49 (Suppl. VI),<br>
34-42 (1984); Schlicker, et al., Int. J. Radiat. Bioi., 75, 91-100<br>
(1999)). PARP inhibitors have been reported to be effective in radio<br>
sensitising hypoxic tumour cells (US 5,032,617; US 5,215,738 and US<br>
5,041,653).<br>
Furthermore, PARP knockout (PARP -/-) animals exhibit genomic<br>
instability in response to alkylating agents and yirradiation (Wang,<br>
et al., Genes Dev. , 9, 509-520 (1995); Menissier de Murcia, et al.,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 94, 7303-7307 (1997)).<br>
A role for PARP has also been demonstrated in certain vascular<br>
diseases, septic shock, ischaemic injury and neurotoxicity (Cantoni,<br>
et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1014, 1-7 (1989); Szabo, et al., J.<br>
Clin. Invest., 100, 723-735 (1997)). Oxygen radical DNA damage that<br>
leads to strand breaks in DNA, which are subsequently recognised by<br>
PARP, is a major contributing factor to such disease states as shown<br>
by PARP inhibitor studies (Cosi, et al., J. Neurosci. Res., 39, 38-46<br>
(1994); Said, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 93, 4688-4692<br>
(1996)). More recently, PARP has been demonstrated to play a role in<br>
the pathogenesis of haemorrhagic shock (Liaudet, et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 97(3), 10203-10208 (2000)).<br>
It has also been demonstrated that efficient retroviral infection of<br>
mammalian cells is blocked by the inhibition of PARP activity. Such<br>
inhibition of recombinant retroviral vector infections was shown to<br>
occur in various different cell types (Gaken, et al. , J. Virology,<br>
70(6), 3992-4000 (1996)). Inhibitors of PARP have thus been developed<br>
for the use in anti-viral therapies and in cancer treatment (WO<br>
91/18591).<br>
Moreover, PARP inhibition has been speculated to delay the onset of<br>
aging characteristics in human fibroblasts (Rattan and Clark, Biochem,<br>
Biophys. Res. Conrn., 201(2), 665-672 (1994)). This maybe related to<br>
the role that PARP plays in controlling telomere function (d'Adda di<br>
Fagagna, et al. , Nature Gen., 23(1), 76-80 (1999)).<br>
Some of the present inventors have previously described (WO 02/36576)<br>
a class of 1(2H)-phthalazinone compounds which act as PARP inhibitors<br>
The compounds have the general formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where A and B together represent an optionally substituted, fused<br>
aromatic ring and where Rc is represented by -L-RL. A large number of<br>
examples are of the formula:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
where R represent one or more optional substituents.<br>
The present inventors have now discovered that compounds where R is ol:<br>
a certain nature exhibit surprising levels of inhibition of the<br>
activity of PARP, and/or of potentiation of tumour cells to<br>
radiotherapy and various chemotherapies.<br>
Accordingly, the first aspect of the present invention provides a<br>
compound of the formula (I):<br>
RC1RC2<br>
and isomers, salts, solvates, chemically protected forms, and prodrug$<br>
thereof<br>
wherein:<br>
A and B together represent an optionally substituted, fused aromatic<br>
ring;<br>
X can be NRX or CRXRY;<br>
if X = NRX then n is 1 or 2 and if X = CRXRY then n is 1;<br>
Rx is selected from the group consisting of H, optionally substituted<br>
C1-20 alkyl, C5-2o aryl, C3-2o heterocyclyl, amido, thioamido, ester, acyl,<br>
and sulfonyl groups;<br>
RY is selected from H, hydroxy, amino;<br>
or Rx and RY may together form a spiro-C3-7 cycloalkyl or heterocyclyl<br>
group;<br>
RC1 and RC2 are both hydrogen, or when X is CRXRY, Rcl, RC2, Rx and RY,<br>
together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, may form a<br>
optionally substituted fused aromatic ring; and<br>
R1 is selected from H and halo.<br>
Therefore, if X is CRXRY, then n is 1, the compound is of formula (la)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
If X is NRX, and n is 1, the compound is of formula (Ib):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
If X is NRX, and n is 2, the compound is of formula (Ic)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
A second aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a compound of the first aspect and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention provides a compound of the<br>
first aspect for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal<br>
body.<br>
A fourth aspect of the present invention provides the use of a<br>
compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the<br>
preparation of a medicament for inhibiting the activity of PARP.<br>
Further aspects of the invention provide the use of a compound as<br>
defined in the first aspect of the invention in the preparation of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of: vascular disease; septic shock;<br>
ischaemic injury; neurotoxicity; haemorraghic shock; viral infection;<br>
or diseases ameliorated by the inhibition of the activity of PARP.<br>
Another further aspect of the invention provides for the use of a<br>
compound as defined in the first aspect of the invention in the<br>
preparation of a medicament for use as an adjunct in cancer therapy or<br>
for potentiating tumour cells for treatment with ionizing radiation or<br>
chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
Other further aspects of the invention provide for the treatment of<br>
disease ameliorated by the inhibition of PARP, comprising<br>
administering to a subject in need of treatment a therapeuticallyef<br>
fective amount of a compound as defined in the first aspect,<br>
preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition and the<br>
treatment of cancer, comprising administering to a subject in need of<br>
treatment a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound as defined<br>
in the first aspect in combination, preferably in the form of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition, simultaneously or sequentially with<br>
ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
In further aspects of the present invention, the compounds may be used<br>
in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cancer which<br>
is deficient in Homologous Recombination (HR) dependent DNA DSB repair<br>
activity, or in the treatment of a patient of a cancer which is<br>
deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair activity, comprising<br>
administering to said patient a therapeutically-effective amount of<br>
the compound.<br>
The HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway repairs double-strand breaks<br>
(DSBs) in DNA via homologous mechanisms to reform a continuous DNA<br>
helix (K.K. Khanna and S.P. Jackson, Nat. Genet. 27(3): 247-254<br>
(2001)). The components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway<br>
include, but are not limited to, ATM (NM_000051), RAD51 (NM_002875),<br>
RAD51L1 (NM_002877), RAD51C (NM_002876), RAD51L3 (NM_002878), DMC1<br>
(NM_007068), XRCC2 (NM_005431), XRCC3 (NM_005432), RAD52 (NM_002879),<br>
RAD54L (NM_003579), RAD54B (NM_012415), BRCA1 (NM_007295), BRCA2<br>
(NM_000059), RAD50 (NM_005732), MRE11A (NM_005590) andNBSl<br>
(NM_002485). Other proteins involved in the HR dependent DNA DSB<br>
repair pathway include regulatory factors such as EMSY (Hughes-Davies<br>
et al., Cell, 115, pp523-535). HR components are also described in<br>
Wood, et al., Science, 291, 1284-1289 (2001).<br>
A cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB repair may<br>
comprise or consist of one or more cancer cells which have a reduced<br>
or abrogated ability to repair DNA DSBs through that pathway, relative<br>
to normal cells i.e. the activity of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair<br>
pathway may be reduced or abolished in the one or more cancer cells.<br>
The activity of one or more components of the HR dependent DNA DSB<br>
repair pathway may be abolished in the one or more cancer cells of an<br>
individual having a cancer which is deficient in HR dependent DNA DSB<br>
repair. Components of the HR dependent DNA DSB repair pathway are well<br>
characterised in the art (see for example, Wood, et al., Science, 291,<br>
1284-1289 (2001)) and include the components listed above.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the cancer cells may have a BRCA1<br>
j<br>
and/or a BRCA2 deficient phenotype i.e. BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 activity is<br>
reduced or abolished in the cancer cells. Cancer cells with this<br>
phenotype may be deficient in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2, i.e. expression<br>
and/or activity of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 may be reduced or abolished in<br>
the cancer cells, for example by means of mutation or polymorphism in<br>
the encoding nucleic acid, or by means of amplification, mutation or<br>
polymorphism in a gene encoding a regulatory factor, for example the<br>
EMSY gene which encodes a BRCA2 regulatory factor (Hughes-Davies, et<br>
al. , Cell, 115, 523-535) .<br>
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are known tumour suppressors whose wild-type alleles<br>
are frequently lost in tumours of heterozygous carriers (Jasin M.,<br>
Oncogene, 21(58), 8981-93 (2002); Tutt, et al., Trends Mol Med.,<br>
8(12), 571-6, (2002)). The association of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation<br>
with breast cancer is well-characterised in the art (Radice, P.J.,<br>
Exp Clin Cancer Res., 21(3 Suppl), 9-12 (2002)). Amplification of the<br>
EMSY gene, which encodes a BRCA2 binding factor, is also known to be<br>
associated with breast and ovarian cancer.<br>
Carriers of mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 are also at elevated risk<br>
of cancer of the ovary, prostate and pancreas.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the individual is heterozygous for one<br>
or more variations, such as mutations and polymorphisms, in BRCA1<br>
and/or BRCA2 or a regulator thereof. The detection of variation in<br>
BRCA1 and BRCA2 is well-known in the art and is described, for example<br>
in EP 699 754, EP 705 903, Neuhausen, S.L. and Ostrander, E.A., Genet,<br>
Test, 1, 75-83 (1992); Chappnis, P.O. and Foulkes, W.D., Cancer Treat<br>
Res, 107, 29-59 (2002); Janatova M., et al., Neoplasma, 50(4), 246-50j<br>
(2003); Jancarkova, N., Ceska Gynekol., 68(1), 11-6 (2003)).<br>
Determination of amplification of the BRCA2 binding factor EMSY is<br>
described in Hughes-Davies, et al., Cell, 115, 523-535).<br>
Mutations and polymorphisms associated with cancer may be detected at<br>
the nucleic acid level by detecting the presence of a variant nucleic<br>
acid sequenc or at the protein level by detecting the presence of a<br>
variant (i.e. a mutant or allelic variant) polypeptide.<br>
Definitions<br>
The term "aromatic ring" is used herein in the conventional sense to<br>
refer to a cyclic aromatic structure, that is, a cyclic structure<br>
having delocalised n-electron orbitals.<br>
The aromatic ring fused to the main core, i.e. that formed by -A-B-,<br>
may bear further fused aromatic rings (resulting in, e.g. naphthyl or<br>
anthracenyl groups). The aromatic ring(s) may comprise solely carbon<br>
atoms, or may comprise carbon atoms and one or more heteroatoms,<br>
including but not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms. Th<br>
aromatic ring(s) preferably have five or six ring atoms.<br>
The aromatic ring(s) may optionally be substituted. If a substituent<br>
itself comprises an aryl group, this aryl group is not considered to<br>
be a part of the aryl group to which it is attached. For example, the<br>
group biphenyl is considered herein to be a phenyl group (an aryl<br>
group comprising a single aromatic ring) substituted with a phenyl<br>
group. Similarly, the group benzylphenyl is considered to be a pheny:.<br>
group (an aryl group comprising a single aromatic ring) substituted<br>
with a benzyl group.<br>
In one group of preferred embodiments, the aromatic group comprises a<br>
single aromatic ring, which has five or six ring atoms, which ring<br>
atoms are selected from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, and<br>
which ring is optionally substituted. Examples of these groups<br>
include, but are not limited to, benzene, pyrazine, pyrrole,<br>
thiazole, isoxazole, and oxazole. 2-Pyrone can also be considered to<br>
be an aromatic ring, but is less preferred.<br>
If the aromatic ring has six atoms, then preferably at least four, or<br>
even five or all, of the ring atoms are carbon. The other ring atoms<br>
are selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, with nitrogen and<br>
oxygen being preferred. Suitable groups include a ring with: no<br>
hetero atoms (benzene); one nitrogen ring atom (pyridine); two<br>
nitrogen ring atoms (pyrazine, pyrimidine and pyridazine) , one oxygen<br>
ring atom (pyrone); and one oxygen and one nitrogen ring atom<br>
(oxazine).<br>
If the aromatic ring has five ring atoms, then preferably at least<br>
three of the ring atoms are carbon. The remaining ring atoms are<br>
selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur. Suitable rings include a<br>
ring with: one nitrogen ring atom (pyrrole); two nitrogen ring atoms<br>
(imidazole, pyrazole); one oxygen ring atom (furan); one sulphur ring<br>
atom (thiophene) ,- one nitrogen and one sulphur ring atom (isothiazole,<br>
thiazole); and one nitrogen and one oxygen ring atom (isoxazole or<br>
oxazole).<br>
The aromatic ring may bear one or more substituent groups at any<br>
available ring position. These substituents are selected from halo,<br>
nitro, hydroxy, ether, thiol, thioether, amino, C1-7 alkyl, C3-20<br>
heterocyclyl and C5.20 aryl. The aromatic ring may also bear one or<br>
more substituent groups which together form a ring. In particular<br>
these may be of formula -(CH2)m- or -O- (CH2)P-0-, where m is 2, 3, 4 or)<br>
5 and p is 1, 2 or 3.<br>
Alkyl: The term "alkyl" as used herein, pertains to a monovalent<br>
moiety obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from a carbon atom of a<br>
hydrocarbon compound having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms (unless<br>
otherwise specified), which may be aliphatic or alicyclic, and which<br>
may be saturated or unsaturated (e.g. partially unsaturated, fully<br>
unsaturated). Thus, the term "alkyl" includes the sub-classes<br>
alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyenyl, cylcoalkynyl, etc.,<br>
discussed below.<br>
In the context of alkyl groups, the prefixes (e.g. C1-4, C1-7, C1-20, C2-7<br>
C3-7, etc.) denote the number of carbon atoms, or range of number of<br>
carbon atoms. For example, the term "C1-4 alkyl", as used herein,<br>
pertains to an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples<br>
of groups of alkyl groups include C1-4 alkyl ("lower alkyl"), C1-7 alkyl<br>
and C1-20 alkyl. Note that the first prefix may vary according to other<br>
limitations; for example, for unsaturated alkyl groups, the first<br>
prefix must be at least 2; for cyclic alkyl groups, the first prefix<br>
must be at least 3; etc.<br>
Examples of (unsubstltuted) saturated alkyl groups include, but are<br>
not limited to, methyl (CJ , ethyl (C2) , propyl (C3) , butyl (C4) , pentyl<br>
(C5) , hexyl (C6) , heptyl (C7) , octyl (C8) , nonyl (C9) , decyl (C10) ,<br>
undecyl (C11) , dodecyl (C12) , tridecyl (C13) , tetradecyl (C14) ,<br>
pentadecyl (C15) , and eicodecyl (C20) <br>
Examples of (unsubstltuted) saturated linear alkyl groups include, but<br>
are not limited to, methyl (CJ , ethyl (C2) , n-propyl (C3) , n-butyl<br>
(C4) , n-pentyl (amyl) (C5) , n-hexyl (C6) , and n-heptyl (C7) .<br>
Examples of (unsubstituted) saturated branched alkyl groups include<br>
iso-propyl (C3) , iso-butyl (CJ , sec-butyl (C4), tert-butyl (C4) , isopentyl<br>
(C5) , and neo-pentyl (Cs) .<br>
Alkenyl: The term "alkenyl", as used herein, pertains to an alkyl<br>
group having one or more carbon-carbon double bonds. Examples of<br>
groups of alkenyl groups include C2.4 alkenyl, C2.7 alkenyl, C2-20 alkenyl<br>
Examples of (unsubstituted) unsaturated alkenyl groups include, but<br>
are not limited to, ethenyl (vinyl, -CH=CH2) , 1-propenyl (-CH=CH-CH3) ,<br>
2-propenyl (allyl, -CH-CH=CH2) , isopropenyl (1-methylvinyl,<br>
-C(CH3)=CH2) , butenyl (C4) , pentenyl (C5) , and hexenyl (C6) .<br>
Alkynyl: The term "alkynyl", as used herein, pertains to an alkyl<br>
group having one or more carbon-carbon triple bonds. Examples of<br>
groups of alkynyl groups include C2-4 alkynyl, C2-7 alkynyl, C2-20 alkynyl<br>
Examples of (unsubstituted) unsaturated alkynyl groups include, but<br>
are not limited to, ethynyl (ethinyl, -C=CH) and 2-propynyl<br>
(propargyl, -CH2-C=CH).<br>
Cycloalkyl: The term "cycloalkyl", as used herein, pertains to an<br>
alkyl group which is also a cyclyl group; that is, a monovalent moiety<br>
obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from an alicyclic ring atom of a<br>
carbocyclic ring of a carbocyclic compound, which carbocyclic ring may<br>
be saturated or unsaturated (e.g. partially unsaturated, fully<br>

protected forms of these substituents. For example, a reference to<br>
carboxylic acid (-COOH) also includes the anionic (carboxylate) form<br>
(-COO"), a salt or solvate thereof, as well as conventional protected<br>

Isomers, Salts, Solvates, Protected Forms, and Prodrugs<br>
Certain compounds may exist in one or more particular geometric,<br>
optical, enantiomeric, diasteriomeric, epimeric, stereoisomeric,<br>
tautomeric, conformational, or anomeric forms, including but not<br>
limited to, cis- and trans-forms; E- and /-forms; c-, t-, and r-forms<br>
endo- and exo-forms; R-, S-, and meso-forms; D- and L-forms; d- and 1<br>
forms; ( + ) and (-) forms; keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms; syn- and<br>
anti-forms; synclinal- and anticlinal-forms; a- and (3-forms; axial an<fl></fl>
equatorial forms; boat-, chair-, twist-, envelope-, and halfchairforms;<br>
and combinations thereof, hereinafter collectively referred to<br>
as "isomers" (or "isomeric forms").<br>
If the compound is in crystalline form, it may exist in a number of<br>
different polymorphic forms.<br>
Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms,<br>
specifically excluded from the term "isomers", as used herein, are<br>
structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in<br>
the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of<br>
atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCH3,<br>
is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a<br>
hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH. Similarly, a reference to orthochlorophenyl<br>
is not to be construed as a reference to its structural<br>
isomer, meta-chlorophenyl. However, a reference to a class of<br>
structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within<br>
that class (e.g., d.7 alkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl<br>
includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-<br>
, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).<br>
The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example,<br>
keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following<br>
tautomeric pairs: keto/enol, imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol,<br>
amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, Nnitroso/<br>
hyroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitro.<br>
Particularly relevant to the present invention is the tautomeric pair<br>
illustrated below:<br>
Note that specifically included in the term "isomer" are compounds<br>
with one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in an<br>
isotopic form, including 1H, 2H (D) , and 3H (T); C may be in any<br>
isotopic form, including 12C, 13C, and 14C; O may be in any isotopic<br>
form, including 160 and 180; and the like.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound<br>
includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially)<br>
racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation<br>
(e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g. fractional<br>
crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are<br>
either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the<br>
methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound also<br>
includes ionic, salt, solvate, and protected forms of thereof, for<br>
example, as discussed below, as well as its different polymorphic<br>
forms.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a<br>
corresponding salt of the active compound, for example, a<br>
pharmaceutically-acceptable salt. Examples of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts are discussed in Berge, et al., "Pharmaceutically<br>
Acceptable Salts", J. Pharm. Sci., 66, 1-19 (1977).<br>

It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a<br>
corresponding solvate of the active compound. The term "solvate" is<br>
used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute<br>
(e.g. active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent. If the<br>
solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a<br>
hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate,<br>
etc.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle<br>
the active compound in a chemically protected form. The term<br>
"chemically protected form," as used herein, pertains to a compound in<br>
which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from<br>
undesirable chemical reactions, that is, are in the form of a<br>
protected or protecting group (also known as a masked or masking group<br>
or a blocked or blocking group). By protecting a reactive functional<br>
group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive functional<br>
groups can be performed, without affecting the protected group; the<br>
protecting group may be removed, usually in a subsequent step, without,<br>
substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule. See, for<br>
example, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (T. Green and<br>
P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999).<br>
For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (-OR) or an<br>
ester (-OC(=0)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl,<br>
benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a<br>
trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl ether; or an acetyl ester<br>
(-OC(=0)CH3, -OAc).<br>
For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an aceta^<br>
or ketal, respectively, in which the carbonyl group (&gt;C=0) is<br>
converted to a diether (&gt;C(OR)2), by reaction with, for example, a<br>
primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated<br>
by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid.<br>
For example, an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide<br>
or a urethane, for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHCO-CH3) ; a benzyloxy<br>
amide (-NHCO-OCH2C6HS, -NH-Cbz); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3) 3,<br>
-NH-Boc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHCO-OC(CH3) 2C6H4C6H5, -NHBpoc),<br>
as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NH-Fmoc), as a 6-<br>
nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH-Nvoc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide:<br>
(-NH-Teoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NH-Troc), as an<br>
allyloxy amide (-NH-Alloc), as a 2(-phenylsulphonyl)ethyloxy amide (-<br>
NH-Psec); or, in suitable cases, as an W-oxide (&gt;NO«).<br>
For example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester for<br>
example, as: an C^, alkyl ester (e.g. a methyl ester; a t-butyl ester)<br>
a Ci_7 haloalkyl ester (e.g. a C^ trihaloalkyl ester); a triC^,<br>
alkylsilyl-Ci.v alkyl ester,- or a C5.2o aryl-C^, alkyl ester (e.g. a<br>
benzyl ester; a nitrobenzyl ester); or as an amide, for example, as a<br>
methyl amide.<br>
For example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether (-SR), for<br>
example, as: a benzyl thioether; an acetamidomethyl ether (-SCH2NHC(=<br>
0)CH3) .<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle<br>
the active compound in the form of a prodrug. The term "prodrug", as<br>
used herein, pertains to a compound which, when metabolised (e.g. in<br>
vivo), yields the desired active compound. Typically, the prodrug is<br>
inactive, or less active than the active compound, but may provide<br>
advantageous handling, administration, or metabolic properties.<br>
For example, some prodrugs are esters of the active compound (e.g. a<br>
physiologically acceptable metabolically labile ester). During<br>
metabolism, the ester group (-C(=0)OR) is cleaved to yield the active<br>
drug. Such esters may be formed by esterification, for example, of<br>
any of the carboxylic acid groups (-C(=0)OH) in the parent compound,<br>
with, where appropriate, prior protection of any other reactive group^<br>
present in the parent compound, followed by deprotection if required.<br>
Examples of such metabolically labile esters include those wherein R<br>
is Ci-zo alkyl (e.g. -Me, -Et) ; C^, aminoalkyl (e.g. aminoethyl; 2-(N,Ndiethylamino)<br>
ethyl; 2-(4-morpholino) ethyl) ,- and acyloxy-CV, alkyl (e.g<br>
acyloxymethyl; acyloxyethyl; e.g. pivaloyloxymethyl; acetoxymethyl;<br>
1-acetoxyethyl; 1-(1-methoxy-l-methyl)ethyl-carbonxyloxyethyl; 1-<br>
(benzoyloxy)ethyl; isopropoxy-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-isopropoxycarbonyloxyethyl;<br>
cyclohexyl-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-cyclohexylcarbonyloxyethyl;<br>
cyclohexyloxy-carbonyloxymethyl; 1-cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxyethyl;<br>
(4-tetrahydropyranyloxy) carbonyloxymethyl; l-(4-<br>
tetrahydropyranyloxy)carbonyloxyethyl;<br>
(4-tetrahydropyranyl) carbonyloxymethyl,- and<br>
1-(4 -tetrahydropyranyl)carbonyloxyethyl).<br>
Further suitable prodrug forms include phosphonate and glycolate<br>
salts. In particular, hydroxy groups (-OH), can be made into<br>
phosphonate prodrugs by reaction with chlorodibenzylphosphite,<br>
followed by hydrogenation, to form a phosphonate group -0-P(=0)(OH)2.<br>
Such a group can be cleared by phosphotase enzymes during metabolism<br>
to yield the active drug with the hydroxy group.<br>
Also, some prodrugs are activated enzymatically to yield the active<br>
compound, or a compound which, upon further chemical reaction, yields<br>
the active compound. For example, the prodrug may be a sugar<br>
derivative or other glycoside conjugate, or may be an amino acid ester<br>
derivative.<br><br>

Use<br>
The present invention provides active compounds, specifically, active<br>
in inhibiting the activity of PARP.<br>
The term "active" as used herein, pertains to compounds which are<br>
capable of inhibiting PARP activity, and specifically includes both<br>
compounds with intrinsic activity (drugs) as well as prodrugs of such<br>
compounds, which prodrugs may themselves exhibit little or no<br>
intrinsic activity.<br>
One assay which may conveniently be used in order to assess the PARP<br>
inhibition offered by a particular compound is described in the<br>
examples below.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of inhibiting the<br>
activity of PARP in a cell, comprising contacting said cell with an<br>
effective amount of an active compound, preferably in the form of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable composition. Such a method may be<br>
practised in vitro or in vivo.<br>
For example, a sample of cells may be grown in vitro and an active<br>
compound brought into contact with said cells, and the effect of the<br>
compound on those cells observed. As examples of "effect", the amount<br>
of DNA repair effected in a certain time may be determined. Where th«<br>
active compound is found to exert an influence on the cells, this may<br>
be used as a prognostic or diagnostic marker of the efficacy of the<br>
compound in methods of treating a patient carrying cells of the same<br>
cellular type.<br>
The term "treatment", as used herein in the context of treating a<br>
condition, pertains generally to treatment and therapy, whether of a<br>
human or an animal (e.g. in veterinary applications), in which some<br>
desired therapeutic effect is achieved, for example, the inhibition oi<br>
the progress of the condition, and includes a reduction in the rate oi<br>
progress, a halt in the rate of progress, amelioration of the<br>
condition, and cure of the condition. Treatment as a prophylactic<br>
measure (i.e. prophylaxis) is also included.<br>
The term "adjunct" as used herein relates to the use of active<br>
compounds in conjunction with known therapeutic means. Such means<br>
include cytotoxic regimes of drugs and/or ionising radiatron as used<br>
in the treatment of different cancer types. In particular, the active<br>
compounds are known to potentiate the actions of a number of cancer<br>
chemotherapy treatments, which include the topoisomerase class of<br>
poisons (e.g. topotecan, irinotecan, rubitecan), most of the known<br>
alkylating agents (e.g. DTIC, temozolamide) and platinum based drugs<br>
(e.g. carboplatin, cisplatin) used in treating cancer.<br>
Active compounds may also be used as cell culture additives to inhibit<br>
PARP, for example, in order to sensitize cells to known<br>
chemotherapeutic agents or ionising radiation treatments in vitro.<br>
Active compounds may also be used as part of an in vitro assay, for<br>
example, in order to determine whether a candidate host is likely to<br>
benefit from treatment with the compound in question.<br>
Administration<br>
The active compound or pharmaceutical composition comprising the<br>
active compound may be administered to a subject by any convenient<br>
route of administration, whether systemically/ peripherally or at the<br>
site of desired action, including but not limited to, oral (e.g. by<br>
ingestion) ,- topical (including e.g. transdermal, intranasal, ocular,<br>
buccal, and sublingual); pulmonary (e.g. by inhalation or insufflatioi<br>
therapy using, e.g. an aerosol, e.g. through mouth or nose); rectal;<br>
vaginal; parenteral, for example, by injection, including<br>
subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial,<br>
intracardiac, intrathecal, intraspinal, intracapsular, subcapsular,<br>
intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intratracheal, subcuticular,<br>
intraarticular, subarachnoid, and intrasternal; by implant of a depot<br>
for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly.<br>
The subject may be a eukaryote, an animal, a vertebrate animal, a<br>
mammal, a rodent (e.g. a guinea pig, a hamster, a rat, a mouse),<br>
murine (e.g. a mouse), canine (e.g. a dog), feline (e.g. a cat),<br>
equine (e.g. a horse), a primate, simian (e.g. a monkey or ape), a<br>
monkey (e.g. marmoset, baboon), an ape (e.g. gorilla, chimpanzee,<br>
orangutang, gibbon), or a human.<br>
Formulations<br>
While it is possible for the active compound to be administered alone<br>
it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition (e.g.,<br>
formulation) comprising at least one active compound, as defined<br>
above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers<br>
adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers,<br>
preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those<br>
skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic<br>
agents.<br>
Thus, the present invention further provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, as defined above, and methods of making a pharmaceutica<br>
composition comprising admixing at least one active compound, as<br>
defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers, excipients, buffers, adjuvants, stabilisers, or other<br>
materials, as described herein.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein pertains to<br>
compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are,<br>
within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in<br>
contact with the tissues of a subject (e.g. human) without excessive<br>
toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or<br>
complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Eac<br>
carrier, excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of<br>
being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
Suitable carriers, diluents, excipients, etc. can be found in standar<br>
pharmaceutical texts. See, for example, "Handbook of Pharmaceutical<br>
Additives", 2nd Edition (eds. M. Ash and I. Ash), 2001 (Synapse<br>
Information Resources, Inc., Endicott, New York, USA), "Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences", 20th edition, pub. Lippincott, Williams &amp;<br>
Wilkins, 2000; and "Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients", 2nd<br>
edition, 1994.<br>
The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form an<br>
may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active<br>
compound with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory<br>
ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly<br>
and intimately bringing into association the active compound with<br>
liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if<br>
necessary shaping the product.<br>
Formulations may be in the form of liquids, solutions, suspensions,<br>
emulsions, elixirs, syrups, tablets, losenges, granules, powders,<br>
capsules, cachets, pills, ampoules, suppositories, pessaries,<br>
ointments, gels, pastes, creams, sprays, mists, foams, lotions, oils,<br>
boluses, electuaries, or aerosols.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration (e.g., by ingestion) ma<br>
be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets,<br>
each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a<br>
powder or granules; as a solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous<br>
liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-inoil<br>
liquid emulsion; as a bolus; as an electuary; or as a paste.<br>
A tablet may be made by conventional means, e.g. compression or<br>
molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.<br>
Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable<br>
machine the active compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder o<br>
granules, optionally mixed with one or more binders (e.g. povidone,<br>
gelatin, acacia, sorbitol, tragacanth, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose)<br>
fillers or diluents (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calciui<br>
hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc,<br>
silica); disintegrants (e.g. sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked<br>
povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose); surface-activi<br>
or dispersing or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate); and<br>
preservatives (e.g., methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl phydroxybenzoate,<br>
sorbic acid). Molded tablets may be made by molding<br>
in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened<br>
with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated o<br>
scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled<br>
release of the active compound therein using, for example,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the<br>
desired release profile. Tablets may optionally be provided with an<br>
enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than th<br>
stomach.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration (e.g. transdermal,<br>
intranasal, ocular, buccal, and sublingual) may be formulated as an<br>
ointment, cream, suspension, lotion, powder, solution, past, gel,<br>
spray, aerosol, or oil. Alternatively, a formulation may comprise a<br>
patch or a dressing such as a bandage or adhesive plaster impregnated<br>
with active compounds and optionally one or more excipients or<br>
diluents.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include<br>
losenges comprising the active compound in a flavored basis, usually<br>
sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active<br>
compound in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose<br>
and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active compound in a<br>
suitable liquid carrier.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also<br>
include eye drops wherein the active compound is dissolved or<br>
suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for th<br>
active compound.<br>
Formulations suitable for nasal administration, wherein the carrier i<br>
a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example,<br>
in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns which is administered i<br>
the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through<br>
the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the<br>
nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid for<br>
administration as, for example, nasal spray, nasal drops, or by<br>
aerosol administration by nebuliser, include aqueous or oily solution<br>
of the active compound.<br>
Formulations suitable for administration by inhalation include those<br>
presented as an aerosol spray from a pressurised pack, with the use oE<br>
a suitable propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane,<br>
trichlorofluoromethane, dichoro-tetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or<br>
other suitable gases.<br>
Formulations suitable for topical administration via the skin include<br>
ointments, creams, and emulsions. When formulated in an ointment, th
active compound may optionally be employed with either a paraffinic or<br>
a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active compounds<br>
may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If<br>
desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example<br>
at least about 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol<br>
having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane-<br>
1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol and<br>
mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a<br>
compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active<br>
compound through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such<br>
dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related<br>
analogues.<br>
When formulated as a topical emulsion, the oily phase may optionally<br>
comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), or it<br>
may comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an<br>
oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic<br>
emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which<br>
acts as a stabiliser. It is also preferred to include both an oil and<br>
a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabiliser(s) make<br>
up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil<br>
and/or fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which form^<br>
the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.<br>
Suitable emulgents and emulsion stabilisers include Tween 60, Span 80<br>
cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and<br>
sodium lauryl sulphate. The choice of suitable oils or fats for the<br>
formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties,<br>
since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be<br>
used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations may be very low. Thus<br>
the cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washabli<br>
product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other<br>
containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esterii<br>
such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester o:<br>
coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl<br>
palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of<br>
branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last<br>
three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in<br>
combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, hich<br>
melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid<br>
paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.<br>
Formulations suitable for rectal administration may be presented as a<br>
suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa butte<br>
or a salicylate.<br>
Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as<br>
pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations<br>
containing in addition to the active compound, such carriers as are<br>
known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by<br>
injection, including cutaneous, subcutaneous, intramuscular,<br>
intravenous and intradermal), include aqueous and non-aqueous<br>
isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile injection solutions which may contain<br>
anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers, bacteriostats, an<br>
solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the<br>
intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions<br>
which may include suspending agents and thickening agents, and<br>
liposomes or other microparticulate systems which are designed to<br>
target the compound to blood components or one or more organs.<br>
Examples of suitable isotonic vehicles for use in such formulations<br>
include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer=s Solution, or Lactated<br>
Ringer=s Injection. Typically, the concentration of the active<br>
compound in the solution is from about I ng/ml to about 10 (jg/ml, for<br>
example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 j^g/ml. The formulations may b<br>
presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example,<br>
ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised)<br>
condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier,<br>
for example water for injections, immediately prior to use.<br>
Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared<br>
from sterile powders, granules, and tablets. Formulations may be ir<br>
the form of liposomes or other microparticulate systems which are<br>
designed to target the active compound to blood components or one or<br>
more organs.<br>
Dosage<br>
It will be appreciated that appropriate dosages of the active<br>
compounds, and compositions comprising the active compounds, can vary<br>
from patient to patient. Determining the optimal dosage will<br>
generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit<br>
against any risk or deleterious side effects of the treatments of the<br>
present invention. The selected dosage level will depend on a variet;<br>
of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the<br>
particular compound, the route of administration, the time of<br>
administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration o::<br>
the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in<br>
combination, and the age, sex, weight, condition, general health, and<br>
prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and<br>
route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the<br>
physician, although generally the dosage will be to achieve local<br>
concentrations at the site of action which achieve the desired effect<br>
without causing substantial harmful or deleterious side-effects.<br>
Administration in vivo can be effected in one dose, continuously or<br>
intermittently (e.g., in divided doses at appropriate intervals)<br>
throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most<br>
effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those<br>
of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for<br>
therapy, the purpose of the therapy, the target cell being treated,<br>
and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can<br>
be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the<br>
treating physician.<br>
In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of<br>
about 100 jag to about 250 mg per kilogram body weight of the subject<br>
per day. Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, prodrug, or<br>
the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the<br>
parent compound and so the actual weight to be used is increased<br>
proportionately.<br>

Synthesis of Key Intermediates<br>
a. 3-(4-Oxo-3,4-dihydrophthalazin-l-ylmethyl)benzoic acid (A)<br>
A mixture of 27% sodium methoxide solution in methanol (400 g, 2 mol)<br>
and methanol (150 ml) was added dropwise between ambient temperature<br>
and 30°C over 15 minutes to a stirred mixture of phthalide (67 g, 0.5<br>
mol), 3-formylbenzonitrile (65.5 g, 0.5 mol) and ethyl propionate (256<br>
ml), the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 40 minutes and<br>
at reflux temperature for 1 hour, then it was allowed to cool to<br>
ambient temperature. The resulting red solid was collected by<br>
filtration, washed with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 ml) and dissolved in<br>
water (1800 ml). The solution was acidified by the addition of acetic<br>
acid (60 ml) and the resulting red solid was collected by filtration,<br>
washed with water (2 x 200 ml) and dried in vacuo to give 3-(1,3-<br>
dioxoindan-2-yl)benzonitrile (83.2 g) as a dark red solid, m.pt. 179-<br>
182°C, m/z (M+H)+P 248, which was used without further purification.<br>
3-(1,3-Dioxoindan-2-yl)benzonitrile (74.18 g, 0.3 mol) was added in<br>
portions to a solution of sodium hydroxide (36 g, 0.9 mol) in water<br>
(580 ml), the resulting dark red suspension was stirred at reflux<br>
temperature for 5 hours, then it was cooled to ambient temperature and<br>
washed with ethyl acetate (3 x 300 ml). The aqueous solution was<br>
acidified by the dropwise addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid<br>
(110 ml), the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 hour,<br>
then the resulting solid was collected by filtration, washed with<br>
water (2 x 200 ml) and dried in vacuo to give a 1:1 mixture of 3-(1,3-<br>
dioxoindan-2-yl)benzoic acid, (M+H)+1 267, and 2-[2-(3-<br>
carboxyphenyl)acetyl]benzole acid, (M+H)+- 285, (69.32 g) , which was<br>
used without further purification.<br>
The mixture obtained in the previous step (52.8 g) was added to a<br>
solution of triethylamine (37.55 g, 0.372 mol) in industrial<br>
methylated spirit (500 ml) and the resulting cloudy solution was<br>
filtered through a pad of filter-aid to give a clear solution.<br>
Hydrazine monohydrate (9.3 g, 0.186 mol) was added in one portion at<br>
ambient temperature, the stirred mixture was heated under reflux for<br>
hour, then it was concentrated in vacuo to approximately 250 ml and<br>
added to a solution of sodium acetate (41 g, 0.5 mol) in water (500<br>
ml). The mixture was brought to pH 7 by the dropwise addition of<br>
concentrated hydrochloric acid, then it was stirred at ambient<br>
temperature for 3 hours. The resulting solid was collected by<br>
filtration, washed with water (50 ml) and dried in vacuo to give a<br>
white solid (15.62 g). The combined filtrate and washings were<br>
acidified to pH 6 by the addition of hydrochloric acid, then the<br>
mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 3 hours. The resulting<br>
solid was collected by filtration, washed with water (50 ml) and dried<br>
in vacuo to give a second crop of off-white solid (17.57 g). The<br>
combined filtrate and washings from the second crop were readjusted t<f><br>
pH 6 and treated as before to give a third crop of pale orange solid<br>
(6.66 g). The three crops were combined to give essentially pure 3-<br>
(4-oxo-3,4-dihydrophthalazin-1-ylmethyl)benzole acid (A), (M+H)+- 281,<br>

Dimethyl phosphite (22.0 g, 0.2 mol) was added drop-wise to a solutiop<br>
of sodium methoxide (43.0 g) in methanol (100 ml) at 0°C. 2-<br>
Carboxybenzaldehyde (21.0 g, 0.1 mol) was then added portion-wise to<br>
the reaction mixture as a slurry in methanol (40 ml), with the<br>
temperature kept below 5°C. The resulting pale yellow solution was<br>
warmed to 20°C over 1 hour. Methanesulphonic acid (21.2 g, 0.22 mol)<br>
was added to the reaction drop-wise and the resulting white suspension<br>
was evaporated in vacuo. The white residue was quenched with water and<br>
extracted into chloroform (3 x 100 ml). The combined organic extracts<br>
were washed with water (2 x 100 ml), dried over MgS04, and evaporated<br>
in vacuo to yield (3-oxo-l,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-l-yl)phosphonic<br>
acid dimethyl ester as a white solid (32.0 g, 95 %, 95 % purity). Thi<br>
was then used without further purification in the next stage.<br>

fluoro-5-formylbenzonitrile (20.9 g, 0.14 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (13(j)<br>
ml) was added triethylamine (14 ml, 0.14 mol) drop-wise over 25 min,<br>
with the temperature kept below 15°C. The reaction mixture was warmed<br>
slowly to 20°C over 1 hour and concentrated in vacuo. The white<br>
residue was slurried in water (250 ml) for 30 minutes, filtered,<br>
washed with water, hexane and ether, and dried to yield 2-fluoro-5-(3-<br>

hydroxide (26.1 g in 50 ml water) solution and the reaction mixture<br>
was heated under nitrogen to 90°C for 30 minutes. The reaction mixturk<br>
was partially cooled to 70°C, and hydrazine hydrate (100 ml) was added<br>
and stirred for 18 hours at 70°C. The reaction was cooled to room<br>
temperature and acidified with 2M HC1 to pH 4. The mixture was stirreji<br>
for 10 min and filtered. The resulting solid was washed with water,<br>
hexane, ether, ethyl acetate and dried to yield 2-fluoro-5-(4-oxo-3,4 -<br>

Example 20<br>
In order to assess the inhibitory action of the compounds, the<br>
following assay was used to determine IC50 values.<br>
Mammalian PARP, isolated from Hela cell nuclear extract, was incubate^<br>
with Z-buffer (25mM Hepes (Sigma); 12.5 mM MgCl2 (Sigma); 50mM KC1<br>
(Sigma); I mM DTT (Sigma); 10% Glycerol (Sigma) 0.001% NP-40 (Sigma);<br>
pH 7.4) in 96 well FlashPlates (TRADE MARK) (NEN, UK) and varying<br>
concentrations of said inhibitors added. All compounds were diluted iiji<br>
DMSO and gave final assay concentrations of between 10 and 0.01 (iM,<br>
with the DMSO being at a final concentration of 1% per well. The tota<br>
assay volume per well was 40 μ1.<br>
After 10 minutes incubation at 30°C the reactions were initiated by the<br>
addition of a 10 ^il reaction mixture, containing NAD (5uM), 3H-NAD and<br>
30mer double stranded DNA-oligos. Designated positive and negative<br>
reaction wells were done in combination with compound wells (unknowns;<br>
in order to calculate % enzyme activities. The plates were then<br>
shaken for 2 minutes and incubated at 30°C for 45 minutes.<br>
Following the incubation, the reactions were quenched by the addition<br>
of 50 \il 30% acetic acid to each well. The plates were then shaken<br>
for 1 hour at room temperature.<br>
The plates were transferred to a TopCount NXT (TRADE MARK) (Packard,<br>
UK) for scintillation counting. Values recorded are counts per minut<br>
 (cpm) following a 30 second counting of each well.<br>
The % enzyme activity for each compound is then calculated using the<br>
following equation:<br>
(cpm of unknowns -mean negative cpm) ]}<br>
% Inhibition =100 { lOOx——<br>
(mean positive cpm-mean neagative cpm),/<br>
IC50 values (the concentration at which 50% of the enzyme activity is<br>
inhibited) were calculated, which are determined over a range of<br>
different concentrations, normally from 10 ^M down to 0.001 μM. Such<br>
IC50 values are used as comparative values to identify increased<br>
compound potencies.<br>

The Potentiation Factor (PF50) for compounds is calculated as a ratio<br>
of the IC50 of control cell growth divided by the IC50 of cell growth +<br>
PARP inhibitor. Growth inhibition curves for both control and compound<br>
treated cells are in the presence of the alkylating agent methyl<br>
methanesulfonate (MMS). The test compounds were used at a fixed<br>
concentration of 0.2 micromolar. The concentrations of MMS were over<br>
a range from 0 to 10 ng/ml.<br>
Cell growth was assessed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay<br>
(Skehan, P., et al., (1990) New colorimetric cytotoxicity assay for<br>
anticancer-drug screening. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82, 1107-1112.).<br>
2,000 HeLa cells were seeded into each well of a flat-bottomed 96-wel<br>
microtiter plate in a volume of 100 |al and incubated for 6 hours at<br>
37°C. Cells were either replaced with media alone or with media<br>
containing PARP inhibitor at a final concentration of 0.5, 1 or 5 (iM.<br>
Cells were allowed to grow for a further 1 hour before the addition<br>
of MMS at a range of concentrations (typically 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 1<br>
(xg/ml) to either untreated cells or PARP inhibitor treated cells.<br>
Cells treated with PARP inhibitor alone were used to assess the growt<br>
inhibition by the PARP inhibitor.<br>
Cells were left for a further 16 hours before replacing the media and<br>
allowing the cells to grow for a further 72 hours at 37°C. The media<br>
was then removed and the cells fixed with lOOjal of ice cold 10% (w/v)<br>
trichloroacetic acid. The plates were incubated at 4°C for 20<br>
minutes and then washed four times with water. Each well of cells wa<br>
then stained with lOOjal of 0.4% (w/v) SRB in 1% acetic acid for 20<br>
minutes before washing four times with 1% acetic acid. Plates were<br>
then dried for 2 hours at room temperature. The dye from the stained<br>
cells was solubilized by the addition of 100μl of lOmM Tris Base into<br>
each well. Plates were gently shaken and left at room temperature fo<br>
30 minutes before measuring the optical density at 564nM on a<br>
Microquant microtiter plate reader.<br>
All the compounds tested had a PF50 at 200nM of at least 2.0.<br>

Materials and Methods<br>
Small molecule inhibitors of PARP:<br>
Compound (4) was dissolved in DMSO at lOmM and stored at -20°C in tl<br>
dark.<br>
Cell Lines<br>
VC8 cells and the mouse Brca2 BAG complemented derivatives were as<br>
described in M. Kraakman-van der Zwet, et al., Mol Cell Biol 22, 669-<br>
79 (2002)). ES cells defective in Brca2 function have been described<br>
previously (Tutt, et al., EMBO Rep 3, 255-60 (2002)). The construction<br>
of ES cells defective in Brcal will be described elsewhere but have<br>
previously been validated (Foray, et al., Embo J, 22, 2860-71 (2003))<br>
Clonogenic Assays<br>
For measurement of cellular sensitivity to a PARP inhibitor (compound<br>
4), cell cultures in exponential growth were trypsinised and seeded at<br>
various densities in 6-well plates onto Mitomycin C inactivated mouse<br>
embryonic fibroblasts and where appropriate treated with the test<br>
compound after 18 hours. For continuous exposure, cells were re-fed<br>
every 4 days with fresh medium and inhibitor. After 10-14 days, cells<br>
were washed with PBS, fixed in methanol and stained with crystal<br>
violet. Colonies containing greater than approximately 50 cells were<br>
counted. Experiments were performed at least three times in<br>
triplicate.<br>
Results<br>
Reduction in the viability of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficient cells<br>
Compound 4 was used to probe the sensitivity of cells deficient in<br>
Brcal or Brca2 to the inhibition of PARP activity. Clonogenic assays<br>
showed that both Brcal and Brca2 deficient cell lines were extremely<br>
sensitive to compound 4 compared to otherwise isogenic cells (Fig. 1A<br>
IB). The SF50 (dosage at which 50% of cells survived) for Compound 4<br>
was 1.5 x 10"8M for cells deficient in Brcal, whilst the SF50 for<br>
matched wild type cells was 7 x 10"6M (Figure 1A). This represents a<br>
factor of 467 fold enhanced sensitivity of Brcal mutant cells compare^<br>
to wild type cells.<br>
The SF50 for Compound 4 was 1.2 x 10-8M for cells deficient in Brca2<br>
whilst the SF50 for matched wild type cells was 1.8 x 10"5M (Figure IB)<br>
This represents a factor of 1,500 fold enhanced sensitivity of Brca2<br>
mutant cells compared to wild type cells. Similar results were<br>
obtained with Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in Brca2 (VC8)<br>
compared to a Brca2-complememted derivative (VC8-BAC)(Figure 2). The<br>
SF50 for Compound 4 was 5 x 10"8M for the Brca2 deficient VC8 line<br>
whilst the SF50 for matched control, VC8-BAC, was 3 x 10'5M (Figure 2)<br>
This represents a factor of 600 fold enhanced sensitivity of Brca2<br>
mutant cells compared to wild type cells.<br><br><br>
