	COVER FOR ACCUMULATOR CONTAINERS<br>
	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The invention is about a cover for accumulator containers of the starter type,<br>
usually installed on motor vehicles.<br>
5 	It is known that, in the accumulators manufacture, proper containers are used,<br>
made of materials like, for example, synthetic resins based on polyvinyl<br>
chloride, polypropylene, celluloid, able to resist the action of an acid or a base,<br>
commonly called electrolyte, placed inside the container.<br>
	A plurality of electrodes, consisting of metal plates, is disposed inside the<br>
10 container and it is connected to the positive pole and the negative pole of a<br>
current generator.<br>
	The container is closed at its upper opening by means of a cover that, in plan<br>
view, generally has a rectangular shape.<br>
	This cover is provided with a plurality of through holes, through which the<br>
15 	electrolyte is introduced during the so called accumulator formation phase or<br>
	during said accumulator recharge operation.<br>
	The cover consists in practice of a main body, shaped according to the<br>
	constructional and aesthetical requests of the customers.<br>
	In fact, the need to customize the cover of the containers used in the<br>
20 	accumulators manufacture is more and more spread.<br>
	The customers, to gain a competitive advantage towards the competitors in a<br>
	technical field which has become overstocked in the last years, require the<br>
	manufacturers to provide for covers which are as different as possible from the<br>
	others at the point of sale or, for example, when they are offered to the main<br>
25 	car manufacturers.<br>
	Therefore, the main inconvenience related to the manufacture of this<br>
	component for accumulator containers is due to the fact that the manufacturers<br>
	are obliged to carry out as many covers as the different requests of this<br>
	sector's market are.<br>
30 	This involves the need to prepare proper manufacturin moulds for each single<br>
	article, with the obvious disadvantages this means in terms of productive costs.<br>
	Besides that, another inconvenience is due to the fact that, to meet the<br>
	different customers demands, the manufacturer has to set up at any time a<br>
	new and complete production, with the consequence that the manufacturing<br>
35 	and delivering times of the cover are inevitably prolonged.<br><br>
-2-A<br><br>
	Not the least inconvenience is due to the fact that, if the manufacturer decides<br>
	to maintain in stock even small quantities of different covers, he must manage<br>
	a rather high number of codes, certainly greater than that generated by more<br>
	standardized productions.<br>
5 	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention intends to overcome the aforementioned<br>
	inconveniences.<br>
	In particular, the main object of the invention is to provide for a cover for<br>
	accumulator containers which allows a higher productive standardization,<br>
10 	although supplying differentiated products to the market, able to meet the<br>
	different customers needs.<br>
	It is another object of the invention to reduce the costs related to the availability<br>
	of moulds suitable for manufacturing any type of cover for accumulator<br>
	containers.<br>
15 	It is a further object of the invention to reduce the manufacturing and delivering<br>
	times of cover for accumulator containers, in order to satisfy in a quicker way<br>
	the customers needs relative to the times allowed by the prior art.<br>
	Said objects are obtained by a cover for containers suitable for being used in<br>
	the accumulators manufacture which, according to the main claim, comprises a<br>
20 	main body for closing said container, provided with a plurality of first through<br>
	holes for supplying the electrolyte, at which a shaped cap raised from the<br>
	upper wall of said main body is formed, wherein said main body and said<br>
	shaped cap are two separated pieces connected through joining means.<br>
	Advantageously, the invention allows the manufacturer to meet the different<br>
25 	customers needs in a quicker way with respect to the prior art.<br>
	More advantageously, the invention allows the manufacturers to customize the<br>
	cover shape and colour according to the customers needs, without requiring to<br>
	bear economic investments for manufacturing moulds dedicated for each<br>
	execution.<br>
30 	Still advantageously, the invention provides for covers having rather appealing<br>
	aesthetical features.<br>
	Furthermore advantageously, with the invention, the costs related to the<br>
	manufacture of covers for accumulator containers are reduced with respect to<br>
	the prior art.<br>
35 	In fact, each manufacturing mould is composed by a first mould, of more<br><br><br>
-3-<br><br>
	articulate design, common to the manufacture of each model, and a second<br>
less complicated mould, which is modified according to the customers requests<br>
and tastes.<br>
	BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
5 	Said objects and advantages, and others better specified in the following<br>
description, will be better highlighted in the description of preferred executive<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The cover of the invention is shown in FIG. 1, where it is generally indicated<br>
with numeral 1, applied to a container C used for carrying out accumulators<br>
installed, for instance, on motor vehicles.<br>
30 One can see that the cover 1 comprises a main body 2 for closing the<br>
container C, provided with a plurality of not visible first through holes for<br>
supplying the electrolyte, being it an acid or a base, inside the container C.<br>
	A shaped cap 3 is formed at the first through holes, being raised from the<br>
upper wall 2a of the main body 2.<br>
35 According to the invention, the main body 2 and the shaped cap 3 are two<br><br><br>
-4-<br><br>
separated pieces connected through joining means, generally indicated with <br>
numeral 4.<br>
	Moreover, on the main body 2 the positive and negative poles, generally<br>
	indicated with numerals 13 and 14, are formed, used to perform the common<br>
5 	operations of accumulator charge and car electrical equipment connection.<br>
	FIG8. 1, 2 and 3 show that the shaped cap 3 and the main body 2 comprise a<br>
	common through hole 15 which, according to what is well known in this<br>
	technical field, is used for positioning a feeler used to check the charge<br>
	condition of the accumulator.<br>
10 	The cover 1 also comprises a handle 9, grasping which the user easily<br>
	transports the container C.<br>
	As evidenced in FiGs. 4 and 5, the joining means 4 comprise profiles,<br>
	generally indicated with numeral 5, joined to the shaped cap 3, and opposite<br>
	profiles, generally indicated with numeral 6, joined to the main body 2, which<br>
15 	are mutually snap coupled by pressure.<br>
	More particularly, FIG. 4 shows that the profiles 5 consist of a plurality of caps<br>
7 	disposed on the lower wall 3a of the shaped cap 3.<br>
	Preferably, the caps 7 form a single body with the shaped cap 3, since they are<br>
	both obtained with a injection moulding process of plastic materials, but it is<br>
20 	evident that, in other executive embodiments, they could be coupled with the<br>
	shaped cap through proper connection means.<br>
	The opposite profiles 6 consist instead of the aforementioned first through<br>
	holes, generally indicated with numeral 2b in FIG. 5, through which the<br>
	electrolyte supply inside the container C takes place.<br>
11 	Therefore, the caps 7 are inserted in the through holes 2b to form the joining<br>
	means 4 as a whole, when the shaped cap 3 is coupled with the main body 2.<br>
	According to the preferred executive embodiment hereby described, the<br>
	shaped cap 3 has a substantially T shaped plan outline 3' as shown in detail<br>
	in FIGs, 1, 2 and 4.<br>
30 	Said cap is provided with a peripheral edge 3b, to be externally coupled with<br>
	the perimeter of a raised edge 8, well visible in FIG. 5, and having a<br>
	substantially T shaped plan outline 8' too, which is raised from the upper wall<br>
	2a of the main body 2.<br>
	The first through holes 2b are obtained justatthe plane 16 delimited by the<br>
35 	raised edge 8 of the main body 2.<br><br>
-5-<br><br>
	Still in FIG. 5 it is shown that the handle 9 is coupled with the main body 2<br>
through joining means, generally indicated with numeral 10, preferably but not<br>
necessarily consisting of a through hole, not visible in the annexed drawings,<br>
obtained in each of the free ends 9a, 9b of the handle 9, in which a pin 11, 12<br>
5 protruding from the raised edge 8 of the main body 2 is inserted.<br>
	It is to be understood that, in other executive embodiments of the invention, the<br>
handle could be coupled with the main body through different fasteners but of<br>
known type per se.<br>
	In further embodiments of the invention, said handle could be coupled with the<br>
10 	shaped cap instead of the main body to which said cap is then fixed.<br>
	Another executive embodiment of the cover of the invention, generally<br>
	indicated with numeral 100, is shown in FIG. 6, which is different from that<br>
	previously described with reference to FIGs. 1 to 5 in that the joining means,<br>
	generally indicated with numeral 103, comprise in this case a welding layer,<br>
15 	not visible in the drawings, made at walls, generally indicated with numeral 104<br>
	and visible in FIGs. 8 and 9 only, projecting from the lower wall 102a of the<br>
	shaped cap 102 and from the upper wall 101a of the main body 101.<br>
	It is evident that, in other executive embodiments of the invention, the welding<br>
	layer which provides for the joining means could be made at the lower edge of<br>
20 	the shaped cap and at the upper edge of the main body.<br>
	According to further executive embodiments of the invention, the joining means<br>
	could comprise an adhesive layer made at the lower edge of the shaped cap<br>
	and at the upper edge of the main body.<br>
	Preferably but not necessarily, the joining means also 103 comprise profiles,<br>
25 	generally indicated with numeral 105, joined to the shaped cap 102, and<br>
	opposite profiles, generally indicated with numeral 106, joined to the main body<br>
	101.<br>
	Jusl the profiles 105 and the opposite profiles 106 define another substantial<br>
	difference in the cover 100 with respect to the cover 1.<br>
30 	In fact, the profiles 105 still consist of a plurality of caps, generally indicated<br>
	with numeral 107 in FIG. 6, but they are coupled with the upper wall 102a of<br>
	the shaped cap 102 and thus they are externally visible.<br>
	The caps 107 are inserted in the opposite profiles 106, which now consist not<br>
	only of first through holes, generally indicated with numeral 101b, obtained in<br>
35 	the main body 101, butalsoofa plurality of second through holes, generally<br><br>
- 6 -<br><br>
indicated with numeral 102b, obtained in the shaped cap 102.<br>
	The second through holes 102b define a longitudinal axis which substantially<br>
	coincides with the longitudinal axis defined by the first through holes 101b.<br>
	Therefore, the cover 100 of FIG. 6 allows the user to top up with water the<br>
5 	accumulator when the common maintenance operations have to be performed.<br>
	On the other hand, the aesthetical effect provided by the cover of FIG. 1 is<br>
	better, since it is lacking elements, like said caps, which interrupt the continuity<br>
	of the visible surface and which have a merely technical purpose.<br>
	it should be intended that, in further executive embodiments of the invention, in<br>
10 	which the shaped cap is still coupled with the main body through a welding<br>
	layer, the caps could be disposed again on the lower wall of the shaped cap,<br>
	providing for a combination of the embodiment of FIG, 1 with that of FIG. 6.<br>
	According to the preferred executive embodiment hereby described, the<br>
	welding layer consist of a heat seal but, in other embodiments, it could consist<br>
15 	of different but of known per se welding methods, for instance by ultrasounds.<br>
	Another executive embodiment of the cover, generally indicated with numeral<br>
	200, is shown in FIG. 10, which is primarily different from those previously<br>
	described for the particular shape of the shaped cap 202 supported by the<br>
	main body 201, which is instead of the same shape.<br>
20 	Furthermore, in this case, the shaped cap 202 is composed by a first element<br>
	204, shown in the two views of FlGs. 11 and 12, which is disposed close to<br>
	said main body 201, and by a second element 205, shown in FIG. 13, which is<br>
	disposed to cover said first element 204.<br>
	One can see that the profiles 206, consisting of the caps 207, are disposed on<br>
25 	the lower surface 204a of the first element 204, and thus they will be snap<br>
	coupled with opposite profiles, not shown in the drawings, obtained in the main<br>
	body 201.<br>
	The joining means, generally indicated with numeral 203 and consisting of the<br>
	usual welding layer, will be provided on the projecting walls 208 obtained on<br>
30 	the upper surface 204b of the first element 204 and on the corresponding<br>
	projecting walls 208 obtained on the lower surface 205a of the second element<br>
	205.<br>
	This constructional embodiment provides for a particularly high structural<br>
	stability level of the shaped cap.<br>
35 	The projecting walls 208 of the first element 204 and the second element 205<br><br>
-7-<br><br>
	form the labyrinth along which the gases generated by the electrochemical<br>
processes which take place in each electrolytic cell during the accumulator<br>
charge are canalized, before being discharged to the outside through an outlet<br>
mouth 209 obtained on the second element 205.<br>
5 	As it is known, due to upsettings, rotations and overturnings of the<br>
accumulator, for example during its handling, part of the electrolytic liquid exits<br>
from the cells through the through holes of the main body 201.<br>
if the liquid discharged from the ceils reaches the outlet mouth 209, the<br>
	efficiency condition of the accumulator could be at least partially compromised.<br>
10 	The function of the labyrinth is thus to prolong the path of the electrolyte<br>
	outgoing from the cells, preventing it to reach the outlet mouth 209.<br>
	This basic aspect, required by the market standards and by the rules on the<br>
	matter, is connected to another undoubtedly important advantage achieved by<br>
	the labyrinth of the cover 200 with respect to the embodiments described so<br>
15	 far, in particular that of FIGs. 8 and 9.<br>
	In fact, in the latter executive embodiment, the coupling between the main<br>
	body 101 and the shaped cap 102 takes place by welding or by gluing,<br>
	generally performed at the corresponding projecting walls 104, after that the<br>
	accumulator charge phase is finished.<br>
20 	However, as previously mentioned, since the electrolyte exits from the through<br>
	holes 101b during the charge phase, before performing the welding process it<br>
	is necessary to perfectly clean the upper surface of the main body 101 and to<br>
	wait that said surface is well dry, otherwise it is impossible to carry out the<br>
	operation or to perform it in a correct way.<br>
25 	On the contrary, with the embodiment of FIG, 10 and the subsequent ones, the<br>
	cleaning of the upper surface of the main body 201 after the electrolyte topping<br>
	up is no more needed, since said body and the shaped cap 202 are pressure-<br>
	coupled.<br>
	Here, the projecting walls 208 are disposed in the first element 204 and in the<br>
30 	second element 205, so that the gas discharging labyrinth is located inside the<br>
	shaped cap 202 and no more between said cap and the main body, as it<br>
	happens instead in the cover 100.<br>
	The labyrinth communicates with the interior of the accumulator by means of<br>
	the through holes obtained on the main body 201.<br>
35 	The welding or the gluing is performed on the projecting walls 208 of the first<br><br>
8<br><br>
	204 and the second element 205, which are both integrally made of plastic<br>
material, and thus the shaped cap 202 is obtained.<br>
	Said cap is then coupled with the main body 201 without performing any<br>
	welding operation, that is by snap coupling the profiles 206 inside the opposite<br>
5 	profiles present in the main body 201.<br>
	Therefore, the above described tricks or cleaning treatment of the upper<br>
	surface of the main body 201 are no more needed.<br>
	In conclusion, the embodiment of FIG. 10 has the considerable advantage of<br>
	simplifying the application of the cover 200 to the container, allowing the<br>
10 	manufacturers, especially the accumulator factories, to reduce the accumulator<br>
	manufacturing costs and times.<br>
	Operatively, the manufacturer disposes the main body 2, 101 to close the<br>
	container C and applies the handle 9,108 thereto, by the insertion of the pins,<br>
	of the type indicated with numerals 11, 12 in FIG. 5, inside the through holes<br>
15 	obtained at the ends 9a, 9b and 108a, 108b of the corresponding handles 9,<br>
	108.<br>
	Subsequently, the manufacturer externally couples the shaped cap 3, 102 with<br>
	the main body 2,101, thus completing the preparation of the cover 1,100.<br>
	On the contrary, the embodiment of FIG, 10 is different because it is required<br>
20 	at first to couple, by welding the corresponding projecting walls 208, the<br>
	second element 205 with the first element 204 and thus to snap couple the first<br>
	element 204 with the main body 201.<br>
	Therefore, by the invention, the manufacturer could carry out the shaped cap<br>
	with the specific shape and colour required by the customer, while the<br>
25 	underlying main body is produced in a standardized manner.<br>
	He is thus able to customize the cover models, at the same time maintaining<br>
	as uniform as possible the production, in particular of that component, more<br>
	complex to manufacture, that is the main body, which is disposed to close the<br>
	container.<br>
30 	So, he should merely modify the shaped cap mould, easier to manufacture,<br>
	being able to meet each single customer's need anyhow.<br>
	Consequently, the manufacturer reduces the costs related to the production of<br>
	this kind of components, as well as the articles delivering lead time, in order to<br>
	satisfy in a quicker way the needs of all the customers.<br>
35 	On the basis of the aforesaid description, it should be understood that the<br><br>
-9-<br><br>
	cover of the invention achieves all the aforementioned objects and<br>
	advantages.<br>
	Modifications to the cover of the invention could be introduced in the executive<br>
	stage, consisting for instance in a different shape of the shaped cap with<br>
5 	respect to those described and shown in the present description.<br>
	Besides that, different executive embodiments of the invention could be<br>
	introduced, in which the joining means are of different kind with respect to that<br>
	previously described and shown, without impairing the advantage provided by<br>
	the present patent.<br>
10 	All the described and cited, but not shown in the figures of the annexed<br>
	drawings, embodiments, if they fall within the scope of protection of the<br>
	following claims, should be intended as protected by the present patent.<br><br>
