				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved method for solubilising an oil-soluble<br>
pigment efficiently in an oil or fat by extraction of a solid preparation containing the<br>
oil-soluble pigment, where the extraction takes place in the presence of water, an<br>
edible oil or fat and a nonionic surfactant. It also relates to the composition<br>
prepared by the extraction, and the use of this composition in animal feed to<br>
produce feed pellets. The combination of water and nonionic surfactant increases<br>
the amount of pigment that is extracted and solubilised.<br>
In animal feed compositions, pigments are often added to endow an appealing<br>
colour to the meat or skin of the animals consuming the feed. The pigments used<br>
may be natural, synthesized or fermented, and commonly they are oil-soluble. An<br>
example of a class of oil-soluble pigments is the carotenoids, e.g. astaxanthin,<br>
canthaxanthin and [beta]-carotene. These are insoluble in water, and have a low<br>
solubility in organic solvents, fats and oils. Astaxanthin and canthaxanthin are<br>
commonly used in fish feed to improve the flesh colour of salmonids, but also give<br>
rise to health benefits. Other uses for pigment in animal feed is for the coloration of<br>
the skin of some marine warm-water or tropical freshwater fishes, e.g. of the red<br>
seabream, and to endow a pink color to the shell and flesh of prawns. In addition to<br>
these aqua-cultural uses, the coloring of egg yolks and of the skin of broilers are<br>
other feed application areas.<br>
Conventional feed pellets are usually formed from a solid base material, which may<br>
be protein-based such as fishmeal or carbohydrate-based such as starch, and where<br>
the base material is loaded with a fat or an oil component. The fat or oil, that could<br>
be either of animal or vegetable origin, is loaded into pores of the precursor feed<br>
pellets formed from the base material. The fat or oil increases the energy content of<br>
the feed. Other ingredients of the feed are e.g. vitamins<br><br><br>
minerals, enzymes and the above-mentioned pigments. These latter ingredients,<br>
as well as the fat or oil, are preferably added after the pelletizing step, since the oil<br>
component interferes with the pelletizing process and many of the pigments lose<br>
their activity when heated. Many of the sensitive pigments are available in coated<br>
form, e.g. Carophyll® Pink, which is sold in the form of beadlets. The beadlets of<br>
this product consist of a core of astaxanthin emulsified in antioxidants and residing<br>
in a matrix of gelatine and carbohydrate, which core is coated by maize starch.<br>
The amount of astaxanthin is at least 8% of the beadlet. There is also another<br>
astaxanthin product of a similar kind that is called Carophyll® Pink 10% CWS,<br>
which differs from the first-mentioned product only in that the matrix is a<br>
lignosulfonate. If these beadlets are added as such to the preformed pellets, most<br>
of them are deposited only on the pellets surface. Especially for aqua-cultural<br>
feed this is a disadvantage, since the beadlets will be washed away when the feed<br>
comes into contact with water. Also the bioavailability will be less when the<br>
pigments are still contained in the beadlets.<br>
In EP 839 004-B1 a method is disclosed for loading bioactive ingredients, such as<br>
pigments, into feed pellets. The process includes the steps of removing the gelatin<br>
and carbohydrate protective shell around the bioactive ingredient enzymatically or<br>
by hydrolysis, mixing the uncoated bioactive ingredient with a fat or an oil and<br>
loading porous precursor feed pellets with the resulting mixture to produce the<br>
feed pellets.<br>
In JP7-16075-A a method is described of making a water-soluble pigment<br>
solubilised in fat. Firstly polyols are dissolved in water and mixed with the water-<br>
soluble pigment, and then an oil-phase containing an emulsifier is added to obtain<br>
an emulsion of the water-soluble pigment in oil.<br>
In JP7-23736-A a method is described of making a carotenoid pigment solubilised<br>
in water, where pH is made alkaline, cyclodextrins are mixed to the water and the<br>
pigment and finally the pH is restored to neutral.<br><br>
EP 682 874-A2 discloses a bioactive feed pellet, where the bioactive ingredient<br>
could be for example a pigment. The bioactive ingredient is applied to the pellet in<br>
the form of a primary coating dispersion and/or emulsion and/or solution in a fatty<br>
component or a mixture of dietary oil, said component or dietary oil comprises a<br>
triglyceride and/or fatty acid thereof having a melting point of above 35°C. A<br>
second coating layer of an oily product is then applied. In case the bioactive<br>
compound to be added is not miscible with the suspending aid, a dispersing or<br>
emulsifying agent can be added to improve the mixing properties. Examples of<br>
such emulsifiers that are mentioned are distilled monoglycerides, polyunsaturated<br>
polyglycerol esters of fatty acids and sorbitan fatty acid esters; saturated<br>
monoglycerides are preferred.<br>
From the references cited above, it is evident that the extraction of oil-soluble<br>
pigments from solid preparations, such as from the above-mentioned beadlets,<br>
needs further improvement.<br>
Now it has surprisingly been found that when the extraction of a solid preparation,<br>
containing an oil-soluble pigment, with a hydrophobic extraction medium, such as<br>
an oil or a fat, is performed in the presence of water and a nonionic surfactant, the<br>
extraction and solubilisation of the pigment are essentially improved.<br>
In detail the process of the invention relates to a method for solubilising an oil-<br>
soluble pigment into an oil or fat by extraction of a solid preparation containing the<br>
oil-soluble pigment comprising the steps of<br>
a)	mixing the solid preparation containing the pigment with water, an extraction<br>
medium containing an edible oil or fat, and a nonionic surfactant having a<br>
hydrocarbyl group, an acyl group or a substituted hydrocarbyl or acyl group<br>
containing at least 6 carbon atoms, and<br>
b)	optionally centrifugalize the mixture obtained and separate the oil phase<br><br>
This method will lead to a more effective extraction of the pigment from the solid<br>
preparation and a more effective solubilisation of the pigment into the oil or fat.<br>
The originally obtained mixture or the separated oil phase may then be added to<br>
porous precursor feed pellets to produce feed pellets. These pellets will have a<br>
higher amount of oil-soluble pigment available for uptake into the animal.<br>
One embodiment of the process of the invention, where the solid pigment<br>
preparation is a coated pigment, such as a beadlet described above, comprises<br>
the following steps:<br>
a)	the coated pigment is agitated in water at a temperature between 4 and 100°C,<br>
and the edible oil or fat comprising the nonionic surfactant is added to the mixture<br>
obtained at a temperature of from the melting point of the oil or fat to 100°C with<br>
agitation, or<br>
the coated pigment and the nonionic surfactant are agitated in water at a<br>
temperature between 4 and 100°C, and the edible oil or fat is added with agitation<br>
to the pigment-surfactant mixture at a temperature of from the melting point of the<br>
oil or fat to100°C<br>
b)	optionally the mixture obtained is centrifugalized and the oil phase is separated<br>
c)	the mixture obtained by step a) or the separated oil phase obtained by step b) is<br>
added to porous precursor feed pellets to produce feed pellets.<br>
There are several advantages using the method of the present invention. The<br>
method is more effective than the prior art methods in extracting and solubilising<br>
the pigments, so that a larger proportion of the pigments will be extracted from the<br>
solid preparation and will be present in the oil phase. This is demonstrated in the<br>
examples, where the method of EP 839 004-B1 to enzymatically, in the presence<br>
of water, break down the gelatin and carbohydrate protective shell around the<br>
pigment to set it free from a solid preparation (beadlet) is compared to the method<br>
of the present invention where the addition of water and a nonionic surfactant<br>
more effectively sets the pigment free. Since the extraction and solubilisation of<br>
the pigment are more effective, the method of the present invention will lead to a<br><br>
higher concentration of pigment in the oil. This will in turn lead to a larger<br>
proportion of pigment that is kept in the pellets that are loaded with this oil or fat.<br>
Further, the oil-phase is not so easily washed away as the untreated beadlets.<br>
Also, there will be a better bioavailability when the pigments are solubilised to a<br>
larger extent in the oil (see Bjerkeng, B. et al, Bioavailability of all-E-astaxanthin<br>
and Z-isomers of astaxanthin in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss),<br>
Aquaculture 157,63-82).<br>
The dispersion or oil phase comprises an edible oil or fat, one or more oil-soluble<br>
pigments and one or more nonionic surfactants, and the invention also relates to<br>
such a composition suitable for use in loading pellets to be used as animal feed. A<br>
suitable composition would be an edible oil or fat comprising 0.25-15%, preferably<br>
2-10% and most preferably 4-10% by weight of one or more nonionic surfactants,<br>
where the surfactant is an ester, an alkoxylate of an ester or an alkoxylate of an<br>
alcohol, preferably a castor oil ethoxylate with 2-40, preferably 2-25 and most<br>
preferably 4-20 moles of ethylene oxide, or a diacetyl tartaric acid ester of mono-<br>
and/or diglycerides; 0.0005 to 1% by weight, preferably 0.0005 to 0.3% by weight,<br>
more preferably 0.0005 to 0.2% by weight and most preferably 0.0005 to 0.1% by<br>
weight, of one or more oil-soluble pigments; and 0-20% by weight of other<br>
components including water. The other components could be vitamins, enzymes,<br>
anti-oxidants, residues from the beadlets' gelatine and carbohydrates, minerals,<br>
prophylactic agents, pharmacologically active compounds, flavouring agents,<br>
preservatives and other common feed additives. The water present in the<br>
composition is dissolved or emulsified in the oil by the surfactant, and would<br>
normally range between 0.1% and 15% by weight.<br>
The edible oil or fat may be a fish-oil, such as menhaden oil, herring oil, sardine<br>
oil, tobis oil or capelin oil, hydrogenated fish-oil, castor oil, rapeseed oil,<br>
hydrogenated rapeseed oil, corn oil, soybean oil, hydrogenated soybean oil, sun<br>
flower oil, hydrogenated sun flower oil, olive oil, hydrogenated olive oil, palm oil,<br><br>
hydrogenated palm oil, coconut oil, hydrogenated coconut oil, tallow or lard.<br>
Hydrogenated oil is normally needed when the total amount of oil or fat is high,<br>
such as for total amounts of oil or fat in fish-feed of 26% (w/w) or higher (counted<br>
on the total pellet weight). The amount hydrogenated oil or fat that is present in<br>
these pellets is normally between 0.2 to 10% (w/w) of the total amount of oil or fat.<br>
The pigment is preferably a carotenoid, which could belong to either of the sub-<br>
groups carotenes or xanthophylls. Suitable xanthophylls are lutein, zeaxanthin,<br>
canthaxanthin, astaxanthin or p-cryptoxanthin, and suitable carotenes are P-<br>
carotene, alfa-carotene and lycopene. Examples of commercial products<br>
containing these pigments are Carophyll® Pink (Hoffman LaRoche; min 8% (w/w)<br>
astaxanthin), Lucantin® Pink (BASF; min 10% (w/w) astaxanthin), Lucarotin® 10%<br>
Feed (BASF; min 10% (w/w) p -carotene), Lucantin® Red (BASF; min 10%<br>
canthaxanthin) and Rovimix (Hoffman LaRoche; min 10% (w/w) p-carotene).<br>
The surfactant should be a nonionic surfactant, such as an ester, an alkoxylate of<br>
an ester or an alkoxylate of an alcohol. Preferred nonionic surfactants are sorbitan<br>
esters, ethoxylated sorbitan esters, tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides,<br>
alkoxylated fats, oils or other esters, and alkoxylated alcohols. The most preferred<br>
nonionic surfactants are castor oil ethoxylates, preferably castor oil ethoxylates<br>
with 2-40 moles, more preferably with 2-25 moles, and most preferably with 4-20<br>
moles of ethylene oxide per mol castor oil. Experiments have also been made to<br>
use an ionic surfactant, such as a native lecithin, but the results were not as good<br>
as when using a nonionic surfactant. Certain nonionics perform better with certain<br>
pigments. For example, castor oil ethoxylates are especially suited to be used for<br>
the solubilisation of astaxanthin and canthaxanthin, whereas diacetyl tartaric acid<br>
esters of mono- and diglycerides are especially suited for the solubilisation of p-<br>
carotene. A comparison between some castor oil ethoxylates with different<br>
amounts of ethylene oxide, and consequently different HLB-values, and the<br>
corresponding mixtures of sorbitan monooleate +20EO and sorbitan monooleate<br><br>
having the same HLB-values show that the castor oil ethoxylates having up to 25<br>
moles of ethylene oxide are much more efficient in solubilising astaxanthin.<br>
The porous precursor feed pellets could be manufactured by any known method,<br>
e.g. extrusion, and from any commonly used material, such as carbohydrates or<br>
protein. When loading the precursor feed pellets, the temperature should be high<br>
enough to keep the fat or oil in a liquid state, but not above the decomposition<br>
temperature of the pigment. A suitable temperature is between the melting point of<br>
the fat or oil and 60°C. The loading of the feed pellets with the pigment-containing<br>
oil could be performed by mixing, dipping, spraying, coating or other commonly<br>
used means.<br>
A suitable pellet composition, obtained by loading precursor feed pellets with the<br>
above-mentioned oil or fat composition, has an amount of oil between 1 and 50%,<br>
preferably between 3 and 45% and most preferably between 5 and 40%, by weight<br>
of the loaded feed pellets.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
10% (w/w) of Carophyll® Pink1 was mixed with 90% (w/w) water at a temperature<br>
of 60°C with stirring. After cooling to room temperature a formulation was made<br>
containing 7.5% (w/w) of the mixture and 92.5% (w/w) of a surfactant/fish-oil<br>
mixture (sample type A), the formulation was stirred for 2 minutes at a temperature<br>
of ca 45°C and the next day it was centrifugalized at 5000 rpm (G=34000m/s2) for<br>
5 minutes. A sample was taken with a syringe and filtered through a 0.2 urn<br>
micropore filter. If the sample was taken after a few days it was not necessary to<br>
centrifugalize the formulation, but the sample could be taken directly from the oil-<br>
phase and filtered. The sample was then diluted with acetone to a desired<br>
concentration, and the absorbance was measured at 474 nm. In Table 1 the<br><br>
absorbance values for different samples are displayed, which is a measure of the<br>
abilities of the different surfactants to solubilise the pigment astaxanthin. The<br>
formulation could also be made by first mixing the surfactant with the<br>
pigment/water mixture, and then mix with the fish-oil (sample type B).<br><br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The pigment used in this example was Carophyll® Pink. The procedure followed<br>
was the same as for Example 1.<br>
The recovery values are based on the assumption that the product Carophyll®<br>
Pink contains 8% astaxanthin, which is the amount astaxanthin that the producer<br>
guarantees is present.<br><br><br>
The amount of surfactant is not very critical within the investigated range.<br><br>
*for an absorbance value of &gt;0.9 there is not a linear relationship between<br>
absorbance and concentration<br>
Within this range there is a correlation between the amount of surfactant used and<br>
the amount of pigment solubilised.<br>
Example 3<br>
In this experiment the amount of pigment to be solubilised is varied from ca 25<br>
ppm, counted on the whole mixture, up to 750 ppm, and the amount of surfactant<br>
(castor oil +6EO) used is also varied.<br>
5-10% (w/w) of Lucantin® Pink CWD was mixed with 95-90% (w/w) of water at<br>
room temperature with stirring. A formulation was made containing ca 0.5-7.5%<br>
(w/w) of the mixture and ca 99.5-92.5% (w/w) of the surfactant/fish-oil mixture. The<br>
formulation was stirred for 2 minutes at a temperature of 45°C and then<br><br>
centrifugalised at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. The sample was filtered through a<br>
0.2um micropore filter and 0.400 ml of the filtrate was diluted with acetone to 100<br>
ml.<br><br><br>
The recovery values are based on the assumption that the product Lucantin®<br>
Pink CWD contains 10% astaxanthin, which is the amount astaxanthin that the<br>
producer guarantees is present.<br>
This experiment shows that for the amounts 23-136 ppm of pigment, the whole<br>
amount is easily solubilised even at the low weight ratio of 2/98 of surfactant to oil,<br>
whereas for the higher amount of 750 ppm a higher weight ratio is required.<br>
However, a weight ratio above 8/92 does not result in any increase of the amount<br>
of pigment solubilised.<br><br><br>
Lucantin® Pink CWD is a product produced by BASF that contains at least 10%<br>
(w/w) of the pigment astaxanthin. The recovery values are based on this amount<br>
of pigment in the product.<br>
Example 5<br>
In this example the castor oil ethoxylates are compared to other kinds of<br>
surfactants. The pigment used was Carophyll® Pink. The procedure followed was<br>
the same as for Example 1.<br><br><br><br>
Example 6<br>
In this example the effect of HLB-values on the solubilising ability is investigated<br>
for castor oil ethoxylates and for Tween 808/Span 809 mixtures having the same<br>
HLB-values as the castor oil ethoxylates. The pigment used was Lucantin® Pink<br>
CWD and the oil was Tobis fish-oil. The procedure was the same as in Example 1<br>
except that the pigment was mixed and stirred with the water at room temperature.<br>
All samples were of type A. The formulations contained 2g of the specific<br>
surfactant or surfactant mixture, and the weight ratio surfactant:fish-oil was 6:94.<br>
The amount of pigment/water mix was 2.57 g.<br><br><br>
The samples were then further diluted by taking 2.00 ml of the acetone solution<br>
and dilute it to 10 ml.<br>
For the castor oil ethoxylates there is a marked decline in the solubilising ability<br>
around a HLB-value of 11, whereas for the Tween 80/Span 80 mixtures the level is<br>
about the same for all mixtures and generally lower than for the castor oil<br>
ethoxylates. However, both types of compounds have an effect on the<br>
solubilisation of the pigment astaxanthin.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 11<br>
In this example a comparison is made with the enzymatic method described in the<br>
prior art. The procedure for the enzymatic method was the following:<br>
10% (w/w) of Lucantin® Pink was mixed with water, that was buffered to pH 7.5<br>
and that contained 0.5 mg/ml protease (Protease Streptomyces griseus; CAS<br>
number 9036-06-0, 5.6 units/mg solid powder), at a temperature of 55°C with<br>
stirring. The pigment/water/enzyme mixture was then stirred at 45°C for 90<br>
minutes. After cooling to room temperature a formulation was made containing<br>
7.4%(w/w) of the mixture and 92.6%(w/w) of fish-oil, the formulation was stirred for<br>
2 minutes at a temperature of ca 45°C and the next day it was centrifugalized at<br>
5000 rpm (G=34000m/s2) for 5 minutes. A sample was taken with a syringe and<br>
filtered through a 0.2 urn micropore filter. 0.400 ml of the filtrated sample was then<br>
diluted with acetone to 100 ml, and the absorbance was measured at 474 nm. The<br>
sample according to the invention was treated in the same manner, except that it<br>
contained no protease and the formulation was made by mixing with 92.6% (w/w)<br>
of castor oil +6EO/fish-oil mixture. In Table below the absorbance values for the<br>
different samples are displayed, which is a measure of the abilities of the different<br>
methods to solubilise the pigment astaxanthin.<br><br><br>
The comparison reveals that much more astaxanthin can be solubilised by using<br>
the method of the present invention than by using the enzymatic procedure<br>
disclosed in the prior art.<br>
Example 12<br>
This example is also a comparison with the enzymatic method described in the<br>
prior art. The procedure was the same as in Example 11, except that the water<br>
was buffered at pH 9.5 and contained 1.0 mg/ml or 0.35 mg/ml of a protease<br>
(Protex 6L produced by Genencor International; activity 580000 DU/g)<br><br>
The comparison reveals that also during these conditions with a higher pH, a<br>
different protease and a higher concentration of the protease, much more<br>
astaxanthin can be solubilised by using the method of the present invention than<br>
by using the enzymatic procedure disclosed in the prior art.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>

carbon atoms, and<br>
b)	optionally, centrifugalize the mixture obtained and separate the oil phase.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the solid preparation containing the<br>
pigment is a coated pigment; and<br>
the coated pigment is agitated in water at a temperature between 4 and 100°C, and the<br>
edible oil or fat comprising the nonionic surfactant is added to the mixture obtained at a<br>
temperature of from the melting point of the oil or fat to 100°C with agitation,<br>
or the coated pigment and the nonionic surfactant are agitated in water at a temperature<br>
between 4 and 100°C, and the edible oil or fat is added with agitation to the pigment-<br>
surfactant mixture at a temperature of from the melting point of the oil or fat to 100°C.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1 to 2 wherein the nonionic surfactant is an ester,<br>
an alkoxylate of an ester or an alkoxylate of an alcohol.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 3 wherein the surfactant is a castor oil ethoxylate<br>
with 2-25 moles of ethylene oxide or a diacetyl tartaric acid ester of mono- and/or<br>
diglycerides.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claim 1-4 wherein the pigment is a carotenoid.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in claim 1-5 wherein the pigment is selected from the<br>
group astaxanthin, canthaxanthin and β-carotene.<br><br>
7.	An edible oil or fat composition comprising 0.25-15% by weight of one or more<br>
nonionic surfactants as claimed in claims 1 to 4, 0.0005 to 1% by weight of one or more<br>
oil-soluble pigments, and 0-20% by weight of other components including water.<br>
8.	The composition as claimed in claim 7 wherein the pigment is a carotenoid.<br>
9.	The composition as claimed in claim 7 to 8 wherein the oil is selected from the<br>
group castor oil, a fish-oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil and soybean oil.<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to an improved method for solubilising an oil-soluble<br>
pigment efficiently in oil or fat by extraction of a solid preparation containing the<br>
oil-soluble pigment, where the extraction takes place in the presence of water, edible<br>
oil or fat and a nonionic surfactant. It also relates to the composition prepared by<br>
the extraction, and the use of this composition in animal feed to produce feed pellets.<br>
The combination of water and nonionic surfactant increases the amount of pigment<br>
that is extracted and solubilised. In detail the process of the invention relates to a<br>
method for solubilising an oil- soluble pigment into an oil or fat by extraction of a<br>
solid preparation containing the oil-soluble pigment comprising the steps of a)<br>
mixing the solid preparation containing the pigment with water, an extraction<br>
medium containing an edible oil or fat, and a nonionic surfactant having a<br>
hydrocarbyl group, an acyl group or a substituted hydrocarbyl or acyl group<br>
containing at least 6 carbon atoms b) optionally centrifugalize the mixture obtained<br>
and separate the oil phase. The originally obtained mixture or the separated oil<br>
phase may then be added to porous precursor feed pellets to produce feed pellets.<br>
These pellets will have a higher amount of oil-soluble pigment available for uptake<br>
into the animal.<br></td>
