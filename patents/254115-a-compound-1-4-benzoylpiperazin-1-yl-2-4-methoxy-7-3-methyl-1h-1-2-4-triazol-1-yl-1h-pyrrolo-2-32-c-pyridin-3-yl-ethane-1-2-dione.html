				<td>COMPOSITION AND ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY OF SUBSTITUTED<br>
AZAINDOLEOXOACETIC PIPERAZINE DERIVATIVES<br>
REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This Continuation in Part application claims the benefit of USSN 10/214,982<br>
filed August 7, 2002.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention provides compounds having drug and bio-affecting properties,<br>
their pharmaceutical compositions and method of use. In particular, the invention is<br>
concerned with azaindole piperazine diamide derivatives that possess unique antiviral<br>
activity. More particularly, the present invention relates to compounds useful for the<br>
treatment of HTV and AIDS.'<br>
Background Art<br>
HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus -1) infection remains a major medical<br>
problem, with an estimated 42 million people infected worldwide at the end of 2002.<br>
The number of cases of HTV and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has<br>
risen rapidly. In 2002, ~5.0 million new infections were reported, and 3.1 million<br>
people died from AIDS. Currently available drugs for the treatment of HIV include<br>
nine nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors or approved single pill<br>
combinations(zidovudine or AZT (or Retrovir"), didanosine (or Videx ), stavudine<br>
(or Zerit®), lamivudine (or 3TC or Epivir ), zalcitabine (or DDC or Hivid ),<br>
abacavir succinate (or Ziagen ), Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate salt (or Viread ),<br>
Combivir® (contains -3TC plus AZT), Trizivir (contains abacavir, lamivudine, and<br>
zidovudine); three non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: nevirapine (or<br>
Viramune"), delavirdine (or Rescriptor") and efavirenz (or Sustiva"), and eight<br>
peptidomimetic protease inhibitors or approved formulations: saquinavir, indinavir,<br>
ritonavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, Kaletra (lopinavir and Ritonavir), and<br>
Atazanavir (Reyataz ). Each of these drugs can only transiently restrain viral<br>
replication if used alone. However, when used in combination, these drugs have a<br>
profound effect on viremia and disease progression. In fact, significant reductions in<br>
death rates among AIDS patients have been recently documented as a consequence of<br>
the widespread application of combination therapy. However, despite these<br>
impressive results, 30 to 50% of patients ultimately fail combination drug therapies.<br>
Insufficient drug potency, non-compliance, restricted tissue penetration and drugspecific<br>
limitations within certain cell types (e.g. most nucleoside analogs cannot be<br>
phosphorylated in resting cells) may account for the incomplete suppression of<br>
sensitive viruses. Furthermore, the high replication rate and rapid turnover of HTV-1<br>
combined with the frequent incorporation of mutations, leads to the appearance of<br>
drug-resistant variants and treatment failures when sub-optimal drug concentrations<br>
are present (Larder and Kemp; Gulick; Kuritzkes; Morris-Jones et al\ Schinazi et alVacca and Condra; Flexner; Berkhout and Ren et al; (Ref. 6-14)). Therefore, novel<br>
anti-HTV agents exhibiting distinct resistance patterns, and favorable pharmacokinetic<br>
as well as safety profiles are needed to provide more treatment options.<br>
Currently marketed HTV-1 drugs are dominated by either nucleoside reverse<br>
transcriptase inhibitors or peptidomimetic protease inhibitors. Non-nucleoside<br>
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have recently gained an increasingly<br>
important role in the therapy of HTV infections (Pedersen &amp; Pedersen, Ref 15). At<br>
least 30 different classes of NNRTI have been described in the literature (De Clercq,<br>
Ref. 16) and several NNRTIs have been evaluated in clinical trials.<br>
Dipyridodiazepinone (nevirapine), benzoxazinone (efavirenz) and bis(heteroaryl)<br>
piperazine derivatives (delavirdine) have been approved for clinical use. However,<br>
the major drawback to the development and application of NNRTIs is the propensity<br>
for rapid emergence of drug resistant strains, both in tissue cell culture and in treated<br>
individuals, particularly those subject to monotherapy. As a consequence, there is<br>
considerable interest in the identification of NNRTIs less prone to the development of<br>
resistance (Pedersen &amp; Pedersen, Ref 15).<br>
Several indole derivatives including indole-3-sulfones, piperazino indoles,<br>
pyrazino indoles, and 5H-indolo[3,2-b][l,5]benzothiazepine derivatives have been<br>
reported as HTV-1 reverse transciptase inhibitors (Greenlee et al, Ref. 1; Williams et<br>
al, Ref. 2; Romero et al, Ref. 3; Font et al, Ref. 17; Romero et al, Ref. 18; Young et<br>
al, Ref. 19; Genin et al, Ref. 20; Silvestri et al, Ref. 21). Indole 2-carboxamides have<br>
also been described as inhibitors of cell adhesion and HTV infection (Boschelli et al,<br>
US 5,424,329, Ref. 4)_. Finally, 3-substituted indole natural products<br>
(Semicochliodinol A and B, didemethylasterriquinone and isocochliodinol) were<br>
disclosed as inhibitors of HIV-1 protease (Fredenhagen et al, Ref. 22). Other indole<br>
derivatives exhibiting antiviral activity useful for treating HIV are disclosed in PCT<br>
WO 00/76521 (Ref. 93). Also, indole derivatives are disclosed in PCT WO 00/71535<br>
(Ref. 94).<br>
Structurally related aza-indole amide derivatives have been disclosed<br>
previously (Kato et al, Ref. 23; Levacher et al, Ref. 24; Dompe Spa, WO-09504742,<br>
Ref. 5(a); SmithKline Beecham PLC, WO-09611929, Ref. 5(b); Schering Corp., US-<br>
05023265, Ref. 5(c)). However, these structures differ from those claimed herein in<br>
that they are aza-indole mono-amide rather than unsymmetrical aza-indole piperazine<br>
diamide derivatives, and mere is no mention of the use of these compounds for<br>
treating viral infections, particularly HTV. Other azaindoles have been also disclosed<br>
by Wang et al, Ref. 95. Indole and azaindole piperazine containing derivatives have<br>
been disclosed in four different PCT and issued U.S. patent applications (Reference<br>
93-95, 106). Nothing in these references can be construed to disclose or suggest the<br>
novel compounds of this invention and their use to inhibit HTV infection.<br>

"participating in a heteroaryl ring double bond", and this refers to the form of double<br>
bonds in the two tautomeric structures which comprise five-member ring heteroaryl<br>
groups. This dictates whether nitrogens can be substituted as well understood by<br>
chemists in the art. The disclosure and claims of the present invention are based on<br>
the known general principles of chemical bonding. It is understood that the claims do<br>
not encompass structures known to be unstable or not able to exist based on the<br>
literature.<br>
Physiologically acceptable salts and prodrugs of compounds disclosed herein<br>
are within the scope of this invention. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" as<br>
used herein and in the claims is intended to include nontoxic base addition salts.<br>
Suitable salts include those derived from organic and inorganic acids such as, without<br>
limitation, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, sulfinic acid, citric acid,<br>
maleic acid, fdmaric acid, sorbic acid, aconitic acid, salicylic acid, phthalic acid, and<br>
the like. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" as used herein is also intended<br>
to include salts of acidic groups, such as a carboxylate, with such counterions as<br>
ammonium, alkali metal salts, particularly sodium or potassium, alkaline earth metal<br>
salts, particularly calcium or magnesium, and salts with suitable organic bases such as<br>
lower alkylamines (methylamine, ethylamine, cyclohexylamine, and the like) or with<br>
substituted lower alkylamines (e.g. hydroxyl-substituted alkylamines such as<br>
diethanolamine, triethanolamine or tris(hydroxymethyl)- aminomethane), or with<br>
bases such as piperidine or morpholine.<br>
In the method of the present invention, the term "antiviral effective amount"<br>
means the total amount of each active component of the method that is sufficient to<br>
show a meaningful patient benefit, i.e., healing of acute conditions characterized by<br>
inhibition of the HIV infection. When applied to an individual active ingredient,<br>
administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a<br>
combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result<br>
in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or<br>
simultaneously. The terms "treat, treating, treatment" as used herein and in the claims<br>
means preventing or ameliorating diseases associated with HIV infection.<br>
The present invention is also directed to combinations of the compounds with<br>
one or more agents useful in the treatment of ADDS. For example, the compounds of<br>
this invention may be effectively administered, whether at periods of pre-exposure<br>
and/or post-exposure, in combination with effective amounts of the AIDS antivirals,<br>
immunomodulators, antiinfectives, or vaccines, such as those in the following table.<br>

Additionally, the compounds of the invention herein may be used in<br>
combination with another class of agents for treating AIDS which are called HIV<br>
entry inhibitors. Examples of such HIV entry inhibitors are discussed in DRUGS OF<br>
THE FUTURE 1999,24(12), pp. 1355-1362; CELL, Vol. 9, pp. 243-246, Oct. 29,<br>
1999; and DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY, Vol. 5, No. 5, May 2000, pp. 183-194.<br>
It will be understood that the scope of combinations of the compounds of this<br>
invention with AIDS antivirals, immunomodulators, anti-infectives, HTV entry<br>
inhibitors or vaccines is not limited to the list in the above Table, but includes in<br>
principle any combination with any pharmaceutical composition useful for the<br>
treatment of ADDS.<br>
Preferred combinations are simultaneous or alternating treatments of with a<br>
compound of the present invention and an inhibitor of HIV protease and/or a nonnucleoside<br>
inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. An optional fourth component in<br>
the combination is a nucleoside inhibitor of HTV reverse transcriptase, such as AZT,<br>
3TC, ddC or ddl. A preferred inhibitor of HIV protease is indinavir, which is the<br>
sulfatesaltofN-(2(R)-hydroxy-l-(S)-indanyl)-2(R)-phenyImethyl-4-(S)-hydroxy-5-<br>
(l-(4-(3-pyridyl-memyl)-2(S)-N'-(t-bu1ylcarboxarnido)-pipera2inyl))rpentaneamide<br>
ethanolate, and is synthesized according to U.S. 5,413,999. Indinavir is generally<br>
administered at a dosage of 800 mg three times a day. Other preferred protease<br>
inhibitors are nelfinavir and ritonavir. Another preferred inhibitor of HTV protease is<br>
saquinavir which is administered in a dosage of 600 or 1200 mg tid. Preferred nonnucleoside<br>
inhibitors of HTV reverse transcriptase include efavirenz. The preparation<br>
of ddC, ddl and AZT are also described in EPO 0,484,071. These combinations may<br>
have unexpected effects on limiting the spread and degree of infection of HTV.<br>
Preferred combinations include those with the following (1) indinavir with efavirenz,<br>
and, optionally, AZT and/or 3TC and/or ddl and/or ddC; (2) indinavir, and any of<br>
AZT and/or ddl and/or ddC and/or 3TC, in particular, indinavir and AZT and 3TC;<br>
 (3) stavudine and 3TC and/or zidovudine; (4) zidovudine and lamivudine and<br>
141W94 and 1592U89; (5) zidovudine and lamivudine.<br>
In such combinations the compound of the present invention and other active<br>
agents may be administered separately or in conjunction. In addition, the<br>
administration of one element may be prior to, concurrent to, or subsequent to the<br>
administration of other agent(s).<br>
. The preparative procedures and anti-HIV-1 activity of the novel azaindole<br>
piperazine diamide analogs of Formula I are summarized below in Schemes 1-64.<br>

The present invention comprises compounds of Formula I, their<br>
pharmaceutical formulations, and their use in patients suffering from or susceptible to<br>
HIV infection. The compounds of Formula I include pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts thereof.<br>
General procedures to construct substituted azaindole piperazine diamides of<br>
Formula I and intermediates useful for their synthesis are described in the following<br>
Schemes, 1-81.<br>
Step A in Scheme 1 depicts the synthesis of an aza indole intennediate, 2a, via<br>
the well known Bartoli reaction in which vinyl magnesium bromide reacts with an<br>
aryl or heteroaryl nitro group, such as in 1, to form a five-membered nitrogen.;<br>
containing ring as shown. Some references for the above transformation include:<br>
Bartoli et al. a) Tetrahedron Lett. 1989,30, 2129. b) J. Chem. Soc. PerJdn Trans. 1<br>
1991,2757. c) J. Chem. Soc. Perldn Trans. II1991, 657. d) SynLett (1999), 1594. In<br>
the preferred procedure, a solution of vinyl Magnesium bromide in THF (typically<br>
l.OM but from 0.25 to 3.0M) is added dropwise to a solution of the nitro pyridine in<br>
THF at -78° under an inert atmosphere of either nitrogen or Argon. After addition is<br>
completed, the reaction temperature is allowed to warm to -20° and then is stirred for<br>
approximately 12h before quenching with 20% aq ammonium chloride solution. The<br>
reaction is extracted with ethyl acetate and then worked up in a typical manner using<br>
a drying agent such as anhydrous magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate. Products are<br>
generally purified using chromatography over Silica gel. Best results are generally<br>
achieved using freshly prepared vinyl Magnesium bromide. In some cases, vinyl<br>
Magnesium chloride may be substituted for vinyl Magnesium bromide.<br>
Substituted azaindoles may be prepared by methods described in the literature<br>
or may be available from commercial sources. Thus there are many methods for<br>
carrying out step A in the literature and the specific examples are too numerous to<br>
even list. Alternative syntheses of aza indoles and general methods for carrying out<br>
step A include, but are not limited to, those described in the following references (a-k<br>

Step B. Intermediate 3a can be prepared by reaction of aza-indole,<br>
intermediate 2a, with an excess of CICOCOOMe in the presence of AlCla (aluminum<br>
chloride) (Sycheva et al, Ref. 26, Sycheva, T.V.; Rubtsov, N.M.; Sheinker, Yu.N.;<br>
Yakhontov, L.N. Some reactions of 5-cyano-6-chloro-7-azaindoles andlactamlactim<br>
tautomerism in 5-cyano-6-hydroxy-7-azaindolines. Khim. GeterotsikL<br>
Soedin., 1987,100-106). Typically an inert solvent such as CHjCb is used but others<br>
such as THF, Et2O, DCE, dioxane, benzene, or toluene may find applicability either<br>
alone or in mixtures. Other oxalate esters such as ethyl or benzyl mono esters of<br>
oxalic acid could also suffice for either method shown above. More lipophilic esters<br>
ease isolation during aqueous extractions. Phenolic or substituted phenolic (such as<br>
pentafluorophenol) esters enable direct coupling of the HW(C=O)A group, such as a<br>
piperazine, in Step D without activation. Lewis acid catalysts, such as tin<br>
tetrachloride, titanium IV chloride, and aluminum chloride are employed in Step B<br>
with aluminum chloride being most preferred. Alternatively, the azaindole is treated<br>
with a Grignard reagent such as MeMgl (methyl magnesium iodide), methyl<br>
magnesium bromide or ethyl magnesium bromide and a zinc halide, such as ZnCk<br>
(zinc chloride) or zinc bromide, followed by the addition of an oxalyl chloride mono<br>
ester, such as CICOCOOMe (methyl chlorooxoacetate) or another ester as above, to<br>
afford the aza-indole glyoxyl ester (Shadrma et al, Ref. 25). Oxalic acid esters such as<br>
methyl oxalate, ethyl oxalate or as above are used. Aprotic solvents such as dkCfe,<br>
EtjO, benzene, toluene, DCS, or the like may be used alone or in combination for this<br>
sequence. In addition to the oxalyl chloride mono esters, oxalyl chloride itself may<br>
be reacted with the azaindole and then further reacted with an appropriate amine,<br>
such as apiperazine derivative (See Scheme 52, for example).<br>
Step C. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester, (intermediate 3a, Scheme 1)<br>
affords a potassium salt of intermediate 4a, which is coupled with mono-benzoylated<br>
piperazine derivatives as shown in Step D of Scheme 1. Some typical conditions<br>
employ methanolic or ethanolic sodium hydroxide followed by careful acidification<br>
with aqueous hydrochloric acid of varying molarity but 1M HC1 is preferred. The<br>
acidification is not utilized in many cases as described above for the preferred<br>
conditions. Lithium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide could also be employed and<br>
varying amounts of water could be added to the alcohols. Propanols or butanqls<br>
could also be used as solvents. Elevated temperatures up to the boiling points of the<br>
solvents may be utilized if ambient temperatures do not suffice. Alternatively, the<br>
hydrolysis may be carried out in a non polar solvent such as CHiCla or THF in the<br>
presence of Triton B. Temperatures of -78 °C to the boiling point of the solvent may<br>
be employed but -10 °C is preferred. Other conditions for ester hydrolysis are listed<br>
in reference 41 and both this reference and many of the conditions for ester hydrolysis<br>
are well known to chemists of average skill in the art.<br>
Alternative procedures for step B and C<br>
Imidazolium Chloroaluminate:<br>
We found that ionic liquid l-alkyl-3-alkylimidazolium Chloroaluminate is<br>
generally useful in promoting the Friedel-Crafts type acylation of indoles and<br>
azaindoles. The ionic liquid is generated by mixing l-alkyl-3-alkylimidazoUum<br>
chloride with aluminium chloride at room temperature with vigorous stirring. 1:2 or<br>
1:3 molar ratio of l-alkyl-3-alkyHmidazolium chloride to aluminium chloride is<br>
preferred. One particular useful imidazolium Chloroaluminate for the acylation of<br>
azaindole with methyl or ethyl chlorooxoacetate is the l-ethyl-3-methyumidazolium<br>
Chloroaluminate. The reaction is typically performed at ambient temperature and the<br>
azaindoleglyoxyl ester can be isolated. More conveniently, we found that the glyoxyl<br>
ester can be hydrolyzed in situ at ambient temperature on prolonged reaction time<br>
(typically overnight) to give the corresponding glyoxyl acid for amide formation<br>
(Scheme 1).<br>
A representative experimental procedure is as follows: l-ethyl-3-<br>
methyUmidazolium chloride (2 equiv.; purchased from TCI; weighted under a stream<br>
of nitrogen) was stirred in an oven-dried round bottom flask at r.t. under a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere, and added aluminium chloride (6 equiv.; anhydrous powder packaged<br>
under argon in ampules purchased from Aldrich preferred; weighted under a stream<br>
of nitrogen). The mixture was vigorously stirred to form a liquid, which was then<br>
added azaindole (1 equiv.) and stirred until a homogenous mixture resulted. The<br>
reaction mixture was added dropwise ethyl or methyl chlorooxoacetate (2 equiv.) and<br>
then stirred at r.t. for 16 h. After which time, the mixture was cooled in an ice-water<br>
bath and the reaction quenched by carefully adding excess water. The precipitates<br>
were filtered, washed with water and dried under high vacuum to give the<br>
azaindoleglyoxyl acid. For some examples, 3 equivalents of l-ethyl-3-<br>
methylimidazolium chloride and chlorooxoacetate may be required.<br>

Step D. The acid intermediate, 4a, from step C of Scheme 1 is coupled<br>
with an amine A(C=O)WH preferably in the presence of DEPBT (3-<br>
(diethoxyphosphoryloxy)-l,2,3-benzotriazin-4(3.H)-one) and N,Ndiisopropylethylamine,<br>
commonly known as Hunig's base, to provide azaindole<br>
piperazine diamides. DEPBT was prepared according to the procedure of Ref. 28, Li,<br>
H.; Jiang, X.; Ye, Y.-H.; Fan, C.; Romoff, T.; Goodman, M, Organic Lett., 1999,1,<br>
91-93. Typically an inert solvent such as DMF or THF is used but other aptotic<br>
solvents could be used. The group W as referred to herein is<br>
The amide bond construction reaction could be carried out using the preferred<br>
conditions described above, the EDC conditions described below, other coupling<br>
conditions described hi this application, or alternatively by applying the conditions or<br>
coupling reagents for amide bond construction described later in this application for<br>
construction of substituents. Some specific nonlimiting examples are given hi<br>
this appli cation.<br>
The mono-substituted piperazine derivatives can be prepared according to<br>
well established procedures such as those described by Desai et al, Ref. 27(a),<br>
Adamczyk et al, Ref. 27(b), Rossen et al, Ref. 27(c), and Wang et al, 27(d).<br>
Additional procedures for synthesizing, modifying and attaching groups<br>
(C=O)m-WC(O)-A are contained in PCT WO 00/71535.<br>
Scheme 2 provides a more specific example of the transformations previously<br>
described in Scheme 1. Intermediates 6-10 are prepared by the methodologies as<br>
described for intermediates la-5a in Scheme 1. Scheme 2A is another embodiment of<br>
the transformations described in Schemes 1 and 2. Conversion of the phenol to the<br>
chloride (Step S, Scheme 2A) may be accomplished according to the procedures<br>
described in Reimann, E.; Wichmann, P.; Hoefher, G.; Sci. Pharm. 1996, 64(3), 637-<br>
646; and Katritzky, A.R.; Rachwal, S.; Smith, T.P.; Steel, PJ.; J. HeterocycL Chem.<br>
1995,32(3), 979-984. Step T of Scheme 2A can be carried out as described for Step<br>
A of Scheme 1. The bromo intermediate can then be converted into alkoxy, chloro,<br>
or fluoro intermediates as shown in Step U of Scheme 2A. Scheme 2A describes the<br>
preferred method for preparing intermediate 6c or other closely related compounds<br>
containing a 4 methoxy group in the 6-azaindole system. When step U is the<br>
conversion of the bromide into alkoxy derivatives, the conversion may he carried out<br>
by reacting the bromide with an excess of sodium methoxide in methanol with<br>
cuprous salts, such as copper I bromide, copper I iodide, and copper I cyanide. The<br>
temperature may be carried out at temperatures of between ambient and 175° but<br>
most likely will be around 115°C or 100°C. The reaction may be ran in a pressure<br>
vessel or sealed tube to prevent escape of volatiles such as methanol. The preferred<br>
conditions utilize 3eq of sodium methoxide in methanol, CuBr as the reaction catalyst<br>
(0.2 to 3 equivalents with the preferred being 1 eq or less) , and a reaction<br>
temperature of 115° C. The reaction is carried out hi a sealed tube or sealed reaction<br>
vessel. The conversion of the bromide into alkoxy derivatives may also be carried out<br>
according to procedures described in Palucki, M.; Wolfe, J.P.; Buchwald, S.L.; J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 1997, 119(14), 3395-3396; Yamato, T.; Komine, M.; Nagano, Y.; Org.<br>

1994,59(18), 5414-5418. Conversion of the bromide to the fluoro derivative (Step U,<br>
Scheme 2A) may be accomplished according to Antipin, I.S.; Vigalok, A.I.;<br>
Konovalov, A.I.; Zh. Org. Khim. 1991, 27(7), 1577-1577; and Uchibori, Y.; Umeno,<br>
M.; Seto, H.; Qian, Z,; Yoshioka, H.; Synlett. 1992, 4, 345-346. Conversion of the<br>
bromide to the chloro derivative (Step U, Scheme 2A) may be accomplished<br>
according to procedures described in Gilbert, E.J.; Van Vranken, D.L.; /. Am. Chem.<br>
Soc. 1996, 118(23), 5500-5501; Mongin, K; Mongin, O.; Trecourt, R; Godard, A.;<br>

Burrows, C.J.; /. Org. Chem. 1991, 56(3), 1344-1346. Steps V, W and X of Scheme<br>
2A are carried out according to the procedures previously described for Steps B, C,<br>
and D of Scheme 1, respectively. The steps of Scheme 2A may be carried out in a<br>
different order as shown in Scheme 2B and Scheme 2C.<br>
Scheme 3 shows the synthesis of 4-azaindole derivatives 1Mb. 5-azaindole<br>
derivatives lc-5c, and 7-azaindole derivatives ld-5d. The methods used to synthesize<br>
lb-5b, lc-5c, and ld-5d are the same methods described for the synthesis of la-5a as<br>
described in Scheme 1. It is understood, for the purposes of Scheme 3, that Ib is<br>
used to synthesize 2b-5b, Ic provides 2c-5c and Id provides 2d-5d.<br>
The compounds where there is a single carbonyl between the azaindole and<br>
group W can be prepared by the method of Kelarev, V. I.; Gasanov, S. Sh.;<br>
Karakhanov, R. A.; Polivin, Yu. N.; Kuatbekova, K. P.; Panina, M. E.; Zh. Org. Khim<br>
1992,28(12), 2561-2568. In this method azaindoles are reacted with trichloroacetyl<br>
chloride in pyridine and then subsequently with KOH in methanol to provide the 3-<br>
carbomethoxy azaindoles shown in Scheme 4 which can then be hydrolyzed to the<br>
acid and carried through the coupling sequence with HW(C=O)A to provide the<br>
compounds of Formula I wherein a single carbonyl links the azaindole moiety and<br>
group W.<br>
An alternative method for carrying out the sequence outlined in steps B-D<br>
(shown in Scheme 5) involves treating an azaindole, such as 11, obtained by<br>
procedures described in the literature or from commercial sources, with MeMgl and<br>
ZnQ2, followed by the addition of ClCOCOd (oxalyl chloride) in either THF or<br>
EtaO to afford a mixture of a glyoxyl chloride azaindole, 12a, and an acyl chloride<br>
azaindole, 12b. The resulting mixture of glyoxyl chloride azaindole and acyl chloride<br>
azaindole is then coupled with mono-benzoylated piperazine derivatives under basic<br>
conditions to afford the products of step D as a mixture of compounds, 13a and 13b,<br>
where either one or two carbonyl groups link the azaindole and group W. Separation<br>
via chromatographic methods which are well known in the art provides the pure 13a<br>
and 13b. This sequence is summarized in Scheme 5, below.<br>
Scheme 6 depicts a general method for modifying the substituent A.<br>
Coupling of H-W-C(O)OtBu using the conditions described previously for W in<br>
Scheme 1, Step D provides Boc protected intermediate, 15. Intermediate 15 is then<br>
deprotected by treatment with an acid such as TFA, hydrochloric acid or formic acid<br>
using standard solvents or additives such as CHaCla , dioxane, or anisole and<br>
temperatures between -78 °C and 100 °C. Other acids such as aq hydrochloric or<br>
perchloric may also be used for deprotection. Alternatively other nitrogen protecting<br>
groups on W such as Cbz or TROC, may be utilized and could be removed via<br>
hydrogenation or treatment with zinc respectively. A stable silyl protecting group<br>
such as phenyl dimethylsilyl could also be employed as a nitrogen protecting group<br>
on W and can be removed .with fluoride sources such as tetrabutylammonium<br>
fluoride. Finally, the free amine is coupled to acid A-C(O)OH using standard amineacid<br>
coupling conditions such as those used to attach group W or as shown below for<br>
amide formation on positions Rj-R4 to provide compound 16.<br>
Some specific examples of general methods for preparing functionalized<br>
azaindoles or for interconverting functionality on aza indoles which will be useful for<br>
preparing the compounds of this invention are shown in the following sections for<br>
illustrative purposes. It should be understood that this invention covers substituted 4,<br>
5,6, and 7 azaindoles and that the methodology shown below may be applicable to all<br>
of the above series while other shown below will be specific to one or more. A<br>
typical practioner of the art can make this distinction when not specifically<br>
delineated. Many methods are intended to be applicable to all the series, particularly<br>
functional group installations or interconversions. For example, a general strategy for<br>
providing further functionality of this invention is to position or install a halide such<br>
as bromo, chloro, or iodo, aldehyde, cyano, or a carboxy group on the azaindole and<br>
then to convert that functionality to the desired compounds. In particular, conversion<br>
to substituted heteroaryl, aryl, and amide groups on the ring are of particular interest.<br>
General routes for functionalizing azaindole rings are shown in Schemes 7, 8<br>
and 9. As depicted in Scheme 7, the azaindole, 17, can be oxidized to the<br>
corresponding JV-oxide derivative, 18, by using mCPBA (meta-Chloroperbenzoic<br>
Acid) in acetone or DMF (eq. 1, Harada et al, Ref. 29 and Antonini et al, Ref. 34).<br>
The JV-oxide, 18, can be converted to &amp; variety of substituted azaindole derivatives by<br>
using well documented reagents such as phosphorus oxychloride (POCla) (eq. 2,<br>
Schneller et al, Ref. 30), telramethylammonium fluoride (MeNF) (eq. 3), Grignard<br>
reagents RMgX (R = alkyl or aryl, X = Cl, Br or I) (eq. 4, Shiotani et al, Ref. 31),<br>
trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) (eq. 5, Muiakata et al, Ref. 32) or Ac20 (eq. 6,<br>
Klemm et al, Ref. 33). Under such conditions, a chlorine (in 19), fluorine (in 20),<br>
nitrile (in 22), alkyl (in 21), aromatic (in 21) or hydroxyl group (in 24) can be<br>
introduced to the pyridine ring. Nitration of azaindole .AT-oxides results in<br>
introduction of a nitro group to azaindole ring, as shown in Scheme 8 (eq. 7, Antonini<br>
et al, Ref. 34). The nitro group can subsequently be displaced by a variety of<br>
nucleophilic agents, such as OR, NR*R2 or SR, in a well established chemical fashion<br>
(eq. 8, Regnouf De Vains et al, Ref. 35(a), Miura et al, Ref. 35(b), Profft et al, Ref.<br>
35(c)). The resulting N-oxides, 26, are readily reduced to the corresponding<br>
azaindole, 27, using phosphorus trichloride (PCls) (eq. 9, Antonini et al, Ref .34 and<br>
Nesi et al, Ref. 36). Similarly, nitro-substituted //-oxide, 25, can be reduced to the<br>
azaindole, 28, using phosphorus trichloride (eq. 10). The nitro group of compound<br>
28 can be reduced to either a hydroxylamine (NHOH), as in 29, (eq. 11, Walser et al,<br>
Ref. 37(a) and Barker et al, Ref. 37(b)) or an amino (NH2) group, as in 30, (eq. 12,<br>
Nesi et al, Ref. 36 and Ayyangar et al, Ref. 38) by carefully selecting different<br>
reducing conditions.<br>
The alkylation of the nitrogen atom at position 1 of the azaindole derivatives<br>
can be achieved using NaH as the base, DMF as the solvent and an alkyl halide or<br>
sulfonate as alkylating agent, according to a procedure described in the literature<br>
(Mahadevan et al, Ref. 39) (Scheme 9).<br>
In the general routes for substituting the azaindole ring described above, each<br>
process can be applied repeatedly and combinations of these processes is permissible<br>
in order to provide azaindoles incorporating multiple substituents. The application of<br>
such processes provides additional compounds of Formula I.<br>
The synthesis of 4-aminoazaindoles which are useful precursors for 4, 5,<br>
and/or 7-substituted azaindoles is shown in Scheme 10 above.<br>
The synthesis of 3,5-dinitro-4-methylpyridine, 32, is described hi the following two<br>
references by Achremowicz etal.: Achremowicz, Lucjan. Pr. Nauk. Inst. Chem. Org.<br>
Fiz.Politech.Wroclaw: 1982,23, 3-128; Achremowicz, Lucjan. Synthesis 1975,10,<br>
653-4. In the first step of Scheme 10, the reaction with ditnethylformamide dimethyl<br>
acetal in an inert solvent or neat under conditions for forming Batcho-Leimgruber<br>
precursors provides the cyclization precursor, 33, as shown. Although the step is<br>
anticipated to work as shown, the pyridine may be oxidized to the N-oxide prior to<br>
the reaction using a peracid such as MCPB A or a more potent oxidant like metatrifluoromethyl<br>
or meta nitro peroxy benzoic acids. In the second step of Scheme 10,<br>
reduction of the nitro group using for example hydrogenation over Pd/C catalyst in a<br>
solvent such as MeOH, EtOH, or EtOAc provides the cyclized product, 34.<br>
Alternatively the reduction may be carried out using tin dichloride and HC1,<br>
hydrogenation over Raney nickel or other catalysts, or by using other methods for<br>
nitro reduction such as described elsewhere in this application.<br>
The amino indole, 34, can now be converted to compounds of Formula I via,<br>
for example, diazotization of the amino group, and then conversion of the diazonium<br>
salt to the fluoride, chloride or alkoxy group. See the discussion of such conversions<br>
in the descriptions for Schemes 17 and 18. The conversion of the amino moiety into<br>
desired functionality could then be followed by installation of the oxoacetopiperazine<br>
moiety by the standard methodology described above. 5 or 7-substitution of the<br>
azaindole can arise from N-oxide formation at position 6 and subsequent conversion<br>
to the chloro via conditions such as POCls in chloroform, acetic anhydride followed<br>
by POCls in DMF, or alternatively TsCl in DMF. Literature references for these and<br>
other conditions are provided in some of the later Schemes hi this application. The<br>
synthesis of 4-bromo-7-hydroxy or protected hydroxy-4-azaindole is described below<br>
as this is a useful precursor for 4 and/or 7 substituted 6-aza indoles.<br>
The synthesis of 5-bromo-2-hydroxy-4-methyl-3-nitro pyridine, 35, may be<br>
carried out as described in the following reference:Betageri, R.; Beaulieu, P.L.;<br>
Lh'nas-Brunet, M; Ferland, J.M.; Cardozo, M.; Moss, N.; Patel, U.; Proudfoot, J.R.<br>
PCTInt.Appl.WO 9931066,1999. Intermediate 36 is prepared from 35 according<br>
to the method as described for Step 1 of Scheme 10. PG is an optional hydroxy<br>
protecting group such as triallylsilyl or the like. Intermediate 37 is then prepared<br>
from 36 by the selective reduction of the nitro group in the presence of bromide and<br>
subsequent cyclization as described in the second step of Scheme 10. Fe(OH)a in<br>
DMF with catalytic tetrabutylammonium bromide can also be utilized for the<br>
reduction of the nitro group. The bromide may then be converted to fluoride via<br>
displacement with fluoride anions or to other substituents. The compounds are then<br>
converted to compounds of Formula I as above.<br>
An alternate method for preparing substituted 6-azaindoles is shown below in<br>
Schemes 12 and 13. It should be recognized that slight modifications of the route<br>
depicted below are possible. For example, acylation reactions of the 3 position of<br>
what will become the azaindole five membered ring, prior to aromatization of the<br>
azaindole, may be carried out in order to obtain higher yields. In addition to a paramethoxybenzyl<br>
group (PMB), a benzyl group can be carried through the sequence and<br>
removed during azaindole formation by using TsOH, p-Chloranil, in benzene as the<br>
oxidant if DDQ is not optimal. The benzyl intermediate, 38, has been described by<br>
Ziegler et al. in /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973, 95(22), 7458. The transformation of 38 to<br>
40 is analogous to the transformation described in Heterocycles 1984,22,2313.<br>
Scheme 13 describes various transformations of intermediate 40 which<br>
ultimately provide compounds of Formula L The conversions of the phenol moiety to<br>
other functionality at position 4 (Rj position in Scheme 13) may be carried out by the<br>
following methods: 1) conversion of a phenol to methoxy group with silver oxide and<br>
Mel or diazomethane; 2) conversion of a phenolic hydroxy group to chloro using cat<br>
ZnCl2, and N,N dimetbylaniline in CH2a2 or PC15 and POC13 together; 3) conversion<br>
of a phenolic hydroxy group to fluoro using diethylamine-SFa as in Org.Prep. Proc.<br>
Int. 1992, 24(1), 55-57. The method described in EP 427603, 1991, using the<br>
chloroformate and HF will also be useful. Other transformations are possible. For<br>
example the phenol can be converted to a triflate by standard methods and used in<br>
coupling chemistries described later in this application.<br>
Step E. Scheme 14 depicts the nitration of an azaindole, 41, (R2 = H).<br>
Numerous conditions for nitration of the azaindole may be effective and have been<br>
described in the literature. NaOs in nitromethane followed by aqueous sodium<br>
bisulfite according to the method of Bakke, J. M.; Ranes, E.; SyntJiesis 1997, 3, 281-<br>
283 could be utilized. Nitric acid in acetic may also be employed as described in<br>
Kimura, H.; Yotsuya, S.; Yuki, S.; Sugi, H.; Shigehara, I.; Haga, T.; CJiem. Pharm.<br>
Bull. 1995, 43(10), 1696-1700. Sulfuric acid followed by nitric acid may be<br>
employed as in Ruefenacht, K.; Kristinsson, H.; Mattern, G.; Helv Chim Acta 1976,<br>
59, 1593. Coombes, R. G.; Russell, L. W.; J. Chem. Soc., Perldn Trans. 1 1974, 1751<br>
describes the use of a Titatanium based reagent system for nitration. Other conditions<br>
for the nitration of the azaindole can be found in the following references: Lever,<br>

As shown above in Scheme 15, Step F, substituted azaindoles containing a<br>
chloride, bromide, iodide, triflate, or phpsphonate undergo coupling reactions with a<br>
boronate (Suzuki type reactions) or a stannane to provide substituted azaindoles.<br>
Stannaries and boronates are prepared via standard literature procedures or as<br>
described in the experimental section of this application. The substitututed indoles<br>
may undergo metal mediated coupling to provide compounds of Formula I wherein<br>
R4 is aryl, heteroaryl, or heteroalicyclic for example, The bromoazaindole<br>
intermediates, (or azaindole triflates or iodides) may undergo Stille-type coupling<br>
with heteroarylstannanes as shown in Scheme 15. Conditions for this reaction are<br>
well known in the art and the following are three example references a) Farina, V.;<br>
Roth, G.P. Recent advances in the Stille reaction; Adv. Met.-Org. Chem. 1996,5, l-<br>

by Richard C. Larock Comprehensive Organic Transformations 2nd Ed. 1999, John<br>
Wiley and Sons New York. All of these references provide numerous conditions at<br>
the disposal of those skilled in the art in addition to the specific examples provided in<br>
Scheme 15 and hi the specific embodiments. It can be well recognized that an indole<br>
stannane could also couple to a heterocyclic or aryl halide or triflate to construct<br>
compounds of Formula L Suzuki coupling (Norio Miyaura and Akiro Suzuki Chem<br>
Rev. 1995,95,2457.) between a triflate, bromo, or chloro azaindole intermediate and<br>
a suitable boronate could also be employed and some specific examples are contained<br>
in this application. Palladium catalyzed couplings of stannanes and boronates<br>
between chloro azaindole intermediates are also feasible and have been utilized<br>
extensively for this invention. Preferred procedures for coupling of a chloro<br>
azaindole and a stannane employ dioxane, stoichiometric or an excess of the tin<br>
reagent (up to 5 equivalents), 0.1 to 1 eq of Palladium (0) tetrakis triphenyl phosphine<br>
in dioxane heated for 5 to 15 h at 110 to 120°. Other solvents such as DMF, THF,<br>
toluene, or benzene could be employed. Preferred procedures for Suzuki coupling of<br>
a chloro azaindole and a boronate employ 1:1 DMF water as solvent, 2 equivalents of<br>
potassium carbonate as base stoichiometric or an excess of the boron reagent (up to 5<br>
equivalents), 0.1 to 1 eq of Palladium (0) tetraMs triphenyl phosphine heated for 5 to<br>
15 h at 110 to 120°. If standard conditions fail new specialized catalysts and<br>
conditions can be employed. Some references (and the references therein) describing<br>
catalysts which are useful for coupling with aryl and heteroaryl chlorides are:<br>

Alternatively, the boronate or stannane may be formed on the azaindole via<br>
methods known in the art and the coupling performed in the reverse manner with aryl<br>
or heteroaryl based halogens or inflates.<br>
Known boronate or stannane agents could be either purchased from<br>
commercial resources or prepared following disclosed documents. Additional<br>
examples for the preparation of tin reagents or boronate reagents are contained in the<br>
experimental section.<br>
Novel stannane agents could be prepared from one of the following routes.'<br>
Boronate reagents are prepeared as described in reference 71. Reaction of<br>
lithium or Grignard reagents with trialkyl borates generates boronates. Alternatively,<br>
Palladium catalyzed couplings of alkoxy diboron or alkyl diboron reagents with aryl<br>
or heteroaryl halides can provide boron reagents for use in Suzuki type couplings.<br>
Some example conditions for coupling a halide with (MeO)BB(OMe)2 utilize PdC12<br>
 (dppf), KOAc, DMSO, at 80°C until reaction is complete when followed by TLC or<br>
HPLC analysis.<br>
Related examples are provided in the following experimental section.<br>
Methods for direct addition of aryl or heteroaryl organometallic reagents to<br>
alpha chloro nitrogen containing heterocyles or the N-oxides of nitrogen containing<br>
heterocycles are known and applicable to the azaindoles. Some examples are<br>

Dkect displacements to install amine or N linked heteroaryl substituents can<br>
also be used to prepare compounds of Formula I. As shown in Schemes 15aa and<br>
15bb, a mixture of halo-indole or halo-azaindole intermediate, 1-2 equivalents of<br>
copper powder, with 1 equivalent preferred for the 4-F,6-azaindole series and 2<br>
equivalents for the 4-methoxy, 6-azaindole series; 1-2 equivalents of potassium<br>
carbonate, with 1 equivalent preferred for the 4-F,6-azaindole series and 2 equivalents<br>
for the 4-methoxy,6-azaindole series; and a 2-30 equivalents of the corresponding<br>
heterocyclic reagent, with 10 equivalents preferred; was heated at 135-160°C for 4 to<br>
9 hours, with 5 hours at 160°C preferred for the 4-F,6-azaindole series and 7 hours at<br>
135°C preferred for the 4-methoxy,6-azaindole series. The reaction mixture was<br>
cooled to room temperature and filtered through filter paper. The filtrate was diluted<br>
with methanol and purified either by preparative HPLC or silica gel. In many cases<br>
no chromatography is necessary, the product can be obtained by crystallization with<br>
methanol.<br>
Alternatively, the installation of amines or N linked heteroaryls may be<br>
carried out by heating 1 to 40 equivalents of the appropriate amine and an equivalent<br>
of the appropriate aza indole chloride, bromide or iodide with copper bronze (from<br>
0.1 to lOequivalents (preferably about 2 equivalents) and from 1 to 10 equivalents of<br>
finely pulverized potassium hydroxide (preferably about 2 equivalents).<br>
Temperatures of 120° to 200° may be employed with 140-160° generally preferred.<br>
For volatile starling materials a sealed reactor may be employed. The reaction is<br>
most commonly used when the halogen being displaced is at the 7-position of a 6-aza<br>
(or 4-azaindole, not shown) but the method can work in the 5-azaseries or when the<br>
halogen is at a different position (4-7 position possible). As shown above the<br>
reaction can be employed on azaindoles unsubstituted at position 3 or intermediates<br>
which contain the dicarbonyl or the intact dicarbonyl piperazine urea or thioureas<br>
contained in compounds of formula L<br>
The preparation of a key aldehyde intermediate, 43, using a procedure adapted<br>
from the method of Gilmore et Al. Synlett 1992,79-80. Is shown in Scheme 16<br>
above. The aldehyde substituent is shown only at the IU position for the sake of<br>
clarity, and should not be considered as a limitation of the methodology. The<br>
bromide or iodide intermediate is converted into an aldehyde intermediate, 43, by<br>
metal-halogen exchange and subsequent reaction with dimethylformamide in an<br>
appropriate aprotic solvent Typical bases used include, but are not limited to, alkyl<br>
lithium bases such as n-butyl h'thium, sec butyl lithium or tert butyl lithium or a metal<br>
such as lithium metal. A preferred aprotic solvent is THF. Typically the<br>
transmetallation is initiated at -78 °C. The reaction may be allowed to warm to allow<br>
the transmetalation to go to completion depending on the reactivity of the bromide<br>
intermediate. The reaction is then recooled to —78 °C and allowed to react with<br>
dimethylformamide. (allowing the reaction to warm may be required to enable<br>
complete reaction) to provide an aldehyde which is elaborated to compounds of<br>
Formula I. Other methods for introduction of an aldehyde group to form<br>
intermediates of formula 43 include transition metal catalyzed carbonylation reactions<br>
of suitable bromo, trifluoromethane sulfonyl, or staunyl azaindoles. Alternative the<br>
aldehydes can be introduced by reacting indolyl anions or indolyl Grignard reagents<br>
with formaldehyde and then oxidizing with MnOa or TPAP/NMO or other suitable<br>
oxidants to provide intermediate 43.<br>
The methodology described hi T. Fukuda eLal. Tetrahedron 1999,55,9151<br>
and M. Iwao eL Al. Heterocycles 1992,34(5), 1031 provide methods for preparing<br>
indoles with substituents at the 7-position. The Fukuda references provide methods<br>
for functionalizing the C-7 position of indoles by either protecting the indole nitrogen<br>
with 2,2-diethyl propanoyl group and then deprotonating the 7-position with sec/Buli<br>
hi TMEDA to give an anion. This anion may be quenched with DMF, formaldehyde,<br>
or carbon dioxide to give the aldehyde, benzyl alcohol, or carboxylic acid respectively<br>
and the protecting group removed with aqueous t butoxide. Similar tranformations<br>
can be achieved by converting indoles to indoline, lithiation at C-7 and then<br>
reoxidation to the indole such as described in the Iwao reference above. The<br>
oxidation level of any of these products may be adjusted by methods well known in<br>
the art as the interconversion of alcohol, aldehyde, and acid groups has been well<br>
studied. It is also well understood that a cyano group can be readily converted to an<br>
aldehyde. A reducing agent such as DEBALH in hexane such as used in Weyerstahl,<br>
P.; Schlicht, V.; Liebigs Ann/Reel. 1997, 7,175-177 or alternatively catecholalane in<br>
THF such as used in Cha, J. S.; Chang, S. W.; Kwon, 0.0.; Kim, J. M.; Synlett.<br>
1996,2,165-166 will readily achieve this conversion to provide intermediates such as<br>
44 (Scheme 16). Methods for synthesizing the nitriles are shown later in this<br>
application. It is also well understood that a protected alcohol, aldehyde, or acid<br>
group could be present in the starting azaindole and carried through the synthetic<br>
steps to a compound of Formula I in a protected form until they can be converted into<br>
the desired substituent at RI through Rj. For example, a benzyl alcohol can be<br>
protected as a benzyl ether or silyl ether or other alcohol protecting group; an<br>
aldehyde may be carried as an acetal, and an acid may be protected as an ester or<br>
ortho ester until deprotection is desired and carried out by literature methods.<br>

Step G. Step 1 of Scheme 17 shows the reduction of a nitro group on 45<br>
to the amino group of 46. Although shown on position 4 of the azaindole, the<br>
chemistry is applicable to other nitro isomers. The procedure described in Ciurla, H.;<br>
Puszko, A,; Khim Geterotsikl Soedin 1996, 10, 1366-1371 uses hydrazine Raney-<br>
Nickel for the reduction of the nitro group to the amine. Robinson, R. P.; DonahueO,<br>
K. M.; Son, P. S.; Wagy, S. D.; J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1996, 33(2), 287-293 describes<br>
the use of hydrogenation and Raney Nickel for the reduction of the nitro group to the<br>
amine. Similar conditions are described by Nicolai, E.; Claude, S.; Teulon, J. M.; J.<br>
Heterocycl Chem. 1994, 31(1), 73-75 for the same transformation. The following<br>
two references describe some trimethylsilyl sulfur or chloride based reagents which<br>

Step 2 of Scheme 17 describes general methods for conversion of ammo<br>
groups on azaindoles into other functionality. Scheme 18 also depicts<br>
transformations of an amino azaindole into various intermediates and compounds of<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
The arnino group at any position of the azaindole, such as 46 (Scheme 17),<br>
may be converted to a hydroxy group using sodium nitrite, sulfuric acid, and water<br>
via the 'method of Klemm, L. H.; Zell, R.; J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1968, 5, 773.<br>
Bradsher, C. K; Brown, R C.; Porter, H. K; J. Am, Chem. Soc. 1954, 76, 2357<br>
describes how the hydroxy group may be alkylated under standard or Mitsonobu<br>
conditions to form ethers. The amino group may be converted directly into a<br>
methoxy group by diazotization (sodium nitrite and acid )and trapping with methanol.<br>
The amino group of an azaindole, such as 46, can be converted to fluoro via<br>
the method of Sanchez using HPFg, NaNCh, and water by the method described in<br>
Sanchez, J. P.; Gogliotti, R. D.; J. Heterocycl Chem. 1993, 30(4), 855-859. Other<br>
methods useful for the conversion of the amino group to fluoro are described in<br>

2937-2940 and Sanchez, J. P.; Rogowski, J.W.; /. Heterocycl. Chem. 1987, 24,215.<br>
The amino group of the azaindole, 46, can also be converted to a chloride via<br>
diazotization and chloride displacement as described in Ciurla, H.; Puszko, A.; Khim<br>
Geterotsikl Soedin 1996,10, 1366-1371 or the methods in Raveglia, L.F.; Giardina,<br>

The amino group of the azaindole, 46, can also be converted to a bromide via<br>
diazotization and displacement by bromide as described in Raveglia, L.F.; Giardina,<br>

The preparation of 4-amino 4-azaindole and 7-methyl-4-azaindole is<br>
described by Mahadevan, L; Rasmussen, M. /. Heterocycl. Chem. 1992,29(2), 359-<br>
67. The amino group of the 4-amino 4-azaindole can be converted to halogens,<br>
hydroxy, protected hydroxy, triflate, as described above in Schemes 17-18 for the 4-<br>
amino compounds or by other methods known in the art. Protection of the indole<br>
nitrogen of the 7-methyl-4-azaindole via acetylation or other strategy followed by<br>
oxidation of the 7-methyl group with potassium permanganate or chromic acid<br>
provides the 7-acid /4-N-oxide. Reduction of the N-oxide, as described below,<br>
provides an intermediate from which to install various substiruents at position R4.<br>
Alternatively the parent 4-azaindole which was prepared as described in Mahadevan,<br>
L; Rasmussen, M. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1992,29(2), 359-67 could be derivatized at<br>
nitrogen to provide the l-(2,2-diethylbutanoyl)azaindole which could then be lithiated<br>
using TMEDA /sec BuLi as described in T. Fukuda et. Al. Tetrahedron 1999,55,<br>
9151-9162; followed by conversion of the lithio species to the 7-carboxylic acid or 7-<br>
halogen as described. Hydrolysis of the N-amide using aqueous tert-butoxide in THF<br>
regenerates the free NH indole which can now be converted to compounds of<br>
Formula L The chemistry used to functionalize position 7 can also be applied to the 5<br>
and 6 indole series.<br>
Scheme 19 shows the preparation of a 7-chloro-4-azaindole, 50, which can be<br>
converted to compounds of Formula I by the chemistry previously described,<br>
especially the palladium catalyzed tin and boron based coupling methodology<br>
described above. The chloro nitro indole, 49, is commercially available or can be<br>
prepared from 48 according to the method of Delarge, J.; Lapiere, C. L. Pharm. Acta<br>

described were prepared according to the method of Britten, A.Z.; Griffiths, G.W.G.<br>
CJiem. Ind. (London) 1973,6,278. The hydroxy azaindole, 53, can then be converted<br>

azaindoline can be used to prepare the l-benzyl-7-bromo-4-azaindoline, 54, shown<br>
below in Scheme 21. This-can be utilized in Stille or Suzuki couplings to provide 55,<br>
which is deprotected and dehydrogenated to provide 56. Other useful azaindole<br>
intermediates, such as the cyano derivatives, 57 and 58, and the aldehyde derivatives,<br>
59 and 60, can then be further elaborated to compounds of Formula L<br>

Alternatively the 7-funcu'onalized 5-azaindole derivatives may be obtained by<br>
functionalization using the methodologies of T. Fukuda etal. Tetrahedron 1999,55,<br>

the azaindole N-oxide.<br>
The conversion of indoles to indolines is well known in the art and can be<br>
carried out as shown or by the methods described in Somei, M.; Saida, Y.; Funamoto,<br>

Scheme 22<br>
The preparation of azaindole oxoacetyl or oxo piperidines with carboxylic<br>
acids can be carried out from nitrile, aldehyde, or anion precursors via hydrolysis,<br>
oxidation, or trapping with COz respectively. As shown in the Scheme 22, Step 1, or<br>
the scheme below step a!2 one method for forming the nitrile intermediate, 62, is by<br>
cyanide displacement of a halide in the aza-indole ring. The cyanide reagent used can<br>
be sodium cyanide, or more preferably copper or zinc cyanide. The reactions may be<br>
carried out hi numerous solvents which are well known in the art. For example DMF<br>
is used in the case of copper cyanide. Additional procedures useful for carrying out<br>
step 1 of Scheme 24 are Yamaguchi, S.; Yoshida, M.; Miyajima, L; Araki, T.; Hirai,<br>
Y.; /. Heterocycl Chem. 1995,32(5), 1517-1519 which describes methods for copper<br>
cyanide; Yutilov, Y.M.; Svertilova, LA.; Khim Geterotsikl Soedin 1994,8,1071-1075<br>
which utilizes potassium cyanide; and Prager, R.H.; Tsopelas, C.; Heisler, T.; Aust. J.<br>
Chem. 1991,44 (2), 277-285 which utilizes copper cyanide in the presence of<br>
MeOS(O)2F. The chloride or more preferably a bromide on the azaindole may be<br>
displaced by sodium cyanide in dioxane via the method described in Synlett. 1998,3,<br>
243-244. Alternatively, Nickel dibromide, Zinc, and triphenyl phosphine in can be<br>
used to activate aromatic and heteroaryl chlorides to displacement via potassium<br>
cyanide in THF or other suitable solvent by the methods described in Eur. Pat. Appl.,<br>
831083,1998.<br>
The conversion of the cyano intermediate, 62, to the carboxylic acid<br>
intermediate, 63, is depicted in step 2, Scheme 22 or hi step a!2, Scheme 23. Many<br>
methods for the conversion of nitriles to acids are well known in the art and may be<br>
employed. Suitable conditions for step 2 of Scheme 22 or the conversion of<br>
intermediate 65 to intermediate 66 below employ potassium hydroxide, water, and an<br>
aqueous alcohol such as ethanol. Typically the reaction must be heated at refluxing<br>
temperatures for one to 100 h. Other procedures for hydrolysis include those<br>
described in:<br>
Shiotani, S.; Taniguchi, K.; /. Heterocycl. Chem. 1997, 34(2), 493-499;<br>
Boogaard, A. T.; Pandit, U. K.; Koomen, G.-J.; Tetrahedron 1994,50(8), 2551-2560;<br>

Ryan, K; J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1992, 29(6), 1465-1467.<br>
The acid intermediate, 66 (Scheme 23), may then be esterified using<br>
conditions well known in the art. For example, reaction of the acid with<br>
diazomethane in an inert solvent such as ether, dioxane, or THF would give the<br>
methyl ester. Intermediate 67 may then be converted to intermediate 68 according to<br>
the procedure described in Scheme 2. Intermediate 68 may then be hydrolyzed to<br>
provide intermediate 69.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
As shown in Scheme 24, step a!3 another preparation of the<br>
indoleoxoacetylpiperazine 7-carboxylic acids, 69, is carried out by oxidation of the<br>
corresp'onding 7-carboxaldehyde, 70. Numerous oxidants are suitable for the<br>
conversion of aldehyde to acid and many of these are described in standard organic<br>
chemistry texts such as: Larock, Richard C., Comprehensive organic transformations<br>
: a guide to functional group preparations 2nd ed. New York: Wiley-VCH, 1999. One<br>
preferred method is the use of silver nitrate or silver oxide in a solvent such as<br>
aqueous or anhydrous methanol at a temperature of -25 °C or as high as reflux. The<br>
reaction is typically carried out for one to 48 h and is typically monitored by TLC or<br>
LC/MS until complete conversion of product to starting material has occurred.<br>
Alternatively, KmnO4 or CrO3/H2S04 could be utilized.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
Scheme 25 gives a specific example of the oxidation of an aldehyde<br>
intermediate, 70a, to provide the carboxylic acid intermediate, 69a,<br>

Alternatively, intermediate 69 can be prepared by the nitrile method of<br>
synthesis carried out in an alternative order as shown in Scheme 26. The nitrile<br>
hydrolyis step can be delayed and the nitrile carried through the synthesis to provide a<br>
nitrile which can be hydrolyzed to provide the free acid, 69, as above.<br>

Step H. The direct conversion of nitriles, such as 72, to amides, such as<br>

Steps al6, a7, and a!8 encompasses reactions and conditions for 1°, 2° and<br>
3° amide bond formation as shown in Schemes 28 and 29 which provide compounds<br>
such as those of Formula 73.<br>
The reaction conditions for the formation of amide bonds encompass any<br>
reagents that generate a reactive intermediate for activation of the carboxylic acid to<br>
amide formation, for example (but not limited to), acyl halide, from carbodiimide,<br>
acyl iminium salt, symmetrical anhydrides, mixed anhydrides (including<br>
phosphonic/phpsphinic mixed anhydrides), active esters (including silyl ester, methyl<br>
ester and thioester), acyl carbonate, acyl azide, acyl sulfonate and acyloxy Nphosphonium<br>
salt The reaction of the indole carboxylic acids with amines to form<br>
amides may be mediated by standard amide bond forming conditions described in the<br>
art. Some examples for amide bond formation are listed in references 41-53 but this<br>
list is not limiting. Some carboxylic acid to amine coupling reagents which are<br>
applicable are EDC, Diisopropylcarbodiimide or other carbodiimides, PyBop<br>
(benzotriazolyloxytris(dirnethylarnino) phosphonium hexafmorophosphate), 2-(lHbenzotriazole-<br>
l-yl)-l, 1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU). A<br>
particularly useful method for azaindole 7-carboxylic acid to amide reactions is the<br>
use of carbonyl imidazole as the coupling reagent as described in reference 53. The<br>
temperature of this reaction may be lower than in the cited reference, from 80 °C (or<br>
possibly lower) to 150 °C or higher. A more specific application is depicted in<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
The following four general methods provide a more detailed description for<br>
the preparation of indolecarboamides and these methods were employed for the<br>
synthesis of compounds of Formula I.<br>
Method!:<br>
To a mixture of an acid intermediate, such as 69, (1 equiv., 0.48 mmol), an<br>
appropriate amine (4 equiv.) and DMAP (58 mg, 0.47 mmol) dissolved CEfeCla (1<br>
ml.) was added EDC (90 mg, 0.47 mmol). The resulting mixture was shaken at rt for<br>
12h, and then evaporated in vacua. The residue was dissolved in MeOH, and<br>
subjected to preparative reverse phase HPLC purification.<br>
Method 2:<br>
To a mixture of an appropriate amine (4 equiv.) and HOBT (16 mg, 0.12<br>
mmol) in THF (0.5 mL) was added an acid intermediate, such as 69, (25 mg, 0.06<br>
mmol) and NMM (50 jol, 0.45 mmol), followed by EDC (23 mg, 0.12 mmol). The<br>
reaction mixture was shaken at rt for 12 h. The volatiles were evaporated in vacua;<br>
and the residue dissolved in MeOH and subjected to preparative reverse phase HPLC<br>
purification.<br>
Method 3:<br>
To a mixture of an acid intermediate, such as 69, (0.047 mmol), amine (4<br>
equiv.) and DEPBT (prepared according to Li, H.; Jiang, X. Ye, Y.; Fan, C.; Todd,<br>
R.; Goodman, M. Organic Letters 1999, /, 91; 21 mg, 0.071 mmol) in DMF (0.5 mL)<br>
was added TEA (0.03 mL, 0.22 mmol). The resulting mixture was shaken at rt for 12<br>
h; and then diluted with MeOH (2 mL) and purified by preparative reverse phase<br>
HPLC.<br>
Method 4:<br>
A mixture of an acid intermediate, such as 69, (0.047mmol) and 8.5 mg<br>
(0.052mmol) of 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole in anhydrous THF (2 mL) was heated to<br>
reflux under nitrogen. After 2.5h, 0.052 mmol of amine was added and heating<br>
continued. After an additional period of 3~20 h at reflux, the reaction mixture was<br>
cooled and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by chromatography on<br>
silica gel to provide a compound of Formula I.<br>
In addition, the carboxylic acid may be converted to an acid chloride using<br>
reagents such as thionyl chloride (neat or in an inert solvent) or oxalyl chloride in a<br>
solvent such as benzene, toluene, THF, or CHaCk. The amides may alternatively, be<br>
formed by reaction of Jhe acid chloride with an excess of ammonia, primary, or<br>
secondary amine in an inert solvent such as benzene, toluene, THF, or CHzCk or with<br>
stoichiometric amounts of amines in the presence of a tertiary amine such as<br>
triethylamine or a base such as pyridine or 2,6-lutidine. Alternatively, the acid<br>
chloride may be reacted with an amine under basic conditions (Usually sodium or<br>
potassium hydroxide) in solvent mixtures containing water and possibly a miscible co<br>
solvent such as dioxane or THF. Scheme 25B depicts a typical preparation of an acid<br>
chloride and derivatization to an amide of Formula I. Additionally, the carboxylic<br>
acid may be converted to an ester preferably a methyl or ethyl ester and then reacted<br>
with an amine. The ester may be formed by reaction with diazomethane or<br>
alternatively trimethylsilyl diazomethane using standard conditions which are well<br>
known in the art References and procedures for using these or otber ester forming<br>
reactions can be found in reference 52 or 54.<br>

The introduction of a bromine substituent onto the azaindole (Step G, Scheme<br>

It is well known in the art that heterocycles may be prepared from an<br>
aldehyde, carboxylic acid, cafboxylic acid ester, carboxyh'c acid amide, carboxylic<br>
acid halide, or cyano moiety or attached to another carbon substituted by a bromide or<br>
other leaving group such as a triflate, mesylate, chloride, iodide, or phosponate. The<br>
methods for preparing such intermediates from intermediates typified by the<br>
carboxylic acid intermediate, 69, bromo intermediate, 76, or aldehyde intermediate,<br>
70 described above are known by a typical chemist practitioner. The methods or<br>
types of heterocycles which may be constructed are described in the chemical<br>
literature. Some representative references for finding such heterocycles and their<br>
construction are included in reference 55 through 67 but should in no way be<br>
construed as limiting. However, examination of these references shows that many<br>
versatile methods are available for synthesizing diversely substituted heterocycles and<br>
it is apparent to one skilled in the art that these can be applied to prepare compounds<br>
of Formula I. Chemists well versed in the art can now easily, quickly, and routinely<br>
find numerous reactions for preparing heterocycles, amides, oximes or other<br>
substituents from the above mentioned starting materials by searching for reactions or<br>
preparations using a conventional electronic database such as Scifrnder (American<br>
Chemical Society), Crossfire (Beilstein), Theilheimer, or Reaccs (MDS). The<br>
reaction conditions identified by such a search can then be employed using the<br>
substrates described in this application to produce all of the compounds envisioned<br>
and covered by this invention. In the case of amides, commercially available amines<br>
can be used in the synthesis. Alternatively, the above mentioned search programs can<br>
be used to locate literature preparations of known amines or procedures to synthesize<br>
new amines. These procedures are then carried out by one with typical skill in the art<br>
to provide the compounds of Formula I for use as antiviral agents.<br>
As shown below in Scheme 32, step a!3, suitable substituted azaindoles, such<br>
as the bromoazaindole intermediate, 76, may undergo metal mediated couplings with<br>
aryl groups, heterocycles.ior vinyl stannanes to provide compounds of Formula I<br>
wherein RS is aryl, heteroaryl, or heteroalicyclic for example. The bromoazaindole<br>
intermediates, 76 (or azaindole triflates or iodides) may undergo Stille-type coupling<br>
with heteroarylstannanes as shown in Scheme 32, step a!3. Conditions for this<br>
reaction are well known in the art and references 68-70 as well as reference 52<br>
provide numerous conditions in addition to the specific examples provided in Scheme<br>
14 and in the specific embodiments. It can be well recognized that an indole stannane<br>
could also couple to a heterocyclic or aryl halide or triflate to construct compounds of<br>
Formula L Suzuki coupling, (reference 71) between the bromo intermediate, 76, and a<br>
suitable boronate could also be employed and some specific examples are contained<br>
in this application.<br>

described in the claims or be converted into an acyclic group. The aldehyde, 70, may<br>
be reacted with a Tosrnic based reagent to generate oxazoles (references 42 and 43 for<br>
example). The aldehyde, 70, may be reacted with a Tosrnic reagent and than an<br>
amine to give imidazoles as in reference 72 or the aldehyde intermediate, 70, may be<br>
reacted with hydroxylamtne to give an oxime which is a compound of Formula I as<br>
described below. Oxidation of the oxime with NBS, t-butyl hypochlorite, or the other<br>
known reagents would provide the N-oxide which react with alkynes or 3 alkoxy<br>
vinyl esters to give isoxazoles of varying substitution. Reaction of the aldehyde<br>
intermediate 70, with the known reagent, 77 (reference 70) shown below under basic<br>
conditions would provide 4-aminotrityl oxazoles.<br>
N=C=N-CPh3<br>
Removal of the trityl group would provide 4-amino oxazoles which could be<br>
substitutued by acylation, reductive alkylation or alkylation reactions or heterocycle<br>
forming reactions. The trityl could be replaced with an alternate protecting group<br>
such as a monomethoxy trityl, CBZ, benzyl, or appropriate silyl group if desired.<br>
Reference 73 demonstrates the preparation of oxazoles containing a triflouoromethyl<br>
moiety and the conditions described therein demonstrates the synthesis of oxazoles<br>
with fluorinated methyl groups appended to them.<br>
The aldehyde could also be reacted with a metal or Grignard (alkyl, aryl, or<br>
heteroaryl) to generate secondary alcohols. These would be efficacious or could be<br>
oxidized to the ketone with TPAP or MnC&gt;2 or PCC for example to provide ketones of<br>
Formula I which could be utilized for treatment or reacted with metal reagents to give<br>
tertiary alcohols or alternatively converted to oximes by reaction with hydroxylamine<br>
hydrochlorides in ethanolic solvents. Alternatively the aldehyde could be converted<br>
to benzyl amines via reductive animation. An example of oxazole formation via a<br>
Tosmic reagent is shown below in Scheme 35. The same reaction would work with<br>
aldehydes at other positions and also in the 5 and 6 aza indole series.<br>
Scheme 36 shows in step a!5, a cyano intermediate, such as 62, which could<br>
be directly converted to compounds of Formula I via heterocycle formation or<br>
reaction with organometallic reagents.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
Scheme 37 shows a method for acylation of a cyanoindole intermediate of<br>
formula 65 with oxalyl chloride which would give acid chloride, 79, which could<br>
then be coupled with the appropriate amine in the presence of base to provide 80.<br>
The nitrile intermediate, 80, could be converted to the tetrazole of formula 81,<br>
which could then be alkylated with trimethylsilyldiazomethane to give the compound<br>
of formula 82 (Scheme 38).<br>
Tetrazole alkylation with alkyl halides would be carried out prior to azaindole<br>
acylation as shown in Scheme 39. Intermediate 65 could be converted to tetrazole,<br>
83, which could be alkylated to provide 84. Intermediate 84 could then be acylated<br>
and hydrolyzed to provide 85 which could be subjected to amide formation<br>
conditions to provide 86. The group appended to the tetrazole may be quite diverse<br>
and still exhibit impressive potency.<br>
Scheme 40 shows that an oxadiazole such as, 88, may be prepared by the<br>
addition of hydroxylamine to the nitrile, 80, followed by ring closure of intennediate<br>
87 with phosgene. Alkylation of oxadiazole, 88, with trimethylsilyldiazomethane<br>
would give the compound of formula 89.<br>
A 7-cyanoindole, such as 80, could be efficiently converted to the imidate<br>
ester under conventional Pinner conditions using 1,4-dioxane as the solvent. The<br>
imidate ester can be reacted with nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur nucleopMles to provide<br>
C7-substituted indoles, for example: imidazolines, benzimidazoles,<br>
azabenzimidazoles, oxazolines, oxadiazoles, thiazolines, triazoles, pyrimidines and<br>
amidines etc. For example the imidate may be reacted with acetyl hydrazide with<br>
heating in a nonparticipating solvent such as dioxane, THF, or benzene for example,<br>
(aqueous base or aqueous base in an alcoholic solvent may need to be added to effect<br>
final dehydrative cyclization in some cases) to form a methyl triazine. Other<br>
hydrazines can be used, Triazines can also be installed via coupling of stannyl<br>
triazines with 4,5,6,or 7-bromo or chloro azaindoles. The examples give an example<br>
of the formation of many of these heterocycles.<br>

An acid intermediate, such as 69, may be used as a versatile precursor to<br>
generate numerous substituted compounds. The acid could be converted to<br>
hydrazonyl bromide and then a pyrazole via reference 74. One method for general<br>
heterocycle synthesis would be to convert the acid to an alpha bromo ketone (ref 75)<br>
by conversion to the acid chloride using standard methods, reaction with<br>
diazomethane, and finally reaction with HBr. The alpha bromo ketone could be used<br>
to prepare many different compounds of Formula I as it can be converted to many<br>
heterocycles or other compounds of Formuk L Alpha amino ketones can be prepared<br>
by displacement of the bromide with amines. Alternatively, the alpha bromo ketone<br>
could be used to prepare heterocycles not available directly from the aldeheyde or<br>
acid. For example, using the conditions of Hulton in reference 76 to react with the<br>
alpha bromo ketone would provide oxazoles. Reaction of the alpha bromoketone<br>
with urea via the methods of reference 77 would provide 2-amino oxazoles. The<br>
alpha bromoketone could also be used to generate furans using beta keto esters(ref<br>
78-80) or other methods, pyrroles (from beta dicarbonyls as in ref 81 or by Hantsch<br>
methods (ref 82) thiazoles , isoxazoles and imidazoles (ref 83) example using<br>
literature procedures. Coupling of the aforementioned acid chloride with N-methyl-<br>
O-metfayl hydroxyl amine would provide a "Weinreb Amide" which could be used to<br>
react with alkyl lithiums or Grignard reagents to generate ketones. Reaction of the<br>
Weinreb anion with a dianion of a hydroxyl amine would generate isoxazoles (ref<br>
84). Reaction with an acetylenic lithium or other carbanion would generate alkynyl<br>
indole ketones. Reaction of this alkynyl intermediate with diazomethane or other<br>
diazo compounds would give pyrazoles (ref 85). Reaction with azide or hydroxyl<br>
amine would give heterocycles after elimination of water. Nitrile oxides would react<br>
with the alkynyl ketone to give isoxazoles (ref 86). Reaction of the initial acid to<br>
provide an acid chloride using for example oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride or<br>
triphenyl phosphine/ carbon tetrachloride provides a useful intermediate as noted<br>
above. Reaction of the acid chloride with an alpha ester substituted isocyanide and<br>
base would give 2-substituted oxazoles (ref 87): These could be converted to amines,<br>
alcohols, or halides using standard reductions or Hoffman/Curtius type<br>
rearrangements.<br>

Scheme 51 describes methods for the preparation of azaindole acetic acid<br>
derivatives by the same methods employed for the preparation of azaindole oxalic<br>
acid derivatives as shown and described in Scheme 50 above. The starling material<br>
employed in Scheme 51 could be prepared according to J. Org. Chem. 1999, 64,<br>
7788-7801. Steps A",B", C",D",andE" of Scheme 51 could be carried out in the<br>
same fashion as previously described for Steps Steps A', B', C', D', and E' of<br>
Scheme 50.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
The remaining schemes provide additional background, examples, and<br>
conditions for carrying out this invention. Specific methods for preparing W and<br>
modifying A are presented. As shown in Scheme 52, the azaindoles may be treated<br>
with oxalyl chloride in either THF or ether to afford the desired glyoxyl chlorides<br>
according to literature procedures (Lingens, R; Lange, J. Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem.<br>
1970, 735,46-53). The intermediate glyoxyl chlorides may be coupled with benzoyl<br>
piperazines (Desai, M.; Watthey, J.W. Org. Prep. Proc. Int. 1976, 8, 85-86) under<br>
basic conditions to afford compounds of Formula I directly.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
Alternatively, Scheme 52 treatment of the azaindole-3-glyoxyl chloride,<br>
(Scheme 52) with terf-butyl 1-piperazinecarboxylate affords the piperazine coupled<br>
product It is apparent to one skilled in the art that use of an alternative Boc protected<br>
piperazine which are synthesized as shown below would provide compounds of<br>
formula I with alternative groups of formula W. As discussed earlier, other amine<br>
protecting groups which do not require acidic deprotection conditions could be<br>
utilized if desired. Deprotection of the Boc group is effected with 20% TFA/CH2C12<br>
to yield the free piperazine. This product is then coupled with carboxylic acid in the<br>
presence of polymer supported l-(3-Dimemylarnuiopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiiinide (PEDC)<br>
to afford products of Formula L This sequence provides a general method for<br>
synthesizing compounds of varied A in formula I.<br>
An example for preparing compounds of Formula I which possess substituents<br>
in A (or other parts of the molecule) which might interfere with the standard reaction<br>
schemes reactions is shown in Scheme 53. The piperazine derivative (Scheme 53)<br>
was treated with Boc-protected aminobenzoic acid in the presence of EDC to afford<br>
the piperazine diamide. A portion of the resulting product was separated and<br>
subjected to TFA in order to remove the Boc group, thus yielding amino derivatives.<br>
Similarly, substituents which possess a reactive alcohol can be incorporated as<br>
below. The piperazine derivative (Scheme 54) was treated with acetoxybenzoic acid<br>
in the presence of EDC to afford the piperazine diamide derivative. A portion of the<br>
resulting product was separated and subjected to LiOH hydrolysis in order to remove<br>
the acetate group, thus yielding hydroxy derivatives.<br>
Examples containing substituted piperazines are prepared using the general<br>
procedures outlined in Schemes 55-38. Substituted piperazines are either<br>
commercially available from Aldrich, Co. or prepared according to literature<br>
procedures (Behun et al, Ref. 88(a), Scheme 31, eq. 01). Hydrogenation of alkyl<br>
substituted pyrazines under 40 to 50 psi pressure in EtOH afforded substituted<br>
piperazines. When the substituent was an ester or amide, the pyrazine systems could<br>
be partially reduced to the tetrahydropyrazine (Rossen et al, Ref. 88(b), Scheme 55,<br>
eq. 02). The carbonyl substituted piperazines could be obtained under the same<br>
conditions described above by using commercially available dibenzyl piperazines<br>
(Scheme 55, eq. 03).<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
2-Trifluoromethylpiperazine (Jenneskens et al., Ref. 88c) was prepared<br>
through a four step route (Scheme 56). Using Lewis acid TiCU, N,N'-<br>
dibenzylethylenediamine reacted with trifluoropyruvates to afford the hemiacetal,<br>
which was reduced at room temperature by EtaSiH in TFA to afford the lactam.<br>
LiAlHt treatment then reduced the lactam to l,4-dibenzyl-2-<br>
trifluoromethylpiperazine. Finally, hydrogenation of the dibenzyl-2-<br>
trifluoromethylpiperazine in HOAc gave the desired product, 2-<br>
trifluoromethylpiperazine.<br>
Mono-benzoylation of symmetric substituted piperazines could be achieved<br>
by using one of the following procedures (Scheme 57). (a) Treatment of a solution of<br>
piperazine in acetic acid with acetyl chloride afforded the desired mon-benzoylated<br>
piperazine (Desai et al. Ref. 27, Scheme 57, eq. 04). (b) Symmetric piperazines were<br>
treated with 2 equivalents of ra-butyllithium, followed by the addition of benzoyl <br>
chloride at room temperature (Wang et al, Ref. 89, Scheme 57, eq. 05).<br>
Mono-benzoylation of unsymmetric substituted piperazines could be<br>
achieved by using one of the following procedures (Scheme 57), in which all the<br>
methods were exemplified by mono-alky! substituted piperazines. (a) Unsymmetric<br>
piperazines were treated with 2 equivalents of n-butyllithium, followed by the<br>
addition of benzoyl chloride at room temperature to afford a mixture of two<br>
regioisomers, which could be separated by chromatography (Wang et al, Ref. 89 and<br>
90(b), Scheme 58 eq. 06); (b) Benzoic acid was converted to its pentafluorophenyl<br>
ester, and then further reaction with 2-aliylpiperazine to provide the monobenzoylpiperazines<br>
with the benzoyl group at the less hindered nitrogen (Adamczyk<br>
et al, Ref. 90(a), Scheme 58, eq. 07); (c) A mixture of piperazine and methyl benzoate<br>
was treated with dialiylaluminum chloride in methylene chloride for 2-4 days to yield<br>
the mono-benzoylpiperazine with the benzoyl group at the less hindered nitrogen<br>
(Scheme 58 eq. 08); (d) Unsymmetric piperazines were treated with 2 equivalents of<br>
n-butyllithium, followed by subsequent addition of triethylsilyl chloride and benzoyl<br>
chloride in THF at room temperature to afford mono-benzoylpiperazines with the<br>
benzoyl group at the more hindered nitrogen (Wang et al, Ref. 90(b), Scheme 58, eq.<br>
09). When the substituent at position 2 was a ester or amide, the mono-benzoylation<br>
with benzoyl chloride occurred at the less hindered nitrogen of the piperazine with<br>
triethylamine as base in THF (Scheme 58, eq. 10).<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
In the case of tetrahydropyrazines (Scheme 59, eq. 11), mono-benzoylation<br>
occurred at the more hindered nitrogen under the same conditions as those in<br>
equation 10 of Scheme 58, in the well precedented manner. (Rossen et al, Ref. 88(b)).<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
Furthermore, the ester group can be selectively reduced by NaBHLt in the<br>
presence of the benzamide (Masuzawa et al, Ref. 91), which is shown in Scheme 60.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
The ester groups on either the piperazine linkers or on the azaindole nucleus<br>
could be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid under basic conditions such as<br>
(Scheme 61, eq. 13) or NaOMe (Scheme 61, eq. 14) as bases in MeOH and water.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
Reaction of an azaindole glyoxyl chloride with substituted benzoyl<br>
piperazines or tetrahydropyrazines in CHjCla using I-Pr2Net as base afforded the<br>
coupled products as shown in Scheme 62.<br>
In the case of coupling reactions using 3-hydroxylmethyl-benzoylpiperazine,<br>
the hydroxyl group was temporarily protected as its TMS ether with BSTFA (N,Obistrimethylsilyl)<br>
trifluoroacetamide) (Furber et al, Ref. 92). The unprotected nitrogen<br>
atom can then be reacted with glyoxyl chlorides to form the desired diamides. During<br>
workup, the TMS masking group was removed to give free hydroxylmethylpiperazine<br>
diamides as shown in Scheme 63.<br>
Piperazine intermediates were prepared using standard chemistry as shown in<br>
Scheme 64.<br>
Scheme 65 depicts some more specific methodology for preparing 5-azindoles<br>
for use in prpeartion of the claimed compounds. Some reductive cyclizations<br>
conditions include Fe in acetic acid, Tin n chloride in aq HC1, or Zinc powder in<br>
acetic acid. Hydrogenation condititons or other conditions used in LeimGruber-Batch<br>
indole synthesis sequences can alo be employed.<br>

Scheme 67-74 provides some nonlimiting methodology for the preparation of<br>
substituted pyrazines which can be incorporated into substitaents of compounds of<br>
claim 1, particularly as part of R4. It should be noted that the nomenclature in these<br>
schemes does not coincide with that of the claims but rather shows examples of<br>
methods which can be used to prepare pieces which make up the compounds of the<br>
claims. Thus Rj and Rz in these schemes does not refer to the Rl and R2 in the<br>
claims but for example refers to chemically compatible groups which might be<br>
envisioned by chemists skilled in the art and which can be utilized to prepare<br>
compounds of the claims.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
Throughout the chemistry discussion, chemical transformations which are well<br>
known in the art have been discussed. The average practioner in the art knows these<br>
transformations well and a comprehensive list of useful conditions for nearly all the<br>
transformations is available to organic chemists and this list is contained in reference<br>
52 authored by Larock and is incorporated in its entirety for the synthesis of<br>
compounds of Formula L<br>
Schemes 75-78 provide more specific examples of the general synthesis<br>
described in Scheme 1. The examples describe the synthesis of compounds of the<br>
invention in which the piperazine of group W contains a substituent on the ring at a<br>
position next to the nitrogen which comprises part of the amide attached to group A.<br>
While other substitution patterns are important aspects of the invention, we have<br>
found that compounds with a single group adjacent to the amide attached to group A<br>
may have metabolic stability advantages in humans and yet retain exceptional<br>
antiviral properties. The specific substituted piperazines described in Schemes 75-78<br>
may be prepared as described in reference 90(b) or as described for intermediates 17ad<br>
in the experimental section. In schemes 75 and 76 the most preferred groups for Rg<br>
and RH are C1-C6 alkyl groups. As shown in schemes 77 and 78 the most preferred<br>
groups are methyl. As shown in schemes 75-78, the compounds may be single .<br>
isomers or enantiomers or may be used as a racemic mixture or mixture of isomers.<br>
Preferred groups A as shown in the schems 75-78 are the same as those described for<br>
the invention. Most preferred groups A are 2-pyridyl or phenyl. hi Schemes 75 and<br>
77, the most preferred groups for Ra are methoxy, halogen, or hydrogen. In schemes<br>
75-76 the most preferred group for Rl and R3 is hydrogen, hi scheme 76 the most<br>
preferred group for R2 is hydrogen. In schemes 75-78, the most preferred groups for<br>
R4 are phenyl, substituted phenyl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, -C(O)NH2, -<br>
C(O)NHMe, or C(O)heteroaryl. Most preferred substituents on the substituted aryl or<br>
heteroaryl are methyl, amino, halogen, C(O)NHMe, COOH, COOMe, COOEt, or<br>
benzyl but this list should not be construed to be rate limiting as the R4 position is<br>
extremely tolerant of broad substitution. Particular groups at R4 of definite<br>
impotance are triazole, oxadiazole, oxazole, pyrazole, pyrazine, pyrirnidine, tetrazole,<br>
and phenyl but should not be construed as limiting159<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
Schemes 79 provides examples and typical conditions for forming<br>
intermediates 2 which contain an oxadiazole or substituted oxadiazole. These<br>
intermediates can be converted to compounds of Claim 1 via the standard<br>
methodology described in Scheme 1 and the rest of the application. An alternate<br>
sequence is shown in Scheme 79a which utilizes cyano substituted intermediates 5 to<br>
generate the oxadiazoles of claim 1. Specific examples are given in the experimental<br>
section. Other oxadiazole isomers may be prepared via standard literature<br>
methodology.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br>
Scheme 80 is a preferred method for making compounds of Formula I and la<br>
where R2 is fluoro. This is exemplified specifically in the preparation of compound<br>
Example 216. The synthesis of 2-hydroxy-3-nitro-5-fluoropyridine 5-80 as shown<br>
was carried out generally via the methods of A. Marfat and R.P. Robinson U.S.<br>
Patent 5,811,432 (column 25, example 5) and Nesnow and Heidleberger (/.<br>
Heterocyclic Chem. 1973, 10, pg 779) except that a number of procedural<br>
enhancements were incorporated as noted in the description of each step. 2-Hydroxy<br>
5-fluoropyridine 4-80 is also commercially available. The formation of diazonium<br>
tetrafluoroborate salt 2-80 from 5-amino-2-methoxy pyridine 1-80 proceeded in<br>
essentially quantitative yield and was isolated via filtration. The Schiemann reaction<br>
provided poor yields of the desired 2-methoxy-fluoropyridine using the literature<br>
conditions due mainly to significant contamination with 3-fiuoro l-(N)-methyl<br>
pyridone and other byproducts. However, adoption of a procedure similar to that<br>
described in Sanchez, J. P.; RogowsM, J. W.; J Heterocycl Chem 1987,24, 215 for a<br>
related compound provided very high yields of essentially clean but volatile 2-<br>
methoxy-5-fluoro pyridine 3-80 as a solution in toluene. In the interest of<br>
expediency, demethylation was achieved on large scale using aqueous HQ in<br>
pressure bottles at 140°C for Ihr. Prior to heating, the toluene solution was stirred<br>
with the aq HC1 and then the toluene was removed by decantation. The literature<br>
method for carrying out this step using HBr at 100°C was also successful on small<br>
scale and had the advantage of avoiding the use of pressure bottles. Nitration of 4-80<br>
as described by Marfat provided lower than expected yields so the procedure was<br>
modified slightly, using guidance from A.G. Burton, P.J.Hallis, and A.R. Katritzky<br>
(Tetrahedron Letters 1971, 24, 2211-2212) on the control of the regiochemistry of<br>
nitration of pyridones via modulation of the acidity of the medium. The chemical<br>
yields of 2-hydroxy-3-nitro-5-fluoro pyridine 5-80 were significantly improved using<br>
the procedure described hi the experimental section. Occasionally the product failed<br>
to precipitate during workup and then considerable efforts were necessary to isolate<br>
this highly water soluble compound from the aqueous layer. Using neat excess<br>
POBrs, compound 5-80 was converted to 2-bromo-3-nitro-5-fluoro pyridine 6 which<br>
could be used without further purification in the subsequent azaindole forming<br>
reaction. Addition of the pyridine 6 to excess vinyl magnesium bromide in THF at<br>
low temperature afforded the desired 4-fluoro-7-bromo-6-azaindol (precursor 5j) in<br>
yields of up to 35% following acidic work up and isolation via crystallization. A<br>
disadvantage of this method is the workup is difficult due to the large amounts of<br>
salts formed as co-products in the reaction and the low conversion to albeit clean<br>
product. The reaction is also exothermic and thus would require care on larger scales.<br>
Despite the moderate yields, as mentioned above the reaction proceeds cleanly and<br>
provides pure product precursor 5j without chromatography so it is anticipated that<br>
more detailed studies of this chemistry could result in yield enhancements. A<br>
selective copper/potassium carbonate mediated displacement of the 7-bromo group by<br>
commercially available 1,2,3-triazole provided an approximately 1:1 mixture of<br>
triazoles from which the desired 7-80 was isolated via chromatography in 25-35%<br>
yields. Copper-bronze rather than copper powder can also be used to carry out similar<br>
transfonnations. This reaction must not be allowed to overheat since concomitant<br>
displacement of the fluorine is possible and has been observed. Acylation occurred<br>
most efficiently under conditions that utilized excess acidic imidazolium chloro<br>
aluminate ionic liquid to provide highly activated glyoxylating reagent (K.S. Yeung et<br>
al. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002,43,5793). The acylation of 7-80 usually does not proceed<br>
to completion and typically results in about 75% conversion as measured by LC/MS.<br>
An advantage to these conditions is that the typical next step, ester hydrolysis,<br>
proceeded in situ to provide the desired acid 8-80 which was isolated directly by<br>
precipitation during workup. Coupling of the piperazine benzamide was found to be<br>
cleaner and produced higher yields of the compound of Example 216 using the<br>
depicted HATU based coupling than with other standard coupling reagents such as<br>
EDCorDEPBT.<br>

General procedures for the preparation of pyrazoles<br>
3-Substituted pyrazoles can be prepared via the following routes:<br>
Route P-A<br>
N2 Hexane<br>
IMS 115°C<br>
10 hours<br>
Aliyne (1 eq.) was dissolved in a 2M solution of diazomethane (5-10 eq.) in<br>
hexane and resulting mixture was heated to 110-115°C for 12 hours. After reaction<br>
was quenched with MeOH, removal of solvents provided a residue which was used in<br>
the next step without any purification.<br>
Methyl ketone (1 eq.) was added into a solution of dimethoxy-DMF (5-10 eq.)<br>
7 and the resulting mixture was heated to 110-11<br>
were then removed under vaccum to provide a residue.<br>
in DMF 115°C for 12 hours. Solvents<br>
The above residue was mixed with hydrazine (5-10 eq.) in ethanol and the<br>
reaction was kept in refluxing for 12 hours. Removal of solvents in vacco gave a<br>
residue, which was carried onto further reactions without purification.<br>
Hydrazine (10-20 eq.) was added into a solution of alkenone or alkenal (1 eq.)<br>
in THF and the resulting mixture was heated to 110-115°C for 12 hours. After the<br>
mixture cooled down to room temperature, an excess of NiO2-2H2O ( 5-10 eq.) was<br>
then added into the reaction mixture and the reaction was stirred at room temperature<br>
for another 12 hours. Insoluble materials were then filtered away and concentration<br>
under vaccum provided a residue that was used in the further reactions without<br>
purification.<br>
(Table Removed) Silicon masked general procedure for attaching pyrazoles, imidazoles and<br>
triazoles with melting-points higher than 160°C to C-7 position of azaindoles:<br>
In cases where the meltingpoints of the nitrogen heterocycle to be attached to<br>
(he azaindole have melting points higher than 160°C, an excess of the heterocycle<br>
(usually greater than 3 equivalents) is heated with a larger excess of<br>
hexamethydisilazane or chloro trimethylsilane (10 equivalents) at temperatures up<br>
to 140°C for approximately 12h. The excess silylating reagent is removed in vacuo<br>
and the mixture is combined with the azaindole halide and the copper catalyzed<br>
reaction is conducted as below.<br>
A mixture of halo-indole or halo-azaindole intermediate, 1-2 equivalents of<br>
copper powder, with 1 equivalent preferred for the 4-F,6-azaindole series and 2<br>
equivalents for the 4-methoxy,6-azaindole series; 1-2 equivalents of potassium<br>
carbonate, and the the corresponding silylated heterocyclic reagent as prepared'above,<br>
was heated at 135-160°C for 4 to 9 hours, with 5 hours at 160°C preferred for the 4-<br>
F,6-azaindole series and 7 hours at 135°C preferred for the 4-methoxy,6-azaindole<br>
series. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered through<br>
filter paper. The filtrate was diluted with methanol and purified either by preparative<br>
HPLC or silica gel. In many cases no chromatography is necessary, the product can<br>
be obtained by crystallization with methanol.<br>

Synthetic Experimental Procedures for best preparation of Example 216 (Scheme<br>
5-AmiQO 2 methoxypyridine (50g, 0.4mol ) was added to a stirring mixture of<br>
absolute ethanol (280 ml) and HBF4 (48% in water, 172 ml) and cooled to 0°C.<br>
Sodium nitrite (129g) was dissolved in water (52 ml) and added portion-wise over<br>
In). The stirring was continued at 0°C for 2hr. The reaction mixture was diluted<br>
with ether (1L). The solid product was collected by filtration and washed with 500<br>
ml of 50:50 EtOH/ether and subsequently several times with ether until the product<br>
was slightly pinkish in color. The pale pink solid 90g (-100% yield) was kept in a<br>
dessicator overPaOs.<br>
The same procedure was followed to perform the reaction on larger scale:<br>
(1) (200g, 1.6 mol); HBF4 (688 ml); NaNO2 (116 g); EtOH(L12 L); H2O (208 ml)<br>
The reaction was run 4 times (total 800 grams (1-80)). The product was dried over<br>
P205 for 48 hr. (only 24hr for first batch).<br>
A total of 1,293 g of (2-80) was obtained, (91% yield).<br>

The decomposition of the diazonium salt was run in 3 batches of:<br>
206g, 219g and 231g using 1.3L, 1.4L and 1.6L of anhydrous toluene respectively.<br>
The toluene was preheated under nitrogen to 100°C (internal temperature) in a 2L 3-<br>
neck round bottom flask provided with a mechanical stirrer. The solid was added<br>
solid portion-wise via a scoop through a powder funnel which was attached to an<br>
adapter with slight outward positive nitrogen flow. During addition, the temperature<br>
was maintained between 99-102°C (set at 100°C) and stirred vigorously. Total<br>
addition time was 60 min. for the smaller two batches and 70 min. for the last one.<br>
After the addition was finished, each stirring reaction was heated at 110°C for Ihr.<br>
The heating mantle was removed and stirring was stopped. The reactions were<br>
allowed to stand for 2hr (ambient temp achieved). Safety Note: The reaction<br>
contains BF3 so working with the reaction hot exposes vapors which caused skin<br>
irritation with some people. No incidents were noted at ambient temperature (6<br>
different people). The hot toluene from the reaction was poured into a 4L<br>
Erlenmeyer (a dark brown oil and residue remained in the flask). The residue was<br>
washed with 50 ml of toluene and poured into the original toluene extracts.<br>

kept between 65°C and 80°C (rxn is exothermic and although the bath is at 65°C,<br>
temperature goes higher, usually 75, sometimes 80°C). After the addition was<br>
complete, the reaction mixture was heated at 65°C for an additional hr. The reaction<br>
mixture was then cooled to rt and poured in a flask containing ice ) (20g of ice/gr<br>

by filtration (1HNM" showed 4-80 and something else (discarded)).<br>
The aqueous layer was extracted with AcOEt several times (3-5) and concentrated on<br>
a rotary evaporator under vacuum to afford a solid that was triturated with ether to<br>
afford 5-80 as a bright yellow solid. A total of 1 17g of desired product was collected<br>
in the first crop (27% yield from diazonium salt). A portion did not crystallize: this<br>
oil was triturated with MeOH and Et2O to afford 3.6g of 5-80; another precipitation<br>

azaindole precursor 2e (9.1 g, 50 mrnol; dried in vacua'), potassium carbonate (13.8<br>
g, 100 mmol, 2 eq.), copper powder (6.35 g, 100 mmol, 2 eq.), and 3-methyl-1,2,4-<br>
triazole (83 g, 1.0 mol, 20 eq.). The solid mixture was heated to melt at 170-175°C<br>
(external oil bath temperature) under gentle stream of anhydrous nitrogen for 12 h, by<br>
which time HPLC analysis indicates the amount of the peak for the starting material<br>
becomes 5-30% and the desired product peak becomes about 45% with isomeric byproduct<br>
peak becomes 15%. As the reaction mixture cools, MeOH (150 mL) was<br>
added slowly to the stirred warm mixture. Upon cooling, the insoluble material<br>
(copper powder) was filtered through a Celite pad, and rinsed with methanol. The<br>
filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to a thick paste which was diluted with water (1 L)<br>
and extracted with EtOAc (3xl50mL). The EtOAc extracts were dried (MgSO4),<br>
filtered and concentrated to obtain about 8 g of crude residue which was crystallized<br>
by dissolving in hot CH3CN (50 mL), followed by diluting with water (100 mL) and<br>
cooling at 0°C to collect 1.45 g (12.7%) of the title compound as white solid. The<br>
filtrate was purified by C-18 reverse phase silica gel (YMC ODS-A 75 pin) eluted<br>
with 15-30% CHsCN/H^O. Appropriate fractions were combined and the aqueous<br>

• Virus infection- Human epithelial cell line, HeLa, expressing the HTV-1 receptors<br>
CD4 and CCR5 was propagated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Life<br>
Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) containing 10% fetal Bovine serum (FBS,<br>
Sigma, St. Louis , MO) and supplemented with 0.2 mg/mL Geneticin (Life<br>
Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) and 0.4 mg/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,<br>
CA).<br>
Virus-Single-round infectious reporter virus was produced by co-transfecting human<br>
embryonic Kidney 293 cells with an HIV-1 envelope DNA expression vector and a<br>
proviral cDNA containing an envelope deletion mutation and the luciferase reporter<br>
gene inserted in place of HIV-1 nef sequences (Chen et al, Ref. 41). Transfections<br>
were performed using lipofectAMINE PLUS reagent as described by the<br>
manufacturer (life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD).<br>
Experiment<br>
1. Compound was added to HeLa CD4 CCR5 cells plated in 96 well plates at a cell<br>
density of 5 X 104 cells per well in 100 Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium<br>
containing 10 % fetal Bovine serum at a concentration of 20<br>
2. 100 ul of single-round infectious reporter virus in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle<br>
Medium was then added to the plated cells and compound at an approximate<br>
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 , resulting in a final volume of 200 fJl per<br>
well and a final compound concentration of 10<br>
3. Samples were harvested 72 h after infection.<br>
4. Viral infection was monitored by measuring luciferase expression from viral<br>
DNA in the infected cells using a luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Roche<br>
Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Infected cell supematants were<br>
removed and 50 jol of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (without phenol red)<br>
and 50 pi of luciferase assay reagent reconstituted as described by the<br>
manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was added per<br>
well. Luciferase activity was then quantified by measuring luminescence using a<br>
Wallac microbeta scintillation counter.<br>
5. The percent inhibition for each compound was calculated by quantifying the level<br>
of luciferase expression'in cells infected in the presence of each compound as a<br>
percentage of that observed for cells infected in the absence of compound and<br>
subtracting such a determined value from 100.<br>
6. An ECso provides a method for comparing the antiviral potency of the compounds<br>
of this invention. The effective concentration for fifty percent inhibition (ECso)<br>
was calculated with the Microsoft Excel Xlfit curve fitting software. For each<br>
compound, curves were generated from percent inhibition calculated at 10<br>
different concentrations by using a four paramenter logistic model (model 205).<br>
The ECso data for the compounds is shown in Tables 2-4. Table 1 is the key for<br>
the data in Tables 2-4.<br>
Cytoxicity assays were conducted with the same HeLa using methodology well<br>
known in the art. This method has been described in the literature (S Weislow, R<br>

The data in Table 5 was obtained using the general procedures above and by f<br>
the following methods. Data is not reported for all compounds since data for all the<br>
compounds is reported by the alternate method hi the previous Tables 1-4. The<br>
percent inhibition for each compound was calculated by quantifying the level of<br>
luciferase. expression in cells infected in the presence of compound as a percentage of<br>
that observed for cells infected in the absence of compound and subtracting such a<br>
determined value from 100. For compounds tested at concentrations less than 10 |JM,<br>
the percent inhibition at 10 uM was determined by extrapolation using the XLfit<br>
curve fitting feature of the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software. Curves were<br>
obtained from 10 data points (% inhibition determined at 10 concentrations of<br>
compound) by using a four parameter logistic model (XLfit model 205: y = A + ((BA)/(<br>
l+((C/x)D))), where, A = minimum y, B = maximum y, C = logECso, D = slope<br>
factor, and x and y are known data values. Extrapolations were performed with the A<br>
and B parameters unlocked.<br>

The incubation media consisted of potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), liver<br>
microsomes (final concentration 0.9 mg/ml), magnesium chloride (0.033 mM), and a<br>
NADPH-regenerating system. The cof actors of the NADPH-regenerating system<br>
consisted of NADPH (final concentration 0.425 mg/ml), glucose-6-phosphate (final<br>
concentration 0.512 mg/ml), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (final<br>
concentration 0.6 unit/ml). The test compound was pre-incubated in the media for 2<br>
min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the cofactors. The incubation was<br>
carried out at 37°C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by drawing an aliquot of<br>
100 L from the incubation and adding into 200 fiL of acetonitrile containing a<br>
reference compound as an external analytical standard. Following vortex-mixing and<br>

from the jugular vein in EDTA-containing microtainer tubes (Becton Dickinson,<br>
Franklin Lakes, NJ), and centrifuged to separate plasma.<br>
In the IV study, the test compound was delivered at 1 mg/kg as a bolus over 0.5 min<br>
(n = 3). Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and 2, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60,<br>
120, 240, 360, 480, and 1440 min after dosing.<br>
In the PO study of the test compound, the rats (n = 3) received an oral dose of 5<br>
mg/kg of BMS-585248. Serial blood samples were collected before dosing and 15,<br>
30,45, 60, 120,240,360,480, and 1440 min after dosing.<br>
Quantitation of Compounds in Plasma. Aliquots of plasma samples from rat,<br>
studies were prepared for analysis by precipitating plasma proteins with two volumes<br>
of acetonitrile containing an internal standard of a similar compound. The resulting<br>
supernates were separated from the precipitated proteins by centrifugation for 10<br>
minutes and transferred to autosampler vials. Samples were either prepared<br>
manually, or with the use of the Tomtec automated liquid handler.. An aliquot of 5<br>
uL was injected for analysis.<br>
The HPLC system consisted of two Shimadzu LC10AD pumps (Columbia, MD), a<br>
Shimadzu SDL-HTC autosampler (Columbia, MD), and a Hewlett Packard Series<br>
1100 column compartment (Palo Alto, CA). The column was a YMC Pro CIS (2.0 x<br>
50 mm, 3 nm particles, Waters Co., Milford, MA), maintained at 60°C and a flow<br>
rate of 0.3 ml/min. The mobile phase consisted of 10 mM ammonium formate and<br>
0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 100% 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1%<br>
formic acid in methanol (B). The initial mobile phase composition was 95% A.<br>
After sample injection, the mobile phase was changed to 15% A/85% B over 2<br>
minutes and held at that composition for an additional 1 minute. The mobile phase<br>
was then returned to initial conditions and the column re-equilibrated for 1 minute.<br>
Total analysis time was 4 minutes.<br>
The HPLC was interfaced to a Micromass Quattro LC. Ultra high purity nitrogen<br>
was used as the nebulizing and desolvation gas at flow rates of 100 Uhi for<br>
nebulization and 1100 L/hr for desolvation. The desolvation temperature was 300°C<br>
and the source temperature was 150°C. Data acquisition utilized selected reaction<br>
monitoring (SRM). Ions representing the (M+H)+ species for the compound and the<br>
internal standard were selected in MSI and collisionally dissociated with argon at a<br>
pressure of 2 x 10"3 torr to form specific product ions which were subsequently<br>
monitored by MS2.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally,<br>
parenterally (including subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
intrasternal injection or infusion techniques), by inhalation spray, or rectally, in<br>
dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceuticaUyacceptable<br>
carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the present invention there is further provided a<br>
method of treating and a pharmaceutical composition for treating viral infections such<br>
as HIV infection and AIDS. The treatment involves administering to a patient in<br>
need of such treatment a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutical<br>
carrier and a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of oraUy-administrable<br>
suspensions or tablets; nasal sprays, sterile injectable preparations, for example, as<br>
sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspensions or suppositories.<br>
When administered orally as a suspension, these compositions are prepared<br>
according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may<br>
contain microcrystalline cellulose for imparting bulk, alginic acid or sodium alginate<br>
as a suspending agent, methylcellulose as a viscosity enhancer, and<br>
sweetners/flavoring agents known in the art. As immediate release tablets, these<br>
compositions may contain macrocrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, starch,<br>
magnesium stearate and lactose and/or other excipients, binders, extenders,<br>
disintegrants, diluents and lubricants known in the art.<br>
The injectable solutions or suspensions may be formulated according to<br>
known art, using suitable non-toxic, parenterally-acceptable diluents or solvents, such<br>
as mannitol, 1,3-butanediol, water, Ringer's solution or isotonic sodium chloride<br>
solution, or suitable dispersing or wetting and suspending agents, such as sterile,<br>
bland, fixed oils, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, and fatty acids, including<br>
oleic acid.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be administered orally to humans in a<br>
dosage range of 1 to 100 mg/kg body weight in divided doses. One preferred dosage<br>
range is 1 to 10 mg/kg body weight orally in divided doses. Another preferred dosage<br>
range is 1 to 20 mg/kg body weight orally in divided doses. It will be understood,<br>
however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular<br>
patient maybe varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity<br>
of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of<br>
that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular<br>
condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br>
Scheme 41a depicts methodology for converting a carboxylic acid to an<br>
alkynyl ketone. The alkynyl ketone precursors can then be converted to pyrazoles or<br>
isoxazoles upon reaction withhydrazines or hydroxyl amines, respectively.<br>
The invention is intended to cover isomers, diasteroisomers, stereoisomers,<br>
and enantiomers of the depicted formulas when one or more asymmetric carbons are<br>
present in the molecules. An asymmetric carbon is one hi which the carbon is<br>
attached to four different substitutions. In particular, the invention is intended to<br>
cover isomers or a single enantiomer especially when one enantiomer displays<br>
superior properties. Enantiomers differ from one another in that the spatial<br>
arrangement of the substituents around the chiral centers of the asymmetric carbons<br>
result in each molecule being a nonsuperimposable mirror image of the other. In this<br>
application, the configuration of the substitaents around an asymmetric carbon are<br>
defined unambiguously as either (R) which is a standard representation which stands<br>
for Latin rectus, right or (S) which is the standard representation for Latin sinister,<br>
left in the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog nomenclature system which has been in use since the<br>
1960s. Standard rules for defining the configuration of these centers are found in any<br>
basic organic chemistry textbook. In particular, for this application and based on<br>
initial examples, when W contains a single methyl group as depicted below, when the<br>
carbon bearing the methyl group is in the (R) configuration it may show a potency<br>
advantage over the (S) enantiomer. Occasionally the (R)-methyl piperazine may<br>
show a potency advantage over the unsubstituted piperazine. These observations are<br>
compound specific effect and are not always present The unsubstituted piperazine<br>
and (S) enantiomers are still potent antiviral compounds despite occasionally being<br>
less potent than the (R) enantiomer.<br>
When the configuration of a methyl piperazine shown as below is (R) the<br>
methyl group may improve the metabolic stability of the adjacent amide as compared<br>
to the (S) methyl piperazine or the unsubstituted piperazine. However, the metabolic<br>
stability of the amide bond is compound specific and a methyl substituent is not<br>
necessarily required for optimal properties.<br>
It has now also been surprisingly found that compounds of Formula la, in<br>
which specifically R4 is an N-linked triazolyl group, attached at the 1-nitrogen<br>
position, are particularly effective for inhibiting HIV. This is discussed more fully<br>
below.<br>
The effective treatment of HIV and other viruses requires compounds that are<br>
potent inhibitors of the virus, are selective for the virus, and have the properties<br>
which allow them to safely achieve and maintain plasma level concentrations which<br>
are a maximum number multiples above the concentration required to minimally<br>
inhibit the virus. Higher exposures suppress viral replication and reduced rates of<br>
replication mean that strains of virus with resistance to the drug treatment will<br>
develop at a slower rate. Potent drugs exhibit equivalent activity from a lower<br>
concentration or lower dose than that needed to achieve the same effect from a less<br>
potent drag. Drugs which intrinsically produce higher exposures from an equivalent<br>
dose in animal models or patients (as determined by pharmacokrnetic measurements<br>
such as AUC (the sum of the concentration of drug over a particular time), Cmax, or<br>
Cmin will also provide greater benefit to the patient. Drugs which have higher<br>
stability in the presence of metabolizing pathways and enzymes will maintain their<br>
concentrations longer and thus require less frequent dosing or dosing of smaller<br>
quantities. In animals or people the rate of clearance is a frequently measured<br>
parameter to assess this property but mean retention time is also used. For accuracy,<br>
the determined measure of viral inhibition is an EC50; but the minimum plasma<br>
concentrations which should be maintained in a patient is generally believed to be at<br>
least four or five fold higher. Thus the antiviral or anti, HTV drug candidates which<br>
will be most likely to provide maximum benefits in patients and those that preclinical<br>
research programs strive to identify will exhibit 1) maximum potency 2) no general<br>
cytotoxicity vs the cell line used for the assay 3) low predicted rates of metabolism in<br>
human based on in vitro models 4) high exposure after oral dosing. Many other<br>
properties of potential drug candidates are evaluated in order to determine which<br>
compounds will have the best chance of showing optimal utility in human patients<br>
but the compounds of this invention were evaluated initially in part by determining:<br>
1) Potency vs HIV as determined by an EC50 in an initial pseudotype assay as<br>
described in the biology section.<br>
2) Lack of general cytotoxicity vs a Hela cell line. &gt;100uM was used as an arbitrary<br>
cut off for safety.<br>
3) Measurement of the rate of metabolism vs human liver microsomal preparations<br>
and from this data projecting human rate of clearance. Lower is better.<br>
4) Estimating potential exposure in man by measuring parameters such as AUC and<br>
rate of clearance by oral and iv dosing in rats. High exposure and low clearance was<br>
desired.<br>
Aazaindole oxoacetic piperazine amides have been disclosed in two series of<br>
patent applications. The first series discloses azaindole derivatives which have<br>
promising potential as antiviral agents (hereinafter called, reference 94) Wang, Tao et<br>
al, U.S. patent 6476034 and WO 0162255 Al, filed January 19,2001, published<br>
August 30,2001. The second series (hereinafter called, reference 106) Wang, Tao, et<br>
al discloses HIV Antiviral Activity of Substituted Azaindoleoxoacetic Piperazine<br>
Derivatives in U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 10/214,982 filed August 7,<br>
2002, which is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. Serial Number 10/038,306<br>
filed January 2, 2002 (corresponding to PCT Lit. Appl. (PCT/US02/00455), WO<br>
02/062423 Al, filed January 2,2002, published August 15, 2002. All of the<br>
references for these two series are incorporated by reference herein. Reference 106<br>
describes in part C-7 heteroaryl, aryl or substituted 4,5,6,or 7-azaindoles as antiviral<br>
agents and is the most relevant prior art.<br>
We have evaluated the properties of many compounds covered within the<br>
scope of references 94 and 106 and have found that the compounds having C-7, Nlinked<br>
triazole groups are surprisingly and unexpectedly superior.<br>
We initially evaluated compounds to determine which showed maximum<br>
potency or the lowest EC50 using the pseudotype assay described in the biology<br>
section of this application. In our case compounds with ECSOs less than 0.20 nM<br>
were considered of most interest since this covered the most potent compounds and<br>
accounted for assay variability of our initial screen. The stability of compounds were<br>
also evaluated to determine metabolic stability when incubated in in vitro<br>
preparations of human liver microsomes (HIM). This is one commonly used<br>
predictive system for evaluating the potential for human metabolism and projecting<br>
clearance rates in man. Compounds with low clearance rates were most desireable.<br>
Intermediate and high clearance compounds would be more likely to have difficulty<br>
achieving feasible dosing regimen's in man vs low clearance compounds.<br>
Compounds for which accurate determinations could not be made were also not<br>
advanced.<br>
Surprisingly, when the most promising compounds from the potency and <br>
metabolic stability criterias were evaluated in rats to measure their pharmacokinetic<br>
properties, one class of C-7 substituents, N linked triazoles of Formula la showed<br>
very low clearance and very high AUCs (exposure) when compared to the<br>
compounds of references 94 and 106.<br>
The compounds I having Formula la are described below:<br>
wherein:<br>
R2 is methoxy, fluoro or chloro;<br>
R4is<br>
D is hydrogen or Q-Ca alkyl;<br>
E is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, (Ci-CaJalkyl, O(Ci-C3)alkyl or<br>
CH2OCH3.<br>
R11 is either hydrogen or methyl in which the configuration to which the methyl is<br>
attached is (R) with the proviso that when R4 is 1,2,3-triazole, then R11 is hydrogen.<br>
The C-7 N-linked triazoles thus showed surprising properties as they were<br>
essentially, equivalent in potency to the most potent compounds covered by references<br>
94 and 106 that we have evaluated to date. They showed metabolic stability in<br>
human liver microsomes that was equivalent to the best compounds from the<br>
application. Unexpectedly, they showed clearance rates in rats that were much<br>
lower, usually 10 fold lower than the best compounds from those described in the<br>
applications of reference 94 and were the best of any compounds evaluated hi<br>
reference 106. Even more surprisingly, they were the only class of compounds to<br>
show significantly increased exposure in rats as shown by their AUCs.<br>
In summation, these N-linked triazoles exhibited a surprising combination of<br>
properties that would not be obvious to one skilled in the art relying on the disclosure<br>
of references 94 and 106. Only a single triazole is disclosed in WO 02/06423. This<br>
compound has an R4 substiuent which is a C-Iinked triazole, and not an N-linked<br>
triazole, and exhibited potency which was not comparable to the N-linked triazoles.<br>
No N-linked triazoles were described in the examples of the published PCT<br>
application from reference 106.<br>
The following data tables summarize the potency, predicted human clearance<br>
based on human liver microsomes, and the AUC and clearance determined by<br>
pharmacokinetic studies in rats for these N-linked triazoles of the invention herein<br>
compared with representative compounds and close analogs contained in PCT<br>
application WO 02/062423 Al, filed January 2,2002, published August 15,2002 and<br>
the published applications and patents contained in reference 94. As seen in the<br>
following tables the N linked triazoles herein identified as most preferred groups<br>
exhibit surprising superiority especially in terms of displaying maximum potency,<br>
metabolic stability equivalent to best in class and uniquely a high AUC (exposure)<br>
and low clearance in rats which is determined by oral and iv dosing at 5mg/kg and<br>
Img/kg respectively. The rat model is an initial model used to assess potential for<br>
exposure in man.<br>
The utility of compounds in the triazole class is surprisingly very dependent<br>
on the substituion patterns as depicted. For example the 1,2,3 triazoles attached at the<br>
2-position nitrogen atom have to date shown significantly reduced AUC (exposure) in<br>
rats compared to the compounds depicted. In addition, moving the E group when E is<br>
methyl, in the 1,2,4-N-linked triazole from position 3 to 5 provides compounds with<br>
significantly reduced potency. As can be seen in Table A2, the N-linked triazoles<br>
specified showed high potency in an initial antiviral assay.<br>
As evidenced by Tables A3-A8 of Comparator compounds, the metabolic<br>
stability of the N-linked triazole compounds la of the invention is surprisingly<br>
equivalent to or better than any of the compounds covered in either series of<br>
published azaindole applications (i.e. references 94 and 106).<br>
As dramatically shown in the tables, the low clearance and high exposure seen<br>
in rats for the compounds in table A2 was surprising and unexpected since the prior<br>
art taught compounds did not exhibit these properties as one would have expected.<br>
In the tables that follow these terms have the following in meanings:<br>
TSTT" meant not tested.<br>
"Difficulties" means results could not be interpreted (i.e. in HLM test).<br>
