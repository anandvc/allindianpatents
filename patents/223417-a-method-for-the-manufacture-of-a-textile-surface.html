				<td>The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing a textile surface with hydrophobic properties on one side and hydrophilic properties on the other, devices for utilising this process as well as application substances with which the textile surface is to be treated in accordance with the process and the devices.<br>
Textile surfaces having the aforementioned properties are already known. In these textile surfaces of prior art, the hydrophobic area of a textile surface is separated from its hydrophilic area by means of a differently configured membrane located in between the two fabrics and in a fixed connection with the fabrics. Since several production processes are involved, the manufacture of such kinds of textile surface is very time consuming and cost-intensive. In addition, the textile surface is very rigid as a result of the membrane which is usually bonded to both fabrics, and as a result there are often also difficulties with regard to processing the textile surface and the range of applications for the textile surface is restricted. Furthermore, it is disadvantageous that having the membrane as an intermediate layer in an article of clothing restricts the transport of moisture from the inside to the outside, while the garment is made bulky as a result of the thickness of the material.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is therefore to create a textile surface which can be manufactured in a very straightforward and economical fashion by means of special processes and/or devices and due to the application substances involved in these processes and/or devices, the textile surface offering a high degree of comfort to the wearer and in which, above all, it is assured that moisture will be immediately absorbed on the hydrophilically treated side, distributed over a wide area and rapidly taken away, while the<br>
hydrophobically treated side is water-repellent. The processes by means of which this is achieved, as well as the devices for utilising this process are intended to make this possible without difficulty and be of a straightforward design, while the application substances also should only be composed of a few conventional constituents with the result that textile surfaces with very different structures can be manufactured inexpensively.<br>
A process for manufacturing a textile surface with hydrophobic properties on one side and hydrophilic properties on the other is characterised in that the textile surface is hydrophilic in nature across its complete cross-section, that a paste is applied to one side of the textile surface in a continuous process, this paste comprising a viscous emulsion or dispersion of paraffin, polysiloxahe and/or fluorine compounds and only penetrating the cross-section of the textile surface over a partial area, and that the layer formed by the paste is then stabilised in a drying process in order to create the side of the textile surface with hydrophobic qualities.<br>
In accordance with another process, a first paste is once again continuously applied to one side of the textile surface, the paste comprising a viscous emulsion or dispersion of paraffin, polysiloxane and/or fluorine compounds, after which the coat formed by the paste is stabilised in a drying process, then a second viscous paste comprising hydrophilic polymers is applied to the other side of the textile surface which is stabilised in another drying process, in which case each of the pastes only penetrates the cross-section of the textile surface over a partial area. It goes without saying that in this process it is also possible to apply the second paste to the textile surface first, followed by the first paste.<br>
Another process for manufacturing a textile surface of the aforementioned kind in accordance with the present invention is characterised in that a paste is once again continuously applied to one side of the textile surface, the paste comprising a viscous emulsion or dispersion of paraffin, polysiloxane and/or fluorine compounds, that after this the coat formed by the paste is stabilised in a drying process, and that then, however, a liquor comprising hydrophilic<br>
polymers is applied to the other side of the textile surface and is stabilised in a further drying process in order to create the side of the textile surface with hydrophilic properties, in which case the liquor can be applied to the textile surface by means of a soaking bath, an applicator roll or a spray head.<br>
In this process too, it is possible to apply the liquor to the textile surface first and then the paste, and if necessary to apply the emulsion or dispersion of paraffin, polysiloxane and/or fluorine compounds as a liquor and to apply the hydrophilic polymers to the textile surface in the form of a paste.<br>
In each case, the pastes are to be applied to the textile surface using a coating doctor blade.<br>
However, the pastes can also be applied to one or both sides of the textile surface using rotating pressure rolls, in which case the pastes can be applied to one side of the textile surface by means of coating and to the other side by printing.<br>
During the drying process, the textile surface should be exposed to a temperature of 80 to 200 Â°C.<br>
The devices for utilising these processes should be characterised in that a coating doctor blade is used for applying a paste comprising a viscous emulsion or dispersion of paraffin, polysiloxane and/or fluorine compounds or a paste comprising hydrophilic polymers, while a soaking bath through which the textile surface is passed, an applicator roll revolving in a trough holding the liquor or a spray head is used for applying a liquor comprising an emulsion or dispersion of paraffin, polysiloxane and/or fluorine compounds or a liquor comprising hydrophilic polymers, and in the case of the soaking bath, the textile surface should be passed through one or more pairs of pressure rolls after immersion.<br>
The hydrophobically acting pastes which can be used as application substances should consist of 2 to 100 parts paraffin emulsion containing<br>
zircon salt or of 2 to 10 parts polysiloxane emulsion and 98 to 0 parts water and 1 to 3 parts synthetic or natural thickening agent with a viscosity of 2000 to 15,000 mPa.s, or of 2 to 100 parts emulsion or dispersion of fluorine compounds or fluoropolymers, 98 to 0 parts water and 1 to 10 parts synthetic or natural thickening agent with a viscosity of 2000 to 15,000 mPa.s, or the paste should consist of a modified fluorocarbon with a solid matter content of 2.4 % and having a viscosity of 5000 to 10,000 mPa.s.<br>
The hydrophobically acting liquor to be utilised in the same way can consist of 1 to 100 parts paraffin emulsion containing zircon salt or of 1 to 100 parts<br>
polysiloxane emulsion and 99 to 0 parts water, although it is also possible to<br>
the hydrophilically acting pastre manufacture from 2 to 100 parts dispersion of hydrophilic polymers,<br>
98 to 100 parts water and 0.5 to 4 parts synthetic or natural thickening agent with a viscosity of 2000 to 15,000 mPa.s.<br>
In accordance with another recipe, the hydrophilically acting liquor can also consist of 1 to 100 parts dispersion of hydrophilic polymers and 99 to 0 parts water.<br>
Furthermore, it is appropriate for the hydrophobically acting paste to be applied to the textile surface at a rate of 30 to 100 g/m2 at a temperature of approx. 140 to 170 Â°C and within a contact time of at least 1 minute and for the hydrophilically acting paste to be applied to the textile surface at a rate of 30 to 100 g/m2 at a temperature of approx. 140 to 170 Â°C and within a contact time of at least 10 seconds.<br>
By utilising the processes and devices in accordance with the present invention as well as the application substances provided for in the present invention, it is possible to create a textile surface from only one layer of fabric which offers extraordinarily good hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties, and can as a result be used in a wide range of applications. This is because the hydrophobically acting application substance applied to the textile surface in a defined fashion supplies the precondition for the remaining area of the textile<br>
surface to be provided with hydrophilic characteristics, with the result that both areas fulfil the very different functions specified.<br>
An article of clothing with a hydrophobic exterior therefore offers protection to the wearer in the rain, when walking through wet grass, while this side is also less susceptible to dirt and easier to clean. On the other hand, the hydrophilic interior of the garment absorbs a large quantity of moisture within a short period of time, which is then distributed over a wide area and can escape via the outer side. Consequently, an article of clothing manufactured from a textile surface produced in accordance with the present invention is very comfortable to wear.<br>
The production complexity involved in impregnating textile surfaces using the processes and devices in accordance with the present invention as well as the application substances provided for in the present invention is very low, which means they can be treated in an inexpensive fashion. Furthermore, the textile surfaces can easily be adapted to suit the particular application, in particular with regard to the material thickness, and as a result a very wide range of applications is made possible.<br>
The drawing shows devices for utilising the process in accordance with the present invention, the details of which are explained below. In the drawing, each of the figures of which are schematic in nature,<br>
Figure 1 shows a device for applying a paste to one side of a textile<br>
surface with hydrophilic properties,<br>
Figure 2 shows the device in accordance with Figure 1 followed by a<br>
second device for applying a second paste to the other side of the textile surface,<br>
Figures 3, 4 and 5<br>
show the device in accordance with Figure 1 followed by devices provided with a soaking bath or and applicator roll or a spray head and<br>
Figures 6, 7 and 8<br>
show the devices in accordance with Figures 3, 4 and 5, in each case followed by a device in accordance with Figure 1.<br>
The devices displayed in Figures 1 to 8 and identified in each case by A, B, C or D serve to apply a hydrophobically acting paste 11 or a hydrophilically acting paste 12 and a hydrophobically acting liquor 21 or a hydrophilically acting liquor 22 to a textile surface 1 which is hydrophilic across its complete cross-section, and the aforementioned devices are configured differently from one another.<br>
The devices A in accordance with Figure 1 or A, A in accordance with Figure 2 each comprise reversing rollers 2 and contact rollers 3 by means of which the hydrophilic textile surface 1 is guided, coating doctor blades 13 or 14 as well as a dryer 4 or two dryers 4 and 5 following the coating doctor blades 13 or 14. By means of device A in accordance with Figure 1, the hydrophobically acting paste 11 is applied to one side of the hydrophilic textile surface 1 using a coating doctor blade 13, this hydrophobically acting paste 11 penetrates part of the way into the textile surface 1 and is stabilised in the dryer 4. The side of the textile surface identified by 1' is therefore hydrophobic while the other side 1" remains hydrophilic.<br>
With the help of device A, which as shown in Figure 2 is connected following device A and is configured in the same manner, the coating doctor blade 14 is used to apply a hydrophilically acting paste 12 to the side 1" of the textile surface, this hydrophilically acting paste 12 being stabilised in the dryer 5. As a result, the textile surface 1 has a hydrophobically acting side 1' and a hydrophilically acting side 1".<br>
Figures 1 and 2 furthermore show that the hydrophobically acting paste 11 and the hydrophilically acting paste 12 can also be applied to the textile surface by means of printing. Dash-dot printing rolls 31 and 32 arranged in the area of the contact rollers 3 are provided for this purpose. As a result, the pastes 11 and 12 are continuously applied to one or both sides 1', 1" of the textile surface 1 using the rotary printing process.<br>
In accordance with Figure 3, device A has a device B assigned to it, which is equipped with a soaking bath 23 provided with reversing rollers 2' and 2". For this purpose, a trough 24 is filled with the liquor 22 which has a hydrophilic effect and through which is passed the textile surface 1 by means of the reversing roller 2" arranged in the soaking bath 23. In the dryer 5, the liquor 22 is stabilised in the area of the textile surface 1 which was not impregnated with the paste 11, so that the textile surface 1 once again possesses a hydrophobically acting side V and a hydrophilically acting side 1".<br>
In order to reduce the amount of energy consumed by the dryer 5, the soaking bath 23 is followed by a pair of pressure rolls 25, 26 through which the textile surface 1 is drawn. The pair of pressure rolls 25, 26 therefore significantly reduces the moisture content of the textile surface 1.<br>
In accordance with Figure 4, an applicator roll 27 is used to apply the liquor 22 held in a trough 28 to the textile surface 1. In this process, two tensioning rollers 2"' keep the textile surface 1 pressed against the applicator roll 27 which picks up the liquor 22, with the result that the liquor 22 is transferred onto the textile surface 1. In the dryer 5, the absorbed hydrophilically acting liquor 22 is stabilised in the area of the textile surface 1 which was not impregnated with the paste 11, so that the side 1' of the textile surface 1 is hydrophobic whereas the side 1" is hydrophilic.<br>
However, as shown in Figure 5, the liquor 22 can also be sprayed onto the textile surface 1. A spray head in device D is used for this purpose, by means of which the liquor 22 is applied to the textile surface 1 in order to produce its hydrophilic side 1".<br>
In accordance with Figures 6, 7 and 8, device A is preceded in each case by devices B, C and D. In accordance with Figure 6, the soaking bath 23 applies the hydrophilically acting liquor 22 to the textile surface 1, while the hydrophobically acting paste 11 makes side 11 of the textile surface hydrophobic. The combination of devices C and A shown in Figure 7 acts in the same manner.<br>
It goes without saying, however, that the soaking bath 23 or the applicator roll 27 can be used for applying a hydrophobically acting liquor 21 to the textile surface 1, and in this case the subsequently applied hydrophilic paste 12 creates a hydrophilic film which absorbs moisture and distributes it over a wide area.<br>
Device D in Figure 8 sprays the hydrophobically acting liquor 21 onto the textile surface in such a way that it only penetrates a partial area of the textile surface. As a result, the hydrophilically acting paste 12 only influences that part of the textile surface 1 which is not hydrophobic, with the result that the textile surface 1 once again has a hydrophobically acting side 1 and a hydrophilically acting side 1".<br>
