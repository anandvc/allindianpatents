				<td>Introduction to the field of Invention<br>
The Invention in one aspect relates to a louvre bracket assembly for air washers/humidification plants/cooling towers,<br>
Prior art and drawbacks<br>
The air washer is used in chemical plant/power plant/textile mills, for the purposes of humidification and air cooling applications. Air is allowed to pass through a chamber where water is being sprayed using spray nozzles. Air is getting cooled and humidified but carries water droplets due to its velocity. At the end of each stage, the gas and liquid need separation. Air washers are used for separation of such liquid and gas. Intake louvres are installed in such air washers and these are supported by louvre brackets. Similarly, in a cooling tower, intake-louvres are installed horizontally for intake of Air.<br>
These louvres are supported by cutting slots on the cooling tower frame In case of timber or by grouting MS angle with the concrete wall and then aluminium cleats are riveted to this MS angle to provide support to the intake louvres.<br>
The above methods of installation are very cumbersome and time consuming. They also need frequent maintenance and do not provide longer life usage of timber as intake louvres results cutting off trees and affecting the environment.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is thus an object of this Invention to propose an improved means by using which it is possible to solve maintenance problems and save the environment.<br>
It is another object of this Invention to propose a support system, which is simple to install, maintenance free and long lasting.<br>
It is a further object of this Invention to suggest novel bracket means for holding the louvres effectively.<br>
It is yet another objects of this Invention to propose such a bracket means, which can be made to customers needs and can be easily installed.<br>
It is a still further object of this Invention to propose such a bracket means which can be made cost effective and does not need expert supervision to install and can be easily installed by average skilled labours.<br>
These and other objects of the Invention will be clear from the following paragraphs. Brief Statement of the Invention<br>
Thus according to this Invention, there is provided a louvre bracket assembly for use in air washing in required industrial plants comprising a pair of mounting brackets spaced apart from each other, a plurality of louvres mounted between the said brackets, holding means for holding the brackets in position and securing means for securing the said holding means to support structures/members of the unit where it is used.<br>
The pair of brackets are opposed to each other and each bracket has inner plane and outer plane integrally formed together.<br>
The outer plane is in the form of channel section and has preferably has four sides, a first base side extending across the width of the bracket, a second side extending across the depth of the bracket, a third side parallel to the first side extending across a part width of the bracket and a fourth side parallel to the said second side extending across the depth of the bracket and all the four sides also extending substantially to the entire length of the bracket.<br>
All the four sides are contiguous in that order, the said first side is at the back of the said inner plane, the said third side has an open central portion and the first side forms substantially the width of the channel while the second and fourth sides form substantially the depth of the channel, while the length of the all the sides form substantially the length of the channel.<br>
The inner plane has a plurality of pairs of louvre guide members spaced apart in parallel relationship, there being formed a louvre resting channel between each said individual pairs and each pair is spaced apart from the other pair in an equidistant manner.<br>
The pairs of louvre guide members are disposed angularity in said parallel relationship on the said inner plane and each of the two members of every pair is almost identical to the other in shape, size and configuration.<br>
Each of the two members have a first member and a second member, all of the said first members being identical in shape, size and configuration and identically disposed on the inner plane.<br>
Each of the two members have a first member and a second member, all of the said second members being identical in shape, size and configuration and identically disposed on the inner plane.<br>
The pairs of louvre guide members are of any convenient shape, configuration and size and are formed preferably as small vertical projections/protrusions from the inner plane.<br>
The pairs of louvre guide members are formed integrally with the inner plane and the ends are aligned in a straight line respectively near the left and right ends of the width of the plane of the bracket.<br>
Each of the louvre resting channel between each of the said pairs is an open and a through inclined channel and all the channels are of identical dimensions.<br>
Each louvre is identical to the other and has three planes, a first lower plane, a second intermediate plane and a third upper plane, the ends of the first and third plane facing opposite directions.<br>
The said louvre first plane is formed slanting slightly upwards, if not horizontal and is arranged to receive incoming air from the unit while, the said middle plane is arranged as an air guiding plane to guide the air from the lower first plane upwardly and the second middle plane is a straight plane connecting the lower first plane and the top third plane.<br>
The top third plane is arranged to exit the air received from the unit after passing through the said first and said second planes and is disposed slanting slightly upwards and all the three planes are contiguous to one another.<br>
The louvre is formed of any suitable material, which is resistant to corrosion.<br>
Each of the louvre is mounted with the left end of the middle second plane inserted into an inclined channel formed on the inner plane of a bracket, such that, the first lower plane and the third top plane of the louvre are disposed outside the width of the left side bracket and face in opposite directions and wherein the right side bracket is in alignment in position with the respective inclined channels accommodating the respective middle planes of the respective louvres, so as to, form a louvre bracket assembly.<br>
The louvre assembly is provided with the mounting means such as flat bars snugly fitting within the length, breadth and thickness of the channel formed on the outer plane of each bracket and wherein said bars are provided with provisions such as holes to enable these bars to be fixed to the respective walls of the unit using screws, bolts etc. with the louvre assembly mounted there between.<br>
The Louvre is a solid piece or a hollow double walled construction made preferably of synthetic material and is light in weight.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The Invention will now be more fully described with reference to the figures of the accompanying drawings, which is only a preferred embodiment of the Invention.<br>
In the drawings,<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a preferred form of a louvre.<br><br>
Figure 2 illustrates a left /inner view of a bracket.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a right inner  /    view of a bracket.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an inner perspective view of a bracket.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates an outer perspective view of a bracket.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates inner view of a bracket with four numbers of louvres mounted on the same.<br>
/ Figure 7 illustrates a perspective view of the metal plate used for fixing the bracket and louvre,<br>
assembly to the wall of the cooling tower or other unit.<br>
Detailed description of the drawings<br>
It will be seen from the figures of the drawings that the louvre bracket assembly 1 consists of a pair of brackets 2 of desired length, breadth and a plurality of louvres 3 of desired length and shaped. In the drawings, it will be seen that each louvre is mounted with its middle portion 3b into the inclined straight channel portion 2a of the bracket 2. This channel portion is integrally formed within the inner side 2b of the bracket by means of a pair of rigid raised portions 2c/2d.<br>
The bracket can have as many numbers of such channel portions "2a" as there are numbers of louvres to be mounted one on each channel.<br>
The angle of inclination of the channel decides the angle of inclination of the louvre. All the channels are uniformly inclined, though individual inclinations of the pair of bracket may vary if desired.<br>
The top end 3a and lower end 3c of the louvre preferably have nearly horizontal inlet end 3aa, 3cc and outlet end respectively for air, though this may slightly vary.<br>
For assembling the unit, one end of a plurality of louvres are first mounted on the inner side of the pair of brackets.<br>
Where after, the inner side of the other bracket is used to hold the free ends of the louvres. For this, the brackets, the inner channels, the angles of inclinations distances between the adjacent inner channels, length and width of the channels vis va vis the mid portions of the louvres and other design construction aspects are carefully decided so that a perfect assembly is easily made.<br>
For mounting the assembly to the walls of the desired unit, there is provided another channel 3d on the outer side of the bracket. This channel runs vertically through the entire outer length of the bracket and is open on both its top and bottom ends.<br>
There is provided a metal plate 4 of suitable size matching the outer channel in cross-section.<br>
This metal plate 4 can be of any desired length to hold a single or more such louvre bracket assembly.<br>
Then outer channel portion of the bracket snugly slip through the metal plate end is held tightly thereto.<br>
The final assembly thus comprises a pair of fixing plates 4a, 4b, a pair of brackets 4&amp; A mounted on the holding plates and a plurality of louvres 2 held between the opposed inner sides of the brackets.<br>
There can be more than one such pair of brackets held to the mounting plate as can be determined by the length of the plate.<br>
The mounting plate is provided with suitable holes 4c, 4d to fix the mounting plates to the walls of the unit (not shown) using suitable screens (not shown) or other such fixing means.<br>
In function, the air enters through the lower inner surface of the louvres, is deflected upwards by the inclined lower surfaces and is exited into the unit through the upper surface of the top end of the lower.<br>
The louvres and the brackets can be made from any suitable material like metal sheets or synthetic plastics by well-known techniques.<br>
This louvre bracket assembly is corrosion proof, erosion proof, cheap to assemble and requires almost no maintenance cost or supervision cost. If necessary a single louvre can be replaced in the rare instance of any damage or breakage.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
