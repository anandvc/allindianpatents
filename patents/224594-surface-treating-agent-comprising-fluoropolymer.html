DESCRIPTION<br>
SURFACE-TREATING AGENT COMPRISING FLUOROPOLYMER<br>
TECHINICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a polymer and a treatment which impart excellent water repellency, oil repellency and soil resistance to a textile, a masonry, an electrostatic filter, a dust protective mask, and a part of fuel cell.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Hitherto, a fluorine-containing acrylate polymer is used as an active component of a water- and oil-repel lent agent. Side chain fluoroalkyl groups in practically used fluorine-containing acrylate monomers usually have at least 8 carbon atoms. There is a defect that the fluorine-containing acrylate monomer is excessively hydrophobic since the length of the f luoroalkyl chain is long. The excessive hydrophobicity has caused various problems on the preparation and properties of the fluorine-containing acrylate polymer.<br>
When an emulsion polymerization is used for the preparation of the fluorine-containing acrylate polymer, there are problems that emulsif iers should be used in a<br><br>
large amount and the types of the emulsifiers are limited, and that an auxiliary solvent should be used because of poor solubility with another fluorine-free monomer. When a solution polymerization is used for the preparation of the fluorine-containing acrylate polymer, there was the problem that the fluorine-containing acrylate monomer has low solubility in a polymerization solvent so that a sufficient monomer solution cannot be obtained.<br>
As to the properties of the fluorine-containing acrylate polymer, there is the problem that sufficient water repellency cannot be imparted to the substrate. This problem seems to be caused by excessive hydrophobicity given by the long fluoroalkyl group.<br>
Various up-to-date research results indicate that in view of the practical treatment of fibers with the surface treatment agent (particularly the water- and oil-repellent agent), the important surface property is not a static contact angle, but is a dynamic contact angle, particularly a reversing contact angle. That is, the advancing contact angle of water is not dependent on the carbon number of the fluoroalkyl side chain, but the reversing contact angle of water in the case of carbon number of at most 7 is remarkably low than that in the case of carbon number of at least 8. In correspondence to this, an X ray analysis shows that the side chain crystallizes when the carbon<br><br>
number of side chain is at least 7. It is known that the practical water repellency has the relationship with the crystallization of the side chain and that motility of the surface treatment agent molecules is an important factor for revelation of the practical performances (for example, MAEKAWA takashige, FINE CHEMICAL, Vol. 23, No. 6, page 12 (1994) ) . Accordingly, it is believed that the acrylate polymer having low carbon number of fluoroalkyl group in the side chain which is at most 7 (particularly at most 6) has low crystallinity so that the polymer cannot satisfy the practical performances (particularly water repellency) .<br>
JP-A-63-90588, JP-A- 63-992 8 5 and JP-A-01-315471 disclose that a fluorine-containing acrylate polymer wherein the alpha-position is substituted with fluorine, chlorine or the like has good properties such as good adhesion to a substrate, high strength of a film and good water- and oil-repellency. These publications describe that the fluoroalkyl group used in Examples has at least 8 carbon atoms and does not suggest to use the acrylate monomer having the fluoroalkyl group having at most 6 carbon atoms.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION (Technical Problems to be Solved by the Invention)<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a fluorine-containing acrylate polymer having excellent water repellency,  oil  repellency,  soil  resistance  and  stain<br><br>
adhesion resistance, even when a side chain is a short fluoroalkyl group having at most 6 carbon atoms.<br>

wherein an alpha-position is substituted by a X group,<br>
(b)	the monomer free from a fluorine atom, and<br>
optionally present, (c) the crosslinkable monomer.<br>
The repeating units (A) are derived from (a) the fluorine-containing monomer of the formula (I). In the formula (I), the Rf group is preferably a perfluoroalkyl group. The carbon number of the Rf group is from 1 to 6, for example, from 1 to 4.<br>
Y is preferably an aliphatic group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an aromatic group or cycloaliphatic group having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, a -CH2CH2N (R1) S02- group (R1 is<br><br>

The aliphatic group is preferably an alkylene group (particularly the carbon number is from 1 to 4, for example, 1 or 2). The aromatic group and cycloaliphatic group may be substituted or unsubstituted.<br>
Examples of fluorine-containing monomer  (a)  are as follows:<br><br><br><br>

The copolymerization with the monomer (b) and/or the monomer (c) can optionally improve various properties such as water- and oil-repellency and soil resistance; cleaning durability and washing durability of said repellency and resistance; solubility in solvent; hardness; and feeling.<br>
In the fluorine-containing polymer, the amount of the fluorine atom-free monomer (b) may be from 0.1 to 100 parts by weight, for example, from 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, and<br>
the amount of the crosslinkable monomer (c) may be at most 50 parts by weight, for example, at most 20 parts by weight, particularly, from 0.1 to 15 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the fluorine-containing monomer (a).<br>
The fluorine-containing polymer can be produced as follows.<br>
In a solution polymerization,  there can be used a<br><br>
method of dissolving the monomer(s) into an organic solvent in the presence of a polymerization initiator, replacing the atmosphere by nitrogen, and stirring the mixture with heating at the temperature within the range from 3 0°C to 120°C for 1 hour to 10 hours. Examples of the polymerization initiator include azobisisobutyronitrile, benzoyl peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, lauryl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl peroxypivalate and diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate. The polymerization initiator may be used in the amount within the range from 0.01 to 20 parts by weight, for example, from 0.01 to 10 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of total of the monomers.<br>
The organic solvent is inert to the monomer'(s) and dissolves  the monomer(s) ,  and examples  thereof include acetone, chloroform, HCHC225, isopropyl alcohol, pentane, hexane,  heptane,  octane,  cyclohexane,  benzene,  toluene, xylene,  petroleum  ether,  tetrahydrofuran,  1,4-dioxane, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl acetate, butyl    acetate,     1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane,     1,1,1-trichloroethane,   trichloroethylene,   perchloroethylene, tetrachlorodifluoroethan£   and   trichlorotrifluoroethane. The organic solvent may be used in the amount within the range from 50 to 2,000 parts by weight, for example, from 50 to 1,000 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight<br><br>
1<br>
of total of the monomers.<br>
In an emulsion polymerization, there can be used a method of emulsifying monomers in water in the presence of a polymerization initiator and an emulsifying agent, replacing the atmosphere by nitrogen, and polymerizing with stirring, for example, at the temperature within the range<br>
from 50°C to 80°C for 1 hour to 10 hours. As the polymerization initiator, for example, water-soluble initiators (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, t-butyl perbenzoate, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl hydroperoxide, 3-carboxypropionyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, azobisisobutyl-amidine dihydrochloride, azobisisobutyronitrile, sodium peroxide, potassium persulfate and ammonium persulfate) and oil-soluble initiators (e.g., azobisisobutyronitrile, benzoyl peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, lauryl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl peroxypivalate and diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate) are used. The polymerization initiator may be used in the amount within the range from 0.01 to 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the monomers.<br>
In order to obtain a polymer dispersion in water, which is superior in storage stability, it is desirable that the monomers are atomized in water by using an emulsifying device capable of applying a strong shattering energy (e.g., a high-pressure homogenizer and an ultrasonic<br><br>
homogenizer) and then polymerized with using the oil-soluble polymerization initiator. As the emulsifying agent, various emulsifying agents such as an anionic emulsifying agent, a cationic emulsifying agent and a nonionic emulsifying agent can be used in the amount within the range from 0.5 to 20 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the monomers. When the monomers are not completely compatibilized, a compatibilizing agent (e.g., a water-soluble organic solvent and a low-molecular weight monomer) capable of sufficiently compatibilizing them is preferably added to these monomers. By the addition of the compatibilizing agent, the emulsifiability and polymerizability can be improved.<br>
Examples of the water-soluble organic solvent include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol and ethanol. The water-soluble organic solvent may be used in the amount within the range from 1 to 50 parts by weight, e.g., from 10 to 40 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of water. Examples of the low-molecular weight monomer include methyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate. The low-molecular weight monomer may be used in the amount within the range from 1 to 50 parts by weight, e.g., from 10 to 40 parts by weight,<br><br>
based on 100 parts by weight of total of monomers.<br>
The surface treatment agent of the present invention is preferably in the form of a solution, an emulsion or an aerosol. The surface treatment agent generally comprises the fluorine-containing polymer and a medium (particularly a liquid medium, for example, an organic solvent and/or water). The concentration of the fluorine-containing polymer in the surface treatment agent may be, for example, from 0.1 to 50 %  by weight.<br>
The surface treatment agent can be applied to a substrate to be treated by a know procedure. Usually, the surface treatment agent is diluted or dispersed with an organic solvent or water, is adhered to surfaces of the substrate by a well-known procedure such as an immersion coating, a spray coating and a foam coating, and is dried. If necessary, the surface treatment agent is applied together with a suitable crosslinking agent, followed by curing. It is also possible to add other surface treatment agents (for example, a water repellent agent and an oil repellent agent), or mothproofing agents, softeners, antimicrobial agents, flame retardants, antistatic agents, paint fixing agents, crease-proofing agents, etc. to the surface treatment agent of the present invention. For the immersion coating, the concentration of the fluorine-containing compound in the treatment liquid contacted with<br><br>
V<br>
the substrate may be from 0.05 to 10% by weight, based on the treatment liquid. For the spray coating, the concentration of the fluorine-containing compound in the treatment liquid may be from 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on the treatment liquid. A stain blocker may be used. When the stain blocker is used, it is preferable to use an anionic emulsifier or a nonionic surfactant.<br>
The substrate to be treated with the surface treatment agent (for example, a water- and oil-repellent agent) of the present invention include a textile, masonry, a filter (for example, an electrostatic filter), a dust protective mask, a part of fuel cell (for example, a gaseous diffusion electrode and a gaseous diffusion support), glass, paper, wood, leather, fur, asbestos, brick, cement, metal and oxide, ceramics, plastics, a coated surface and a plaster. The textile may be particularly a carpet. The textile has various examples. Examples of the textile include animal-or vegetable-origin natural fibers such as cotton, hemp, wool and silk; synthetic fibers such as polyamide, polyester, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl chloride and polypropylene; semi-synthetic, fibers such as rayon and acetate; inorg'anic fibers such as glass fiber, carbon fiber and asbestos fiber; and a mixture of these fibers. The treatment - agent of the present invention is excellent in resistance in a detergent liquid and brushing<br><br>
(mechanical), it can be suitably used for carpet made from nylon or polypropylene.<br>
The textile may be in any form such as a fiber, a fabric and the like. When the carpet is treated with the surface treatment agent of the present invention, the carpet may be formed after treating fibers or yarns with the surface treatment agent, or the formed carpet may be treated with the surface treatment agent.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following Examples further illustrate the present invention in detail but are not to be construed to limit the scope thereof.<br>
Shower water repellency test<br>
The shower water repellency was expressed by water repellency No. (as shown in the below-described Table 1) conducted according to JIS-L-1092.<br><br><br>
Water-repellency test<br>
A treated fabric is stored in a thermo-hygrostat having a temperature of 21°C and a humidity of 65% for at least 4 hours. A test liquid (isopropyl alcohol (IPA), water, and a mixture thereof, as shown in Table 2) which has been also stored at 21 °C is used. The test is conducted in an air-conditioned room having a temperature of 21°C and a humidity of 65%. A droplet of the test liquid in an amount of 0.05 mL is softly dropped by a micropipette on the fabric. If the droplet remains on the fabric after standing for 30 seconds, the test liquid passes the test. The water-repellency is expressed by a point corresponding to a maximum content (% by volume) of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in the test liquid which passes the test. The water-repellency is evaluated as twelve levels which are Fail, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 in order of a poor level to an excellent level.<br><br><br>
Oil-repellency test<br>
A treated fabric is stored in a thermo-hygrostat having a temperature of 21°C and a humidity of 65% for at least 4 hours. A test liquid (shown in Table 3) which has been also stored at 21°C is used. The test is conducted in an air-conditioned room having a temperature of 21 °C and a humidity of 65%. A droplet of the test liquid in an amount of 0.05 mL is softly dropped by a micropipette on the fabric. If the droplet remains on the fabric after standing for 30 seconds, the test liquid passes the test. The oil-repellency is expressed by a maximum point of the test liquid which passes the test. The oil-repellency is evaluated as nine levels which are Fail, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in order of a poor level to an excellent level.<br><br><br>
Storage stability test<br>
Test liquids (3 mass % in ethyl acetate) are prepared •from polymers obtained in Preparative Examples and Comparative Preparative Examples. After the test liquid is left standing for 2 4 hours at room temperature (25°C), the evolution of sedimentation of the treatment liquid is observed.<br>
Good:     No sedimentation Fair:     Slight sedimentation Poor:    Much sedimentation<br>
Monomers were prepared as follows: Preparative Example 1 Synthesis of 9F-Alc/aF monomer<br>
Into a 2 00 mL four-necked flask, 2-fluoroacrylic acid<br><br>
(19 g, 0.21 mol) and triethylamine (22.94 g, 0.23 mol) were charged. The atmosphere was purged with nitrogen for 30 minutes with stirring. After the internal temperature of the   flask  was   decreased  to   5°C  with  ice,   2-<br>
(perfluorobutyl)ethanol (9F-Alc) (54.52 g, 0.21 mol) was dropwise added for 4.5 hours so that a maximum of the internal temperature under nitrogen was 15°C. After the completion of the dropwise addition, the cooling with ice was continued for 30 minutes so that the exothermic reaction subsided and the internal temperature became 5°C. After the internal temperature was increased to the room temperature, no increase of the internal temperature was confirmed and the reaction was ripened for one hour. The reaction liquid was filtered and kept standing for one night. The reaction liquid was neutralized with an aqueous 10% NaHC03 solution and washed three times to give a dark brown liquid (54.00 g)  (Yield 77.82%) .   The product was<br>
identified by ^-NMR, 19F-NMR and 13C-NMR.<br>
Preparative Example 2 Synthesis of 9F-Alc/aCl monomer<br>
Into a 200 mL four-necked flask, 2-chloroacrylic acid (20 g, 0.19 mol), 2- (perfluorobutyl)ethanol (9F-Alc) (59.49 g, 0.23 mol), p-toluene sulfonic acid (1.06 g, 0.0056 mol), t-butyl catechol (0.16 g, 0.001 mol) and cyclohexane (90 g,<br><br>
1.07 mol) were charged. The flask was heated so that the internal temperature of the reactor was 80°C. The dehydration condensation reaction was conducted by using a Dean-Stark method. The reaction was conducted for 16 hours. After the completion of the reaction, a small amount of brown sedimentations in the reaction liquid were filtered off, the water washing was conducted three times. Then, the solvent and excess 9F-Alc were removed by an evaporator to give a dark brown liquid (46.86 g) (Yield: 70.79%). The product was identified by 1H-NMR, 19F-NMR and 13ONMR.<br>
