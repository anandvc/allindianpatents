METHOD AND DEVICE FOR MANDIBULAR ADVANCEMENT<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims priority from Australian Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 2005900090 filed on 10 January 2005, the content of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a dental orthotic and methods of using a dental<br>
orfhotic. In particular the present invention relates to a method and device for retaining<br>
the mandible in protrusive position.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
During normal breathing, air passes, through the nose and past the flexible<br>
structures in the back of the throat such as the soft palate, uvula and tongue. When an<br>
individual is awake, muscles hold the airway open, but during sleep, these muscles<br>
relax and can potentially cause problems. Sleep disordered breathing such as snoring,<br>
upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are<br>
thought to occur when there is at least partial occlusion of the airway, with the tongue<br>
often being associated with the occlusion. During OSA, the tongue is sucked against<br>
the back of the throat, completely blocking the air flow. When oxygen levels in the<br>
brain become low enough, the sleeper partially awakens and the muscles contract<br>
opening the airway again. This cyclic occlusion of the airway can have serious<br>
repercussions, including contributing to cardiovascular diseases potentially leading to<br>
cardiac arrest and death.<br>
There are a number of treatment options available including surgery, nasal<br>
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and the use of orfhotic devices. Orthotic<br>
devices are becoming an increasingly favoured option as they are generally small and<br>
easy to wear and relatively inexpensive. Another benefit of orthotic devices is that the<br>
treatment is reversible and non-invasive.<br>
Mandibular advancement device (MAD) is one type of orthotic device which is<br>
used to hold the mandible in a protrusive position, which has proved effective in the<br>
treatment of sleep disordered breathing. Retaining the mandible in a protruded position<br>
has been found to help control the symptoms of sleep disordered breathing by clearing<br>
the airways and reducing the likelihood of the tongue impacting on breathing.<br><br>
WO 2006/072147	PCT/AU2006/000023<br>
2<br>
Boil and bite MADs are prefabricated and are lined with a soft, thermoplastic<br>
material that is moulded to the patient's teeth in the patient's home. The MAD engages<br>
the mandible mainly at the incisors and therefore applies the force of advancement<br>
across only a couple of teeth. While these MADs are relatively cheap and easy to use,<br>
they have the disadvantage in that they can potentially apply excessive force to the<br>
lower anterior teeth in some patients and this can cause discomfort, movement of the<br>
teeth and problems with the fit of the device over time. Another potential problem is<br>
that they are not adjustable once moulded to the patient, limiting their applicability to a<br>
wider range of patients. Furthermore, some patients may not have healthy gums and<br>
teeth in both the upper and lower jaws upon which to brace the MAD in the mouth.<br>
Another example is a laboratory fabricated MAD which requires the attendance<br>
of a dentist to take mouth impressions which are used to make models of the teeth and<br>
gums. These moulds are then used to make dental overlays to overlay all of the lower<br>
and upper teeth, and protrude the mandible and help to clear the airways. A laboratory<br>
fabricated MAD can also cause excessive force on the teeth, leading to pain and tooth<br>
movement. Moreover, laboratory fabricated MADs can be problematic to customize to<br>
the patient's dental requirements as they require both healthy gums and teeth.<br>
Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles or the like which<br>
has been included in the present specification is solely for the purpose of providing a<br>
context for the present invention. It is not to be taken as an admission that any or all of<br>
these matters form part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the<br>
field relevant to the present invention as it existed before the priority date of each claim<br>
of this application.<br>
Throughout this specification the word "comprise", or variations such as<br>
"comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated<br>
element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of<br>
any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As used herein, the "mandibular surface" is taken to include all things of,<br>
pertaining to or attached to the anterior portion of the lower jaw. Non-limiting<br>
examples of anterior mandibular surfaces include bone, gingiva or gum, teeth,<br>
prosthetics and other fixed or removable appliances.<br>
As used herein, "maxillary surface" is taken to include all things of, pertaining<br>
to or attached to the upper jaw. Non-limiting examples of maxillary surfaces include<br>
bone, gum, teeth, prosthetics or other fixed or removable appliances.<br>
Referring to the drawings, the orthotic device 100 of the embodiment illustrated<br>
in Figure 1 incorporates an extraoral member 105 and an intraoral member 110 adapted<br>
to fit inside the mouth of the patient. The members 105 and 110 are made from<br>
stainless steel. Alternatively, such extraoral and intraoral members can be made from a<br>
rigid thermoplastic. Thermoplastic materials can be softened by heat to allow for<br>
manipulation of their shape, examples of suitable thermoplastic materials include .<br>
acrylic, hard durometer, polypropylene, methyl vinyl acetate, ethyl vinyl acetate,<br>
polyethylene and hard durometer urethane.<br>
A concave anterior maxillary abutment surface 115 is shown mounted to the<br>
member 105 by a threaded bolt 120. As illustrated, the anterior maxillary abutment<br>
surface 115 is slightly angled towards the lip to provide more uniform contact with the<br>
tissue covering the subnasal maxillary bone. The anterior maxillary abutment surface<br>
115 is positioned such that it does not substantially impinge upon or obstruct flow of air<br>
through the nose.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, such an anterior maxillary abutment<br>
surface may be adjustably mounted to the orthotic device by a slide arrangement or any<br>
other means known in the art. In yet. other embodiments, such an anterior maxillary<br>
abutment surface can be permanently affixed to the body of the orthotic.<br><br>
WO 2006/072147	PCT/AU2006/000023<br>
6<br>
In the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 1, the anterior maxillary<br>
abutment surface 115 is made from an elastomeric material that is of a shape to fit<br>
comfortably upon the soft tissue and skin covering the subnasal maxillary bone.<br>
Examples of suitable thermoplastic materials include caprolactone, polycaprolactone,<br>
1,4-dibutanediol polyester, 2-oxepanone or silicone rubber.<br>
The anterior mandibular abutment surface 125 of the embodiment of Figure 1 is<br>
a convex band and is attached to member 110 by member 130. The anterior<br>
mandibular abutment surface 125 pushes on the gingiva covering the mandible. This<br>
arrangement allows the orthotic device 100 to be applied to patients who have lost one<br>
or more of their anterior mandibular teeth. Further, by abutting the gingiva covering<br>
the mandible, the anterior mandibular abutment surface 125 avoids or minimizes the<br>
chance of mandibular teeth being undesirably relocated over time.<br>
In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 1, the member 110<br>
includes a deviation 135 to give the tongue sufficient room for the comfort of the<br>
patient. The intraoral posterior maxillary abutment surfaces 140 and 140' are flat<br>
projections which make contact with the maxillary surface.<br>
The contact between the intraoral posterior maxillary abutment surfaces 140 and<br>
140' and the maxillary surface helps resists rotation of the dental orthotic device 100<br>
produced by the interaction of the anterior mandibular abutment surface 125 and the<br>
anterior maxillary abutment surface 115. The intraoral posterior maxillary abutment<br>
surfaces 140 and 140' are positioned such that they are unlikely to apply sufficient<br>
lateral force to the teeth to cause unwanted displacement of the teeth. The intraoral<br>
posterior maxillary abutment surfaces 140 and 140' are of a shape to comfortably<br>
conform to the patient's posterior maxillary characteristics. The two guide surfaces 150<br>
and 150' are positioned to make loose contact with the maxillary surfaces, in other<br>
embodiments, the intraoral posterior maxillary abutment surfaces may make contact<br>
with the maxillary molars or premolars, to position the orthotic device in the mouth of<br>
the patient.<br>
The degree of protrusion or advancement of the mandible can depend upon<br>
clinical requirements. The relative displacement of the mandible can be seen to have<br>
both side-to-side or forward-to-back components. Protrusion of the mandible carries the<br>
tongue forward so that (particularly in sleep) there is a reduced tendency for the tongue<br>
to impinge on the pharynx.<br>
Referring to the second embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 2, the<br>
orthotic device 200 incorporates a concave anterior maxillary abutment surface 215<br>
mounted via a threaded bolt 220 to the extraoral member 205. The intraoral member<br><br>
WO 2006/072147	PCT/AU2006/000023<br>
7<br>
210 has a member 230 and an anterior mandibular abutment surface 225. The intraoral<br>
posterior maxillary abutment surfaces 240 and 240' are fiat projections. The two guide<br>
surfaces may be positioned to make loose contact with the maxillary surfaces to resist<br>
lateral movement of the orthotic device 200. In yet further embodiments, such guide<br>
 surfaces make loose contact with the maxillary molars or premolars. In other<br>
embodiments, the shape and configuration of such guide surfaces can be adjusted to fit<br>
the patient's requirements.<br>
Referring to the third embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 3, the<br>
orthotic device 300 incorporates a concave anterior maxillary abutment surface 315<br>
 mounted via a threaded bolt 320 to the extraoral member 305. The intraoral member<br>
310 has a member 330, anterior mandibular abutment surface 325 and the two intraoral<br>
posterior maxillary abutment surfaces 340 and 340'. In this embodiment, the guide<br>
surfaces 350 and 350' are positioned to make loose contact with the maxillary surface.<br>
In other embodiments, such guide surfaces make contact with the maxillary molars or<br>
premolars to position and resist lateral movement of the orthotic device 300 in the<br>
mouth of the patient. Member 310 further forms a hole into which the patient's tongue<br>
may extend.<br>
Referring to the fourth embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 4, the<br>
orthotic device 400 incorporates a concave anterior maxillary abutment surface 415<br>
mounted via a threaded bolt 420 to the extraoral member 405. The intraoral member<br>
410 has a member 430, anterior mandibular abutment surface 425 and the two intraoral<br>
posterior maxillary abutment surfaces 440 and 440'. In this embodiment, the guide<br>
surfaces 450 and 450' are connected by a member 460 which is raised in order to give<br>
the tongue sufficient room for the comfort of the patient.<br>
Referring to the fifth embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 5, the<br>
orthotic device 500 incorporates a concave anterior maxillary abutment surface 515<br>
mounted via a sliding arm 520 to the extraoral member 505. In this embodiment, the<br>
length of the arm is adjustable via the action of knob 560. In alternative embodiments,<br>
the knob may be substituted for another means for controlling the position of the<br>
concave anterior maxillary abutment surface. The other means may have facility for<br>
controlling the angle of an associated anterior maxillary abutment surface to suit the<br>
patient's needs and/or preference.<br>
As illustrated, the length of the extraoral member 505 can be adjusted by the<br>
extraoral adjustment means 555. Alternatively, the length of such an extraoral member<br>
can be customized to the patient's needs when, for example, manufacturing the orthotic.<br><br>
WO 2006/072147	PCT/AU2006/000023<br>
8<br>
The extraoral member 505 is connected to the intraoral body portion 565 of the<br>
orfliotic device by member 510. The length of member 510 can be adjusted to suit the<br>
patient's requirement(s). In this embodiment, air holes 570 and 570' are shown passing<br>
through intraoral portion 565 are positioned to improve the flow of air through and<br>
around the orthotic device 500. The incorporation of this feature has advantages for<br>
patients with breathing difficulties who, for example, may have nasal blockages or<br>
congestion.<br>
The anterior mandibular abutment surface 525 is connected to portion 565 by<br>
members 530 and 530'. This variation gives the user's tongue more comfortable stretch<br>
space. In the illustrated embodiment, arms 530 and 530' are permanently affixed to the<br>
body portion 565. Alternatively, such arms may be adjustably mounted by a slide<br>
arrangement or other means known in the art.<br>
As illustrated, the anterior mandibular abutment surface 525 is a convex band<br>
and pushes on the gingiva covering the mandible. In alternative embodiments, the<br>
anterior mandibular abutment surface is appropriately shaped to make contact with at<br>
least a portion of the anterior mandibular surface.<br>
The intraoral posterior maxillary abutment surfaces 540 and 540' are connected<br>
to intraoral body portion 565 by arms 535 and 535'. This arrangement of arms 535 and<br>
535' is advantageous in that it gives the user's tongue more room which may improve<br>
the comfort of the device. As illustrated, the abutment surfaces 540 and 540' are flat<br>
projections which make contact with at least a portion of the maxillary surface. This<br>
contact resists rotation of the orfliotic device 500 produced by the interaction of the<br>
mandibular abutment surface 525 and the anterior maxillary abutment surface 515.<br>
Surfaces 540 and 540' are separated by soft palate abutment surface 550. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, the surface is arch shaped to conform to or support the patient's<br>
soft palate. This arrangement is useful for patients whose soft palate can potentially<br>
collapse during sleep. By also supporting the soft palate, in some situations the<br>
effectiveness of the orthotic device may be improved.<br>
Referring to the sixth embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 6, the<br>
orthotic device 600 incorporates a concave anterior maxillary abutment surface 615<br>
mounted via a sliding arm 620 to the extraoral member 605. In this embodiment, the<br>
length of the arm is adjustable via the action of knob 660. As illustrated, the length of<br>
the extraoral member 605 can be adjusted by the extraoral adjustment means 655.<br>
The extraoral member 605 is connected to the intraoral body portion 665 of the<br>
orthotic device by member 610. In this embodiment, air holes 670 and 670' passing<br>
through intraoral body portion 665 are positioned to improve the flow of air through<br><br>
WO 2006/072147	PCT/AU2006/000023<br>
9<br>
and around the orthotic device. The convex band shaped anterior mandibular abutment<br>
surface 625 is connected to body portion 665 by members 630 and 630'.<br>
The intraoral posterior maxillary abutment surfaces 640 and 640' are connected<br>
to intraoral body portion 665 by arms 635 and 635'. The abutment surfaces 640 and<br>
640' are flat projections which make contact with at least a portion of the maxillary<br>
surface. This contact resists rotation of the orthotic device 600 produced by the<br>
interaction of the mandibular abutment surface 625 and the anterior maxillary abutment<br>
surface 615.<br>
Abutment surfaces 640 and 640' have guide surfaces 650 and 650' respectively,<br>
which are positioned to make contact with the maxillary surfaces and help position the<br>
orthotic in the patient's mouth.<br>
With this embodiment, there is no connecting member directly between the<br>
abutment surfaces 640 and 640'. This arrangement has the advantage that the user's<br>
tongue has more comfortable stretch space and is particularly useful for patients who<br>
do not have problems with the soft palate collapsing during sleep.<br>
Referring to the seventh embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 7A,<br>
the orthotic device 700 incorporates a concave anterior maxillary abutment surface 715<br>
mounted via an adjustable arm 720 to the extraoral member 705. In this embodiment,<br>
