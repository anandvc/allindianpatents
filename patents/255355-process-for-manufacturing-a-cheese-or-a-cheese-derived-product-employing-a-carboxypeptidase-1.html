				<td>CARBOXYPEPTIDASE FOR CHEESE RIPENING<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to cheese ripening.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Flavour of food products is one of the key attributes for the consumer. In<br>
fermented products, e.g. dairy products, flavors are derived from milk components by<br>
enzymatic activities of micro-organisms. In cheese for instance, various flavour<br>
compounds have been identified as being essential and many of them are derived from<br>
casein degradation. Other enzymatic processes, such as lipolysis, are also involved,<br>
most notably in cheese where fungi are involved in the ripening process, e.g.<br>
Camembert and Roquefort cheese. In addition, lactose fermentation might lead to the<br>
flavour compounds such as propionic acid (Smit et al, Food Res. int. (2000) 33, 153-<br>
160).<br>
Proteolysis in cheese during ripening plays a vital role in the development of<br>
texture as well as flavour and has been subject of several reviews (see e.g. McSweeney<br>
&amp; Sousa, Lait (2000) 80, 293-324). Proteolysis contributes to textural changes of the<br>
cheese matrix, due to breakdown of the protein network, decrease in aw,through water<br>
binding by liberated carboxyl and amino groups and increase in pH, which facilitates the<br>
release of sapid compounds during mastication (Sousa et al, Int. Dairy Journal (2001),<br>
11, 327-345). It contributes directly to flavour and to off-flavour (e.g. bitterness) of<br>
cheese through the formation of peptides and free amino acids as well as liberation of<br>
substrates (amino acids) for secondary catabolic changes, i.e. transamination,<br>
deamination, decarboxylation, desulphuration, catabolism of aromatic amino acids and<br>
reactions of amino acids with other compounds. The rate and pattern of proteolysis may<br>
be influenced by location within the cheese.<br>
Cheese ripening is a time-consuming process involving complex and wellbalanced<br>
reactions between glycolysis, proteolysis and lipolysis of the milk components.<br>
In most cheeses, bacterial enzymes play a major role in this process. It is well known<br>
that changing the bacterial enzyme content is cheese directly affects the rate of cheese<br>
ripening and its final flavour (Klein &amp; Lortal, Int. Dairy Journal (1999) 9, 751-762.). A way<br>
to influence cheese ripening is to increase the bacterial enzyme pool in cheese curd by<br>
the addition of whole lactic acid bacteria, unable to grow and produce significant levels<br>
of lactic acid, but still delivering active ripening enzymes during cheese ageing. The<br>
starters are normally weakened and referred to as attenuated.<br>
Since cheese ripening is a time consuming process it is also costly. Cheeses<br>
need to be stored during ripening under precisely defined conditions for temperature and<br>
humidity for weeks to months. The ripening time varies considerably between the<br>
various cheeses, from 3 weeks (e.g. Mozzarella) to more than 2 years (e.g. Parmesan,<br>
.extra mature Cheddar). Any process that would result in acceleration of cheese ripening<br>
is interesting from an economic point of view: the same amount of cheese can be<br>
produced in a shorter time interval.<br>
Proteolysis in cheese is a very complex process, and proteases from various<br>
origins are involved (for review see e.g. Fox &amp; McSweeney, Food Rev. Int (1996) 12,<br>
457-509). Such proteases are the coagulant that was used during cheese manufacture<br>
(e.g. chymosin, pepsin or fungal acid proteinases), milk own proteins (e.g. plasmin), the<br>
proteases provided by the starter bacteria, proteases from non-starter adventitious<br>
microflora, proteases from a second inocculum (in some varieties, e.g. P. roqueforti, <br>
camemberti, Br. Linens], attenuated bacterial cells and exogenous proteases. The<br>
attenuated cells and the exogenous proteases are recent tools in the development of<br>
acceleration of cheese ripening. The generation of free amino acids is an important step<br>
in the acceleration of cheese ripening. Although the free amino acids contribute to the<br>
overall cheese flavour, their contribution is relatively small. The amino acids are the<br>
precursors, which are subsequently converted by the micro-organisms that are present<br>
in the cheese to flavour compounds. Availability of amino acids is therefore important for<br>
cheese flavour formation and thus for cheese ripening.<br>
The main alternative to the use of natural cheese in processed consumer foods<br>
requiring a cheese flavour are high-intensity cheese flavour concentrates such as<br>
enzyme-modified cheese (EMCs), cheese powders and cheese flavours (Kilcawley,<br>
Wilkinson &amp; Fox, Int. Dairy Journal (1998), 8, 1-10). Cheese flavours are not produced<br>
for use in cheese as such but are produced to be applied in other food that<br>
conventionally contains natural cheese. Cheese is traditionally added to products as a<br>
spray dried preparation for flavour, appearance and texture enhancement. The amount<br>
of cheese used varies, and the overall flavour and quality of the product depends on the<br>
type of cheese used. Cheese that has been treated enzymatically to enhance the flavour<br>
or a significant portion of the profile of that cheese is considered to be an EMC and it<br>
provides the food manufacturer with a strong cheese note in a form that is cost effective,<br>
nutritious and natural (Kilcawley, Wilkinson &amp; Fox, Int. Dairy Journal (1998), 8, 1-10).<br>
EMCs have a flavour profile, which may be quite different from that of a natural cheese<br>
and yet on dilution with a suitable bland or nearly bland base, provide the desired<br>
cheesy note in the end product. The basis of EMC technology is the use of specific<br>
enzymes to produce typical cheese flavours from suitable substrates. Proteases, which<br>
term includes both endo-proteases and exo-proteases, are important enzymes in EMC<br>
production. Their role is similar to that in cheese ripening. Proteolysis in EMC is<br>
extensive and produces both high levels of savoury and bitter notes; the latter can be<br>
prevented, removed or masked by either controlled proteolysis, addition of specific<br>
exopeptidases or inclusion of masking agents, e.g. mature cheese or monosodium<br>
glutamate (Wilkinson &amp; Kilcawley, Bulletin of the IDF (2002), 371, 10-15).<br>
Many proteases are involved in the generation of cheese flavours. The<br>
generation of the proper flavour for a cheese (or cheese derived product like EMC)<br>
requires a delicate balance of proteolytic activities from the proteases involved. Any<br>
imbalance will easily lead to flavours that are not wanted, such as bitterness<br>
development. Especially the development of bitterness in cheese (or EMC) has been<br>
well described and documented (see e.g. LeMieux &amp; Simard, Lait (1991) 71, 599-636;<br>
Lemieux &amp; Simard, Lait (1992) 72, 335-382) The development of proteases for cheese<br>
or EMC to enhance ripening processes is therefore a very delicate and complicated<br>
process. Exo-proteases are preferred over endo-proteases because they have a lower<br>
tendency to induce formation of bitterness. Endo-proteases are known to easily<br>
introduce such bitterness and are therefore preferably not used. There is, however, a<br>
clear industrial need for cheese ripening enzymes such as proteases, and over the<br>
years several commercial protease preparation have been introduced into the market.<br>
An overview of available commercial products is given in several papers (Wilkinson, van<br>
den Berg &amp; Law, Bulletin of the IDF (2002) 371, 16-19; Kilcawley, Wilkinson &amp; Fox, Food<br>
Biotechnol (2002) 16, 29-55; Kilcawley, Wilkinson &amp; Fox, Enzyme Microb. Technol.<br>
(2002) 31, 310-320). Examples include enzyme preparations derived from fungal<br>
species (including but not limited to Bioprotease P Conc and Bioprotease A conc from<br>
Quest, The Netherlands, Protease M &amp; Protease A and Acid protease A from Amano,<br>
Promod 215 from Biocatalysts, Sternzyme B502B from Stern, Flavourzyme MG/A from<br>
Novozymes, Denmark) and bacterial species (including but not limited to Protamex and<br>
Neutrase from Novozymes, Denmark, Protease N from Amano, Promod 24P and-24L<br>
from Biocatalysts, Protease B500 from DSM, The Netherlands, and Protease 200L from<br>
Rhodia Foods, France). The proteases vary considerably in composition with respect to<br>
presence of specific proteases and/or the ratio in which these proteases occur in a<br>
specific product The papers by Kilcawley, Wilkinson and Fox, referred to above, clearly<br>
show that most commercial protease products are a mixture of endo- and exo-peptidase<br>
activities. Several products are developed to contain only exo-peptidase activity. For<br>
food applications, these are invariably amino-peptidases, and examples include DBS50<br>
and DBP20 (from Rhodia, France), Corolase LAP (from Rohm, Germany), Flavourzyme<br>
MG/A (from Novozymes, Denmark), Accellerzyme AP (from DSM, The Netherlands) and<br>
Peptidase R (from Amano, Japan). The amino peptidases are developed and selected<br>
for the release amino acids that are important precursors of cheese flavour such as<br>
leucine, phenylalanine and valine. Several patent applications (e.g. WO96/38549)<br>
describe the preparation and use of amino peptidases, free from endo-proteases, which<br>
can be used to accelerate cheese ripening. Although there is a description of the use of<br>
a single wheat carboxy-peptidase to reduce the bitterness of bitter peptides from milk<br>
casein peptides (Umetsu, Matsuoka &amp; Ichishima, J. Agric. Food Chem (1983) 31, 53), there is no description of the use of a protease preparation containing a single<br>
carboxy-peptidase activity that has been useful for the acceleration of cheese ripening.<br>
Commercial proteases preparations containing carboxy-peptidase activity are known<br>
(e.g. FlavorPro 192 from Biocatalysts) but these always contain mixtures of aminopeptidase,<br>
endo-protease and possibly other protease activities in addition to the<br>
carboxypeptidase activity.<br>
Protease addition for cheese ripening can be done in various stages of cheese<br>
preparation. Preferably, the enzymes are added to the cheese milk prior to or together<br>
with the addition of the coagulant (e.g. chymosin). Addition at this point ensures a<br>
homogenous distribution of the enzymes throughout the cheese. Alternatively, the<br>
enzymes can be added in a later stage, e.g. during the salting stage in Cheddar making,<br>
but this introduces the risk of inhomogeneous enzyme distribution in the cheese and<br>
formation of so-called hot spots. For that reason, addition of the enzymes to the cheese<br>
milk is preferred. A disadvantage is that the majority of the enzyme (60-90%) is often not<br>
incorporated in the cheese curd, and is discarded in the whey fraction where it can give<br>
rise to unwanted (proteolysis) that makes the whey less or not suited for further<br>
applications. Especially endo-proteases with significant activity at pH5-7 could cause<br>
such unwanted side-activities, but also amino peptidase that often have optimal activity<br>
in this pH range may give rise to formation of e.g. unwanted flavours. Another potential<br>
problem of especially endo-protease addition to the cheese milk is that they interfere<br>
with the coagulation process, giving rise to a-specific hydrolysis leading to reduction of<br>
cheese yield. Also amino-peptidases can cause yield-losses since they usually are well<br>
active at pH6-7, the usual pH range of cheese making. Proteases that are not or almost<br>
not active at pH values during cheese making, but which become active in the cheese<br>
are preferred because they will not interfere with the cheese making process and will not<br>
cause unwanted reactions in the whey.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
According to the present invention, accelerated cheese ripening can be obtained<br>
by the use of carboxy-peptidases. The carboxy-peptidase preparation should be free<br>
from endo-protease activity, and should be able to at least release amino acids that are<br>
important for cheese flavour formation, such as leucine, phenylaianine, valine and<br>
methionine. The carboxypeptidase is added at activity levels between 1 and 2500<br>
CPG/g substrate (e.g. cheese milk), preferably 1-250 CPG/g substrate or more<br>
preferably 1-25 CPG/g substrate. CPG-units are defined in example 1. Protease activity<br>
is measured by the hydrolysis of a casein (6 g/L assay solution) at pH6.0, 4QC for 1<br>
hour. 1 PU is the amount of enzyme that produces, in one minute, a (TCA-soluble)<br>
hydrolysate, which (280 nm) absorbance is equal to a tyrosin solution of 1 uM). The<br>
carboxypeptidase preparation is defined as free of endo-protease activity when the ratio<br>
of endo-protease activity (PU.) / carboxypeptidase activity (CPG) in the preparation is<br>
less than 0.01, preferably less than 0.001 and most preferably less than 0.0005. The<br>
carboxy-peptidase is preferably a broad spectrum carboxy-peptidase that is able to<br>
release to majority of the natural amino acids from peptides or proteins. Broad spectrum<br>
carboxypeptidase is defined as an enzyme that is able to release at least 80% of the<br>
natural amino acids in amounts detectable by the method as described in example 3 of<br>
this application. Preferably the carboxypeptidase preparation contains a carboxypeptidase<br>
in which 90% of the carboxypeptidase activity is caused by a single enzyme,<br>
measured as described in example 1, but combinations of carboxypeptidases are also<br>
allowed.<br>
We have surprisingly found that the use of a purified carboxy-peptidase C-PD I<br>
(PEPG) from an Aspergillus strain is well able to by its own accelerate cheese ripening.<br>
Examples of suitable Aspergilli are A. niger, A. Oryzae and A. sojae. Preferably CPD 1<br>
from A. niger is used. The enzyme has been described (Dal Degan, Ribadeau-dumas &amp;<br>
Breddam, Appl. Environ. Microbiol (1992) 58, 2144-2152) and sequenced (Svendsen &amp;<br>
Dal Degan, Bioch. Biophys. Acta (1998) 1387, 369-377). The carboxy-peptidase can<br>
also be used to accelerate cheese flavour development in EMCs. Other preferred<br>
applications of the carboxy-peptidase are in the field of flavour development in<br>
fermented foods like fermented sausages and beers in which, similar to the situation in<br>
cheese, availability of free amino acids like valine, leucine, isoleucine and phenylalanine<br>
as well as sulfur containing amino acids like methionine are known to be of particular<br>
importance.<br>

Example 1<br>
Cloning of CPD-I (PEPG)<br>
The amino acid sequence of carboxypeptidase I (PEPG) of A. niger is described<br>
(Svendsen &amp; Dal Degan, Bioch. Biophys. Acta (1998) 1387, 369-377). Degenerate PCR<br>
primers were designed to clone the pepG gene from a genomic library from Aspergillus<br>
niger N400 (CBS 120.49), using methods known to the skilled person in the art. The<br>
gene was fused to the 3' end of the glucoamyiase promotor. Analogous examples of<br>
fusions of structural genes to the glucoamyiase promotor have been described (EP-A-<br>
0420358, EP-A-0463706 and WO99/38956). First the pepG structural gene was PCR<br>
amplified from a genomic fragment containing the gene and purified. Second, the<br>
promotor region of the glaA gene was PCR amplified using , at the 3' end, a primer that<br>
overlaps the 5' end of the pepG structural gene. Third, the two PCR fragments were<br>
fused via fusion PCR with an oligonucleotide primer 5' of the glaA promotor, and an<br>
oligonucleotide overlapping the stopcodon of pepG in the reverse direction. Fourth, the<br>
resulting fusion fragment was cloned in the A niger expression vector pGBTOP7<br>
(WO99/38956), resulting in a fusion plasmid containing the glaA promotor, pepG<br>
structural gene and the glaA terminator. This plasmid was digested with Hindlll and cotransformed<br>
with pGBBAAS-1 digested with Xho I to Aspergillus niger ISO502,<br>
essentially as described in WO 99/38956. Transformants selected for growth on<br>
acetamide plates were analysed using colony PCR to check for the presence of pepG<br>
expression cassette, using known techniques. The gene sequence was determined, and<br>
the genomic DNA sequence, coding sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence<br>
are given as SEQ ID NO.: 1, 2 and 3 respectively. A. niger pepG transformants were<br>
cultivated in shake flask using methods as described previously (WO 99/38956). After<br>
growth for 6 days at 34 °C, supernatants were analysed on activity. Activity of PEPG<br>
was determined by adding 10 μl of the culture supernatant to a 990 ul of a solution<br>
containing 45 mM Na-acetate (pH4.5), 0.95 mM EDTA and 0.2 mM FA-Phe-Ala<br>
(obtained from Bachem). The change in optical density at 337 nm was followed. The<br>
decrease in optical density is a measure for the PEPG activity. One enzyme unit (1<br>
CPG) is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to decrease the optical density at 337<br>
nm by 1 absorbance unit per minute under the test conditions. The transformant<br>
showing the highest CPG value per ml was selected for PEPG expression.<br>
Example 2<br>
Purification of PEPG<br>
PEPG was purified from the culture broth of Aspergillus niger expressing the<br>
enzyme according to the method described (Dal Degan, Ribadeau-dumas &amp; Breddam,<br>
Appl. Environ. Microbiol (1992) 58, 2144-2152) with the exception that the CABSSepharose<br>
step was omitted. The activity of the final substantially purified enzyme was<br>
established to be 150 CPG/ml, using the activity measurement as described in example<br>
1. 'Endo-protease activity was below detection limits (
purification of PEPG were repeated yielding a final preparation containing 650 CPG/ml<br>
carboxy-peptidase activity and 2.25 PU/ml endo-protease activity. The ratio PU/CPG for<br>
the latter preparation was 0.003.<br>
Example 3<br>
Determination of the substrate specificity of PEPG<br>
The substrate specificity of the purified PEPG was determined using substrates<br>
Z-Ala-X, in which Z is benzyioxycarbonyl and X is any of the amino acids (one letter<br>
code) A, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, Y. All substrates were obtained<br>
from Bachem, except when X= Q orT, which substrates were obtained from PEPSCAN<br>
(The Netherlands) The enzyme specificity was determined at pH4.0 and 40 °C in<br>
solutions that contained 3 mM of the peptide substrates. The reaction was started by<br>
addition of the 5 pi enzyme solution ( 440 units/ml) to 95 (μl of the reaction mixtures.<br>
Samples were taken for each substrate immediately at t=0 minutes and spotted on TLCplates<br>
(Merck HPTLC [plates 20X10 Silica gel 60), another sample was taken after 45<br>
minutes incubation and also spotted on the same TLC plate. As a control, the substrate<br>
solutions without the enzyme were spotted on the same TLC plate. The plate was<br>
stained for free amino groups by spraying with a ready to use ninhydrin spray (ACROS).<br>
Enzyme activity was rated from - (no activity), +/- (low activity) to + (little activity) to<br>
+++++ (very high activity). Very high activity (+++++) on a particular substrate is scored<br>
when all the substrate has already been converted at the t=0 sample. Results are as<br>
follows:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
nt: not tested. Ref: data extracted from Dal Degan, Ribadeau-dumas &amp;<br>
Breddam, Appl. Environ. Microbiol (1992) 58, 2144-2152. Numbers indicate kcat/kM<br>
values in min-1 mM-1<br>
The table shows that the cloned and purified PEPG is similar to the one<br>
described by Dal Degan in 1992, but there are some unexpected differences. The<br>
enzyme preferentially liberates the hydrophobic amino acids F, I, L, M and V. The<br>
preference of the cloned gene is, however, different from the one described by Dal<br>
Degan et a/, which has highest preference for I whereas the cloned enzyme shows<br>
highest activity on L, M and V. Also, the purified enzyme is rafher active on K, more<br>
active than e.g. on A and D, which is different from the data described by Dal Degan <br>
a/. Clearly, the carboxy-peptidase is has a very broad substrate specificity and is able to<br>
handle all amino acids except possibly C, which was not tested.<br>
Example 4<br>
Demonstration of accelerated cheese ripening of PEPG in mini cheese (Cheddar type).<br>
Miniature cheeses were produced as described by Shakeel-Ur-Rehman et al.<br>
(Protocol for the manufacture of miniature cheeses in Lait, 78 (1998), 607-620). Raw cows<br>
milk was pasteurized by heating for 30 minutes at 63°C. The pasteurized milk was<br>
transferred to wide mouth plastic centrifuge bottles (200mL per bottle) and cooled to 31 °C.<br>
Subsequently, 0.72 ml of starter culture DS 5LT1 (DSM Gist B.V., Delft, The Netherlands)<br>
was added to each of the 200 ml of pasteurised milk in the centrifuge bottles and the milk<br>
was ripened for 20 minutes. Than, CaCI2 (132 μL of a 1 mol.L"1 solution per 200mL<br>
ripened milk) was added, followed by addition of the coagulant (0.04 IMCU per ml). In case<br>
the experimental involved the use of PEPG, this enzyme was added together with the<br>
coagulant. The milk solutions were held for 40-50 minutes at 31 °C until a coagulum was<br>
formed. The coagulum was cut manually by cutters of stretched wire, spaced 1 cm apart<br>
on a frame. Healing was allowed for 2 minutes followed by gently stirring for 10 minutes.<br>
After that, the temperature was increased gradually to 39°C over 30 minutes under<br>
continuous stirring of the curd / whey mixture. Upon reaching a pH of 6.2 the curd / whey<br>
mixtures were centrifuged at room temperature for 60 minutes at 1,700g. The whey was<br>
drained and the curds were held in a water bath at 36°C. The cheeses were inverted every<br>
15 minutes until the pH had decreased to 5.2-5.3 and were then centrifuged at room<br>
temperature at 1,700gfor 20 minutes. After manufacture the cheese were ripened at 12 °C<br>
and sensory analysis was performed after 3 and 6 weeks of ripening y a minimum panel of<br>
3 people.<br>
Several dosages of PEPG to the cheese milk were used: 0 (=control), 5, 50 and 500<br>
CPG/200 ml cheese milk. The addition of PEPG clearly led to an overall increase in flavour<br>
intensity, leading to a more matured taste as compared to the control cheese. This was<br>
the case at all levels of PEPG addition, even though the lowest level of addition (5<br>
CPG/200 ml) required 6 weeks ripening to give a clear effect. At the other doses (50 and<br>
500 CPG/ml) the effect on taste was already obvious after 3 weeks of ripening. The results<br>
clearly showed that PEPG accelerates cheese flavour development, and that the effect<br>
was dose dependent, and that no off-tastes had developed.<br>
Example 5<br>
Demonstration of accelerated cheese ripening of PEPG in Gouda type cheese.<br>
Gouda cheeses were prepared in 200L vats using the starter culture DelvoTec®<br>
DX31D (obtained from DSM) and MaxirenGOO (obtained from DSM; 55 IMCU/I<br>
milk;DSM) as the coagulant, using a standard Gouda cheese manufacture protocol<br>
known to the person skilled in the art. Raw milk was standardised to a casein to fat ratio<br>
of approximately 0.9 and pasteurised for 15 seconds at 72°C. PEPG was added<br>
immediately prior to addition of Maxiren at a level of 25 CPG/L. A control cheese was<br>
prepared from the same milk batch using the same manufacturing process but without<br>
addition of PEPG. After coagulation the curd was cut and stirred for 20 minutes at a low<br>
speed. Following this half the whey was replaced with warm water (40% of initial<br>
volume) to increase the temperature from 31 °C to 36°C. After this the curd/whey mixture<br>
was stirred, at an increasing speed, for another 30-40 minutes until the curd was firm<br>
enough for drainage. The curd was hooped and left for half an hour before being placed<br>
into 5 kg moulds. The cheeses were pressed, using increasing pressure, for around 4<br>
hours after which the cheeses were left to rest overnight. The following morning they<br>
were placed into brine for 24 hours. After allowing the cheeses to dry, a protective<br>
coating was placed on the cheese and the cheeses started their ripening period. During<br>
this period they were kept at 15°C, relative humidity of approximately 80%. The cheeses<br>
were regularly turned and coated during the ripening period. Cheeses were<br>
organoleptically assessed after 6 weeks and 3 months of ripening by using a trained<br>
panel consisting of a minimum number of 8 people. After 6 weeks, the cheese<br>
containing PEPG received significantly higher scores for sweetness as compared to the<br>
control cheese. After 3 months of ripening, the cheese containing PEPG was clearly<br>
different from the control cheese, showing significantly higher flavour (and also clearly<br>
different creaminess.. The cheese flavour of the cheese containing PEPG was pleasant<br>
and more mature, as compared to the control cheese. The experiment clearly showed<br>
that PEPG accelerates the cheese flavour development and that no off-tastes<br>
developed.<br>
Example 6<br>
Demonstration of the pH profile of PEPG<br>
The enzyme reaction was determined in buffers of various pH. The buffer at pH2,3 and<br>
4 contained 0.1M sodium phosphate, 0.05M citric acid and 0.05M acetic acid; the buffer<br>
at pH4,5 and 6 contained 0.05 M sodium phosphate, 0.05M acetic acid, and 0.05M Tris.<br>
The pH was adjusted to the correct value using 4M HCI or 4M NaOH. Substrate solution<br>
contained 8mM FA-Phe-Ala in methanol. The assay solution contained 965 ul buffer, 25<br>
μ| substrate solution and 10 μl purified enzyme. Reactions were performed at 25 CC, and<br>
change of absorption at 337 nm was followed for 10 minutes. The relative activity was<br>
calculated fomrt he change in absorbance. The results are the average of two separate<br>
measurements, except for the measurement at pH is 4, which was performed in dupio in<br>
two different buffers. The results are given in Figure 1.<br>
The profile shows of Figure 1 that the enzyme has a pH optimum of pH 4. The<br>
optimum is clearly higher than pH optimum of 3.1-3.4 for the carboxy peptidase<br>
described by Dal Degan (Dal Degan, Ribadeau-dumas &amp; Breddam, Appl. Environ.<br>
Microbiol (1992) 58, 2144-2152 and references sited therein).<br>
Example 7<br>
Use of carboxypeptidase for Enzyme modified cheese preparation.<br>
A cheese paste was prepared from a mixture of 90% 5 weeks old Gouda cheese<br>
and 10% old Gouda cheese, basically as described by Smit et al.( (1995). Ch-easy<br>
model: a cheese-based model to study cheese ripening. In P. Etievant, Bioflavours. (pp.<br>
185-190).<br>
Preparation of EMC using carboxypeptidase<br>
Young Gouda cheese (approximately 6 weeks old) was purchased from a local<br>
supermarket, and was finely grated. MilliQ-water was added to the grated cheese to<br>
reach a final water content of approximately 50% and, after mixing, the cheese paste<br>
was divided in portions of 200 grams in separate containers. The mixture was heated<br>
during 5 minutes at 80 °C to eliminate microbial growth. One of the containers was<br>
analyzed to verify elimination of microbial growth by plate count analysis for bacteria,<br>
yeasts and moulds. The other containers were stored at 4 °C for further use. When<br>
absence of microbial growth was confirmed by the plate count analysis, the prepared<br>
cheese pastes in the remaining containers were used.<br>
Prior to making additions, the cheese paste was heated to 55 °C and gently<br>
cooled to 30 °C. PEPG solutions were prepared in MilliQ water containing 1.6, 0.16 and<br>
0.016 CPG/ml. Subsequently, 2 ml of each PEPG solution was added to individual<br>
containers containing 200g cheese paste, and the mixture was mixed by stirring; the<br>
control paste contained no PEPG but only milliQ The containers were than stored at<br>
17 °C. After 4 weeks the flavour of the pastes was organoleptically assessed by a<br>
sensory panel. Increasing PEPG concentrations resulted in clearly increasing intensity of<br>
flavour of the cheese pastes. The PEPG is apparently useful in EMC processes to<br>
generate cheese flavour.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
