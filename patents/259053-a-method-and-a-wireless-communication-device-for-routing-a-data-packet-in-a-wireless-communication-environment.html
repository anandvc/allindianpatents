WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
PACKET ROUTING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS<br>
ENVIRONMENT<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/718,363, filed 09/19/2005, and entitled "METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR THE UTILIZATION OF MOBILE NODES FOR STATE TRANSFER AS PART OF A HANDOFF OPERATION"; and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Attorney Serial No. 60/796,653, filed on May 1,2006, and entitled "A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MOBILITY AWARE RESOURCE CONTROL" (Park).<br>
BACKGROUND <br>
I.        Field<br>
[0002]	The invention relates generally to communications systems, and more<br>
particularly to providing refined quality of service with respect to one or more traffic flows associated with a terminal.<br>
n.      Background<br>
[0003]	Communication networks, such as wireless communication networks,<br>
broadband networks, and any other suitable networks are utilized in connection with transferring data, wherein data can include word processing files, streaming video, multimedia files, voice data, and/or the like. Providing appropriate quality of service (QoS) to certain subscribers can be important for retaining customer satisfaction as well as optimizing resources associated with one or more network links. In wireless networks, however, providing appropriate QoS can be difficult, as QoS support must be considered in connection with units that are transitioning between different access nodes (e.g., base stations, access routers, or access points). Thus, providing appropriate QoS treatment to a wireless terminal is a nontrivial case.<br>
[0004]	In a typical wireless communications network, a set of geographically<br>
dispersed access nodes (e.g., base stations) provide wireless access to a communications infrastructure for a plurality of end nodes (e.g., wireless terminals). Cellular network systems have traditionally been primarily based on circuit-switch technology, but a variety of emerging cellular network systems are more heavily based on packet-<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
switched technology (e.g., the Internet Protocol (IP) suite). In such networks, flexible<br>
QoS differentiation mechanisms are needed to effectively support a variety of different<br>
applications (e.g., telephony, text messaging, streaming audio/video, web browsing, file<br>
transfer,...). QoS mechanisms designed primarily for use in fixed, hard-wired, packet-<br>
switched network infrastructures are not well suited for use in a cellular network. In<br>
particular, aspects such as mobility of subscriber access devices, the potentially<br>
constrained nature of a wireless access link, and differences in network architecture<br>
impede or preclude use of existing resource control protocols in wireless packet-<br>
switched networks.	[<br>
[0005]            In connection with requesting QoS support with respect to a particular<br>
subscriber, conventional networks utilize a centralized entity or a subscriber with<br>
respect to such requests. For instance, if a subscriber needs certain QoS support, such<br>
subscriber requests such support from a provider of QoS support. These conventional<br>
methods for requesting and receiving QoS support are inflexible and inefficient.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]	The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic<br>
understanding of some aspects of the claimed subject matter. This summary is not an<br>
extensive overview, and is not intended to identify key/critical elements or to delineate<br>
the scope of the claimed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in<br>
a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.<br>
[0007]	The claimed subject matter relates to routing of packets in a wireless<br>
communications environment. For example, a data packet can be received, wherein<br>
such data packet should be provided to a particular point of attachment from amongst a<br>
plurality of points of attachment with respect to a wireless terminal. A creator of such<br>
packet may not be aware of an identity or address of the particular point of attachment,<br>
however, and can accordingly direct the data packet to a disparate entity or address,<br>
such as a one-hop multicast address, a home agent, and/or the like. The data packet can<br>
men be encapsulated by, for instance, a wireless terminal or a home agent, within an<br>
LLC frame, and within the frame an identity of the particular point of attachment can be<br>
included. The LLC can then be routed to the primary point of attachment.<br>
[0008]	For example, a host device may only be aware of a single interface (or<br>
link) to a network, even though a tenninal associated therewith may be aware of multiple links (possible to different access nodes). In such a case, packets sent by the<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
host may be directed to a particular interface (from the host perspective) but benefit<br>
from being directed to a particular access node from amongst a plurality of access<br>
nodes. In a specific example, packets intended for a first hop router from a host<br>
perspective (e.g., packets sent to a one-hop IP multicast address) can be directed to the<br>
particular link or the particular access node (base station).<br>
[0009]	In accordance with an aspect, a method for routing a data packet in a<br>
cellular communications environment can comprise receiving a data packet and determining that the data packet should be provided to a particular point of attachment from amongst a plurality of available points of attachment with respect to a wireless terminal in the cellular communications environment. For example, the determination can be made based at least in part upon content of the data packet. The method can additionally comprise encapsulating the data packet in an LLC frame and indicating that the LLC frame should be directed towards a particular point of attachment. Additionally, a wireless communications device described herein can comprise means for receiving a data packet, wherein the data packet is associated with a cellular network. The wireless communications device can also include means for analyzing content of the data packet in connection with ascertaining that the data packet should be provided to a particular point of attachment from amongst a plurality of points:of attachment with respect to a wireless terminal and means for encapsulating the data packet in an LLC frame.<br>
[0010]	In accordance with another aspect, a processor can be configured to<br>
execute instructions for receiving a data packet in a cellular communications environment and detennining that the data packet should be provided to a certain point of attachment from amongst a plurality of available points of attachment with respect to a wireless terminal, wherein the determination is made based at least in part upon content of the received data packet The processor can be further configured to execute instructions for encapsulating the data packet in an LLC frame and indicating that the LLC frame should be directed towards the certain point of attachment. Moreover, a machine-readable medium is disclosed below, where in the machine-readable medium can have machine-executable instructions stored thereon for receiving a data packet in a cellular network, encapsulating the data packet in an LLC frame, and analyzing content of the data packet. The machine-executable instructions can further include identifying a primary point of attachment from amongst a plurality of available points of attachment<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036S84<br>
with respect to a wireless terminal, wherein the identification is based at least in part upon the analysis.<br>
[0011]	In accordance with yet another aspect, a wireless communications<br>
apparatus can comprise a memory that retains instructions for encapsulating a received<br>
data packet in an LLC frame, wherein the received data packet is associated with a<br>
cellular communications network. The memory can retain further instructions for<br>
identifying within the packet a particular point of attachment to which the data packet is<br>
to be forwarded, the particular point of attachment is identified from amongst a plurality<br>
of points of attachment associated with a wireless terminal, wherein the identification is<br>
based at least in part upon content of the data packet. The wireless communications<br>
apparatus can also include a processor mat executes the instructions.<br>
[0012]	In accordance with still another aspect, a method, for routing packets in a<br>
wireless communications environment can comprise receiving a data packet that is addressed to a node other than an access node at the access node, determining that the data packet is intended for the access node by analyzing the data packet, and. executing instructions at the access node based at least in part upon contents of the data packet. Additionally, a communications device is described herein, wherein the communications device can comprise means for receiving a data packet, means for determining that the data packet is addressed to a network entity that is not a receiving entity, means for determining that the data packet is intended for the receiving entity, and means for executing instructions at the receiving entity based at least in part upon contents of the received data packet<br>
[0013]	In accordance with yet another aspect, a processor can be configured to<br>
execute instructions for determining that a received data packet is addressed to a first<br>
network entity, determining that the received data packet is intended for a second<br>
network entity, and executing instructions based at least in part upon contents of the<br>
received data packet at the second network entity. Moreover, a machine-readable<br>
medium can have machine-executable instructions stored thereon for receiving a data<br>
packet that is addressed to a wireless terminal at an access node, determining that the<br>
data packet is intended for the access node by analyzing the data packet, and executing<br>
instructions at the access node based at least in part upon contents of the data packet.<br>
[0014]	In still yet another aspect, a communications apparatus can comprise a<br>
memory that retains instructions for intercepting a data packet intended for a different<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
wireless communications network entity. The communications apparatus can also include a processor that executes the instructions.<br>
[0015]	To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain<br>
illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the claimed subject matter may be employed and the claimed subject matter is intended to include all such aspects and then-equivalents. Other advantages and novel features may become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0043]	The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the<br>
drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout.<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are<br>
set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It<br>
may be evident, however, that such subject matter may be practiced without these<br>
specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in<br>
block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.<br>
[0044]	Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a<br>
terminal. A terminal can also be called a system, a user device, a subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile device, remote station, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, user agent, or user equipment. A user device can be a cellular telephone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a PDA, a handheld device having wireless connection capability, a module within a terminal, or other processing device connected to a wireless modem.<br>
[0045]	Moreover, aspects of the claimed subject matter may be implemented as<br>
a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof to control a computer or computing components to implement various.aspects of the claimed subject matter. The term "article of manufacture" as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media. For example, computer readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices (e.g.t hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strips...), optical disks (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD)...), smart cards, and flash memory devices (e.g., card, stick, key drive...). Additionally it should be appreciated that a carrier wave can be employed to carry computer-readable electronic data such as those used in transmitting and receiving voice mail or in accessing a network such as a cellular network. Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope or spirit of what is described herein.<br>
[0046]	Referring now to Fig. 1, a system 100 that facilitates provision of<br>
appropriate QoS treatment to a subscriber is illustrated. As used herein, the term "subscriber" is intended to encompass, for example, an individual, a billable entity, and/or a communications apparatus. System 100 enables network entities, such as application servers, to request QoS support/management on behalf of a subscriber, and additionally enables a host associated with the subscriber to request QoS support and/or<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
management. Thus, requests for QoS support and/or management can originate from network infrastructure or a host that is requesting access to the network. System 100 includes a provider 102, which can provide QoS support to a subscriber 104 that is communicatively coupled thereto. Provider 102 and subscriber 104 can communicate by way of a link, which can be a wireless link, a wirelined link, and/or a combination thereof (e.g., a mobile device that communicates with a router by way of WiFi, and the router communicates with a provider).<br>
[0047]	In an example, subscriber 104 may be an individual that is associated<br>
with a subscription for certain services of a network. In a different embodiment, subscriber 104 can be a mobile handset, a telephone that is coupled to a router, etc. Provider 102, for instance, can be a base station, a router, a modem, or any other network device that is employed to provide data (messages, packets, etc.) to subscriber 104. In an example, provider 102 and subscriber 104 can communicate by way of FLASH OFDM. It is understood, however, that any suitable data transmission protocols are contemplated by the inventors and are intended to fall under the scope of the hereto-appended claims.<br>
[0048]	System 100 can also include a first network entity 106, which, for<br>
instance, can be an application server that can provide certain applications, or application service(s), to subscriber 104 by way of provider 102. For example, first network entity 106 can be a games server that is utilized to provide certain gaming data to subscriber 104 by way of provider 102. System 100 can also include a second network entity 108. For example, second network entity 108 can be a streaming media server that provides access to audio and/or video content to subscriber 104. It is understood, however, that first and second entities 106 and 108 can be any suitable entities that reside within a network.   -<br>
[0049]	Pursuant to an example, first network entity 106 can send a request for<br>
QoS resources to provider 102, wherein such request relates to QoS with respect to subscriber 104. In other words, first network entity 106 can make a QoS resource request on behalf of subscriber 104. Provider 102 can thereafter determine, for example, whether subscriber 104 is authorized with respect to QoS parameters indicated within the request. Provider 102 can further determine, for example, whether first network entity 106 is authorized to make the particular QoS resource request on behalf of the subscriber 104. If authorization checks are passed, then provider 102 can be employed to provide appropriate QoS to traffic flows that are delivered to subscriber<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
104 (wherein traffic flow can be defined as related packets of data as indicated within packet headers).<br>
[0050]	Second network entity 108 can additionally send a request for particular<br>
QoS resources to provider 102 on behalf of subscriber 102. For instance, second<br>
network entity 108 may be employed to provide data to subscriber 104 by way of<br>
provider 102, wherein such data should be associated with particular QoS parameters<br>
(e.g., latency, minimum data rate, maximum data rate,...). Thus, provider 102 can<br>
receive requests from separate network entities on behalf of a subscriber. For instance,<br>
such requests can be received and serviced at substantially similar times Csuch as when a<br>
user is undertaking a voice call and downloading data from the Internet). Additionally,<br>
while not shown, subscriber 104 can be associated with a host that requests QoS support<br>
and/or undertakes QoS management on behalf of subscriber 104 by delivering a request<br>
to provider 102. Such request can be provided and/or services at a substantially similar<br>
time as other requests (e.g., from first and/or second network entity 106 and 108).<br>
[0051]	The above-described flexibility in requesting QoS support can be<br>
enabled through one or more protocols. For instance, a substantially similar protocol can be utilized by first and second network entities 106 and 108 as is used by a host associated with subscriber 104. The protocol can include message formats that can be utilized by internal network entities as well as hosts on a periphery of a network (and understood by provider 102). One example protocol that can be employed is a MARC protocol, which has been designed to accommodate subscriber mobility, such as when subscriber 104 alters points of attachment within a network. The MARC protocol defines various messaging formats that facilitate subscriber mobility, for example, in an packet-switched mobile environment. Each message/request can include a common message header followed by a variable number of typed objects, where presence, order, and number of typed objects is based at least in part upon message type (as identified in the message header). Each typed object can include a common object header followed by a variable number of object specific fields. Various message types can be utilized, including an add request message, which is an example of what is sent to provider 102 with respect to requesting particular QoS treatment for a traffic flow to and/or from subscriber 104. Additionally, a modify request message can relate to modifying existing QoS treatment with respect to one or more traffic flows associated with subscriber, and a delete request message can relate to deleting existing QoS treatments. QoS treatments encompass particular services as well as filter rules to identify data<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
packets subject to certain services. Below is an example of an add request in accordance with a protocol that may be utilized in connection with system 100.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0052]	In this example, an "INTEGRITY" object is an object that facilitates<br>
ensuring integrity of the add request. An "INTEGRITY" object can include a<br>
timestamp, an index that identifies a security attribute for validation of message<br>
integrity, and an integrity check value, which can enable validation of message integrity.<br>
A "REQ_ID" object is a requester identifier, which can include an IP address of a<br>
requester. A 'TROV_ID" object is a provider identifier, which can include an IP<br>
address of a provider. A "SUB_ID" object is a subscriber identifier object, which can<br>
include an IP address of a subscriber. An SS_ID object is a subscriber service identifier<br>
object, which can identify one of several subscriber services. The "Addition(s)" fields<br>
relate to particular services or filter rules that are requested by the requester. For<br>
instance, the above add message can describe that filter rules and service class instances<br>
are desirably added, and such filter rules and service class instances can be specifically<br>
provided in the add message through use of an "SCI Object" (service class object) and<br>
"FR Objecf' (filter rule object). An "SCI Object" can include a service class identifier<br>
and an amount of time that the service class should be maintained by the provider in the<br>
absence of being refreshed. An "FR Object" can include an identifier of a particular<br>
filter rule, a priority to be associated with the rule, and various match criteria.<br>
[0053]	Turning now to Fig. 2, a flexible system 200 that enables request of QoS<br>
resources and/or request for QoS management on behalf of a subscriber to occur from multiple, separate entities. System 200 includes provider 102, which, as described above, may be a base station in a wireless communications environment. Additionally, provider 102 can be router, a modem, or any other suitable access node within a<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
wireless or wirelined network. System 200 can also include a network entity 202, such as an application server, that creates a QoS resource request and sends it to provider 102, wherein the request pertains to a subscriber 204. In the example system 200, subscriber 204 is encapsulated with and/or behind a host 206, which interfaces to a network by way of provider 102. For example, subscriber 204 may be a PCMCIA card or other suitable card, a communications device coupled to a computer, or any other suitable device, while host 206 may be a computer, a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant, etc.<br>
[0054]	Host 206, like network entity 202, can create a request for QoS resources<br>
and/or QoS management and provide such request to provider 102. Therefore, different logical entities can create a request on behalf of subscriber 204 with respect to QoS. Additionally, such entities (e.g., network entity 202 and host 206) can reside on different portions with respect to a network. In other words, network entity 202 can reside within a network infrastructure while host 206 can reside on a "subscriber side" of an access link to/from a network. As described above, host 206 can communicate with provider 102 by way of a wireless link, for instance. Additionally, a protocol utilized by host 206 to provide the QoS request to provider 102 can be substantially similar to a protocol utilized to relay a request by network entity 202. In different situations it may be desirable to allow different entities to request QoS support for subscriber 204, and system 200 provides such flexibility, as a request can for QoS support/management on behalf of subscriber 204 can initiate from one or more network entities and/or a host.<br>
[0055]	Now referring to Fig. 3, an example system 300 that illustrates<br>
requesting and provisioning of QoS resources is illustrated. System 300 includes a base station 302, which is utilized in connection with providing network services to a subscriber 304. In wireless environments, one or more base stations are utilized to provide geographic regions of coverage to one or more wireless communication devices. Typically, base stations are arranged such that a large, continuous geographic region is provided with wireless network coverage. Base station 302 includes a transmitter and receiver, for instance, to enable base station 302 to provide subscriber 304 with data and receive data from subscriber 304. Base station 302 acts as an access node to a network. Subscriber 304 is associated with a host device 306, which may be a mobile device, a personal computer, or other suitable host device.<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br><br>
[0056]	System 300 additionally includes multiple application servers 308-312<br>
that can, e.g., if associated with a subscription of the subscriber 304, be utilized in connection with providing certain services to subscriber 304. In a detailed example, application server 308 may be a gaming server, thereby providing subscriber 304 with data relating to one or more video games. Application server 310 may be associated with voice calls, and application server 312 can be a web server, for instance. To optimize receipt and/or delivery of data by way of application servers 308-312 while not wasting network resources, QoS parameters relating to data provided between base station 302 and subscriber 304 should be tightly controlled However, different applications (provided by application servers 308-312) should be associated with different QoS parameters. For example, voice data does not need a substantial amount of bandwidth, but latency should be low. In another example, gaming data may utilize three traffic flows operating in parallel to enable appropriate play of the game. In still another example, downloading a file may not require low latency but may need substantial bandwidth to receive a file in a timely manner. Thus, each of the application servers 308-312 may provide requests relating to particular QoS parameters that should exist between base station 302 and subscriber 304. Base station 302 can thereafter be employed to provide requested QoS treatment to traffic flows that are interchanged between base station 302 and subscriber 304 (if subscriber 304 is authorized for such services and/or QoS).<br>
[0057]	Moreover, host 306 can detect that subscriber 304 is not receiving<br>
appropriate QoS treatment with respect to one or more data flows given current state of<br>
subscriber 304. Additionally or alternatively, subscriber 304 can detect incorrect<br>
treatment of data flows and provide host 306 with an indication that QoS treatment with<br>
respect to one or more data flows should be updated. Host 306 can then create such<br>
request and then be utilized in connection with relaying the request to base station 302.<br>
In another example, host 306 can generate QoS requests based upon requirements of<br>
applications running on host 306. In such a case, an application running on host 306<br>
can send requests by way of an application programming interface (API).<br>
[0058]	Base station 302 can thereafter provide appropriate QoS treatment to<br>
subscriber 304 according to contents of the request. Thus, as can be discerned, multiple network entities and/or a host can request QoS support and/or management on behalf of a subscriber, and base station 302 can receive and service such requests. For instance,<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
base station 302 can service requests simultaneously (e.g., provide appropriate QoS<br>
treatment to multiple traffic flows based upon multiple requests from several entities).<br>
[0059]	Referring to Figs. 4-5, methodologies relating to communications in a<br>
network environment are illustrated. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance with one or more embodiments, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be utilized to implement a methodology in accordance with the claimed subject matter.<br>
[0060]	Turning specifically to Fig. 4, a methodology 400 for providing QoS for<br>
a subscriber based upon one or more requests made by multiple entities is illustrated. The methodology 400 begins at 402, and at 404 a first request is received from a first requester, wherein the first request pertains to QoS with respect to a subscriber. For instance, the first requester can be an entity within a network infrastructure, such as an application server. In another example, the first requester can be a subscriber, a host, another application server, or any other suitable network entity. The QoS request can relate to one or more traffic flows to and/or from the aforementioned subscriber. At 406, a second request is received from a second requester relating to QoS with respect to the subscriber, wherein the request is generated on behalf of such subscriber. Again, the requester can be an application server or other suitable entity within a network infrastructure, or can be a subscriber-side device, such as a personal computer, a mobile handset, etc. In an example, the request provided by the first requester and the request provided by the second requester can be associated with a substantially similar protocol (e.g., MARC).<br>
[0061]	At 408, QoS is provided with respect to the subscriber based at least in<br>
part upon the first and second requests. For example, the first and second requests can<br>
be delivered to a provider, such as a base station. The provider can then provide the<br>
subscriber with QoS parameters defined within the request (whether such parameters are<br>
strictly defined or relative). The methodology 400 then completes at 410.<br>
[0062]	With reference to Fig. 5, a methodology 500 for receiving QoS treatment<br>
based at least in part upon one or more requests for QoS support/management is<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
illustrated. The methodology 500 starts at 502, and at 504 a subscriber is communicatively coupled to a QoS provider. For instance, the subscriber and provider can be communicatively coupled by way of a wireless link (e.g., within a FLASH OFDM system). In another example, the coupling can be wired in nature, such as through Ethernet cable or other suitable coaxial cable, a digital subscriber line, or any other suitable cable. At 506, QoS treatment is received with respect to at least one traffic flow that is associated with the subscriber, wherein the treatment is provided in response to a request that is initiated by a first requester. The requester can be a host, an infrastructure device such as an application server, and/or the like. At 508, additional QoS treatment is received with respect to at least one traffic flow associated with the subscriber, wherein the additional QoS treatment is provided in response to a request that is initiated by a second requester. Again, such requester can be a host, an application server, an advertising server, etc. Thus, QoS treatment is provided to a subscriber based at least in part upon separate requests for such treatment, wherein the separate requests are provided by different entities. The methodology 500 then completes at 510.<br>
[0063]	Turning now to Figs. 6-7 collectively, systems are provided that relate to<br>
provision of particular QoS treatment with respect to a subscriber. The systems are represented as a series of interrelated functional blocks, which can represent functions implemented by a processor, software, hardware, firmware, or any suitable combination thereof. Referring specifically to Fig. 6, a system 600 that facilitates provision of QoS treatment based upon multiple requests on behalf of a subscriber is illustrated. In an example, a provider, such as a base station, can comprise system 600. System 600 includes logical module(s) for receiving a first request from a first requester 602, wherein such request can be made on behalf of a subscriber with respect to QoS support for the subscriber (e.g., the request relates to QoS treatment provided to incoming/outgoing data from the subscriber). Logical module(s) 602 can include, for instance, an antenna, a network port, a processor, memory, software, hardware, firmware, and/or any other suitable modules that may be utilized in connection with receiving the first request. System 600 additionally includes logical module(s) for receiving a second request relating to QoS from a second requester 604, wherein the second request is made on behalf of the subscriber. For example, the requester can be an application server, a host associated with the subscriber, etc. Module(s) 604, like<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
logical module(s) 602, can include an antenna, a network port, a receiver chain, and/or the like.<br>
[0064]	System 600 can additionally include logical module(s) for<br>
simultaneously controlling QoS with respect to a subscriber as a function of the first and second request 606. The terms "providing QoS", "support QoS", "managing QoS", and the like are intended to encompass traffic conditioning, including metering, marking, policing, queue management, scheduling, ARQ, etc. Modules) 606 can include a processor, memory, a scheduling application that aids in scheduling data over a link, and the like. Logical module(s) 606 can also provide QoS support to the subscriber based upon multiple other requests. Moreover, module(s) 606 can be configured to provide QoS support with respect to multiple requests made by multiple requesters simultaneously.<br>
[0065]	Now turning to Fig. 7, a system 700 for receiving QoS treatment from a<br>
provider is illustrated. For instance, a terminal (end node) can comprise system 700.<br>
System 700 includes logical module(s) for receiving QoS treatment with respect to a<br>
first traffic flow, wherein such module(s) can include an antenna, software/hardware<br>
that enables a link to be created between an access node, e.g., base station, and a<br>
subscriber device, e.g., terminal. Additionally, the first traffic flow can relate to a<br>
request for QoS support made by a first requester. System 700 additionally includes<br>
logical module(s) for simultaneously receiving QoS treatment with respect to a second<br>
traffic flow, wherein the second traffic flow can be associated with a request for QoS<br>
support made by a second requester. The module(s) 704 can include an antenna, a<br>
processor, memory, hardware, software, firmware, and/or the like.<br>
[0066]	Referring now to Fig. 8, a system 800 that aids in mobility management<br>
within a communications network is illustrated. While system 800 is shown as including various modules or entities, it is understood that in some aspects a subset of such entities can be utilized to perform functionality as described herein. System 800 includes an access node 802, which, for instance, can be a base station. Access node 802 is communicatively coupled to a terminal 804, which in turn is associated with a host 806. Terminal, for instance, can be a processor, PCMCIA card, and/or memory card, and host 806 can be a device that includes the processor or memory card. In another example, terminal 804 and host 806 can be separate entities, such as a computer and a peripheral device, e.g., desktop modem. It is also to be understood that terminal 804 is communicatively coupled to access node 802 only while terminal 804 is within a<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br><br>
coverage area of access node 802. For instance, if terminal 804 were to be<br>
geographically repositioned, such terminal 804 could alter points of attachment to a<br>
network (e.g., communicatively couple to a disparate access node). Additionally, while<br>
not shown, terminal 804 can be communicatively coupled to more than one access node<br>
during a single instance in time, wherein one of such nodes is labeled as a primary node.<br>
[0067]	System 800 can additionally include a home agent (HA) 808, which can<br>
be employed to track where in a network terminal 804 resides, e.g., to support forwarding of packets to the terminal 804 and/or the host 806 by way of the current point of attachment. For example, if terminal 804 alters a point of attachment, home agent 808 (through various messaging) can be made aware of such change in point of attachment. Home agent 808 can be communicatively coupled to access node 802, either by direct connection or through one or more other network entities. System 800 can also include a network entity 810 that may desirably provide data or services to terminal 804 and/or host 806. For example, network entity 810 can be an application server, such as a gaming server, that desirably provides particular traffic flows to terminal 804 by way of access node 802.<br>
[0068]	The system 800 can employ various mechanisms in connection with<br>
providing data to access node 802, wherein such access node 802 is the point of attachment at the IP layer with respect to terminal 804. For instance, if an address (e.g., IP address) of access node 802 is known (e.g., by network entity 810), then data can be provided directly to access node 802 by way of such address. In other words, it can be known that access node 802 is a point of attachment for terminal 804 (e.g., one of several points of attachment for terminal 804). If address of access node 802 is known, then data packets intended for terminal 804 or provided by terminal 804 can be directed to an address associated with access node 802. Additionally, packets, e.g., control signaling and/or messages, pertaining to terminal 804 and/or host 806 can be directed to an address associated with access node 802.<br>
[0069]	Often, however, as terminal 804 is mobile within a network, point of<br>
attachments can change. Thus, network entities may not be aware of which access node is a current point of attachment for terminal 804, and thus may be unaware a specific address. Additionally, host 806 may wish to relay data and/or signaling to a particular entity but may not have knowledge of which access node is the current point of attachment (or a current primary point of attachment), hi one example, access node 802 can intercept messages that are addressed to different network entities (but in actuality<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
are intended for access node 802). In an example, network entity 810 may wish to provide a QoS request to a point of attachment associated with tenninal 804, but may not be aware that access node 802 is such point of attachment. Accordingly, network entity 810 can, for instance, access home agent 808 to determine which access node is currently associated with terminal 804.<br>
[0070]	Alternatively, network entity 810 can direct, e.g., address, a message to<br>
terminal 804 (or host 806) and provide an indication in the message, e.g., setting one or more header fields to a predetermined value such as a particular port number, that while the message is directed to terminal 804 (or host 806) it is actually intended for an access node that is the point of attachment for terminal 804. la some embodiments the indication includes use of a router alert option in the IP header. The indication can be a message that may be routed and/or forwarded toward terminal 804 by way of access node 802 using a variety of techniques. The path taken by the message to access node 802 can include one or more intermediate nodes, e.g., home agent 808. When access node 802 receives the message, access node 802 can analyze the message and determine, e.g., based on inspection of one or more header fields, that the message (e.g., packet), while addressed to terminal 804 (or host 806), is in actuality intended for access node 802. Access node 802 can then perform operations (or determine whether to perform operations) based at least in part upon contents of the received message. Additionally, access node 802 can create a message informing network entity 810 that access node 802 is, for instance, a primary point of attachment with respect to terminal 804, where such message can inform network entity 810 of an address associated with access node 802 to enable subsequent message exchanges without the need to intercept messages directed to the terminal 806.<br>
[0071]	In another example, host 806 (or another entity on a subscriber-side of a<br>
network link) can desirably provide a message to access node 802, but may not be aware of an address of such access node. In another example, host 806 may be associated with wireless links between several access nodes, and may desirably provide a message to one of such access nodes. Accordingly, host 806 can address a message to network entity 810, indicating within such message that, in actuality, the message is intended to be received and analyzed by access node 802. Additionally or alternatively, terminal 804 can intercept the message, encapsulate such message within a Logical Link Control (LLC) frame (indicating that the message is intended for the base station).<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
[0072]	In an example, host 806 may desirably request particular QoS support<br>
with respect to services provided by network entity 810. Accordingly, host 806 can<br>
create a message addressed to network entity 810, and can indicate within the message<br>
that it is intended for access node 802 (even though the message is addressed to network<br>
entity 810). Example manners of indicating that a message is intended for access node<br>
802 are described above (e.g., router alert within an IP header). One-hop multicasting<br>
can also be employed in connection with providing a message to an appropriate point of<br>
attachment, wherein such multicasting is described in greater detail below.<br>
[0073]	Turning now to Fig. 9, an example system 900 is provided that illustrates<br>
utilization of one-hop message routing and/or message interception and selective<br>
forwarding in connection with simultaneous connectivity to multiple points of<br>
attachment is illustrated. System 900 includes a wireless terminal 902, which is<br>
configured to create links to multiple base stations at a single instance in time, if<br>
desirable. For example, wireless terminal 902 can be associated with multiple antennas<br>
and/or can be in a wireless environment where multiple links to multiple base stations<br>
with respect to a single wireless terminal is supported (e.g., FLASH OFDM). Thus, for<br>
instance, wireless terminal 902 can be associated with wireless links to two base stations<br>
at a single point in time, e.g., base station 904 and base station 906. One of such base<br>
stations 904 and 906 may desirably be designated as a primary point of attachment (e.g.,<br>
at the IP layer). For example, base station 904 may be desirably designated as the<br>
primary point of attachment. In some instances, however, the primary point of<br>
attachment 904 may not be the optimal base station by which to send/received data -<br>
rather, base station 906 may be utilized for transmission of data. Pursuant to an<br>
example, it may be detected that signal-to-noise ratio associated with a link 908 with<br>
base station 906 is lower than signal-to-noise ratio associated with a link 910 with base<br>
station 904. Accordingly, a scheduling application associated with wireless terminal<br>
902 and/or network infrastructure devices can cause data to be received/sent at a non-<br>
primary point of attachment. Thus, at various intervals of time, packets, e.g., messages<br>
or frames, can be sent/received by way of either point of attachment as deemed<br>
preferred based on some criteria, e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, loading, etc.<br>
[0074]	In some instances, however, it may be imperative to provide a specific<br>
point of attachment, e.g., the primary point of attachment, with certain packets, e.g., messages or frames. For example, a primary point of attachment should receive "connect" messages. In IP traffic, however, data is typically forwarded on a packet-by-<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
packet basis using connectionless hop-by-hop routing, such that a packet sent from terminal 902 to a point of attachment, e.g., either first base station 904 or second base station 906, is often destined for some other node and thus is in actuality subsequently relayed elsewhere. To address such an issue, one-hop multicasting can be utilized. For instance, a host 912 can provide messages or packets to one or more one-hop multicast addresses. Often, utilizing the one-hop multicast address(es) is used to communicate with a function or entity on a directly connected link when a unicast address is unknown. In some instances, however, it may be desirable to direct certain packets {e.g., packets addressed to a one-hop multicast address) to a particular point of attachment (e.g., a primary point of attachment). In an embodiment, packets originating from host 912 can be inspected to determine if such packets should be delivered to a particular point of attachment amongst a plurality of points of attachment (e.g., a primary point of attachment). As an example, each packet provided from host 912 that is directed towards a one-hop multicast address can be directed to a primary point of attachment<br>
[0075]	Moreover, as alluded to above, interception can occur amongst network<br>
infrastructure devices in connection with communicating with points of attachment. For<br>
instance, system 900 can include a network entity 914, which may desire to provide a<br>
message to a primary point of attachment with respect to wireless terminal 902 (but is<br>
not aware of identity and/or address of such point of attachment).<br>
[0076]	In still another example, base stations 904 and 906 can be<br>
communicatively coupled and act as routers, switches, or bridges. For instance, a packet may desirably be provided to first base station 904, but in actuality gets provided to second base station 906, e.g., because the link from wireless terminal 902 to second base station 906 was substantially better at the time that the packet was transmitted. Base station 906 can recognize (by some indication within the packet) that the packet is intended for base station 904, and can relay or re-direct such packet to first base station 904. For example, a packet addressed to a one-hop multicast address would typically not be forwarded beyond the direct link upon which it was sent. If second base station 906 receives a packet addressed to a one-hop multicast address, and determines that packets sent to one-hop multicast addresses should be provided to the first base station 904 (e.g., because first base station 904 is designated as the primary point of attachment), then second base station 906 can re-direct such packet to first base station<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
904, e.g., encapsulate the received packet in another packetor frame addressed to first base station 904.<br>
[0077]	Turning now to Fig. 10, an example LLC frame 1000 is illustrated. LLC<br>
frame 1000 can include a header portion 1002, which can comprise, for instance, an identifier 1004 of a base station or an indication that the frame 1000 should be forwarded to a particular entity or intercepted by a particular entity. LLC frame 1000 can also include a payload 1006, which may include requests, for instance, for certain QoS treatment with respect to particular traffic flows, e.g., a QoS resource control message carried in an IP packet destined to a one-hop multicast address. LLC frame 1000 can additionally include a trailer 1008, such as a CRC. Such frame 1000 can be employed to encapsulate a message when the initiator of such message does not have knowledge of an identity and/or address of a primary point of attachment with respect to a wireless terminal. For instance, a wireless terminal can classify a message received from a host (based on inspection of header and/or payload fields) and encapsulate the message within an LLC frame similar to that described herein. While LLC frames are described herein, it is understood that any suitable manner for re-routing a message to an intended recipient is contemplated by the inventors and intended to fall under the scope of the hereto-appended claims.<br>
[0078]	Now referring to Fig. 11, a methodology 1100 for encapsulating a data<br>
packet within an LLC frame in connection with providing contents thereof to a point of attachment (e.g., a primary point of attachment) is illustrated. The methodology 1100 starts at 1102, and at 1104 a data packet is received. For example, the received data packet can include QoS requests with respect to a particular wireless terminal, wherein such request can desirably be provided to a particular base station (e.g., a primary point of attachment). For instance, the data packet can be received by a wireless terminal from a host device. At 1106, a determination can be made that the data packet should be provided to a primary point of attachment. For example, the data packet can be addressed to a one-hop multi-cast address.<br>
[0079]	At 1108, the data packet is encapsulated in an LLC frame, for instance,<br>
and directed to the primary point of attachment. Such encapsulation can occur at a wireless terminal, for example. Once encapsulated, the frame can be provided to an appropriate point of attachment and/or routed to such point of attachment. The methodology 1100 then completes at 1110.<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
[0080]	Now turning to Fig. 12, a methodology 1200 for performing a unicast<br>
relay of a data packet is illustrated. The methodology 1200 begins at 1202, and at 1204<br>
a data packet is received. For instance, a wireless terminal can receive the data packet<br>
from a host. In another example, a home agent can receive the data packet from another<br>
network infrastructure device. At 1206, it is determined that the data packet is<br>
addressed to a particular base station (point of attachment). For example, the data<br>
packet can indicate an IP address of the base station. At 1208, the data packet is relayed<br>
to the identified base station, and at 1210 the methodology completes. This unicast<br>
routing can be supported in a flexible system that additionally supports one-hop<br>
multicasting as well as interception and relay of messages wherein the base station<br>
identity/address is not known at time of creation of the message.<br>
[0081]	Referring now to Fig. 13, a methodology 1300 for intercepting a<br>
message in a wireless communications environment is illustrated. Interception may be desirable when a party creating a message does not have knowledge of a particular base station associated with a wireless terminal (due to mobile capabilities of the wireless terminal). Such methodology 1300 can be performed, for instance, in a packet-switched wireless network. Methodology 1300 starts at 1302, and at 1304 a data packet is received, wherein the data packet is addressed to a particular wireless terminal. The data packet can be received at a base station, for example. At 1306, the header of the packet is analyzed, as the header can include an indication that the packet should be retained and analyzed rather than forwarded to the wireless terminal. For instance, a base station can determine to intercept the packet based on inspection of one or more fields in the header and/or payload, e.g., match a specific value of a field within the header, etc. At 1308, a determination is made that the packet is intended for the receiving base station (and not the wireless terminal that is communicatively coupled to the base station). Additionally, it is understood that the base station can "intercept" messages from subscriber-side devices and addressed to a communications peer within a network. In other words, base station may be employed to "intercept" downlink and/or uplink packets, where the term "intercept" refers to the base station receiving a packet addressed to a different network element and recognizing that such packet is intended for the base station. The base station can thereafter analyze contents of the data packet and, for instance, provide QoS treatment with respect to one or more traffic flows based upon contents of the data packet. The methodology 1300 then completes at 1310.<br><br>

[0082]	Turning now to Fig. 14, a methodology 1400 for performing selective<br>
forwarding in connection with providing a data packet to an appropriate base station is illustrated. As described above, mobility of wireless terminals can cause primary points of attachment with respect to a wireless terminal. Moreover, a wireless terminal may be associated with links to multiple base stations, wherein one of such base stations should be designated as a primary point of attachment. It is difficult, however, to provide knowledge to each network entity and subscriber-side device of primary points of attachment as a mobile unit's geographic location alters. The methodology 1400 enables packets intended for a primary base station to be routed to such base station when an originating entity does not have knowledge of primary base station identity/network address.<br>
[0083]	The methodology 1400 starts at 1402, and at 1404 a data packet is<br>
received that is addressed to a one hop multicast address. For example, a host device can initiate transmission of the data packet and a wireless terminal associated with the host device can receive such data packet. At 1406, the data packet is encapsulated in a particular frame format (e.g., an LLC frame), and an indication is provided within the header of such frame that the data packet is intended for a primary point of attachment (base station). For instance, a wireless terminal can perform such encapsulation. At 1408, the frame is provided to a base station that is communicatively coupled to the wireless terminal. In more detail, the frame can be provided to a base station that is not the primary point of attachment, but such base station can analyze the frame and determine that the packet should be forwarded to an appropriate base station, m another example, the frame can be directly provided to the primary point of attachment. The methodology 1400 then completes at 1410.<br>
[0084]	With reference to Fig. 15, a system 1500 that facilitates provision of data<br>
packets to an appropriate point of attachment (base station) is illustrated. System 1500 includes logical module(s) for receiving a data packet 1502, wherein such module(s) 1502 can include one or more network ports, an antenna, a receiver chain, memory, a processor, or any other suitable software/hardware that can be utilized to receive a data packet. System 1500 also includes logical module(s) for determining that the data packet should be provided to a particular point of attachment 1504. Such module(s) can include a processor, an application executed by the processor (e.g., configured to analyze the received data packet to determine whether the packet is intended for a primary point of attachment (base station)). System 1500 additionally includes logical<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
module(s) for encapsulating the data packet in an LLC frame 1506. Again, such module(s) 1506 can include a processor, memory, hardware, software, firmware, etc. System 1500 also includes logical module(s) for directing the frame to the particular point of attachment 1508, wherein logical module(s) 1508 may include a transmitter, a network port, and/or any other suitable communications medium, as well as software, hardware, firmware, and the like that enables the frame to be directed to the particular point of attachment.<br>
[0085]	Turning now to Fig. 16, a system 1600 relating to "intercepting"<br>
messages is illustrated, wherein "intercepting" refers to recognizing that a packet addressed to a network entity is in actuality intended for a receiving entity. System 1600 include logical module(s) for receiving a data packet 1602, wherein such module(s) 1602 can comprise an antenna, a receiver chain, a processor, memory, and/or any suitable hardware, software, and/or firmware associated therewith. The received data packet can be addressed to a particular network entity. System 1600 additionally includes logical module(s) for determining that the data packet is addressed to a network entity that is not the receiving entity 1604. For instance, the logical module(s) 1604 can include a processor, an application, and/or the like. System 1600 also includes logical module(s) 1606 for determining that the data packet is intended for the receiving entity 1606 (even though the data packet is addressed to a different network entity). The logical module(s) 1606 can include one or more processors, memory, etc. System 1600 can also comprise logical module(s) for executing instructions at the receiving entity based at least in part upon contents of the received data packet 1608. Such module(s) 1608 can include a processor, for example.<br>
[0086]	Now referring to Fig. 17, a system 1700 is shown, wherein system 1700<br>
is employed to illustrate provision of an indication to a requester of resources that a point of attachment with respect to a resource state has been changed, e.g., the subscriber device with which resources are associated has moved to a new point of attachment. System 1700 includes a wireless terminal 1702 that is communicatively coupled to at least one of two access nodes 1704 and 1706. In an example, access nodes 1704 and 1706 can be base stations within a wireless communications environment, and wireless terrninal 1702 can be communicatively coupled to both access nodes 1704 and 1706 simultaneously (as shown by links 1708 and 1710), wherein one of such nodes is a primary access node. It is understood, however, that wireless terminal 1702 can be coupled to both access nodes 1704 and 1706 simultaneously without either of such<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br><br>
access nodes being labeled as a 'primary" access node. In another example, wireless terminal 1702 maybe linked to access node 1704 at a first instance in time and then handed off to access node 1706 at a second instance in time. Wireless terminal 1702 can be associated with a host device 1712, which, for instance, may comprise wireless terminal 1702. Li another example, host 1712 may be a computing device and wireless terminal 1702 can be a peripheral device.<br>
[0087]	System 1700 can also include a network entity 1714 mat requests<br>
resources from one of access nodes 1704 and 1706 with respect to wireless terminal 1702. For instance, network entity 1714 can be an application server, and can request QoS support/management on behalf of wireless terminal 1702 from a primary access node associated with wireless terminal. In another example, network entity 1714 can be a function that resides within an application server, for example. As described above, however, wireless terminal 1702 can move to different geographic locations within a network, thereby changing its point of attachment (or primary point of attachment) to a network. To ensure that network entity 1714 has knowledge of where to relay resource requests, a message (move message) mat informs network entity 1714 that a point of . attachment with respect to wireless terminal 1702 has changed is generated by at least one of access nodes 1704 and 1706 and provided to network entity 1714. In addition or alternatively, the message (move message) can inform network entity 1714 that resource state, eg., data structures corresponding to QoS support for one or more traffic flows, controlled and/or maintained by the network entity 1714 have been moved to a new point of attachment of wireless terminal 1702.<br>
[0088]	Pursuant to an example, access node 1704 may at first be a point of<br>
attachment with respect to wireless terminal 1702, and network entity 1714 can provide access node 1704 with a request for resources. Access node 1704 can retain resource state information (e.g., QoS resource information) and provide wireless terminal 1702 with appropriate traffic flow treatment with respect to the resource request (assuming a subscriber is authorized with respect to requested resources). As wireless terminal 1702 changes location, a handoff may occur such that access node 1706 becomes the point of attachment (e.g., primary point of attachment) with respect to wireless terminal 1702. In another example, access node 1706 can become a point of attachment with respect to a particular resource or resource state while access node 1704 remains a point of attachment for different resources or resource states. Resource state information, including identity/network address of a requester, can be relayed between access node<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br><br>
1704 (a most recent point of attachment) to access node 1706 (a current point of<br>
attachment). Access node 1706 can then provide a message to network entity 1714<br>
indicating that access node 1706 is now the point of attachment {e.g., the primary point<br>
of attachment) for wireless terminal 1702. La another embodiment, access node 1704<br>
can provide the move message to network entity 1714, indicating that access node 1706<br>
is the new point of attachment for wireless terminal 1702. In still another embodiment,<br>
both access node 1704 and access node 1706 can provide the network entity 1714 with a<br>
move message. Thereafter, network entity 1714 can provide subsequent resource<br>
requests to the current point of attachment (e.g., access node 1706).<br>
[0089]	Wireless terminal 1702 can also be employed to provide a move<br>
message, wherein such move message may be provided to host 1712. Pursuant to an example, wireless terminal 1702 may have knowledge that a point of attachment has changed (e.g., from access node 1704 to access node 1706). Wireless terminal 1702 can then generate amove message and provide such message to host 1712, thereby enabling host 1712 to have knowledge of where to provide resource requests (e.g., requests for QoS support for particular traffic flows).<br>
[0090]	As can be discerned, there may be a race condition if, for instance,<br>
network entity 1714 initiates a resource request and provides it to an access node, that is<br>
no longer a primary access node and/or linked to wireless terminal 1702. In such case,<br>
resource requests (e.g., to add resources desirably associated with wireless terminal<br>
1702, modify resources associated with wireless terminal 1702, delete resources<br>
associated with wireless terminal 1702) can time out. Prior to timing out or proximate<br>
in time thereto, network entity 1714 can receive a move message. Other<br>
manners/mechanisms for managing race conditions are contemplated by the inventors<br>
and are intended to fall under the scope of the hereto-appended claims.<br>
[0091]	Turning now to fig. 18, a methodology 1800 for providing a move<br>
indication (message) to a requester of resources is illustrated. Methodology 1800 begins at 1802, and at 1804 a handoff is performed with respect to an access node (e.g., base station) that is a point of attachment for a wireless terminal. For instance, the access node can be one of several points of attachment and/or can be a sole point of attachment (prior to handoff). Such handoff can occur due to a wireless terminal transitioning geographically between coverage areas provided by base stations, for instance. At 1806, aresource state associated with a resource requester is received. For example, such resource state can be received at a current point of attachment (e.g.,<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br><br>
primary point of attachment) from a most recent point of attachment (or primary point<br>
of attachment). The resource state, for instance, can indicate how particular traffic<br>
flows associated with a wireless terminal are to be treated with respect to QoS. The<br>
resource requester can be a network entity requesting resources associated with a<br>
wireless terminal, such as an application server. Additionally or alternatively, the<br>
resource requester can be a host associated with the wireless terminal. Moreover, the<br>
resource requester can be a function that resides within an application server and/or a<br>
function that resides within a subscriber-side device. Still further, the current point of<br>
attachment can receive multiple resource states associated with a plurality of resource<br>
requesters. At 1808, a move indication is provided to the requester (or multiple<br>
requesters), thereby providing the requesters) with knowledge of a base station that is<br>
providing certain QoS treatment with respect to one or more traffic flows to the wireless<br>
terminal, for instance. The requester can then provide subsequent requests to the current<br>
point of attachment. The methodology 1800 thereafter completes at 1810.<br>
[0092]	With respect to Fig. 19, a methodology 1900 for providing a resource<br>
requester with a move message is illustrated. Methodology 1900 begins at 1902, and at 1904 a determination is made that a handoff has occurred with respect to a wireless terminal. For example, an access node that was a point of attachment (e.g., a primary point of attachment) can determine that it is no longer a point of attachment (or no longer the primary point of attachment) after the handoff has occurred. At 1906, an identity/location of a resource requester is determined, wherein the access node managed/supported resources associated with the resource requester prior to the handoff. For instance, the identity and/or location of the resource requester can be retained within memory associated with the access node.<br>
[0093]	At 1908, an identity and/or location of an access node that is a new point<br>
of attachment (or new primary point of attachment) is determined. For example, such identity/location can be provided from an access node that is a new point of attachment (after handoff), from a wireless terminal that is subject to the handoff, and/or the like. At 1910, the identified resource requester is provided with an identity and/or location of the new point of attachment (or primary point of attachment). Thus, the resource requester will have knowledge of where to provide future resource requests. The methodology 1900 then completes at 1912.<br>
[0094]	Referring now to Fig. 20, a methodology 2000 for providing resource<br>
requests to a point of attachment is illustrated. The methodology 2000 initiates at 2002,<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
and at 2004 a request for resources on behalf of a wireless terminal is provided to a point of attachment, which can be, for example, a primary point of attachment. For instance, the request can be provided to a base station that performs scheduling, resource allocation, and other QoS functions with respect to the wireless terminal that is the subject of the request. An application server, for example, can provide the resource request to a current point of attachment. At 2006, an indication that a point of attachment has been altered is received (or that a primary point of attachment has changed). For example, as described above, the move message can be provided from a current primary point of attachment and/or the previous primary point of attachment. At 2008, a subsequent resource request is provided to the point of attachment (e.g., primary point of attachment) indicated within the move message, e.g., the new primary point of attachment following a change in the primary point of attachment. The methodology 2000 then completes at 2010.<br>
[0095]	Now turning to Fig. 21, a system 2100 that facilitates informing a<br>
resource requester of a change in point of attachment with respect to a wireless terminal<br>
is illustrated. System 2100 includes logical module(s) for receiving a QoS resource<br>
state associated with a requester 2102, wherein such module(s) 2102 can include a port,<br>
a receiver chain, a processor, memory, and/or the like. For instance, module(s) 2102<br>
can be configured to receive the resource state from a previous point of attachment or a<br>
previous primary point of attachment. With more specificity, during a handoff<br>
procedure, a previous point of attachment can provide a new point of attachment with<br>
resource states associated with a wireless terminal that is a subject of the handoff<br>
procedure. In another example, a previous primary point of attachment can provide a<br>
new primary point of attachment with resource states relating to the wireless terminal.<br>
System 2100 additionally includes logical module(s) for delivering a move indication to<br>
the requester 2104, wherein the modules) 2104 can include an antenna, a transmitter<br>
chain, and/or the like. Thus, the requester will have knowledge of identity/network<br>
address of a current point of attachment associated with the wireless terminal.<br>
[0096]	With reference to Fig. 22, a system 2200 for providing QoS resource<br>
requests to an appropriate access node is illustrated. System 2200 includes logical modules) for providing a QoS support request to a point of attachment 2202 (e.g., a primary point of attachment), wherein such module(s) 2202 can include an antenna, transmission software, network cabling, and/or the like. The point of attachment can be the point of attachment for a particular wireless terminal that is subject of the QoS<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br>
support request. System 2200 additionally includes logical module(s) for receiving an<br>
indication that a point of attachment has been altered 2204. For example, the primary<br>
point of attachment may change, an additional point of attachment may be associated<br>
with the wireless terminal, etc. Such logical module(s) 2204 can include a receiver<br>
chain, network cabling, software that enables receipt of the indication, etc. System 2200<br>
further includes logical module(s) for providing subsequent QoS support requests to a<br>
' new point of attachment with respect to the wireless terminal 2206. The logical<br>
module(s) 2206 can include substantially similar elements as logical module(s) 2202.<br>
[0097]	Now turning to Fig. 23, a communications apparatus 2300 is illustrated.<br>
Communications apparatus can be a terminal, a wireless terminal, a host, an access node (such as a base station), a network entity such as an application server, a home agent, etc., and/or the like. Communications apparatus 2300 can include memory 2302 that is utilized to retain various instructions and a processor 2304 mat is configured to execute such instructions. For instance, if communications apparatus 2300 is an access node, memory 2302 can include instructions for receiving QoS support/management requests from multiple entities on behalf of a wireless terminal, and processor 2304 can be employed to execute such instructions. Generally, communications apparatus can be configured such that memory 2302 includes instructions relating to any suitable functionality described above, and processor 2304 can be employed to execute such instructions (including but not limited to instructions for providing QoS support requests, instructions for receiving QoS support requests, instructions for generating and delivering a move indication, instructions for encapsulating a data package in an LLC frame, and other functionality described herein).<br>
[0098]	To provide additional context for one or more embodiments described<br>
herein, Fig. 24 is provided to illustrate an example communication system 2400 that comprises a plurality of nodes interconnected by communications links. The system 2400 may use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals to communicate information over wireless links. However, other types of signals, e.g., Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) signals or Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) signals, are also contemplated (together with signals utilized in land-based networks). Nodes in the communication system 2400 exchange information using signals, e.g., messages, based on communication protocols, e.g., the Internet Protocol (IP). The communications links of the system 2400 maybe implemented, for example, using wires, fiber optic cables, and/or wireless communications techniques. The system<br><br>

2400 includes a plurality of end nodes 2402-2412, which access the communication<br>
system 2400 by way of a plurality of access nodes 2414-2418. End nodes 2402-2412<br>
may be, e.g., wireless communication devices or terminals, and the access nodes 2414-<br>
2418 may be, e.g., wireless access routers or base stations. Communication system<br>
2400 also includes a number of other nodes 2420-2430 that are used to provide<br>
interconnectivity or to provide specific services or functions.<br>
[0099]	Communications system 2400 depicts a network 2460 that includes<br>
access control node 2420, mobility support node 2422, policy control node 2424, and<br>
application server node 2426, all of which are connected to an intermediate network<br>
node 2428 by a corresponding network link 2432-2438, respectively. In some<br>
embodiments, the access control node, e.g., a Remote Authentication Dial In User<br>
Service (RADIUS) or Diameter server, supports authentication, authorization, and/or<br>
accounting of end nodes and/or services associated with end nodes. In some<br>
embodiments, mobility support node 2422, e.g., a Mobile IP home agent and/or context<br>
transfer server, supports mobility, e.g., handoff, of end nodes between access nodes,<br>
e.g., by way of redirection of traffic to/from end nodes and/or transfer of state associated<br>
with end nodes between access nodes. In some embodiments, policy control node 2424,<br>
e.g., a policy server or Policy Decision Point (PDP), supports policy authorization for<br>
services or application layer sessions. In some embodiments, application server node<br>
2426, e.g., a Session Initiation Protocol server, streaming media server, or other<br>
application layer server, supports session signaling for services available to end nodes<br>
and/or provides services or content available to end nodes.<br>
[00100]	Intermediate network node 2428 in network 2460 provides<br>
interconnectivity to network nodes that are external from the perspective of network 2460 by way of network link 2434. Network link 2434 is connected to intermediate network node 2430, which provides further connectivity to access nodes 2414,2416, and 2418 by way of network links 2436-2440, respectively. Each access node 2414-2418 is depicted as providing connectivity to end nodes 2402-2412, respectively, by way of corresponding access links 2442-2452, respectively. In communication system 2400, each access node 2414-2418 is depicted as using wireless technology, e.g., wireless access links, to provide access. Wired technology may also be utilized, however, in connection with provision of access. A radio coverage area, e.g., communications cells 2454-2458 of each access node 2414-2418, is illustrated as a circle surrounding the corresponding access node.<br><br>

[00101]	Communication system 2400 can be used as a basis for the description of<br>
various embodiments described herein. Alternative embodiments include various<br>
network topologies, where a number and type of nodes (including network nodes,<br>
access nodes, end nodes, as well as various control, support, and server nodes), a<br>
number and type of links, and interconnectivity between various nodes may differ from<br>
that of communication system 2400. Additionally, some of the functional entities<br>
depicted in communication system 2400 may be omitted or combined. Location or<br>
placement of these functional entities may also be varied.<br>
[00102]	Fig. 25 provides an illustration of an example end node 2500, e.g.,<br>
wireless terminal. End node 2500 is a representation of an apparatus that may be used as any one of end nodes 2402-2412 (Fig. 24). End node 2500 includes a processor 2502, a wireless communication interface module 2504, a user input/output interface 2506 and memory 2508 coupled together by a bus 2510. Accordingly, by way of bus 2510, the various components of the end node 2500 can exchange information, signals and data. Components 2502-2508 of end node 2500 can be located inside a housing 2512.<br>
[00103]	Wireless communication interface module 2504 provides a mechanism<br>
by which the internal components of end node 2500 can send and receive signals<br>
to/from external devices and network nodes, e.g., access nodes. Wireless<br>
communication interface module 2504 includes, e.g., a receiver module 2514 with a<br>
corresponding receiving antenna 2516 and a transmitter module 2518 with a<br>
corresponding transmitting antenna 2520 used for coupling end node 2500 to other<br>

a user output device 2524, e.g., display, which are coupled to bus 2510 through user input/output interface 2506. Thus, user input/output devices 2522 and 2524 can exchange information, signals and data with other components of end node 2500 by way of user input/output interface 2506 and bus 2510. User input/output interface 2506 and associated devices 2522 and 2524 provide mechanisms by which a user can operate end node 2500 to accomplish various tasks. In particular, user input device 2522 and user output device 2524 provide functionality mat allows a user to control end node 2500 and applications, e.g., modules, programs, routines and/or functions, that execute in memory 2508 of end node 2500.<br><br>

[00105]	Processor 2502, under control of various modules, e.g., routines,<br>
included in memory 2508 controls operation of end node 2500 to perform various<br>
signaling and processing. The modules included in memory 2508 are executed on<br>
startup or as called by other modules. Modules may exchange data, information, and<br>
signals when executed. Modules may also share data and information when executed.<br>
Memory 2508 of end node 2500 includes a control signaling module 2526, an<br>
application module 2528, and a traffic control module 2530, which further includes<br>
configuration information 2532 and various additional modules.<br>

and sending signals, e.g., messages, for controlling operation and/or configuration of various aspects of end node 2500 including, e.g„ traffic control module 2530 as well as configuration information 2532 and various additional modules included. In some embodiments, control signaling module 2526 can include state information, e.g., parameters, status and/or other information, relating to operation of end node 2500 and/or one or more signaling protocols supported by control signaling module 2526. In particular, control signaling module 2526 may include configuration information, e.g., end node identification information and/or parameter settings, and operational information, e.g., information about current processing state, status of pending message transactions, etc.<br>
[00107]	Application module 2528 controls processing and communications<br>
relating to one or more applications supported by end node 2500.

messages, packets, or frames, sent from a corresponding node to application module 2528 in end node 2528 is shown by a sequence of arrows 2720-2728 to be received by access node 2600, e.g., by way of network/internetwork interface module 2606, and then to proceed through a sequence of modules 2646-2654 included in access node 2600 for processing, after which the data information is sent from the access node 2600 to the end node 2500, e.g., via the wireless communication interface module 2608. Following reception by end node 2500, e.g., by way of wireless communication interface module 2504, the data information, e.g, traffic flows comprising a sequence of messages, packets, or frames, sent from the corresponding node to application module 2528 in end node 2500 is shown by a sequence of arrows 2730-2734 to proceed through a sequence of modules 2546 and 2548 included in end node 2500 for processing, prior to being delivered to the application module 2528 in end node 2500.<br>
[00137]	In addition to the exchange of data information, e.g., traffic flows, Fig<br>
27. also depicts the exchange of control information, e.g., signaling flows and/or<br>
communication interfaces. In particular, the Fig. 27 example depicts the exchange of<br>
control information between control signaling module 2626 and traffic control module<br>
2628 included in access node 2600. Similarly, the Fig. 27 example depicts the<br>
exchange of control information between control signaling module 2526 and the traffic<br>
control module 2530 included in the end node 2500. In both access node 2600 and end<br>
node 2500, exchange of control information between the modules as shown allows the<br>
respective control signaling module 2626/2526 in the access/end node 2600/2500 to<br>
affect, e.g., set, modify, and/or monitor, the configuration and/or operation of the<br>
various modules included in the respective traffic control module 2628/2530, as needed<br>
to provide the proper quality of service treatment of the data information, e.g., traffic<br>
flows, to/from the application module 2528 in the end node 2500.<br>
[00138]	The exchange of control information, e.g, signaling flows and/or<br>
communication interfaces, is also shown a) between another node and control signaling module 2626 in access node 2600, b) between application module 2528 in end node<br><br>
WO 2007/035797	 	PCT/US2006/036584<br><br>
2500 and control signaling module 2526 in end node 2500, and c) between the<br>
respective control signaling modules 2626/2526 in access node 2600 and end node<br>
2500. These exchanges of control information, e.g., signaling flows and/or<br>
communication interfaces, enable the configuration and/or operation of traffic control<br>
modules 2628/2530 in both access node 2600 and the end node 2500 to be affected by<br>
a) one or more additional nodes, e.g. the access control node 2420 and/or application<br>
server node 2426, b) application module 2528 in end node 2500, or c) a combination of<br>
one or more additional nodes and the application module 2528 in end node 2500.<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention may, and do, support all or only a subset<br>
of the depicted control information exchanges as needed.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
PACKET ROUTING IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS ENVIRONMENT<br>
The claimed subject matter relates to performing routing in a wireless communications system. In more detail, each device associated with a wireless packet-switched network may not be aware of an identity and/or address of a particular point of attachment with respect to a wireless terminal. A data packet that should be provided to a particular point of attachment can be initially directed to a wireless terminal or a one-hop multicast address, for instance. Thereafter, the data packet can be encapsulated in a frame format and identity of the particular point of attachment can be provided in such frame. The frame can thereafter be routed to the point of attachment.<br></td>
