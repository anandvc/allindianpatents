				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method for plastic working a high fatigue strength gear.<br>
Conventionally, there has been known a high fatigue strength gear made from a soft nitriding steel as a low or medium carbon steel containing Al, Cr, and the like specified, for example, under JIS SACM^45.  However, such a steel cannot achieve a fatigue strength necessary for a gear only by soft nitriding, and thereby it is quenched and tempered for improving an inner hardness (that is, internal strength).<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, since the soft nitriding is applied to a semi-finished gear after being mechanically worked, the<br><br>
increasing degree of the hardness due to quenching and tempering is limited in consideration of the mechanical workability. As a result, the fatigue strength of the gear, particularly, the bending fatigue strength of the dedendum of the gear cannot be improved as expected. That is, the above gear is inferior in bending fatigue strength to a.gear subjected to carburizing.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a gear having a high fatigue strength and a high dimensional accuracy, which is formed from a specific steel material being excellent in plastic workability and mechanical workability and capable of being subjected to soft nitriding serving as artificial aging after solution treatment.<br>
To achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a high fatigue strength gear formed from a steel material by plastic working, the steel material containing C^O.Ol wt%, Si^l wt%, 0.05 wt%^Mn^0.5 wt%, P^O.l wt%, S^O.03 wt%, 0.02 wtl^sol. Al^O.l wt%, 0.8 wt%^Cu^l.7 wt%, and 0.02 wt%^ Ti^O.l wt%, the balance being Fe and inevitable elements,<br><br>
wherein the gear is subjected to soft nitriding serving as artificial aging, after being subjected to solution treatment.<br>
The steel material having the above composition has a metal structure composed of a ferrite single phase, and consequently, it exhibits a desirable plastic workability and mechanical workability substantially comparative to those of a mild steel.<br>
Since the above steel material exhibits age-hardenability by saturated solution of Cu, the mechanical strength of the gear can be improved by applying artificial aging treatment to the semi-finished gear having been already subjected to solution heat treatment.<br>
Since the above steel material contains Ti as well as a very low amount of C, it exhibits a desirable soft nitriding characteristic under an artificial aging temperature after solution treatment.  In other words, in this steel material, the artificial aging temperature substantially corresponds to the soft nitriding temperature.<br><br>
Accordingly, the fatigue strength of the gear can be sufficiently improved without quenching and tempering by applying soft nitriding serving as artificial aging to the semi-finished gear. Further, since both treatments, soft nitriding and artificial aging, are simultaneously performed, it is possible to achieve energy saving and reduction in production cost.<br>
The depth "d" of the hardened surface layer (which means the total nitrided layer, the same shall apply hereinafter) is desirable to be 0.6 mm or more from the viewpoint of improvement in fatigue strength.  However, the upper limit of the depth "d" is 1.0 mm for the gear having a wall thickness of 2.2 mm or more.  If the depth "d" is more than 1.0 mm, the gear may be embrittled.<br>
Since the soft nitriding is performed at a relatively low temperature, the strain of the gear generated by heat treatment is small.  Accordingly, by shaving the gear prior to soft nitriding, the gear keeps a high dimensional accuracy after soft nitriding.  Thus, it is possible to eliminate the finish work of a tooth flank of the gear by polishing, which is required for the gear having been carburized.<br><br>
The effect of each chemical component of the above steel material and the reason why the content thereof is limitejd are as follows:<br>
Carbon (C):<br>
This element contained in the above steel material is effective to form a ferrite single phase and hence to ensure a high ductility.  To make deeper the surface hardened layer by soft nitriding, the content of C is desired to be made as small as possible. When the carbon content is more than 0.01 wt%, the ductility of the steel material is reduced, and the surface hardened layer is made narrower.<br>
Silicon (Si):<br>
Si is an element of improving the strength of the steel material. The content of Si is adjusted in accordance with the strength required for the steel material. When the content of Si is more than 1 wt%, the ductility of the steel material is reduced, and thereby the plastic workability of the steel material becomes lower.<br>
Manganese (Mn):<br><br>
Mn is an element of improving the strength of the steel material, like Si. The content of Mn is adjusted in accordance with the strength required for the steel material. When the content of Mn is more than 0.5 wt%, the ductility of the steel material is reduced, and thereby the plastic workability becomes lower. When it is less than 0.05 wt%, the additional effect is lost and also surface defects tend to be generated on the surface of the steel material.<br>
Phosphorus (P):<br>
P is an element of improving the strength of the steel material, line Mn.  The content of P is adjusted in accordance with the strength required for the steel material. When the content of P is more than 0.1 wt%, there is a possibility that cracks are generated by secondary working.<br>
Sulfur (S):<br>
The content of S is desired to be smaller for enhancing the ductility of the steel material. When the content of S is more than 0.03 wt%, the ductility of the steel material is significantly reduced.<br><br>
Aluminum (Al):<br>
Al is an element having an effect of enhancing the soft nitriding characteristic of the steel material. When the content of Al is more than 0.1 wt%, the plastic workability and mechanical workability of the steel material are reduced. When it is less than 0.02 wt%, the additional effect is lost.<br>
Copper (Cu):<br>
Cu gives an age-hardenability to the steel material as described above. When the content of Cu is more than 1.7 wt%, the surface quality of the steel material is degraded. When it is less than 0.8 wt%, the additional effect is lost.<br>
Titanium (Ti):<br>
Ti is an element of giving a soft nitriding characteristic to the steel material containing a very low amount of carbon. Specifically, Ti forms a fine complex nitride together with Fe and makes deep a surface hardened layer. When the content of Ti is more than 0.1 wt%, the surface hardened layer becomes excessively deep, making brittle the steel material. When it is less than 0.02 wt%, the additional effect is lost.<br><br>
The above steel material may contain Ni in an amount of 0.15 wt% to 0.7 wt%, in addition to the above elements. Ni has an effect of enhancing the surface quality of the steel material and preventing thermal embrittlement.<br>
In the case where a steel plate is used as the above steel material, it is often used as hot-rolled.  In this case, the solution treatment for the steel plate is performed by rapidly cooling the steel plate from a finishing temperature to a winding temperature at the rolling step. In the case where a bar steel is used as the above steel material, it can be subjected to solution treatment at the final stage of the hot-rolling. However, if the bar steel is hot-forged, it may be subjected to solution treatment by rapid cooling after completion of the hot forging or rapid cooling after re-heating serving as adjustment of crystal grain sizes.<br>
The solution treatment temperature TI, which is the above finishing temperature of hot rolling or the hot-forging ending temperature, may be set at a value of 780°C to 1050°C. When the temperature is less than 780°C, it is<br><br>
difficult to achieve saturated solution of Cu. When it is more than 1050PC, crystal grains are coarsened, leading to reduction in strength and toughness.<br>
The artificial aging temperature T2 for the steel material may be set at a value of 550°C to 600°C. When the temperature is more than 600°C, there occurs over-aging, which leads to reduction in internal hardness, thereby making it impossible to sufficiently improve the fatigue strength. When it is less than 550°C, it is impossible to perform the artificial aging and soft nitriding. The treatment time "t" is desirable to be set at a value of 2 hr to 4 hr. When the treatment time is less than 2 hr, the depth "d" of the surface hardened layer is less than 0.6 mm. When it is more than 4 hr, the depth "d" exceeds the upper limit d = 1.0 ram.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for plastic working a high fatigue strength gear, comprising the following steps:<br>
(a) forming a gear shape from a steel by plastic working, said steel material containing C^0.01wt%, Si^l wt%, 0.05 wt%sMn
(b)	subjecting    said    gear    with    solution    heat    treatment<br>
characterised in that<br>
(c)	said gear is treated with soft nitriding serving as artificial<br>
aging in a manner such as herein described which is performed at a<br>
temperature T2 within a range of 550°C <t2></t2><br>

[Embodiment of the Invention]<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a crank shaft 1 used for an in-line four-cylinder internal combustion engine. A rotational torque of the crank shaft 1 is transmitted to a driven gear 4 through a compound gear 3. The compound gear 3 is provided on a crank arm 2 formed at one end of the crank shaft 1 and it includes a backlash<br><br>
eliminating mechanism (not shown).<br>
The compound gear 3 is composed of a main gear 5 serving as the crank arm 2, and a sub-gear 6 fitted around the crank shaft 1 coaxially with the main gear 5 in such a manner as to be brought in contact with the main gear 5.<br>
The sub-gear 6 is a gear produced by plastic working. Referring to Fig. 2, the sub-gear 6 is formed into an annular shape having a fitting hole 7 at a central area and having, around the fitting hole 7, a plurality of rectangular windows 8 spaced at equal intervals along the circumference and a plurality of circular holes 9 spaced at equal intervals along the circumference. A cut-and-raised claw 10 is formed at one edge of each rectangular window 8 in the circumferential direction. The claw 10 functions as one element of a backlash eliminating mechanism. The circular holes 9 are provided for reducing the weight of the sub-gear 6.<br>
The sub-gear 6, which has the fitting hole 7, rectangular windows 8, and circular holes 9 as described above, requires a high fatigue strength.<br><br>
I:<br><br>
A composition of a steel plate used for the sub-gear 6 is shown in Table 1.<br>
([Table 1] Removed)<br><br>
The above steel plate is produced using a hot strip mill. The steel plate is subjected to solution treatment by rapid cooling from a finishing temperature (solution treatment temperature TI) of 910°C to a winding temperature of 300°C.. The thickness of the steel plate is 3.5 mm.<br>
In the case where the sub-gear 6 is of a type produced by punching, it is produced by steps of punching using a press, bending using a press, machining, and soft nitriding serving as artificial aging, the steps being seguentially performed in this order.<br>
The above steps will be described in detail below.<br><br>
A.	Punching Using Press<br>
This step includes a work of punching the above steel plate to form a blank of 110 mm in diameter; a work of punching the blank to form a semi-finished sub-gear including a teeth portion; and a work of punching the semi¬finished sub-gear to form a prepared hole for a fitting hole, circular holes 9, and U-shaped slots for cut-and-raised claws, the works being sequentially performed.<br>
B.	Bending Using Press<br>
The semi-finished sub-gear is subjected to bending to form cut-and-raised claws 10 and simultaneously form rectangular windows 8.<br>
C.	Machining<br>
The semi-finished sub-gear is subjected to machining to form a fitting hole 7 based on the above prepared hole, followed by shaving for each tooth surface (tip surface and dedendum surface) of the semi-finished sub-gear.<br>
D.	Soft Nitriding Serving as Artificial Aging<br>
The semi-finished sub-gear is subjected to soft<br><br><br>
nitriding serving as artificial aging, to obtain a sub-gear 6. The soft nitriding is performed in an atmosphere of NH3 gas based on N2 gas at an artificial aging temperature T2 of 580°C for a treatment time "t" of 2 hr. The sub-gear 6 obtained in such a condition is taken as Inventive Example 1. Next, another sub-gear 6 is obtained under a condition in which only the treatment time "t" is changed from the above value 2 hr into 3 hr. The sub-gear 6 thus obtained is taken as Inventive Example 2.<br>
The above sub-gears (Inventive Examples 1, 2) are compared with the following comparative examples. A semi¬finished sub-gear is similarly formed of a steel plate (thickness: 3.5 mm) made from a soft nitriding steel having a composition of C (0.3 wt%)-Mn (1 wt%)-Cr (1 wt%)-v (0.1 wt%)-B (0.001 wt%)-Fe (balance), followed by soft nitriding, to obtain a sub-gear. The treatment condition is the same as that described above except that the treatment time "t" is set at 3 hr. The sub-gear thus obtained is taken as Comparative Example 1.<br>
A semi-finished sub gear is similarly formed of a steel plate (thickness: 3.5 mm) made from an Al-Cr-Mo steel (JIS SACM 645) treated by quenching and tempering, followed<br><br>
by soft nitriding, to obtain a sub-gear. The treatment condition is the same as that described above except that the treatment time "t" is set at 3 hr. The sub-gear thus obtained is taken as Comparative Example 2.<br>
A semi-finished sub-gear is similarly formed of a steel plate (thickness: 3.5 mm) made from a carburized steel (JIS SCM415H), followed by carburizing/guenching, to obtain a sub-gear. The carburizing/quenching is performed by holding the semi-finished sub-gear in a carburizing atmosphere at 910°C for 1.5 hr and at 840°C for 0.5 hr, and rapid cooling it. The sub-gear thus obtained is taken as Comparative Example 3.<br>
Fig. 3 is a graph showing a relationship between a distance from the surface and a hardness (Hv 0.2) for each of Inventive Examples 1, 2 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3. As is apparent from Fig. 3, a depth "d" of a surface hardened layer of each of Inventive Examples 1, 2 is deeper that of each of Comparative Examples 1 to 3; however, a hardness of the surface or its vicinity of each of Inventive Examples 1, 2 is lower than that of each of Comparative Examples 1 to 3.<br><br>
Inventive Examples 1, 2 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 are subjected to completely reversed plane bending test for measuring the bending fatigue strength of a dedendum 11 of each example (sub-gear 6).<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph showing a relationship between the number N of repetitions of stress and a stress amplitude o"a for each of Inventive Examples 1, 2 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3. Table 2 shows the stress amplitude aa when the number (N) of repetitions of stress reaches 10? times for each of Inventive Examples 1, 2 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3.<br>
[Table 2] Removed)<br><br><br>
As is apparent from Fig. 4 and Table 2, each of Inventive Examples 1, 2 is higher in bending fatigue strength than each of Comparative Examples 1 to 3.<br>
In the case where the sub-gear 6 is of a type produced by hot forging, it is produced by steps of hot forging, solution treatment, machining, and soft nitriding serving as artificial aging, the steps being sequentially performed in this order. [0047]<br>
The steps will be described in detail below.<br>
I. Hot Forging<br>
A semi-finished sub-gear, similar to that obtained after completion of the above step B, is obtained by works of cutting off a steel piece (thickness: 30 mm) from a round steel bar (diameter: 50 mm) a steel having the composition shown in Table 1, heating the steel piece to a temperature of 950°C, removing scales from the steel piece, stamping the steel piece by a high speed forging press, . removing burrs by a crank press, and shaping the steel piece thus stamped by the crank press, the works being sequentially performed in this order.<br><br>
II. Solution Treatment<br>
The semi-finished sub-gear is subjected to solution treatment by rapidly cooling the semi-finished sub-gear held at 910°C/ which is a hot forging ending temperature (solution treatment temperature TI).<br>
Subsequently, the semi-finished sub-gear is subjected to works similar to those described steps C, D, to obtain a sub-gear 6.  In addition, the treatment time "t" in the step D is set at 3 hr. The sub-gear 6 thus obtained exhibits a high bending fatigue strength comparative to those of Inventive Examples 1, 2.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention provides a gear having a high fatigue strength and a high dimensional accuracy. The gear is produced from a steel material which is excellent in plastic workability and machinability and which is capable of being subjected to soft nitriding serving as artificial aging after solution treatment.  In the steps of the producing the gear, artificial aging and soft nitriding step are simultaneously performed. As a result, it is possible to achieve energy saving and reduction in<br>
production cost, and hence to provide a relatively<br>
inexpensive gear.<br><br>
