				<td>OUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVES The invention concerns certain novel quinazoline derivatives, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which possess anti-tumour activity and are accordingly useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also concerns processes for the manufacture of said quinazoline derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutic methods, for example in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the prevention or treatment of solid tumour disease in a warm-blooded animal such as man. <br><br>
Many of the current treatment regimes for diseases resulting from the abnormal regulation of cellular proliferation such as psoriasis and cancer, utilise compounds that inhibit DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. To date, compounds used in such treatments are generally toxic to cells however their enhanced effects on rapidly dividing cells such as tumour cells can be beneficial. Alternative approaches to these cytotoxic anti-tumour agents are currently being developed, for example selective inhibitors of cell signalling pathways. <br><br>
These types of inhibitors are likely to have the potential to display an enhanced selectivity of action against tumour cells and so are likely to reduce the probability of the therapy possessing unwanted side effects. <br><br>
Eukaryotic cells are continually responding to many diverse extracellular signals that enable communication between cells within an organism. These signals regulate a wide variety of physical responses in the cell including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and motility. The extracellular signals take the form of a diverse variety of soluble factors including growth factors as well as paracrine and endocrine factors. By binding to specific transmembrane receptors, these ligands integrate the extracellular signal to the intracellular signalling pathways, therefore transducing the signal across the plasma membrane and allowing the individual cell to respond to its extracellular signals. Many of these signal transduction processes utilise the reversible process of the phosphorylation of proteins that are involved in the promotion of these diverse cellular responses. The phosphorylation status of target proteins is regulated by specific kinases and phosphatases that are responsible for the regulation of about one third of all proteins encoded by the mammalian genome. As phosphorylation is such an important regulatory mechanism in the signal transduction process, it is therefore not surprising that aberrations in these intracellular pathways result in abnormal cell growth and differentiation and so promote cellular transformation (reviewed in Cohen et al, Curr Opin Chem Biol, 1999, 3, 459-465). <br><br>
It has been widely shown that a number of these tyrosine kinases are mutated to constitutively active forms and/or when over-expressed result in the transformation of a variety of human cells. These mutated and over-expressed forms of the kinase are present in a large proportion of human tumours (reviewed in Kolibaba et al, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1997,133, F217-F248). As tyrosine kinases play fundamental roles in the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of tissues, much focus has centred on these enzymes in the development of novel anti-cancer therapies. This family of enzymes is divided into two groups-receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases e. g. EGF Receptors and the SRC family respectively. From the results of a large number of studies including the Human Genome Project, about 90 tyrosine kinase have been identified in the human genome, of this 58 are of the receptor type and 32 are of the non-receptor type. These can be compartmentalised in to 20 receptor tyrosine kinase and 10 non-receptor tyrosine kinase sub-families (Robinson et al, Oncogene, 2000,19, 5548-5557). <br><br>
The receptor tyrosine kinases are of particular importance in the transmission of mitogenic signals that initiate cellular replication. These large glycoproteins, which span the plasma membrane of the cell possess an extracellular binding domain for their specific ligands (such as Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) for the EGF Receptor). Binding of ligand results in the activation of the receptor's kinase enzymatic activity that is encoded by the intracellular portion of the receptor. This activity phosphorylates key tyrosine amino acids in target proteins, resulting in the transduction of proliferative signals across the plasma membrane of the cell. <br><br>
It is known that the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which include EGFR, erbB2, erbB3 and erbB4, are frequently involved in driving the proliferation and survival of tumour cells (reviewed in Olayioye et al., EMBO J., 2000, 19, 3159). One mechanism in which this can be accomplished is by overexpression of the receptor at the protein level, generally as a result of gene amplification. This has been observed in many common human cancers (reviewed in Klapper et al., Adv. Cancer Res., 2000, 77, 25) such as breast cancer (Sainsbury et al., Brit. J. Cancer, 1988, 58,458 ; Guerin et al., Oncogene Res., 1988,3, 21; Slamon et al., Science, 1989, 244, 707; Kliin et al., Breast Cancer Res. Treat., 1994,29, 73 and reviewed in Salomon et al. , Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hemato., 1995, 19, 183), non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) including adenocarcinomas (Cerny et al., Brit. J. Cancer, 1986, 54, 265; Reubi et al., Int. J. Cancer, 1990,45, 269; Rusch et al., Cancer Research, 1993,53, 2379; Brabender et al, Clin. Cancer Res., 2001,7, 1850) as well as other cancers of the lung (Hendler et al., Cancer Cells, 1989,7, 347; Ohsaki et al., Oncol. Rep., 2000,7, 603), bladder cancer (Neal et al., Lancet, 1985,366 ; Chow et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 2001,7, 1957, Zhau et al., Mol Carcinog., 3, 254), oesophageal cancer (Mukaida et al., Cancer, 1991,68, 142), gastrointestinal cancer such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer (Bolen et al., Oncogene Res., 1987, 1, 149; Kapitanovic et al., Gastroenteroloav. 2000, 112, 1103; Ross et al., Cancer Invest., 2001,19, 554), cancer of the prostate (Visakorpi et al. , Histochem. J., 1992,24, 481; Kumar et al., 2000,32, 73; Scher et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 2000,92, 1866), leukaemia (Konaka et al., Cell, 1984,37, 1035, Martin-Subero et al., Cancer Genet Cytogenet., 2001, 127, 174), ovarian (Hellstrom et al., Cancer Res., 2001, 61, 2420), head and neck (Shiga et al., Head Neck, 2000,22, 599) or pancreatic cancer (Ovotny et al., Neoplasm, 2001,48, 188). As more human tumour tissues are tested for expression of the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases it is expected that their widespread prevalence and importance will be further enhanced in the future. <br><br>
As a consequence of the mis-regulation of one or more of these receptors, it is widely believed that many tumours become clinically more aggressive and so correlate with a poorer prognosis for the patient (Brabender et al, Clin. Cancer Res., 2001,7, 1850; Ross et al, Cancer Investigation, 2001,19, 554, Yu et al., Bioessavs, 2000,22. 7, 673). In addition to these clinical findings, a wealth of pre-clinical information suggests that the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in cellular transformation. This includes the observations that many tumour cell lines overexpress one or more of the erbB receptors and that EGFR or erbB2 when transfected into non-tumour cells have the ability to transform these cells. This tumourigenic potential has been further verified as transgenic mice that overexpress erbB2 spontaneously develop tumours in the mammary gland. In addition to this, a number of pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that anti-proliferative effects can be induced by knocking out one or more erbB activities by small molecule inhibitors, dominant negatives or inhibitory antibodies (reviewed in Mendelsohn et al., Oncogene, 2000,19, 6550). Thus it has been recognised that inhibitors of these receptor tyrosine kinases should be of value as a selective inhibitor of the proliferation of mammalian cancer cells (Yaish et al. Science, 1988, 242,933, Kolibaba et al, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1997, 133, F217-F248; Al-Obeidi et al, 2000, Oncogene, 19,5690-5701 ; Mendelsohn et al, 2000, Oncogene, 19,6550-6565). In addition to this pre-clinical data, findings using inhibitory antibodies against EGFR and erbB2 (c-225 and trastuzumab respectively) have proven to be beneficial in the clinic for the treatment of selected solid tumours (reviewed in Mendelsohn et al, 2000, Oncogene, 19, 6550-6565). <br><br>
Amplification and/or activity of members of the erbB type receptor tyrosine kinases have been detected and so have been implicated to play a role in a number of non-malignant proliferative disorders such as psoriasis (Ben-Bassat, Curr. Pharm. Des. , 2000,6, 933; Elder et al., Science, 1989, 243, 811), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Kumar et al., Int. Urol. <br><br>
Nephrol. , 2000,32, 73), atherosclerosis and restenosis (Bokemeyer et al., Kidney Int. , 2000, 58,549). It is therefore expected that inhibitors of erbB type receptor tyrosine kinases will be useful in the treatment of these and other non-malignant disorders of excessive cellular proliferation. <br><br>
European patent application EP 566 226 discloses certain 4-anilinoquinazolines that are receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. <br><br>
International patent applications WO 96/33977, WO 96/33978, WO 96/33979, WO 96/33980, WO 96/33981, WO 97/30034 and WO 97/38994 disclose that certain quinazoline derivatives which bear an anilino substituent at the 4-position and a substituent at the 6- and/or 7-position possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. <br><br>
European patent application EP 837 063 discloses aryl substituted 4-aminoquinazoline derivatives carrying a moiety containing an aryl or heteroaryl group at the 6-or 7-position on the quinazoline ring. The compounds are stated to be useful for treating hyperproliferative disorders. <br><br>
International patent applications WO 97/30035 and WO 98/13354 disclose certain 4-anilinoquinazolines substituted at the 7-position are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. <br><br>
WO 00/55141 discloses 6, 7-substituted 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds characterised in that the substituents at the 6-and/or 7-position carry an ester linked moiety (RO-CO). <br><br>
WO 00/56720 discloses 6,7-dialkoxy-4-anilinoquinazoline compounds for the treatment of cancer or allergic reactions. <br><br>
WO 02/41882 discloses 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds substituted at the 6-and/or 7-position by a substituted pyrrolidinyl-alkoxy or piperidinyl-alkoxy group. <br><br>
WO 03/082290 discloses that certain 6,7-substituted 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity. A specific example of such a compound is 6- { [1- (N-methylcarbamoylmethyl) piperidin-4-yl] oxy}-4- (3-chloro-4-fluoroanilino) - 7-methoxy-quinazoline. <br><br>
None of the prior art discloses 4- (2, 3-dihalogenoanilino) quinazoline or 4- (2, 3,4- trihalogenoanilino) quinazoline compounds. <br><br>
Copending International Patent Application No. PCT/GB03/01306 describes that certain 4- (2, 3-dihalogenoanilino) quinazoline derivatives possess potent anti-tumour activity, and in particular are selective against EGFR. A specific example of such a compound is 6- { [l- (carbamoylmethyl) piperidin-4-yl] methoxy}-4- (3-chloro-2-fluoroanilino)-7-methoxy- quinazoline. <br><br>
The applicants have surprisingly found however that addition of a substituent to the carbamoyl group and, optionally, adding a further substituent to the aniline group produces a select group of compounds with enhanced activity in that the compounds have a dual activity, being particularly effected as erbB2 kinase inhibitors, whilst retaining the EGF inhibitory effect, making them of particular clinical application in the treatment of tumours where both these kinases are implicated. <br><br>
Without wishing to imply that the compounds disclosed in the present invention possess pharmacological activity only by virtue of an effect on a single biological process, it is believed that the compounds provide an anti-tumour effect by way of inhibition of two of the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in the signal transduction steps which lead to the proliferation of tumour cells. In particular, it is believed that the compounds of the present invention provide an anti-tumour effect by way of inhibition of EGFR and/or erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinases. <br><br>

In this specification the generic term"alkyl"includes both straight-chain and branched-chain alkyl groups such as propyl, isopropyl and tert-butyl, and (3-7C) cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. However references to individual alkyl groups such as"propyl"are specific for the straight-chain version only, references to individual branched-chain alkyl groups such as"isopropyl"are specific for the branched-chain version only and references to individual cycloalkyl groups such as"cyclopentyl"are specific for that 5-membered ring only. An analogous convention applies to other generic terms, for example (1-6C) alkoxy includes methoxy, ethoxy, cyclopropyloxy and cyclopentyloxy, (1-6C) alkylamino includes methylamino, ethylamino, cyclobutylamino and cyclohexylamino, and di- [ (l-6Calkyl] amino includes dimethylamino, diethylamino, N-cyclobutyl-N-methylamino and N-cyclohexyl-N-ethylamino. <br><br>
The term"aryl"refers to aromatic hydrocarbon rings such as phenyl or naphthyl.

Where rings include nitrogen atoms, these may carry a hydrogen atom or a substituent group such as an (1-6C) alkyl group if required to fulfil the bonding requirements of nitrogen, or they may be linked to the rest of the structure by way of the nitrogen atom. A nitrogen atom within a heterocyclyl group may be oxidized to give the corresponding N oxide. <br><br>

Particular examples include piperidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, morpholinyl or thiomorpholino. Alternatively, R6 and R7 together form a (3-6C) alkenyl group. <br><br>

In one aspect of the invention, when n is 2, the first R group is suitably at a meta- position and the second R5 group is suitably at an ortho-or a para-position on the benzene ring, and thus the ring has substituents at 2-and 3-or 3-and 4-positions on the benzene ring. <br><br>

Thus, when n is 2, the ring suitably has substituents at 2-and 3-positions on the benzene ring and when n is 3, the ring suitably has substituents at 2-, 3-and 4-positions on the benzene ring. <br><br>
The applicants have surprisingly found that quinazoline derivatives having substituents (for example halogeno substituents) at 2-and 3-positions or at 2-, 3-and 4- positions on the benzene ring compared to quinazoline derivatives having substituents at 3- and 4-positions on the benzene ring produces compounds with enhanced activity in that the compounds have an increased potency againsterbB2 and/or EGFR (particularly erbB2) receptor tyrosine kinases in cellular assays. It is believed that quinazoline derivatives having substituents (for example halogeno substituents) at 2-and 3-positions or at 2-, 3-and 4- positions on the benzene ring will also have an increased potency against erbB2 and/or EGFR (particularly erbB2) receptor tyrosine kinases in vivo. <br><br>

Synthesis of Quinazoline Derivatives of the Formula I A further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing a quinazoline derivative of Formula I or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof. It will be appreciated that during certain of the following processes certain substituents may require protection to prevent their undesired reaction. The skilled chemist will appreciate when such protection is required, and how such protecting groups may be put in place, and later removed. <br><br>
For examples of protecting groups see one of the many general texts on the subject, for example,'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis'by Theodora Green (publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons). Protecting groups may be removed by any convenient method as described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist as appropriate for the removal of the protecting group in question, such methods being chosen so as to effect removal of the protecting group with minimum disturbance of groups elsewhere in the molecule.  <br><br>
Thus, if reactants include, for example, groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein. <br><br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a t-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris (trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine. <br><br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium, sodium hydroxide or ammonia. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon. <br><br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a t-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon. <br><br>
Resins may also be used as a protecting group. <br><br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art. <br><br>
A quinazoline derivative of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compounds. Such processes, when used to prepare a quinazoline derivative of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, are provided as a further feature of the invention and are illustrated by the following representative examples. <br><br>
Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry (see, for example, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Wiley-Interscience), Jerry March). The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting Examples. Alternatively, necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist. Information on the preparation of necessary starting materials or related compounds (which may be adapted to form necessary starting materials) may also be found in the following Patent and Application Publications, the contents of the relevant process sections of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference: WO 94/27965, WO 95/03283, WO 96/33977, WO 96/33978, WO 96/33979, WO 96/33980, WO 96/33981, WO 97/30034, WO 97/38994, WO 01/66099, US 5,252, 586, EP 520 722, EP 566 226, EP 602 851 and EP 635 507. <br><br>
The present invention also provides that quinazoline derivatives of the Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be prepared by a process (a) to (m) as follows (wherein the variables are as defined above unless otherwise stated) : Process (a) By reacting a compound of the Formula II : wherein R', Xl, R5 and n have any of the meanings defined hereinbefore except that any functional group is protected if necessary, with a compound of the Formula III : wherein R R3 and m have any of the meanings defined hereinbefore except that any functional group is protected if necessary and Lg is a displaceable group, wherein the reaction is conveniently performed in the presence of a suitable base, and whereafter any protecting group that is present is removed by conventional means. <br><br>
A convenient displaceable group Lg is, for example, a halogeno, alkanesulfonyloxy or arylsulfonyloxy group, for example a chloro, bromo, methanesulfonyloxy, 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy or toluene-4-sulfonyloxy group (suitably a methanesulfonyloxy, 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy or toluene-4-sulfonyloxy group). <br><br>
The reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of base. A suitable base is, for example, an organic amine base such as, for example, di-isopropylethylamine, pyridine, 2, 6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclo [5.4. 0] undec-7-ene, or for example, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydroxide, for example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Alternatively such a base is, for example, an alkali metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal amide, for example sodium amide or sodium bis (trimethylsilyl) amide, or a sufficiently basic alkali metal halide, for example cesium fluoride or sodium iodide. The reaction is suitably effected in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent, for example an alkanol or ester such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol or ethyl acetate, a halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, trichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxan, an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, or (suitably) a dipolar aprotic solvent such as N, N-dimethylformamide, N, N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimethylsulfoxide. The reaction is conveniently effected at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 150°C (or the boiling point of the solvent), suitably in the range 20 to 90°C. <br><br>
A particularly suitable base is cesium fluoride. This reaction is suitably performed in an inert dipolar aprotic solvent such as N, N-dimethylacetamide or N, N-dimethylformamide. <br><br>
The reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature of from 25 to 85°C. <br><br>
Process (b) By modifying a substituent in or introducing a substituent into another quinazoline derivative of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as hereinbefore defined except that any functional group is protected if necessary, and whereafter any protecting group that is present is removed by conventional means. <br><br>
Methods for converting substituents into other substituents are known in the art. For example an alkylthio group may be oxidised to an alkylsulfinyl or alkylsulfonyl group, a cyano group reduced to an amino group, a nitro group reduced to an amino group, a hydroxy group alkylated to a methoxy group, a bromo group converted to an alkylthio group, an amino group may be acylated to give an alkanoylamino group (for example by reaction with a suitable acid chloride or acid anhydride) or an alkanoyloxy group may be hydrolysed to a hydroxy group (for example an acetyloxyacetyl group may be converted to a hydroxyacetyl group). Conveniently, one R'group may be converted into another R'group as a final step in the preparation of a compound of the Formula I. <br><br>
Process (c) By reacting a compound of Formula IV: where R', Xl, R and n are as defined in relation to Formula I except that any functional group is protected if necessary, with a compound of Formula V or V' : wherein R2 and R3 are as defined above except that any functional group is protected if necessary and m'is 0,1, 2 or 3, provided that it is not 0 when R2 is hydrogen, and Lg is a displaceable group (for example halogeno such as chloro or bromo). <br><br>
The reactions described above are conveniently performed in the presence of a suitable base (such as those described above in process (a), for example potassium carbonate, triethylamine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine or di-isopropylethylamine) and conveniently in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent (for example the inert solvents and diluents described in process (a) such as N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, acetonitrile, N, N-dimethylacetamide, methanol, ethanol or methylene chloride). <br><br>
Where m'is 1, 2 or 3, the reaction is suitably effected in the presence of a source of iodide such as sodium iodide or potassium iodide, and at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 150°C (or the boiling point of the solvent), suitably in the range 20 to 90°C. <br><br>
For example, when m is 1, the reaction may be conducted using triethylamine as a suitable base, potassium iodide as a suitable iodide source and N, N-dimethylacetamide as a suitable solvent or diluent at a temperature of about 80°C. <br><br>
Where m is 0 the iodide source is not required and the typical temperature for the reaction is 0°C to room temperature. <br><br>
Reaction of the compound of Formula IV with a compound of Formula V'is useful for preparing compounds where R2 is hydrogen and m is 0. <br><br>
Process (d) By removal of a protecting group from a quinazoline derivative of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. <br><br>
Suitable methods for removal of protecting groups are well known and are discussed herein. For example for the production of those compounds of the Formula I wherein R' contains a primary or secondary amino group, the cleavage of the corresponding compound of Formula I wherein R'contains a protected primary or secondary amino group. <br><br>
Suitable protecting groups for an amino group are, for example, any of the protecting groups disclosed hereinbefore for an amino group. Suitable methods for the cleavage of such amino protecting groups are also disclosed hereinbefore. In particular, a suitable protecting group is a lower alkoxycarbonyl group such as a tert-butoxycarbonyl group which may be cleaved under conventional reaction conditions such as under acid-catalysed hydrolysis, for example in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. <br><br>
Process (e) By reacting a compound of the Formula II as hereinbefore defined with a compound of the Formula III as defined hereinbefore except Lg is OH under Mitsunobu conditions, and whereafter any protecting group that is present is removed by conventional means. <br><br>
Suitable Mitsunobu conditions include, for example, reaction in the presence of a suitable tertiary phosphine and a di-alkylazodicarboxylate in an organic solvent such as THF, or suitably dichloromethane and in the temperature range 0°C to 60°C, but suitably at ambient temperature. A suitable tertiary phosphine includes for example tri-n-butylphosphine or suitably tri-phenylphosphine. A suitable di-alkylazodicarboxylate includes for example diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) or suitably di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate. Details of Mitsunobu reactions are contained in Tet. Letts. , 31,699, (1990); The Mitsunobu Reaction, D. L. Hughes, Organic Reactions, 1992, Vol. 42,335-656 and Progress in the Mitsunobu Reaction, D. L. Hughes, Organic Preparations and Procedures International, 1996, Vol. 28, 127-164. <br><br>
Process (f) For the preparation of those compounds of the Formula I wherein R'-X'is a hydroxy group by the cleavage of a quinazoline derivative of the Formula I wherein Rl-Xl is a (1-6C) alkoxy group. <br><br>
The cleavage reaction may conveniently be carried out by any of the many procedures known for such a transformation. The cleavage reaction of a compound of the Formula I wherein R'is a (1-6C) alkoxy group may be carried out, for example, by treatment of the quinazoline derivative with an alkali metal (1-6C) alkylsulfide such as sodium ethanethiolate or, for example, by treatment with an alkali metal diarylphosphide such as lithium diphenylphosphide. Alternatively the cleavage reaction may conveniently be carried out, for example, by treatment of the quinazoline derivative with a boron or aluminium trihalide such as boron tribromide, or by reaction with an organic or inorganic acid, for example trifluoroacetic acid. Such reactions are suitably carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent or diluent as defined hereinbefore. A preferred cleavage reaction is the treatment of a quinazoline derivative of the Formula I with pyridine hydrochloride. The cleavage reactions are suitably carried out at a temperature in the range, for example, from 10 to 150°C, for example from 25 to 80°C. <br><br>
Process (g) For the preparation of those compounds of the Formula I wherein Xl is O and Rl is not hydrogen, by the reaction of a compound of the Formula VI: wherein R2, R3, R5, m and n have any of the meanings defined hereinbefore except that any functional group is protected if necessary, with a compound of the formula R'-Lg, wherein R' has any of the meanings defined hereinbefore except that it is not hydrogen and except that any functional group is protected if necessary and Lg is a displaceable group, wherein the reaction is conveniently performed in the presence of a suitable base; and whereafter any protecting group that is present is removed by conventional means. <br><br>
Suitable displaceable groups, Lg, are as hereinbefore defined for process (a), for example chloro or bromo. The reaction is suitably performed in the presence of a suitable base. Suitable solvents, diluents and bases include, for example those hereinbefore described in relation to process (a). Alternatively, Lg is a hydroxy group, whereupon the reaction can be effected under Mitsunobu conditions, as described above in relation to process (e). <br><br>

A suitable alkylating agent is, for example, any agent known in the art for the alkylation of hydroxy to alkoxy or substituted alkoxy, or for the alkylation of amino to alkylamino or substituted alkylamino, for example an alkyl or substituted alkyl halide, for example a (1-6C) alkyl chloride, bromide or iodide or a substituted (1-6C) alkyl chloride, bromide or iodide, conveniently in the presence of a suitable base as defined hereinbefore, in a suitable inert solvent or diluent as defined hereinbefore and at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 140°C, conveniently at or near ambient temperature.

Recombinant intracellular fragments of EGFR, erbB2 and erbB4 (accession numbers X00588, X03363 and L07868 respectively) were cloned and expressed in the baculovirus/Sf21 system. Lysates were prepared from these cells by treatment with ice-cold lysis buffer (20mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperizine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH7. 5, 150mM NaCI, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1. 5mM MgCl2, 1mM ethylene glycol-bis ((3-aminoethyl ether) N', N', N', N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), plus protease inhibitors and then cleared by centrifugation. <br><br>
Constitutive kinase activity of the recombinant protein was determined by its ability to phosphorylate a synthetic peptide (made up of a random co-polymer of Glutamic Acid, Alanine and Tyrosine in the ratio of 6: 3: 1). Specifically, Maxisorb 96-well immunoplates were coated with synthetic peptide (0. 2g of peptide in a 100y1 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and incubated at 4°C overnight). Plates were washed in PBS-T (phosphate buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20) then in 50mM HEPES pH 7.4 at room temperature to remove any excess unbound synthetic peptide. EGFR, ErbB2 or ErbB4 tyrosine kinase activity was assessed by incubation in peptide coated plates for 20 minutes at 22°C in 100mM HEPES pH 7.4, adenosine trisphosphate (ATP) at Km concentration for the respective enzyme, 10mM MnCl2, O. lmM Na3VO4, 0.2mM DL-dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% Triton X-100 with test compound in DMSO (final concentration of 2.5%). Reactions were terminated by the removal of the liquid components of the assay followed by washing of the plates with PBS-T. <br><br>
The immobilised phospho-peptide product of the reaction was detected by immunological methods. Firstly, plates were incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature with anti-phosphotyrosine primary antibodies that were raised in the mouse (4G10 from Upstate Biotechnology). Following extensive washing, plates were treated with Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (NXA931 from Amersham) for 60 minutes at room temperature. After further washing, HRP activity in each well of the plate was measured colorimetrically using 22'-Azino-di- [3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (6) ] diammonium salt crystals (ABOTS from Roche) as a substrate. <br><br>
Quantification of colour development and thus enzyme activity was achieved by the measurement of absorbance at 405nm on a Molecular Devices ThermoMax microplate reader. <br><br>
Kinase inhibition for a given compound was expressed as an IC50 value. This was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was required to give 50% inhibition of phosphorylation in this assay. The range of phosphorylation was calculated from the positive (vehicle plus ATP) and negative (vehicle minus ATP) control values. b) EGFR driven KB cell proliferation assay This assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the proliferation of KB cells (human naso-pharangeal carcinoma obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). <br><br>
KB cells (human naso-pharangeal carcinoma obtained from the ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% foetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine and non-essential amino acids at 37°C in a 7.5% C02 air incubator. Cells were harvested from the stock flasks using Trypsin/ethylaminediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). <br><br>
Cell density was measured using a haemocytometer and viability was calculated using trypan blue solution before being seeded at a density of 1. 25x103 cells per well of a 96 well plate in DMEM containing 2.5% charcoal stripped serum, 1mM glutamine and non-essential amino acids at 37°C in 7.5% CO2 and allowed to settle for 4 hours. <br><br>
Following adhesion to the plate, the cells are treated with or without EGF (final concentration of lng/ml) and with or without compound at a range of concentrations in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (0.1% final) before incubation for 4 days. Following the incubation period, cell numbers were determined by addition of 501l1 of 3- (4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (stock 5mg/ml) for 2 hours. MTT solution was then tipped off, the plate gently tapped dry and the cells dissolved upon the addition of 100tl of DMSO. <br><br>
Absorbance of the solubilised cells was read at 540nm using a Molecular Devices ThermoMax microplate reader. Inhibition of proliferation was expressed as an ICso value. <br><br>
This was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was required to give 50% inhibition of proliferation. The range of proliferation was calculated from the positive (vehicle plus EGF) and negative (vehicle minus EGF) control values. c) In vivo Xenograft assays (i) LOVO This assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth of a LoVo tumour (colorectal adenocarcinoma obtained from the ATCC) in Female Swiss athymic mice (Alderley Park, nulnu genotype). <br><br>
Female Swiss athymic (nu/nu genotype) mice were bred and maintained in Alderley Park in negative pressure Isolators (PFI Systems Ltd. ). Mice were housed in a barrier facility with 12hr light/dark cycles and provided with sterilised food and water ad libitum. All procedures were performed on mice of at least 8 weeks of age. LoVo tumour cell (colorectal adenocarcinoma obtained from the ATCC) xenografts were established in the hind flank of donor mice by sub cutaneous injections of lux107 freshly cultured cells in 100F1 of serum free media per animal. On day 5 post-implant, mice were randomised into groups of 7 prior to the treatment with compound or vehicle control that was administered once daily at 0. lml/lOg body weight. Tumour volume was assessed twice weekly by bilateral Vernier calliper measurement, using the formula (length x width) x (length x width) x (n/6), where length was the longest diameter across the tumour, and width was the corresponding perpendicular. <br><br>
Growth inhibition from start of study was calculated by comparison of the mean changes in tumour volume for the control and treated groups, and statistical significance between the two groups was evaluated using a Students t test. <br><br>

(1998) Cancer Research, 58,2825-2831). <br><br>
Female Swiss athymic (nulnu genotype) mice were bred and maintained in Alderley Park in negative pressure Isolators (PFI Systems Ltd. ). Mice were housed in a barrier facility with 12hr light/dark cycles and provided with sterilised food and water ad libitum. All procedures were performed on mice of at least 8 weeks of age. BT-474 tumour cell xenografts were established in the hind flank of donor mice by sub-cutaneous injections of 1x107 freshly cultured cells in lOOgI of serum free media with 50% Matrigel per animal. On day 14 post-implant, mice were randomised into groups of 10 prior to the treatment with compound or vehicle control that was administered once daily at O. lml/kg body weight. <br><br>
Tumour volume was assessed twice weekly by bilateral Vernier calliper measurement, using the formula (length x width) x (length x width) x (7v/6), where length was the longest diameter across the tumour, and width was the corresponding perpendicular. Growth inhibition from start of treatment was calculated by comparison of the mean changes in tumour volume for the control and treated groups, and statistical significance between the two groups was evaluated using a Students t test. d) hERG-encoded Potassium Channel Inhibition Assay This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the tail current flowing through the human ether-a-go-go-related-gene (hERG) -encoded potassium channel. <br><br>
Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing the hERG-encoded channel were grown in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (EMEM; Sigma-Aldrich catalogue number M2279), supplemented with 10% Foetal Calf Serum (Labtech International; product number 4-101-500), 10% MI serum-free supplement (Egg Technologies; product number 70916) and 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin G418 (Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue number G7034). One or two days before each experiment, the cells were detached from the tissue culture flasks with Accutase (TCS Biologicals) using standard tissue culture methods. They were then put onto glass coverslips resting in wells of a 12 well plate and covered with 2 ml of the growing media. <br><br>
For each cell recorded, a glass coverslip containing the cells was placed at the bottom of a Perspex chamber containing bath solution (see below) at room temperature (-20 °C). <br><br>
This chamber was fixed to the stage of an inverted, phase-contrast microscope. Immediately after placing the coverslip in the chamber, bath solution was perfused into the chamber from a gravity-fed reservoir for 2 minutes at a rate of-2 ml/min. After this time, perfusion was stopped. <br><br>
A patch pipette made from borosilicate glass tubing (GC120F, Harvard Apparatus) using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co. ) was filled with pipette solution (see hereinafter). The pipette was connected to the headstage of the patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments) via a silver/silver chloride wire. The headstage ground was connected to the earth electrode. This consisted of a silver/silver chloride wire embedded in 3% agar made up with 0.85% sodium chloride. <br><br>
The cell was recorded in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. <br><br>
Following"break-in", which was done at a holding potential of-80 mV (set by the amplifier), and appropriate adjustment of series resistance and capacitance controls, electrophysiology software (Clampex, Axon Instruments) was used to set a holding potential (-80 mV) and to deliver a voltage protocol. This protocol was applied every 15 seconds and consisted of a 1 s step to +40 mV followed by a 1 s step to-50 mV. <br><br>
The current response to each imposed voltage protocol was low pass filtered by the amplifier at 1 kHz. The filtered signal was then acquired, on line, by digitising this analogue signal from the amplifier with an analogue to digital converter. The digitised signal was then captured on a computer running Clampex software (Axon Instruments). During the holding potential and the step to + 40 mV the current was sampled at 1 kHz. The sampling rate was then set to 5 kHz for the remainder of the voltage protocol. <br><br>
The compositions, pH and osmolarity of the bath and pipette solution are tabulated below. Salt Pipette (mM) Bath (mM) NaC]-137 KCI 130 4 MgC12 1 1 CaCl2 1. 8 HEPES 10 10 glucose-10 Na2ATP 5- EGTA 5 Parameter Pipette Bath pH 7.18-7. 22 7.40 pH adjustment with 1M KOH 1M NaOH Osmolarity (mOsm) 275-285 285-295 The amplitude of the hERG-encoded potassium channel tail current following the step from +40 mV to-50 mV was recorded on-line by Clampex software (Axon Instruments). <br><br>
Following stabilisation of the tail current amplitude, bath solution containing the vehicle for the test substance was applied to the cell. Providing the vehicle application had no significant effect on tail current amplitude, a cumulative concentration effect curve to the compound was then constructed. <br><br>
The effect of each concentration of test compound was quantified by expressing the tail current amplitude in the presence of a given concentration of test compound as a percentage of that in the presence of vehicle. <br><br>
Test compound potency (ICso) was determined by fitting the percentage inhibition values making up the concentration-effect to a four parameter Hill equation using a standard data-fitting package. If the level of inhibition seen at the highest test concentration did not exceed 50%, no potency value was produced and a percentage inhibition value at that concentration was quoted. e) Clone 24 phospho-erbB2 cell assay This immunofluorescence end point assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the phosphorylation of erbB2 in a MCF7 (breast carcinoma) derived cell line which was generated by transfecting MCF7 cells with the full length erbB2 gene using standard methods to give a cell line that overexpresses full length wild type erbB2 protein (hereinafter 'Clone 24'cells). <br><br>
Clone 24 cells were cultured in Growth Medium (phenol red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and 1. 2mg/ml G418) in a 7.5% C02 air incubator at 37°C. Cells were harvested from T75 stock flasks by washing once in PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH7.4, Gibco No. <br><br>
10010-015) and harvested using 2mls of Trypsin (1. 25mg/ml)/ethylaminediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.8mg/ml) solution. The cells were resuspended in Growth Medium. Cell density was measured using a haemocytometer and viability was calculated using Trypan Blue solution before being further diluted in Growth Medium and seeded at a density of 1x104 cells per well (in 100ul) into clear bottomed 96 well plates (Packard, No. 6005182). <br><br>
3 days later, Growth Medium was removed from the wells and replaced with 100ul Assay Medium (phenol red free DMEM, 2mM glutamine, 1. 2mg/ml G418) either with or without erbB inhibitor compound. Plates were returned to the incubator for 4hrs and then 20RI of 20% formaldehyde solution in PBS was added to each well and the plate was left at room temperature for 30 minutes. This fixative solution was removed with a multichannel pipette, 100tl of PBS was added to each well and then removed with a multichannel pipette and then 50ruz PBS was added to each well. Plates were then sealed and stored for up to 2 weeks at 4°C. <br><br>
Immunostaining was performed at room temperature. Wells were washed once with 200R1 PBS/Tween 20 (made by adding 1 sachet of PBS/Tween dry powder (Sigma, No. <br><br>
P3563) to 1L of double distilled H20) using a plate washer then 200R1 Blocking Solution (5% Marvel dried skimmed milk (Nestle) in PBS/Tween 20) was added and incubated for 10 minutes. Blocking Solution was removed using a plate washer and 20ors of 0. 5% Triton X-100/PBS was added to permeabalise the cells. After 10 minutes, the plate was washed with 200ut PBS/Tween 20 and then 200ut Blocking Solution was added once again and incubated for 15 minutes. Following removal of the Blocking Solution with a plate washer, 30µl of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho ErbB2 IgG antibody (epitope phospho-Tyr 1248, SantaCruz, No. SC-12352-R), diluted 1: 250 in Blocking Solution, was added to each well and incubated for 2 hours. Then this primary antibody solution was removed from the wells using a plate washer followed by two 200ut PBS/Tween 20 washes using a plate washer. Then 30, u1 of Alexa-Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, No. <br><br>
A-11008), diluted 1: 750 in Blocking Solution, was added to each well. From now onwards, wherever possible, plates were protected from light exposure, at this stage by sealing with black backing tape. The plates were incubated for 45 minutes and then the secondary antibody solution was removed from the wells followed by two 200ul PBS/Tween 20 washes using a plate washer. Then 100Oul PBS was added to each plate, incubated for 10 minutes and then removed using a plate washer. Then a further 10ORI PBS was added to each plate and then, without prolonged incubation, removed using a plate washer. Then 50RI of PBS was added to each well and plates were resealed with black backing tape and stored for up to 2 days at 4°C before analysis. <br><br>
The Fluorescence signal is each well was measured using an Acumen Explorer Instrument (Acumen Bioscience Ltd. ), a plate reader that can be used to rapidly quantitate features of images generated by laser-scanning. The instrument was set to measure the number of fluorescent objects above a pre-set threshold value and this provided a measure of the phosphorylation status of erbB2 protein. Fluorescence dose response data obtained with each compound was exported into a suitable software package (such as Origin) to perform curve fitting analysis. Inhibition of erbB2 phosphorylation was expressed as an ICso value. <br><br>
This was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was required to give 50% inhibition of erbB2 phosphorylation signal. <br><br>
Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the Formula I vary with structural change as expected, in general activity possessed by compounds of the Formula I, may be demonstrated at the following concentrations or doses in one or more of the above tests:- Test (a) :- IC50 in the range, for example, 0. 001-10 uM ; Test (b) :- ICso in the range, for example, 0.001-10 HM ; Test (e) :-IC50 in the range, for example, 0.001-10 ttM ; Test (c) :- activity in the range, for example, 1-200 mg/kg/day ; By way of example, Table A illustrates the activity of representative compounds according to the invention.

The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intramuscular dosing or as a suppository for rectal dosing). <br><br>
The compositions of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using conventional pharmaceutical excipients, well known in the art. Thus, compositions intended for oral use may contain, for example, one or more colouring, sweetening, flavouring and/or preservative agents. <br><br>
The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the particular route of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans will generally contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of active agent (more suitably from 0.5 to 100 mg, for example from 1 to 30 mg) compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of excipients which may vary from about 5 to about 98 percent by weight of the total composition. <br><br>
The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a compound of the Formula I will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine. <br><br>
In using a compound of the Formula I for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes it will generally be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, 0.1 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg body weight is received, given if required in divided doses. In general lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous administration, a dose in the range, for example, 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg body weight will generally be used. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range, for example, 0.05 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg body weight will be used. Oral administration is however preferred, particularly in tablet form. Typically, unit dosage forms will contain about 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of a compound of this invention. <br><br>
We have found that the compounds of the present invention possess anti-proliferative properties such as anti-cancer properties that are believed to arise from their erbB family receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity, and particularly a mixed erbB2/EGF profile. <br><br>
Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions mediated alone or in part by erbB receptor tyrosine kinases, i. e. the compounds may be used to produce an erbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory effect in a warm-blooded animal in need of such treatment. Thus the compounds of the present invention provide a method for the treatment of malignant cells characterised by inhibition of one or more of the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Particularly the compounds of the invention may be used to produce an anti-proliferative and/or pro-apoptotic and/or anti-invasive effect mediated alone or in part by the inhibition of erbB receptor tyrosine kinases. Particularly, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the prevention or treatment of those tumours that are sensitive to inhibition of one or more of the erbB receptor tyrosine kinases, that are involved in the signal transduction steps which drive proliferation and survival of these tumour cells. Accordingly the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of psoriasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), atherosclerosis and restenosis and/or cancer by providing an anti-proliferative effect, particularly in the treatment of erbB receptor tyrosine kinase sensitive cancers. Such benign or malignant tumours may affect any tissue and include non-solid tumours such as leukaemia, multiple myeloma or lymphom, and also solid tumours, for example bile duct, bone, bladder, brain/CNS, breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, head and neck, hepatic, lung, neuronal, oesophageal, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, renal, skin, testicular, thyroid, uterine and vulval cancers. <br><br>
