				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to pyrrole compounds substituted with i) a heteroaryl ring and ii) another heteroaryl or aryl ring with at least one of the rings being further substituted with another ring. In particular, this invention is directed to pyrrole compounds substituted directly, or by a bridge, with i) a heteroaryl moiety containing N adjacent to the point of connection of the heteroaryl and ii) another heteroaryl or aryl ring, with at least one of the rings being further substituted with another ring, which are metabotropic glutamate receptor - subtype 5 ("mGluR5") modulators useful in the treatment of psychiatric and mood disorders such as, for example, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, panic, bipolar disorder, and circadian rhythm disorders, as well as in the treatment of pain, Parkinson's disease, cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy, drug addiction, drug abuse, drug withdrawal, obesity and other diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system is the glutamate molecule, which binds to neurons, thereby activating cell surface receptors. Such surface receptors are characterized as either ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors. The metabotropic glutamate receptors ("mGluR") are G protein-coupled receptors that activate intracellular second messenger systems when bound to glutamate. Activation of mGluR results in a variety of cellular responses. In particular, mGluRl and mGluR5 activate phospholipase C, which is followed by mobilizing intracellular calcium.<br>
Modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) is useful in the treatment of diseases that affect the nervous system (see for example W.P.J.M Spooren et al., Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 22:331-337 (2001) and references cited therein). For example, recent evidence demonstrates the involvement of mGluR5 in nociceptive processes and that modulation of mGluR5 using mGluR5-selective compounds is useful in the treatment of various pain states, including acute, persistent and chronic pain [K Walker et al., Neuropharmacology, 40:1-9 (2001); F. Bordi, A. Ugolini Brain Res., 871:223-233 (2001)], inflammatory pain [K Walker et<br><br>
al., Neuroplicmnacology, 40:10-19 (2001); Bhave et al. Nature Neurosci. 4:417-423 (2001)] and neuropathic pain [Dogrul et al. Neurosci. Lett. 292:115-118 (2000)].<br>
Further evidence supports the use of modulators of mGluR5 in the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders. For example, mGluRS-selective compounds such as 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine ("MPEP") are effective in animal models of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression [W.P.J.M Spooren et al., /. Phannacol. Exp. TJier., 295:1267-1275 (2000); E. Tatarczynska et al, Brit. J. Phannacol., 132:1423-1430 (2001); A. Klodzynska et al, Pol. J. Phannacol., 132:1423-1430 (2001)]. Gene expression data from humans indicate that modulation of mGluR5 may be useful for the treatment of schizophrenia [T. Ohnuma et al, Mol. Brain. Res., 56:207-217 (1998); ibid, Mol Brain. Res., 85:24-31 (2000)]. Studies have also shown a role for mGluRS, and the potential utility of mGluR5-modulatory compounds, in the treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease [W.P.J.M Spooren et al., Europ. J. Phannacol. 406:403-410 (2000); H. Awad et al., J. Neurosci. 20:7871-7879 (2000); K. Ossawa et al. Neuropharmacol 41:413-420 (2001)]. Other research supports a role for mGluR5 modulation in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction [G. Riedel et al, Neuropharmacol. 39:1943-1951 (2000)], epilepsy [A. Chapman et al, Neuropharmacol. 39:1567-1574 (2000)] and neuroprotection [V. Bruno et al, Neurophannacol. 39:2223-2230 (2000)]. Studies with mGluRS knockout mice and MPEP also suggest that modulation of these receptors may be useful in the treatment of drug addiction, drug abuse and drug withdrawal [C. Chiamulera et al. Nature Neurosci. 4:873-874 (2001)].<br>
International Patent Publications WO 01/12627 and WO 99/26927 describe heteropolycyclic compounds and their use as metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,647,809 describes pyridyl-l,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives. U.S. Patent No. 4,022,901 describes 3-pyridyl-5-isothiocyanophenyl oxadiazoles. International Patent Publication WO 98/17652 describes oxadiazoles, WO 97/03967 describes various substituted aromatic compounds, JP 13233767A and WO 94/22846 describe various heterocyclic compounds.<br>
Compounds that include ringed systems are described by various investigators as effective for a variety of therapies and utilities. For example, International Patent Publication No. WO 98/25883 describes ketobenzamides as calpain inhibitors, European Patent Publication No. EP 811610 and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,679,712, 5,693,672 and 5,747,541describe substituted benzoylguanidine sodium channel blockers, and U.S. Patent No. 5,736,297 describes ring systems useful as a photosensitive composition.<br>
However, there remains a need for novel compounds and compositions that therapeutically inhibit mGluR5 with minimal side effects. <br>

As used herein, "alky!" as well as other groups ("groups" and substituents are used herein interchangeably) having the prefix "alk" such as, for example, alkoxy, alkanoyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and the like, means carbon chains which may be linear or branched or combinations thereof. Examples of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl,<br>
sec- and tort-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl and the like. "Alkenyl", "alkynyl" and other like terms include carbon chains containing at least one unsaturated C-C bond.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" means carbocycles containing no heteroatoms, and includes mono-, bi- and tricyclic saturated carbocycles, as well as fused ring systems. Such fused ring systems can include one ring that is partially or fully unsaturated such as a benzene ring to form fused ring systems such as benzofused carbocycles. Cycloalkyl includes such fused ring systems as spirofused ring systems. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, decahydronaphthalene, adamantane, indanyl, indenyl, fluorenyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphalene and the like. Similarly, "cycloalkenyl" means carbocycles containing no heteroatoms and at least one non-aromatic C-C double bond, and include mono-, bi- and tricyclic partially saturated carbocycles, as well as benzofused cycloalkenes. Examples of cycloalkenyl include cyclohexenyl, indenyl, and the like.<br>
The term "aryl" means an aromatic substituent which is a single ring or multiple rings fused together. When formed of multiple rings, at least one of the constituent rings is aromatic. The preferred aryl substituents are phenyl and naphthyl groups.<br>
The term "cycloalkyloxy" unless specifically stated otherwise includes a cycloalkyl group connected by a short Ci_2alkyl length to the oxy connecting atom.<br>
The term "Co-6alkyl" includes alkyls containing 6, 5, 4, 3,2,1, or no carbon atoms. An alkyl with no carbon atoms is a hydrogen atom substituent when the alkyl is a terminal group and is a direct bond when the alkyl is a bridging group.<br>
The term "hetero" unless specifically stated otherwise includes one or more O, S, or N atoms. For example, heterocycloalkyl and heteroaryl include ring systems that contain one or more O, S, or N atoms in the ring, including mixtures of such atoms. The hetero atoms replace ring carbon atoms. Thus, for example, a heterocycloCsalkyl is a five-member ring<br>
containing from 4 to no carbon atoms. Examples of heteroaryls include pyridinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, quinoxalinyl, furyl, benzofuryl, dibenzofuryl, thienyl, benzthienyl, pyrrolyl, indolyl, pyrazolyl, indazolyl, oxazolyl, benzoxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, isothiazolyl, imidazolyl, benzimidazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, triazolyl, and tetrazolyl. Examples of heterocycloalkyls include azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, imidazolinyl, pyrolidin-2-one, piperidin-2-one, and thiomorpholinyl.<br>
The term "heteroCo-4alkyl" means a heteroalkyl containing 3,2, 1, or no carbon atoms. However, at least one heteroatom must be present. Thus, as an example, a heteroCQ-4alkyl having no carbon atoms but one N atom would be a -NH- if a bridging group and a -NH2 if a terminal group. Analogous bridging or terminal groups are clear for an O or S heteroatom.<br>
The term "amine" unless specifically stated otherwise includes primary, secondary and tertiary amines substituted with C()-6alkyl.<br>
The term "carbonyl" unless specifically stated otherwise includes a CQ-6alkyl substituent group when the carbonyl is terminal.<br>
The term "halogen" includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine atoms.<br>
The term "optionally substituted" is intended to include both substituted and unsubstituted. Thus, for example, optionally substituted aryl could represent a pentafluorophenyl or a phenyl ring. Further, optionally substituted multiple moieties such as, for example, alkylaryl are intended to mean that the aryl and the aryl groups are optionally substituted. If only one of the multiple moieties is optionally substituted then it will be specifically recited such as "an alkylaryl, the aryl optionally substituted with halogen or hydroxyl."<br>

The pharmaceutical compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Creams, ointments, jellies, solutions, or suspensions containing the compound of Formula I can be employed for topical use. Mouth washes and gargles are included within the scope of topical use for the purposes of this invention.<br>
Dosage levels from about O.Olmg/kg to about 140mg/kg of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of psychiatric and mood disorders such as, for example, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, panic, bipolar disorders, and circadian disorders, as well as being useful in the treatment of pain which are responsive to mGluR5 inhibition, Or alternatively about 0.5mg to about 7g per patient per day. For example, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, and panic may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.0Img to 75mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day, or alternatively about 0.5mg to about 3.5g per patient per day. Pain may be effectively treated by the administration of from about O.Olmg to 125mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day, or alternatively about 0.5mg to about 5.5g per patient per day. Further, it is understood that the mGluR5 inhibiting compounds of this invention can be administered at prophylactically effective dosage levels to prevent the above-recited conditions.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration to humans may conveniently contain from about 0.5mg to about 5g of active agent, compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Unit dosage forms will generally contain between from about Img to about lOOOmg of the active ingredient, typically 25mg, 50mg, lOOmg, 200mg, 300mg, 400mg, SOOmg, 600mg, SOOmg or lOOOmg.<br>
It is understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.<br>
In practice, the compounds represented by Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, of this invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be presented as discrete units suitable for oral administration such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Further, the compositions can be presented as a powder, as granules, as a solution, as a suspension in an aqueous liquid, as a non-aqueous liquid, as an oil-in-water emulsion or as a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compound represented by Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
thereof, may also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices. The compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, such methods include a step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier that constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. The product can then be conveniently shaped into the desired presentation.<br>
Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Formula I. The compounds of Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can also be included in pharmaceutical compositions in combination with one or more other therapeutically active compounds.<br>
The pharmaceutical carrier employed can be, for example, a solid, liquid, or gas. Examples of solid carriers include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc7 gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, and stearic acid. Examples of liquid carriers are sugar syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, and water. Examples of gaseous carriers include carbon dioxide and nitrogen.<br>

pharmaceutical media may be employed. For example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like may be used to form oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions; while carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like may be used to form oral solid preparations such as powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules are the preferred oral dosage units whereby solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. Optionally, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques<br>
A tablet containing the composition of this invention may be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients or adjuvants. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Each tablet preferably contains from about O.lmg to about 500mg of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule preferably containing from about O.lmg to about 500mg of the active ingredient. Thus, a tablet, cachet, or capsule conveniently contains O.lmg, Img, 5mg, 25mg, 50mg, lOOmg, 200mg, SOOmg, 400mg, or 500mg of the active ingredient taken one or two tablets, cachets, or capsules, once, twice, or three times daily.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration may be prepared as solutions or suspensions of the active compounds in water. A suitable surfactant can be included such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof in oils. Further, a preservative can be included to prevent the detrimental growth of microorganisms.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions. Furthermore, the compositions can be in the form of sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of such sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the final injectable form must be sterile and must be effectively fluid for easy syringability. The pharmaceutical compositions must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage; thus, preferably should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), vegetable oils, and suitable mixtures thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be in a form suitable for topical use such as, for example, an aerosol, cream, ointment, lotion, dusting powder, or the like. Further, the compositions can be in a form suitable for use in transdermal devices. These formulations may be prepared, utilizing a compound represented by Formula I of this invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, via conventional processing methods. As an example, a cream or ointment is prepared by mixing hydrophilic material and water, together with about 5 wt% to about 10 wt% of the compound, to produce a cream or ointment having a desired consistency.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be in a form suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid. It is preferable that the mixture forms unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art. The suppositories may be conveniently formed by first admixing the composition with the softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in moulds.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients, the pharmaceutical formulations described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavoring agents, binders, surface-active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives (including anti-oxidants) and the like. Furthermore, other adjuvants can be included to render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Compositions containing a compound described by Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also be prepared in powder or liquid concentrate form.<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention have been found to exhibit biological activity as mGluR5 inhibitors. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention is the treatment in mammals of, for example, schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, panic, bipolar disorders, circadian rhythm and sleep disorders, pain, Parkinson's disease, cognitive dysfunction, epilepsy, obesity, drug addiction, drug abuse and drug withdrawal - maladies that are amenable to amelioration through inhibition of mGluRS - by the administration of an effective amount of the compounds of this invention. The term "mammals" includes humans, as well as other animals such as, for example, dogs, cats, horses, pigs, and cattle. Accordingly, it is understood that the treatment of mammals other than humans is the treatment of clinical correlating afflictions to those above recited examples that are human afflictions.<br>
Further, as described above, the compound of this invention can be utilized in combination with other therapeutic compounds. In particular, the combinations of the mGluR5 inhibiting compound of this invention can be advantageously used in combination with i) opiate agonists or antagonists, ii) calcium channel antagonists, iii) 5HT receptor agonists or antagonists iv) sodium channel antagonists, v) NMDA receptor agonists or antagonists, vi) COX-2 selective inhibitors, vii) NK1 antagonists, viii) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ("NSAID"), ix) GABA-A receptor modulators, x) dopamine agonists or antagonists, xi) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ("SSRF) and/or selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ("SSNRI"), xii) tricyclic antidepressant drugs, xiii) norepinephrine modulators, xiv) L-DOPA, xv) buspirone, xvi) lithium, xvii) valproate, xviii) neurontin (gabapentin), xix) olanzapine, xx) nicotinic agonists or antagonists including nicotine, xxi) muscarinic agonists or antagonists, xxii) heroin substituting drugs such as methadone, levo-alpha-acetylmethadol, buprenorphine and naltrexone, and xxiii) disulfiram and acamprosate.<br>

 ASSAYS DEMONSTRATING BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
The compounds of this invention were tested against the hmGluRSa receptor stably expressed in mouse fibroblast Ltk" cells (the hmGluR5a/L3S-20 cell line) and activity was detected by changes in [Ca++]j, measured using the fluorescent Ca++-sensitive dye, fura-2. InsP<br>
assays were performed in mouse fibroblast Ltk" cells (LM5a cell line) stably expressing hmGluRSa. The assays described in International Patent Publication WO 0116121 can be used.<br>
Calcium Flux Assay<br>
The activity of compounds was examined against the hmGluRSa receptor stably expressed in mouse fibroblast Ltk- cells (the hmGluR5a/L3S cell line). See generally Daggett et al., Neurophartnacology 34:871-886 (1995). Receptor activity was detected by changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]j) measured using the fluorescent calcium-sensitive dye, fura-2. The<br>
hmGluR5a/L38-20 cells were plated onto 96-well plates, and loaded with 3 uM fura-2 for Ih. Unincorporated dye was washed from the cells, and the cell plate was transferred to a 96-channel fluorimeter (SIBIA-SAIC, La Jolla, CA) which is integrated into a fully automated plate handling and liquid delivery system. Cells were excited at 350 and 385nm with a xenon source combined with optical filters. Emitted light was collected from the sample through a dichroic mirror and a 510nm interference filter and directed into a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments). Image pairs were captured approximately every Is, and ratio images were generated after background subtraction. After a basal reading of 20s, an ECgo concentration of glutamate (lO^M) was added to the well, and the response evaluated for another 60s. The glutamate-evoked increase in [Ca']j<br>
in the presence of the screening compound was compared to the response of glutamate alone (the positive control).<br>
Phosphatidylinositol Hydrolysis (PI) Assays<br>
Inositolphosphate assays were performed as described by Berridge et al. [Berridge et al, Biockem. J. 206: 587-5950 (1982); and Nakajima et al., J. Biol Chem. 267:2437-2442 (1992)] with slight modifications. Mouse fibroblast Ltk cells expressing hmGluRS (hmGluR5/L38- 20 cells) were seeded in 24-vvell plates at a density of 8xl05cells/well. One u,Ci of [3H]-inositol (Amersham PT6-271; Arlington Heights, 111.; specific activity = 17.7 Ci/mmol) was added to each well and incubated for 16h at 37°C. Cells were washed twice and incubated for 45min in 0.5mL of standard Hepes buffered saline buffer (HBS; 125mM NaCl, 5mM KCI, 0.62mM MgS04, 1.8mM CaCl2, 20mM HEPES, 6mM glucose, pH to 7.4). The cells were washed with HBS containing lOmM LiCl, and 400uL buffer added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 20min. For testing, 50uL of 10X compounds used in the practice of the invention (made in HBS/LiCl (lOOmM)) was added and incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were activated by the addition of 10f.iM glutamate, and the plates left for 1 hour at 37°C. The incubations were terminated by the addition of ImL ice-cold methanol to each well. In order to isolate inositol phosphates (IPs), the cells were scraped from wells, and placed in numbered glass<br>
test tubes. One mL of chloroform was added to each tube, the tubes were mixed, and the phases separated by centrifugation. IPs were separated on Dowex anion exchange columns (AG 1-X8 100-200 mesh formate form). The upper aqueous layer (750|oL) was added to the Dowex columns, and the columns eluted with 3mL of distilled water. The eluents were discarded, and the columns were washed with lOmLs of 60mM ammonium formate/5mM Borax, which was also discarded as waste. Finally, the columns were eluted with 4mL of SOOmM ammonium formate/0.1M formic acid, and the samples collected in scintillation vials. Scintillant was added to each vial, and the vials shaken, and counted in a scintillation counter after 2 hours. Phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in cells treated with certain exemplary compounds was compared to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in cells treated with the agonist alone in the absence of compound.<br>
The compounds of this application have mGluRS inhibitory activity as shown by ICso values of less than 10 |JM in the calcium flux assay or inhibition at a concentration of 100 uM in the PI assay. Preferably, the compounds should have ICso values of less than 1 \)M in the calcium flux assay and ICso values of less than 10 |JM in the PI assay. Even more preferably, the compounds should have ICso values of less than 500 nM in the calcium flux assay and ICso values of less than 1 uM in the PI assay<br>
Examples 1 to 8 have mGluRS inhibitory activity as shown by inhibition at 10 uM or less in the calcium flux assay or inhibition at 100 (.iM or less in the PI assay.<br>

Methods of Synthesis<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following methods. The substituents are the same as in Formula I except where defined otherwise.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods for the preparation of heteroaryl-substituted pyrrole compounds as described above. For example, many of the heterocyclic compounds described above can be prepared using synthetic chemistry techniques well known in the art (see Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, Katritzky, A. R. and Rees, C. W. eds., Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1984) from a heteroaryl-substituted pyrrole of Formula (I).<br>
In Schemes 1 to 6 below, W. X. Y. Z. A and B are as defined above for Formula (T).<br>
Other variables are understood by one in the art by the context in which they are used. Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Thus in Scheme 1, ring system X containing an aniline moiety (prepared using synthetic chemistry techniques well known in the art) is reacted with a 1,4-dicarbonyl or its equivalent in a suitable solvent (e.g. EtOH, THF, DME, DMF etc.) at a temperature between 30°C to 150°C for 1 to ISh to form a substituted pyrrole. In turn, the 3-position of the pyrrole is derivatized with a functional group A, such as a halogen or trifluoromethanesulfonate and the like, which is capable of undergoing a metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. For example, the group A may be a bromine atom which may be installed using bromotrimethylsilane (see for example Pagnoni, U.G.; Pinetti, A. J.Heterocycl.Chem. 1993, 30, 617-621).<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In turn, the derivatized pyrrole is reacted with a moiety Y under metal-catalyzed cross-coupling conditions (Scheme 2) where E is a metallic or metalloid species such as B(OR)2, Li, MgHal, SnR3, ZnHal, SiR3 and the like which is capable of undergoing a metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. The coupling may be promoted by a homogeneous catalyst such as Pd(PPh3)4, or by a heterogeneous catalyst such as Pd on carbon in a suitable solvent (e.g. THF, DME, toluene, MeCN, DMF, H2O etc.). Typically a base, such as K2CO3) NEt3, and the like, will also be present in the reaction mixture. Other promoters may also be used such as CsF. The coupling reaction is typically allowed to proceed by allowing the reaction temperature to warm slowly from about 0°C up to rt over a period of several hours. The reaction mixture is then maintained at rt, or heated to a temperature anywhere between 30°C to 150°C. The reaction mixture is then maintained at a suitable temperature for a time in the range of about 4 up to 48h, with about ISh typically being sufficient (see for example Miyaura, N.; Suzuki, A. Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2457-2483). The product from the reaction can be isolated and purified employing standard techniques, such as solvent extraction, chromatography, crystallization, distillation and the like.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Scheme 3. Scheme <br>

Thus, the free ring nitrogen in an optionally substituted pyrrole (prepared using synthetic chemistry techniques well known in the art) is protected with a group P, where P may be a trialkyl- or triaryl silane, arylsulfonyl or alkyl carbamate protecting group and the like. In turn, the 3-position of the pyrrole is derivatized with a functional group A, such as a halogen or trifluoromethanesulfonate and the like, which is capable of undergoing a metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. For example, the group A may be an iodine which maybe installed using molecular iodine and mercuric acetate (see for example Bray, B. L. et al. J. Org. Chem. 1990,55,<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In turn, the derivatized pyrrole is reacted with a moiety Y under metal-catalyzed cross-coupling conditions (Scheme 4) where E is a metallic or metalloid species such as B(OR)2, ZnHal, Li, MgHal, SnRs, SiRa and the like which is capable of undergoing a metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. The coupling may be promoted by a homogeneous catalyst such as Pd(PPhs)4, or by a heterogeneous catalyst such as Pd on carbon in a suitable solvent (e.g. THF, DME, toluene, MeCN, DMF, H2O etc.). If required a base, such as K2CO3, NEt3, and the like, will also be present in the reaction mixture. Other promoters may also be used such as CsF. The coupling reaction is typically allowed to proceed by allowing the reaction temperature to warm slowly from about 0°C up to it over a period of several hours. The reaction mixture is then maintained at it, or heated to a temperature anywhere between 30°C to 150°C. The reaction mixture is then maintained at a suitable temperature for a time in the range of about 4 up to 48h, with about ISh typically being sufficient (see for example: Miyaura, N.; Suzuki, A. Chem. Rev. . 1995,95, 2457-2483 or Negishi, E.; Liu, F. Palladium or Nickel catalyzed Cross-coupling with Organometals Containing Zinc, Magnesium, Aluminium and Zirconium. In Metal-catalyzed Cross-coupling Reactions Diederich, F.; Stang, PJ. Eds. Wiley, Weinheim, Germany, 1998; ppl-42). The product from the reaction can be isolated and purified employing standard techniques, such as solvent extraction, chromatography, crystallization, distillation and the like. Scheme 5<br>
 (Scheme Removed)<br>
As shown in Scheme 5, the pyrrole may then be coupled with a species X substituted with a group B. B may be a good aryl leaving group such as F, and X is electron deficient or has one or more electron withdrawing substituents (e.g. NQ2, CN etc.), the coupling reaction may be effected thermally in a temperature range of about 60°C up to about 250°C.<br>
Typically, this reaction is carried out in the presence of base (e.g. pyridine, NEt3, Cs2CO3, K2CO3 etc.) in a suitable solvent, such as DMSO, DMF, DMA H20 and the like, and takes from Ih up to about 72h with 18h typically being sufficient (see for example Russell, S. S.; Jahangir; Synth.Commun. 1994,24,123-130).<br>
Alternatively, B may be a good leaving group capable of undergoing a metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction such as a halogen or trifluoromethanesulfonate and the like. Typically, the reaction is carried out using catalytic amounts of a copper (I) salt together with a diamine ligand and in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. K3PC&gt;4, CS2CO3, K2CO3 etc.) in a suitable solvent, such as Dioxane, DMSO, DMA, DMF (see for example Klapers, A.; Antilla, J.C.; Huang, X.; Buchwald, S.L7. Am. Chem Soc. 2001, in press).<br>
In the schemes above, ring systems X and/or Y may already contain a pendant ring W and/or Z. However, if required, ring systems W and/or Z may be appended to X and/or Y respectively where G and/or J are functional groups capable of undergoing a metal catalyzed-cross coupling (such as halogen, trifluoromethane-sulfonate, B(OR)2, ZnX, SnRs, and the like -<br>
Scheme 6 below). Ring systems W and Z are substituted with groups P, Q, S and T which may be for example, halogen, trifluoromethanesulfonate, B(OR)2, ZnX, SnRs, and the like. Typically, a transition metal catalyst such as Pd(PPhs)4, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, Pd(OAc)2, NiCl2(dppe), Pd(OAc)2) Pd2(dba)s, Cu(OAc)2, Cul or the like may be employed, typically along with a suitable base such as K2CO3, K3PC&gt;4, Cs2CC&gt;3, Et3N, pyridine or the like. Additionally, ligands such as BINAP, di-terr-butyl phosphinobiphenyl, di-cyclohexylphosphino biphenyl, tri tert-butylphosphine, XANTPHOS, triphenylarsine and the like may be added. The reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent such as toluene, DME, dioxane, THF, water or a combination of the above and is typically heated at 50°C - 150°C for between 1 and 48 hrs. The reaction may be homogeneous or heterogeneous (see for example Miyaura, N.; Suzuki, A. Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2457-2483 and Dai, C.; Fu, G.C J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2001,123, 2719-2724 and Littke, A.F.; Fu, G.C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999, 38, 6, 2411-2413 and Dai, C; Fu, G.C. /. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001,723,2719-2724).<br>
Scheme 6<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Alternatively ring systems W or Z may be a nitrogen containing heterocycle wherein the nitrogen is directly attached to the ring system X or Y respectively. In this case G and/or J are groups capable of undergoing a metal catalyzed N-aryl cross-coupling (such as halogen, trifluoromethane-sulfonate, B(OR)2, ZnX, SnR3, and the like - Scheme 6). Typically a transition metal such as Cul, Cu(OAc)2) Cu(OTf)2, Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, NiCl2(dppe) is used along with a suitable base such as as K2CO3, K3PO4, Cs2CO3&gt; NaOfBu or the like. Additionally, phosphine containing ligands such as BINAP, di-terf-butyl phosphinobiphenyl, di-cyclohexylphosphino biphenyl, tri rert-butylphosphine, XANTPHOS and the like may be added. Further, additives such as 1,10-phenanthroline, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, dibenzylideneacetone may be used. The reaction is typically carried out in a solvent such as toluene, DME, dioxane, THF, water or a combination of the above and is typically heated at 50°C — 150°C for between 1 and 48 hrs. The reaction may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. The product from Scheme 4, can be isolated and purified employing standard techniques, such as solvent extraction, acid-base extraction, chromatography, crystallization, distillation and the like (see for example Lam, P. Y. S.; Clark, C. G.; Saubern, S.; Adams, J.; Winters, M. P.; Cham, D. M. T.; Combs, A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 2941-2944 and Kiyomori, A.; Marcoux, J. R; Buchwald, S. L.
