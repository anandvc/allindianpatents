HEAT STABLE MUTANTS OF STARCH BIOSYNTHESIS ENZYMES<br>
This invention was made with government support under National Science Foundation grant number 9316887. The government has certain rights in the invention.<br>
Cross-Reference to Related Application This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional application Serial No. 60/275,768, filed March 14,2001.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The sessile nature of plant life generates a constant exposure to environmental factors that exert positive and negative effects on its growth and development One of the major impediments facing modern agriculture is adverse environmental conditions. One important factor which causes significant crop loss is heat stress. Temperature stress greatly reduces grain yield in many cereal crops such as maize, wheat, and barley. Yield decreases due to heat stress range from 7 to 35% in the cereals of world-wide importance.<br>
A number of studies have identified likely physiological consequences of heat stress. Early work by Hunter et al. (Hunter, R- B., Tollenaar, M., and Breuer, C. M. [1977] Can. 1 Plant Set 57:1127-1133) using growth chamber conditions showed that temperature decreased the duration of grain filling in maize. Similar results in which the duration of grain filling was adversely altered by increased temperatures were identified by Tollenaar and Bruulsema (Tollenaar, M. and Bruulsema, T. W. [1988] Can. J. Plant Set 68:935-940). Badu-Apraku et aL (Badu-Apraku, B., Hunter, R. B., and Tollenaar, M. [1983] Can. J. Plant Sci. 63:357-363) measured a marked reduction in the yield of maize plants grown under the day/night temperature regime of 35/15°C compared to growth in a 25/15 °C temperature regime. Reduced yields due to increased temperatures is also supported by historical as well as climatological studies (Thompson, L. M. [1986] Agron. J. 78:649-653; Thompson, L. M. [1975] Science 188:535-541; Chang, J. [1981]<br><br>
Agricul Metero. 24:253-262; and Conroy, J. P., Seneweera, S., Basra, A. S., Rogers, G., and Nissen-Wooller, B. [1994] Aust. J, Plant Physiol 21:741-758).<br>
That the physiological processes of the developing seed are adversely affected by heat stress is evident from studies using an in vitro kernel culture system (Jones, R.I., Gengenbach, B.G., and Cardwell, V.B. [1981] Crop Science 21:761-766; Jones, RJM Ouattar, S., and Crookston, R.K. [1984] Crop Science 24:133-137; and Cheikh, N., and Jones, RJ. [995] Physiol Plant 95:59-66). Maize kernels cultured at the above-optimum temperature of 35°C exhibited a dramatic reduction in weight<br>
Work with wheat identified the loss of soluble starch synthase (SSS) activity as a hallmark of the wheat endosperm's response to heat stress (Hawker, J. S. and Jenner, C. F. [1993] Aust J. Plant Physiol 20:197-209; Denyer, K., Hylton, C. M., and Smith, A. M. [1994] Aust. J. Plant Physiol 21:783-789; Jenner, C. F. [1994] Aust. J. Plant Physiol 21:791-806). Additional studies with SSS of wheat endosperm show that it is heat labile (Rijven, A.H.G.C [1986] Plant Physiol &amp;l:44&amp;*453; Keeling, P.L., Bacon, P.J., Holt, D.C. [1993] Planta. 191:342-348; Jenner, C. F., Denyer, K., and Guerin, J. [1995] Aust J. Plant Physiol 22:703-709).<br>
The roles of SSS and ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) under heat stress conditions in maize is less clear. AGP catalyzes the conversion of ATP and a-glucose-1 -phosphate to ADP-glucose and pyrophosphate. ADP-glucose is used as a glycosyl donor in starch biosynthesis by plants and in glycogen biosynthesis by bacteria. The importance of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase as a key enzyme in the regulation of starch biosynthesis was noted in the study of starch deficient mutants of maize (Zea mays) endosperm (Tsai, C.Y., and Nelson, Jr., O.E. [1966] Science 151:341-343; Dickinson, D.B., J. Preiss [1969] Plant Physiol 44:1058-1062).<br>
Ou-Lee and Setter (Ou-Lee, T. and Setter, TX. [1985] Plant Physiol 79:852-855) examined the effects of temperature on the apical or tip regions of maize ears. With elevated temperatures, AGP activity was lower in apical kernels when compared to basal kernels during the time of intense starch deposition. In contrast, in kernels developed at normal temperatures, AGP activity was similar in apical and basal kernels during this period. However, starch synthase activity during this period was not diiferentially affected in apical and basal kernels. Further, heat-treated apical kernels exhibited an increase in starch synthase activity over control.   This was not observed with AGP activity.<br><br>
Singletary et al. (Singletary, G.W., Banisadr, R., and Keeling, P.L. [1993] Plant Physiol 102: 6 (suppl).; Singletary, G.W., Banisadra, R., Keeling, P.L. [1994] Aust. J. Plant Physiol 21:829-841) using an in vitro culture system quantified the effect of various temperatures during the grain fill period. Seed weight decreased steadily as temperature increased from 22-36°C. A role for AGP in yield loss is also supported by work from Duke and Doehlert (Duke, E.R. and Doehlert, D.C. [1996] Environ. Exp. Botany. 36:199-208).<br>
Work by Keeling et al (1994, supra) quantified SSS activity in maize and wheat using Q10 analysis, and showed that SSS is an important control point in the flux of carbon into starch.<br>
In vitro biochemical studies with AGP and SSS clearly show that both enzymes are heat labile. Maize endosperm AGP loses 96% of its activity when heated at 57 °C for five minutes (Hannah, L.C., Tuschall, DM., and Mans, RJ. [1980] Genetics 95:961 -970). This is in contrast to potato AGP which is fully stable at 70°C (Sowokinos, J.R. and Preiss, J. [1982] Plant Physiol 69:1459-1466; Okita, T.W., Nakata, P.A., Anderson, J.M., Sowokinos, J., Morell, J., and Preiss, J. [1990] Plant Physiol 93:785-90). Heat inactivation studies with SSS showed that it is also labile at higher temperatures, and kinetic studies determined that the KTW value for amylopectin rose exponentially when temperature increased from 25-45°C (Jenner et al.91995, supra).<br>
Biochemical and genetic evidence has identified AGP as a key enzyme in starch biosynthesis in higher plants and glycogen biosynthesis in E. coli (Preiss, J. and Romeo, T. [1994] Progress in Nuc. Acid Res. and Mol Biol 47:299-329; Preiss, L and Sivak, M. [1996] "Starch synthesis in sinks and sources," In Photoassimilate distribution in plants and crops: swrce-sink relationships. Zamski, E., ed., Marcil Dekker Inc. pp. 139-168). AGP catalyzes what is viewed as the initial step in the starch biosynthetic pathway with the product of the reaction being the activated glucosyl donor, ADPglucose. This is utilized by starch synthase for extension of the polysaccharide polymer (reviewed in Hannah, L. Curtis [1996] "Starch synthesis in the maize endosperm," In: Advances in Cellular and Molecular Biology of Plants, Vol. 4. B. A. Larkins and L K. Vasil (eds.). Cellular and Molecular Biology of Plant Seed Development. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands).<br><br>
Initial studies with potato AGP showed that expression in £ coli yielded an enzyme with allosteric and kinetic properties very similar to the native tuber enzyme (Iglesias, A., Barry, G.F., Meyer, C, Bloksberg, L., Nakata, P., Greene, T., Laughlin, M.J., Okita, T.W., Kishore, G.M., and Preiss, J. [1993] /. Biol Chem. 268:1081-86; Ballicora, M.A., Laughlin, M.J., Fu, Y., Okita, T.W., Barry, G.F., and Preiss, J. [1995] Plant Physiol 109:245-251). Greene et al (Greene, T.W., Chantler, S.E., Kahn, MX., Barry, G.F., Preiss, J., and Okita, T.W. [1996] Proa Natl Acad. Sci. 93:1509-1513; Greene, T.W., Woodbury, R.L., and Okita, T.W. [1996] Plant Physiol (112:1315-1320) showed the usefulness of the bacterial expression system in their structure-function studies with the potato AGP. Multiple mutations important in mapping allosteric and substrate binding sites were identified (Okita, T.W., Greene, T.W., Laughlin, M.J., Salamone, P., Woodbury, R., Choi, SM Ito, H., KavaklL H.? and Stephens, K. [1996] "Engineering Plant Starches by the Generation of Modified Plant Biosynthetic Enzymes," In Engim&amp;'ing Crops for Industrial End Uses, Shewry, PJR., Napier, J.A., and Davis, P,, eds., Portland, . . Press Ltd., London).<br>
AGP enzymes have been isolated from both bacteria and plants. Bacterial AGP consists of ahomotetramer, while plant AGP fromphotosynthetic andnon-photosynthetic tissues is a heterotetramer composed of two different subunits. The plant enzyme is encoded by two different genes, with one subunit being larger than the other. This feature has been noted in a number of plants. The AGP subunits in spinach leaf have molecular weights of 54 kDa and 51 kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. Both subunits are immunoreactive with antibody raised against purified AGP from spinach leaves (Copeiand, L., J. Preiss (1981) Plant Physiol 68:996-1001; Morell, M., M. Bloon, V. Knowles, J. Preiss [1988] J. Bio. Chem. 263:633). Immunological analysis using antiserum prepared against the small and large subunits of spinach leaf showed that potato tuber AGP is also encoded by two genes (Okita et ah, 1990, supra). The cDNA clones of the two subunits of potato tuber (50 and 51 kDa) have also been isolated and sequenced (Muller-Rober, B.T., J. Kossmann, L.C. Hannah, L. Willmitzer, U. Sounewald [1990] Mol Gen. Genet. 224:136-146; Nakata, P.A., T.W. Greene, J.M. Anderson, B J. Smith-White, T.W. Okita, J. Preiss [1991] Plant Mol Biol. 17:1089-1093). The large subunit of potato tuber AGP is heat stable (Nakata et al [1991], supra).<br><br>
As Hannah andNelson (Hannah, L.C., O.E. Nelson (1975) Plant Physiol 55:297-302.; Hannah, L.C., and Nelson, Jr., O.E. [1976] Biochem. Genet. 14:547-560) postulated, both Shrunken-2 (Sh2) (Bhave, M.R., S. Lawrence, C. Barton, L.C. Hannah [1990] Plant Cell 2:581-588) and Brittle-2 (Bt2) (Bae, J.M., M. Giroux, L.C. Hannah [1990] Maydica 35:317-322) are structural genes of maize endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Sh2 and Bt2 encode the large subunit and small subunit of the enzyme, respectively. From cDNA sequencing, Sh2 and Bi2 proteins have predicted molecular weight of 57,179 Da (Shaw, J.R., L.C. Hannah [1992] Plant Physiol 98:1214-1216) and 52,224 Da, respectively. The endosperm is the site of most starch deposition during kernel development in maize. Sli2 and bt2 maize endosperm mutants have greatly reduced starch levels corresponding to deficient levels of AGP activity. Mutations of either gene have been shown to reduce AGP activity by about 95% (Tsai and Nelson, 1966, supra; Dickinson and Preiss, 1969, supra). Furthermore, it has been observed that enzymatic activities increase with the dosage of fimctionaLwil&amp;type Sh2 and Bt2 alleles, whereas mutant enzymes have altered kinetic properties. AGP is the rate limiting step in starch biosynthesis in plants. Staik et al placed a mutant form of E. coli AGP in potato tuber and obtained a 35% increase in starch content (Stark et al. [1992] Science 258:287).<br>
The cloning and characterization of the genes encoding the AGP enzyme subunits have been reported for various plants. These include Sh2 cDNA (Bhave et al, 1990. supra), Sh2 genomic DNA (Shaw and Hannah, 1992, sttpra), and Bt2 cDNA (Bae et al, 1990, supra) from maize; small subunit cDNA (Anderson, J.M., J. Hnilo, R. Larson, T. W. Okita, M. Morell, J. Preiss [1989] J. Biol Chem. 264:12238-12242) and genomic DNA (Anderson, J.M., R. Larson, D, Landencia, W.T. Kim, D. Morrow, T.W. Okita, J. Preiss [1991] Gene 97:199-205) from rice; and small and large subunit cDNAs from spinach leaf (Morell et al, 1988, supra) and potato tuber (Muller-Rober et al, 1990, supra; Nakata, P.A., Greene, T.W., Anderson, J.W., Smith-White, B J., Okita, T.W., and Preiss, J. [1991] Plant Mol Biol 17:1089-1093). ha addition, cDNA clones have been isolated from wheat endosperm and leaf tissue (Olive, M.R., R. J. Ellis, W.W. Schuch [1989] Plant Physiol Mol. Biol 12:525-538) and Arabidopsis thaliana leaf (Lin, T., Caspar, T., Sommerville, C.R., and Preiss, J. [1988] Plant Physiol 88:1175-1181). AGP sequences from barley have also been described in Ainsworth et al (Ainsworth, C, Hosein, F., Tarvis, M., Weir, F., Buirell, M., Devos, K.M., Gale, M.D. [1995] Plavta 197:1-10).<br><br>
AGP functions as an allosteric enzyme in all tissues and organisms investigated to date. The allosteric properties of AGP were first shown to be important in E. coll A glycogen-overproducing E. coli mutant was isolated and the mutation mapped to the structural gene for AGP, designated as glyC. The mutant E. coli, known as gtyC-16, was shown to be more sensitive to the activator, fructose 1,6 bisphosphate, and less sensitive to the inhibitor, cAMP (Preiss, J. [1984] Ann. Rev. Microbiol 419-458). Although plant AGP's are also allosteric, they respond to different effector molecules than bacterial AGP's. In plants, 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA) functions as an activator while phosphate (P04) serves as an inhibitor (Dickinson and Preiss, 1969, supra).<br>
Using an in vivo mutagenesis system created by the Xc-mediated excision of a Ds transposable element fortuitously located close to a known activator binding site, Giroux et al (Giroux, M.J., Shaw, J., Barry, G., Cobb, G.B., Greene, T., Okita, T.W., and Hannah, L. C. [1996] Proc. Natl Acad. Set 93:5824-5829) were able to generate site-specific mutants in a functionally important region of maize endosperm AGP. One mutant, Rev6t contained a tyrosine-serine insert in the large subunit of AGP and conditioned a 11-18% increase in seed weight. In addition, published international application WO 01/64928 teaches that various characteristics, such as seed number, plant biomass, Harvest Index etc., can be increased in plants transformed with a polynucleotide encoding a large subunit of maize AGP containing the Rev6 mutation.<br>
Published international patent applications WO 99/58698 and WO 98/22601 and issued U.S. Patent No. 6,069,300 disclose mutations in the large subunit of maize AGP enzyme that, when expressed, confers increased heat stability in comparison to that observed for wild type AGP enzyme. Several heat stable mutants are disclosed in the '300 patent and WO publications, including mutants designated as HS 13 (having an Ala to Pro substitution at position 177); HS 14 (having an Asp to His substitution atposition 400 and a Val to De substitution at position 454; HS 16 (having an Arg to Thr substitution at position 104); HS 33 (having a His to Tyr substitution at position 333); HS 39 (having a His to Tyr substitution at position 333); HS 40 (having a His to Tyr substitution at position 333 and a Thr to lie substitution at position 460); HS 47 (having an Arg to Pro substitution at position 216 and a His to Tyr substitution at position 333); RTS 48-2 (having an Ala to Val substitution at position 177); and RTS 60-1 (having an Ala to Val substitution at position 396).<br><br>

Detailed Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The subject invention concerns novel mutant polynucleotide molecules, and the polypeptides encoded thereby, that confer increased heat resistance and yield in plants grown under conditions of heat stress relative to plants expressing wild type genotype. In specific embodiments, the polynucleotide molecules of the subject invention encode maize endosperm ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) and soluble starch synthase (SSS) enzyme activities. The mutant enzymes confer increased stability to heat stress conditions during seed and plant development in seeds and plant tissue expressing the enzymes as compared with wild type enzyme activities.<br>
One aspect of the subject invention concerns polynucleotides which encode two or more amino acid changes in an AGP large subunit as compared to the wild type sequence of the AGP large subunit polypeptide, wherein the expressed mutant protein exhibits increased stability. Preferably, the polypeptide encoded by the subject polynucleotides, when expressed with the small subunit, exhibit increased enzymatic activity as compared to wild type protein and, preferably, at a level about the same or greater than that exhibited by a single amino acid mutation that confers increased heat stability, such as HS 33. The polynucleotides of the invention may encode two, three, or more amino acid changes from the wild type sequence. Preferably, a polynucleotide of die invention encodes a polypeptide having an amino acid substitution at one or more of the following positions corresponding to the position in the large subunit of maize AGP: position 177, 333, and 396.<br>
In one embodiment, a polynucleotide of die present invention encodes a mutant large subunit of a plant AGP containing a double mutation: a histidine-to-tyrosine amino acid substitution and an alanine-to-valine amino acid substitution in the sequence of the polypeptide. In an exemplified embodiment, the histidine to tyrosine substitution occurs<br><br>
at the amino acid corresponding to residue number 333 in the sequence of the large subunit of maize AGP. In one embodiment, the alanine-to-valine substitution occurs at the amino acid corresponding to residue number 177 in the sequence of the large subunit of maize AGP. In another embodiment, the alanine-to-valine substitution occurs at the amino acid corresponding to residue 396 in the sequence of the large subunit of maize AGP.<br>
In a further embodiment, a polynucleotide of the present invention encodes a mutant large subunit of a plant AGP containing two alanine-to-valine amino acid substitutions within the sequence of the polypeptide. In an exemplified embodiment, the first alanine-to-valine substitution occurs at the amino acid corresponding to residue number 177 and the second alanine-to-valine substitution occurs at the amino acid corresponding to residue number 396 in the sequence of the large subunit of maize AGP. Enzyme activity associated with mutant proteins of the present invention having two mutations are shown in Figure 2.<br>
Another embodiment concerns a triple mutant comprising a histidine to tyrosine substitution at the amino acid corresponding to residue number 333, an alanine-to-valine substitution at the amino acid corresponding to residue number 177, and an alanine-to-valine substitution at the amino acid corresponding to residue 396 in the sequence of the large subunit of maize AGP.<br>
The amino acid residue numbers referred to above are based on the accepted number of the amino acids in this protein (Shaw and Hannah, 1992, supra). The position of these substitutions can be readily identified by a person skilled in the art Table 1 below shows the double and triple amino acid substitution mutants exemplified herein.<br><br><br>
Because of the homology of AGP polypeptides between various species of plants (Smith-White and Preiss [1992] J. Mol Evol 34:449-464), tlie ordinarily skilled artisan can readily determine the position of the mutations in AGP from plants other than maize that correspond to the position of mutations in maize AGP as disclosed herein. Thus, the present invention encompasses polynucleotides that encode mutant AGP of plants other than maize, including, but not limited to, wheat, barley, oats, and rice, that confers increased heat stability when expressed in the plant<br>
Single amino acid mutations in AGP that confer heat stability, and methods for producing and selecting for such mutations, are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,069300 and published international applications WO 99/58698 and WO 98/22601. Typically, a plasmid comprising a polynucleotide coding for the SH2 subunit of maize AGP was mutagenized, placed into mutant E. coli gig C cells expressing the BT2 subunit, and the cells grown at 42°C to select for mutants that could produce glycogen at that temperature. Several mutants, termed heat stable (HS) mutants, were isolated. Crude extracts of these mutants were prepared and the heat stability of the resulting AGP was monitored. The single amino acid substitution mutants retained between 8-59% of their activity after incubation at 60°C for five minutes. In addition, total enzymatic activity of the mutant maize endosperm AGP before heat treatment was elevated about two- to three-fold in several of the mutants.<br><br>
Multiple heat stability conferring mutations can easily be combined within one subunit. For example, different unique restriction sites that divide the coding regions of Sh2 into three distinct fragments can be used. Where appropriate, mutation combinations can be generated by subcloning the corresponding fragment containing the added mutation. If two mutations are in close proximity, then site-directed mutagenesis can be used to engineer such combinations. One method for site specific mutations involves PCR, mutagenic primer, and the use ofJDpnl restriction endonuclease. Primers can be constructed to contain the mutation in the 5' end, and used to PCR amplify using the proofreading polymerase Vent. Amplified DNA can then be digested with DpriL Parental DNA isolated from £. coli is methylated and hence susceptible to DpriL Digested DNA is size fractionated by gel electrophoresis, ligated, and cloned into the expression vectors. Mutations are confirmed by sequence analysis and transformed into the AC70R1-504 strain carrying the wild type small subunit Combinatorial mutants can then be analyzed.<br>
The subject invention also cdncettis the mutant polypeptides, encoded by the subject polynucleotides, having the amino acid substitutions described herein. In a preferred embodiment, the mutant polypeptides are from maize.<br>
The subject invention also concerns heat stable mutants of AGP of the present invention combined with heat stable mutations in the small subunit of the enzyme. Mutations in the small subunit of AGP that confer heat stability to the enzyme can also be readily prepared and identified using the methods described in U.S. Patent No. 6,069,300 and published international applications WO 99/58698 and WO 98/22601. Heat stable mutants of the small subunit can be co-expressed with the mutants of the present invention to further enhance the stability of an AGP enzyme.<br>
Plants and plant tissue bred to contain or transformed with die mutant polynucleotides of the invention, and expressing the polypeptides encoded by the polynucleotides, are also contemplated by the present invention. Plants and plant tissue expressing the mutant polynucleotides produce tissues that have, for example, lower heat-induced loss in weight or yield when subjected to heat stress during development. Plants within the scope of the present invention include monocotyledonous plants, such as rice, wheat, barley, oats, sorghum, maize, lilies, and millet, and dicotyledonous plants, such as peas, alfalfa, chickpea, chicory, clover, kale, lentil, prairie grass, soybean, tobacco, potato, sweet potato, radish, cabbage, rape, apple trees, and lettuce. In a particularly preferred<br><br>
embodiment, the plant is a cereal Cereals to which this invention applies include, for example, maize, wheat, rice, barley, oats, rye, and millet.<br>
The subject invention also concerns methods for producing and identifying polynucleotides and polypeptides contemplated within the scope of the invention. In one embodiment, gene mutation, followed by selection using abacterial expression system, can be used to isolate polynucleotide molecules that encode plant AGP subunits that possess mutations that can alleviate heat-induced loss in starch synthesis in plants. Individual amino acid substitutions can be combined into one subunit as described herein.<br>
The subject invention further concerns plants and plant tissue that comprise a polynucleotide of the present invention that encodes a mutant polypeptide of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the plant or plant tissue has an AGP mutant gene of the invention incorporated into its genome. Other alleles that confer advantageous phenotypes can also be incorporated into a plant genome, hi a preferred embodiment, the plant is a cereal plant More preferably, the plant is Zea mays. Plants having an AGP mutant gene can be grown from seeds that comprise a mutant gene in their genome. In addition, techniques for transforming plants with a gene, such as Agrobacierhim infection, biolistic methods, etc., are known in the art<br>
Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a variety of different polynucleotide sequences can encode each of the variant AGP polypeptides disclosed herein. In addition, it is well within the skill of a person trained in the art to create alternative polynucleotide sequences encoding the same, or essentially the same, polypeptides of the subject invention. These variant or alternative polynucleotide sequences are within the scope of the subject invention. As used herein, references to "essentially the same" sequence refers to sequences which encode amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or insertions which do not materially alter the functional activity of the polypeptide encoded by the AGP mutant polynucleotide described herein.<br>
As used herein, the terms "nucleic acid" and "polynucleotide sequence" refer to adeoxyribonucleotide orribonucleotide polymer in either single- or double-stranded form, and unless otherwise limited, would encompass known analogs of natural nucleotides that can function in a similar manner as naturally-occurring nucleotides. The polynucleotide sequences include both the DNA strand sequence that is transcribed into RNA and the RNA sequence that is translated into protein. The polynucleotide sequences include both<br><br>
full-length sequences as well as shorter sequences derived from the full-length sequences. It is understood that a particular polynucleotide sequence includes the degenerate codons of the native sequence or sequences which may be introduced to provide codon preference in a specific host cell. Allelic variations of the exemplified sequences also come within the scope of the subject invention. The polynucleotide sequences falling within the scope of the subject invention further include sequences which specifically hybridize with the exemplified sequences. The polynucleotide includes both the sense and antisense strands as either individual strands or in the duplex.<br>
Substitution of amino acids other than those specifically exemplified in the mutants disclosed herein are also contemplated within the scope of the present invention. Amino acids can be placed in the following classes: non-polar, uncharged polar, basic, and acidic. Conservative substitutions whereby a mutant AGP polypeptide having an amino acid of one class is replaced with another amino acid of the same class fall within the scope of the subject invention so long as the mutant AGP polypeptide having the substitution still retains increased heat stability relative to a wild type polypeptide. Table 2 below provides a fisting of examples of amino acids belonging to each class.<br><br>
For example, substitution of the tyrosine at position 333 in the HS 33, HS 7+3, HS 6+3, and HS 7+6+3 mutants with other amino acids, such as glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, asparagine, and glutamine, are encompassed within the scope of the invention. Also specifically contemplated within the scope of the invention is substitution of either a phenylalanine or a methionine at position 333 in the AGP large subunit. Thus, a combination of phenylalanine ormethionine at position 333 with either a valine at position 177 or a valine at position 396, or both, is specifically contemplated by the present<br><br>
invention. Similarly, substitution of the valine at positions 177 and 396 in the RTS 48-2, RTS 60-1, HS 7+3, HS 6+3, HS 7+6, and HS 7+6+3 mutants with other amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, proline, methionine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, is within the scope of the invention. Amino acid substitutions at positions other than the site of the heat stable mutation are also contemplated within the scope of the invention so long as the polypeptide retains or confers increased heat stability relative to wild type polypeptides.<br>
Polynucleotides and proteins of the subject invention can also be defined in terms of more particular identity anchor similarity ranges with those exemplified herein. The sequence identity will typically be greater than 60%, preferably greater than 75%, more preferably greater than 80%, even more preferably greater than 90%, and can be greater than 95%. The identity and/or similarity of a sequence can be 49, 50,51,52,53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83,84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96,97, 98, or 99% as compared to a sequence exemplified herein. Unless otherwise specified, as used herein percent sequence identity and/or similarity of two sequences can be determined using the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (Karlin and Altschul [1990] Proc. Natl Acad. Set USA 87:2264-2268), modified as in Karlin and Altschul (Karlin and Altschul [1993] Proc. Natl AcadSci. USA 90:5873-5877). Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul etal (Altschul et al. [1990] J. Mol Biol 215:402-410). BLAST searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score = 100, wordlength = 12, to obtain sequences with the desired percent sequence identity. To obtain gapped alignments for comparisonpurposes, Gapped BLAST can be used as described in Altschul etal (Altschvletal [1997] Nucl Acids Res. 25:3389-3402). When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (NBLAST and XBLAST) can be used. See NCBI/NIH website.<br>
The subject invention also concerns polynucleotides which encode fragments of the full length mutant polypeptide, so long as those fragments retain substantially the same functional activity as full length polypeptide. The fragments of mutant AGP polypeptide encoded by these polynucleotides are also within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
Fragments of the fall length sequence can be prepared using standard techniques known in the art.<br>
The subject invention also contemplates those polynucleotide molecules encoding starch biosynthesis enzymes having sequences which are sufficiently homologous with the wild type sequence so as to permit hybridization with that sequence under standard stringent conditions and standard methods (Maniatis, T., E.F. Fritsch, J. Sambrook [1982] Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). As used herein, "stringent" conditions for hybridization refers to conditions wherein hybridization is typically carried out overnight at 20-25 °C below the melting temperature (Tm) of the DNA hybrid in 6x SSPE, 5x Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml denatured DNA. The melting temperature is described by the following formula (Beltz, G.A., K.A. Jacobs, T.H. Eickbush, P.T. Cheibas, and F.C. Kafatos [1983] Methods ofEnzymology, R. Wu, L. Grossman and K. Moldave [eds.] Academic Press, New York 100:266-285):<br>
Tm=81.5°C+16.6 Log[Na+]+0.41(%G+C)-0.61(% fonnamide)-600/length of duplex in base pairs.<br>
Washes are typically carried out as follows:<br>
(1)	Twice at room temperature for 15 minutes in lx SSPE, 0.1% SDS (low stringency wash).<br>
(2)	Once at Tm-20°C for 15 minutes in 0.2x SSPE, 0.1% SDS (moderate stringency wash).<br>
The polynucleotide molecules of the subject invention can be used to transform plants to express the mutant heat stable enzyme in those plants. In addition, the polynucleotides of the subject invention can be used to express the recombinant variant enzyme. They can also be used as a probe to detect related enzymes. The polynucleotides can also be used as DNA sizing standards.<br>
The polynucleotide molecules of the subject invention also include those polynucleotides that encode starch biosynthesis enzymes, such as AGP enzymes, that contain mutations that can confer increased seed weight, in addition to enhanced heat stability, to a plant expressing these mutants. The combination of a heat stabilizing mutation, such as, for example, Sh2-HS 7+6 or Sh2-HS 7+5, with a mutation conferring<br><br>
increased seed weight, e.g., Rev69 in a polynucleotide that encodes the large subunit of maize AGP is specifically contemplated in the present invention. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,589,618 and 5,650,557 disclose polynucleotides (e.g., Rev6) that encode mutations in the large subunit of AGP that confer increased seed weight in plants that express the mutant polypeptide.<br>
Mutations in the AGP subunits that confer heat stability can be combined according to the subject invention with phosphate insensitive mutants of maize, such as the Rev6 mutation, to enhance the stability of the Rev6 encoded large subunit.<br>
It is expected that enzymic activity of SSS will be impaired at higher temperatures as observed with AGP. Thus, mutagenized forms of SSS can be expressed under increased thermal conditions (42 °C), to isolate heat stable variants in accordance with the methods described herein. These heat stable mutagenized forms of SSS are further aspects of the subject invention.<br>
The subject invention also concerns methods for increasing yield characteristics of plants under conditions of heat stress by incorporating a polynucleotide of the present invention that comprises a mutation in a starch biosynthesis enzyme that confers increased stability or resistance to heat stress conditions and a mutation that confers increased yield characteristics on the plant. Increased yield characteristics include, for example, increased seed number, increased seed weight, increased plant biomass, and increased Harvest Index.<br>

Following are examples which illustrate procedures for practicing the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted.<br><br>
Example 1 - Testing of Maize Endosperm ADP-glucose Pvrophosphorvlases having Multiple Amino Acid Mutations<br>
Expression of Maize Endosperm ADP-glucose Pyrophosphorvlases. 10-mlaliquotsof Luria broth (75 g/mL of spectinomycin and 50 g/mL of kanamycin) were inoculated from glycerol stocks of AC70R1-504£. coli cells expressing either maize endosperm or potato tuber ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and grown overnight at 37C with shaking at 220 rpm. These cultures were used to inoculate 250 mL of Luria broth (75 g/mL of spectinomycin and 50 g/mL of kanamycin). Cultures were grown to an ODm = 0.55 at 37C with shaking at 220 rpm. Cultures were induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside and .02 mg/mL nalidixic acid for 7 hrs at room temperature with shaking at 220 rpm. Cells were harvested at 3500 rpm for 10 min at 4C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 800L of extraction buffer: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCi2, 5 mM EDTA, 20% sucrose, and 30% ammonium sulfate. DTT (1 mM), 50 g/ml lysozyme, 1 g/mL pepstatin, 1 g/mL leupeptin, 1 g/mL antipain, 10 g/mL cbymostatin, 1 mM phenylmethyisulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM benzamidine were added to extraction buffer just before use. Lysates were sonicated three times for three seconds with incubation on ice between sonications. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 ipm at 4C. Supematants were removed and aliquoted for assays.<br>
Combination of Individual Mutations. A subcloning strategy was designed to study the effects of the mutations in combination with HS 33, and with each other. To combine the reversion mutations of RTS 48-2 and RTS 60-1, the plasmids containing each reversion mutation (the temperature sensitive parental mutations were removed prior to combining mutations) were digested with Eco RV and a 339 bp fragment of RTS 48-2 was exchanged for the corresponding fragment of RTS 60-1 (Figure 3). The resulting plasmid was designated Sh2-HS 7+6. A similar strategy was used to combine the reversion mutation of RTS 48-2 with the mutation identified in HS 33. Plasmids containing the mutations were digested with Eco RV and a 339 bp fragment of RTS 48-2 was exchanged for the corresponding fragment of HS 33. The resulting plasmid was designated Sh2-HS 7+3. To combine the reversion mutation of RTS 60-1 with the mutation identified in HS 33, plasmids containing the mutations were digested with Mun UKpn I and a 390 bp fragment of RTS 60-1 was exchanged for the corresponding fragment ofHS 33 (Figure<br><br>
3). The resulting plasmid was designated Sh2~HS 6+3. In order to combine the reversion mutations of RTS 60-1 and RTS 48-2 with the mutation identified in HS 33, plasmid Sh2-HS 6+3 and a plasmid containing the reversion mutation RTS 48-2 were digested with Eco RV and a 339 bp fragment of RTS 48-2 was exchanged for the corresponding fragment of Sh2-HS 6+3. The resulting plasmid was designated Sh2-HS 7+6+3.<br>
Final sequencing of all plasmids was performed using six primers to cover the entire Sh2 coding region in both directions. Primers used are as follows:<br>
LHBB1 (5^3'): 5'-CGACTCACTATAGGGAGACC-3* (SEQID NO. 5);<br>
LH27 (5}-+3y. S'-CCCTATGAGTAACTG-T (SEQ ID NO. 6);<br>
LH9 (S^3y. 5'-TATACTCAATTACAT-3' (SEQ ID NO. 7);<br>
LHBB2 (3&gt;-&gt;5%): 5'-GTGCCACCTGACGTCTAAG-3' (SEQ ID NO. 8);<br>
LH2135 (3*^5*): 5'-CAGAGCTGACACGTG-3' (SEQIDNO. 9);<br>
LH32 (y-tsy. S'-AAGCTGATCGCCACTC-S* (SEQ ID NO. 10). Heat Treatment of ADP-glucose Pvrophosphorylase. Wild type (sh2) and mutant ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase containing a single amino acid mutation (HS 33, RTS 48-2, RTS 60-1) and multiple mutation (HS 7+3, x.e, RTS 48-2 plus HS 33; HS 6+3, i.c, RTS 60-1 plus HS 33; and HS 7+6, i.e., RTS 48-2 plus RTS 60-1) amino acid changes were tested for enzyme activity before and after heat treatment. Heat treatment consisted of incubation of the test protein at 60°C for 5 minutes.<br>
The percentage of activity remaining after heat treatment at 60°C for 5 min is presented in Table 3. Genotypes in the data set are Sh2 wild type, HS 33y RTS 60-1 (reversion mutation only), RTS 48-2 (reversion mutation only), Sh2-HS 7+6, Sh2~HS 6+3, Sh2-HS 7+3, and Sh2-HS 7+6+3.<br><br><br>
Activity before heat treatment for Sh2 wild type, HS 33, RTS 60-1, RTS 48-2, Sh2-HS 7+6, Sh2-HS 6+3, SH2-HS 7+3, and Sh2-HS 7+6+3 is shown in Table 4. HS 33 has 2.1 fold more activity than does Sh2 wild type. Both RTS 48-2 and RTS 60-1 show a 1.4 fold increase in activity. Their double mutant contains a 1.9 fold increase in activity. While the combination of the two mutants increases activity, the double mutant does not experience synergistic effects. The mutation of RTS 60-1 when combined with that of HS 33 experiences an additive effect, raising activity 3.4 fold compared to Sh2 wild type. The mutation of RTS 48-2 in combination with that of HS 33 exhibits a slightly smaller increase to 2.9 fold. Interestingly, the triple mutant shows a slightly greater increase than either second-site reversion mutation alone, but less than the double mutant between second-site revertants.<br><br><br>
ADP-glucose Pvrophosphorvlase Assavs. To obtain quantitative data for the mutants described above, activity was measured with the synthesis (forward) assay that measures incorporation of [14C]glucose-l-P into the sugar nucleotide ADP-glucose. Assays were performed on crude enzyme extracts prepared as described below.<br>
The ADP-glucose synthesis reaction measures incorporation of [l4C]glucose-l-P into ADP-glucose. The reaction mixture contained 80 mM HEPES, pH 7.5m, 1 mM glucose-l-P5 4 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg ml/1 bovine serum albumin, 10 mM 3-PGA, and 15,000 cpm of [wC]glucose-l -P. Reaction volume was 50 mL. Assays were initiated by addition of 1.5 mM ATP. Reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37°C and terminated by boiling for 2 min. Unincorporated glucose-1-P was cleaved by addition of 0.3 U of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ) and incubation for 2.5 h at 37°C. A 20 mL aliquot of the reaction mixture was spotted on DEAE paper, washed with distilled water three times, dried, and quantified in a liquid scintillation counter.<br>
Additional results for single and double mutants are shown in Figure 2. For the combination mutant Sh2-HS 7+6 (RTS 48-2 plus RTS 60-1) and the combination mutant<br><br>
Sh2-HS 6+3 (RTS 60-1 plus HS 33), the numbers given are the average of data from 3 dilutions of the enzyme (in duplicate), multiplied by their dilution factor, minus background. For the combination Sh2-HS 7+3 (RTS 48-2 plus HS 33) mutant, the numbers given are the average of 2 dilutions of the enzyme (in duplicate), multiplied by their dilution factor, minus background. Graphic representation of the numbers was performed using Microsoft Excel.<br>
Example 2 — Combination of Heat Stability Mutations with Rev6<br>
According to the subject invention, the heat stable mutations can be combined with a mutation associated with increased seed weight, such as, for example, the Rev6 mutation. The goal is to maintain the desired phosphate insensitivity characteristic of Rev6 while enhancing its stability. Mutants comprising heat stable mutations combined with Rev6 mutation can be constructed and confirmed as described herein. These "combination" mutants can be transformed into AC70RT-504 carrying the wild type small subunit. Increased heat stability can be easily identified by a positive glycogen staining on a low glucose media. Rev6 does not stain when grown on this media. Initially all mutant combinations can be screened enzymatically for maintenance of phosphate insensitivity, and only combinations that maintain phosphate insensitivity are further analyzed.<br>
