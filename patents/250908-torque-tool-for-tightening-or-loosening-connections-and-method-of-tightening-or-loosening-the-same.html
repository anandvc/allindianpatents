				<td>TORQUE TOOL FOR TIGHTENING OR LOOSENING CONNECTIONS, AND<br>
METHOD OF TIGHTENING OR LOOSENING THE SAME<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No.: 60/844,060 filed September 12, 2006, under 35<br>
U.S.C. 119(e). The subject matter of the aforesaid U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application is further explicitly incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a torque tool for tightening<br>
or loosening a connection, as well as a method for tightening or loosening<br>
the same.<br>
In the known prior art, the tightening and loosening of<br>
connections such as on gas turbines or gas pipelines is typically<br>
accomplished with the use of hand wrenches. Two wrenches are typically<br>
used, one to hold the fitting area in place, and the second wrench is used<br>
to tighten or loosen the bolt.<br>
In normal applications, the force to be applied by a typical<br>
hand operated wrench is insufficient to either tighten or loosen an<br>
industrial bolt. Additionally, such bolt connections are often inaccessible<br>
2<br><br>
or surrounded by other industrial equipment such as pipes and gauges<br>
and electrical fittings and the like. Such environmental fittings and pipes<br>
render it difficult to safely manipulate hand wrenches in the immediate<br>
area.<br>
Additionally, it is often the case that in view of surrounding<br>
equipment and the like, it is not possible to manipulate a hand wrench in<br>
the proximity of the bolt to be turned. Under such situations it is<br>
necessary to extend the length of the hand wrench by inserting thereon a<br>
length of a pipe which surrounds the handle of the wrench and effectively<br>
extends it therefrom.<br>
Thus, in a typical prior art application it is sometimes<br>
necessary to manipulate two hand wrenches each extended through the<br>
use of a length of pipe, so that the wrenches will be extended through the<br>
surrounding area to tighten or loosen a bolt.<br>
Such a procedure is both difficult and tedious, as well as<br>
potentially dangerous in view of possible damage to surrounding<br>
equipment such as pipelines or electrical fittings or the like.<br>
3<br><br>
It is therefore believed to be clear that it is advisable to<br>
provide an approved tool and method for tightening and loosening of such<br>
connections.<br>
4<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a torque tool for tightening or loosening a connection as well as to a<br>
method for tightening or loosening the same, which avoid the<br>
disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
In keeping with these objects and with others which will<br>
become apparent hereinafter, one feature of the present invention resides,<br>
briefly stated, in a torque tool for tightening or loosening connections,<br>
comprising a driving element engageable with a turnable part of the<br>
connection for turning the turnable part of the connection for tightening or<br>
loosening the connection and turnable around an axis; and a power drive<br>
configured for acting on said driving element such that said drive acts on<br>
said driving element to turn said driving element and thereby to turn the<br>
turnable part of the connection over a partial stroke and a space is formed<br>
between said drive and said driving element, and said drive is then<br>
displaced over said space toward said driving element to act again on said<br>
driving element to turn said driving element and thereby to further turn the<br>
turnable part of the connection over a further partial stroke.<br>
5<br><br>
Another feature of the present invention resides, briefly<br>
stated, in a method of tightening or loosening connections, comprising<br>
engaging a driving element with a turnable part of the connection for<br>
turning the turnable part of the connection for tightening or loosening the<br>
connection and turnable around an axis; acting by a power drive on said<br>
driving element such that said drive acts on said driving element to turn<br>
said driving element and thereby to turn the turnable part of the<br>
connection over a partial stroke and a space is formed between said drive<br>
and said driving element; displacing said drive over said space toward<br>
said driving element; and acting again by said drive on said driving<br>
element to turn said driving element and thereby to further turn the<br>
turnable part of the connection over a further partial stroke.<br>
When the torque tool is designed and the method is<br>
performed in accordance with the present invention, it allows reliable,<br>
safe, and efficient tightening or loosening of corresponding connections,<br>
such as for example gas line connections on gas turbines, and the like.<br>
The novel features which are considered as characteristic for<br>
the present invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims.<br>
The invention itself, however, both as to its construction and its method of<br>
operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will be<br>
6<br><br>
best understood from the following description of specific embodiments<br>
when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A torque tool for tightening or loosening connections and a<br>
method for tightening or loosening of the same in accordance with the<br>
present invention can be used, for example, for tightening or loosening a<br>
pipe fitting shown in Figure 1 and identified with reference numeral 1. The<br>
pipe fitting has a pipe element 2 provided with a non-turnable, shaped part<br>
formed for example as a hexagonal part 3, and a head 4 provided with an<br>
outer thread 5. A nut 6 having an inner thread 7 has to be tightened on<br>
the head 4 by turning on the latter.<br>
The torque tool in accordance with the present invention has<br>
a drive which is identified as a whole with reference numeral 11 and can<br>
be formed as a fluid-operated drive including a cylinder 12 and a piston 13<br>
with a piston rod 14 movable in the cylinder. The drive 11 is immovably<br>
connected with two side plates 15. The cylinder 12 of the drive 11 and the<br>
side plates 15 together form a stationary part of the torque tool, which<br>
does not turn during turning of the nut 6 of the pipe fitting 1.<br>
A driving element of the torque tool is formed, for example,<br>
by a drive plate 16 which is located between the side plates 15 and is<br>
turnable around an axis A under the action of the piston rod 14 of the drive<br>
10<br><br>
11, which applies an action force to the drive plate 16 when the piston rod<br>
14 is extended from the cylinder 12 of the drive 11.<br>
The torque tool further has a reaction element which is<br>
engageable with a non-turnable part of the connection, in particular with<br>
the part 3 to counteract a reaction force which is generated during turning<br>
of the turnable part 6 of the connection by the driving plate 16 and thereby<br>
to prevent turning of the tool backward while the nut 6 is turned forward.<br>
The reaction element is formed, for example, as a reaction plate 17 which<br>
cooperates with a holding pawl 18. The holding pawl 18 is turnably<br>
mounted on the immovable part of the torque tool. For example one such<br>
holding pawl 18 is mounted on each side plate 15. Each holding pawl 18<br>
is spring-biased by a spring 19 toward the reaction plate 17.<br>
As shown in Figures 5a and 5b, each side plate 15 has a<br>
groove 21 which is provided on one side of the side plate and extends<br>
circumferentially around the axis A over a certain angle. A<br>
correspondingly shaped projection 22 of the drive plate 16 slidingly<br>
engages in the groove 21 of the side plate 15.<br>
The side plate 15 further has a projection 23 provided on the<br>
opposite side and extending in a circumferential direction around the axis<br>
11<br><br>
A. The projection 23 of the side plate 15 slidingly engages in a<br>
corresponding groove 24 provided in the reaction plate 17. The side<br>
plates 15 are immovably connected with the drive 11, for example, by a<br>
groove 25 provided in each side plate 15 and a projection 26 provided on<br>
the drive 11.<br>
The drive plate 16 has a portion 27 cooperating with the<br>
piston rod 14 of the drive 11 for turning the drive plate 16 during a working<br>
stroke of the tool. It also has an oppositely located engaging portion 28<br>
which is provided with a polygonal receptacle, formed, for example, as a<br>
12-points receptacle. The engaging portion 28 with its polygonal<br>
receptacle engages over the nut 6 of the connection to be tightened or<br>
loosened.<br>
The reaction plate 17 has a portion 29 provided with an inner<br>
polygonal receptacle, formed, for example, as a substantially hexagonal<br>
receptacle with lips. During the operation the portion 29 is placed with its<br>
polygonal receptacle on the non-turnable part 3 of the connection for<br>
reaction purposes, as will be explained herein above.<br>
On an outer periphery the reaction plate 17 has two sets of<br>
formations, formed, for example, as inclined teeth 30' and 30". The<br>
12<br><br>
holding pawl 18 has an engaging portion 31 which is engagable with the<br>
teeth 30' or 30" to hold the reaction plate 17 from turning during the<br>
working stroke of the torque tool, and for ratcheting over the teeth of the<br>
reaction plate 17 during a non-working stroke of the torque tool.<br>
The two pawls 18 located on opposite axial sides can be<br>
turnably connected with the side plates 15, for example, by a pin<br>
extending through aligned openings provided in the holding pawls 18 and<br>
in the side plates 15.<br>
The torque tool further has a fluid supply system provided for<br>
the fluid-operated drive 11 and identified as a whole with reference<br>
numeral 32.<br>
The torque tool for tightening or loosening connections in<br>
accordance with the present invention operates in accordance with the<br>
inventive method of tightening or loosening connections in the following<br>
manner.<br>
When it is necessary to turn the nut 6, for example, for<br>
tightening the nut 6 on the part 4 of the connection 1, a fluid is supplied<br>
into the fluid-operated drive 11, the piston 13 is displaced so that the<br>
13<br><br>
piston rod 14 is extended, the piston rod 14 acts on the drive plate 16 by<br>
an action force for example to push the drive plate 16, and turns the drive<br>
plate 16, which with its part 26 turns the nut 6.<br>
During turning of the drive plate 16 the holding pawl 18<br>
mounted on the immovable part on the tool, for example on the side plate<br>
15, engages the corresponding teeth of the reaction plate 17, so that while<br>
an action force is transmitted by the drive plate16 to the nut 6, a reaction<br>
force generated during turning is transmitted through the side plate 15, the<br>
holding pawl 18, and the reaction plate 17 to the non-turnable part 3 of the<br>
connection to prevent turning of the torque tool in an opposite direction.<br>
The drive plate 16 and correspondingly the nut 6 perform a<br>
partial stroke, and the nut 6 is turned over a predetermined angle, for<br>
example 20-30°. To turn the nut 6 further, the immovable part of the tool,<br>
for example the cylinder 12 of the drive 11 and the side plates 15, are<br>
displaced towards the drive plate 16. During this displacement the holding<br>
pawl 8 ratchets over the corresponding teeth of the reaction plate 17.<br>
Then the drive 11 is activated again, and the piston rod 14 is<br>
extended from the cylinder 12 to act again on the drive plate 16 and to<br>
turn the drive plate 16 in a further stroke over a further angle. During this<br>
14<br><br>
stage the same process takes place, namely the action force provided by<br>
the drive 11 is applied by the drive plate 16 to the nut 6 of the connection,<br>
while the reaction force is transmitted through the side plate 15, the pawl<br>
18, and the reaction plate 17 to the non-turnable part 3 of the connection.<br>
The reaction plate 17 is removable from the corresponding<br>
side plate. It can be located on one axial side of the side plates 15 as<br>
shown in Figure 4, for example, for tightening of the connection. Then, it<br>
can be removed and placed on the opposite side of the side plates 15, for<br>
example, for loosening the connection. While in the first position, the<br>
holding pawl 18 cooperates with one set of teeth, for example the teeth 30'<br>
of the reaction plate 17, in the second position when the reaction plate is<br>
placed on the opposite side of the side plates 15 the pawl 18 cooperates<br>
with the other set of teeth, for example the teeth 30", of the reaction plate<br>
17. The teeth 30' and 30" can be inclined to provide holding of the<br>
reaction plate 17 by the pawl 18 during turning of the nut 6, and to allow<br>
ratcheting of the pawl 18 over the teeth during the displacement of the<br>
cylinder 12 of the drive 11 with the side plates 15 towards the drive plate<br>
16.<br>
15<br><br>
It will be understood that each of the elements described<br>
above, or two or more together, may also find a useful application in other<br>
types of constructions differing from the type described above.<br>
While the invention has been illustrated and described as<br>
embodied in a torque tool for tightening or loosening a connection as well<br>
as to a method for tightening or loosening the same, it is not intended to<br>
be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural<br>
changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the<br>
gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current<br>
knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting<br>
features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential<br>
characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention.<br>

reaction element with a ratcheting action.<br>
16.	A method as defined in claim 15, further comprising<br>
providing means for holding said stationary part and said reaction element<br>
immovable relative to one another when said driving element is turned by<br>
said drive and turns the turnable part of the connection, but allowing a<br>
movement of said stationary part relative to said reaction element when<br>
said drive is displaced toward said driving element.<br>
17.	A method as defined in claim 16, further comprising<br>
forming said holding means as a holding pawl mounted on one of said<br>
stationary parts and said reaction element, and tooth means provided on<br>
the other of said stationary part and said reaction element and configured<br>
such that said holding pawl engages said tooth means to hold said<br>
23<br><br>
stationary part and said reaction element non-turnable relative to one<br>
another during turning of said driving element by said drive, but allows<br>
ratcheting of said holding pawl over said tooth means when said drive is<br>
displaced toward said driving element.<br>
18.	A method as defined in claim 14, further comprising<br>
connecting said reaction plate removably with said stationary part such<br>
that it is mountable alternatingly on one axial side of said stationary part or<br>
on another axial side of said stationary part.<br>
19.	A method as defined in claim 13, further comprising<br>
providing said driving element and said stationary part with means<br>
allowing turning of said driving element relative to said stationary part and<br>
including interacting projection and groove means engageable with one<br>
another and slidable relative to one another around said axis.<br>
20.	A method as defined in claim 14, further comprising<br>
providing said stationary part and said reaction element with means<br>
allowing turning of said stationary part relative to said reaction element<br>
24<br><br>
25<br>
and including interengaging projection and groove means slidable relative<br>
to one another around said axis.<br><br>
A torque tool for tightening or loosening connections has a<br>
driving element engageable with a turnable part of the connection for<br>
turning the turnable part of the connection for tightening or loosening the<br>
connection and turnable about an axis, and a power drive configured for<br>
acting on the driving element such that the drive acts on the driving<br>
element to turn the driving element and thereby to turn the turnable part of<br>
the connection over a partial stroke and a space is formed between the<br>
drive and the driving element, and the drive is then displaced over the<br>
space toward the driving element to act again on the driving element to<br>
turn the driving element and thereby to further turn the turnable part of the<br>
connection over a further partial stroke.<br></td>
