3 PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cellulose based wastes and to a process for the treatment of cellulose based wastes contaminated with hazardous and/or valuable substances such as to on one hand free the cellulose based material from the hazardous contaminants and on the other hand also favour recovery of the valuable contents from such cellulose based wastes involving room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). More particularly, the present invention is directed to developing an environment friendly method for the treatment of cellulose based wastes such as tissue paper, cotton, card board or like. It is well known that these cellulose based materials are regularly used in chemical industries as well as different R&amp;D laboratories, which regularly generate substantial volumes of such wastes such as contaminated tissue paper, cotton, cloth, card board etc. containing either toxic/hazardous material such as lead, arsenic, mercury, boron etc. or potentially useful/valuable materials such as platinum group metals (e.g. palladium) and like chemical compounds. The invention would thus provide "a method to treat such cellulose based wastes and prevent on one hand the disposal of such hazardous /harmful waste to environment and on the other hand the loss of valuable contaminants from such cellulose wastes .Importantly, the simple, clean and green process of the present invention would thus enable both the recovery of valuables and isolation of hazardous materials apart from favouring the recycling of treated cellulose so as to generate minimum waste or dispose no waste into environment and thereby adhere to the stringent environmental and safety standards and regulations. The invention is directed to favoring recycling of all the inventories and regenerating cellulose pulp and thereby provide prospects for its beneficial application and use in waste treatment and recovery process in a large segment of chemical and other industries, dealing with similar nature of wastes containing toxic and/or valuables, with substantial economic significance and protection of environment.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is known in the art that the cellulose based wastes such as tissue paper, cotton, cloth etc. are made up of cellulose, which is a major component of plant material and abundantly available polysaccharide on earth. Cellulose is a linear homopolymer composed of 100 to 3000 units of D-glucopyranose connected through (1^4)-p-glycosidic linkage with adjacent units resulting in a polymer.<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
Cellulose being one of the most abundant biorenewable material has been put to diverse applications and uses over the years. This has also necessitated development of variety of forms of cellulose fibres and compositions for desired benefit characteristics in end use/applications.<br>
US Patent 5,919,412 entitled "Cellulose Fibre" is directed to an amine-oxide process for the production of a cellulose moulded body, wherein a suspension of cellulose in an aqueous tertiary amine-oxide is converted into a cellulose solution which is moulded and passed through an aqueous precipitation bath. A moulded body is obtained which, optionally after washing, is treated with a crosslinking agent. The cellulose solution contains a substance whereby the crosslinking agent may be activated. The process according to the invention allows the production of fibres having effectively controllable fibrillation properties.<br>
US Patent 6,392,034 is related to microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) which describes a method of MCC production involving first, treating a cellulose source material with an alkaline solution which induces swelling of the cellulose source material; second, addition of hydrogen peroxide and/or other peroxides to reduce viscosity; and third, separation of MCC from the suspension. The alkaline MCC obtained is thereafter treated with an acid solution to become pH neutral. The MCC is separated and is then ready for drying, and subsequent use in commercial applications.<br>
US Patent 5,252,117 is directed to cellulosic compositions and discloses that cellulosic materials are physically and/or chemically modified by contact with a combination of urea and sulfuric acid in which at least 25 percent of the sulfuric acid is present as the monourea adduct of sulfuric acid. The cellulosic materials thus treated is stated to possess uniquely modified physical and chemical properties. The method according to the cited art can be employed to weaken the physical structure of the cellulosic material and thereby to assist in clearing land of vegetation and vegetation residue and in compacting and other processing of waste cellulosic materials. The methods of this prior art is stated to be also employed to increase the food value of cellulosic materials for animals, including humans, and, in particular, to increase the food value of such materials for ruminant mammals.<br>
Importantly, with the growing needs of cellulose and its applications/uses and the present day concerns on increasing industrial pollution and consequent governmental regulations, the need to implement lgreen' processes to prevent pollution and waste production and to<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
utilize renewable resources has come into prominence. This has lead to the need for also for developing efficient  methods for dissolving and derivatizing cellulose .<br>
US Patent 6,824,599 teaches the dissolution and processing of cellulose using ionic liquids and states about the dissolution of cellulose in an ionic liquid without derivatization, and possible regeneration in a range of structural forms without requiring the use of harmful or volatile organic solvents. The patent also discusses about cellulose solubility and that the solution properties can be controlled by the selection of the ionic liquid constituents, with small cations and halide or pseudohalide anions favoring solution.<br>
It is a long standing practice in chemical industries dealing with a wide range of different chemicals, disposing harmful as well as potentially useful metals and compounds as waste to the environment prompting serious detriment to the environment and at the same time loosing valuable metals which are precious and can possibly be recovered with economic advantage. More importantly, it is well known that the chemical industries and the research laboratories generate significant volumes of cellulose based wastes such as tissue paper, cotton, cloth and card board etc., containing either toxic wastes like lead, arsenic mercury, boron etc or potentially useful chemical compounds such as those bearing platinum group metals or the like. Treatment of tissue paper waste and the recovery of valuable metals and compounds from such compounds have not been dealt with seriously until recently and are usually disposed to the environment as untreated waste with consequential obvious  creating health hazards.<br>
However, with the growing consciousness in recent years about the safety and protection of environment, and the consequent imposition of stringent environmental and safety regulations/standards the same has necessitated the development of clean and green processes that generate minimum waste or dispose no harmful waste into the environment.<br>
Currently, cellulose based/Tissue paper waste contaminated with innocuous metals is normally disposed in environment for bio-degradation. However, the same treatment is not applicable for tissue papers contaminated with hazardous metals. Some industries adopt incineration for treating combustible wastes such as tissue paper contaminated with hazardous metals. This method results in complete destruction of cellulose matrix and achieves large volume reduction. The hazardous metals are recovered from the incinerated ash by traditional but tedious aqueous based methods, which generate large<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
volume of secondary wastes. The ash containing hazardous metals are immobilized into a suitable matrix. Combustion of tissue paper affects the atmosphere due to the emission of off-gases, which leads to global warming. However, with increase in public consciousness about the safety and protection of environment in the recent years, and the consequent stringent environmental and safety regulations, demanded clean and green processes that generate minimum wastes or dispose no-wastes to environment, aims at recovery of valuables and recycling of wastes.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a process for treatment of cellulose wastes such as tissue papers, cotton, cloth, card board etc. whereby it would be possible to eliminate or recover the toxic chemicals or valuable metal/compounds in said waste generated from the chemical industry or research laboratories so as to on one hand avoid environmental pollution by making disposal of such wastes safer and on the other hand enable recovery, conversion, separation of wastes into useful products of consumption and thereby also minimize waste.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a novel, simple, industrially applicable clean and green method for the treatment of the cellulose wastes including the tissue papers, cotton, cloth, card board etc. contaminated with hazardous and valuable metals/compounds involving Room Temperature Ionic Liquids(RTILs) such that the valuables are recovered and the hazardous compounds are isolated after the treatment.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is directed to the treatment of cellulose waste contaminated with toxic chemicals or containing valuable metals or compounds wherein the cellulose pulp is regenerated and all the inventories of recovered metals/compounds are recycled in the process.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is directed to a process for treatment of cellulose wastes with selective RTILs that is environment friendly by eliminating toxic wastes or converting to harmless by-product and eliminating all possible green house gases which are liberated in alternative methods like the incineration etc. for treating such cellulose based wastes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFRENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING EXAMPLES AND FIGURES<br>
The present invention as discussed above is thus directed to a simple , efficient and more importantly environment friendly process for the treatment of contaminated cellulose wastes such as tissue papers, cotton, cloth and the like, contaminated with the toxic metals/compounds like the lead, arsenic mercury, boron etc. and also some valuable/useful materials/compounds.<br>
Reference is invited to accompanying Figure 1 which illustrates by way of a schematic representation of the process of treatment of cellulose based waste in particular contaminated tissue paper waste in accordance with the present invention. As clearly illustrated in Figure 1, the waste tissue paper is first dissolved in the selective BmimCI at 353K and thereafter the same is diluted with the addition of DMSO solvent. This resulted in the liquid containing BmimCI alongwith DMSO and tissue paper and insolubles.<br>
The insolubles thus separated In the liquid is recovered whereby the Boron (B) and other insolubles in the waste get separated. This according to the process favours achieving the separation of the contaminants from the tissue paper waste.<br>
As further illustrated in the figure 1, the addition of water post separation of the insolubles favours regeneration of the tissue paper pulp from the dissolved cellulose. After the separation of the thus regenerated cellulose pulp the liquid containing the DMSO, BmimCI and water is recycled into the process for the dissolution of fresh tissue paper waste after distilling water from the mixture.<br>
The above process of the invention establishes a simple, industrially adaptable and clean and green process for treatment of tissue paper wastes. The contaminants like hazardous metals are isolated and valuables are recovered after selective dissolution of cellulose wastes e.g. tissue paper. After the recovery of useful/valuables by any conventional method of separation, cellulose pulp is regenerated and recycled. The process developed according to the present invention does not generate any additional waste during processing and is thus environment friendly.<br>
The above thus illustrates the process of cellulose based waste dissolution involving treatment of combustible cellulose waste by using room temperature ionic liquid, such as<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
l-buty!-3-methylimidazolium chloride and the recovery of hazardous and potentially useful compounds from such waste by exploiting the unique properties of RTIL. The cellulose pulp was regenerated by adding surplus water after recovery. A similar procedure may be applicable to the treatment of other cellulose based wastes comprising tissue paper, cotton, cloth, card board etc. and recovery of valuables. The method can be used to recycle all the inventories minimizing the additional waste generation. The present process for cellulose waste treatment is simple, efficient and discharges negligible waste to environment. All the processing reagents and inventories are recyclable including the by-product cellulose pulp.<br>
Usually the cellulose based wastes including tissue paper waste are contaminated with materials like boron, boron carbide (B4C), and metals (for e.g. platinum/palladium) and the above process of the invention can be applied involving the RTIL preferably l-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (bmimCI) as the ionic liquid and also the subsequent recovery of cellulose pulp or isolation of the harmful chemical contaminants.<br>
Further the method of treatment of the tissue paper waste in the selective RTIL, the bmimCI, used in the present invention is illustrated in greater detail hereunder by way of the following non-limiting examples:<br>
EXAMPLE I:<br>
Dissolution of tissue paper :<br>
Dissolution studies were performed without any pretreatment to cellulose based contaminated waste e.g. tissue paper procured from conventional/known industrial source of generation. The mass of 1 m (L) x 0.1 m (W) tissue paper is 3.6 g. The desired weight of tissue paper (max 1.5 -1.7 g) and the ionic liquid, l-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (bmimCI) weighing 10 g, was taken in a container at a temperature less than 373 K. The content was placed in a constant temperature oil bath for heating. The tissue paper was immersed in the ionic liquid during dissolution and the container was removed from bath once the solution was homogeneous. The rate of dissolution based on the variance in loading was studied and noted as represented in accompanying Figure 2.<br>
Reference is now invited to the accompanying Figure 2 wherein the time required for complete dissolution of tissue paper in l-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride at various<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
extent of loading(wt.%) of tissue paper at 373 K has been shown. It was observed that when the loading of tissue paper was 5 wt.%, rapid dissolution occured with in 30-40 minutes resulting in a homogeneous but highly viscous solution. Increasing the amount of tissue paper increased the time required for dissolution. The ionic liquid, bmimCI dissolved nearly 5 wt.% to 7 wt.% of tissue paper rapidly in less than 60 minutes even at 353 K. Disruption or breaking of inter chain hydrogen bonding followed by the preferential formation of hydrogen bonding between chloride ion of bmimCI with -OH groups of cellulose chain is rationalized to be the reason for dissolution. Cellulose waste e.g. tissue paper having &gt;10 wt.% loading was found to be difficult to dissolve and the limiting solubility of tissue paper was thus determined at 15 wt.% to 17 wt.% in bmimCI.<br>
EXAMPLE II:<br>
Recovery of bmimCI -insolubles from tissue paper:<br>
Dissolution of chemical and metallic compounds contaminated tissue paper was conducted by dissolving 0.5 g of tissue paper containing 0.05 g to 0.5 g of contaminants such as B, B4C and Pd, in bmimCI (10 g) at around 373 K. Heating was continued till the tissue paper was dissolved. The viscous mixture was cooled to ambient temperatures and 20 mL - 50 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added to reduce the viscosity. The entire mixture containing the solution of tissue paper in bmimCl-DMSO and the residue contaminants was centrifuged. A clear supernatant is found to be separated and the residue was washed with DMSO and the washings were added to supernatant solution. The cellulose pulp was regenerated by adding surplus water to the supernatant. Cellulose pulp, which settled down, was centrifuged and separated. The water from bmimCl-DMSO was separated by distilling at 373 K and DMSO was distilled from bmimCI under vacuum.<br>
It was found through studies of the cellulose wastes treatment process that dissolution of 5 wt.% loaded tissue paper in bmimCI (10 g) was complete with in 30 minutes. Boron (or B4C or Pd) remained as a residue after dissolution. A co-solvent DMSO (20 mL to 50 mL) was added to the resultant solution to obtain favourable hydrodynamic properties, especially to reduce the viscosity. The solution was then centrifuged to separate the supernatant. The cellulose pulp in the supernatant solution was regenerated by adding surplus water, which aided reconstitution of intermolecular hydrogen bonds with adjacent linear networks. The mixture was centrifuged to separate the pulp and the solution phase containing ionic liquid, DMSO and water is separated.   Since bmimCI exhibited negligible<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
vapour pressure, DMSO and water present in the solution are distilled under reduced pressure. The separated phases was recycled.<br>
The above thus confirmed the suitability of using bmimCI for the separation of insoluble (in bmimCI) materials from cellulose based wastes. The study established the advantages of dissolving tissue paper waste and other cellulose based materials contaminated with hazardous (arsenic, antimony, lead, mercury, boron etc) and valuables (platinum group metals) in the ionic fiquid bmimCI, and the simple quantitative recovery of valuables from the resultant solution. The "cellulose pulp could be simply regenerated by adding surplus water after the recovery. Isolation of hazardous metals on one hand eliminate environment pollution or unsafe occupational practices by protecting from possible contamination with hazardous metals and on the other hand provides significant incentives through recovery of valuables. Importantly, the secondary waste generated during the process was insignificant and the process enabled recycling of inventories (atom economy) inclusive of cellulose.<br>
Thus the present process for cellulose waste dissolution and separation of contaminants by such treatment of tissue paper wastes contaminated with hazardous and valuable metals would also enable quantitative recovery of these contaminants thus favoring gainful waste recovery, while protecting environmental degradation. Advantageously, The process can also be extended to the recovery of any metals and their salts that are insoluble in tonic liquid (bmimCI) and similarly this process is applicable to other cellulose based materials like cotton, cloth, card board, wood etc.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for an industrially viable and environmentally beneficial process of treatment of cellulose based wastes/tissue papers containing hazardous contaminants and/or valuable metals and compounds, generated out of industrial or laboratory based chemical wastes, disposing cellulose based product used for routine cleaning or wiping. Importantly, the invention would provide for the much desired simple, industrially adaptable, clean and green method for treating cellulose based/tissue paper wastes, the recovery of valuables for further use, while the hazardous contaminants are isolated. Advantageously, the invention further provides a method to reduce the pollution of the environment and thus eliminates the adverse effects from pollutants in cellulose based wastes apart from also enabling recycling of all inventories making it cost effective and affordable by all .<br>
