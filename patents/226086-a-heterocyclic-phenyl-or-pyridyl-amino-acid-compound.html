Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The compounds of the formula I of the present<br>
invention may be prepared according to the following<br>
general synthetic schemes, as well as relevant published<br>
literature procedures that are used by one skilled in the<br>
art. Exemplary reagents and procedures for these<br>
reactions appear hereinafter and in the working Examples.<br>
Protection and deprotection in the Schemes below may be<br><br>
carried out by procedures generally known in the art<br>
(see, for example, Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M.,<br>
Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, 1999<br>
[Wiley] ) .<br>
Scheme 1 describes a general synthesis of the amino<br>
acids described in this invention. An alcohol II<br>
(R5(CH2)XOH) (of which the most favored is 2-phenyl-5-<br>
methyl-oxazole-4-ethanol) is coupled with a hydroxy arylor<br>
heteroaryl- aldehyde III (preferably 3- or 4-<br>
hydroxybenzaldehyde) under standard Mitsunobu reaction<br>
conditions (e.g. Mitsunobu, 0., Synthesis , 1981, 1).<br>
The resulting aldehyde IV is then subjected to reductive<br>
amination using procedures known in the literature (e.g.<br>
Abdel-Magid et al, J. Org. Chem. 1996, '61, 3849) with an<br>
a-amino ester hydrochloride V. PG in Scheme 1 denotes a<br>
preferred carboxylic acid protecting group, such as a<br>
methyl or tert-butyl ester. The resulting secondary<br>
amino-ester VI is then subjected to a second reductive<br>
amination using methods known in the literature (e.g.<br>
Abdel-Magid et al, J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 3849) with an<br>
R3a aldehyde VII. Final deprotection of the carboxylic<br>
acid ester under standard conditions known in the<br>
literature (Greene) utilizing basic conditions (for<br>
methyl esters) or acidic conditions (for tert-butyl<br>
esters) then furnishes the desired amino acid products<br>
ID.<br>
An alternative route to the aldehyde IV is shown in<br>
Scheme 1A. The alcohol II (R5(CH2)XOH) (of which the most<br>
favored is 2-[2-phenyl-5-methyl-oxazole-4-yl]-ethanol) is<br>
treated with methanesulfonyl chloride to give the<br>
corresponding mesylate VIII. The mesylate is then<br>
alkylated under standard basic conditions with a<br>
hydroxyaryl or hydroxyheteroaryl aldehyde III to furnish<br>
the aldehyde IV.<br>
An alternative route to the amino acids IF is shown<br>
in Scheme 2. The secondary amino-ester VI is deprotected<br>
under standard conditions (basic conditions if the<br>
protecting group (PG) is methyl; acidic conditions if PG<br>
is tert-butyl) to furnish the corresponding amino acid<br>
IE. Reductive amination with an R3a aldehyde under<br>
analogous conditions as described in Scheme 1 furnishes<br>
the desired tertiary amino acid products IF.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 3, the tertiary<br>
amino acids IF may also be obtained by alkylation of the<br>
secondary amino-ester VI with an alkylating agent IX<br>
(with an appropriate leaving group (LG) such as halide,<br>
mesylate, or tosylate) under standard conditions known in<br>
the art followed again by standard deprotection of the<br>
carboxylic acid ester X to provide the amino acids IF.<br>
As shown in Scheme 4, the tertiary amino acid IF<br>
may also be assembled through reductive amination first<br>
of the R3a aldehyde XI with an appropriate amine ester<br>
hydrochloride V. The resulting secondary amine-ester XII<br>
then is subjected to reductive amination with the<br>
appropriate alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl aldehyde IV (as in<br>
Scheme 1) followed by deprotection of the carboxylic acid<br>
ester to give the desired amino acid analogs IF.<br>
For further substituted amino acids, a general<br>
synthetic scheme is shown in Scheme 5. Reductive<br>
amination of an appropriate amine XIII with an aryl or<br>
heteroaryl aldehyde XIV under standard conditions<br>
furnishes the corresponding secondary amine XV, which is<br>
then reacted with a halide-ester XVI (e.g. tert-butyl<br>
bromoacetate) to furnish the corresponding a-amino ester<br>
XVII. This amine-ester XVII is then deprotected under<br>
standard conditions to provide the desired amino acid<br>
analogs IF.<br>
The synthetic route in Scheme 5 also provides a<br>
general scheme for the synthesis of the corresponding<br>
aminophosphonic acids IFA, as illustrated in Scheme 5a.<br>
The secondary amine XV is reacted with an appropriately<br>
protected halide-phosphonate XVIA to provide the<br>
corresponding aminophosphonate ester XVIIA, which is then<br>
deprotected under standard conditions (Greene &amp; Wuts) to<br>
furnish the amino phosphohic acid IFA. Scheme 5b<br>
illustrates the synthesis of the aminophosphinic acids<br>
IFB, which again involves the reaction of an<br>
appropriately protected halide-phosphinate ester XVIB<br>
with the secondary amine XV. Deprotection of the<br>
resulting aminophosphinate ester then provides the<br>
phosphinic acid IFB.<br>
An alternative to the sequence in Scheme 5 is shown<br>
in Scheme 6. A hydroxyaryl or heteroaryl amine XVIII is<br>
selectively protected on nitrogen to provide protected<br>
amine XIX. A preferred R5(CH2 )nOH (II) is then reacted<br>
with XIX under Mitsunobu conditions to provide the<br>
corresponding ether, followed by deprotection of the<br>
amine, to form the free amine XX. The free amine XX is<br>
then activated with a standard activating group (2,4-<br>
dinit robenzenesulf onamide; T. Fukuyama et al, Tetrahedron<br>
Lett. 1997, 38, 5831) and is then treated with an a-halo<br>
ester XVI as in Scheme 5. The 2,4 dinitrobenzenesulfonamide<br>
XXI is deprotected under literature<br>
conditions (T. Fukuyama et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1997,<br>
38, 5831) to furnish a secondary a-amino-ester XXII which<br>
is then subjected to a reductive amination with an R3a<br>
aldehyde XI followed by deprotection of the ester X to<br>
furnish the desired analogs IF.<br>
Scheme 7 describes an alternative general route to<br>
the amino acid analogs IG. A hydroxyaryl or heteroaryl<br>
aldehyde III is subjected to the usual reductive<br>
amination conditions with an appropriate amine—ester<br>
hydrochloride V. The resulting secondary amine-ester<br>
XXIII is functionalized, in this case by a second<br>
reductive amination with an R3a aldehyde VII to furnish<br>
the corresponding hydroxy tertiary amine-ester XXIV.<br>
This can now undergo a Mitsunobu reaction with a<br>
preferred alcohol II (R5(CH2 ) nOH) which followed by<br>
deprotection of the ester XXV furnishes the desired<br>
analogs IG.<br>
Scheme 8 describes a general synthesis of diaryl<br>
and aryl-heteroaryl-substituted amino acid analogs IH.<br>
The secondary amine-ester XXII undergoes reductive<br>
amination with an appropriately substituted formyl phenyl<br>
boronic acid XXVI under standard conditions to give the<br>
corresponding tertiary amine-ester boronic acid XXVII.<br>
The aryl boronic acid XXVII can then undergo a Suzuki<br>
coupling (e.g. conditions as described in Gibson, S. E.,<br>
Transition Metals in Organic Synthesis, A Practical<br>
Approach, pp. 47-50, 1997) with aryl or heteroaryl<br>
halides XXVIII (especially bromides) to furnish the<br>
appropriate cross-coupling diaryl products XXIX.<br>
Deprotection of the amine-ester XXIX generates the<br>
desired amino acid analogs IH.<br>
Scheme 9 describes a general synthesis of diaryl<br>
and aryl-heteroaryl ether-substituted amino acid analogs<br>
IJ. The tertiary amine-ester boronic acid XXVII which is<br>
described in Scheme 8 can be coupled with appropriately<br>
substituted phenols XXX under literature conditions (D.<br>
A. Evans et al, Tetrahedron Lett.,. 1998, 39, 2937) to<br>
furnish the appropriate diaryl or aryl-heteroaryl ethers<br>
XXXI, which after deprotection afford the desired amino<br>
acid analogs IJ.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 10, reductive<br>
amination of the secondary amine-ester XXII with an<br>
appropriately substituted hydroxyaryl or<br>
hydroxyheteroaryl aldehyde XXXII furnishes the<br>
corresponding phenol-tertiary amine-ester XXXIII. The<br>
phenol XXXIII can then undergo coupling with appropriate<br>
aryl or heteroaryl boronic acids XXXIV under literature<br>
conditions (D. A. Evans et al, Tetrahedron Lett., 1998,<br>
39, 2937) to furnish the corresponding diaryl or<br>
arylheteroaryl ether-amino esters XXXI. The desired<br>
analogs IJ are then obtained after deprotection of the<br>
amine-ester XXXI.<br>
Scheme 11 illustrates the synthesis of the<br>
carbamate-acid analogs IK. The secondary amine-ester<br>
XXII can be reacted with appropriate chloroformates XXXV<br>
under standard literature conditions (optimally in CHzCla<br>
or CHC13 in the presence of a base such as Et3N) to<br>
furnish the corresponding carbamate-esters. The<br>
requisite analogs IK are then obtained after deprotection<br>
of the carbaraate-ester. Alternatively, the secondary<br>
amine-ester XXII can be reacted with phosgene to generate<br>
the corresponding carbamyl chloride XXXVI. This carbamyl<br>
chloride intermediate XXXVI can be reacted with R3a-OH<br>
(XXXVII)(optimally substituted phenols) to afford the<br>
corresponding carbamate-acids IK after deprotection.<br>
Scheme 12 illustrates the further functionalization<br>
of aryl carbamate-acid analogs IK. The secondary amineester<br>
XXII is reacted with an aryl chloroformate XXXVIII<br>
(containing a protected hydroxyl group) to form XXXIX.<br>
The hydroxyl group is then selectively deprotected in the<br>
presence of the ester functionality to provide XL, then<br>
alkylated with an appropriate R6-LG (XLI) (where LG is<br>
halide, mesylate or tosylate, and R6 is most preferably<br>
CHF2-, or CH3CH2-) in the presence of base. Deprotection<br>
of the ester then furnishes the desired carbamate-acid<br>
analogs IL.<br>
The secondary amine-ester XXIIA can be<br>
functionalized with substituted aryl or aliphatic<br>
carboxylic acids XLII, under standard peptide coupling<br>
conditions, as illustrated in Scheme 13. The amide bondforming<br>
reactions are conducted under standard peptide<br>
coupling procedures known in the art. Optimally, the<br>
reaction is conducted in a solvent such as DMF at 0°C to<br>
RT using l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide<br>
(EDAC or EDCI or WSC), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) or<br>
l-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAT) and a base, for<br>
example Hunig's base (diisopropylethylamine), N-methyl<br>
morpholine or triethylamine. Deprotection of the amideester<br>
then furnishes the desired amide-acid analogs IM.<br>
The secondary amine-ester XXIIA can also be reacted<br>
with aliphatic or aryl isocyanates XLIII to provide the<br>
corresponding urea-esters. Deprotection of the ureaester<br>
provides the desired urea-acid analogs IN, as shown<br>
in Scheme 14. Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 15, the<br>
carbamyl chloride intermediate XXXVI described in Scheme<br>
11 can be reacted with appropriate aliphatic or aryl<br>
amines XLIV in the presence of a tertiary amine (e.g.<br>
Et3N) to furnish tri- or tetrasubstituted urea-acid<br>
analogs 10 or IP after deprotection of the ester.<br>
The secondary amine-ester XXIIA can also be reacted<br>
with appropriate sulfonyl chlorides XLVI under standard<br>
literature conditions (optimally in the presence of a<br>
base such as pyridine, either neat or using chloroform as<br>
a co-solvent), followed by deprotection, to provide the<br>
corresponding sulfonamide-acids IQ, as shown in Scheme<br>
16.<br>
Replacement of the carboxylic acid functionality in<br>
these analogs with tetrazole can be achieved as shown in<br>
Scheme 17. An acid analog IK is coupled with an amine<br>
(containing an appropriate tetrazole protecting group)<br>
XLVII (preferably 3-amino propionitrile) under standard<br>
peptide coupling conditions. The resulting secondary<br>
amide XLVIII is then subjected to a Mitsunobu reaction<br>
under standard conditions with trimethylsilyl azide<br>
(TMSN3) to form the protected tetrazole XLIX.<br>
Deprotection of the cyanoethyl group, is achieved<br>
preferentially in the presence of base to generate the<br>
desired free tetrazole analog IR.<br>
Scheme 18 describes a general synthesis of the<br>
hydrazide-acid analogs IS. A substituted aryl carboxylic<br>
acid 1 is treated with methanesulfonyl chloride in the<br>
presence of base; the intermediate is then reacted with a<br>
protected hydrazine-ester VA to give the corresponding<br>
acylated hydrazine la (ref: Synthesis, 1989, 745-747).<br>
The acylhydrazine la is coupled with an appropriately<br>
substituted aryl aldehyde IV under reductive amination<br>
conditions to give the corresponding protected hydrazide<br>
ester 3 (ref: Can. J. Cham., 1998, 76, 1180-1187).<br>
Deprotection of the ester 3 then furnishes the hydrazideacid<br>
analogs IS.<br>
An alternative synthetic approach to hydrazideacids<br>
IS is shown in Scheme 19. An aryl aldehyde IV can<br>
be reduced to the corresponding alcohol under standard<br>
conditions (e.g NaBH4) . This alcohol is then converted to<br>
the corresponding bromide 4 using standard conditions<br>
(e.g. Ph3P/CBr4 or PBr3) . The bromide 4 is then reacted<br>
with the hydrazine -ester la (ref: Tetrahedron Lett.,<br>
1993, 34, 207-210) to furnish the protected hydrazideester<br>
3, which is then deprotected to give the hydrazideacid<br>
analogs IS.<br>
The different approaches to the preparation of the<br>
a-alkylbenzyl amino acid and carbamate-acid analogs IT<br>
and IU are exemplified in the following synthetic<br>
schemes. In Scheme 20 an appropriately substituted aryl<br>
aldehyde IV is treated with a suitable organometallic<br>
reagent (e.g. a Grignard reagent R10MgBr) under standard<br>
conditions to give the corresponding secondary alcohol,<br>
which is then oxidized under standard conditions (e.g.<br>
Swern oxidation with (COCl)2/DMSO/Et3N or using pyridinium<br>
chlorochromate) to give the corresponding ketone 5.<br>
Reductive amination of the ketone 5 with an appropriately<br>
substituted amino-ester 6 provides the corresponding aalkylbenzyl<br>
amino-ester 7. It will be understood that in<br>
the amino ester 6, the moiety x 'n does not necessarily<br>
represent two repeating units .<br>
Acylation of amino-ester 7 with an appropriately<br>
substituted aryl or heteroaryl chloroformate XXXV<br>
followed by deprotection provides the racemic carbamateacid<br>
analogs IT. Reductive amination of alkylbenzyl<br>
amino-ester 7 with aryl aldehyde VII followed by<br>
deprotection provides the racemic amino-acid analogs IU.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 21, asymmetric<br>
reduction (e.g. using the Corey oxazaborolidine reduction<br>
protocol; review: E. J. Corey &amp; C. Helal, Angew. Chem.<br>
Jut. Ed. Engl., 1998, 37, 1986-2012.) of the aryl-ketone<br>
5 provides each of the desired enantiomeric alcohols 8<br>
(although only one enantiomer is represented in the<br>
scheme) . Treatment of the chiral alcohol 8 with azide in<br>
a Mitsunobu-like reaction (ref: A. S. Thompson et. al.,<br>
J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58, 5886-5888) gives the<br>
corresponding chiral azide (with inverted stereochemistry<br>
from the starting alcohol) . The azide is then converted<br>
to the amine 9 by standard reduction methods (e.g.<br>
hydrogenation or Ph3P/THF/H2O) . Treatment of the chiral<br>
amine 9 with an ester XVIA (containing an appropriate<br>
leaving group) provides the secondary amino-ester 10.<br>
Acylation of amino-ester 10 with an aryl or heteroaryl<br>
chloroformate XXXV followed by deprotection provides the<br>
chiral carbamate-acid analogs ITa (which may be either<br>
enantiomer depending upon the stereochemistry of 8) .<br>
Reductive amination of alkyl amino-ester 10 with aryl<br>
aldehydes VII followed by deprotection provides the<br>
chiral amino-acid analogs lUa (which may be either<br>
enantiomer depending upon the stereochemistry of 8) .<br>
An alternative to Scheme 21 is shown in Scheme 22 ,<br>
An appropriately protected oxyaryl ketone 11 undergoes<br>
asymmetric reduction to give the chiral alcohol 12. This<br>
is converted to the chiral amine 13 via the identical<br>
sequence as in Scheme 21 (via the chiral azide) .<br>
Treatment of the chiral amine 13 with an ester XVIA (LG =<br>
halogen or mesylate) gives the corresponding secondary<br>
amino-ester 14. Acylation of 14 with an aryl or<br>
heteroaryl chloroformate XXXV provides the corresponding<br>
carbamate-ester. Selective deprotection furnishes the<br>
free phenol carbamate-ester 15. Alkylation of the phenol<br>
15 with a halide or mesylate VIII followed by<br>
deprotection provides the carbamate-acid analogs ITa. An<br>
analogous sequence (involving reductive amination of the<br>
secondary amino-ester 14 with an aryl or heteroaryl<br>
aldehyde VII, then selective deprotection, alkylation<br>
with VIII and a final deprotection) provides the amino<br>
acid analogs lUa.<br>
It will be appreciated that either the (R) - or (S) -<br>
enantiomer of ITa or lUa may be synthesized in Schemes 21<br>
and 22, depending upon the chirality of the reducing<br>
agent employed.<br>
A fourth synthetic sequence is shown in Scheme 23 .<br>
The substituted aldehyde IV is condensed with an aminoester<br>
hydrochloride 6 to give the corresponding imine 16,<br>
which is then treated in situ with an appropriately<br>
substituted allylic halide 17 in the presence of indium<br>
metal (reference: Loh, T . - P . , et al., Tetrahedron Lett.,<br>
1997, 38, 865-868) to give the a-allyl benzyl amino-ester<br>
18. Acylation of amine 18 with an aryl or heteroaryl<br>
chloroformate XXXV followed by deprotection provides the<br>
carbamate-acid analogs Iv. Reductive amination of alkyl<br>
amino-ester 18 with an aryl or heteroaryl aldehyde VII<br>
followed by deprotection provides the amino-acid analogs<br>
IW.<br>
Scheme 24 shows the preparation of the required<br>
intermediate 2-aryl-5-methyl-oxazol-4-yl methyl chloride<br>
21 (following the general procedure described in Malamas,<br>
M. S., et al, J. Med. Chsm., 1996, 39, 237-245) . A<br>
substituted aryl aldehyde 19 is condensed with butane-<br>
2,3-dione mono-oxime under acidic conditions to give the<br>
corresponding oxazole N-oxide 20. Deoxygenation of the<br>
oxazole N-oxide 20 with concomitant chlorination<br>
furnishes the desired chloromethyl aryl-oxazoles 21.<br>
Hydrolysis of chloromethyl oxazole 21 under basic<br>
conditions furnishes the corresponding oxazole-methanol<br>
22. Oxidation of alcohol 22 to the corresponding<br>
aldehyde is followed by conversion to the corresponding<br>
dibromoalkene 23 (e.g. Ph3P/CBr4) . The dibromide 23 is<br>
converted to the corresponding alkynyl-lithium species<br>
(using an organolithium reagent such as n-BuLi) , which<br>
can be reacted in situ with an appropriate electrophile<br>
such as formaldehyde to give the corresponding acetylenic<br>
alcohol (ref: Corey, E. J. , et al., Tetrahedron Lett.<br>
1972, 3769, or Gangakhedkar, K. K., Synth. Common. 1996,<br>
26, 1887-1896) . This alcohol can then be converted to<br>
the corresponding mesylate 24 and alkylated with an<br>
appropriate phenol 25 to provide analogs Ix. Further<br>
stereoselective reduction (e.g. H2/Lindlar's catalyst)<br>
provides the E- or Z- alkenyl analogs IY.<br>
Scheme 25 describes a general synthesis of the<br>
amino-benzoxazole analogs IZ (general ref: Sato, Y., et<br>
al, J". Med. Chem. 1998, 41, 3015-3021) . An appropriately<br>
substituted ortho-aminophenol 26 is treated with CS2 in<br>
the presence of base to furnish the corresponding<br>
mercapto-benzoxazole 27. Treatment of this thiol 27 with<br>
an appropriate chlorinating agent (e.g. PCls) provides the<br>
key intermediate chlorobenzoxazole 28, which is reacted<br>
with the secondary amino-ester VI to furnish, after<br>
deprotection, the amino benzoxazole-acid analogs IZ.<br>
The thiazole analogs IZa were synthesized according<br>
to the general synthetic route outlined in Scheme 26<br>
(ref. Collins, J. L. , et al., J. Med. Chem. 1998, 41,<br>
5037) . The secondary amino-ester XXIII is reacted with<br>
an aryl or heteroaryl chloroformate XXXV in the presence<br>
of an appropriate base (e.g. pyridine or triethylamine)<br>
to furnish the corresponding hydroxyaryl carbamate-ester<br>
29. The hydroxyaryl ester 29 is then reacted with an<br>
appropriately substituted a-bromo vinyl ketone 29a (for S3<br>
= CH3, e.g. Weyerstahl, P., et. al., Flavour Fra.gr. J.,<br>
1998, 13, 177 or Sokolov, N. A., et al., Zh. Org. Khim. ,<br>
1980, 16, 281-283) in the presence of an appropriate base<br>
(e.g. K2C03) to give the corresponding Michael reaction<br>
adduct, the a-bromoketone carbamate-ester 30. The abromoketone<br>
30 is then subjected to a condensation<br>
reaction with an appropriately substituted aryl amide 31<br>
(A = O) or aryl thioamide 31 (A = S) to furnish either<br>
the corresponding oxazole (from the amide) or the<br>
thiazole (from the thioamide) (ref: Malamas, M. S., et<br>
al, J. Med.'Chem., 1996, 39, 237-245). Finally,<br>
deprotection of esters 31 then provides the substituted<br>
oxazole and thiazole carbamate acid analogs IZa.<br>
It will be appreciated that in the following<br>
schemes where the carbamate-acid analogs are prepared,<br>
the corresponding amino acid analogs may also be prepared<br>
by replacing the chloroformate reaction with an aldehyde<br>
in a reductive amination reaction (as in Scheme 20 with<br>
intermediate amine 7) .<br>
Scheme 27 describes a general synthesis of the<br>
acids IZb and IZc. A halo-substituted aryl aldehyde 32<br>
(preferably iodide or bromide) is subjected to reductive<br>
amination using procedures known in the literature (e.g.<br>
Abdel-Magid et al, J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 3849) with an<br>
a-amino acid ester hydrochloride V. The resulting<br>
secondary amino-ester 33 is then reacted with an aryl or<br>
heteroaryl chloroformate XXXV in the presence of an<br>
appropriate base (e.g. pyridine or triethylatnine) to<br>
furnish the corresponding halo-aryl carbamate-ester 34.<br>
Aryl halide 34 is then reacted with an appropriate arylor<br>
he teroaryl-substituted acetylene 35 (the preferred<br>
acetylene being 5-phenyl-2-methyl-oxazol-4-ylmethylacetylene)<br>
in the presence of an appropriate<br>
palladium catalyst (e.g. (Ph3P)2PdCl2) and a copper (I)<br>
salt (e.g. Cul) in a Sonogashira coupling reaction (ref:<br>
Organocopper Reagents, a Practical Approach, R. J. K.<br>
Taylor, Ed., Chapter 10, pp 217-236, Campbell, I. B.,<br>
Oxford University Press, 1994) to furnish the key<br>
intermediate, arylacetylene carbamate ester 36.<br>
The arylacetylene ester 36 is deprotected to<br>
provide the corresponding arylacetylene acid analogs IZb.<br>
The acetylene moiety of 36 can be reduced by standard<br>
methods (e.g. hydrogenation, ref: M. Hudlicky,<br>
Reductions in Organic Chemistry, 2nd Edition, ACS, 1996,<br>
Chapter 1) to furnish the corresponding fully saturated<br>
alkyl aryl carbamate ester, which is then deprotected to<br>
give the alkyl aryl carbamate acid analogs IZc.<br>
Stereoselective reduction of the acetylene ester 36<br>
by standard methods (e.g. Lindlar's catalyst; ref:<br>
Preparation of Alkenes, A Practical Approach, J. J.<br>
Williams, Ed., Chapter 6, pp 117-136, Oxford University<br>
Press, 1996) can be achieved to provide the corresponding<br>
cis-alkenyl aryl carbamate-ester, which is then<br>
deprotected to furnish the Z-alkenyl aryl carbamate acid<br>
analogs IZd (Scheme 28) . Alternatively, this sequence<br>
can be reversed, i.e. the initial step being the<br>
deprotection of acetylenic ester 36 to the acetylenic<br>
acid, followed by Stereoselective reduction of the<br>
acetylene moiety to provide the Z-alkene-acid analogs<br>
IZd.<br>
The corresponding trans-alkenyl aryl carbamate<br>
acids IZe can be synthesized according to the general<br>
route in Scheme 29. An aryl- or heteroaryl-acetylene 35<br>
(the preferred moiety again being 5-phenyl-2-methyloxazol-<br>
4-yl-methylacetylene) is halogenated under<br>
standard conditions (ref: Boden, C. D. J. et al., J.<br>
Chem. Soc. Parkin Trans. I, 1996, 2417; or Lu, W. et.<br>
al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 9521) to give the<br>
corresponding halo-acetylene, which is then converted to<br>
the corresponding trans-alkenyl stannane 37 (ref: Boden,<br>
C. D. J. , J. Chem. Soc., Parkin Trans. I, 1996, 2417).<br>
This aryl- or heteroaryl-substituted trans-alkenyl<br>
stannane 37 is then coupled with the halo-aryl carbamate<br>
ester 34 under standard Stille coupling conditions (ref:<br>
Farina, V. et. al., "The Stille Reaction", Organic<br>
Reactions, 1997, 50, 1) to furnish the corresponding<br>
trans-alkenyl aryl carbamate ester 38. This carbamateester<br>
is then deprotected under standard conditions to<br>
give the desired trans-alkenyl aryl carbamate acid<br>
analogs IZe.<br>
The corresponding cyclopropyl analogs IZf and IZg<br>
are synthesized according to Scheme 30. For the cis- or<br>
(Z-) cyclopropyl analogs, Stereoselective reduction (H2/<br>
Lindlar's catalyst) of the alkynyl moiety of intermediate<br>
alknyl ester 36 (as for analogs IZd), followed by<br>
cyclopropanation under standard conditions (Zhao, Y . , et<br>
al, <j. org. chem. and finally></j.>
deprotection provides the cis-cyclopropyl carbamate-acid<br>
analogs IZf. For the trans-cyclopropyl analogs IF,<br>
analogous cyclopropanation of the E-alkene moiety of<br>
intermediate 38 followed by deprotection provides the<br>
trans-cyclopropyl carbamate-acid analogs IZg.<br>
