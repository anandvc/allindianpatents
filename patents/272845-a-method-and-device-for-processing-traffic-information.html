DESCRIPTION<br>
PROVIDING ROAD INFORMATION INCLUDING VERTEX DATA<br>
FOR A LINK AND USING THE SAME<br>
1.	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This disclosure relates to providing traffic information<br>
of a road, particularly, information relating to the road.<br>
2.	BACKGROUND ART<br>
With the advancement in digital signal processing and<br>
communication technologies, radio and TV broadcasts are being<br>
digitalized. Digital broadcasting enables provision of various<br>
information (e.g., news, stock prices, weather, traffic<br>
information, etc.) as well as audio and video content.<br>
3.	DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
In one general aspect, a method of processing traffic<br>
information is provided. The method includes receiving link<br>
vertex information including a first identifier and vertex<br>
components that each reveal apposition along a link. The first<br>
identifier enables a determination of a type of information<br>
that is included within the received link vertex information.<br>
The method also includes determining the type of information<br>
included within the received link vertex information based on<br>
the first identifier and identifying vertex components within<br>
the link vertex information only if the first identifier<br>
enables a determination that the received link vertex<br>
information includes at least one vertex component.<br>
Implementations may include one or more additional<br>
features. For instance', receiving link vertex information may<br>
include receiving an indicator of a number of vertex<br>
components that are specified by the link vertex information.<br>
1<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
The number of vertex components included in the link vertex<br>
information may correspond to the number of vertex components<br>
indicated by the indicator. The received indicator may specify<br>
that the link vertex information includes only one vertice,<br>
and the identified vertex component consists of a single<br>
vertex component that reveals a single position along the link<br>
other than a start point and end point. The received indicator<br>
may specify that the link vertex information includes more<br>
than one vertice, and the identified vertex component includes<br>
multiple vertex components that correspondingly reveal<br>
multiple positions along the link other than start point and<br>
end point of the link. The identified vertex components may<br>
each be associated with a sequence value configured to order<br>
the vertex components along the link. Receiving link vertex<br>
information may include receiving the sequence value.<br>
The method may also include receiving information<br>
corresponding to a message management structure including<br>
information corresponding to a generation time of information<br>
reflected in the link vertex information. The generation time<br>
included within the received message management structure may<br>
relate to a plurality of vertex components. The generation<br>
time included within the received message management structure<br>
may relate to a plurality of message component structures that<br>
correspond to a vertex component. Each message component<br>
structure may further include an identifier specific to the<br>
type of information included in the message management<br>
structure and the first identifier may be an identifier, in a<br>
message component structure, specifying the inclusion of a<br>
vertex component. The vertex component may include, for each<br>
vertex component, a sequence value configured to order the<br>
vertex components along the link.<br>
In the method, the vertex component may identify a<br>
longitude and latitude associated with a position along a link<br>

 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
other than a start point and an end point. The vertex<br>
component may include a text descriptor associated with the<br>
vertex component. Receiving link vertex information may-<br>
include decoding the link vertex information such that the<br>
received link vertex information is decoded link vertex<br>
information. Receiving link vertex information may include<br>
identifying a longitude of the vertex position information and<br>
identifying a latitude of the vertex position. The processing<br>
device may be configured to determine link vertex information<br>
is configured to determine a vertex position from information<br>
other than longitude, latitude, or sequence. The position may<br>
be a position along the link other than a start point or an<br>
end point of the link.<br>
In another general aspect, a traffic information<br>
communication device is provided. The device includes a data<br>
receiving interface configured to receive link vertex<br>
information including a link vertex identifier that identifies<br>
the received information as including at least one vertex<br>
component. The data receiving interface also includes an<br>
indication of a number of vertex components that are specified<br>
by the link vertex information and a number of vertex<br>
components corresponding to the indication. At least one of<br>
the vertex components includes a vertex component identifier<br>
that identifies the vertex component as a single one of the<br>
vertex components included within the link vertex information,<br>
vertex position information identifying a position of a vertex<br>
specified by the vertex component as including a position<br>
along a link. The device also includes a processing device<br>
configured to process the link vertex information received<br>
from the data receiving interface. The process includes<br>
determining a type of information included within the received<br>
link vertex information and identifying a vertex position<br>
specified by the vertex components based on. the received<br>
3<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
information.<br>
Implementations may include one or more additional<br>
features. For instance, the vertex position information may<br>
indicate a position along a path other than the shortest path<br>
between the endpoints of the link. The link vertex identifier<br>
may reflect that a single vertex is specified by the link<br>
vertex information, and the number of vertex components<br>
correspondingly include a single vertex component. The vertex<br>
position information may correspond to at least a two-<br>
dimensional position where at least one positional dimension<br>
corresponds to time.<br>
In the device, a set of values may corresponding to the<br>
first dimension may be a function of a set of values<br>
corresponding to time. The vertex position information may<br>
correspond to more than a two-dimensional position. One<br>
dimension may be associated with elevation. The processing<br>
device may be configured to decode information identifying a<br>
longitude of the vertex position and information identifying a<br>
latitude of the vertex position.<br>
Also, in the device, the link vertex information may<br>
include a data length of information used to reveal the vertex<br>
position along the link. The processing device may be<br>
configured to determine a vertex position from information<br>
other than longitude, latitude, or sequence. The processing<br>
device may be configured to receive link vertex information<br>
including information corresponding to a version number of<br>
information reflected in the link vertex information. The<br>
version number may be associated with a specific syntax of the<br>
data where any one of multiple syntaxes may be used.<br>
The processing devuce may be further configured to<br>
receive information corresponding to a message management<br>
structure including information corresponding to a generation<br>
time of information reflected in the link vertex information.<br>
4<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902	PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
The positions may be a position along the link other than a<br>
start point or an end point of the link. The processing device<br>
may be configured to determine the type of information<br>
included within the received link vertex information based on<br>
the link vertex iodentifier and the vertex component<br>
identifier. The processing device may be configured to<br>
identify the vertex position only if the link vertex<br>
identifier and the vertex component identifier enable a<br>
determination that the received link vertex information<br>
includes at least one vertex component<br>
In a further general aspect, a method of processing<br>
traffic information is provided. The method includes means for<br>
receiving link vertex information including a first identifier<br>
and vertex components that each reveal a position along a link.<br>
The first identifier enables a determination of a type of<br>
information that is included within the received link vertex<br>
information. The method also includes means for determining<br>
the type of information included within the received link<br>
vertex information based on the first identifier and means for<br>
identifying vertex components within the link vertex<br>
information only if the first identifier enables a<br>
determination that the received link vertex information<br>
includes at least one vertex component.<br>
The details of one or more implementations are set forth<br>
in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other<br>
features will be apparent from the description and drawings,<br>
and from the claims.<br>

5. MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
One such use for digital broadcasts is to satisfy an<br>
existing demand for traffic information. Proposals that<br>
involve the use of digital broadcasts for this purpose<br>
contemplate the use of standardized formatting of traffic<br>
information to be broadcast. This approach may be used to<br>
enable the use of traffic information receiving terminals made<br>
6<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902	PCT7KR2006/001859<br>
by different manufacturers, which each could be configured to<br>
detect and interpret traffic information broadcast in the same<br>
way.<br>
PIG. 1 is a diagram showing an overview of a network for<br>
traffic information according to an implementation. Referring<br>
to FIG. 1, by way of example, a traffic information providing-<br>
server 110 of a broadcasting station may reconfigure various<br>
congestion traffic information aggregated from a user's input,<br>
another server over the network 101, or a probe car, and then<br>
may broadcast the reconfigured information by radio so that a<br>
traffic information receiving terminal, such as a navigation<br>
device installed to a car 200, may receive the information.<br>
The congestion traffic information broadcast by the<br>
traffic information providing server 100 via radio waves may<br>
be transmitted as a component frame. The component frame, as<br>
shown in FIG. 2A, comprises a number field of messages<br>
included in the component frame 201, and a sequence 202 of<br>
congestion information messages as many as the messages<br>
included in the number'field 202. Hereafter, the congestion<br>
information message is referred to as a Transport Protocol<br>
Expert Group (TPEG) - congestion and travel-time information<br>
(CTT) message.<br>
In various implementations, one message segment of the<br>
sequence 202, that is, the TPEG-CTT message may comprise a<br>
message management container carrying information relating to<br>
date, time, and message generation time, a CTT container, and<br>
a TPEG-CTT location container, as shown in FIGS. 2B and 2C. At<br>
the front of the CTT container, a number field of CTT<br>
components 211 may be included. The number field of CTT<br>
components 211 may belong to the CTT container and the TPEG-<br>
CTT location container. Subsequent to the number field 211,<br>
CTT components corresponding to the number may be arranged.<br>
In various implementations, if a CTT component includes<br>
7<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
traffic flow information, the CTT component has an identifier<br>
(ID) of 0x80 as shown in FIG. 2B. The CTT component may-<br>
comprise one or more status components. The status component<br>
carries information relating to a section (link) average speed<br>
(a status component including an ID of 0x00), a link travel-<br>
time (a status component including an ID of 0x01, and<br>
congestion type (a status component including an ID of 0x03).<br>
In the description, specific IDs are described.as assignments<br>
to structures associated with specific information. The actual<br>
value of an assigned ID (e.g., 80h) is exemplary, and<br>
different implementations may assign different values for<br>
specific associations or circumstances. Thus, the CTT<br>
component may be used to provide various different types of<br>
data that may be signaled based on an identifier. For example,<br>
FIG. 2B and FIG. 2C illustrate a component with an identifier<br>
of 0x80 and 0x90 signaling, respectfully, status and location<br>
information.<br>
In various implementations, if a CTT component includes<br>
link location information, the CTT component has an ID of 0x09<br>
as shown in FIG. 2C. Likewise, the CTT component may comprise. '<br>
one or more TPEG-CTT location sub-containers<br>
Tpeg_loc_container illustratively structured as shown in FIG.<br>
2D. Each TPEG-CTT location sub-container may comprise one or<br>
more TPEG-CTT location components Tpeg_loc_container. Each<br>
TPEG-CTT location component may include one or more location<br>
components including an ID of 0x00 that is illustratively<br>
structure as shown in FIG. 2E. The location component may<br>
comprise one or more coordinates components. The coordinates<br>
component may carry information relating to road link(s), that<br>
is, link(s) which may be the target of the traffic flow<br>
information included in the status component as described<br>
earlier. The link information may carry information relating<br>
to a road type such as high way and state road (a coordinates<br>
8<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
component including an ID of 0x00), coordinates information<br>
which may be expressed in WGS 84 (a coordinates component<br>
including an ID of 0x01) , link description information (a<br>
coordinate component including an ID of 0x03), and link<br>
identifying information (a coordinates component including an<br>
ID of 0x10), and the like.<br>
The information on load shape may be organized and<br>
transmitted, for example, in the form of PIG. 2F. The<br>
coordinates information may be organized and transmitted, for<br>
example, in the form of FIG. 2G. The link description<br>
information may be organized and transmitted, for example, in<br>
the form of FIG. 2H and the link identifying information may<br>
be organized and transmitted, for example, in the form of FIG.<br>
21.<br>
The server 100 may reconfigure current road congestion<br>
information, as shown in FIGS. 2A to 21, based on the current<br>
traffic information aggregated through various paths and its<br>
traffic information stored in database, and may transmit the<br>
reconfigured information to the traffic information receiving<br>
terminal by radio.<br>
In one implementation, when the traffic information about<br>
each road link is provided, the traffic information receiving<br>
terminal may search a corresponding road section (hereafter,<br>
referred to as a "section" or a "link") on its held electronic<br>
map and may represent the received traffic information using<br>
color, graphic, or text. If the traffic information receiving<br>
terminal is without an electronic map, such that it cannot<br>
represent the received traffic information on such an<br>
electronic map, it may nevertheless represent the received<br>
traffic information using graphic or text. Specifically, the<br>
graphical representation may present the road as a linear form<br>
regardless of the actual type.<br>
According to an implementation , the server 100 may<br>
9<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT7KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
aggregate and may provide the traffic information relating to,<br>
for example, a new building, a shut-down road, or route or<br>
area, or a path change of the roads (hereafter, referred to as<br>
a road change), to a traffic information receiving terminal.<br>
In addition, the information about road shape may also<br>
provided for a traffic information receiving terminal not<br>
equipped with electronic map. Thus the system is capable of<br>
informing a user when a new road is configured, and/or an<br>
existing road is reconfigured to change its shape and/or shut<br>
down, such as, for example, due to construction.<br>
In the following, an implementation of method of<br>
providing the road change or road shape information is<br>
explained in detail.<br>
To provide the road change or road shape information, the<br>
server 100 may generate a road information component 300<br>
Link_info_component configured as shown in FIG. 3A, and may<br>
load the road information component in the TPEG-CTT sub-<br>
container Tpeg_loc_container to transmit. The road information<br>
component 300 may be assigned an ID, e.g., 0x01 different from<br>
the ID 0x00 of the coordinates component.<br>
Each road information component Link_info_component, as<br>
shown in FIG. 3B, may comprise a link shape sub-component 3 01<br>
carrying shape information relating to a certain link, a link<br>
creation sub-component 3 02 carrying information relating to a<br>
new link, a link change sub-component 303 for changing the<br>
shape of the existing link, and a link elimination sub-<br>
component 304 for removing a link. It is to be understood that<br>
the road information component may.comprise other sub-<br>
components.<br>
In various implementations, the link shape sub-component<br>
301 has an ID of 0x00 and comprises an ID of the link, the<br>
number of link vertices, information relating to the vertices,<br>
and a name assigned to the link. The vertex is information<br>
10<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
consisting of a pair of latitude and longitude which may be .<br>
defined, for example, in the WGS 84 format, so that the<br>
traffic information receiving terminal may recognize the shape<br>
of the link and display the graphical representation according<br>
to the recognized shape. The link shape sub-component 301 may<br>
be provided to help the traffic information receiving terminal<br>
including no electronic map to represent a more accurate shape<br>
of the road based on the current location on the screen. Thus,<br>
the number of the vertices included in the link shape sub-<br>
component 301 may be enough to reveal the shape of the road<br>
when the road is presented according to the VGA or the QVGA on<br>
a scale lower than the precision of the electronic map<br>
supplied from a disk medium, for example, on a reduced scale<br>
of 1 to 10000.<br>
The link creation sub-component 3 02 has 0x01 as its ID<br>
and may comprise an ID of the link to be newly assigned, the<br>
number of link vertices, information relating to the vertices,<br>
and the number assigned to the link. The link creation sub-<br>
component 3 02 may be generated and provided when a road link<br>
is newly built.<br>
The link change sub-component 303 has 0x02 as its ID and<br>
may comprise an ID of the link, the number of link vertices,<br>
and information relating to the vertices. The link change sub-<br>
component 303 may be generated and provided when the shape of<br>
an existing road link is changed, for example, when the road<br>
shape is changed by linearizing the curved section. Since the<br>
link change sub-component 303 may provide information relating<br>
to the shape change of the existing road link, the same link<br>
ID as previously assigned to the link may be utilized and the<br>
sub-component 303 need not include a link name.<br>
The link elimination sub-component 3 04 has 0x03 as its ID.<br>
In FIG. 3B, although the link elimination sub-component 304<br>
may include a. length field, the length field may be omitted<br>
11<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
since the link ID has a fixed length. The link elimination<br>
sub-component 304 may comprise a link ID to be deleted, and<br>
may be generated and provided in relating to a closed link for<br>
a long term due to construction and expansion of the road.<br>
The server 100 may configure the current congestion<br>
traffic information, as shown in FIGS. 2A through 2C,<br>
according to the traffic information aggregated through<br>
various paths and its stored traffic information database and<br>
may transmit the configured congestion traffic information to<br>
the traffic information receiving terminal by radio.<br>
Additionally, according to road change information, the sub-<br>
components 301 through 304 may be generated and loaded into<br>
the road information component 300 to transmit.<br>
In various implementations, after transmitting the<br>
information relating to the road change, traffic flow<br>
information, such as average' speed, link travel-time,<br>
congestion type, and so on, relating to the new road link and<br>
the changed road link, is transmitted in the same manner as<br>
other links.<br>
In various implementations, the information on link shape<br>
provided through the aforementioned link shape sub-component<br>
3 01, may be provided for a terminal in different manner. For<br>
example, the vertex information about link shape may be<br>
carried by the aforementioned coordinates component as shown<br>
in FIG. 3C. The coordinates component 310 carrying vertex<br>
information has ID of 0x02 to distinguish from coordinates<br>
component (e.g., road-type list shown in FIG. 2C, etc.)<br>
carrying other information.<br>
Coordinates information describing road shape may be<br>
transmitted in a vertex component as shown in FIG. 3C, and<br>
each vertex component includes ID of 0x00 indicative of vertex<br>
component and sequence number (seq. no) indicative of order of<br>
vertex.<br>

FIG. 3D shows structures of the vertex component and the<br>
coordinates component carrying vertex information about link<br>
shape.<br>
In the implementation-of FIG. 3C, the coordinates<br>
component 310 carrying vertex information may not have<br>
identification information on a link to which the vertex<br>
information is applied. Instead, link identifying information<br>
may be carried by a link component included in the link<br>
identifying information component (a coordinates component<br>
whose ID is 0x10) as shown in FIG. 2C. The association there<br>
between may be made by, for example, placed order in a<br>
coordinates component. That is., a link ID carried by the first<br>
link component may be associated with the first link vertex<br>
coordinates component, and another link ID carried by the<br>
second link component may be associated with the second link<br>
vertex coordinates component.<br>
FIGS. 4-6 illustrates exemplary implementation of a<br>
system for receiving and utilizing traffic information. Other<br>
systems may be organized differently or include different<br>
components. Specifically, FIG. 4 illustrates a structure of a<br>
navigation terminal installed to a vehicle for receiving<br>
traffic information from the server 100.<br>
In FIG. 4, the navigation terminal comprises a tuner 1<br>
tuning to a signal band of the traffic information<br>
transmission and outputting a modulated signal, a demodulator<br>
2 outputting a traffic information signal by demodulating the<br>
modulated traffic information signal, a TPEG-CTT decoder 3<br>
acquiring various traffic information by decoding the<br>
demodulated traffic information signal, a global positioning<br>
system (GPS) module 8 acquiring the current location<br>
(longitude, latitude, and height) by receiving satellite<br>
signals from a plurality of low earth orbit satellites, a<br>
storage structure 4 storing various graphic information, an<br>

 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
input part 9 receiving a user's input, a navigation engine 5<br>
controlling a screen output based on the user's input, the<br>
current location, and the acquired traffic information, a<br>
memory 5a temporarily storing necessary information, a liquid<br>
crystal display (LCD) panel 7 displaying image, and an LCD<br>
drive 6 applying a driving signal according to a graphic to be<br>
displayed to the LCD panel 7. The input part 9 may be a touch,<br>
screen on the LCD panel 7. To ease the understanding, it is<br>
assumed that the storage structure 4 is or is not provided<br>
with the electronic map including information relating to<br>
links and nodes.<br>
The tuner 1 tunes the signal received at the server 100.<br>
The- modulator 2 demodulates and outputs the tuned signal<br>
according to a preset scheme. Next, the TPEG-CTT decoder 3<br>
extracts the TPEG message, as shown in PIGS. 2A through 21 and<br>
FIGS. 3A and 3B or FIGS. 3C and 3D, from the demodulated<br>
signal and temporarily stores the extracted message. The<br>
temporarily stored TPEG message is analyzed and thus necessary<br>
information and/or control data according to the message<br>
content is provided to the navigation engine 5. Although the<br>
various information and/or the control data are transferred<br>
from the TPEG-CTT decoder 3 to the navigation engine 5, for<br>
purposes of brevity, the following descriptions focuses on how<br>
to process the road shape and the road change information,<br>
though other information is involved.<br>
The TPEG-CTT decoder 3 extracts the date/time, and the<br>
message generation time in the message management container of<br>
the TPEG message and checks whether a subsequent container is<br>
a CTT event container based on the information of a 'message<br>
element'(i.e. an identifier). When the subsequent container is<br>
the CTT event container, the information acquired from the CTT<br>
container in the CTT event container is provided so that the<br>
navigation engine 5 may perform the display operation<br>
14<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
according to the traffic flow information and the road<br>
information, to be explained below. Providing the navigation<br>
engine 250 with the information may include determining,.based<br>
on identifiers, that the traffic information includes a<br>
message management container including status or vertex<br>
information within various message components within the<br>
message management container. The components may each include<br>
different status or vertex information associated with<br>
different links or locations and identifiers associated with<br>
the different status or vertex information. The containers and<br>
components may each include information associated with a<br>
generation time, version number, data length, and identifiers<br>
of included information.<br>
 Location information corresponding to current traffic<br>
flow information is acquired from the subsequent TPEG-CTT<br>
location container. This location information may include<br>
location coordinates such as longitude and latitude of a start<br>
point and an end point according to the type information of<br>
the TPEG-CTT location container, or the link, i.e., the' link<br>
ID assigned to the road link. If a storage structure 4 is<br>
equipped, a link corresponding to the received information may<br>
be specified based on the information relating to the links<br>
and the nodes stored in the storage structure 4. The<br>
navigation engine 5 may convert the location coordinates of<br>
the received link to the link ID or vice versa.<br>
In the implementation of FIG. 3B, the TPEG-CTT decoder 3<br>
checks whether the road information component including the ID<br>
of 0x01 is received in the TPEG-CTT location sub-container<br>
Tpeg_loc_container. When the road information component is<br>
present, the TPEG decoder 3 detects sub-components from the<br>
road information component and provides information included<br>
in the sub-components to the navigation engine 5. If the<br>
detected sub-components are link shape sub-components<br>
15<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
including the ID of 0x00 and the terminal in FIG. 4 stores the<br>
electronic map in the storage structure 4, the information<br>
included in the sub-components may be ignored by the<br>
navigation engine 5.<br>
In the implementation of FIG. 3C, the vertex information<br>
on link shape is extracted from the coordinates component<br>
including ID of 0x02 included in the location component<br>
including ID of 0x00, and -the extracted vertex information may<br>
be sent to the navigation engine 5 or discarded.<br>
If the storage structure 4. does not store the electronic<br>
map, the navigation engine 5 may store the information of the<br>
received link shape sub-components in the link information<br>
table, as shown in FIG. 5, of the memory 5a. In doing so, the<br>
vertex information may be separately stored in a vertex pool<br>
and a location address addr k of a start vertex of the stored<br>
vertices may be recorded to a corresponding entry of the link<br>
information table.<br>
When the electronic map is embedded in the storage<br>
structure 4, the navigation engine 5 may read out a necessary<br>
area (an area around the current location) on the electronic<br>
map based the current location coordinates received from the<br>
GPS module 8 and displays the area on the LCD panel 7 via the<br>
LCD drive 6. In doing so, the place corresponding to the<br>
current location may be marked by a specific graphic symbol.<br>
When the storage structure 4 does not have the electronic map,<br>
the navigation engine 5 may control the LCD drive 6 to display<br>
the road shape as the graphical presentation on the LCD panel<br>
7 according to the vertex information with respect to the<br>
links belonging to the area around the current location in the<br>
link information table stored in the memory 5a as show in FIG.<br>
5. The links belonging to the current area may be confirmed<br>
based on the vertex information of the links.<br>
If the detected sub-components are link creation sub-<br>
16<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
components including the ID of 0x01 or link change sub-<br>
components including the ID of 0x02, the navigation engine 5<br>
may store the information which is included in the sub-<br>
components and received from the TPEG-CTT decoder 3, in the<br>
link information table as constructed in PIG. 5, regardless of<br>
the electronic map embedded in the storage structure 4. If<br>
there is an entry including the same link ID, the information<br>
may be stored by substituting the entry.<br>
If the detected sub-components are link elimination<br>
components including the ID of 0x03, the TPEG-CTT decoder 3<br>
may request the navigation engine 5 to issue an elimination<br>
request command of the link including the ID identical to the<br>
link ID of the sub-components. When the electronic map is not<br>
provided, the navigation engine 5 may control deletion of the<br>
entry of the' corresponding link from the link information<br>
table in the memory 5a. When the. electronic map is provided,<br>
the navigation engine 5 may search an entry including the<br>
corresponding link ID in the link information table of the<br>
memory 5a. If such an entry is discovered, the entry may be<br>
deleted from the link information table of FIG. 5. If the<br>
entry is not discovered, the entry may be recorded, in a<br>
separate deleted link table in the memory 5A. The deleted link<br>
table arranges IDs of the deleted links.<br>
The navigation engine 5 controls the display of the<br>
traffic flow information received from the TPEG-CTT decoder 3,<br>
e.g., the link average speed or the link average travel-time<br>
in the displayed area according to the location coordinates of<br>
the link ID included in the coordinates component<br>
corresponding to the status component which carries the<br>
traffic flow information, within the subsequent location<br>
container. The link corresponding to the location coordinates<br>
or the link ID received in the location container may be<br>
retrieved from the memory 5a. When the storing structure 4 .<br>
17<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
stores the electronic map and the corresponding link is not<br>
discovered in the memory 5a, the retrieval in the storage<br>
structure 4 may be conducted. In case of the terminal<br>
including the electronic map, since entries of the link<br>
information table stored in the memory 5a may be first<br>
retrieved, the link including the information based on the<br>
latest road conditions may be specified earlier than the<br>
electronic map of the storage map 4.<br>
As such, the new link or the changed link and the general<br>
link may be specified. The traffic flow information as to the<br>
specified' link is acquired from the corresponding status<br>
component with the CTT component which carries the traffic<br>
information and has the ID-of 0x80 as mentioned above.<br>
The navigation engine 5 may display the traffic flow<br>
information, e.g., the average speed on the path by changing a<br>
color according to the link average speed as shown in FIGS. 6A<br>
and 6B or by indicating a number to the corresponding link as<br>
shown in FIG. 6C. For example, as for the ordinary road, the<br>
red denotes 0-10 km/h, the orange denotes 10-20 km/h, the<br>
green denotes 20-40 km/h, and the blue denotes more than 40<br>
km/h. Particularly, FIG. 6A depicts a case when the terminal<br>
of FIG. 4 .is equipped with the electronic map, FIG. 6B depicts<br>
a case when the electronic map is not provided and the LCD<br>
drive 6 and the LCD panel 7 support the graphical<br>
representation, and FIG. 6C depicts a case when the electronic<br>
map is not provided and the LCD drive 6 and the LCD panel 7<br>
support only the text representation.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6A, the new road link or the changed<br>
road link may be displayed according to the vertex information<br>
of the corresponding link stored in the link information table<br>
stored in the memory 5a. In FIG. 6B, links may be displayed on<br>
the screen according to the vertex information of the links<br>
organized in the link information table of the memory 5a. In<br>
18<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
the case in which the electronic map is provided and a link<br>
belonging to the currently displayed link is included in the<br>
deleted link table of the memory 5a, the link may not be<br>
displayed on the screen. Alternatively, as indicated by mark<br>
'A' in FIG. 6A, a specific mark indicative of the shut-down<br>
may be displayed on the displayed road and thus the traffic<br>
flow information on the blocked road may not be displayed. In<br>
FIG. 6A, the relevant link is displayed in the white rather<br>
than in the red, the orange, the green, and the blue that<br>
indicate the average speed.<br>
Meanwhile, in case that the navigation engine 5 has a<br>
path search function with respect to the destination, it is<br>
possible to automatically search or re-search a desired path<br>
based on the received link average speed or link average<br>
travel-time when the user's request is specified or the<br>
destination is designated. A terminal' without the electronic<br>
map may determine and may display the path on. the screen based<br>
on the links in the link information table registered to the<br>
memory 5a and the received traffic flow information relating<br>
to the links. Note that the received traffic flow information<br>
of the links may be stored in the memory 5a until it is<br>
updated by the next traffic flow information. A terminal with<br>
the electronic map may determine a path based on the traffic<br>
flow information relating to the links of the link information<br>
table registered in the memory 5a and the. traffic flow<br>
information relating to the link information on the electronic<br>
map of the storage structure 4. As for a link including the<br>
same link ID, the link in the link information table may be<br>
selected. Next, a determination may be made whether the links<br>
along the selected path are organized in the deleted link<br>
table of the memory 5a. When they are not in the deleted link<br>
table, the selected path may be confirmed. Otherwise, when the<br>
links along the selected path are in the deleted link table, a<br>
19<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/123902<br>
 <br>
PCT/KR2006/001859<br>
 <br>
partial path including the links may be excluded and the whole<br>
path may be determined by conducting the re-search in relation<br>
to the partial path. As a result, the determined path may be<br>
displayed on the map of the screen.<br>
If the terminal of FIG. 4 is equipped with a voice output-<br>
means, it the terminal may output the received traffic flow<br>
information relating to the links on the determined path as<br>
the voice. Also, in a case in which a blocked road, that is,<br>
the link recorded in the deleted link table appears in front<br>
of the path during the driving, a.voice such as "a ^certain<br>
road' ahead is shut down" may be output. Note that the<br>
vcertain road' may correspond to the deleted link ID and that<br>
the output voice may be a complex sound corresponding to the<br>
link name in the link information on the electronic map.<br>
The foregoing description has been presented for purposes<br>
of illustration. Thus, various implementations -with<br>
improvements, modifications, substitutions, or additions<br>
