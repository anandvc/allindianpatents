				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of sugar free bread.<br>
The bakery industry is probably largest of the processed food industries in India. It basically covers the production of bread, biscuits, buns, pastries, rusks etc. It accounts for the consumption of about 30 lakh tonnes of wheat products. Bread and biscuits account for over 85% of the bakery products produced in the country. The annual production of bread, buns and cakes in the country is estimated at around 15.2 lakh tonnes and biscuits is 15.3 lakh tonnes (Vikas Singhal, 2003, Indian Agriculture, Indian Economic Data Research Centre, Delhi, Pp 141). Bakery products can also be engineered in such a fashion that they meet the specific therapeutic needs of the consumers. Some of these products are gluten free bread, sugar free biscuits, low salt products, sugar free bread etc. These products still do not exist in Indian market (Sharma, H.K., Singh, S.T. M. and Goyal, P. 1998. Bakery products in next millenium, Beverage and Food World, Nov-Dec, Pp 40, 46). Sugar free bread is one such novel product which will cater to the needs of the diabetic patients. The therapeutic bakery products sector needs to be exploited in the country and there is good growth potential for the industries as the health awareness is on the rise.<br>
Sugar replacement has become easier because of a group of carbohydrates known as sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols are carbohydrates produced by hydrogenation of closely related sugars. The group includes sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, xylitol etc. These polyols are a unique group of carbohydrates that have a lowered glycemic response, lower calorie density, non cariogenic properties, less sweetness than sucrose, protective effects due to chemical stability and low molecular weight.<br>
Sorbitol is highly palatable with a pleasant taste and withstands temperatures prevalent in food processing. The metabolic process for sorbitol differs markedly from that for sucrose or glucose. Sorbitol is absorbed more slowly from the intestine. It is converted to fructose and metabolized by a process<br>
requiring little insulin. The blood glucose concentration is increased only slightly by the use of sorbitol. There is no increase in the urinary sugar level. Hence sorbitol can be used in food formulations for diabetics. Sorbitol used by the body as a source of energy has 2.8 calories per gram of the 70% solution. The advantages of using sorbitol are it gives up water slowly to a drier atmosphere and takes up water slowly from a humid atmosphere. Sorbitol solution is non volatile and compatible with other ingredients normally found in bakery products. It does not decompose during heating or cooking. Also it is less acceptable to bacteriological degradation than sugar. (Friedman, T. M. 1978. Sorbitol in bakery products. The Baker Digest. Dec. Pp 10-13).<br>
Reference may be made to Kim, Jong, C. US patent No. 4442132 (1984) wherein a process for the preparation of light bakery products for diabetics is given. It consisted of digestible carbohydrate content of less than 10% by weight and prepared from a dough consisting essentially of a major amount of egg in the form of whole egg or egg albumin, 2-30% by weight of a protein containing flour substitute of which atleast 50% by weight is supplied by calcium caseinate, wheat flour in an amount upto 15% by weight of the total mixture, 3-40% by weight of minced nuts, 5-50% by weight of sugar alcohol selected from the group consisting of lactitol, sorbitol and xylitol and 0% by weight of sugar and wherein the weight % of wheat flour is less than the weight % of flour substitute. The flour substitute and sugar alcohol may be formulated with the other starting materials and blended to a dough or batter in accordance with the usual baking techniques and baked at about 180°C for about 20 min. The drawback of this process is that egg, nuts and calcium caseinate do not form the ingredients for the preparation of sugar free bread.<br>
Reference may be made to Venkateswara Rao, G. Indrani, D, 1989, Journal of Food Science and Technology 26: 142-144 wherein sweet bread and biscuits were made by replacing sugar with saccharin, aspartame and acesulfame-K intended for the use of diabetic subjects. The drawback of the process is that it describes only bread and biscuits and not sugar free bread by<br>
using sorbitol alone. Also artificial sweeteners have been used which are not permitted in our country by law to be used in bakery products.<br>
Reference may be made here to Frye. A. M, C.S. Setser, 1991, Cereal Chemistry 69: 338-343 where in reduced calorie yellow layer cakes were made by using six bulking agents sorbitol, a hydrogenated starch hydrolysate mixture, lactitol, isomalt, 18 DE maltodextrin, and polydextrose in combination to totally or partially replace sucrose. The texture attributes of this reduced calorie, shortening free cakes were rated between those of a commercial pound cake and yellow layer cake. The drawback is that the process is about reduced calorie cake with different formulation and processing conditions and not the sugar free bread.<br>
A reference may be made here to Stilling and Birgitte US patent No 5698256 (1997) where in a bread product having a bread sugar reducing effect for diabetics is manufactured by baking a dough consisting of soya protein, a fibre component comprising atleast 50% by weight of wheat bran, vegetable oil, a fat containing, substantially starch-free nut and / or kernel component, a low fat sour milk product, egg white and a leavening agent. The draw back of the process is that it is a fibre rich product and it is not a sugar substituted product also soya protein and wheat bran do not form the ingredients in the formulation of sugar free bread.<br>
Reference may be made here to Bakr, A. A. 1997. Application potential for some sugar substitutes in some low energy and diabetic foods. Nahrung. 41. 170-175 where in preparation of acceptable low energy fibre enriched and diabetic jams, cakes and biscuits using different sugar substitutes like aspartame, sorbitol and xylitol with partial replacement of wheat flour using bran as a source of dietary fibre has been described. The draw back here is that the products are jam, cakes, and biscuits, and not bread.<br>
Reference may be made here to US 20040022902 where in high protein and low calorie dough for making products imitating bread type products and preparation method is disclosed. The subject of the present invention is a food preparation in the form of dough to suit shaping in particular into rolls, balls, patties, which may be provided at room temperature or deep frozen state. This preparation is characterised by a high protein content, low content of cabohydrates and lipids. The draw back here is that the cited patent concerns bakery products obtained by using said food preparation and not bread alone. Our invention relates to preparation of sugar free bread and not high protein and low calorie dough for making traditional bread - type products such as bread balls, sandwich bread slices and baguettes.<br>

10. Evaluating the bread for its physical and sensory characteristics.<br>
Experiments were conducted by preparing sugar free breads in order to find out the effect of sorbitol and improvers on the quality of sugar free bread. Bread weight was recorded, bread volume was determined using rape seed displacement. A panel of six trained judges carried out the sensory evaluation of bread samples by assigning scores for crust color, shape, symmetry, crumb color, grain, mouthfeel and taste. The overall quality score (100) was taken as the combined score of all the above attributes. Crumb firmness was measured according to AACC (2000) procedure using texture analyser (Model Tahdi, Stable Microsystems, UK) under the following conditions: sample thickness - 25 mm, load cell - 10 Kg, plunger diameter - 36 mm and plunger speed - 100 mm per minute. Crumb firmness which is a force at 25 % compression was measured.<br>
Control sugar free bread, sugar free bread using formulation 1 (with liquid sorbitol) and formulation 2 (with liquid sorbitol and improvers) were prepared and subjected to objective and sensory evaluation. The weight and volume of control sugar free bread was 134 g and 390 ml, sugar free bread prepared using formulation 1 (144 g and 470 ml) and formulation 2 (147 g and 540 ml) respectively. The specific loaf volume of control sugar free bread was 2.9 ml/g and it increased to 3.3 ml/g for sugar free bread prepared using formulation 1 and formulation 2 (3.7 ml/g).<br>
able 2. Effect of addition of liquid sorbitol and improvers on the quality of sugar free bread<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
* Force at 25 % compression measured using texturometer<br>
The control sugar free bread had a crumb firmness value of 1200 g indicating slightly hard texture. The crumb firmness values of sugar free breads prepared using formulation 1 was 700 and formulation 2 was 550. The sugar free bread prepared using formulation 2 had the lowest crumb firmness value of 550 g indicating soft texture of the bread. The above data indicated that the formulation 2 significantly improved volume, specific volume and texture of sugar free bread. Sensory evaluation of sugar free bread showed that the control sugar free bread had dull brown crust colour, creamish white crumb colour, slightly closed crumb grain and hard texture. Preparation of sugar free breads using formulations 1 and<br>
2 significantly improved the crust colour, shape, crumb grain and texture of sugar free bread and the breads possessed perceptible sweetness in them. This is indicated by the increase in sensory scores for above parameters. The overall quality score of control sugar free bread was 55 out of 100 and it increased to 76 for the sugar free bread using formulation 1 and 85 for the sugar free bread using formulation 2. Based on the above data it could be concluded that the formulation 2 (Fig 2) was found most suited for producing good quality sugar free bread with perceptible sweetness.<br>
Experiments were conducted by preparing sugar free bread with improved formulation in order to find out the composition of bread. The experimental bread was analysed for moisture, fat, ash, protein, sugars, carbohydrate (by difference) and energy.<br>
The results showed that sugar free bread with improved formulation had 34 % moisture, 5.3% fat 2.1% ash, 9.5% protein, 49% carbohydrate and 282 K cal / 100 g energy.<br><br><br><br><br>
