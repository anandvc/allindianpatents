This invention relates to a process for the preparation of drug encapsulated microspheres and the drug encapsulated microspheres produced thereby.<br>
The number of people afflicted with diabetes is increasing day be day and many reach 300 million in another 25 years. Majority of them belong to developing countries. However, treatments are by insulin inj ecti ons. Traditional medicines in India show the use of several plant derived material to reduce diabetes. Ayurvedic oral formulations are being investigated by some groups. Despite its high costs and inconvenience, some patients are preferring external insulin pumps. Many private societies in the world have devoted millions of dollars to find an alternative to the injection therapy. Injection requires a strong discipline from the patients and is linked to an important cost. Several research groups are pursui ng permanent solution by transplantation or regeneration of pancreatic islet cells. A number of companies are involved in this research.<br>
The findings may lead to a therapy that can regenerate the pancreas but it will not be available at large scale before a long time. Some ongoing developments of novel ways of delivering insulin are descri bed in the literature, like oral, nasal, ophthalmic, rectal, etc.. All these developments are either in early-stage of development or at preclinical testing stages<br>
The  delivery  of  therapeutic peptides  drugs  like  insulin  is carried out by subcutaneous injecti ons. Even though this  ensures<br><br>
high percentage of bioavailability, a few unfavourable but crucia J factors still remain unsolved. The presence of very high and very 1ow amount of the drug in the vascular system is one among them. Inconvenience i n application, pain, requi rement of assistance of a second person for administration, appliances required for delivery, cost, etc. are other disadvantages. Hence, efforts are on for seeking possibilities of alternative routes and methods of administration. Prominent among them are aimed at the various other routes of administration connected with diffe-rent absorption sites present in the human body vis. nasal, enteral, ocular, rectal, bucca1 and so on. Of these, oral route has its merits since it is the norma 1 phys iological route, and also due to the convenience in controlling the dose, and ease of adm i n istr t i on.<br>
A  number  of factors limit the scope of oral  administration  of peptide  drugs.  Enzymatic  degradation of the  peptides  in  the gastro  intestinal  tract, pH in the gastric  region,  solubility limitations  of drugs, hydrophilic nature of the  peptides,  etc. are  a few among them. Agai n, maintenance of therapeutic level the concentration required to execute a therapeutic effect - a 1 so i s a necess i ty.<br>
Many drugs have been incorporated into biocompatib 2 e matr ices and their in vitro release in both gastric and intestinal pH has been estabiished. Matrices which are pH sensitive so that they remain intact in the hostile gastric region and release the drug in the favourable intestinal region have ako heen exolored.<br><br>
it is easy for lipophilic molecules to get into the vascular system through the cell walls. The hydrophi 1ic nature of many drugs limit their biological absorption. Hence, attempts have been made to entrap peptide mo 1 ecu 1es i nto 1iposomes or othe absorption enhancers for the easier absorption of the molecules into the circulatory system.<br>
It  is therefore an object of this invention to propose  an  oral drug  delivery system which is capable of  encapsu1 ati ng  pepti de drugs  which on administration releases the drug into the  gastro intestinal tract, retaining its therapeutic effect.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose an oral drug delivery system which del'vers the drug in a controlled manner.<br>
It  is  yet another object of this invention to propose  an  oral drug  delivery  system  for  the  encapsulation  of   uncomplexed insulin, like peptides.<br>
Thus,  accord ing to this invention is provided a process for  the<br>
preparation  of drug encapsu1 ated microspheres comprising<br>
mixing the drug with an absorption enhancer to form the complexed<br>
dru# foil owed by mixing said complexed drug with a biopolymer gel<br>
to form a gel mixture,<br>
subjecting  said  gel  mixture to extrusion  into  a  crosslinker<br>
solution to obtain the microspheres containing the drug, al1 owing<br>
the microspheres to harden,<br>
followed by filtering and drying to provide the drug encapsulated<br>
microspheres.<br><br>
I n  accordance with this invention, a solution of about 0.5 to  5<br>
gms.  of a salt of a copolymer of mannuronic acid  and  guluronic<br>
acid  (alginate)  is  prepared in   a  100ml  salt  solution.  This<br>
solution   which  forms  the  anionic  biopolymer  gel    contains<br>
mannuronic  acid and guluronic acid in a proportion of  30 :40  to<br>
50:60,  preferably  39:61.   1 to 10ml of  the  drug  of  suitable<br>
strength  is added to 5 to 250gms of    the absorption enhancer  and<br>
mixed well and allowed to react for about 1-3 hrs.» preferably  2<br>
hrs.   to obtain the drug compiexed absorption enhancer. The  drug<br>
complexed absorption enhancer is mixed with the alginate solution<br>
and  extruded  through a hypodermic needle of  suitable  diameter<br>
into  a    crosslinking  medium.  The  crosslinker  solution   or<br>
crosslinking medium referred to hereinabove consists of about 0.2<br>
to  5%  by weight of   calcium chloride. A combination  of  calcium<br>
chloride  and  about 0.1-3% by weight of  chitosan  dissolved  in<br>
dilute  hydrochloric acid or acetic acid is another  choice.  The<br>
microspheres  thus formed are all owed to harden for  about  10-90<br>
mins.,  the  hardened microspheres are separated and dried  at  a<br>
o temperature in the range of 3-15 C.<br>
The  drug used for the purpose in general are  peptide  drugs such as insulin are used in particular, either in their solid  or solution  state.  In a preferred embodiment, 40-100 IU of  insulin is used as the drug for forming the complex.<br>
Various molecules are used for the encapsulation of drugs. Such molecu Ies are chi tosan, alginic acid and its salts, polylysine, polyv iny1  alcohol,  hydroxyapatite,  etc.  of  which   alginate,<br><br>
chitosan, etc are generally used since they are proven natural polymers. The alginate salt may be a sodium or potassium salt and the salt solution is likewise selected from sodi um chloride or potassium chloride solution. Apart from using the polymeric mo 1 ecu 1es, such as alginate and its salts alone, they have also been used in combination for specific drug release patterns. Such a system is poly anionic alginate and poly cationic chitosan in combination. It optimises the release of the drug to have a more uniform release pattern. Other mo 1 ecules like eye 1odex tr i ns have also been applied as absorption enhancers. All three forms of cyclodextrin such as alpha, beta and gamma cyclodextrin and their derivatives have  been  used.<br>

About 0.25-5 gms. of a sodium or potassium salt of alginic acid is dissolved in 50-100ml water or a 0.5-1.5% solution of sodium chloride in water to obtain the alginate solution. About 5-10ml of the drug, preferably 40 IU insulin is taken separately and to it is added 5-50mg of an absorption enhancer and the mixture is allowed to react for 1-3 hrs.. This solution is added to the alginate solution mentioned above and mixed gently to obtain the drug containing alginate.<br>
In a separate vessel, 250-1000m1 of a vegetable oil is stirred at<br>
a  speed  of  500-2000  rpm for 10-60  roins.,  depending  on  the<br>
required size of the microspheres. The drug-cyc1odextrin-a1ginate<br>
mixture is added to it and stirring is conti nued for another  20 -<br>
45  mins.. A super saturated solution of calcium chloride in  the<br>
same vegetable oil is added to it and stirring is again continued<br>
for  another 15-25 mins.. The microspheres formed are  separated,<br>
washed with a suitable solvent like petroleum ether and dried  at<br><br>
Still further according to this invention is provided a process for the preparation of drug encapsu1 ated microspheres compr is i ng preparing a biopolymer gel and adding said gel to an emulsifying medium with stirring followed by<br>

EXPERIMENTS<br>
1. In vitro release of the drug in simulated gastric medium (SGM) The in vitro release of the drug was performed in simulated gastric medium (without enzymes) as per the US pharmacopoea at 1.2 pH. A weighed amount of the microspheres were added to a measured quantity of the buffer SGM. 0.5ml of sampe is withdrawn f rom it after 30 mins., 60 mins., 2 hrs., 3 hrs. and 4 hrs.. The drug concentration is estimated using Lowry's method. The drug release in simulated gastric med ium i s shown in Fig.l of the accompany ing drawings.<br>
2. In vitro release of the drug in s imulated intestinal med ium The in vitro release of the drug in SIM was done as per the US pharma copea (without enzymes). A weighed quantity of the (0.2gm) microspheres was introduced into measured quantity of SIM (pH 7.4). Exactly 0.5ml of the sample was withdrawn at the end of 30 mins., 60 mins,, 1 hr., 2 hrs., 3 hrs. and 5 hrs.. The drug concentration was estimated using Lowry's method. Drug re]ease in<br><br>
simulated  intestinal  medium is shown in Fig.2  of  the  acccom-panying drawings.<br>
3.	Pay 1oad<br>
The  total  amount of drug encapsulated per gram  of  the  microspheres were estimated to be 20-30 IU per gram of microspheres.<br>
4.	The therapeutic effect of the microsphere<br>
The  therapeut ic effect of the microspheres was tested in  albino rats.  Diabetes  was  induced  on  the  animals  by  subcutaneous administration of 150mg alloxan per kg. weight of the animal. The blood  glucose level of the animals were monitored using  glucose k i ts.  The animaIs were maintained in the normal state by  intraperitoneal  injection  of long acting bovine  insulin  for  about. seven  days.  Afterwards, drug administration was  withdrawn  and g1ucose  1evel was a 1 1 owed to mount upto 400 mg/dl and above.   In two  animals, microspheres equivalent to 2 units of  insulin  was administered  through special equipments meant, for it. The  third one was maintained as a control. The glucose level was  monitored at the end of 1,2,3,6,9 and 24 hrs. using glucose kits. A  second dose of 2.0 IU was given at the end of the third hour and a third dose of 2 IU at the end   of the ninth hour (Table I J.<br><br><br>
Results<br>
The in vitro release studies suggests that there is less than 0.09 IU per ml release of the drug in 3 hrs. in the acidic pH of the gastric region. The release in the simulated intestinal medium is about 0.2 IU per ml. The total amount of the drug that could be loaded in one gram of the microspheres is about 20-30 1U. The g 3 ucose level of diabetic i nduced animaIs has come down from the third hour onwards to a hypoglycemic state thus ascertaining that this system is capable of reducing g1ucose level in diabetic rats.<br><br><br>
