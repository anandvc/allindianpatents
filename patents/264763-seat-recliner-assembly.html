DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention can be more fully understood by reading the following detailed description of some of the embodiments, with reference made to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an exploded view of the assembly according to an embodiment of the present invention. Pivotable plate 1 as shown in the assembly is an embossed pivotable plate placed on one side of the assembly and attached to the back frame of the seat structure with the help of rivets 8. A first circular hole 12 is provided on the pivotable plate 1 which helps for angular movement in forward and rearward direction. A first circular section 10 of the pivotable plate has V- shaped teeth on its internal circumference. On the other side of the assembly, there is an embossed guide plate 2 fixed to the lower frame of the seat. The guide plate 2 is matable with the pivotable plate 1 when all the parts are fitted together. The guide plate 2 comprises a second circular section 14 which has four guides 16. A second circular hole 18 is provided at the center of the second circular portion with a hook 20 surrounding the hole 18. The seat recliner assembly comprises of four pawls 3, each having four side surfaces, with V- shaped teeth on the external diameter of one side surface. The pawls 3 slide into the guides of the guide plate 2 and the V-shaped teeth engage with the first circular section 10 when the seat is in a locked position. The pawls 3 being four in number help to reduce the size of the assembly. Under conditions of impact all four pawls 3 share the entire load of the said assembly.<br>
Cam 4 having four lobes 34 is positioned between the pivotable plate 1 and the guide plate 2 and is in contact with the pawls 3 at four locations. The profile of Cam 4 is designed in such a manner that a suitable locking angle is maintained. Under any severe condition of impact, the contact of Pawls 3 with the Cam 4 plays a key role to keep seat structure intact and ultimately the occupant safe. As can be seen in figure 1, each of the four lobes of the Cam 4 is provided with a circular hole and each lobe is provided to be in contact with the fourth side surface of the pawls 3. Further, a shaft 5 having two steps is provided which provides a central axis to the assembly and passes through the holes of the guide plate 2 and said pivotable plate 1. The smaller diameter end of the shaft 5 passes freely through the centre of a guide plate 2. On the first step<br><br>
28 i.e. on a smaller diameter of the shaft 5, the cam 4 is press fitted and on the second step 30 i.e. on the bigger diameter of the shaft 5, a retractor plate 6 is mounted.<br>
The retractor plate 6 mounted on the second step 30 of the shaft 5 is placed between the pivotable plate 1 and Cam 4. A nominal torque applied to the shaft 5 first overcomes the pretension of the spring 7 and then allows the retractor plate 6 to rotate. During this rotation, the retractor plate 6 pushes the Pawls 3 downwards. These Pawls 3 are guided smoothly along the guides 16 formed in the Guide plate 2 and get disengaged. Once the seat recliner assembly gets disengaged, the driver/passenger can push the back forward or rearward to get desired position. After a comfortable position is achieved, the assembly gets locked in the desired position by releasing the torque applied to the shaft 5.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates depicts a perspective view of another embodiment of the assembly in a locked state and the cross sectional view of the assembly. As shown, the internal placement of various components of the assembly can be clearly seen in the figure. The cross sectional view taken along lines A-A of the assembly shows the interlocking of various components of the assembly.<br>
Figure 3 shows the pivotable plate 1 which is an embossed plate with internal teeth. These teeth are V shaped and when engaged with Pawls 3, they act as a lock to disallow movement of the pivotable plate 1. This pivotable plate 1 is attached to the back frame of the seat with the help of rivets 8 through holes 11. The circular hole 12 provided on the pivotable plate 1 helps for angular movement in forward and rearward direction. When the Pivotable Plate 1 is in unlocked position, the assembly gets unlocked and the seat back is adjusted by the occupant to suit to his/her posture for comfort. Smooth movement of the recliner with fine increments is achieved using suitable tolerances on components. The cross sectional view taken along lines A-A is also shown in the figure. The pivotable plate 1 is also provided with a center hole 12 through which the shaft passes.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the Guide plate 2 is attached to the frame of the cushion lower structure of the seat with the help of rivets 8 through holes 15. Guide plate 2 being fixed to the lower frame of the seat structure does not have any rotary movement. The Guide plate 2 has four guides 16 produced by the forming process. The height and width dimensions are very important to properly transfer the load to the guide plate 2<br><br>
and ultimately to the vehicle base. The tolerances on dimensions are closely maintained in order to achieve smooth guide of pawls 3. The straightness of the guides 16 is maintained to achieve perfect locking of pawls 3 with pivotable plate 1. The guides 16 of guide plate 2 are designed in such a manner that during impact, full load is taken by guide plate 2. The cross sectional view taken along lines X-X is also shown in the figure. The guide plate 2 is also provided with a second circular hole 18 through which the shaft 5 passes. A first hook 20 on which the spring is hooked surrounds the hole 18.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, Pawls 3 have two guided side surfaces 22 and V-shaped teeth formed on the outer diameter of the third side surface 24. The fourth side surface 26 is opposite to the third side surface 24 and it has a tapered end 27. In the locking condition, four Pawls 3 and pivotable plate 1 get engaged with each other. The pawls 3, being four in number help to reduce the size of recliner assembly. Under conditions of impact, all the four pawls 3 share load and the full load has to get transferred to the guides of guide plate 2 through these pawls 3. The lower edge of each pawl 3 acts as a follower and is given a specific profile. When the cam 4 rides over the profile, the pawls 3 slide in the guides 16 made in the guide plate 2. At a certain angle of the movement of the cam 4, the pawls 3 get locked with pivotable plate 1 and in turn, lock the complete assembly. The recliner assembly gets released as soon as the Cam 4 is released with the help of a spring 7 when torque is applied. Each pawl 3 is further provided with a projection 25. The cross sectional view taken along lines X-X is also shown in the figure.<br>
Figure 6 shows Cam 4 with four lobes 34 used for engaging and disengaging with Pawls 3. The specific profile of Cam 4 pushes the pawls 3 upwards and downwards in the guide plate 2 to engage and disengage with pivotable plate 1 so that the seat back position can be adjusted when the pawls 3 disengage from the pivotable plate 1. A suitable friction angle is maintained between lobe of the cam 4 and the fourth side of the pawl 3 to achieve locking condition. With the help of this spring 7, Cam 4 can be released from its locking condition when torque is applied to the shaft. Each lobe is provided with a circular hole 35. The cross sectional view taken along lines A-A is also shown in the figure.<br><br>
back. When the user releases the lever, the cam 4 and retractor plate 6 rotate back to their original position to again achieve the engagement of the pawls 3 with the pivotable plate 1 thereby locking the assembly and printing any movement of the seat.<br>
In another embodiment, a seat is provided with a pair of seat recliner assemblies which are secured to both sides of the seat and joined by a torsion rod. In such embodiment, when torque is applied to the shaft, the same passes through the torsion rod to the shaft of the second assembly on the other side of the seat, thereby making both engage and disengage at the same time to allow or prevent seat movement.<br>
Figure 11 shows different positions in which the seat can be adjusted by the assembly in the seat structure. Position A of the seat is considered as the desired position by the driver/passenger. In this position, the Pivotable plate 1  is fixed to the seat back structure and is in the locked condition. The spring 7 is given pretension so that it can hold Pawls 3 which are in contact with the pivotable plate 1. The Cam 4 locks the Pawls 3 with a desired pressure angle. Thus the seat back structure gets locked and does not move from the desired position A. The shaft 5 is integrated with the Cam 4 around the centre axis of the seat recliner assembly. To move the seat structure forward to position B, an optimum torque is applied to the shaft 5.    By applying nominal torque to the shaft 5, the Cam 4 also rotates till it is relieved from holding the Pawls 3. At the same time, the spring 7 gets activated and the Pawls 3 are free to slide along the guide in the Guide plate 2.<br>
In case, the pawls 3 are not pulled down appropriately, the retractor plate 6 helps the Pawls 3 to slide down till they get fully disengaged from the pivotable plate 1. Once Pawls 3 are disengaged from the Pivotable plate, a driver/passenger can move the seat back to position B in forward direction. In a similar way, the seat can be brought to position C in rearward direction. These are minimum angle and maximum angle positions of the seat and in between, the seat positions are adjusted in a similar fashion.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates just release position when pawls are about to drop due to its own weight.<br><br>
Figure 13 illustrates just release position when pawls do not drop due to its own weight.<br>
Figure 14 illustrates release position when pawls are pulled down by retractor plate.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates release position when pawls are fully dropped due to its own weight.<br>
Figure 16 illustrates release position when pawls are fully pulled by retractor plate.<br><br>
