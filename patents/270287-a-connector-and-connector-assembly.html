				<td>A Connector And Connector Assembly<br>
The present invention relates to a connector and to a connector assembly.<br>
A connector is known e.g. from Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2001-332332. This connector is provided with a connector housing formed with cavities into which terminal fittings are insertable. A locking portion for resiliency locking and retaining the terminal fitting is formed in each cavity. Further, a retainer accommodating hole making an opening in an outer surface of the connector housing is formed in wall surfaces of the cavities opposite to those where the locking portions are formed. A retainer can be accommodated into this retainer accommodating hole. With the retainer accommodated in the retainer accommodating hole, the terminal fittings are doubly locked by the locking portions and the retainer. This retainer is integrally formed with the connector housing via a hinge at the opening edge of the retainer accommodating hole, and is swingable with the hinge as a supporting point. Thus, the number of parts can be reduced as compared to the case where the retainer is separately formed. In this connector, the retainer is accommodated into the retainer accommodating hole in the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portions.<br>
In a connector of this kind, there are cases where cavities are arranged, for example, in the resiliency deforming direction of locking portions. If a retainer swingable via a hinge as described above is applied to the connector<br><br>
having this construction, the retainer is accommodated into a retainer accommodating hole in the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portions, i.e. in the arranged direction of the cavities.<br>
However, since the retainer having the hinge is accommodated into the retainer accommodating hole by being swung with the hinge as a supporting point, the retainer has a substantially fan-shape whose radius is equal to a distance between the opening edge of the retainer accommodating hole at a side where the hinge is formed and the opening edge at a side opposite to the hinge-formed side when viewed in a direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portions (direction intersecting with the arranged direction of the cavities) in order to prevent an end portion of the retainer from getting caught by the opening edge of the retainer accommodating hole.<br>
Thus, with the retainer accommodated in the retainer accommodating hole, the positions of the retainer in the respective cavities gradually change at each stage of the cavities according to the substantially fan-shape of the retainer. As a result, engaging portions of the terminal fittings with the retainer have to be formed at different positions depending on at which stage the terminal fittings are arranged. This is not practical.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above problem and an object thereof is to provide a connector and corresponding connector assembly having an improved construction in which cavities are arranged in the resiliency deforming direction of locking portions.<br><br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subejct of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a connector, comprising a connector housing formed with a plurality of cavities into which terminal fittings are at least partly insertable and in which locking portions resiliency engageable with the terminal fittings are formed, wherein:<br>
the cavities are arranged substantially in the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portions,<br>
a retainer accommodating hole having such a depth as to communicate with the respective cavities is formed in a side surface of the connector housing located in a direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portion,<br>
a retainer can be at least partly accommodated into the retainer accommodating hole and includes locking protrusions engageable with the terminal fittings with the retainer at least partly accommodated in the retainer accommodating hole.<br>
Accordingly, the retainer may be at least partly inserted into the retainer accommodating hole formed in the side surface of the connector housing facing in the direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portions. Thus, the retainer is mounted into the connector housing in the direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portions. Since the respective cavities are arranged in the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portions, the locking protrusions of the retainer are arranged substantially at the substantially same positions in the cavities at the<br><br>
respective stages with the retainer at least partly accommodated in the retainer accommodating hole when viewed in the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portions (arranged direction of the cavities). As a result, positions of the terminal fittings engaged with the retainer can be substantially aligned for the respective terminal fittings accommodated in the cavities at the respective stages.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the retainer is integrally or unitarily formed with the connector housing via at least one hinge at the opening edge of the retainer accommodating hole.<br>
Thus, the connector housing having a unitarily or integrally formed retainer via at least one hinge can be provided at lower costs while maintaining the overall operability is provided.<br>
Preferably, each terminal fitting has a tubular portion in which an engageable portion engageable with the locking protrusion of the retainer is provided, and each locking protrusion of the retainer is engaged with the engageable portion in the direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portion.<br>
Accordingly, the terminal fittings are preferably doubly locked by the retainer in the resiliency deforming direction of locking portions. Thus, displacements of the terminal fittings substantially along the resiliency deforming direction of locking portions are prevented by the locking portions and those of the terminal fittings along the direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction of the locking portions are prevented by the retainer. Since displacements in two different directions can be prevented in this way, the postures of the terminal fittings can be stabilized.<br><br>
Further preferably, an inclined surface that is brought or bringable substantially into sliding contact with the terminal fitting to be pushed, thereby pushing the retainer substantially out of the cavity, when the terminal fitting is inserted into the cavity with the retainer at least partly accommodated in the retainer accommodating hole is formed on an inner side surface of the retainer.<br>
If an attempt is made to insert the terminal fitting into the cavity with the retainer inadvertently accommodated in the retainer accommodating hole before all the terminal fittings are inserted into the cavities, the terminal fitting comes into contact with the retainer. At this time, the terminal fitting may be damaged if being forcibly pushed into the cavity in the case where the retainer is, for example, constructed not to be displaced even if being pushed by the terminal fitting.<br>
In view of the above, if the terminal fitting is inserted into the cavity with the retainer accommodated in the retainer accommodating hole, the terminal fitting comes into sliding contact with the inclined surface to push it, whereby the retainer can be moved out of the cavity. Since a force exerted to insert the terminal fitting can escape in this way, the damage of the terminal fitting can be prevented.<br>
Still further preferably, a frame formed with a plurality of accommodating chambers into which the connector is at least partly insertable is connected with a mating connector with the connector at least partly accommodated in the frame.<br>
Further preferably, one or more busbars having one or more tab portions are arranged preferably in the thickness direction of the busbars in the mating connector<br><br>
the accommodating chambers of the frame are arranged in a direction intersecting with the thickness direction of the busbars with the frame and the mating connector properly connected.<br>
Still further preferably, one or more resilient contact pieces capable of resiliency touching one or more tab portions of the one or more busbars are formed in the tubular portions of the terminal fittings to be at least partly accommodated in the connector, and<br>
the resilient contact pieces touch plate surfaces of the tab portions, which preferably are formed by being cut at the opposite sides thereof, facing each other in the thickness direction of the tab portions.<br>
Most preferably, a frame formed with a plurality of accommodating chambers into which the connector is insertable is connected with a mating connected with the connector accommodated in the frame,<br>
a plurality of busbars having tab portions are arranged in the thickness direction of the busbars in the mating connector,<br>
the accommodating chambers of the frame are arranged in a direction intersecting with the thickness direction of the busbars with the frame and the mating connector properly connected,<br>
resilient contact pieces capable of resiliency touching the tab portions are formed in the tubular portions of the terminal fittings to be accommodated in the connector, and<br>
the resilient contact pieces touch plate surfaces of the tab portions, which are formed by being cut at the opposite sides thereof, facing each other in the thickness direction of the tab portions.<br><br>
Accordingly, specified (predetermined or predeterminable) ones of the terminal fittings arranged in the connector accommodated in the frame can be shorted with each other by the busbars.<br>
The tab portions are formed by being cut at the opposite ends thereof, and the cut surfaces are not necessarily smooth because a large force was applied for the cutting operation. Thus, the connection stability of the tab portions and the resilient contact pieces may be reduced if the above cut surfaces are brought into contact with the resilient contact pieces.<br>
In view of the above, the plate surfaces of the tab portions facing in the thickness direction of the tab portions are brought into contact with the resilient contact pieces. This can make electrical connection between the tab portions and the resilient contact pieces more secure.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention, an interacting portion projecting outward in the resiliently deforming direction of the locking portion and engageable with a housing locking portion formed at the frame is formed at or near the front end of a side surface of the connector with respect to an inserting direction of the connector into the accommodating chamber, the side surface facing in the resiliently deforming direction of the locking portions.<br>
Preferably, at least one finger placing portion is formed at a position deviated from the interacting portion in a direction intersecting with the inserting direction of the connector into the accommodating chamber at or near the rear end of the side surface of the connector where the interacting portion is formed with respect to the inserting direction of the connector into the accommodating chamber, and/or<br><br>
the finger placing portion is located at a position behind a partition wall at least partly partitioning the accommodating chambers with respect to the inserting direction of the connector into the accommodating chamber with the connector properly inserted in the accommodating chamber.<br>
Accordingly, the connector includes the finger placing portion. Since this enables an operator to separate the connector from the frame by holding the finger placing portion by the fingers, the efficiency of the connector separating operation can be improved.<br>
Since the finger placing portion is deviated from the interacting portion engageable with the housing locking portion of the frame in the direction intersecting with the inserting direction of the connector into the accommodating chamber, a mold can be removed backward with respect to the inserting direction of the connector upon forming the interacting portion. This makes it unnecessary to use a sliding mold upon forming the connector, wherefore production cost can be reduced.<br>
Since the aforementioned finger placing portion is deviated from the interacting portion in the direction intersecting with the inserting direction of the connector into the accommodating chamber, the connector is supposedly enlarged in the direction intersecting with the inserting direction of the connector into the accommodating chamber. In view of this, according to the above preferred embodiment, the finger placing portion is located at the position behind the partition wall partitioning the accommodating chambers with respect to the inserting direction of the connector into the accommodating chamber with the connector inserted in the accommodating chamber. An area behind the partition wall with respect to the inserting direction of the connector<br><br>
into the accommodating chamber has been conventionally a dead space. Since the finger placing portion is arranged in this area, the enlargement of the entire connector including the frame in the direction intersecting with the inserting direction of the connector into the accommodating chamber can be prevented with the connector accommodated in the frame.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a connector assembly comprising a connector according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof and a mating connector connectable therewith, wherein at least one lock portion provided at a side wall of the mating connector housing located at an outer side in a properly connected state of the connector housings and resiliency deformable substantially outward in the thickness direction of the side wall, and at least one interlocking portion formed at the connector housing and engageable with the lock portion to inseparably hold the two connector housings.<br>

jig-One preferred embodiment in which an inventive connector is applied to<br>
a divided connector is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 30. This divided connector is provided with a male housing (corresponding to a preferred mating connector) 12 accommodating one or more busbars 11 having one or more tab portions 10, and a female frame 15 into which one or more, preferably a plurality of auxiliary connectors (corresponding to a preferred connector) 14 at<br><br>
least partly accommodating one or more female terminal fittings 13 are at least partly insertable. The male housing 12 is to be mounted on an unillustrated fixed body via a bracket 16 to be provided on or projection from this fixed body. In the following description, connecting directions CD of the male housing 12 and the female frame 15 are referred to as forward directions and reference is made to FIG. 1 concerning vertical direction. (Male Housing)<br>
The male housing 12 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin and includes a receptacle 46 having a substantially open front side and a busbar holding portion 47 provided behind or adjacent to the receptacle 46 as shown in FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 16, one or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. four in the shown example) busbar holding grooves 48 for holding the one or more busbars 11 are formed (preferably one substantially above another) in a wall surface (back surface of the receptacle 46) of the busbar holding portion 47 substantially exposed to the receptacle 46 and extend substantially in width direction WD (transverse direction in FIG. 16).<br>
As shown in FIG. 21, each busbar 11 preferably is formed by punching or cutting or stamping a conductive (preferably metallic) plate material out into a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) shape and includes one or more, preferably a plurality of tab portions 10, at least one coupling portion 49 coupling these tab portions 10, and one or more fixing portions 50 projecting from a side of the coupling portion 49 preferably substantially opposite or corresponding to the tab portions 10. The tab portions 10 preferably are formed by being cut at the opposite sides.<br><br>
Each busbar 11 is to be held in or at the corresponding busbar holding groove 48 by having the coupling portion 49 at least partly accommodated in the busbar holding groove 48 and having the one or more fixing portions 50 pressed into one or more fixing holes 51 formed in the busbar holding groove 48. With the busbar 11 fixed in the busbar holding groove 48, the tab portions 10 at least partly project into the receptacle 46. With the busbars 11 fixed in the busbar holding grooves 48, the respective busbars 11 are arranged in the thickness direction thereof.<br>
As shown in FIG. 18, the lateral (left and/or right) end(s) (upper and/or lower ends in FIG. 18) of the front edge (right end portion in FIG. 18) of the ceiling wall of the receptacle 46 are recessed backward (leftward in FIG. 18) to form one or more notches 52. With the female frame 15 substantially properly fitted in the receptacle 46, one or more frame side finger placing portions 17A formed on the ceiling wall of the female frame 15 to be described later are at least partly accommodated in these notches 52. A dimension of the notches 52 substantially in forward and backward directions FBD preferably is set to be substantially equal to the thickness of the frame side finger placing portions 17A (see FIG. 2). As shown in FIG. 2, one or more finger placing slants 53A sloped up or outward toward the back are formed in the outer surface of the lateral (ceiling) wall of the receptacle 46 to substantially extend from the notches 52. With the male housing 12 and the female frame 15 properly connected, the outer or upper ends of the finger placing portions 17A project from the front edges of the finger placing slants 53A, thereby making it easier for an operator to place his fingers on the finger placing portions 17A.<br><br>
Further, the front edge of the lateral (bottom) wall of the receptacle 46 in FIG. 16 is recessed backward (leftward in FIG. 18) in an intermediate position (preferably substantially in the transverse center in FIG. 16) to form at least one notch 52. A dimension of this notch 52 substantially in forward and backward directions FBD preferably is set to be substantially equal to the thickness of a frame side finger placing portion 17B formed on the bottom wall of the female frame 15 to be described later. As shown in FIG. 3, a finger placing slant 53B sloped outward or down toward the back is formed in the outer surface of the lateral (bottom) wall of the receptacle 46 preferably to extend from this notch 52. With the male housing 12 and the female frame 15 properly connected, the bottom end of the frame side finger placing portion 17B projects from the front edge of the finger placing slant 53B, thereby making it easier for the operator to place his finger on the frame side finger placing portion 17B.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the rear end surface of the female frame 15 and the front end surface of the male housing 12 preferably are set to be substantially flush with each other with the female frame 15 and the male housing 12 properly connected. Further, as shown in FIG. 4, the outer or upper ends of the frame side finger placing portions 17A of the female frame 15 and/or the outer or bottom end of the frame side finger placing portion 17B preferably are set to be respectively substantially flush with the respective lateral (upper and/or bottom) surface(s) of the male housing 12 with the female frame 15 and the male housing 12 substantially properly connected.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 21 and 22, one or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. six in this embodiment) partial connection or first detecting ribs 54 project inwardly or down from the inner surface of the lateral (ceiling) wall of the<br><br>
receptacle 46 and extend substantially forward from the rear end of this ceiling wall (or a position close thereto) towards or to a position retracted slightly backward from the front edge of the ceiling wall. The front ends of the partial connection detecting ribs 54 are formed to have a downward or inward inclination toward the front, thereby having a pointed or converging configuration. As shown in FIG. 23, a housing locking portion 30 of the female frame 15 remains resiliency deformed upward or outward without being resiliency restored if the auxiliary connector 14 is left insufficiently fitted into the female frame 15. If an attempt is made to fit the female frame 15 into the male housing 12 in this state, the front edge of the housing locking portion 30 comes substantially into contact with (preferably the front edge of) the partial connection detecting rib 54 formed to project downward or inward from the ceiling wall of the receptacle 46 from front, thereby hindering any further insertion of the auxiliary connector 14. In this way, the partial connection or insufficient connection of the auxiliary connector 14 can be detected. Further, the ceiling wall of the receptacle 46 can be reinforced by these partial connection detecting ribs 54.<br>
The front edge of a lateral (left) wall 58 of the receptacle 46 in FIG. 16 is formed to bulge out slightly forward (rightward in FIG. 19) as shown in FIG. 19 and preferably serves as a bracket guiding portion 56 for guiding the bracket 16 to guide rails 55 to be described later.<br>
One or more forcible collision preventing ribs 23 extending substantially in forward and backward directions FBD are formed in intermediate positions (preferably substantially in the vertical centers) of the inner surfaces of lateral (right and/or left) wall(s) 57, 58 of the receptacle 46 in FIG. 16. These forcible<br><br>
collision preventing ribs 23 are at least partly fitted into guiding grooves 22 formed in the female frame 15, thereby preventing the female frame 15 from entering the receptacle 46 in an improper orientation (such as in a vertically inclined state) to bring the front end of the female frame 15 into contact with the tab portions 10, and the front edges of the forcible collision preventing ribs 23 are so inclined as to be easily fittable into the guiding grooves 22. Out of these forcible collision preventing ribs 23, the one formed on the lateral (right) wall 57 in FIG. 16 extends substantially backward from the front edge of the right wall 57, i.e. from a connecting surface with the female frame 15, whereas the one formed on the substantially opposite lateral (left) wall 58 extends substantially backward from a position slightly retracted backward (rightward in FIG. 22) from the front edge of the lateral (left) wall 58 and/or preferably is substantially aligned with the front end position of the forcible collision preventing rib 23 of the right wall 57 as shown in FIG. 22. This can prevent the female frame 15 from being fitted into the receptacle 46 in an improper orientation, e.g. in such an inclined posture with respect to width direction that either one of the lateral (left and right) sides of the front end of the female frame 15 precedes the other, thereby preventing the front end of the female frame 15 from coming into contact with the tab portions 10.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 19 and 20, one or more, preferably two slits 59 are formed in an intermediate position (preferably substantially in the vertical center) of the outer surface of (preferably each of) the lateral (right and/or left) wall(s) 57, 58 of the receptacle 46 preferably while being vertically spaced apart by a specified (predetermined or predeterminable) distance. These slits extend substantially forward from the rear edge of each of the right and left walls 57,<br><br>
58 up to an intermediate position (preferably a substantial center position) with respect to forward and backward directions FED. Preferably, an area between the two upper and lower slits 59 is resiliency deformable outward in the thickness direction of each of the lateral (right and left) walls 57, 58 and serves as a lock portion 19 engageable with the corresponding interlocking portion 18 of the female frame 15 to retain the female frame 15. The lock portion 19 formed in the lateral (right) wall 57 extends backward (rightward in FIG. 20) from a base end 60 toward a free end 61. Further, the lock portion 19 formed in the substantially opposite lateral (left) wall 58 extends backward (leftward in FIG. 19) from a base end 60 toward a free end 61 along an inserting direction BID of the bracket 16 to be described later into a clearance defined between the guide rails 55. One or more spaces outside the lock portion(s) 19 in the thickness direction of the lateral (right and/or left) wall(s) 57, 58 (space above the lock portion 19 in FIG. 5) serve as one or more deformation areas 62 for the one or more lock portions 19. A lock projection 63 is formed to project inward from the inner surface of each lock portion 19. The front surface (right surface in FIG. 5) of the lock projection 63 preferably is formed into an inclined surface 20D so that the lock projection 63 can easily move onto the interlocking portion 18 of the female frame 15. The rear surface (left surface in FIG. 5) of the lock projection 63 is formed into a locking surface 21D preferably slightly inclined backward toward its projecting end.<br>
As shown in FIG. 22, the aforementioned one or more forcible collision preventing ribs 23 extend on the inner surfaces of the lock portions 19 and serve to reinforce the lock portion(s) 19. The forcible collision preventing ribs 23 preferably cross the lock projections 63 in forward and backward directions<br><br>
FBD at intermediate positions (preferably at substantially vertical middle positions).<br>
As shown in FIG. 19, one or more, preferably a pair of guide rails 55 which extend substantially in forward and backward directions FBD adjacent to (above and/or below) the lock portion 19 and preferably between which the bracket 16 is at least partly insertable are formed on the outer surface of the lateral (left) wall 58 of the receptacle 46 to project outward in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 58. These guide rails 55 extend substantially backward from positions near the front end of the lateral (left) wall 58 substantially up to positions slightly before the rear edge of the lock portion 19. As shown in FIG. 16, the guide rails 55 preferably have a substantially L-shaped cross section when viewed from front, and the bracket 16 is at least partly inserted in the inserting direction BID into an area defined between the outer surface of the left wall 58 and surfaces of the guide rails 55 facing the left wall 58. The bracket 16 is stopped at its rear end position in the inserting direction BID preferably by the contact of the leading end of the bracket 16 with the back walls of the guide rails 55 (see FIG. 6).<br>
As shown in FIG. 19, an engaging portion 45 for fixing the bracket 16 and the male housing 12 to each other by being engaged with a locking section 44 of the bracket 16 to be described later preferably is so formed in an area of the outer surface of the lateral (left) wall 58 of the receptacle 46 between the pair of upper and lower guide rails 55 before (at the right side in FIG. 19) the lock portion 19 as to project outward laterally or outwardly or in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 58 (see FIG. 16). As shown in FIG. 5, the front surface (right surface in FIG. 5) of the engaging portion 45 preferably is formed<br><br>
into an inclined surface 20E so that the bracket 16 can easily move thereonto, whereas the rear surface of the engaging portion 45 is formed into a locking surface 21E preferably substantially upright with respect to the outer surface of the lateral (left) wall 42. The bracket 16 is retained by the contact of the locking surface 21E of the engaging portion 45 with the opening edge of the locking section 44 of the bracket 16 from front.<br>
As shown in FIG. 16, the height of the guide rails 55 from the outer surface of the lateral (left) wall 58 preferably is set to be larger than those of the lock portion 19 and the engaging portion 45 from the outer surface of the left wall 58. Thus, the lock portion 19 and the engaging portion 45 are protected by the guide rails 55, thereby being prevented from collision with external matters.<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the length of the bracket 16 in forward and backward directions FBD preferably is set such that the bracket 16 is at least partly located in the deformation area 62 of the lock portion 19 with the bracket 16 at least partly inserted between the guide rails 55 and the locking section 44 of the bracket 16 engaged with the engaging portion 45 of the male housing 12. The female frame 15 preferably is doubly locked by the lock portion 19 and the bracket 16. (Bracket)<br>
As shown in FIG. 6, the bracket 16 preferably is in the form of a rigid (preferably metal) plate and is to be provided on the unillustrated fixing body used to mount the connector. The at least one locking section 44 is formed to penetrate or recess the bracket 16 in thickness direction TD, and can inseparably hold the male housing 12 and the bracket 16 by the engagement<br><br>
with the at least one engaging portion 45 of the male housing 12 to be described later (Female Frame)<br>
The female frame 15 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin and substantially in the form of a block. As shown in FIG. 10, one or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. six in the shown example) accommodating chambers 24 into which the auxiliary connectors 14 are to be at least partly accommodated from an insertion side (preferably substantially from behind) are so formed preferably substantially side by side along width direction WD (transverse direction in FIG. 10) in the female frame 15 as to substantially make openings in the rear wall of the female frame 15. The respective accommodating chambers 24 preferably are shaped to be substantially narrow and long in vertical direction (or a direction at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially normal to the width direction WD, e.g. vertical direction in FIG. 10), and the adjacent accommodating chambers 24 are at least partly partitioned by one or more partition walls 25. One or more, preferably a plurality of (three in the shown example) ribs 26 are so formed on the lateral (left) wall of each accommodating chamber 24 in FIG. 10 as to project inward, to extend substantially forward from the rear edge of the female frame 15, and to be preferably arranged one above another and are designed to guide the entrance of the one or more auxiliary connectors 14 into the accommodating chambers 24 by being engaged with one or more respective guiding grooves 27 formed in the auxiliary connectors 14. Further, at least one reinforcing projection 70 projecting inward is formed at the lateral (right) wall of (at least part, preferably of each) accommodating chamber 24 in FIG, 10 to reinforce the partition wall 25. The rear edge of the<br><br>
reinforcing projection 70 comes substantially into contact with the front edge of a retainer 39 from front to stop the auxiliary connector 14 at its front end position, one or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. four in the shown example) male tab insertion holes 28A through which the one or more tab portions 10 are to be at least partly inserted are formed preferably one substantially above another in the front wall of each accommodating chamber 24, and a slanted surface 29A for guiding the insertion of the tab portion 10 is formed at the opening edge of each tab portion insertion hole 28A as shown in FIG. 8. The one or more ribs 26 are arranged at positions substantially between the male tab insertion holes 28A along vertically direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the (preferably substantially cantilever-shaped) housing locking portion 30 projecting substantially forward is formed at the lateral (ceiling) wall of each accommodating chamber 24. Parts of the female frame 15 are cut off before the housing locking portions 30, and a disengagement jig 71 for forcibly resiliency deforming the housing locking portions 30 in unlocking direction is at least partly insertable into these cut-off parts upon separating the female frame 15 from the male housing 12.<br>
Each housing locking portion 30 preferably is comprised of a resiliency deforrnable arm portion 31 whose front end preferably is a free end, and a locking projection 32 at least partly projecting into the accommodating chamber 24 preferably at a position of the lower or inner surface of the arm portion 31 slightly retracted from the front end. The locking projection 32 is designed to retain the auxiliary connector 14 by being engaged with at least one partial locking or first interacting portion 33 (corresponding to a preferred interacting portion) of the auxiliary connector 14 to be described later with the auxiliary<br><br>
connector 14 at least partly inserted to a substantially proper position in the accommodating chamber 24. The rear surface of the locking projection 32 preferably is formed into an inclined surface 20B so that the locking projection 32 can easily move onto the partial locking or first interacting portion 33 of the auxiliary connector 14, whereas the front surface thereof is formed into a locking surface 21B preferably slightly inclined forward toward the bottom or inward. At least one disengagement recess 34 into which the leading end of the disengagement jig 71 for forcibly resiliency deforming the housing locking portion 30 is at least partly fittable or insertable is formed in the front end surface of the arm portion 31 (see FIGS. 29 and 30).<br>
The one or more finger placing portions 17A projecting outward or upward are formed at the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral (left and/or right) end(s) of the rear edge of the lateral (upper) wall of the female frame 15 in FIG. 8. Further, the finger placing portion 17B projecting outward or downward is formed at an intermediate position (preferably substantially near the transverse center) of the rear edge of the lateral (bottom) wall of the female frame 15 in FIG, 8. The operator can easily separate the female frame 15 from the male housing 12 by holding the finger placing portions 17A, 17B by the fingers.<br>
The one or more interlocking portions 18 projecting transversely outward are formed at an intermediate position (preferably substantially near the vertical centers) of the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral (left and/or right) wall(s) of the female frame 15 in FIG. 8 and are engageable with the one or more respective lock portions 19 of the male housing 12 to be described later. As shown in FIG. 5, the front surface of each interlocking portion 18 preferably<br><br>
is formed into an inclined surface 20A for facilitating a movement of the lock portion 19 onto the interlocking portion 18, and the rear surface thereof is formed into a locking surface 21A preferably inclined slightly backward toward its projecting end. As shown in FIG. 7, the at least one guiding groove 22 extending substantially in forward and backward directions FBD is formed at an intermediate position (preferably substantially near a vertical middle position) of each interlocking portion 18. These one or more guiding grooves 22 are engaged or engageable with one or more forcible collision preventing ribs 23 of the male housing 12 to be described later, whereby the entrance of the female frame 15 in an improper orientation (such as in a vertically inclined posture) can be prevented upon at least partly accommodating the female frame 15 into the male housing 12. This can prevent the front end of the female frame 15 from forcibly colliding with the tab portionslO. When the female frame 15 is at least partly fitted into the receptacle 46 of the male housing 12, the inclined surfaces 20A of the interlocking portions 18 of the female frame 15 come substantially into sliding contact with the inclined surfaces 20D of the lock projections 63 of the male housing 12 substantially from front during this fitting operation and, accordingly, the lock portions 19 are resiliency deformed at least partly into the deformation areas 62. When the female frame 15 is further fitted to reach a substantially properly inserted state, the lock projections 63 of the lock portions 19 preferably move over the interlocking portions 18 of the female frame 15 to resiliency at least partly restore the lock portions 19, whereby the locking surfaces 21D of the lock projections 63 come substantially into contact with the locking surfaces 21A of the interlocking portions 18 of the female frame 15 to retain the female frame 15.<br><br>
(Auxiliary Connector)<br>
Each auxiliary connector 14 is made e.g. of a synthetic resin and preferably has such a flat shape as to have a small dimension in width direction WD (transverse direction in FIG. 11) as shown in FIGS. 11 to 14. As shown in FIG. 14, one or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. four in the shown example) cavities 35 for at least partly accommodating the female terminal fittings 13 are formed preferably one substantially above another (in vertical direction in FIG. 14) in each auxiliary connector 14 and/or extend substantially in forward and backward directions FBD (transverse direction in FIG. 14). The female terminal fittings 13 mounted or mountable on ends of wires 36 are to be at least partly accommodated in the cavities 35. Each female terminal fitting 13 preferably includes a wire connection portion (preferably comprising a barrel portion 37) to connected (preferably be crimped or bent or folded into connection) with the wire 36, and a connecting tube portion (corresponding to a preferred tubular portion) 38 formed before the wire connection portion (preferably the barrel portion 37) and designed to establish an electrical connection with the busbar 11 by the at least partial insertion of the tab portion 10 thereinto. A resilient contact piece 86 extending from the front edge (or near thereto) of the lateral (bottom) wall of the connecting tube portion 38 and folded back inwardly is preferably so formed in the connecting tube portion 38 as to be substantially mountain-shaped or pointed when viewed sideways. At least one locking hole or recess or portion 41 engageable with a locking portion 40 to be described later is formed preferably in the lateral (bottom) wall of the connecting tube portion 38. With the female terminal fittings 13 substantially properly inserted, the retainer 39 to be described later is engaged preferably with rear edges 85<br><br>
(corresponding to preferred engageable portions) of the connecting tube portions 38 for (preferably double) locking. As shown in FIG. 11, a male tab insertion hole 28B through which the tab portion 10 is at least partly inserted is formed in the front wall of each cavity 35, and a tapered or converging surface 29B for guiding the insertion of the tab portion 10 is formed at or near the opening edge of each male tab insertion hole 28B.<br>
The (preferably substantially cantilever-shaped) locking portion 40 extending substantially forward and resiliency engageable with the female terminal fitting 13 is formed at the corresponding lateral (bottom) wall of each cavity 35. This locking portion 40 is to be resiliency engaged with the locking hole or recess or portion 41 of the aforementioned female terminal fitting 13 to prevent the female terminal fitting 13 from coming out backward. The locking portion 40 is resiliency deformable inwardly or outwardly (or in a deforming direction DD intersecting the insertion and withdrawal direction of the terminal fittings 13 into and from the cavities 35 or upward and downward), and preferably vertical displacements of the female terminal fitting 13 are also prevented by the resilient engagement of the locking portion 40. Further, the cavities 35 are arranged in the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40<br>
On the lateral (upper) wall of the auxiliary connector 14, the partial locking or first interacting portion 33 projecting upward or outward is formed at the front end (right end in FIG. 13) or near thereto with respect to the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connector 14 into the female frame 15. The front surface of the locking projection 32 preferably is formed into an inclined surface 20C for making it easier for the locking section 44 of the housing locking portion<br><br>
30 to move onto the partial locking or first interacting portion 33, and/or the rear surface thereof preferably is formed into a locking surface 21C preferably slightly inclined backward toward the top. When the auxiliary connector 14 is at least partly inserted into the accommodating chamber 24 of the female frame 15 in the inserting direction ID (preferably substantially from behind), the inclined surface 20C of the partial locking or first interacting portion 33 of the auxiliary connector 14 comes substantially into sliding contact with the inclined surface 20B of the locking projection 32 of the housing locking portion 30 (from behind) during the insertion, and the housing locking portion 30 is resiliency deformed outward or upward as the inclined surface and the inclined surface 20B slide on each other. When the auxiliary connector 14 is substantially properly inserted thereafter, the locking projection 32 of the housing locking portion 30 moves over the partial locking or first interacting portion 33 of the auxiliary connector 14 and the housing locking portion 30 is resiliency at least partly restored, whereby the locking surface 21B of the locking projection 32 of the housing locking portion 30 comes substantially into contact with the locking surface 21C of the partial locking or first interacting portion 33 of the auxiliary connector 14 (from behind) to prevent the auxiliary connector 14 from coming out backward (see FIG. 1).<br>
On the lateral (upper) wall of the auxiliary connector 14, at least one connector side finger placing portion 72 (corresponding to a preferred finger placing portion) projecting upward or outward is formed at the rear end (left end in FIG. 13) or near thereto with respect to the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connector 14 into the female frame 15. The operator can easily detach the auxiliary connector 14 from the female frame 15 by operating or holding this<br><br>
at least one connector side finger placing portion 72 preferably by the finger. This connector side finger placing portion 72 is formed at a position deviated from the partial locking or first interacting portion 33 in a direction (rightward direction in FIG 11) intersecting with the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connector 14 into the female frame 15.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, with the auxiliary connectors 14 at least partly accommodated at substantially proper positions in the accommodating chambers 24 of the female frame 15, the one or more connector side finger placing portions 72 are located behind the partition walls 25 partitioning the respective accommodating chambers 24 with respect to the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connectors 14 into the female frame 15.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, one or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. three in the shown example) guiding grooves 27 are so formed in the lateral (right) wall of each auxiliary connector 14 (in FIGS. 11 and 12) as to extend substantially in forward and backward directions FBD and preferably to be arranged one substantially above another, and are engageable with the one or more ribs 26 of the female frame 15 described above. These guiding grooves 27 preferably are formed by cutting the material between the cavities 35 arranged one substantially above another inwardly. Thus, even if the female frame 15 is provided with the ribs 26, the enlargement of the entire divided connector in width direction WD can be prevented.<br>
One or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. four in the shown example) retainer accommodating holes 73 having such a depth as to substantially communicate with the respective cavities 35 are formed at positions of a lateral (left) wall 42 of each auxiliary connector 14 in FIGS. 11 and 12 substantially<br><br>
corresponding to the respective cavities 35 (see FIG. 26). Further, one or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. four in the shown example) full locking or second projection accommodating holes 74 having such a depth as to substantially communicate with the respective cavities 35 are formed at one or more positions of the lateral (left) wall 42 substantially corresponding to the lateral (bottom) walls of the respective cavities 35. The opening edges of the rear sides of the retainer accommodating holes 73 and the full locking or second projection accommodating holes 74 preferably substantially are vertically aligned, whereas the opening edges of the front sides of the full locking or second projection accommodating holes 74 are located before those of the front sides of the retainer accommodating holes 73. The retainer 39 preferably is integrally or unitarily formed with the auxiliary connector 14 at the opening edges of the lateral (rear) sides of the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73 and the full locking or second projection accommodating hole(s) 74 via at least one (preferably substantially vertically extending) hinge 75. Thus, the number of parts can be reduced as compared to the case where the retainer 39 is formed as a separate member. This retainer 39 is swingable or pivotable along a direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40 between a partial locking or first position where the female terminal fitting(s) 13 is/are insertable and a full locking or second position where the retainer 39 is engaged with the female terminal fitting(s) 13 to retain the female terminal fitting(s) 13 preferably with the hinge 75 as a supporting point.<br>
As shown in FIG. 24, one or more engageable surfaces 76 (preferably inclined backward toward the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14) are formed at or near the opening<br><br>
edges of the front sides of the retainer accommodating holes 73 and the full locking or second projection accommodating holes 74, and are engageable with one or more full locking or second projections 77 and/or one or more locking protrusions 78 to be described later to hold the retainer 39 at the partial locking position (as a preferred first position) and the full locking position (as a preferred second position).<br>
The retainer 39 includes a (preferably substantially rectangular plate-shaped) base plate portion 79, one or more, preferably a plurality of (e.g. four in the shown example) locking protrusions 78 projecting inward from positions of the inner surface of the base plate portion 79 substantially corresponding to the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73 and engageable with the female terminal fittings 13, and the one or more full locking or second projections 77 (e.g. four in the shown example) projecting inward from positions of the inner surface of the base plate portion 79 substantially corresponding to the full locking or second projection accommodating hole(s) 74 and engageable with (preferably the edge portions of) the full locking or second projection accommodating hole(s) 74,<br>
The front end of the base plate portion 79 preferably projects more forward than the locking protrusion(s) 78 and/or the full locking or second projection(s) 77, and one or more recesses 80 into which an unillustrated jig for canceling the fully locked state of the retainer 39 held at the full locking position (or second position) is at least partly insertable are formed at one or more positions of this front end near the upper and/or bottom ends (upper and bottom ends in FIG. 11).<br><br>
Each full locking projection 77 preferably is in the form of a substantially rectangular plate when viewed from above, and a push-out inclined surface 81 that is brought or bringable substantially into sliding contact with the front end of the female terminal fitting 13 to be pushed, thereby pushing the retainer 39 out of the retainer accommodating holes 73, when the female terminal fitting 13 is inserted with the retainer 39 is at least partly accommodated in the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73 is formed at or near the rear side of the full locking or second projection 77. The full locking or second projection(s) 77 constitute(s) parts of the lateral (bottom) walls of the cavities 35 with the retainer 39 held at the full locking position (second position). At least one full locking or second surface 82A inclined backward toward the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14 with the retainer 39 held at the full locking position (second position) is formed at or near the front end of (preferably each) full locking projection 77.<br>
The (preferably each) locking protrusion 78 preferably has such a fan- or arc-shape substantially centered on the hinge 75 when viewed from above that a distance between the opening edge of the retainer accommodating hole 73 connected to the hinge 75 and the opening edge thereof opposite to the hinge 75. The rear side of the inner surface of the locking protrusion 78 is formed into the push-out inclined surface 81 that is brought substantially into sliding contact with the front end of the female terminal fitting 13 to be pushed, thereby pushing or urging the retainer 39 out of the retainer accommodating hole 73, when the female terminal fitting 13 is at least partly inserted with the retainer 39 accommodated in the retainer accommodating hole 73. This push-out inclined surface 81 is inclined backward (rightward in FIG. 24) toward the outer side<br><br>
(upper side in FIG. 24) in the thickness direction of the left wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14. A partial locking surface 83 inclined forward toward the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14 with the retainer 39 held at the partial locking position (first position) is formed at a position of the front end surface of the locking protrusion 78 near the inner end. A partial locking or first projection 84 projecting substantially forward is formed at an outer side of this partial locking or first surface 83. This partial locking or first projection 84 comes substantially into contact with the outer surface of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14 from the outer side with the retainer 39 held at the partial locking position (first position). A full locking or second surface 82B preferably inclined backward toward the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14 with the retainer 39 held at the full locking position (second position) is formed at a position of the front end surface of the locking protrusion 78 near the outer end.<br>
As shown in FIG. 24, with the retainer 39 held at the partial locking position (first position), the engageable surface(s) 76 of the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73 and the partial locking surface(s) 83 of the retainer 39 is/are engaged with each other. The engageable surface(s) 76 preferably is/are inclined backward toward the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14, and/or the partial locking surface(s) 83 of the retainer 39 preferably is/are inclined forward toward the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14 Thus, an outward displacement of the retainer 39 in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14 is prevented by<br><br>
the engagement of the engageable surface(s) 76 and the partial locking surface(s) 83. The partial locking projection(s) 84 of the retainer 39 come(s) into contact with the opening edge(s) of the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73 from the outer side, thereby preventing the retainer 39 from being pushed into the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73 and inadvertently displaced toward or to the full locking position (second position). As shown in FIG. 27, the one or more female terminal fittings 13 are at least partly insertable into the cavities 35 with the retainer 39 held or positioned at the partial locking position (first position).<br>
If the retainer 39 held or positioned at the partial locking position (first position) is at least partly pushed into the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73, the partial locking or first projection(s) 84 move(s) over the opening edge(s) of the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73 to be disengaged, whereby the retainer 39 is displaceable from the partial locking position (first position) to the full locking position (second position). As shown in FIG. 25, the engageable surface(s) 76 of the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73 and the full locking or second surface(s) 82B of the locking protrusion(s) 78 is/are engaged with each other with the retainer 39 held at the full locking position (second position). The engageable surface(s) 76 is/are inclined backward toward the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14, whereas the full locking or second surface 82B of the locking projection(s) 78 is/are inclined backward toward the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14. Thus, the outward displacement of the retainer 39 in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14 is prevented by the engagement of the engageable surface(s) 76 and the full locking or second surface(s) 82A.<br><br>
The one or more full locking projections 77 are at least partly accommodated into the one or more respective full locking or second projection accommodating holes 74, and the one or more engageable surfaces 76 of the one or more full locking projection accommodating holes 74 are engaged with the one or more full locking or second surfaces 82A of the one or more full locking or second projections 77 with the retainer 39 held at the full locking position (second position). The engageable surface(s) 76 is/are inclined backward toward the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14, and/or the full locking surface(s) 82A of the full locking projection(s) 77 is/are inclined backward toward the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14. Thus, an outward displacement of the retainer 39 in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14 can be prevented by the engagement of the engageable surface(s) 76 and the full locking surface(s) 82A.<br>
In this way, with the retainer 39 held or positioned at the full locking position (second position), the full locking or second surface(s) 82B of the locking protrusion(s) 78 and the engageable surface(s) 76 of the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73 are engaged with each other and/or the full locking or second surface(s) 82A of the full locking or second projection(s) 77 and the engageable surface(s) 76 of the full locking or second projection accommodating hole(s) 74 are engaged with each other. Therefore, the outward displacement of the retainer 39 in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14 can be securely prevented.<br><br>
Further, with the retainer 39 held or positioned at the full locking position (second position), the front end surface of the base plate portion 79 of the retainer 39 preferably is in contact with the opening edge(s) of the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73 and the full locking or second projection accommodating hole(s) 74 from the outer side, thereby prevent a displacement of the retainer 39 toward the inner sides of the retainer accommodating hole(s) 73.<br>
With the retainer 39 held or positioned at the full locking position (second position), the respective locking protrusion(s) 78 is/are located substantially at the substantially same position(s) in the cavity/cavities 35 particularly at the respective stages when viewed from above.<br>
As shown in FIG. 28, the locking protrusion(s) 78 of the retainer 39 is/are engaged with the rear edge(s) 85 of the connecting tube portion(s) 38 of the female terminal fitting(s) 13 from the outer side in the thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 42 of the auxiliary connector 14 (in a direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40) with the retainer 39 held or positioned at the full locking position (second position), whereby displacements of the female terminal fittings 13 along the direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portion 40 are prevented by the retainer 39. The retainer 39 also comes substantially into contact with the rear edge(s) 85 of the connecting tube portion(s) 38 of the female terminal fitting(s) 13 from a withdrawal direction (from behind), whereby the female terminal fitting(s) 13 preferably is/are doubly locked by the locking portion(s) 40 and the retainer 39.<br><br>
With the retainer 39 held or positioned at the full locking position (second position), the respective locking protrusion(s) 78 is/are located substantially at the same position(s) with respect to forward and backward directions FBD in the cavity/cavities 35 (particularly at the respective stages) when viewed from above. The full locking projection(s) 77 constitute(s) the part(s) of the bottom wall(s) of the cavity/cavities 35 to prevent vertical displacements of the female terminal fitting(s) 13.<br>
Next, functions and effects of this embodiment are described. First, the one or more busbars 11 are pressed or inserted into the one or more respective busbar holding grooves 48 of the male housing 12 preferably substantially from front. Then, the one or more fixing portions 50 of the busbar(s) 11 are pressed into the respective one or more fixing holes 51 of the one or more busbar holding grooves 48, whereby the one or more busbars 11 are fixed in the respective busbar holding grooves 48 and the one or more tab portions 10 thereof at least partly project into the receptacle 46. In this state, the busbars 11 particularly are arranged in the thickness direction thereof.<br>
Subsequently, with the retainer 39 held or positioned at the partial locking position (first position), the one or more female terminal fittings 13 mounted at the ends of the respective one or more wires 36 are at least partly inserted into the respective cavities 35 of the auxiliary connectors 14 from an inserting side, preferably substantially from behind (see FIG. 27). Then, the one or more female terminal fittings 13 are retained by the one or more locking portions 40. Since the locking portions 40 are vertically (along a deforming direction DD) engageable with the female terminal fittings 13, vertical displacements of the female terminal fittings 13 are also prevented or restricted.<br><br>
Thereafter, when the retainer 39 is moved to or held or positioned at the full locking position (second position), the one or more locking protrusions 78 of the retainer 39 come into contact with the one or more respective rear edges 85 (preferably of the one or more connecting tube portions 38) of the one or more female terminal fittings 13 from the withdrawal direction, preferably substantially from behind, whereby the one or more female terminal fittings 13 are (preferably doubly) locked by the one or more locking portions 40 and/or the retainer 39. Further, since the locking protrusions 78 of the retainer 39 are engageable with the rear edges 85 of the connecting tube portions 38 in the direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40, displacements of the female terminal fittings 13 along the direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming directions DD of the locking portions 40 can also be prevented (see FIGS. 14 and 28).<br>
Subsequently, the auxiliary connector 14 having the one or more female terminal fittings 13 at least partly accommodated therein is at least partly inserted into each accommodating chamber 24 of the female frame 15 from the inserting side, preferably substantially behind. Then, the inclined surface 20C of the partial locking or first interacting portion 33 of the auxiliary connector 14 comes substantially into sliding contact with the inclined surface 20B of the locking projection 32 of the housing locking portion 30 (preferably substantially from behind) during this inserting operation and, accordingly, the housing locking portion 30 is resiliency deformed outward or upward. Thereafter, when the auxiliary connector 14 is substantially properly inserted, the locking projection 32 of the housing locking portion 30 moves over the partial locking or first interacting portion 33 of the auxiliary connector 14 to resiliency at least<br><br>
partly restore the housing locking portion 30, and the locking surface 21B of the locking projection 32 of the housing locking portion 30 comes substantially into contact with the locking surface 21C of the partial locking interacting portion 33 of the auxiliary connector 14 (preferably substantially from behind) to prevent the auxiliary connector 14 from coming out backward. With the auxiliary connector 14 at least partly accommodated in the accommodating chamber 24 of the female frame 15, the rear end of the auxiliary connector 14 is exposed through the rear surface of the female frame 15 so that the wires 36 can be drawn out through the rear surface of the auxiliary connector 14 (see FIG. 15).<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the one or more connector side finger placing portions 72 of the auxiliary connector(s) 14 are located behind the partition wall(s) 25 with the auxiliary connector(s) 14 at least partly accommodated in the accommodating chamber(s) 24 of the female frame 15.<br>
Further, the one or more ribs 26 formed on the inner surface(s) of the partition wall(s) 25 of the accommodating chamber(s) 24 are at least partly fitted into the one or more respective guiding grooves 27 of the auxiliary connector(s) 14, thereby preventing the auxiliary connector(s) 14 from being at least partly inserted in an improper orientation such as in vertical inclined postures into the accommodating chamber(s) 24.<br>
Subsequently, the female frame 15 having the one or more auxiliary connectors 14 at least partly accommodated therein is at least partly fitted or inserted into the receptacle 46 of the male housing 12. First, the one or more forcible collision preventing ribs 23 formed in or at the receptacle 46 of the male housing 12 and the one or more guiding grooves 22 formed in the female frame 15 are engaged, and the female frame 15 is at least partly inserted into the<br><br>
receptacle 46. This can prevent the female frame 15 from being at least partly inserted in an improper posture such as in a vertically inclined state into the receptacle 46. Further, the one or more forcible collision preventing ribs 23 preferably extend substantially backward from substantially transversely symmetrical positions of the lateral (right and left) walls 57, 58 of the receptacle 46, which can prevent the female frame 15 from being at least partly inserted into the receptacle 46 in an improper posture, e.g. in such a posture inclined with respect to width direction WD, that either one of the lateral (left and right) sides of the front end of the female frame 15 precedes the other. In this way, there can be prevented the collision of the front end of the female frame 15 with the tab portions 10 projecting in the receptacle 46, i.e. so-called forcible collision" resulting from the insertion of the female frame 15 into the receptacle 46 e.g. in an inclined posture.<br>
When the female frame 15 is at least partly inserted into the receptacle 46, the inclined surfaces 20A of the interlocking portions 18 of the female frame 15 come into (preferably substantially sliding) contact with the inclined surfaces 20D of the lock projections 63 of the male housing 12 from front and, accordingly, the lock portion(s) 19 is/are resiliency deformed at least partly into the deformation areas 62. When the connecting operation further proceeds and the female frame 15 is substantially properly inserted, the one or more lock projections 63 of the one or more lock portions 19 move over the one or more respective interlocking portions 18 of the female frame 15 to resiliency at least partly restore the one or more lock portions 19 and/or the locking surface(s) 21D of the lock projection(s) 63 come(s) substantially into contact with the<br><br>
locking surface(s) 21A of the interlocking portion(s) 18 of the female frame 15, thereby retaining the female frame 15.<br>
When the male housing 12 and the female frame 15 are substantially properly connected, the one or more tab portions 10 of the male housing 12 are at least partly inserted into the one or more connecting tube portions 38 of the one or more female terminal fittings 13 through the respective male tab insertion hole(s) 28A of the female frame 15 and the respective male tab insertion hole(s) 28B of the auxiliary connector(s) 14, whereby the plate surface(s) of the tab portion(s) 10 substantially facing in the thickness direction thereof come(s) into contact with the resilient contact piece 86 to electrically connect the busbar(s) 11 and the female terminal fittings 13. As a result, specified (predetermined or predeterminable) female terminal fittings 13 are shorted by the busbars 11.<br>
If the auxiliary connector 14 is partly fitted into the female frame 15 as shown in FIG. 23, the housing locking portion 30 of the female frame 15 remains resiliency deformed outward or upward without being able to be sufficiently resiliency restored. If an attempt is made to connect the female frame 15 with the male housing 12 in this state, the front end of the housing locking portion 30 comes substantially into contact with the front end of the partial connection or first detecting rib 54 from front to hinder the insertion of the auxiliary connector 14. In this way, the partial connection of the auxiliary connector 14 can be detected or avoided. The front end of the housing locking portion 30 preferably has a specific pointed or converging configuration (e.g. inclined backward toward the bottom), whereas the front end of the partial connection detecting rib 54 has a pointed or converging configuration inclined in<br><br>
a complementary manner (backward toward the top) to the specific pointed or converging configuration of the partial connection detecting rib 53. Thus, if the front end of the housing locking portion 30 and the front end of the partial connection detecting rib 54 come substantially into contact with each other, they come into sliding contact to be engaged with the back sides of the mating parts, Therefore, the partly connected state can be securely detected.<br>
With the male housing 12 and the female frame 15 substantially properly connected, the bracket 16 is at least partly inserted into between the guide rails<br>
55	of the male housing 12. First, the outer surface of the bracket guiding portion<br>
56	of the male housing 12 is brought into contact with (preferably the leading<br>
end of) the bracket 16. This makes it easier to guide the bracket 16 into the<br>
clearance between the guide rails 55. When the male housing 12 is pushed<br>
forward (nghtward in FIG. 6) with the bracket 16 held substantially in contact<br>
with the bracket guiding portion 56, the leading end of the bracket 16 comes<br>
substantially into contact with the inclined surface 20E of the engaging portion<br>
45 of the male housing 12 preferably substantially from front. Then, the bracket<br>
16 moves onto the engaging portion 45 to be resiliency deformed. When the<br>
male housing 12 is further pushed, the bracket 16 moves over the engaging<br>
portion 45 to be resiliency at least partly restored, whereby the engaging portion<br>
45 of the male housing 12 is at least partly fitted into the locking section 44 of<br>
the bracket 16 to bring the locking surface 21E of the engaging portion 45 into<br>
contact with the opening edge of the locking section 44 of the bracket 16<br>
preferably substantially from front. In this way, the bracket 16 is locked. In this<br>
state,  the leading end of the bracket  16 at least partly enters the area<br>
(deformation area 62) outside the lock portion 19 of the male housing 12 in the<br><br>
thickness direction of the lateral (left) wall 58, thereby preventing the lock portion 19 from being resiliency deformed into the deformation area 62. As a result, even if a force acts in such a direction as to separate the male housing 12 and the female frame 15, the lock portion 19 can be prevented from undergoing such a resilient deformation as to disengage the lock projection 63 thereof from the interlocking portion 18 of the female frame 15. Therefore, the male housing 12 and the female frame 15 can be locked into each other with an increased force.<br>
Further, the lock portions 19 extend substantially backward (leftward in FIG. 6) from the base ends 60 toward the free ends 61, and this extending direction is along the inserting direction BID (leftward in FIG. 6) of the bracket 16 into the clearance between the guide rails 55. Since the bracket 16 is at least partly inserted in the inserting direction BID into between the guide rails 55 from the base end side of the lock portion 19, the resilient deformation of the base end of the lock portion 19 can be more securely prevented. As a result, the male housing 12 and the female frame 15 can be locked into each other with an even increased force.<br>
Upon disassembling the divided connector assembled as above, for example, for maintenance, the bracket 16 is resiliency deformed outward by an unillustrated jig to disengage the engaging portion 45 and the locking portion 44 and the male housing 12 is pulled backward, whereby the male housing 12 and the bracket 16 can be separated from each other.<br>
Subsequently, the lock portion(s) 19 is/are resiliency deformed into the deformation area(s) 62 by means of an unillustrated jig to disengage the lock portion(s) 19 and the interlocking portion(s) 18, and the male housing 12 and<br><br>
female frame 15 are pulled backward away from each other to be separated. At this time, an operator can easily place his fingers on the one or more frame side finger placing portions 17A, 17B since the one or more notches 52 are formed at the front edges of the lateral (ceiling) wall and/or the lateral (bottom) wall of the receptacle 46 of the male housing 12, the one or more frame side finger placing portions 17A, 17B of the female frame 15 are at least partly accommodated in these one or more respective notches 52, and the finger placing slants 53A, 53B are formed on the outer or upper surface of the lateral (ceiling) wall and/or on the outer or lower surface of the lateral (bottom) wall. Since the operator can pull the female frame 15 backward, for example, by placing his index finger and middle finger on the finger placing portions 17A on the ceiling wall and his thumb on the frame side finger placing portion 17B on the bottom wall, forces can be easily exerted to the female frame 15 substantially in a vertically well-balanced manner, which can improve operation efficiency.<br>
Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 29, the disengagement jig 71 is or can be at least partly inserted into the accommodating chamber 24 through an area of the female frame 15 before the housing locking portion 30 to bring the leading end thereof into contact with the disengagement recess 34 of the housing locking portion 30 substantially from front. At this time, the disengagement jig 71 can be securely brought into contact with the front end of the housing lock portion 30 since the disengagement recess 34 is formed. As shown in FIG. 30, the housing locking portion 30 is resiliency deformed upward or outward by this disengagement jig 71 to disengage the locking projection 32 of the housing locking portion 30 and the partial locking interacting portion 33 of<br><br>
the auxiliary connector 14, and the auxiliary connector 14 is or may be pulled backward to be separated from the female frame 15. Since the operator can pull out the auxiliary connector 14 particularly by holding the connector side finger placing portions 72 of the auxiliary connector 14 by the fingers at this time, force can be easily exerted to the auxiliary connector 14, thereby improving operation efficiency.<br>
Subsequently, the retainer 39 of the auxiliary connector 14 is or can be displaced from the full locking position (second position) to the partial locking position (first position) by being swung or pivoted outward about the hinge 75. Thereafter, the locking portion(s) 40 is/are pressed by an unillustrated jig to be disengaged from the female terminal fitting(s) 13, and the female terminal fitting(s) 13 is/are pulled out backward to be separated from the auxiliary connector 14.<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, the retainer 39 is mounted into the auxiliary connector 14 in the direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40. Since the respective cavities 35 are arranged substantially in the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40, the locking protrusions 78 of the retainer 39 are arranged substantially at the same positions in the cavities 35 (particularly at the respective stages) when viewed in the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40 (arranged direction of the cavities 35) with the retainer 39 at least partly accommodated in the retainer accommodating hole 73. As a result, the positions of the female terminal fittings 13 at least partly accommodated in the cavities 35 at the respective stages to be locked by the retainer 39 can be substantially aligned. Thus, the retainer 39<br><br>
having the hinge 75 can be applied to the connector formed with the cavities 35 arranged in the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40.<br>
Further, the female terminal fittings 13 are preferably doubly locked by the retainer 39 in the direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portion 40. Thus, displacements of the female terminal fittings 13 along the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40 are prevented or hindered by the locking portions 40 and those of the female terminal fittings 13 along the direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40 are prevented or hindered by the retainer 39, Since displacements along two different directions can be prevented in this way, the postures of the female terminal fittings 13 can be stabilized.<br>
If an attempt is made to insert the female terminal fitting 13 into the cavity 35 with the retainer 39 inadvertently accommodated into the retainer accommodating hole 73 before all the female terminal fittings 13 are at least partly inserted into the cavities 35, the female terminal fitting 13 comes substantially into contact with the retainer 39. At this time, the female terminal fitting 13 may be damaged if being forcibly pushed into the cavity 35 in the case where the retainer 30 is, for example, constructed not to be displaced even if being pushed by the female terminal fitting 13.<br>
This embodiment takes the above into account and if the female terminal fitting 13 is at least partly inserted into the cavity 35 with the retainer 39 accommodated in the retainer accommodating holes 73, the female terminal fitting 13 comes substantially into sliding contact with the push-out inclined surface 81 to push it, whereby the retainer 39 can be moved out of the cavity<br><br>
35. Since a force exerted to insert the female terminal fitting 13 can escape or be diverted in this way, the damage of the female terminal fitting 13 can be prevented.<br>
Further, the tab portions 10 preferably are formed by being cut at the opposite side, and the cut surfaces are not necessarily smooth because a large force was applied for the cutting operation. Thus, the connection stability of the tab portions 10 and the resilient contact pieces 86 may be reduced if the above cut surfaces are brought into contact with the resilient contact pieces 86.<br>
This embodiment particularly takes the above into account and the plate surfaces facing in the thickness direction of the tab portions 10 are brought substantially into contact with the resilient contact pieces 86. This can make electrical connection between the tab portions 10 and the resilient contact pieces 86 more secure.<br>
In this embodiment, the one or more connector side finger placing portions 72 preferably are provided on the auxiliary connector(s) 14. Since this enables the operator to separate the auxiliary connector 14 from the female frame 15 particularly by holding the connector side finger placing portions 72 by the fingers, the efficiency of the separating operation of the auxiliary connector 14 can be improved.<br>
Further, since the one or more connector side finger placing portions 72 preferably are deviated from the interacting portions 33 engageable with the housing locking portions 30 of the female frame 15 in the direction intersecting with the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connector(s) 14 into the accommodating chamber(s) 24, a mold can be removed backward with respect, to the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connector(s) 14 upon forming the<br><br>
interacting portion(s) 33. This makes it unnecessary to use a sliding mold upon forming the auxiliary connector(s) 14, wherefore production cost can be reduced.<br>
Since the aforementioned one or more connector side finger placing portions 72 are deviated from the one or more interacting portions 33 engageable with the one or more housing locking portions 30 of the female frame 15 in the direction intersecting with the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connector(s) 14 into the accommodating chamber(s) 24, the auxiliary connectors 14 are supposedly enlarged in the direction intersecting with the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connector(s) 14 into the accommodating chamber(s) 24. In view of this, one or more the connector side finger placing portions 72 are arranged at positions substantially behind the partition walls 25 partitioning the accommodating chambers 24 with respect to the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connector(s) 14 into the accommodating chamber(s) 24 with the auxiliary connector(s) 14 at least partly accommodated in the accommodating chambers 24. Areas behind the partition wall(s) 25 with respect to the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connector(s) 14 into the accommodating chamber(s) 24 have been conventionally dead spaces. Since the one or more connector side finger placing portions 72 are arranged in these areas, the enlargement of the entire divided connector including the female frame in the direction intersecting with the inserting direction ID of the auxiliary connector(s) 14 into the accommodating chamber(s) 24 can be prevented with the auxiliary connector(s) 14 at least partly accommodated in the female frame 15.<br><br>
Accordingly, to provide a connector in which cavities are arranged in the resiliency deforming direction of locking portions and to which a retainer having a hinge is applicable, a retainer 39 is integrally or unitarily formed with an auxiliary connector 14 via at least one hinge 75 at or near the opening edges of one or more retainer accommodating holes 73 formed in a side surface of the auxiliary connector 14 substantially facing in a direction intersecting with the resiliency deforming direction DD of locking portions 40. Further, one or more cavities 35 preferably are arranged in the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40. Thus, with the retainer 39 at least partly accommodated in the retainer accommodating holes 73, one or more locking protrusions 78 of the retainer 39 are arranged substantially at the same positions in the one or more cavities 35 (preferably at the respective stages) when viewed in the resiliency deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40 (arranged direction of the cavities 35). As a result, positions of the female terminal fittings 13 with the retainer 39 preferably need not be differed for the female terminal fittings 13 to be at least partly accommodated in the cavities 35 at the respective stages, wherefore the retainer 39 having a hinge 75 can be applied to the connector formed with the cavities 35 arranged in the resiliently deforming direction DD of the locking portions 40. <other embodiments></other>
