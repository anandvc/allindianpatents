COATING FINISHING METHOD<br>
'Ifedbnica I l
The present invention relates to a coating finishing method for a metal substrate surface or an old coated face on a metal substrate usin? a water-based coating material which is suited fox maintaining a fine view i;;»f structures such as buildings, bridges and }3]ant facilities uv&amp;r a long period of time.<br>
Backgroiiiici. Art<br>
In general, solvent base top coating: materials such as an alkyii resin base coating material, an acryl alkj^d resin base coating material a i-iilicon aJlcyd resin base coating material and a phthalic<br>
f<br>
acid resi):. b:;;ise enamel coadng material are coated on the surfaces of striictiires sach as buildings, bridges, plant facilities and steel towers after coatiniif; rust preventive coating materials.   Such coating step compriseH usually coating once or twice a rus t preventive coating material and then coating thereon once or twice a top coacing material ■■mch as a phthalic acid resin base enamel coating material,<br>
I<br>
and the cc'ating step as desired to be shortened from an economical point of viBw,   Further, in recent years, erivir'onmental protective counternieasures such as a rise in working; environment and a stre:c gtheik in environmental regulation hfive become social subjects, and therefore a non-environmental pollution type water-based<br>
I<br>
coating sj/stum has come to be required more and more strongly.<br>
It 1,3 Imown as a water based coatiiig system which is coated on a metiil liiace to coat a water-based rust preventive coating material cjociiprising a water-based alkyd resin as a base resin component and then coat thereon a top coating material comprising an acryl resin emulsion as a base resin component.<br>
Hcnvever, the existing situation is that the top coating material comprising an acrjd resin emulsion as a base resin component, forms a film by fusion of acryl resin emulsion particles<br>
I I<br>
and thereibite has a low finishing property'(glossiness) after coating ind that it m not reliable as compared with a solvent base coating<br><br>
systeim iij the point that the coating tilm tbrmed has an ansatisfi3.::tcry gas-barrier property of oxygen and steam.   Thus, required i:o he developed is a water-based coating system in which the same perlitrmance as in coating by a solvent type coating material is exhil)il:ed by coating a waterbased coating material on the surface of metals.<br>
0;ii the other hand, coating material compositionie comprising a water-l'iEi s(i:'d fatty acid-modified acryl resin having both of the iunctions of a water-based alkyd resin and a water-based acryl resin are disclosed in Japanese Patent Apphcation Laid-Open No. 8773/1984 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 319525/2000.   It is described in the above publications that the above coatirig material compositions form coating films having an excellent ccirosion resistance and is suited as a primer for a metal face,,   Hovi^i^ver, there is in^7c»lved therein the problem that the coating fiJ.mi!:; formed are unsatisfactory in a water resistance and a weatherabiilLity attributable to the fatty acid component which is a soft com|:ni;i'n:mt, and. mere coating of the above coating material compositii'Dniiii oa the surface of a metal substrate can not sufficiently proteci;; the surface of the metal over a long period of time.<br>
Discloiiiiu^?! o,f the In'i^intioii<br>
A prijicipal object of the present invention is to provide a coatiag fuiishing method by a water-basedj coating material which shovi^s a gQod finished appearance and which can maintain a fine view of mi?tsil surfaces used for structures such as buildings, bridges and plant iai:;ilities over a long period of ti^^e.<br>
I<br>
The present inventors have found that the object described above can m achieved by a coating finishihg method in which a wate:r-based under coating material is coated on a metal substrate md in which, a waterbased coating material comprising a water-ijasecl fatty acid-modified acryl resin having a specific average particle diameter as a base resin component and containing a pigment in a specific concentration is coated on the coated face thereof, a]id they have come to complete the present invention.<br><br>
Tlius;., the present invention provides a coating finishing method cotnprising coating a water-based;under coating material (I) on a siirtace of a metal substrate or an old coated face of a metal<br>
r<br>
substrata? and then coating on a coated surface thereof, a water based coating material (II) comprising a water-based fatty acid-modified acryl resin as a base resin component, wherein the above water-based (ioating E:.iaterial (II) contains a pigment im a pigment volume concetitriyiicm falling in a range of 5 to 45 %, and the above water based fatvy acid-modiified aciyl resin has a form of a fine particle havrig a;n average particle diameter falhrlg in a range of 50 to 500 nm.<br>
Tilt::' li'/ater-based coating material (IT) used for the method of the present mvention is excellent in a film-forming property and a glossiness aad can provide the formed coating film with a gas-barrier property by the fatty acid component which is a soft component and cross"liakiii!:!:, and therefore it can inhibit gases such as steam and oxygen from reaching an under coating film..   Further, bleeding of rust and a blistering phenomenon can be xeduced by providing a coating film by the water-based under coating material (1), and therefore according to the present invention, a finished coating film which prote<:ts a metal face over long period of time can be formed.></:ts>

The virater-based under coating material (I) described above<br>
preferably contains a pigment in a higher pigment volume<br>
concentrjiticn than that of the waterbased coating material (II) for<br>
the purposes of inhibiting bhstering in the finally obtained multilayer<br>
coating filju from being generated and cbnstroJling unevenness on a<br>
surface to be coated, and it preferably contains a pigment in a<br>
pigment volume concentration falling in airange of usuaHy 30 to 50 %,<br>
particulai'ly 34 to 4(5 %.	j   i<br>
In th;i.s respect, the "pigment volikme concentration' is a<br>
I	!<br>
volurae proportion of the above pigment based on the total sohd matt3r of the whole resin cotoponents and|the whole pigments i^ontsinecl in the coating material.   In the;present specification, a specific giavity of the pigment which is ja ground for calculating a volurae of the pigment is referred to PaikitjRaw Material Manual sixth edlt].on edited by Japan Paint Industry i^sociation, and it is<br><br>
assumed t:h;at a specific gravity of the resin is approximate to 1,<br>
TlfiO ]:»igment which is blended with the water-based under coatini? ni^icerial (I) includes, for example J color pigments such as titanium white and red iron oxide; extender pigments such as calcium carbonate, magnesium silicate hydrate, talc, mica, clay and barj^ta; a:iid rust preventive pigments such as phosphoric acid base pigments and a phosphoric acid base pigment is preferably blended as a part of the pigment ixom the viewpoint of the corrosion resii3tance.    Capable of being given as thd phosphoric acid base pigment are, for example, 2;inc phosphate, phospho •zinc:^silicate, alurninuni zinc phosphate, calcium zinc phosphate, calcium phosphate?!. Mluminum pyrophosphate, calcium pyrophosphate, aluminum tripolydihydrogenphosphate, aluminum metaphosphate, calcium metaphosphate, zinc phosphomolybdate and aluminum phosphoriiolybdate.   They can be used alpne or in combination of two or more kinds thereol:.

I<br>
-van be chismged according to the kind of the water-based under<br><br>
coating nial/arial, and it can be dried;as well at a temperature of about 40"0 i:ir less.   The drying tim(^ at ahmt 25°C can be, for example, 1 to 720 hours, preferably 2 to 336 hours after coating.<br>
Tine ^vater-based coating material (ID coated on a surface on which thii! water'bai5ed under coating material (I) described above Ls coated actiording to the method of th6 present invention contains as a base resi:ri component, a water-based fatty acid-modified acryl resin having a ]:o:irm of a fine particle having an average particle diameter fallirLg in a range of 50 to 500 nm, pairticulariy 75 to 400 nm and further pardcuilariy 100 to 250 ma.   If the waterbased tatty acid-modified J3,c:ryl resin has an average particle diameter of less than 50 nm, not only the coating material is increased in a viscosity to make it difficult; to form a smooth coating film, l^ut also the state of the coating nuitiitrial after storage at a low temperature is reduced.   On the other hand, if the average particle diameter exceeds 500 nm, a storage stability of the coating material becomes unsatisfactory and the film-foriiimg property is reduced.   Farther, the coating film formed is re'iuced as well in a gavS-barrier property, and therefore the<br>
i<br>
libove 'IS 15(11; preferred.   In the presept specification, the average parti?le d iameter is a value obtained|by measuring the sample<br>
i<br>
diluted ti&gt; a concentration suited to the measurement with deionized wate:r at a room temperature (about 30'C):by means of "Si^D-3100" !trads nanui^ a laser diffraction type particle size distribution cieasuidiig apparatus, manufactured!by Shimadzu Mfg-.'Co., Ltd.).<br>
