				<td>FILTERS UTILIZING COMBINATION OF TE AND MODIFIED HE MODE<br>
DIELECTRIC RESONATORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the fields of dielectric resonator filters in mobile and satellite commutations. The present invention specifically relates to filters utilizing combination of TE and modified HE mode dielectric resonators.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Dielectric resonator filters play an important role in mobile and satellite communications. Two types of dielectric resonator filters are commonly used. One type is a dual mode dielectric resonator filter, which operates in a HE 11 mode and provides low loss, smaller volume and elliptic function realizations. The inferior spurious characteristics in the output are the drawback of the dual mode dielectric resonator filters. The other type is a single mode dielectric resonator loaded filter with all resonators operating in TE 01 mode, which provides low loss and good spurious free performance. In order to get the elliptic function characteristics in these types of filters, electric coupling between non-adjacent resonators is needed.<br>
In the Dielectric resonator filters, the dominant coupling between dielectric resonators is magnetic in nature, which can be coupled between DR using easily tunable irises. In case of elliptic filters, there is a need to couple electric field between non-adjacent dielectric resonators, which in the conventional approach needs some additional metallic member between the resonators. In prior arts, the electric field coupling between dielectric resonator pucks are achieved through ground isolated coaxial probe method and bar coupling method.<br><br>
FIG. 1 shows a ground isolated probe method, which is the most commonly used method for realization of the electric field coupling between TE mode dielectric resonator pucks 2 and 4, which are separated by a metal separating wall 3. In this method, a metal probe 7 is placed in a suitable manner near the dielectric resonator pucks 2 and 4 to be coupled. The metal probe 7 is mounted between the metal cavities 1 and 5 by a proper process. This metal probe 7 is isolated from the metal cavities 1 and 5 by a suitable dielectric material 6, normally Teflon. The probe dimensions become smaller with increase in frequency and the probe fabrication as well as assembly becomes increasingly difficult. Thus, the metal probe 7 is an additional component. Moreover, the assembled probe coupling cannot be tuned and some other components and processes have to be employed for fine-tuning the required coupling. The metal probe 7 is normally placed very close to the dielectric resonator pucks 2 and 4, and hence limits the designs from spurious modes and high power point of view.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a bar coupling method for realization of the electric field coupling between TE mode dielectric resonator pucks 2 and 4. The coupling Bar 6 made from INVAR material is normally required for applications requiring operation over large temperature range. This bar coupling can solve the tuning problem to some extent but still this is an additional component required for the desired coupling. For low coupling values, the gaps between the wall 3 and the coupling bar 6 is low, which restricts suitable modification in the coupling arrangement for high power applications.<br>
Further, the filters utilize mixed mode electric couplings to use two HE mode resonators 5 and 6. Coupling between TE mode resonators 2 and 4 i.e. TE- TE coupling as well as TE-HE coupling is positive coupling where as HE-HE coupling is negative coupling. In conventional mixed mode coupling, an Iris 7 is used between the HE mode resonators 5 and 6 for positive coupling in the same manner as is used for positive coupling between two TE mode resonators 2 and 4, as shown in FIG. 3. Hence, the negative coupling is also fully tunable in this<br><br>
method. However, there are many problems associated with this conventional implementation of the mixed mode coupling. In particular, the HE dielectric resonators 5 and 6 have two degenerate modes at same frequency and are exploited well for dual mode DR filters, but it is very difficult to separate in the single mode filters. Moreover, the size and weight of HE mode dielectric resonators 5 and 6 is high as compared to the TE mode resonators 2 and 4.<br>
With respect to the conventional approaches, additional components circuit are utilized for realization of the electric field coupling between TE mode dielectric resonator pucks. However, in mixed mode electric couplings, these approaches result in higher the size and weight of the HE mode dielectric resonators, and also it is very difficult to separate the two degenerate modes of the resonators. Therefore, it is essential to provide an electrical field coupling between a pair of non-adjacent dielectric resonators operating in single mode filter without using any additional component.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a dielectric resonator filter, which achieves an electrical field coupling between a pair of non-adjacent dielectric resonators operating in single mode filter without using any additional coupling member.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a dielectric resonator filter, which enables easy separation of two degenerate modes that results in a wide spurious free performance.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a dielectric resonator filter, which reduces the size and weight of HE dielectric resonator.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
According to one aspect, the present invention, which achieves the objectives, relates to a dielectric resonator filter comprising a metal wall configured with metal cavities. Dielectric resonators can be placed in the metal cavities and configured as a set of cylindrical TE mode resonators and a set of rectangular HE mode resonators. Separating walls are disposed between the dielectric resonators, which include tunable irises for electromagnetic mixed coupling between the cylindrical TE mode resonators and the rectangular HE mode resonators. The rectangular HE mode resonators are configured to push far up the TE mode in frequency along with the undesired orthogonal HE mode. This leads to an easy separation of two degenerate HE modes and also achieves a wide spurious free electric coupling without using any additional coupling member.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be discussed in greater detail with reference to the accompanying Figures.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a ground isolated probe used for coupling two cylindrical dielectric resonator pucks, in accordance with a prior art.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a metallic bar for coupling an electric field between dielectric resonator pucks, in accordance with a prior art.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a conventional mixed mode coupling between cylindrical dielectric resonator pucks, in accordance with a prior art.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a dielectric resonator filter with mixed mode couplings between   cylindrical   dielectric   resonator   pucks   and   rectangular   dielectric<br><br>
resonator pucks, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a dielectric resonator filter with mixed mode couplings between cylindrical dielectric resonators 12 and 14 and rectangular dielectric resonators 15 and 16, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The dielectric resonator filter is a single mode filter that utilizes mixed couplings between the dielectric resonators 12, 14, 15 and 16, where the dielectric resonators are configured as the cylindrical TE mode resonators 12 and<br>
14	and the rectangular HE mode resonators 15 and 16.<br>
Moreover, the dielectric resonator filter comprises a metal wall 11 configured with metal cavities. The dielectric resonators 12, 14, 15 and 16 can be placed in the metal cavities. Separating walls 13 are disposed between the dielectric resonators 12, 14, 15 and 16, which include tunable irises 17 for electromagnetic mixed coupling between the cylindrical TE mode resonators 12 and 14 and the rectangular HE mode resonators 15 and 16. Therefore, HE-HE coupling through the tunable irises 17 is used for realizing the electric coupling.<br>
The rectangular shape of the HE mode resonators 15 and 16 is optimized in such a manner that the frequency of required HE mode is not affected much whereas the unwanted orthogonal HE mode is pushed far up. The TE mode is also pushed far up in frequency in the rectangular HE mode dielectric resonators<br>
15	and 16. By using the rectangular HE mode resonators 15 and 16, the TE<br>
mode is no more on the lower side and moves higher along with the undesired<br>
orthogonal HE mode. Thus, this leads to an easy separation of the two<br>
degenerate HE modes and provides a wide spurious free range for the filters<br>
without using any additional coupling member. Such large spurious free<br>
performance of the filter is suitable for high performance filter application.<br><br>
Additionally, the size and weight of this rectangular HE mode dielectric resonator 15 and 16 is less than the conventional cylindrical HE dielectric resonators.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A dielectric resonator filter with combination of TE and HE modes,<br>
comprising:<br>
a metal wall configured with a plurality of metal cavities;<br>
