				<td>Ketomethionine ketals and their derivatives<br>
Introduction<br>
The present invention relates to ketomethionine ketals<br>
and hemiketals and derivatives thereof and also<br>
production thereof and use thereof as feed additives,<br>
in particular for the nutrition of ruminants.<br>
Prior art<br>
Amino acids such as methionine, lysine or threonine<br>
are, as feed additives, important components of animal<br>
nutrition. They make possible more rapid growth and<br>
also more efficient feed utilization. This usually<br>
represents an important economic advantage. The markets<br>
for feed additives are of great industrial and economic<br>
importance. In addition, they are great growth markets<br>
which is due, not least, to the increasing importance<br>
of countries such as China and India, for example.<br>
WO 2004008874 discloses, inter alia, that methionine is<br>
the first limiting amino acid for many animal species,<br>
including ruminants. For instance in the case of dairy<br>
cows, for example, efficient milk production with<br>
respect to the amount and quality is greatly dependent<br>
on a sufficient supply of methionine. The methionine<br>
requirement of high performance dairy cows cannot be<br>
covered in this case by the microbial protein formed in<br>
the rumen or by protein from the feed not degraded in<br>
the rumen (Graulet et al., J. Animal and Feed Sciences<br>
(2004), 269). It is therefore advantageous to<br>
supplement methionine to the feed to increase the<br>
economic efficiency of milk production and the quality<br>
of the milk.<br>
In the case of monogastric animals such as, for<br>
example, poultry and pigs, customarily, as feed<br><br>
additive, use is made of methionine and the Methionine<br>
Hydroxy Analogue (MHA), which is also termed<br>
hydroxymethylthiobutyric acid (HMB). This increases the<br>
available amount of L-methionine in the body which can<br>
then be available to the animal for growth.<br>
In contrast thereto, supplementation of the feed with<br>
methionine is ineffective in ruminants, since the<br>
majority is degraded by microbes in the rumen of<br>
ruminants. Owing to this degradation, therefore, only a<br>
fragment of the methionine supplemented passes into the<br>
small intestine of the animal, where generally the<br>
absorption of methionine into the blood proceeds.<br>
WO 99/04647 describes the use of MHA for ruminants.<br>
Therein it is asserted that MHA is only in part broken<br>
down in the rumen and therefore at least 20-40% of the<br>
supplemented MHA, after absorption in the small<br>
intestine, can pass in to metabolism. In numerous other<br>
publications, in contrast, the mode of action of MHA in<br>
ruminants is discussed differently. For instance,<br>
WO 200028835, for example, describes that MHA can only<br>
successfully pass through the rumen and finally into<br>
the small intestine for absorption when MHA is<br>
administered in very large amounts of<br>
60-120 g/day/animal. However this precludes economic<br>
efficiency.<br>
In order that methionine products such as<br>
D,L-methionine or rac-MHA are available to ruminants<br>
with high efficiency, a form protected against rumen<br>
degradation must be used. The challenge in this case is<br>
to find a suitable methionine product which gives the<br>
methionine a rumen stability as high as possible and<br>
nevertheless ensures high and efficiency absorption of<br>
the methionine in the gut. There is a plurality of<br>
possibilities in this case of giving D,L-methionine or<br>
rac-MHA these properties:<br><br>
a) Physical protection:<br>
By application of a suitable protective layer or<br>
distribution of the methionine in a protective matrix,<br>
a high rumen stability can be achieved. As a result,<br>
the methionine can pass through the rumen virtually<br>
without loss. In its further course, the protective<br>
layer is then, for example, opened or removed by acid<br>
hydrolysis in the abomasum and the methionine released<br>
can then be absorbed by the animal in the small<br>
intestine. The protective layer or protective matrix<br>
can consist of a combination of a plurality of<br>
substances such as, for example, lipids, inorganic<br>
materials and carbohydrates. The following product<br>
forms are commercially available:<br>
i) Met-Plus™ from Nisso America is a lipid-protected<br>
methionine having a D,L-methionine content of 65%.<br>
The protective matrix consists of the calcium<br>
salts of long chain fatty acids such as, for<br>
example, lauric acid. As preservative, butylated<br>
hydroxytoluene is used.<br>
ii) Mepron* M85 from Degussa AG is a carbohydrate-<br>
protected methionine which has a core of<br>
D,L-methionine, starch and stearic acid. As<br>
protective layer, ethylcellulose is used. The<br>
product has a content of 85% D,L-methionine.<br>
iii) Smartamine™ M from Adisseo is a polymer-protected<br>
methionine. The pellets, in addition to stearic<br>
acid, contain at least 70% D,L-methionine. The<br>
protective layer contains vinylpyridine-styrene<br>
copolymer.<br>
Although the physical protection prevents microbial<br>
breakdown of methionine in the rumen and as a result<br><br>
the supply and utilization of methionine in the animal<br>
can be increased, there are some serious disadvantages.<br>
The production or coating of methionine is usually a<br>
technically complicated and laborious process and is<br>
therefore expensive. In addition the surface coating of<br>
the finished pellets can easily be damaged by<br>
mechanical load and abrasion during feed processing<br>
which can lead to reduction or up to complete loss of<br>
the protection. Therefore, it is also not possible to<br>
process and repellet the protected methionine pellets<br>
to form a larger compound feed pellet, since, as a<br>
result, again the protecting layer would break owing to<br>
the mechanical stress. This greatly restricts the use<br>
of such products, since compound feed pelleting is a<br>
widely used method of feed processing.<br>
b) Chemical protection:<br>
Increased rumen stability of methionine can, in<br>
addition to purely physical protective possibilities,<br>
also be achieved by modifying the chemical structure,<br>
for example by esterifying the carboxylic acid group.<br>
Currently, the following products are commercially<br>
available or are described in the literature:<br>
i) Methionine esters such as, for example, D,L-tert-<br>
butylmethionine: The esters have been tested and<br>
demonstrated only moderate rumen stability (Loerch and<br>
Oke; "Rumen Protected Amino Acids in Ruminant<br>
Nutrition" in "Absorption and Utilization of Amino<br>
Acids" Vol. 3, 1989, 187-200, CRC Press, Boca Raton,<br>
Florida). For D,L-tert-butylmethionine, in contrast, in<br>
WO 0028835, a biological value of 80% was published.<br>
ii) Metasmart™ from Adisseo is the racemic isopropyl<br>
ester of MHA (HMBi) . This compound is also marketed<br>
under the trademark "Sequent" by the American company<br><br>
Novus. In WO 00/28835, a biological value of at least<br>
50% for HMBi in ruminants was published. In this case,<br>
especially, the surprisingly rapid absorption of the<br>
hydrophobic HMBi through the rumen wall plays a<br>
decisive role. The ester can then be hydrolysed to MHA<br>
in the blood and, after oxidation and subsequent<br>
transamination, can be converted to L-methionine. In<br>
the patent EP 1358805, a comparable biological value<br>
for HMBi was published. In these studies, HMBi was<br>
applied to a porous support. In a further publication,<br>
the European Commission reported that, again,<br>
approximately 50% HMBi is absorbed via the rumen wall<br>
(European Commission: Report of the Scientific<br>
Committee on Animal Nutrition on the Use of HMBI; 25<br>
April 2003) . Graulet et al. published in 2004 in the<br>
Journal of Animal and Feed Science (269), that better<br>
diffusion through the rumen wall is enabled by the<br>
lipophilic properties of the isopropyl group of HMBi.<br>
For the production of HMBi, two different processes<br>
have been published. Thus, HMBi can either be<br>
synthesized directly in one stage from the<br>
corresponding cyanohydrin (WO 00-59877). Esterification<br>
to give the isopropyl ester proceeds in this case in<br>
situ, without needing to isolate MHA in advance.<br>
Another process, in contrast, esterifies pure MHA with<br>
isopropanol (WO 01-58864 and WO 01-56980). In both<br>
cases, for the synthesis, use is made of prussic acid<br>
which is expensive and in addition is a great potential<br>
hazard.<br>
iii) Ketomethionine and its carboxylic acid<br>
derivatives: The use of this class of compounds, in<br>
particular of ketomethionine itself, as feed additives<br>
was first described recently in application<br>
WO 2006-072711. There, a technical process for<br>
producing ketomethionine and carboxylic acid<br>
derivatives thereof was also described. Ketomethionine<br><br>
is the direct precursor of methionine and can readily<br>
be converted in the body to L-methionine in one step by<br>
means of transamination. In comparison therewith, both<br>
MHA and HMBi have the disadvantage that they require<br>
two or three steps for conversion to L-methionine in<br>
the body. For instance, HMBi must first be hydrolysed<br>
to free MHA and subsequently oxidized to ketomethionine<br>
with the aid of an oxidase. Not until then can in turn<br>
the ketomethionine be directly reductively aminated to<br>
give L-methionine [Baker; "Utilization of Precursors<br>
for L-Amino Acids" in "Amino Acids in Farm Animal<br>
Nutrition" (D'Mello, J.P.F., ed.), 1994, 37-64. CAB<br>
Intl., Wallingford, Oxon, UK].<br>
Free ketomethionine as ct-ketocarboxylic acid and its<br>
salts such as, for example, the sodium or calcium salt,<br>
are compounds already known from the literature for a<br>
long time and have been produced both biochemically and<br>
chemically. Meister, for example, obtained the sodium<br>
salt of a-ketomethionine in a yield of 77% by the<br>
L-amino oxidase-catalysed oxidation of methionine<br>
(Meister, J. Biol. Chem. 1952, 197, 309). Previously,<br>
Waelsch et al., showed that the amino oxidases present<br>
in liver can convert methionine to a-ketomethionine<br>
(Waelsch et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1938, 61, 2252).<br>
Mosbach et al., likewise described the production of<br>
ketomethionine by the L-amino oxidase-catalysed<br>
oxidation of methionine. In this case immobilized<br>
Providencia sp. PCM 1298 cells were used (Mosbach et<br>
al.. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1982, 4, 409).<br>
As a further possible synthesis method, Sakurai et al.<br>
in 1957 published the first chemical synthesis route<br>
for synthesising a-ketomethionine. In this case, as key<br>
step, methyl -cc-methoxalyl -y-methylmercaptopropionate<br>
was hydrolyzed with dilute hydrochloric acid to give<br>
ketomethionine (Sakurai et al., J. of Biochemistry<br>
1957, 44, 9, 557). Yamada et al. published virtually<br><br>
simultaneously the same synthesis route, after first<br>
attempts at synthesizing a-ketomethionine via an<br>
a-oximo ester formed as an intermediate gave only low<br>
yields. (Chibata et al., Bull. Agr. Chem. Soc. Japan<br>
1957, 21, 6, 336) .<br>
The biological value of the sodium salt of a-keto-<br>
methionine was determined for the first time in 1977 in<br>
feeding experiments with rodents and poultry and is<br>
significantly above that of MHA (Baker and Harter,<br>
Proceedings for the Society for Experimental Biology<br>
and Medicine 1977, 156, 2001). In ruminants, a-keto-<br>
methionine and salts thereof, however, are broken down<br>
in the rumen and therefore offer no advantages over HMB<br>
or methionine. As free a-ketocarboxylic acid,<br>
a-ketomethionine in addition has the further<br>
disadvantage that it dimerizes in a very short time and<br>
subsequently irreversibly cyclizes and therefore is not<br>
stable as a monomer of biological value and therefore<br>
is avoided in direct use as feed additive.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
Against the background of the disadvantages of the<br>
prior art, it was the object to provide a rumen-stable,<br>
chemically protected methionine product for ruminants,<br>
in particular for dairy cows, which can serve as<br>
efficient methionine source for the animals and which<br>
does not have the disadvantages of the known products,<br>
or has them to a decreased extent. This would have the<br>
advantage that milk production and quality could be<br>
thereby increased, which would lead to a significant<br>
increase in economic efficiency.<br>
A further object was to find a feed and a feed additive<br>
of very high biological value which should have good<br>
handleability and storability and also stability under<br>
the customary conditions of compound feed processing,<br><br>
in particular pelleting. The product, in addition,<br>
should be useable in animal nutrition in the most<br>
general possible way as feed additive.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
This object and also other objects not explicitly-<br>
mentioned, but which can readily be derived or deduced<br>
from the contexts discussed herein are achieved by the<br>
ketomethionine ketals of the invention and derivatives<br>
thereof according to formula I, in particular use<br>
thereof as feed, preferably for ruminants. Thereby, not<br>
only the disadvantages of the "physically protected"<br>
methionine variants, such as, for example, Smartamine,<br>
but also the disadvantages of the "chemically<br>
protected" variants, such as, for example, HMBi, are<br>
overcome.<br>

are replaced by the two ketal-0 atoms,<br><br>
and R4 is a C3-C6-alkylene radical which, if<br>

and R5 is a C3-C6-alkylene radical which, if<br>
appropriate, is hydroxy substituted, preferably<br>
-CH2-CH(-) -CH2-, or a C3-C12 sugar radical in which two<br>

atoms, and wherein X = H or M and M has the meaning<br>
given above.<br>
Preference in this case is given to a compound of the<br>
formula 1,2, in which R = hydroxyl and R3 = C2H4<br><br>
This can readily be produced by ketalization of<br>
ketomethionine with stoichiometric amounts of ethylene<br>
glycol in the presence of acid catalysts or with super-<br>
stoichiometric amounts of ethylene glycol and<br>
subsequent saponification of the ketomethionine<br>
ethylene ketal ethylene glycol ester formed as an<br>
intermediate with alkali and subsequent neutralization<br>
(cf. Example 2).<br><br>
Further preference is given to a compound according to<br>
formula 1,2, in which R = OR' and R' = C1-C18-alkyloxy<br>
and R3 = C2H4. This compound can be produced by<br>
esterification of ketomethionine with a corresponding<br>
C1-C18-alcohol in the presence of acid catalysts, and<br>
preferably subsequent ketalization with ethylene<br>
glycol.<br>
Particular preference is given in this case to a<br>
compound according to formula 1,2, in which R' =<br>
C1-C4 - alkyloxy.<br>
Further preference is given to a compound according to<br>
formula 1,2, in which R = OR' and R' = hydroxyethoxy<br>
and R3 = C2H4:<br><br>
Still more preference is given to a compound according<br>
to formula 1,3, in which R* is a C5H10 radical or a<br>
C5H10O2 radical.<br>
Particular preference is given in this case to a<br>
compound characterized by the formula<br><br>
which can be produced from ketomethionine and<br>
neopentylidene glycol in the presence of acid<br>
catalysts.<br>
Likewise preference is given to an analogous compound<br>
of the formula<br><br><br>
which can be produced from ketomethionine and pent a-<br>
erythritol in the presence of acid catalysts.<br>
Further preference is given to a compound according to<br>
formula 1,4, in which R5 is a C3H5 radical.<br>
Particular preference is given in this case to a<br>
compound characterized by the formula (1,2-ketal)<br>
i <br>
Both compounds, the 1,2-ketal and the 1,3-ketal, can be<br>
produced from ketomethionine and glycerol in the<br>
presence of acid catalysts, preferably under<br>
dehydrating conditions.<br>
All compounds of the general formula I are<br>
outstandingly suitable according to the invention for<br>
use in animal nutrition, preferably for nutrition of<br>
farm animals.<br><br>
Preference is given in this case to use for nutrition<br>
of ruminants, in particular dairy cows.<br>
For this purpose, the compounds of the invention can be<br>
used for producing feeds.<br>
In this case, again preference is given to use for<br>
producing feeds for ruminants.<br>
Likewise, the present invention relates to feed<br>
preparations containing at least one of the<br>
abovementioned compounds of the invention, preferably<br>
for nutrition of ruminants.<br>
Accordingly, mixtures of the compounds of the invention<br>
with conventional feeds can be produced.<br>
For this, the compounds of the invention are mixed in<br>
suitable amounts into commercially conventional feed<br>
types, such as mineral feed, organic feed (for example<br>
soybean meal) or dairy compound feed.<br>
Suitable amounts are generally proportions of 0.1% to<br>
5% of methionine equivalents in the form of the<br>
compounds of the invention, wherein the proportions are<br>
different depending on the type of feed. Dairy compound<br>
feed is preferably mixed with 
equivalents, mineral feed with up to 5% and organic<br>
feed in the range from 0.5 to 3%, preferably up to 1%.<br>
One methionine equivalent in this context is the part<br>
by weight of compound of the invention which is<br>
equivalent to the same amount of methionine oh a molar<br>
basis.<br>
The present invention further relates to a process for<br>
producing carboxylic acid or ester compounds of the<br>
general formula I, 1-5, wherein, in the case of formula<br>
1,1 and 2 the radical is not OM, NH2, NHR' or NR'R",<br><br>
characterized in that ketomethionine is reacted with a<br>
corresponding monovalent, divalent, trivalent alcohol<br>
or a C3-C12 sugar in the presence of acid catalysts to<br>
give the ester product of the formulae 1-2, where R =<br>
0R#, or to give the ester product 3-4 or to give the<br>
acid product 1-2, where R = OH, or to give the acid<br>
product 5 where X = H.<br>
Corresponding to said preferred compounds, in this case<br>
one process is preferred in which, as alcohol, use is<br>
made of a branched or straight-chain C1-C18-alkyl<br>
alcohol or C3-C18-cycloalkyl alcohol, allyl alcohol,<br>
benzyl alcohol, phenyl alcohol, Ca-Cg-hydroxyalkyl<br>
alcohol, preferably HOC2H4OH, C3-C6-dihydroxyalkyl<br>
alcohol, preferably glycerol or a C3-C12 sugar,<br>
preferably glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, glucose,<br>
fructose or sucrose.<br>
In this case, in particular by suitable selection of<br>
the amount of mole equivalents of the alcohol or sugar<br>
required for the ketalization, the formation of the<br>
desired product can be influenced. When one mol<br>
equivalent of C1-C18-alkyl alcohol is used, the<br>
corresponding ester not according to the invention is<br>
preferentially formed, when two mol equivalents are<br>
used, the carboxylic acid ketal of the formula 1,1<br>
where R = OH is preferentially. formed and when three<br>
mol equivalents are used, the corresponding ester<br>
ketals of the formula 1,1 where R = OR' are<br>
preferentially formed. Correspondingly, when one half<br>
mol equivalent of C2-C6-hydroxyalkyl alcohol is used,<br>
(such as, for example, H0C2H40H) correspondingly two<br>
hydroxy equivalents of the corresponding carboxylic<br>
acid ketal of the formula 1,2 where R = OH and R3 = C2H4<br>
are formed.<br>
The production of carboxylic acid or ester compounds<br>
can advantageously be carried out in the presence of a<br><br>
solvent. Suitable solvents are, for example, aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as benzene or toluene, and also<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as methylene chloride or<br>
chloroform, and alcohols.<br>
In the interest of a yield as high as possible of<br>
desired condensation products, in this case preference<br>
is given to a process in which water formed during the<br>
reaction is removed from the equilibrium. This can be<br>
achieved both by distillation, preferably by using a<br>
solvent and/or entrainer such as, for example, toluene.<br>
It is advantageous in this case when the solvent<br>
simultaneously acts as entrainer and, if appropriate,<br>
further as reactant. Also, in this case, the alcohols<br>
used for esterification or ketalization can<br>
additionally be used as solvent and/or entrainer.<br>
When used as entrainer, the solvent should have a<br>
suitable boiling point. This should generally not<br>
exceed 120°C. Alcohols suitable for this purpose are,<br>
for example, Ci-C4-alkyl alcohols, that is to say<br>
methanol, ethanol, 1- or 2-propanol and 1- or<br>
2-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol.<br>
A further possibility for removing water is the use of<br>
dehydrating agents, for example orthoesters, such as,<br>
for example trimethyl or triethyl orthoacetate. The<br>
methyl or ethyl acetate formed as coupling products can<br>
subsequently readily be removed from the reaction<br>
mixture by distillation and reused.<br>
In this case the carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid<br>
salts of the general formula 1,1-2 or 5, in which the<br>
radical R = OH or OM and the radical X = H or M, can<br>
preferably be produced by converting a carboxylic ester<br>
product of the formula 1,1 or 2 where R = OR', or of<br>
the formula 1,4, into the corresponding carboxylic acid<br>
salt of the formula 1,1 or 2 where R = OM or of the<br><br>
formula 5 where X = M by saponification with an alkali<br>
metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or a<br>
monovalent or divalent transition metal hydroxide and,<br>
if appropriate, liberating therefrom the free<br>
carboxylic acid where R = OH or X = H with the aid of a<br>
mineral acid. Suitable mineral acids in this case are,<br>
in particular, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid and<br>
phosphoric acid.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for producing<br>
carboxylic acid salts of the general formula 1,1-2 or<br>
5, wherein the radical R = OM or' the radical X = M,<br>
which is characterized in that an acid product of the<br>
formula 1,1-2 where R = OH or an acid product of the<br>
formula 1,5 where X = H is neutralized with an alkali<br>
metal or alkaline earth metal or a monovalent or<br>
divalent transition metal hydroxide or carbonate to<br>
give the corresponding carboxylic acid.<br>
For production of the abovementioned carboxylic acid<br>
salts by saponification or neutralization, in this<br>
case, as hydroxides, use is preferably made of NaOH,<br>
KOH, Mg(OH)2, Ca(OH)2, Zn(OH)a or Mh(OH)a and, as<br>
carbonates, Na2CO3, K2CO3, MgCO3, CaCO3, ZnCO3 or MnCO3.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for producing<br>
carboxamides of the general formula 1,1-2 where R =<br>
NH2, NHR', NR'R", characterized in that an ester<br>
product of the formula 1,1-2, where R = OR', is<br>
converted into the corresponding amide by reaction with<br>
a nitrogenous base of the formula NH3, NH2R' or NHR'R".<br>
The invention also relates to a process for producing<br>
ester compounds of the general formula 1,1-2, where R =<br>
OR', which is characterized in that an ester product I,<br>
1-2, is converted into a corresponding ester product of<br>
the formula I, 1-2 by transesterification with an<br>
alkali metal alkoxide M'OR' (M' = alkali), with the<br><br>
proviso that R' in the ester product I, 1-2 used must<br>
not be equal to the radical R' in the alkoxide M'OR'<br>
used. Ketomethionine ketal esters once produced can in<br>
this manner be very readily converted into other<br>
desired ketomethionine ketal esters.<br>
The ketomethionine ketals of the general formula 1,1,2<br>
or 5 where R = OH or OM respectively, X = H or M are<br>
polar and non-lipophilic compounds. Owing to the ketal<br>
protecting group, these compounds are rumen-stable and<br>
cannot be microbially degraded. As a result of the<br>
lipophobic carboxylic acid group, however, they are not<br>
absorbed via the rumen wall as with HMBi, but pass<br>
without, breakdown into the abomasums of the ruminant,<br>
where they are hydrolysed owing to the strongly acidic<br>
conditions. The ketomethionine released is then<br>
subsequently absorbed in the small intestine.<br>
The ketomethionine ketal esters of the general formula<br>
1,1,2 where R = OR', or of the general formula 1,4 are<br>
lipophilic and non-polar compounds. Owing to the two<br>
chemical protecting groups "ketal" and "ester", these<br>
compounds are rumen-stable. The absorption, in contrast<br>
to ketomethionine ketals, proceeds rapidly and<br>
effectively via the rumen wall similarly to the<br>
mechanism of HMBi. The subsequent enzymatic cleavage to<br>
give the free ketomethionine then proceeds in the blood<br>
of the ruminant.<br>
The use of ketomethionine ketals or ketomethionine<br>
ketal esters thus makes possible for the first time an<br>
active control of the absorption site of the<br>
"methionine equivalent".<br>
The ketomethionine ketals or ketomethionine ketal<br>
esters and derivatives thereof have a plurality of<br>
advantages over the compounds known in the prior art:<br><br>
In contrast to free ketomethionine, ketomethionine<br>
ketals, ketomethionine ketal esters, ketomethionine<br>
hemiketal esters and ketomethionine ketal amides of the<br>
general formula I are chemically stable with respect to<br>
dimerization and cyclization, a precondition for<br>
storage and transport as feed additives.<br>
Use of the compounds of the general formula I permits<br>
the active control of the absorption site in the body<br>
of the ruminant. In this case the hydrophilic<br>
ketomethionine ketals of the formula 1,1,2 where R -<br>
OH, OM, or of the formula 1,5 where X = H, M are<br>
absorbed in the small intestine after hydrolysis in the<br>
abomasum, and the absorption of the lipophilic<br>
ketomethionine ketal esters of the general formula<br>
1,1,2 where R = OR', or of the general formula 1,4<br>
proceeds directly via the rumen wall.<br>
In the case of use of certain diols such as, for<br>
example ethylene glycol, or selected triols such as,<br>
for example, glycerol, or sugars such as, for example,<br>
glucose, as building blocks for ketal or ester<br>
formation with ketomethionine to give the corresponding<br>
compounds of the general formula I, these additionally<br>
have a nutritive action, owing to the sugar or alcohol<br>
building blocks which can be released again in the<br>
body.<br>
Ketomethionine ketals and ketomethionine ketal esters<br>
have a very high biological value, since they can be<br>
hydrolysed in vivo to give a-ketomethionine. The<br>
biological value of ketomethionine in this case is<br>
significantly higher than that of MHA, since, in<br>
contrast thereto, it can be converted to L-methionine<br>
in the body in only one stage. In contrast, MHA<br>
requires two stages and HMBi even three stages.<br><br>
The high biological value of ketomethionine ketals and<br>
ketomethionine ketal esters is a significant economic<br>
advantage, since less feed additive is required.<br>
On account of the chemical protection, the product and<br>
with it the rumen protection can not be damaged by<br>
physical forces such as, for example, friction.<br>
Therefore, in comparison with a physically protected<br>
methionine form, such as, for example Smartamine, it is<br>
possible to pellet ketomethionine ketals,<br>
ketomethionine ketal esters, ketomethionine hemiketal<br>
esters and ketomethionine ketal amides of the general<br>
formula I. This is an extraordinary advantage, because<br>
a broad usability in compound feed production and final<br>
processing is thereby ensured.<br>
In addition, the said compounds of the general formula<br>
I can generally be used as feed additives in farm<br>
animal husbandry, that is to say also in the nutrition<br>
of poultry or pigs.<br>
In particular, ketomethionine ketals and ketomethionine<br>
ketal esters can be produced in a simpler manner, and<br>
thus generally at lower production costs, than<br>
physically protected methionine forms.<br>
The symmetrical ketomethionine ketals of the general<br>
formula I are achiral in contrast to MHA, HMBi or<br>
D,L-methionine. Natural L-methionine is formed directly<br>
from these achiral precursors in the animal body.<br>
Conversion of the unnatural enantiomer is omitted<br>
thereby. The examples hereinafter show possibilities<br>
for producing the compounds according to the invention<br>
without acting in a limiting manner in this case.<br><br>
