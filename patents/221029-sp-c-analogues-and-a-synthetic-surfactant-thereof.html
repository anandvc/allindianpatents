"SP-C ANALOGUES AND A SYNTHETIC SURFACTANT THEREOF"<br>
CHIESI FARMACEUTICI S.P.A., an Italian company of Via Palermo, 26/A, I-43100 Parma, Italy<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   invention   and   the mariner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention provides new artificial peptides having surface activity. In particular, the invention provides SP-C analo¬gues which, once combined with suitable lipids, are particularly effective in reducing surface tension at the air-liquid interface.<br>
Thus, the peptides of the invention may be used in "combination with lipids, and optionally in combination with SP-B or an active analogue thereof or a substitute of SP-B, for preparing . artificial surfactants useful in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), other surfactant deficiencies or dysfunction, related pulmonary diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, meconium aspiration syndrome and also other diseases such as serous otitis media (glue ear).<br>
Background of the invention Pulmonary  surfactant reduces  surface  tension   at  the  air-liquid interface    of   the    alveolar   lining,    preventing    the    lungs    from collapsing at end expiration. Surfactant deficiency is a common disorder   in   premature   infants   and   causes   respiratory   distress syndrome   (RDS),  which   can  be  effectively  treated  with  natural surfactants    extracted    from    animal    lungs    (Fujiwara,    T.    and Robertson  B.   (1992)  In:   Robertson,   B.,  van  Golde,   L.M.G.   and Batenburg, B. (eds) Pulmonary Surfactant: From Molecular Biology to Clinical Practice Amsterdam, Elsevier, pp. 561-592). The main constituents   of these  surfactant preparations   are  phospholipids such     as      l,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine     (DPPC),<br><br><br>
phosphatidylgly-cerol (PG) and the hydrophobic surfactant proteins B and C (SP-B and SP-C). The hydrophilic surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D which are C-type (Ca2+-dependent) collagenous lectins and thought to act primarily in the host-defence system, are normally not included in the surfactant preparations due to the organic solvent extraction procedures employed.<br>
SP-B and SP-C constitute only about 1-2 % of the surfactant mass,  but are  still  able  to  exercise   dramatic  improvements "on surface activity, compared to pure lipid preparations (Curstedt, T. et   al.   (1987)   Eur.   J.   Biochem.   168.   255-262;   Takahashi,   A., Nemoto, T. and Fujiwara, T. (1994) Acta Paediatr. Jap. 36, 613-618). The primary and secondary structures of SP-B and SP-C and a tertiary structure of SP-C in solution have been determined (see 4).  SP-B is composed of two identical polypeptide chains  of 79 amino   acids,   connected   with   an   interchain   disulphide   bridge (Curstedt, T. et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 2985-2989;   Johansson,   J.,    Curstedt,   T.    and   Jornvall,    H.    (1991) Biochemistry 30,  6917-6921).  Each  monomeric  chain  has  three intrachain   disulphide   bridges   and   at   least   four   amphipathic helices exhibiting one polar and one unpolar face through which SP-B may interact with two lipid bilayers and bring them into close proximity (Andersson, M. et al. (1995) FEBS Lett. 362,  328-332). SP-C is a lipoprotein composed of 35 amino acid residues with an a-helical   domain   between   residues   9-34   (Johansson,   J.   et   al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 6015-6023). The helix is composed mostly of valyl-residues and is embedded in a lipid bilayer and oriented in parallel with the lipid acyl chains (Vandenbussche, et al.   (1992)<br><br><br>
Eur. J. Biochem. 203, 201-209). Two palmitoyl groups are covalently linked to cysteine residues in positions 5 and 6 in the N-terminal part of the peptide (Curstedt T. et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 2985-2989). The two conserved positively charged residues, arginine and lysine, at positions 11 and 12, possibly interact with the negatively charged head groups of the lipid membrane, thus increasing its rigidity. The rigidity of the lipid-peptide interaction may be decreased towards the C-terminal end, since it contains small or hydrophobic residues only, making this part potentially more mobile in a phospholipid bilayer. SP-C is thought to influence the thickness and fluidity of the surrounding lipids via the extremely stable poly-valyl helix (Johansson, J. and Curstedt, T. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 244, 675-693)<br>
State of the art Since surfactant preparations obtained from animal tissue present some drawbacks, like their availability in limited amounts and the possibilities that they contain infectious agents and induce immunological reactions, attempts have been made to create artificial surfactants (Johansson, J. and Curstedt, T. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 244, 675-693; Johansson, J. et al. (1996) Acta Paediatr. 85, 642-646), usually from synthetic lipids and hydrophobic proteins.<br>
Previous work has demonstrated that synthetic SP-C may not fold like the native peptide into an a-helical conformation necessary for optimal surface activity (Johansson, J.,et al. (1995) Biochem. J. 307, 535-541), and therefore do not interact properly with the surfactant lipids.<br>
Consequently, synthetic SP-C analogues do not fold like the<br><br>
native peptide and do rat interact properly with the surfactant lipids.  To  circumvent this problem,   several  attempts have been made to modify the sequence for instance by replacing all helical Val residues in native SP-C with Leu, which  strongly favour α-helical     conformation,    the     corresponding     transmembranous analogue,   SP-C(Leu)   showed   good   spreading   at   an   air-liquid interface  when   combined with  DPPC:PG:PA   (68:22:9)   (w/w/w). However, the maximum surface tension value during cyclic surface compression  (Ymax)  was significantly higher than that of native surfactant. It was furthermore not possible to prepare lipid-peptide mixtures of higher concentrations than about 20 mg/ml, probably due to  formation of peptide oligomers  (Nilsson,  G.  et al.  (1998) Eur. J. Biochem. 255, 116-124). Others have synthesised bioactive polyleucine SP-C  analogues of different lengths  (Takei, T.  et al. (1996)   Biol.  Pharm.  Bull.  19,   1550-1555).  In  the latter studies neither self oligomerisation nor problems in producing samples of high lipid concentration were reported.<br>
Different publications deal with the problem of providing peptidic analogues of natural surfactant peptides, giving a number of different solutions. Among those publications, W093 21225, EP 733 645, W096 17872, in the name of Tokyo Tanabe, disclose peptides analogues of natural SP-C, which in general differ from the native peptide regarding   the sequence of the N-terminal part.<br>
Scripps Research Institute patent applications W089 06657 and W092 22315 disclose SP-B analogues having alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues. Among others, a peptide alternating Leucine and lysine residues (KL4) is claimed.<br>
Clercx A. et al., Eur. J. Biochem 229, 465-72, 1995, disclose<br><br>
peptides of different lengths corresponding to the N-terminal of porcine SP-C and hybrid peptides derived from porcine SP-C and bacteriorhodopsin.<br>
Johansson J. et al., Biochem. J. 307, 535:41, 1995, disclose synthetic peptides that differ from the native porcine SP-C by the substitution of some amino acids.<br>
W089/ 04326 in the name of California Biotechnology - Byk Gulden, and W091/18015 in the name of California Biotechnology - Scios Nova, disclose SP-C analogues containing an initial N-terminal sequence in which the two Cys of natural SP-C are replaced by two Ser.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
It has now been found that SP-C analogue peptides which combine the following features: i) substitution of Val residues with other neutral and hydrophobic residues; ii) substitution of Cys residues with Ser residues; iii) replacement of some of the neutral amino acid residues with bulky or polar residues, show particularly favourable properties for surface tension reduction. In particular it has been found that the latter feature, in virtue of the positive charges conferred by the polar residues or the steric hindrance conferred by the bulky substituents, allow to avoid self-oligomerisation.<br>
As follows, according to a first aspect, the invention provides SP-C analogues having the following general formula (1), using the one-Jetter amino acid code:<br>

(XaB)n(XbB)n(XcB)mXd is a sequence having a maximum of 22 amino acids, preferably from 10 to 22.<br>
Preferred peptides of Formula (I) have the following sequences:<br>
(la) FGIPSSPVHLKRX4BX4BX4BXGALLMGL<br>
(lb) FGIPSSPVHLKRX5BX5BX4GALLMGL<br>
(Ic) FGIPSSPVHLKRX4BX11GALLMGL<br>
(Id) FGIPSSPVHLKRX8BX7GALLMGL<br>
(le) FGIPSSPVHLKRX11BX4GALLMGL<br>
Among the sequences (la) - (le), those having B = Lys or Phe and X = Leu, IIe or Nle are preferred.<br><br><br>
According to preferred embodiments, peptides of formula (la) -(If) have the following sequences, respectively:<br>
FGIPSSPVHLKRLLILKLLLLKILLLKLGALLMGL [SP-C (LKS)] FGIPSSPVHLKRLLILLKLLLLIKLLILGALLMGL [SP-C (LKS1] FGIPSSPVHLKRLLILKLLLLLILLLILGALLMGL [SP-C (LKS)2] FGIPSSPVHLKRLL1LLLLLKLILLLILGALLMGL [SP-C (LKS)3) FGIPSSPVHLKRLLILLLLLLLIKLLILGALLMGL [SP-C (LKS)4] FGIPSSPVHLKRLLILFLLLLFILLLFLGALLMGL [SP-C (LFS)] In  a more  preferred embodiment  of the  invention,   the  Ser residues are covalently linked with acyl groups containing 12-22 carbon atoms.<br>
Peptides of formula (I) may be prepared by synthetic methods or recombinant techniques.<br>
Conventional synthetic methods are described, for instance, in Schroeder et al., "The peptides", vol. 1, Academic Press, 1965; Bodanszky et al., "Peptide synthesis", Interscience Publisher, 1996; Baramy &amp; Merrifield, "The peptides; Analysis, Synthesis, Biology", vol. 2, chapter 1, Academic Press, 1980. Said techniques include peptide synthesis in solid phase, in solution, organic chemistry synthetic methods, or any combination thereof.<br>
S- or O- acylated peptides are preferably synthesized by treatment of the non-acylated peptides with acyl chloride in neat trifluoroacetic acid as described in Yousefi-Salakdeh et al. Biochem J 1999, 343, 557-562. After synthesis and purification, the synthetic peptides were biochemically and biophysically characterised, as reported in the following section "Examples".<br>
The activity of the peptides of the invention in reducing surface tension has been evaluated in combination with lipids and<br><br>
phospholipids, SP-B, analogues of SP-B or substitutes of SP-B. In particular, the peptides have been combined with DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)/PG (phosphatidylglyce-rol)/PA (palmitic acid) with or without SP-B, an active analogue thereof and polymyxins.<br>
The results of pulsating-bubble surface activity tests clearly show that the synthetic peptides according to the present invention strongly decrease minimum and maximum surface tension during cyclic surface compression (γmin and γmax ) to values comparable with those obtained using surfactants from natural sources.<br>
The addition of SP-B or active analogue thereof to the mixture peptide/lipids-phospholipids gave particularly favourable results. Furthermore it has been surprisingly found that polymyxins, in particular polymyxin B, act as substituents of SP-B and their addition gave comparable results to those achieved with SP-B.<br>
According to a second aspect, the invention provides a synthetic surfactant comprising one or more peptides of formula (I), in admixture with lipids and/or phospholipids and optionally SP-B, an active derivative thereof or polymyxins. Suitable lipids/phospholipids may be selected from the group consisting of phosphatidylcholines (preferably DPPC) PG, PA, triacylglycerols, sphingomyelin.<br>
In an even more preferred embodiment of the invention, surfactant mixtures containing the peptide in which palmitoyl chains are O-covalently linked to the Ser residues should be used. It has been found that surfactant mixtures containing a dipalmitoylated form of the reference peptide (SP-C(Leu))  exhibit<br><br>
higher surface film stability and increased size of the surface-associated lipid reservoir, compared to mixtures containing the corresponding non-palmitoylated peptide, as measured by captive bubble system. In the samples containing 5% of dipalmitoylated peptide, the γmin was below 1.5 mN/m and the films very stable, as the surface tension increased by less than 0.5 mN/m within 10 min at constant bubble volume. On the contrary, the γmin for the non-palmitoylated peptide was approx. 5 mN/m and the films were less stable as observed by frequent bubble clicking at low surface tensions. Moreover, after subphase depletion for samples that contain non-palmitoylated peptide, the ability to reach near zero stable surface tension was lost after a few adsorption steps, whereas with the dipalmitoylated peptide the film quality did not deteriorate even after more than 10 expansion steps and the incorporation of reservoir material equivalent to more than two monolayers. The improved surface activity of dipalmitoylated peptides was also demonstrated by pulsating bubble surfactometer. In addition, the presence of acyl groups was found to further reduce the tendency to form oligomers. This finding is very important, as during preparation of artificial surfactants, peptide oligomerisation has been found to hinder preparation of the mixtures at higher concentrations than 20 mg/ml (Nilsson et al. Eur J Biochem 1998, 255, 116-124).<br>
The synthetic surfactant may be prepared by mixing solutions or suspensions of peptides and lipids and by subsequently drying the mixture.<br>
At the occurrence, the dry mixture may be suspended, dispersed or administered as such to subjects in need of treatment<br><br><br>
for surfactant deficiency.<br>
The synthetic surfactant will be preferably administered endotracheally or via aerosol. The latter form of administration will require the combination of small particles of surfactant with suitable inert propellant. Other forms of administration, like nebulization or spraying of stable solutions/suspensions of surfactant are also included within the scope of the invention.<br>
According to a further aspect, the invention provides the use of the described peptides for the preparation of a surfactant agent to be used in all cases of adult or neonatal surfactant deficiency or dysfunction, related pulmonary diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, meconium aspiration syndrome and also other diseases such as serous otitis media (glue ear).<br>
Typically, the surfactant agent will be used, preferably upon endotracheal administration, in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome which frequently affects premature infants.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention in more details.<br>
Example 1<br>
Peptide synthesis and purification<br>
An analogue of SP-C, SP-C(LKS) (Fig. 1) was synthesised by use of stepwise solid phase technology and the tert-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry (Kent, S.B.H. (1988) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 57, 957-989) in an Applied Biosystems 430A instrument. Cleavage of the resin-peptide bond and deprotection of the side-chains were carried out in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride/metoxybenzene/dimethylsulfide, 10:1:1 (v/v/v) for 1.5 h at   0°C.    Protecting   groups   and   scavengers   were   removed   by<br><br><br>
repeated   extraction   with   diethyl   ether   and   the   peptide   was<br>
subsequently	extracted	from	the	resin	by<br>
dichloromethane/trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) 3:1 (v/v) followed by rotary evaporation. The crude peptide extract was redissolved at a concentration of 100 mg/ml in chloroform/methanol 1:1 (v/v) containing 5% H2O. An aliquot of 10 rag was applied on a Sephadex LH-60 column (40 x 1 cm) in the same solvent (Curstedt, T. et al. (1987) Eur. J. Biochem. 168, 255-262). Fractions of 2.5 ml were collected and absorbencies at 214 and 280 nm were measured. Identification and quantitation were performed by amino acid analysis.<br>
For acylation, the purified peptide (typically about 5 mg) is dried, dissolved in distilled TFA (100 μ1) and acyl chloride (10-20 equivalents compared to peptide) is added. After 10 minutes the reaction is quenched with 80% aqueous ethanol (1.9 ml). Purification of acyl peptides is performed using chromatography over Lipidex 5000 in ethylene chloride/methanol 1:4 (v/v) followed by reversed-phase HPLC over a C18 column using a linear gradient of 2-propanol/0.1% TFA running into 60% (aqueous) methanol/0.1% TFA or 75% (aqueous) ethanol/0.1% TFA.<br>
Example 2<br>
Biochemical characterisation<br>
The purity of the peptide was checked by sodium-dodecylsulphate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Phast-system, Pharmacia, Sweden) and by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using a C18 lumn and a linear gradient of 60 % aqueous methanol /0.1 % TFA and isopropanol/ 0.1 % TFA (Gustafsson, M. et al. (1997) Biochem. J.<br><br><br>
326, 799-806).<br>
Molecular masses were determined by matrix-assisted laser<br>
desorption	ionisation-time-of-flight	(MALDI-TOF)	mass<br>
spectrometry   (Lasermat   2000,   Finnigan   MAT)   calibrated   with vasoactive intestinal peptide (Mr 3326.8).<br>
Peptide secondary structure was investigated using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Jasco-720 Jasco, Japan). After solubilisation with triflouroethanol (TFE) spectra were recorded from 260 to 184 nm with a scan speed of 20 nm/min and a resolution of 2 data points/nm. The residual molar ellipticy was calculated and expressed in kdeg x cm2/dmol. Molar ellipticities at 208 and 222 nm were utilised for estimating the content of helical structure (Barrow, C.J. et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 225, 1075-1093).<br>
Secondary structure investigations of SP-C(LKS) using CD spectroscopy showed a spectrum typical for cc-helical peptides and an cc-helical content of approximately 75 % was estimated from the 208 nm and 222 nm minima. The secondary structure remained stable following stepwise dilution with H2O until 12 % TFE provided that the peptide was solubilized in neat TFE.<br>
SDS-PAGE of SP-C(LKS) showed a single band similar to native SP-C while SP-C(Leu) which lacks Lys in the helical part forms oligomers. In contrast to our experience with SP-C(Leu)/lipid mixtures, which are difficult to solubilize in higher concentrations than 20 mg/ml (Nilsson, G. et al. (1998) Eur. J. Biochem. 255, 116-124.), it was possible to make a SP-C(LKS)/lipid mixture with a lipid concentration of 80 mg/ml and a polypeptide/lipid ratio of 0.03.<br><br><br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of peptide/lipid mixtures<br>
DPPC, PG and PA were all purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO). The lipids, dissolved in chloroform/methanol 98:2 (v/v), were mixed in the proportions DPPC:PG:PA 68:22:9 (w/w/w) or DPPC/PG 7:3 {w/w). Surfactant preparations were prepared by adding SP-C(LKS) alone or SP-C(LKS) and SP-B, to each of the lipid mixtures, at total polypeptide/lipid weight ratios of 0-0.05. The mixtures were evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended in 150 mmol/1 NaCl or in 10 mmol/1 Hepes buffer pH 6,9 containing 140 mmol/1 NaCl and 2.0 mmol/1 CaCl2, at lipid concentrations of 10 — 80 mg/ml. Repeated freezing and sonication (50 W, 48 kHz) were performed until homogeneous suspensions were achieved. In some cases the final suspensions were incubated at 45°C for 1 h.<br>
Surfactant preparations suspended in 150 mmol/1 NaCl have a pH of 3.5-5.5. The lower pH-values  3.5-4.5 were  observed  in preparations containing SP-B. Since native SP-B is purified using acidified   organic   solvents   (Curstedt,   T.   et   al.   (1987)   Eur.   J. Biochem. 168, 255-262) small amounts of acid may remain in the preparations. Near physiological pH was obtained by suspending the surfactant preparation in Hepes buffer pH 6.9, containing 140 mmol/1 NaCl and  2  mmol/1  CaCl2  (Table   1).   Compared  to  the corresponding  preparations  in  unbuffered   saline   there  were   no changes of γmax or γmin when DPPC/PG 7:3 (w/w) was used as the lipid mixture. However when PA was included in the lipid mixture both γmax and γmin   increased at the higher pH (Tables 1 and 2).<br><br><br>

Preparation of phospholipid mixtures with SP-C(LKS) and polymyxin B.<br>
DPPC and PG were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co (St Louis, MO). The phospholipids, dissolved in chloroform/methanol 98:2 (v/v), were mixed in the proportions DPPC/PG 7:3 (w/w). SP-C (LKS) was added to the phospholipid mixtures, at a total polypeptide/phospholipid weight ratio of 0.03. The mixtures were evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended at room temperature in 10 mmol/1 Hepes buffer pH 6,9 containing 140 mmol/1 NaCl and 2.0 mmol/1 CaCl2 or in the same buffer containing 0.01% polymyxin B (PxB) (Sigma Chemical Co, St Louis, MO). Repeated freezing and sonication (50 W, 48 kHz) were performed until homogeneous suspensions were achieved. The final phospholipid concentration for both preparations was 10 mg/ml. Addition of PxB decreased both γmin and γmax and optimal surface activity was obtained (Table 3).<br><br><br><br><br>

The recordings were obtained at different periods of time with a pulsating bubble surfactometer at<br>
37°C and 50% surface compression at a rate of 40 cycles per min. The values are the mean (SD) of 5-11<br>
measurements. Abbreviations are defined in the text.<br><br><br>
Example 5<br>
Biophysical characterisation<br>
Surface spreading kinetics were measured at about 21 11 °C with a Wilhelmy surface balance (Biegler, Vienna, Austria). Surface tension was monitored for 10 min using a platinium plate connected to a strain gauge and inserted 1 mm in to a hypophase of 20 ml of 150 mmol/1 NaCl in a teflon trough. The suspensions were added as droplets, totally 1 mg of lipids, onto the hypophase, 4 cm from the platinium plate.<br>
Kinetic measurements of 3 weight % SP-C(LKS) in DPPC/PG, 7:3 (w/w), using the Wilhelmy balance showed a rapid spreading with a surface tension of 28 mN/m after 3 s (Fig. 2). The spreading was somewhat slower using 1 weight % SP-C(LKS) in the same lipid mixture (data not shown). Addition of 2 weight % SP-B did not significantly change spreading velocity or equilibrium surface tension (Fig. 2). No improvements were observed after incubation of the mixture for 1 h at 45°C (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with DPPC:PG:PA, 68:22:9 (w/w/w) as the lipid mixture (data not shown).<br>
Dynamic surface tension was recorded using a pulsating bubble surfactometer (Surfactometer International, Toronto, Canada) at 37°C during 50 % cyclic compression of the bubble surface and at a frequency of 40 cycles per min. All measurements were performed for 5 min and at a lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml. The pressure gradiens across the bubble wall were measured at specific time intervals were measured and used to calculate surface tensions at minimum (γmin) and maximum (γmax) bubble size.<br><br><br>
In the pulsating bubble surfactometer 3 weight % SP-C(LKS) in DPPC:PG:PA, 68:22:9 (w/w/w,) produced a surface tension of less than 1 mN/m at minimum bubble radius (γmin) while a γmin of 9-14 mN/m was observed with 3 weight % SP-C(LKS) in DPPC:PG, 7:3 (w/w) (Table 1). The surface tension at maximum bubble radius (γmax) was about 40 mN/m in both cases. Addition of 2 weight % SP-B gave γmax-values of 31-33 mN/m and γmin of 0-2 mN/m for both lipid preparations. These values are very similar to those obtained with surfactant preparations isolated from natural sources (Robertson, B. et al. (1990) Prog. Respir. Res. 25, 237-246). Incubation of the preparations at 45°C for 1 h had no significant effect on surface activity (Table 1). Decreasing the amount of SP-B to 0.5 weight % in 3 weight % SP-C(LKS) in DPPC:PG 7:3 (w/w) tended to increase γmin although the results did not reach statistical significance (Table 1). In contrast to SP-B, addition of 2 weight % KL4 (Cochrane, C.G. and Revak, S.D. (1991) Science 254, 566-568) to 3 weight % SP-C(LKS) in DPPC:PG:PA 68:22:9 (w/w) did not reduce γmax which remained relatively high at 41-42 mN/m.<br>
Example 6<br>
Comparison between mixtures containing dipalmitoylated and non-palmitoylated reference peptides<br>
Surfactant preparations were prepared by adding 3% w/w SP-C(Leu) or dipalmitoylated SP-C(Leu) to each lipid mixtures, made of DPPC/PG/PA 68:22:9 w/w/w. The mixtures were evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended in 150 mmol/1 NaCl at lipid concentrations of 10 mg/ml. In the samples in which a SP-B substituent was also used, 1% w/w of polymyxin B was added.<br><br>
Mixtures containing dipalmitoylated SP-C(Leu), with or v/ithout polymyxin B, exhibit significant improvement especially in reducing γmax at 5 min and γmin at earlier time intervals.<br>
Table 4: Surface properties<br>
Surface tension of the mixtures was obtained with a pulsating bubble surfactometer. After two minutes of equilibration, the recordings were obtained at different periods, at 37° C, 50% surface compression and at a rate of 40 cycles per min.<br><br><br><br><br>
Example 7<br>
In vivo determination<br>
The effect of surfactant therapy on the mechanical properties of immature lungs was evaluated in 9 preterm newborn rabbits with a gestational age of 27 days. The animals were tracheotomized at birth and five of them received, via the tracheal cannula, twice 2.5 ml/kg of artificial surfactant containing DPPC, PG, and SP-C (LKS), with or without polymyxin B, in the proportions given above. Total phospholipid concentration of the<br><br>
exogenous surfactant material was 40 mg/ml. Two animals serving as negative control received no material via the tracheal tube, and another two serving as positive control were treated with the same dose of modified natural surfactant (Curosurf, Chiesi Farmaceutici Spa, Parma, Italy), diluted to 40 mg/ml. One animal was treated with a mixture of DPPC and PG in saline (same concentrations as above) at a dose of 2.5 ml/kg. All animals were kept in body plethysmograph boxes at a temperature of 37°C and ventilated in parallel for 60 min with 100% oxygen, using a Servo Ventilator 900B (Siemens-Elema, Solna, Sweden) set at a frequency of 40 min and 50% inspiration time. Tidal volumes were measured with a pneumotachygraph connected to each plethysmograph box. The animals were ventilated with a standardized tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg and without a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Lung-thorax compliance was defined as the ratio between tidal volume and peak inspiratory pressure, and expressed as ml/cm H2O kg.<br>
In comparison with the non-treated control animal, compliance was improved significantly in animals treated with the artificial surfactant, especially in the animal receiving surfactant containing polymyxin B. Notably, the improvement appears to be superior to that seen after treatment with a similar dose of modified natural surfactant (Fig. 3).<br>
Brief description of figures. Fig. 1.     Amino acid sequences and helical wheel presentations of SP-C and its analogues.<br>
The sequence of human SP-C is taken from Johansson, J. et al.   (1988)  FEBS  Lett. 232,  61-64     and  that of SP-C(Leu)   from<br><br>
Nilsson, G., et al. (1998) Eur. J. Biochem. 255, 116-124). SP-C(LKS) is based on the primary structure of SP-C but all Val residues at the positions 16-28 with the exception of position 17 are replaced with Leu residues, Lys residues have been introduced at positions 17,22 and 27, and the palmitoylated Cys at positions 5 and 6 are replaced with Ser.<br>

Spreading kinetics of 3 weight % SP-C(LKS) (filled squares, solid line) and of 3 weight % SP-C(LKS) with addition of 2 weight % SP-B (open triangles, dotted line). All preparations were examined at a concentration of 10 mg /ml of DPPC/PG, 7:3 (w/w) in 150 mmol/1 NaCl. The recordings were obtained with a Wilhelmy balance and each datapoint is the mean of three different recordings. Fig. 3      In vivo results<br>
Lung-thorax compliance in 5 premature newborn rabbits (gestational age of 27 days) ventilated with a standardized tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg and without a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Compliance is improved significantly in treated animals. Addition of polymyxin B (PxB) appears to increase the effect of the artificial surfactant. The concentration of phospholipids is the same in all surfactant preparations, i.e. 40 mg/ml.<br><br><br>
