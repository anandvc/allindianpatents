The invention relates to a spinning frame according to the preamble of the independent claim.<br>
From the German patent 882 967 a spinning frame is known which is being divided into numerous sections, wherein all longitudinal parts of the frame are of such a design that they do not exceed a maximum length corresponding to the largest dimension of one of the frame sections. For practical reasons such a frame is brought to the spinning mill being partially pre-assembled so that the final erection can be carried out with less effort. In order to achieve this, for instance every second frame section can be assembled more or less completely, while the intermediate frame sections are being dispatched as single components. During final erection of the spinning frame they are mounted between the already completed frame sections, so that a long spinning frame, which is also called a long frame machine, results.<br>
It has been experienced that a spinning frame being manufactured in such a manner, develops vibration during operation. Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to create a spinning frame of the stated art, whereat the mentioned disadvantages are being avoided.<br>
This task is solved by a spinning frame with the features of the claims.<br>
The task is solved, in that within some frame sections in addition to the bearing points at each end of the shaft sections, sub-bearings are being provided for said shaft sections.<br>
A spinning frame with a long drive shaft manufactured according to the invention, and being divided into several frame sections and shaft sections, comprises some shaft sections which are being supported at their ends and other shaft sections which are being provided with a sub-bearing between their ends. For transportation, some<br><br>
frame sections are pre-assembled, whereat the pertaining shaft sections are being supported at their ends within the respective machine frame, and whereat further, not pre-assembled frame sections serve to connect the first frame sections at their final place of destination and whereat each of said further frame sections is being provided with a shaft section, which is being supported by a sub-bearing. The sub-bearing is fastened at a support on the longitudinal parts between the ends of the respective frame section. The bearing support for the sub-bearing is preferably mountable at right angle to the longitudinal direction of a frame section. The shaft sections of the finally assembled frame sections are being connected by couplings. Preferably the shaft sections in each 1st, 3rd, 5th etc. frame section are being supported at two places, and the shaft sections of the 2nd, 4th etc. frame section are being provided with only one sub-bearing and at their ends they are only supported by couplings, which are provided at the ends of the neighbouring shaft sections. The couplings connect the shaft sections rigidly and coaxial. The frame sections are preferably built-up by longitudinal and transverse components, however, they may also consist of a support structure using only longitudinal parts, which are being connected to each other. The shaft sections are preferably being supported in traverses, for instance frame wails or plates. The supports or traverse parts, which serve to carry the sub-bearings, connect the longitudinal parts of a frame section in a stabilising manner. It has been found advantageous to manufacture the support for the sub-bearing as a simple plate-shaped structural part. In order to keep the bending vibration of the long combined shafts in the spinning frame at an acceptable level, it is sufficient if some of the shaft sections, for instance those of the 1st, 3rd, 5th frame section, are only being supported by bearings at their ends, and that the shaft sections of the frame sections that are positioned in-between, that is the 2nd, 4th, 6th etc., besides the sub-bearing, are supported at their ends by couplings only, which are connected with the ends of their neighbouring shaft sections. The couplings are preferably arranged within the immediate vicinity of a shaft bearing of a 1st, 3rd, 5th frame section.<br><br>
Already the application of small dimensioned supports for the sub-bearings can kee the frame vibration within the acceptable level.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning frame with a long drive shaft<br>
divided into several frame sections and shaft sections, characterized in that some shaft<br>
sections are being supported at the ends and the other shaft section is being provided<br>
with a sub-bearing	between the ends.<br><br>
The figure shows only three of a greater number of frame sections 12a, 12c, 12b in a spinning frame 10 being arranged next to each other, wherein the outer frame sections 12a, 12b are independent sections and the frame section 12c which is being positioned in-between is only mounted after the two neighbouring frame sections 12a, 12b on the left and right side have been erected in alignment. According to the exemplified embodiment in the figure the frame section 12a consists of two traverses 18a and 18b and the longitudinal parts 16a and 14a, which connect said traverses. Furthermore a shaft section 26a with bearings 22a,22b is being shown in the frame section 12a. Accordingly the frame section 12b on the right hand side consists of traverses 18c and 18d and longitudinal parts 16b,14b which connect said traverses and also the shaft section 26b which are supported in bearings 22c,22d. The frame section 12c being positioned between said frame sections 12a, 12b preferably comprises several longitudinal parts 16c,14c, whereat said longitudinal parts 16c,14c are being coupled to the longitudinal parts 16a, 14a, 16b, 14b or traverses 18b, 18c of the respective neighbouring frame sections 12a, 12c. For the connection of these parts preferably screws, plates, angular brackets, bolts etc. are being used. To connect the shaft sections 26c,26c,26b with each other couplings 30 are being applied, of which only one is being shown between frame section 12b and 12c. The shaft section 26c of the frame section 12c positioned between the other frame sections 12a, 12b is accordingly connected with the neighbouring shaft sections 26a,26b with couplings 30. To stabilise said shaft section 26c a sub-bearing 24 is being arranged in concentric alignment with said shaft section 26c, whereat said sub-bearing is being positioned in a bearing support 30a and/or support 20. When manufacturing the support 20, the support bearing 30a respectively the fastening points for the pertaining frame section 12c do not need to be positioned within<br><br>
narrow tolerances, since the centring of the sub-bearing 24 and the bearing support    30a, the support 20 respectively, in relation to the shaft section 26c, only takes place when the shaft sections 26a,26c,26b are coupled together. When erecting the frame section 12c, at first the shaft section 26c is rigidly connected with the shaft sections 26a,26b, while the screwed connection for the bearing support 30a, the support 20 respectively, is kept lose at first. When test running the drive shaft, that is the coupled shaft sections 26a,26c,26b, the sub-bearing 24 centres itself on the shaft section 26c with the bearing support 30a, the support 20 respectively. Thereafter the connections between the bearing support 30a, the support 20 respectively and the other parts of the pertaining frame section 12c, that is for instance with the longitudinal part 16c and/or 14c can finally be tightened.<br>
An industrially used spinning frame, a ring spinning frame in particular, normally does not consist of only three frame sections 12a, 12c, 12b as is shown, but of a larger number of frame sections, so that a spinning frame in the case of a ring spinning frame can comprise over 1000 operating units. One frame section 12a alternates with a frame section 12c, that is one autonomous more or less completely assembled frame section with one frame section which is being formed of single parts during final erection.<br><br><br>
