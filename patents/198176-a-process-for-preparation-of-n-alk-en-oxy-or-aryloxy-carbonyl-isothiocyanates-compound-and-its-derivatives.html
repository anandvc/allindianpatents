COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10] RULE 12<br>
"PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF N-ALK[EN]OXY [OR ARYLOXY] CARBONYL ISOTHIOCYANATES COMPOUND AND ITS DERIVATIVES.<br>
BAYER CORPORATION, of 100 Bayer Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15205, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD THE INVENTION<br>
The field of the present invention is a process for the preparation of n-alk(en)oxy(or aryloxy)carbonyl isothiocyanate compound and its derivatives and particularly to the manufacture of carbonyl isothiocyanates and their derivatives. More particularly, the present invention pertains to an improved process for preparing N-alk(en)oxy(or aryloxy)carbonyl isothiocyanates and their derivatives, wherein the improvement comprises the presence of a N,N-dialk(en)yl-arylamine as a catalyst in the reaction process.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Derivatives of carbonyl isothiocyanates are well known in the art, and various methods for their production are also known in the art. They can be used after further derivatization to prepare 5-alkoxy-substituted l,2,4-triazolinon-3-ones which are usable as intermediates in the commercial preparation of certain agrochemicals.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,659,853 discloses a process for producing derivatives of alkoxy, aryloxy and alkene isothiocyanates by reacting a haloformate, an alkali, alkaline earth metal, lead or ammonium thiocyanate and a compound having the formula R1-Y-H wherein R1 is an alkyl, aryl or alkoxy, Y is oxygen, sulfur or N-R2, and R2 is hydrogen or R1  in the presence of a solvent or water and a catalyst. Suitable catalysts include pyridine, quinoline, pyrimidine, pyrazine, quinoxaline and the like.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,778,921 describes a process for the preparation of alkoxy and aryloxy isothiocyanates which includes the reaction of a haloformate and an alkali or alkaline earth metal thiocyanate in the presence of water and a catalyst. The catalyst comprises  a six-  membered mononuclear or ten-membered  fused  polynuclear<br><br><br>
aromatic, heterocyclic compound having one or two nitrogen atoms as the only hetero atoms in the ring.<br>
U.S.  Patent  5,194,673  discloses a process  for producing  alkoxy and  aryloxy<br>
5	isothiocyanates by the reaction of a haloformate and an alkali or alkaline earth metal<br>
thiocyanate in the presence of water and a catalyst. A co-catalyst is also used in the process to accelerate the reaction rate, increase product purity, and reduce the adverse effects of impurities in the thiocyanate reactants.<br>
10	In the publication, Chem. Ber. 116, 2044, (1983), it is reported that the use of an<br>
aromatic heterocyclic nitrogen catalyst such as pyridine in carbon tetrachloride produced an alkoxythiocarbonyl isothiocyanate wherein the yield was only about 52%.<br>
15	The most prevalent prior art methods comprise (i) the formation of the carbonyl<br>
isothiocyanate, (ii) the recovery and purification thereof, and (iii) the final reaction thereof with the appropriate co-reactant to produce the desired derivative. However, the known methods result in carbonyl isothiocyanates of low yield and purity. Thus, there is a need in the art for a process to produce carbonyl isothiocyanates and their<br>
10	derivatives in high yield and purity.<br>

	The invention is further illustrated but is not intended to be limited by the following<br>
examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.<br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES Example 1 - Preparation of MTC, With Neutralization of the Catalyst<br>
	7.2 grams (0.06 mole) of 99% pure N,N-dimethylaniline was added to a solution of<br>
86.0 grams (1.04 moles) of 98% pure NaSCN, in 170.5 grams of water, and the mixture was cooled to a temperature of from about 0°C to about 5°C with stirring. About 95.5 grams (1.00 mole) of 99% pure methyl chloroformate was added to the stirred reaction mixture over a period of about 2 hours, maintaining the temperature<br>
	of the reaction mixture from about 0°C to about 5°C.  Following this addition step,<br>
the reaction mixture was stirred for about 1 hour. The reaction mixture was then chilled to a temperature of about 0°C. A chilled (about 0°C) solution of 6.18 grams (0.06 mole) of sulfuric acid was dissolved in 174 ml of water, and this solution was added to the reaction mixture (to neutralize the catalyst) over a time period of about<br>
	10 minutes. The mixture was then stirred at a temperature of about 0°C for about 15<br>
minutes. The stirring was then stopped and the mixture was allowed to settle for about 15 minutes at a temperature of about 0°C. The mixture separated into an queous phase and an organic phase. The desired N-methoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate product ("MITC") was contained within the organic phase.<br><br>
While maintaining the reaction mixture at a temperature of about 0°C, the lower<br>
organic layer (which included the intermediate MITC product) was slowly added to<br>
about 277.6 grams (8.68 moles) of methanol, over a time period of about 1 hour,<br>
while the temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained between about 30°C<br>
	and about 40°C.   The reaction mixture was then stirred at a temperature of from<br>
about 30°C to about 40°C for about 2 hours. The solvent-free purity of N-meth-oxycarbonyl-O-methylthionocarbamate ("MTC") in the reaction mixture at this point was 98.5% (no trace of the isomer MeOOC-SCN was observed using a liquid chromatograph).<br><br><br><br>
Analysis by liquid chromatography of the resulting solution of MTC in methanol resulted in a yield of 93.4% based on methyl chloroformate.<br>
Example 2 - Preparation of MTC; Without Neutralizing the Catalyst<br>
22.0 grams (0.18 mole) of 99% pure N,N-dimethylaniline was added to a solution of<br>
248.3	grams (3.00 moles) of 98% pure NaSCN, in 595.0 grams of water. The<br>
mixture was cooled to a temperature of between about 0°C and about 5°C with<br>
stirring. About 274.9 grams (2.88 moles) of 99% pure methyl chloroformate was<br>
added to the stirred reaction mixture over a time period of about 2 hours, maintaining<br>
the temperature of the reaction mixture between about 0°C and about 5°C.<br>
Following addition of the methyl chloroformate, the reaction mixture was then stirred<br>
at a temperature of between about 0°C and about 5°C for a period of about 1 hour.<br>
The stirring was then stopped and the phases were allowed to separate into an<br>
organic and an aqueous phase at a temperature of about 0°C, without prior neu¬<br>
tralization of the catalyst. The organic layer (containing the intermediate "MITC"<br>
product) was slowly added to 800.0 grams (25.0 moles) of methanol over a period of<br>
about 1 hour, while the temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained between<br>
about 30°C and about 40°C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at a temperature<br>
of from about 30°C to about 40°C for about 2 hours.<br>
Analysis by liquid chromatography of the resulting solution of N-methoxycarbonyl-O-methylthionocarbamate ("MTC") in methanol indicated a yield of 93% based on methyl chloroformate.<br>
Example 3 - Preparation of PTC; Without Neutralizing the Catalyst<br>
22.0 grams (0.18 mole) of 99% pure N,N-dimethylaniline was added to a solution of<br>
260.4	grams (3.15 moles) of 98% pure NaSCN, in 640.0 grams of water. The<br>
mixture was cooled to a temperature of between about 0°C and about 5°C with<br>
stirring.   376.8 grams (3.01 moles) of 98% pure propyl chloroformate was added to<br><br><br>
the stirred reaction mixture over a period of about 2 hours, maintaining the tem¬<br>
perature of the reaction mixture between about 0°C and about 5°C. Following ad¬<br>
dition of the propyl chloroformate, the reaction mixture was stirred at a temperature<br>
of between about 0°C and about 5°C for a period of about 4 hours. The stirring was<br>
then stopped and the phases were allowed to separate into an organic phase and an<br>
aqueous phase at a temperature of about 0°C, without prior neutralization of the<br>
catalyst. The desired N-propoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate product ("PITC") was<br>
contained within the organic phase. The organic layer (containing the intermediate<br>
PITC product) was slowly added to 540.0 grams (9.0 moles) of propanol over a<br>
	period of about 1 hour.   During this addition step, the temperature of the organic<br>
layer was maintained at about 0°C; while the temperature of the resultant reaction mixture was maintained between about 30°C and about 40°C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at a temperature of from about 30°C to about 40°C for about 2 hours.<br>
	Analysis by liquid chromatography of the resulting solution of N-propoxycarbonyl-<br>
O-propylthionocarbamate ("PTC") in propanol indicated a yield of 98% based on propyl chloroformate.<br>
Example 4<br>
2)<br>
8.3 grams (0.1 mole) of 98% pure sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN), 0.37 grams (0.003 mole) of the catalyst N,N-dimethylaniline, and 75 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) were charged to a reactor. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to a temperature of about 85°C. The reaction mixture was made anhydrous by azeotropic<br>
	distillation of a small amount of the solvent (about 20 ml) under a reduced pressure<br>
of about 200 mm of mercury. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. About 10.5 grams (0.11 mole) of 99% pure methyl chloroformate was added over a time period of about 30 minutes, maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture between about 25°C and about<br>
	40°C. The reaction mixture was then stirred for about 4 hours at room temperature to<br><br><br>
complete the formation of the intermediate N-methoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate ("MITC").<br>
To convert the MITC intermediate product to N-methoxycarbonyl-O-methyl thiono-carbamate ("MTC"), 6.4 grams (0.20 mole) of methanol was added to the reaction mixture over a time period of about 15 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was then stirred at a temperature of about 50°C for a time period of about 4 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and the catalyst was neutralized by addition of a mixture of 30 ml of water and 3 ml of concentrated<br>
	hydrochloric acid.   The mixture was stirred for a period of about 15 minutes.   The<br>
stirring was stopped, the mixture was allowed to settle, and the mixture separated into an organic phase and an aqueous phase. The organic phase (which contained the MTC product) was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator at a temperature of about 50°C to obtain 13.82<br>
	grams of crude MTC as residue. The purity of crude MTC was 98.9% (using liquid<br>
chromatography), which translated to a net yield of 91.7% based on the sodium thiocyanate.<br>
Although the invention has been described in detail in the foregoing for the purpose<br>
	of illustration, it is to be understood that such detail is solely for that purpose and that<br>
variations can be made therein by those skilled in the art without departing from the<br>
