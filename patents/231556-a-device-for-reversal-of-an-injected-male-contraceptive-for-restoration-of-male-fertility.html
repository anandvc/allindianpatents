				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION :<br><br>
	The present invention relates to a device For reversal of an injected make the<br>
             this invention relates to a device, for restoration of<br>
male fertility, more particularly this invention relates to a device to reverse the injected male contraceptive for restoration of male fertility and to method of use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Male fertility derives from the production of viable spermatozoa having fertilizing ability and transport without damage along the male reproductive tract comprising of the vas deferens, ejaculatory duct and the urethera, to the female system at intecourse. There are various known methods to control male fertility and some of such known methods can be reversed to restore the male fertility, which are briefly described herein below with their disadvantages and drawbacks. Vas deferens in the male is a site for contraceptive interventions both in the well established method, that is vasectomy, and in emerging techniques of vas plugs prepared in vitro; plugs formed in situ; valves; biogalvanic device; and active injected compounds. Target properties aimed at are: simple contraception induction procedure to be followed by long term fertility control with the option of reversal on demand by means of an easy user acceptable technique. Considerable advances in obtaining contraceptive efficacy have been realised. The methods of inducing the fertility control are also now quite simple particularly the intra vas deferens polymer injection approach.<br>
One of the known method to control fertility of the prior art is by means of plug implantation. Plugs which serve purely as blocking agents can be removed by surgical<br><br>
manipulation. In order to achieve azoospermia the plugs are either made long or of large diameter of as much as 2.5 mm. With a fibrous nodule usually present at the site of the insertion of the plug, the approach to the vas deferens lumen and removal of the plug is not a very straightforward exercise.<br>
Further disadvantage of known method of reversal of fertility after implantation of plug is that, the presence of any plug in the lumen of the vas deferens leads to hppolastic changes in the vas deferens musculature with the wall becoming thin and fragile. Surgical manipulations are therefore fraught with the danger of rupture of the vas deferens necessitating reanastamosis.<br>
Another method to control fertility is by implantation of valve. Their reversal is also not easy and not free from disadvantages. Valves placed in the vas deferens are also not free from problems. Very often the valve is surrounded by a tissue pseudocapsule and operation of the valve calls for careful dissection to remove the encapsulating tissue. While carrying out this process the tubular ends of the valves are liable to slip out of the lumen and replacement and anchorage is a difficult task.<br>
Still another method to control fertility is by implantation of copper wire. Copper wire inserted into the lumen of the vas deferens has fertility control action but studies still are limited to animal models. Reveresal of fertility after implantation of copper wire is possible by pulling out the wire, but a number of problems arise. The wire may fragment inside the lumen and more commonly the protruding end of the wire, kept outside the vas deferens wall by choice to facilitate removal, gets covered by tissue requiring careful dissection.<br>
On account of the abovementioned disadvantages and drawbacks, the intra vas deferens injected active polymer technique has been proposed and it has the advantage that the polymer can be removed by injecting a flushing compound. For the styrene maleic anhydride polymer the removal can be effected by injecting dimethyl sulphoxide.<br>
Yet the experience shows that some of the complications of the other methods obtain in this case too. At the injection site there is a nodule which regresses over several years. For<br><br>
reversal injection, the vas deferens has to be approached at a point further proximal to the testes than the injection point. The vas deferens narrows proximally. In the animal studies this matter did not present a problem because the injections were given high up, that is very close to the external (superficial) inguinal ring, thus leaving considerable length of large sized vas deferens avialable more proximal to the testes for reversal injection. In the human the contraceptive injection must be given lower down, that is more proximal to the testes. There is rapid narrowing further proxima;lly.<br>
Therefore in reversal injection, fairly large scrotal opening to get a clear view of the vas deferens is a must and considerable skill in injection is necessary. Consequently the procedure, although quite feasible, does not meet the criteria of simplicity.<br>
The known other methods of controlling the fertility in males also involve means to block the flow of spermatozoa or means to affect the quality of the spermatozoa, when they pass through the reproductive duct, called the vas deferens of the male. The flow of spermatozoa can be affected by cutting and tying the vas deferens.<br>
The major disadvantage of this blocking technique to control the male fertility, known as vasectomy, requiring micro-surgery, is that the reversal of the fertility is not effective. The rejoining of the vas deferens does not result in the desired fertility because the level of generation of antibodies, which has been enhanced due to blockage of the vas deferens, remains high, which inturn continue to destroy the spermatozoa.<br>
Still another known method of controlling the male fertility is to affect the flow of the spermatozoa by occlusion method. Such known method comprises of implantation of a reversible occlusion device, which may be of type as described herein above, which on implantation blocks the flow of the spermatazoa in the vas deferens and control fertility. This method also has disadvantages, such as, it also requires surgery to implant a device known as occlusion device, the implanted device, which has a regulator knob and said regulator knob stays outside the vas deferens, but within the scrotum, and is operated only by the trained medical assistant. Further the reversal of this device also requires a surgery, and its removal does not result in reversal of<br><br>
full fertility due to maintained high level of generation of antibodies, which in turn continue to destroy the spermatozoa.<br>
Still further another known method to control the male fertility is to inject polyurethane at a high pressure in the vas deferens, as stated herein above. The injected polymer gets further polymerised in-situ to a solid plug by introducing an initiator. The solid plug thus formed blocks the flow of the spermatozoa in the manner as described herein above. The major disadvantage of such method is generation of back pressure in the epididymis and can not be reversed.<br>
Yet another known method to control male fertility and then to reverse male fertility is by injecting a contraceptive into the lumen of vas deferens, as described herein above, which is known to be suitable site for contraceptive intervention in the males. Such injectable contraceptives, as known in the prior art, are injected into the pathways of transport of the spermatozoa to either block the transport or so affect the spermatozoa that fertilizing ability is lost, that is can affect the quality and/or flow of the spermatozoa. Such injectable contraceptives, as known in the prior art and as developed by the inventor of the present invention, may or may not be located externally. Their reversal is achieved generally by injecting a compound, which when injected into the male reproductive pathways leads to a removal of injected/injectable contraceptive compound and restoration of fertility.<br>
The major drawback of such known compounds for reversing the male fertility after injecting injectable male contraceptive in addition to other drawbacks, as stated herein above, is that the procedure involves an intrusion into the body. In the above background it is appropriate to devise a convenient non-invasive reversal method.<br>
NEED OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Therefore, the current state of art is limited for reversal of male fertility. Therefore, there is a need to have a method to reverse the male fertility more safely and more effectively,<br><br>
preferably without any intrusion, particularly there is a need to have a device to reverse the chemical compound injected in male reproductive tract region, particularly to have a device for restoration of male fertility, more particularly to have a device to reverse the injected male contraceptive for restoration of male fertility and to method of use thereof, which can over come the disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art, as described herein above.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION :<br>
This is the main object of the present invention to make a complete disclosure of a device for restoration of male fertility, particularly of a device to reverse the injected male contraceptive for restoration of male fertility, and to method of use thereof, which can over come the some of the disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art, as described herein above.<br>
This is further an object of the present invention to make a complete disclosure of a device for restoration of male fertility, which can reverse the male fertility more safely and more effectively, preferably without any intrusion.<br>
This is still an object of the present invention to make a disclosure of a device for restoration of male fertility and method of use thereof, which can reverse the injected male contraceptive even if it is not traceable externally.<br>
This is still further an object of the present invention to make a disclosure of a device for restoration of male fertility and method of use thereof, which can reverse the injected male contraceptive or any other chemical compound injected in the male reproductive tract region and can also result in the good level of fertility at least, if not the same level of fertility.<br>
Still further an object of the present invention is to make a disclosure of a device for restoration of male fertility, which works on simple scientific principal, and is convenient and simple to manufacture, and easy to use.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION :<br>
A concept that intra vas deferens injected polymeric compounds which are non sclerosing and non tissue adherent can be expelled by applying appropriate forces is proposed. The injected compound, which is not a sclerosing agent and also does not have adhesive character become advantageous. Retention is on account of the intrinsic bulk shear resistance and some anchorage provided by the invaginations in the vas deferens lumen wall. Therefore, if these retention effects are overcome by suitable forces, the compound may be propelled towards the distal end of the vas deferens, ultimately to be evacuated via the ejaculatory duct. Thereby azoospermia will be tenninated. From earlier studies, both in the rhesus monkey and the human it is known that total removal of the SMA from the vas deferens by external forces is not essenial to reverse azoospermia. If the net bulk of SMA in the lumen is brought to a low level, the bulk shear forces are so much reduced that with the normal motility the remaining SMA is spontaneously evacuated. Consequently the objective of the present method is to reduce the amount of SMA in the vas deferens lumen instead of total removal.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention discloses a device for reversal of an injected chemical compound in male reproductive tract region, particularly this invention makes a discjosue1 of a device to reverse the injected male contraceptive for restoration of male fertility, more particularly this invention relates to a device for restoration of male fertility, as stated herein above, which primarly comprises of a mechanical moving part to compress in a travelling peristaltic form the male reproductive path, when placed on the body surface with the intact skin, and said mechanical part connected to an electronic part, which when linked to the body by means of novel electrodes placed on the body surface delivers electrical pulses so as to activate the male reproductive pathways to manifest peristaltic contractions to propel any compound, which may be present within the male reproductive path, and of a thumper, which when brought close to the skin of human body compresses the same by means of thumping, and of an electromechanical part, which gives rhythemic compressions on the ampulla of the male reproductive path when placed within the rectum in a non-surgical approach, and said mechanical part connected to said electrical part, said thumper and said electromechanical part are connected to a pulse generator/electrical stimulator.<br><br>
The present invention works primarly on a principal, that when an electrical pulse is sent<br>
across a	, it results in contraction of the same, and when electrical pulse is stopped, the<br>
contracted part expands again. Therefore, when the electrical pulse is sent and stopped<br>
alternatively,	should contract and expand alternatively. Further, when the electrical pulse<br>
generator keeps on moving, and sending and stopping electrical pulses alternatively, the	is<br>
expected to contract and expand alternatively over its length, which may result in movement of a<br>
substance, particularly an injected compound, more particularly injected contraceptive across its<br>
length. This movement is expected to enhance further, if additional but controlled mechanical<br>
push is given to the	and injected compopund.<br>

The electrical part 54 of electromechanical part 4 differs from thumper 3 in a way that there is no spring action and no distinct magnetic and non-magnetic parts in the magnetic rod 55. In accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the magnetic rod 55 is provided with a hole 62 to tighten a screw 63 into it 62. The magnetic rod 55 is disposed into the central hole 61 of of the tube 56 in such a way that an end provided with a hole 62 and tigtened screw 63 preferably through a washer 65, of magnetic rod 55 just fits onto one end 58 or 57 and another end extends out from end 57 or 58 of tube 56.

The other end of the thread 64 is connected to mechanical part 66 of the electromechanical part 4 of the presently disclosed device as described herein below with the help of figures 6 to 8.<br>
Now referring to figures 6 to 8, which shows various views of the mechanical part 66 of the electromechanical part 4 of the presently disclosed device, the mechanical part 66 comprises<br><br>
of a cylindrically holo body 67, a fixed sturt 68, a movable or sliding sturt 69 and all (parts 67, 68 and 69) conected through a continuous wire 70, referred as wire guide. In accordance to the preferred embodiment of the present invention thread or wire, preferably thread 64, referred as traction cord, from electrical part 54 of electromechanical part 4 of the presently disclosed device passes through a hole 71 provided in the cyllindrically holo body 67, a hole 72 provided in fixed sturt 68, a washer 73 provided on fixed sturt 68, a spring 74, referred as compression spring, a washer 75 provided on movable sturt 69, a hole 76 provided in movable sturt 69 and is finally tightened at an end 77 of a T-shaped body 78, referred as palpation component, which in-turn is disposed between preferably U-shaped cut 79 provided in movable sturt 69 with the help of a connecting pin 80 and a stretchable ring structure 81. This arrangement makes the T-shaped structure 78 to flexibly swing in direction 82, when thread 64 is pulled in direction 83. The U-shaped cut 79 provided in movable sturt 69 is covered with a sheet form structure 84 to prevent extra movement of T-shaped structure 78.<br>
Now referring to figure-9 for the purpose of discussion of the use of device disclosed in the present invention, the<br><br>
vas deferens may be cosidered to be comprising of the following segments: scrotal segment 84<br><br>
extending from the cauda epididymis85to the external inguinal ring; 86inguinal  segment 87 from the<br><br>
external inguinal ring86to the internal inguinal ring;88 upper pelvic segment 89from the internal<br><br>
inguinal ring 88 upto the beginning of the dilated ampulla 90 of the vas deferens; and finally the<br><br>
terminal segment including the ampulla91 and the ejaculatory duck Scrotal vas deferens is mostly<br><br>
palpable through the intact scrotal skin. The thin tortuous part close to the epididymis cannot be very well felt but the spermatic cord is palpable and any pressure on the cord may be expected to be transmitted to the vas deferens. Stabilizing the spermatic cord in a proximal site by means of two fingers of one hand, a squeezing action progressing towards the external inguinal ring can readily be applied percutaneously. This "milking1 action loosens the SMA depot and propels the contents towards the external inguinal ring.<br><br>
Under normal circumstances the inguinal vas deferens cannot be palpated. The course is well defined. Taking the pubic tubercle and the anterior superior iliac spines as landmarks, the location of the internal inguinal ring can reasonably accurately be marked as about one centimeter above the mid inguinal point. Reflected part of the inguinal ligament, conjoint tendon of the internal oblique muscle and fascia transversalis provide a firm base over which the spermatic cord can be pressed when force is applied from over the skin. In the procedure, the tips of all four fingers of both hands are placed over the surface marking of the spermatic cord in the inguinal region. A peristaltic propulsive effect within the vas deferens can be generated by pressing down with the fingers sequentially beginning from the one over the external inguinal ring and moving toward the finger tip over the internal ring. This sequence is repeated about 15 times in one treatment course for each vas deferens.<br>
Additional clearance effect is derived from contraction of the vas deferens musculature. Low frequency electrical stimulation produces contraction. In the present exercise the stimulation is delivered by means of surface electrodes. To obtain a peristaltic effect a pair of stimulation electrodes are moved along the surface from the location of the external inguinal ring to the internal inguinal ring. Concurrently pressure is applied. To realise these two effects concurrently an insulating rubber roller 20 mm diameter and 15 mm wide was prepared. On the outer cylindrical face of this roller pairs of small tags of electrically conducting rubber were affixed. An electrical connection arrangement was made such that the electrode pair in contact with the skin received the current from the electrical stimulator set to deliver constant voltage pulses of 30 V amplitude and pulse repitation rate 15 Hz. By means of a handle, the roller was pressed over the inguinal body surface and rolled upward from the external inguinal ring to the internal inguinal ring with twenty repetitions of the procedure.<br>
Upper pelvic segment of the vas deferens is the least accessible to manipulations. A combination of forces have been generated to loosen the SMA deposits and to some extent<br><br>
propel the the material. One of the steps involves the placement of a mechanical vibrator delivering vibrations with amplitude of 2 mm and frequency 10 Hz at the surface marking of the internal inguinal ring. Rationale underlying the step is that through the skin and subcutaneous tissue the vibration is communicated to the vas deferens. Mechanical tissue properties of the vas deferens differs from that of the surrounding and this difference accounts for the "whipchord1 like feel of the vas deferens. In effect the vas deferens becomes a distinct tube-like structure. Vibrations are preferentially transmitted along such a structure. A light pressure on the skin just proximal to the vibrator, that is toward the external ring, will enhance the transmission toward the pelvic portion of the vas deferens. Vibration of the wall loosens the deposits in the lumen. Furthermore, vibration produces stretch effects and can itself induce segmental contractions of the vas deferens. Concurrently forceful percussion is applied to the abdominal wall in the suprapubic region with the pleximeter finger well pressed down. Additionally the subject is asked to cough. These last two manoeuvres raise pelvic pressures transiently and are analogous in principle to the principle of removing bronchial secretions by percussion and coughing.<br>
Finally the terminal segment of the vas deferens is to be manipulated. Basically the approach is similar to per rectal prostatic massage. The difference being that instead of massaging the prostate per se, the finger is moved in a sweeping action from superior lateral location to inferior medial location so as to follow the path of the ampulla of the vas deferens. Subjects are placed in the knee-elbow position and nominal suprapubic abdominal compression is maintained to enhance the region of the ampulla of the vas deferens accessed by the palpating finger.<br>
In the monkey on account of the small size, the palpating finger in the rectum reaches well beyond the region of the ampulla of the vas deferens and no assistive devices are necessary. In the human the palpating finger falls short of the full extent of the ampulla. Making a rubber extention of the finger was attempted but the feeling of contact pressure was lost. An<br><br>
experimental device in the form of an extention of the finger by a length of 15 mm has now been made. Five parallel rubber balloons are embedded so that one end of the balloons press against the rectal wall and the other end is in contact with the distal phalange pulp of the palpating finger. Such a device gives extention along with a feel of pressure and to some extent contours. Nevertheless the device is still experimental and would be required only if restoration of normal semen profile is quickly required. Otherwise the finger without special provision will suffice.<br>
The present invention has been described with the help of the accompanying figures, which are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be resorted to without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
