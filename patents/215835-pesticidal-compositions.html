In the literature, certain methoxyacrylic acid derivatives are proposed as active ingredients<br>
of pesticidal compositions. The biological properties of those known compounds are not,<br>
however, entirely satisfactory in the field of pest control and there is therefore a need to<br>
make available other compounds having pesticidal properties, especially for controlling<br>
insects and representatives of the order Acarina and especially also for controlling<br>
phytopathogenic microorganisms, that problem being solved according to the invention by<br>
the provision of the present compounds of formula I.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula I contain asymmetric carbon atoms, with the result that<br>
those compounds can occur in optically active form. Owing to the presence of the C=X and<br>
oximino double bonds, the compounds can occur in the form of E isomers and Z isomers.<br>
Atropisomerism of the compounds may also occur. Formula I is intended to include all those<br>
possible isomeric forms, and mixtures thereof, for example racemates or mixtures of<br>
E/Z isomers.<br>
Unless otherwise defined, the general terms used hereinbefore and hereinafter have the<br>
following meanings.<br>
Unless otherwise defined, carbon-containing groups and compounds each contain from 1<br>
up to and including 8, preferably from 1 up to and including 6, especially from 1 up to and<br>
including 4 and above all 1 or 2, carbon atoms.<br>
Alkyl, both as a group perse and as a structural element of other groups and compounds,<br>
such as haloalkyl, alkoxy and alkylthio, is, in each case taking due account of the number of<br>
carbon atoms contained in the corresponding group or compound, either straight-chained,<br>
i.e. methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl, or branched, e.g. isopropyl, isobutyl, secbutyl,<br>
tert-butyl, isopentyl, neopentyl or isohexyl.<br>
Alkenyl, both as a group perse and as a stuctural element of other groups and compounds,<br>
such as haloalkenyl, is, in each case taking due account of the number of carbon atoms<br>
contained in the corresponding group or compound, either straight-chained, such as vinyl,<br>
1-methylvinyl, allyl, 1-butenyl or2-hexenyl, or branched, such as isopropenyl.<br>
Alkynyl, both as a group perse and as a stuctural element of other groups and compounds,<br>
such as haloalkynyl, is, in each case taking due account of the number of carbon atoms<br>
contained in the corresponding group or compound, either straight-chained, such as<br>
propargyl, 2-butynyl or 5-hexynyl, or branched, such as 2-ethynylpropyl or 2-propargylisopropyl.<br>
Co-CfiCycloalkyl is cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl.<br>
Alkylenedioxy is -O(alkylene)O-.<br>

compounds, such as O(alkylene), (alkylene)O, S(=O) (alkylene), (alkylene)S(=O)p or<br>
alkylenedioxy, is, in each case taking due account of the number of carbon atoms<br>
contained in the corresponding group or compound, either straight-chained, e.g. -CHpChL-,<br>
-CH2CH2CH2- or -CH2CH2CH2CH2-, or branched, e.g. -CH(CHg)-, -CH(C2H5)-, -C(CH3)2-<br>
, - CH(CH0)CH0- or-CH(CH0)CH(CH0)-.<br>
o d. u O<br>
Alkenylene is, in each case taking due account of the number of carbon atoms contained in<br>
the corresponding compound, either straight-chained, such as vin-1,2-ylene, all-1,3-ylene,<br>
but-1-en-1,4-ylene or hex-2-en-1,6-ylene, or branched, e.g. 1-methylvin-1,2-ylene.<br>
Alkynylene is, in each case taking due account of the number of carbon atoms contained in<br>
the corresponding compound, either straight-chained, such as propargylene, 2-butynylene<br>
or 5-hexynylene, or branched, e.g. 2-ethynylpropylene or 2-propargylisopropylene.<br>
Aryl is phenyl or naphthyl, especially phenyl.<br>
Heterocyclyl denotes a 5- to 7-membered aromatic or non-aromatic ring having from one to<br>
three hetero atoms selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. Preference is given to<br>
aromatic 5- and 6-membered rings containing a nitrogen atom as hetero atom and where<br>
appropriate a further hetero atom, preferably nitrogen or sulfur, especially nitrogen.<br>
Halogen, both as a group perse and as a structural element of other groups and<br>
compounds, such as haloalkyl, haloalkenyl and haloalkynyl, is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or<br>
iodine, especially fluorine, chlorine or bromine, more especially fluorine or chlorine and<br>
above all fluorine.<br>
Halo-substituted carbon-containing groups and compounds, such as haloalkyl, haloalkenyl<br>
or haloalkynyl, may be partially halogenated or perhalogenated, the halogen substituents in<br>
the case of multiple halogenation being identical or different. Examples of haloalkyl, both as<br>
a group perse and as a structural element of other groups and compounds, such as halo-<br>
alkenyl, are methyl mono- to tri-substituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or by bromine, such as<br>
CHF2 or CFgi ethyl mono- to penta-substituted by fluorine, chlorine and/or by bromine,<br>
such as CH2CF3, CF2CFg, CF2CCIg, CF2CHCI2, CF2CHF2, CF2CFCI2, CF2CHBr2,<br>
CF2CHCIF, CF2CHBrF or CCIFCHCIF; propyl or isopropyl each mono- to hepta-substituted<br>

is familiar to a person skilled in the art, some of the compounds of formula I may be in<br>
the form of tautomers, especially when R? is H. Hereinbefore and hereinafter, the<br>
compounds of formula I are therefore to be understood to include corresponding tautomers,<br>
even if the latter are not specifically mentioned in each case.<br>
Compounds of formula I having at least one basic centre are capable, for example, of<br>
forming acid addition salts. Those salts are formed, for example, with strong inorganic<br>
acids, such as mineral acids, for example perchloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, nitrous<br>
acid, a phosphoric acid or a hydrohalic acid, with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as<br>
unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-substituted, C^C^alkanecarboxylic acids, for<br>
example acetic acid, saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic,<br>
malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric or phthalic acid, hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example<br>
ascorbic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, or benzoic acid, or with organic sulfonic acids,<br>
such as unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-substituted, C,-C4alkane- or<br>
aryl-sulfonic acids, for example methane- or p-toluene-sulfonic acid. Furthermore,<br>
compounds of formula I having at least one acid group are capable of forming salts with<br>
bases. Suitable salts with bases are, for example, metal salts, such as alkali metal or<br>
alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium or magnesium salts, or salts with<br>
ammonia or an organic amine, such as morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, a mono-, di- or<br>
tri-lower alkylamine, for example ethyl-, diethyl-, triethyl- or dimethyl-propylamine, or a<br>
mono-, di- or tri-hydroxy-lower alkylamine, for example mono-, di- or tri-ethanolamine. In<br>
addition, corresponding internal salts may also be formed. Preference is given within the<br>
scope of the invention to agrochemically advantageous salts. In view of the close<br>
relationship between the compounds of formula I in free form and in the form of their salts,<br>
any reference hereinbefore or hereinafter to the compounds of formula I is to be understood<br>
as including also the corresponding salts, where appropriate and expedient. The same<br>
applies in the case of tautomers of compounds of formula I and the salts thereof. The free<br>
form is generally preferred in each case.<br>

The compounds of formulae I, II, III, IV, VII, VIII and IX may be in the form of one of the<br>
possible isomers or in the form of a mixture thereof, for example depending on the number<br>
of asymmetric carbon atoms and the absolute and relative configuration thereof they may<br>
be in the form of pure isomers, such as antipodes and/or diastereoisomers, or in the form of<br>
mixtures of isomers, such as mixtures of enantiomers, for example racemates, mixtures of<br>
diastereoisomers or mixtures of racemates; the invention relates both to the pure isomers<br>
and to all possible mixtures of isomers and this is to be understood hereinbefore and<br>
hereinafter, even if stereochemical details are not specifically mentioned in each case.<br>
Mixtures of diastereoisomers and mixtures of racemates of compounds of formulae I, II, III,<br>
IV, VII, VIII and IX that are obtainable in accordance with the process depending upon the<br>
starting materials and procedures chosen, or by other means, can be separated on the<br>
basis of the physicochemical differences between the constituents into the pure<br>
diastereoisomers or racemates in known manner, for example by fractional crystallisation,<br>
distillation and/or chromatography.<br>
Correspondingly obtainable mixtures of enantiomers, such as racemates, can be separated<br>
into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example by recrystallisation from an<br>
optically active solvent, by chromatography on chiral adsorbents, for example high-pressure<br>
liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetyl cellulose, with the aid of suitable microorganisms,<br>
by cleavage with specific immobilised enzymes, via the formation of inclusion compounds,<br>
for example using chiral crown ethers, in which case only one enantiomer is complexed.<br>
Apart from by the separation of corresponding mixtures of isomers, it is possible according<br>
to the invention to obtain pure diastereoisomers or enantiomers also by generally known<br>
methods of diastereoselective or enantioselective synthesis, for example by carrying out the<br>
process according to the invention with starting materials having a correspondingly suitable<br>
stereochemistry.<br>
Advantageously, the biologically more active isomer, for example enantiomer, or mixture of<br>
isomers, for example mixture of enantiomers, will be isolated or synthesised, insofar as the<br>
individual components have differing biological activity.<br>
The compounds of formulae I, II, III, IV, VII, VIII and IX also be obtained in the form of their<br>
hydrates and/or may include other solvents, for example solvents used, where appropriate,<br>
for the crystallisation of compounds in solid form.<br>
The invention relates to all those forms of the process according to which a compound<br>
obtainable as starting material or intermediate at any stage of the process is used as<br>
starting material and all or some of the remaining steps are carried out, or a starting material<br>
is used in the form of a derivative or a salt and/or its racemates or antipodes or, especially,<br>
is formed under the reaction conditions.<br>
In the process of the present invention there are preferably used those starting materials<br>
and intermediates which result in the compounds of formula I described at the beginning as<br>
being especially valuable.<br>
The invention relates especially to the preparation processes described in Examples P1,<br>
P3, P5, P7 and P8.<br>
The invention relates also to those starting materials and intermediates used according to<br>
the invention for the preparation of the compounds of formula I, especially those<br>
compounds of formulae II, III, IV, VII, VIII and IX, that are novel, to the use thereof and to<br>
processes for the preparation thereof. In particular, the compounds of formulae II, III, IV and<br>
IX can be prepared analogously to Examples P1, P3 and P7 and P8, respectively.<br>
It has now been found that the compounds of formula I have a microbicidal spectrum that is<br>
especially advantageous for practical requirements in the control of phytopathogenic<br>
microorganisms, especially fungi. They have very advantageous curative, preventive and, in<br>
particular, systemic properties, and can be used in the protection of numerous cultivated<br>
plants. With the compounds of formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy the pests which<br>
occur on plants or on parts of plants (the fruit, blossom, leaves, stems, tubers, roots) in<br>
different crops of useful plants, while at the same time parts of plants which grow later are<br>
also protected from phytopathogenic microorganisms.<br>
The compounds of formula I can also be used as dressing agents for protecting seed (fruit,<br>
tubers, grains) and plant cuttings against fungal infection as well as against<br>
phytopathogenic fungi which occur in the soil.<br>
Compounds of formula I are effective, for example, against the phytopathogenic fungi<br>
belonging to the following classes: Fungi imperfect! (especially Botrytis, also Pyricularia,<br>
Helminthosporium, Fusarium, Septoria, Cercospora, Cercosporella and Altemaria);<br>
Basidiomycetes (e.g. Rhizoctonia, Hemileia, Puccinia). They are also effective against the<br>
class of the Ascomycetes (e.g. Venturia and Erysiphe, Podosphaera, Monilinia, Uncinula),<br>
but especially against the class of the Oomycetes (e.g. Phytophthora, Peronospora,<br>
Bremia, Pythium, Plasmopara).<br>
The compounds of formula I according to the invention are also valuable active ingredients<br>
in the field of animal pest control, while being well tolerated by warm-blooded animals, fish<br>
and plants. In particular, the compounds according to the invention are effective against<br>
insects and representatives of the order Acarina, such as those occurring on useful plants<br>
and ornamentals in agriculture and horticulture, especially in plantations of cotton,<br>
vegetables and fruit, and in forestry. The compounds of the invention are suitable especially<br>
for controlling insects and representatives of the order Acarina in crops of fruit and<br>
vegetables, especially for controlling plant-destructive insects, such as Spodoptera littoralis,<br>
Heliothis virescens, Diabrotica balteata and Crocidolomia binotalis. Further areas of use of<br>
the compounds of the invention are in the protection of stocks and materials and in the<br>
hygiene sector, especially in the protection of domestic animals and productive livestock.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are effective against all or individual<br>
development stages of normally sensitive pests, but also of resistant pests. The action of<br>
the compounds of the invention may manifest itself, for example, in the mortality of the<br>
pests, which occurs immediately or only after some time, for example during moulting, or in<br>
reduced oviposition and/or hatching rate.<br>

The good pesticidal activity of the compounds according to the invention corresponds to a<br>
mortality of at least 50-60 % of the mentioned pests.<br>
The activity of the compounds of the invention and of the compositions comprising them<br>
can be substantially broadened and adapted to prevailing circumstances by the addition of<br>
other insecticides and/or acaricides. Examples of suitable additional active ingredients<br>
include representatives of the following classes of compounds: organophosphorus<br>
compounds, nitrophenols and derivatives, formamidines, ureas, carbamates, pyrethroids,<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbons, and Bacillus thuringiensis preparations.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are used in unmodified form or preferably<br>
together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in formulation technology, and are<br>
therefore formulated in known manner, e.g. into emulsifiable concentrates, directly sprayable<br>
or dilatable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts or<br>
granules, or by encapsulation in e.g. polymer substances. As with the nature of the<br>
compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, scattering<br>
or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing<br>
circumstances.<br>
The formulations, i.e. the compositions, preparations or mixtures comprising the compound<br>
(active ingredient) and, where appropriate, solid or liquid adjuvants, are prepared in known<br>
manner, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient with the<br>
adjuvants, such as extenders, e.g. solvents or solid carriers, or surface active compounds<br>
(surfactants).<br>
Suitable solvents are, for example: aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably the fractions of<br>
alkylbenzenes containing 8 to 12 carbon atoms, such as xylene mixtures, alkylated<br>
naphthalenes, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane, paraffins or<br>
tetrahydronaphthalene, alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, glycols and their<br>
ethers and esters, such as propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ether, ethylene glycol or<br>
ethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether, ketones, such as cyclohexanone,<br>
isophorone or diacetone alcohol, strongly polar solvents, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone,<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide or N,N-dimethylformamide, water and vegetable oils or epoxidised<br>
vegetable oils, such as rape oil, castor oil, coconut oil or soybean oil or epoxidised rape oil,<br>
castor oil, coconut oil or soybean oil, and, where appropriate, silicone oils.<br>
The solid carriers used, e.g. for dusts and dispersible powders, are normally natural mineral<br>
fillers such as calcite, talcum, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. In order to improve the<br>
physical properties it is also possible to add highly dispersed silicic acids or highly dispersed<br>
absorbent polymers. Suitable granulated adsorptive carriers are porous types, such as<br>
pumice, broken brick, sepiolite or bentonite; and suitable nonsorbent carriers are calcite or<br>
sand. In addition, a great number of granulated materials of inorganic or organic nature can<br>
be used, especially dolomite or pulverised plant residues.<br>
Depending on the nature of the compound to be formulated, suitable surface-active<br>
compounds are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants having good emulsifying,<br>
dispersing and wetting properties. The term "surfactants" will also be understood as<br>
comprising mixtures of surfactants.<br>
Non-ionic surfactants are preferably polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic<br>
alcohols, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, said derivatives containing<br>
3 to 30 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon moiety<br>
and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the alkylphenols. Further suitable non-ionic<br>
surfactants are water-soluble adducts of polyethylene oxide with polypropylene glycol,<br>
ethylenediaminopolypropylene glycol and alkylpolypropylene glycol containing 1 to 10<br>
carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, which adducts contain 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether<br>
groups and 10 to 100 propylene glycol ether groups. These compounds usually contain 1 to<br>
5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit. Representative examples of non-ionic<br>
surfactants are nonylphenol polyethoxyethanols, castor oil polyglycol ethers,<br>
polypropylene/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, polyethylene<br>
glycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan,<br>
e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate, are also suitable non-ionic surfactants.<br>
Cationic surfactants are preferably quaternary ammonium salts which contain, as Nsubstituent,<br>
at least one Cs-C22a|ky| radical and, as further substituents, unsubstituted or<br>
halogenated lower alkyl, benzyl or hydroxy-lower alkyl radicals. The salts are preferably in<br>
the form of halides, methyl sulfates or ethyl sulfates. Examples are stearyltrimethylammonium<br>
chloride and benzyl-di(2-chloroethyl)ethylammonium bromide.<br>
-35-<br>
Both water-soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic surface-active compounds are<br>
suitable anionic surfactants. Suitable soaps are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal<br>
salts and unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (C-| rj-C22)&gt; e.g.<br>
the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid or of natural fatty acid mixtures which<br>
can be obtained e.g. from coconut oil or tall oil; mention may also be made of fatty acid<br>
methyltaurine salts. More frequently, however, synthetic surfactants are used, especially<br>
fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alkylarylsulfonates.<br>
The fatty sulfonates or sulfates are usually in the form of alkali metal salts, alkaline earth<br>
metal salts or unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts and generally contain a Cg-C22-<br>
alkyl radical, which also includes the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals; there may be mentioned<br>
by way of example the sodium or calcium salt of lignosulfonic acid, of dodecyl sulfate or of a<br>
mixture of fatty alcohol sulfates obtained from natural fatty acids. These compounds also<br>
include the salts of sulfated and sulfonated fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts. The<br>
sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain 2 sulfonic acid groups and one fatty<br>
acid radical containing approximately 8 to 22 carbon atoms. Examples of alkylarylsulfonates<br>
are the sodium, calcium or triethanolammonium salts of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid,<br>
dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid or of a condensate of naphthalenesulfonic acid and<br>
formaldehyde. Also suitable are corresponding phosphates, e.g. salts of the phosphoric<br>
acid ester of an adduct of p-nonylphenol with 4 to 14 mol of ethylene oxide, or<br>
phospholipids.<br>
The surfactants listed above are to be regarded merely as examples; many other<br>
surfactants used in formulation technology that are suitable in accordance with the invention<br>
are described in the relevant literature.<br>
The pesticidal compositions usually comprise 0.1 to 99%, preferably 0.1 to 95%, of active<br>
ingredient, and 1 to 99.9%, preferably 5 to 99.9%, of a solid or liquid adjuvant, it generally<br>
being possible for 0 to 25%, preferably 0.1 to 20%, of the composition to be surfactants (in<br>
each case percentages are by weight). Whereas commercial products will preferably be<br>
formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations which<br>
have considerably lower active ingredient concentrations. Typical rates of concentration are<br>
from 0.1 to 1000 ppm, preferably from 0.1 to 500 ppm, active ingredient. The rates of<br>
application per hectare are generally from 1 to 1000 g of active ingredient per hectare,<br>
preferably from 25 to 500 g/ha.<br>

Preparation Examples<br>
Example P1/1: 1 -[4-(2,2-Dichlorocyclopropylmethoxy)-2,5-difluorophenyl]-propan-1 -one 2-<br>
oxime (Compound No. 1.77 in Table 1)<br>
a) Propionic acid (2,5-difluorophenyl) ester<br>
At 0°C-5°C, a solution of 100 g of 2,5-difluorophenol in 66.5 g of pyridine is added dropwise<br>
in the course of 2 hours to a solution of 71.2 g of propionic acid chloride in 800 ml of<br>
toluene and stirring is then carried out at room temperature for a further hour. The reaction<br>
mixture is then diluted with ethyl acetate, washed twice with water and once with saturated<br>
sodium chloride solution and the organic phase is separated off, dried with sodium sulfate<br>
and concentrated by evaporation in vacua. The crude product is processed further without<br>
further purification.<br>
b) 1 -(2,5-Difluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propan-1 -one<br>
117.9 g of propionic acid (2,5-difluorophenyl) ester are heated to 60°C and then 169.1 g of<br>
aluminium trichloride are added in small portions. When the addition is complete, the<br>
reaction mixture is heated at 120°C until the evolution of hydrogen chloride gas can no<br>
longer be observed. The mixture is then cooled to 50°C and 400 ml of water are added<br>
dropwise, followed by approximately 100 ml of ethyl acetate. Extraction of the reaction<br>
mixture is carried out several times with ethyl acetate and the combined extracts are<br>
washed twice with water and once with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried with<br>
sodium sulfate and concentrated by evaporation in vacua. Recrystallisation of the residue<br>
from ethyl acetate/hexane yields 1-(2,5-difluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propan-1-one having a<br>
melting point of 116-117°C.<br>
c) 1 -[4-(2,2-Dichlorocyclopropylmethoxy)-2,5-difluorophenyl]-propan-1 -one<br>
40.3 g of 2-bromomethyl-1,1-dichlorocyclopropane are added dropwise at room<br>
temperature to a suspension of 29 g of 1-(2,5-difluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propan-1-one, 28.6<br>
g of potassium carbonate and 0.5 g of potassium iodide in 95 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
The reaction mixture is then stirred at 90°C for 1.5 hours, cooled and poured into ice-water.<br>
The product which precipitates is filtered off and dissolved in ethyl acetate and the solution<br>
is washed twice with water and once with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried with<br>
sodium sulfate and concentrated by evaporation in vacua. The crude product is made into<br>
a slurry in cold hexane, filtered and dried in vacua, yielding 1-[4-(2,2-<br>
dichlorocyclopropylmethoxy)-2,5-difluorophenyl]-propan-1-one having a melting point of 89-<br>
91 °C.<br>
d) 1 -[4-(2,2-Dichlorocyclopropylmethoxy)-2,5-difluorophenyl]-propan-1 -one 2-oxime<br>
Hydrogen chloride gas is introduced into 350 ml of dioxane for 2 minutes and then 43.5 g of<br>
(2,2-dichlorocyclopropylmethoxy)-2,5-difluorophenyl]-propan-1-one, followed, dropwise, by<br>
19.8 g of isopentyl nitrite, are added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for<br>
24 hours and then hydrogen chloride gas is again introduced for 2 minutes and the reaction<br>
mixture is stirred for a further 30 hours at room temperature. The mixture is then rendered<br>
basic with triethylamine and concentrated by evaporation in vacua. The residue is dissolved<br>
in ethyl acetate and the solution is washed twice with water and once with saturated sodium<br>
chloride solution, dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated by evaporation in vacua.<br>
Purification by flash chromatography (silica gel, ethyl acetate/hexane 1:3) yields the title<br>
compound having a melting point of 74-76°C.<br>
Example P1/2:1-[4-(4-Chlorophenoxy)-2-fluorophenyl]-propan-1-one 2-oxime (Compound<br>
No. 1.57)<br>
a) At room temperature, 12.9 g (0.1 mol) of 4-chlorophenol are stirred vigorously for 1 hour<br>
with 20.7 g (0.15 mol) of potassium carbonate in 150 ml of N,N-dimethylacetamide. 17.0 g<br>
(0.1 mol) of 2,4-difluorophenyl-propane-1-one are added and the reaction mixture is stirred<br>
for 2-3 hours at a bath temperature of 130-140°C. The reaction mixture is cooled to 25°C<br>
and the solvent is distilled off under a high vacuum. The residue is taken up in ether and<br>
washed with water, 10 % KOH solution and brine. The organic phase is dried over sodium<br>
sulfate and concentrated by evaporation in vacua. An oil is obtained which, according to the<br>
NMR-Spectrum, consists of 34 % 1-[4-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-fluorophenyl]-propan-1-one.<br>
b) 23.0 g of a mixture comprising approximately 34 % 1-[4-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-fluorophenyl]-<br>
propan-1 -one are dissolved in 250 ml of ether. At a temperature of 20-30°C, dry<br>
hydrogen chloride is introduced for 15 minutes. Then 11.5 g (99 mmol) of isopentyl nitrite<br>
are added dropwise in such a manner that the temperature does not exceed 25°C. The<br>
reaction mixture is then stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The mixture is discharged<br>
into 500 ml of ice-water and the organic phase is separated off. The ether phase is washed<br>
neutral with water and dried with brine and sodium sulfate. Concentration by evaporation in<br>
vacua yields a crude product which is chromatographed on silica gel with ethyl acetate<br>
admixed with 3-8 % hexane, under a pressure of 1.2 bar, yielding an oil which consists of<br>
the title compound and the starting material, 1-[4-(4-chlorophenoxy)-2-fluorophenyl]-propan-<br>
1-one.<br>

Biological Examples<br>
A) Microbicidal action<br>
Example B1: Action against Phytoohthora infestans on tomatoes<br>
a) Curative action<br>
After a cultivation period of 3 weeks, tomato plants of the "Red Gnome" variety are sprayed<br>
with a zoospore suspension of the fungus and incubated in a cabinet at 18 to 20° and 100<br>
% humidity. Humidification is stopped after 24 hours. When the plants have dried, they are<br>
sprayed with a mixture comprising the test compound formulated as a wettable powder in a<br>
concentration of 200 ppm. After the spray coating has dried, the plants are again placed in<br>
the humidity cabinet for 4 days. The activity of the test compounds is evaluated on the basis<br>
of the number and size of the typical leaf specks that have occurred after that time.<br>
b) Preventive-systemic action<br>
The test compound formulated as a wettable powder is applied in a concentration of 60<br>
ppm (based on the volume of the soil) to the soil surface of three-week-old tomato plants of<br>
the "Red Gnome" variety planted in pots. After a 3-day waiting period, the undersides of the<br>
leaves of the plants are sprayed with a zoospore suspension of Phytophthora infestans.<br>
The plants are then kept in a spray cabinet for 5 days at 18 to 20°C and 100 % humidity.<br>
After that time, typical leaf specks form, the number and size of which are used to evaluate<br>
the activity of the test compounds.<br>
While infestation is 100% on untreated and infected control plants, the compounds of<br>
formula I according to one of Tables 3 to 14 reduce infestation to 20% or less in both tests.<br>
Compounds 3.1, 3.2 and 3.15 are almost completely effective.<br>
Example B2: Action against Plasmopara viticola (Bert, et Curt.) (Berl. et DeToni) on vines<br>
a) Residual-preventive action<br>
Vine seedlings of the "Chasselas" variety are grown in a greenhouse. 3 plants are sprayed<br>
at the 10-leaf stage with a mixture (200 ppm active ingredient). After the spray coating has<br>
dried, the undersides of the leaves of the plants are infected uniformly with a spore suspension<br>
of the fungus. The plants are then kept in a humidity chamber for 8 days. After that<br>
time, the control plants exhibit marked symptoms of disease. The activity of the test<br>
compounds is evaluated on the basis of the number and size of the sites of infection on the<br>
treated plants.<br>
b) Curative action<br>
Vine seedlings of the "Chasselas" variety are grown in a greenhouse and the undersides of<br>
the leaves are infected at the 10-leaf stage with a spore suspension of Plasmopara viticola.<br>
After 24 hours in a humidity cabinet, the plants are sprayed with a mixture of the test<br>
compound (200 ppm active ingredient). Then the plants are kept in the humidity cabinet for<br>
a further 7 days. After that time, the control plants exhibit symptoms of disease. The activity<br>
of the test compounds is evaluated on the basis of the number and size of the sites of<br>
infection on the treated plants.<br>
In comparison with the control plants, infestation is 20% or less on the plants treated with<br>
compounds of formula I.<br>
Example B3: Action against Pythium debaryanum on sugar beet (Beta vulgaris)<br>
a) Action following soil application<br>
The fungus is cultivated on sterile oat grains and added to a soil/sand mixture. The soil so<br>
infected is introduced into plant pots and sown with sugar beet seeds. Immediately after<br>
sowing, a wettable powder formulation of the test compounds is poured in the form of an<br>
aqueous suspension over the soil (20 ppm active ingredient, based on the volume of the<br>
soil). The pots are then placed in a greenhouse at 20-24°C for 2-3 weeks. The soil is kept<br>
uniformly moist by light spraying with water. The test is evaluated by determining the<br>
emergence of the sugar beet plants and the number of healthy and diseased plants.<br>
b) Action following application by dressing<br>
The fungus is cultivated on sterile oat grains and added to a soil/sand mixture. The soil so<br>
infected is introduced into plant pots and sown with sugar beet seeds which have been<br>
dressed with the test compounds formulated as dressing powders (1000 ppm active<br>
ingredient, based on the weight of the seeds). The pots containing the seeds are then<br>
placed in a greenhouse at 20-24°C for 2-3 weeks. The soil is kept uniformly moist by light<br>
spraying with water.<br>
The test is evaluated by determining the emergence of the sugar beet plants and the<br>
number of healthy and diseased plants.<br>
Following treatment with compounds of formula I, over 80% of the plants emerge and have<br>
a healthy appearance. In the control pots, only the occasional emerged plant, with a<br>
diseased appearance, is observed.<br>
Example B4: Residual-protective action against Cercospora arachidicola on groundnuts<br>
10 to 15 cm high groundnut plants are sprayed to drip point with an aqueous spray mixture<br>
(0.02% active ingredient) and are infected 48 hours later with a conidia suspension of the<br>
fungus. The plants are incubated for 72 hours at 21 °C and high humidity and are then<br>
placed in a greenhouse until the typical leaf specks occur. The activity of the test compound<br>
is evaluated 12 days after infection and is based on the number and size of the leaf specks.<br>
Compounds of formula I bring about a reduction in leaf specks to less than about 10% of<br>
the leaf surface. In some cases, the disease is inhibited completely (0-5% infestation).<br>
Example B5: Action against Puccinia graminis on wheat<br>
a) Residual-protective action<br>
6 days after sowing, wheat plants are sprayed to drip point with an aqueous spray mixture<br>
(0.02% active ingredient) and are infected 24 hours later with a uredospore suspension of<br>
the fungus. After an incubation period of 48 hours (conditions: 95 to 100% relative humidity<br>
at 20°C), the plants are placed in a greenhouse at 22°C. Evaluation of rust pustule development<br>
is made 12 days after infection.<br>
b) Systemic action<br>
5 days after sowing, wheat plants are watered with an aqueous spray mixture (0.006%<br>
active ingredient, based on the volume of the soil). Care is taken that the spray mixture<br>
does not come into contact with the parts of the plants above the soil. After 48 hours the<br>
plants are infected with a uredospore suspension of the fungus. After an incubation period<br>
of 48 hours (conditions: 95 to 100% relative humidity at 20°C), the plants are placed in a<br>
greenhouse at 22°C. Evaluation of rust pustule development is made 12 days after<br>
infection.<br>
Compounds of formula I effect a marked reduction in fungus infestation. In particular,<br>
compounds 3.1, 3.2, 3.15, 4.15 and 4.27 effect a reduction in fungus infestation of more<br>
than 90 %.<br>
Example B6: Action against Pyricularia oryzae on rice<br>
a) Residual-protective action<br>
After a cultivation period of 2 weeks, rice plants are sprayed to drip point with an aqueous<br>
spray mixture (0.02% active ingredient) and are infected 48 hours later with a conidia<br>
suspension of the fungus. Evaluation of fungus infestation is made 5 days after infection,<br>
during which period 95 to 100% relative humidity and a temperature of 22°C are<br>
maintained.<br>
b) Systemic action<br>
2-week-old rice plants are watered with an aqueous spray mixture (0.006% active<br>
ingredient, based on the volume of the soil). Care is taken that the spray mixture does not<br>
come into contact with the parts of the plants above the soil. The pots are then filled with<br>
water so that the lowermost parts of the stems of the rice plants stand in water. After 96<br>
hours, the plants are infected with a conidia suspension of the fungus and are kept for 5<br>
days at 95 to 100% relative humidity and a temperature of 24°C.<br>
Compounds of formula I largely prevent the disease from breaking out on the infected<br>
plants. In particular, compounds 3.1, 3.2, 3.15, 4.15 and 4.27 effect a reduction in fungus<br>
infestation of more than 90 %.<br>
Example B7: Residual-protective action against Venturia inaequalis on apples<br>
Apple cuttings with 10-20 cm long fresh shoots are sprayed to drip point with a spray<br>
mixture (0.02% active ingredient) and are infected 24 hours later with a conidia suspension<br>
of the fungus. The plants are incubated for 5 days at 90 to 100% relative humidity and are<br>
placed for a further 10 days in a greenhouse at 20 to 24°C. Scab infestation is evaluated 15<br>
days after infection.<br>

diseases. In particular, compounds 3.1, 3.2, 3.15 and 4.15 effect a reduction in fungus<br>
infestation of more than 90 %.<br>
Example B8: Action against Erysiphe graminis on barley<br>
a) Residual-protective action<br>
Barley plants about 8 cm in height are sprayed to drip point with an aqueous spray mixture<br>
(0.02% active ingredient) and are dusted 3 to 4 hours later with conidia of the fungus. The<br>
infected plants are placed in a greenhouse at 22°C. Fungus infestation is evaluated 10 days<br>
after infection.<br>
b) Systemic action<br>
Barley plants about 8 cm in height are watered with an aqueous spray mixture (0.002%<br>
active ingredient, based on the volume of the soil). Care is taken that the spray mixture<br>
does not come into contact with the parts of the plants above the soil. The plants are dusted<br>
48 hours later with conidia of the fungus. The infected plants are placed in a greenhouse at<br>
22°C. Evaluation of fungus infestation is made 10 days after infection.<br>
Compounds of formula I are generally able to reduce disease infestation to less than 20%,<br>
and in some cases even completely. Compounds 3.1, 3.2, 3.15, 4.15 and 4.27 reduce<br>
fungus infestation to less than 5 %.<br>
Example B9: Action against Podosphaera leucotricha on apple shoots<br>
Residual-protective action<br>
Apple cuttings with about 15 cm long fresh shoots are sprayed with a spray mixture (0.06%<br>
active ingredient). After 24 hours, the treated plants are infected with a conidia suspension<br>
of the fungus and are placed in a climatic chamber at 70% relative humidity and 20°C.<br>
Fungus infestation is evaluated 12 days after infection.<br>
Following treatment with compounds of formula I disease infestation is less than 20%.<br>
Control plants exhibit 100% infestation. Compounds 3.1 and 3.2 reduce fungus infestation<br>
to less than 5 %.<br>
Example B10: Action against Botrytis cinerea on apple fruits<br>
Residual-protective action<br>
Artificially damaged apples are treated by dropping a spray mixture (0.02% active<br>
ingredient) onto the damaged sites. The treated fruits are then inoculated with a spore<br>
suspension of the fungus and are incubated for one week at high humidity and about 20°C.<br>
The fungicidal activity of the test compound is derived from the number of rotted damaged<br>
sites.<br>
The compounds of formula I of Tables 3 to 14 are able to prevent the rot from spreading, in<br>
some cases completely. In particular, compounds 3.1, 3.2, 3.15 and 4.15 reduce fungus<br>
infestation to less than 5 %.<br>
Example B11: Action against Helminthosporium gramineum<br>
Wheat grains are contaminated with a spore suspension of the fungus and are left to dry.<br>
The contaminated grains are dressed with a suspension of the test compound (600 ppm<br>
active ingredient, based on the weight of the seeds). 2 days later, the grains are placed on<br>
suitable agar dishes and, after a further four days, the development of the fungus colonies<br>
around the grains is assessed. The evaluation of the test compound is based on the<br>
number and size of the fungus colonies.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula I exhibit good activity, i.e. inhibition of the fungus<br>
colonies. In particular, compounds 3.1, 3.2, 3.15, 4.15 and 4.27 reduce fungus infestation to<br>
less than 5 %.<br>
Example B12: Action against Colletotrichum lagenarium on cucumbers<br>
After a cultivation period of 2 weeks, cucumber plants are sprayed with a spray mixture<br>
(concentration 0.002%). 2 days later, the plants are infected with a spore suspension<br>
(1.5x105 spores/ml) of the fungus and are incubated for 36 hours at 23°C and high<br>
humidity. Incubation is then continued at normal humidity and about 22-23°C. The fungus<br>
infestation that has occurred is evaluated 8 days after infection. Fungus infestation is 100%<br>
on untreated and infected control plants.<br>
The compounds of formula I inhibit infestation with the disease in some cases almost<br>
completely. In particular, compounds 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.15, 3.36, 4.27 and 5.103 reduce<br>
fungus infestation to less than 5 %.<br>
Example B13: Action against Fusarium nivale on rye<br>
Rye of the Tetrahell variety which is naturally infected with Fusarium nivale is dressed in a<br>
roller mixer with the test fungicide, the following concentrations being used: 20 or 6 ppm a.i.<br>
(based on the weight of the seed).<br>
The infected and treated rye is sown in October in the open with a seeder in plots 3 metres<br>
long and in 6 rows. Three replicates are carried out with each concentration.<br>
Until evaluation of the infestation is made, the test crop is cultivated under normal field<br>
conditions (preferably in a region with unbroken snow cover during the winter months).<br>
In order to evaluate the phytotoxicity, the emergence is assessed in the autumn and the<br>
crop density/number of plants per unit area is assessed in the spring.<br>
To determine the effectiveness of the test compounds, the percentage of plants attacked by<br>
Fusarium is calculated in the spring immediately after the snow has melted. The number of<br>
infested plants is less than 5% in the present case. The plants that have emerged have a<br>
healthy appearance,<br>
Example B14: Action against Septoria nodorum on wheat<br>
Wheat plants are sprayed at the 3-leaf stage with a spray mixture (60 ppm a.i.) prepared<br>
from a wettable powder formulation of the test compounds.<br>
24 hours later, the treated plants are infected with a conidia suspension of the fungus. The<br>
plants are then incubated for 2 days at 90-100% relative humidity and are placed in a<br>
greenhouse for a further 10 days at 20-24°C. Fungus infestation is evaluated 13 days after<br>
infection. Less than 1% of the wheat plants are infested.<br>
Example B15: Action against Rhizoctonia solani on rice<br>
Protective local soil application<br>
10-day-old rice plants are watered with a suspension (spray mixture) prepared from formulated<br>
test compound, without contaminating the parts of the plants above the soil. The plants<br>
are infected three days later by placing a barley straw infected with Rhizoctonia solani<br>
between the rice plants in each pot. Fungus infestation is evaluated after incubation for<br>
6 days in a climatic chamber at a day temperature of 29°C and a night temperature of 26°C<br>
and at 95% relative humidity. Less than 5% of the rice plants are infested. The plants have<br>
a healthy appearance.<br>
Protective local foliar application<br>
12-day-old rice plants are sprayed with a suspension prepared from formulated test<br>
compounds. The plants are infected one day later by placing a barley straw infected with<br>
Rhizoctonia solani between the rice plants in each pot. Evaluation is made after incubation<br>
for 6 days in a climatic chamber at a day temperature of 29°C and a night temperature of<br>
26°C and at 95% relative humidity. Fungus infestation is 100% on untreated and infected<br>
control plants. The compounds of formula I inhibit disease infestation in some cases<br>
completely.<br>
