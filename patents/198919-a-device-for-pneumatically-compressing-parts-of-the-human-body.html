This invention relates to a device for pneumatically compressing parts of the human body.<br>
This device is intended to apply pressure manually to any desired part of the human body. Compressing an affected part of the body is often found to reduce swelling and alleviate discomfort of the affected part of the body. Filarial swellings respond positively to compression and is a treatment recommended by doctors.<br>
The device according to this invention may be used where uniform application of pressure is required but will be described hereinafter with reference to filarial swellings of the limbs without limiting its scope.<br>
Filaria is caused by a parasite which infects the body through mosquito bites. The paras ite grows ins ide the human body, matures and produces microfilarial parasites. These microfilarial parasites are transferred to mosquitos while they suck infecteed blood from an affected person and grow inside them for a period. They re-enter the human body when the infested mosquito bites a person again repeating the cycle. Thus a person can get infected repeatedly from his own blood and from others blood.<br>
These parasites live inside lymphatic system which carries a body fluid called lymph. Repeated infection causes blockage of the lymphat ic tubes causing accumulat ion of lymphatic fluid therein which is manifested by the swelling of the affected area.<br><br>
It is noticed that the swelling increases with repeated attacks. After some time, the skin of the affected area becomes thick and the limb becomes thick, simulating the appearance of an elephant's leg. This stage of the disease is known as elephantiasis or advanced lymphoedema, which is not curable. Swelling can only be reduced by different methods and life-long care and treatment are essential to prevent any increase in the swe11ing.<br>
One of the methods adopted for reducing such swelling is by application of pneumatic compression of the affected area, which exerts uniform pressure over the area. This forces the accumulated lymph into the vascular system, thus reducing the swelling. The limb becomes lighter and hence the patient feels comfortable. Recurrence of fever is also reduced which in turn slows down the increase in swelling. This reduced state of swelling may be maintained by periodic compression of the affected area followed by wearing of pressure garments simultaneously with proper medication for treatment of filariasis.<br>
An  object of this invention is to develop a  simple  device<br>
for  compressing  the affected area which may be operated  by  an<br>
unskilled  person.   The  patient  need  not  visit  his  doctor<br>
when everytime /compression is necessary which may be carried  out  at<br>
home,  avoiding medical supervision.  The device  is  also  cost<br>
effective  thus making it affordable within  reason.   Electrical<br>
and electronic systems are not used in the device of the  subject<br>
invention, thus making its operation safe.<br><br>
The  device  consists  of a double  walled  hollow  tubular<br>
structure  which may  be  angularly  disposed  at  one  end   to<br>
correspond to the desired body contour. Openings are provided  on<br>
both  the ends of the tubular structure.  Additional opening may<br>
also be provided on the side walls of the structure to facilitate<br>
easy introduction of the affected part into the structure.   This<br>
opening may be provided with fastening means like  a  zip.   An<br>
inlet  and an  outlet are provided on the outer wall of the  body<br>
of  the structure and are connected to a manually  operable  pump<br>
or and  to a pressure gauge/manometer respectively.   The  inlet  is<br>
connected  to the pump through a one way valve for releasing  the<br>
pressure  built  up within  the  double walled  structure  when<br>
required.    The  pressure  gauge  connected  to  the   structure<br>
indicates  the  pressure build up within the structure  when  the<br>
pump is operated.<br>
The device for pneumatically compressing parts of the  human<br>
body  according to this invention comprises an inflatable  double<br>
walled  hollow  tubular  structure, the outer wall  of  the  said<br>
structure  being provided with an inlet connected to  a  manually<br>
operable  pump,  through a one way valve for inflating  the  said<br>
structure, and an outlet connected to a pressure gauge, the  said<br>
when necessary<br>
inflatable structure 	 angularly disposed/^o  enwrap<br>
the contours of the human body.<br>
known The  structure may    be made  from any/ durable  pressure<br>
resistant  material.    One end of the tubular structure  may  be<br>
closed.<br><br>
This  invention will now be described with reference to single  figure in the accompanying drawing which shows a  device which is applicable for compressing human limbs.<br>
Reference letter B shows the body of the double walled inflatable structure which is angularly disposed to adapt to human limb. The angularly disposed portion is shown by reference letter A. An inlet IL and an outlet OL are provided on the outer wall of the structure. Manually operated pump (not shown explicitly in the drawings) is indicated by MP and the pressure gauge by PG. 0, and 02 represent the ends of the tubular structure which are open.<br>
For easy application of the structure around the human bodyj the sides of the structure may be provided with an opening which may run through the desired length of the structure. The two walls are tightly sealed on alt sides. The opening on the sides may be provided with fastening means such as zip or velcrum to join the two sides after application. One way valve to release pressure from within the structure is housed at the inlet for air from the pump.<br>
Method of using the device.<br>
The fastening device is opened and the leg is introduced into the body of the structure whereafter the fastening means is closed such that the structure encases the affected limb. The pump is operated manually to let in air through the one way valve into  the  space  within  the  double  walls  of  the  structure.<br><br>
Pressure is monitored with the help of the manometer connected to the outlet and the required pressure is maintained as desired or as prescribed by the doctor for a predetermined period. The valve is then released to reduce the pressure and the cycle is repeated till the swelling is reduced and the patient is comfortable.<br>
The  tubular  structure  may  be  made  from  any  pressure withstanding and skin friendly fabric.<br>
Though  the  device  has been described with  reference  to<br>
filarially  affected  swelling, it is equally applicable  in  the<br>
case  of  non-filarial lymphoedema, venous oedema,  stiffness  of<br>
or hand/shoulders and the 1 ike where uni form pressure application is<br>
required.<br><br><br>
