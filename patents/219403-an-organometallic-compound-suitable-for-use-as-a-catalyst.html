				<td>ESTEmFICATION CATALYSTS<br>
The invention concerns esterification catalysts and in particular<br>
esterification catalysts which comprise novel organotitanium, organozirconium or<br>
organoaluminium compounds.<br>
Organotitanium compounds and, in particular, titanium alkoxides or<br>
orthoesters are known as catalysts for esterification processes. During the<br>
esterification, these compounds are frequently converted to insoluble<br>
compounds of titanium which result in a hazy product. The presence of a haze<br>
is a particular disadvantage in polyesters which have a high viscosity and/or high<br>
melting point and are therefore difficult to filter. Furthermore, many<br>
organotitanium compounds which are effective catalysts in the manufacture of<br>
polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate are known to produce<br>
unacceptable yellowing in the final polymer. Our co-pending application,<br>
published as GB 2 314 081 relates to an esterification process in which these<br>
problems are partially solved but there is still a need for a catalyst which induces<br>
little or no yellowing in a polyester produced using the catalyst.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved catalyst for<br>
a process for preparing esters.<br>
According to the invention, an organometallic compound suitable for use<br>
as a catalyst for the preparation of an ester comprises the reaction product of an<br>
orthoester or condensed orthoester of titanium, zirconium or aluminium, an<br>
alcohol containing at least two hydroxyl groups, an organophosphorus<br>
compound containing at least one P-OH group and a base.<br>
Also according to the invention, a process for the preparation of an ester<br>
comprises carrying out an esterification reaction in the presence of a catalyst<br>
comprising the reaction product of an orthoester or condensed orthoester of<br>
titanium, zirconium or aluminium, an alcohol containing at least two hydroxyl<br>
groups, an organophosphorus compound containing at least one P-OH group<br>
and a base.<br>
In a further embodiment the organometallic compound suitable for use<br>
as a catalyst in an esterification process comprises the reaction product of an<br>
orthoester or condensed orthoester of titanium, zirconium or aluminium, an<br>
alcohol containing at least two hydroxyl groups, an organophosphorus<br>
compound containing at least one P-OH group, a base and a 2-hydroxy<br>
carboxylic acid.<br>
The organometallic compound of the invention is the reaction product of<br>
a titanium, zirconium or aluminium orthoester or condensed orthoester, an<br>
alcohol containing at least two hydroxyl groups, an organophosphorus<br>
compound containing at least one P-OH group and a base. Preferably, the<br>
orthoester has the formula M(OR)4 or AI(OR)3 where M is titanium or zirconium<br>
and R is an alkyl group. More preferably R contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms and<br>
particularly suitable orthoesters include tetraisopropoxy titanium, tetra-n-butoxy<br>
titanium, tetra-n-propoxy zirconium, tetra-n-butoxy zirconium and<br>
tetra-iso-butoxy aluminium.<br>
The condensed orthoesters suitable for preparing the compounds of this<br>
invention are typically prepared by careful hydrolysis of titanium, zirconium or<br>
aluminium orthoesters. Titanium or zirconium condensed orthoesters are<br>
frequently represented by the formula<br>
R10[M(OR1)2O]nR1<br>
in which R1 represents an alkyl group and M represents titanium, or zirconium.<br>
Preferably, n is less than 20 and more preferably is less than 10. Preferably, R1<br>
contains 1 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably, R1 contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms<br>
and useful condensed orthoesters include the compounds known as polybutyl<br>
titanate, polyisopropyl titanate and polybutyl zirconate.<br>
Preferably, the alcohol containing at least two hydroxyl groups is a<br>
dihydric alcohol and can be a 1,2-diol such as 1,2-ethanediol or 1,2-propanediol,<br>
a 1,3-diol such as 1,3-propanediol, a 1,4-diol such as 1,4-butanediol, a diol<br>
containing non-terminal hydroxyl groups such as 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol or a<br>
dihydric alcohol containing a longer chain such as diethylene glycol or a<br>
polyethylene glycol. Preferred dihydric alcohols are 1,2-ethanediol and<br>
diethylene glycol. The organometallic compound can also be prepared from a<br>
polyhydric alcohol such as glycerol, trimethylolpropane or pentaerythritol.<br>
Preferably, the organometallic compound useful as a catalyst is prepared<br>
by reacting a dihydric alcohol with an orthoester or condensed orthoester in a<br>
ratio of from 1 to 16 moles of dihydric alcohol to each mole of titanium, zirconium<br>
or aluminium. More preferably, the reaction product contains 2 to 12 moles of<br>
dihydric alcohol per mole of titanium, zirconium or aluminium and most<br>
preferably 4 to 8 moles dihydric alcohol per mole of titanium, zirconium or<br>
aluminium.<br>
The organophosphorus compound which contains at least one P-OH<br>
group can be selected from a number of organophosphorus compounds<br>
including phosphates, pyrophosphates, phosphonates, phosphinates and<br>
phosphites.<br>
Preferably, the organophosphorus compound is a substituted or<br>
unsubstituted alkyl phosphate, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl phosphate or a<br>
phosphate of an alkylaryl glycol ether or an alkyl glycol ether. Preferred<br>
compounds include monoalkyl acid phosphates and dialkyl acid phosphates and<br>
mixtures of these. Particularly convenient organophosphorus compounds are the<br>
compounds commercially available as alkyl acid phosphates and containing,<br>
principally, a mixture of mono- and di-alkyl phosphate esters. When an alkyl<br>
phosphate is used, the organic group preferably contains up to 20 carbon atoms,<br>
more preferably up to 8 carbon atoms and, most preferably, up to 6 carbon<br>
; atoms. When alkylaryl or alkyl glycol ether phosphates are used the carbon<br>
chain length is preferably up to 18 carbon atoms and, more preferably, 6 to 12<br>
carbon atoms. Particularly preferred organophosphorus compounds include<br>
butyl acid phosphate, polyethylene glycol phosphates and aryl polyethylene<br>
glycol phosphates.<br>
i The amount of organophosphorus compound present in the reaction<br>
product of the invention is usually in the range 0.1 to 4.0 mole of phosphorus to<br>
1 mole of metal (titanium, zirconium or aluminium), preferably in the range 0.1 to<br>
2.0 mole phosphorus to 1 mole metal and most preferably in the range 0.1 to 1.0<br>
mole phosphorus to 1 mole metal.<br>
A base is also used in preparing the reaction product of the invention.<br>
The base is generally an inorganic base and suitable bases include sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide, but organic bases<br>
such as tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide or choline hydroxide [trimethyl-<br>
(2-hydroxyethyl)ammonium hydroxide] can also be used. Usually, the amount of<br>
base used is in the range 0.1 to 4.0 mole base per mole of metal (titanium,<br>
zirconium or aluminium). The preferred amount is in the range 0.1 to 2.0 mole<br>
base per mole of metal and, frequently, the amount of base present is in the<br>
range 0.1 to 1.0 mole base per mole of titanium, zirconium or aluminium.<br>
When 2-hydroxy carboxylic acids are used to prepare the products of the<br>
i invention, preferred acids used include lactic acid, citric acid, malic acid and<br>
tartaric acid. Some suitable acids are supplied as hydrates or as aqueous<br>
mixtures and can be used in this form. When a 2-hydroxy acid is present, the<br>
preferred molar ratio of acid to titanium, zirconium or aluminium in the reaction<br>
product is 0.5 to 4 moles per mole of titanium, zirconium or aluminium. More<br>
preferably the catalyst contains 1.0 to 3.5 moles of 2-hydroxy acid per mole of<br>
titanium, zirconium or aluminium.<br>
The organometallic compound can be prepared by mixing the<br>
components (orthoester or condensed orthoester, alcohol containing at least two<br>
hydroxyl groups, organophosphorus compound and base) with removal, if<br>
desired, of any by-product, (e.g. isopropy! alcohol when the orthoester is<br>
tetraisopropoxytitanium), at any appropriate stage. In one preferred method the<br>
orthoester or condensed orthoester and a dihydric alcohol are mixed and,<br>
subsequently, a base is added, followed by the organophosphorus compound.<br>
When a 2-hydroxy carboxylic acid is also present in the reaction product, this is<br>
usually added to the orthoester or condensed orthoester before the<br>
organophosphorus compound is added. Alternatively, all or part of the 2-hydroxy<br>
carboxylic acid can be neutralised with the base and the resulting salt added to<br>
the other components of the reaction mixture, including, if desired, a further<br>
portion of the base.<br>
The esterification reaction of the process of the invention can be any<br>
reaction by which an ester is produced. The reaction may be (i) a direct<br>
esterification in which a carboxylic acid or its anhydride and an alcohol react to<br>
form an ester or (ii) a transesterification (alcoholysis) in which a first alcohol<br>
reacts with a first ester to produce an ester of the first alcohol and a second<br>
alcohol produced by cleavage of the first ester or (iii) a transesterification<br>
reaction in which two esters are reacted to form two different esters by exchange<br>
of alkoxy radicals. Direct esterification or transesterification can be used in the<br>
production of polymeric esters and a preferred process of the invention<br>
comprises a polyesterification process. Many carboxylic acids and anhydrides<br>
can be used in direct esterification including saturated and unsaturated<br>
monocarboxylic acids and anhydrides of such acids such as stearic acid,<br>
isostearic acid, capric acid, caproic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, palmitoleic<br>
acid, triacontanoic acid, benzoic acid, methyl benzoic acid, salicylic acid and<br>
rosin acids such as abietic acid, dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid,<br>
isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, sebacic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid,<br>
succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid and<br>
pamoic acid and anhydrides of these acids and polycarboxylic acids such as<br>
trimellitic acid, citric acid, trimesic acid, pyromellitic acid and anhydrides of these<br>
acids. Alcohols frequently used for direct esterification include aliphatic straight<br>
chain and branched monohydric alcohols such as butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl and<br>
stearyl alcohols, dihydric alcohols such as 1,2-ethanediol, 1,3-propanediol,<br>
1,4-butanediol and 1,6-hexanediol and polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol and<br>
pentaerythritol. A preferred process of the invention comprises reacting<br>
2-ethylhexanol with phthalic anhydride to form bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate.<br>
The esters employed in an alcoholysis reaction are generally the lower<br>
homologues such as methyl, ethyl and propyl esters since, during the<br>
esterification reaction, it is usual to eliminate the displaced alcohol by distillation.<br>
These lower homologue esters of the acids suitable for direct esterification are<br>
suitable for use in the transesterification process according to the invention.<br>
Frequently (meth)acrylate esters of longer chain alcohols are produced by<br>
alcoholysis of esters such as methyl acrylate, methyl methacryiate, ethyl acrylate<br>
and ethyl methacrylate. Typical alcohols used in alcoholysis reactions include<br>
butyl, hexyl, n-octyl and 2-ethyl hexyl alcohols and substituted alcohols such as<br>
dimethylaminoethanol.<br>
When the esterification reaction is a transesterification between two<br>
esters, generally the esters will be selected so as to produce a volatile product<br>
ester which can be removed by distillation.<br>
As mentioned hereinbefore, polymeric esters can be produced by<br>
processes involving direct esterification or transesterification and a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment of the esterification process of the invention is a<br>
polyesterification reaction in the presence of the catalyst described hereinbefore.<br>
In a polyesterification reaction polybasic acids or esters of polybasic acids are<br>
usually reacted with poiyhydric alcohols to produce a polymeric ester. Linear<br>
polyesters are often produced from dibasic acids such as those mentioned<br>
hereinbefore or esters of said dibasic acids and dihydric alcohols. Preferred<br>
polyesterification reactions according to the invention include the reaction of<br>
terephthalic acid or dimethyl terephthalate with 1,2-ethanediol {ethylene glycol)<br>
to produce polyethylene terephthalate or with 1,4-butanediol {butylene glycol) to<br>
produce polybutylene terephthalate or reaction of naphthalene dicarboxylic acid<br>
with 1,2-ethanediol to produce polyethylene naphthalenate. Other glycols such<br>
as 1,3-propanediol, 1,6-hexanediol and poiyhydric alcohols such as glycerol,<br>
trimethylolpropane and pentaerythritoi are also suitable for preparing polyesters.<br>
The esterification reaction of the invention can be carried out using any<br>
appropriate, known technique for an esterification reaction.<br>
A typical process for the preparation of polyethylene terephthalate<br>
comprises two stages. In the first stage terephthalic acid or dimethyl<br>
terephthalate is reacted with 1,2-ethanediol to form a prepolymer and the<br>
by-product water or methanol is removed. The prepolymer is subsequently<br>
heated in a second stage to remove 1,2-ethanediol and form a long chain<br>
polymer. Either or both these stages may comprise an esterification process<br>
according to this invention.<br>
In direct esterification the acid or anhydride and an excess of alcohol are<br>
typically heated, if necessary in a solvent, in the presence of the catalyst. Water<br>
is a by-product of the reaction and this is removed, as an azeotrope with a<br>
boiling mixture of solvent and/or alcohol. Generally, the solvent and/or alcohol<br>
mixture which is condensed is immiscible with water which is therefore<br>
separated before solvent and/or alcohol are returned to the reaction vessel.<br>
When reaction is complete the excess alcohol and, when used, solvent are<br>
evaporated. In view of the fact that the catalysts of the invention do not normally<br>
form insoluble species, it is not generally necessary to remove them from the<br>
reaction mixture, as is frequently necessary with conventional catalysts. A typical<br>
direct esterification reaction is the preparation of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate<br>
which is prepared by mixing phthalic anhydride and 2-ethyl hexanol. An initial<br>
reaction to form a monoester is fast but the subsequent conversion of the<br>
monoester to diester is carried out by refluxing in the presence of the catalyst at<br>
a temperature of 180-200°C until all the water has been removed. Subsequently<br>
the excess alcohol is removed.<br>
In an alcoholysis reaction, the ester, first alcohol and catalyst are mixed<br>
and, generally, the product alcohol (second alcohol) is removed by distillation<br>
often as an azeotrope with the ester. Frequently it is necessary to fractionate<br>
the vapour mixture produced from the alcoholysis in order to ensure that the<br>
second alcohol is separated effectively without significant loss of product ester<br>
or first alcohol. The conditions under which alcoholysis reactions are carried out<br>
depend principally upon the components of the reaction and generally<br>
components are heated to the boiling point of the mixture used.<br>
A preferred process of the invention is the preparation of polyethylene<br>
terephthalate. A typical batch production of polyethylene terephthaiate is carried<br>
out by charging terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol to a reactor along with<br>
catalyst if desired and heating the contents to 260 - 270°C under a pressure of<br>
about 0.3 MPa. Reaction commences as the acid dissolves at about 23CTC and<br>
water is removed. The product is transferred to a second autoclave reactor and<br>
catalyst is added, if needed. The reactor is heated to 285 - 310°C under an<br>
eventual vacuum of 100 Pa to remove ethylene glycol by-product. The molten<br>
product ester is discharged from the reactor, cooled and chipped. The chipped<br>
polyester may be then subjected to solid state polymerisation, if appropriate.<br>
The amount of catalyst used in the esterification process of the invention<br>
generally depends upon the titanium, zirconium or aluminium content, expressed<br>
as Ti, Zr or Al, of the catalyst. Usually the amount is from 30 to 1000 parts per<br>
million (ppm) of metal on weight of product ester for direct or transesterification<br>
reactions. Preferably, the amount is from 30 to 450 ppm of metal on weight of<br>
product ester and more preferably 50 to 450 ppm of metal on weight of product<br>
ester. In polyesterification reactions the amount used is generally expressed as<br>
a proportion of the weight of product polyester and is usually from 5 to 500 ppm<br>
expressed as Ti, Zr or Al based on product polyester. Preferably the amount is<br>
from 5 to 100 ppm expressed as Ti, Zr or Al based on product polyester.<br>
The products of this invention have been shown to be effective catalysts<br>
for producing esters and polyesters at an economical rate without leading to<br>
haze in the final product and with a reduced amount of yellowing of polyesters in<br>
comparison to known catalysts. They have also been shown to be stable against<br>
precipitation from polyester products when aqueous base or phosphoric acid is<br>
added to such products.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following examples.<br>
Ethylene glycol (496.0 g, 8.00 moles) was added from a dropping funnel<br>
i to stirred titanium n-butoxide (340 g, 1.00 mole) in a 1 litre fishbowl flask fitted<br>
with stirrer, condenser and thermometer. An aqueous solution of sodium<br>
hydroxide, containing 32% NaOH by weight, (125 g, 1.00 mole) was added to<br>
the reaction flask slowly with mixing to yield a clear pale yellow liquid. To this<br>
liquid was then added a polyethylene glycol phosphate having a carbon chain<br>
length of 12 carbon atoms and available commercially under the trade name<br>
Knapsack 194, (215.8 g, 0.55 mole of phosphorus) and the resulting mixture<br>
was stirred for 1 hour to produce a pale yellow liquid with a Ti content of 4.07%<br>
by weight.<br>
The method of Example 1 was repeated with the difference that 0.28<br>
mole based on phosphorus (107.9 g) Knapsack 194 was added. The product<br>
was a pale yellow liquid with a Ti content of 4.49% by weight.<br>
he method of Example 1 was repeated but 0.50 mole, based on<br>
phosphorus (91.0 g) commercial butyl acid phosphate (mixture of mono- and<br>
di-butyl acid phosphates) was used in place of the Knapsack 194. The product<br>
was a pale yellow liquid with a Ti content of 4.56% by weight.<br>
The method of Example 3 was repeated except that the amount of butyl<br>
acid phosphate used was 1.00 mole based on phosphorus (182.0 g). The<br>
product was a pale yellow liquid with a Ti content of 4.20% by weight.<br>
The method of Example 1 was repeated but 0.64 mole based on<br>
phosphorus (431.6g) of an aryl polyethylene glycol phosphate, sold<br>
commercially under the trade name Knapsack 123 was used in place of the<br>
Knapsack 194. The product was a pale yellow liquid with a Ti content of 3.45%<br>
by weight.<br>
The method of Example 5 was repeated except that the amount of<br>
Knapsack 123 used was 0.32 mole based on phosphorus (215.8 g). The product<br>
was a pale yellow liquid with a Ti content of 4.08% by weight.<br>
Ethylene glycol (248.0 g, 4.0 moles) was added dropwise to stirred<br>
titanium isopropoxide (142 g, 0.5 moles) in a 1 litre fishbowl flask fitted with a<br>
stirrer, thermometer and condenser. Aqueous potassium lactate (60% by weight,<br>
213.5 g, 1.0 mole) was added from a dropping funnel to the clear solution which<br>
was then heated to 65° C under vacuum and volatile solvents were removed to<br>
yield a clear, pale yellow liquid. A portion (82.19 g, 0.1 mole Ti) was weighed into<br>
a 250 ml conical flask and commercial butyl acid phosphate (9.1 g, 0.05 moles<br>
based on phosphorus) was added from a dropping funnel with stirring. The final<br>
product was a clear, pale yellow liquid (Ti content 5.26% by weight).<br>
Ethylene glycol (49.6 g, 0.8 moles) was added by dropping funnel to<br>
stirred titanium n-butoxide (34.0 g, 0.1 mole) in a 250 ml conical flask. An<br>
aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide containing 32% NaOH by weight (12.5 g,<br>
0.1 mole) was added followed by a polyethylene glycol phosphate having a<br>
carbon chain length of 12 and available commercially under the trade name<br>
Knapsack 122 (32.3 g, 0.05 moles based on phosphorus). The resulting product<br>
was a white solid having a Ti content of 3.74% by weight.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Ethylene glycol (49.6 g, 0.8 mole) was added by dropping funnel to<br>
stirred titanium n-butoxide (34.0 g, 0.1 mole) in a 250 ml conical flask. An<br>
aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide containing 32% NaOH by weight (12.5 g,<br>
0.1 mole) was added followed by dibutyl phosphate (10.5 g, 0.05 mole). The<br>
resulting product was a hazy liquid having a measured Ti content of 4.56% by<br>
Monoethylene glycol (49.6 g, 0.8 mole) was added by dropping funnel to<br>
stirred condensed titanium alkoxide known as polybutyl titanate (Tilcom® PBT)<br>
(Ti content 20.0% by wt) (24.2 g, 0.10 moles Ti) in a 250 ml conical flask. An<br>
aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide containing 32% NaOH by weight (12.5 g,<br>
0.1 mole) was added followed by a commercial butyl phosphate (9.1 g, O.OSmole<br>
based on phosphorus). The resulting product was a white solid having a Ti<br>
content of 5.03% by weight.<br>
Diethylene glycol (848 g, 8.0 moles) was added by dropping funnel to<br>
stirred zirconium n-propoxide (Tilcom® NPZ) (445 g, 1.0 mole Zr) in a 2 litre-flask.<br>
A portion of this solution (129.3 g, 0.1 moles Zr) was weighed into a 250 ml<br>
5 conical flask and an aqueous solution containing 45% choline hydroxide by<br>
weight (13.45 g, 0.05 moles) was added followed by a commercial butyl<br>
phosphate (9.1 g, 0.05 moles based on phosphorus). The resulting product was<br>
a clear yellow solution having a Zr content of 6.01% by weight.<br>
Diethylene glycol (84.8 g, 0.8 mole) was added by dropping funnel to<br>
stirred aluminium sec-butoxide (24.6 g, 0.1 mole) in a 250 ml conical flask. An<br>
aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide containing 32% NaOH by weight (12.5 g,<br>
0.1 mole) was added followed by a commercial butyl phosphate (9.1 g, O.OSmole<br>
based on phosphorus). The resulting product was a clear solid gel having an Al<br>
content of 2.06% by weight.<br>
Ethylene glycol (24.8 g, 0.4 mole) was added by dropping funnel to<br>
stirred titanium n-butoxide (34.0 g, 0.1 mole) in a 250 ml conical flask. An<br>
aqueous solution containing 45% by weight of choline hydroxide (26.93 g,<br>
O.lmole) was added followed by a commercial butyl phosphate (18.2 g, 0.1 mole<br>
based on phosphorus). The resulting product was a clear pale yellow liquid<br>
having a Ti content of 4.62% by weight.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Ethylene glycol (99.2 g, 1.6 mole) was added by dropping funnel to<br>
stirred titanium n-butoxide (68.1 g, 0.2 mole) in a 250 ml conical flask. An<br>
aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide containing 32% by weight NaOH (25.0 g,<br>
0.2 mole) was added followed by commercial butyl phosphate (18.2 g, 0.1 mole).<br>
The resulting clear liquid product was transferred to a 500 ml rotary evaporator<br>
flask and solvents were removed under vacuum at 95° C to yield a hazy liquid<br>
having a Ti content of 10.54% by weight.<br>
The products of Examples 1,3, 5 and 7 were tested at a concentration of<br>
170 ppm Ti as catalysts for the preparation of bis(2-ethylhexyl phthalate).<br>
Titanium tetra-isopropoxide [TKOPrOJ was used as a comparative catalyst.<br>
The apparatus was a 1-litre, 4-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a<br>
thermometer, rubber seal, a tube dipping below the surface of the reactants and<br>
a Dean and Stark apparatus. The equipment was operated under reduced<br>
pressure using an oil vacuum pump connected to two water condensers fitted<br>
above the Dean and Stark apparatus. The dip tube in the flask was connected<br>
to a supply of oxygen-free nitrogen. This provided a nitrogen bleed to aid the<br>
removal of water during the reaction.<br>
1.0 mole (148 g) phthalic anhydride was added to 2.42 moles (315 g)<br>
2-ethylhexanol. The mixture was heated to dissolve the phthalic anhydride and<br>
the nitrogen flow started.<br>
A weighed amount of catalyst was added to the reaction flask in a<br>
porcelain boat before heating the mixture, except for Ti(OPrf)4 which was added<br>
as a solution in 2-ethylhexanol via the rubber seal with a syringe, below the<br>
surface of the reactants. The reaction mixture was heated to and maintained at<br>
a vigorous reflux at 200°C by suitable adjustment of the -heating rate and<br>
vacuum. The water produced was removed substantially as quickly as it was<br>
formed and collected in the Dean and Stark apparatus.<br>
The progress of the reaction was followed by withdrawing samples at<br>
intervals by means of a syringe fitted with a 30 cm needle inserted through the<br>
rubber seal. Each sample was added to a known weight (approximately 100 g)<br>
i of cold alcohol to quench the reaction, weighed and titrated against standard<br>
potassium hydroxide solution in ethanol using bromophenol blue as indicator.<br>
The results were used to calculate the amount of unreacted half-ester present.<br>
The reaction was continued for a total of 160 minutes.<br>
The products of Examples 3, 5 and 8 to 14 were tested at a<br>
concentration of 164 ppm Ti or Al or 340 ppm Zr based on reactants as catalysts<br>
for the preparation of monoethyleneglycoi benzoate. Titanium isopropoxide<br>
[Ti(OPri)4] and antimony oxide were used as comparative examples.<br>
The apparatus was a 1-litre, 4-necked round bottom flask fitted with<br>
thermometer, rubber seal, dip tube below the surface of reactants and Dean and<br>
(Table Removed)  Stark apparatus. A glass column (30 cm) containing glass beads was attached<br>
between the reaction flask and Dean and Stark apparatus. The equipment was<br>
operated under vacuum using an oil vacuum pump connected to a water<br>
condenser above the Dean and Stark apparatus. The dip tube was connected to<br>
a supply of oxygen-free nitrogen and provided a nitrogen bleed to aid the<br>
removal of water during the reaction.<br>
0.5 mole (61.06 g) benzoic acid was added to 10 moles (620 g)<br>
monoethylene glycol. The excess of glycol was used to prevent benzoic acid<br>
sublimation and to minimise polycondensation reactions. The catalysts were<br>
added as solutions or suspensions in the monoethyleneglycol to ensure good<br>
dispersion. The mixture was heated to dissolve the benzoic acid and the<br>
nitrogen flow started. The temperature was raised to 180° C and after 5 minutes<br>
a slight vacuum was applied and the temperature raised to 200° C. Distillation of<br>
the water/monoethylene glycol commenced at about 150° C and the reactions<br>
were maintained at a vigorous reflux at 190 to 193° C by suitable adjustment of<br>
heating rate and vacuum. The water produced was removed with<br>
monoethyleneglycol and collected via the Dean and Stark apparatus.<br>
Progress of the reaction was followed by withdrawing samples at<br>
intervals by means of a syringe fitted with a 30 cm needle inserted through the<br>
rubber seal. Each sample was added to a known weight (approximately 100 g)<br>
of cold alcohol to quench the reaction, weighed and titrated against standard<br>
potassium hydroxide solution in ethanol using bromophenol blue as indicator.<br>
The results of acid value (AV) were used to calculate the percentage conversion<br>
to benzoate ester. The reactions were each monitored for a total of 180 minutes.<br>
The results are given in Table 2 below.<br>
(Table Removed) mspec Select Antimony Oxide (3%wt/wt monoethylene glycol) at 164 ppm Sb.<br>
'Analysis of supernatant liquor.<br>
The results demonstrate that the catalysts of the invention are effective<br>
for the esterification reaction of benzoate esters and produce products with<br>
lower levels of DEG by-product than antimony oxide or conventional titanium<br>
catalysts.<br>
A polycondensation reaction was carried out in a mechanically-stirred<br>
300 ml glass vessel fitted with side arm and cold trap for collection of<br>
monoethyleneglyco!. A thermostatically controlled ceramic heating element was<br>
used to provide heat and an oil vacuum pump was connected to the cold trap. A<br>
nitrogen blanket was provided via a connection to the cold trap.<br>
Polyethylene terephthalate was prepared from<br>
(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate polymer precursors supplied by ICI Polyesters. Two<br>
samples were used; sample A was a short chain polymer containing<br>
approximately 4 ethylene terephthalate repeating units whilst sample B was<br>
technically pure bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate. Sample A also contained<br>
approximately 5 mol% acid end groups.<br>
100 g of (hydroxy)terephthalate polymer precursor was placed in the<br>
reaction flask under a nitrogen flow, followed by a dilute solution of catalyst (Ti<br>
added at 30 ppm) in monoethyleneglycol. This was heated with stirring to 250° C<br>
for 20-25 minutes at which point a stabiliser (phosphoric acid, 100 ppm) and<br>
cobalt acetate tetrahydrate (250 ppm) were added, again as solutions in<br>
monoethyleneglycol. The nitrogen flow was stopped and vacuum applied<br>
steadily to 100 Pa. After 20-25 minutes the temperature was increased steadily<br>
from 250° C to 290° C. The power consumption of the electrical stirrer increased<br>
with the viscosity of the polymer and the stirrer revolutions dropped. The<br>
revolutions were monitored until a predetermined value for the peripheral speed<br>
of the agitator tip (15km/h) was reached at which point the vacuum was broken<br>
with nitrogen and the molten polymer discharged and quenched into cold water.<br>
It was then dried for 10-14 hours at 50° C in a vacuum oven.<br>
The colour of the polymer was measured using a Colorgard System<br>
2000 Colorimeter. Common models to use for colour expression are the Hunter<br>
Lh, ah and bh or Cielab L*. a* and b* scales where the b-value in both describe<br>
yellowness. The yellowness of the polymer increases with b-value.<br>
The polymer molecular weights were measured by Gel Permeation<br>
These results indicate that the catalysts of the invention are active for the<br>
preparation of polyethylene terephthalate and are capable of producing polymer<br>
It has been postulated that one mechanism causing discolouration when<br>
titanium catalysts are used to prepare polyethylene terephthalate is interaction of<br>
the catalyst with a thermal decomposition product of polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
Catalysts of Examples 1 to 7 were assessed by mixing with one such<br>
decomposition product, diethyldihydroxy terephthalate (DEDHT) in toluene. The<br>
standard catalyst, titanium tetra-isopropoxide fTi(OPH)J was used for<br>
comparison and was added to 0.4 g DEDHT in 10 ml toluene. The catalysts of<br>
Examples 1 to 7 were added to DEDHT/toluene solution of a similar<br>
concentration in an amount sufficient to produce the same Ti concentration in<br>
the mixture and the colour of each of the mixtures was determined using a LICO<br>
200 spectrophotometer in 11 ml glass cuvettes. The results are given in. (Table Removed)<br><br><br><br>
