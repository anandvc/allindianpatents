				<td>PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF SILVER-BASED COMPOSITE<br>
POWDERS FOR ELECTRICAL CONTACT MATERIALS AND COMPOSITE<br>
POWDERS SO PRODUCED<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacture of silver-based<br>
composite powders for electrical contact materials. The invention relates also to<br>
electrical contact materials made from such composite powders.<br>
Electrical contact materials typically consist of silver with certain metal and/or<br>
oxide additives. The materials are chosen based on the intended use, such as the type of<br>
switching device, the switching current, and the electrical load. General requirements<br>
include low electrical wear, with high arc resistance, and low welding force with low<br>
contact resistance.<br>
Silver-based contact materials are predominantly used for switches which oper-<br>
ate in air under low voltage and high current conditions. Their major function is to<br>
secure operating performance during a lot of switching cycles, for example for a motor<br>
controlling device.<br>
Materials based on silver-tin oxide are frequently used for low voltage/high cujr-<br>
rent equipment, within a switching range of 100 - 3,000 A. Contact materials of this<br>
type generally have acceptable arc resistance, sufficient safety with respect to contact<br>
welding, comparable low material migration with low contact resistance and good<br>
<br>
overtemperature behaviour and practical processing properties.<br>
The oxide components (i.e. the "second phase oxides") used are typically se-<br>
lected with the goal of improving the contact properties, thus reducing the specific<br>
contact erosion and improving the resistance against contact welding. Typical oxide<br>
additives used for silver-based contact materials include tin oxide (SnO2), tungsten<br>
oxide (WO3), molybdenum oxide (M0O3). These oxides are chosen mainly based on<br>
their thermodynamic properties, as well as on their wetting behaviour in the Agliq.<br>
uid/oxide system (ref to Jeannot et al, IEEE Proceedings Holm Conference 1993, p.51)<br>
Silver based electrical contacts are normally made by powder metallurgy meth-<br>
ods starting from composite powder materials as precursors. These composite powders<br>
 <br>
may comprise silver powder and/or silver oxide powder along with second oxide pow-<br>
ders and optionally additives. Silver-based composite powders used as precursors for<br>
contact materials are typically made using one of the following processes:<br>
powder metallurgy mixing techniques;<br>
internal oxidation of alloying powders or compact bodies under elevated<br>
oxygen partial pressure; and<br>
chemically reductive precipitation of some or all of the components of<br>
the material.<br>
Further processing of the composite powders to semi-finished contacts or con-<br>
tact units, as a rule, takes place by cold isostatic compaction of the powders ("CIP"),<br>
followed by sintering and wire extrusion, and reforming to the end size.<br>
The powder metallurgy mixing techniques for producing composite powders<br>
comprise of mechanical homogenization of solid starting substances in powdered form<br>
in a mixer, for the most part using silver powder and/or silver oxide and the second<br>
<br>
oxide additive, but frequently also adding other additives or sintering aids. This method<br>
<br>
can be used either wet or dry, for instance with water etc, but is limited to relatively <br>
coarse powders.	<br>
The conventional mixing technique runs up against the technical limits in manu-<br>
facturing composite powders having extremely fine oxide dispersion. This problem applies to dry mixing as well as to wet mixing methods.<br>
According to F. Heringhaus et al (ref to article "On the improvement of disper-<br>
sion in Ag-Sn02 based contact materials", ICEC Conference, Stockholm, 2000), the<br>
minimum particle size for second oxides suitable for conventional dry and wet mixing<br>
techniques should be in the range of I to 2 Î¼m (i.e., 1,000 to 2,000 nm). With finer<br>
particles, a homogeneous intermixing is causing problems due to agglomeration. Thus,<br>
a homogeneous, very finely dispersed microstructure of the silver-based contact mate-<br>
rial is very difficult t6 obtain.<br>
For manufacturing of composite powders, wet chemical methods are known in<br>
the state of the art.EP 370 897 Bl discloses a process for manufacture of silver-tin<br>
oxide contact materials by a wet chemical method, wherein silver oxide is precipitated<br>
<br>
in the presence of tin oxide by adding a strong base. The precipitated silver oxide is<br>
subsequently heated to temperatures of 200 - 500oC in order to reduce the silver oxide<br>
 <br>
to metallic silver. The scope of this process is limited, since important additives and<br>
second phase oxides such as WO3 or M0O3 dissolve in a highly basic environment and<br>
thus do not reappear in the precipitated product. A specific mixing process is not dis-<br>
closed.<br>
DE 100 17 282 describes a process for producing composite powders based on<br>
silver-tin oxide by chemically reductive precipitation of silver onto particulate tin oxide<br>
whereby the silver compound and the reducing agent are simultaneously added. A<br>
conventional stirrer system is used. As the precipitation process takes place in a strongly<br>
acidic nitric acid environment, the second phase oxides (e.g., ZnO, WO3 oder M0O3)<br>
are attacked and dissolved. Therefore, the process cannot be used for manufacturing this<br>
type of contact materials.<br>
In summary, the presently known processes for manufacture of composite pow-<br>
ders for silver-based contacts are limited to specific oxide materials and are not suffi-<br>
cient in terms of broad applicability, process simplicity and cost. The manufacturing<br>
processes of composite powders for electrical contact materials with a homogeneous<br>
microstructure need further improvements.<br>
It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide an improved proc-<br>
ess for manufacture of silver-based composite powders suitable as precursors of electri-<br>
cal contact materials.<br>
It is a further objective of the present invention to influence the processing and<br>
contact properties of silver-based contact materials, having essentially conventional<br>
compositions, by an appropriate design of the manufacturing process, with the goal of<br>
obtaining a maximum homogeneity and a highly dispersed microstructure of the fin-<br>
ished contact material.<br>
The process should be, for example, versatile, simple, economical and cost-<br>
effective.<br>
These objectives are met by the processes and products of the present invention.<br>
Surprising improvements in the material and contact properties of silver-based contact:<br>
materials are obtained.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacture of silver-based<br>
composite powders for electrical contact materials. The invention relates also to<br>
electrical contact materials made from such composite powders.<br>
The process comprises a high energy dispersing process of wet silver oxide<br>
(Ag20) with additional second oxide components in aqueous suspension. The high<br>
energy dispersing process can be conducted by high shear mixing or by high energy<br>
milling. Preferably high speed dispersing units working at rotating speeds in the range<br>
of 5,000 to 30,000 rpm or high energy mills such as attritor mills are used.<br>
The new process is versatile, economical and offers access to a broad spectrum<br>
of contact materials. The silver-based composite powders made according to the new<br>
process yield contact materials with highly dispersed microstructures and superior<br>
material characteristics.<br>
For a better understanding of the present invention, reference is made to the following description taken in conjunction with the examples and figure.<br>
Brief Description of the Figures:<br>
Figure 1: A schematic drawing of an example of a process of the present inven-<br>
tion.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
In preparing the preferred embodiments of the present invention, various alterna-<br>
tives may be used to facilitate the objectives of the invention. These embodiments are<br>
presented to aid in an understanding of the invention and are not intended to, and should<br>
not be construed to, limit the invention in any way. All alternatives, modifications and<br>
equivalents that may become obvious to those of ordinary skill upon a reading of the<br>
present disclosure are included within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
The present invention discloses a process for producing a composite powder for<br>
electrical contact materials, comprising a high-energy dispersing process of wet silver<br>
oxide (Ag20) with additional second phase oxide components in aqueous suspension. |<br>
This high-energy dispersing process comprises a high-shear mixing process or, alterna-<br>
 <br>
lively, a high-energy milling process. In both alternative embodiments, wet silver oxide<br>
(Ag20) is used as a starting material.<br>
In the following, the process of the invention is characterized in further detail.<br>
The required wet silver oxide (Ag2O) can be prepared from a commercially<br>
available aqueous silver nitrate solution (AgNO3). By addition of a strong base (NaOH<br>
or KOH), silver oxide (Ag20) is precipitated in form of an aqueous alkaline suspension.<br>
After washing and removal of nitrate ions, the material is separated to yield a wet Ag2O<br>
powder. The AgaO starting material may additionally comprise various amounts of<br>
hydroxy groups (in form of AgOH) and/or carbonate groups (in form of Ag2CO3,<br>
AgHCO3), depending on the preparation process.<br>
<br>
Generally, wet Ag2O should be used in the high-energy dispersing process of the<br>
present invention in order to facilitate deagglomeration of the Ag2O particles in the <br>
<br>
subsequent dispersing process. It was found that the use of wet Ag2O as a starting mate-<br>
rial in combination with the application of high-energy dispersing yields the best results.<br>
Suitable contents of residual moisture in the Ag2O starting material are in the<br>
range of 5 to 25 wt.-% water, preferably in the range of 10 to 20 wt.-% of water, based<br>
on the total weight of Ag2O.	<br>
It was found that high shear forces should be applied to achieve homogeneous!<br>
mixing of the wet Ag2O with the additional components.<br>
In the first embodiment of the process, this is obtained by use of specific high<br>
shear mixing devices, which work at high speed. Such high speed dispersers may con-<br>
sist of a driven vertical shaft and a high shear disk type blade, which rotates at very high<br>
speed and creates a radial flow pattern within a stationary mixing vessel. Such devices<br>
are firequently referred to as "dissolver units".<br>
Preferably, the dispersing generator of the dispersing unit comprises of a ro-<br>
tor/stator system. As an example, the dispersing head may consist of two sets of concen-<br>
tric teeth rings. One of them is fixed and does not move - the stator; the other is driven<br>
by a motor through the shaft and turns aroxmd inside the stator - the rotor. The shear<br>
forces and bounce effects which are created between the running rotor and the stator<br>
treat the product mechanically. From various manufacturers, rotor/stator systems with<br>
two, three or even four sets of concentric teeth rings are commercially available. Exam-<br>
 <br>
ples for suitable high shear mixers based on the rotor/stator principle are high shear<br>
dispersers, made for example by Silverson Machines Inc. or Ross Corp.<br>
A particularly suitable device is the dispersing unit "Polytron PT" manufactured<br>
by Kinematica, CH-6014 Littau-Luzem (Switzerland). This device is characterized by a<br>
rotor/stator head with a diameter of 60 mm, comprising of three teeth rings. The high<br>
shear mixing system applies very high shear forces to the water/oxide powder suspen-<br>
sion and thus generates a homogeneous mixture of the components, even when using <br>
<br>
very fine second oxide powders.	<br>
Generally, suitable mixing devices for the process may rotate at very high speed<br>
in the range of 5,000 to 30,000 rpm, preferably in the range of 5,000 to 20,000 rpm.<br>
In the second embodiment of the process, high energy attritor mills, vibration<br>
energy mills, pearl mills and/or ball mills may be used. In parallel to the mixing proc-<br>
ess, a certain milling and deagglomeration effect is obtained here due to the presence of<br>
grinding media. Preferably, attritor mills may be used; however, the type of grinding<br>
media must be carefully selected in order to prevent contamination of the composite<br>
powder by ingredients of the grinding media. Ceramic grinding media, based for exam-<br>
ple on zirconia, are preferred.<br>
A schematic drawing of an example of the process of the present invention is<br>
shown in Figure 1. The high-energy dispersing step of the starting components (wet<br>
silver oxide and second phase oxides) is conducted in aqueous suspension for time<br>
periods of 5 to 90 minutes, preferably in a two- or multi-stage process using different<br>
rotating speeds. The temperature in the mixing vessel is held in the range of 20 to 60oC,<br>
excess heating of the mixture should be avoided.<br>
Mixing vessels made of stainless steel, plastics, polyethylene, etc. with sizes 0f 3<br>
to 50 L are preferably used. Due to environmental reasons, aqueous suspensions are<br>
preferred; however, organic additives, such as dispersing aids, surfactants, co-solvents<br>
etc may be added in small amounts.<br>
Furthermore, the high-energy dispersing process (i.e. the high shear mixing /<br>
high energy milling processes) described in the present invention may also be applied in<br>
a continuous way by use of continuous, in-line manufacturing equipment and suitable<br>
mixing devices.<br>
 <br>
From the resulting aqueous suspension, the solids are then separated by conven-<br>
tional separation techniques (e.g. by filtering, settling, centrifuging, filter press etc.).<br>
After drying and calcination in air, a composite powder is obtained.<br>
Drying of the composite powder is done at temperatures in the range of 50 to<br>
100Â°C in air; calcination of the composite powder is performed in air to decompose the<br>
silver oxide to metallic silver; suitable temperatures are in the range of 300 to 500Â°C for<br>
periods of 0,5 to 3 hours; conventional furnaces and batch ovens may be used. The<br>
drying and the calcination processes may also be combined into a one-step heat treat-<br>
ment process using a suitable furnace at different temperatures. After drying and calci-<br>
nation in air, the silver-based composite powder is obtained.<br>
Further processing of the composite powder into semi-finished contacts or con-<br>
tact units generally takes place as well known to the persons skilled in the art.<br>
Typical second phase oxides used for silver-based contact materials include tin<br>
oxide (SnO2). zinc oxide (ZnO), tungsten oxide (WO3), molybdenum oxide (M0O3),<br>
bismuth oxide, (Bi2O3), copper oxide (CuO) and indium oxide (In2O3), used individu-<br>
ally or in combination with each other. For conventional electrical contacts, materials<br>
comprising about 2 to 15 wt.-%, preferably 8 to 12 wt.-% of second oxide phases reveal<br>
the optimum switching performance. 12 wt.-% of tin oxide corresponds to a volume ratio of about 17 vol.-% of tin oxide in the silver-based material. The term "second phase oxides" may include additional dopants, inorganic or organic additives as well as<br>
various sintering aids.	<br>
For good results, the second oxide powders used in the process of the invention<br>
I<br>
should have a medium particle size (d50-value) in the range of 400 to 1,000 run and a<br>
d10-value in the range of 150 to 250 nm. Very good results are obtained with tin oxide<br>
having a medium particle size (d50-value) of 750 nm.	<br>
With the method according to the present invention, the individual components<br>
of the composite powder are intimately mixed together; thus it is possible to manufac-<br>
ture silver-based contact materials having a very highly dispersed microstructure.<br>
By the present invention, silver-based contact materials can be produced as ho-<br>
mogeneous composite materials, revealing medium inter-particle distances for the oxipe<br>
particles below 500 nm, preferably below 300 nm. With conventional methods, particu-<br>
 <br>
larly when using the dry mixing technique, this finely dispersed microstructure cannot<br>
be obtained.	|<br>
In addition to that, the degree of fineness of the microstructure can be tailored by<br>
adjusting the process parameters within broad ranges. Basically, the fineness of the<br>
material is limitedby two factors: the grain size of the particles itself, which are mixed<br>
together as well as the ability to really deagglomerate the particles into the fine primary<br>
particles (as far as they are fine enough). Metallic silver powders made by meh atomisa-<br>
tion, as used generally for dry mixing, are too coarse at all for such fine structures. To<br>
the contrary, very fine silver particles, for example made by chemical processes, are<br>
heavily agglomerated and thus do not allow a homogeneous mixing with the second<br>
phase oxides. Additionally, the very fine second oxide phase and also the dry silver<br>
oxide particles do not deagglomerate sufficiently in a standard dry mixing process and<br>
therefore do not generate the above defined fine homogeneous structure.<br>
As a major advantage over all other previously known chemical processes, this;<br>
method allows to employ all suitable second phase oxide materials, as there is no limita-<br>
tion in chemical stability in solutions with low or high pH-values, as it is the case for<br>
the chemical precipitation technologies.<br>
It should be emphasized that the process of the present invention is not only<br>
suitable for manufacture of contact materials with a very highly dispersed microstruc-<br>
ture (which cannot be produced by standard powder metallurgy methods), it may also<br>
be used for manufacture of contact materials with coarser structures, which are normally<br>
produced by standard methods. In this case, coarser second phase oxide materials with<br>
medium particle sizes (d50-values) in the range of 1 to 6 Î¼m (i.e., 1,000 to 6,000 nm) may be used.	<br>
Thus, compared to the currently known methods, the present invention offers ac-<br>
cess to an enlarged material spectrum for electrical contacts. The process is very eco-<br>
nomical and cost-effective as various types of composite powders containing various<br>
second oxide phases can be manufactured in one single production unit.	<br>
 Analytical Methods<br>
The medium and maximum particle size (d50 and d100 values) and the particle<br>
size distribution was detected by high magnification Transmission Electron Microscopy<br>
 <br>
(TEM) or by Scanhing Electron Microscopy (SEM), Such methods are well known in<br>
the state of the art.<br>
In certain cases, values for particle size distribution (PSD) of starting powders<br>
were obtained by laser granulometric methods in an aqueous medium (e.g. CILAS).<br>
Conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) was applied for particle characterisation<br>
and composition analysis. The silver content of the products was determined by stan-<br>
dard analytical methods. For quantitative analysis of Ag, a volumetric titration method<br>
was used.	<br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following examples. These are mere|y<br>
I<br>
illustrative and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.	<br>
 <br>
Ag2O was prepared from a commercially available AgNO3 solution, the residual<br>
moisture content of Ag20 was 12 wt.-% H2O.<br>
For preparing the suspension by high shear mixing, the mixture was dispersed<br>
with the Kinematica device (conditions: starting temperature 25Â°C, 20 mins at 7,200<br>
rpm, then 5 mins ait 9,600 rpm; end temperature 45oC).<br>
The aqueous suspension was then filtered off and dried overnight at 70Â°C in air<br>
Thereafter, the composite powder was heat-treated for 2 h at 390oC in order to reduce<br>
 <br>
the silver oxide (Ag20) to metallic silver. Then the powder was screened through a 200<br>
mesh screen to destroy agglomerates formed during drying.<br>
Further processing of the composite powder was done by cold isostatic pressing<br>
(CIP) at 800 bar, followed by sintering at 880Â°C and extruding the sintered product to a<br>
wire of 5 mm diameter. Subsequently, this wire was drawn down to 1.37 mm thickness<br>
and reformed to a switching tip.<br>
The mechanical characteristics of the material are given in Table 1. data for spe-<br>
cific contact erosion are listed in Table 2.<br>
 <br>
Ag2O was used with a residual moisture content of 11 wt.-% H2O. The equip- ment used for high energy milling was a bench type Szegvary attritor, model 01-HD, manufactured by Union Process, Akron, Ohio, USA. In order to eliminate the contami-<br>
nation of the samples with iron, a ceramic milling tank/agitator assembly was used. The<br>
milling media consisted of yttrium stabilized zirconia balls. The jacketed milling tank<br>
was connected to a constant temperature bath, which maintained the temperature at<br>
19Â°C through the entire milling process.<br>
The attritor was first loaded with 300 mL DI water. The required amount of sil-<br>
ver- and tin oxides was then gradually added and mixed at 250 rpm. After 15 minutes of<br>
mixing the speed of the attritor was increased to 400 rpm. After two hours the remain-<br>
der of the metal oxides was added into the attritor and the milling was continued for ah<br>
additional hour. The total amount of slurry (including zirconia balls) was about 1.8 L.<br>
 <br>
At the end of the milling process, the batch was discharged and the milling me-<br>
dia were rinsed using DI water. The drying and calcination step was performed as de-<br>
scribed in Example 1.<br>
Further processing of the composite powder was done by cold isostatic pressing<br>
(CIP) at 800 bar, followed by sintering at 880Â°C and extruding the sintered product to a<br>
wire of 5 mm diameter. Subsequently, this wire was drawn down to 1.37 mm thicknes s<br>
and reformed to a switching tip.<br>
The mechanical characteristics of the material are given in Table 1. data for spe-<br>
cific contact erosion are listed in Table 2.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 (CEl)	<br>
Preparation of silver/tin oxide composite powder bv conventional wet mixing<br>
(Composition: 90 wt.-% Ag, 7.2 wt. -% SnO2, 2.3 wt.-% In203,0.5 wt.-% CuO)<br>
 <br>
About 1,5L of DI water was added and all components were mixed for 20 mins<br>
at 1,000 rpm using a standard mixer made by MTI (Mischtechnik International, D-<br>
32758 Detmold, Germany.) The mixture was then dried overnight at 70Â°C in air and<br>
screened through a 200 mesh screen.	<br>
The composite powder thus prepared was treated by cold isostatic pressing (CIP)<br>
I<br>
followed by sintering and extrusion to a wire of 5 mm diameter. Manufacture of a thin<br>
wire with 1.37 mm diameter was not possible. Thus, the extruded wire had to be used<br>
for determination of the material characteristics (ref to Table 1).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The mixing was done with a laboratory mixing equipment, type R02 from G. <br>
Eirich Co., D-74732 Hardheim (Germany). This mixer type consists of a rotating mix-<br>
<br>
ing pot with a stirrer inside. All components were weighed together in the mixer and<br>
mixed for 20 mins at 2,000 rpm (stirrer speed), while the mixing pot was slowly rotat-<br>
ing. Further processing steps (CIP, sintering, extrusion) were done as described in Ex-<br>
ample 1.<br>
The extruded wire broke already at an elongation of less than 3% ductility. Met-<br>
allographic investigations of the extruded material showed in homogenities in form of<br>
Ag-isles and rather big agglomerates of Sn-oxide. A homogeneous microstructure could<br>
not be obtained. As the workability of this material was too poor, no switching tests were conducted.<br>
COMPARATIVE MATERIAL DATA<br>
Table 1 shows material data for silver-tin oxide contact materials based on com-<br>
posite powder made in accordance with the process of the present invention (Examplejs<br>
1 and 2) compared to contact materials made from composite powder using a conven-<br>
tional wet mixing technique (Comparative Example 1, CEl) and a conventional dry mixing technique (Comparative Example 2, CE2).<br>
As can be seen from the table, the silver-tin oxide contact materials made from<br>
composite powder prepared according to the present invention reveal a significantly<br>
higher breaking elongation (in %) and thus a better workability at similar breaking <br>
 <br>
strength (in MPa) compared to the reference materials using standard composite pow-<br>
ders.<br>
Additionally, it should be noted that the wire prepared from the CEl material<br>
was very brittle; thus, a fine wire could not be produced. Contact tips were made from<br>
5 the thicker wire.<br>
As the workability of the material made from Comparative Example 2 (CE2)<br>
was very poor, no switching tests were performed, thus no values for the specific con-<br>
tact erosion are reported in Table 2.<br>
 <br>
The specific contact erosion (SCE) is decisive for the long-term stability and lifetime of the contact material. For measurement of the SCE, the model switches and<br>
methods described by M. Poniatowski et al., 7th International Conference on Electrical<br>
<br>
Contacts, Paris 1974, pages 477-483, were applied.	<br>
The specific contact erosion of the contact material was calculated by the quo-j<br>
tient of weight loss of the contact tips (in Î¼g) and the electric arc energy (in Ws):<br>
 <br>
 <br>
As can be seen from Table 2 , the specific contact erosion of the contact materi-<br>
als made according to the present invention is markedly lower compared to the refer-<br>
ence contact materials containing the composite powder made with the conventional<br>
processes, thus indicating improved material properties. Additionally, the new materials<br>
show excellent resistance against contact welding.	I<br>
 <br>
The resultsof Table 1 and Table 2 clearly demonstrate the advantages of the<br>
process according to the invention compared to conventional processes. Thus, the supe-<br>
riority of the high energy dispersing process of the present invention is clearly demon-<br>
strated.	<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments<br>
thereof, it should be understood that the invention is capable of further modifications<br>
and that this application is intended to cover any and all variations, uses, or adaptations<br>
of the invention which follow the general principles of the invention. All such altema-<br>
 <br>
tives, modifications and equivalents that may become obvious to those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art upon reading the present disclosure are included within the spirit and scope of<br>
