				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tetanus toxin functional fragment antigen and teta-<br>
nus vaccine<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a tetanus toxin<br>
functional fragment antigen and a tetanus vaccine<br>
comprising the same. More particularly, the present<br>
invention is concerned with a specific tetanus toxin<br>
functional fragment antigen which is extremely useful<br>
as an antigen for a tetanus vaccine since the function-<br>
al fragment antigen is advantageous not only in that it<br>
is extremely excellent with respect to the diminution<br>
of side effects when used as an antigen, as compared to<br>
the current tetanus vaccine comprising as an antigen a<br>
whole tetanus toxin toxoid, but also in that it has an<br>
immunopotency which is substantially the same as that<br>
of the whole tetanus toxin toxoid. The present inven-<br>
tion is also concerned with a very safe and effective<br>
tetanus vaccine (tetanus toxoid) comprising the tetanus<br>
toxin functional fragment antigen as an active compon-<br>
ent, a combined vaccine comprising the tetanus vaccine<br>
and at least one vaccine other than the tetanus vac-<br>
cine, and methods for producing the fragment antigen<br>
and vaccines.<br>
Prior Art<br>
As is well known, tetanus is an infectious disease<br>
with extremely high mortality which produces serious<br>
symptoms, such as opisthotonos and dyspnea. Tetanus<br>
bacilli are widely distributed in the environments, and<br>
their spores are commonly found in soil, feces of<br>
animals, and the like. Therefore, every individual is<br>
exposed to the danger of tetanus infection from various<br>
types of traumas, such as punctured wounds and crushed<br>
wounds. Moreover, when an individual is infected with<br>
tetanus bacilli, conventional chemotherapies using<br>
antibiotics, muscle relaxants and the like cannot<br>
grossly change the mortality, whether tetanus patients<br>
are elderly or young. In developed countries, most<br>
deaths from tetanus have recently occurred among the<br>
elderly patients who escaped from vaccination against<br>
tetanus in their babyhood.<br>
Further, even when an individual receives tetanus<br>
vaccination in baby- or child-hood for basal immuniza-<br>
tion and receives a booster, the immunity remaining in<br>
adulthood is not sufficient for preventing tetanus<br>
infection when the individual suffers unexpected injury<br>
in earthquakes, fires, traffic accidents or the like.<br>
Therefore, it is important for adults of the ages above<br>
ca. 40, especially elderly persons, to receive per-<br>
sonally a booster injection in order to ensure protec-<br>
tion against tetanus.<br>
In developed countries, an increase in the number<br>
of intrahospital childbirths, and improvements in<br>
living environments and sanitation, an improvement in<br>
the quality of emergency medical care with respect to<br>
the provision of toxoids and antitoxins, and compulsory<br>
vaccinations for younger people, have reduced the<br>
number of tetanus patients to 1/30 of that of half a<br>
century ago. Furthermore, tetanus is a non-epidemic<br>
disease and is not transmitted from person to person.<br>
Therefore, the importance of the prevention of this<br>
disease tends to be overlooked. However, even today,<br>
the number of tetanus deaths in the world is estimated<br>
to be about 1 million per year, including mostly neona-<br>
tal tetanus deaths which are prevailing in developing<br>
countries. In addition, due to widespread drug abuse,<br>
the number of tetanus patients infected through contam-<br>
inated injection needles is also increasing recently.<br>
Under these circumstances, tetanus is now rec-<br>
ognized as a disease to be prevented by vaccination,<br>
rather than to be treated, and preventive measures<br>
against tetanus are being actively undertaken. For<br>
example, in the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI)<br>
of the World Health Organization (WHO), vaccination<br>
against tetanus is being adopted as one of the most<br>
important tasks, and the vaccination program is being<br>
promoted. The "International Conference on Tetanus",<br>
one of whose goals is to eradicate the tetanus disease<br>
has been held about every three years in various coun-<br>
tries since 1963.<br>
As evident from the above, tetanus is a disease<br>
caused by a ubiquitous bacteria whose spores are impos-<br>
sible to eradicate from the earth, and it is not an<br>
exaggeration to say that vaccination against tetanus is<br>
the only way to reduce the death of human beings due to<br>
tetanus, irrespective of age and sex, to zero, and that<br>
the vaccination is essential for all human beings who<br>
are born on the earth not only at present, but also in<br>
the future.<br>
For prevention of tetanus, tetanus toxoid has been<br>
used as a vaccine. Tetanus toxoid, which is used as an<br>
active component for tetanus vaccine, is tetanus toxin<br>
detoxified with formalin. Such a tetanus toxoid has<br>
been used in either a plain form without an adjuvant or<br>
in the form of a precipitated antigen preparation<br>
adsorbed on a small amount of an aluminum salt as an<br>
adjuvant or in the form of a combined antigen prepara-<br>
tion prepared by mixing tetanus toxoid with other<br>
vaccines, such as diphtheria toxoid, pertussis vaccine<br>
and Haemophilus influenzae b vaccine. To infants,<br>
tetanus toxoid is generally administered in the form of<br>
the so-called DPT combined vaccine which is a mixture<br>
of vaccines of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) and pertus-<br>
sis (P) in adsorbed forms. For a tetanus-prophylactic<br>
treatment of traumatic patients, a plain T toxoid<br>
vaccine or a DT combined toxoid vaccine is used. These<br>
toxoids are widely used over the world and the T toxoid<br>
preparations have been highly appreciated in the world<br>
as one of the most effective and important vaccines.<br>
However, the current tetanus toxoid preparations have<br>
various problems to be solved. For example, the teta-<br>
nus toxoid has disadvantages in that there are various<br>
adverse side effects, that the product quality is<br>
uneven among different manufacturers, that the reten-<br>
tion of immunity is limited to only approximately 5 to<br>
10 years and, therefore, repeated vaccinations are<br>
necessary to keep the antitoxin level sufficient to<br>
prevent tetanus infection. Thus, the conventional<br>
tetanus toxoid has problems to be solved with respect<br>
to safety, control of quality, retention of immunity,<br>
and ease, labor saving and economy in administration.<br>
Therefore, for promoting the use of the tetanus vac-<br>
cine, a large number of problems need to be solved<br>
mainly from a viewpoint of mass-production of high<br>
quality tetanus vaccine.<br>
Hereinbelow, prior art is discussed in connection<br>
with the primary object of the present invention, which<br>
is to provide a tetanus toxin antigen, which is not<br>
only extremely excellent with respect to the diminution<br>
of adverse side effects when used as a vaccine, but<br>
also exhibits high immunopotency, thus solving the<br>
above-mentioned problems accompanying the prior art.<br>
Various adverse side effects are known to accompa-<br>
ny the use of conventional tetanus toxoid vaccines.<br>
Various adverse side effects, such as local reactions<br>
at injection sites (e.g., erythema, tenderness, swell-<br>
ing, edema and sterile abscess), systemic fever; and,<br>
although rare, allergy (e.g., local anaphylaxis,<br>
anaphylactic shock, serum sickness-like type III hyper-<br>
sensitivity and delayed hypersensitivity) and serious<br>
generalized reactions (e.g., peripheral neuropathy,<br>
lymphadenopathy, brachial plexus neuropathy, Guillain-<br>
Barret syndrome and acute transverse myelitis) have<br>
been reported (see "Vaccine", 2nd edition, edited by<br>
S.A. Plotkin and E.A. Mortimer, pp. 75-77, W. B. Saun-<br>
ders Company, 1994; "Mandell, Douglas and Bennett"s<br>
Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases", 4th<br>
edition, edited by G. L. Mandell et al., p. 2781,<br>
Churchill Livingstone &amp; Son, Inc., 1995; Journal of<br>
the American Medical Association, 264(18), p. 2448,<br>
1990 and 271(20), p. 1629, 1994; and Lancet, 339, pp.<br>
1111-1112, 2 May, 1992).<br>
Various attempts to reduce or remove these adverse<br>
side effects of the tetanus toxoid vaccine have been<br>
made. For example, development of a method for obtain-<br>
ing highly purified toxoid, use of modified or new<br>
adjuvants, and individual use of the fragments A, B and<br>
C (which are subunits of the tetanus toxin and which<br>
are explained below) as an active component for a<br>
vaccine have been proposed. Of these attempts, with<br>
respect to the techniques of using a tetanus toxin<br>
fragment, as examples of tetanus toxin fragments used<br>
in these techniques, there can be mentioned fragment C<br>
prepared by digesting the tetanus toxin with trypsin<br>
and/or papain (see Unexamined Japanese Patent Applica-<br>
tion Laid-Open Specification Nos. 50-71820, 51-82719<br>
and 52-83928), fragment A-B prepared by digesting the<br>
tetanus toxin with papain (see Unexamined Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No. 53-<br>
26319), an antigen obtained by expressing a gene coding<br>
for fragment C in E. coli, yeast or salmonella (see<br>
Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Speci-<br>
fication No. 3-285681, Japanese Patent Application<br>
prior-to-examination Publication (Kohyo) No. 4-506005,<br>
International Application Publication Nos. WO 90/15871<br>
and WO 94/03615, and EP-A-0 209 281), and a synthesized<br>
epitope of fragment C (see International Application<br>
Publication No. WO 94/00484). However, none of these<br>
conventional tetanus toxin fragment vaccines have been<br>
put into practical use because all of these tetanus<br>
toxin fragment vaccines have low antigenicity and<br>
immunopotency, as compared to those of the conventional<br>
tetanus toxoid comprising the toxoid of the whole<br>
tetanus toxin molecule. Meanwhile, cloning of the<br>
tetanus toxin gene, and determination of both nucleo-<br>
tide sequence and amino acid sequence of the tetanus<br>
toxin molecule have been achieved [see EMBO Journal,<br>
5(10), 2495-2501, 1986 and Nucleic Acid Research,<br>
14(19), 7809-7812, 1986 (the entire amino acid sequence<br>
of the whole tetanus toxin molecule is shown in SEQ ID<br>
NO. 1)]. Further, based on the above information on<br>
the entire nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence,<br>
fragments of the tetanus toxin gene are expressed and<br>
synthetic peptides are produced as parts of the tetanus<br>
toxin molecule, and in addition, determination of the<br>
epitope regions of the tetanus toxin has been attempted<br>
using the expression products of the gene DNA fragments<br>
and the synthesized peptides [see Infection and Immuni-<br>
ty, 57(11), 3498-3505, 1989 and Molecular Immunology,<br>
31(15), 1141-1148, 1994]. However, tetanus vaccines<br>
comprising such tetanus toxin epitopes as active com-<br>
ponents have not been achieved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventor has long studied tetanus<br>
toxin to date for more than 20 years since the early<br>
1970s, when purification of tetanus toxin to a high<br>
level could not be achieved and the detailed structure<br>
and properties of the tetanus toxin molecule were<br>
unknown. The present inventor extensively studied the<br>
toxin-producing ability of tetanus bacilli. He has<br>
further made extensive and intensive studies for devel-<br>
oping a tetanus vaccine antigen which is extremely<br>
excellent with respect to diminution of adverse side<br>
effects of conventional tetanus vaccines comprising, as<br>
an antigen, the whole tetanus toxin toxoid, but also<br>
has an immunopotency which is substantially the same as<br>
that of the whole tetanus toxin toxoid. As a result,<br>
he found that a specific functional fragment antigen<br>
(hereinafter referred to simply as "FFA") derived from<br>
tetanus toxin is effective as an antigen for a tetanus<br>
vaccine, and is extremely excellent with respect to<br>
diminution of adverse side effects. The present inven-<br>
tion has been completed, based on the novel findings.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present inven-<br>
tion to provide a tetanus antigen which is extremely<br>
excellent with respect to diminution of adverse side<br>
effects of the conventional whole tetanus toxin toxoid,<br>
but also has an immunopotency which is substantially<br>
the same as that of a whole tetanus toxin toxoid.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a tetanus vaccine which is extremely excellent<br>
with respect to the diminution of adverse side effects<br>
of the current vaccines, and has an immunopotency which<br>
is substantially the same as that of the conventional<br>
whole tetanus toxoid vaccine.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a method for producing the above-mentioned<br>
tetanus vaccine.<br>
Still a further object of the present invention is<br>
to provide a method for producing the above-mentioned<br>
functional fragment antigen (FFA) as a tetanus vaccine<br>
antigen.<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features and<br>
advantages of the present invention will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art from the following detailed<br>
description and appended claims taken in connection<br>
with the accompanying sequence listing and drawings.<br>

there can be mentioned the tetanus toxin functional<br>
fragment antigen, wherein each of the above-mentioned<br>
at least one fragment independently has an N-terminal<br>
amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting<br>
of the following amino acid sequences (1) to (8):<br>
(1) KIIPPTNNIRENLYNRTASLTDLGGELCIK,<br>
(2) IIPPTNNIRENLYNRTASLTDLGGELCIK,<br>
(3) ENLYNRTASLTDLGGELCIK,<br>
(4) NLYNRTASLTDLGGELCIK,<br>
(5) NRTASLTDLGGELCIK,<br>
(6) TASLTDLGGELCIK,<br>
(7) SLTDLGGELCIK, and<br>
(8) GGELCIK .<br>
Further, the tetanus toxin functional fragment<br>
antigen of the present invention may be stabilized with<br>
a fixative.<br>
For further clarification of the essential<br>
features of the present invention, the technical<br>
features of the present invention will be described by<br>
explaining the development of the present invention.<br>
Isolation of a strain of Clostridium tetani having high<br>
toxin-producing ability:<br>
In the present invention, a strain of Clostridium<br>
tetani having high toxin-producing ability is used.<br>
The present inventor isolated a substrain having high<br>
toxin-producing ability by single colony isolation from<br>
Harvard H47 strain, which is a known C. tetani strain<br>
derived from a known C. tetani strain called the Har-<br>
vard strain [ATCC (American Type Culture Collection)<br>
accession No. 10779], and he designated the obtained<br>
substrain as "Clostridium tetani Harvard H47 strain<br>
Biken substrain" (hereinafter referred to simply as<br>
"Biken substrain"). Also, the present inventor found<br>
that production of tetanus toxin is under the control<br>
of genetic information carried by the plasmid DNA in<br>
the C tetani cell (Biken Journal, 20, 105-115, 1977).<br>
Further, by using the culturing method based on the<br>
above finding, the present inventor succeeded in mass<br>
production of tetanus toxin by culturing the Biken<br>
substrain, and high purification of the tetanus toxin.<br>
Thus, in the present invention, it is first neces-<br>
sary that a strain of Clostridium tetani having high<br>
toxin-producing ability is selected and used as a seed<br>
culture. As a seed culture, a culture of transformant<br>
of a microorganism, such as yeast, Escherichia coli,<br>
Bacillus subtilis or the like, which is obtained using<br>
the below-mentioned DNA coding for FFA, by genetic<br>
engineering techniques, can be used.<br>
Mode of formation of and toxic activity of tetanus<br>
toxin:<br>
In the C. tetani cells, tetanus toxin is first<br>
produced in the form of a single polypeptide chain<br>
(whole tetanus toxin molecule in a non-nicked, intact<br>
form) having a molecular weight of about 150,000<br>
(hereinafter, frequently referred to as "intracellular<br>
toxin"). Subsequently, by the autolysis of the cell,<br>
the tetanus toxin is released from the cells into the<br>
extracellular medium (hereinafter, the toxin released<br>
into the extracellular medium is frequently referred to<br>
as "extracellular toxin"). When the toxin is released<br>
from the cells, at least one bond in the peptide bonds<br>
connecting mutually adjacent amino acid residues in the<br>
partial amino acid sequence between two cysteine resi-<br>
dues participating in forming the disulfide bridge<br>
present in the N-terminal of the whole amino acid<br>
sequence of the whole tetanus toxin molecule is split<br>
by a protease produced by C. tetani, to thereby form at<br>
least two polypeptide chains. However, the two poly-<br>
peptide chains are united to each other by the disul-<br>
fide bridge present in the N-terminal of the whole<br>
tetanus toxin molecule, that is, these polypeptide<br>
chains assume a nicked forms [see Figs. l(a) and l(b);<br>
Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,<br>
57, 1257-1262, 1974; ibid. 68, 668-674, 1976; ibid. 77,<br>
268-274, 1977], and further, the two polypeptide chains<br>
are also united to each other by non-covalent bonds<br>
[see Fig. 2(b)]. Conversion of the tetanus toxin<br>
molecule from the intact form into the nicked form<br>
enhances the toxin activity of the tetanus toxin<br>
several times, and the nicking is essential for elicit-<br>
ing toxic action. Therefore, for saving labor in the<br>
preparation of the functional fragment antigen, it is<br>
preferred to use, as a starting material, the extra-<br>
cellular tetanus toxin, which has already been convert-<br>
ed into the nicked form [see Fig. l(b)].<br>
Subunit structure of tetanus toxin and the mechanism of<br>
manifestation of toxicity of tetanus toxin:<br>
As a result of the unique studies of the present<br>
inventor, two functionary complementary polypeptide<br>
chains, namely, L (light) chain and H (heavy) chain,<br>
were obtained from the whole tetanus toxin molecule.<br>
That is, the present inventor succeeded in isolating<br>
and purifying these fragments (L and H chains), to<br>
thereby obtain the L chain and H chain individually,<br>
which are native enough to be able to reproduce the<br>
toxin activity of the whole tetanus toxin molecule when<br>
these L and H chains are reconstituted into the whole<br>
tetanus toxin molecule, although each of the individu-<br>
ally obtained L chain and H chain is not toxic.<br>
In addition, the present inventor also successful-<br>
ly isolated and purified the following three fragments:<br>
the C-terminal half of the H chain (fragment C), a<br>
fragment (fragment A-B) obtained by removing fragment C<br>
from the whole tetanus toxin molecule, and a fragment<br>
(fragment B) obtained by separating fragment A (i.e., L<br>
chain) from the purified fragment A-B.<br>
Further, after the preparation of the whole teta-<br>
nus toxin molecule and the above-mentioned fragments A,<br>
B, C, A-B and B-C, i.e., all the three subunits of<br>
tetanus toxin and the complexes of the adjacent sub-<br>
units, the present inventor examined the differences in<br>
functions of these fragments, and the relationship<br>
between the subunit structure of tetanus toxin and the<br>
mechanism of the toxic action of tetanus toxin, and<br>
proposed a "tripartite [A-B.C] molecular model" [see<br>
Fig. l(c); Biken Journal, 26, 133-143, 1983; and<br>
"Botulinum Neurotoxin and Tetanus toxin", edited by L.<br>
L. Simpson, pp. 69-92 (Chapter 4), Academic Press,<br>
1989].<br>
This tripartite molecular model was accepted as<br>
the most appropriate molecular model of tetanus toxin<br>
at the 8th International Conference on Tetanus (1988).<br>
According to the tripartite [A-B.C] model, fragment C<br>
has the role of carrying the tetanus toxin molecule to<br>
the central nervous system (letter "C" means<br>
"Carrier"), fragment B has the role of binding the<br>
tetanus toxin molecule to the presynaptic membrane of<br>
the nerve cell and the role of transporting the tetanus<br>
toxin molecule into the cytoplasm (letter "B" means<br>
"Binding"), and fragment A has the role of exhibiting"<br>
the toxic activity based on the enzyme activity (letter<br>
"A" means "Active") (see "8th International Conference<br>
on Tetanus", edited by G. Nistco et al., pp. 170-171,<br>
Phythagora Press, Rome-Milan, 1989; Infection and<br>
Immunity, 57, 3588-3593, 1989; Toxicon, 27, 385-392,<br>
1989; ibid. 28, 737-741, 1990).<br>
Variety of the fragments of tetanus toxin:<br>
Until 1989, there was no consensus on any of the<br>
length, molecular weight and nomenclature of each of<br>
the fragments of tetanus toxin among researchers in the<br>
world, and this situation gave difficulties in exchange<br>
of information and discussions on the structures-<br>
function relationship of subunits of tetanus toxin<br>
among researchers. Therefore, it was desired to estab-<br>
lish a common basis for the studies on tetanus toxin by<br>
using unitary definitions of fragment models.<br>
In such a situation, the present inventor proposed<br>
the above-mentioned tripartite molecular model for the<br>
first time. That is, the present inventor pointed out<br>
the disadvantages of the absence of a consensus on the<br>
lengths, molecular weights and nomenclatures of the<br>
tetanus toxin fragments, and the present inventor<br>
emphasized the necessity of unitary definitions of<br>
fragments and proposed the above models [see the above-<br>
mentioned "Botulinum Neurotoxin and Tetanus toxin",<br>
edited by L. L. Simpson, pp. 69-92 (Chapter 4)].<br>
It is believed that the reason why a variety of<br>
fragments are obtained from the whole tetanus toxin<br>
molecule resides not only in the genetic differences of<br>
seed strains of C tetani used by different research-<br>
ers, but also in that there are delicate differences in<br>
various operation conditions employed by researchers<br>
for obtaining tetanus toxin and fragments thereof, such<br>
as the culturing conditions for the seed strain, the<br>
autolysis conditions for the cultured cells to obtain<br>
the extracellular toxin which has already been convert-<br>
ed into a nicked form, and the treating conditions for<br>
an extracted intracellular toxin, that is, the condi-<br>
tions for digesting the extracted intracellular toxin<br>
by a protease into a nicked form, and the conditions<br>
for treating the extracted intracellular toxin with a<br>
reducing agent, a denaturing agent, a solubilizing<br>
agent or the like, wherein examples of conditions for<br>
treating the extracted intracellular toxin include the<br>
types of the enzyme and reagents, the treatment temper-<br>
ature, the treatment time, the concentration of the<br>
enzyme or reagent, the pH of the treating solution, and<br>
the physical conditions for the treatment of the ex-<br>
tracted intracellular toxin, i.e., stirring or shaking,<br>
or keeping it in a stationary state.<br>
Definition of "FFA" of the present invention:<br>
The functional fragment antigen (FFA) of the<br>
present invention is a tetanus toxin functional frag-<br>
ment antigen, comprising at least one fragment which is<br>
substantially the same as that obtained by a process<br>
comprising the steps of splitting at least one peptide<br>
bond selected from peptide bonds individually connect-<br>
ing mutually adjacent amino acid residues in a partial<br>
amino acid sequence between two cysteine residues<br>
participating in forming a disulfide bridge present in<br>
the N-terminal of the entire amino acid sequence of a<br>
whole tetanus toxin molecule, splitting the disulfide<br>
bridge, and splitting non-covalent bonds [as indicated<br>
in Fig. 2(b)] between groups on the tetanus toxin<br>
molecule;<br>
the tetanus toxin functional fragment antigen<br>
having:<br>
(a) a molecular weight of from 90,000 to 110,000 as<br>
measured by an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis<br>
method; and<br>
(b) an isoelectric point of 7.25 ± 0.5 as measured by<br>
an isoelectric focusing method.<br>
As a result of the research by the present inven-<br>
tor, it has been found that various types of N-terminal<br>
amino acid sequences of FFA can be obtained [see Fig.<br>
2(a)]. In the present invention, it is preferred that<br>
the tetanus toxin functional fragment antigen has an N-<br>
terminal amino acid sequence selected from the group<br>
consisting of the eight amino acid sequences shown in<br>
Fig. 2(a). Further, the tetanus toxin functional<br>
fragment antigen (FFA) of the present invention has an<br>
immunopotency which is substantially the same as that<br>
of the whole tetanus toxin toxoid. In addition, the<br>
tetanus toxin functional fragment antigen (FFA) of the<br>
present invention is extremely excellent with respect<br>
to the diminution of adverse side effects, as compared<br>
to conventional whole tetanus toxin toxoids. The term<br>
"immunopotency" means the ability to prevent the occur-<br>
rence of the symptoms of tetanus. In the present<br>
invention, the term "having an immunopotency which is<br>
substantially the same as that of the toxoid of the<br>
whole tetanus toxin molecule" means that the FFA exhib-<br>
its a relative potency (ratio of the potency of FFA,<br>
relative to the potency of the whole tetanus toxin<br>
toxoid) of 1 ± 0.2, as measured by a method in which a<br>
vaccine containing FFA and a vaccine containing the<br>
whole tetanus toxin toxoid prepared by the method<br>
described in Reference Example 14 are subjected to<br>
measurement of immunopotency by the parallel line assay<br>
using the whole toxin toxoid of a known international<br>
unit of potency as a reference and using a challenge<br>
toxin of a known LD50 (Median Lethol Dose) described in<br>
Example 1(5). The results are analyzed by the score<br>
method described in Reference Example 15.<br>
Thus, the present invention also provides a sin-<br>
gle-antigen tetanus vaccine comprising FFA as an active<br>
component, such as a plain preparation, an adsorbed<br>
preparation or a lyophilized preparation, and a<br>
combined vaccine comprising FFA as one of a plurality<br>
of active components, such as a DPT combined vaccine, a<br>
DT combined vaccine, or a combined vaccine comprising<br>
FFA and at least one vaccine antigen selected from the<br>
group consisting of vaccine antigens other than FFA,<br>
such as influenza B vaccine antigen, inactivated polio-<br>
myelitis vaccine antigen, inactivated hepatitis B<br>
vaccine antigen, inactivated Japanese encephalitis<br>
vaccine antigen and the like, and a method for produc-<br>
ing the above-mentioned vaccines in large quantities.<br>
Hereinbelow, explanation is made on the prepara-<br>
tion of the FFA of the present invention, the prepara-<br>
tion of a vaccine using the prepared FFA, the tests for<br>
evaluating the prepared vaccine, and the like.<br>
(1) Seed microorganisms:<br>
With respect to a microorganism used as a seed<br>
culture for obtaining the functional fragment antigen<br>
(FFA) of the present invention, there is no particular<br>
limitation as long as the microorganism has high toxin-<br>
producing ability. Examples of such microorganisms<br>
include the substrain of Clostridium tetani Harvard<br>
strain, and other C tetani strains having substantial-<br>
ly the same or higher producing ability for tetanus<br>
toxin, as or than that of the Harvard strain. Specifi-<br>
cally, for example, it is preferred to use the Biken<br>
substrain having high toxin-producing ability (Refer-<br>
ence Example 1), obtained by single colony isolation<br>
from the Harvard H47 strain, which is a known C. tetani <br>
strain derived from the Harvard strain [deposited with <br>
ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) under the J<br>
accession No. 10779].<br>
Further, as a seed microorganism, there can also<br>
be used a transformant microorganism obtained by a<br>
method in which a microorganism, such as yeast, Escher-<br>
ichia coli, Bacillus subtilis or the like, is trans-<br>
formed with a gene coding for FFA, using genetic engi-<br>
neering techniques. Specifically, for example, as a<br>
seed microorganism there can be used Escherichia coli<br>
transformed with a large-quantity expression vector<br>
having a DNA encoding FFA operably ligated thereto,<br>
which transformed E coli is obtained in accordance<br>
with the method described in Reference Example 2 men-<br>
tioned below.<br>
(2) Medium:<br>
Conventional media can be used for culturing the<br>
seed microorganism for obtaining FFA. For example, a<br>
conventional liquid medium for culturing an anaerobic<br>
microorganism can be used for culturing the above-<br>
mentioned seed microorganisms. Examples of such liquid<br>
media include cooked meat medium, PYG (Peptone, Yeast<br>
extract, Glucose) medium, GAM (Gifu Anaerobic Medium)<br>
broth. Veal infusion medium, thioglycolate medium,<br>
liver-liver broth, RCM (Reinforced Clostridial Medium)<br>
broth and DRCM (Differential Reinforced Clostridial<br>
Medium) broth. If desired, in order to improve the<br>
growth characteristics of the microorganisms and/or the<br>
maintenance of the low oxidation-reduction potential, a<br>
medium can be modified by replacement, addition or<br>
removal of components thereof, or by changing the<br>
amount of components thereof. Among these media,<br>
liver-liver broth is preferred for use in preparing a<br>
seed culture, and a modified Latham medium designed by<br>
the present inventor (Reference Example 3) is preferred<br>
for use in producing tetanus toxin from the seed cul-<br>
ture.<br>
(3) Culture conditions:<br>
There is no particular limitation with respect to<br>
the conditions for culturing the seed microorganism for<br>
obtaining FFA. For example, a strain of C tetani<br>
having high toxin-producing ability is cultured under<br>
culture conditions, in which the incubation temperature<br>
is from about 30 to about 37 °C, preferably from about<br>
34 to about 36 °C, and the incubation time is from<br>
about 1 to about 8 days, particularly from about 1 to<br>
about 2 days for extracting the intracellular toxin,<br>
and particularly from about 4 to about 7 days for<br>
harvesting the extracellular toxin.<br>
(4) Starting materials for the preparation of FFA:<br>
In the present invention, FFA is prepared using<br>
the whole tetanus toxin molecules obtained from the<br>
cells cultured as described above. Examples of start-<br>
ing materials for the preparation of FFA include a cell<br>
extract (containing an intracellular tetanus toxin) of<br>
the microorganisms cultured as described above and a<br>
culture supernatant or a culture filtrate (each con-<br>
taining an extracellular tetanus toxin in a nicked<br>
form) obtained by a method in which the cultured cells<br>
are allowed to undergo autolysis, and the unlysed cells<br>
and cell debris contained in the resultant autolysis<br>
product are removed by centrifugation or filtration.<br>
When it is desired to prepare FFA from intracellular<br>
tetanus toxin, it is necessary to split the intracellu-<br>
lar tetanus toxin with a protease, such as trypsin or<br>
chymotrypsin, thus converting the intracellular tetanus<br>
toxin into a nicked form. Therefore, for saving labor<br>
in the preparation process and achieving high yield, it<br>
is preferred to use, as a starting material, a culture<br>
supernatant or a culture filtrate each containing an<br>
extracellular tetanus toxin in a nicked form.<br>
(5) Preliminary purification of tetanus toxin:<br>
The whole tetanus toxin molecule in the starting<br>
material can be roughly purified by conventional meth-<br>
ods. Examples of such conventional methods include<br>
salting out by using ammonium sulfate, alcohol precipi-<br>
tation, adsorption onto and desorption from a gel, and<br>
ultrafiltration by using commercially available mem-<br>
branes. In the present invention, the whole tetanus<br>
toxin molecule obtained by these preliminary purifica-<br>
tion methods is referred to as "partially purified<br>
whole tetanus toxin".<br>
(6) High purification of tetanus toxin:<br>
The partially purified whole tetanus toxin, ob-<br>
tained by the method described in item (5) above, can<br>
be highly purified by, for example, a method using both<br>
density-gradient ultracentrifugation and equilibrium<br>
density-gradient ultracentrifugation (see Unexamined<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Specification No.<br>
07-89951), or a method using an appropriate combination<br>
of conventional methods, such as ultracentrifugation,<br>
gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography and high<br>
performance liquid chromatography. In the present<br>
invention, a highly purified whole tetanus toxin mol-<br>
ecule obtained by these purification methods (herei-<br>
nafter, frequently referred to simply as "highly puri-<br>
fied tetanus toxin") can be used as a material for<br>
preparation of FFA of the present invention. The<br>
highly purified tetanus toxin needs to be confirmed<br>
with respect to its eligibility for use as whole teta-<br>
nus toxin molecules. The confirmation of the eligibil-<br>
ity can be performed by determining, for example, MLD<br>
(Minimum Lethal Dose; Reference Example 4), Lf unit<br>
(Unit of flocculation; Reference Example 5), protein<br>
content (Reference Example 6), or the like.<br>
(7) Preparation of FFA:<br>
In the present invention, FFA is prepared from the<br>
above-mentioned highly purified tetanus toxin. When<br>
the highly purified tetanus toxin used for preparation<br>
of FFA is prepared from intracellular tetanus toxin, it<br>
is first necessary to digest mildly or split the in-<br>
tracellular tetanus toxin with a protease, such as<br>
trypsin or chymotrypsin, so as to convert the toxin<br>
into a nicked form. Two functionally complementary<br>
fragments of tetanus toxin can be prepared by a method<br>
comprising the steps of splitting a disulfide bridge<br>
present in the N-terminal of the purified tetanus toxin<br>
in the nicked form by a reducing agent, and splitting<br>
non-covalent bonds between groups on the tetanus toxin<br>
molecule by a denaturing agent. Examples of reducing<br>
agents include conventional reducing agents, such as<br>
sodium thioglycolate, dithiothreitol (hereinafter<br>
referred to simply as "DTT"), glutathione, mercap-<br>
toethanol, hydrogen sulfide, sodium borohydride, sodium<br>
sulfide, ammonium sulfide and the like. As denaturing<br>
agents, conventional denaturing agents can be used.<br>
Examples of these agents include guanidine thiocyanate,<br>
guanidine hydrochloride, urea, sodium dodecyl sulfate<br>
and the like. In the present invention, DTT and urea<br>
are preferred. With respect to a preferred manner of<br>
the use of DTT, for example, the final concentration of<br>
DTT in a solution containing the toxin protein in an<br>
amount of from about 1 to about 10 mg/ml is generally<br>
in the range of from 10 to 200 mM, preferably from 50<br>
to 150 mM, and the reaction is conducted at 15 to 35 °C<br>
for 20 to 180 minutes. With respect to a preferred<br>
manner of the use of urea, for example, the final<br>
concentration of urea in a solution containing the<br>
toxin protein in an amount of from about 1 to about<br>
10 mg/ml is generally in the range of from 0.5 to 10 M,<br>
preferably from 1 to 5 M, and the reaction is conducted<br>
at 5 to 35 °C for 10 seconds to 15 minutes. Each of<br>
these reagents is added to the starting material so<br>
that the concentration of the reagent falls within the<br>
above-mentioned respective concentration range. In the<br>
present invention, DTT is used in the form of a solu-<br>
tion (see Reference Example 8; hereinafter, this solu-<br>
tion is referred to as "DTT Tris buffer"), and the<br>
solution is added to the starting material in an amount<br>
about 5 to about 50 times by volume the amount of the<br>
starting material, to react DTT with tetanus toxin.<br>
Urea is used in the form of a saturated solution or<br>
directly in the form of crystals.<br>
As a result of the above-mentioned treatments with<br>
DTT and urea, the whole tetanus toxin molecule in the<br>
nicked form is split to obtain a solution containing<br>
FFA. By diluting the solution containing FFA to there-<br>
by lower the concentration of urea, FFA can be obtained<br>
as a highly purified tetanus toxin fragment by frac-<br>
tionation or separation using an absorbance at 280 nm<br>
as an index (see Reference Example 7). The purifica-<br>
tion can be performed by, for example, a combined<br>
method using both density-gradient ultracentrifugation<br>
and equilibrium density-gradient ultracentrifugation<br>
(see Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. 07-<br>
89951), SDS-PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide<br>
Gel Electrophoresis), gel filtration, membrane filtra-<br>
tion, ion-exchange chromatography, high performance<br>
liquid chromatography and the like. By these purifica-<br>
tion methods, two fractions of different molecular<br>
weights, corresponding to two peaks appearing at 280<br>
nm, are obtained, and FFA is found in the fraction of<br>
the larger molecular weight. This fraction containing<br>
FFA is used as an active component for an FFA tetanus<br>
vaccine. The whole tetanus toxin molecule can be<br>
prepared according to the method described below<br>
(Reference Example 13). The molecular weight, antigen-<br>
ic specificity, amino acid sequence and the like of<br>
each of the whole tetanus toxin molecule and FFA can be<br>
determined by, for example, SDS-PAGE (Reference Example<br>
10), a precipitation reaction in gel (Reference Example<br>
11) and a method using a peptide sequencer (Reference<br>
Example 12).<br>
(8) Stabilization of FFA:<br>
In the FFA of the present invention, a whole or<br>
most of the fragment A region, which is the active site<br>
exhibiting the toxicity, is absent, so that the FFA of<br>
the present invention has no toxicity. Therefore, the<br>
FFA as such can be used as a toxoid without detoxifica-<br>
tion. However, for stabilizing the stereochemical<br>
structure of FFA as an antigen, it is preferred to<br>
perform a stabilization (fixation) of the tetanus toxin<br>
FFA. Examples of fixatives (fixing or stabilizing<br>
reagent) include conventional detoxifying agents, such<br>
as formalin, glutaraldehyde, (3-propiolactone and the<br>
like. For example, when formalin is used as a fixa-<br>
tive, it is preferred that the volume ratio of formalin<br>
to the FFA solution is approximately within the range<br>
of from 0.0004 to 0.7 % (v/v). The fixation tempera-<br>
ture is approximately within the range of from 3 to<br>
37 °C and the fixation time is approximately within the<br>
range of from 5 to 180 days. When there is a danger<br>
that the antigenecity of FFA is deteriorated by the<br>
fixation, the fixation conditions are rendered moderate<br>
by lowering the concentration of the fixative, lowering<br>
the fixation temperature or adding neutral amino acids,<br>
such as glycine and serine, or basic amino acids, such<br>
as lysine and arginine. When free formaldehyde remains<br>
in the solution after the fixation, if desired, it can<br>
be neutralized by addition of sodium hydrogensulfite in<br>
an equivalent amount to the amount of the formaldehyde,<br>
or can be removed by filtration using a membrane or by<br>
dialysis. After the fixation treatment, the FFA solu-<br>
tion is stored at 4 °C for subsequent use as a bulk<br>
solution of tetanus toxin vaccine for preparing a<br>
tetanus vaccine. After the fixation treatment, the<br>
treated whole tetanus toxin molecule and treated FFA<br>
are referred to as a "whole tetanus toxin toxoid" and<br>
an "FFA toxoid", respectively.<br>
(9) Preparation of FFA tetanus vaccine:<br>
The FFA toxoid bulk solution obtained in item (8)<br>
above can be diluted so as to obtain a vaccine compris-<br>
ing the FFA toxoid in an effective immunogenic amount.<br>
For example, the bulk solution can be diluted with an<br>
isotonic solution of salts, or with buffer or a medium<br>
for tissue culture so that the protein content of the<br>
vaccine becomes from 20 to 200 ug for a single-antigen<br>
toxoid, or 8 to 80 ug for an adsorbed toxoid.<br>
When the bulk solution is diluted as mentioned<br>
above, a stabilizer for increasing the heat resistance<br>
of the vaccine or an adjuvant as a supplementary agent<br>
for increasing the immunopotency can be added to the<br>
vaccine solution. It is preferred that the stabilizer<br>
is added to the vaccine in an amount of from 0.01 to 10<br>
% (w/v), and the adjuvant is added in an amount of from<br>
0.1 to 50 mg per ml of the vaccine. Examples of stabi-<br>
lizers include saccharides, amino acids, gelatin hydro-<br>
lyzate, human albumin and the like. Examples of adjuv-<br>
ants include gels capable of effecting sustained re-<br>
lease of antigens, such as calcium phosphate, aluminum<br>
phosphate, aluminum sulfate, alumina, bentonite and the<br>
like; and antibody production inducing agents, such as<br>
muramyldipeptide derivatives, oils and the like.<br>
Subsequently, the single-antigen vaccine or ad-<br>
sorbed vaccine is dispensed into small containers, such<br>
as ampuls or vials. Then, the containers are sealed<br>
hermetically, for example, by fusion sealing, and the<br>
sealed vaccine is provided as a plain or adsorbed<br>
preparation. When the vaccine is lyophilized after<br>
dispensation, the vaccine can be provided as a lyophil-<br>
ized preparation. Further, the vaccine can be provided<br>
in the form of a combined vaccine preparation, such as<br>
a DT binary vaccine, a DPT ternary vaccine, a quater-<br>
nary vaccine or the like.<br>
Each of these preparations is subjected to various<br>
tests to verify the eligibility for use as a toxoid or<br>
a vaccine. That is, each of these preparations is<br>
subjected to various tests on effectiveness, safety and<br>
homogeneity in accordance with a relevant provision<br>
(such as a provision entitled "tetanus toxoid", a<br>
provision entitled "adsorbed tetanus toxoid", a provi-<br>
sion entitled "diphtheria-tetanus combined toxoid", or<br>
a provision entitled "diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus<br>
combined vaccine") in the Notification No. 217 of the<br>
Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare: "Seibutsugaku-<br>
teki Seizai Kijun (Minimum Requirements for Biological<br>
Products), to thereby verify its eligibility for use as<br>
a vaccine. Only the verified preparations are put to<br>
practical use. With respect to the manner of adminis-<br>
tration, for example, a preparation is usually admin-<br>
istrated by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection in<br>
an amount of 0.5 ml per person. In the case of a<br>
lyophilized preparation, before use, it is dissolved in<br>
sterile distilled water so as to obtain a solution<br>
having the original volume before lyophilization.<br>
(10) Measurement of immunopotency of FFA tetanus vac-<br>
cine:<br>
The immunopotency of FFA tetanus vaccine of the<br>
present invention is measured using immunized animals<br>
(guinea pigs or mice) by a potency assay using a chal-<br>
lenge toxin of a known LD50 (Median Lethal dose), or an<br>
assay of toxin-neutralizing activity of antisera, in<br>
accordance with the provision entitled "tetanus toxoid"<br>
or the provision entitled "adsorbed tetanus toxoid" in<br>
the Notification No. 217 of the Japanese Ministry of<br>
Health and Welfare: "Seibutsugakuteki Seizai Kijun<br>
(Minimum Requirements for Biological Products)". In<br>
addition to the above-mentioned tests, in the present<br>
invention, the relative immunopotency of FFA to that of<br>
the whole tetanus toxoid is measured by performing a<br>
further potency assay using a challenge toxin, wherein<br>
the score method (Reference Example 15) is employed.<br>
(11) Animal tests on the adverse side effects of FFA tetanus<br>
toxoid:<br>
Animal tests on the side effects of the FFA teta-<br>
nus vaccine of the present invention can be conducted<br>
in accordance with conventional methods. Examples of<br>
animal tests which can be employed for evaluating the<br>
adverse side effects of tetanus toxoid include the<br>
passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) test using rats<br>
which is based on an immediate type allergic reaction,<br>
the footpad reaction test using mice which is based on<br>
a delayed type allergic reaction, and the intradermal<br>
reaction test using guinea pigs (Reference Example 16)<br>
which test is based on a delayed type allergic reac-<br>
tion.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinbelow, the present invention will be de-<br>
scribed in more detail with reference to the following<br>
Examples and Reference Examples, but they should not be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the present inven-<br>
tion.<br>
In the following Reference Examples, the guide-<br>
lines for carrying out the present invention are spe-<br>
cifically shown.<br>
[Reference Example 1] Isolation of a single colony of<br>
a C. tetani strain having high toxin-producing ability:<br>
Colonies of C. tetani Harvard A47 strain are<br>
formed on a plate of Zeissler"s blood agar [prepared by<br>
adding glucose and defibrinated bovine blood to a<br>
commercially available non-modified agar medium in such<br>
amounts as would give a final glucose concentration of<br>
2 % (w/v) and a final defibrinated bovine blood concen-<br>
tration of 20 % (v/v), followed by mixing], and the<br>
formed colonies are individually inoculated into a<br>
modified Latham medium (see Reference Example 3 below)<br>
and incubated to obtain cultures. With respect to each<br>
of the obtained cultures, the Lf value is measured in<br>
accordance with the method as described in Reference<br>
Example 5 below. From the above-mentioned colonies,<br>
the colony used for the culture having the highest Lf<br>
value is used as a Biken substrain of the C. tetani<br>
Harvard A47 strain, which has high toxin-producing<br>
ability. <br>
[Reference Example 2] Preparation of transformants<br>
having/high/toxin-producing ability for FFA:<br>
A DNA of tetanus toxin gene [see EMBO JOURNAL,<br>
5(10), 2495-2502, 1986 and Nucleic Acid Research<br>
14(19), 7809-7812, 1986] is digested with the restric-<br>
tion enzymes, thereby obtaining a 2.7 kb DNA fragment<br>
(Stu I-Bsp HI) coding for FFA. The obtained DNA frag-<br>
ment is inserted into and ligated to pSN508 [which is a<br>
vector capable of a large-quantity expression in E.<br>
coli (see U-S. Patent No. 4,703,005)] to obtain a<br>
recombinant expression vector. Then, the obtained<br>
recombinant expression vector is introduced into E.<br>
coli strain CSH26 to form transformants having high<br>
toxin-producing ability for FFA. When the production<br>
of the FFA is conducted by culturing the above-men-<br>
tioned transformants, it is not necessary to perform <br>
the treatments described.below, such as a protease <br>
digestion of the whole tetanus toxin molecule, and a<br>
treatment using dithiothreitol or urea, but purifica-<br>
tion is necessary.<br>

toxin-containing solution which have been prepared by<br>
successively diluting tetanus toxin at logarithmic<br>
intervals of 10 is individually injected subcutane-<br>
ously or intramuscularly to 0F1 mice (weighing 20 to 25<br>

determined, based on the dose (log. of dose)-response<br>
(time to death) curve [see "Proceedings of the 6th<br>
International Conference on Tetanus (Lyon, 1981)" pp.<br>
21-32].<br>
[Reference Example 5] Lf unit (Unit of Flocculation):<br>
The Lf value of a toxin solution can be measured<br>
by the Ramon"s method. (Biken Journal, 7, 137-152,<br>
1964). 1 Lf of the toxin, which is the amount of the<br>
toxin which reacts with 1 unit of the antitoxin, is<br>
measured. Also, the measurement of the above-mentioned<br>
Lf value can be conducted using SRID (Single Radial<br>
Immunodiffusion) (see Immunochemistry, 2, 235-254,<br>
1965).<br>
[Reference Example 6] Measurement of protein content:<br>
The protein content is measured in accordance with<br>
the "modified method of Lowry et al." in which the<br>
color reaction of a protein and a phenol reagent is<br>
evaluated by colorimetry. Hereinafter, this method is<br>
simply referred to as a "phenol reagent method".<br>
[Reference Example 7] Identification of protein frac-<br>
tions and comparison on protein concentrations between<br>
the protein fractions:<br>
The identification of protein fractions and the<br>
comparison on protein concentrations between the pro-<br>
tein fractions are conducted by measuring the absor-<br>
bance of ultraviolet rays having a wave length of 280<br>
nm (hereinafter, referred to as an "absorbance at 280<br>
nm") of a sample.<br>
[Reference Example 8] Preparation of a DTT-Tris buffer<br>
(100 mM):<br>
A DTT-Tris buffer is prepared by mixing 50 mM<br>
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-HCl (hereinafter,<br>
simply referred to as "Tris"), 1 mM ethylenediamine-<br>
tetraacetate-4 Na (hereinafter, simply referred to as<br>
"EDTA") and 100 mM DTT. The pH of the DTT-Tris buffer<br>
is adjusted to 8.2 using 1/10 M HC1.<br>
[Reference Example 9] Preparation of a phosphate<br>
buffer:<br>
A phosphate buffer is prepared by mixing equal<br>
molar amounts of disodium monohydrogenphosphate and<br>
potassium dihydrogenphosphate solutions. The amounts<br>
of the solutions to be mixed are appropriately chosen<br>
so that the resultant phosphate buffer has a desired pH<br>
value.<br>
[Reference Example 10] Measurement of the molecular<br>
weights of proteins by using SDS-PAGE:<br>
In the SDS-PAGE, an SDS-PAGE gel having a gel<br>
content of 7.5 % (w/v), 7.0 % (w/v) (containing 2M<br>
urea), 5.0 % (w/v) or the like can be used. As a<br>
buffer solution, for example, 10 mM Tris-77 mM glycine<br>
buffer (pH 8.6) can be used. After the electrophore-<br>
sis, the gel is stained using Coomassie brilliant blue.<br>
The molecular weight of each of the proteins is indi-<br>
vidually determined from the ratio of the migration<br>
distance of the sample protein to the migration dis-<br>
tance of the marker dye or the protein having known<br>
molecular weight. As a result of the measurements<br>
conducted in accordance with the above method, it is<br>
found that the molecular weights (x 10 ) of the FFA and<br>
the whole tetanus toxin molecule are 100,000 and<br>
150,000, respectively.<br>
[Reference Example 11] Determination of the antigenic<br>
specificity by using double immunodifusion:<br>
The antigenic specificity is determined by the<br>
method of Ouchterlony using 1 % (w/v) agarose in 50 mM<br>
Tris-0.6 M Glycine buffer (containing 1 mM EDTA; pH<br>
8.5) and horse anti-tetanus toxin serum from which<br>
nonspecific antibodies are removed. A cross-reaction<br>
of antigenicity is observed between the FFA and the<br>
whole tetanus toxin molecule.<br>
[Reference Example 12] Determination of the amino acid<br>
sequence of the FFA:<br>
The determination of the amino acid sequence of<br>
the FFA is conducted using an automatic amino acid<br>
sequencer, such as Applied Biosystem Procise Type 492<br>
manufactured and sold by Perkin Elmer, U.S.A. The FFA<br>
obtained in Example 1 below has N-terminal amino acid<br>
sequence (7) of Fig. 2(a), and the FFA obtained in<br>
Example 7 below has N-terminal amino acid sequence (4)<br>
of Fig. 2(a). Further, by appropriately choosing the<br>
conditions for cultivation of C. tetani, an FFA having<br>
N-terminal amino acid sequence (8) of Fig. 2(a) can be<br>
obtained. FFA"s respectively having N-terminal amino<br>
acid sequences (1) to (3) and (6) of Fig. 2(a) can be<br>
prepared from the intracellular tetanus toxin by appro-<br>
priately choosing the conditions for digesting the<br>
intracellular tetanus toxin molecule with trypsin to<br>
convert the toxin molecule to a nicked form thereof,<br>
such as an enzyme concentration, a reaction time and a<br>
reaction temperature- An FFA preparation having N-<br>
terminal amino acid sequence (5) of Fig. 2(a) can be<br>
prepared by digesting the intracellular tetanus toxin<br>
molecule with chymotrypsin to convert the toxin mol-<br>
ecule to a nicked form thereof. Thus, in the present<br>
invention, 8 different types of FFA"s respectively<br>
having N-terminal amino acid sequences (1) to (8) of<br>
Fig. 2(a) can be obtained. These 8 types of FFA"s may<br>
be used as an active component of a tetanus vaccine<br>
individually or in combination.<br>
[Reference Example 13] Determination of the isoelec-<br>
tric point of FFA:<br>
The isoelectric point of FFA is determined by an<br>
isoelectric focusing method using a commercially avail-<br>
able gel, for example, a gel manufactured and sold<br>
under the tradename "Phast Gel IEP 3-9" by Pharmacia<br>
Biotech, Sweden. As a result of the measurements<br>
conducted in the Examples in accordance with the above<br>
method, it was found that the FFA of the present inven-<br>
tion has an isoelectric point within the range of 7.25<br>
± 0.5.<br>
[Reference Example 14] Preparation of the whole teta-<br>
nus toxin molecule:<br>
The seed culture of the C. tetani strain obtained<br>
in Reference Example 1 is inoculated into a culture<br>
medium described in Reference Example 3 for 44 hours<br>
and the bacterial cells are harvested by centrifugation<br>
at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 25 minutes. 1 M NaCl solu-<br>
tion containing 0.1 M sodium citrate is added in an<br>
amount of 1/30 volume of the cell culture to extract<br>
the intracellular toxin by gentle agitation. The<br>
resultant mixture is stirred at 4 °C overnight to<br>
extract tetanus toxin, and then is centrifuged at<br>
10,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 minutes to remove cells and<br>
cell debris. Using the resultant supernatant as a<br>
starting material, the toxin is purfied in substantial-<br>
ly the same manner as in Example 1 below to obtain a<br>
purified whole tetanus toxin preparation.<br>
[Reference Example 15] Score method for evaluating<br>
immunopotency:<br>
Relative potency of tetanus toxoid is evaluated<br>
using a score method. Illustratively stated, animals<br>
for immunological experiment, which have been injected<br>
with tetanus vaccine, are challenged with toxin, and<br>
observed over a week for the symptoms of tetanus. The<br>
severity of the symptons was evaluated in accordance<br>
with the following criteria by the score method:<br>
Results Score<br>
The animal dies on the 1st day: 0<br>
The animal dies on the 2nd day: 1<br>
The animal dies on the 3rd day: 2<br>
The animal dies or exhibits serious<br>
symptoms (such as a tonic convulsion,<br>
a difficulty in walking and a respiratory<br>
distress) between the 4th and 7th day: 3<br>
The animal survives through one week<br>
with slight symptoms [such as a local<br>
paralysis of the abdominal muscle on a<br>
side opposite to the side on which the<br>
injection had been made (this symptom is<br>
checked by observing the animal hung by<br>
its tail)]: 4<br>
The animal survives through one week<br>
without any symptom: 8<br>
The obtained scores are analyzed by a computer<br>
using a software designed for statistical analysis for<br>
the parallel-line assay, in which the correlation<br>
analysis of the scores is conducted in terms of uni-<br>
formity, linearity and parallelity to evaluate the<br>
relative immunopotency of the tetanus toxoid to that of<br>
the standard tetanus whole toxin toxoid of a known<br>
international units.<br>
[Reference Example 16] Intradermal reaction using<br>
Guinea pigs:<br>
Three groups of guinea pigs are sensitized by<br>
intramuscular injection with 1 ml of tetanus vaccine<br>
(10 ug protein/ml) per 1 guinea pig, wherein the above-<br>
mentioned three groups of guinea pigs are sensitized<br>
with (1) commercially available partially purified<br>
whole toxin toxoid, (2) purified whole toxin toxoid and<br>
(3) FFA vaccine, respctively. After 4 weeks from the<br>
sensitization, the back of each of the guinea pigs is<br>
shaved and then, the guinea pigs are individually<br>
injected intradermally with 0.1 ml of the above-men-<br>
tioned tetanus toxoid onto the back thereof. The<br>
protein concentration of the tetanus toxin solution is<br>
varied (32.0, 10.0 and 3.2 ug) depending on the group<br>
to which a guinea pig belongs. 24 hours after the<br>
injection, with respect to each of the guinea pigs, the<br>
portion which has been injected is examined to see<br>
whether or not a skin reaction, an erythema, an indura-<br>
tion and/or a necrosis occurs. When the occurrence of<br>
an erythema is observed, the diameter of the erythema<br>
is measured.<br>
Example 1<br>
(1) Production and purification of the whole tetanus<br>
toxin molecule (nicked form)<br>
Into each of 20 tubes (diameter: 6 cm; height: 38<br>
cm) containing 450 ml of a modified Latham medium (see<br>
Reference Example 3), 5 ml of the seed culture of a<br>
Biken substrain of the C. tetani Harvard A47 strain<br>
(see Reference Example 1) was inoculated. The tubes<br>
with loose cotton plugs were incubated at 35 CC for 5<br>
days until the cultures became clear. These cultures<br>
were centrifuged at 10,000 x g at 4 °C for 30 minutes<br>
to obtain clean culture supernatants. 8.5 liters of<br>
the culture supernatants thus obtained as starting<br>
materials were filtered and used for purification of<br>
whole tetanus toxin molecules (nicked form).<br>
A saturated solution (at 25 °C) of ammonium sul-<br>
fate (pH 7.0) was added to and mixed with the starting<br>
material in an ice-water bath to salt out a fraction<br>
having an ammonium sulfate saturation of 20 % to 40 %.<br>
The obtained fraction was suspended in 65 ml of 0.06 M<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 4 °C) (see Reference Example<br>
9) to obtain a suspension having an ammonium sulfate<br>
saturation of 40 %. The obtained suspension was sub-<br>
jected to centrifugation at 15,000 x g at 4 °C for 30<br>
minutes to obtain a precipitate. The obtained pre-<br>
cipitate was washed by resuspending the precipitate in<br>
22 ml of the above-mentioned phosphate buffer, and the<br>
resultant was subjected to centrifugation under the<br>
same centrifugation conditions as mentioned above. The<br>
washed precipitate was dissolved in 22 ml of 0.1 M<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 4 °C) and subjected to ultra-<br>
centrifugation at 100,000 x g at 4 °C for 2 hours to<br>
remove the precipitated residue, thereby obtaining 20<br>
ml of a supernatant. The obtained supernatant was<br>
filtered through Acrodisc membrane (pore diameter: 0.2<br>
urn) (manufactured and sold by Gelman Co. Ltd.,<br>
Germany), and the resultant filtrate of partially<br>
purified toxin was subjected to gel filtration by using<br>
Ultrogel AcA 34 column (inner diameter: 2.5 cm, length:<br>
100 cm) (manufactured and sold by LKB-Pharmacia, Swe-<br>
den) equilibrated with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).<br>
In the gel filtration, elution was carried out at 4 °C<br>
using the above-mentioned phosphate buffer (flow rate:<br>
9 ml/hr), and the resultant eluate was fractioned into<br>
1 ml fractions. With respect to each of the fractions,<br>
an absorbance at 280 nm (see Reference Example 7) was<br>
measured. The fractions having a high absorbance were<br>
pooled, thereby obtaining a gel filtration eluate in a<br>
total volume of 5 ml.<br>
With respect to the obtained eluate, the measure-<br>
ment of the protein content in accordance with the<br>
phenol reagent method (see Reference Example 6), the<br>
measurement of MLD per 1 mg of protein (see Reference<br>
Example 4) and the measurement of Lf per 1 mg of pro-<br>
tein (see Reference Example 5) were conducted. As a<br>
result, the protein content of the eluate was 60 mg/ml,<br>
Lf was 400 and MLD was 3.5 x 107.<br>
Further, 0.2 ml of the eluate was subjected to<br>
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using TSK<br>
G3000 SW column (inner diameter: 0.75 cm, length: 60<br>
cm) (manufactured and sold by Tosoh Corp., Japan)<br>
equilibrated with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), in<br>
which elution was carried out using the above-mentioned<br>
phosphate buffer (flow rate: 0.6 ml/minute) to thereby<br>
obtain fractions. The absorbance at 280 nm of each of<br>
the fractions was measured. As a result, a single<br>
sharp peak was observed, which indicates that the whole<br>
tetanus toxin molecule was highly purified. In the<br>
preparation of FFA described below, the eluate obtained<br>
above was used as a solution of a highly purified<br>
entire length tetanus toxin molecule (nicked form)<br>
(i.e., a highly purified tetanus toxin solution).<br>
(2) Preparation of FFA<br>
18 ml of a DTT-Tris buffer (see Reference Example<br>
8) was added to 2 ml of the highly purified tetanus<br>
toxin solution, followed by mixing. The resultant<br>
mixture was reacted at 25 °C for 60 minutes to reduce<br>
the disulfide bridge present in the whole tetanus toxin<br>
molecule. The resultant mixture was treated with urea<br>
by adding 4.8 g of a solid urea to the mixture, fol-<br>
lowed by mixing to dissolve the solid urea in the<br>
mixture (final urea concentration: 4 M). To the re-<br>
sultant was added 20 ml of 50 mM Tris buffer (contain-<br>
ing 0.6 M glycine, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT; pH 8.5) and<br>
the resultant mixture was condensed using Amicon Ultra-<br>
filtration System (manufactured and sold by Grace<br>
Company, USA), thereby obtaining 3 ml of a condensate.<br>
The obtained condensate was subjected to gel filtration<br>
by using Ultrogel AcA 44 column (inner diameter: 1.5<br>
cm, height: 90 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris buffer<br>
(containing 0.6 M glycine, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT and 2<br>
M urea; pH 8.5). In the gel filtration, elution was<br>
carried out using the above-mentioned 50 mM Tris buffer<br>
(flow rate: 5 ml/hr) and the resultant eluate was<br>
fractioned into 1.2 ml fractions. With respect to each<br>
of the fractions, the absorbance at 280 nm was meas-<br>
ured. As a result, two peaks (peak 1 and peak 2) were<br>
observed. From the obtained fractions including two<br>
fractions each exhibiting a peak at 280 nm (i.e., a<br>
peak 1 fraction and a peak 2 fraction, wherein the peak<br>
1 fraction was obtained earlier than the peak 2 frac-<br>
tion), a set of 5 fractions (total amount: 6 ml) suc-<br>
cessively obtained starting from the peak 1 fraction<br>
and another set of 5 fractions (total amount: 6 ml)<br>
successively obtained starting from the peak 2 fraction<br>
were collected to obtain a collected fraction 1 and a<br>
collected fraction 2, respectively.<br>
Each of the highly purified tetanus toxin solu-<br>
tion, the collected fraction 1 and the collected frac-<br>
tion 2 was subjected to SDS-PAGE (see Reference Example<br>
10) for determination of the approximate molecular<br>
weight and to gel precipitation reaction (see Reference<br>
Example 11) for determination of the antigenicity. As a<br>
result, the molecular weights of the purified tetanus<br>
toxin, the collected fraction 1 and the collected<br>
fraction 2 were approximately 150,000, 100,000 and<br>
50,000, respectively. With respect to the antigenici-<br>
ty, the cross-reaction of the antigenicity was observed<br>
between the highly purified tetanus toxin solution and<br>
each of the collected fraction 1 and the collected<br>
fraction 2, whereas no cross-reaction was observed<br>
between the collected fraction 1 fraction and the<br>
collected fraction 2, which indicates that these two<br>
types of collected fractions had completely different<br>
antigenicities. Further, the protein contents of the<br>
collected fraction 1 and the collected fraction 2 were<br>
determined by the phenol reagent method. The protein<br>
contents of the collected fraction 1 and the collected<br>
fraction 2 were 15 mg/ml and 8 mg/ml, respectively.<br>
From the above results, it was confirmed that the<br>
collected fraction 1 contains FFA. In the operations<br>
described below, the collected fraction 1 was used as<br>
an FFA solution.<br>
(3) Stabilization of the FFA<br>
4 ml of the FFA solution was dialyzed against<br>
1/15 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) at 4 °C overnight.<br>
After completion of the dialysis, the above-mentioned<br>
phosphate buffer was added to and mixed with the dia-<br>
lyzed FFA solution to thereby obtain a solution having<br>
a total volume of 380 ml. 20 ml of 500 mM lysine<br>
solution was added to the above-mentioned FFA solution<br>
so that the protein content of the FFA solution became<br>
600 ug/ml. To the resultant FFA solution was added<br>
formalin in an amount such that the final formalin<br>
concentration became 0.2 % (v/v), and the resultant<br>
mixture was subjected to incubation at 37 °C for 14<br>
days to stabilize the FFA. Then, the stabilized FFA<br>
was dialyzed against a 0.85 % (w/v) NaCl solution at<br>
4 °C overnight to remove formaldehyde and lysine, and<br>
the dialyzate was filtered through Acrodisc membrane<br>
(pore diameter: 0.22 urn) for sterilization, thereby<br>
obtaining 380 ml of a filtrate. The obtained filtrate<br>
was stored at 4 °C, and was used as a bulk FFA tetanus<br>
vaccine solution described below.<br>
(4) Preparation of a sample FFA tetanus vaccine<br>
The bulk FFA tetanus vaccine solution was diluted<br>
with a 0.85 % (w/v) NaCl solution so as to obtain a<br>
diluted solution having a final protein concentration<br>
of 50 ug/ml. An equivolume of Al(OH)g gel suspension<br>
[Al(0H)3 content: 2 mg/ml] was added to the obtained<br>
diluted solution, followed by mixing. The resultant<br>
mixture was allowed to stand at 4 °C overnight so that<br>
the FFA was adsorbed on the Al(0H)3 gel, thereby ob-<br>
taining a sample vaccine. With respect to the obtained<br>
sample vaccine, the activities thereof (immunopotency)<br>
and the safety thereof (toxicity or adverse side ef-<br>
fects) were evaluated as described below.<br>
(5) Evaluation of the immunopotency of the sample FFA<br>
tetanus vaccine<br>
The evaluation of the immunopotency of the sample<br>
FFA tetanus vaccine was conducted by experiments using<br>
mice. As a control, another vaccine was prepared in<br>
substantially the same manner as in the items (3) and<br>
(4) above, except that the solution of the whole teta-<br>
nus toxin molecule prepared in Reference Example 14 was<br>
used. With respect to each of the sample vaccine and<br>
the control vaccine, serial 2.5-fold dilution with a<br>
0.85 % (w/v) NaCl solution was conducted to obtain<br>
dilutions having different dilution ratios, which were<br>
administered to mice as described below, wherein at<br>
least three dilutions had dilution ratios such that the<br>
dilutions exhibited dose-response relationships falling<br>
within the linear region of the dose-response curve.<br>
Using the obtained vaccine dilutions (i.e., sample<br>
vaccine dilutions and control vaccine dilutions), the<br>
immunization of mice was conducted as follows. The<br>
sample vaccine dilutions (each having the amount of<br>
0.5 ml) were, respectively, administered to 10 randomly<br>
selected ddy/s female mice (each weighing 22 to 26 g)<br>
by subcutaneous injection to the inside of the thigh of<br>
the left hind leg. Four weeks after the injection,<br>
each of the immunized mice was challenged with 100 LD50<br>
standard toxin (Lot TA-4B) (provided by the National<br>
Institute of Health of Japan) by subcutaneous injec-<br>
tion. The above operations were also conducted using<br>
the control vaccine dilutions instead of the sample<br>
vaccine dilutions. After the above operations, ob-<br>
servations were made over a week as to whether or not<br>
the mice were alive, and as to the symptoms of the mice<br>
which were alive. Results of the observations were<br>
evaluated by the score method (see Reference Example<br>
15). The obtained scores were analyzed with respect to<br>
variance and correlation by a computer using a software<br>
for the statistical analysis. From the results of the<br>
statistical analysis, the relative immunopotency of the<br>
sample FFA tetanus vaccine (the ratio of the immunopot-<br>
ency of the sample vaccine relative to the immunopoten-<br>
cy of the vaccine comprising the whole tetanus toxin<br>
toxoid, wherein the immunopotency of the control vac-<br>
cine is defined as 1.0) was calculated. The above<br>
experiment was repeated four times, and the obtained<br>
values of the relative immunopotency were statistically<br>
analyzed by a computer. Results are shown in Table 1.<br>
The immunopotency of the sample FFA tetanus vaccine was<br>
substantially the same as that of the control vaccine<br>
comprising the whole tetanus toxin toxoid.<br>
(6) Experiments using guinea pigs to evaluate the<br>
degree of adverse side reactions caused by the<br>
intradermal reaction of the sample FFA tetanus vaccine.<br>
The intradermal reactions were conducted using<br>
guinea pigs (std. Hartley, weighing 300 to 350 g, 5<br>
weeks old, female) (obtained from Japan SLC, Inc.,<br>
Japan) in accordance with the method described in<br>
Reference Example 16. The sensitization of the guinea<br>
pigs was conducted as follows. As antigens for sensi-<br>
tizing the guinea pigs, use was made of the sample FFA<br>
tetanus vaccine (FFA), a commercially available tetanus<br>
toxoid presumably containing a whole tetanus toxin<br>
toxoid (conventional toxoid) and the vaccine comprising<br>
the purified whole tetanus toxin toxoid (whole toxin<br>
toxoid). Each of these antigens was diluted using a<br>
0.85 % (w/v) NaCl solution so that the final protein<br>
concentration and the final Al(0H)3 concentration<br>
became 10 ug/ml and 0.2 mg/ml, respectively, to thereby<br>
obtain three types of antigen dilutions. The guinea<br>
pigs were randomly divided into nine groups each con-<br>
sisting of three guinea pigs, and the above-obtained<br>
three types of the antigen dilutions were, respective-<br>
ly, administered to three guinea pigs of each of the<br>
nine groups. After completion of the sensitization<br>
period (4 weeks), the sensitized guinea pigs were<br>
challenged by the above-mentioned antigens by the<br>
following method. With respect to each of the above-<br>
mentioned antigens, three types of dilutions thereof<br>
respectively having final protein concentrations of<br>
3.2, 1.0 and 0.32 ug/ml were prepared using a 0.85 %<br>
(w/v) NaCl solution. The resultant nine types of<br>
dilutions (consisting of three types of dilutions of<br>
the FFA, three types of dilutions of the conventional<br>
toxoid and three types of dilutions of the whole toxin<br>
toxoid) were administered to the guinea pigs so that<br>
the guinea pigs belonging to the same group took the<br>
administration of the same type of dilution, wherein<br>
the dose of each of the dilutions was 0.1 ml. As a<br>
control, 0.1 ml of a 0.85 % (w/v) NaCl solution was<br>
intradermally injected to each of three guinea pigs<br>
which had respectively been sensitized with the above-<br>
mentioned antigens in substantially the same manner as<br>
mentioned above. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
With respect to each of the guinea pigs which had taken<br>
the administration of the sample FFA tetanus vaccine,<br>
the occurrence of the intradermal reaction was either<br>
undetectable or markedly slight as compared to that of<br>
the guinea pigs which had taken the administration of<br>
the conventional vaccine and the guinea pigs which had<br>
taken the administration of the vaccine comprising the<br>
whole tetanus toxin toxoid.<br>
Example 2<br>
(1) Preparation of the bulk FFA tetanus vaccine solu-<br>
tion<br>
0.5 Liter of a seed culture of a Biken substrain<br>
of C. tetani Harvard A47 strain was inoculated in 80<br>
liters of the modified Latham medium contained in a<br>
stainless steel tank having a volume of 100 liters<br>
(diameter: 60 cm, height: 50 cm). The tank was sealed<br>
by means of a silicone sheet, and the seed culture was<br>
incubated at 35 °C for 6 days to thereby obtain a<br>
culture. The obtained culture was filtered through a<br>
celite-filter paper for sterilization, thereby obtain-<br>
ing 75 liters of a filtrate. The obtained filtrate was<br>
concentrated using the "pericon cassette system"<br>
(manufactured and sold by Millipore, U.S.A.), thereby<br>
obtaining 7 liters of a condensate. Using the obtained<br>
condensate as a starting material, the purification of<br>
the whole tetanus toxin molecule, the preparation of<br>
the FFA and the stabilization of the FFA were performed<br>
in substantially the same manner as in Example 1,<br>
thereby obtaining 450 ml of a bulk FFA tetanus vaccine<br>
solution having a protein concentration of 600 ug/ ml.<br>
(2) Production of an FFA tetanus plain vaccine prepa-<br>
ration<br>
The bulk FFA tetanus vaccine solution obtained<br>
above was diluted using 1/75 M phosphate buffer (pH<br>
6.5) so that the final protein concentration of the<br>
vaccine preparation would become 60 ug/ml. To the re-<br>
sultant dilution were individually added sucrose, L-<br>
arginine and Haemaccel (manufactured and sold by Hoech-<br>
st Aktiengesellschaft, Germany) in this order in<br>
amounts such that the final concentrations of sucrose,<br>
L-arginine and Haemaccel became 3 % (w/v), 1 % (w/v)<br>
and 2 % (w/v), respectively, followed by mixing to<br>
obtain a single-antigen vaccine preparation. The<br>
obtained preparation was dispensed in glass vials each<br>
having a volume of 1 ml, so that each vial contained<br>
0-6 ml of the preparation, and then, the vials were<br>
sealed. The obtained single-antigen vaccine prepara-<br>
tion was subjected to various tests in accordance with<br>
a provision entitled "tetanus toxoid" in the Notifica-<br>
tion No. 217 of the Japanese Ministry of Health and<br>
Welfare: "Seibutsugakuteki Seizai Kijun (Minimum Re-<br>

obtained preparation was verified as a qualified vac-<br>
cine.<br>
Example 3<br>
Production of an adsorbed FFA tetanus vaccine prepara-<br>
tion<br>
The bulk FFA tetanus vaccine solution obtained in<br>
Example 2 was diluted using 1/40 M phosphate buffer (pH<br>
6.0) so that the final protein concentration of the<br>
vaccine preparation became 60 ug/ml. To the resultant<br>
dilution was added an aluminum phosphate gel in an<br>
amount such that the final aluminum phosphate gel<br>
concentration of the vaccine preparation became<br>
0.2 ml/ml, thereby obtaining a mixture. The obtained<br>
mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 5 hours so as to adsorb<br>
the FFA on the aluminum phosphate gel. The resultant<br>
mixture was subjected to centrifugation at 2000 rpm for<br>
20 minutes at 4 "C to collect the gel. The collected<br>
gel was suspended in 1/75 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.5).<br>
To the resultant suspension were added sucrose, L-<br>
arginine and Haemaccel (manufactured and sold by<br>
Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft, Germany) in this order in<br>
amounts such that the final concentrations of sucrose,<br>
L-arginine and Haemaccel became 3 % (w/v), 1 % (w/v)<br>
and 2 % (w/v), respectively, followed by mixing to<br>
obtain an adsorbed FFA tetanus vaccine preparation.<br>
The obtained preparation was dispensed in glass vials<br>
having a volume of 1 ml so that each vial contained 0.6<br>
ml of the preparation, and then, the vials were sealed.<br>
The obtained adsorbed FFA tetanus vaccine preparation<br>
was subjected to various tests in accordance with a<br>
provision entitled "adsorbed tetanus toxoid" in the<br>
Notification No. 217 of the Japanese Ministry of Health<br>
and Welfare: "Seibutsugakuteki Seizai Kijun (Minimum<br>

vaccine.<br>
Example 4<br>
Production of an adsorbed DPT combined vaccine<br>
preparation using an FFA tetanus vaccine<br>
An adsorbed FFA vaccine was prepared in substan-<br>
tially the same manner as in Example 3, except that the<br>
final protein concentration of the adsorbed FFA tetanus<br>
vaccine was changed to 180 ug/ml. An adsorbed<br>
diphtheria toxoid and an adsorbed pertussis vaccine<br>
were individually prepared so that each of the toxoid<br>
concentration and the vaccine concentration became<br>
three times that of the working concentration. The<br>
adsorbed FFA tetanus vaccine, the adsorbed diphtheria<br>
toxoid and the adsorbed pertussis vaccine were mixed<br>
together to obtain an adsorbed DPT combined vaccine<br>
preparation- The obtained preparation was dispensed in<br>
glass vials each having a volume of 10 ml so that each<br>
vial contained 10 ml of the preparation, and then, the<br>
vials were sealed. The adsorbed DPT combined vaccine<br>
preparation was subjected to various tests in<br>
accordance with a provision entitled "adsorbed<br>
diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus combined vaccine" in the<br>
Notification No. 217 of the Japanese Ministry of Health<br>
and Welfare: "Seibutsugakuteki Seizai Kijun (Minimum<br>
Requirements for Biological Products)". As a result,<br>

combined vaccine.<br>
Example 5<br>
Production of an adsorbed DT combined vaccine<br>
preparation using an FFA tetanus vaccine<br>
An adsorbed FFA tetanus vaccine was prepared in<br>
substantially the same manner as in Example 3, except<br>
that the final protein concentration of the adsorbed<br>
FFA tetanus vaccine was changed to 120 ug/ml. An ad-<br>
sorbed diphtheria toxoid was prepared so that the<br>
toxoid concentration became two times that of the<br>
working concentration. The adsorbed FFA tetanus vac-<br>
cine and the diphtheria toxoid were mixed together to<br>
obtain an adsorbed DT combined vaccine preparation.<br>
The obtained preparation was dispensed in glass vials<br>
each having a volume of 1 ml so that each vial<br>
contained 0.6 ml of the preparation, and then, the<br>
vials were sealed. The obtained adsorbed DT combined<br>
vaccine preparation was subjected to various tests in<br>
accordance with a provision entitled "adsorbed<br>
diphtheria-tetanus combined vaccine" in the<br>
Notification No. 217 of the Japanese Ministry of Health<br>
and Welfare: "Seibutsugakuteki Seizai Kijun (Minimum<br>

Ministry of Health and Welfare "Seibutsugakuteki Seizai<br>
Kijun (Minimum Requirements for Biological Products)".<br>
As a result, the obtained preparation was verified as a<br>
qualified combined vaccine.<br>
Example 7<br>
Production of a sample FFA tetanus vaccine and evalua-<br>
tion of the immunopotency thereof<br>
The production of the vaccine using the extracell-<br>
ular toxin and the evaluation of the immunopotency of<br>
the produced vaccine were conducted in substantially<br>
the same manner as in Example 1, except that the condi-<br>
tions employed were changed as follows.<br>
The time for culturing the seed culture of C.<br>
tetani at 35 °C was changed to 6 days. The preparation<br>
of the FFA from the solution of the whole tetanus toxin<br>
molecule (nicked form) obtained by gel filtration using<br>
Ultrogel AcA 34 column was conducted as follows. A<br>
DTT-Tris buffer (see Reference Example 8) was added to<br>
the above-mentioned solution of the whole tetanus toxin<br>
molecule in an amount of 1 ml per 2 mg of the solution<br>
of the whole tetanus toxin molecule, followed by mix-<br>
ing. Then, the reaction was performed at 25 °C for 60<br>
minutes to reduce the disulfide bridge present in the<br>
toxin molecule. Subsequently, the resultant reaction<br>
mixture was treated with urea by addition of a solid<br>
urea in an amount such that the final urea concentra-<br>
tion became 4 M. The reaction mixture was applied to<br>
PD10 column (manufactured and sold by Pharmacia Bio-<br>
tech, Sweden) equilibrated with the Buffer A (0.2 mM<br>
Tris-HCl containing 2 M urea solution and 1 mM DTT; pH<br>
7.0) and the elution was carried out using the above-<br>
mentioned Buffer A to replace the DTT-Tris buffer in<br>
the reaction mixture with the Buffer A. The resultant<br>
eluate containing dissociated toxin was subjected to<br>
column chromatography using Mono Q column (manufactured<br>
and sold by LKB-Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) equilibrated<br>
with Buffer A, wherein the elution was carried out<br>
using FPLC (manufactured and sold by Pharmacia Biotech,<br>
Sweden) and Buffer B (formed by adding NaCl to Buffer<br>
A, wherein the NaCl concentration is increased by a<br>
linear gradient of from 0 to 0.5 M). With respect to<br>
the obtained eluate, analysis was made in the same<br>
manner as in Example 1. As a result, it was found<br>
that, among the fractions of the eluate exhibiting a<br>
peak at 280 nm, the fraction obtained earliest was the<br>
FFA.<br>
The stabilization of the FFA was conducted by<br>
incubating the FFA solution in a mixture of 0.067 M<br>
phosphate buffer (Na-K, pH 7.8) containing 0.2 % (v/v)<br>
of formalin, and 0.025 M lysine at 35 °C for 2 weeks.<br>
The obtained stabilized FFA was used to prepare the FFA<br>
tetanus vaccine.<br>
The evaluation of the immunopotency of the sample<br>
FFA tetanus vaccine was conducted by 4 sets of an<br>
experiment using mice in substantially the same manner<br>
as in item (5) of Example 1. Results are shown in<br>
Table 3. As can be clearly seen from Table 3, the<br>
immunopotency of the sample FFA tetanus vaccine had<br>
substantially the same level as that of the control<br>
vaccine comprising the whole tetanus toxin toxoid (i.<br>
e., a conventional tetanus toxoid).<br>
