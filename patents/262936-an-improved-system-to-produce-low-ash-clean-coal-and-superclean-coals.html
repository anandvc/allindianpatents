				<td>FIELD OF THE IVNETION<br>
The invention relates to an improved system to produce low ash clean coal from<br>
high ash coals for metallurgical applications. The invention further relates to a<br>
process to produce low ash clean coal with economic yield including producing of<br>
superclean coal from high ash coal.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The known process operation involves chemical beneficiation of coal by<br>
dissolving organic matter of coal in various organic solvents. As coal constitutes a<br>
heterogeneous mixture of organic and inorganic components, a step of solvolysis<br>
of the coal varies corresponding to its constituents, maturity, and structural<br>
characteristics. Main advantages of the solvolysis process are i) ease of recovery<br>
of the solvent in the main process stream, ii) a higher solvolytic efficiency of the<br>
recovered solvents as compared to that of fresh solvent, Hi) 95-98% recovery of<br>
the solvent, iv) improved coking properties of clean coal, and v) availability of<br>
industrial organic solvents. However, the operating cost of this process is high<br>
because of high cost of solvents and energy requirements in the process.<br>
Organo-refining or, solvent-refining, or, solvent extraction of coal is a well-<br>
established technology. Abundant literature is available on the subject. However,<br>
the primary objective in most of those cases is to provide a process to produce<br>
an ultra clean coal or a super clean coal with ash content less than 0,2%. The<br>
ahs content of this parent coal ( Run of Mine) is 25%. Exploratory study revealed<br>
that it is possible to extract 50% of the parent coal through this process of<br>
extraction of coal under reflux conditions at atmospheric pressure. The coa)<br>
contains almost 4% ash.<br>
The yield and the ash content of the super clean coal as obtainable is satisfactory<br>
according to the study reports. However, in an industrial set up to implement<br>
the studied process, the main concerning factor apart from yield is the ultimate<br>
economic viability of the process. As the process consumes a significant amount<br>
of heat for extraction, recovery of solvent is possible only after consumption of a<br>
large amount of heat, the combined effect of two heat consumption, leads the<br>
process towards uneconomic. Now if the said two heat consumptions are<br>
arranged on priority basis, then heat consumption for extraction is to be<br>
considered first. This is because the extraction is solely dependent upon the<br>
extraction temperature. This is the reason that this process is often called as<br>
thermal extraction process. So only the heat required for solvent recovery is left<br>
behind for minimization. Effective or optimized process of solvent recovery could<br>
be the only option to establish the process-feasibility.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose an improved process to<br>
produce low ash clean coal from high-ash coal, maintaining the process<br>
economy.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose an improved process to produce<br>
low ash clean coal from high-ash coal, which minimizes the heat-requirement for<br>
solvent recovery.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose an improved process to produce<br>
low ash clean coal from high-ash coal, which enables higher extraction from the<br>
parent coal.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a system to produce low-ash<br>
clean coal from high-ash coal.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure - 1 - schematically shows a system for industrially implementing the<br>
improved process according to the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The system of the invention has five different zone namely, (i) feed preparation<br>
zone (ii) extraction zone (iii) solvent recovery zone (iv) Precipitation zone (v)<br>
Organic water separation zone.<br>
Coal and solvent including co-solvent are mixed thoroughly in a coal-feed<br>
preparation zone. Coal slurry is then pumped into a reactor. In the reactor a<br>
temperature around 250° to 350°C is maintained by circulating hot thermic fluid.<br>
A high pressure is maintained by inducing a pressure about 3 to 4 atm. inside<br>
the a reactor. The high pressure elevates the boiling point of the solvent.<br>
Residence time in the reactor may vary form 1 h to 1.5 h which depends on the<br>
techno economics of the process and its specific requirement. Extracted coal-<br>
solvent mixture is then passed through a filter unit and the filtrate is then passed<br>
to a flash unit. In the flash unit, due to the sudden pressure drop in pressure, at<br>
least 70% of the solvent gets boiled off as the temperature of the solvent is in<br>
the reactor is much higher than the atmospheric boiling point of the solvent.<br>
Thus, a recovery of 70% of the solvent without introducing any external heat<br>
source can be achieved, as the reactor is maintained at a high pressure and<br>
temperature for flashing. The residue from the filter unit is taken off and stored<br>
for latter use. The filtrate contains little but coal extracts which is fed to the<br>
water in a precipitating tank. In the precipitating tank, the coal gets precipitated<br>
as water acts as an anti solvent. This slurry becomes filtered by another rotary<br>
drum filter and the super clean coal is collected as residue. The fi\trate contains<br>
water and organic mixture which is fed to a distillation unit and water and<br>
organic mixtures is separated. This way 50% yield of clean coal having less than<br>
4% ash is produced.<br>
As the solvent of use are organic and are flammable in nature, it may catch fire<br>
in contact with oxygen at high temperature. Therefore, there a is provision for<br>
Nitrogen flashing in the reactor and the Rotary drum filter unit.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure - 1 shows the inventive system. In the system, coal (A), and solvent (B)<br>
are mixed thoroughly in a feed - preparation zone of a reactor (C) to produce a<br>
coal slurry. The coal slurry is then extracted in the reactor (C). In the extraction<br>
unit (C), the temperature is raised (about 250 °C) to facilitate the extraction at a<br>
high pressure. The range of temperature and pressure variation is (250 °C to<br>
300 °C) and ( 3 atm. to 10 atm.). At the high pressure boiling of the liquid gets<br>
shifted to higher zone. Due to the thermal impact, the coal structure is relaxed<br>
and the process of extraction is enhanced. After extraction, the total slurry is<br>
then fed to a centrifuge filter (D), which is capable of withstanding high pressure<br>
and temperature. After filtration, the extract is then allowed to be flushed in a<br>
flush chamber (F) where due to sudden release of pressure, the solvent vapor<br>
comes out. As the extract remains much above than its boiling point (202 °C), at<br>
least 70% of the solvent is flushed out. The solvent vapor is then cooled and<br>
collected in a vessel (G) and sent for recycling. This way evaporation of the<br>
solvent is eliminated and a large amount of energy is saved.<br>
The main advantages of the invention achieved<br>
1. Generally solvent recovery is done by an evaporator which is normally<br>
used instead of a flush chamber (F). But according to the invention, the<br>
extraction temperature and pressure is used for recovery of atteast 70%<br>
solvent which could have been otherwise achieved by a costly evaporator.<br>
The invention thus eliminates the requirement of a costly equipment, and<br>
also helps to avoid an energy intensive operative. The flush chamber is a<br>
simple vessel which gives same amount of solvent without adding extra<br>
heat into the system.<br>
Main novelty of the process<br>
Elimination of an evaporator from the process operation by a flash chamber<br>
including maintaining a reactor Temperature and Pressure, according to the<br>
invention allows atleast 70% of the solvent be recovered.<br>
