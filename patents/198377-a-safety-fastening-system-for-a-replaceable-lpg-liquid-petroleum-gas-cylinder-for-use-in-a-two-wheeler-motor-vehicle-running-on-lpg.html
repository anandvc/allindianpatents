This invention relates to a safety fastening system for a relaceable LPG (liquid petroleum gas) cylinder for use in a two wheeler motor vehicle running on LPG.<br>
Use of LPG as fuel for propulsion of automobiles offers advantages of low running costs, lower emissions, longer engine life and lower maintenance costs when compared to their gasoline/diesel counterparts. LPG as fuel has also been found to be non-carcinogenic, non-lead bearing. It has further been found that leaner mixtures of LPG can be combusted and higher compression ratios can be obtained due to the higher octane number and because the fuel is in gaseous form.<br>
LPG is being commercially used in automobiles in Australia, Japan, USA, Holland, Italy, New Zealand among other countries.<br>
Efforts are being made in India, which has a huge motor vehicle population, for use of LPG in automobiles, with adequate safeguards. The LPG commercially available in India is a mixture of<br><br>
butane and propane with traces of other hydrocarbons.<br>
This invention proposes a safety fastening system for a replaceable LPG cylinder for use in a two wheeler motor vehicle running on LPG, the said system being adequately protected against all hazards which are the likely outcome of storing, carrying and utilising the said gas on a highly mobile two wheeler motor vehicle which is subject to hazards, such as, skidding, toppling and other forms of impact.<br>
This  invention also proposes a  system as aforesaid which is highly user-friendly in the operation  thereof including installation  and replacement of LPG cylinders in the vehicle.<br>
Various other advantages of the proposed system will be  apparent from the following further description.<br>
The safety fastening system for a -replaceable LPG cylinder for use in a two wheeler motor vehicle running on LPG, according to this invention, comprises a housing, the open top of which is<br><br>
provided with a removable cover, the housing being immovably locatable on the vehicle and accommodating a replaceable LPG cylinder therein, said cylinder being securely fastened to the housing; a pipeline for connecting the outlet of the cylinder to the engine of the vehicle; and means for permitting the LPG to flow through the pipeline only when the cylinder is fully fastened within the housing and the ignition switch of the vehicle is turned ON thereafter.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of this invention, wherein<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates the housing H accommodating the LPG cylinder C (cross-arm A open) not yet fastened in place (ignition switch I OFF and gas solenoid valve Z OFF)<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the housing H accommodating the LPG cylinder C (cross-arm A open) fastened to the base M of the housing, with the limit switch S1 closed on coming into pressure-contact with the<br><br>
bottom J of the cylinder (ignition switch ORP and gas solenoid valve Z OFF)<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the housing H accommodating the LPG cylinder C (cross-arm A clamped down) with the limit switch S2 closed on coming into pressure-contact with the cross-arm A (ignition switch I OFF and gas solenoid valve OFF).<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the housing H accommodating the LPG cylinder C (cross-arm A clamped down) with the limit switch S2 closed on coming into pressure-contact with the cross-arm A (ignition switch I ON and gas solenoid valve ON). Fig.   5 illustrates the general system layout<br>
Fig.   6 illustrates the layout of the limit switch,  solenoid valve,  ignition switch  and battery<br>
and<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates the layout of the selector switch arrangement.<br>
The housing H is open at its top HT. This housing<br><br>
is immovably locatable on the vehicle and provided with a cover for closing and opening the same. The housing is uncovered, whenever required, to obtain access to the interior.<br>
The housing is made of a strong material such as steel to protect the LPG cylinder and related fittings from shocks, impact with external objects and static and dynamic loads. The housing is provided with at least one vent-hole V , which is open to atmosphere and which allows escape of LPG in the event of a cylinder-leak occurring. In the drawings, the housing is shown to have two vent-holes V. Each vent-hole will be provided with flame proof gauze.<br>
The LPG cylinder C is accommodated within the housing H and securely fastened thereto.<br>
A pipeline P connects the outlet O of the cylinder to the engine E of the vehicle. The vaporizer VA and gas carburetor GC are shown connected to the pipeline.<br>
Means are provided for permitting the LPG to flow through the pipeline P to the engine E only when<br><br>
the cylinder C is fully fastened within the housing H and the ignition switch I of the vehicle is turned ON thereafter. Where provision is made for supply of alternative conventional fuel, the further requirement of flow of LPG through the pipeline P to the engine E is subject to the selector switch SW being operated to shut off such alternative supply as will hereinafter be clear.<br>
The bottom J of the cylinder C and the base M of the housing H are provided with fastening means for securely fastening the cylinder C to the said base M.<br>
One of possible forms of such fastening means is constituted by a foot-ring F provided at the bottom of the cylinder c. The foot-ring F is rigidly attached to the bottom J of the cylinder c. A diametral member D, which diametrally spans the foot-ring F is rigidly attached thereto. To the diametral member D a nut N is -fixed such that it is non-rotatable. To the base M of the housing H a threaded stud T is fixed. The stud T is  threadedly engageable with the nut N,  for<br><br>
enabling the bottom J of the cylinder to be securely fastened to the base M of the housing.<br>
The housing H is provided with a pivotably movable cross-arm A (pivoted at L) for being clamped down on the top Q of the cylinder C, to totally restrain movement of the cylinder in any direction. The cross-arm is securely fastened to the housing by a bolt G.<br>
One of possible means for permitting the LPG to flow through the pipeline P to the engine will now be described:<br>
A first normally-open limit switch S1 is provided within the housing H near its base M for coming into pressure-contact with the bottom J of the cylinder, whenever the cylinder occupies its lowermost position, after the nut N and threaded stud T are fully fastened.<br>
A second normally-open limit switch S2 is provided within the housing near the top Q of the cylinder for coming into pressure-contact with the cross arm A after it has been fully clamped down on the top Q of the cylinder. A normally-closed solenoid<br><br>
valve Z is provided for the pipeline P, the limit switches S1, S2 and the solenoid valve Z being included, in series, in the electrical circuit of the ignition switch I of the vehicle. The arrangement is such that when the limit switches S1, S2 are actuated to close, on achieving pressure-contact with the bottom J of the cylinder and with the cross arm A respectively; and when the ignition switch I is turned ON, the said circuit is closed to energise the normally-closed solenoid valve Z to open. Once open, LPG from the cylinder C flows through the pipeline P to the engine, subject to the action of the selector switch SW in cases where provision is made for alternative conventional fuel supply.<br>
The outlet O of the cylinder C is provided with a coupling R for connection to the pipeline P, the coupling being disposed horizontally so that the pipeline can also run horizontally within the housing and thus save housing space.<br>
The housing H is immovably located on the vehicle by securely attaching it to the  surrounding framework of the vehicle.<br><br>
As stated earlier, whenever there is provision for an alternative conventional fuel supply for the vehicle, the vehicle will receive LPG only if, in addition to the safety conditions set out above with regard to the system proposed herein, the LPG solenoid valve Z is ON and the conventional fuel supply is shut OFF by the selector switch SW switching OFF the gasoline solenoid valve GS. So also, the vehicle will receive conventional fuel supply only if, in addition to the safety conditions set out above with regard to the system proposed herein, the LPG supply is shut off by the selector switch SW by switching OFF the LPG solenoid valve z and switching ON the gasoline solenoid valve GS.<br>
In the drawings the excess flow cum shut off valve and the pressure relief valve provided for the cylinder are indicated by EF and PR respectively. A quick disconnect control QD is also provided for the cylinder. The gasoline tank is indicated by GT,<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention, in the use of such terms and<br><br>
expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the proposed safety fastening system are possible, without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
