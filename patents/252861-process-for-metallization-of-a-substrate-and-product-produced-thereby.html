PROCESS FOR METALLIZATION OF A SUBSTRATE AND<br>
PRODUCT PRODUCED THEREBY<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of the filing date of<br>
United States Application No. 10/794,482 filed March 5, 2004, the<br>
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the metallization<br>
of a substrate utilizing a transfer film, either in a selective<br>
or non-selective metallization process. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to such metallization processes, which<br>
include a protective coating over the metallized substrate during<br>
the metallization step, rather than as a separate procedure.<br>
Aspects of the invention also focus on an intermediate product<br>
formed from a transfer film, coating, e.g., a cured coating, and<br>
metal layer used in the transfer process. Additionally, the<br>
present invention relates to the resulting metallized substrate.<br>
Processes for the metallization of various substrates have<br>
been known for some time.  These methods are typically a two-step<br>
process.  The first step is to create a transfer mechanism.  The<br>
transfer mechanism  typically  comprises  a  transfer  film,  or<br>
carrier, coated with a lacquer release layer.  Metallic particles<br>
are then deposited onto the lacquer release layer by conventional<br>
methods such as vacuum deposition.  In the second step, adhesive<br>
material  is  applied to  a  substrate  whereupon  the  transfer<br>
mechanism is adhered,  with the metallic layer adjacent the<br>
adhesive coating.    After heating the various  elements,  the<br>
carrier layer is removed to reveal a metallic-coated substrate<br>
having a lacquered protective layer.  In conventional terms, this<br>
process is known in the art as "hot stamping."   While hot<br>
stamping is beneficial for some uses, it only enjoys limited<br>
applicability.<br>
Hot stamping may not be used with all substrates, as the<br>
heating process may be destructive. Also, it has been found that<br>
the hot stamped foil may separate from the substrate under<br>
aggressive conditions, if not under normal use.  Such separation<br><br>
is undesirable as it compromises the integrity of the finished<br>
product.  Hot stamped metallic foils are also not printable.<br>
U.S. 4,473,422 (H. Parker et al., issued Sept. 25, 1984)<br>
discloses more advanced techniques for metallizing a. substrate<br>
have subsequently been developed and are generally known in the<br>
art. One such method is to provide a transfer film having a<br>
coating layer and metallic layer on the film much like that of<br>
the hot stamping process. This three-part transfer film may then<br>
be adhered to a substrate using a pressure sensitive adhesive.<br>
Once the adhesive is cured, the film may be removed to reveal a<br>
substrate/ adhesive/ metal/ coating product. For purposes of the<br>
present invention, the designation a/b/c/d, etc., ±s used to<br>
describe various products, structures or constructions where "a"<br>
is the base layer and "b," "c," "d," etc. are successive layers<br>
of materials. Techniques of this type do not disclose the use of<br>
a 100% solids-containing, electron beam (EB) curable adhesive.<br>
As such, the substrate must be porous to permit a means of escape<br>
for the moisture or diluent contained in the uncured adhesive.<br>
In addition, this technique does not permit the selective<br>
metallization, or metallization in discontinuous regions, of the<br>
substrate. Rather, the metallization process must be conducted<br>
in a continuous sheet.<br>
Other processes for nonselectively metallizing a. substrate<br>
are also known. In one of these processes, U.S. 4,490,409 (S.<br>
Nablo, issued Dec. 25, 1984), a film is coated with, a release<br>
coat adhesive and a prime coat protective coating. Å metal layer<br>
is adhered to an electron beam radiation sensitive substrate,<br>
e.g., paper, with an adhesive. The various adhesive and the<br>
coating layers may be EB curable. When the film is removed after<br>
curing the release coat adhesive, prime coat protective coating,<br>
and metal layer adhesive, the release coat adhesive remains<br>
adhered to the film, leaving the prime coat protective coating as<br>
a layer above the metal. The final result is a substrate/<br>
adhesive/ metal layer/ protective coating system.<br>
Processes for the selective metallization of a substrate are<br>
also known.   One such process, U.S. 6,544,369 (Y. Kitamura et<br><br>
al., issued April 8, 2003), utilizes a two-part transfer film in<br>
its first step. The two-part transfer film comprises metal<br>
deposited directly onto a plastic film using conventional<br>
methods. No coating layer or prime coat is adhered to the<br>
transfer film between the metal and the plastic film. Å substrate is then introduced. Either the substrate or the metal<br>
side of the transfer film is selectively coated with an<br>
EB-curable adhesive. The substrate and the transfer film are<br>
then brought together and the adhesive is EB cured. The plastic<br>
film is then removed. The finished product is a<br>
substrate/adhesive/metal product. Of note, the metal layer of<br>
structures resulting from techniques of this type is exposed to<br>
the atmosphere, and not protected by a separate coating. Methods<br>
to improve this result are disclosed in the same reference.<br>
One such method is to coat the metal in a completely<br>
separate second process. In this process, a curable resin of a<br>
solvent type, aqueous type, and water soluble type, is described<br>
and may be applied to a transfer film. This two-part film may<br>
then be covered over the substrate/adhesive/metal product of the<br>
prior technique. Once the resin is cured, removal of the film<br>
reveals a protected, selectively metallized substrate. Although<br>
the selectively metallized substrate is protected, the protection<br>
covers the entire substrate and not merely the selectively<br>
metallized portion. This presents limitations, as the areas<br>
which are not metallized, but which are protected, may suffer<br>
from undesired effects, such as reduced sharpness or color<br>
brightness, among others.<br>
Notwithstanding these teachings, it would be advantageous to<br>
provide for the selective metallization of a substrate where the<br>
finished product comprises a substrate/adhesive/metal/coating<br>
system in a one-step process, particularly wherein the transfer<br>
film mechanism has been cured prior to curing of the adhesive.<br>
Furthermore, it would be desirable to produce a metallized<br>
structure in which the metallized portions, whether total or<br>
selective, have a well-defined, e.g., sharp or precise,<br>
separation from the non-metallized portions.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An embodiment of the invention provides a layered structure<br>
comprising at least one each of: (a) a substrate layer; (b) a<br>
metal-containing layer; (c) an adhesive-containing layer adhering<br>
said metal in said metal-containing layer to said substrate<br>
layer; and (d) a breakaway layer, having a top surface and a<br>
bottom surface, said bottom surface of said breakaway layer<br>
coating substantially only said metal of said metal-containing<br>
layer. Å further embodiment provides a metallized structure<br>
having selectively metallized areas. In accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the invention, there is disclosed a layered<br>
structure comprising at least one each of: (a) a substrate layer;<br>
(b)	a metal-containing layer; (c) an adhesive-containing layer<br>
adhering said metal in said metal-containing layer to said<br>
substrate layer; and (d) a breakaway layer, having a top surface<br>
and a bottom surface, said bottom surface of said breakaway layer<br>
coating substantially only said metal of said metal-containing<br>
layer. In another embodiment the breakaway layer has a cured<br>
elongation at break when tested in tension of less than about<br>
20%.<br>
In yet another embodiment there is provided a method of<br>
metallizing a substrate comprising the steps of: (a) providing a<br>
transfer film comprising a film layer and a metal layer bonded<br>
together by a cured breakaway layer; (b) providing a substrate;<br>
(c)	applying an electron beam curable transfer adhesive to at<br>
least a portion of said substrate; (d) securing said transfer<br>
film to said substrate comprising said transfer adhesive such<br>
that said transfer adhesive is disposed between said metal layer<br>
and said substrate to form an intermediate product; (e) passing<br>
said intermediate product through an electron beam curing<br>
apparatus to cure said transfer adhesive; (f) removing said<br>
transfer film from said intermediate product to provide a<br>

a still further embodiment, there is disclosed a method of<br>
metallizing a substrate wherein the cured breakaway layer has a<br><br>
cured elongation at break when tested in tension of less than<br>
about 20%.<br>
In other embodiments the structure is either totally or<br>
selectively metallized. The invention provides for structures<br>
having precise or sharp metallized edges, e.g., a metallized edge<br>
varies from a line drawn along the edge and mid-way through the<br>
variations from the line by less than or equal to about ± 0.010<br>
inches.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In describing preferred embodiments of the subject matter<br>
illustrated and to be described with respect to the drawings,<br>
specific terminology will be resorted to for the sake of clarity.<br>
However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the<br>
specific terms so selected and it is to be understood that each<br>
specific term includes all technical equivalents which operate in<br>
a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.<br><br>
In this regard, the term "film" or "carrier" shall broadly<br>
be construed as a thin and flexible sheet. The films utilized<br>
must have qualities such that a desired breakaway coating or<br>
layer of the invention adheres to the film, but that the affinity<br>
of the coating for the film is less than that of the breakaway<br>
coating's affinity for metal deposited on the breakaway coating.<br>
Suitable materials for the film or carrier include acetate;<br>
cellophane; polypropylene; polyethylene; polyester; polystyrene;<br>
holographic or diffraction films; clear, dyed, filled or coated<br>
films; mat finished films; metallized, full or patterned films;<br>
microwave and susceptor film; and treated film such as corona or<br>
chemically treated film. Mixtures of polymers having film-<br>
forming properties can also be used. Other than the suitable<br>
adhesion and release qualities as just described, the carrier<br>
film properties are not critical to the final construction or<br>
structure since the carrier film will not be an integral part<br>
thereof.<br>
Useful film typically has a thickness of about 0.18 mil to<br>
about 4.0 mil; for example, from about 0.25 mil to about 2.5 mil;<br>
alternatively, about 0.5 mil to about 1.5 mil. If desired, the<br>
film may be dyed or colored with suitable materials. The film<br>
may also be embossed or patterned to produce a further surface<br>
effect on the final product.<br>
As used herein, the term "coating" or "breakaway coating" is<br>
defined as at least one layer that is between the (carrier) film<br>
and a metal layer. The breakaway coating functions as an<br>
adhesive layer in that, in addition to other properties and<br>
characteristics described herein, including acting as a<br>
protective layer and as a printable layer, it adheres to the<br>
metal layer and, at least temporarily, to the carrier film layer.<br>
As a consequence of the process of the invention used to form the<br>
metallized structure, the metal present in the metal layer can be<br>
in the form of contiguous metal-containing areas or areas<br>
separated by non-metallized areas; in each instance, the<br>
breakaway coating is present only on the metallized portions of<br>
the metal-containing layer.  Furthermore, it will be appreciated<br><br>
that the breakaway coating layer may be formed of either a single<br>
layer of material or of multiple layers of material. Such<br>
multiple layers may be of the same composition or may vary in<br>
composition from each other. In an alternative embodiment, the<br>
coating layer comprises at least two layers. Application of a<br>
second, and subsequent, layer can be employed to cover pinholes,<br>
or localized areas where coverage of the initial layer is<br>
considered to be inadequate. The composition of the breakaway<br>
coating layer used in the present invention generally comprises<br>
acrylates; urethane acrylates; epoxy acrylates; polyester<br>
acrylates; acrylate acrylics and other oligomers and polymers<br>
having suitable properties as further defined herein. For<br>
purposes of the present invention, the terms oligomer and polymer<br>
have their standard or accepted meanings in the art. For<br>
example, an oligomer is understood to be a polymer molecule<br>
comprising only a few monomer units, e.g., dimer, trimer,<br>
tetramer, etc., but can include as many as ten, twenty or more<br>
units since a precise upper limit is not fixed.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the breakaway coating<br>
must release from the carrier film and adhere to the metal<br>
present in the metal-containing layer in those areas in which the<br>
metal of the metal-containing layer is adhered via the transfer<br>
adhesive to the final product substrate. Release from the<br>
carrier film can be measured using, for example, an Instron®<br>
tester using a 6 inch long by 1 inch wide test strip of the<br>
carrier film to which a layer of the breakaway coating has been<br>
applied. Å piece of #600, 3M Scotch Brand tape is tightly<br>
adhered to the coating layer and a free end of the tape is held<br>
in one jaw of the tester while the coated film is held in the<br>
other jaw. As the jaws are separated at a rate of 1 ft./min.,<br>
the force required to pull the coating layer off of the film is<br>
measured. Typically, the breakaway coating will exhibit a<br>
maximum release strength of less than about 30 grams/inch;<br>
preferably about 2.0 to about 25.0 grams/inch; more preferably<br>
about 3.0 to about 15.0 grams/inch; most preferably about 3.5 to<br><br>
about 10.0 grams/inch;  for example,  about 3.5 to about 8.0<br>
grams/inch.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
breakaway  coating exhibits  a low  level  of  elongation when<br>
stressed in tension.  Consequently, the breakaway coating can be<br>
characterized as relatively rigid, tending to fracture under<br>
stress rather than exhibiting significant elongation.  As will be<br>
further described in detail below, such fracture results in a<br>
desirable fine, precise or sharp, line of demarcation between the<br>
metallized and non-metallized areas due to the high adhesion of<br>
the metallized areas to the product substrate via the transfer<br>
adhesive.  The elongation characteristic of the breakaway coating<br>
can be determined using a cured sample of the breakaway coating<br>
and following ASTM Method D882 for a material having a thickness<br>
of less than about 1.0 mm (0.04 in.) and ASTM Method D638-02a for<br>
any thickness up to about 14 mm  (0.55 in.).   Suitable test<br>
conditions are as follows:  a test instrument such as an Instron<br>
tensile tester is used with the test sample mounted in the<br>
vertical direction; temperature, humidity, sample length, width<br>
and thickness should be selected and kept constant consistent<br>
with good laboratory test practices.  Similarly, sample extension<br>
rate should be kept constant according to the test method, e.g.,<br>
a suitable extension rate is about 0.1 to about 1 mm/min.; a<br>
convenient extension rate can be selected based on the properties<br>
of the particular breakaway composition.  Separation of the test<br>
grips should be about 100 mm and the sample size at least 50 mm<br>
longer than the grip separation used;  sample width can vary<br>
between about 5mm and about 25mm, but it should be at least 8<br>
times the sample thickness.  Sample preparation can conveniently<br>
be conducted using a smooth substrate that allows for good flow<br>
of the breakaway coating before it is fully cured,  but low<br>
adhesion so that the coating is not distorted or fractured prior<br>
to testing.   Suitable substrates or surfaces include smooth,<br>
polished mild steel and release paper such as silicone release<br>
paper.  After the breakaway sample is fully cured according to<br>
the conditions suitable for the chemical composition of the<br><br>
coating, test samples can be die cut or cut from the cured<br>
composition using, e.g., a sharp knife or scalpel and a straight<br>
edge, e.g., a metal rule.<br>
Suitable compositions for use as a breakaway coating in the<br>
present invention will have a cured elongation at break when<br>
tested in tension, as follows: (1) for use in selectively<br>
metallized structures, elongation at break that is typically<br>
about zero to less than about 20%; preferably about 0.5% to about<br>
15%; more preferably about 0.75% to about 10%; for example, about<br>
1% to about 8% or zero to about 8%. For purposes of the present<br>
invention, it should be understood that "zero" percent elongation<br>
includes values that are only slightly greater than zero and<br>
within experimental error of zero in view of the measuring<br>
capability of the test equipment used to measure this property.<br>
Consequently, if a sophisticated, high sensitivity instrument not<br>
typically used for general-purpose testing, would be capable of<br>
measuring an elongation value of about 0.4% to about 0.1% or<br>
lower, e.g., 0.01% or lower, such values are, for convenience,<br>
referred to herein as "zero." Alternatively, such materials are<br>
characterized as brittle, in contrast to elastomeric or plastic,<br>
wherein elongation at break in tension for elastomeric or plastic<br>
compositions can be, e.g., about 100%, 150%, 200% or greater.<br>
(2) Breakaway layer compositions useful in metallized structures<br>
where the metal present in the metal-containing layer is<br>
substantially totally transferred, elongation at break that is<br>
typically about 100% to less than about 300%; preferably about<br>
100% to about 200%; more preferably about 105% to about 175%; for<br>
example about 120%.<br>
Useful oligomer and polymer compositions for the breakaway<br>
coating or layer of the present invention comprise at least one<br>
component selected from the group consisting of urethane acrylate<br>
resin; polyurethanes, including aliphatic and aromatic<br>
polyurethanes and mixtures; polyesters; cellulose derivatives,<br>
including cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate and<br>
nitrocellulose; acrylics; and mixtures thereof. The composition<br>
is preferably a urethane acrylate resin.  The proportion of each<br><br>
component in, e.g., a urethane acrylate resin can be selected,<br>
with limited experimentation, in order to achieve usable as well<br>
as preferred elongation and release properties described above.<br>
For example, higher acrylate content would tend to have more<br>
adhesive characteristics and, if too high, could adhere<br>
unacceptably to the carrier film. Conversely, a higher level of<br>
urethane will more readily release from a polyester carrier film,<br>
but too high a urethane content may result in excessive<br>
elongation, depending on the character of the urethane selected<br>
and the type of metal transfer desired, i.e., selective or total.<br>
Given the property guidelines above, a broad range of oligomers<br>
and polymers can be selected for use in combination with the<br>
carrier film as well as the transfer adhesive layer and<br>
substrate, discussed hereinbelow.<br>
The breakaway film, coating or layer is ordinarily applied<br>
as a liquid or fluid. The typical composition of the present<br>
invention can be applied as a water or solvent borne composition;<br>
useful solvents include methyl ethyl ketone, esters such as ethyl<br>
acetate and isopropyl acetate. Aliphatic solvents such as hexane<br>
or heptane and aromatics such as benzene or toluene typically are<br>
not used. The breakaway coating undergoes curing, e.g., with or<br>
without the application of heat, in order to fully cure, for<br>
example, substantially fully cure, to a rigid or brittle<br>
material, as described above. The breakaway coating of the<br>
present invention is typically oven dried to effect cure; useful<br>
curing temperatures are about 100 °F to about 500 °F; preferably<br>
about 200 °F to about 400 °F; most preferably about 250 °F to<br>
about 350 °F. Useful commercial materials for purposes of the<br>
present invention include Grancoat® 571, 1012 and 8520 (Grant<br>
Industhes, Inc.) as well as Solucote® 1091, an aliphatic<br>
polyurethane, water borne dispersion (Soluol Chemical Co., Inc.).<br>
It may also be suitable to employ a urethane acrylate or other<br>
oligomer/reactive diluent resin composition that is susceptible<br>
to radiation curing, e.g., using electron beam (EB) radiation<br>
curing, provided that the above-described suitable elongation and<br>
carrier  release  properties  can  be  obtained.    Furthermore,<br><br>
depending on the properties desired and the esthetic<br>
characteristics of the resulting structure, there can be<br>
incorporated into the breakaway layer additional materials,<br>
including fillers, dyes and pigments.<br>
When the breakaway coating is applied to the underlying<br>
metal-containing metal layer, and when the final product<br>
structure is produced, including the substrate and transfer<br>
adhesive, the top surface of the breakaway layer of the present<br>
invention has a desirable surface finish as a consequence of<br>
using the materials and obtaining the properties as taught<br>
herein. Various surface finishes can be achieved, including a<br>
mirror finish, a matte finish, a hairline pattern finish, an<br>
embossed pattern finish, a hologram pattern finish and mixtures<br>
or combinations of these finishes.<br>
As used herein, the term "transfer adhesive," means a<br>
component, composition or material applied as a layer between the<br>
substrate and the metal-containing metal layer in order to secure<br>
or bond the substrate and metal layers to one another. Typical<br>
transfer adhesives comprise at least one component selected from<br>
the group consisting of urethane acrylate resin; epoxy acrylate<br>
resin; polyester acrylate resin; mono- di-, tri-, or tetra-<br>
hexacrylate resin; and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the<br>
transfer adhesive comprises a urethane acrylate resin; more<br>
preferably the transfer adhesive, including a urethane acrylate<br>
resin, is radiation curable, preferably using electron beam (EB)<br>
radiation. Electron beam radiation units useful in the present<br>
invention are readily available and typically consist of a<br>
transformer capable of stepping up line voltage to the required<br>
levels and an electron accelerator. The EB radiation initiates<br>
the formation of radicals or cations, sometimes enhanced by the<br>
use of initiators and other additives known in the art. The<br>
result is that the oligomers or polymers susceptible to radiation<br>
curing undergo cure. For purposes of the present invention the<br>
term "cure" is used with reference to oligomers, polymers,<br>
resins, adhesives, etc., useful in the present invention that can<br>
be thermally cured as well as those that can be cured by EB<br><br>
methods. Furthermore, for purposes of the present invention,<br>
"cure" means that such oligomers, polymers, and/or other<br>
materials referred to above or hereinafter, solidify, dry, set,<br>
harden, polymerize and/or crosslink, as is appropriate for the<br>
material employed. The term "full cure" or "fully cured" does<br>
not require, e.g., that the oligomer, polymer or resin, cure to<br>
the extent that no further curing reactions are possible, but<br>
merely to the point of practical utility; i.e., that the<br>
oligomer, polymer or resin has reached a condition where its<br>
physical properties are useful for the purposes intended herein.<br>
Alternatively, regarding materials that cure or set by drying,<br>
typically thermally assisted drying, the curing process removes a<br>
diluent or solvent present in the composition in order to effect<br>
the desired increased strength and/or brittleness. Regarding<br>
polymers capable of being cured by crosslinking, such polymers<br>
typically are considered to be fully cured when they achieve<br>
approximately 90% of the maximum modulus or tensile strength that<br>
they would achieve if the curing process was allowed to continue.<br>
Reaction time for EB curing can be extremely fast, e.g., in as<br>
little as about 0.1 seconds to about 10 seconds; although other<br>
processing variables may dictate the use of particular cure<br>
times. Furthermore, a transfer adhesive can further include at<br>
least one additive selected from the group consisting,of fillers,<br>
dyes and pigments. Such additives can find utility for modifying<br>
the processing or final properties of the adhesive composition<br>
and its performance in the layered structure.<br>
Useful EB curable resins include those made by Akzo Nobel<br>
Renins under the brand name Actilane® and including aromatic<br>
urethane acrylates, aliphatic urethane acrylates, epoxy<br>
acrylates, and polyester acrylates having various degrees of<br>
functionality, e.g., difunctional, trifunctional, etc. Radiation<br>
curable epoxy and urethane acrylates are also available from<br>
Sartomer Company, Inc. under various "SR" grade designations. Å useful publication reports the performance properties of a broad<br>
range of compositions from which suitable materials can be<br>
selected; see Urethane Acrylates: Expansion of Radiation Curable<br><br>
Epoxy Acrylate Coatings, H.C. Miller, presented at Radtech '89-<br>
Europe, Oct. 9-11, 1989. Compositions having elongation values<br>
ranging from about 5% to about 50% are illustrated. Also useful<br>
are EB curable adhesives manufactured by Sun Chemical Co.,<br>
including, for example, Sun Chemical® 7573, an aromatic urethane<br>
acrylate copolymer having a 50/50 weight ratio of urethane to<br>
acrylate (Sun Chemical Corporation) .<br>
The metal layer, typically in the form of a foil, is<br>
deposited by conventional methods such as vapor deposition or<br>
vacuum metallization. For purposes of the present invention, the<br>
term "metal layer" means the layer of the structure containing<br>
metal since it is not necessary that the metal be present<br>
throughout the metal layer. Consequently, this layer is more<br>
accurately defined as a "metal-containing" layer since metal may<br>
be present throughout the layer or only in selected portions<br>
depending on the desired appearance of the resulting structure.<br>
The manner in which total or selective portions of the<br>
metal-containing layer are metallized is described in detail<br>
below. The term "metal" is defined in the usual manner as any of<br>
various opaque, fusible, ductile and typically lustrous<br>
substances that are good conductors of electricity and heat.<br>
Typical metals form salts with non-metals, basic oxides with<br>
oxygen, and alloys with one another. For purposes of the present<br>
invention, the term metal also includes the various alloys<br>
thereof. Thus, a substance comprising two or more metals or of a<br>
metal and a non-metal intimately united, usually by being fused<br>
together and dissolved or dispersed in each other when molten,<br>
shall also be included in the definition of a metal. The metal<br>
layer of the present invention includes at least one metal. Some<br>
examples of metals that may be utilized in this invention are<br>
aluminum, silver, gold, platinum, zinc, copper, nickel, tin,<br>
silicon, and alloys and mixtures thereof. Deposition of the<br>
metal layer is accomplished by methods well-known in the art,<br>
including, e.g., vacuum deposition, sputtering, etc.<br>
The thickness of the metal layer can vary depending on the<br>
visual effect desired.  For example, thickness typically varies<br><br>
from about 20 angstroms (A) to about 1000Å alternatively, the<br>
thickness can be selected from the group consisting of about 30Å<br>
to about 800Å about 40A to about 600Å about 50Å to about 400Å<br>
about 55Å to about 300Å about 60A to about 200Å and about 25Å.<br>
to about 150Å. Useful metal coatings can also be obtained at<br>
thicknesses of about 100 Å to about 600 Å alternatively, about<br>
150 Å to about 500 Å for example, about 125 Å to about 450 Å.<br>
Furthermore, useful thicknesses of the metal present in the metal<br>
layer can be defined according to the optical density of the<br>
deposited metal. Typically, optical density is greater than<br>
about 1.5 to about 1.8; for example, about 2.0 or more, e.g., 3.0<br>
or more. As optical density of a metal layer increases, the<br>
light transmission through it decreases. For example, an<br>
industry standard relating to digital video or versatile discs,<br>
DVDs, typically made of polycarbonate coated with a metallic<br>
coating, known as DVD 10, typically has an optical density of<br>
between 2 and 3, equivalent to only 0.1 to 0.3% transmission. It<br>
is recognized that materials with an optical density greater than<br>
1.5 can be challenging to photocure, e.g., using UV curing. See,<br>
Published U.S. Application 2002/0066528, incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. Generally, the thickness of a metal<br>
layer can be determined, e.g., using an electron microscope or<br>
with surface resistivity measurements. The literature provides<br>
an estimate of the relationship between optical density of a<br>
metal film and its thickness, for example with regard to an<br>
aluminum film. Based on data for an aluminum layer exhibiting a<br>
surface resistance of 0.80 to 1.80 ohms per square and the<br>
relationship between film thickness and surface resistivity, the<br>
thickness of such a layer deposited at an optical density of 2 is<br>
estimated to range from 147 Å to 331 A. See E. Mount, Converting<br>
Magazine, Sept. 2002; and Section 2: "Electrical, Optical and<br>
Metal Thickness Relationships," Metallizing Technical Reference,<br>
3rd Ed., E.M. Mount III Editor, Assn. of Industrial Metallizers,<br>
Coaters and Laminators, 2001; each reference incorporated herein<br>
in its entirety. The present invention is not limited to<br>
exceptionally thin metal layer thicknesses since curing of the<br><br>
breakaway layer and the adhesive-containing layer is preferably<br>
accomplished by, e.g., drying, thermal and electron beam curing<br>
methods, as described below in detail. In contrast, in order to<br>
use UV curing to cure compositions useful in, e.g., the breakaway<br>
and/or adhesive-containing layer, a very thin layer of metal is<br>
required in order to permit a sufficient amount of UV radiation<br>
to penetrate the metal layer and effect cure. Consequently,<br>
while the present invention excludes the use of UV radiation<br>
curing and its inherent limitations, the invention can<br>
advantageously use EB curing as well as utilize appropriate metal<br>
and breakaway layer thicknesses required for a particular<br>
application.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the term "substrate"<br>
means any underlying layer that forms the final product,<br>
structure or construction comprising the several layers described<br>
above. Typically, this underlying layer will be the base layer<br>
of the finished product. However, this need not be the case if<br>
other arrangements are desired. The substrate can be produced in<br>
a form selected from the group consisting of board, sheet, film,<br>
woven fabric and non-woven fabric. Typical substrates used in<br>
this invention include, but are not limited to coated and<br>
uncoated papers and board made from natural pulp, synthetic pulp<br>
or mixtures thereof; natural or synthetic fibers, synthetic or<br>
plastic papers, for example those made from polypropylene or<br>
polyethylene, paper comprising polymeric fibers; resin or<br>
polymeric films or other structures, e.g., card stock, based on<br>
polymers such as polypropylene, polyester, polyethylene,<br>
polycarbonate, acrylic, polyimide, polyvinyl chloride,<br>
polystyrene, cellophane, polyethylene terephthalate, ethylene-<br>
vinyl alcoholate, polyacrylonitrile, cellulose acetate butyrate,<br>
nylon or polyamide, polyvinyl alcohol, ethylene-vinyl acetate,<br>
polyurethane, polymethyl methacrylate, polylactic acid and<br>
polycaprolactone; latex impregnated papers; non-woven fabric made<br>
from pulp synthetic resin, biodegradable plastic resin or the<br>
like; biodegradable plastic film made from aliphatic polyester<br>
resin, starch or the like; and woven fabric made of natural or<br><br>
synthetic fibers. Further typical substrates include the<br>
commercial products Kevlar®, Nomex®, Tedlar®, Teflon® and Tyvek®<br>
(products and trademarks of E.I. DuPont).<br>
Collectively, the film or carrier film, coating or breakaway<br>
coating, and metal layer (s) may be referred to as the transfer<br>
mechanism or transfer film.<br>
As used in this specification, the phrases "non-selective<br>
metallization," non-selectively metallized, " and the like,<br>
including use of the phrase "total transfer" in connection with<br>
the transfer of a metallized layer to a substrate, shall be<br>
construed to include those processes and the resulting structure,<br>
where a transfer mechanism, e.g., a transfer film, is utilized to<br>
transfer metal (and its associated coating) from a film to a<br>
substrate in a contiguous manner, such that the entire, or<br>
substantially the entire, metallic surface of the film transfers<br>
to the substrate. In such circumstances, it is to be understood<br>
that, while the entire metallic surface may be transferred, it is<br>
not necessary that the entire substrate be covered with the<br>
transferred metal layer and coating. For purposes of the present<br>
invention, the term "substantially" as applied to any criteria,<br>
such as a property, characteristic or variable, means to meet the<br>
stated criteria in such measure such that one skilled in the art<br>
would understand that the benefit to be achieved or condition<br>
desired is met. Likewise, as used herein, the phrases "selective<br>
metallization", "selectively metallized, " and the like, shall be<br>
mean those processes where a transfer mechanism is utilized to<br>
transfer metal from a film to a substrate in a non-contiguous<br>
manner, such that less than the entire metallic surface of the<br>
carrier film transfers to the substrate. Frequently, in a<br>
selective transfer process, and the structure resulting<br>
therefrom, at least one metallized area is separated from at<br>
least one other metallized area by a non-metallized area.<br>
Alternatively, a substantially contiguous area of metal can be<br>
transferred to a substrate wherein the transferred metal<br>
represents a portion of the total metal area available on the<br>
carrier film.   In selective transfer,  after transfer of metal<br><br>
from the metal-containing layer, the carrier film can include a<br>
not insubstantial amount of metal that has not been transferred.<br>
In contrast, when total transfer occurs, typically all or<br>
substantially all, and often, all of the metal present on the<br>
carrier film is transferred. The amount of metal coverage on a<br>
given substrate shall have no bearing on whether the substrate is<br>
considered to be non-selectively metallized or selectively<br>
metallized. For example, an application where a 2-inch wide<br>
transfer mechanism transfers a 2-inch wide contiguous stripe on a<br>
substrate greater than 2-inches wide is non-selective<br>
metallization because the entire metal surface of the transfer<br>
mechanism is transferred. Typically, selective metallization<br>
refers to a process where images, text, designs, logos or the<br>
like are transferred from the transfer mechanism or carrier film<br>
to the substrate.<br>
Referring now to the figures, Fig. 1, in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, depicts a fully<br>
coated transfer film 10. The transfer film 10 comprises a<br>
carrier film 12 and a metal layer 16 with a breakaway coating 14<br>
positioned therebetween.<br>
The process of creating this transfer film 10 begins by<br>
providing the first element, the carrier film 12. As previously<br>
discussed, the film comprises a thin flexible sheet of material<br>
known in the art. An uncured breakaway coating 14 is applied to<br>
the film 12 using processes such as UV offset printing,<br>
conventional offset printing, gravure and flexo printing, offset<br>
gravure, silk screen printing, air knife, metering rod, and roll<br>
coating, according to methods generally known in the industry.<br>
While the coating is described as at least one layer or a single<br>
layer, it is to be understood that the coating 14 may be<br>
comprised of several layers, either of the same material or of<br>
different materials working together to form a single, or<br>
integrated, coating layer, such as a mixture, or multiple layers<br>
applied sequentially. The coating 14 is then cured. Curing of<br>
the coating is typically carried out according to methods known<br>
in the art, including oven drying and chemical crosslinking,<br><br>
using, e.g., infrared heating, high and low velocity heated air,<br>
etc. Alternatively, and where the coating is susceptible to<br>
radiation curing as a consequence of its chemical composition, it<br>
can be cured using an EB curing process as described earlier and<br>
using equipment and conditions known in the art for such<br>
processes. In a preferred embodiment, the breakaway coating has<br>
a cured elongation at break when tested in tension of less than<br>
about 20%.<br>
Metal 16 is deposited, preferably onto the cured coating 14,<br>
using known processes such as vacuum metallization or vapor<br>
deposition to a thickness suitable for the desired application.<br>
At this stage, the transfer film 10 is a relatively stable<br>
product, which may be rolled into large diameter rolls (not<br>
shown) for future use. If desired, the transfer film 10 can be<br>
created in one facility, and transferred to a second facility or<br>
second location within the same facility to continue with the<br>
remainder of the process of the present invention. In other<br>
words, the steps of the process of the present invention need not<br>
be carried out in a continuous manner as part of a single<br>
operation.<br>
In a second stage of this process, and referring to Fig. 2,<br>
a substrate 18 is coated with a transfer adhesive 20. This<br>
coating process may be done selectively, so as to create a<br>
decorative surface with one or more predetermined, e.g.,<br>
discontinuous areas, such as a pattern. The transfer adhesive 20<br>
may be applied to the substrate 18 utilizing the techniques<br>
previously listed with respect to the coating 14 , such as gravure<br>
and flexo printing.<br>
For use with porous substrates such as paper or board, the<br>
transfer adhesive may be aqueous. Such adhesives are well known<br>
in the art. For nonporous substrates such as various<br>
biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastics, the preferred<br>
transfer adhesive is a 100% solids composition (meaning that an<br>
inert diluent or solvent such as a volatile organic compound, is<br>
not used) and is radiation curable, e.g., EB curable. The 100%<br>
solids adhesive may also be utilized with porous substrates, for<br><br>
example, particularly when metallizing a substrate selectively.<br>
Typically, a higher viscosity adhesive is used in connection with<br>
porous substrates. In selective metallization, a 100% solids<br>
adhesive is preferred as the transition line between metallized<br>
areas and nonmetallized areas appears more distinct, precise or<br>
sharp than can be achieved with aqueous or diluent-containing<br>
adhesives.<br>
Following application of the transfer adhesive 20, the<br>
transfer film 10 is placed in contact with the substrate/transfer<br>
adhesive element, with the metal layer 16 of the transfer film 10<br>
adjacent the transfer adhesive 20 to form an intermediate product<br>
22 having a structure comprising<br>
substrate/adhesive/metal/coating/film, as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Consequently, the "transfer film" is secured to the substrate by<br>
means of the transfer adhesive, and, preferably with the<br>
application of pressure.<br>
The intermediate product 22 is then exposed to radiation<br>
curing, e.g., by being placed in or passed through an EB curing<br>
device, to rapidly cure the transfer adhesive 20. As noted<br>
previously, EB radiation is capable of very rapid cures at<br>
moderate temperatures/ typically, about 0.8 seconds to about 10<br>
seconds; preferably about 1 second to about 4.8 seconds; more<br>
preferably about 1.2 seconds to about 3.2 seconds. The film 12 is<br>
then removed from the intermediate product 22 to reveal the<br>
finished product 24, depicted in Fig. 3.<br>
It will be appreciated that in areas where the transfer<br>
adhesive 20 is applied, the metal 16 and coating 14 adhere to the<br>
substrate 18, and are removed from the film 12. In the void<br>
areas 23, the coating 14 and metal 16 remain adhered to the film<br>
12, and are either discarded therewith or reused in a subsequent<br>
process. In such a structure, the breakaway coating, metallized<br>
area and selectively applied adhesive are in substantial<br>
registration; i.e., aligned with one another so as to produce one<br>
or more sharp or precise edges. Alternatively, substantially the<br>
entire surface of the substrate 18 may be coated with the<br>
transfer adhesive 20 such that it will be metallized in its<br><br><br>
entirety, rather than selectively, if so desired.  If the entire<br>
surface is coated, there will be no void areas 23.<br>
Fig. 4 depicts a schematic view of a preferred process for<br>
selectively metallizing a substrate 18. In this preferred<br>
process, the transfer film 10 is provided on a transfer film roll<br>
11, with the coating 14 already cured and adhered to metal 16.<br>
The transfer film 10 is unrolled from the transfer film roll 11<br>
by a motor 32 in the direction indicated by arrow A.<br>
Concurrently, the substrate 18 is unrolled from a substrate<br>
roll 19 by a motor 32 in the direction indicted by arrow B. As<br>
the substrate 18 is unrolled, an electron beam curable transfer<br>
adhesive 20 is, e.g., selectively applied by an applicator 21, to<br>
form areas of curable transfer adhesive interposed with void<br>
areas 23.<br>
The transfer film 10 and the substrate 18 with selectively<br>
applied transfer adhesive 20 may pass through a series of change<br>
of direction pull'eys or rollers 26, until they are brought<br>
together in a pressure chamber or applicator 28. The pressure<br>
chamber preferably applies a sufficient force to place the<br>
transfer film 10 and the substrate 18 with selectively applied<br>
transfer adhesive 20 into a position adjacent to, and in contact<br>
with, each other, to form an intermediate product 22.<br>
The intermediate product 22 is then exposed to EB radiation,<br>
e.g., by passing through an electron beam curing apparatus 30 to<br>
cure the transfer adhesive 20. Typically, following the electron<br>
beam curing apparatus 30, there may also be a mechanism to<br>
disengage the film 12 from the remainder of the intermediate<br>
product 22. In areas where transfer adhesive 20 has been applied<br>
and cured, the film 12 is removed without the coating 14 adhering<br>
to it. In the void areas 23, the film 12 is removed with the<br>
coating 14 and the metal layer 12 still adhered. Thus, the<br>
substrate 18 is selectively metallized. The substrate may then<br>
be rolled into a finished product roll (not shown) or cut into<br>
sheets (not shown) as desired.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the transfer adhesive 20 may<br>
be applied directly to the metal layer 16 of the transfer film 10<br><br><br>
by the applicator 21 in order to form the intermediate product<br>
22.<br>
The coatings and adhesives utilized in preferred and<br>
alternative embodiments of this invention include substantially<br>
100% active liquids (i.e., solvent or diluent is substantially<br>
absent); such materials are typically referred to as 100% solids<br>
since, after curing, the amount of solid material is<br>
substantially the same as the amount of liquid material at the<br>
start. Preferably the transfer adhesive is EB curable and,<br>
alternatively, the breakaway coating can also be EB curable. Å <br>
radiation curing process such as EB curing has the advantages of,<br>
e.g., speed and the avoidance of volatile materials.<br>
Specifically with regard to EB curable adhesives, the lack<br>
of out-gassing during and following curing permits the use of<br>
substrates which otherwise would be unavailable or more difficult<br>
to process using non-EB curable adhesives. For example,<br>
substrates used with non-EB curable adhesives are preferably<br>
porous in order to permit out-gassing of solvent (s) and/or<br>
diluent(s). With EB curable adhesives, nonporous substrates,<br>
such as plastics, may be utilized.<br>
With regard to coatings, the lack of out-gassing when EB is<br>
used can reduce pitting of the coating upon curing. Such pitting<br>
is undesirable as it creates small imperfections across the<br>
surface and within the coating, potentially affecting the<br>
smoothness, brightness and scuff resistance of the finished<br>
product, among other characteristics. Furthermore, an<br>
imperfection in an internal region of the coating may make it<br>
susceptible to fracture in a place other than the one intended<br>
when film is removed, thereby reducing the accuracy of the edges<br>
in the metallized areas, particularly in a selectively metallized<br>
structure.<br>
Another advantage of EB curable adhesives over non-EB<br>
curable adhesives is that non-EB curable adhesives typically must<br>
be heated to be cured. Thermal curing typically requires<br>
temperatures in the range of about 100 °F to about 500 °F;<br>
alternatively, about 250 °F to about 350 °F.   In contrast, EB<br><br>
curable adhesives may be cured at ambient temperature, typically<br>
about 60 °F to about 90 °F; alternatively, about 65 °F to about<br>
80 °F, without the need to introduce a heat source. Because EB<br>
curable adhesives do not require elevated temperatures to cure,<br>
substrates that are susceptible damage due to heat, such as by<br>
softening or even melting, may be utilized in the present process<br>
where they may not have been suitable for use in processes<br>
requiring elevated temperatures, e.g., the use of thin gauge<br>
plastics, such as polyvinylchloride (PVC) . The use of EB curing<br>
also provides the opportunity for other cost savings, e.g.,<br>
relating to faster and more uniform curing, lower coating<br>
weights, etc.<br>
Although EB curing may begin at ambient temperature, it is<br>
understood that a moderate heat build-up may occur due to the<br>
chemical reactions associated with curing and the energy input<br>
associated with the EB equipment. This heat build-up is<br>
typically on the order of a few degrees Fahrenheit, but may reach<br>
ten or more degrees depending on the thickness of the adhesive<br>
layer, the surface area being cured and the composition and<br>
thickness of the overall layered structure. It is also to be<br>
understood that the level of EB energy required for EB curing of<br>
a particular adhesive composition may vary. Useful levels of<br>
radiation doses are typically about 1 to about 6 megarads;<br>
alternatively, about 3 to about 6 megarads may be utilized. The<br>
dosing level typically depends on, and it is known how to adjust<br>
for, the particular adhesive being utilized, as well as its<br>
thickness and the surface area being covered, and the film and<br>
metal deposition thicknesses.<br>
Furthermore, it may be possible to apply EB curable coatings<br>
and adhesives in thinner layers. In the present invention, the<br>
thickness of a breakaway coating layer is typically about<br>
0.5 microns to about 10 microns; preferably about 1.0 microns to<br>
about 7 microns. Similarly, the thickness of the transfer<br>
adhesive is typically about 2 microns to about 20 microns;<br>
preferably about 4 microns to about 14 microns. Although<br>
additional materials or layers are placed above the at least one<br><br>
adhesive layer in the finished product, its thin, uniform<br>
cross-section contributes to the relatively smooth and/or desired<br>
surface finish of the final product; e.g., where the surface<br>
intentionally includes ridges, -a holographic pattern, etc. It<br>
will be appreciated that in this regard, as well as with respect<br>
to other features of the invention, subsequently laid-down<br>
surfaces develop attributes based in part on the surfaces upon<br>
which they are applied. Thus, a thin, smooth adhesive layer<br>
surface will contribute to the metal layer surface also being<br>
smooth.<br>
The thinness of the coating and adhesive layers can also<br>
contribute to the ability of the finished product to flex. For<br>
example, while cracking can occur on a score line in a paper<br>
substrate metallized using non-EB curable adhesives, the use of<br>
EB curable adhesives and, optionally, coatings, can help to avoid<br>
such cracking Consequently, the finished product can be bent,<br>
folded, or otherwise manipulated with only negligible degradation<br>
in appearance, strength or other condition of the structure.<br>
Another advantage of the process and product of the present<br>
invention, including using EB curable adhesives and, optionally,<br>
EB curable coatings, is that the finished product surface is hard<br>
and scuff resistant. The level of hardness of the product on the<br>
Sward Hardness scale is typically about 25 to about 75;<br>
preferably, about 35 to about 65; for example, about 50.<br>
Alternatively, it is about 50 to about 105; for example, about<br>
100 on the Konig Hardness scale. Scuff resistances can be<br>
measured using various test methods. For example, products of<br>
the present invention tested for scuff resistance using the<br>
Sutherland Rub Tester typically give results of about 50 to about<br>
150 rubs face-to-face; for example about 100 rubs face-to-face<br>
using a 4 lb. weight. Alternatively, tests using the Taber<br>
Abraider Tester typically result in a weight loss of about 0.1%<br>
to about 2.0%, based on the total weight of the sample.<br>
The ability to apply thin layers also provides benefits<br>
relating to the application speed or operating speed of a<br>
production line.   In a typical process using non-EB curable<br><br>
adhesives and/or coatings utilizing substrates provided in rolls,<br>
application speeds of up to about 600 feet per minute may be<br>
realized. Because of the nature of the EB curable adhesives and<br>
coatings, application speeds of about 800 to about 1500 feet per<br>
minute may be achieved. Additionally, thinner layers can provide<br>
acceptable overall diameters for standard size rolls of<br>
intermediate and/or final products, e.g., nominally 72 inches, or<br>
the use of larger diameter rolled products on existing equipment<br>
with the concomitant advantage of fewer process interruptions.<br>
Where substrates are metallized selectively using<br>
conventional or prior art methods, rippling may occur in the roll<br>
following the selective metallization process. Such rippling can<br>
be caused by localized areas across the width . of the roll of<br>
greater diameter adjacent to non-built-up areas, which have not<br>
been metallized; thinner layers can mitigate such an effect.<br>
Similar advantages may be achieved when the intermediate or<br>
final products are stacked in sheets on a skid, rather than<br>
rolled. In conventional processes, the thicker metallized areas<br>
of the sheets can cause a stack to be non-uniform to the point of<br>
instability, or require that the number of stacked sheets be<br>
reduced. With sheets metallized in accordance with the present<br>
invention, the additional thickness of the metallized portions is<br>
sufficiently nominal compared to the non-metallized portions such<br>
that the stack can remain generally uniform and stable, up to and<br>
including, within commercial tolerances, heights utilized in the<br>
industry for sheets or substrates prior to metallization.<br>
The thinness and uniformity of the transfer adhesive layer,<br>
particularly the preferred EB curable transfer adhesive, and the<br>
use of a breakaway coating layer having the preferred properties<br>
expressed hereinabove, permit selective metallization with<br>
particularly straight, precise or sharp edges between metallized<br>
and adjoining non-metallized areas, two adjoining metallized<br>
areas with a non-metallized area between, or at the edges of a<br>
substantially totally metallized construction or wherein total<br>
transfer of metal has been carried out. In selective<br>
metallization using non-EB curable adhesives, and coatings that<br><br>
do not fracture to produce a fine line or precise edge, but,<br>
instead, elongate, the line or edge differentiating the<br>
metallized areas from the non-metallized areas is not as sharp,<br>
precise or distinct as in the present invention. For example,<br>
applying the methods of the present invention, the edges of<br>
adjoining selectively metallized areas can be produced wherein<br>
the distance, in inches, between the adjoining edges of such<br>
areas typically differs by less than or equal to about ±0.010;<br>
preferably less than or equal to about ±0.008; more preferably<br>
less than or equal to about ±0.006; even more preferably less<br>
than or equal to about ±0.004; most preferably less than or equal<br>
to about ±0.002; for example, less than or equal to +0.001. In a<br>
substantially totally metallized structure, or where total<br>
transfer of metal has taken place, these same values apply to the<br>
straightness, sharpness or preciseness of an edge of the<br>
metallized area. In other words, an edge produced using the<br>
methods of the present invention will vary from a.n unwavering<br>
line drawn along an edge and approximately mid-way through the<br>
variations by the amounts expressed above. For applications<br>
where high quality and precise or sharp, distinct lines or areas<br>
are of concern, EB curable adhesives and the breakaway coatings<br>
of the present invention are particularly advantageous. They are<br>
also advantageous in processes where selectively metallized areas<br>
are to be printed. In such instances, accurate registration of<br>
the printing with the metallized portions is essential. With<br>
distinct, precise or sharp lines between metallized and<br>
non-metallized areas, as well as metallized areas having sharply<br>
or precisely defined boundaries, as defined above, such<br>
registration can be more readily achieved. Additionally,<br>
registration of the metal-containing portions of the metal layer<br>
and the breakaway coating are also improved signif i cantly in the<br>
present invention. Various methods are suitable for: printing the<br>
surface of the metallized structure, including where printed<br>
matter is applied by a method selected from the group consisting<br>
of offset, rotogravure, flexographic, letterpress and silk<br>
screen.<br><br>
Furthermore with regard to printing, and. wherein an EB<br>
curable breakaway layer is used, the clarity and brightness of<br>
the underlying metal layer is less susceptible to degradation by<br>
the curing process and the thickness of the cured layer.<br>
Additionally, in the absence of solvents or diluents, there are<br>
fewer extraneous materials to interfere with the properties and<br>
uniformity of the breakaway layer or to introduce irregularities<br>
for the diffraction of light.<br>
Other properties of the structures produced by the methods<br>
of the present invention have been measured and are indicative of<br>
a preferred product. For example, where the surface of the<br>
metallized structure is to be printed or glued, such as in<br>
forming a container, the surface energy of a surface must be<br>
suitable for the surface tension of liquids such as adhesives and<br>
inks applied to the surface of the finished product; this is<br>
particularly so at the exposed surface of the breakaway coating.<br>
This characteristic is frequently referred to as the "dyne level"<br>
of the surface, although the term used in ASTM D 2578, a test<br>
method for measuring this characteristic, is "wetting tension."<br>
The terms are used to represent relative receptivity of a film<br>
surface to the addition of inks, coatings, and adhesives.<br>
Wetting tension is described as the maximum liquid surface<br>
tension that will spread, rather than bead up, on the film<br>
surface. It is a measurable property that estimates the surface<br>
energy of a film surface. ASTM D 2578 provides a method for<br>
determining wetting tension by applying different test solutions<br>
of increasing surface tension values until one is found that just<br>
spreads or wets the film surface; values are expressed in<br>
dynes/cm. The ASTM method is directed to polyethylene and<br>
polypropylene films, but the same testing approach can be applied<br>
to another film or coated film surface of interest. For example,<br>
FINAT FTM 15, an alternative, but similar testing approach is<br>
used for plastic films including polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
polyester and polyvinylchloride using test fluids suited to the<br>
material under test. (Test methods ASTM D 2 578 and FTM 15<br>
incorporated  herein  by  reference;  ASTM  International,  West<br><br>
Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, USÅ and FINAT, The Hague, The<br>
Netherlands) For purposes of the present invention, the dyne<br>
level is typically in the range of about 32 to about 58 dynes/ cm;<br>
preferably about 34 to about 58 dynes/cm; more, preferably about<br>
36 to about 58 dynes/cm; most preferably about 36 to about<br>
56 dynes/cm.<br>
Finished product made in accordance with the pres ent<br>
invention and tested in an Atlas Fadeometer test typically<br>
exhibits acceptable levels of discoloration after about 4 0 to<br>
about 60 hours; preferably, there is no discernible color change,<br>
by eye, after 48 hours of exposure. Similarly, finished prooVuct<br>
in accordance with the present invention tested in a<br>
Weatherometer instrument according to standard test methods<br>
appropriate for the use of the particular product, e.g., about 80<br>
to about 100 hours, exhibits less than about 10% loss in<br>
functionality of the relevant property. For example, properties<br>
that may be considered relevant depending on the application<br>
include gloss, adhesion, tensile strength, etc.<br>
Also among the advantages of the present invention is the<br>
adhesive bond strength achieved between the layers. The typical<br>
failure mode observed is between the metal layer and the<br>
underlying transfer adhesive layer; less commonly there can be<br>
adhesive bond failure between the transfer adhesive and the<br>
underlying substrate. Adhesive strength is measured using a h.and<br>
test and #600, 3M brand Scotch tape applied to the sample surface<br>
and pulled away at a rate of approximately 1 ft./min. Where the<br>
bond failure occurs between the metal and the transfer adhesive,<br>
the material pulled away comprises the metal and breakaway layers<br>
and, if used, a prime coat that would be applied between the<br>
metal and breakaway layers. If the less common bond failure<br>
occurs between the transfer adhesive and the substrate, the<br>
material pulled away would also include the weight of the<br>
transfer adhesive removed. Products of the present invention<br>
typically exhibit the loss of less than about 2 wt.% of material;<br>
preferably less than about 1 wt.%; more preferably less than<br>
about 0.5 wt.%;  for example,  no loss.   Such performance  is<br><br>
particularly important as the layers tend not to delaminate, even<br>
after repeated uses, including bending.<br>
The stability of the finished structure, particularly its<br>
ability to withstand delamination, and the thinness of the<br>
finished product is especially advantageous when the technology<br>
is used in the manufacture of credit cards. For purposes of the<br>
present invention, the term "credit card" is used in the generic<br>
sense and includes cards such as credit, debit, automatic teller<br>
machine (ATM), identification, driver's license, security pass<br>
cards, etc. Such cards are typically about 5.4 cm wide by about<br>
8.6 cm long. Credit cards are typically held to a thickness of<br>
about 30 mm or less to provide uniform operation in the various<br>
slide mechanisms or card swipe devices used commercially, e.g.,<br>
point-of-purchase devices, .ATM machines, etc. Conventional<br>
metallization processes can add unwanted thickness to the credit<br>
card, resulting in the need to use a thinner card-stock material<br>
in order not to exceed the 30 mm industry maximum. Utilizing the<br>
metallization method of the present invention, credit cards may<br>
be formed using thicker stock materials than previously<br>
achievable, thus adding to their strength and durability. In<br>
addition, the development of high levels of adhesion between the<br>
various layers of the overall structure as well as the ability to<br>
use a thicker card-stock or substrate can also help to avoid<br>
problems of curling due to the presence of layers having<br>
dissimilar properties, e.g., thermal expansion rates.<br>
Furthermore, the ability to produce a structure having high<br>
levels of adhesion between the various layers, allows the<br>
resulting product to be used in flexible packaging, where<br>
delamination can be a significant problem. For example, one<br>
potential use of a product in accordance with the present<br>
invention is for toothpaste tubes, or containers. Presently,<br>
toothpaste manufacturers market toothpaste in squeezable tubes<br>
that generally are not metallized even though the boxes in which<br>
they are packaged and sold are often metallized. The ability to<br>
metallized the tube and box in the same manner may provide a<br>
potential marketing advantage.<br><br>
The present invention is capable of producing the<br>
above-described structures having higher gloss, better scuff<br>
resistance and better adhesion that typical products of the prior<br>
art. Generally the products are more esthetically pleasing and<br>
display a preferred combination of properties compared to those<br>
of the prior art, even though such prior art products may have<br>
acceptable properties in one or another test.<br>
The products of the present invention can be used in a wide<br>
variety of applications. The structure can be used to<br>
manufacture credit cards, bankcards, phone cards, licenses; or to<br>
prepare articles of manufacture such as containers, wrapping<br>
materials, displays, and signs. Containers can be made for use<br>
with a wide variety of products, including foods, cosmetics,<br>
drugs, smoking products, toys, electronics, kitchen utensils,<br>
glassware, hardware, sporting goods, wearable items, and bottled<br>
goods.<br>
Example<br>
A metallized structure of the present invention, made<br>
according to a process, e.g., as illustrated in Fig. 2, is<br>
manufactured in the following manner. Å 0.5 mil clear polyester<br>
transfer film is coated on one side by a gravure applicator using<br>
a 180 quad engraved cylinder, with aromatic urethane acrylate<br>
copolymer having a 70/30 weight ratio of urethane to acrylate<br>
components (Grancoat® 571) to a thickness of 3 microns. The<br>
breakaway coating is oven dried at 250 °F in a gas fired, hot<br>
air, low velocity oven. The dried coating layer has an<br>
elongation at break when tested in tension of 0.7%. The coated<br>
film is metallized on the coated side in a conventional vacuum<br>
metallizer to an optical density of 2.0 on the coated side of the<br>
film. The coated, metallized film is transported to an<br>
Intraroto® brand laminator equipped with an Energy Sciences<br>
Incorporated EZ Cure® brand electron beam (EB) unit. The coated<br>
film is laminated on the coated metallized side to a 6 mil white<br>
polystyrene plastic substrate, both film and substrate being in<br>
web or roll form. An EB curable adhesive (Sun Chemical #7573) is<br>
applied in the laminator to one surface of the polystyrene<br><br>
substrate by means of a flexographic printing head using a 200<br>
analox roll (engraved cylinder) engraved to print 4 in. wide<br>
stripes separated by 2 in. wide adhesive-free stripes. Both the<br>
transfer coated polyester film and the polystyrene substrate are<br>
40 inches wide overall, resulting in an overall product having<br>
seven, 4 inch wide, coated strips and six, 2 inch wide, uncoated<br>
strips. The EB adhesive is applied to provide a 4 micron thick<br>
layer.<br>
The EB cure cycle is set at 125KV and 4.5 megarads. The<br>
lamination process is conducted at 400 feet per minute, effecting<br>
a cure time of 1.2 seconds. Within approximately 10 seconds<br>
following EB cure, the polyester film is peeled way from the<br>
composite, including the polystyrene substrate; the film comes<br>
off clean, leaving the urethane acrylate coating and metal firmly<br>
attached to only those 4 inch wide stripes to which the EB<br>
adhesive has been applied. The metallized areas of the polyester<br>
carrier film corresponding to the 2 inch wide stripes to which no<br>
EB adhesive is applied, remain attached- to the removed polyester<br>
film. In those areas where the metal layer is firmly attached to<br>
the substrate, the configuration of the layers is: urethane<br>
acrylate breakaway layer/ metal layer/ cured EB adhesive layer/<br>
polystyrene substrate. The bond strength between the various<br>
layers of the composite structure is capable of withstanding most<br>
methods of commercial fabrication in various end uses. The<br>
finished metal-striped product is re ady for use or further<br>
conversion or fabrication in various end-uses, such as boxes,<br>
displays, trading cards, etc.<br>
Any range of numbers recited in the specification,<br>
paragraphs hereinafter, or claims, describing various aspects of<br>
the invention, such as that representing a particular set of<br>
properties, units of measure, conditions, physical states or<br>
percentages, is intended literally to incorporate expressly<br>
herein by reference or otherwise, any number falling within such<br>
range, including any subset of numbers or ranges subsumed within<br>
any range so recited. Additionally, the term "about" when used<br>

amounts, contents, carbon numbers, properties such as elongation,<br>
hardness, surface tension, viscosity, particle size, surface<br>
area, solubility, etc., that are outside of the stated range or<br>

film including film layer and metal layer bonded together by a cured breakaway layer; (b)<br>
providing a substrate; (c) applying electron beam curable transfer adhesive to a portion of<br>
the substrate; (d) securing the transfer film to the substrate, where the transfer adhesive is<br>
between the metal layer and substrate, forming an intermediate product; (e) passing the<br>
intermediate product through an electron beam curing apparatus to cure the transfer<br>
adhesive; and (f) removing the transfer film. In the metallized product, the cured<br>
breakaway coating is bonded only to the method. The cured breakaway layer preferably<br>
has a cured elongation at break, in tension, of less than about 20%. Precise metallized<br>
edges are produced, e.g., edge variation of about ± 0.010 in., or better. The process can be<br>
utilized with total or selective metal transfer.<br></td>
