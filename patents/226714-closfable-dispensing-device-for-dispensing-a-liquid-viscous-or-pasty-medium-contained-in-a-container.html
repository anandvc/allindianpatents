				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device in particular a closeable dispensing device<br>
for dispensing a liquid, viscous or pasty medium contained in a container, having a<br>
first opening for dispensing the medium located in the container, having a second<br>
opening for ventilating and/or venting the container, and having a closure, device<br>
which can be actuated in order to produce and break a connection between the first<br>
opening and the container and between the second opening and the container.<br>
Such dispensing devices can be used, for example, on drinks bottles for children or<br>
cyclists.<br>
A dispensing device which is suitable for drinks bottles is described in DE 199 37 754<br>
Al. The dispensing device described in the aforementioned document is a device<br>
which can be positioned on a drinks bottle and comprises a part which, once<br>
positioned on the drinks bottle, is fixed and a nipple which can be moved relative to<br>
said part, or more precisely can be pushed into it and drawn out of it. The nipple<br>
has a channel running through it, via which the drinks bottle is connected to a<br>
drinking opening provided at the top end of the nipple. This channel is closed in the<br>
state in which the nipple has been pushed into the fixed part (pushed onto a<br>
stopper closing the channel) and is open in the drawn-out state. The said dispensing<br>
device also contains measures which are intended to ensure that the channel is<br>
completely closed in the closed position of the nipple, and that the nipple cannot<br>
leave the closed position of its own accord but, on the other hand, can be moved<br>
into and<br><br>
out of the closed position with only a small amount of<br>
force being applied. These measures are embodied by<br>
latching elements which are provided on the nipple and,<br>
in the closed position, latch into associated latching<br>
elements of the fixed part, the latching elements which<br>
are provided on the fixed part of the dispensing device<br>
being arranged on elastically moveable elements which<br>
are accessible from outside of the dispensing device.<br>
The fact that the dispensing device can be closed in a<br>
sealed manner, and cannot open of its own accord, is an<br>
important precondition in allowing the drinks bottle<br>
also to be used for carbonated beverages. In the case<br>
of dispensing devices which do not satisfy the<br>
abovementioned requirements, the positive pressure<br>
produced in the drinks bottle by the carbon dioxide can<br>
cause the dispensing device to open of its own accord,<br>
which may result in the beverage located in the drinks<br>
bottle running out, and in gases flowing out (a<br>
reduction in the carbon-dioxide content of the<br>
beverage) . It goes without saying that both of these<br>
occurrences are undesirable.<br>
The measures which have been taken in order to satisfy<br>
the abovementioned conditions in the case of the<br>
abovedescribed dispensing device known from<br>
DE 199 37 754 A1 do not optimally satisfy these<br>
conditions: it cannot reliably be ensured that the<br>
dispensing device does not open of its own accord and,<br>
furthermore, the dispensing device is more complicated<br>
to use (the operations of closing and, in particular,<br>
opening the dispensing device).<br>
DE 183301 C discloses a dispensing device which, as a<br>
closure device which can be actuated in order to<br>
produce and break a connection between the container<br>
and the opening for dispensing the medium contained in<br>
the container, is formed by a slide which can be<br>
displaced transversely to the connection between the<br><br>
opening and the container. Such a slide makes it possible, with relatively low outlay,<br>
to close the connection between the opening and the container in a sealed manner;<br>
the slide cannot under any circumstances be moved into the open position by a<br>
positive pressure or negative pressure prevailing in the container. However, when<br>
there is a positive pressure or a negative pressure prevailing in the container, it is<br>
necessary to apply a considerable amount of force in order to actuate the slide.<br>
The object of the present invention is thus to provide a dispensing device which, on<br>
the one hand, gives a particularly good sealing closure and, on the other hand, is<br>
straightforward to actuate even when there is positive pressure or negative pressure<br>
prevailing in the container.<br>
The dispensing device according to the invention is distinguished in that the closure<br>
device is designed such that, when actuated as is required in order to produce a<br>
connection between the first opening and the container, it first of all produces a<br>
connection between the second opening and the container and only then produces<br>
the connection between the first opening and the container.<br>
The use of such a dispensing device proves to be advantageous because even a<br>
closure device which is more difficult to move as a result of positive pressure or<br>
negative pressure prevailing in the container can be actuated by it with only a small<br>
amount of force being applied. This applies, in particular, once the closure device<br>
has produced a connection between the second opening and the container. A<br>
positive pressure or negative pressure prevailing in the container can then<br><br>
dissipate via the second opening, with the result that the closure device is subject<br>
to lower forces than would be the case without the pressure equalization.<br>
It is thus possible for even a closure device which gives a particularly good sealing<br>
closure, for example a slide of the type described in DE 103301 C, or some other<br>
closure device which is more difficult to open as a result of a positive pressure or<br>
negative pressure prevailing in the container to be actuated with only a small<br>
amount of force being applied.<br>
Furthermore, the pressure equalization when the first opening is not yet connected<br>
to the container also proves to be advantageous because, as a result, none of the<br>
medium contained in the container can spray out of the dispensing device when the<br>
dispensing device is opened: nothing can spray out of the first opening because,<br>
when the first opening is connected to the container, there is no positive pressure or<br>
negative pressure prevailing in the container on account of the preceding pressure<br>
equalization via the second opening; at most only a negligibly small amount, if<br>
anything at all, can spray out of the second opening because the second opening, in<br>
order to perform the task intended for it, i.e. to ensure ventilation or venting of the<br>
container, may be very small.<br>
The fact that the operations of ventilating and venting the container, on the one<br>
hand, and of dispensing medium contained in the container, on the other hand,<br>
takes place via different openings of the dispensing device also proves to be<br>
advantageous because this can prevent an individual who is opening the dispensing<br>
device using his/her mouth, or who positions the first opening in his/her mouth as<br>
the dispensing device is being opened, from being able to, or having to, breathe in<br>
gases which pass out of the second opening as the container is vented; in the case<br><br>
of carbonated beverages, these gases contain carbon dioxide, which can make one<br>
feel unwell if breathed in and, in particular when one is exhausted, may even result<br>
in a brief period of unconsciousness.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention can be gathered from the subclaims,<br>
the following description and the figures.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail hereinbelow by way of exemplary<br>
embodiments and with reference to the accompanying figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross section through a first dispensing device, which will be<br>
described hereinbelow, in a state in which neither the medium which is to<br>
be dispensed by the dispensing device nor gases can pass out,<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross section through the dispensing device shown in Figure 1, in<br>
a state in which gases, but not the medium which is to be dispensed by<br>
the dispensing device, can pass out,<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross section through the dispensing device shown in Figures 1<br>
and 2, in a state in which the medium which is to be dispensed by the<br>
dispensing device can be removed,<br>
Figure 4 shows a different sectional illustration of the dispensing device shown in<br>
Figure 1 (section along a section line IV-IV depicted in Figure 1), and<br>
Figure 5 shows a cross section through a second dispensing device, which will be<br>
described hereinbelow, in a state in which neither the<br><br>
medium which is to be dispensed by the<br>
dispensing device nor gases can pass out.<br>
The dispensing devices which will be described<br>
hereinbelow are designed for use on a drinks bottle; a<br>
liquid (a beverage) contained in the drinks bottle can<br>
be poured out or drunk via said dispensing devices.<br>
It should be pointed out at this juncture, however,<br>
that the dispensing devices, which will be described<br>
hereinbelow, are not restricted to such a use. It is<br>
also possible for the dispensing devices - if<br>
appropriate following corresponding adaptation to the<br>
given conditions - to be used for containers other than<br>
a drinks bottle, and for them to dispense different<br>
liquid, viscous or pasty media, for example<br>
medicaments, soaps, oils, perfumes, detergents, etc.<br>
In the example in question, the dispensing devices<br>
described are screwed onto the neck 1 of a bottle. It<br>
is not absolutely necessary, however, for the<br>
dispensing devices to be fastened on the neck 1 by<br>
being screwed onto the same. It is also possible for<br>
fastening to take place in any other desired manner,<br>
for example by plugging on, plugging in, screwing in,<br>
adhesive bonding, etc.<br>
The first dispensing device, which is shown in<br>
Figures 1 to 4, comprises a spout part 2 which is fixed<br>
(in the state in which the dispensing device has been<br>
fastened on the neck 1 of the bottle), a slide 3, which<br>
is plugged through the spout part 2 and can be moved<br>
relative to the spout part 2, and a cap 4 positioned at<br>
one end of the slide 3.<br>
The spout part 2 comprises a fastening portion 21, for<br>
fastening the spout part 2 on the neck 1, and a spout<br>
22 which, in the example in question, serves for<br>
dispensing the liquid contained in the bottle. The<br><br>
shape and the size of the spout 22 are selected such<br>
that an individual can insert the spout into his/her<br>
mouth and drink therefrom; in the example in question,<br>
the spout 22 is of frustoconical design. It should be<br>
pointed out at this juncture that it is also possible<br>
for the spout 22 to be of any other desired shape; the<br>
size and the shape of the spout are preferably made<br>
dependent on the intended use of the dispensing device.<br>
In the open state, which is shown in Figure 3, the<br>
dispensing device has a channel, comprising three<br>
channel parts 23, 24 and 31, running through it, the<br>
channel connecting the interior of the bottle to an<br>
outlet opening 25 provided at the top end of the spout<br>
22; via this channel, with the dispensing device in the<br>
open state shown in Figure 3, the liquid contained in<br>
the bottle passes to the outlet opening 25.<br>
Of the three channel parts 23, 24 and 31<br>
the channel part 23 is a channel part which is<br>
provided in the spout part 2 (in the spout 22 of<br>
the same) and extends to the outlet opening 25<br>
from the top side of an opening which accommodates<br>
the slide 3,<br>
the channel part 24 is a channel part which is<br>
likewise provided in the spout part 2 and extends<br>
to the neck 1 from the underside of the opening<br>
which accommodates the slide 3, and<br>
the channel part 31 is a constituent part of the<br>
slide 3.<br>
The portion 26 of the spout part 22, said portion<br>
having the channel part 24 running through it, has the<br>
special feature that it is thin enough for it to be<br>
pressed elastically upwards against the slide 3 by the<br><br>
positive pressure which is produced in the bottle<br>
during normal usage.<br>
The slide 3 serves as a closure device. It allows the<br>
dispensing device to be moved from the closed state<br>
into the open state and vice versa.<br>
The slide 3 is an elongate element with an oval cross<br>
section and is plugged into an opening of the spout<br>
part 2 running above the neck 1, transversely to the<br>
latter, and it can be displaced in the longitudinal<br>
direction relative to the spout part 2. It should be<br>
pointed out at this juncture that the slide 3 and the<br>
opening in the spout part 2 which is assigned to it<br>
need not have an oval cross section. It is also<br>
possible to use any other desired cross sections. The<br>
important factors, however, are that the cross sections<br>
of the slide 3 and associated opening coincide, that<br>
the outer dimensions of the slide 3 correspond as<br>
precisely as possible to the inner dimensions of the<br>
opening, and that the slide 3 is guided in a<br>
rotationally fixed manner in the opening.<br>
By virtue of the slide 3 being displaced, the channel<br>
part 31 contained therein is also displaced. In that<br>
position of the slide 3 which is shown in Figure 3, the<br>
channel parts 23, 24 and 31 are aligned with one<br>
another. This gives rise to a continuous channel from<br>
the interior of the bottle to the outlet opening 25;<br>
the dispensing device is open, and liquid can be be<br>
[sic] removed from the bottle via the outlet opening<br>
25.<br>
In the state shown in Figure 2, in which the slide 3<br>
has been displaced a little way to the left, the<br>
channel part 24 and the channel part 31 no longer<br>
overlap, as a result of which there is no longer a<br>
continuous channel from the interior of the bottle to<br>
the outlet opening 25 and, consequently, it is no<br><br>
longer possible for liquid to pass from the bottle to<br>
the outlet opening 25.<br>
In the state which is shown in Figure 1, the slide 3<br>
has been displaced further to the left, with the result<br>
that there is likewise no continuous channel between<br>
the interior of the bottle and the outlet opening 25<br>
and, consequently, it is likewise not possible for<br>
liquid to pass from the bottle to the outlet opening<br>
25.<br>
In addition to the channel part 31, the slide 3 also<br>
contains a further channel 32. This channel 32, which<br>
will be referred to hereinbelow as a<br>
pressure-equalizing channel, begins on the right<br>
alongside the channel part 31 on the underside of the<br>
slide 3, extends a little way upwards from there, then<br>
bends off to the right and, from there, runs in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the slide 3 as far as a<br>
pressure-equalizing opening 33 provided at the<br>
right-hand end of the slide 3. The precise course taken<br>
by the pressure-equalizing channel 32 is of secondary<br>
importance. The important factor, in particular, is<br>
that, during the movement of the slide 3 which has to<br>
be executed in order to move the dispensing device from<br>
the closed state, which is shown in Figure 1, into the<br>
open state, which is shown in Figure 3, a connection<br>
between the interior of the bottle and the<br>
pressure-equalizing opening 33 is produced via the<br>
pressure-equalizing channel 32 before the channel part<br>
31 reaches the channel part 23 and/or the channel part<br>
24. It would also be possible for the<br>
pressure-equalizing opening to be provided at some<br>
other location. However, it is preferably not located<br>
in the vicinity of the outlet opening 25.<br>
The pressure-equalizing channel 32 serves for venting<br>
the bottle before the dispensing device is opened. Such<br>
venting proves to be advantageous<br><br>
because, on account of the force to which the<br>
slide 3 is subjected by a positive pressure<br>
prevailing in the bottle being eliminated, said<br>
slide can be moved, from then on, with only a<br>
small amount of force being applied, and<br>
because it is thus possible to prevent the<br>
situation where, when the dispensing device is<br>
opened, liquid sprays out of the outlet opening 25<br>
on account of a positive pressure prevailing in<br>
the bottle.<br>
Furthermore, the fact that the venting, rather than<br>
taking place via the outlet opening 25, takes place via<br>
the pressure-equalizing opening 33, which is provided<br>
at a different location, has the advantage that there<br>
is no risk of an individual who is opening the<br>
dispensing device using his/her mouth, or who positions<br>
the first opening in his/her mouth as the dispensing<br>
device is being opened, being able to, or having to,<br>
breathe in the gases which pass out of the second<br>
opening as the container is vented. In particular when<br>
the bottle contains a carbonated beverage, the act of<br>
breathing in these gases is not unproblematic. This is<br>
because the gas which passes out in this case is carbon<br>
dioxide and, if the person wishing to drink from the<br>
bottle breathes this in, he/she could suffer from a<br>
depletion of oxygen and the associated side effects.<br>
It is also possible for ventilation, i.e. an<br>
equalization of a negative pressure prevailing in the<br>
bottle, to take place via the pressure-equalizing<br>
opening 33. A negative pressure may be produced in the<br>
bottle, for example, if the liquid located in the<br>
bottle cools when the dispensing device is closed<br>
and/or if the bottle is closed at low air pressure (for<br>
example on a mountain) and opened again at high air<br>
pressure (for example in the valley). Ventilation of<br><br>
the bottle also results in the slide being easier to<br>
move.<br>
The pressure-equalizing channel 32 is preferably very<br>
much narrower than the channel leading to the outlet<br>
opening 25. This prevents liquid from being able to<br>
spray out of the pressure-equalizing opening 33.<br>
In the closed state of the dispensing device, which is<br>
shown in Figure 1, neither the channel part 31 of the<br>
slide 3 nor the pressure-equalizing channel 32 of the<br>
slide overlap with the channel part 24. It is thus not<br>
possible either for liquid to pass out of the outlet<br>
opening 25 or for gas to escape via the<br>
pressure-equalizing opening 33. It is not possible<br>
either for any liquid or gas to pass out between the<br>
slide 3 and the spout part 2. The cross sections of the<br>
slide 3 and of the opening accommodating the latter are<br>
identical, with the result that there are no<br>
interspaces between the slide 3 and spout part 2 via<br>
which liquid or gas could escape. Sealing is also<br>
provided when a positive pressure forms within the<br>
bottle, be this as a result of a change in temperature,<br>
or as a result of a change in air pressure, or as a<br>
result of a carbonated drink, or as a result of some<br>
other circumstances.<br>
As a result of a positive pressure which may be<br>
established, the portion 26 of the spout part 2, said<br>
portion containing the channel part 24, is pressed<br>
elastically upwards against the slide 3, this<br>
preventing either liquid or gases from escaping from<br>
the bottle.<br>
The cap 4, which has already been mentioned in the<br>
introduction, is positioned at the right-hand end of<br>
the slide and in the closed state of the dispensing<br>
device, which is shown in Figure 1, strikes against the<br>
spout part 2. This cap 4 may be dispensed with if the<br><br>
end of the slide 3 on which, in the example in<br>
question, the cap 4 is positioned has a corresponding<br>
thickened portion which can be used as a stop.<br>
If one wishes to open the dispensing device, that end<br>
of the slide 3 which is illustrated on the left-hand<br>
side in the figures has to be forced into the spout<br>
part 2. If a positive pressure has formed in the<br>
bottle, this may be associated with a slightly<br>
increased amount of force having to be applied until<br>
the position shown in Figure 2 has been reached.<br>
In the state which is shown in Figure 2, the slide 3<br>
has been forced into the spout part 2 to the extent<br>
where the pressure-equalizing channel 32 ends up<br>
located above the channel part 31. In this state, a<br>
positive pressure or negative pressure present in the<br>
bottle can be dissipated via the channel part 24, the<br>
channel 32 and the pressure-equalizing opening 33. In<br>
this state, the channel part 31 has not yet reached the<br>
channel part 24, with the result that it is still not<br>
possible for any liquid to pass to the outlet opening.<br>
The dissipation of the positive pressure or negative<br>
pressure prevailing in the bottle allows the slide 3,<br>
from then on, to be pushed very easily into the spout<br>
part 2.<br>
The state which is shown in Figure 3 is finally<br>
achieved by continued pushing of the slide 3 into the<br>
spout part 2. In this state, the channel parts 23, 24<br>
and 31 end up located one above the other and thus form<br>
a continuous channel from the bottle to the outlet<br>
opening 25, as a result of which liquid can be removed<br>
from the bottle. At the same time, the channel 32 is no<br>
longer located above the channel part 24, as a result<br>
of which it is no longer possible for any gas to pass<br>
out or in via the pressure-equalizing opening 33. In<br>
the example in question, the pressure-equalizing<br><br>
channel 32 is already disconnected before a connection<br>
is produced between the interior of the bottle and the<br>
outlet opening 25. This is particularly advantageous<br>
because the situation where liquid passes out via the<br>
pressure-equalizing opening 33 as one is drinking from<br>
the bottle can thus be reliably ruled out. It would<br>
also be possible, however, to make provision for the<br>
pressure-equalizing channel 32 still to be wholly or<br>
partially open as the connection between the interior<br>
of the bottle and the outlet opening 25 begins to be<br>
produced, and only to be closed at a more or less later<br>
point in time. In particular if the pressure-equalizing<br>
channel 32 and/or the pressure-equalizing opening 33<br>
are/is very small, or to be more precise have/has such<br>
a small cross section, or are/is so small, that only a<br>
very negligibly small amount of liquid, if any at all,<br>
can pass out via the same, provision can nevertheless<br>
also be made, on the other hand, for the pressure-<br>
equalizing channel 33 likewise still to be wholly or<br>
partially open when there is a connection between the<br>
interior of the bottle and the outlet opening 25; it<br>
would then also be possible for pressure equalization<br>
to take place via the pressure-equalizing opening 33 as<br>
one is drinking, as a result of which the act of<br>
drinking would have to be broken off less frequently,<br>
if at all, in order for the positive pressure or<br>
negative pressure produced as one is drinking to be<br>
equalized.<br>
In order for the bottle to be closed again, the slide 3<br>
has to be pushed into the spout part 2, until it stops,<br>
from its end which is illustrated on the right-hand<br>
side in the figures. The state which is shown in<br>
Figure 1 is thus reached again.<br>
The dispensing device described also has two further<br>
special features.<br><br>
One of the special features is that the channel leading<br>
from the bottle to the outlet opening 25 begins at an<br>
eccentric location, as seen in the plan view of the<br>
dispensing device, and also outside the centre of the<br>
bottle neck. This makes it possible to achieve the<br>
situation where in the closed state of the dispensing<br>
device, which is shown in Figure 1, the slide 3 does<br>
not project laterally beyond the bottle neck 1. This<br>
would not be possible if the channel leading to the<br>
outlet opening 25, or more precisely the channel part<br>
24 thereof, and the bottle neck 1 were arranged<br>
coaxially.<br>
The second of the abovementioned special features is<br>
that the channel leading to the outlet opening 25,<br>
rerther than running straight upwards, slopes. This<br>
makes it possible to achieve the situation where the<br>
dispensing device, despite its asymmetrical<br>
construction, has a centre of gravity which is located<br>
in the middle. This proves to be advantageous because<br>
the dispensing device, by virtue of being oscillated,<br>
can thus be moved quickly into a position in which it<br>
can be gripped by a gripper and positioned on the<br>
bottle neck.<br>
The abovedescribed construction of the dispensing<br>
device means that, irrespective of the details of the<br>
practical realization, the dispensing device<br>
is liquid- and gas-tight in the closed state,<br>
cannot be opened by a positive pressure or a<br>
negative pressure prevailing in the container, and<br>
can nevertheless be closed straightforwardly under<br>
all circumstances, in particular even when there<br>
is a positive pressure or a negative pressure<br>
prevailing in the container.<br><br>
A further dispensing device, which likewise has these<br>
advantages and the advantages mentioned further above,<br>
is illustrated in Figure 5.<br>
The second dispensing device, which is shown in<br>
Figure 5, comprises a carrier part 5 which is fixed (in<br>
the state in which the dispensing device has been<br>
fastened on the neck 1), a spout part 6, which can be<br>
connected to the carrier part, a pin 7, which is<br>
fastened on the spout part 6, and a sealing disc 8<br>
retained by the pin 7.<br>
The carrier part 5 is in the form of a stepped hollow<br>
cylinder with a bottom part 51, which has a large<br>
diameter, and a top part 52, which has a smaller<br>
diameter. The bottom part 51 has an internal thread, by<br>
means of which the carrier part 5 can be screwed onto<br>
the neck 1 of the bottle. The top part 52 has an<br>
external thread, onto which the spout part 6 can be<br>
screwed. Provided at the approximate location where the<br>
bottom part 51 and the top part 52 come into contact<br>
with one another is a pressure-equalizing opening 53<br>
via which, as will be described in more detail at a<br>
later stage in the text, a positive pressure or<br>
negative pressure prevailing in the bottle may be<br>
dissipated.<br>
The spout part 6 comprises an essentially cup-like body<br>
61 with a border 62 which extends from the top end and<br>
runs outwards in the first instance and then downwards,<br>
essentially parallel to the body 61.<br>
The border 62 has an internal thread, which can be<br>
screwed onto the external thread of the top part 52 of<br>
the carrier part 5.<br>
The body 61 is open in the upward direction; its top<br>
end forms a spout 63 for dispensing the liquid<br>
contained in the bottle. In the example in question,<br><br>
the shape and the size of the spout 63 are selected<br>
such that an individual can insert the spout 63 into<br>
his/her mouth and drink therefrom. It is possible, in<br>
principle, for the spout 63 to be of any desired shape<br>
and of any desired size; the shape and the size of the<br>
spout 63 are preferably made dependent on the intended<br>
use of the dispensing device.<br>
The body 61 is closed in the downward direction by a<br>
base 64. The centre of the base 64 preferably contains<br>
an opening, through which the pin 7 can be plugged.<br>
The body 61 has, in the bottom region, a recess 65<br>
which encircles it over its entire circumference and is<br>
provided with through-passages 66.<br>
The sealing disc 7 [sic], in the example in question is<br>
a circular disc which, in the closed state of the<br>
dispensing device, is pressed against the top part 52<br>
of the carrier part 5 from beneath and closes the<br>
bottle in a liquid- and gas-tight manner. The centre of<br>
the sealing disc preferably contains an opening,<br>
through which the pin 7 can be plugged.<br>
The pin 7 has different diameters along its length. It<br>
has the largest diameter at its bottom end. There, it<br>
has a head with a diameter which is larger than the<br>
diameter of the opening provided in the sealing disc 8.<br>
Following this, it has a diameter which will be<br>
referred to hereinbelow as the medium diameter and<br>
corresponds approximately to the diameter of the<br>
opening provided in the sealing disc 8, or is somewhat<br>
smaller than this. In the assembled state of the<br>
dispensing device, the region of the central diameter<br>
of the pin 7 extends from the head of the pin 7 to the<br>
location at which the pin reaches the base 64 of the<br>
body 61; in the assembled state of the dispensing<br>
device, the end of that portion of the pin which has<br>
the medium diameter butts against the base 64 from<br><br>
beneath. Furthermore, the pin has another, smaller<br>
diameter, which will be referred to hereinbelow as the<br>
smallest diameter, this smallest diameter corresponding<br>
approximately to the diameter of the opening provided<br>
in the base 64 of the body 61.<br>
That part of the pin 7 which has the smallest diameter,<br>
i.e. the top part, has one or more slits running in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the pin 7 from above. The<br>
parts of the pin which are separated from one another<br>
by the at least one slit can be moved elastically and,<br>
at their free ends, have outwardly projecting latching<br>
hooks which, in the state in which the pin 7 has been<br>
plugged through the opening of the base 64 of the body<br>
61, engage behind the opening and thus prevent the pin<br>
7 from being drawn out of the opening provided in the<br>
base 64 of the body 61.<br>
The pin 7 fastens the sealing disc 8 on the body 61.<br>
For this purpose, the pin 7 is plugged through the<br>
sealing disc 8 from beneath and then - likewise from<br>
beneath - is plugged through the base 64 of the body<br>
61.<br>
The operations of opening and closing the dispensing<br>
device take place by virtue of the spout part 6 being<br>
rotated, to be more precise by virtue of the spout part<br>
6 being screwed onto the carrier part 5 to different<br>
extents. The spout part 6 thus moves upwards and<br>
downwards relative to the carrier part 5.<br>
The dispensing device is closed when the spout part 6<br>
has only be screwed a little way onto the carrier part<br>
5, and is open when the spout part 6 has been screwed a<br>
long way onto the carrier part 5.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the state in which the dispensing<br>
device is closed. In this case, the spout part 6 has<br>
been screwed upwards to such an extent that (via the<br><br>
pin 7) it draws the sealing disc 8 onto the step<br>
between the top part 51 and the bottom part 52 of the<br>
carrier part 5. In this state, neither liquid nor gas<br>
can escape from the region located beneath the sealing<br>
disc 8 into the region located above the sealing disc<br>
8; the region located beneath the sealing disc 8 is<br>
closed in a liquid- and gas-tight manner.<br>
If, starting from this state, the spout part 6 is<br>
screwed further onto the carrier part 5, then the spout<br>
part 6 moves downwards relative to the carrier part 5.<br>
As the spout part 6 moves, the pin 7 also moves<br>
downwards (the base 64 of the spout part 6 presses<br>
against the step which is present between that portion<br>
of the pin which has the smallest diameter and that<br>
portion of the pin which has the medium diameter).<br>
It is possible here for gas to flow out of the region<br>
located beneath the sealing disc 8 into the region<br>
located above the sealing disc 8 (when there is<br>
positive pressure prevailing in the bottle) or<br>
vice versa (when there is negative pressure prevailing<br>
in the bottle). The gas flows through the opening<br>
present in the sealing disc 8 (if the sealing disc 8<br>
maintains its position shown in Figure 5) and/or flows<br>
between the sealing disc 8 and the step which is<br>
present between the parts 51 and 52 of the carrier part<br>
5 (if the sealing disc likewise moves downwards). The<br>
region which is located above the sealing disc 8, and<br>
into which gas flows out of the region located beneath<br>
sealing disc 8 or out of which gas flows into the<br>
region located beneath the sealing disc 8, is connected<br>
to the surroundings of the dispensing device via the<br>
pressure-equalizing opening 53 which has already been<br>
mentioned above. It is thus possible for a positive<br>
pressure or negative pressure which is present in the<br>
bottle to be completely dissipated via the<br>
pressure-equalizing opening 53. During this pressure<br>
equalization, it is still not possible for any liquid<br><br>
to pass out of the spout. For this purpose, the spout<br>
part 6 has to be screwed further onto the carrier part<br>
5. It is also the case that, at most, only a negligibly<br>
small amount of liquid, if any at all, can pass<br>
outwards via the pressure-equalizing opening 53. The<br>
routes which the liquid would have to take are too<br>
narrow for this purpose.<br>
As the spout part 6 is screwed further onto the carrier<br>
part 5, the spout part 6 moves further downwards. In<br>
this case, finally, the base 64 of the spout part 6<br>
passes the step which is present between the bottom<br>
part 51 and the top part 52 of the carrier part 5. Once<br>
this has taken place, liquid can pass out of the<br>
interior of the bottle into the recess 65 and, from<br>
there, on to the spout 63 via the through-passages 66<br>
provided in the recess 65. The dispensing device is<br>
open from this point on.<br>
Before the base 64 of the spout part 6 has passed the<br>
step which is present between the bottom part 51 and<br>
the top part 52 of the carrier part 5, it is not<br>
possible for any liquid to be removed from the bottle<br>
because the base 64, which slides along the inside of<br>
the top part 52 of the carrier part 5, blocks the route<br>
of the liquid here to the recess 65.<br>
As the spout part 6 is screwed further onto the carrier<br>
part 5, the spout part 6 moves further downwards until,<br>
finally, it is completely open.<br>
The position which the spout part 6 has to assume in<br>
order for the dispensing device to be completely open<br>
is indicated by dashed lines in Figure 5.<br>
In order for the dispensing device to be closed again,<br>
the spout part 6 has to be screwed back again into the<br>
position shown in Figure 5. In this case, the<br><br>
operations described above take place in reverse<br>
sequence and in the opposite direction.<br>
The external thread on the top part 52 of the carrier<br>
part 5 and the internal thread on the border 62 of the<br>
spout part 6 preferably have a very large pitch, with<br>
the result that the spout part 6 can be moved from the<br>
closed position into the open position by a fraction of<br>
a revolution.<br>
A great advantage of the dispensing device described in<br>
relation to Figure 5 is that the spout part 6, which at<br>
the same time forms the closure device of the<br>
dispensing device which can be actuated in order to<br>
move the dispensing device from the open<br>
(liquid-dispensing) state into the closed state (in<br>
which no liquid is dispensed) and vice versa, has to be<br>
moved in the direction of the bottle in order to move<br>
the dispensing device into the open state. In contrast<br>
to many known dispensing devices, the situation where<br>
the dispensing device is moved into the open state by a<br>
positive pressure prevailing in the bottle is thus<br>
ruled out under all circumstances.<br>
A further great advantage of the dispensing device<br>
described in relation to Figure 5 is the presence of<br>
the pressure-equalizing opening 53. This makes it<br>
possible for the dispensing device to be moved into the<br>
open position with only a small amount of force being<br>
applied. The pressure-equalizing opening 53 can also<br>
prevent the situations where liquid sprays out of the<br>
spout 63 when the dispensing device is moved into the<br>
open position, and where the individual drinking from<br>
the bottle is able to, or has to, breathe in<br>
carbon dioxide or other harmful gases.<br>
In the case of the dispensing device shown in Figure 5,<br>
the pressure-equalizing opening 53 is not closed when<br>
the dispensing device is in the open state. This, as<br><br>
has been described above with reference to the<br>
first-described dispensing device, may be advantageous.<br>
On the other hand, however, it is also readily<br>
possible, in the case of the dispensing device shown in<br>
Figure 5, to ensure that the pressure-equalizing<br>
opening 53 is wholly or partially closed when liquid<br>
can be removed from the dispensing device. Only slight<br>
modifications to the dispensing device shown in<br>
Figure 5 are necessary for this purpose. One<br>
possibility here is for the spout part 6 not to have<br>
any recess 65 with through-passages 66 at the locations<br>
which are situated at the pressure-equalizing opening<br>
53 in the open state of the dispensing device. The<br>
pressure-equalizing opening 53 is then closed by the<br>
niche-free locations of the body 61 when the dispensing<br>
device is in the open state.<br>
The dispensing device shown in Figure 5 thus has<br>
essentially the same advantages as the dispensing<br>
device shown in Figures 1 to 4.<br>
A further advantage of the abovedescribed dispensing<br>
devices which has not yet been mentioned is that the<br>
pressure equalization has been realized very<br>
straightfowardly. In particular, the pressure<br>
equalization and the dispensing of the liquid contained<br>
in the bottle take place via one and the same opening<br>
of the bottle. It is thus possible for the dispensing<br>
devices described to be used for any desired<br>
conventional bottles and other containers.<br>
For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned<br>
that, both in the case of the dispensing devices<br>
described and in the case of other dispensing devices,<br>
the construction of the respective dispensing device<br>
makes it possible to define as desired the point in<br>
time at which the pressure equalization is to begin and<br>
at which the pressure equalization is to end.<br><br>
A wide variety of advantages can be achieved by the<br>
dispensing devices described. In particular, the latter<br>
are straightforward to use and cannot under any<br>
circumstances open of their own accord.<br>
It should be self-evident, and requires no further<br>
explanation, the [sic] the abovedescribed pressure<br>
equalization can also advantageously be used, and can<br>
be realized with low outlay, for any other desired<br>
dispensing devices.<br><br>
