FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to certain novel fatty acids and derivatives thereof such as salts, to new surfactant systems comprising one or more of these compounds, and to consumer products such as laundry products, personal care products, pharmaceutical compositions, industrial cleaners, and the like comprising said compounds or surfactant systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION ,<br>
Fatty acids and soaps have a long history tracing into antiquity. The art" was highly advanced at the turn of the last century (See, for example, "Modem Soaps, Candles and Glycerin", L.L. Lambom, Van Nostrand, New York, 1906). Weighty tomes such as "Industrial Oil and Fat Products", A. E. Bailey, Interscience, New York, 1951 and "Fatty Acids", Ed. Klare S. Markley, Parts 1-5, Interscience, N.Y., 1960-1968 provide a systematic entry-point to the art, "Fatty Acids", Ed. E, H. Pryde, American Oil Chemists' Society, 1979, discusses fatty acids including some mention of branched types. Structures, separations and synthesis of fatty acids, including some branched examples, are laid out by F.D. Gunstone in "An Introduction to the Chemistry and Biochemistry of Fatty Acids and their Glycerides", Chapman and Hall, London, 1958, Substantial contributions to methods of synthesis of branched fatty acids were made by James Cason; see, for example, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., Vol. 66, (1944), p,46. Certain branched mixed fatty acids with high levels of impurities were known in wartime Germany, and have several disadvantages, See Bailey cited supra at pages 504-506.<br>
Fatty acids, including branched types, can be isolated from naturally occurring materials such as vegetable, fnirnal, fish, bird or insect oils or bacteria and can be isolated from human skin lipids. Likewise they can be made from petrochemical starting-materials.<br>
Naturally occurring complex mixtures of esters which in principle can be hydrolyzcd to fatty acid mixtures for example include those disclosed by Juarez et al, Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Vol. 293, pp. 331-341 (1992); by Nicolaides et al in Biomedical Mass Spectrometry, Vol. 4,, pp. 337-47 (1977); and by Ratnayake et al in Lipids, Vol. 24, pp 630-637 (1989). See also Nicolaides el al., Lipids, Vol. 6., pp. 901-905 (1971). Though such disclosures typically identify numerous monomethyl or polymethyl branched fatty acid derivatives as being present in natural systems, useful amounts of individual compounds are typically not secured.<br>
Fatty acids and their derivatives, including certain branched types, have an enormous utility to man and have been used in applications ranging from laundry cleaning<br><br><br>
agents to anticonvulsive drugs, dermal lotions and cosmetics. See, for example, commonly assigned WO 94/12608 published June 9, 1994. Such derivatives can have limitations, for example off-odors; further, it has not always been recognized which structures (e.g., primary or secondary carboxyl) are of greatest utility. Some branched fatty acids, more particularly, have been shown to have unusual properties, such as low melting points relative to equal carbon number linear analogs. In view of the age and extent of the art, improvements are becoming more difficult to achieve and what at first may appear to be small advances may carry great weight.<br>
Commercially described branched fatty acids of varying availability include a few from Exxon, Shell, Heixkel, Sasol and others; see the technical publications oOhese suppliers. Many of such materials contain quaternary carbon atoms. Perhaps the most common branched fatty acid type useful as a surfactant but too costly and limited in availability for high-volume applications and moreover, lacking in formulation flexibility, is isostearic acid; there are also some short-chain types, for example 2-ethylhexanoic acid, â€¢but these are relatively unuseful as surface-active agents. In short, there is a severe limitation in flexibility to the formulator when this handful of currently commercial types of branched fatty acid or mixture is relied on.<br>
There is therefore an ongoing need for improvement in the field of branched fatty acid compositions. Accordingly, it is an object herein to provide such improvements, particularly novel fatty acids, soaps and derivatives, especially those capable of improving one or more of the following technological systems; surfactants and surfactant systems; cosurfactants; builders; antifoams; emollients and skin feel agents; particularly important is to accomplish improvements useful for the formulator of consumer products such as personal care products and laundry and cleaning products.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Highly preferred for the purpose of consumer cleaning products such as laundry detergents and personal care compositions of the invention, are the fatty acids and the salts identified hereinabove. The esters are not comparable in their utility for such products but<br><br>
may be useful as intermediates and in fabric conditioners and non-laundry applications also described herein.<br>
As used herein the term branched carboxylic acid includes not only the branched carboxylic acid but also any stereoisomers, lower alkyl esters (preferably C1-C3, more preferably methyl esters) and salts (preferably sodium, potassium, ammonium, substituted ammonium, aluminum, zinc, calcium and magnesium salts). The composition of matter may also include mixtures, see herein after, for example, mixtures of acid, esters and salts with different or identical carbon chains, The composition of matter herein can be used alone, in mixtures with each other in any proportion, or in mixtures with any known (conventional) materials such as those disclosed in the background.

The fabric softening compositions described hereinbefore can optionally, but preferably comprise less than about 40%, preferably from about 10% to about 35%, more preferably from about 12% to about 25%, and even more preferably from about 14% to about 20%, of the principal solvent, by weight of the composition. Said principal solvent is selected to minimize solvent odor impacj in the composition and to provide a low viscosity to the final composition.<br>
The suitability of any principal solvent for the formulation of the liquid, concentrated, preferably clear, fabric softener compositions herein with the requisite stability is surprisingly selective, Suitable solvents can be selected based upon their octanol/water partition coefficient (P). Octanol/water partition coefficient of a principal<br><br>
solvent is the ratio between its equilibrium concentration in octanol and in water. The partition coefficients of the principal solvent ingredients of this invention are conveniently given in the form of their logarithm to the base 10, logP.<br>
The logp of many ingredients has been reported; for example, the Pomona92 database, available from Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. (Daylight CIS), Irvine, California, contains many, along with citations to the original literature. However, the logP values are most conveniently calculated by the "CLOGP" program, also available from Daylight CIS, This program also lists experimental logP values when they are available in the Pomona92 database. The "calculated logP" (ClogP) is determined by the fragment approach of Hansch and Leo (cf., A, Leo, in Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 4, C. Hansch, P, G. Sammens, J. B, Taylor and C. A, Ramsden, Eds,, p. 295, Pergamon Press, 1990, incorporated herein by reference). The fragment approach is based on the chemical structure of each ingredient, and takes into account the numbers and types of atoms, the atom connectivity, and chemical bonding. These ClogP values, which are the most reliable and widely used estimates for this physicochemical property, are preferably used instead of the experimental logP values in the selection of the principal solvent ingredients which are useful in the present invention. Other methods that can be used to compute ClogP include, e.g., Crippen's fragmentation method as disclosed in J, Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci., 27, 21 (1987); Viswanadhan's fragmentation method as disclose in 1 Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci., 29, 163 (1989); and Broto's method as disclosed in Eur. J. Med. Chem, - Cliim. Theor., 19, 71 (l984).The principal solvents herein are selected from those having a ClogP of from about 0.15 to about 0.64, preferably from about 0.25 to about 0.62, and more preferably from about 0.40 to about 0.60, said principal solvent preferably being at least somewhat asymmetric, and preferably having a melting, or solidification, point that allows it to be liquid at, or near room temperature, Solvents that have a low molecular weight and are biodegradable are also desirable for some purposes, The more asymmetric solvents appear to be very desirable, whereas the highly symmetrical solvents such as 1,7-heptanediol, or M-bisChydroxymethyl) cyclohexane, which have a center of symmetry, appear to be unable to provide the essential clear compositions when used alone, even though their ClogP values fall in the preferred range.<br>
The most preferred principal solvents can be identified by the appearance of the softener vesicles, as observed via cryogenic electron microscopy of the compositions that have been diluted to the concentration used in the rinse, These dilute compositions appear to have dispersions of fabric softener that exhibit a more uniJarnellar appearance than conventional fabric softener compositions. The closer to uni-lamellar the appearance, the better the compositions seem to perform. These compositions provide<br><br>
surprisingly good fabric softening as compared to similar compositions prepared in the conventional way with the same fabric softener active. The compositions also inherently provide improved perfume deposition as compared to conventional fabric softening compositions, especially when the perfume is added to the compositions at, or near, room temperature.<br>
A comprehensive list of possible pnncipal solvents can be found in U.S. patent Nc 5,747,443, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The above fabric softeners cm also be combined with other fabric softeners, such as, those in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,861,870, Edwards and Diehl; 4,308,151, Cambre; 3,886,075, Bernardino; 4,233,164, Davis; 4,401,578, Verbmggen; 3,974,076, Wiersema and^Rieke; and 4,237,016, Rudkln, Clint, and Young, all of said patents being incorporated herein by reference. The additional softener actives herein are preferably those that are highly branched and/or unsaturated versions of the traditional softener actives, i.e., di-long chain alkyi nitrogen derivatives, normally cationic materials, such as dioleyldimethylammonium chloride and imidazolinium compounds as described hereinafter.

Detersive Enzymes - Enzymes are preferably included in the present detergent compositions for a variety of purposes, including removal of protein-based, carbohydrate-based, or triglyceride-based stains from substrates, for the prevention of refugee dye transfer in fabric laundering, and for fabric restoration. Recent enzyme disclosures in detergents useful herein include bleach/amylase/protease combinations (EP 755,999 A; EP 756,001 A; EP 756,000 A); chondriotinase ( EP 747,469 A); protease variants ( WO 96/28566 A; WO 96/28557 A; WO 96/28556 A; WO 96/25489 A); xylanase ( EP 709,452 A); keratinase (EP 747,470 A); lipase ( GB 2,297,979 A; WO 96/16153 A; WO 96/12004 A; EP 698,659 A; WO 96/16154 A); cellulose (GB 2,294,269 A; WO 96/27649 A; GB 2,303,147 A); thermitase (WO 96/28558 A). More generally, suitable enzymes include proteases, amylases, lipases, cellulases, peroxidases, xylanases, keratinases, chondriotmases; thermitases, cutinases and mixtures thereof of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Preferred selections are influenced by factors such as pH-activity and/or stability optima, thermostability, and stability to active detergents, builders and the like. In this respect bacterial or fungal enzymes are preferred, such as bacterial amylases and proteases, and fungal cellulases. Suitable enzymes are also described in US Patent Nos. 5,677,272, 5,679,630, 5,703,027, 5,703,034, 5,705,464, 5,707,950, 5,707,951, 5,710,115, 5,710,116, 5,710.118, 5,710,119 and 5,721,202.<br>
"Detersive enzyme", as used herein, means any enzyme having a cleaning, stain removing or otherwise beneficial effect in a laundry, hard surface cleaning or personal care detergent composition. Preferred detersive enzymes are hydrolases such as proteases, amylases and lipases. Preferred enrymes for laundry purposes include, but are not limited to, proteases, cellulases, lipases and peroxidases. Highly preferred are amylases and/or proteases, including both current commercially available types and improved types which, though more and more bleach compatible though successive improvements, have a remaining degree^of bleach deactivation susceptibility.<br>
Enzymes are normally incorporated into detergent or detergent additive compositions at levels sufficient to provide a "cleaning-effective amount". The term "cleaning effective amount" refers to any amount capable of producing a cleaning, stain removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or freshness improving effect on substrates such as fabrics, dishware and [he like. In practical terms for current<br><br>
commercial preparations, typical amounts are up to about 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the detergent composition. Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0,01%-l% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation. Protease enzymes are usually present in such commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide from 0.005 to 0.1 Alison units (AU) of activity per gram of composition. For certain detergents it may be desirable to increase the active enzyme content of the commercial preparation in order to minimize the total amount of non-catalytically active materials and thereby improve spotting/filming or other end-results. Higher active levels may also be desirable in highly concentrated detergent formulations.<br>
Suitable examples of proteases are the subtilisins which are obtained from particular strains of B. subtilis and B, licheniformis. One suitable protease is obtained from a strain of Bacillus, having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, developed and sold as ESPERASEÂ® by Novo Industries A/S of Denmark, hereinafter "Novo".

Biological Chem,, Vol. 260, No. 11, June 1985, pp. 6518-6521. Certain preferred embodiments of the present compositions can make use of amylases having improved stability in detergents, especially improved oxidative stability as measured against a reference-point of TERMAMYLÂ® in commercial use in 1993. These preferred amylases herein share the characteristic of being "stability-enhanced" amylases, characterized, at a minimum, by a measurable improvement in one or more of; oxidative stability, e.g., to hydrogen peroxide/tetraacetylethylenediamine in buffered solution at pH 9-10; thermal stability, e.g., at common wash temperatures such as about 60Â°C; or alkaline stability, e,g,, at ap H from about 8 to about 11, measured versus the above-identified reference-point amylase. Stability can be measured using any of the art-disclosed technical tests. See, for example, references disclosed in WO 9402597. Stability-enhanced amylases can be obtained from Novo or from Genencor International. One class of highly preferred amylases herein have the commonality of being derived using site-directed mutagenesis from one or more of the Bacillus amylases, especially the Bacillus Î±-amylases, regardless of whether one, two or multiple amylase strains are the immediate precursors. Oxidative stability-enhanced arnylases vs. the above-identified reference amylase are preferred for use, especially in bleaching, more preferably oxygen bleaching, as distinct from chlorine bleaching, detergent compositions herein. Such preferred amylases include (a) an amylase according to the hereinbefore incorporated WO 9402597, Novo, Feb, 3, 1994, as further illustrated by a mutant in which substitution is made, using alanine or threonine, preferably threonine, of the methionine residue located in position 197 of the B. licheniformis alpha-amylase, known as TERMAMYLÂ®, or the homologous position variation of a similar parent amylase, such as B, amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, or B. stearothermophilus; (b) stability-enhanced amylases as described. by Genencor International in a paper entitled "OxidatrVely Resistant alpha-Amylases" presented at the 207th American Chemical Society National Meeting, March 13-17 1994, by C. Mitchinson, Therein it was noted that bleaches in automatic dishwashing detergents inactivate alpha-amylases but that improved oxidalive stability amylases have been made by Genencor from B. licheniformis NCIBS061. Methionine (Met) was identified as the<br><br>
most likely residue to be modified. Met was substituted, one at a time, in positions 8, 15, 197, 256, 304, 366 and 438 leading to specific mutants, particularly important being M197L and M197T with the M197T variant being the most stable expressed variant. Stability was measured in CASCADEÂ® and SUNLIGHTÂ®; (c) particularly preferred amylases herein include amylase variants having additional modification in the immediate parent as described in WO 9510603 A and are available from the assignee, Novo, as DURAMYLÂ®. Other particularly preferred oxidative stability enhanced amylase include those described in WO 9418314 to Genencor International and WO 9402597 to Novo. Any other oxidative stability-enhanced amylase can be used, for example as derived by site-directed mutagenesis from known chimenc, hybrid or simple mutant parent forms of available amylases, Other preferred enzyme modifications are accessible. See WO 9509909 A to Novo.<br>
Other amylase enzymes include those described in WO 95/26397 and in co-pending application by Novo Nordisk PCT/DK96/00056.

Builders - Detergent builders are preferably included in the compositions herein, for example to assist in controlling mineral, especially Ca and/or Mg, hardness in wash water or to assist in the removal and/or suspension of particulate soils from surfaces and sometimes to provide alkalinity and/or buffering action. In solid formulations, builders sometimes serve as absorbents for surfactants. Alternately, certain compositions can be formulated with completely water-soluble builders, whether organic or inorganic, depending on the intended use.<br><br>
Suitable silicate builders include water-soluble and hydrous solid types and including those having chain-, layer-, or tbiee-dirnensional- structure as well as amorphous-solid silicates or other types, for example especially adapted for use in non-structured-liquid detergents. Preferred are alkali metal silicates, particularly those liquids and solids having a Si02:Na20 ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1, including solid hydrous<br>
2-ratio silicates marketed by PQ Corp, under the tradename BRITESILÂ®, e.g., BPJTESIL H20; and layered silicates, e.g., those described in U.S. 4,664,839, May 12, 1987, H, P. Rieck. NaSKS-6, sometimes abbreviated "SKS-6", is a crystalline layered aluminum-free 6-Na2Si05 morphology silicate marketed by Hoechst and is preferred<br>
especially in granular laundry compositions. See preparative methods in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043, Other layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSix02x+i-yH20 wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1,9<br>
to 4, preferably 2,'and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0, can also or alternately be used herein. Layered silicates from Hoechst also include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-U, as the a, p and y layer-silicate forms. Other silicates may also be useful, such as magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crisping agent in granules, as a stabilizing agent for bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Also suitable for use herein are synthesized crystalline ion exchange materials or hydrates thereof having chain structure and a composition represented by the following general formula in an anhydride form: xM20-ySi02.zM'0 wherein M is Na and/or K, M'<br>
is Ca anoVor Mg; y/x is 0.5 to 2.0 and z/x is 0,005 to 1.0 as taught in U.S. 5,427,711, Sakaguchi et al, June 27, 1995.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders, such as zeolites, are especially useful in granular detergents, but can also be incorporated in liquids, pastes or gels. Suitable for the present purposes are those having empirical formula; [Mz(A102)z(Si02)v]xH2O wherein z and v are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to v is in the range from 1.0 to 0.5, and x is an integer irorn 15 to 264. Aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous, naturally-occurring or synthetically derived. An aluminosilicate production method is in US. 3,985,669, Krummel, et al, October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are available as Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite X and, to whatever extent this differs from Zeolite P, the so-called Zeolite MAP, Natural types, including clinoptilolite, may be used. Zeolite A has the formula: Na12[(A102)12(Si02)12]-xH2Â° wherein x is from 20 to 30, especially 27. Dehydrated . zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used, Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of 0,1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Builder level can vary widely depending upon end use and physical form of the composition.   Built detergents typically comprise at least about 1% builder,   Liquid<br><br>
formulations typically comprise about 5% to about 50%, more typically 5% to 35% of builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically 15% to 50% builder by weight of the detergent composition. Lower or higher levels of builders are not excluded. For example, certain detergent additive or high-surfactant formulations can be unbuilt.<br>
Suitable builders herein can be selected from the group consisting of phosphates and polyphosphates, especially the sodium salts; carbonates, bicarboriates, sesquicarbonates and carbonate minerals other than sodium carbonate or sesquicarbonate; organic mono-, di-, tri-, and tetracarboxylates especially water-soluble nonsurfactant carboxylates in acid, sodium, potassium or alkanolammonium salt form, as well as oligomeric or water-soluble low molecular weight polymer carboxylates including aliphatic and aromatic types; and phytic acid. These may be complemented by borates, e.g., for pH-buffering purposes, or by sulfates, especially sodium sulfate and any other fillers or carriers which may be important to the engineering of stable surfactant and/or builder-containing detergent compositions.<br>
Builder mixtures, sometimes termed "builder systems" can be used and typically comprise two or more conventional builders, optionally complemented by chelants, pH-buffers or fillers, though these latter materials are generally accounted for separately when describing quantities of materials herein. In terms of relative quantities of surfactant and builder in the present detergents, preferred builder systems are typically formulated at a weight ratio of surfactant to builder of from about 60:1 to about 1:80. Certain preferred laundry detergents have said ratio in the range 0.90:1.0 to 4.0:1.0, more preferably from 0.95:1.0 to 3.0:1.0.<br>
P-containing detergent builders often preferred where permitted by legislation include, but are not limited to, the alkali rnetal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates exemplified by the uipolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, glassy polymeric meta-phosphales; and phosphonates.<br>
Suitable carbonate builders include alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15, 1973, although sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium sesquicarbonate, and other<br>
carbonate minerals such as trona or any convenient multiple salts of sodium carbonate and calcium carbonate such as those having the composition 2Na2CO3.CaC03 when<br>
anhydrous, and even calcium carbonates including calcite, aragonite and vaterite, especially forms having high surface areas relative to compact calcite may be useful, for example as seeds or for use in synthetic detergent bars.<br>
Suitable "organic detergent builders", as described herein for use with the ,alkylarylsulfonate surfactant system include polycarboxylate compounds, including<br><br><br>
water-soluble nonsurfactant dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates. More typically builder polycarboxylates have a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Carboxylate builders can be formulated in acid, partially neutral, neutral or overbased form. When in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred. Polycarboxylate builders include the ether polycarboxylates, such as oxydisuccinate, see Berg, U.S. 3,128,287, April 7, 1964, and Lamberti et al, U.S. 3,635,830, January 18, 1972; "TMS/TDS" builders of US. 4,663,071, Bush et al, May 5, 1987; and other ether carboxylates including cyclic and alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U,S, Patents 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.<br>
Other suitable organic detergent builders are the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether; 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid; carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid; the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid; as well as meUitic acid, succinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrates, e,g,, citric acid and soluble salts thereof are important carboxylate builders e.g., for heavy duty liquid detergents, due to availability from renewable resources and biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicates. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Where permitted, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, alkali metal phosphates such as sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-l-hydroxy-l,l-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates, e.g., those of U.S. 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137 can also be used and may have desirable antiscaling properties.<br>
Certain detersive surfactants or their short-chain homologues also have a builder action. For unambiguous formula accounting purposes, when they have surfactant capability, these materials are summed up as detersive surfactants. Preferred types for builder functionality are illustrated by: 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984, Bush, January 28, 1986. Succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof. Succinate<br>
builders also include: iaurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Lauryl-succinates are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published<br><br>
November 5, 1986, Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions as surfactant/builder materials alone or in combination with the aforementioned builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. 4,144,226, Crutchfield et al, March 13, 1979 and in U.S. 3,308,067, Diehl, March 7, 1967. See also Diehl, U.S. 3,723,322.<br>
Other types of inorganic builder materials which can be used have the formula (Mx)Ai Cay (C03)z wherein x and i are integers from 1 to 15, y is an integer from 1 to 10, z is an integer from 2 to 25, Mj are cations, at least one of which is a water-soluble, and the equation Î£i= 1-15(Xi multiplied by the valence of Mj) + 2y = 2z is satisfied such that the formula has a neutral or "balanced" charge. These builders are referred to herein as "Mineral Builders", examples of these builders, their use and preparation can be found in US Patent 5,707,959. Another suitable class of inorganic builders are the Magnesiosilicates, see W097/0179.<br>
Bleaching Agents - Preferred compositions of the present invention comprise, as part or all of the laundry or cleaning adjunct materials, a bleaching agent. Oxygen bleaching agents useful in the present invention can be any of the oxidizing agents known for laundry, hard surface cleaning, automatic dishwashing or denture cleaning purposes. Oxygen bleaches or mixtures thereof are preferred, though other oxidant bleaches, such as oxygen, an enzymatic hydrogen peroxide producing system, or hypohalites such as chlorine bleaches like hypochlorite, may also be used.<br>
Common oxygen bleaches of the peroxygen type include hydrogen peroxide, inorganic peroxohydrates, organic peroxohydrates and the organic peroxyacids, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic mono- or di- peroxyacids. These can be peroxycarboxylic acids, peroxyimidic acids, amidoperoxycarboxylic acids, or their salts including the calcium, magnesium, or mixed-cation salts. Peracids of various kinds can be used both in free fijrm and as precursors known as "bleach activators" or "bleach promoters" which, when combined with a source of hydrogen peroxide, perhydrolyze to release the corresponding peracid.<br>
Also useful herein as oxygen bleaches are the inorganic peroxides such as Na2O2, superoxides such as K02, organic hydroperoxides such as cumene<br>
hydroperoxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide, and the inorganic peroxoacids and their salts such as the peroxosulfuric acid salts, especially the potassium salts of peroxodisulfuric acid and, more preferably, of peroxomonosulfuric acid including the commercial triple-salt form sold as OXONE by DuPont and also any equivalent commercially available forms such as CUROX from Akzo or CAROAT from Degussa. Certain organic<br><br><br>
peroxides, such as dibenzoyl peroxide, may be useful, especially as additives rather than as primary oxygen bleach.<br>
Mixed oxygen bleach systems are generally useful, as are mixtures of any oxygen bleaches with the known bleach activators, organic catalysts, enzymatic catalysts and mixtures thereof; moreover such mixtures may further include brighteners, photobleaches and dye transfer inhibitors of types well-known in the art.<br>
Preferred oxygen bleaches, as noted, include the peroxohydrates, sometimes known as peroxyhydrates or peroxohydrates. These are organic or, more commonly, inorganic salts capable of releasing hydrogen peroxide readily, Peroxohydrates are the most common examples of "hydrogen peroxide source" materials and include the perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, and persilicates. Suitable peroxohydrates include sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate and equivalent commercial "percarbonate" bleaches, and any of the so-called sodium perborate hydrates, the "tetrahydrate" and "monohydrate" being preferred; .though sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate can be 'used. Many such peroxohydrates are available in processed forms with coatings, such as of silicate and/or borate and/or waxy materials and/or surfactants, or have particle geometries, such as compact spheres, which improve storage stability. By way of organic peroxohydrates, urea peroxyhydrate can also be useful herein.<br>
Percarbonate bleach includes, for example, dry particles having an average particle size in the range from about 500 micrometers to about 1,000 micrometers, not more than about 10% by weight of said particles being smaller than about 200 micrometers and not more than about 10% by weight of said particles being larger than about 1,250 micrometers. Percarbonates and perborates are widely available in commerce, for example from FMC, Solvay and Tokai Denka.<br>
Organic percarboxylic acids useful herein as the oxygen bleach, include magnesium monoperoxyphthalate hexahydrate, available from Interox, m-chloro perbenzoic acid and its salts, 4-nonylamino-4-oxoperoxybutyric acid and diperoxydodecanedioic acid and their salts. Such bleaches are disclosed in U.S. 4,483,781, U.S.. Pat, Appl. 740,446, Bums et al, filed June 3, 1985, EP-A 133,354, published February 20, 1985, and U.S. 4,412,934. Organic percarboxylic acids usable herein include those containing one, two or more peroxy groups, and can be aliphatic or aromatic, Highly preferred oxygen bleaches also include 6-nonylamino-6-oxoperoxycaproic acid (NAPAA) as described in U.S. 4,634,551.<br>
An extensive and exhaustive listing of useful oxygen bleaches, including inorganic peroxohydrates, organic peroxohydrates and the organic peroxyacids, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic mono- or di- peroxyacids, peroxycarboxylic acids, peroxyimidic acids, amidoperoxycarboxylic acids, or their salts including the<br><br><br>
calcium, magnesium, or mixed-cation salts, can be found in US Patents 5,622,646 and 5,686,014.<br>
Other useful peracids and bleach activators herein are in the family of<br>
imidoperacids and imido bleach activators.	These include<br>
phthaloylimidoperoxycaproic acid and related arylimido-substituted and acyloxynitrogen derivatives. For listings of such compounds, preparations and their incorporation into laundry compositions including both granules and liquids, See U.S. 5,487,818; U.S. 5,470,988, U.S. 5,466,825; U.S. 5,419,846; U.S. 5,415,796; U.S. 5,391,324; U.S. 5,328,634; U.S. 5,310,934; U.S. 5,279,757; U.S. 5,246,620; U.S. 5,245,075; U.S. 5,294,362; U.S. 5,423,998; U.S. 5,208,340; U.S, 5,132,431 and U.S. 5,087385.<br>
Useful diperoxyacids include, for example, 1,12-diperoxydodecanedioic acid (DPDA); 1,9-diperoxyazelaic acid; diperoxybrassilic acid; diperoxysebasic acid and diperoxyisophthalic acid; 2-decyldiperoxybutane-l,4-dioic acid; and 4,4'-sulphonylbisperoxybenzoic acid.<br>
More generally, the terms "hydrophilic" and "hydrophobic" used herein in connection with any of the oxygen bleaches, especially the peracids, and in connection with bleach activators, are in the first instance based on whether a given oxygen bleach effectively performs bleaching of fugitive dyes in solution thereby preventing fabric graying and discoloration and/or removes more hydrophilic stains such as tea, wine and grape juice - in this case it is termed "hydrophilic". When the oxygen bleach or bleach activator has a significant stain removal, whiteness-improving or cleaning effect on dingy, greasy, carotenoid, or other hydrophobic soils, it is termed "hydrophobic". The terms are applicable also when referring to peracids or bleach activators used in combination with a hydrogen peroxide source. The current commercial benchmarks for hydrophilic performance of oxygen bleach systems are: TAED or peracetic acid, for benchmarking hydrophilic bleaching. NOBS or NAPAA are the corresponding benchmarks for hydrophobic bleaching. The terms "hydrophilic", "hydrophobic" and "hydrotropic" with reference to oxygen bleaches including peracids and here extended to bleach activator have also been used somewhat more narrowly in the literature. See especially Kirk Othmer's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 4., pages 284-285. This reference provides a chromatographic retention time and critical micelle concentration-based set of criteria, arTd is useful to identify and/or characterize preferred sub-classes of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and hydrotropic oxygen bleaches<br>
and bleach activators that can be used in the present invention.<br>
While not preferred for compositions of the present invention which comprise<br>
detersive enzymes, the present invention compositions may also comprise as the<br><br><br>
bleaching agent a chlorine-type bleaching material. Such agents are well known in the art, and include for example sodium dichloroisocyanurate ("NaDCC"), or sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl).<br>
Bleach Activators<br>
Bleach activators useful herein include amides, imides, esters and anhydrides. Commonly at least one substituted or unsubstituted acyl moiety is present, covalently connected to a leaving group as in the structure R-C(0)-L. In one preferred mode of use, bleach activators are combined with a source of hydrogen peroxide, such as the perborates or percarbonates, in a single product, Conveniently, the single product leads to in situ production in aqueous solution (i.e., during the washing process) of the percarboxylic acid corresponding to the bleach activator. The product itself can be hydrous, for example a powder, provided that water is controlled in amount and mobility such that storage stability is acceptable. Alternately, the product can be an anhydrous solid or liquid. In another mode, the bleach activator or oxygen bleach is incorporated in a pretreatment product, such as a stain stick; soiled, pretreated ' substrates can then be exposed to further treatments, for example of a hydrogen peroxide source. With respect to the above bleach activator structure RC(0)L, the atom in the leaving group connecting to the peracid-forming acyl moiety R(C)0- is most typically 0 or N. Bleach activators can have non-charged, positively or negatively charged peracid-forming moieties and/or noncharged, positively or negatively charged leaving groups. One or more peracid-forming moieties or leaving-groups can be present. See, for example, U.S. 5,595,967, U.S. 5,561,235, U.S. 5,560,862 or the bis-(peroxy-carbonic) system of U.S. 5,534,179. Mixtures of suitable bleach activators can also be used. Bleach activators can be substituted with electron-donating or electron-releasing moieties either in the leaving-group or in the peracid-forming moiety or moieties, changing their reactivity and making them more or less suited to particular pH or wash conditions. For example, electron-withdrawing groups such as NO2 improve the efficacy of bleach activators intended for use in mild-pH<br>
(e.g., from about 7.5- to about 9.5) wash conditions.<br>
An extensive and exhaustive disclosure of suitable bleach activators and suitable leaving groups, as well as how to determine suitable activators, can be found in US Patents 5,686,014 and 5,622,646.<br>
Cationic bleach activators include quaternary carbamate-, quaternary carbonate-, quaternary ester- and quaternary amide- types, delivering a range of cationic peroxyimidic, peroxycarbonic or peroxycarboxylic acids to the wash. An analogous but non-cationic palette of bleach activators is available when quaternary derivatives<br><br><br>
are not desired. In more detail, cationic activators include quaternary ammonium-substituted activators of WO 96-06915, U.S. 4,751,015 and 4,397,757, EP-A-284292, EP-A-331,229 and EP-A-03520. Also useful are cationic nitriles as disclosed in EP-A-303,520 and in European Patent Specification 458,396 and 464,880.

Suitable bleach activators include any acetylated diamine types, whether hydrophilic or hydrophobic in character.<br>
Of the above classes of bleach precursors, preferred classes include the esters, including acyl phenol sulfonates, acyl alkyl phenol sulfonates or acyl oxybenzenesulfonates (OBS leaving-group); the acyl-amides; and the quaternary ammonium substituted peroxyacid precursors including the cationic nitriles.<br>
Preferred bleach activators include N,N,N'N'-tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED) or any of its close relatives including the triacetyl or other unsymmetrical derivatives, TAED and the acetylated carbohydrates such as glucose pentaacetate and tetraacetyl xylose are preferred hydrophilic bleach activators.

Depending on the activator and precise application, good bleaching results can be obtained from bleaching systems having with in-use pH of from about 6 to about 13, preferably from about 9.0 to about 10.5, Typically, for example, activators with electron-withdrawing moieties are used for near-neutral or sub-neutral pH ranges. Alkalis and buffering agents can be used to secure such pH.<br>
Acyl lactarn activators are very useful herein, especially the acyl caprolactams (see for example WO 94-28102 A) and acyl valerolactarns (see U.S. 5,503,639). See also U.S. 4,545,784 which discloses acyl caprolactams, including benzoyl caprolactam adsorbed into sodium perborate.

Transition Metal Bleach Catalysts;<br>
If desired, the bleaching compounds can be catalyzed by means of a manganese compound. Such compounds are well known in the art and include, for example, the manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5,246,621, U.S. Pat. 5,244,594; U.S. Pat. 5,194,416; U.S. Pat. 5,114,606; European Pat. App. Pub. Nos. 549.271A1, 549.272A1, 544,440A2, 544.490A1; and PCT applications PCT/IB98/00298 (Attorney Docket No. 6527X), PCT/IB98/00299 (Attorney Docket No. 6537), PCT/IB98/00300 (Attorney Docket No. 6525XL&amp;), and PCT/IB98/00302 (Attorney Docket No. 6524L#); Preferred examples of these catalysts include MnIV2(u-O)3(l,4,7-trimethyI~ 1,4,7-<br>

Other metal-based bleach catalysts include those disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,430,243, 5,114,611 5,622,646 and 5,686,014. The use of manganese with various complex ligands to enhance bleaching is also reported in the following United States Patents: 4,728,455; 5,284,944; 5,246,612; 5,256,779; 5,280,117; 5,274,147; 5,153,161; and 5,227,084.<br>
Cobalt bleach catalysts useful herein are known, and are described, for example, in M. L. Tobe, "Base Hydrolysis of Transition-Metal Complexes", Adv. Inorg, Bioinore.<br>
Mech.. (1983), 2, pages 1-94. The most preferred cobalt catalyst useful herein are cobalt pentaamine acetate salts having the formula [Co(NH3)50Ac] Ty, wherein "OAc"<br>
represents an acetate moiety and "Ty" is an anion, and especially cobalt pentaamine acetate chloride, [Co(NH3)50Ac]Cl2; as well as [Co(NH3)50Ac](OAc)2; [Co(NH3)5OAc](PF6)2; [Co(NH3)50Ac](S04); [Co(NH3)5OAc](BF4)2; and [Co(NH3)5OAc](N03)2 (herein "PAC"). These cobalt catalysts are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in the Tobe article and the references cited therein, and in U.S. Patent 4,810,410, to Diakun et al, issued March 7,1989.<br>
Compositions herein may also suitably include as a bleach catalyst the class of transition metal complexes of a macropolycyclic rigid ligaud The phrase "macropolycyclic rigid ligand" is sometimes abbreviated as "MRL". One useful MRL is [MnByclamC12], where "Bcyclam" is (5,l2-dimethyl-l,5,8,12-tetraaza-bicyclo[6,6.2]hexadecane). See PCT applications PCT/IB98/00298 (Attorney Docket No. 6527X), PCT/TO98/00299 (Attorney Docket No. 6537), PCT/IB98/00300 (Attorney Docket No. 6525XL&amp;), and PCT/IB98/00302 (Attorney Docket No, 6524L#). The amount used is a catalyticaliy effective amount, suitably about 1 cob or more, for<br>
example up to about 99.9%, more typically about 0.001 ppm or more, preferably 'from about 0,05 ppm to about 500 ppm (wherein "ppb" denotes parts per billion by weight and "ppm" denotes parts per million by weight).<br>
As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and cleaning processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per'hundred million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing medium, and will preferably provide from about 0.01 ppm to about 25 ppm, more preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 10 ppm, and most preferably from about 0.1 ppm to about 5 ppm, of the bleach catalyst species in the wash liquor. In order to obtain such-levels in the wash liquor of an automatic washing process, typical compositions herein will comprise from about 0.0005% to about 0.2%, more preferably from about 0.004% to about 0.08%, of bleach catalyst, especially manganese or cobalt catalysts, by weight of the cleaning compositions. Enzymatic sources of hydrogen peroxide<br>
On a different track from the bleach activators illustrated hereinabove, another suitable hydrogen peroxide generating system is a combination of a C1 -C4 alkanol oxidase and a C1 -C4 alkanol, especially a combination of methanol oxidase (MOX) and ethanol. Such combinations are disclosed in WO 94/03003. Other enzymatic materials related to bleaching, such as peroxidases, haloperoxidases, oxidases, superoxide dismutases, catalases and their enhancers or, more commonly, inhibitors, may be used as optional ingredients in the instant compositions. Oxygen transfer agents and precursors<br>
Also useful herein are any of the known organic bleach catalysts, oxygen transfer agents or precursors therefor. These include the compounds themselves and/or their precursors, for example any suitable ketone for production of dioxiranes and/or any of the hetero-atom containing analogs of dioxirane precursors or dioxiranes , such as sulfoiumines R*R2c=NSO2R3, see EP 446 982 A, published 1991 and sulfonyloxaziridines, see EP 446,981 A, published 1991, Preferred examples of such materials include hydrophilic or hydrophobic ketones, used especially in conjunction with monoperoxysulfates to produce dioxiranes in situ, and/or the imines described in U.S. 5,576,282 and references described therein. Oxygen bleaches preferably used in conjunction with such oxygen transfer agents or precursors include percarboxylic acids and salts, percarbonic acids and salts, peroxymonosulfuric acid and salts, and mixtures thereof. See also U.S. 5,360,568; U.S. 5,360,569; U.S. 5,370,826 and US 5,442,066.<br>
Although oxygen bleach systems and/or their precursors may be susceptible to decomposition during storage in the presence of moisture, air (oxygen and/or carbon dioxide) and trace .metals (especially rust or simple salts or colloidal oxides of the<br><br>
transition metals) and when subjected to light, stability can be improved by adding common sequestrants (chelants) and/or polymeric dispersants and/or a small amount of antioxidant to the bleach system or product. See, for example, U.S. 5,545,349. Antioxidants are often added to detergent ingredients ranging from enzymes to surfactants. Their presence is not necessarily inconsistent with use of an oxidant bleach; for example, the introduction of a phase barrier may be used to stabilize an apparently incompatible combination of an enzyme and antioxidant, on one hand, and an oxygen bleach, on the other. Although commonly known substances can be used as antioxidants, For example see US Patents 5686014, 5622646, 5055218, 4853143, 4539130 and 4483778. Preferred antioxidants are 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxytoIuene, 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone and D,L-alpha -tocopherol.<br>
Polymeric Soil Release Agent - The compositions according to the present invention may optionally comprise one or more soil release agents. Polymeric soil release agents are characterized by having both hydrophilic segments, to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers, such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments, to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of the laundry cycle and, thus, serve as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the soil release agent to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>
If utilized, soil release agents will generally comprise from about 0.01% to about 10% preferably from about 0.1% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 3% by weight, of the composition.<br>

Granular detergent compositions which contain these compounds typically contain from about 0.01% to about 10.0% by weight of the water-soluble ethoxylated amines; liquid detergent compositions typically contain about 0.01% to about 5%.<br>
A preferred soil release and anti-redeposition agent is ethoxylated tetraethylene pentamine. Exemplary ethoxylated amines are further described in U.S. Patent 4,597,898, VanderMeer, issued July 1, 1986. Another group of preferred clay soil removal-antiredeposition agents are the cationic compounds disclosed in European Patent Application 111,965, Oh and Gosselink, published June 27, 1984.

Polymeric Dispersing Agents - Polymeric dispersing agents can advantageously be utilized at levels from about 0.1% to about 7%, by weight, in the compositions herein, especially in the presence of zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Suitable polymeric dispersing agents include polymeric polycarboxylates and polyethylene glycols, although others known in the art can also be used. It is believed, though it is not intended to be limited by theory, that polymeric dispersing agents enhance overall detergent builder performance, when used in combination with other builders (including lower molecular weight polycarboxylates) by crystal growth inhibition, particulate soil release,<br>
*â€¢Â»<br>
peptization, and anti-redeposition.<br>
Polymeric polycarboxylate materials can be prepared by polymerizing or copolymerizing suitable unsaturated monomers, preferably in their acid form.

Use of polyacrylates of this type in detergent compositions has been disclosed, for example, in Diehl, U.S. Patent 3,308,067, issued March 7,1967.<br>
Acrylic/maleic-based copolymers may also be used as a preferred component of the dispersing/anti-redeposition agent. The average molecular weight of such copolymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 100,000, more preferably from about 5,000 to 75,000, most preferably from about 7,000 to 65,000. The , ratio of acrylate to maleate segments in such copolymers will generally range from about 30:1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to 2:1. Soluble acrylate/rnaleate copolymers of this type are known materials which are described in European Patent Application No. 66915, published December 15, 1982, as well as in EP 193,360, published September 3, 1986, which also describes such polymers comprising hydroxypropylacrylate, Still other useful dispersing agents .include the maleic/acrylic/vinyl alcohol terpolymers. Such materials are also disclosed in EP 193,360, including, for example, the 45/45/10 terpolymer of acrylic/maleic/vinyl alcohol.<br>
Another polymeric material which can be included is polyethylene glycol (PEG), PEG can exhibit dispersing agent performance as well as act as a clay soil removal-antiredeposition agent.

Briehtener - Any optical brighteners or other brightening or whitening agents known in the art can be incorporated at levels typically from about 0.01% to about 1.2%, by<br><br>
weight, into the detergent compositions herein when they are designed for fabric washing or treatment.<br>
Specific examples of optical brighteners which are useful in the present compositions are those identified in U.S. Patent 4,790,856, issued to Wixon on December 13, 1988.

See also U.S, Patent 3,646,015, issued February 29, 1972 to Hamilton.<br>
Polymeric Dye Transfer Inhibiting Aeents - The compositions of the present invention may also include one or more materials effective for inhibiting the transfer of dyes from one fabric to another during the cleaning process. Generally, such dye transfer inhibiting agents include polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, manganese phthalocyanme, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof. If used, these agents typically comprise from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.01% to about 5%, and more preferably from about 0.05% to about 2%.<br>
The amine N-oxide polymers typically have a ratio of amine to the amine N-oxide of 10:1 to 1:1,000,000. However, the number of amine oxide groups present in the polyamine oxide polymer can be varied by appropriate copolymerization or by an appropriate degree of N-oxidation. The polyamine oxides can be obtained in almost any degree of polymerization. Typically the average molecular weight is within the range of 500 to 1,000,000; more preferred 1,000 to 500,000; most preferred 5,000 to 100,000. This preferred class of materials can be referred to as "PVNO". See US Patent 5,633,255 to Fredj.<br>
The most preferred polyamine N-oxide useful in the detergent compositions herein is poly(4-vinylpyridine-N-oxide) which as an average molecular weight of about 50,000 and an amine to amine N-oxide r^atio of about 1:4.<br>
Copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole polymers (referred to as a class as "PVPVI") are also preferred for use herein. Preferably the PVPVI has an average molecular weight range from 5,000 to 1,000,000, more preferably from 5,000 to 200,000, and most preferably from 10,000. to 20,000. (The average molecular weight range is determined by light scattering as described in Barth, et al., Chemical Analysis.<br><br>
Vol. 113. "Modern Methods of Polymer Characterization", the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.) The PVPVI copolymers typically have a molar ratio of N-vinylimidazole to N-vinylpyirolidone from 1:1 to 0.2:1, more preferably from 0,8:1 to 0.3:1, most preferably from 0.6:1 to 0.4:1. These copolymers can be either linear or branched.<br>
The present invention compositions also may employ a polyvinylpyrrolidone ("PVP") having an average molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 400,000, preferably from about 5,000 to about 200,000, and more preferably from about 5,000 to about 50,000, PVP's are known to persons skilled in the detergent field; see, for example, EP-A-262,897 and EP-A-256,696, incorporated herein by reference. Compositions containing PVP can also contain polyethylene glycol ("PEG") having an average molecular weight from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 10,000. Preferably, the ratio of PEG to PVP on a ppm basis delivered in wash solutions is from about 2:1 to about 50:1, and more preferably from about 3:1 to about 10:1.<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain from about 0.005% to 5% by weight of certain types of hydrophilic optical brighteners which also provide a dye transfer inhibition action. If used, the compositions herein will preferably comprise from about 0.01% to 1% by weight of such optical brighteners.<br>
The hydrophilic optical brighteners useful in the present invention include, for example 4,4',-bis[(4-anilinO'6-(N-2-bis-hydroxyethyl)-S'triazine-2-yl)amino]-2,2'-stil-benedisulfonic acid and disodium salt (Tinopal-UNPA-GX), 4,4'-bis[(4-anilino-6-(N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylamino)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid disodium salt (Tinopal 5BM-GX) and 4,4'-bis[(4-anilino-6-moiphilino-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2(-stilbenedisulfonic acid, sodium salt (Tinopal AMS-GX) all by Ciba Geigy Corporation.<br>
The specific optical brightener species selected for use in the present invention provide especially effective dye transfer inhibition performance benefits when used in combination with the selected polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents hereinbefore described. The combination of such selected polymeric materials (e.g., PVNO and/or PVPVI) with such selected optical brighteners (e g., Tinopal UNPA-GX, Tinopal 5BM-GX and/or Tinopal AMS-GX) provides significantly better dye transfer inhibition in aqueous wash solutions than does either of these two detergent composition components when used alone. Without being bound by theory the extent to which brighteners deposit on fabrics in the wash solution can be defined by a parameter called the "exhaustion coefficient". The exhaustion coefficient is in general defined as the ratio of a) the brightener material deposited on fabric to b) the initial brightener concentration in the<br><br>
wash liquor.    Brighteners with relatively high exhaustion coefficients are the most suitable for inhibiting dye transfer in the context of the present invention.<br>
Other, conventional optical brightener types can optionally be used in the present compositions to provide conventional fabric "brightness" benefits, rather than a dye transfer inhibiting effect. Such usage is conventional and well-known to detergent formulations.<br>
Chelating Agents - The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain one or chelating agents, particularly chelating agents for adventitious transition metals. Those commonly found in wash water include iron and/or manganese in water-soluble, colloidal or paniculate form, and may be associated as oxides or hydroxides, or found in association with soils such as humic substances. . Preferred chelants are those which effectively control such transition metals, especially including controlling deposition of such transition-metals or their compounds on fabrics and/or controlling undesired redox reactions in the wash medium and/or at fabric or hard surface interfaces. Such chelating agents include those having low molecular weights as well as polymeric types, typically having at least one, preferably two or more donor heteroatoms such as 0 or N, capable of co-ordination to a transition-metal, Common chelating agents can be selected from the group consisting of aminocarboxylates, aminophosphonates, polyrunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents and mixtures thereof, all as hereinafter defined.<br>
Aminocarboxylates useful as optional chelating agents include ethylenediaminetetraacetates, N-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetates, nitrilo-triacetates, ethylenediamine tetrapropionates, triethylenetetraaminehexaacetates, diethylenetriammepentaacetates, and ethanoldiglycines, their alkali metal, ammonium, and substituted ammonium salts, and mixtures thereof.<br>

Polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents are also useful in the compositions herein. See U.S. Patent 3,812,044, issued May 21, 1974, to Connor et al, Preferred compounds of this type in addjorm are dihydroxydisulfobenzenes such as 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-disulfobenzene.<br>
A preferred biodegradable chelator for use herein is ethylenediamine disuccinate ("EDDS"), especially the [S,S] isomer as described in U.S. Patent 4,704,233, November 3^ 1987, to Hartman and Perkins.<br><br>
The compositions herein may also contain water-soluble methyl glycine diacetic acid (MGDA) salts (or acid form) as a chelant or co-builder useful with, for example, insoluble builders such as zeolites, layered silicates and the like.<br>
If utilized, chelating agents will generally comprise from about 0.001% to about 15% by weight of the detergent compositions herein. More preferably, if utilized, chelating agents will comprise from about 001% to about 3,0% by weight of such compositions.<br>
Suds Suppressors - Compounds for reducing or suppressing the formation of suds can be incorporated into the compositions of the present invention when required by the intended use, especially washing of laundry in washing appliances. Other compositions, such as those designed for hand-washing, may desirably be high-sudsing and may omit such ingredients Suds suppression can be of particular importance in the so-called "high concentration cleaning process" as described in U.S, 4,489,455 and 4,489,574 and in front-loading European-style washing machines.<br>
A wide variety of materials may be used as suds suppressors and are well known in the art. See, for example, Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7, pages 430-447 (Wiley, 1979).<br>
The compositions herein will generally comprise from 0% to about 10% of suds suppressor. When utilized as suds suppressors, monocarboxylic fatty acids, and salts thereof, will be present typically in amounts up to about 5%, preferably 0,5% - 3% by weight, of the detergent composition, although higher amounts may be used. Preferably from about 0.01% to about 1% of silicone suds suppressor is used, more preferably from about 0.25% to about 0.5%. These weight percentage values include any silica that may be utilized in combination with polyorganosiloxane, as well as any suds suppressor adjunct materials that may be utilized, Monostearyl phosphate suds suppressors are generally utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to about 2%, by weight, of the composition.

OptionalFabric- softener ingredients<br>
The fabric softening composition of the invention can also contain optional ingredients,    A comprehensive list of possible optional ingredients can be found in U.S. patent No. 5,747,443, which is incorporated herein by reference. Low molecular weight water soluble solvents - can also be used at levels of from 0% to about 12%, preferably from about 1% to about 10%, more preferably from about 2% to about 8%. The water soluble solvents cannot provide a clear product at the same low levels of the principal solvents described hereinbefore but can provide clear product when the principal solvent is not sufficient to provide completely clear product.   The presence of these water soluble solvents is therefore highly desirable.   Such solvents include; ethanol; isopropanol; 1,2-propanediol; 1,3-propanediol; propylene carbonate; etc. but do not include any of the principal solvents (B). These water soluble solvents have a greater affinity for water in the presence of hydrophobic materials like the softener active than the principal solvents.<br>
Briehteners - The fabric softening compositions herein can also optionally contain from about 0.005% to 5% by weight of certain types of hydrophilic optical brighteners which also provide a dye transfer inhibition action. If used, the compositions herein will preferably comprise from about 0.001% to 1% by weight of such optical brighteners.<br>

Optional Viscositv/Dispersibiliry Modifiers - Relatively concentrated fabric softening compositions containing both saturated and unsaturated diester quaternary ammonium compounds can be prepared that are stable without the addition of concentration aids. However, the fabric softening compositions of the present invention may require organic and/or inorganic concentration aids to go to even higher concentrations and/or to meet higher stability standards depending on the other ingredients. These concentration aids which typically can be viscosity modifiers may be needed, or preferred, for ensuring stability under extreme conditions when particular softener active levels are used. The surfactant concentration aids are typically selected from the group consisting of (1) single long chain alkyl cationic surfactants; (2) nonionic surfactants; (3) amine oxides; (4) fatty acids; and (5) mixtures thereof. These aids are described in P&amp;G Copending Application<br><br>
Serial No. 08/461,207, filed June 5,1995, Wahl et al, specifically on page 14, line 12 to page 20, line 12, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
When said dispersibility aids are present , the total level is from about 2% to about 25%, preferably from about 3% to about 17%, more preferably from about 4% to about 15%, and even more preferably from 5% to about 13% by weight of the composition. These materials can either be added as part of the active softener raw material e.g., the mono-long chain alkyl cationic surfactant and/or the fatty acid which are reactants used to form the biodegradable fabric softener active as discussed hereinbefore, or added as a separate component.<br>
Mono-Alkyl Cationic Quaternary Ammonium Compound - When the mono-alky! cationic quaternary ammonium compound is present, it is typically present at a level of from about 2% to about 25%, preferably from about 3% to about 17%, more preferably from about 4% to about 15%, and even more preferably from 5% to about 13% by weight of the composition, the total mono-alkyl cationic quaternary ammonium compound being at least at an effective level.<br>
Such mono-alkyl cationic quaternary ammonium compounds useful in the present invention are, preferably, quaternary ammonium salts of the general formula; [R4N+(R5)3] X-<br>
wherein R4 is C8-C22 alkyl or alkenyl group, preferably C10-C18 alkyl or alkenyl group; more preferably C10-C14 or C16-C18 alkyl or alkenyl group; each R5 is a C1-C6 alkyl or substituted alkyl group (e.g., hydroxy alkyl), preferably C1-C2 alkyl group, e.g.,<br>

Especially preferred dispersibility aids are monolauryl trimethyl ammonium chloride and monotallow trimethyl ammonium chloride available from Witco under the trade name VarisoftÂ® 471 and monooleyl trimethyl ammonium chloride available from Witco under the tradename VarisoftÂ® 417,<br>
The R4 group can also be attached to the cationic nitrogen atom through a group containing one, or more, ester, amide, ether, amine, etc., linking groups which can be desirable for increased concentratability of fabric softening compositions components. Such linking groups are preferably within, from about one to about three carbon atoms of the nitrogen atom.<br>
Mono-alkyl cationic quaternary ammonium compounds also include C8-C22<br>
alkyl choline esters. The preferred dispersibility aids of this type have the formula;<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R and X' are as defined previously.<br>
Highly preferred dispersibility aids include C12-C14 coco choline ester and C16-<br>
C18 tallow choline ester.<br>
Suitable biodegradable single-long-chain alkyl dispersibility aids containing an ester linkage in the long chains are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,840,738, Hardy and Walley, issued June 20,1989, said patent being incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When the dispersibility aid comprises alkyl choline esters, preferably the compositions also contain a small amount, preferably from about 2% to about 5% by weight of the composition, of organic acid. Organic acids are described in European Patent Application No. 404,471, Machin et al., published on Dec. 27, 1990, supra, which is herein incorporated by reference. Preferably the organic acid is selected from the group consisting of glycolic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds which can serve as the dispersibility aid include ethylbis(polyethoxy ethanol)alkylammonium ethyl-sulfate with 17 moles of ethylene oxide, available under the trade name VariquatÂ® 66 from Sherex Chemical Company; polyethylene glycol (15) oleammonium chloride, available under the trade name EthoquadÂ® 0/25 from Akzo; and polyethylene glycol (15) cocomonium chloride, available under the trade name EthoquadÂ® C/25 from Akzo.<br>
Although the main function of the dispersibility aid is to increase the dispersibility of the ester softener, preferably the dispersibility aids of the present invention also have some softening properties to boost softening performance of the composition, Therefore, preferably the compositions of the present invention are essentially free of non-nitrogenous ethoxylated nonlonic dispersibility aids which will decrease the overall softening performance of the compositions.<br>
Also, quaternary compounds having only a single long alkyl chain, can protect the cationic softener rrom interacting with anionic surfactants and/or detergent builders that are carried over into the rinse from the wash solution.<br>
Amine Oxides - Suitable amine oxides include those with one alkyl or hydroxyalkyl moiety of about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, preferably from about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms, more preferably from about 8 to about 14 carbon atoms, and two alkyl moieties selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups and hydroxyalkyl groups with about 1<br>

Soil Release Aeent - In the present fabric softening compositions, an optional soil release agent can be added. The addition of the soil release agent can occur in combination with the premix, in combination with the acid/water seat, before or after electrolyte addition, or after the final composition is made. The softening composition prepared by the process of the present invention herein can contain from 0% to about 10%, preferably from 0.2% to about 5%, of a soil release agent. Suitable soil release agents are described hereinbefore.<br>
Examples of suitable soil release agents include the commercially available materials Zelcon 4780Â® (from Dupont) and Milease TÂ® (from ICI).<br>
A more complete disclosure of soil release agents is contained in U.S, Pat. Nos.: 4,661,267, Decker, Konig, Straathof, and Gosselink, issued Apr. 28, 1987;  4,711,730,<br><br>
Gosselink and Diehl, issued Dec. 8, 1987; 4,749,596, Evans, Huntington, Stewart, Wolf, and Zimmerer, issued June 7, 1988; 4,818,569, Trinh, Gosselink, and Rattinger, issued April 4, 1989; 4,877,896, Maldonado, Trinh, and Gosselink, issued Oct, 31, 1989; 4,956,447, Gosselink et al., issues Sept. 1 1, 1990; and 4,976,879, Maldonado, Trinh, and Gosselink, issued Dec. 11, 1990, all of said patents being incorporated herein by reference.<br>
These soil release agents can also act as scum dispersants.<br>
Scum Dispersant - In the present invention, the premix can be combined with an optional scum dispersant, other than the soil release agent, and heated to a temperature at or above the melting point(s) of the components.<br>
The preferred scum dispersants herein are formed by highly ethoxylating hydrophobic materials. The hydrophobic material can be a fatty alcohol, fatty acid, fatty amine, fatty acid amide, amine oxide, quaternary ammonium compound, or the hydrophobic moieties used to form soil release polymers. The preferred scum dispersants are highly ethoxylated, e.g., more than about 17, preferably more- than about 25, more preferably more than about 40, moles of ethylene oxide per molecule on the average, with the polyethylene oxide portion being from about 76% to about 97%, preferably from about 81% to about 94%, of the total molecular weight.<br>
The level of scum dispersant is sufficient to keep the scum at an acceptable, preferably unnoticeable to the consumer, level under the. conditions of use, but not enough to adversely affect softening, For some purposes it is desirable that the scum is nonexistent. Depending on the amount of anionic or nonionic detergent, etc., used in the wash cycle of a typical laundering process, the efficiency of the rinsing steps prior to the introduction of the compositions herein, and the water hardness, the amount of anionic or nonionic detergent surfactant and detergency builder (especially phosphates and zeolites) entrapped in the fabric (laundry) will vary. Normally, the minimum amount of scum dispersant should be used to avoid adversely affecting softening properties. Typically scum dispersion requires at least about 2%, preferably at least about 4% (at least 6% and preferably at least 10% for maximum scum avoidance) based upon the level of softener active. However, at levels of about 10% (relative to the softener material) or more, one risks loss of softening efficacy of the product especially when the fabrics contain high proportions of nonionic surfactant which has been absorbed during the washing operation.<br>
Preferred scum dispersants are; Brij 700Â®; Varonic U-250Â®; Genapol T-500Â®, Genapol T-800Â®; Plurafac A-79Â®; and Neodol 25-50Â®.<br>

As can be seen from the foregoing, a wide variety of chelators can be used herein. Indeed, simple polycarboxylates such as citrate, oxydisuccinate, and the like, can also be<br><br>
used, although such chelators are not as effective as the amino carboxylates and phosphonates, on a weight basis. Accordingly, usage levels may be adjusted to take into account differing degrees of chelaiing effectiveness. The chelators herein will preferably have a stability constant (of the fully ionized chelator) for copper ions of at least-about 5, preferably at least about 7. Typically, the chelators will comprise from about 0.5% to about 10%, more preferably from about 0.75% to about 5%, by weight of the compositions herein. Preferred chelators include DETMP, DETPA, NTA, HDDS and mixtures thereof.<br>
Other Optional Ingredients - The present invention can include optional components conventionally used in textile treatment compositions, for example: colorants; preservatives; surfactants; anti-shrinkage agents; fabric crisping agents; spotting agents; germicides; fungicides; anti-oxidants such as butylated hydroxy toluene, anti-corrosion agents, and the like.<br>
Particularly preferred ingredients include water soluble calcium and/or magnesium compounds, which provide additional stability. The chloride salts are preferred, but acetate, nitrate, etc, salts can be used. The level of said calcium and/or magnesium salts is from 0% to about 2%, preferably from about 0,05% to about 0.5%, more preferably from about 0,1% to about 0.25%.<br>
The present invention can also include other compatible ingredients, including those as disclosed in copending applications Serial Nos.: 08/372,068, filed January 12, 1995, Rusche, et al.; 08/372,490, filed January 12, 1995, Shaw, et al.; and 08/277,558, filed July 19,1994, Hartman, et al., incorporated herein by reference. Form of the Cleaning compositions<br>
The cleaning compositions in accordance with the invention can take a variety of physical forms including granular, gel, tablet, bar, paste, cream and liquid forms. The form can be dependent upon the end use of the composition. The compositions include the so-called concentrated granular detergent compositions adapted to be added to a washing machine by means of a dispensing device placed in the machine drum with the soiled fabric load.<br>
The mean particle size of the components of granular compositions in accordance with the invention should preferably be such that no more that 5% of particles are greater than 1.7mm in diameter and not more, than 5% of particles are less than 0.15mm in diameter.<br>
The term mean particle size as defined herein is calculated by sieving a sample of the composition into a number of fractions (typically 5 fractions) on a series of Tyler sieves. The weight fractions thereby obtained are plotted against the aperture size of the<br><br>
sieves. The mean particle size is taken to be the aperture size through which 50% by weight of the sample would pass.<br>
Certain preferred granular detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention are the high-density types, now common in the marketplace; these typically have a bulk density of at least 600 g/liter, more preferably from 650 g/liter to 1200 g/iiter. Surfactant agglomerate particles<br>
One of the preferred methods of delivering surfactant in consumer products is to make surfactant agglomerate particles, which may take the form of flakes, prills, marumes, noodles, ribbons, but preferably take the form of granules, A preferred way to process the particles is by agglomerating powders (e.g. aluminosilicate, carbonate) with high active surfactant pastes and to control the particle size of the resultant agglomerates within specified limits. Such a process involves mixing an effective amount of powder with a high active surfactant paste in one or more agglomerators such as a pan agglomerator, a Z-blade mixer or more preferably an in-line mixer such as those manufactured by Schugi (Holland) BV, 29 Chioomstraat 8211 AS, Lelystad, Netherlands, and Gebruder Lodige Maschinenbau GmbH, D-4790 Paderbom 1, Elsenerstrasse 7-9, Postfach 2050, Germany. Most preferably a high shear mixer is used, such as a Lodige CB (Trade Name).<br>
A high active surfactant paste comprising from 50% by weight to 95% by weight, preferably 70% by weight to 85% by weight of surfactant is typically used. The paste may be pumped into the agglomerator at a temperature high enough to maintain a pumpable viscosity, but low enough to avoid degradation of the anionic surfactants used. An operating temperature of the paste of 50Â°C to 80"C is typical. Laundry washing method<br>
Machine laundry methods herein typically comprise treating soiled laundry with an aqueous wash solution in a washing machine having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine laundry detergent composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the detergent composition it is here meant from 40g to 300g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash solution of volume from 5 to 65 liters, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine laundry methods.<br>
As noted, surfactants are used herein in detergent compositions, preferably in combination with other detersive surfactants, at levels which are effective for achieving at least a directional improvement in cleaning performance. In the context of a fabric laundry composition, such "usage levels" can vary widely, depending not only on the<br><br>
type and severity of the soils and stains, but also on the wash water temperature,- the volume of wash water and the type of washing machine.<br>
In a preferred use aspect a dispensing device is employed in the washing method. The dispensing device is charged with the detergent product, and is used to introduce the product directly into the drum of the washing machine before the commencement of the wash cycle. Its volume capacity should be such as to be able to contain sufficient detergent product as would normally be used in the washing method.<br>
Once the washing machine has been loaded with laundry the dispensing device containing the detergent product is placed inside the drum. At the commencement of the wash cycle of the washing machine water is introduced into the drum and the drum periodically rotates. The design of the dispensing device should be such that it permits containment of the dry detergent product but then allows release of this product during the wash cycle in response to its agitation as the drum rotates and also as a result of its contact with the wash water.<br>
Alternatively, the dispensing device may be a flexible container, such as a bag or pouch, The bag may be of fibrous construction coated with a water impermeable protective material so as to retain the contents, such as is disclosed in European published Patent Application No, 0018678. Alternatively it may be formed of a water-insoluble synthetic polymeric material provided with an edge seal or closure designed to rupture in aqueous media as disclosed in European published Patent Application Nos. 0011500, 0011501, 0011502, and 0011968. A convenient form of water frangible closure comprises a water soluble adhesive disposed along and sealing one edge of a pouch formed of a water impermeable polymeric film such as polyethylene or polypropylene. Machine dishwashing method<br>
Any suitable methods for machine washing or cleaning soiled tableware, particularly soiled silverware are envisaged.<br>
A preferred machine dishwashing method comprises treating soiled articles selected from crockery, glassware, hollowware, silverware and cutlery and mixtures thereof, with an aqueous liquid having dissolved or dispensed therein an effective amount of a machine dishwashing composition in accord with the invention. By an effective amount of the machine dishwashing composition it is meant from 8g to 60g of product dissolved or dispersed in a wash~solution of volume from 3 to 10 liters, as are typical product dosages and wash solution volumes commonly employed in conventional machine dishwashing methods.<br><br>
Packaging for the compositions<br>
Commercially marketed executions of the bleaching compositions can be packaged in any suitable container including those constructed from paper, cardboard, plastic materials and any suitable laminates. A preferred packaging execution is described in European Application No. 94921505.7. Form of the Skin Care Compositions<br>
The skin care compositions in accordance with the invention can take a variety of physical forms including powder, gel, tablet, bar, paste, cream and liquid forms. The form can be dependent upon the end use of the composition. The skin care composition can also be in a tissue, baby wipe, or other similar articles. Form of the Personal Cleansing Compositions<br>
The personal cleansing compositions in accordance with the invention can take a variety of physical forms including powder, gel, tablet, bar, paste, cream and liquid forms. The form can be dependent upon the end use of the composition, Form of the fabric softener compositions<br>
Solid particulate compositions - The invention also comprises solid paniculate composition comprising:<br>
from about 50% to about 95%, preferably from about 60% to about 90%, of said biodegradable fabric softening active;<br>
optionally, from 0% to about 30%, preferably from about 3% to about 15%, of dispersibility modifier, and<br>
from 0% to about 10% of a pH modifier.<br>
Optional pH Modifier<br>
Since the biodegradable ester fabric softener actives are somewhat labile to hydrolysis , it is preferable to include optional pH modifiers in the solid particulate fabric softener compositions to which water is to be added, to form stable dilute or concentrated liquid softener compositions. Said stable liquid fabric softener compositions should have a pH (neat) of from about 2 to about 5, preferably from about 2 to about 4,5, more preferably from about 2 to about 4,<br>
The pH can be adjusted by incorporating a solid, water soluble Bronsted acid. Examples of suitable Bronsted acids include inorganic mineral acids, such as boric acid,<br>
v,<br>
sodium bisulfate, potassium bisulfate, sodium phosphate monobasic, potassium phosphate monobasic, and mixtures thereof; organic acids, such as citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, tannic acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, tartaric acid, glycolic acid, chloroacetic acid, phenoxyacetic acid, 1,2,3,4-butane tetracarboxylic acid, benzene sulfonic acid, benzene phosphonic acid, ortho-toluene sulfonic acid, para-<br><br>
toluene sulfonic acid, phenol sulfonic acid, naphthalene sulfonic acid, oxalic acid, 1,2,4,5-pyromelUtic acid, 1,2,4-trimellitic acid, adipic acid, benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, salicylic acid, succinic acid, and mixtures thereof; and mixtures of mineral inorganic acids and organic acids. Preferred pH modifiers are citric acid, gluconic acid, tartaric acid, 1,2,3,4-butane tetracarboxylic acid, malic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Optionally, materials that can form solid clathrates such as cyclodextrins and/or zeolites, etc,, can be used as adjuvants in the solid particulate composition as host carriers of concentrated liquid acids and/or anhydrides, such as acetic add, HC1, sulruric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, etc. An example of such solid clathrates is carbon dioxide adsorbed in zeolite A, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,888,998, Whyte and Samps, issued June 10, 1975 and U.S. Patent 4,007,134, Liepe and Japikse, issued Feb. 8,1977, both of said patents being incorporated herein by reference. Examples of inclusion complexes of phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid, and process for their preparation are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,365,061, issued Dec. 21,1982 to Szejtli et al, said patent being incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When used, the pH modifier is typically used at a level of from about 0.01% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 5%, by weight of the composition. Preparation of Solid Particulate Granular Fabric Softener<br>
The granules can be formed by preparing a melt, solidifying it by cooling, and then grinding and sieving to the desired size. In a three-component mixture, e.g., nonionic surfactant, single-long-cham cationic, and DEQA, it is more preferred, when forming the granules, to pre-mix the nonionic surfactant and the more soluble single-long-chain alkyl cationic compound before mixing in a melt of the dicster quaternary ammonium cationic compound.<br>
It is highly preferred that the primary particles of the granules have a diameter of from about 50 to about 1,000, preferably from about 50 to about 400, more preferably from about 50 to about 200, microns. The granules can comprise smaller and larger particles, but preferably from about 85% to about 95%, more preferably from about 95% to about 100%, are within the indicated ranges, Smaller and larger particles do not provide optimum emulsions/dispersions when added to water. Other methods of preparing the primary particles can be used including spray cooling of the melt. The primary particles can be agglomerated to form a dust-free, non-tacky, free-flowing powder. The agglomeration can take place in a conventional agglomeration unit (i.e., Zig-Zag Blender, Lodige) by means of a water-soluble binder. Examples of water-soluble binders useful in the above agglomeration process include glycerol, polyethylene glycols, polymers such as PVA, polyacrylates, and natural polymers such as sugars.<br><br>
The flowability of the granules can be improved by treating the surface of the<br>
granules with flow improvers such as clay, silica or zeolite particles, water-soluble<br>
inorganic salts, starch, etc.<br>
Method of Use	<br>
Water can be added to the particulate, solid, granular compositions to form dilute or concentrated liquid softener compositions for later addition to the rinse cycle of the laundry process with a concentration of said biodegradable cationic softening compound of from about 0,5% to about 50%, preferably from about 1% to about 35%, more preferably from about 4% to about 32%,. The particulate, rinse-added solid composition (1) can also be used directly in the rinse bath to provide adequate usage concentration (e.g., from about 10 to about 1,000 ppm, preferably from about 50 to about 500 ppm, of total softener active ingredient). The liquid compositions can be added to the rinse to provide the same usage concentrations.<br>
The water temperature for preparation should be from about 20Â°C to about 90Â°C, preferably from about 25Â°C to about 80Â°C. Single-long-chain alkyl cationic surfactants as the viscosity/dispersibility modifier at a level of from 0% to about 15%, preferably from about 3% to about 15%, more preferably from about 5% to about 15%, by weight of the composition, are preferred for the solid composition. Nonionic surfactants at a level of from about 5% to about 20%, preferably from about 8% to about 15%, as well as mixtures of these agents can also serve effectively as the viscosity/dispersibility modifier.<br>
The emulsified/dispersed particles, formed when the said granules are added to water to form aqueous concentrates, typically have an average particle size of less than about 10 microns, preferably less than about 2 microns, and more preferably from about 0.2 to about 2 microns, in order that effective deposition onto fabrics is achieved. The term "average particle size," in the context of this specification, means a number average particle size, i.e., more than 50% of the particles have a diameter less than the specified size,<br>
Particle size for the emulsified/dispersed particles is determined using, e.g., a Malvera particle size analyzer.<br>
Depending upon the particular selection of nonionic and cationic surfactant, it may be desirable in certain cases, when-using the solids to prepare the liquid, to employ an efficient means for dispersing and emulsifying the particles (e.g., blender).<br>
Solid particulate compositions used to make liquid compositions can, optionally, contain electrolytes, perfume, antifoam agents, flow aids (e.g., silica), dye, preservatives, and/or other optional ingredients described hereinbefore.<br><br>
The benefits of adding water to the particulate solid composition to form aqueous compositions to be added later to the rinse bath include the ability to transport less weight thereby making shipping more economical, and the ability to form liquid compositions similar to those that are normally sold to consumers, e.g., those that are described herein, with lower energy input (i.e., less shear and/or lower temperature). Furthermore, the particuiate granular solid fabric softener compositions, when sold directly to the consumers, have less packaging requirements and smaller, more disposable containers. The consumers will then add the compositions to available, more permanent, containers, and add water to pre-dilute the compositions, which are then ready for use in the rinse bath, just like the liquid compositions herein. The liquid form is easier to handle, since it simplifies measuring and dispensing. Drver Activated compositions - The present invention also relates to improved solid dryer-activated fabric softener compositions which are either incorporated into articles of manufacture, e.g., on a substrate, or, are in the form of particles similar to those disclosed above, (including, where appropriate, agglomerates, pellets, and tablets of said particles). Such compositions typically contain from about 10% to about 95% of fabric softening agent.<br>
Substrate Articles - In preferred embodiments, the present invention encompasses articles of manufacture. Representative articles are those that are adapted for use to provide unique perfume benefits and to soften fabrics in an automatic laundry dryer, of the types disclosed in U.S. Pat Nos.: 3,989,631 Marsan, issued Nov, 2,1976; 4,055,248, Marsan, issued Oct. 25, 1977; 4,073,996, Bedenk et al., issued Feb. 14,1978; 4,022,938, Zaki et al., issued May 10,1977; 4,764,289, Trinh, issued Aug. 16,1988; 4,808,086, Evans et al., issued Feb. 28,1989; 4,103,047, Zaki et al., issued July 25,1978; 3,736,668, Dillarstone, issued June 5,1973; 3,701,202, Compa et al., issued Oct 31,1972; 3,634,947, Furgal, issued Jan. 18,1972; 3,633,538, Hoeflin, issued Jan. 11, 1972; and 3,435,537, Rumsey, issued Apr. 1,1969; and 4,000,340, Murphy et al., issued Dec. 28, 1976, all of said patents being incorporated herein by reference.<br>

Preparation, of LASPowder for Use as .a Structurant Sodium C\2 linear alkyl benzene sulfonate (NaLAS) is processed into a powder<br>
containing two phases. One of these phases is soluble in the non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions herein and the other phase is insoluble. It is the insoluble fraction which serves to add structure and particle suspending capability to the non-aqueous phase of the compositions herein.<br>
NaLAS powder is produced by taking a slurry of NaLAS in water (approximately 40-50% active) combined with dissolved sodium sulfate.(3-15%) and hydrotrope, sodium sulfosuccinate (1-3%). The hydrotrope and sulfate are used to improve the â€¢characteristics of the dry powder. A drum dryer is used to dry the slurry into a flake. When the NaLAS is dried with the sodium sulfate, two distinct phases are created within the flake. The insoluble phase creates a network structure of aggregate small particles (0.4-2 urn) which allows the finished non-aqueous detergent product to stably suspend solids.<br>
The NaLAS'powder prepared according to this example has the following makeup<br>
shown in Table I.<br>
