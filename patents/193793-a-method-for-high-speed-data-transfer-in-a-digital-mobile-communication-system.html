The present invention relates to a method for high-speed data transfer in a digital mobile communication system; particularly to high-speed multichannel data services (HSCSD) on a radio interface of a mobile communication system.<br>
In mobile telecommunication systems of the time division multiple access (TDMA) type, time-division communication takes place on the radio path in successive TDMA frames, each of which consists of several time slots. In each time slot, a short information packet is sent as a radio frequency burst, which has a finite duration and which, consists of a set of modulated bits. The time slots are mainly used for transmitting control channels and traffic channels. On the traffic channels, speech and data are transmitted. On the control channels, signaling between a base station and mobile subscriber stations is carried out. An example of a TDMA radio system is the Pan-European mobile communication system GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications).<br>
In conventional TDMA systems, each mobile station is assigned one traffic channel for data or speech transmission. Thus, the GSM system, for instance, may have up to eight parallel connections to different mobile stations on a same carrier wave. The maximum data transfer rate on one traffic channel is restricted to a relatively low level according to the available bandwidth and the channel coding and error correction used in the transmission, for example in the GSM system to 12 kbit /s, 6 kbit / s, or 3.6 kbit / s.<br>
A digital mobile communication system typically uses several connection types which can be divided into two categories : transparent and non-transparent connections. On a transparent connection, data is<br><br>
transferred  through  a  traffic  channel  of  the  mobile communication system in a transparent way, which means that error correction on the radio path is carried out by employing channel cdding only.  In the GSM system the channel coding is Forward Error Correction (FEC). A non-transparent  connection  uses, ' in  addition  to  channel coding,  an  additional  protocol  in  which  the  data transmission over the traffic channel is repeated in case the data was not received correctly at the other end. In the GSM system, this communication protocol is Radio Link Protocol  (RLP),  used between a terminal adaptor of a mobile station MS and an interworking function IWF, which is typically at a mobile services switching center MSC. The RLP is a balanced (HDLC type) data transfer protocol having a frame structure. Error correction by the RLP is based on retransmission of frames corrupted on the traffic channel. There is another protocol, Layer 2 Relay (L2R), above the RLP.  In the present patent application,  the functional part of the TAF or IWF carrying out these protocols is referred to as an L2R/RLP unit.<br>
Ir. a normal data transfer ■ state, the L2R/KLP unit packs user data into 200-bit long protocol data units (PDU) , which are transmitted in 240-bit RLP frames over the radio interface to a second L2R/RLP unit. If there is no data or other information to be transferred between the two L2R/RLP units, discontinuous transmission (DTX) may be applied. DTX refers to a method reducing transmission on the radio path to a minimum (i.e. interrupt the transmission) during pauses in the data transfer. The aim is to reduce the power consumption of the transmitter, a very significant matter for the mobile stations, as well as the overall interference level on the radio path, which has an effect on the system capacity. The DTX operates independently for the uplink and downlink directions. The mobile communication, network mav either allow or prohibit<br><br>
the use of DTX.<br>
In normal L2R/JLP operation, the PDUs are possibly filled only partially, because the application may limit the maximum user rate below the maximum rate on a traffic channel. The PDUs may be full if the actual user data rate on the terminal interface is high enough or if, due to delays caused by re-transmission or some other congestion, the L2R/RLP buffer has enough user data to fill one PDU completely. It is also possible, depending on the implementation, to prefer full PDUs to partially full PDUs. This can be accomplished by using a timer or a counter to slightly delay the building of a PDU until there is enough data available (e.g. in a buffer) for a full PDU to be built, or until the building of a PDU, albeit only a partially full PDU, cannot be delayed any longer. The timer may have a typical value in the order of 20 ms, in other words the repetition period of TDMA frames. The timer value should be relatively short in order not to introduce additional data transmission delays.<br>
However,  the data rates of present-day mobile communication networks are not sufficient for the new, high-speed data services. A solution is proposed for introducing higher data rates for mobile communication systems in the applicant's co-pending PCT application W095/31878,  unpublished on the priority date of the present application: two or more parallel traffic channels (subchannels) are used on the radio path for one high¬speed data connection. The high-speed data signal is distributed  to  the  parallel  subchannels  at  the transmitting end for the transmission over the radio path, and then combined at the receiving end. In this manner, it is possible to provide data transfer services which, depending on the number of allocated traffic channels, have a transfer rate up to 8 times the conventional data<br><br>
rate. In the GSM system, for example, the total user data<br>
transfer rate 19.2 kbit/s is obtained with twfe- parallel<br>
subchannels. This principle is also referred to as a<br>
multi-slot channel technique. High-speed data service thus<br>
obtained are referred to as HSCSD (High Speed Circuit<br>
Switched Data) services.<br>
If the user data rate in a HSCSD service is lower<br>
than the maximum capacity of the radio link protocol,<br>
partially filled PDUs may be built and transmitted over<br>
the radio interface in the RLP frames. It is also possible<br>
that some subchannels carry full PDUs in their RLP frames<br>
and some subchannels occasionally carry partially full or<br>
i empty PDUs in their RLP frames.<br>
For the mobile station, this inefficient use of<br>
transmission capacity may lead to an unnecessarily high<br>
power consumption, heating of RF and other elements, and<br>
possibly  a  more  complex  scheduling  of  reception,<br>
transmission and neighbour cell monitoring than necessary<br>
for the actual user data rate.<br>
For the radio interface, this leads to an increased interference, either' in the uplink or the downlink direction, or both. For the base station and the IWF, reducing complexity is not that much of an issue as for the MS.<br>
The prior art DTX implementation, and the slightly delayed building of PDUs can relief the situation somewhat but not completely. The DTX is mainly used mainly in cases when there is nothing at all to be transmitted. When some data has to be transmitted (at a low rate) , the transmission requiring only a fraction of the allocated bandwidth, the conventional DTX does not suffice.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is a discontinuous transmission suitable for multichannel high¬speed data links.<br><br>
This object is achieved by a method for high-speed data transfer in a digital mobile communication system, the method comprising the steps of establishing a non-transparent data connection having a number of parallel subchannels allocated on the radio interface, said number being determined by a specific maximum transfer capacity; receiving user data from a terminal interface at a varying user data rate; transmitting user data over the non-transparent data connection in data frames by employing a communication protocol which acknowledges data frames received correctly and retransmits defective data frames; buffering data frames to be transmitted in a transmission buffer;  storing  the  data  frame  transmitted  in  the transmission buffer for a possible retransmission until an acknowledgement is received from the receiving end. The method is characterized by determining the actual user data rate on the terminal interface; determining a minimum number of subchannels, said number being determined by the actual user data rate; transmitting user data in data frames only via specific subchannels corresponding in number to said minimum number of subchannels; interrupting transmission or activating discontinuous transmission on each surplus subchannel allocated to the connection; monitoring  fill  level  of  the  transmission  buffer; continuing  transmission or  deactivating discontinuous transmission on at least one of said surplus subchannels if the transmission buffer fill level reaches a first threshold value; interrupting transmission or reactivating discontinuous transmission on at least one  of said surplus subchannels  if  the  transmission  buffer  fill  level decreases to a second threshold level.<br>
The basic concept of the present invention is to transmit frames of the radio link protocol (RLP) selectively only via specific subchannels in cases the maximum data transfer capacity allocated to the data link<br><br>
is not required. This is important because interleaving on the radio interface spreads an RLP frame over several TDMA frames.  If  the  RLP  frames  were  transmitted  over arbitrarily selected subchannels without any consistency, many or maybe all allocated subchannels would constantly be  "active".  According  to  the  present  invention, transmissions are concentrated on specific subchannels only, whereas the other subchannels allocated to the connection carry no transmission at all, or^they employ subchannel-specific DTX. The direct benefits of a lower number of active subchannels include reduced transmitter power consumption, less temperature problems and a simpler timing  of  reception,   transmission,   and  measuring neighbouring  cells.  In  addition,  as  the 'number  of unnecessary transmissions on the radio interface is lower, the interference level in the mobile communication network will be lower.<br>
The required minimum number of subchannels can be determined  by  monitoring  the  data  flow  into  the transmission buffer i.e. the actual user data rate. Furthermore, by monitoring the amount of bufferid data it is possible to determine whether more active subchannels will be  required than said minimum number,  and to dynamically  increase  and  decrease  the  number  of subchannels in use. Data amount mentioned above can be represented e.g. data rate, buffer status, number of PDUs or RLP frames etc. Dtetermining the number of subchannels used, and weightings for different subchannels may be based on various mathematical and statistical variables of the amount of input and buffered data, such variables being for example instantaneous value, a fixed average, a moving  average,  or  some  other  statistical  variable (geometric mean, median, etc) . This allows the control process to react in a controlled fashion to sudden, slow, temporary or  long  term changes  in  the  transmission<br><br>
capacity requirements and availability. Such changes may be caused by, for example, handover, bad coverage (temporary or long 'term), a data transfer request, requested retransmission of corrupted data, allocation of new subchannels to the connection, removal of subchannels from the connection, and changes in the radio interface channel coding.<br>
There are different ways to choose the subchannels on which data Lt'ctiiaier will be conllmu-d. uiu- ul I lit-embodiments of the invention utilizes a subchannel preference list which organizes the subchannels according to principles such as: (1) an order based on the position of subchannels in a TDMA frame, (2) a predetermined order which depends on the total number of subchannels on the connection, (3) an order to be negotiated during the connection, or (4) an arbitrary order. Even an arbitrary order is advantageous if maintained the same for the<br>

Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The present invention can be applied to a high¬speed data transmission in digital mobile communication systems utilizing various multiple access methods, such as TDMA or CDMA. In different multiple access methods the physical concept of traffic channel varies, being primarily defined by a time slot in TDMA systems, a spreading code in CDMA systems, a radio channel in FDMA systems, a combination thereof, etc. The basic concept of the present invention is, however, independent of the type of the traffic channel and the multiple access method used.<br>
The, present invention can be used in all digital data transfer systems on a non-transparent data link comprising several parallel subchannels (e.g. multi-slot access).<br>
The present invention is particularly well suited to data transfer applications in digital TDMA mobile communication systems, such as the Pan-EuropeSn digital mobile communication system GSM, DCS1800 (Digital Communication System), a mobile communication system according to the EIA/TIA Interim Standard IS/41.3, etc. Below, the invention will be described by using the GSM system as an example but without restricting the invention to it. Figure 1 very»,briefly shows the basic structure of the GSM system, not paying closer attention to its characteristics or other aspects of the system. For a more detailed description of the GSM system, the GSM recommendations and "The GSM System for Mobile Communications", M. Mouly &amp; M. Pautet, Palaiseau, France, 1992, ISBN:2-9507190-0-7, are referred to.<br>
A mobile services switching centre MSC handles the connecting of incoming and outgoing calls. It performs functions similar to those of an exchange of a public<br><br>
switched telephone network (PSTN). In addition to these, it also performs functions characteristic of mobile communications only, such as subscriber location management, jointly with the subscriber registers (not shown) of the network. The mobile stations MS are connected to the center MSC by base station systems BSS. The base station system BSS consists of a base station controller BSC and base stations BTS.<br>
The GSM system is a time division multiple access (TDMA) system in which time-division traffic takes place on the radio path in 'successive TDMA frames each of which consists of several time slots. In each time slot, a short information packet is sent as a radio frequency burst which has a finite duration and which consists of a set of modulated bits. The time slots are mainly used for transmitting control channels and traffic channels. On the traffic channels, speech and data are transmitted. On the control channels, signalling between a base station and mobile subscriber stations is carried out. Channel structures used on the radio interface of the GSM system are defined in closer detail in the GSM recommendation 05.02. In operating according to the recommendation, at the beginning of a call a mobile station MS is assigned a time slot from a carrier wave as a traffic channel (Single Slot Access) . The MS synchronizes to this time slot to transmit and receive radio frequency bursts.<br>
In the GSM system, a data link is established between a mobile station MS network terminal TAF (Terminal Adaptation Function) 31 and a network adaptor IWF (Interworking Function) 41 in the fixed network (usually at the MSC) . The data link is a circuit-switched connection which reserves one (or more) traffic channel(s) from the radio interface for the duration of the connection. In the GSM network, the data link in data transfer  is  a  V.110  rate  adapted,  V.24  interface<br><br>
compatible, UDI coded digital Full Duplex connection. The V.110 connection is originally a digital transmission channel developed for ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), specified in the recommendation CCITT Blue Book V.110. The terminal adaptor TAF adapts a data terminal TE connected to the MS for the V. 1.1.0 connection which in Figure 1 is established over a circuit-switched connection using traffic channel chO. The network adaptor IWF adapts the V.110 connection to another V.110 network such as an ISDN or another GSM network,  or to another transit network, e.g. the public switched telephone network PSTN. In addition, the traffic channel employs channel coding FEC (Forward Error Correction) with the aim of reducing the effect of transmission errors on the radio path. The GSM system employs convolution coding according to the GSM recommendation 05.03, the efficiency of which can be illustrated by a convolution coding ratio X/Y, which signifies that X data bits are represented in the channel coding by Y code bits. On a full-rate GSM traffic channel, on user data rates 9.6 kbit/s, 4.8 kbit/s and 2.4, the convolution Coding ratios of 1/2 (punctured), 1/3 and 1/6, respectively, are employed.<br>
The circuit-switched non-transparent connection between the TAF and the IWF on a GSM traffic channel comprises several protocol layers.<br>
The terminal interface between the MS terminal adaptor TAF and the data terminal equipment, as well as the interface between the IWF and e.g. an audio modem MODEM are in accordance with CCITT V.24, and in Figure 2 the terminal interface is marked with the symbol L2. As far as the invention is concerned, the interesting protocols are L2R (Layer 2 Relay) and RLP (Radio Link Protocol) which both are at the terminal adaptor TAF and the network adaptor IWF at both ends of the connection. In addition, the connection has, as illustrated in Figure 2,<br><br>
different kinds of Rate Adaptation (RA) functions, such as RA1' between the TAF and a CCU unit (Channel Codec Unit) located at the BSS, RA1 between the CCU and the IWF, RAA between the CCU and a transcoder unit TRAU placed apart from the base station, and RA2 between the TRAU and the IWF. The rate adaptation RA functions are defined in the GSM recommendations 04.21 and 08.20. Communication between the CCU and the TRAU is defined in the GSM recommendation 08.60.<br>
The information rate-adapted on the radio interface RA1' is furthermore channel-coded the way specified in the GSM recommendation 5.03, illustrated by blocks FEC in the MS and CCU.<br>
The.present invention, however, only relates to the L2R/RLP operation of the TAF and the IWF, and communication between them. The other aforementioned lower layer protocols, functions and units only provide a transmission path according to the GSM recommendations between L2R/RLP units, and they are not significant to the present invention with the exception of channel coding FEC. Consequently, the other,functions are not described herein in any greater detail.<br>
L2R (Layer 2 Relaying) functionality for non-transparent character-oriented protocols is defined e.g. in the GSM recommendation 07.02. L2R packs the user data and the status information originating from the terminal interface into 200-bit, 25-octet long PDUs (Protocol Data Units), such as the one illustrated in Figure 3. The octets are numbered 0-24, octet 0 being transmitted first. The bits in the octets are numbered 1-8, bit 1 being transmitted first. In a PDU, the octet may be a status octet, a character (higher layer data) or fill bits. Octet 0 is always a status octet. A status octet comprises 3 bits, SA, SB and X for the status of the V.24 connection, and 5 bits that indicate the number of data octets<br><br>
succeeding the status octet, as well as the special indications of the data octets such as empty and PDU. In Figure 3, status octet 0 is succeeded by 3 data octets into which the word "GSM" has been packed, after which a new status octet 4 follows.<br>
The L2R PDUs are packed in a frame according to the RLP protocol, such a frame being shown in Figure 4. The RLP protocol is specified in the GSM recommendation 04.22. The RLP is a balanced  (HDLC type of)  data transfer protocol with a frame structure, in which error correction is based on retransmitting corrupted frames at the request of the receiving party. The RLP extends from the mobile station MS terminal adaptor TAF to the network adaptor IWF, which is usually located at the MSC. As shown by Figure 4, the RLP frame structure comprises a header field (16 bits) , an information field (200 bits) , and a frame check sequence (24 bits). The 200-bit L2R PDU is packed in the information field. As a result, the net RLP data rate is clearly above the maximum 9.6 kbit/s data rate for one channel, which allows a specific number of retransmissions without a decline in. the nominal user rate. For example, if the user rate on the terminal interface is 9600 bit/s and the data rate on the radio interface is 12 kbit/s, the "surplus  capacity"  is,  depending  on  the  character structure being used, at least 12.5%.<br>
The transmission buffer buffers the data received from the V.24 interface so that data will not be lost even if the MS is not able to transmit it instantly over the radio interface. A reception buffer buffers data which is transferred to the V.24 interface so that data received from a traffic channel will not be lost even if it cannot immediately be forwarded via the V.24 interface to e.g. the terminal equipment TE. The RLP protocol also includes a flow control, used to adjust the fill level of the transmission and reception buffers. The flow control is<br><br>
specified in the GSM'recommendation 07.02. The criterion used to activate the flow control may be a half full transmission or reception buffer.<br>
The maximum user data rate on a single GSM traffic channel is restricted to 9.6 kbit/s.<br>
In high-speed data services (HSCSD), several traffic channels are assigned to a data call; in other words, two or more time slots are. assigned from the same TDMA frame. An example of how to carry out high-speed data transfer based on a multitude of traffic channels is disclosed in the applicant's co-pending PCT application W095/31878 and W096/18248. However, it should be noted that as far as the. invention ia concerned, the only significant matter is,that a multichannel data link can be cuLabilulled.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a GSM network architecture implementing such a data transfer on several parallel traffic channels. Figure 5 is similar to Figure 1, with the exception that in Figure 5 there is, between the TAF and IWF, a circuit-switched non-transparent connection which consists of N parallel traffic channels chO-chn, where N=l,2,3... . In the mobile station, the TAF functions as a divider which splits the high-speed data signal DATA IN originating from the data terminal equipment into parallel traffic channels chO-chn, and a combiner which combines the subsignals received from the parallel traffic channels chO-chn back into a high-speed data signal DATA OUT. Correspondingly at the other end of the multichannel data link, the IWF functions as a divider which splits the input high-speed data signal DATA IN into parallel traffic channels chO-chn, and a combiner which combines the subsignals received from the parallel traffic channels chO-chn back into a high-speed data signal DATA DUT.<br>
The protocol structure of Figure 2 ma<y also be></y><br>
applied to the Figure 5 multichannel connection architecture. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the L2R/RLP unit is common to all the traffic channels allocated for the same connection. Out of these, the RLP at the same time functions as the aforementioned divider and combiner. However, each traffic channel is provided with a dedicated rate adaptation (RA) and channel coding (FEC) functions, as illustrated by Figure 2. Thus, from the view point of the L2R/RLP unit, the multichannel data link is substantially similar to a single channel link; the "transmission channel" between them only has more capacity than before.<br>
The HSCSD connection can also be illustrated by the block diagram of Figure 6, in which the L2R and RLP protocol functions are distributed into separate units 62 and 63 in the TAF/MS and correspondingly into units 64 and 65 in the IWF/MSC at the receiving end. Unit L2R packs the data in the L2R PDUs as described above. However, in the HSCSD slightly modified PDUs are employed; the number of bits in the PDUs is smaller, i.e. 192. The reason for this is to compensate for the reducing user data rate in the RLP protocol, the reduction being caused by the extra overhead information required by the HSCSD in the RLP frames. As to the present invention, the difference caused by the HSCSD in the PDUs and the RLP frames is not relevant and will not be described here in closer detail. The terms PDU and RLP in this application are used to refer to all the versions.<br>
L2R unit 62 outputs the PDUs to RLP unit 63 . RLP unit 63 inserts the PDUs in RLP frames and splits them in subchannels chl-chn, where n is an integer and a 2. A radio transceiver TRx carries out for each subchannel (following rate adaptation and channel coding) building of bursts, interleaving and modulation, and transmission over the radio interface in a corresponding subchannel' time<br><br>
slot. The BTS radio transceiver TRx receives the bursts in the subchannel time slots, and carries out deinterleaving separately for each subchannel, and (following channel decoding) forwards the RLP frames of each subchannel chl-chn to RLP unit 64 which combines the PDUs and feeds them to L2R unit 65. Between the BTS and IWF, the RLP frames have to be transferred in TRAU frames but this is not significant to the present invention.<br>
When the user data rate in a HSCSD service substantially corresponds with the maximum capacity allocated to the connection, full PDUs are transmitted on all subchannels. If, as noted earlier, the useir data rate in a HSCSD service is lower than the maximum capacity of the radio link protocol, L2R unit 62 may build partially filled PDUs and transmit them over the radio interface subchannels in RLP frames. Conventionally, however, the transmission has been distributed arbitrarily on all the subchannels chO-chn', with the result that all the subchannels are more or less active.<br>
According to the present invention, RLP unit 63 uses for transmitting RLP frames only a specific portion of the subchannels( chl-chn in cases the maximum data transfer capacity allocated to the connection is not required. On the other, unused subchannels, there is no transmission present at all, or they have a channel-specific DTX. The minimum number of subchannels used is defined according to the actual data user rate into the L2R unit, and the need for any additional channels is defined according to the buffered data amount. This will be described in the exemplary embodiment below with reference to Figure 6.<br>
The amount of input data, and the fill level of the buffers in the L2R unit 62 and RLP unit 63 are monitored by a DTX control unit 61. At first, it is assumed that the maximum transfer capacity allocated to a data call is<br><br>
three traffic channels, i.e. 3x9.6 kbit/s =28.8 kbit/s. DTX control 61 monitors the actual user data rate of the data flow into L2R unit 62. If the average user data rate exceeds the capacity of two subchannels, i.e 19200 kbit/s, the minimum capacity required will be three subchannels, i.e the same as the maximum capacity allocated to the data link. If that is the case, DTX control 61 directs RLP unit 63 to transmit in the normal manner on all three subchannels.<br>
It is further assumed that the average user data rate into L2R unit 62 drops during the call to a value lower than 19.2 kbit/s, e.g. 18 kbit/s. DTX control 61 defines a minimum number of traffic channels for the aforementipned average user data rate of 18 kbit/s, i.e. two subchannels. DTX control unit 61 thereby directs RLP unit 63 to actively transmit on only two subchannels, for example on subchannels chl and ch2. Transmission on the third subchannel ch3 will be temporarily interrupted or discontinuous transmission DTX according to the GSM specifications will be activated on it. In such a case, RLP unit 63 transmits, to the subchannel ch3, L2 fill frames according to the GSM recommendation 04.06, item 5.4.2.3. The TRX receives these RLP frames from RLP unit 63, but only forwards them onto the radio path in specific TDMA frame subgroups, specified in the GSM recommendation 05.08, item 8.3. At other times, the subchannel has no transmission in the DTX mode.<br>
DTX control 61 continues to monitor the average user data rate, and simultaneously monitors at least the fill level of the RLP unit 63 buffer. The RLP buffer contains both the RLP frames to be transmitted for the first time and RLP frames already transmitted to which no acknowledgement has yet been received from the receiving end. DTX control 61 may have e.g. two threshold values for the buffer fill level. When the fill level of the RLP<br><br>
buffer is below a specific threshold value, DTX control 61 considers  the  present  number  of  subchannels  to  be adequate. If the buffer fills to this threshold value, DTX control 61 considers the present number of subchannels to be inadequate for data transmission. This leads to DTX control 61 deactivating DTX from subchannel ch3. RLP unit 63  begins  to  transmit  user data  in RLP  frames  on subchannel ch3,  too, even though the minimum capacity-corresponding to the average user data rate of 18 kbit/s is two subchannels. As a result, the RLP unit©63 buffer begins to empty. As soon as the buffer empties down to the lower predetermined  threshold value,  DTX control  61 considers  the  minimum capacity corresponding  to  the average user data rate,  i.e two subchannels,  to be adequate for transmission. Consequently, DTX control 61 reactivates DTX on subchannel ch3 . RLP unit 63 recommences transmitting RLP frames containing user data only via subchannels chl and ch2. Via subchannel ch3, fill frames are transmitted.<br>
If the average user data rate drops to lower than 9.6 kbit/s, the minimum capacity required is one subchannel. In such a case, the DTX mode will also be activated e.g. on subchannel ch2, and user data is only transmitted on subchannel chl. DTX control 61 continuously monitors the buffer fill level of RLP unit 63, and if necessary deactivates DTX from one or more subchannels.<br>
If the average user data rate again gains a value higher than 19.2 kbit/s, DTX control 61 again takes all the allocated subchannels chl-ch3 in normal use.<br>
Alternatively, the fill level of the buffer in RLP unit 63 may have several threshold values in both directions. Upon filling of the buffer to a specific threshold value, DTX is deactivated from one or more subchannels; upon reaching the next threshold value, DTX is again deactivated from one or more subchannels, etc. In<br><br>
a similar manner, as the buffer empties to a threshold value, DTX is reactivated on one or more subchannels; as the next threshold values is reached, DTX is again activated on one or more subchannels, etc.<br>
At the receiving end, the BTS and the IWF operate as normal, receiving on all subchannels. DTX on specific subchannels is dealt with according to the GSM recommendations.<br>
The invention is most advantageous when applied to a MS transmission. The method is also applicable when transmitting from the mobile communication network to the mobile station, whereby the radio interference level in the mobile communication network will be lower.$<br>
As noted above, for determining the user data rate and monitoring the buffer fill level, different kind of statistical methods can be applied. Also, as noted above, the traffic channels to be used at any one time may be selected according to a specific preference list.<br>
The figures and the explanation related thereto are only intended to illustrate the present invention. The method of the invention may vary in its details within the scope of the attached claims.<br>
