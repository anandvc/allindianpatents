				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to chemical processes for making compounds useful in the treatment of various medical disorders; such uses include but are not limited to uses as antifibrillatory and antiarrhythmic agents. The processes of this invention are useful for making l,3-disubstituted-4-oxocyclic ureas, particularly 1-[[[5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2-furanyl]methylene]amino]-3-[4-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl)butyl]-2,4-imidazolidinedione and salts thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for making l,3-disubstituted-4-oxocyclic ureas, particularly l-[[[5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2-furanyl]methylene]amino]-3-[4-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl)butyl]-2,4-imidazolidinedione or salts thereof, where the end product is obtained in pure form and high yield.<br>
l-[[[5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-2-furanyl]methylene]amino]-3-[4-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl)butyl]-2,4-imidazoIidinedione dihydrochloride (Azimilide) is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,462,940 (1995) to Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; said disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. Two general methods are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,462,940 issued to Yu et al October 31, 1995 for this type of compound. Each describes a series of reactions which involve isolation of three to five intermediate compounds. The disadvantages of both methods are the use of highly flammable and moisture sensitive sodium hydride, potentially explosive DMF/sodium hydride mixtures, excessive solvent volumes, sodium iodide, and several isolation steps. Added disadvantages of one method are: the use of an amine protecting group and the need for a hydrogenation reaction for its removal.<br>
It is apparent from the art that safer, higher yielding, more economical methods of preparing Azimilide would be advantageous. Particularly advantageous would be a reduction in the number of synthetic steps, increased reaction through¬put (higher reaction concentrations), removal of a hydrogenation reaction, elimination of an amine protecting group, higher overall yields, ability to process at large scale, and better final product isolations. It has been surprisingly discovered that the disadvantages of the literature syntheses of these compounds may be overcome by carrying out the sequence of reactions with a mild base such as potassium carbonate for alkylation, eliminating the use of sodium iodide to facilitate<br><br>
alkylation of the amine moiety, and using solvents such as methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to allow considerably higher reaction concentrations, increased product yield and purity.<br>
The subject of this patent is a process for making l,3-disubstituted-4-oxocyclic ureas whereby the l,3-disubstituted-4-oxocyclic ureas are conveniently synthesized in high yields, without isolation of intermediates, by first alkylating the corresponding l-substituted-4-oxocyclic urea with a carbon chain containing up to two leaving groups to form an adduct that is used without isolation to alkylate an amine to form a 1.3-disubstituted-4-oxocyclic urea that is finally reacted with an acid to form the desired salt. The present process allows for the preparation of 1,3-disubstituted-4-oxocyclic ureas under reaction conditions that eliminate the need for a hydrogenation step and the use of an amine protecting group. This process allows for improved yields and product purity, higher throughput, and provides additional synthetic simplicity for the preparation of these classes of molecules.<br>
In particular, the preferred processes of the present invention provide a new methodology that is especially suited for the scale-up and manufacture of Azimilide.<br>
