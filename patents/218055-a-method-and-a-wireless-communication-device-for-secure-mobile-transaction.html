				<td>The present invention relates to a method and a wireless communication device for secure mobile transaction.<br>
"Objects" are commonly passed from one computer to another. An object may be but is not limited to software applications, security codes, and data sets etc. The object may be passed via, a RF ink, an optical link, a wired network connection, through the internet, a serial or parallel port or internal bus transfers. When the object is passed from one device or portion to another, the integrity of the object is passed from one device or portion to another, the integrity of the object can vary. The integrity is based upon how well the source is trusted, i.e. the integrity of the object's source and all processes that operate upon it within the system, including how the object is communicated to the destination. If the source of the object is known and is trusted, the integrity of the object is very high but as it is transferred through the system its integrity may be reduced.<br>
The problem of maintaining an object's integrity is more difficult when<br>
the destination is a mobile device because it is not possible to predict<br>
the path the object will take as it moves through the system. More<br>
specifically, with the advent of wireless communications including the<br>
wireless internet and electronic commerce (eCommerce), in a system<br>
that does not have protection mechanisms, the integrity of the object, as<br>
it is passed over the air, through RF or light transmission, is reduced<br>
even further than with traditional wired connections. This is because<br>
the<br>
transmissions are susceptible to propagation effects and can be more readily intercepted out of the air than over a wired connection and potentially manipulated by adverse users.<br>
Methods traditionally used in wired networks for securing transactions, or the passing of objects from one computer to another are data encryption such as secret key encryption, public key encryption, and authentication through certificates and signatures. For example, a trusted high integrity source is required to sign an object with the secret key of a public key / secret key pair before releasing it to all of the devices in the system. In addition, the public key called the "root" public key is also distributed to all the devices in the system. Possessing the root public key gives each device the ability to check the integrity of any object it receives by processing the signature with the root public key. A valid signature identifies the source of the object as the owner of the secret key (a trusted source with high integrity) and indicates that none of the system processes have altered the object's integrity. This method has been shown to be effective in presently deployed systems but is dependent on the assumption that a high integrity process was used to initially install the root public key in the device.<br>
Incorporating additional functionality into wireless devices has created a need for additional security than that used traditionally in wireless devices. Current generations of mobile devices have used root public keys as a means for securing transactions or the passing of objects in the system. Even though the cryptographic process provides a high level of assurances about the signature of an object, there is no assurance that the object's integrity is any greater than the integrity of the process the initially installed the root public key. If, for example,<br>
the root public key was downloaded from an internet website, it has no more assurance of integrity than the website it was obtained from. Furthermore, any object's signature processed by the same root public key has no more assurance of integrity than that of the same website. This is unacceptable. Higher levels of security are becoming necessary as businesses provide services through mCommerce to exploit the new wireless generation. Current security methods used in wired networks such as the Internet do not provide adequate protection. That would leave the mCommerce vulnerable to attacks.<br>
WAP and other browser enabled protocols provide the means to perform secure mobile ecommerce transactions (such as mobile banking) but rely on unspecified secure processes to install the root public keys used during a secure transaction. Mobile banking applications give the user the ability to do their banking anywhere within a wireless domain. It is highly desirable to incorporate these features into wireless devices. It also requires the device to carry out high assurance processes such as validating the identity and source of the incoming information and reliably identifying the device to the system. The integrity of these processes is directly related to the integrity of the process that was used to install the root public key upon which they depend. Current systems cannot provide this level of assurance.<br>
Currently, high assurance methods for installing root public key have been infeasible with respect to the development and manufacture of mobile devices. They lack the flexibility needed for the fast paced development cycle and high volume manufacturing. Flexibility in developing, programming and manufacturing mobile devices is a necessary feature of any feasible security process. At the same time, the integrity of the process cannot be lowered for the<br>
sake of flexibility. Current systems and methods do not meet both the device development flexibility requirements and the high integrity security requirements.<br>
Accordingly, a system is needed to improve the assurance of secure wireless transactions yet maintain flexible product development and manufacturing. Providing a means for secure transactions over mobile devices is necessary to allow such transactions as electronic banking, electronic commerce but at the same time providing flexible means for developing, upgrading and maintaining the electronic wireless devices is necessary.<br>
Accordingly,  there  is  provided  a wireless  communication  device  for secure mobile transaction.<br>
a microprocessor;<br>
a non-reprogrammable ROM coupled to said microprocessor;<br>
a cryptographic program segment hard coded into said non<br>
reprogrammable ROM;<br>

An improved system and method is described for establishing a high<br>
integrity secure transaction over a wireless connection. The system<br>
includes a public key embedded within the tamper resistant media of<br>
non-reprogrammable Read Only Memory (ROM) by a first trusted path<br>
within an electronic device. The system then requires objects which are<br>
passed through a discrete second path to the electronic device to be<br>
authenticated by the super root public key during the boot process of<br>
the electronic device. Because the object is<br>
authenticated by a trusted source, the object will be considered trusted and allowed to reside on the device. Those skilled in the art will recognize the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) and authentication processes that the present invention makes use of. The PKI can be any of a number of systems in use today. This invention does not provide a PKI but rather provides the means for high assurance that the security and integrity of the PKI processes in the mobile wireless device are at the highest level offered by the PKI.<br>
In FIG. I, a central authority or certificate authority (CA) 102 is shown and the CA generates a public key 104 and a secret key 106, as a public key secret key pair. The public key 104 compliments the secret key 106 in a manner such that data encrypted by the public key 104 can only be decrypted with the secret key 106 and vice versa. The public key 104 and the secret key 106 may both be used for encrypting and decrypting as well as signing authentication certificates. In one embodiment, the CA 102, also functions as the key management authority storing and protecting the secret key 106 and the public key 104.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the public key 104 is signed with the secret key 106 to form the super root public key 108. The public key!04 does not need to be signed by the secret key, however when it is, this ensures that the public key is not tampered with during the 1C fabrication process.<br>
The super root public key 108 is sent to the Integrated Circuit (1C) fabrication facility as part of the Read Only Memory (ROM) mask data 113 via a high integrity first path 128. The ROM mask data 113 is a small part of the total database used in the fabrication of a specific 1C. A typical configuration of the 1C and other supporting components that might be found in a wireless communication device 116 is shown in Figure 2. Here, a block diagram of a<br>
processing unit 202 is part of a cellular radiotelephone. In one embodiment, the 1C that contains the ROM mask data 113 is the main processing unit (MPU) 202, available from Motorola Inc, is for carrying out network transactions when installed in the wireless communication devices 116.<br>
The MPU 202 of FIG. 2 has a central processing unit 204, an internal non-reprogrammable read only memory (ROM) 114 and an internal random access memory (RAM) 206. External flash memory 208, external RAM-210 and external ROM 212 are also coupled to the MPU 202 through a bus 214. As a result of the masking process the public key 104 or super root public key 108 is hard coded into the non-reprogrammable ROM 114. As a result of this process, the path normally used to route 1C fabrication data to the 1C fabrication facility has the same high integrity as the first path 128 from the CA 102 to the non-reprogrammable ROM 114 in the mobile device's 116 MPU 202. This 1C fabrication path also has a high assurance of integrity because of the proprietary nature and potential value of the 1C fabrication data.<br>
In addition to the super root public key 108 the ROM mask data also contains the high assurance boot process (HABP) code that is always the first code to be executed when power is applied to the MPU 202, i.e. during the boot-up process. The memory allocation between the non-reprogrammable ROM 114, RAM 206 and external flash memory 208 in FIG. 3 shows that the plurality of code segments comprise, cryptographic algorithms or cryptographic program segments 304 implemented by a command file parser and interpreter and small routines, initialization and configuration routines, several self test routines, main logic control loop, several command file validation routines. The cryptographic program segment is a routine or program that calls upon the super root public<br>
key 108 also stored in the ROM for authenticating, encrypting or decrypting other objects or program segments present on the device.<br>
In FIG. 1, the non-reprogrammable ROM, which comprises the super root public key 108 and the cryptographic program segment 304, installed into a device 116, such as a wireless communication device 116 of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, during the device assembly process. A program sequence called the Command Sequence File (CSF) 118 is also stored in the device during the assembly process. This program sequence is not stored in the ROM but in some form of re-writable memory in the device, for example the flash memory 208. The CSF 118 can therefore be replaced or modified at a later time as objects are added to or deleted from the device. The CSF 118 is executed as part of the boot process, in addition to execution of device initialization steps of the wireless communication device. Prior to installation into the wireless communication device 116, the CSF 118 is signed by the super root public key 108 such that it becomes a certified program sequence 119. Then, during the boot up process the certified program sequence 119 is authenticated by the super root public key 108 and cryptographic program sequence 304 which again are both stored in the ROM. If the certified program sequence 119 successfully executes, the wireless communication device enters a normal operation mode and the certified program segment executes. If the certified program sequence fails execution or is not authentic, the wireless communication device enters an alternate mode of operation.<br>
This alternate mode can be a plethora of modes depending on the given circumstances, for example the device 116 may display a message that an error has occurred and that the manufacture should be contacted or the device 116<br>
may also display troubleshooting tips. The alternate mode may also be to notify the service provider that the device 116 has an invalid CSF and that the device may have been tampered with. The device 116 may also enter an emergency only mode where the user can now only make calls to 911 and must take the device 116 into the service provider to have the issue resolved.<br>
Execution of the authenticated certified program segment 119, comprises executing other sub routines or program segments that authenticate other program segments stored in the wireless communication device. Because the certified program segment 119 is authenticated by the super root public key, there is high assurance that other program segments executed by the certified program segment 119 are authentic as well as the trust chain flows from the super root public key.<br>
For example, code in the MPU 202 ROM 114, including the cryptographic program segment 304, and the CSF 119 directs the use of the super root public key 108 to authenticate other objects in the device 116. Other objects may include but are not limited to software segments, executable software segments, public keys, secret keys, data files, and cryptographic program segments.<br>
In general a third party who desires to have its object reside on the device 116 will need to have the object signed for authentication purposes prior to delivery to the device 116. To this end, once the public key secret key pair have been generated by the CA 102, and the super root public key 108 embedded in the non-reprogrammable ROM 114 and incorporated into a wireless device 116, objects to be delivered to the wireless device must be signed by the CA 102 to ensure their authenticity once installed on the device 116. Signing the object by the private key 106 at the CA 102 generates a certificate 120, as shown in Figure<br>
8/. The certificate is attached to the object when it is sent to the wireless communication device 116. At the device 116, the object and certificate 120 are authenticated with the super root public key 108. If the certificate is authentic, then the object can be used on the device 116.<br>
An example of a third party in this instance, may be an institution wishing to provide an object via the internet to the wireless device. Many third party providers will wish to download data in mCommerce transactions. Another third party may be the service provider or carrier providing service to the device who also wishes to upgrade software in the device or add any other object to enhance features of the device, otherwise known as terminal management. The nature of these transactions requires that the object be authenticatable and traceable back to the trusted source.<br>
An element of the system is that the object is communicated to the device via a completely separate path from that of the super root public key 108. The first path and the second path may be the same media (i.e. floppy disk, wired transmission, wireless transmission, however they cannot be apart of the same transaction so as to create the independent paths. The second path can be any typical communication path through the network to the mobile device. The path does not need to be of high integrity because any change in the objects integrity as it moves through the network to the device will be detected when the object is processed by the super root public key<br>
In FIG. 1, the object is shown taking the second path 132. For illustrative purposes, the second path further comprises a first portion 134, a second portion 136 and a third portion 138. Before the object can be sent to the wireless device 116, the third party must send the object through the first portion 134 of the<br>
second path 132, to the CA 102. At the CA 102, the object is signed with the secret key 106. In doing this, the third party is said to "registering" with the CA and this process is know as "Registration". The first portion of the second path can be a person to person transaction, a dedicated wired link, transported by recordable media such as floppy disk, CD ROM, or some form of removable portable media. The object must also contain an identification code (ID field) that clearly identifies the source of the object and a checksum over all of the fields in the object. The ID field binds the third party's public key to the third party's identifier. The certificate "guarantees" the identity of the third party and "certifies" authenticity of their public key.<br>
The signed object is returned from the CA 102 to the third party 124 via a second portion 136 of the second path. This can be the same type of communication as the first portion 134 or another means as described above may be used. Once the signed object is received at the third party 124, it can be communicated to the wireless device. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the object is communicated to the wireless device 116 from the third party 124 via a carrier 126 through a third portion 138 of the second path 132. If the third party 124 is the carrier 126 the object is sent directly to the wireless communication device 116. Once the object is received at the wireless device 116, both the object and the super root public key 108 reside on the wireless communication device via two completely autonomous paths; the first high integrity path 128 and the second, a typical network path 132. This system is designed to accommodate the flexibility of origination of the objects when sent to the wireless communication device, i.e. the second path 132 in this case, and<br>
this path by nature is not a high integrity path and therefore requires the certification prior to transmission to the wireless communication-device.<br>
During the boot process of the device, the CSF 118 is executed and authenticates every signed object stored in the device received in the second path, using the super root public key. If every object is authentic, then the device 116 will complete the boot process and enter an operation mode. If any object is not authentic, the device 116 will not begin normal operations and will go into an alternate operation mode. This alternate mode may be shutting down the device, displaying a message to call the service provider or the third party or a number of other possible events.<br>
Once the wireless communication device 116 receives an object, the object can not be activated until the object is authenticated. The authentication process begins when power is applied to the 1C and the initialization code in the ROM is activated and establishes full control of the MPU as shown in Figure 4. The ROM code always executes the same specific sequence of actions upon every boot up.<br>
Figure 5 shows the main control loop sequence. First the main control loop looks for the CSF pointer and uses it to locate the command CSF 119 itself. It loads the CSF 119, along with the CSF Signature, into the RAM-206 internal to the MPU 202. The main control loop code then calls several of the cryptographic library routines contained in the ROM to establish the authenticity and integrity of the CSF 119. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the CSF Signature is a checksum of the CSF 119 called a HASH that is signed with the super root Secret Key 108. The CSF 119 then performs the decryption of the first object using the super root public key 108. The result of processing the first object with the super root public key 108 is a decrypted answer or result. The<br>
result is verified by checking the checksum that is included in the encrypted object. If the object is authentic the CSF 119 moves on to the next object and follows the same procedure of authenticating the second object with the super root public key 108. This process is carried out until all objects are verified. If the object / public key is not authentic the device 116 can enter an alternative mode, signal the user, or disable the device 116. The alternative mode may be that the object is re-downloaded to the device, or the device 116 enters an emergency use only mode such that the user can only call 911 for example. The device 116 may also enter a terminal management mode allowing the carrier to control the device 116 and troubleshoot the issue. The user may be signaled to call a number, or the number called automatically in the case of a cellular radiotelephone, such as the carrier or the third party who has generated the object in question for further troubleshooting.<br>
Each, time a new object is downloaded to the device 116, a new CFS 119 must be stored in the device 116 as well. The CFS 119 must include the object that is to be verified upon booting of the device 116. The CFS 119 may also include an ID number that matches the ID number in the device 116 such as an electronic serial number (ESN) of a cellular radio telephone, such that if the CFS 119 is stored on a device 116 with a different ESN, the device 116 can enter an alternate mode of operation. In this case the device 116 could send a notification to the carrier that the CFS 119 ID does not match the device ID and the device!16 could be interrogated for fraud or other misuse such as cloning.<br>
In the development phase of the wireless device, the development group may act as the third party. Development requires full access to the device 116. Objects stored on the device 116 would be development data, executables or<br>
another key that grants complete access to the wireless device for development purposes or the like. Development is given a CFS 119 to download to the device 116 that gives full access. Special development ROMs may also be installed in the development device 116 during the development process. In the special development ROM would have a unique ID that matches the ID in the development CFS 119. Because only a certain number of ROMs with the unique development ID would be developed, devices with the special development ROM would not be sold in commerce. This advantageously allows flexibility in the development process while marinating a system that has a high security level.<br>
The third party may also be a field testing unit who needs to upgrade software in the device during testing. The field testing unit would be given a CFS 119 to be downloaded into the device 116 that gives either full access to the device 116 or a field testing access level of security.<br>
Objects sent to the device 116 by the carrier, by request by the user, through a banking request, a shopping request such as any mCommerce transaction in general, gaming, video streaming or the like.<br>
While the invention has been described in detail above, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments as described. It is evident that those skilled in the art may now make numerous uses, modifications of, and departures from the specific embodiments described herein without departing from the inventive concepts.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
