COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION"<br>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM P.L.C., a British company, of New Horizons Court, Brentford, Middlesex TW8 9EP, United Kingdom.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
This invention relates to a novel composition, in particular to a modified release. composition and its use in medicine, especially its use for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, preferably Type 2 diabetes, and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus. Alpha glucosidase inhibitor antihyperglycaemic agents (or alpha giucosidase inhibitors) and biguanide antihyperglycaemic agents (or biguanidcs) are commonly used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Acarbose, voglibose, emiglitate and miglitol are examples of alpha glucosidase inhibitors. 1,1 - Dimethylbiguanidine (or metformin) is a particular example of a biguanide.<br>
Insulin secretagogues are compounds that promote increased secretion of insulin     by the pancreatic beta cells. The sulphonylureas are well known examples of insulin.     secretagogues. The sulphonylureas act as hypoglycaemic agents and are used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. Examples of sulphonylureas include glibenclamide (or glyburide), glipizide, gliclazide, glimepiride, tolazamide and tolbutamide.<br>
European Patent Application, Publication Number 0,306,228 relates to certain  hiazolidinedione derivatives disclosed as having antihyperglycaemic and hypolipidaemic activity. One particular thiazolidinedione disclosed in EP 0306228 is 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyI)amino)ethoxy]benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione (hereinafter Compound (I)}. WO94/05659 discloses .certain salts of Compound (I) including the maleate salt at     example 1 thereof.<br>
Compound (I) is an example of a class of antihyperglycaemic agents known as insulin sensitisers'. In particular Compound (I) is a thiazolidinedione insulin sensitiser.<br>
European Patent Applications, Publication Numbers: 0008203, 0139421, 0032128,0428312, 0489663, 0155845, 0257781, 0208420, 0177353, 0319189, 0332331,    0332332,0528734, 0508740; International Patent Application, Publication Numbers 92/18501, 93/02079, 93/22445 and United States Patent Numbers 5104888 and 5478852, also disclose certain thiazolidinedione insulin sensitisers.<br>
Another series of compounds generally recognised as having insulin sensitiser activity are those typified by the compounds disclosed in International Patent Applications, Publication Numbers W093/21166 and WO94/01420. These compounds are herein referred to as 'acyclic insulin sensitisers'. Other examples of acyclic insulin sensitisers are those disclosed in United States Patent Number 5232945 and International Patent Applications, Publication Numbers WO92/03425 and W091/19702.<br>
Examples of other insulin sensitisers are those disclosed in European Patent Application, Publication Number 0533933, Japanese Patent Application Publication Number 05271204 and United States Patent Number 5264451.<br>
The above mentioned publications are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
It is now indicated that certain modified release pharmaceutical compositions allow administration of a single daily dose of Compound (I) and another antidiabetic agent, such as an alpha glucosidase inhibitor, a biguanide or an insulin secretagogue, to provide an advantageous delivery of drug for maintaining effective glycaemic control with no observed adverse side effects. Such modified release is therefore considered to be particularly useful for the delivery of insulin sensitisers in combination with other antidiabetic agents for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially Type 2 diabetes and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, suitable for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially Type 2 diabetes and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus in a mammal, such as a human, which composition comprises: an insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I), and another antidiabetic agent, such as an alpha glucosidase inhibitor, a biguanide or an insulin secretagogue, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor, wherein the composition is arranged to provide a modified release of at least one of the insulin sensitiser and the other antidiabetic agent.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a modified release pharmaceutical composition, suitable for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially Type 2 diabetes and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus in a mammal, such as a human, which composition comprises: an insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I), and another antidiabetic agent, such as an alpha glucosidase inhibitor, a biguanide or an insulin secretagogue, and a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable carrier therefor, wherein the carrier is arranged to provide a modified release of at least one of the insulin sensitiser and the other antidiabetic agent<br>
Suitably, the release of both the insulin sensitiser and the other antidiabetic agent is modified.<br>
However, it is envisaged that the release of only the insulin sensitiser is modified. It is also envisaged that the release of only the other antidiabetic agent is modified. The remaining active agent would of course be subject to non-modified release.<br>
Suitably, the modified release is delayed, pulsed or sustained release.<br>
In one aspect the modified release is a delayed release.<br>
Delayed release is conveniently obtained by use of a gastric resistant formulation such as an enteric formulation, such as a tablet coated with a gastric resistant polymer, for example Eudragit L100-55. Other gastric resistant polymers include methacrylates, cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phtahlate, in particular, Aquateric, Sureteric, HPMCP-HP-55S.<br>
The enteric coated tablet may be a single layer tablet, where the active agents are admixed prior to compression into tablet form, or a multi-layer tablet, such as a bi-or tri-layer tablet, wherein each active agent is present in a discrete layer within the compressed<br><br>
tablet form. The discrete table layers can be arranged as required to provide modified or non-modified release of each active agent.<br>
In a further aspect the modified release is a sustained release, for example providing effective release of active agents over a time period of up to 26 hours, typically in the range of 4 to 24 hours.<br>
Sustained release is typically provided by use of a sustained release matrix, usually in tablet form, such as disintegrating, non-disintegrating or eroding matrices.<br>
Sustained release is suitably obtained by use of a non disintegrating matrix tablet formulation, for example by incorporating Eudragit RS into the tablet. Alternative non disintegrating matrix tablet formulations are provided by incorporating methacrylates, cellulose acetates, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phtahlate, in particular Eudragit L and RL, Carbopol 971P, HPMCP-HP-55S into the tablet.<br>
Sustained release is further obtained by use of a disintegrating matrix tablet formulation, for example by incorporating methacrylates, methylcellulose, in particular Eudragit L, Methocel K4M into the tablet.<br>
Sustained release can also be achieved by using a semi-permeable membrane coated tablet for example by applying methacrylates, ethylcellulose, cellulose acetate, in particular Eudragit RS, Surelease to the tablet.<br>
Sustained release can also be achieved by using a multi layer tablet, where each active ingredient is formulated together or as a separate layer, for example as a matrix tablet, with the other layers providing further control for sustained release of either one or both active agents.<br>
In yet a further aspect the modified release is a pulsed release, for example providing up to 4, for example 2, pulses of active agent per 24 hours.<br>
One form of pulsed release is a combination of non-modified release of active agent and delayed release.<br>
Suitable modified release includes controlled release. The composition of the invention also envisages a combination of pulsed, delayed and/or sustained release for each of the active agents, thereby enabling for example the release of the reagents at different times. For example, where the composition comprises an insulin sensitiser and a biguanide, such as metformin, the composition can be arranged to release the metformin overnight.<br>
A suitable alpha glucosidase inhibitor is acarbose.<br>
Other suitable alpha glucosidase inhibitors are emiglitate and miglitol. A further suitable alpha glucosidase inhibitor is voglibose.<br>
Suitable biguanides include metformin, buformin or phenformin, especially metformin.<br>
Suitable insulin secretagogues include sulphonylureas.<br><br><br>
Suitable sulphonylureas include glibenclamide, glipizide, gliclazide, glimepiri. tolazamide and tolbutamide. Further sulphonylureas include acetohexamide, carbutamide, chlorpropamide, glibomuride, gliquidone, glisentide, glisolamide, glisoxepide, glyclopyamide and glycylamide. Also included is the sulphonylurea glipentide.<br>
Further suitable insulin secretagogues include repaglinide. An additional insul: secretagogue is nateglinide.<br>
A preferred thiazolidinedione insulin sensitiser is Compound (I). Other suitable thiazolidinedione insulin sensitisers include (+) -5-[[4-[(3,4-dihydro-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2H-l-ben2opyran-2-yl)methoxy3phenyl]methyl]-2,4-thiazolidinedione (or troglitazone), 5-[4-[(l-methylcyclohexyI)methoxy]benzyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (or ciglitazone), 5-[4-t2-(5-ethylpyridin-2-yl)ethoxy]benzyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (or pioglitazone) or 5-[(2-benzyI-2,3-dihydrobenzopyran)-5-ylmethyl)thiazolidine-2,4-dione (or englitazone).<br>
A particular thiazolidinedione insulin sensitiser is 5-t4-[2-(5-ethylpyridin-2-yl)ethoxy]benzyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione (or pioglitazone).<br>
A particular thiazolidinedione insulin sensitiser is (+) -5-[[4-[(3,4-dihydro-6-hydroxy-2,7,8-tetramethyl-2H-l-benzopyran-2-yl)methoxy]phenyI]methyl3-2,4-thiazolidinedione (or troglitazone).<br>

The compounds mentioned herein may contain one or more chiral carbon atoms and hence can exist in two or more stereoisomeric forms, all of which are encompassed by the invention either as individual isomers or as mixtures of isomers, including racemates.<br>
It will be understood that the insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I) and the other antidiabetic agent are in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, including pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and solvates thereof, as appropriate to the relevant pharmaceutically active agent chosen. In certain instances herein the names used for the antidiabetic agent may relate to a particular pharmaceutical form of the relevant active agent: It will be understood that all<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the active agents per se arc encompassed by this invention.<br>
Suitable phannaceutically acceptable forms of the insulin sensitiser and other antidiabetic agent depend upon the particular agent used but included are known pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the particular agent chosen. Such derivatives are found or are referred to in standard reference texts such as the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein) and the above mentioned publications. For example, a paiticular form of metformin is metformin hydrochloride, a particular form of repaglinide is a benzoic acid salt form and a particular form of tolbutamide is a sodium salt form.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable forms of Compound (I) include those described in EP 0306228 and WO94/05659, especially pharmaceutically acceptable salted or solvated forms. A preferred phannaceutically acceptable salt form of Compound (I) is a maleate. A preferred pharmaceutically acceptable solvated form of Compound (I) is a hydrate. A preferred form of pioglitazone is as the hydrochloride salt.<br>
The insulin sensitiser or the alpha glucosidase inhibitor antihyperglycaemic agent of choice is prepared according to known methods, such methods are found or are referred to in standard reference texts, such as the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) (for example see me 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein) or as described in the above mentioned publications.<br>
Compound (I) or, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, may be prepared using known methods, for example those disclosed in EP 0306228 and WO94/05659. The disclosures of EP 0306228 and WO94/05659 are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When used herein the term 'conditions associated with diabetes' includes those conditions associated with the pre-diabetic state, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus itself and complications associated with diabetes mellitus.<br>
When used herein the term 'conditions associated with the pre-diabetic state' includes conditions such as insulin resistance, including hereditary insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and hyperinsuiinaemia.<br>
Conditions associated with diabetes mellitus itself include hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, including acquired insulin resistance and obesity. Further conditions associated with diabetes mellitus itself include hypertension and cardiovascular disease, especially atherosclerosis and conditions associated with insulin resistance. Conditions<br><br><br>
associated with insulin resistance include polycystic ovarian syndrome and steroid induced insulin resistance and gestational diabetes.<br>
Complications associated with diabetes mellitus' includes renal disease, especially renal disease associated with Type 2 diabetes, neuropathy and retinopathy.<br>
Renal diseases associated with Type 2 diabetes include nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and end stage renal disease.<br>
As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable' embraces both human and veterinary use: for example the term pharmaceutically acceptable'embraces a veterinarily acceptable compound.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, unless other wise stated, when reference is made herein to scalar amounts, including mg amounts, of the active compound such as Compound (I), in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, the scalar amount referred to is made in respect of the active compound per se: For example 2 mg of Compound (I) in the form of the maleate salt is that amount of maleate salt which provides 2 mg of Compound (I).<br>
Diabetes mellitus is preferably Type 2 diabetes. Glycaemic control may be characterised using conventional methods, for example by measurement of a typically used index of glycaemic control such as fasting plasma glucose or glycosylated haemoglobin (Hb Alc). Such indices are determined using standard methodology, for example those described in: Tuescher A, Richterich, P., Schweiz. med. Wschr. 101 (1971), 345 and 390 and Frank P., Monitoring the Diabetic Patent with Glycosolated Hemoglobin Measurements', Clinical Products 1988.<br>
In a preferred aspect, the dosage level of each of the active agents when used in accordance with the treatment of the invention will be less than would have been required from a purely additive effect upon glycaemic control.<br>
There is also an indication that the treatment of the invention will effect an improvement, relative to the non-modified release of the individual agents, in the levels of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), leptin and scrum lipids including total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol including improvements in the ratios thereof, in particular an improvement in serum lipids including total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol including improvements in the ratios thereof.<br>
Usually the compositions are adapted for oral administration. However, they may be adapted for other modes of administration, for example parenteral administration, sublingual or transdermal administration.<br>
In a further aspect the invention also provides a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition, suitably for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially Type 2 diabetes and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus in a mammal, such as a<br><br><br><br>
human, which composition comprises an insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I), and another antidiabetic agent, such as an alpha glucosidase inhibitor, a biguanide or an insulin secretagogue, and a phannaceutically acceptable carrier therefor, which process comprises formulating the insulin sensitiser, the other antidiabetic agent and the phannaceutically acceptable carrier so as to enable a modified release of at least one of the insulin sensitiser and the other antidiabetic agent.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a modified release pharmaceutical composition, suitably for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially Type 2 diabetes and conditions associated with diabetes mellitus in a mammal, such as a human, which composition comprises an insulin sensitiser, such as Compound (I) and another antidiabetic agent, such as an alpha glucosidase inhibitor, a biguanide or an insulin secretagogue and a phannaceutically acceptable carrier therefor, which process comprises formulating the insulin sensitiser, the other antidiabetic agent and the phannaceutically acceptable carrier so as to enable a modified release of at least one of the insulin sensitiser and the other antidiabetic agent.<br>
The compositions are formulated to provide the modified release of active agents according to the appropriate methods required, for example those disclosed in Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, Editor Joe R Robinson, Volume 7, published by Marcel Dekker under the title Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences, Controlled Drug Delivery, 2nd Edition' edited by Joe Robinson and Vince Lee, Marcel Dekker, 1987 and "Drug Delivery to the Gastrointestinal Tract'Editors: J G Hardy, S S. Davis and C G Wilson also with reference to texts such as the British and US Pharmacopoeias, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.), Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia (London, The Pharmaceutical Press) (for example see the 31st Edition page 341 and pages cited therein) and Harry's Cosmeticology (Leonard Hill Books),<br>
