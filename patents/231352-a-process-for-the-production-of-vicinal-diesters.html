				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION Or ESTERS FROM EPOXIDES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to processes for the production vicinal diesters.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Various silicone containing monomers have found utility as starting materials in<br>
the production of medical devices, such as ophthalmic devices and particularly, soft<br>
contact lenses having improved permeability to oxygen. One class of suitable monomers<br>
includes Iris and bis(trimethylsilyloxy)silylalkylglycerol methacrylates ("SiAGMA").<br>
i<br>
During the synthesis of SiAGMA certain diesler acrylate impurtics are also generated.<br>
The diester acrylates or free radical reactive difunctional groups act as crosslinkers<br>
during the polymerization of the SiAGMAs with other polymer forming components.<br>
Accordingly, the concentration of the diester acrylates must be controlled to ensure that<br>
the mechanical properties of the resulting medical device do not vary to an unacceptable<br>
degree.<br>
Classical methods for preparing 1,2-diesters involve the treatment of 1,2-diols<br>
with acid chlorides or anhydrides in the presence of a base. However, functional groups<br>
such as trimelhylsilyl ethers are sensitive to such conditions and additional purification is<br>
required to obtain the desired product(s) in high purity. One method for the production<br>
of vicinal diesters use an amine to catalyze the nucleophilic opening of the epoxide in the<br>
presence of an anhydride and methacrylic acid to form a partially acylated mixture of<br>
compounds containing a vicinal methacrylate. The difunctional free radical impurities<br>
that are made during the course of producing the monofunctional free radical reactive<br>
monomer have to be controlled using either a different synthetic pathway or the use of<br>
various purification steps. The free radical reactive functional groups in the monomeric<br>
materials are made and then rely heavily on various modes of post synthesis purification<br>
methodology.<br>
Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for a process which can produce<br>
vicinal diesters in high yield and purity.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process comprising the steps of reacting, in the<br>
presence of a epoxide opening catalyst, a substituted epoxide, and preferably a silicone<br>
containing substituted epoxide with at least one carboxylic acid and at least one<br>
protecting agent to form a vicinal dialkyl ester or a vicinal disilyl ester. More<br>
specifically, the present invention relates to a process comprising the steps of reacting a<br>
substituted epoxide with at least one epoxide opening catalyst, at least one carboxylic<br>
acid, at least one protecting agent and at least one inhibitor at a temperature above about<br>
60°C for at least about 4 hours to form a compound of Formula VI or VII:<br><br>
wherein R2 is any group which reacts more slowly with an oxygen containing<br>
nuclueophile as compared to said epoxide, R2 is a straight or branched alkyl and alkenyl<br>
groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and R6 is a residue of said protecting group which is<br>
capable of forming an ester or ether linkage. The vicinal dialkyl ester or a vicinal disilyl<br>
ester which are formed by the process of the present invention are useful as<br>
polymerization components for biomedical devices, and particularly for ophthalmic<br>
devices such as contact lenses.<br><br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Suitable substituted epoxides include those of Formula I, below:<br><br>
Wherein R1 is any substituent which reacts more slowly with an oxygen containing<br>
nuclueophile as compared to the epoxide moiety. Preferred substituted epoxides include<br>
those shown in Formula II<br><br>
Wherein R2 is any group which reacts more slowly with an oxygen containing<br>
nuclueophile as compared to the epoxide moiety. Examples of suitable R2 groups include<br>
esters, amides, substituted and unsubstituted alkyls, siloxanes, ethers and the like.<br>
Specific, non-limiting examples include C1 to 3 alkyls substituted with at least one Si<br>
containing substituent and preferably at least one silicone linkage. Specific examples of<br>
suitable substituted epoxides include those of formula lll<br><br>
Wherein R3 and R4 are independently selected from alkyl groups having 1 to 3 carbon<br>
atoms, n is 1 to 3 and x is 0 to 3. Even more specifically, the substituted epoxide may be<br>
glycidoxypropyl heptamethyltrisiloxane.<br>
Epoxides may be formed in a number of ways including, but not limited to,<br>
oxidation of alkenes with peroxyacids, formation by an intramolecular SN2 reaction in<br>
which there is a trans halohydrin moiety, addition of a nucleophilic oxidizing agent (such<br>
as a basic solution of hydrogen peroxide) to an .-unsaturated carbonyl compound, and<br>
the reaction of a sulfonium ylide with a carbonyl compound. Alternatively, epoxides<br><br>
substituted with a Si containing group may be prepared by the hydrosilylation of an<br>
already formed epoxide containing an allyl functionality. Such methods are well known<br>
to those skilled in the art and this list of synthetic routes to epoxides and epoxides<br>
substituted with a Si containing group, in no way limits the scope of this invention to<br>
these preparations.<br>
According to the process of the present invention the substituted epoxide is<br>
reacted with at least one soluble carboxylate salt, R5CO2X, at least one carboxylic acid<br>
R5CO2H and at least protecting agent which can block reaction of free radical reactive<br>
species with a hydroxyl group. Suitable protecting agents include anhydrides,<br>
trimethylsilylchloride, allyl halide and the like. Anhydrides are preferred protecting<br>
agents. Suitable anhydrides include those having the formula R5CO2OCR5. R5 may be<br>
the same or different, and may be selected from straight or branched alkyl and alkenyl<br>
groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Preferably R5 is selected from alkenyl groups<br>
having 1-5 carbon atoms, and more preferably vinyl, styryl, allyl. Preferably R5 is the<br>
same in the carboxylate salt, carboxylic acid and protecting agents.<br>
The protecting agent reacts with the hydroxyl group after the carboxylate salt has<br>
opened the oxirane ring, keeping the metal alkoxide group from displacing the carboxy<br>
group from the carboxylic acid, and limits the OH reaction with other reactive species<br>
present in the reaction mixture. Thus, the use of a protecting agent allows for the<br>
production of the desired product in purities in excess of 80%, prior to any purification.<br>
The epoxide opening catalyst used in the first step of the present invention may be<br>
any catalyst which is known in the art to open the epoxide ring. Suitable epoxide<br>
opening catalysts include Lewis acids, Lewis bases, Bronsted acids and porphyrin<br>
complexes, combinations thereof and the like. A preferred class of epoxide opening<br>
catalysts include carboxylate salts. For the carboxylate salt, suitable cations include<br>
alkali metals, such as Li, Na, K and ammonium. Preferably said cation is Li or Na, and<br>
preferred carboxylate salts include Li methacrylate and Na methacrylate. The epoxide<br>
opening catalyst should be soluble in the selected reaction solvent and at that the selected<br>
reaction temperature. The epoxide opening catalyst is added in an amount sufficient to<br>
catalyze the reaction, and preferably in an amount up to about 0.5 equivalents, based upon<br>
the epoxide.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the carboxylic acid is methacrylic acid, the protecting<br>
agent is an anhydride and preferably methacrylic acid anhydride and the epoxide opening<br>
catalyst is an alkali metal methacrylate.<br>
The carboxylic acid in used in an amount between about 0.01 and about 0.2 molar<br>
equivalents and preferably between about 0.05 and about 0.15 about based upon the amount<br>
of epoxide.<br>
The protecting agent is used in a slight excess, preferably in an amount between<br>
about 1 and 1.5 molar equivalents and preferably between about 1 and about 1.1 molar<br>
equivalents based upon the amount of epoxide.<br>
The reaction mixture may also include an inhibitor. Any free radical inhibitor may<br>
be used and suitable non-limiting examples include MEHQ, BHT, phenothiazine,<br>
hydroquinoncs, mixtures thereof and the like. The initiator may be used in amounts<br>
between about 1 and about 1000 ppm, and more preferably between about 1 and about 750<br>
ppm.<br>
The carboxylic acid may be used in a slight excess as the solvent or any non-reactive<br>
solvent may be used. Suitable non-reactive solvents are those that do not contribute or<br>
detract from the desired reaction at the selected reaction conditions, and include, but are not<br>
limited to non-nucleophilic solvents such as DMF, benzene, THF, mixtures thereof and the<br>
like.<br>
The reaction is conducted at elevated temperatures, preferably greater than about<br>
60°C and more preferably between about 80°C and about 120°C.<br>
Suitable reaction times include at least about. 4 hours, preferably at least about six<br>
hours and more preferably between about 6 and about 15 hours. It will be appreciated by<br>
those of skill in the art the temperature and reaction time are inversely proportional, and that<br>
higher reaction temperatures may allow for decreased reaction times and vice versa. Also,<br>
other reaction conditions, which effect the reaction, such as catalyst concentration, may also<br>
i  be varied to vary the reaction time and temperature of the process of the present invention.<br>
The product of the reaction is a compound of Formula VI or VII, below:<br>
Formula VI<br><br><br>
wherein R2, R5 are as defined above and R is a residue of the protecting group which is<br>
capable of forming an ester or an ether linkage.<br>
In one embodiment the protecting agent is an anhydride and the product of the<br>
process of the present invention is a diester which contains siloxane moieties and has a<br>
purity of at least about 80%. The purity of the diester is further increased by treating a<br>
solution in hexanes with flash grade silica gel. The silica gel slurry is agitated (trituated) for<br>
a few hours and filtered to remove significant quantities of impurities that are more polar<br>
than the desired product. Alternatively, the purity of the vicinal diester may be increased by<br>
other purification such as supercritical fluid extraction.<br>
Thus, the process of the present invention provides a one-pot tandem chemical<br>
transformation where an epoxide is first opened by reaction with a carboxylate and the<br>
resulting alcohol is rapidly trapped by the anhydride 10 form the desired vicinal diester.<br>
Many of the side reactions that occur due to the presence of hydroxyl groups and silicone<br>
moieties in the reaction mixture are avoided because the hydroxyl groups in the reaction<br>
mixture are short lived.<br><br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following examples are included. These<br>
examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a method of<br>
practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable in contact lenses as well as other<br>
specialties may find other methods of practicing the invention. However, those methods<br>
are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.<br>
