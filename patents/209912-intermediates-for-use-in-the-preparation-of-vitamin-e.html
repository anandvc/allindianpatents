Step (a): Preparation of alpha - linallol<br>
24.7 ml of a 1.7 M solution of vinyl magnesium chloride in THF (42 mmols) was placed in a flask equipped with two necks, under argon. The solution was heated to 35Â°C, and 3.812g (30 mmol) of 6-methyl 6~heptene-2 - one was introduced drop by drop to the magnesium compound over a period of 75 minutes. The mixture was then poured on to a mixture of 20g of ice, 24 ml of water and 4 ml of 37% hydrochloric acid. The resulting organic phase was separated, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated. The yield was 4.563g (98%) and 95% purity.<br>
13<br><br>
5<br>
10<br>
15<br><br>
Step (b): Access to the chromane<br>
151 mg of trimethyl hydroquinone was dissolved, under argon, in 1 ml of ethyl acetate, and the solution was heated at 75Â°C. 16.24 mg of zinc chloride, 4 microliters of water, and 2 microliters of 37% hydrochloric acid were successively added. Alpha - linallol (154 mg) was added to the mixture in 30 mn. After 10 hours at 75Â°C, the alpha-linallol was consumed. 10 microlitres of 37% hydrochloric acid was added. Formation of the chromane was monitored on TLC plates. After 2 hours at 75Â°C, the mixture was cooled to 25Â°C, diluted with ether, washed by a normal solution of sodium hydroxyde, and with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The crude chromane, thus obtained, was diluted in 5 ml of triethyl amine, heated to reflux during five hours and cooled to 25 Â°C. 204 mg of acetic anhydride was then added, and the mixture was kept at 25Â°C 2 h under stirring. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum and the residue was chromatographed under silica gel. The desired acetylated chromane was isolated with a 60% yield (198 mg).<br>
Step (c) Access to the chromene<br><br>
20<br>
151 mg of trimethyl hydroquinone was dissolved under argon in 1 ml of ethyl<br>
acetate, and the solution was heated at 75Â°C. 16.24 mg of zinc chloride, 4<br>
microliters of water, and 2 microliters of 37% hydrochloric acid were successively<br>
added. Alpha - linallol (154 mg) was added to the mixture over a period of 30<br>
minutes. After 10 hours at 75Â°C, the mixture was cooled to 25Â°C, diluted with<br>
ether, washed by a normal solution of sodium hydroxyde, and with water, then<br>
dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The crude<br>
benzoquinone adduct, thus obtained, was diluted in 5 ml of triethyl amine, heated<br>
to reflux during five hours and cooled to 25Â°C. 204 mg of acetic anhydride were<br>
30	added, and the mixture was kept at 25Â°C for 2 hours under stirring. The mixture<br>
was concentrated under vacuum and the residue was chromatographed under silica gel. The desired acetylated chromene was isolated with a 50% yield (162 mg).<br>
14<br><br>
Step (d):<br>
1 mmol of compound produced in step (b) and 1 mmol of dimethyl octanal<br>
dimethyl   acetal   were   dissolved   under   inert   atmosphere   in   5   ml   of<br>
5	dichloromethane. The catalyst (5 % molar equivalents of scandium triflate or iron<br>
trichloride or ytterbium triflate) was added. The mixture was kept under stirring during 15 hours at ambient temperature. 3 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogeno carbonate was added. The organic phase was separated, dried over magnesium sulphate, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude desired product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluent : pentane / diethyl ether: 9 / 1 in volume).<br><br>
15<br>
25<br><br>
Step (e):<br>
1 mmol of compound produced in step (c) and 1 mmol of dimethyl octanal dimethyl acetal were dissolved under inert atmosphere in 5 ml of dichloromethane. The catalyst (5 % molar equivalents of scandium triflate or iron trichloride or ytterbium triflate) was added. The mixture was kept under stirring during 15 hours at ambient temperature. 3 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogeno carbonate was added. The organic phase was separated, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude desired product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluentpentane / diethyl ether: 9 /1 in volume).<br>
Step ff):<br>
1 mmol of the product formed in steps (e) and (d), along with the catalyst (palladium 5% on charcoal; 5% weight equivalents), were placed in an autoclave. Diethyl ether (5 ml) was added. The autoclave was purged with argon prior to sealing. Hydrogen was then introduced (1 to 5 bars) into the autoclave to initiate the reaction. At the end of the reaction, the pressure was reduced to atmospheric pressure. The autoclave was then opened. Vitamin E was obtained after usual make-up of the mixture.<br><br><br><br>
