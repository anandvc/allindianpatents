				<td>MICROP ARTICLES FOR DELIVERY OF HETEROLOGOUS NUCLEIC ACIDS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to pharmaceutical compositions. In particular, the<br>
invention relates to microparticles of polymers or submicron emulsions having adsorbent surfaces<br>
wherein biologically active agents, particularly nucleic acids, such as plasrrdd DNA, Eukaryotic<br>
Layered Vector Initiation Systems (ELVIS vectors) or RNA vector constructs, are adsorbed<br>
thereto, methods for preparing such microparticles and submicron emulsions, and uses theere of<br>
 including induction of immune responses, vaccines, and delivery of heterologous nucleotide<br>
sequences to eukaryotic cells and animals.<br>
 Background<br>
	Particulate carriers have been used in order to achieve controlled, parenteral delivery of<br>
therapeutic compounds. Such carriers are designed to maintain the active agent in the delivery<br>
system for an extended period of time Exarnples of particulate carriers include those derived from<br>
polymethyl metnacrylate polymers, as well as microparticles derived frompoly(lactides) (see, e.g.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,773,919), poly (lactide-co-grycolides), known as PLG (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,767,628) and polyethylene glycol, known as PEG (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,648,095).<br>
polymethyl metnacrylate polymers are nondegradable while PLG particles biodegrade by random<br>
nonenzymatic hydrolysis of ester bonds to lactic and grycolic acids which are excreted along<br>
normal metabolic pathways.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,648,095 describes the use of microspheres with<br>
encapsulated pharmaceuticals as drug delivery systems for nasal, oral, pulmonary and oral delivery.<br>
Slow-release formulations containing various polypeptide growth factors have also been<br>
described. See, e.g., Intemarional Publication No. WO 94/12158, U.S. Patent No. 5,134,122 and<br>
International Publication No. WO 96/37216.<br><br>
Fattal et al, Journal of Controlled Release 53:137-143 (1998) describes nanoparticles<br>
prepared from polyalkylcyanoacrylates (PACA) having adsorbed oligonucleotides.<br>
Particulate carriers, such as micraparticles, have also been used with adsorbed or entrapped<br>
antigens in attempts to elicit adequate immine responses. Such carriers present multiple copies of<br>
a selected antigen to the immune system and promote trapping and retention of antigens in local<br>
lymph nodes. The particles can be phagocytosed by macrophages and can enhance antigen<br>
presentation through cytokine release. For example, commonly owned, co-pending Application<br>
No. 09/015,652, filed January 29,1998, describes the use of antigen-adsorbed and antigen-<br>
encapsulated rmcroparticles to stimulate cell-mediated immunological responses, as well as<br>
methods of making the rmcroparticles.<br>
In commonly owned Patent Application Serial No. 09/015,652, for example, a method of<br>
forming rmcroparticles is disclosed which comprises combining a polymer with an organic solvent,<br>
then adding an emulsion stabilizer, such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), then evaporating the organic<br>
solvent, thereby forming rmcroparticles. The surface of the rmcroparticles comprises the polymer<br>
and the stabilizer. Macromolecules such as ELVIS vectors, other nucleotides (DNA or RNA),<br>
polypeptides, and antigens may then be adsorbed on those surfaces.<br>
Adjuvants are compounds which are capable of potentiating an immune response to<br>
antigens. Adjuvants can potentiate both humoral and cellular immunity. However, it is preferable<br>
for certain pathogens to stimulate cellular immunity and, particularly, Thl cells. In many instances,<br>
presently used adjuvants do not adequately induce Thl cell responses, and/or have deleterious side<br>
effects.<br>
Currently, the onry advants approved for human use in the United States are aluminum<br>
 These adjuvants hare been useful for some vaccines including hepatitis B, diphtheria,<br>
polio, rabies, and influenza, but may not be useful for others. For example, reports indicate that<br>
alum failed to improve the effectiveness of whooping cough and typhoid vaccines and provided<br>
only a slight effect with adenovirus vaccines. Additionally, problems such as, induction of<br>
granulomas at the ection site and lot-to-lot variation of alum preparations have been<br>
experienced.<br>
Microparticles prepared from biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, known as the<br>
poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLG), have been demonstrated to be effective vehicles for a number of<br><br>
antigens. In addition, PLG microparricles can control the rate of release of entrapped antigens and,<br>
thus, offer potential for single-dose vaccines. Moreover, administration of biodegradable polymers<br>
with entrapped antigens has been demonstrated in a range of animal models to induce potent<br>
immune responses. O'HaganefaL, AdvancedDrug Deliv.Rev., 1998, 32,225-246 and Singh et<br>

An emulsion comprising squalene, sorbrtaa trioleate (Span85™), and polysorbate 80<br>
(Tween 80™) microfluidized to provide unirbrmry sized microdroplets, i e. MF59, has also been<br>
shown to induce potent immune responses. MF59 formulations have been shown to induce<br>
antibody titers from 5 to &gt;100 times greater than those obtained with aluminum salt adjuvants.<br>
MF59 has been demonstrated to enhance the immune response to antigens from numerous sources<br>
including, for example, herpes simplex vims (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),<br>
mfliifin7a virus, hepatitis C vims (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), human<br>
papillomavirus (HPV), and materia. Ott etal, Vaccine Design: The Subunit And Adjuvant<br>

assignee of the present invention, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety. In animal studies, MF59 has not been found to be genotoxic, teratogenic, nor does it<br>
cause sensitization. The mechanism of action of MF59 appears to be dependent upon the<br>
generation of a strong CD4+ T cefl, ie., a Th2 cell response. MF59 adjuvants, however, elicit<br>
little, if any, Thl responses, or cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses.<br>

approach to pharmaceutical delivery, were first shown to have carrying capacity for small<br>
molecule drugs (Elbaz et al 1993 Int. J. Pharm. 96 R1-R6). Use of the charged surface to stably<br>
bind and protect oligonucleotides in serum has been demonstrated for both small oligomers<br>
(Teixera et al (1999) Pharm Res 16 30-36) and plasmid DNA (Yi et al (2000) Pharm Res 17 314-<br>

(Kim et al, supra).<br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
The inventors herein have discovered that the effectiveness of the various uses of nucleic<br>
acids, particularly vector constructs capable of expressing a nucleic acid sequence, and more<br>
particularly vector constructs comprising a heterologous nucleic acid sequence encoding an<br>
antigen, such as such pCMV vectors, ELVIS vectors or RNA vector constructs may be enhanced<br>
by adsorbing the vector constructs to polymer microparticles or submicron emulsions with<br>
adsorbent surfaces, which facilitates introduction of the vector constructs, and of heterologous<br>
nucleic acid sequences comprised in the vector constructs, into the cells of an animal<br>
As disclosed in above described Intemational Patent Application PCT/US99/17308, a<br>
method of forming microparticles with adsorbent surfaces capable of adsorbing a wide variety of<br>

Each of the nonexhaustive previously described adsorbent microparticles may optionally<br>
also have macromolecules entrapped within them, or in free solution. Thus, the invention<br>
encompasses a variety of combinations wherein nucleic acid molecules are adsorbed on<br>

U.S. patent application no. 09/499,023, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference<br>
in its entirety). Electroporation is the application of short electrical pulses to cells to increase<br>
permeability of the cell membranes, thus facilitating DNA uptake by cells. Recently it has been<br>
found that applying an electric field to tissues in vivo significantly increases DNA uptake and gene<br>
expression (Matmesen, I., 1999, Gene Therapy 6:508). Among the tissues targeted for in vivo<br>
electroporation have been skin, liver, tumors, and muscle. For DNA vaccine application, Widera et<br>
al have shown mat in vivo electroporation substantially enhances DNA vaccine potency in mice,<br>
guinea pigs, and rabbits (Widera, G., et al, 2000, J. Immunol 164:4635).<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is based upon the surprising discovery that rmcroparticles with<br>
adsorbed nucleic acid molecules, preferably vector constructs capable of expressing a nucleic acid<br>
sequence, and more preferably vector constructs comprising a heterologous nucleic acid sequence<br>
encoding an antigen, such as pCMV vectors, ELVIS vectors or RNA vector constructs, elicit<br>
enhanced immune responses. Additionally, the combination of microparticles with adsorbed<br>
nucleic acid molecules (for example, microparticles with adsorbed pCMV vectors, ELVIS vectors<br>
or RNA vector constructs) and adjuvants is useful for eliciting enhanced immune responses.<br>
The invention is also based upon the surprising discovery that vector constructs comprising<br>
antigen-encoding nucleic acid sequences, such as pCMV vectors, ELVIS vectors or RNA vector<br>
constructs, in association with subsequent administration of antigen elicit enhanced<br>
responses.<br>

As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an" and "the"<br>
include plural references unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, the term<br>
"microparticle" refers to one or more microparticles, and the like.<br>
A Defffinrtions<br>
In describing the present invention, the following terms will be employed, and are intended<br>
to be defined as indicated below.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, all percentages and ratios herein are given on a weight basis.<br>
The term "microparticle" as used herein, refers to a particle of about 10 nm to about 150<br>
pmin diameter, more preferably about 200 nmto about 30 urn in diameter, and most preferably<br>
about 500 nmto about 10 umin diameter. Preferably, the microparticle will be of a diameter that<br>
permits parenteral or mucosal administration without occluding needles and capillaries.<br>
Microparticle size is readily determined by techniques well known in the art, such as photon<br>
correlation spectroscopy, laser diffractometry and/or scanning electron microscopy. The term<br>
"particle" may also be used to denote a microparticle as defined herein. Microparticle may<br>
alternatively refer to a submicron emulsion composition as described herein<br>
Polymer microparticles for use herein are formed from materials that are stenlizable, non-<br>
toxic and biodegradable. Such materials include, without limitation, poly(a-hydroxy acid),<br>
polyhydroxybutyric acid, polycaprolactone, polyorthoester, polyanhydride, PACA, and<br>

microparticles derived from a poly(α-hydroxy acid), in particular, from a poly(lactide) ("PLA") or a<br>
copolymer of D,L-lactide and glycolide or gly colic acid, such as a poly(D,L-lacnde-co-glycolide)<br><br>
("PLG" or "PLGA"), or a copolymer of D,L-lactide and caprolactone. The polymer microparticles<br>
may be derived from any of various polymeric starting materials which have a variety of molecular<br>
weights and, in the case of the copolymers such as PLG, a variety of lactide:glycolide ratios, the<br>
selection of which will be largely a matter of choice, depending in part on the coadministered<br>
macromolecule. These parameters are discussed more fully below. Alternatively, microparticles of<br>
the invention are comprised in a submicron emulsion.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "oil droplet emulsion" refers to an emulsion comprising a<br>
metabolizable oil and an emulsifying agent The term "submicron emulsion" as used herein refers<br>
to an oil droplet emulsion of the invention comprising droplets ranging in size from about 10 nm to<br>
about 1000 nm<br>
As used herein, the term "microparticle" may refer to a polymer microparticle as described<br>

The term "detergent" as used herein includes surfactants, dispersing agents, suspending<br>
agents, and emulsion stabilizers. Anionic detergents include, but are not limited to, SDS (sodium<br>
dodecyl sulfate), SLS (sodium lauryi sulfite), DSS (disulfosuccinate), sulphated fatty alcohols, and<br>
the like. Catiomc detergents include, but are not limited to, cetrimide (cetyl trimethyl ammonium<br>

polysorbates, polyoxyethylated glycol monoethers, polyoxyethylated alkyl phenols, poloxamers,<br>
and the like.<br>
The term "zeta potential" as used herein, refers to the electrical potential that exists across<br>
the interface of all solids and liquids, ie., the potential across the diffuse layer of ions surrounding<br>
a charged colloidal particle. Zeta potential can be calculated from electrophoretic mobilities, i e.,<br>
the rates at which colloidal particles travel between charged electrodes placed in contact with the<br>
substance to be measured, using techniques well known in the art.<br>
The term "macromolecule" as used herein refers to, without limitation, a pharmaceutical, a<br>
polynucleotide, a polypeptide, a hormone, an enzyme, a transcription or translation mediator, an<br>
intermediate in a metabolic pathway, an immunomodulator, an antigen, an adjuvant, or<br><br>
combinations thereof Particular macromolecules for use with the present invention are described<br>
in more detail below.<br>
The term "pharmaceutical" refers to biologically active compounds such as antibiotics,<br>
antiviral agents, growth factors, hormones, and the like, discussed in more detail below.<br>
The term "adjuvant" refers to any substance that assists or modifies the action of a<br>
pharmaceutical, including but not limited to immunological adjuvants, which increase or diversify<br>
the immune response to an antigen.<br>
A "polynucleotide" is a nucleic acid polymer, which typically encodes a biologically active<br>
(e.g., immunogenic or therapeutic) protein or polypeptide. Depending on the nature of the<br>
polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotide, a polynucleotide can include as little as 10 nucleotides,<br>
e.g., where the polynucleotide encodes an antigen. Furthermore, a "polynucleotide" can include<br>
both double- and single-stranded sequences and refers to, but is not limited to, cDNA from viral,<br>
procaryotic or eucaryotic mRNA, genomic RNA and DNA sequences from viral (e.g. RNA and<br>
DNA viruses and retroviruses) or procaryotic DNA, and especially synthetic DNA sequences. The<br>
term also captures sequences mat include any of the known base analogs of DNA and RNA The<br>
term further includes modifications, such as deletions, additions and substitutions (generally<br>
conservative in nature), to a native sequence, preferably such that the nucleic acid molecule<br>
encodes a therapeutic or antigenic protein. These modifications may be deliberate, as through site-<br>
directed mutagenesis, or may be accidental, such as through mutations of hosts which produce the<br>
antigens.<br>
The terms "polypeptide" and "protein" refer to a polymer of amino acid residues and are<br>
not limited to a rninimum length of the product Thus, peptides, oligopeptides, dimers, multimers,<br>
and the like, are included within the definition. Both full-length proteins and fragments thereof are<br>
encompassed by the definition. The terms also include modifications, such as deletions, additions<br>
and substitutions (generafly conservative in nature), to a native sequence, preferably such that the<br>
protein maintains the ability to elicit an immunological response or have a therapeutic effect on a<br>
subject to which the protein is administered.<br>
By "antigen" is meant a molecule which contains one or more epitopes capable of<br>
stimulating a host' s immune system to make a cellular antigen-specific immune, response when the<br>
antigen is presented in accordance with the present invention, or a humoral antibody response. An<br><br>
antigen may be capable of eliciting a cellular or humoral response by itself or when present in<br>
combination with another molecule. Normally, an epitope will include between about 3-15,<br>
preferably about 5-15, and more preferably about 7-15 amino acids. Epitopes of a given protein<br>
can be identified using any number of epitope mapping techniques, well known in the art. See,<br>
e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, VoL 66 (Glenn B. Morris, Ed,<br>
1996) Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey. For example, linear epitopes may be determined by<br>
e.g., concurrently synthesizing large numbers of peptides on solid supports, the peptides<br>
corresponding to portions of the protein molecule, and reacting the peptides with antibodies while<br>
the peptides are still attached to the supports. Such techniques are known in the art and described<br>
in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,708,871; Geysenet aL (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998-<br>
4002; Geysen et al (1986) Molec. Immunol. 23:709-715, all incorporated herein by reference in<br>
their entireties. Similarly, conformational epitopes are readily identified by determining spatial<br>
conformation of amino acids such as by, e.g., x-ray crystallography and 2-dirnensional nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols, supra.<br>
The term "antigen' as used hererind aotes bom subunit antigens, Le., antigens which are<br>
separate and discrete from a whole organism with which the antigen is associated in nature, as well<br>
as killed, attenuated or inactivated bacteria, viruses, parasites or other microbes. Antibodies such<br>
as anti-idiotype antibodies, or fragments thereof, and synthetic peptide mimotopes, which can<br>
mimic an antigen or antigenic determinant, are also captured under the definition of antigen as used<br>
herein Similarly, an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide which expresses a therapeutic or<br>
immunogenic protein, or antigenic determinant in vivo, such as in gene therapy and nucleic acid<br>
immunization applications, is also included m the definition of antigen herein<br>
Further, tor purposes of the present invention, antigens can be derived from any of several<br>
known viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi, as well as any of the various tumor antigens.<br>
Furthermore, for purposes of the present invention, an "antigen" refers to a protein which includes<br>
modifications, such as deletions, additions and substitutions (generally conservative in nature), to<br>
the native sequence, so long as the protein maintian the ability to elicit an immunological<br>
response. These modifications may be deliberate, as through she-directed mutagenesis, or may be<br>
accidental, such as through mutations of hosts which produce the antigens.<br><br>
An "immunological response" or 'immune response" to an antigen or composition is the<br>
development in a subject of a humoral and/or a cellular immune response to molecules present in<br>
the composition of interest For purposes of the present invention, a "humoral immune response"<br>
refers to an immune response mediated by antibody molecules, while a "cellular immune response"<br>
is one mediated by T-rymphocytes and/or other white blood cells. One important aspect of cellular<br>
immunity involves an antigen-specific response by cytolytic T-cells ("CTLs"). CTLs have<br>
specificity for peptide antigens that are presented in association with proteins encoded by the major<br>
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and expressed on the surfeces of cells. CTLs help induce and<br>
promote the intracellular destruction of intracellular microbes, or the lysis of cells infected with<br>
such microbes. Another aspect of cellular immunity involves an antigen-specific response by helper<br>
T-cells. Helper T-cells act to help stimulate the function, and focus the activity of, nonspecific<br>
effector cells against cells displaying peptide antigens in association with MHC molecules on their<br>
surface. A "cellular immune response" also refers to the production of cytokines, chemolrines and<br>
other such molecules produced by activated T-cells and/or other white blood cells, including those<br>
derived from CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells.<br>
A composition, such as an immunogenic composition, or vaccine that elicits a cellular<br>
immune response may serve to sensitize a vertebrate subject by the presentation of antigen in<br>
association with MHC molecules at the cell surface. Tte ceD-rnediated immune response is<br>
directed at, or near, cells presenting antigen at their surface. In addition, antigen-specific T-<br>
rymphocytes can be generated to allow for the future protection of an minimized host<br>
The ability of a particular antigen or composition to stimulate a cell-mediated<br>
immunological response may be determined by a number of assays, such as by h/mphoproliferation<br>
(lymphocyte activation) assays, CTL cytotoxic cell assays, by assaying for T-tymphocytes specific<br>
for the antigen m. a sensitized subject, or by measurement ofcytokine production by T cells in<br>
resporjse to restimulation with antigen Such assays are well known in the art See, e.g., Erickson<br>
et al, J. ImmmoL (1993) 151:4189-4199-, Doe et al, Eur. J. Immunol. (1994) 24:2369-2376; and<br>
the examples below.<br>
Thus, an immunological response as used herein may be one whi&amp; stimulates the<br>
production of CTLs, and/or the production or activation of helper T-cells. The antigen of interest<br>
may also elicit an antibody-mediated immune response. Hence, an immunological response may<br><br>
include one or more of the Mowing effects: the production of antibodies by B-cefls; and/or the<br>
activation of suppressor T-ceHs and/or yS T-cefls directed specificaUy to an antigen or antigens<br>
present in the composition or vaccine of interest These responses may serve to neutralize<br>
infectivity, and/or mediate antibody-complernent, or antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)<br>
to jffovkte protection to an rmrmnrized host Such responses on be determined using standard<br>
immunoassays and neutralization assays, well known in the art<br>
A composition which contains a selected antigen adsorbed to a microparticie, displays<br>
"enhanced immunogenicity" when it possesses a greater capacity to eKch an hnrmriM response than<br>
the immune response elicited by an equivalent amount of the antigen when delivered without<br>
assoriation wife the microparticie. Thus, a composition may display "airimced mniunogenicity"<br>
because the antigen is more strongly immunogenic by virtue of adsorption to the microparticle, or<br>
because a lower dose of antigen is necessary to achieve an immune response in the subject to which<br>
it is administered. Such enhanced imrnunogenicity can be determined by administering the<br>
rrricroparticle/aaitigen composition, and antigen controls to animals and comparing antibody titers<br>
against the two using standard assays such as radiomknunoassay and ELISAs, well known in the<br>
art.<br>
The terms "effective amount1' or "pharmaceuticauy effective amount" of a given<br>
composition, as provided herein, refer to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the composition to<br>
provide a desired response, such as an immunological response, and corresponding therapeutic<br>
effect, or in the case of delivery of a therapeutic protein, an amount sufficient to effect treatment of<br>
the subject, as denned below. As will be pointed out below, the exact amount required win vary<br>
from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the<br>
severity of the condition being treated, and the particular macromolecule of interest, mode of<br>
administration, and the like. An appropriate "effective" amount many individual case may be<br>
determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.<br>
By "vertebrate subject" is meant any member of the subphylum cordata, including, without<br>
limitation, mammals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, horses, and humans; domestic animals such<br>
as dogs and cats; and birds, including domestic, wild and game birds such as cocks and hens<br>
including chickens, turkeys and other gallinaceous birds. The term does not denote a particular<br>
age. Thus, both adult and newborn animals are intended to be covered.<br><br>
By "prarrnaceuticauy acceptable" or "pharmacologically acceptable" is meant a material<br>
which is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, Le., the material may be administered to an<br>
individual along with the mkroparticle formulation without causing any undesirable biological<br>
effects in the individual or interacting in a deleterious marmerwimauyofthecomrwrienteofthe<br>
composition in which it is contained.<br>
The term "excpenf refers to substances that are rortmvnly provided wimm finished<br>
dosage forms, and include vehicles, binders, disintegrants, fillers (diluents), robricants, gndants<br>
(now enhancers), compression aids, colors, sweeteners, preservatives, suspensing/dispersing<br>
agents, firm formers/coatings, flavors and panting inks.<br>
By "physiological pH" or a "pH in the physiological range" is meant a pH in the range of<br>
approximately 7.2 to 8.0 inclusive, more typically in the range of approximately 7.2 to 7.6<br>
inclusive.<br>
As used herein, "treatment" (including variations thereof) for example, "treat" or "treated")<br>
refers to any of (i) the prevention of infection or reinfection, as in a traditional vaccine, (ii) the<br>
reduction or elimination of symptoms, and (iii) the substantial or complete elimination of the<br>

B. General Methods<br>
1. Polymer Microparticles with Adsorbed Macromolecules<br>
Polymer microparticles, including FLA and PLG microparticles, efficiently adsorb<br>
biologically active macromolecules. Further, these microparticles adsorb a great variety of<br>
molecules, including charged and/or bulky macromolecules. Thus the<br>
macromolecule/microparticles used in connection with the present invention can be used as a<br>
delivery system to deliver me biologically active components in order to treat, prevent and/or<br>
diagnose a wide variety of diseases.<br>
A wide variety of macromolecules can be delivered in association with the microparticles<br>
including, but not limited to, pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics and antiviral agents, nonsteroidal<br>
antiinflammatory drugs, analgesics, vasodilators, cardiovascular drugs, psychotropics, neuroleptics,<br>
antidepressants, antiparkmson drugs, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, bradykinin<br>
inhibitors, ACE-inhibitors, vasodilators, prolactin inhibitors, steroids, hormone antagonists,<br>
antihistamines, serotonin antagonists, heparin, chemotherapeutic agents, antineoplastics and<br>
growth Actors, including but not limited to PDGF, EGF, KGF, IGF-1 and IGF-2, FGF,<br>
polynucleotides which encode therapeutic or immunogenic proteins, immunogenic proteins and<br>
epitopes thereof for use in vaccines, hormones including peptide hormones such as insulin,<br>
proinsulin, growth hormone, GHRH, LHRH, EOF, somatostatin, SNX-111, BNP, insulinotropin,<br>
ANP, FSH, LH, PSH and hCG, gonadal steroid hormones (androgens, estrogens and<br>
progesterone), thyroid-stimulating hormone, inMbin, cholecystokirrin, ACTH, CKF, dynorphins,<br>
endorphins, mrlothfllin, fibronectin fragments, galanin, gastrin, insulinotropin, glucagon, GTP-<br>
binding protein fragments, guanyhn, the leukokinins, magainin, mastoparans, dermaseptin,<br>
systemin, neuromedins, neurotensin, pancreastatin, pancreatic polypeptide, substance P, secretin,<br>
thymosin, and the Eke, enzymes, transcription or translation mediators, intermediates in metabolic<br>
pathways, irnrnunornodulators, such as any of the various cytokines including interleukin-1,<br>
interleukm-2, interleukin-3, interleukin-4, and gamma-interferon, antigens, and adjuvants.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the invention, the macromolecule is nucleic acid, more<br>
preferably a vector construct such as an ELVIS vector, or RNA vector construct. One particular<br>
advantage of the present invention is the ability of the microparticles with adsorbed ELVIS vector<br>
to generate cell-mediated immune responses in a vertebrate subject The ability of the antigen/<br><br>
microparticles of the present invention to elicit a cell-mediated immmifs response against a selected<br>
antigen provides a powerful tool against infection by a wide variety of pathogens. Accordingly, the<br>
antigen/ microparticles of the present invention can be incorporated into vaccine compositions.<br>
Thus, in addition to a conventional antibody response, the systems herein described can<br>
provide far, e.g., the association of the expressed antigens with class IMHC molecules such that<br>
an in vivo cellular immune response to the antigen of interest can be mounted which stimulates the<br>
production of CTLs to allow for future recognition of the antigen Furthermore, the methods may<br>
elicit an antigen-specific response by helper T-celk Accordingly, the methods of the present<br>
invention will find use with any macromolecule for which cellular and/or humoral immune<br>
responses are desired, preferably antigens derived from viral pathogens mat may induce antibodies,<br>
T-cell helper epitopes and T-cell cytotoxic epitopes. Such antigens include, but are not limited to,<br>
those encoded by human and animal viruses and can correspond to either structural or non-<br>
structural proteins.<br>
The microparticles of the present invention are particularly useful for immunization against<br>
intraceltalar viruses which normally elicit poor immune responses. For example, the present<br>
invention will find use for stimulating an immune response against a wide variety of proteins from<br>
the herpesvirus famuy, including proteins derived from herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2,<br>
such as HSV-1 and HSV-2 glycoproteins gB, gD and gH; antigens derived from varicella zoster<br>
virus (VZV), Epstedn-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) jnrJndTng CMV gB and gH;<br>
and antigens derived from other human herpesviruses such as HHV6 and HHV7. (See, e.g. Chee<br>
et aL, Cytomegaloviruses (J.K McDougaH, ed., Springer-Verlag 1990) pp. 125-169, for a review<br>
of the protein coding content of cytomegalovirus; McGeoch et aL, J. Gen. Virol. (1988) 6j&gt;:1531-<br>

Antigens from the hepatitis family of viruses, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B<br>
virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), the delta hepatitis virus (HDV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and<br>
hepatitis G virus (HGV), can also be conveniently used in the techniques described herein. By way<br>
of example, the viral genomic sequence of HCV is known, as are methods for obtaining the<br><br>
sequence. See, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 89/04669; WO 90/11089; and WO<br>
90/14436. Hie HCV genome encodes several viral proteins, including El (also known as E) and<br>
E2 (also known as E2/NSI) and an N-terminal nucleocapsid protein (termed "core") (see,<br>
Houghton et al, Hepatology (1991) 14:381-388, for a discussion of HCV proteins, including El<br>
and E2). Each of these proteins, as well as antigenic fragments thereof, will find use in the present<br>
composition and methods.<br>
Similarly, the sequence for the 5-antigen from HDV is known (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,378,814) and this antigen can also be conveniently used in the present composition and methods.<br>
Additionally, antigens derived from HBV, such as the core antigen, the surface antigen, SAg, as<br>
well as the presurface sequences, pre-Sl and pre-S2 (formerly called pre-S), as well as<br>
amibinations of the above, such as SAg/pre-Sl, SAg/pre-S2, SAg/pre-Sl/pre-S2, and pre-Sl/pre-<br>
S2, will find use herein. See, e.g., "HBV Vaccines - from the laboratory to license: a case study" in<br>
Mackett, M. and Williamson, J.D., Human Vaccines and Vaccination, pp. 159-176, for a<br>
discussion of HBV structure; and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,722,840,5,098,704,5,324,513, incorporated<br>

al,/. Virol (1990) 64:3319-3330; and Zhou etaL,/. Virol (1991)65:5457-5464.<br>
Antigens derived from other viruses will also find use in the c^mmvi compositions and<br>
methods, such as without Imitation, proteins from members of the families Picomaviridae (e.g.,<br>
pohoviruses, etc.); Caliciviridae; Togaviridae (e.g., rubella virus, dengue virus, eta); Flavrviridae;<br>
Coronaviridae; Reoviridae; Birnaviridae; Rhabodoviridae (e.g., rabies virus, etc.); Filoviridae;<br>
Paramyxoviridae (e.g., mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, etc.);<br>
Orthomyxoviridae (e.g., jnthienza virus types A, B and C, etc.); Bunyaviridae; Arenaviridae;<br>
Retroviradae (e.g., HTLV-I; HTLV-H; HTV-1 (also known as HTLV-IH, LAV, ARV, hTLR,<br>
etc.)), including but not limited to antigens from the isolates HTVn&gt;, HTVSR, HTVLAV, HTVLAI,<br>
HTVMH), HTV-IOMCIS, HTV-IUM; HTV-2; simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) among others.<br>
Additionally, antigens may also be derived from human papillomavirus (HPV) and the tick-borne<br>
encephalitis viruses. See, e.g. Virology, 3rd Edition (W.K. Joklik ed. 1988); Fundamental<br>
Virology, 2nd Edition (B.N. Fields and D.M. Knipe, eds. 1991), for a description of these and<br>
other viruses.<br><br>
More particularly, the gpl20 or gpl40 envelope proteins from any of the above HTV<br>
isolates, including members of the various genetic subtypes of HTV, are known and reported (see,<br>
e.g., Myers et aL, Los Alamos Database, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New<br>
Mexico (1992); Myers et aL, Human Retrotfruses and Aids, 1990, Los Alamos, New Mexico: Los<br>
Alamos National Laboratory; and Modrow et aL, J. Virol. (1987) 61:570-578, for a comparison of<br>
the envelope sequences of a variety of HTV isolates) and antigens derived from any of these<br>
isolates will find use in the present methods. Furthermore, the invention is equally applicable to<br>
other immunogenic proteins derived from any of the various HTV isolates, including any of the<br>
various envelope proteins such as gpl60 and gp41, gag antigens such as p24gag and p55gag, as<br>
well as proteins derived from the pol and tat regions. Any of these proteins and antigens may also<br>
be modified for use in the present invention. For example, Figures 1,2, 5, and 6 provide DNA<br>
sequences encoding modified gag antigens (SEQ ID NOs: 63, 64, 67, and 68), and Figures 3 and 4<br>
provide DNA sequences encoding modified envelope antigens (SEQ ID NOs: 65 and 66).<br>
Influenza virus is another example of a virus for which the present invention will be<br>
particularly useful Specifically, the envelope glycoproteins HA and NA of influenza A are of<br>
particular interest for generating an immune response. Numerous HA subtypes of influenza A have<br>
been identified (Kawaoka et aL, Virology (1990) 179:759-767; Webster et aL, "Antigenic variation<br>
among type A mflnm?* viruses," p. 127-168. In: P. Palese and D.W. Kingsbury (ed), Genetics of<br>
influenza viruses. Springer-Verlag, New York). Thus, proteins derived from any of these isolates<br>
can also be used in the compositions and methods described herein.<br>
The compositions and methods described herein will also find use with numerous bacterial<br>
antigens, such as those derived from organisms that cause diphtheria, cholera, tuberculosis,<br>
tet uus, pertussis, meningitis, and other pathogenic states, mrhiHing without limitation, Bordetella<br>
pertussis, Neisseria meningt tides (A, B, C, Y), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Helicobacter pylori, and<br>
Haemophilus influenza. Hemophilus influenza type B (HT£), Helicobacter pylori, and<br>
combinations thereof Examples of antigens fromAfeisserto meningitiaes B are disclosed in the<br>
following co-owned patent applications: PCT/US99/09346; PCTIB98/01665; and PCT<br>
IB99/00103. Examples of parasitic antigens include those derived from organisms causing malaria<br>
and Lyme disease.<br>

Where a saccharide or carbohydrate antigen is used, it is preferably conjugated to a carrier<br>
protein in order to enhance nnmunogemcity [e.g. Refs. 47 to 56]. Preferred carrier proteins are<br>
bacterial toxins or toxoids, such as diphtheria or tetanus toxoids. The CRM^ diphtheria toxoid is<br>
particularly preferred. Other suitable carrier proteins include N. meningitidis outer membrane<br>

pertussis proteins [e.g. Refs. 61,62], protein D fcomH. Influenzae [e.g. Ref 63], toxin A or B<br>
fromC. difficile [e.g. Ref 64], etc. Where a mixture comprises capsular saccharides from both<br>
serogroups A and C, it is preferred that the ratio (w/w) of MenA saccharide. MenC saccharide is<br>
greaterthan 1 (e.g. 2:1, 3:1,4:1,5:1,10:1 or higher). Saccharides from different serogroups ofN.<br>
meningitidis may be conjugated to the same or different carrier proteins.<br>
Any suitable conjugation reaction can be used, with any suitable linker where necessary.<br>
Toxic protein antigens may be detoxified where necessary (e.g. detoxification of pertussis<br>
toxin by chemical and/or means [Ref 30].<br>
Where diphtheria antigen is included in the composition it is preferred also to include<br>
tetanus antigen and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a tetanus antigen is included it is preferred<br>
also to include diphtheria and pertussis antigens. Similarly, where a pertussis antigen is included it<br>
is preferred also to include diphtheria and tetanus antigens.<br>
It is readily apparent that the subject invention can be used to deliver a wide variety of<br>
macromolecules and hence to treat, prevent and/or diagnose a large number of diseases. In some<br>
embodiments, the rnacromolecule/microparticle compositions of the present invention can be used<br>
for site-specific targeted delivery. For example, intravenous administration of the<br>
rnacromolecule/microparticle compositions can be used for targeting the lung, liver, spleen, blood<br>
circulation, or bone marrow.<br>
The adsorption of macromolecules to the surface of the adsorbent microparticles (or to<br>
submicron emulsions of the present invention) occurs via any bonding-interaction mechanism,<br>
including, but not limited to, ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding, covalent bonding, Van der Waals<br><br>
bonding, physical entrapment, and bonding through hydrophflic/hydrophobic interactions. Those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art may readily select detergents appropriate for the type of maoromolecule<br>
to be adsorbed.<br>
For example, microparticles manufactured in the presence of charged detergents, such as<br>
anionic or catiooic detergents, may yield microparticles with a surface having a net negative or a<br>
net positive charge, which can adsorb a wide variety of molecules. For example, microparticles<br>
manufactured with anionic detergents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), ie. SDS-PLG<br>
microparticles, adsorb positively charged antigens, such as proteins. Similarly, microparticles<br>
manufactured with canonic detergents, such as hexadecylhirnethylanxnooium bromide (CTAB),<br>
ie. CTAB-PLGmicroparticles, adsorb negatively charged rnacromolecules, such as DNA. Where<br>
the rnacromolecules to be adsorbed have regions of positive and negative charge, canonic, anionic,<br>
nonionic or zwitterioinic detergents may be appropriate.<br>
Biodegradable polymers for manufacturing microparticles for use with the present invention<br>
are readily commercially available from, e.g., Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany and Birmingham<br>
Polymers, Inc., Birrnmgharn, AL. For example, useful polymers for forming the microparticles<br>
herein include homopolymers, copolymers and polymer blends derived from the following:<br>
pofyhydroxybutyric acid (also known as polyhydroxyburyrate); polyhydroxy valeric acid (also<br>
known as polyhydroxyvalerate); polygrycoKc add (PGA) (also known as polygtycoKde): poly lactic<br>
acid (PLA) (also known as polylactide); polydioxanone; polycaprolactone; polyormoester, and<br>
polyanhydride. More preferred are poly(a-hydroxy acids), such as poly(L-lactide), pofy(D,L-<br>
Iactide) (both known as "PLA" herein), poly(hydoxybutyrate), copolymers of D,L-lactide and<br>
glycolide, such as poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (designated as "PLG" or "PLGA" herein) or a<br>
copolymer of D,L-lactide and caprolactone. Particularly preferred polymers for use hei ein are<br>
PLA and PLG polymers. These polymers are available in a variety of molecular weights, and the<br>
appropriate molecular weight for a given use is readily determined by one of skill in the art. Thus,<br>
e.g., for PLA, a suitable molecular weight wffl be on the order of about 2000 to 5000. For PLG,<br>
suitable molecular weights will generally range from about 10,000 to about 200,000, preferably<br>
about 15,000 to about 150,000.<br>
If a copolymer such as PLG is used to form the microparticles, a variety of lactide: glycolide<br>
ratios will find use herein and the ratio is largely a matter of choice, depending in part on the<br><br>
coadministered macromolecule and the rate of degradation desired. For example, a 50:50 PLG<br>
polymer, containing 50% D,L-lactide and 50% glycolide, will provide a fast resorbing copolymer<br>
while 75:25 PLG degrades more slowly, and 85:15 and 90:10, even more slowly, due to the<br>
increased lactide component. It is readily apparent that a suitable ratio of lacude:grycoEde is easily<br>
determined by one of skill in the art based, for example, on the nature of the antigen aid disorder in<br>
question. Moreover, in embodiments of the present invention wherein antigen or adjuvants are<br>
entrapped within microparticles, mixtures of microparticles with varying lactide: glycolide ratios<br>
will find use herein in order to achieve the desired release kinetics for a given macromolecule and<br>
to provide for both a primary and secondary immune response. Degradation rate of the<br>
microparticles of the present invention can also be controlled by such factors as polymer molecular<br>
weight and polymer crystalliniry. PLG copolymers with varying lactide:grycolide ratios and<br>
molecular weights are readily available commercially from a number of sources including from<br>
Boehringer Ingfllhftim, Germany and Birmingham Polymers, Inc., Birmingham, AL. These<br>
polymers can also be synthesized by simple pofycondensation of the lactic acid component using<br>
techniques well known in the art, such as described in Tabata et aL, J. Biomed Mater. Res. (1988)<br>
22:837-858.<br>
'Where used, preferred poly(D,L-lactide-co-grycolide) polymers are those having a<br>
lactide/grycoMe molar ratio ranging from 30:70 to 70:30, more preferably 40:60 to 60:40, and<br>
having a molecular weight ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 Daltons, more preferably from 30,000<br>
Daltons to 70,000 Daltons.<br>
The polymer microparticles are prepared using any of several methods well known in the<br>
art. For example, in some embodiments, double emulsion/solvent evaporation techniques, such as<br>
those described in U.S. Patent No. 3,523,907 and Ogawa et aL, Chem. Pharm. Bull (1988)<br>
36:1095-1103, can be used herein to make the rmcroparticles. These techniques involve the<br>
formation of a primary emulsion consisting of droplets of polymer solution, which is subsequently<br>
mixed with a continuous aqueous phase containing a particle stabilizer/ surfactant.<br>
Alternatively, a water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) solvent evaporation system can be used to<br>
form the microparticles, as described by OHagan et aL, Vaccine (1993) 11:965-969,<br>
PCT/US99/17308 (WO 00/06123) to O'Hagan et aL and Jeffery et aL, Pharm Res. (1993)<br>
10:362. In mis technique, the particular polymer is typically combined with an organic solvent,<br><br>
such as ethyl acetate, dimethylchloride (also called methylene chloride and dichloromethane),<br>
acetonitrile, acetone, chloroform, and the Hce. The polymer will be provided in about a 1-30%,<br>
preferably about a 2-15%, more preferably about a 3-10% and most preferably, about a 4-6%<br>
solution, in organic solvent The polymer solution is men combined with an aqueous solution and<br>
emulsified to form an o/w emulsion. The aqueous solution can be, for example, deionized water,<br>
normal saline, or a buffered solution such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or a sodium<br>
citrate/etirylenediammetetraacetic acid (sodium ritrate/ETDA) buffer solution. Preferably, the<br>
volume ratio of polymer solution to aqueous liquid ranges from about 5:1 to about 20:1, more<br>
preferably about 10:1. Emulsification is conducted using any equipment appropriate for this task,<br>
and is typically a high-shear device such as, e.g., an homogenizes<br>
A volume of the o/w emulsion is then optionally preferably combined with a larger volume<br>
of an aqueous solution, which preferably contains a canonic, anionic, or nonionic detergent. The<br>
volume ratio of aqueous solution to o/w emulsion typically ranges from about 2:1 to 10:1, more<br>
typically about 4:1. Examples of anionic, canonic and nonionic detergents "appropriate for the .<br>
practice of the invention are listed above and include SDS, CTAB and PVA, respectively. Certain<br>
macromolecules may adsorb more readily to microparticles having a combination of stabilizers<br>
and/or detergents, for example, a combination of PVA and DOTAP. Moreover, in some instances,<br>
it may be desirable to add detergent to the above organic solution. Where a nonionic detergent<br>
such as PVA an emulsion, stabilizer is used, it is typically provided in about a 2-15% solution, more<br>
typicalry about a 4-10% solution Where a cationic or anionic detergent is used, it is typically<br>
provided in about a 0.05-5% solution, more typically about a 0.25-1% solution Generally, a<br>
weight to weight detergent to polymer ratio in me range of fromabout 0.00001:1 to about 0.5:1<br>
will be used, more preferabry from about 0.0001:1 to about 0.5:1, more preferably fromabout<br>
0.001:1 to about 0.5:1, and even more preferably from about 0.005:1 to about 0.5:1.<br>
The mixture is then homogenized to produce a stable w/o/w double emulsion Organic<br>
solvents are then evaporated. The formulation parameters can be manipulated to allow the<br>
preparation of small microparticles on the order of 0.05 urn (50 nm) to larger microparticles 50 urn<br>
or even larger. See, e.g., Jefiery et al, Pharm. Res. (1993) 10:362-368; McGee et al, J.<br>
Microencap. (1996). For example, reduced agitation results in larger microparticles, as does an<br><br>
increase in internal phase volume. Small particles are produced by low aqueous phase volumes<br>
with high concentrations of emulsion stabilizers.<br>

Particle size can be determined by, e.g., laser light scattering, using for example, a<br>
spectrometer incorporating a helium-neon laser. Generally, particle size is determined at room<br>
temperature and involves multiple analyses of the sample in question (e.g., 5-10 times) to yield an<br>
average value for toe particle diameter. Particle size is also readily determined using scanning<br>
electron microscopy (SEM).<br>
Alternative embodiments of the present invention utilize nricroparticle preparations<br>
comprising a submicron emulsion, which preferably includes an ionic surfactant For instance,<br>
MF59 or others may be used as the base oil-containing submicron emulsion, while ionic surfactants<br>
may include, but are not limited to, ttokoyl-3-Trimethylammonium-Propane (DOTAP), Dioleoyl-<br>
sn-Grycerch3-Bthylphosphocholine(DEPC) and dioleoyl-phosphatidic acid (DPA), each of which<br>
are soluble in squalene. Prototypic ionic emulsions may be formulated by dissolving each of the<br><br>
detergents in squalene/10% Span 85 at concentrations ranging from 4-52 mg/ml squalene. Tie<br>
squalene/surfactant mixrures may be emulsified with 0.5% Tween 80/H2O at 5ml squalene/100 ml<br>
H2O. A pre-emulsion may be formed by bomogenization with a Silverson homogenizer (5<br>
minutes, 5000 RPM) and final emulsions may be made by rnicrofhridization (~10,000psi, 5 passes,<br>
MiCTofluidizer 110S). Additional discussion concerning submicron emulsions can be found infra.<br>
Following preparation, micropartides can be stored as is or freeze-dried for future use.<br>
Typically, in order to adsorb macromolecules to the micropartides, the microparticle preparation is<br>
simply mixed with the macromolecule of interest and the resulting formulation can again be<br>
ryopbilized prior to use. Generally, macromolecules are added to the microparticles to yield<br>
microparticles with adsorbed macromolecules having a weight to weight ratio of from about<br>
0.0001:1 to 0.25:1 macromolecules to microparticles, preferably, 0.001:1 to 0.1, more preferably<br>
0.01 to 0.05. Macromolecule content of the microparticles can be determined using standard<br>
techniques.<br>
As noted above, macromolecules for use in connection with the present invention include<br>
proteins, preferably antigen molecules, and nucleic acids, preferably vector constructs capable of<br>
expressing a nucleic acid sequence, such as CMV-based vectors, ELVIS vectors or RNA vector<br>
constructs.<br>
The polymer microparticles of the present invention may have macromolecules entrapped<br>
or encapsulated within them, as weD as having macromolecules adsorbed thereon Thus, for<br>
example, one of skill in the art may prepare n accordance with the invention microparticles having<br>
encapsulated adjuvants with ELVIS vector adsorbed thereon, or microparticles having<br>
encapsulated antigen with RNA vector construct adsorbed thereon The invention contemplates a<br>
variety of combinations of nucleic acid macromolecules adsorbed on and entrapped within<br>
microparticles, along with other nucleic acids as well as other antigenic molecules. In some<br>
preferred embodiments, the microparticles of the invention have ELVIS vectors or RNA vector<br>
constructs adsorbed thereon.<br>
Additionally, any of the embodiments of the microparticles of the invention may be<br>
delivered in conjunction with electroporation.<br>
Once the macromolecule-adsorbed microparticles and/or submicron emulsion<br>
microparticles are produced, they are formulated, along with any desired adjuvants, into<br><br>
pharmaceutical compositions mrinrling vaccines, to treat, prevent and/or diagnose a wide variety of<br>
disorders, as described above. The compositions will generally include one or more<br>
phannaceutically acceptable exdpients. For example, vehicles such as water, saline, glycerol,<br>
pofyethylene-grycol, hyaluronic acid, ethanol, etc. may be used. Other exdpients such as wetting<br>
or emulsifying agents, biological buffering substances, and the like, may be present in such vehicles.<br>
A biological buffer can be virtually any solution which is pharmacologically acceptable and which<br>
provides the formulation with the desired pH, ie., a pH in the physiological range. Examples of<br>
buffer solutions include saline, phosphate buffered saline, Tris buffered saline, Hank's buffered<br>
saline, and the like. Other excipients known in the art can also be introduced into me finaldosage<br>
form, including binders, dismf egrants, fillers (diluents), lubricants, gKdanis (flow enhancers),<br>
compression aids, colors, sweeteners, preservatives, suspensing/dispersing agents, film<br>
formers/coatings, flavors and printing inks.<br>
The compositions of the invention will comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one<br>
or more macromolecules of interest That is, an amount of rnacromolecule/microparticle will be<br>
included in the compositions, which will cause the subject to produce a sufficient response, in order<br>
to prevent, reduce, eliminate or diagnose symptoms. The exact amount necessary will vary,<br>
depending on the subject being treated; the age and general condition of the subject to be treated;<br>
the severity of the condition being treated; in the case of an immunological response, the capacity<br>
of the subject's immune system to synthesize antibodies; the degree of protection desired and the<br>
particular antigen selected and its mode of administration, among other factors. An appropriate<br>
effective amount can be readily determined by one of skill in the art. Thus, a therapeutically<br>
effective amount will fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials.<br>
For example, for purposes of the present invention, where the macromolecule is : polynucleotide,<br>
an effective dose will typically range from about 1 ng to about 10 rug, more preferably from about<br>
10 ng to about 1 mg, and most preferably about 100 ug to about 1 rag of the macromolecule<br>
delivered per dose; where the macromolecule is an «"tigfn. an effective dose will typically range<br>
from about 1 ugto about 100 rng, more preferably from about 10 ug to about 1 mg, and most<br>
preferably about 50 ug to about 1 mg of the macromolecule delivered per dose.<br>
Once formulated, the compositions of the invention can be administered parenteralfy, e.g.,<br>
by injection. The con^osftions can be injected either subcutaneousry, intraperitoneaDy,<br><br>
intravenously or intramuscularly. Other modes of administration include nasal, mucosal, rectal,<br>
vaginal, oral and pulmonary administration, suppositories, and transdermal or transcutaneous<br>
applications. Dosage treatment may be a single dose schedule or a multiple dose schedule. A<br>
multiple dose schedule is one in which a primary course of administration may be with 1-10<br>
separate doses, followed by other doses given at subsequent time intervals, chosen to maintain<br>
and/or reinforce the therapeutic response, for example at 1-4 months for a second dose, and if<br>
needed, a subsequent dose(s) after several months.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, a series of one or more injections of a vector<br>
construct (which comprises a heterologous nucleic acid sequence encoding an antigen) is followed<br>
by a series of one or more injections of antigen (also referred to herein as "boosts"). As a specific'<br>
example, the vector construct may be administered in three injections: (a) at a time of initial<br>
administration, (b) at a time period ranging 1-8 weeks from the initial administration, and (c) at a<br>
time period ranging 4-32 weeks from the initial administration, while the antigen may be<br>
administered in two injections: (a) at a time period ranging from 8-50 weeks from the initial<br>
administration and (b) at a time period ranging from 8-100 weeks from the initial administration.<br>
The dosage regimen will also, at least in part, be determined by the need of the subject and<br>
be dependent on the judgment of the practitioner.<br>
Furthermore, if prevention of disease is desired, the microparticles with adsorbed vector<br>
constructs are generally administered prior to primary infection with the pathogen of interest If<br>
treatment of disease (other than prevention) is desired, e.g., the reduction of symptoms or<br>
recurrences, the microparticles with adsorbed vector constructs are generally administered<br>
subsequent to primary infection.<br>
2 Oil Droplet Krniiljamiy<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, an oil droplet emulsion (particularly, a<br>
subnxcron emulsion) is prepared comprising a metabolizable oil and an emulsifying agent.<br>
Molecules such as an oligonucleotide comprising at least one CpG motif may be combined with the<br>
oil droplet emulsion to form an adjuvant<br>
The oil droplet emulsion preferably comprises a metabolizable oil and an emulsifying agent,<br>
wherein the oil and the emulsifying agent are present in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion having<br><br>
oil droplets substantially all of which are less than one micron in diameter. Suhrrdcron emulsions,<br>
with droplets in this preferred size range, show a surprising superiority over other emulsions<br>
containing oil and emulsifying agents in which the oil droplets are significantly larger than those<br>
provided by the present invention. In preferred embodiments, the emulsion is positively charged as<br>
a result of a cationic detergent being used as the emulsifying agent or, alternatively, contains a<br>
canonic detergent in addition to the emulsifying agent This allows for the adsorption of<br>
nucleotide antigenic molecules, such as CpG oligonucleotides or vector constructs.. Alternatively,<br>
the use of an anionic detergent allows for the adsorption of molecules such as proteins.<br>
Although individual components of the submicron emulsion compositions of the present<br>
invention are generally known, such compositions have not been combined in the same mariner.<br>
Accordingly, the individual components, although described below both generally and in some<br>
detail for preferred embodiments, are well known in the art, and the terms used herein, such as<br>
metabolizable oil, emulsifying agent, imrnunostimulating agent, muranryl peptide, and lipophilic<br>
muramyl peptide, are sufficiently well known to describe these compounds to one skilled in the art<br>
without further description.<br>
One component of these compositions is a metabolizable, non-tone oil, preferably one of<br>
about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms including, but not limited to, alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and their<br>
corresponding acids and alcohols, the ethers and esters thereof, and mixtures thereof The oil can<br>
be any vegetable oil, fish oil, animal oil or synthetically prepared oil which can be metabolized by<br>
the body of the host animal to which the adjuvant will be administered and which is not toxic to the<br>
subject The host animal is typically a mammal, and preferabry a human. Mineral oil and similar<br>
toxic petroleum distillate oils are expressly excluded from this invention.<br>
The oil component of this invention c -in also be any long chain alkane, alkene or alkyne, or<br>
an acid or alcohol derivative thereof either as the free acid, its salt or an ester such as a mono-, or<br>
di- or triester, such as the triglycerides and esters of 1,2-propanediol or similar poly-hydroxy<br>
alcohols. Alcohols can be acylated employing amino- or poly-functional acid, for example acetic<br>
acid, propanoic acid, citric acid or the like. Ethers derived from long chain alcohols which are oils<br>
and meet the other criteria set forth herein can also be used.<br>
The individual alkane, alkene or alkyne moiety and its acid or alcohol derivatives will<br>
generally have about 6 to about 30 carbon atoms. The moiety can have a straight or branched<br><br>
chain structure. It can be fully saturated or have one or more double or triple bonds. Where mono<br>
or poly ester- or ether-based oils are employed, the limitation of about 6 to about 30 carbons<br>
applies to the individual fatty acid or fatty alcohol moieties, not the total carbon count<br>
Any metaboKzable oil, particularly from an animal, fish or vegetable source, can be used<br>
herein. It is essential that the oil be metabolized by the host to winch it is administered, otherwise<br>
the oil component can cause abscesses, granulomas or even carcinomas, or (when used in<br>
veterinary practice) can make the meat of vaccinated birds and animals unacceptable for human<br>
consumption due to the deleterious effect the unmetabolized oil can have on the consumer.<br>
For a detailed description of such submicron emulsions, see International Publication No.<br>
WO 90/14837, and commonly owned Intemational Patent Application PCT/USOO/03331.<br>
The oil component of these adjuvants and immunogenic compositions will be present in an<br>
amount from about 0.5% to about 20% by volume but preferably no more than about 15%,<br>
especially in an amount of about 1% to about 12%. It is most preferred to use from about 1% to<br>
about 4% ofl.<br>
The aqueous portion of these submicron emulsion compositions is preferably buffered<br>
saline or, more preferably, unadulterated water. Because these compositions are intended for<br>
parenteral administration, it is preferable to make up final buffered solutions used as immunogenic<br>
compositions so that the tonicity, Le., osmolality, is essentially the same as normal physiological<br>
fluids in order to prevent post-administration swelling or rapid absorption of the composition<br>
because of differential ion concentrations between the composition and physiological fluids It is<br>
also preferable to buffer the saline in order to maintain pH compatible with normal physiological<br>
conditions. Also, in certain instances, it can be necessary to maintain the pH at a particular level in<br>
order to ensure the stability of certain composition components such as the grycopeptides.<br>
Any physiologically acceptable buffer can be used herein, but phosphate buffers are<br>
preferred. Other acceptable buffers such acetate, tris, bicarbonate, carbonate, or the like can bs<br>
used as substitutes for phosphate buffers. The pH of the aqueous component will preferably be<br>
between about 6.0-8.0.<br>
When the submicron emulsion is initially prepared, however, unadulterated water is<br>
preferred as the aqueous component of the emulsion. Increasing the salt concentration makes it<br>
more difficult to achieve the desired small droplet size. When the final immunogenic compositions<br><br>
is prepared from the adjuvant, the antigenic material can be added in a buffer at an appropriate<br>
osmolality to provide the desired immunogenic compositioa<br>
The quantity of the aqueous component employed in these compositions will be that<br>
amount necessary to bring the value of the composition to unity. That is, a quantity of aqueous<br>
component sufficient to make 100% will be mixed, with the other components listed above, in<br>
order to faring the compositions to volume.<br>
A substantial number of emulsifying and suspending agents are generally used in the<br>
pharmaceutical sciences. These include naturally derived materials such as gums from trees,<br>
vegetable protein, sugar-based polymers such as alginates and cellulose, and the hke. Certain.<br>
oxypolymers or polymers having a hydroxide or other hydropmhc substituent on the carbon<br>
backbone have surfactant activity, for example, povidone, polyvinyl alcohol, and glycol ether-based<br>
mono- and poly-functional compounds. Long chain fatry-acid-derived compounds form a third<br>
substantial group of emulsifying and suspending agents which could be used in this inventioa Any<br>
of the foregoing surfactants are useful so long as they are non-toxic.<br>
Specific examples of suitable emulsifying agents (also referred to as surfactants or<br>
detergents) which can be used in accordance with the present invention are disclosed in commonly<br>
owned International patent application PCT/US00/0331. Surfactants are generally divided into<br>
four basic types: anionic, canonic, zwitterionic, and nonionic. Examples of anionic detergents<br>
include, but are not limited to, alginic acid, capryUc acid, choke acid, 1-decanesulfonic acid,<br>
deoxycholic acid, 1-dodecanesulfonic acid, N-lauroylsarcosme, and taurocholic acid, and the like.<br>
Canonic detergents include, but are not limited to, cerrimide (hexadecytairfletbylaramnium<br>
bromide, or CTAB), benzalkomum chloride, dimethyl dioctodecyl ammonium (DDA) bromide,<br>
DCT AP, dodecyhriinemylamrnonhim bromide, benzyldimethylhexadecyl ammonium chloride,<br>
cetylpyridinium chloride, methylbenzethonium chloride, and 4-picoline dodecyl sulfate, and the<br>
like. Examples of zwitterionic detergents include, but are not limited to, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-<br>
dnnemylammonio]-I-propanesulfonate (commonly abbreviated CHAPS), 3-[(choIamidopropyi)--<br>
dimiemylaminomo]-2-hydroxy-l-propanesulfonate (generafly abbreviated CHAPSO) N-dodecyl-<br>
N.N-diniethyl-3-ammonio-l-propanesulfonate, and ryso-a-phosphaudylcholine, and the like.<br>
Examples of nonionic detergents include, but are not limited to, decanoyl-N-methylglucamide,<br>
diethylene glycol monopenryl ether, n-dodecyl p^D-ghicopyranoside, ethylene oxide condensates of<br><br>
fatty alcohols (e.g., sold under the trade name Lubrol), polyoxyethylene ethers of fatty acids<br>
(particularly CM-CM fatty acids), polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ethers (e.g., sold under the<br>
trade name Tween), and sorbitan fatty acid ethers (e.g., sold under the trade name Span), and the<br>
like.<br>
A particularly useful group of surfactants are the sorbitan-based non-ionic surfactants, such<br>
as the commercialr/ available SPAN® or ARLACEL®, usually with a letter or number designation<br>
which distinguishes between the various mono-, di- and triester substituted sorbrtans. A related<br>
group of surfactants comprises polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoesters and polyoxyethylene sorbitan<br>
triesters, commercialry available under the mark TWEEN®. The TWEEN® surfactants can be<br>
combined with a related sorbitan monoester or triester surfactants to promote emulsion stability.<br>
The size of the oil droplets can be varied by changing the ratio of detergent to oil<br>
(increasing the ratio decreases droplet size, operating pressure (increasing operating pressure<br>
reduces droplet size), temperature (increasing temperature decreases droplet size), and adding an<br>
amphipathic hnmunostnrnilating agent (adding such agents decreases droplet size). Actual droplet<br>
size will vary with the particular detergent, oil, and immtmosthnulatizig agent (if any) and with the<br>
particular operating conditions selected. Droplet size can be verified by use of sizing instruments,<br>
such as the commercial Sub-Micron Particle Analyzer (Model N4MD) manufactured by the<br>
Coulter Corporation, and the parameters can be varied using the guidelines set forth above until<br>
substantially all droplets are less than 1 micron in diameter, preferably less than 0.8 microns in<br>
diameter, and most preferably less than 0.5 microns in diameter. By substantially all is meant at<br>
least about 80% (by number), preferably at least about 90%, more preferabry at least about 95%,<br>
and most preferabry at feast about 98%. The particle size distribution is typically Gaussian, so that<br>
the average diameter is smaller than the stated limits.<br>
A preferred oil droplet emulsion is MF59. MF59 can be made according to the procedures<br>
described in, for example, (Metal, Vaccine Design: The Submit And Adjuvant Approach, 1995,<br>
MR Powell and M.J. Newman, Eds., Plenum Press, New York, p. 277-296; Singh et al, Vaccine,<br>
1998,16,1822-1827; Ott etal, Vaccine, 1995,13,1557-1562; and Valensi etal, J. Immunol,<br>
1994,153,4029-39, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Other oil droplet emulsions include, for example, SAF, comaining 10% Squalane, 0.4%<br>
Tween 80, 5% pluronic-blocked polymer L121, and thr-MDP either microfluidized into a<br><br>
submicron emulsion 01 vortexed to generate a larger particle size emulsion, and Ribi® adjuvant<br>
system (RAS), (Ribi Imrnunochem, Hamton, MT) containing 2% Squalene, 0.2% Tween 80, and<br>
one or more bacterial cell wall components from the group consisting of monophosphorylipid A<br>
(MPL), trehalose dimycolate (TDM), and cell wall skeleton (CWS), preferably MPL + CWS<br>
(DetoxJ) (for a further discussion of suitable submicron oil-in-water emulsions for use herein, see<br>
commonly owned, patent application no. 09/013,736, filed on January 29,1998).<br>
After preparing the microparticles of the invention, whether of the polymer type or the<br>
submicron emulsion type, macromolecules such as polypeptides and vector constructs may be<br>
adsorbed thereto as previously discussed. The submicron emulsion microparticles of the present<br>
invention may also have macromolecules entrapped or encapsulated within them, as well as having<br>
macromolecules adsorbed thereon. Thus, for example, one of skill in the art may prepare in<br>
accordance with the invention microparticles having encapsulated adjuvants with ELVIS vector<br>
adsorbed thereon,, or microparticles having encapsulated antigen with RNA vector construct<br>
adsorbed thereon. The invention contemplates a variety of combinations of nucleic acid<br>
macromolecules adsorbed on and entrapped within microparticles, along with other nucleic acids as<br>
well as other antigenic molecules. Preferably, the microparticles of the invention have ELVIS<br>
vectors or RNA vector constructs adsorbed thereon Additionally, any of the embodiments of the<br>
microparticles of the invention may be delivered in conjunction with electroporaaon.<br>
3. ELVIS vectors<br>
ELVIS vectors are Eukaryotic Layered Vector Initiation Systems, which are generally<br>
described in U.S. Patents 5,814,482 and 6,015,686, cited above, as well as in International Patent<br>
Applications WO 97/38087 and WO 99/18226. In one embodiment, an ELVIS vector is derived<br>
from the genome of an abphavirus, more preferably from Sindbis virus (SIN), SemlM Forest virus<br>
(SFV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE), or Ross River virus (RRV). The alphavirus is<br>
an RNA virus of approximately 11-12 kb in length, which contains a 5' cap and a 3' polyadenylate<br>
taiL The mature infectious virus is composed of the genomic RNA enveloped by the nucleocapsid<br>
and envelope proteins. Alphavirus infection of host cefls occurs by a receptor specific event and<br>
culminates in release of genomic RNA into the cytoplasm During viral replication, the viral-<br><br>
encoded envelope glycoproteins El and E2 are synthesized and embedded in the host cell<br>
membrane, through which progeny virions bud and release to the outside of the host celL<br>
Replication of the viral genome begins with the genomic RNA strand serving as the<br>
template for synmesis of a con^ementary negative RNA strand. The negative RNA strand then<br>
serves as a template for full-length genomic RNA, and for an intenialfyininsrted positive-strand<br>
subgenotmc RNA Tte nonstructural proteins are translated from the genomic strand, while lie<br>
structural proteins are translated from the subgaaomic strand. All the viral genes are expressed<br>
first as polyproteins, then post-translalionauy processed into individual proteins by proteolytic<br>
cleavage.<br>
An alphavirus vector replicon may be buQt by replacing certain portions of the viral genome<br>
(e.g., structural protein genes) with a selected heterologous nucleic acid sequence. Thus, in certain<br>
embodiments, an alphavirus replicon vector may comprise a 5' sequence capable of initiating<br>
transcription of an alphavirus, a nucleotide sequence encoding the alphavirus nonstructural<br>
proteins, an alphaviral junction region promoter, an alphavirus RNA polymerase recognition site,<br>
and a 3' polyadenylate tract Additionally, the alphavirus vector replicon may be contained as a<br>
cDNA copy within an alphavirus vector construct Such vector constructs typically comprise a 5'<br>
promoter capable of initiating synthesis of RNA from cDNA positioned upstream and operabty<br>
associated with the vector cDNA, such mat transcription produces the vector replicon RNA The<br>
vector construct also may contain and a 3' sequence controlling transcription termination. A<br>
heterologous nucleic acid sequence may be present upstream or downstream of the viral junction<br>
regkm.<br>
The ELVIS vector capitalizes on the mechanism of RNA virus replication to achieve<br>
delivery of a heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest by using a double-layered approach (for<br>
example, based on the above-described alphavirus vector construct). In gsueral, an ELVIS vector<br>
provides a layered expression system capable of amplifying the amount of RNA encoding the gene<br>
product of interest because the first layer initiates transcription of a second layer. Thus, a typical<br>
ELVIS vector comprises a 5' promoter capable of initiating synthesis of RNA from cDNA, a<br>
cDNA complement of a construct capable of autonomous replication in a cell, and which construct<br>
is also capable of expressing a heterologous nucleic acid sequence, and a 3' sequence controlling<br>
transcription termination. The construct capable of autonomous replication and expression of the<br><br>
selected nucleic acid sequence may be an alphavirus vector construct Thus, the first layer of the<br>
DNA ELVIS vector transcribes the RNA atyhavirus vector construct, from which expression of<br>
the selected heterologous nucleic acid sequence is achieved.<br>
An alphavirus-based ELVIS vector may be constructed by first preparing a cDNA<br>
cornplernentary to an alphavirus genome. ThecDNA corresponding to the genomic RNA is then<br>
. . deleted of sequences encoding one or more viral structuralr/roteins which men may be replaced<br>
with heterologous DNA encoding the gene-product of iiterest, thereby preventing packaging of<br>
mature virus and —«Hinj&gt; amplification of the heterologous sequence. The modified cDNA<br>
containing the heterologous sequence is then inserted within the first layer of the ELVIS vector.<br>
Upon entry into the cell and nucleus, the ELVIS vector will be transcribed and the resulting mRNA<br>
molecules, which are RNA vectors capable of self-replication, will begin to replicate and translate<br>
polypeptides, including the heterologous gene of interest<br>
While atypical Sindbis-derived alphavirus vector construct is preferred, other alphavirus<br>
species may be readily used according to the teachings provided herein. Alternatively, vectors<br>
derived from any RNA virus may be utilized, particularly those from positive-stranded viruses.<br>
The construction of an ELVIS vector, in general, is described in U.S. Patents 5,814,482<br>
and 6,015,686. Briefly, RNA is obtained from an SNA virus, then cDNA is synthesized by PCR<br>
amplification using appropriate primers for particular genes or portions of the RNA virus, which<br>
primers may also contain additional restriction sites as necessary. The cDNA fragments are then<br>
cloned into a plasmid and transformed into an appropriate host such as E. coli. Positive colonies<br>
are grown for plasmid purification, and then plasmids are assembled into the desired ELVIS vector<br>
with a portion having heterologous DNA such as a reporter gene (e.g., GFP) or a desired gene<br>
coding for an antigen. Example 3 below describes a pjticular preferred ELVIS vector (pSINCP)<br>
used in accordance with the instant invention.<br>
4. RNA and pCMV vector constructs<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, an RNA vector construct or RNA replicon<br>
vector is used directly, without file requirement for introduction of DNA into a cell and transport<br>
to the nucleus where transcription would occur. By using the RNA vector for direct delivery into<br>
the cytoplasm of the host cell, autonomously replication and translation of the heterologous nucleic<br><br>
acid sequence occurs efficiently. In this embodiment, the RNA vector construct or RNA rephcon<br>
vector is obtained by in vitro transcription from a DNA-based vector construct Preferably, Hie<br>
RNA vector construct or RNA replicon vector is derived from the genome of an alphavirus, more<br>
preferably from Sindbis virus (SIN), Semtilri Forest virus (SFV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis<br>
virus (VEE), or Ross River virus (RRV). In other embodimeDts, me RNA vector construct is<br>
derived from a vinis other than an alphavirus. Preferably, such other viruses used for the<br>
derivation of RNA vector constructs are positive-stranded RNA viruses, and more preferably they<br>
are picomaviruses, fkvrvimses, rotaviruses, or coronaviruses. Conyositioris and methods for in<br>
vitro transcription of alphavmis-based RNA vectors is provided in detail elsewhere (see U.S.<br>
Patent 5,842,723 and Roto et aL, 1999, PNAS 96:4598-603). The RNA vector is men adsorbed to<br>
a nicroparticle of the invention for delivery as detailed herein 'While a typical alphavirus RNA<br>
vector from SIN, SFV, VEE or RRV is preferred, similar vectors derived from other alphavirus<br>
species may be readily substituted.<br>
In other embodiments of the present invention, pCMV vector constructs are used. Such<br>
vector constructs are well known in the art A particularly preferred pCMV vector contains the<br>
jmrnftrtintft-mirly anhanrar/pmmntBr of P.MV and a hnvfne growth hnrmrmfi terminatnr It is<br>
described in detail in Chapman, B. S., et aL 1991. "Effect of nitron A from human cytomegalovirus<br>
(Towne) immediate-early gene on heterologous expression in nwrnrratian cells." Nucleic Adds<br>
Res. 19:3979-86.<br>
S Adjuvants<br>
Adjuvants may optionally be used to enhance the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, wnh Thl stimulating adjuvants being particularly preferred. The adjuvants may be<br>
administered concurrently with the microparticles of the present invention, e.g., in the same<br>
composition or in separate compositions. Alternatively, an adjuvant may be administered prior or<br>
subsequent to the micropartide compositions of the present invention In another embodiment, the<br>
adjuvant, such as an immunological adjuvant, may be encapsulated in the nicroparticle. Adjuvants,<br>
just as any macromolecules, may be encapsulated within the microparticles using any of the several<br>

microparticle compositions described herein.<br>
6. Antigens<br>
The present invention is also directed to immunogenic compositions comprising the<br>
microparticles described above with adsorbed macromolecules, preferably vector constructs<br>
encoding antigens and/or antigen per se. Generally, an antigen stimulates the proliferation of T-<br><br>
lymphocytes, preferably Thl rymphocytes, with receptors for the antigen and can react with die<br>
lymphocytes to initiate the series of responses designated {^-mediated immunity. An antigen may<br>
thus induce a CTL response, and/or a humoral response, and may induce cytokine production.<br>
An epitope is within the scope of mis definition of antigen. An epitope is that portion of an<br>
antigenic molecule or antigenic complex that determines its immunological specificity. Commonly,<br>
an epitope is a peptide or polysaccharide in naturally occurring antigens. In artificial antigens it can<br>
be a low molecular weight substance such as anarsauflic acid derivative. An epitope win react<br>
specifically in vivo or in vitro with homologous antibodies or T rymphocytes. Alternative<br>
descriptors are antigenic determinant, antigenic structural grouping and haptenic grouping.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the antigenic substance is derived from a virus<br>
such as, for example, human irnmunodeficiency virus (HTV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C<br>
virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza virus (flu), and<br>
rabies virus. Preferably, the antigenic substance is selected from the group consisting of HSV<br>
grycoprotehi gD , HTV glycoprotein gp!20, HTV p55 gag, and polypeptides fromThe pol and tat<br>
regions. In other preferred embodiments of the invention, the antigenic substance is derived from a<br>
bacterium such as, for example, Helicobacter pylori, Haemophilus influenza, cholera, diphtheria,<br>
tetanus, Neisseria meningitidis, and pertussis, m other preferred embodiments of the invention,<br>
thp antigmjr. siihstanpe V from a parasite such as, for example, a malaria parasite In another<br>
preferred ernlwdnnent of the present invention, the antigen is adsorbed to the surface of a<br>
microparticle of the present invention.<br>
Antigens can be produced by methods known in the art or can be purchased from<br>
commercial sources. Antigens within the scope of this invention include whole inactivated virus<br>
particles, isolated virus proteins and protein subunits, whole cells and bacteria, cell membrane and<br>
cell wall proteins, and the like. Some preferred antigens are described below.<br>
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) rgD2 is a recombinant protein produced in genetically<br>
engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells. This protein has the normal anchor region truncated,<br>
resulting in a glycosylated protein secreted into tissue culture medium The gD2 can be purified in<br>
the CHO medium to greater than 90% purity. Human immunodeficiency virus (HTV) env-2-3 is a<br>
recombinant form of the HTV enveloped protein produced in genetically engineered<br>
Saccharomyces cerevisae. This protein represents the entire protein region of HTV gpl20 but is<br><br>
non-grycosylated and denatured as purified from the yeast HTV gpl20 is a fully glycosylated,<br>
secreted form of gpl20 produced in CHO cells in a fashion similar to the gD2 above. Additional<br>
HSV antigens suitable for use in immunogenic compositions are described in PCT Publications WO<br>
85/04587 and WO 88/02634, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their<br>
entirety. Mixtures of gB and gD antigens, which are truncated surface antigens lacking the anchor<br>
regions, are particularly preferred<br>
Additional HTV antigens suitable for use in immunogenic compositions are described in<br>
U.S. applications serial no. 490,858, filed March 9,1990, and published European application<br>
number 181150 (May 14,1986), as well as U.S. applications serial nos. 60/168,471; 09/475,515;<br>

Hepatitis C antigens suitable for use in immunogenic compositions are described in<br>
PCT/US88/04125, published European application number 318216 (May 31,1989), published<br>
Japanese application number 1-500565 filed November 18,1988, Canadian application 583,561,<br>
and EPO 388,232, disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. A<br>
different set of HCV antigens is described in European patent application 90/302866.0, filed March<br>
16,1990, and U.S. application serial number 456,637, filed December 21,1989, and<br>
PCTVUS90/01348, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Immunogenic compositions of the invention can be used to imrmmi7f! birds and mammals<br>
against diseases and infection, mrrnHing without limitation cholera, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis,<br>
influenza, measles, meningitis, mumps, plague, poliomyelitis, rabies, Rocky Mountain spotted<br>
fever, nibella, smallpox, typhoid, typhus, feline leukemia virus, and yellow fever.<br>
Certain immunogenic compositions of the invention wul employ an effective amount of an<br>
antigen. For example, there miry be included an amount of antigen which, in combination with an<br>
adjuvant, will cause the subject to produce a specific and sufficient immunological response, so as<br><br>
to impart protection to the subject from the subsequent exposure to a virus, bacterium, fungus,<br>
mycoplasma, or parasite.<br>
In other embodiments, a composition comprising an antigen will be used to boost the<br>
immunological response of a previously administered vector construct, which preferably comprises<br>
a heterologous nucleic acid sequence mat encodes the antigen. More preferably, the antigen is<br>
associated with (e.g., adsorbed to) the miaoparticles described herein and/or the antigen is<br>
coadministered with an adjuvant.<br>
No single dose designation can be assigned which will provide specific guidance for each<br>
and every antigen which can be employed in this invention. The effective amount of antigen will be<br>
a function of its inherent activity and purity and is empirically determined by those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art via routine experimentation. It is contemplated that the adjuvant compositions of this<br>
invention can be used in conjunction with whole cell or viral immunogenic compositions as well as<br>
with purified antigens or protein submit or peptide immunogenic compositions prepared by<br>
recombinant DNA techniques or synthesis.<br>
Where the antigen is provided in connection with an emulsion, because the adjuvant<br>
compositions of the invention are stable, the antigen and emulsion can typically be mixed by simple<br>
shaking. Other techniques, such as passing a mixture of the adjuvant and solution or suspension of<br>
the antigen rapidly through a small opening (such as a hypodermic needle), readily provide a useful<br>
immunogenic composition.<br>
The immunogenic compositions according to the present invention comprise about 1<br>
nanogram to about 1000 micrograms of nucleic acid, preferably DNA such as, for example, CpG<br>
oligonucleotides. In some preferred embodiments, the immunogenic compositions contain about<br>
10 nanograms to about 800 micrograms of nucleic acid. In some preferred embodiments, the<br>
immunogenic compositions contain about 0.1 to about 500 micrograms of nucleic acid. In some<br>
preferred embodiments, the immunogenic compositions contain about 1 microgram to about 10<br>
milligrams of nucleic acid. In some preferred embodiments, the immunogenic compositions<br>
contain about 250 micrograms to about 1 miHifiram of nucleic acid. In some preferred<br>
embodiments, the immunogenic compositions contain about 500 micrograms to about 1 milligram<br>
of nucleic acid. One skilled in the art can readily formulate an immunogenic composition<br>
comprising any desired amount of nucleic acid. The immunogenic compositions according to the<br><br>
present invention are provided sterile and pyrogen free. The immunogenic compositions can be<br>
conveniently administered in unit dosage form and can be prepared by any of the methods well<br>
known in the pharmaceutical art, for example, as described in Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences (Mack Pub. Co., Easton, PA, 1980), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety.<br>
Trie present invention is also directfd to i»wrtiiMk "f £*""»Vftiog "&gt; immnnft Taspunsa in a<br>
host animal comprising administering to the animal one or more immunogenic compositions<br>
described above in an amount effective to induce an immune response. The host animal is<br>
preferably a mammal, more preferably a human. Preferred routes of administration include, but axe<br>
not limited to, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial,<br>
inrxaoccular and oral as well as transdermal or by inhalation or suppository. Most preferred routes<br>
of administration include intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal and subcutaneous injection.<br>
According to some embodiments of the present invention, the immunogenic compositions are<br>
administered to a host animal using a needleless injection device, which are well known and widely<br>
available. One having ordinary stall in the art can, following the teachings herein, use needleless<br>
injection devices to deliver immunogenic compositions to cells of an individual. Additionally, the<br>
embodiments of the invention may be delivered together with electroporation.<br>
The present invention is also directed to methods of immunizing a host animal against a<br>
viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection comprising administering to the animal one or more<br>
immunogenic compositions described above in an amount effective to induce a protective response.<br>
The host animal is preferably a manuring more preferably a human. Preferred routes of<br>
administration are described above. WWe prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of the host animal<br>
can be directed to any pathogen, preferred pathogens, including, 1 t not limited to, the viral,<br>
bacterial and parasitic pathogens described above.<br>
The present mvention is also directed to methods of inducing an immune response in a host<br>
animal comprising administering to the animal one or more immunogenic compositions described<br>
above in an amount effective to induce m immune response. The host animal is preferably a<br>
marrmal, more preferably a human. Preferred routes of administration are described above. One<br>
skilled in the art is readily familiar with immune responses and measurements thereof<br><br>
The present invention contemplates the use of polymer rmcroparticles or submicron<br>
emulsion rmcroparticles with adsorbed macromolecule to elicit an immune response alone, or in<br>
combination with another macromolecule. That is, the invention encompasses rmcroparticles with<br>
adsorbed nucleic acid, submicron emulsions with adsorbed nucleic acid or Jmnnnostimiilating<br>
molecule, and the combination of rmcroparticles with adsorbed nucleic acid together with<br>
subrmcron emulsions with adsorbed nucleic acid or rmmmostminlating molecule. Electroporation<br>
may also be used to improve delivery of the nucleic arid.<br>
As demonstrated by the following Examples, the present invention's polymer rmcroparticles<br>
with adsorbed macromolecules elicit strong immune, responses. Additionally, the present<br>
invention's submicron emulsion rmcroparticles also elicit strong immune responses. The<br>
combination of the present invention's rmcroparticles with adsorbed macromolecules is therefore a<br>
powerful tool for eliciting immune responses.<br>

Preparation of Pnhrmnr Mifroparticles with AA^r}m\ fJivlsir. Arid<br>
PLG-CTAB rmcroparticles were prepared using a modified solvent evaporation process.<br>
Briefly, the micioparricles were prepared by emulsifying 10 ml of a 5% w/v polymer solution in<br>
methylene chloride with 1 ml of T.E. buffer at high speed using an EKA homogenizer. The primary<br>
emulsion was then added to 50ml of distilled water containing cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide<br>
(CTAB) (0.5% w/v). This resulted in the formation of a w/o/w emulsion which was stirred at 6000<br><br>
rpm for 12 hours at room temperature, allowing the methylene chloride to evaporate. The resulting<br>
microparticles were washed twice in distilled water by centrifugation at 10,000 g and freeze dried.<br>
For a typical batch of 100 mg of DNA adsorbed microparticles, 100 mg of PLG-CTAB<br>
catkmic microparticles were weighed into a glass vial and resuspended with 5 ml volume of<br>
200ug/ml of DNA solution (Le., meplasmid pCMV or pSINCP containing gpl40 orp55gag) in<br>
T.E. Buffer. The suspension was vortexed for a one minute to uniformly disperse the<br>
microparticles in the DNA solution. The vial was set an a shaker (slow speed) at 4 C for overnight<br>
adsorption. The next day the microparticles were centrifuged down at 8000 rpm on a Beckman<br>
centrifuge for 10 minutes and the supernatant was collected for DNA quantitation. The pellet was<br>
washed once with IX TE buffer by resuspending the pellet in 1 X TE buffer, dispersing with a<br>
spatula and centrifugnig at 8,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The final pellet was resuspended in a<br>
minimum amount of de-ionized water (about 2 ml) by dispersing the pellet with a spatula, and<br>
freeze dried on a bench top ryophflizer (Labconco) for 24 hours.<br>
The supernatant was assayed for DNA content by reading the absorbance at 260 run<br>
Amount of DNA adsorbed on the microparticles was calculated by subtracting the amount in the<br>
supernatant from the total DNA input (1 mg per 100 mg of microparticles. The total load was<br>
estimated by dissolving 5 mg of final formulation in 0.S M NaOH/1% SDS solution and reading the<br>
clear solution after hydrolysis at 260 ma<br>

Preparation of ELVIS Vectors and Other Vector Constructs for Adsorption to Microparticles<br>
Construction of alphavirus-based ELVIS and replicon vectors was performed using Sindbis<br>
virus as a representative example. As will be appreciated, the following may be readily applied to<br>
the derivation of vectors from any alphaviros by one of skill in the art. Approximately 107 BHK-21<br>
cells were infected with the SINDCchiron strain of Sindbis virus (ATCC deposit VR-2643, April<br>
13,1999) at a MOI of 1 PFU/cefl. At 24 hours post-infection, after development of CPE, total<br>
RNA was isolated from the cells using the TRIzol Reagent (GIBCO/BRL) according to the<br>
manufacturer's instructions. After purification, viral RNA was dissolved in nuclease-free water,<br>
aliquoted, and stored at -80°C for subsequent use in cDNA cloning.<br>
Synthesis of cDNA was accomplished by PCR amplification, using the primer sets shown<br>
below (Sindbis nucleotide numbering indicated for each primer):<br><br><br><br>
Primer pairs 1-5 were used for doming of the virus structural protein genes, while pairs 6-<br>
14 were for the virus nonstructural protein genes. Oligonucleotides in pairs 1-5 contained<br>
additional sequences representing restriction eozyae sites for £coJQ and ifi«flll,whidi are not<br>
present in subgenomic RNA of Sindfais virus. Oligonucleotides 6-14 contained sites for Sacl and<br>
Xhol, which are not present in the whole genome of previously sequenced strains of Sindbis virus<br>
(these sites are underlined).<br>
Each reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed in a 50 ul volume using the<br>
SuperscriptO enzyme (GIBCO/BRL), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reaction<br>
mixtures contained the amount of RNA equivalent to 10s cells and 50 prnoles of each primer<br>
shown below.<br>
Maturel: primersl, 3 and 5<br>
Mixture2: primers 2 and 4<br>
Mixture3: primers 6,9 and 12<br>
Mixture4: primers 8,11 and 14<br><br>
RT reactions were frozen and then used subsequently for PCR amplification. PCR<br>
reactions were performed using Vent DNA polymerase (NEB) as recommended by the<br>
manufacturer. Each 50 ul PCR reaction contained 3 pi of RT mixtures described above and 50<br>
pmoles of primers. A total of 14 reactions were performed (Table 1).<br><br>
PCR reactions for fragments 1-5 were performed using the following conditions: 12 cycles<br>
of 95°C for 30 seconds, 56°C for 30 seconds and 74°C for 90 seconds. For fragments 6-14, the<br>
number of cycles was changed from 12 to 15. A small aliquot of each reaction mixture was<br>
analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence of the fragmentsof the expected<br>
size. The remaining reaction mixture was extracted with phenol-chloroform and DNA fragments<br>
were precipitated using ethanoL<br><br>
For cloning, fragments 1-5 were digested with HindHl and EcoBl, and then ligated with<br>
plasmid pRS2 (pUCl 9 with additional restriction sites in polyKnker) treated with the same<br>
enzymes. Fragments 6-14 were digested with Sadl sndXhol and hgated with the same pRS2<br>
plasmid treated with Sad. and Xho\. AH recombinant plasmids were transformed into the £. coli<br>
XL-1 Blue strain (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).<br>
In addition, cDNA clones representing the subgenomic promoter region and 3'-end<br>
nontranslated regions also were generated using the following primer pairs:<br><br>
Positive colonies for each transformation were grown for plasmid purification using a<br>
QIAGEN kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fragments, designated pl-p!4<br>
correspondingry, were then assembled into the appropriate vector configurations.<br>
The construction of a Eukaryotic Layered Vector Initiation System (ELVIS) and an<br>
alphavirus vector construct for in vitro transcription of rephcon vector RNA was accomplished<br>
using the Sindbis virus cDNA clones pl-pl4, plus the subgenomic and 3'-end region fragments as<br>
follows. AaApal-MscI fragment, containing the promoter for SP6 SNA polymerase and start of<br>
the Sindbis virus genomic RNA, was hgated with Ha&amp;Msc\-Xho\ fragment of cloned fragment 14 in<br>
Apd-Xhol digested plasmid pRS2. The resulting plasmid was named pl5. Next, the Sacl-EcoW.<br>
fragment of p8, the EcdSl-Nsil fragment of p7 and the Nsil-Xhol fragment of p6 were Hgated into<br>
Sacl-Xhol digested pRS2. The resulting plasmid was named pi6. Next, the Sacl-Murft fragment<br>
of pl2, theMunl-Nhel fragment of pi 1 and the Nhel-Xhol fragment of plO were ligated into Sacl-<br>
Xkol digested pRS2 plasmid. The resulting plasmid was named pl7. The Apal-ApdLlbagaxaL of<br>
plS sndlheApaU-Xhol fragment of pi 3 then were ligated into Apal-Xhol treated pRS2, resulting<br>
in the plasmid named pl8. Next, IheApal-NsH fragment of pl8 and the JVM-A7u&gt;I fragment of<br>
pl7 were ligated together iaApd-JOiol treated pRS2. The resulting plasmid was named pl9.<br>
Finally, me^paWvrll fragment of pi 9, HieAwlI-SalGl fragment of p9 and the SalQl-Barrim<br><br>
fragment of pl6 were ligated together into a previously constructed Sindbis replicon vector<br>
expressing the GFP reporter (see Dubensky et aL, J. Virol 70:508-519,1996; Polo et al, 1999,<br>
ibid; and U.S. Patent 5,843,723), that had been digested with^/pal-BamHI to remove the existing<br>
nonstructural protein genes. The resulting Sindbis vector construct, which contains sequences<br>
derived from the SINDCchiron virus strain and also encodes a GFP reporter, was designated<br>
SINCR-GFP (also known as DCSP6SINgfp). Preparation of replicon RNA from mis reporter<br>
construct, as well as Sindbis vector constructs expressing various other heterologous sequences<br>
(e.g., antigens, described in the specification and below) was performed by linearization of the<br>
DNA using Pme\ followed by in vitro transcription using bacteriophage SP6 polymerase as<br>
described previously (Polo et aL, ibid; Dubensky et aL, ibid).<br>
Similarly, the same Sindbis sequences were used for assembly into an alphavirus-based<br>
Eukaryotic Layered Vector Initiation System (see U.S. 5,814,482 and 6,015,686), in which the<br>
transcription of self-amplifying vector RNA takes place directly within ELVIS plasmid DNA-<br>
transfected eukaryotic cells via a eukaryotic promoter (e.g., RNA polymerase 0 promoter). An<br>
ELVIS plasmid DNA, which also expressed GFP reporter, was constructed by replacing Sindbis<br>
virus derived sequences in an existing ELVIS vector with the corresponding SINCR-GFP<br>
sequences from above. Starring with the previously described ELVIS vector pSINl .5 (Hariharan<br>
et aL, J. Virol. 72:950-958,1998), the plasmid backbone first was modified by substituting the<br>
plasmid backbone whh that from pCMVLink (zur Megede et aL, J. Virol. 74:2628-2635,2000)<br>
using two Sad sites found in each plasmid, to generate the intermediate construct known as<br>
ELVIS1.5CB. Next, one of the two Sad sites of ELVIS1.5CB (located adjacent to the SIN 3'-<br>
end) was eliminated by partially digesting with Sad, blunt-ending using T4 DNA polymerase, and<br>
iien Hgating into the modified she, &amp;Pmel linker 5'-GTTTAAAC-3\ The correct plasmid without<br>
the targeted Sad site was designated ELVIS 1.5CBdlSac. This intermediate plasmid then was<br>
prepared for insertion of the new SIN nonstructural protein genes by digestion with Sad and Xhol.<br>
The corresponding nonstructural genes were obtained by PCR amplification from SINCR-GFP<br>
using the oligonucleotide primers<br>
5'CCTATGAGCTCGTTTAGTGAACCGTATTGACGGCGTAGTACACAC (SEQ ED NO:61)<br>
and 5'CCTATCTCGACKJGTGGTGTTGTAGTATTAGTC (SEQ ID NO:62), followed by<br>
digestion with Sad soAXhol, and ligation, to produce the intermediate construct SINCP-Not<br><br>
Finally, one of the two Noll sites present in this construct was eliminated by partial digest and<br>
Klenow fill-in, to leave only one Nod. site in the polylinker. This newly constructed ELVIS vector<br>
was designated SINCP (or pSINCP).<br>
Insertion of heterologous sequences (e.g., antigen-encoding genes) into the SINCR or SINCP<br>
alphavirus vectors is performed primarily by digestion withXhol/Notl oiXhoVXbcA, followed by<br>
ligation with a desired DNA fragment that also has Xhol/NoS. or XhoUXbcAtenmsL Alternatively,<br>
these sites may be blunt-ended or other polylinker sites may be used (or other heterologous<br>
sequences may be replaced) to allow cloning of a greater number of inserts. For example, the<br>
HTV-1 p55gag (SF2 strain) and gpl40 env (SF162 strain) encoding genes were inserted into these<br>
vectors. Specifically, the codon-optimized HTV p55gagmod sequence (see commonly owned U.S.<br>
Patent Application 09/475,515; zur Megede et al, ibid) was inserted by digesting the vectors with<br>
XholiXbdl and figuring in the p55gagmod fragment obtained by digestion with SaWXbaS.. The<br>
resulting vectors were designated SINCR-p55gag and SINCP-p55gag. Similarly, codon-optimized<br>
HTV gpI40 sequences (described in Example 10 and Bamett et aL, 2001. J. ViroL 75:5526-40),<br>
were inserted into both the SINCR and SINCP plasmids to generate the constructs SINCR-gpl40<br>
and SINCP-gpl40. Formulation of ELVIS plasmid DNA (pSINCP) and RNA vector replicons<br>
transcribed in vitro from the SINCR plasmids is performed as described elsewhere in the<br>
Examples.<br>
Example 4<br>
Tmmiifiy.afjnn r&gt;f RpesUS Macaques with<br>
Antigen with pCMV or pSINCP Plasmids<br>
using Aficroparticles or frihmicrnn amnkmns<br>
PLG potymer microparticles and MF59 submicron emulsions were formed as described<br>
above in previous Examples 1 and 2. Groups of microparticles and submicron emulsions were<br>
made in order to analyze the different effects of immunizing rhesus macaques with a plasmid vector<br>
construct, pCMV- gpl40 or pCMV-p55gag (see commonly owned U.S. Patent Application<br>
09/475,515), on microparticles or in a submicron emulsion, as well as comparing the effect of using<br><br>
an ELVIS plasmid, pSINCP-gpl40 or pSINCP-p55gag, constructed as described above. Six<br>
groups of animals were immunized with different formulations as follows:<br>
Group 1 used pCMV- gpl40 and pCMV - p55 gag without microparticles OT submicron<br>
emulsions.<br>
Group 2 used pCMV- gpl40 and pCMV - p55 gag adsorbed on PLG/CTAB<br>
microparticles.<br>
Group 3 used pCMV- gpl40 and pCMV - p55 gag adsorbed to an MF59-DOTAP<br>
submicron emulsion.<br>
Group 4 used pSINCP- gpl40 and pSINCP - p55 gag without microparticles or submicron<br>
emulsions.<br>
Group 5 used pSINCP- gpl40 and pSINCP - p55 gag adsorbed on PLG/CTAB<br>
microparticles.<br>
Group 6, a control, used no antigen, no microparticles, and no submicron emulsions.<br>
For each group of animals, 5 rhesus macaques (only 4 for group 6) were immunized with<br>
sufficient quantities of material such mat the dosage of vector with gpl40 DNA was 1.0 mg each,<br>
and vector containing p55 gag DNA was 03 mg each, except for the control which had none. The<br>
animals were immunized a second time four weeks after the first irnmunizatiori, and a third time 14<br>
weeks after the first immunization. Serum was analyzed at weeks 2 (2wpl), 6 (2wp2), 11-12<br>
weeks (7wp2), and 16 (2wp3). The route of irnmunization was IM TA. FoHowing immunizations,<br>
plasma anri-p55gag and anti-gpl40 IgG titers were measured, the results of which appear below in<br>
Tables 2 and 3 as geometric mean titers.<br><br><br><br><br>
The same animals were also analyzed for lymptoproliferatioa This assay measures specific<br>
proliferation of T cells in vitro in response to restimuMon with antigen. Rhesus macaque<br>
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were purified from heparinized whole blood by<br>
centrifugation on Ficofl-Hypaque gradients. PBMC were cultured at the number of 2 x 10s per<br>
well in flat bottom nricrotiter plates in the presence or absence of 3 rnicrogramsM of purified<br>
recombinant p55gag protein. Six replicate cultures per condition were initiated. After 4 days of<br>
culture tritiated thymidine fl3H]TdR) was added (1 microcurie per well). Cultures were continued<br>
overnight and harvested the following day. Cells were deposited onto glass microfiber filter sheets.<br>
Filter sheets were exposed to scintillation fluid and counted in liquid scintillation counter. For<br>
each condition fHJTdR incorporation, measured as the mean counts per mm (cpm) for the 6<br><br>
replicates was calculated. The results appear below in Table 6. Geometric Mean Stimulation<br>
Index (GMSI) is calculated as counts per minute (cpm) of p55gag stimulated cells divided by cpm<br>
of unstimulated cells, thus, the larger the GMSI, the more positive the result.<br><br>
The same animals were also analyzed for induction of intracellular cytokine production.<br>
This assay measures specific production of cytokines by T ceDs in vitro in response to brief<br>
restirnulationwrth antigen. Rhesus mataque peripheral bteodrnononuclear cells (PBMC) were<br>
purified fromheparumed whole blood by ceotrimgation on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients. Aliquots of<br>
1 x 10* PBMC were stimulated with a pool of synthetic overlapping peptides that span the gag (or<br>
env) protein sequence in the presence of a co-stimulatory anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody.<br>
Brefeldm A was added to allow the accumulation of newly synthesized cytokines within cells.<br>
After overnight incubation PBMC were stained wim commercially available, fhiorescenuy labeled<br>
nonoclonal antibodies for the presence of iraracelodar interferon^ (IFN-TO and tumor necrosis<br>
factor-a (INF-a) and for cell surface CD4 and CD8 markers. Stained cell samples were analyzed<br>
on a flow cytometer and data were acquired tor approximately 50,000 - 100,000 PBMC. The<br>
frequency of cytoldne-posmve cells was determined for each sample using commercially available<br>
software. The results for gpl40 and pSSgag are shown in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. The Tables<br>
show the number of responding animals, where a responder is defined as an animal scoring greater<br>
than 100 CD4 cells per 100,000 expressing TNF-a and EFN- r as measured by intracellular<br>
staining.<br><br><br>
RNA Vector Constructs<br>
RNA vector constructs (e.g., replicons) may be adsorbed to micropartides for delivery of<br>
heterologous nudedc acid sequmces to me cells of animals. The RNA vector construct generaDy<br>
comprises a viral RNA which has had a region of the genomic RNA (e.g., structural protein gene)<br>
replaced with the selected heterologous sequence, derived from the DNA coding sequence tor the<br>
gene-product of interest Representative examples of RNA vector constructs include, but are not<br>
finited to, alphavirus RNA vectors (see for example, US Patent 5843723, PCT publication WO<br>
99A 8226, and Polo et aL, 1999, PNAS 96:4598-4603), picomavirus RNA vectors (see for<br><br>
example, US Patent 6156538, and Vignuzzi et ai, 2001, J Gen ViroL 82:1737-47), fkvivirus RNA<br>
vectors (see for example, Varnavski et al 1999, Virology 255:366-75), and rabivirus RNA vectors<br>
(see for example, Pugachev et ai, 2000, J ViroL 74:10811-5).RNA vector constructs for use in the<br>
present invention generally may be obtained from plasmid cDNA constructs as a source of starting<br>
mntgrifl^ by the standard process of in vitro transcription (see references above). Similarly to<br>
plasmid DNA, these RNA vector constructs then may be adsorbed to microparticles of the<br>
invention as described elsewhere in the examples. For example, the RNA vector constructs are<br>
adsorbed onto the microparticles by incubating 100 mg of canonic microparticles in a 1 mg/ml<br>
solution of DNA at 4°C for 6 hr. The microparticles are then separated by centrifugation, the<br>
pellet washed with TE buffer, and the microparticles freeze-dried. Reconsutution and delivery of<br>
the PLG-formulated RNA vector constructs is similar to that described for DNA, using for<br>
example at least 1 ug, 10 ug, lOOug, or 1000 ug of formulated RNA vector construct for delivery.<br>

An experiment with mice was performed to analyze the effect ofthe adjuvant aluminum<br>
phosphate (arum) in mice. Polymer mtcroparticles were prepared as above described with or<br>

the PLG microparticles was injected in groups of 6 CB6 Fl mice on weeks 0 and 6, without or<br>
without alum The results, as geometric mean titers of antibody, are shown below in Table 9.<br><br><br>

prepared as described above and in commonly owned International patent application<br>
PCT7US99/17308, and purified recombinant pSSgag protein was adsorbed thereto. A group of<br>
animals was immunized with 1 mg pCMV-p55gag. The animals were immunized again at 4 weeks,<br>
then again at 8 weeks. The animals were boosted with p55gag protein adsorbed to PLG<br>
microparticles at 41 weeks. The results are shown in Table 10 below, which shows antibody titer<br>
for responders, induction of helper T cell lymphoproliferation (mean stimulation index of<br>
responders), and induction of CTL (number of responders, based on greater than 10% lysis at two<br>

Preparation of Plasmids<br>
Plasmids encoding HIV-1 p55gag and gpl40env driven by the human cytomegalovirus<br>
(CMV) promoter were grown ia Escherichia coli strain DH5a, purified using a Qiagen Eadofree<br>
Plasmid Giga kit (Qiagen, Inc.), and resuspended in 0.9% sodium chloride (Abbott Laboratories,<br>
North Chicago, ID). The pCMV vector used contains the immediate-early enhancer/promoter of<br>
CMV and a bovine growth hormone terminator and is described ia detail elsewhere (Chapman, B.<br>
S., et aL 1991. "Effect of nitron A from human cytomegalovirus (Towne) immediate-early gene on<br>
heterologous expression in mammalian cells." Nucleic Acids Res. 19:3979-86). The HTV gag<br>
plasmid DNA vaccine (pCMVgag) contains a synthetically constructed p55gag gene, with codons<br>
reflecting mammalian usage, derived from the HIV-1 SF2 strain as previously described (zur<br>
Megede, ]., et aL 2000. "Increased expression and immunogenicity of sequence-modified human<br>
immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag gene." J ViroL 74:2628-35). The HTV env plasmid DNA<br>
vaccine (pCMVgpl40) consisted of a human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal sequence<br>
and the gpl40 from HIV-1 SF162 strain, codan optimized for high level expression in mammalian<br>
cells (Bamett, S. W., et 2001. Tfceahfliry of anofigom^humaniniiiunodeficie^ virus type 1<br>

cells and purified as previously described (Bamett, S. W., ET. 2001. J ViroL 75:5526-40).<br><br>
Recombinant HTV-1.SF2 p55 gag protein was expressed in yeast and purified by cation exchange<br>
chromatography (Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, CA). The p55gag cDNA sequence from the<br>
SF2 strain of HIV-1 (Genbank accession number K02007) was cloned into aubiquain expression<br>
vector, resulting in the addition of glycine and arghune to the N-terminus of the wild-type<br>
sequence. The recombinant pS5gagproteh was extracted from Ae yeast cell pellet usirjg 50 mM<br>

was then added to 50 ml of distilled water containing (^tyrtarnethylamtoomum bromide (CTAB)<br>

6,000 rpm fori 2 h at room temperature, allowing the methylene chloride to evaporate. The<br>
resulting micropartides were washed twice in distilled water by centrifugation at 10,000g and<br>
freeze-dried. Plasmid DNA from Example 11 was adsorbed onto the rnicroparticles by incubating<br>
100 mg of canonic rnicroparticles 5ml of a 200 rmcrogranvml solution of DNA at 4°C for 63b. The<br>
micropartides were then separated by centrifugation, the pellet was washed with TE (Tris-EDTA)<br>
buffer, and the micropartides were freeze-dried.<br>

Blank rnicroparticles were prepared by a solvent evaporation technique. Briefly,<br>
rnicroparticles were prepared by homogenizing 10ml 6% w/v polymer solution in methylene<br>
chloride, with 40 ml of distilled water containing SDS (1% w/v) at high speed using a 10mm<br>
probe. This resulted in an oil in water emulsion, which was stirred at 1000 rpm for 12 hours at<br><br>
room temperature, and the methylene chloride was allowed to evaporate. The resulting<br>
microparticles were filtered through a 38ummesh, washed 3 times in distilled water, and freeze-<br>
dried. The size distribution of the microparticles was determined using a particles size analyzer<br>
(Master sirer, Malvern Instruments, UK).<br>

were prepared. Rhesus macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated from<br>
heparinized blood by centrifugation on Ficofl-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.)<br>
gradients. PBMC were cultured for 8 days in 24-weH plates at 3 x 106 per well in 1.5 ml of AIM-<br>

Stable rhesus B-rymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) were derived by exposing PBMC to herpesvirus<br>
papio-contairjmg culture supernatant from the S594 cell line (Falk, L, et aL 1976. Properties of a<br>
baboon fymphotropic herpesvirus related to Epstein-Barr virus. Int J Cancer. 18:798-807. Rabin,<br>

characterization of foamyviruses. J Med PrimatoL 5:13-22.) in the presence of 0.5 microgram/ml<br>
cyclosporin A (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Autologous B-LCL were infected with recombinant<br>
vaccinia virus (rW) encoding HTV-1.SF2 gag-pol (rWgag-poI) or HTV-1.SF162 gpl60env<br>
(rWgpl60env) (PFU:ceIl ratio of 10) and concurrentry labeled with NaI31Cr]20« (NEN, Boston,<br>
MA) at 25 mdcrocurie per 1 x 10s B-LCL. After overnight culture at 37°C, rW-infected, 51Cr-<br>
labded B-LCL were washed and then added (2,500 per round-bottomed well) to duplicate wells<br>
containing threefold serial dilutions of cultured PBMC. Then 10s unlabeled, uninfected B-LCL<br><br>
were added per well to inhibit nonspecific cytolysis. After 4h incubation at 37°C, 50 microliters of<br>
culture supernatauts were harvested and added to LumaPlates (Packard, Meriden, CT), and<br>
radioactivity was counted (counts per minute (cpm)) with a Microbeta 1450 liquid scintillation<br>
counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). slCr released from rysed targets was normalized by using the<br>
formula: % Specific MCr Release = 100% x (mean experimental cpm - SR)/(MR - SR), where SR<br>
= mean cpm from targets alone and MR = mean cpm from targets exposed to Triton X-100. An<br>
animal was determined to have a positive, p55gag-specific response if at two consecutive dilutions<br>
of the gag peptide pool-stimulated PBMC the lysis of rWgag-pol-infected B-LCL exceeded lysis<br>

Rhesus PBMC (1 x 106 per well) were cultured overnight in the presence of Brefeldin A<br>
(Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Phanningen) and in the<br>
presence or absence of the gag or env peptide pools. Duplicate wells were prepared for each<br>
condition of stimulation. The next day ceDs were stained with peridinin chlorophyll protein<br>
(PerCP)-conjugated anti-CD8 mAb and aHophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD4 mAb<br>
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), fixed and permeaMized (Cytofrx/Cytoperm, Pharmingen), and<br>
stained with fluorescein isotfnocyanate (FJTC)-conjugated anti-tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)<br>
mAb and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-interferon-y (IFN-y) mAb (Pharmingen). Stained cell<br>
samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer and CeDQuest™ software (Becton<br>
Dickinson). The fraction of cells positively stained for IFN-y and TNF-a was calculated for the<br>
CD4+8- and CD8+4- T cell subsets. The number of gag" or env-specific cells was calculated by<br>
subtraction of the average IPN-^/TNF-a fraction found in the unstimulated control wells from the<br>
average IFN-y^ENF-a fraction found in the gag- or env-stimulated wells.<br>
For a given T cell subset (CD4+8- or CD8+4-) and antigen (gag or env) a response was designated<br>
as positive if the fraction of antigen-specific cells was at least 0.1%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
