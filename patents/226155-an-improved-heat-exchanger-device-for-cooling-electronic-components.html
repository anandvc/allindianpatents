				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an improved heat exchanger device adaptable<br>
for cooling the electronic components mounted over the device. The<br>
electronic components dissipate varied thermal loads which depend upon the<br>
shape, size and function of the electronic components. A fluid passing through<br>
a plurality of in-built passages within the device extracts the heat generated<br>
by the electronic components by convection and transfers the same to an<br>
adjacently disposed sink.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The Commercially available heat exchangers for cooling of power<br>
electronics and other high watt density electronics applications generally are<br>
manufactured by pressing 0.25" copper tubing into a channeled aluminum.<br>
Such devices are available in six and twelve inch long configurations having<br>
straight and beaded fittings. The tap holes can be drilled according to<br>
customer requirements.<br>
Another design of commercially available devices constitute a high<br>
performance series of Cold Plates. It provides low thermal resistance and<br>
dual-sided component mounting, with the capability of being drilled and<br>
tapped on one surface. This all-aluminum device is manufactured utilizing<br>
vacuum brazing techniques commonly found in custom cold plates. To build<br>
these cold plates, high-performance corrugated aluminum fin is brazed into<br>
the liquid cavity below the mounting surfaces.<br>
US patent No 6,367,543 BI describes a liquid cooled heat sink. This<br>
sink is having a cooling housing including a peripheral side wall extending<br>
from the perimeter of a bottom wall and a lid sized to engage the peripheral<br><br>
side wall so as to form a chamber. A fluid inlet port and a fluid outlet port are<br>
defined through the lid, and disposed in fluid communication with the<br>
chamber.<br>
Another version of liquid cooled heat sink has been patented vide US<br>
6,397,932 BI and US 6,719,039 B2. In these versions a plurality of pins<br>
project outwardly from the bottom wall so as to be positioned within the<br>
chamber and arranged in a staggered pattern. The pins include an end that<br>
engages the undersurface of the lid. A third version of liquid cooled heat sink<br>
has been patented vide US 6,578,626 BI. In this embodiment, a corrugated<br>
fin having a plurality of corrugations is positioned within the chamber so that<br>
at least one of the corrugations engages the bottom wall and at least one of<br>
the corrugations engages the under surface of the lid.<br>
The US patent no 6,819,561 B2 describes a heat exchange system equivalent<br>
to that of the device described hereinabove. Such a device achieves heat<br>
removal from high-power, heat-producing electronic components by<br>
conduction and convection. The heat exchange system comprises a metal<br>
tube that has been forged and drawn so as to define a flow channel for a<br>
cooling fluid, wherein the tube has an inner surface that includes a plurality of<br>
integral fins that are structured and arranged to increase the available surface<br>
area of the inner surface of the metal tube exposed to the fluid and further<br>
has an outer surface that is in direct communication with the heat producing<br>
electronics components. Coolant fluids are circulated through the flow<br>
channel, preferably, at turbulent flow conditions to minimize thermal<br>
resistance. The invention further provides a self-cooling self-supporting<br>
electronic device which comprises one or more high-power electronic<br>
components, the heat exchange means, and an attaching system for<br>
attaching high-power electronic components to the heat exchange system.<br><br>
US patent no 5,924,481 describes another type of cooling device for<br>
electronic components. A header tank for accommodating refrigerant is<br>
formed on one side of the device, on the other side of which at least one<br>
electronic component is mounted. A plurality of loop pipes in which the<br>
refrigerant is circulated are connected with the header tank. The plurality of<br>
loop pipes are arranged substantially parallel with the device. The radiating<br>
area of the loop pipes disposed at a distal end of the device is larger than the<br>
radiating area of the loop pipes configured at the proximal end.<br>
US patent no: US 6,634,421, describes a high performance cold plate<br>
for electronic cooling. Here a fluid cooling device and a method for<br>
manufacturing the fluid cooling device are disclosed. The fluid cooling device<br>
includes a plurality of cold plate members, each having a plurality of<br>
imperforate plate portions and several perforate portions arranged in line; and<br>
at least one connector for connecting the plate portions together at one end<br>
thereof. The cold plate numbers are arranged in a stack, wherein respective<br>
plate portions of each Cold Plates members are configured in registration with<br>
perforate portions formed in the immediately adjacent cold plate members in<br>
the stack. The fluid cooling device provides very high heat transfer by close<br>
clearance laminar developing flow, thereby increasing the thermal<br>
performance of the fluid cooling device while maintaining low pressure drop.<br>
The method for manufacturing of the fluid cooling device includes producing a<br>
plurality of cold plate members from a planner metal type, or thin layer stock;<br>
positioning the cold plate members relative to each other so that the<br>
respective imperforate plate portions of each cold plate member are disposed<br>
in registration with the perforate portions formed in the immediately adjacent<br>
cold plate members; and joining each cold plate member with the<br>
immediately adjacent cold plate members.<br><br>
The prior art devices described hereinabove have the flow paths<br>
designed either using coiled tubes or plate fins sandwiched in between atleast<br>
two flat plates. Another design of prior art device has a plurality of pins<br>
projected outwardly from the bottom wall so as to be positioned within the<br>
bottom and top plates, appropriate side walls and inlet outlet connectors. In<br>
yet another variant of the prior art the plurality of pins are replaced by several<br>
fins having a plurality of corrugations, keeping other components unaltered.<br>
All the above designs address the problem of heat generation in electronic<br>
devices by heat removal on an uniform basis throughout the plate surfaces.<br>
In practice, heat emission by all the electronic components mounted on a<br>
heat exchanger device will not be uniform and also the same electronic<br>
component can have different heat release rates at different locations.<br>
Hence, a solution for uniform removal of heat throughout the plate results in<br>
comparatively higher device temperatures and higher pumping power<br>
requirement for circulation of cooling fluid.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide an improved heat exchanger device<br>
which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art devices.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide an improved heat exchanger<br>
device which improves the heat transfer rate of cooling fluid.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an improved heat exchanger<br>
device which comprises flow-passages to improve flow-velocity of the cooling<br>
medium there through.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved heat<br>
exchanger device which requires bonding of the base plate and the top plate<br>
eliminating thereby additional bonding of the flow passage comprising of<br>
tubes or fins.<br><br>
Still yet another object of the invention is to provide an improved heat<br>
exchanger device which is easy to manufacture, cost-effective and designed<br>
to have in-built machine grooved flow-passages in registration wth<br>
disposition of electronic components having varied heat transfer rate thereby<br>
achievhg improved cooing effect<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INENTION<br>

for cooling electronic components mounted over atteast one external surface<br>
of the device, comprising a base plate; a cover plate; a clad sheet Interposed<br>

plate with the clad sheet btng rigidly jointed to form a single integrated<br>
plate; atleast one in let port and atleast one outlet port at one end and /or at<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
An improved heat exchanger device basically constitutes a cold plate<br>
adaptable to cool the electronic components mounted on the surface of the<br>
Plate. As the heat generated by any electronic component is not uniform<br>
through out its body, in practice there would be certain areas of high heat<br>
flux zones and the remaining areas would constitute low heat flux zones. In<br>
one aspect of the present Invention the fluid flow passages are designed such<br>
that higher fluid velocities and higher heat transfer surface are provided<br>
underneath the high heat flux zones of the electronic components and low<br>
fluid velocities underneath the low heat flux zones. The main variables<br>
considered in designing the flow path configuration are:<br>
•	Length of the passage<br>
•	Width of the passage<br>
•	Depth of the passage<br>
•	Number of parallel flow paths.<br>
The cooling of a typical electronic component having a high heat zone<br>
of 3 inches by 5 inches size which emits about one KW heat and a low heat<br>
zone of 2 inches by 13 inches size which generates about 0.2 KW heat is<br>
considered. The design has been evolved considering use of two each of<br>
such electronic components mounted on a single Cold Plate of an improved<br>
heat exchanger device. The overall size of the Cold Plate is 500 to 700mm by<br>
250 to 350 mm.<br><br>
The improved heat exchanger device has essentially three major<br>
components, a base plate (1) where the fluid passages (4) are configured, a<br>
clad sheet (2) to effect the vacuum brazing and a cover plate (3). The base<br>
plate (1) is of 8 to 16 mm thick, the dad sheet (2) is about 0.3 to 0.8 mm<br>
thick and the cover plate (3) is of 2 to 4 mm thick. The fluid passages<br>
comprise a plurality of grooves configured on the base plate (1) preferably by<br>
using a Numerically Controlled (NC) machine. The flow passages (4) have<br>
varied depth from 5 mm to 10 mm; with varied width torn 3 mm to 8 mm.<br>
The width of the solid portions between two adjacent passages (4) varies<br>
between 2 mm to 11 mm. The contour of the flow passages (4) comprise a<br>
plurality of U-bends. The high heat flux zones have only two paralel paths<br>
with long path having longer path length. Such restricting of the number of<br>
parallel paths will increase the fluid velocity, and the resultant increase in<br>
turbulence will enhance the heat transfer rate. The low heat flux zones are<br>
provided with parallel paths and larger cross-sectional areas which ensure low<br>
fluid velocities so that fluid pressure drop can be minimized. As per the<br>
mounting requirement of electronic components, suitable number of landings<br>
(solid areas) are provided in between the flow passages (4). Atleast one inlet<br>
and one outlet nozzle is provided for fluid entry and exit (not shown).<br>
The bottom plate (1) is covered with the top plate (3) keeping the clad<br>
plate (2) in between. They are brazed together using a vacuum brazing<br>
furnace. The vacuum brazing process is an established process for aluminum<br>
materials.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the flow passages have equal cross<br>
section but having atleast one serial path for high heat flux zone and multiple<br>
parallel paths for low heat flux zones, in an alternative embodiment atleast<br>
one inlet and one outlet port (5,6) are arranged in the vertical direction by<br><br>
having a grooved rectangular chamber at the inlet and outlet (5,6). Preferably<br>
a hole can be drilled on the outer surface to connect the fluid now path with<br>
external connectors (not shown).<br>
A typical device manufactured according to the invention and considering the<br>
selected parameters has been tested with a fluid flow rate of 14 liters per<br>
minute. Electronic components are mounted and the temperature profile has<br>
been evaluated. Typical test results are given in Fig- 3.<br>
A test has been conducted to evaluate the Temperature Effectiveness of the<br>
device for different loads. Temperature effectiveness is defined as the ratio<br>
of the average to the maximum device temperature. It is an indicator which<br>
shows how effectively the device is designed to extract the heat from high<br>
heat flux zones. The average plate temperature is calculated as an arithmetic<br>
average of all the plate temperatures recorded. Temperature Effectiveness is<br>
high at lower heat loads and decreases as the load is increased. The results<br>
are shown in Fig. 4.<br>
Another test was conducted to evaluate the Performance Factor. The<br>
Performance Factor is defined as the ratio of heat picked up by the fluid to<br>
the total heat input into the plate and the result is expressed in percentage.<br>
Fig.5 shows the Performance Factor of the device. At lower loads the<br>
Performance Factor is as high as 97.4 percent and it decreases as heat load<br>
increases.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited only<br>
to the particular constructions herein disclosed and shown in the drawings,<br>
but also includes any modifications or equivalents within the scope of the<br>
claims.<br><br>
