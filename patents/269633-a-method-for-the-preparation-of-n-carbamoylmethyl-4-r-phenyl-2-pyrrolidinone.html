				<td>Method of preparation and use of pharmacologically active<br>
N-carbamoylmethyl-4(R)-phenyl-2-pyrrolidinone<br>
Background of the invention<br>
5	The invention relates to the discovery of the biologically active R-enantiomer of N-<br>
carbamoylmethyl-4-aryl-2-pyrrolidinone and easy and effective method of its preparation.<br>
It is known that humans in a stress situation or under psycho-emotional strain exhibit<br>
irrational and inadequate forms of behavior, disorders of mental capacity, declined speed of<br>
reaction, and increased number of erroneous decisions etc.<br>
10	Therefore discovery of pharmaceuticals abating and preventing the effect of a stress<br>
factor is of substantial importance. For this purpose the nootropic GABA derivatives: Phenibut<br>
and Baclofen are applied, even though their use is followed by drowsiness, depression, dizziness,<br>
lowered psychomotor reactions etc.<br>
In comparison to GABA derivatives another agent widely used for this purpose N-<br>
15 carbamoylmethyl-4-aryl-2-pyrrolidinone (Carphedon, INN) could be regarded as a much more<br>
perspective psycho-stimulator due to the less pronounced side effects.<br>
The R- and S- enantiomeric forms of Carphedon and their pharmacologic properties are<br>
not known. The pharmacologic properties of only the racemic Carphedon are published today<br>
and there is no data concerning possible differences of pharmacological properties for its<br>
20 separate R- and S-enantiomers. The absence of this highly important information also does not<br>
allow to adequately estimate the real pharmaceutical potential of Carphedon already used in<br>
medicine, because in reality it is represented by a mixture of R- and S- enantiomers, which may<br>
exhibit different pharmacologic properties.<br>
In the present invention we have developed methods for preparation of pure R- and S-<br>
25 Carphedon and unexpectedly discovered that R-Carphcdon as an antideprcssant, analgesic,<br>
muscle relaxant and psycho-stimulating compound is more effective than the racemic Carphedon<br>
or 5-Carphedon.<br>
Summary and detailed description.<br>
30 The invention relates to the R-enantiomer of 4-phenyl-1-pyrrolidineacetic acid amide. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to N-carbamoylmethyl-4(R)-phcnyl-2-pyrrolidinone of the<br>
formula:<br><br><br>
a new chemical compound of pharmacological value and a method of its production.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
As we have discovered, the preparation of R-Carphedon 4 the same as S-Carphedon 4a<br>
can be easily achieved by the means of the N-alkylation of available 4(R)-phenyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidinone (1) or 4(S)-phenyl-2-pyrrolidinone (la) with ethyl bromoacetate (2) in the<br>
presence of a strong base and by the following transformation of ethoxycarbonyl group in the<br>
intermediate 2-pyrrolidinones 3 and 3a into carbamoyl function by the treatment with ammonia.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
N-Carbamoylmethyl-4(R)-phenyl-2-pyrrolidinone (4). The solution of 4(R)-phenyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidinone (1) (345 mg, 2.14 mM) in 1,4-dioxane (30 ml) was added to the suspension of<br>
sodium hydride (56 mg, 2.35 mM) in 1,4-dioxane (30 ml). The mixture was heated at 80-90°C<br>
during 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. Ethyl bromoacetate (393 mg, 2.37 mM) was<br>
added and the reaction mixture was re fluxed at 110-20°C for 6 hours. Obtained mixture was<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure. Residue was purified by column chromatography on<br>
silicagel with ethylacetate-hexane mixture 1:1, giving N-ethoxycarbonylmethyl-4(/?)-phenyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidinone (3) (338 mg, 64%). [α]D20=+4.6°(c=3, MeOH). lH NMR (CDC1.0, 8: 1.28 (3H, t,<br><br>
CH2CH3); 2.59 (1H, d, d, 3-CH2); 2.87 (1H, d, d, 3-CH2); 3.54 (1H, t, 5-CH2); 3.64 (1H, quintet,<br>
4-CH); 3.83 (1H, t, 5-CH2); 4.11 (2H, s, NCH2CO); 4.20 (2H, q, CH2CH3); 7.20-7.39 (5H, m,<br>
C6H5).<br>
The solution of N-ethoxycarbonylmethyl-4(i?)-phenyl-2-pyrrolidinone (3) (250 mg, 1.01 mM) in<br>
methanol (30 ml) saturated by stream of gaseous ammonia for 5 hours. Reaction mixture was<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography<br>
with cthylacctatc-hcxanc mixture 1:1 silicagel giving N-carbamoylmcthyl-4(i?)-phenyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidinone (4a) (187 mg, 85%). M.p. 107.5-108 °C. [α]D20=+8.5° (c=3, MeOH). 1H NMR<br>
(CDCl3), 6: 2.61 (1H, d, d, 3-CH2); 2.87 (1H, d, d, 3-CH2); 3.54 (1H, t, 5-CH2); 3.66 (1H,<br>
quintet, 4-CH); 3.89 (1H, t, 5-CH2); 4.00 (2H, s, NCH2CO); 5.68 and 6.21 (1H and 1H, br.s and<br>
br.s, NH2); 7.20-7.40 (5H, m, C6H5).<br>
Example 2<br>
N-Carbamoylmethyl-4(iS)-phenyl-2-pyrrolidinone (4a). Substituting pyrrolidinonc 1 in<br>
Example 1 by 4(S)-phenyl-2-pyrrolidinone (1a) S-enantiomeric N-carbamoylmethyl-4(.S)-<br>
phenyl-2-pyrrolidinone (4a) was obtained. [a]D2O=-8.3° (c-3, MeOH). 1H NMR (CDC13), 5: 2.61<br>
(1H, d, d, 3-CH,); 2.87 (1H, d, d, 3-CH2); 3.54 (1H, t, 5-CH2); 3.66 (1H, quintet, 4-CH); 3.89<br>
(1H, t, 5-CH2); 4.00 (2H, s, NCH2CO); 5.68 and 6.21 (1H and 1H, br.s and br.s, NH2); 7.20-7.40<br>
(5H, m, C6H5).<br>
According to the invention, we have performed the comparative investigation of<br>
antidepressant, muscle relaxant, locomotor and analgesic activities for R- and S-enantiomers of<br>
N-carbamoylmethyl-4-aryl-2-pyrrolidinone and compared with those of the racemic one<br>
(Carphedon) (Table 1-3). We have unexpectedly discovered, that i?-Carphedon possesses more<br>
pronounced desired pharmacological properties comparing with S-Carphedon.<br>
The data presented in Table 1 demonstrate an excellent antidepressant activity of R-<br>
enantiomer of Carphedon using the standard Porsolt forced swim test (FST). After the<br>
preliminary treatment with R-Carphedonl, the animals did not spent any time immobile. Also in<br>
the case of animals treated with racemic Carphedon, the immobility period was significantly<br>
shorter. Contrary to that, mice in the control and S-Carphedon groups demonstrated<br>
characteristic behavior for FST test conditions registered as an immobilization in response to<br>
stress factor.<br>
Similar advantage of R-Carphedon in comparison to S-Carphedon and racemate was<br>
observed in experiments characterizing the motor activity of mice in the standard open field test<br>
(Table 2). The i.p. administration of the test compounds in equal 50 mg/kg doses caused<br><br>
prolonged and stable increase in animal activity in the case of R-Carphedon, which at the end of<br>
the 120 min observation period was about two times higher than activity caused by S-<br>
Carphedonl.<br>
The data presented in Table 3 show that equal muscle relaxant activity and analgesic<br>
effect of tested compounds was achieved by the lower dosages of R-Carphedon than the same of<br>
S-Carphedon.<br><br><br><br><br>
The obtained results prove the high therapeutic value for R-Carphedon exceeding the<br>
same one for racemic Carphedon, because pharmaceutical properties of the latter are negatively<br>
affected by the presence of S-Carphedon, which characterizes by lower and in some experiments<br>
by considerably weaker activity.<br><br>

wherein * marks chiral carbon atom.<br>
2.	Use of compound (I) according to the claim 1 as an antidepressant.<br>
