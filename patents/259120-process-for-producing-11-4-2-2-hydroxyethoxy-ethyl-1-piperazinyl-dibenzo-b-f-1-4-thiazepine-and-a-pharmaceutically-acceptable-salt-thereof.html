				<td>Field   of the Invention<br>
This invention in general relates to a process for producing an atypical neuroleptic or anti-psychotic and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt More particularly, this inventi an provides an improved, concise and industrially favorable process for producing 1 l-[4-[2-2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazinyl]dibenzo[bf][l,4]thiazepine (Quetiapine) and its fumarate salt.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
ll-[4-[:2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazinyl].dibenzo[b,f][l,4]thiazepine [I] and its fumarate salt is used in treating symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders and other psychoses such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and speech and bizarre behavior.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 [I] There are several methods known in the prior art for producing quetiapine and the use<br>
thereof for the treatment of symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders.<br>
According to United States Patent No. 4,879,288 to Warawa et al, (Scheme 1), the compound of Formula [I] and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are prepared from dibenzo[b,f][l,4}thiazepine-ll-(10H)one [II] which is prepared by a variety of methods; for example as described in the literature e.g. J, Scmutz et al Helv. Chim.<br>
Acta, 48: 336 (1965), by cyclizing a compound selected from compounds of the Formula [III], [IV] and [V] in acidic conditions preferably in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid or polyphosphoric acid at high temperature.<br>
The compound iminohalide [VI] is prepared from lactam [II] using a dehydrating agent e.g. phosphorous pentahalide or oxyhalide in the presence of N,N-dimethylaniline at reflux temperature. The iminohalide [VI] thus prepared reacts with 1-hydroxye|hoxyethylpiperazine to give the title compound [I],<br>
Another [VII] with<br>
referred method to prepare the title compound [I] is by reacting compound 2-substituted ethoxyethanol whereby the substituting group Z is an atom or a<br>
group removable as anion e.g. mesyloxy, tosyloxy or halogen in polar organic solvent or aprotic solvent e.g. n-propanol, N-methyl pyrrolidone in the presence of alkali metal halide e.g Nal and alkali metal carbonate e.g.<br>
The compound [VII] is prepared by reacting iminohalide [VI] with piperazine in an inert organic solvent e.g. toluene or xylene under reflux for 5 hours.<br>
Alternate ely, the lactam [II] may convert into a thiolactam of Formula [VIII] by reacting with a polysulfur compound e.g. P2S5, which on alkylation gives thioether of the Formula [IX] wherein R3 is chosen such that S-Ra is a leaving group. The thioether on reactiop with 1-hydroxyethoxyethylpiperazine gives title compound [I],<br>
The said patent discloses preparing quetiapine from iminohalide [VI] via dibenzothiazepine [II]. Iminohalide [VI] disclosed in the above patent is an unstable intermediate and hydrolyzes during work up by addition of water and part of it is converted back into, dibenzothiazepine [II]. When handling larger quantities, this side-reaction reduces the yield and the product of the hydrolysis contaminates the end product. This affects the overall yield and cost in the quetiapine preparation and thus is disadvantageous on a commercial manufacturing scale.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
[VII] reacts with 2-haloethoxyethanol e.g. 2-chloroethoxyethanol to give of the Formula [I]. The compound of formula [VII] is obtained from<br>
According to European Patent EP0282236 to Barker, et al., (Scheme 2), the piperazine<br>
derivative<br>
compound<br>
iminohalide [VI] by reaction with piperazine in the presence of an inert organic solvent<br>
e.g.   xylere   or  toluene.   The   compound   of  formula   [VII]   is   obtained   from<br>
dibenzothiazepine  [II]   in  the presence  of dehydrating  agent  e.g.  phosphorous<br>
oxychloride.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
According to the method reported in European patent application EP1201663 to Harada, ei al., (Scheme 3), lactam [II] a key intermediate for quetiapine is prepared from 2-amino-2'-carboxydiphen.ylsulphide [X] under reflux temperature optionally in the presenbe of an organic solvent e.g. toluene or xylene in 20 hours. The 2-amino-2'-carboxydihenylsulphide [X] is prepared by the reduction of the 2-nitro-2'-carboxydiphenylsulphide [XI]. The 2-nitro-2'-carboxydiphenylsulphide [XI] is<br>
prepared from thiosalicylic acid [XVI] and o-halonitrobenzene [XVII] with a suitable<br>
 ' base e.g. potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide in the presence<br>
of solvent like water or amides or alcohol at 0°C to 150°C within 20 hours.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
According to another method disclosed in the European Patent EP1252151 to Bozsing, et al., (Scheme 4), compound of the Formula [I] is prepared by reacting haloethylpiperazinylthiazepine derivative [XV] with sodium and ethylene glycol<br>
following Williamson's synthesis. The haloethylpiperazinylthiazepine derivative [XV]<br>
is prepared by the cyclization of haloethylpiperazine derivative [XIV] using a dehydrating agent e.g. phosphorous pentaoxide or phosphorous oxychloride, which itself is prepared from hatogenation of hydroxyethylpiperazine derivative [XIII]. The hydroxyethylpiperazine derivative [XIII], a novel piperazine derivative is prepared by reaction of 1-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine with urethane derivative [XII] in the presence of solvent e.g. toluene under reflux. The urethane derivative [XII] can be prepared by a method known in the prior art by reacting 2-aminodiphenylsuLfide with phenyl chloroformate.<br>
In the European Patent EP1252151 quetiapine is prepared in multiple steps, which increases the manufacturing time thus reduces the overall yield of the final product and thus not Industrially feasible.<br>
The main intermediate for the preparation of quetiapine is dibenzothiazepine [II], which<br>
cribed in the United Kingdom Patent GB802901, assigned to CIBA Ltd. for preparation of dibenzothiazepine [II] is described in many patents such<br>
as EP1201663, US 5,607,929, EP419861, US 4,728,735 and US 3,367,930.<br>
The synthetic processes reported in prior art for the preparation of quetiapine have disadvantages at the commercial scale. The known processes include multiple steps, increased cycle time and isolation of unstable intermediate like iminohalide. Thus the processes rec ited in the known art involve long manufacturing time, result in low yield, thereby increasing the production cost.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to provide an industrially feasible process for synthesizing quetiapine and its salt, which involves minimum steps, is cost effective and convenient to operate on an industrial scale.<br>
