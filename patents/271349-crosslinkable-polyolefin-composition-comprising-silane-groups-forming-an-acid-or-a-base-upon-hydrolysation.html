CROSSLINKABLE POLYOLEFIN COMPOSITION COMPRISING SILANE GROUPS FORMING AN ACID OR A BASE UPON HYDROLYSATION<br>

OF IZD TOWER,<br>
WAGRAMERSTRASSE 17-19,<br>
A-1220 WIEN<br>
AUSTRIA<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Crosslinkable Polyoiefin Composition Comprising Silane Groups Forming an Acid or a Base upon Hydrofysation<br>
The present invention relates to polyoiefin compositions comprising a crosslinkable polyoiefin with hydrolysable silane groups, to a wire or cable comprising such compositions, to the use of such compositions for the production of a wire or cable, to the use of a hydrolysed silane group containing polyoiefin or non-polymeric compound as silanol condensation catalyst, and to the use of a non-polymeric silane group containing compound as a scorch retarding agent.<br>
It is known to cross-link polyolefins by means of additives as this improves several of the properties of the polyoiefin, such as mechanical strength and chemical heat resistance. Cross-linking may be performed by condensation of silanol groups contained in the polyoiefin which can be obtained by hydrolysation of silane groups. A silane compound may be introduced as a cross-linkable group into a polyoiefin e.g. by grafting the silane compound onto the polyoiefin, or by copolymerisation of olefin monomers and silane group containing monomers. Such techniques are known e.g. from US 4,413,066, US 4,297,310, US 4,351,876, US 4,397,981, US 4,446,283 and US 4,456,704.<br>
In the present invention, the polyoiefin composition is particularly used for the production of a wire or cable, in particular a low, medium or high voltage cable. Electric power cables for low voltages, i.e. voltages of below 3 kV, usually comprise an electric conductor which is coated with an insulation layer. Such low voltage cables are also denoted as single wire cables. Optionally, two or more of such single wire cables are surrounded by a common outermost sheath layer, the jacket.<br>
A typical medium voltage power cable, usually used for voltages from 3 to 36 kV, and a typical high voltage cable used for voltages higher than 36<br><br>
kV, comprises one or more conductors in a cable core that is surrounded by several layers of polymeric materials, including an inner semiconducting layer, followed by an insulating layer, and then an outer semiconducting layer. These layers are normally crosslinked. To these layers, further layers may be added, such as a metallic tape or wire shield, and, finally, an outermost jacketing layer. The layers of the cable are based on different types of polymer compositions. As insulating materials, mainly cross-linked polyolefins such as crosslinked low density polyethylene are used.<br>
As hydrolysable silane groups in cross-linkable polyolefins today predominantly alkoxy groups are used. For cross-linking of polyolefins containing such hydrolysable silane groups, a silanol condensation catalyst must be used. Conventional catalysts are, for example, tin-, zinc-, iron-, lead- or cobalt-organic compounds such as dibutyl tin dilaurate (DBTDL). The cross-linking process may advantageously be carried out in the presence of Bronsted acid silanol condensation catalysts. In contrast to the conventional metal-organic catalysts these catalysts allow cross-linking to quickly take place already at room temperature. Such acidic silanol condensation catalysts are disclosed for example in WO 95/17463.<br>
However, it is known that these Bronsted acids are comparatively strong acids, which gives rise to problems with corrosion and interaction with colour masterbatches and other additives.<br>
Furthermore, it is a known that in order to obtain a homogeneous end-product a good mixing of the components of the polyolefin composition must be achieved, which is usually done by compounding the polyolefin composition in an extruder. However, due to the presence of cross-linkable silane groups in the composition and the elevated temperature and pressure in the extruder undesired cross-linking of the composition already in the extruder may take place, which is known as "scorch".<br><br>
It is hence an object of the present invention to provide a polyolefin composition comprising a cross-linkable polyolefin with hydrolysable silane groups which can be cross-linked using milder conditions, for example by avoiding the addition of strong acids to the composition, but still allowing for quick cross-linking desirably at room temperature, and for a high cross-linking degree.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a compound for a polyolefin composition comprising a cross-linkable polyolefin with hydrolysable silane groups which reduces undesired cross-linking, i.e. scorch, during extrusion of the composition.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the above objects can be achieved by the use of a polyolefin composition in which a component is present containing hydrolysable silane groups which upon hydrolysation form an acid or a base.<br>
The present invention therefore in a first embodiment provides a polyolefin composition comprising<br>
(A)       a   crosslinkable   polyolefin   with   hydrolysable   silane groups which upon hydrolysation form an acid or a base,<br>
characterised in that the acid or base generates a gel content of at least 40 % after 40 hours in the 90 °C cross-linking test, wherein the acid or base is added in an amount of 4.5 mmol/kg to an ethylene/vinyltrimethoxysilane copolymer with a MFR2 = 2 g/10min, a density of 923 g/cm3, and 2 wt.% of vinyftrimethoxysilane and then is cross-linked in a waterbath at 90 °C.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention provides in a second embodiment a polyolefin composition comprising<br>
(i)        a   crosslinkable   polyolefin   with   hydrolysable   silane groups, and<br><br>
(ii)      a non-polymeric compound with hydrofysable silane groups which upon hydrolysation form an acid or a base,<br>
characterised in that the acid or base generates a gel content of at least 40 % after 40 hours in the 90 °C cross-linking test, wherein the acid or base is added in an amount of 4.5 mmol/kg to an ethylene/vinyltrimethoxysilane copolymer with a MFR2 = 2 g/10min, a density of 923 g/cm3, and 2 wt.% of vinyltrimethoxysilane and then is cross-linked in a waterbath at 90 °C.<br>
The silane groups which are present in the composition of the first embodiment and which form an acid or a base upon hydrolysation undergo hydrolysis faster than the commonly used alkoxy silane groups. Thus, a faster and easier cross-linking is obtained which allows for milder conditions during the cross-linking step, e.g. by use of a weaker acid or a base as a silanol condensation catalyst.<br>
Furthermore, the acid or base formed upon hydrolysis in the compositions of both embodiments may itself serve as a silanol condensation catalyst, so that the addition of a separately added silanol condensation catalytic agent can be minimised or even dispensed with. Due to the fact that the catalyst is only "released" upon hydrolysis, a premature, unwanted cross-linking can be avoided or reduced.<br>
In the composition of the second embodiment, the non-polymeric compound with hydrolysable silane groups which upon hydrolysation form an acid or a base due to the faster hydrolysation of such silane groups serves as an effective scorch retardant agent.<br>
It is to be noted that in the 90 °C cross-linking test which is described in still more detail in the Examples section below, the "free" acid or base is tested, i.e. not the silane compound. The test may also serve to identify suitable substituents for the silane compounds which upon hydrolysis form an acid or base.<br><br>

Preferably, the antioxidant is present in the composition in an amount of from 0.01 to 3 wt.%, more preferably 0.05 to 2 wt.%, and most preferably 0.08 to 1.5 wt.%.<br><br>
The non-polymeric compound with hydrolysable silane groups which upon hydrolysation form an acid or a base or silanol condensation catalyst, if present, usually is added to the silane group containing polyolefin by compounding the polymer with a so-called master batch, in which the catalyst, and optionally further additives are contained in a polymer, e.g. poiyolefin, matrix in concentrated form.<br>
The matrix polymer is preferably a poiyolefin, more preferably a polyethylene, which may be a homo- or copolymer of ethylene, e.g. low density polyethylene, or polyethylene-methyl-, -ethyl, or -butyl-acrylate copolymer containing 1 to 50 wt.% of the acrylate, and mixtures thereof.<br>

The present invention furthermore relates to an article, such as a wire or cable, a film, or a pipe comprising the poiyolefin composition in any of the above described embodiments.<br>
In particular, the present invention furthermore relates to a wire or cable, in particular a low, medium or high voltage cable.<br>
A medium or high voltage cable usually comprises one or more conductors in a cable core, an inner semiconducting layer, followed by an insulating layer, and then an outer semiconducting layer, wherein at least<br><br>
one of these layers, preferably the insulating layer, comprises the polyolefin composition as described above.<br>
Insulating layers for medium or high voltage power cables generally have a thickness of at least 2 mm, typically at least 2.3 mm, and the thickness increases with increasing voltage the cable is designed for.<br>
In addition to the semiconductive and insulating layers, further layers may be present in medium or high voltage cables, such as a metallic tape or wire shield, and, finally, an outermost jacketing layer.<br>
Usually, the cable is produced by co-extrusion of the different layers onto the conducting core. Then, cross-linking is performed by moisture curing, wherein the silane groups are hydrolysed under the influence of water or steam, resulting in the splitting off of alcohol and the formation of silanol groups, which are then cross-linked in a condensation reaction wherein water is split off.<br>
Usually, moisture curing is performed in a sauna or water bath at temperatures of 70 to 100 °C.<br>
The invention relates furthermore to the use of a polyolefin composition in any of the above described embodiments for the production of a layer of a cable.<br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to the use of a crosslinkable polyolefin with hydrolysable silane groups which upon hydrolysation form an acid or a base in any of the above-describedembodiments, in hydrolysed form as a silanol condensation catalyst, and to the use of a non-polymeric compound with hydrolysable silane groups which upon hydrolysation form an acid or a base in any of the above described embodiments, in hydrolysed form as a silanol condensation catalyst.<br>
Still further, the invention relates to the use of a non-polymeric compound with hydrolysable silane groups which upon hydrolysation form an acid or<br><br>
a base in any of the above described embodiments, in hydrolysed form as scorch retarding agent.<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by means of the following examples.<br>
Examples<br>
1.       Measurement Methods<br>
a)       90 °C Cross-Linking Test<br>
In this test, the performance of an acid or base for cross-linking of silanol groups is tested in a standardized manner.<br>
The cross-linkable polymer to be used in the test is a copolymer of ethylene and vinyltrirnethoxysilane which has been obtained either by copolymerisation or by grafting. The amount of vinyltrirnethoxysilane in the copolymer is 2 wt.%, the copolymer has a MFR2 (2.16 kg/190oC) of 2 g/10min and a density of 923 g/cm3.<br>
A crosslinkable composition was formed by adding to this copolymer the acid or base to be tested in an amount of 4.5 mmol/kg.<br>
This is done in the form of mixing a masterbatch consisting of LDPE and 16 mmol acid/base per kg with the cross-linkable polymer so that an amount of 4.5 mmol acid/base per kg of the polymer composition is obtained.<br>
Then, a tape is extruded from this composition. The tape with 1.7 mm in thickness is then crosslinked at a temperature of 90oC in a waterbath.<br>
The cross-linking degree of the composition is measured by decalin extraction according to ASTM D 2765-1, with the exception that after the<br><br>
extraction with decalin for 6 hours, the extraction was continued another 1 hour in pure, boiling decalin.<br>
b)      Melt Flow Rate<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is indicated in g/10min. The MFR for ethylene polymers is determined at 190 °C and may be determined at different loadings such as 2.16 kg (MFR2)or21.6kg(MFR21).<br>
2.       Example<br>
"Free" octadecanoic acid was tested in accordance with the 90 °C Cross-Linking Test as described above.<br>
In addition, the performance of octadecanoyloxy trimethylsilane was tested in an analogous manner as follows:<br>
To a cross-linkable copolymer of ethylene and vinyltrimethoxysilane (amount of vinyltrimethoxysilane 2 wt.%, MFR2 (2.16 kg/190°C) 2 g/10min, density 923 g/cm3) octadecanoyloxy trimethylsilane was added.<br>
The silane compound was added in form of a masterbatch of LDPE consisting of 16 mmol silane compound per kg masterbatch.<br>
The masterbatch was added in such quantity that the amount of silane compound in the final composition was 4.5 mmol per kg of polymer. A tape was extruded (1.7 mm in thickness) and was then crosslinked at a temperature of 90°C in a waterbath.<br>
The crosslinking degree of the composition was measured by decalin extraction according to ASTM D 2765-1, except that, after decalin extraction for 6 h, extraction is continued for 1 h in pure, boiling decalin.<br><br>
The crosslinking degree obtained with "free" octadecanoic acid and with octadecanoyloxy trimethylstlane is shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1:<br><br>
		Crosslinking degree (%) 90°C	t<br>
Compound	1.5 h	5h	20 h	40 h<br>
Octadecanoyloxy trimethyl silane	0	11	60	67<br>
Octadecanoic acid	1	30	64	73<br>
This result shows that the acylsilane acts as a water scavenger and produces octadecanoic acid when reacting with water, which then works as a silanol condensation catalyst. The final crosslinking degree is the same as with octadecanoic acid. The delay in reaction also shows the scorch retarding effect of using octadecanoyloxy trimethyl silane is substantial.<br><br>
