				<td>YARN PROCESSING SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING AND/OR MONITORING THE SYSTEM<br>
The invention relates to a yam processing system according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a method according to the preamble of claim 5.<br>
During the operation of yarn processing systems (e.g. a weaving machine and several weft yarn feeding devices or a knitting machine and several knitting yarn feeding devices) alarm signals or status signals may occur in or at the yarn feeding devices or in or at accessory appliances. The alarm signals or status signals originate from correspondingly positioned signal emitters and have to be transmitted without delay to the textile machine controller. Reasons for such signals are e.g. a yam breakage, an incorrect voltage level of the power supply, an overheated condition, a mechanical blockage, or the like. The textile machine controller is designed to react to such a signal in different ways. The textile machine e.g. may be switched off. In case that several yarn feeding units are feeding the same yarn quality the textile machine may continue operation by ignoring the disturbed yarn channel or the disturbed yarn feeding unit and consuming the required yarn from another yarn feeding unit or a reserve yarn feeding unit via another yarn channel. Furthermore, there are other control routines which have to be carried out by the textile machine controller due to such a signal which control routines need an undelayed transfer of the signals.<br>
It is known from prior art (Fig. 1) to assure an immediate transfer of each signal to provide a signal line between each yam feeding unit and the textile machine controller. For example with the help of the connection location of the signal line transferring the signal to the textile machine control the textile machine controller is apt to determine from which yarn channel the received signal stems. This information e.g. is needed without exceptions in the case that the function of a disturbed yarn feeding unit has to be substituted by another yarn feed¬ing unit after a switching step carried out by the controller. As the number of yarn feeding units at the textile machine may be very large and since there might be further appliances integrated into the system which appliances also emit such signals, the cabling for so many signal lines is complicated.<br>
Since then the textile machine controller receives at a single input or entrance anonymous signals which are equal to each other, the textile machine controller is unable to make a decision on the yarn channel or the yarn feeding unit from which the respective signal stems. Any received signal, consequently, leads to a switch off of the textile machine even though this might not be necessary in each case.<br>
In yarn processing systems to which a communication system or field bus system is associ¬ated such signals also could be transmitted in the form of messages. Due to an enormous data flood during operation of the system, however, it cannot be assured at any moment that all signals always will be transmitted in real time. Furthermore, this solution is costly and sophisticated.<br>
US 6,371,169 B1 discloses a known yarn processing system according to the preamble of claim 1. A common data bus for coded information signals is provided for all units. The data structure corresponds to a CAN-protocol. Messages are transmitted which contain several frames and a data part including zero to 8 bytes. In the case that responding to a yarn breakage a unit transmits an interruption signal to the textile machine controller the textile machine controller then commands another unit to feed yarn in a substitution mode. The solution is costly and sophisticated.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a yarn processing system and a device for control¬ling and/or for monitoring the system, allowing to inform the textile machine controller about the origination of the transmitted signals with minimum cabling only and such that the textile machine controller can carry out the respective expedient control routine, and such that it is assured that each signal is transmitted timewise correctly.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of claim 1 and according to the method by the fea¬tures of claim 5.<br>
Since only a single signal line has to bridge the in some cases considerable distance be¬tween the textile machine controller and the yarn feeding unit or the coding station, the ca¬bling can be minimal. However, by each individually coded signal on the signal line the textile machine controller is informed about the sender and thus may initiate at least one control routine which is expedient for the respective situation, by which control routine e.g.<br>
the yarn channel or the device which has signalled is taken out of operation while another yarn channel or another yarn feeding unit is informed to take over the task of the disturbed yarn channel.<br>
The system is simple in its hardware components and control technology since the signal length can be modulated in a simple way and delivers clear information about the sender. Expediently, little effort is needed to provide a larger number of clearly discriminated codes for <br>
for the identification of many yarn feeding units or even in some cases of accessory appliances of yarn feeding units, respectively.<br>
The signal may e.g. identify the sender or the related yarn channel already by an individually modulated signal length or by modulated signal pulses within the signal length.<br>
According to the method each anonymous signal is modulated in its signal length or by signal pulses within the signal length such that the textile machine controller can reliably respond to the signals and can identify the respective device or the respective yarn channel. The signal transmission time remains optimally short. The modulation does not delay the transmission. The coded signals can be clearly discriminated even if signals are transmitted from many differently positioned yarn feeding units, accessory appliances or from many yarn channels. According to the invention an individual pulse length modulation or pulse width modulation is employed as the coding.<br>
The system could operate in some cases bi-directionally, meaning that via the signal line e.g. after a transmitted coded signal, a receipt confirmation signal is transmitted back e.g. by the textile machine controller.<br>
In an expedient embodiment for all devices or yarn channels, respectively, a central coding station is provided, preferably within a control box which in many cases is provided anyhow. At least the yarn feeding units are connected to the control box by relatively short lines which are needed also for other purposes. These lines may be used as the signal line branches for transmitting the anonymous signals. Alternatively, relatively short own signal lines could lead to the control box which signal lines exclusively are used to transmit the individual anonymous signals.<br>
The control box is, advantageously, positioned near to the yarn feeding units such that only one single signal line for the coded signals has to be installed over the in some cases considerable distance between the yarn feeding units and the textile machine controller.<br>
In an alternative embodiment an individual coding device is provided for each device, preferably for each yarn feeding unit, such that all coding devices provided in common form the coding station for the single signal line. Each coding device modulates the incoming anonymous signal in the signal length corresponding to the location of the sender in the system and prior to sending it further.<br>
In one embodiment having the coding station e.g. received in a control box, several ports for the signal line branches are provided between the coding station and the devices. The ports are associated to the single yarn channels or devices, respectively. A logic circuitry contained in the coding station, e.g. a microcontroller, provides an individual signal length for each port by which signal length the signal arriving at the respective port is modulated before it is transmitted further on the signal line. The anonymous signals may be simple signal pulses.<br>
For example within the signal length which is the same for all transmitted signals an individual signal starting section or signal ending section with a respective individual length is formed which can be identified. In this case the effort for processing the signals remains low.<br>
Alternatively, the signal length may be modulated individually between a synchronisation signal starting section and a signal end section or an end pulse. The textile machine controller or the decoding station, respectively, determines with the help of the time window between the starting section and the end section or the end pulse or with the help of the position of the end pulse within the signal from which sender the transmitted modulated signal stems.<br>
As a further alternative each anonymous signals can be converted into an individual binary code consisting of a sequence of individually distant pulses which result in a readable binary code of ones and zeros.<br>
A further possibility is to convert the signal into a respective individual pulse chain such that the decoding station can determine the information to the sender as a counting result by simply counting the pulses.<br>
In case that there is already a communication system in a yarn processing system within which communication system individual addresses are associated e.g. to the yarn feeding units, the coding devices may transmit the signal as a coded or modulated address signal, respectively.<br>
In view of a simple control technique a signal can be coded in a very simple fashion by means of a logic circuitry and with the help of the input port at which the signal arrives. Within the logic circuitry each port has associated thereto an individual signal length or signal length modulation respectively, for automatically modulating the signal prior to the transmission on the signal line. This allows a very comfortable expansion of the system at any time by adding or removing devices.<br>
With the help of the drawings systems known from practice as well as embodiments of the invention will be explained. In the drawings is:<br>

Fig. 7	a further possibility for the coding of a signal, and<br>
Fig. 8	a further possibility for coding a signal.<br>
A yarn processing system P in Fig. 1 (prior art) comprises e.g. as a textile machine T a weaving machine L having a weaving shed 1, a yarn selector device 2 associated to several yarn channels, an electronic controller MCU and a main switch 3. The weaving machine L pulls the weft yarns Y intermittently and e.g. depending from a pattern rapport selectively off<br>
yarn feeding units A to D. Within each yarn channel additional accessory appliances E to H (having not shown signal emitters) may be associated to the yarn feeding units, e.g. yarn breakage detectors or weft yarn monitors. At the locations of the yarn feeding units which are only symbolised by their electronic control units CU further internal or peripheral signal emitters may be placed, e.g. temperature sensors, yarn breakage sensors, voltage sensors, and the like such that for each yarn channel in some cases several signal emitters are provided each of which may generate an alarm signal and/or a status signal S in case that in this yarn channel a situation spontaneously occurs which could lead to a fault in the system or to a fabric fault, respectively.<br>
The appliances E to H are connected via signal lines M to the control unit CU of the associated to yarn feeding units A to D. Furthermore, a separate single signal line MA, MB, MC, MD leads from each yarn feeding unit A to D to a port a to d of the textile machine controller MCU. (In dotted lines as an alternative for the appliance H an own signal line MH is shown e.g. also to the port d.)<br>
In the case that on signal line MA a signal S is transmitted which is received at the port a, then textile machine controller MCU is enabled to determine with the help of the signal S arriving at the port a from which yarn channel the signal stems, and to decide either to open the main switch 3 or to control the yarn selector device 2 such that the respective yarn channel is taken out of operation and that another one of the yarn feeding units A to D substitutes the function of the disturbed yarn channel. In the not shown control panel of the textile machine it can be indicated with the help of the signal S received at the port a at which yarn feeding unit the situation has occurred which led to the signal. In some cases the textile machine controller MCU even may switch off the yarn feeding unit A and the accessory appliance E via the signal line MA.<br>
Since the distance between the textile machine controller MCU and the yarn feeding units A to D is relatively large the many signal lines MA to MD and also MH need considerable cabling, in particular as the number of the yarn feeding units and accessory appliances even may be significantly larger than shown in Fig. 1. For example in the case of a knitting machine there might have more than 40 knitting yarn feeding units and accessory appliances.<br>
The yarn processing system P shown in Fig. 2 is known in practice and is clearly simpler in terms of cabling for transmitting the signals S since there is only a single signal line Mn between the yarn feeding units A to D and the textile machine controller MCU. All yarn feeding units are connected to this signal line Mn. In some cases each yarn feeding unit, (e.g. the yarn feeding unit D) may have an optical or acoustic alarm indicator 4 which is actuated as soon as a signal S is generated and transmitted. In the textile machine controller MCU the signal line Mn is connected to the port e such that the textile machine controller MCU does not receive any information when receiving a signal S in which yarn channel a situation has occurred which caused the signal, for the signals S are equal among each other. The consequence is that the textile machine controller MCU for safety reasons actuates the main switch 3 when a signal S arrives and switches off the textile machine although the operation could have been continued by another control routine.<br>
According to the invention (Figs 3 and 4), to the contrary the respective yarn processing system P is configured such that the textile machine controller MCU is taught by individually coded signals from which yarn channel or from which yarn feeding unit a respective signal originates, even though the signals are transmitted on a single sole signal line Mn, such that the textile machine controller can use the information of the related yarn channel or the related yarn feeding unit A to D to decide which control routine ought to be carried out, i.e. whether the main switch 3 is to be actuated or whether e.g. the yarn selector device 2 has to be switched-over, instead.<br>
The signal emitters provided in or at the yarn feeding units A to D and also the signal emitters in the accessory appliances E to H are configured according to Figs 3 and 4 such that they emit in case of a situation needing a signal anonymous and e.g. largely equal signals S. The respective signal S e.g. in Fig. 3 is transmitted from the accessory appliance E to H on a short line M to the yarn feeding unit control unit CU which is connected to the signal line Mn. Alternatively at least one accessory appliance could be directly connected to the signal line Mn (shown for the accessory appliance H).<br>
In order to identify the signal transmitted on the signal line Mn for the textile machine controller MCU single coding devices CDA, CDB, CDC, CDD are provided at the side of the yarn feeding units A to D in Fig. 3, and in some cases an own coding device CDH at the accessory appliance H. The coding devices CDA to CDD at the side of the yarn feeding units A to D, and in some cases additionally also the coding device CDH, form a coding station CD for individually coding the signals S. Each coding device carries out an individual modulation of the signal length of the signal S such that the signals transmitted on the signal line Mn become coded signals SA to SH by which the textile machine controller MCU identifies the sender or the related yarn channel although all signals arrive at the same port e. The textile machine controller MCU contains a decoding station EC for the coded signals SA to SH.<br>
The yarn processing system according to the invention in Fig. 4 differs from the system in Fig. 3 in that the yarn feeding units A to D (and in some cases even the accessory appliances E) are connected with short signal line branches Z to a common coding station CD which is, in the shown, case contained in a so-called control box CB of the yarn feeding units A to D. The control box CB e.g. is arranged within the power supply box of the yarn processing system. Even other lines are connected to the control box CB which other lines serve other purposes and which extend to or from the respective yarn feeding units A to D.<br>
The signal line branches Z transfer the signals S. Each signal line branch Z is connected to one port a to d of the control box CB or the coding station CT, respectively, which port is associated to a yarn channel or a yarn feeding unit. The coding station CD e.g. contains a simple logic circuitry, e.g. having a small microcontroller, in which logic circuitry an individual selectable coding of the signal S is written down. The accessory appliances, e.g. the accessory appliances E, either are connected via a respective yarn feeding unit controller unit CU or via an own signal line branch Z to one port of the control box CB. A further possibility is indicated such that the accessory appliance E has an own coding device CDE from which coding device CDE a signal line ME extends for the transmission of an already coded signal SE into the signal line Mn. In Fig. 4 the textile machine controller receives on the single signal line Mn only individually coded signals which identify their sender or the related yarn channel, respectively.<br>
The signal emitted by the signal emitter normally is a signal pulse or a signal pulse sequence of a determined signal length. During the coding e.g. the signal length is modulated as will be explained with the help of Figs 5 to 8. The shown possibilities are not intended to define a limited selection, because there exist further possibilities for signal modulations.<br>
The upper signal train in Fig. 5 (the coded signal SA) originates from yam feeding unit A or from the accessory appliance E which is connected to this yarn feeding unit A, respectively. The coded signal SA has a certain signal length between consecutive signal rises 7, 8 and has within the signal length 9 a signal starting section 5 of an individual length 10. With the help of the length 10 the textile machine controller MCU determines that the signal SA originates from the yarn feeding unit A or from the yarn channel of the yarn feeding unit A. Alternatively, the information of the sender may be contained in the individual length of the signal end section 6, or in the length ratio between the sections 5 and 6.<br>
The lower signal train in Fig. 5 represents the coded signal SB from yarn feeding unit B or from the yarn channel of yarn feeding unit B, respectively. Here the individual length 10' of the signal starting section 5 is longer (or shorter) than the length 10.<br>
The coded signal SA from the yarn feeding unit A or from the yarn channel of the yarn feeding unit A, respectively, in Fig. 6, is individually modulated such that the starting section 13 is a longer pulse than a synchronisation pulse (which is equal for all coded signals) which is followed within the signal length 9 by a further shorter pulse 19 having a pulse length 11. The distance between the starting section 13 and the pulse 19 defines a time window which only belongs to the yarn feeding unit A. The time difference between the length 9 and the length 12 is shorter than the sum of two consecutive time sections 14 and 15. A larger length 9, which at least contains the sum of the time sections 14 and 15 but not the sum of the time sections 14,15 and 16, e.g. belongs to the coded signal SB of the yarn feeding unit B, and so on.<br>
In Fig. 7 the signal SA is modulated as a binary code with pulses 17 such that the pulses 17 and their intermediate distances can be read as ones and zeroes.<br>
In Fig. 8 the signal SB for the yarn feeding unit B is modulated as a pulse chain with single pulses 18 within the respective signal length 9 which are intended to be counted. The counting result represents the sender identification.<br>
Only for completeness sake it is to be noted that in such systems conventionally a ground line will be present. The modulation of the signals S results either in coded signals of equal<br>
lengths and having at least one individual signal section within the length, or in coded signals of individual differing lengths with single signal sections or pulses which are equal among each other.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
