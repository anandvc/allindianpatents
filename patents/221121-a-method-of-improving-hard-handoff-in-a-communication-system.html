METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR IMPROVING HARD HANDOFFS<br>
IN CDMA SYSTEMS<br>
Reference(s) to Related Application(s)<br>
The present application claims priority from provisional<br>
application, Serial No. 60/431,296. entitled 'METHOD AND<br>
APPARATUS FOR IMPROVING HARD HANDOFFS IN CDMA<br>
SYSTEMS," filed December 6,2002, which is commonly owned and<br>
incorporated Herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of<br>
communication systems, and more particularly, to a method and<br>
apparatus far improving hard handoff in a CDMA system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
	Currently, a source base station does not convey mobile station<br>
service option capabilities to a target base station during the handoff<br>
process. Rather than having the source base station convey this<br>
information, current standards require the source base station to be<br>
provisioned with the target base station service option capabilities. With<br>
this provisioned capability Information, the source base station proposes<br>
a service option to the target base station to be configured in the mobile<br>
station during the handoff process. However, the target base station<br>
may not be able to support the source- proposed service option due to<br>
resource constrainte or other transient prohibiting factors. As such, the<br>
standard allows the target base station to select an alternate service<br>
option to be configured in the mobile during the handoff process. This<br>
can be problematic. Because the mobile station's service option<br>
capabilities are not conveyed to the target base station, the target base<br><br>
2<br>
station cannot reliably or optimally select an alternate service option to<br>
be configured in the mobile station during the handoff.<br>
	Thus, there is a need for a method of improving hard handoffs in<br>
CDMA systems.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
	FIG, 1 is a system block diagram in support of the method of<br>
improving hard haridoffs of tha present invention,<br>
	FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of an embodiment of the method of<br>
improving hard handoffs of the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
	The present invention provides a method and apparatus for<br>
improving hard handoffs in CDMA systems by conveying service option<br>
information between a source base station and a target base station<br>
during hard handoff- Three improvements can be realized if authorized<br>
mobile station service option capabilities and service option preference<br>
is conveyed to the target base station: 1) the requirement for network<br>
operators to provision each source base station with the service option<br>
capabilities of each target base station is eliminated; 2) the target base<br>
station is able to reliably and optimally choose an alternate service<br>
option based on authorized mobile service option capabilities and the<br>
availability of service option resources in the target base station; and 3)<br>
the target base station is able to optimally choose an alternate service<br>
option based on a mobile station's preferred service option.<br>
	In a first embodiment of the invention, a source base station (BS)<br>
sends a request for handoff to a mobile switching center (MSC), The<br>
request includes a requested service option and a list of service options<br>
supported by a mobile station (MS). Later, the source BS receives a<br>
handoff command including a service option selected by a target BS. In<br>
the first embodiment, the selected service option is either the service<br>
option requested by the source BS or a service option contained in the<br><br>
3<br>
list of service options supported by the MS. The source BS. in turn,<br>
sends a handoff direction message containing the selected service<br>
option to the MS.<br>
	In a second embodiment of the present invention, a target BS<br>
receives a request for handoff. The request iadud.es a requested<br>
service option and a list of service options supported by a MS. Upon<br>
receiving the request, the target BS determines whether the requested<br>
service option is supported. When the requested service option is not<br>
supported, the iarget BS selects an alternate service option from the list<br>
of service options. When the requested service option is supported, the<br>
target BS selects the requested service option, Next, the target BS<br>
sends a handoff request acknowledge containing the selected service<br>
option to a MSC.<br>
	In a third embodiment of the invention, the MSC receives a<br>
request for handoff from the source BS, wherein the request includes a<br>
requested service option and a list of service options supported by the<br>
mobile station. The MSC sends a handoff request message to the<br>
target base station. The handoff request message includes the<br>
requested service option and the fist of service options supported by the<br>
mobile station. Prior to sending the handoff request message to the<br>
target base station, the MSC may remove one or more unauthorized<br>
service options from the list of service options supported by the mobile<br>
station. In that case, the list of sen/ice options supported by the mobile<br>
station will include mobile supported and authorized service options.<br>
	Referring now to FIG. 1, a logical block diagram of a system in<br>
support of the present invention is shown. In particular, FIG. 1 is an<br>
abbreviated reference model for CDMA2000 Radio Access Networks<br>
and illustrates the relationship among network component in support of<br>
the method of the present invention. The function and operation of the<br>
components shown in FIG, 1 are commonly known by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art and will not be discussed in detail herein. FIG. 1 depicts<br>
target and source base stations (BSs) 106, 114 in communication with<br><br>
4<br>
mobile switching center (MSC) 104 over A1, A2 and A5 interfaces. The<br>
A1 interface 105 Is used to provide a signaling connection between the<br>
BS 106,114 and the MSC 104. The A2 Interface is used to provide a<br>
path for user traffic for circuit-oriented voice and Integrated Service<br>
Digital Network (ISDN) calls between the BS 106,114 and the MSC<br>
104. The A5 interface is used to provide a path for user traffic for<br>
circuit-oriented data calls between the BS 106,114 and the MSC 104.<br>
The MSC 104 may in fact be two MSCs if a handoff is occurring inter-<br>
MSC. ln such a case, the two MSCs could communicate with each<br>
other over an ANSi-41 interface (not shown) which is used to provide a<br>
signaling connection and path for user traffic between MSCs serving a<br>
source BS 114 and a target BS 106. User traffic could be<br>
communicated between two MSCs over a User Traffic Interface (not<br>
shown).<br>
	Both the target BS 106 and source BS 114 include a base station<br>
controller (BSC) 108,116, respectively, and one or more base<br>
transceiver stations (BTS) 110,118, respectively. The BTSs 110,118<br>
include wireless transceivers for wire less ly communicating with wireless<br>
devices (not shown) The wireless devices and BTSs 110, 113 provide<br>
for coding, decoding, error checking and correction, Frame type<br>
determination, power control, wireless transmission and reception and<br>
other similar functions as is otherwise generally understood in the art.<br>
Tne BTS 110,118 typically couples with one or more BSCs 108,116<br>
that can include selector distributor units (SDUs). The MSC 104<br>
includes call control mobility management and switch functionality as is<br>
generally understood in the art. In an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the method of the present invention runs in the BS 106,114<br>
and MSC 104 on any commercially available processor or computer,<br>
	FIG, 2 is a flow diagram of an embodiment of the invention<br>
 wherein the target BS 106 changes the service option during a hard<br>
handoff in response to the source BS 114 conveying the service options<br>
supported by the MS 202. At step a, based on an MS report that it<br><br><br>
5<br>
crossed a network specified threshold for signal strength or for other<br>
reasons, the source BS 114 recommends a hard handgff to one or more<br>
cells in the domain of the target BS 106. The source BS 114 sends a<br>
handc-ff required message with the list of cells and a requested service<br>
option to the MSC 104. The message also contains a ttat of service<br>
options supported by the MS 202. This service option list may be<br>
prioritized according to the MS's preference.<br>
	At step b. the MSC 104 sands a handoff request message to the<br>
target BS 106. This message carries the list of MS supported service<br>
options. Any service option priority information is preserved. In<br>
addition, the MSC 104 may remove unauthorized service options from<br>
this list. In such a caseP the target BS 106 receives mo bite-supported<br>
and mobile-authorized service options. Upon receipt of the handoff<br>
request message from the MSC 104, the target BS 106 selects a service<br>
option to be used during tne handoff. If the target BS 106 determines<br>
that the requested service option is not supported, it selects an alternate<br>
service option based on the MS's service option capabilities, service<br>
option priorities, and the resources available in the target BS 106. The<br>
target BS 106 then allocates appropriate radio resources and initiates<br>
connection of the call. The target 6S 106 sends null forward traffic<br>
channel frames to the MS 202 (step C).<br>
	At step d, the target BS 106 sends a handoff request<br>
acknowledge message to the MSC 104. The target BS 106 includes the<br>
new service option it selected in the service configuration record<br>
information -atement contained in the handoff acknowledge message. At<br>
step e, upon receipt of the handoff request acknowledge message, the<br>
MSC 104 prepares to switch from the source BS 114 to the target BS<br>
106 and sends a handoff command to the source BS 114. The MSC<br>
104 includes the service option it received from the handoff request<br>
acknowledgement message in the handoff command message.<br>
	At step f, the source BS 114 sends a handoff direction message<br>
containing the new service option (General Handoff Direction Message<br><br>
6<br>
or Universal Handoff Direction Message) to the MS 202. At step g, the<br>
MS 202 may acknowledge the handoff direction message by sending an<br>
MS ack order to the source BS 114. At step h, the source BS sends a<br>
handoff commenced message to the MSC 104 to notify it that the MS<br>
202 has been ordered to move to the target BS channel. At step i, the<br>
MS 202 sends reverse traffic channel frames or the traffic channel<br>
preamble to the target BS 106.<br>
	At step j, the MS 202 sends a handoff completion message to the<br>
target BS 106. At step kh the target BS 106 sends the BS ack order to<br>
the MS 202 over the air interface. At step I, the target BS 106 sends a<br>
handoff complete message to the MSC 104 to notify it that the MS 202<br>
has successfully completed the hard handoff. At step m, the MSC 104<br>
sends a clear command to the source BS 114. At step n. the source BS<br>
114 sends a clear complete message to the MSC 104 to notify it that<br>
clearing has been accomplished.<br>
	While the invention may be susceptible to various modifications<br>
and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way<br>
of example in the drawings and have been described in detail herein.<br>
However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to<br>
be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is to<br>
cover all modification, equivalents and alternatives falling within the<br>
