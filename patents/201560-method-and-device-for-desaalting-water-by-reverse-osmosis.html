				<td>The invention pertains to a method and a device for desalting water by reverse osmosis, particularly for desalting seawater, in which saltwater (10) is introduced under a first pressure (pi) into a pressure-compensation device (2) and conducted from pressure-compensation device (2) at a second, higher pressure (pa) into a membrane module (3), wherein desalted water (12) and concentrated saltwater (13) are conducted out of membrane module (3), wherein the concentrated saltwater (13) conducted out of membrane module (3) is continuously introduced at roughly second pressure (pa) into pressure-compensation device (2) and used there to apply roughly second pressure (pi) to saltwater (10) introduced into pressure-compensation device (2) and to introduce saltwater (11) into membrane module (3), and wherein the introduction of concentrated saltwater (13) into pressure-compensation device (2) and the conduction of concentrated saltwater (14) out of pressure-compensation device (2) are accomplished by means of controlled main valves (V1,V3,V4,V6). The main valves are subject to high mechanical stresses, particularly during the opening and closing of the valves. To reduce or avoid these, it is provided according to the invention that secondary valves (V2, V2’,V5,V5’) arranged in parallel with main valves (V1,V3,V4,V6) are controlled such that load peaks during opening and/or closing of main valves (V1,V3,V4,V6) are reduced.

				<td>The invention pertains to a method for desalting water by reverse osmosis according to the precarious; of Claim 1, as well as to a device for carrying out this method.<br>
Such a method and such a device are described in German Patent Application Cn. 199 33 1.47.2. Therein, the saltwater is introduced under a tryst pressure into a pressure-compensation device and introduced from the pressure-compensation device, under a second, higher pressure, into a membrane module, desalted water and concentrated saltwater being removed from the membrane module. Desalted water is to be understood here as water with a salt content reduced in relation to the saltwater introduced into the device. To increase the efficiency aide thus the energy balance for such a method and such a device, it is proposed there that the concentrated saltwater removed from the membrane module be introduced continuously under the second pressure into the pressure-compensation device, and be used there to apply the second pressure to the saltwater introduced into the pressure-compensation device and to introduce the saltwater into the membrane module. Introduction of the concentrated saltwater into tuff’s pressure-compensation device is accomplished wife check valves, and draining of the concentrated saltwater out of the pressure compensation device is accomplished here by means of controlled main valves. These controlled main valves are preferably actively controllable, and arc an-ganged in the appropriate connecting lines between the membrane module and the pressure compensation device or between the pressure-compensation device and the output for the concentrated saltwater.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
