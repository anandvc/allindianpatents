				<td>The present invention relates to a feeding device for a material processing plant, as well as to a vibrating vertical cone crusher equipped with such a device.<br>
Hov/ever, although more especially intended for such applications, the said feeding device can also be used, in particular, with other types of crushers and breakers.<br>
Is preferable for the machine to operate under load, that is to say for its crushing chamber be continually fed with materials. Quite particular care thus has to be devoted to the design of its feeding system.<br>
At the present time, the most conventional one of the feeding systems is the chute, which Is fixed to the.apparatus Itself. The shape and dimensions can vary according to the technology used for the crusher.<br>
While such devices ensure that the crushing chamber is fed, they nonetheless have the drawback of generating a static pressure, which is due, in particular, to the mass of the materials which impairs the efficiency of the machine and restricts its performance.<br>
To overcome these drawbacks, certain devices have been devised, such as, for example, those having a rotating chute.<br>
Another device has also been developed, this device consisting of a small hopper integral with the cone crusher, but having a flat bottom equipped v/ith two horizontal disks.<br>
One of the disks is fixed and integral with the cylindrical, vertical wall, and has openings in the form of spiral arcs centred on the arc of the disk. The second disk, which is mobile, comprises the same openings, but these are a little wider.<br>
The displacement of this disk by a jack makes it possible to control the openings partially by distributing feeding into the crushing chamber.<br>
Another known device is constituted by a shaft emerging onto a distribution plate, provided above the crusher and integral, or otherwise, with<br>
the central cone of the said crusher, in such a way as to distribute the material flowing Into the crushing chamber around the cone.<br>
Such devices have the drawback, however, of only permitting the processing of fine grain sizes,<br>
Furthermore, in storage hoppers or silos, there are known discharge devices having a conical central unit at the base of the hopper, designed to vibrate to facilitate the flow of the stored materials when these tend to stick and/or form In versed U shapes. The material is then ro-centrod before It leaves the hopper.<br>
It is noted, therefore, that all of the 'aforementioned devices lead, when used in a cone-crusher, to the presence of material In the area of the upper portion of the said cone,' thus giving rise to wear forces generating wear, power consumption and considerable mechanical stress, which may be unnecessary.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a feeding device that overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks and makes It possible to protect certain members of the plant equipped with the said device, in particular from wear phenomena.<br>
Another object of the present Invention is to provide a feeding device that can be used with materials having grain sizes that can vary over a wide range,<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device that enables the plant equipped with tho said device to be fed continuously while, at the same time, controlling static pressure.<br>
A further object of the present invention Is to provide a vibrating cone crusher, equipped with a feeding device, in which wear In the upper, possibly non-active, portions of the cone is reduced or eliminated.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a vibrating cone<br>
crusher, equipped with a feeding device, In which the mechanical Stresses<br>
exerted on the cone are considerably reduced and/or displaced.<br>
Another object of Ihe present invention is to provide a vibrating cone crusher, equipped with a feeding device, in which the static pressure inside the crushing chamber can be controlled.<br>
Further objects and advantages oMhe present invention will emerge in the course of the follow/ing description, which is given only by way of illustration and is not intended to limit same.<br>
According to the invention, the feeding device for the material orocessing plant such as, or instance, a crusher, includes an outer envelope, or shell, and a bell, provided at least internally in the said outer shell and secured to the latter, the said bell being provided so as to be orientated substantially parallel to the direction of flow of the material in such a way as to permit diversion of the said material to protect mambers, provided downstream, of the said plant.<br>
The invention also relates to a vibrating vertical cone crusher equipped with such a feeding device.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a vibrating crusher (2), with a vertical cone (16) and a crushing chamber (17), fitted with a feeding device (1), said feeding device comprising an outer envelope (3) and a bell (6), provided inside said outer envelope (3) and secured to the latter by means of wings (11), said bell (6) being spaced and positioned above said vertical cone (16), arranged substantially parallel to the flow direction of matter, in order to enable deviation of said matter to protect said cone (16) laid out downstream of said feeding device (1), said vertical cone (16) being free with respect to said bell (6).<br>
It will be more readily understood from a study of the following description, accompanied by the annexed drawings, which form an integral part thereof, and wherein:<br>

2;<br>
The present invention relates to a device for feeding a material processing plant such as, In particular, a crusher. This can thus be, for example, a feeding device in which the flow of material is facilitated by vibrations generated by the said plant.<br>
As «hown in figures 1 to 3, device 1, according to the invention, for feeding a material processing plant 2 includes an outer shell 3. The latter Is located, for example, underneath a storage hopper 4, from which the said material flows, in particular by gravity feed.<br>
The said outer shell 3 has, for example, a rotationally symmetrical shape, in particular frustoconical or cylindrical. Its axis of symmetry 5 is orientated, for example, substantially vertically, in particular in the prolongation of the longitudinal axis of the said hopper 4 and/or of that of the<br>
said plant 2,which are, for thet pait too, as applicable, provided SO as to be<br>
substantially vertical.<br>
According to the invention, the said feeding device 1 also includes a bell-shaped element 6, provided at least Internally in the said outer shell 3 and secured to the latter. The said bell 6 is provided so as to be orientated substantial y parallel to direction of flow of the material. The latter can thus be diverted, in the directions of arrows 7, 8, thus making It possible to protect the members 9 of the said plant 2.<br>
In fact, the said member or members that are provided downstream are no longer, at least partially, in contact with the material. The expression « provided downstream » Is to be taken as meaning, in particular, that the said members 9 are located downstream of the said feeding device 1, beneath the said bell 6, and/or, as shown, are capped by the said bell 6.<br>
The said bell 6 Is provided, in particular, so as to be level with and/or emerge at the exit from the said outer shell 3. It thus favours annular distribution of the material. Furthermore, the said bell 6 has, for example, a rotationally symmetrical shape, for instance cylindrical or cylindroconical.<br>
According to the different exemplary forms of embodiment Illustrated, the material flows vertically and the axis of symmetry 10 of the said bell 6 Is<br>
provided, for its part also, as apparent from the explanations given above, so<br>
as to be orientated substantially In the same direction<br>
The said outer shell 3 and the said bell 6 are secured to one another, particular, by means of wing members 11, provided so as to be vertical and distributed uniformly around the said axis of symmetry 10 of the said bell 6.<br>
Feeding device 1 according to the invention thus includes, in particular, three said wing members 11, disposed in a star configuration and spaced apart from one another by 120°, or four said wing members, spaced apart from one another by 90°.<br>
The said wing members 11 can be provided, as applicable, so as to be orientatable, for example by each pivoting about a substantially horizontal axis. In this way, they will make' it possible, in particular, to adjust the flow rate of material by closing to a greater or lesser extent the passage between bell 6 and outer shell 3, and to moderate the static load.<br>
As illustrated, the said outer shell 6, the said bell 6 and/or the said member 9 are for example, coaxial.<br>
With reference, now, to figure 4, it will be noted that, according to a first form of embodiment, the said outer shell 3 is made In one piece. According to another form of embodiment, illustrated in 'figure !5, the said outer shell 3 is constituted by a lov/er element 12, referred to hereinafter as the 'chute', and by an upper element, 13, emerging in the said chute 12.<br>
Furthermore, as illustrated in figures 1, 3 and 4, the said bell 6 is, for example, made in one piece or, as Illustrated In the other figures, constituted by a cupola 14 and by a tubular element 15, fitting into the said cupola 14.<br>
When the said outer shell 3 is formed, as mentioned earlier, by two independent elements 12, 13, the said bell 6, when it Is made in one piece, and/or its cupola, when it is not, are, in particular, secured to the said upper element 13. As to the said tubular element 15, this is, for example, mounted on the said chute 12.<br>
According to certain applications, it can also be contemplated providing a bell 6 rising upstream of the said outer shell 3 and thus emerging, for example, in hopper 4.<br>
The present invention also relates to a vibrating crusher 2 with a vertical cone 16 and a crushing chamber 17 equipped with a feeding device 1 as described earlier.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the said device 1 is provided between a storage hopper 4 and the said crusher 2 and enables the latter to be fed with material, in particular through the combined effect of gravity and/or the vibrations generated by the said crusher 2.<br>
Bell 6 of the said feeding device 2 is provided, for example, above crushing chamber 17 of the said crusher 2 and thus makes it possible to protect members 9 provided therein by isolating them, at least partially, from the flow of material.<br>
This concerns, in particular, the said cone 16 provided, according to the different exemplary forms of embodiment illustrated, so as to emerge externally above the said crushing chamber 17. Bell 6 is then provided so as to be capable of capping, at least partially, the emerging end 18 of the said cone 16, a residual space 21 being provided between these two members.<br>
As it: is no longer directly surrounded by material In the area of the said end 13, the said cone 16 is free in its movements, at the very least In this area, that is to say, in particular, in a zone wherein the said cone 16<br>
does not play a part in fragmentation.<br>
wear is inus avoided, in addition, tnis aosence or material ana tne<br>
reduction in the static pressures between pieces 16 and 19, obtained thanks to the isolation provided by bell 6, considerably reduce the mechanical stresses exerted on cone 16, the latter then being able to vibrate, move and/or rotate while subjected to lesser forces.<br>
The said cone 16 and the said bell 6 are, in particular, as already mentioned earlier, provided so as to be coaxial.<br>
As regards the said crusher 2, the latter includes, by way of example, a frame 20 having a vibrating ring 19 provided, at least partially, facing the said cone 16.<br>
The said ring 19 is vibrated, in particular, by means of a vibrating device with unbalance weights, not shown, mounted on frame 20, and thus enables the material to bo crushed against the said cone 16.<br>
The said ring 19 and the said cone 16 are, in particular, coaxial, the said cone 16 being possibly free to rotate about its longitudinal axis in such a way as to facilitate the flow of the material during crushing.<br>
As mentioned earlier, according to the different exemplary forms of embodiment Illustrated, the end 16 of the said cone 16 is provided so as to emerge above the said ring 19. <br>
According to a first form of embodiment, the said bell 6 protects the said upper end 18, In particular, over the entire corresponding height of the<br>
said cone 10, that is to say over the portion of the cone 10 locatad above the<br>
upper edge of ring 19. According to other forms of embodiment, the said befl 6 can also be of a smaller or greater length, entering, In the latter case, crushing chamber 17.<br>
The said bell 6 thus caps, at least partially, the emerging end 18 of the<br>
said cone 16.<br>
The said outer shell 3 rests, for example, on the said frame 20 In the' area of the said ring 19  If the said outer shell 3 is constituted, as the possibility thereof has been referred to earlier, by a chute 12 and by an upper element 13, the said chute 12 is then secured, for example, to the frame 20, while upper element 13 is suspended from hopper 4.<br>
In this connection, in the event of an outer shell 3 made in a single element being used, the said outer shell 3 is secured, directly or indirectly, to the said crusher 2, while remaining free in relation to the said hopper 4, under which it is disposed.<br>
Such arrangements thus enable the said crusher 2 and the said hopper 4 to be dissociated from one another, In this way limiting the transfer of static loads.<br>
It should also be noted that, in order to be able, if so desired, to operate using a wet process, the crusher according to the invention can<br>
include means for injecting a fluid, such as, in particular, water, into the said crushing chamber 2 from the said feeding device 1.<br>
Construction of the said feeding device 2 in two parts, 12, 13, facilitates, moreover, such water introduction and distribution. Water can, indeed, be injected at the interface between the said upper element 13 and the said chute 12.<br>
According to another form of embodiment, arrangements can also be made for Injection in the area of bell 6, in residual space 21. For this purpose, the said wing members 11 have, for example, a thickness enabling conduits to run through to the said bell 6.<br>
This being said, according to one form of embodiment, not illustrated, arrangements could also be made to secure the said bell 0 to the said frame 20.<br>
Other forms of embodiment, within the grasp of a man of the art, could, of course, have been contemplated, without thereby departing from the scope of the present application.<br><br><br><br>
