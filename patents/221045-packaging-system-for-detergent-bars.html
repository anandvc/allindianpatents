THE PATENTS ACT, 1970 (39 OF 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 ; rule 13)<br>
1. TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
PACKAGING SYSTEM FOR DETERGENT BARS<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act. 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever house, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to packaging of detergent bars and in particular to a packaging system comprising transparent detergent wrapper for packaging of detergent bars and the like. The transparent detergent wrapper would apart from enabling incorporation of printed matters, add to the aesthetic outlook of the packaged detergent, is adapted to favour maintaining desired packaging characteristics for effective storage and transit of the detergent bar while maintaining its quality and characteristics under diverse transit / storage conditions.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is well known in the art to provide packaging papers such as surface printed Chromo, Maplitho or Poster Paper and extrusion coated with polyethylene or coated with hot melt lacquer. Again surface printed chromo, maplitho or poster paper laminated with PET or BOPP on the printed surface and coated with hot melt lacquer on the other side of the paper is also known. Combinations of reverse printed PET or BOPP laminated to Chromo, Maplitho or Poster Paper and coated with hot meld lacquer on the other side or said reverse printed PET/BOPP laminated to Metallized PET or Metallized BOPP with further laimination to Chromo, Maplitho or Poster Paper and coated with hot meld lacquer on the other side or said reverse printed PET/BOPP laminated to BOPP, PET lamination to polyethylene are also well known. Furthermore, carton packing such as surface printed paper based carton pack with or without lamination with BOPP/PET on the printed surface or the reverse printed PET or BOPP laminated with paperboard carton pack is also well known.<br>
It is also known to use packaging films such as multi-layer heat sealable packaging films for packaging of products. Biaxially oriented polyethylene terephtalate commonly referred to as "oriented polyester" "OPET" is a well-known packaging film.<br>
US 4,765,999 discloses multiple layer non-oriented heat sealable films having a base substrate layer of poly(ethylene terephtalate) (polyester) or polyester co-<br>
2<br><br>
polymer and at least one heat sealable surface layer of a co-polyester. Such films are adapted to replace heat sealable OPET films for extremely demanding applications such as microwave popcorn bags. Importantly, it is suggested that the relatively amorphous nature of such non-oriented films provide for additional advantages compared to the relatively crystalline nature of the OPET films.<br>
EP 1121305 B1 discloses bar of soap having wrapped laterally of the bar around at least a longitudinal extent of the bar, a stiffening member comprising a stiff sheet material having at least respective outer surfaces thereof each provided by a plastic material wherein at least a part of the stiffening material is transparent. This packaging was proposed based on a finding that if a bar or soap has wrapped around at least a longitudinal extent thereof, a stiffing member at least respective outer surface of which are each provided by a plastic material then mould growth on and within it can be entirely avoided.<br>
EP 1183193 B1 discloses yet another soap bar packaged in a transparent package, said soap bar having a generally rectangular shape with two sides of a minor dimension and two sides of a major dimension, a first inner film substantially enveloping said soap bar and open on the two sides of a minor dimension, a second substantially transparent outer film overlying said first film and fully enveloping said soap bar characterized in that said inner film is substantially transparent and has a light transmission of more than 85% and a clarity of more than 90%, the thickness of said first film to said second film being 2:1 to 5:1, the stiffness of said first film to said second film being 7:1 to 35:1 and said soap bar being a translucent soap bar. The first film is selectively provided as a stiffener to provide structural protection for the soap while the second film fully envelopes the soap bar and the first film.<br>
- It would be apparent from the above that while several varieties of packaging materials especially useful for packaging of detergent bar are available and made known to the art the varieties presently available are either found to involve complexities in manufacture or cost-extensive or fail to provide the desired mechanical strength and stiffness to facilitate the effective transit of packaged<br>
3<br><br>
product. Moreover, in case of required transparent wrappers for detergents such problems turn more complex. Also ,it is found that most of such known packaging also have problem / limitations in effectively protecting the aroma of the product especially required to be safeguarded in case of perfumed products such as detergent bars and the like. In addition, it is also found that in case of some of the above-discussed packaging material there is sometimes the additional problem of distortion/shrinkage of seals in case of use of high sealing temperatures sometimes required for high temperature heat sealing of the packaged detergents.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a packaging system for detergent bars and the like in the form of trafisparent detergent wrappers which would have superior mechanical strength and stiffness and thus have better transit performance as well as required storage characteristics for the product/detergent.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide for a packaging system in particular transparent detergent wrappers involving superior stiffness, better machinability and flexibility for better shape formation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide for a packaging system for detergent bars and the like which apart from serving as a good protective cover for the product would also enable maintaining the desired aesthetic outlook of packaged product in addition to serving as an effective aroma barrier for better retention of the perfume in detergents.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide for a packaging system for detergent bars and the like which would avoid the limitations of several conventional packaging materials as regards distortion, shrinkage of seals at higher sealing temperature and thereby favour wide scope of application and use of the packaging.<br>
4<br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention would enable provision of durable transparent packaging system of detergent bars and the like which would favour providing better aesthetic look to the packaged product involving printed and/or transparent window configuration.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for processes for packaging of detergent bars and the like which would enable provision of a wider heat seal temperature window thereby favour obtaining quality packaging of detergent involving cost-effective and convenient machinability characteristics.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to favour providing quality heat sealable transparent packaging for detergents and the like without problems of seal distortion/shrinkage even at high temperature sealing.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a packaging system for detergent bars and the like comprising:<br>
-	a first PET film having a heat sealable side and a non-heat sealable reverse thereof ;<br>
-	a second PET film also having a heat sealable side and a non-heat sealable reverse thereof,<br>
-	said non-heat sealable sides of the first and second PET films adapted to be laminated together to provide a transparent laminated structure wherein the detergent is packaged such that the central portions of the laminated structure define a lap seal with the inner side and the outer side of the laminate structure sealed together and the end seals are selectively provided between the outer and inner sides of the laminate structure.<br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect of the present invention there is provided a packaging system for detergent bars and the like comprising::<br>
5<br><br>
-	a first PET film having a heat sealable side and a non-heat sealable reverse thereof;<br>
-	a second PET film also having a heat sealable side and a non-heat sealable reverse thereof<br>
-	at least one of the non-heat sealable sides of the laminate structure having printed matter therein ;<br>
-	said non-heat sealable sides of the first and second PET films adapted to be laminated together to provide a transparent laminated structure wherein the detergent is packaged such that the central portions of the laminated structure define a lap seal with the inner side and the outer side of the laminate structure sealed together and the end seals are selectively provided between the outer and inner sides of the laminate structure.<br>
In accordance with yet further aspect of the present invention there is provided a packaging system for detergent bars and the like comprising:<br>
-	a first PET film having a heat sealable side and a non-heat sealable reverse thereof;<br>
-	a second PET film also having a heat sealable side and a non-heat sealable reverse thereof<br>
-	said non-heat sealable side of the first film of the laminate structure having printed matter therein ;<br>
-	said non-heat sealable sides of the first and second PET films adapted to be laminated together to provide a transparent laminated structure wherein the detergent is packaged such that the central portions of the laminated structure define a lap seal with the inner side and the outer side of the laminate structure sealed together and the end seals are selectively provided between the outer and inner sides of the laminate structure.<br>
In the above disclosed packaging system of the invention the dual layer packaging of heat sealable PET with the non-heat sealable portions of the respective layers laminated enable providing of well protected printed matter on the packaging to add to the aesthetic value of the product and on the other hand<br>
6<br><br>
provide for a more rigid and superior mechanical strength and stiffness to the transparent package.<br>
In accordance with further aspect of the present invention there is provided for a packaging system for detergent bars and the like comprising a transparent laminate structure comprising a first layer of heat sealable PET reverse printed on the non-heat sealable portion thereof, a second layer of heat sealable PET having Its non-heat sealable reverse laminated with respect to the reverse printed non-heat sealable portion of the first layer, wherein the printing region includes an unprinted area/window to facilitate viewing of the product / detergent through the package.<br>
In accordance with the above disclosed laminated structure of the invention it is thus possible to on one hand maintain the desired mechanical strength and stiffness in transparent detergent wrappers and on the other hand provide for variety of printed region which on its own and/or in combination with the shape and configuration of the product/detergent packaged would favour better aesthetic outlook to the packaged product.<br>
In accordance with the preferred aspect the above packaging in the form of transparent detergent wrappers is proposed in case of detergent bars of regular rectangular shape, most of the middle portion of all sides to be flat or recessed but no raised portion beyond the flat area and the corners to be either at 90 degrees or slightly rounded.<br>
The transparent laminate structure constituting the packaging system of the invention is thus comprised of the heat sealable PET reverse printed and laminated with the help of adhesive to another layer to heat sealable PET. In particular.the printing on the first heat sealable layer on its reverse is laminated to the non-heat sealable side of the second layer. As stated above, the printing design can have windows (unprinted area) so that the intended part of the detergent is visible to the Consumers even in a packed bar. The bar would be envelope wrapped such that the belly seal is a lap seal (inner side of the laminate<br>
7<br><br>
to be sealed with the outer side) and the end seals are preferably partly between the outer to outer and partly sealable inner to outer sides of the laminate.<br>
Importantly, the above disclosed packaging system in the form of transparent detergent wrappers would provide for a packaging structure for detergents and the like having superior mechanical strength, better transit performance as well as stiffness. Importantly, the combination of the two layers of heat sealable PET in the system of the invention would enable better processability / machinability and better shape formation. In particular, the combination would enable high temperature sealing of the package free of distortion/shrinkage of seals and therefore provide for wider flexibility in use / application of such packaging systems.<br>
Moreover, the duWl layer packaging proposed apart from giving the desired stiffness and mechanical support to the structure also favours maintaining the desired print in the packaging free of distortions / erase during transit/storage. Moreover, the dual packaging facilitates maintaining desired barrier for any loss of aroma from the packaging.<br>
As is usually known, the PET films used in the packaging system are made heat sealable by addition of a co-polymer in one of the skin layers during the manufacturing of the film to constitute the heat sealable side of the packaging.<br>
The wrapping process of the proposed detergent bar is basically envelope wrapping in which the belly seal is a lap seal and the end seals are between outer to outer and inner to outer sides of the laminate.<br>
The details of invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations in relation to the accompanying figures wherein:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the dual layers proposed in the packaging system in accordance with the present invention.<br>
8<br><br>
Figure 2 illustrates the provision of printed portion on the non-heat sealable side<br>
of the first layer of the packaging system.<br>
Figure 3 shows the lamination obtained there between the first layer in particular<br>
its printed non-heat sealable reverse with the non-heat sealable side of the<br>
second layer to constitute the packaging system of the invention.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the packaged detergent, which is packaged by the dual layer<br>
transparent  laminate  structure  packaging   in  accordance  with  the  present<br>
invention.<br>
Reference is first invited to figure 1 which shows the provision of the two layer heat sealable PET used in the packaging system of the invention. Both said layer (L1, L2) each have a heat sealable side (HS1;HS2) comprising the added co-polymer and a reverse, which is a non-heat sealable sides (NHS1;NHS2). As would be apparent from Figures 1 and 2, the printing is proposed on the non-heat sealable (NHS1) reverse of the first layer and thereafter the non-heat sealable sides of the two layers (NHS1) (NHS2) are laminated with respect to one another by adhesive, see Fig 3. Such a lamination on one hand effects better mechanical strength and stiffness to the packaging and at the same time protects the print (P) on the non-heat sealable sides of the first layer so that the printing is not tampered or distorted during transit / storage.<br>
Importantly, as clearly evident from Figures 4 the detergent bar is basically envelope wrapped such that the belly seal is a lap seal LS (inner side of the laminate to be sealed with the outer side) and end seals ES are partly between outer to outer and partly between inner to outer sides of the laminate. The dual layer lamination" clearly "and sufficiently achieves better mechanical strength and stiffness for effective transit, machinability and better shape formation. The aroma is advantageously retained better in the packaging system of the invention, which adds to its utilities especially in case of packaging of perfumed products such as detergent and the like. Importantly, the selective heat sealable PET laminate structure enables obtaining distortions/shrinkage free seals in a wide operating temperature thereby providing for a wider scale application and flexibility in use of such heat sealable package laminated packages.<br>
9<br><br>
The invention would therefore serve as a better packaging means for detergents and the like at cost-effective rates which would be simple and cost-effective to apply and at the same time provide for the much desired added aesthetic outlook to the packaged product/detergent.<br>
