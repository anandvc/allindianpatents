DESCRIPTION<br>
SHIELDING FILM, SHIELDED PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD, SHIELDED<br>
FLEXIBLE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD, METHOD OF MANUFACTURING<br>
SHIELDING FILM, AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SHIELDED<br>
PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a shielding film<br>
shielding a printed circuit board etc. which is used in a<br>
device such as a computer, a communication device, a<br>
printer, a mobile phone, a video camera, or the like, a<br>
method of manufacturing the shielding film, a shielded<br>
printed circuit board and a shielded flexible printed<br>
circuit board that are manufactured by using the shielding<br>
film, and a method of manufacturing a shielded printed<br>
circuit board.<br>
Background Art<br>
A flexible printed circuit board (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as 'FPC') has a printed circuit, which is<br>
provided on at least one surface of a flexible insulating<br>
film such as a polyimide film or a polyester film with or<br>
without an adhesive between the printed circuit and the<br>
flexible film.  According to need, a flexible insulating<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
film having openings is adhered on the surface of the<br>
printed circuit by an adhesive, or a protective layer is<br>
formed on the surface of the printed circuit.   The<br>
openings are formed on the flexible insulating film so as<br>
to correspond to portions on which terminals used to mount<br>
circuit components or terminals used to be connected with<br>
an external board are formed.   The protective layer is<br>
formed on the surface of the printed circuit by methods of<br>
coating, drying, exposing, developing, and heat-treating a<br>
photosensitive insulating resin.  The FPC is widely used<br>
to  build  a  circuit  into  a  complex mechanism  of  an<br>
electronic device such as a mobile phone, video camera,<br>
personal lap top computer or the like which have been<br>
rapidly  miniaturized  and  multi-functionalized.     in<br>
addition, the FPC is also used to connect a moving unit<br>
such as a printer head with a control unit due to its<br>
excellent flexibility.  A shielding countermeasure against<br>
electromagnetic wave has been required for the electronic<br>
device in which the FPC is widely used.  Accordingly, a<br>
shielded flexible  printed circuit board  (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as a 'shielded FPC) having the shielding<br>
countermeasure against electromagnetic wave has been, used<br>
as the FPC to be built in the device.<br>
In addition, similar to a flex rigid board or a<br>
flexboard (registered trade mark), the following FPC has<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
been used recently. In the FPC, the printed circuit board<br>
is partially laminated to form multilayered portions used<br>
to mount components, and cable portions extend outside<br>
from the multilayered portions. Specifically, Similar to<br>
the electronic device, shielding countermeasures against<br>
electromagnetic wave have been required for the cable<br>
portions of the boards.<br>
The shielded FPC uses a flexible insulating film as<br>
a cover film. Furthermore, a shielding layer is provided<br>
on one surface of the cover film, and a releasable<br>
adhesive film having adhesion is adhered on the other<br>
surface of the cover film in order to form a<br>
reinforcement-shielding film. Then, the shielding film is<br>
adhered on at least one surface of the FPC by using a<br>
conductive adhesive and by heating and pressing the<br>
shielding film and the FPC. Further, after the shielding<br>
layer is electrically connected to the grounding circuit<br>
formed on the FPC by the conductive adhesive, the adhesive<br>
film is released. Here, when an electric connection<br>
between the shielding layer and the grounding circuit is<br>
not particularly required, a normal adhesive not having<br>
conductivity may be used instead of the conductive<br>
adhesive to adhere the shielding layer to the grounding<br>
circuit. The FPC is directly connected to a rigid circuit<br>
board,  or  the  multilayered  portions  -used  to  mount<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
components are formed to be connected to the cable<br>
portions like the flex rigid board or the flexboard. In<br>
this case, according to need, a shielding layer is also<br>
provided on a rigid circuit board or the multilayered<br>
portions used to mount components similar to the above-<br>
mentioned structure. Therefore, it is possible to<br>
adequately manage electromagnetic wave.<br>
However, there are many cases where the cover film<br>
used in the shielding film is made of engineering plastic<br>
such as polyphenylenesulfide (PPS), polyester, aromatic<br>
aramid, and the thickness of the cover film is thick (for<br>
example, 9 pin) or the stiffness thereof is strong. For<br>
this reason, the flexibility of the cover film<br>
deteriorates. Moreover, when the adhesive film is<br>
released from the shielded FPC and then a glass epoxy<br>
board or the like is adhered on the cover film to<br>
reinforce the shielded FPC, PPS barely adheres to the<br>
glass epoxy board or the like due to the fact that PPS has<br>
difficulty in adhesion.<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, the<br>
following shielding film and a method of manufacturing the<br>
shielding film has been disclosed in JP-A-2004-95566. In<br>
the shielding film, a resin having excellent thermal<br>
resistance and adhesiveness is coated on one surface of a<br>
separation film via a release agent layer to form the<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
shielding film, and an adhesive layer is further provided<br>
on the cover film via a metal layer. Here, since the<br>
cover film has excellent flexibility and is formed by the<br>
coating method, the thickness of the cover film is thin,<br>
that is, about 5 pm. In addition, since the cover film<br>
has adhesion, it is possible to easily adhere a glass<br>
epoxy board after the release of the separation film.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
However, the following problems are generated. That<br>
is, (1) the cover film, which is formed by coating the<br>
resin having excellent thermal resistance such as a<br>
polyimide resin, an epoxy resin, or the like, is soft.<br>
For example, a shielded FPC used for a moving unit such as<br>
a mobile phone, a printer, or the like, is worn by rubbing<br>
against another part such as a housing or the like, and<br>
does not serve as a protective layer after the release of<br>
the separation film. (2) In addition, when the shielded<br>
FPC is heated and pressed, the cover film serving as a<br>
base is softened. For this reason, dents occur on the<br>
upper side of the insulation removed portions for<br>
connecting the grounding circuit. As a result, breakage<br>
such as a cracking, fracture, or the like occurs in the<br>
metal layer. (3) Furthermore, the cover film has<br>
excellent adhesion.  For this reason, when the cover film<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
comes in contact with a conveyor jig, conveyor belt, or<br>
the like on which the circuit board is loaded to be<br>
conveyed, in a process requiring heat, such as a reflow<br>
process in the process of mounting circuit components, the<br>
cover film is attached thereto. As a result, the blocking<br>
resistance deteriorates.<br>
Consequently, a method in which a cover film having<br>
high hardness is made of a resin having excellent abrasion<br>
resistance has been considered. However, the cover film<br>
having high hardness is brittle. For this reason, when<br>
the shielding film using the cover film is adhered on a<br>
foundation film including printed circuits, the cover film<br>
having high hardness cracks due to the concavity and<br>
convexity of the insulation removed portions of the<br>
insulating film.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a<br>
shielding film, a shielded printed circuit board, a<br>
shielded flexible printed circuit board in which each have<br>
a cover film not having breakage of a metal layer, and<br>
having excellent abrasion resistance and blocking<br>
resistance, and no cracking is generated. In addition, it<br>
is an object of the invention to provide a method of<br>
manufacturing the shielding film and a method of<br>
manufacturing the shielded printed circuit board.<br>
 A shielding film according to an aspect of the<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
invention includes: a separation film; a cover film<br>
provided on one surface of the separation film; and an<br>
adhesive layer, which is formed on the surface of the<br>
cover film opposite to the separation film via a metal<br>
layer. In this case, the cover film includes at least one<br>
hard layer and at least one soft layer, and the surface of<br>
the cover film facing the separation film is composed of<br>
the hard layer.<br>
According to the shielding film of the invention,<br>
the surface face is composed of the hard layer, and the<br>
hard layer having excellent abrasion resistance serves as<br>
a protective layer after the release of the separation<br>
film. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the abrasion<br>
of the cover film. Furthermore, since the hard layer has<br>
excellent blocking resistance, the hard layer is not<br>
attached to another part in a process required to be<br>
heated. The metal layer, which is provided on the hard<br>
layer with the soft layer interposed between the metal<br>
layer and the hard layer, is protected by excellent<br>
hardness of the hard layer. For this reason, even though<br>
the metal layer provided on the hard layer via a soft<br>
layer is heated and pressed, breakage such as a cracking,<br>
fracture, or the like does not occur. Further, when the<br>
shielding film is adhered on the foundation including the<br>
printed circuit, it is possible to prevent the hard layer<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
from cracking because of the cushioning effect of the soft<br>
layer.<br>
Further, in the shielding film of the invention, at<br>
least one layer of the hard layer and the soft layer may<br>
be composed of a coating layer. As a result, it is<br>
possible to make the shielding film thin, and to provide a<br>
shielding film having excellent flexibility.<br>
A shielded printed circuit board according to<br>
another aspect of the invention includes: a metal layer,<br>
which is provided on at least one surface of a foundation<br>
including at least one printed circuit via a adhesive<br>
layer; and a cover film, which is provided on the surface<br>
of the metal layer opposite to the adhesive layer. In<br>
this case, the cover film includes at least one hard layer<br>
and at least one soft layer, and the outermost surface of<br>
the cover film is composed of a hard layer.<br>
According to the shielded printed circuit board of<br>
the invention, since the outermost surface of the cover<br>
film is composed of the hard layer having excellent<br>
abrasion resistance and blocking resistance, it is<br>
possible to prevent abrasion of the cover film. In<br>
addition, since the hard layer has excellent blocking<br>
resistance, the hard layer is not attached to a conveyor<br>
jig, conveyor belt, or the like on which the circuit board<br>
is loaded to be conveyed, in a process requiring heat,<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
such as a reflow process in the process of mounting<br>
circuit components.<br>
In the above-mentioned shielded flexible printed<br>
circuit board, it is preferable that the foundation<br>
including the printed circuit be composed of a flexible<br>
printed circuit board in the above-mentioned shielded<br>
printed circuit board.<br>
According to the shielded flexible printed circuit<br>
board of the invention, the shielded flexible printed<br>
circuit board can have excellent sliding resistance, which<br>
is a characteristic required for the flexible printed<br>
circuit board.<br>
In the shielded flexible printed circuit board of<br>
the invention, it is preferable that the foundation<br>
including the printed circuit be composed of a TAB tape<br>
for a tape carrier package. As a result, since the<br>
shielding film has excellent flexibility, the rebound<br>
resilience of the shielding film deteriorates, such that<br>
it is possible to improve the efficiency in assembling.<br>
In the shielding film of the invention, the adhesive<br>
layer, which is formed on the surface of the cover film<br>
opposite to the separation film via a metal layer, may be<br>
composed of a conductive adhesive. As a result, the metal<br>
layer and the grounding circuit of the printed circuit<br>
board can be electrically connected to each other.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
Moreover, in the shielding film of the invention,<br>
the above-mentioned conductive adhesive may be an<br>
anisotropic conductive adhesive. As a result, it is<br>
possible to make the conductive adhesive thinner than the<br>
above-mentioned conductive adhesive, and to reduce the<br>
amount of conductive filler. Accordingly, it is possible<br>
to form a shielding film having excellent flexibility.<br>
In a method of manufacturing a shielding film of the<br>
invention, the cover film is formed by stratifying a hard<br>
layer and a soft layer on one surface of the separation<br>
film. The shielding film includes: a separation film; a<br>
cover film provided on one surface of the separation film;<br>
and an adhesive layer that is formed on the surface of the<br>
cover film opposite to the separation film via the metal<br>
layer.<br>
According to the method of manufacturing a shielding<br>
film of the invention, since the hard layer and the soft<br>
layer are stratified, it is possible to manufacture the<br>
shielding film, which has excellent abrasion resistance<br>
and blocking resistance. Furthermore, even though the<br>
shielding film is heated and pressed, breakage such as a<br>
cracking, fracture, or the like does not occur in the<br>
shielding film.<br>
Further, in the method of manufacturing a shielding<br>
film of the invention, at least one layer of the hard<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
layer and the soft layer may be composed of a coating<br>
layer. As a result, it is possible to make the cover film<br>
thin, and to manufacture shielding film having excellent<br>
flexibility.<br>
Furthermore, in the method of manufacturing a<br>
shielding film of the invention, the hard layer and the<br>
soft layer may be sequentially coated on one surface of<br>
the separation film. According to this structure, since<br>
the separation film can be used as a carrier film during<br>
the coating, it is possible to easily make the hard layer<br>
and the soft layer thin. In addition, it is possible to<br>
provide the shielding film, which has a thinner cover film,<br>
having excellent flexibility, and to reliably provide the<br>
shielding film at low cost.<br>
It is preferable that a method of manufacturing the<br>
shielded printed circuit board of the invention, include:<br>
placing the above-mentioned shielding film on at least one<br>
surface of a foundation including at least one printed<br>
circuit; heating and pressing the shielding film; and<br>
releasing the separation film.<br>
According to the method of manufacturing the<br>
shielded printed circuit board of the invention, it is<br>
possible to easily manufacture the shielded printed<br>
circuit board having a cover film, which does not have<br>
breakage of a metal layer,  having excellent abrasion<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
resistance and blocking resistance, and not cracking.<br>
Furthermore, a method of manufacturing a shielded<br>
printed circuit board according to another aspect of the<br>
invention includes: removing a portion of an insulating<br>
material covering a grounding circuit from a printed<br>
circuit, which includes a signal circuit and a grounding<br>
circuit formed on a base film, in order to prepare a<br>
foundation having the exposed grounding circuit; placing<br>
the above-mentioned shielding film in which the above-<br>
mentioned adhesive layer is a conductive adhesive layer or<br>
an anisotropic conductive adhesive layer on the<br>
foundation; and heating and pressing the shielding film so<br>
that the shielding film are adhered to each other and the<br>
grounding circuit is electrically connected to the metal<br>
layer.<br>
According to the above-mentioned method of<br>
manufacturing a shielded printed circuit board, since the<br>
cover film is composed of the hard layer and the soft<br>
layer, the conductive adhesive or the anisotropic<br>
conductive adhesive softened due to heating is easily<br>
embedded into the insulation removed portions. Further,<br>
it is possible to ground the metal layer or the shielding<br>
layer, which is composed of the metal layer and the<br>
adhesive layer, via a grounding circuit. In addition,<br>
when the adhesive layer is non-conductive, the metal layer<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
may be connected to a case or the like by another method.<br>
Moreover, in the above-mentioned method of<br>
manufacturing a shielded printed circuit board of the<br>
invention, the foundation including at least one printed<br>
circuit may be composed of a flexible printed circuit<br>
board. As a result, it is possible to obtain a flexible<br>
printed circuit board having excellent flexibility and<br>
sliding resistance.<br>
Furthermore, in the above-mentioned method of<br>
manufacturing a shielded printed circuit board, the<br>
foundation including at least one printed circuit may be<br>
composed of a TAB tape for a tape carrier package. As a<br>
result, it is possible to obtain a flexible TAB tape for a<br>
tape carrier package, which has excellent efficiency in<br>
assembling.<br>

to a so-called non-adhesive type copper-clad laminated<br>
plate. In addition, the insulating film 4 may be formed<br>
by adhering flexible insulating films to each other by an<br>
adhesive, and may be formed by serial methods of coating,<br>
drying, exposing developing, and heat-treating a<br>
photosensitive insulating resin.<br>
In addition, single-sided FPC having a printed<br>
circuit on only one side of a base film, a double-sided<br>
FPC having a printed circuit on both sides of a base film,<br>
a multilayered FPC in which several FPCs are laminated, a<br>
flexboard (registered trade mark) having a multilayered<br>
part mounting portion and a cable portion, a flexible<br>
rigid board having a multilayered portion made of a hard<br>
material, a TAB tape for a tape carrier package, and the<br>
like can be properly used as the foundation film 5.<br>
Here, a film shown in Fig. 2 (a) is used as the<br>
shielding film 1. As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the shielding<br>
film 1 includes a separation film 6a, a mold-releasing<br>
layer 6b formed on one side of the separation film 6a, and<br>
a shielding film body 9. The shielding film body 9<br>
includes a cover film 7 and an adhesive layer 8a. The<br>
cover film 7 is formed by sequentially coating a hard<br>
layer 7a, which is made of a resin having excellent<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
abrasion resistance and blocking resistance, and a soft<br>
layer 7b, which is made of a resin having excellent<br>
cushioning characteristics, on the mold-releasing layer 6b.<br>
The adhesive layer 8a is formed on the surface of the<br>
cover film 7 opposite to a mold-releasing layer 6b via a<br>
metal layer Sb. Here, a shielding layer 8 is composed of<br>
the adhesive layer 8a made of a conductive adhesive, and<br>
the metal layer 8b. In the shielding layer 8, an adhesive<br>
8a1 softened due to heating h flows in a direction<br>
indicated by arrows to insulation removed portions 4a (see<br>
Fig. 1 (a) ) . Furthermore, if the mold-releasing layer 6b<br>
formed on the separation film 6a has release<br>
characteristic with respect to the cover film 7, the mold-<br>
releasing layer 6b is not limited to a specific one. For<br>
example, it is possible to use a PET film coated by<br>
silicon as the mold-releasing layer. Moreover, coating is<br>
preferably used as a method of forming the hard layer 7a<br>
and the soft layer 7b on one side of the separation film<br>
6a. However, lamination, extrusion, dipping, or the like<br>
in addition to coating may be employed as the method of<br>
forming the hard layer and the soft layer.<br>
In this way, the adhesive 8a' is sufficiently<br>
applied to the non-insulated portions 3c of the grounding<br>
circuit 3b, and the insulating film 4. After that, as<br>
shown in Fig. 1(b), a shielded-flexible printed circuit<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
board 10 formed as mentioned above is separated from the<br>
press P, and the separation film 6a of the shielding film<br>
1 is released together with the mold-releasing layer 6b,<br>
thereby obtaining a shielded FPC 10' shown in Fig. l(c).<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 (a), the shielding film 1 has a<br>
larger thickness than that of the shielding film body 9 as<br>
much as the thickness of the separation film 6a.<br>
Accordingly, the shielding film is easily blanked with a<br>
predetermined size, can be cleanly cut, and is easily<br>
positioned on the foundation film 5. In addition,<br>
cushioning effect caused by the separation film 6 is<br>
increased during the heating and pressing, and thus,<br>
pressure is slowly applied. As a result, since the<br>
adhesive 8a' easily flows into the insulation removed<br>
portions 4a and the adhesive 8a1 is sufficiently applied<br>
to the non-insulated portions 3c of the grounding circuit<br>
3b, connecting conductivity is improved. Furthermore,<br>
when the separation film 6a is released together with the<br>
mold-releasing layer 6b, a thin and flexible shielded FPC<br>
10 is easily obtained. Further, the shielding film 1 may<br>
be used in a rigid circuit board.<br>
All of the base film 2 and the insulating film 4 are<br>
made of engineering plastic. For example, a resin such as<br>
polypropylene, cross-linked polyethylene, polyester,<br>
polybenzimidazole,       polyimide,      polyimidoamide,<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
polyetherimide, polyphenylenesulfide (PPS), or the like is<br>
used as the engineering plastic. When thermal resistance<br>
is not particularly required, an inexpensive polyester<br>
film is preferably used. When fire retardancy is required,<br>
a polyphenylenesulfide film is preferably used. Further,<br>
when the thermal resistance is required, a polyirtide film<br>
is preferably used.<br>
The hard layer 7a comprising the cover film 7 is<br>
made of a resin having abrasion resistance. Abrasion does<br>
not occur on the resin composing the hard layer under the<br>
following conditions of a rubbing test, which is performed<br>
by a (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science type)<br>
rubbing tester defined in JIS L 0849. For the conditions,<br>
a rubbing element has a mass of 500 g, and a specimen<br>
table is horizontally reciprocated in a distance of 120 mm<br>
at a speed of 30 reciprocations per minute and is<br>
reciprocated 1000 times. The soft layer 7b is made of a<br>
resin having an elastic modulus of 3 Gpa (giga pascal) or<br>
less. The elastic modulus is measured under the following<br>
conditions by a method of testing dynamic mechanical<br>
properties, which is defined in JIS K 7244-4. For the<br>
conditions, a frequency is 1 Hz, a measurement temperature<br>
is in the range of -50 to 150 °C, and a temperature rise<br>
rate is 5 °C/min. Since the separation film 6a needs to<br>
be released from the  cover  film 7  during the post<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
processes, the hard layer 7a is coated on the mold-<br>
releasing layer 6b formed on one side of the separation<br>
film 6a. Further, after the separation film 6a is<br>
released, the hard layer 7a having excellent abrasion<br>
resistance serves as a protective layer and prevents the<br>
abrasion of the cover film 7. Furthermore, since the hard<br>
layer 7a has excellent blocking resistance, the hard layer<br>
is not attached to a conveyor jig, conveyor belt, or the<br>
like on which the circuit board is loaded to be conveyed,<br>
in a process requiring heat, such as a reflow process in<br>
the process of mounting circuit components. Since the<br>
cover film 7 serving as a base has excellent hardness of<br>
the hard layer 7a and cushioning characteristics of the<br>
soft layer 7b, breaking such as a crack, fracture, or the<br>
like does not occur even when the shielding film is heated<br>
and pressed. Moreover, when the shielding film 1 is<br>
placed on the foundation film 5 including the printed<br>
circuit 3 and is then pressed P by the press P (PA and PB)<br>
while heated h, the pressure is slowly applied to the hard<br>
layer 7a because of the cushioning effect of the soft<br>
layer 7b. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the hard<br>
layer  7a having high hardness from cracking. A<br>
thermosetting resin, a thermoplastic resin, an electron<br>
beam curable resin, or the like can be used as a resin for<br>
the hard layer or the soft layer.<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
The separation film 6a is also made of engineering<br>
plastic similar to the base film 2, the insulating film 4,<br>
and the cover film 7. However, since the separation film<br>
6a is removed in the processes of manufacturing the<br>
printed circuit board, it is preferable that the<br>
inexpensive polyester film be used as the separation film.<br>
As described above, since the mold-releasing layer 6b is<br>
formed on the surface of the separate film 6a so as to<br>
have release characteristic with respect to the hard layer<br>
7a. The mold-releasing layer 6b may be formed to cover<br>
the overall surface of the separate film 6a, or may be<br>
formed only on the surface, on which the hard layer 7a is<br>
coated, of the separate film. In addition, a silicon film<br>
formed by known method can be used as the mold-releasing<br>
layer 6b.<br>
The adhesive layer 8a is made of an adhesive resin,<br>
that is, a thermoplastic resin or a thermosetting resin.<br>
The thermoplastic resin includes polystyrenes, vinyl<br>
acetates, polyesters, polyethylenes, polypropylenes,<br>
polyamides, rubbers, acryls, and the like. The<br>
thermosetting resin includes phenols, epoxys, urethanes,<br>
melamines, alkyds, and the like. In addition, the<br>
adhesive layer can be also made of a conductive adhesive,<br>
which has conductivity by mixing a conductive filler such<br>
as a metal, carbon, or the like into the-adhesive resin.<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to form an anisotropic<br>
conductive layer by reducing the amount of the conductive<br>
filler. When thermal resistance is not particularly<br>
required, a polyester-based thermoplastic resin not having<br>
limitation in storage conditions is preferably used. When<br>
thermal resistance or better flexibility is required, an<br>
epoxy-based thermosetting resin having high reliability<br>
after the shielding layer 8 is formed is preferably used.<br>
Further, for all of them, it is preferable that the resin<br>
hardly flow out of the shielding film during the heating<br>
and pressing.<br>
Carbon, silver, copper, nickel, solder, a copper<br>
filler coated with silver that is formed by coating<br>
aluminum and copper powder with silver, a filler that is<br>
formed coating resinous balls or glass pieces with a metal,<br>
and the mixture thereof are used as the conductive filler.<br>
Silver is expensive, copper lacks reliability in thermal<br>
resistance, aluminum lacks reliability in humidity<br>
resistance, and solder does not have sufficient<br>
conductivity. Therefore, the relatively inexpensive<br>
copper filler coated with silver or nickel filler, which<br>
has conductivity and high reliability, may be preferably<br>
used as the conductive filler.<br>
The mixing ratio of the conductive filler such as<br>
the metal filler into the adhesive resin depends on the<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
shape of the filler. However, it is preferable that 10 to<br>
400 parts by weight of the copper filler coated with<br>
silver be contained relative to 100 parts by weight of the<br>
adhesive resin, and is more preferable that 20 to 150<br>
parts by weight of the copper filler coated with silver be<br>
contained relative thereto. When the copper filler coated<br>
with silver is more than 400 parts by weight, the adhesion<br>
of the copper filler coated with silver to the grounding<br>
circuit (copper foil) 3b deteriorates and thus the<br>
flexibility of the shielded FPC 10' deteriorates. In<br>
addition, when the copper filler coated with silver is<br>
less than 10 parts by weight, the conductivity thereof<br>
deteriorates. It is preferable that 40 to 400 parts by<br>
weight of the nickel filler be contained relative to 100<br>
parts by weight of the adhesive resin, and is more<br>
preferable that 100 to 350 parts by weight of the nickel<br>
filler be contained relative thereto. When the nickel<br>
filler is more than 400 parts by weight, the adhesion to<br>
the grounding circuit (copper foil) 3b of the nickel<br>
filler deteriorates and thus the flexibility of the<br>
shielded FPC 10' deteriorates. In addition, when the<br>
nickel filler is less than 40 parts by weight, the<br>
conductivity thereof deteriorates. The conductive filler<br>
such as a metal filler may be formed in the shape of a<br>
sphere, needle, fiber, flake, or resin.<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
If the conductive filler such as a metal filler is<br>
mixed into the adhesive resin as described above, the<br>
thickness of the adhesive layer 8a becomes as large as<br>
much as that of the filler and thus is about 20 ± 5 m.<br>
In addition, if the conductive filler is not mixed into<br>
the adhesive resin, the thickness of the adhesive layer is<br>
about 1 + 10 m. For this reason, since the shielding<br>
layer 8 can be made thin, it is possible to obtain a thin<br>
shielded FPC 10' .<br>
Aluminum, copper, silver, gold, or the like can be<br>
used as a metal material of the metal layer 8b. The metal<br>
material may be selected in consideration of the shielding<br>
characteristic thereof. However, taking into<br>
consideration, copper is likely to be oxidized when coming<br>
in contact with the atmosphere, and gold is expensive.<br>
Accordingly, inexpensive aluminum or silver having high<br>
reliability may be preferably used as the metal material.<br>
The thickness of the metal layer is properly set in<br>
consideration of the shielding characteristic and<br>
flexibility thereof. However, in general, the thickness<br>
of the metal layer is preferably set in the range of 0.01<br>
to 1.0 m. When the thickness of the metal layer is less<br>
than 0.01 m, the shielding effect thereof is not<br>
sufficient.  In contrast, when the thickness of the metal<br>
layer is more than  1.0 m,  the flexibility thereof<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
deteriorates.  Vacuum deposition, sputtering, a CVD method,<br>
MO (metal organic), plating, and the like can be used as a<br>
method of forming the metal layer 8b.   However, vacuum<br>
deposition is preferable considering mass productivity,<br>
and can allow a stable and thin metal film to be obtained<br>
at low cost.  Moreover, the metal layer is not limited to<br>
the thin metal film, and a metal foil may be used as the<br>
metal layer.<br>
A shielding film 1 shown in Fig. 2 (b) is different<br>
from the shielding film 1 shown in Fig. 2 (a) in that a<br>
shielding layer 8 is formed on one side of the cover film<br>
7. The shielding layer 8' is composed of only an adhesive<br>
layer 8a, and the adhesive layer 8a is made of a<br>
conductive adhesive into which the conductive filler is<br>
mixed. The metal layer 8b has higher conductivity than<br>
the adhesive layer 8a. Accordingly, when the metal layer<br>
8b is provided as shown in Fig. 2 (a), the conductive<br>
adhesive does not need to be used. As a result, it is<br>
possible to make the shielding layer 8 thin. In addition,<br>
the structure of the shielding layer 8 is not limited<br>
thereto, and it is preferable that shielding layer have<br>
high conductivity and flexibility.<br>
Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view showing the<br>
shielded FPC obtained as described above, and Fig. 3(a) is<br>
similar to Fig. l(c).  It is natural that the shielded FPC<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
of the invention includes a shielding film body 9' instead<br>
of the shielding film body 9 shown in Fig. 3 (a). In the<br>
shielding film body 9', the shielding layer 8' is composed<br>
of only an adhesive layer 8a made of a conductive adhesive<br>
as shown in Fig. 2 (b). In addition, various members<br>
constituting the shielding film body 9 and a method of<br>
forming the shielding film body also include various ones<br>
as described above.<br>
Furthermore, the FPC is not limited to the one-sided<br>
shielded FPC, and includes both-sided shielded FPC as<br>
shown in Figs. 3 (b) and 3 (a). In the both-sided shielded<br>
FPC 10A of Fig. 3 (b) ,- insulation removed portions 4a and<br>
2a' are formed in an insulating film 4 and a base film 2',<br>
respectively, in order to connect an adhesive layer 8a<br>
with a grounding circuit 3b. The insulating film 4 is<br>
disposed on the grounding circuit 3b, and the base film 2'<br>
is disposed beneath the grounding circuit. Non-insulated<br>
portions 3c, which are upper and lower surfaces of the<br>
grounding circuit 3b, are connected to adhesive layers 8a.<br>
Here, the base film 2', the printed circuit 3 (a signal<br>
circuit 3a and a grounding circuit 3b), and the insulating<br>
film 4 constitute a foundation film 5'.<br>
In the both-sided shielded FPC 10B of Fig. 3(c),<br>
insulation removed portions 4a and 2a' are formed in an<br>
insulating film 4 and a base film 2'  respectively.<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
Similar to the both-sided shielded FPC of Fig. 3 (b) , the<br>
insulating film 4 is disposed on the grounding circuit 3b,<br>
and the base film 2' is disposed beneath the grounding<br>
circuit. However, through holes 3d1 are further provided<br>
in the grounding circuit 3b to form a grounding circuit<br>
3b'. Accordingly, the adhesive layers 8a permeate into<br>
the through holes 3d' from the both sides, and are joined<br>
to each other at interfaces S. The upper surface of the<br>
non-insulated portion 3c and the inner surface 3c' of the<br>
through holes are connected to the adhesive layer 8a.<br>
Here, the base film 2', the printed circuit 3' (a signal<br>
circuit 3a' and a grounding circuit 3b'), and the<br>
insulating film 4 constitute a foundation film 5".<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4, in the shielded FPC<br>
according to the invention, one surface of the foundation<br>
film 5 is covered with the shielding film body 9, and a<br>
rectangular ground member 13 can also be provided at the<br>
end of the foundation film.<br>
The ground member 13 is a member in which an<br>
adhesive resin layer 12 is disposed on one surface of a<br>
rectangular metal foil 11 having a width W. As the width<br>
W of the ground member 13 is increased, the ground<br>
impedance of the ground member 13 is decreased, which is<br>
preferable. However, the width W of the ground member is<br>
set in consideration of handling and economical efficiency<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
thereof. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, a<br>
portion of the ground member corresponding to the width Wl<br>
of the width W is exposed, and a portion of the ground<br>
member corresponding to the width W2 is adhered to the<br>
adhesive layer 8a. If the exposed portion thereof<br>
corresponding to the width Wl is connected to the ground<br>
portion around it by using a proper conductive member, it<br>
is possible to reliably ground the ground member.<br>
Moreover, if the ground member is reliably grounded, the<br>
width W2 may be further reduced. In the present<br>
embodiment, the length of the ground member 13 is set<br>
equal to the width of the shielding film body 9 or the<br>
foundation film 5 in order to facilitate machining of the<br>
ground member. However, the length of the ground member<br>
may be set shorter or longer than the width of the<br>
shielding film body or the foundation film, and may be set<br>
to be connected to the portion of the ground member, which<br>
is connected to the conductive-adhesive layer 12, and the<br>
portion of the ground member, which is exposed and<br>
connected to the ground portion around it.<br>
Similarly, the shape of the ground member 13 is also<br>
not limited to the rectangular shape, and may be set so<br>
that one portion of the ground member is connected to the<br>
adhesive layer 8a and the other portion thereof is<br>
connected to the ground portion around it.-<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
In addition, a position of the ground member is not<br>
limited to the end portion of the shielded FPC 10', and<br>
the ground member may be positioned at the position 13a<br>
other than the end portion indicated by an imaginary line<br>
in Fig. 4 (a) . However, in this case, the ground member<br>
13a protrude and is exposed to the side portion from the<br>
shielding film body 9 so as to be connected to the ground<br>
portion around it. The lengths LI and L2 of the both<br>
portions of the ground member, which protrude from the<br>
both sides of the shielding film body, may be set to be<br>
grounded to the ground portion around it such as the case<br>
of the device, and only one side of the protruding<br>
portions may protrude from the shielding film body. The<br>
surface of the metal layer 8b comes in contact with the<br>
ground portion so as to connected to each other by screws<br>
or solder.<br>
Although a copper foil is preferably used as the<br>
metal foil 11 of the ground member 13 in consideration of<br>
conductivity, flexibility, economical efficiency, and the<br>
like, the metal foil is not limited thereto. In addition,<br>
although conductive resin can be used instead of the metal<br>
foil, it is preferable to use the metal foil in<br>
consideration of conductivity.<br>
Furthermore, the adhesive resin layer 12 is made of<br>
a thermoplastic resin or a thermosetting resin.   The<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
thermoplastic resin includes polystyrenes, vinyl acetates,<br>
polyesters, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polyamides,<br>
rubbers, acryls, and the like. The thermosetting resin<br>
includes phenols, epoxys, urethanes, melamines, polyimides,<br>
alkyds, and the like. It is preferable that the adhesive<br>
resin layer is made of a material having excellent<br>
adhesion with respect to the metal foil and the adhesive<br>
resin layer constituting the ground member 13, or the<br>
insulating film 4 of the foundation film 5. Moreover,<br>
when being positioned at the position other than the end<br>
portion to be covered with the shielding layer 8, the<br>
ground member 13 may be made of a metal foil or a metal<br>
wire.<br>
As described above, since the shielding layer 8 of<br>
the shielding film body 9 is grounded by the ground member<br>
13, it is not necessary to provide a wide ground wire as a<br>
part of the printed circuit. For this reason, it is<br>
possible to increase wiring density. In addition, the<br>
ground impedance of the ground member 13 is easily<br>
decreased to be smaller than that of the ground wire of<br>
the conventional shielded FPC. Therefore, the<br>
electromagnetic wave shielding effect of the shielding<br>
layer is also improved.<br>
Further, the invention naturally includes a<br>
conventional shielded FPC in which a wide ground wire is<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
provided to ground the shielding layer 8. In this case,<br>
since the board ground effect caused by the wide ground<br>
wire and the frame ground effect caused by the ground<br>
member are added to each other, the electromagnetic wave<br>
shielding effect is further improved and stabilized.<br>
The end portion of the foundation film 5<br>
corresponding to the width tl is exposed, and the printed<br>
circuit 3 is exposed. In addition, in the present<br>
embodiment, the ground member 13 is adhered to the<br>
insulating film 4 such that one end of the ground member<br>
in the width direction thereof is kept separate from the<br>
end of insulating film by a width t2. Accordingly,<br>
insulating resistance between signal lines 4 is ensured by<br>
the width t2.<br>
Moreover, the ground member can have various<br>
structures other than the structure shown in Fig. 4. For<br>
example, the ground member may have the following<br>
structure. In the structure, the ground member is a metal<br>
foil made of copper, silver, aluminum, or the like.<br>
Further, a plurality of conductive bumps protruding from<br>
one surface of the metal foil is connected to the<br>
shielding layer through the cover film, and the exposed<br>
metal foil is connected to the ground portion around it.<br>
In  addition,  the  ground  member  may  have  the<br>
following structure.   In another structure, the ground<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
member is a metal plate, which is made of copper, silver,<br>
aluminum, or the like, and has a plurality of protrusions<br>
on one surface thereof. The protrusions are connected to<br>
the shielding layer through the cover film, and the<br>
exposed metal plate is connected to the ground portion<br>
around it.<br>
Furthermore, the following ground member may have<br>
another structure. In another structure, the  ground<br>
member is a metal foil made of copper, silver, aluminum,<br>
or the like. Further, a plurality of metal fillers<br>
protruding from one surface of the metal foil is connected<br>
to the adhesive layer and metal layer of the shielding<br>
layer through the cover film, and the exposed metal foil<br>
is connected to the ground portion around it.<br>
In addition, the following structure may be employed.<br>
In the structure, the cover film is removed by excimer<br>
laser to form a window at a predetermined position on the<br>
shielding film, and one end of the ground member<br>
(conductor) is connected to the window through the<br>
conductive adhesive into which a conductive filler is<br>
mixed. The other end of the ground member is connected to<br>
the ground portion around it. Alternatively, the ground<br>
portion around it may be directly connected to the window<br>
without using the ground member.<br>

Next, the results of the evaluation tests, which are<br>
performed with the examples of the invention, and<br>
comparative examples will be described.<br>
(1)  Rubbing test<br>
Specimens: Each of the shielding films, which have<br>
cover films 7 according to first to third examples and<br>
first to third comparative examples shown in Table 1, is<br>
adhered to a CCL 20 as shown in Fig. 7 (a) , and the<br>
shielding film and the CCL are then heated and pressed to<br>
prepare each sheet having a width of 50 mm and a length of<br>
140 mm. The sheets have been used as the specimens. Here,<br>
the CCL 20 is obtained by adhering a polyimide film 23 to<br>
a copper foil 21 by an adhesive 22. The thickness of each<br>

FPCs 10' having a width of 12 mm and a length of 150 mm.<br>
•The shielded FPCs 10' have been used as the specimens. <br>

WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
between a stationary plate 56 and a sliding plate 57.<br>
Then, the sliding plate 57 slides in a vertical direction<br>

heated and pressed has been observed with the naked eye.<br>
[First example]<br>
The following shielding film is used as a first<br>
example. The shielding film includes a hard layer, a soft<br>
layer, and a shielding layer. The hard layer has a<br>
thickness of 2 μM and is formed by mixing 100 parts by<br>
weight of ultraviolet curing polyfunctional acrylate and<br>
50 parts by weight of ultraviolet curing bifunctional<br>
acrylate to each other.  The soft layer has a thickness of<br>
3 μm, and is made of a modified epoxy resin. Furthermore,<br>
the shielding layer is formed on the soft layer. Then,<br>
abrasion resistance, blocking resistance, and embedding<br>

this case, the thickness of an evaporated silver layer,<br>
which is the metal layer 8b of the shielding layer 8, has<br>
been set to 0.15 μm, the thickness of the adhesive layer<br>
8a having conductivity has been set to 20 μm, the<br>
thickness of the insulating layer has been set to 40 μm,<br>

been set to 1.4 mm (hereinafter, the structures of the<br>
shielding layer and the insulating film will be the same<br>
as those in the second and third examples, and the first<br>
to the fourth comparative examples). The results of the<br>
rubbing test,  the blocking resistance test,  and the<br>

layer,  and a shielding layer.   The hard layer has a<br>
thickness of 2 μm and is formed by mixing 100 parts by<br>
weight of ultraviolet curing polyfunctional acrylate and<br>
150 parts by weight of ultraviolet curing bifunctional<br>
acrylate to each other.  The soft layer has a thickness of<br>
3 μm, and is made of a modified epoxy resin. Furthermore,<br>
the shielding layer is formed on the soft layer. Then,<br>
abrasion resistance, blocking resistance, and embedding<br>
resistance has been evaluated for the second example. The<br>
results thereof are shown in Table 1. In addition, a<br>
flexible duration has been evaluated through the sliding<br>
resistance test.  The result thereof is shown in Fig. 9.<br>
[Third example]<br>
The following shielding film is used as a third<br>
example. The shielding film includes a hard layer, a soft<br>
layer, and a shielding layer. The hard layer has a<br>
thickness of 2 μm and is formed by mixing 100 parts by<br>
weight of ultraviolet curing polyfunctional acrylate and<br>
250 parts by weight of ultraviolet curing bifunctional<br>
acrylate to each other. The soft layer has a thickness of<br>
3 μm, • and is made of a modified epoxy resin.  Furthermore,<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
the shielding layer is formed on the soft layer. Then,<br>
abrasion resistance, blocking resistance, and embedding<br>
resistance has been evaluated for the third example. The<br>
results thereof are shown in Table 1.<br>
[First comparative example]<br>
The following shielding film is used as a first<br>
comparative example. The shielding film includes a hard<br>
layer and a shielding layer, and does not include a soft<br>
layer. The hard layer has a thickness of 2 μm and is made<br>
of ultraviolet curing bifunctional acrylate. Furthermore,<br>
the shielding layer is formed on one surface of the hard<br>
layer. Then, abrasion resistance, blocking resistance,<br>
and embedding resistance has been evaluated for the first<br>
comparative example. The results thereof are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
[Second comparative example]<br>
The following shielding film is used as a second<br>
comparative example. The shielding film includes a hard<br>
layer and a shielding layer, and does not include a soft<br>
layer. The hard layer has a thickness of 2 μm and is made<br>
of ultraviolet curing polyfunctional acrylate.<br>
Furthermore, the shielding layer is formed on one surface<br>
of the hard layer. Then, abrasion resistance, blocking<br>
resistance, and embedding resistance has been evaluated<br>
for the second comparative example.  The -results thereof<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br>
[Third comparative example]<br>
The following shielding film is used as a third<br>
comparative example. The shielding film includes a soft<br>
layer and a shielding layer, and does not include a hard<br>
layer. The soft layer has a thickness of 3 μm and is made<br>
of a modified epoxy resin. Furthermore, the shielding<br>
layer is formed on one surface of the soft layer. Then,<br>
abrasion resistance, blocking resistance, and an embedding<br>
resistance have been evaluated for the third comparative<br>
example.  The results thereof are shown in Table 1.<br>
[Fourth comparative example]<br>
The following shielding film is used as a fourth<br>
comparative example. The shielding film includes a cover<br>
film and a shielding layer. The cover film has a<br>
thickness of 9 μm and is made of PPS. Furthermore, the<br>
shielding layer is formed on one surface of the cover film.<br>
Then, abrasion resistance, blocking resistance, and<br>
embedding resistance has been evaluated for the fourth<br>
comparative example. The results thereof are shown in<br>
Table 1. In addition, a flexible duration has been<br>
evaluated through the sliding resistance test. The result<br>
thereof is shown in Fig. 9.<br>
40<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br><br>
41<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
As clarified from the results of the rubbing test,<br>
the blocking resistance test, and the embedding resistance<br>
test as shown in Table 1, all of the first to the third<br>
examples have excellent abrasion resistance, blocking<br>
resistance, and embedding resistance. However, there has<br>
been no comparative example that satisfies all of the<br>
excellent abrasion resistance, blocking resistance, and<br>
embedding resistance. That is, although each of the first<br>
and the third comparative examples has a relatively small<br>
thickness, the first and the third comparative examples<br>
have poor abrasion resistance, blocking resistance, and<br>
embedding resistance. The second comparative example has<br>
s small thickness, excellent abrasion resistance, and<br>
excellent blocking resistance. However, the second<br>
comparative example has poor embedding resistance. In<br>
addition, although the fourth comparative example has<br>
excellent blocking resistance and excellent embedding<br>
resistance, there is a problem in that the fourth<br>
comparative example has a large thickness and poor<br>
abrasion resistance.<br>
Furthermore, the following fact has been understood<br>
through the elastic modulus test. The elastic modulus of<br>
a sheet, which is composed of each soft layer 7b made of<br>
modified epoxy according to the first to the third<br>
examples and the third comparative example, is 0.1 Gpa,<br>
42<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
and the elastic modulus of a sheet, which is composed of<br>
the soft layer 7b made of PPS according to the fourth<br>
comparative example, is 6 Gpa. As a result, it has been<br>
understood that the soft layer 7b made of modified epoxy<br>
is very flexible, and has excellent cushioning effect.<br>
In addition, as clarified from the result of the<br>
sliding resistance test, it has been understood that the<br>
second example has longer flexible duration than the<br>
fourth comparative example, and is hardly broken.<br>
As disclosed above, the shielding film 1 according<br>
to the present embodiment includes the separation film 6a,<br>
the cover film 7 provided on one surface of the separation<br>
film 6a, and the adhesive layer 8a, which is formed on the<br>
surface of the cover film 7 opposite to the separation<br>
film 6a via the metal layer 8b. In this case, the cover<br>
film 7 includes at least one hard layer 7a and at least<br>
one soft layer 7b. Further, the surface of the cover film<br>
7 facing the separation film 6a is composed of the hard<br>
layer 7a. As a result, the surface facing the separation<br>
film 6a is composed of the hard layer 7a, and the hard<br>
layer 7a having excellent abrasion resistance serves as a<br>
protective layer after the release of the separation film<br>
6a. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the abrasion<br>
of the cover film 7. Furthermore, since the hard layer 7a<br>
has excellent blocking resistance, the hard layer is not<br>
43<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
attached to a conveyor jig, conveyor belt, or the like on<br>
which the circuit board is loaded to be conveyed, in a<br>
process requiring heat, such as a reflow process in the<br>
process of mounting circuit components. In addition, the<br>
hard layer 7a has excellent hardness. For this reason,<br>
even though the metal layer 8b provided on the hard layer<br>
7a via the soft layer 7b is heated and pressed, breakage<br>
such as a cracking, fracture, or the like does not occur.<br>
Further, when the shielding film 1 is adhered to the<br>
foundation 5 including the printed circuit 3, it is<br>
possible to prevent the hard layer 7a from cracking<br>
because of the cushioning effect of the soft layer 7b.<br>
Moreover, in the shielding film 1 according to the<br>
present embodiment, at least one layer of the above-<br>
mentioned hard layer 7a and the soft layer 7b is composed<br>
of a coating layer. As a result, it is possible to reduce<br>
the thickness of the shielding film 1.<br>
Further, the shielded printed circuit board<br>
according to the present embodiment includes the metal<br>
layer 8b, which is provided on at least one surface of the<br>
foundation 5 including at least one printed circuit 3 via<br>
the adhesive layer 8a, and the cover film 7, which is<br>
provided on the surface of the metal layer 8b opposite to<br>
the adhesive layer 8a. In this case, the cover film 7<br>
includes at least one hard layer 7a and at least one soft<br>
44<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
layer 7b. Further, the outermost surface of the cover<br>
film 7 is composed of the hard layer 7a. As a result, the<br>
outermost surface layer of the cover film 7 is composed of<br>
the hard layer 7a having excellent abrasion resistance and<br>
blocking resistance. Accordingly, it is possible to<br>
prevent the abrasion of the cover film 7. Furthermore,<br>
since the hard layer 7a has excellent blocking resistance,<br>
the hard layer is not attached to a conveyor jig, conveyor<br>
belt, or the like on which the circuit board is loaded to<br>
be conveyed, in a process requiring heat, such as a reflow<br>
process in the process of mounting circuit components.<br>
Moreover, in the shielded flexible printed circuit<br>
board (shield FPC 10') according to the present embodiment,<br>
the foundation 5 including the printed circuit  3 is<br>
composed of a flexible printed circuit board.  As a result,<br>
the shielded flexible printed circuit board can have<br>
excellent sliding resistance, which is a characteristic<br>
required for the flexible printed circuit board.<br>
Further, in the shielded flexible printed circuit<br>
board (shield FPC 10') according to the present embodiment,<br>
when the foundation 5 including the printed circuit 3 is<br>
composed of a TAB tape for a tape carrier package, the<br>
shielding film 1 has excellent flexibility. As a result,<br>
since the rebound resilience of the shielding film<br>
deteriorates,  it is possible to improve the assembly<br>
45<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
efficiency.<br>
In the shielding film 1 according to the present<br>
embodiment, the adhesive layer 8a, which is formed on the<br>
surface of the cover film 7 opposite to the separation<br>
film 6a via the metal layer 8b, is composed of a<br>
conductive adhesive. Accordingly, the metal layer 8b and<br>
the grounding circuit 3b of the printed circuit board can<br>
be electrically connected to each other.<br>
In the shielding film 1 according to the present<br>
embodiment, the above-mentioned conductive adhesive is<br>
composed of an anisotropic conductive adhesive. If the<br>
anisotropic conductive adhesive is used, it is possible to<br>
reduce the thickness of the shielding film and thereof<br>
used to form the shielding film as compared to when the<br>
conductive adhesive is used. Therefore, since an amount<br>
of the conductive fillers is little, it is possible to<br>
improve flexibility of the shielding film.<br>
Furthermore, in a method of manufacturing the<br>
shielding film according to the present embodiment, the<br>
cover film 7 is formed by laminating a hard layer 7a and a<br>
soft layer 7b on one surface of the separation film 6a.<br>
The shielding film according to the invention includes the<br>
separation film 6a, the cover film 7 provided on one<br>
surface of the separation film 6a, and the adhesive layer<br>
8a, which is formed on the surface of the cover film 7<br>
46<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
opposite to the separation film 6a via the metal layer 8b.<br>
As a result, it is possible to manufacture the shielding<br>
film 1, which has excellent abrasion resistance and<br>
blocking resistance. Furthermore, even though the<br>
shielding film is heated and pressed, breakage such as<br>
cracking, fracture, or the like does not occur in the<br>
shielding film 1.<br>
Moreover, in the method of manufacturing the<br>
shielding film according to the present embodiment, at<br>
least one layer of the above-mentioned hard layer 7a and<br>
the soft layer 7b is composed of a coating layer.<br>
According to this structure, since it is possible to<br>
reduce the thickness of the cover film 7, it is possible<br>
to manufacture the shielding film 1 having excellent<br>
flexibility.<br>
In the method of manufacturing the shielding film<br>
according to the present embodiment, the above-mentioned<br>
hard layer 7a and the soft layer 7b are sequentially<br>
coated on one surface of the separation film 6a.<br>
According to this structure, since the separation film 6a<br>
can be used as a carrier film, it is possible to also<br>
reduce the thickness of the hard layer 7a and the soft<br>
layer 7b. In addition, it is possible to provide the<br>
shielding film 1, which has a thinner cover film 7, having<br>
excellent  flexibility,  and  to  reliably  provide  the<br>
47<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
shielding film at low cost.<br>
Further, as for a method of manufacturing the<br>
shielded printed circuit board according to the present<br>
embodiment, in the above-mentioned shielded printed<br>
circuit board, the above-mentioned shielding film 1 is<br>
placed on at least one surface of the foundation 5<br>
including at least one printed circuit 3, and is heated<br>
and pressed. After that, the separation film 6a is<br>
released. According to this method, it is possible to<br>
very easily manufacture the following shielded printed<br>
circuit board in which breakage does not occur in the<br>
metal layer 8b and a cover film 7. The cover film 7 has<br>
excellent abrasion resistance and blocking resistance, and<br>
does not crack.<br>
Furthermore, in a method of manufacturing the<br>
shielded printed circuit board according to the present<br>
embodiment, a portion of an insulating material covering<br>
the grounding circuit 3b is removed from the printed<br>
circuit 3, which includes the signal circuit 3a and the<br>
grounding circuit 3b formed on the base film 2, in order<br>
to prepare the foundation 5 having the exposed grounding<br>
circuit 3b. Then, the shielding film 1 having the above-<br>
mentioned adhesive layer, which is composed of the<br>
conductive adhesive or the anisotropic conductive adhesive,<br>
is placed on the foundation 5, and the shielding film and<br>
48<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
the foundation are heated and pressed so that the<br>
shielding film and the foundation are adhered to each<br>
other and the grounding circuit 3b is electrically<br>
connected with the metal layer 8b. According to this<br>
method, since the conductive adhesive or the anisotropic<br>
conductive adhesive softened due to heating is easily<br>
embedded into the insulation removed portions 4a, it is<br>
possible to ground the metal layer 8a or the shielding<br>
layer 8, which is composed of the metal layer 8b and the<br>
adhesive layer 8a through the ground circuit 3b. In<br>
addition, when the adhesive layer 8a is non-conductive,<br>
the metal layer 8b may be connected to a case or the like<br>
by another method.<br>
Moreover, in the method of manufacturing the<br>
shielded printed circuit board according to the present<br>
embodiment, the foundation 5 including at least one<br>
printed circuit 3 is composed of a flexible printed<br>
circuit board. According to this method, it is possible<br>
to obtain the flexible printed circuit board having<br>
excellent flexibility and sliding resistance.<br>
In addition, in the method of manufacturing the<br>
shielded printed circuit board according to the present<br>
embodiment, the foundation 5 including at least one<br>
printed circuit 3 is composed of a TAB tape for a tape<br>
carrier package.  According to this method, it is possible<br>
49<br><br>
WO 2006/121194	PCT/JP2006/309870<br>
to obtain a TAB tape for a tape carrier package, which is<br>
soft and has excellent assembly efficiency.<br>
Although the invention has been described with<br>
reference to a preferred embodiment, the invention can be<br>
modified within the scope thereof. That is, the cover<br>
film may have a three-layer structure in which another<br>
hard layer is coated on a soft layer coated on a hard<br>
layer. Even in this case, the metal layer provided on the<br>
cover film is hardly broken because of the hardness of the<br>
hard layer, and it is possible to prevent the hard layer<br>
from cracking because of the cushioning characteristics of<br>
the soft layer.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The invention can be applied to shield a printed<br>
circuit board, which is used in a device such as a<br>
computer, communication device, printer, mobile phone,<br>
video camera, or the like, from electromagnetic wave.<br>
