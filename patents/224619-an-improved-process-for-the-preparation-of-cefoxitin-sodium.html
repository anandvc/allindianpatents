FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of Cephalosporin derivative. Specifically the Cephalosporin derivative is Cefoxitin sodium of Formula I<br><br>
and its intermediates with high purity starting from cephalothin derivatives of the Formula II.<br>
 represents hydrogen or alkali metals such as sodium and potassium<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cefoxitin sodium of Formula I, is a well known antibacterial agent useful in the treatment of anaerobic and mixed bacterial infections. It possesses high resistance to  P-lactamase inactivation and is chemically known as sodium (6R,7S)-3-[(Carbamoyloxy)methyl]-7-methoxy-8-oxo-7-[[(thiophen-2-yl)acetyI]amino]-5-thia-1 -azabicyclo-[4,2,0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate<br><br><br>
Several processes for the preparation of Cefoxitin sodium and key intermediates have been disclosed by Merck in different US patents 3,780,031, 3,780,033, 3,780,037, 3,775,410, 4,297,888 which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
US patent 4,297,888 is the basic product patent. This patent also describes different routes to prepare Cefoxitin sodium and intermediates starting from 7-aminocephalosporanic acid of Formula III.<br><br>
The major drawback to the processes disclosed in '888 is that all the processes consist of multi steps, and having low yields. Further, the chromatographic techniques are used to obtain the intermediates of desired quality. As chromatographic techniques are tedious, cumbersome and time consuming; therefore, various routes taught by the '888 patent are not viable on industrial scale.<br>
British Patent GB 1,350,772 teaches a process for the preparation of Cefoxitin acid and other intermediates. The Cefoxitin acid is prepared by the carbamoylation of potassium 3-hydroxymethyl-7-methoxy-7-(2-thienyl-acetamido)-3-cephem-4-carboxylate compound of Formula IV<br><br><br>
This hydroxyniethyl compound of Formula IV has been prepared by the enzymatic reduction of potassium 7-methoxy-7-(2-thienylacetamido)-3-cephem-4-carboxylate compound of following Formula V. No yields are reported for this preparation.<br><br>
The compound of Formula V is prepared in seven steps starting from 7-aminocephalosporanic acid of Formula III in overall yield of 10-15% and purity of compounds is not reported.<br>
Most of known processes for the preparation of Cefoxitin are making use of chromatographic techniques to purify the product of desired quality and further yields are also very low. These processes are having multiple stages and operational complexities during commercial production and therefore not viable for commercial production.<br>
Hence, there is an urgent need to develop a cost-effective, efficient and commercially viable process to prepare Cefoxitin sodium, where the use of chromatographic techniques can be avoided.<br><br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an efficient and cost-effective industrially advantageous process to prepare highly pure Cefoxitin sodium in good yields without using chromatographic techniques.<br>
SUMMAR Y OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an industrially advantageous process for the preparation of Cefoxitin sodium starting from Cephalothin and its alkali metal salts, which comprises:<br>
a)	converting cephalothin sodium of formula II to the corresponding ester of formula VI using conventional methods,<br>
b)	methoxylating the compound of formula VI to compound of formula VII using lithium methoxide and t-butyl hypochlorite in organic solvents at a temperature of-100°C to -40°C,<br>
c)	converting the compound of formula Vn to the corresponding acid of formula Vni by deprotection of the ester group using conventional methods and treating the acid with suitable organic amine in a suitable organic solvent such as C1-C4 alcohols, ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons, hydrocarbons, ketones, esters and the like or the mixtures thereof at a temperature of below 40°C and isolating the compound of formula VIII as amine salt,<br>
d)	hydrolysing the compound of formula VIII with the base in alcoholic solvents and in their aqueous mixture thereof at a temperature of -60°C to -15°C, and treating the resulting compound with suitable amine and isolating compound of formula IX as amine salt,<br>
e)	carbamoylating the compound of formula IX as obtained above using halosulfonyl isocyanate in organic solvent at a temperature of -70°C to 0°C and isolating the Cefoxitin acid of formula X and<br><br>
f)   converting the Cefoxitin acid to the pharmaceutical acceptable salt by the conventional methods.<br>
The process is shown below:<br><br><br><br>
R represents hydrogen or alkali metals such as sodium and potassium.<br>
R   represents benzyl, nitrobenzyl, alkoxy benzyl, alkylbenzyl alkoxyl alkyl benzyl,<br>
benzhydryl<br>
X represents organic amine group.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The instant invention is directed to a new, efficient, cost-effective and industrially advantageous process for the preparation of highly pure Cefoxitin sodium of Formula I in good yields.<br>
The present invention is also directed to the new intermediate of Formula VIII<br><br><br>
The process of preparing the compound of Formula VIII involves three steps.  In first step, Cephalothin sodium of Formula II,<br><br>
is protected with suitable carboxylic acid protecting groups such as benzyl, nitrobenzyl, alkoxybenzyl, alkyl benzyl, alkoxy alkyl benzyl, benzhydryl and the like, and most preferably with p-nitrobenzyl, in the presence of an inert organic solvent. The organic solvent can be selected from ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide esters and the like or mixture thereof; preferably N,N-dimethylformamide is used. The most preferred technique to prepare carboxylic acid protected cephalothin is performed by treating the cephalothin sodium of Formula II, with 1-2.5 moles of /?-nitrobenzyl bromide in A'i/^-dimethylformamide at a temperature of 10-40°C and preferably at 20-25°C.<br>
In the second step, the resulting protected cephalothin compoimd is methoxylated. The methoxylation is achieved using lithium methoxide in the presence of t-butyl hypochlorite in any inert organic solvent. The organic solvent used can be selected from tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, acetone, toluene, ethyl acetate, N,Ndimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, ethers and the like or mixtures thereof and preferably N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane is used. The reaction is performed at a temperature of-100°C to -40°C and preferably at -95° to -80°C. After completion of methoxylation in the third step protecting group can be removed by the methods reported in the art. Specifically the p-nitrobenzyl group is removed by hydrogenolysis and more preferably using 5-10% palladium on carbon in methanol at a temperature of<br><br>
25-50°C. After removal of the protecting group, the methoxylated cephalothin is isolated as an amine salt of Formula VIII<br><br>
The amine salt is prepared by the reaction of the methoxylated cephalothin with<br>
organic amines in a suitable organic solvent at a temperature of below 40°C. The<br>
organic amines can be selected from cyclohexylamine, dicyclohexylamine,<br>
N-methylmorpholine, piperazine, morpholine, N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine,<br>
N,N'-diphenylethylenediamine,	N,N-di(4-methylbenzyl)ethylenediamine,<br>
N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N,N-diisopropylamine and the like. Preferably cyclohexylamine is used.<br>
The suitable organic solvent can be selected from C1-C4 alcohols e.g. methanol, ethanol; ethers e.g. diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran; halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, hydrocarbons e.g. toluene, benzene, cyclohexene, hexane, heptane; ketones e.g. acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone; esters e.g. ethyl acetate and the like or mixture thereof.<br>
The most preferred method to prepare amine salt of Formula VIII is to treat the methoxylated compound with cyclohexylamine in a mixture of dichloromethane and acetone at a temperature of 20-25 °C and the highly pure compound, monocyclohexylamine-3-acetyloxymethyl-7-methoxy-7-(2-thienyl-acetamido)-3-cephem-4-carboxylate is isolated. The present process has the advantage of providing pure compounds of Formula VIII without making use of column chromatography.<br><br>
The present invention is further directed to a new process of converting compound of Formula VIII to the compound of Formula IX<br><br>
This conversion is achieved by treating the compound of Formula Vin with a base such as alkali metal hydroxides, trialkylamines and pyridine in suitable solvent and compound of Formula DC is isolated as amine salt. The amines can be selected from cyclohexylamine, dicyclohexylamine, A'-methyl morpholine, piperazine, morpholine, N,N-dibenzyl-ethylenediamine,N,N-diphenylethylene-diamine, N,N-di(4-methylbenzyl)ethylenediamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N,N-diisopropylamine and the like.<br>
The bases used can be selected from potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, triethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine or the like and most preferably sodium hydroxide is used. The suitable solvent can be selected from alcohols like ethanol, methanol and the like; water or mixtures thereof and most preferably methanol and water are used.<br>
Specifically the hydrolysis of compound of Formula VIII is carried out using aqueous sodium hydroxide solution in the mixtures of methanol and water at a temperature of-60°C to -15°C and preferably at -45°C to -40°C.<br>
The present invention has the advantage that reduction of compound of Formula VIII is performed chemically, whereas in the prior art, this reduction is reported enzymatically only. Furthermore, yields are improved, isolation facilitated and lactone formation is avoided by the formation of amine salts of Formula IX.<br><br>
This pure amine salt of Formula IX leads to the preparation of Cefoxitin sodium in high purity and good yields without using any column chromatography.<br>
The present invention is further directed to a new process of preparing a compound of Formula I from the above amine salt of formula IX.<br><br>
The compound of formula DC is then carbamoylated with halosulphonyl isocyanate in suitable organic solvent at a temperature of -70°C to 0°C and preferably at -60°C to -45^C.<br>
For carbamoylation the solvent can be selected from organic solvent like acetonitrile, dichloromethane, acetone, tetrahydrofuran and the like or mixture thereof, preferably tetrahydrofuran is used. Halosulphonyl isocyanate is selected from chlorosulphonyl isocyanate or bromosulphonyl isocyanate. Preferably the reaction is carried out using chlorosulfonyl isocyanate, since it is easily available. It is desirable to use an excess of halosulfonyl isocyanate in order to obtain maximum yields of the desired product, Cefoxitin acid. Further, Cefoxitin acid is purified in alcohol preferably in ethanol to obtain pure Cefoxitin acid having purity &gt;99% by high performance liquid chromatography.<br>
Preferably, the Cefoxitin acid is converted to highly pure Cefoxitin sodium by treating the Cefoxitin acid with 2-ethylsodiumhexanoate or sodium acetate using conventional methods.<br>
The major advantages realized in the present process as compared to the prior art is the isolation of highly pure compound of Formula VIE and Formula IX without using any column chromatography leading to the preparation of highly pure<br><br>
Cefoxitin sodium in good yields and hence a commercially viable process to prepare Cefoxitin sodium is in place.<br>
