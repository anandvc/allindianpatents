				<td>METHOD FOR FUEL CELL START-UP WITH UNIFORM HYDROGEN FLOW<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a fuel cell system with<br>
substantially uniform hydrogen flow at start-up and a start-up method for the fuel<br>
cell system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Fuel cells have been proposed as a clean, efficient and<br>
environmentally responsible power source for electric vehicles and various other<br>
applications. In particular, fuel cells have been identified as a potential<br>
alternative for the traditional internal-combustion engine used in modern<br>
automobiles.<br>
[0003] A fuel cell typically includes three basic components: a cathode,<br>
an anode and an electrolyte membrane. The cathode and anode typically<br>
include a finely divided catalyst, generally platinum, supported on carbon<br>
particles and mixed with an ionomer. The electrolyte membrane is sandwiched<br>
between the cathode and the anode to form a membrane-electrolyte-assembly<br>
(MEA). The MEA is typically disposed between porous diffusion media (DM)<br>
which facilitate a delivery of gaseous reactants such as hydrogen and oxygen to<br>
the cathode and anode. Hydrogen at the anode is converted to positively-<br>
charged hydrogen ions. These ions travel through the electrolyte to the cathode,<br>
where they react with oxygen. The oxygen can be supplied from air, for<br>
example. The remaining electrons in the anode flow through an external circuit to<br>
the cathode, where they join the oxygen and the hydrogen protons to form water.<br>
[0004] Individual fuel cells can be stacked together in series to form a<br>
fuel cell stack. The fuel cell stack is capable of supplying a quantity of electricity<br>
sufficient to power a vehicle. During a typical start-up operation of the fuel cell<br>
stack, hydrogen enters and flows through the individual fuel cells from one end of<br>
the fuel cell stack to another. The ends of the fuel cell stack are often referred to<br>
as the wet and dry ends, with the hydrogen generally flowing from the wet end to<br><br>
the dry end. In this manner, hydrogen is distributed to the individual fuel cells in<br>
a sequential fashion, with delivery of the hydrogen to a portion of the fuel cells<br>
adjacent the wet end occurring first and delivery of the hydrogen to a portion of<br>
the fuel cells adjacent the dry end occurring last. Thus, the fuel cells at the dry<br>
end often receive hydrogen at a point in time after the fuel cells at the wet end<br>
receive hydrogen. In an alternate arrangement, hydrogen may also be fed from<br>
the dry end for regular operation and sometimes from both ends during startup.<br>
In all these cases there is a non-uniform distribution of hydrogen.<br>
[0005] It is also well known in the art that high cell voltage combined<br>
with a hydrogen-air front passing through the cell results in cell voltage<br>
degradation induced by carbon corrosion. When hydrogen is received by the<br>
anodes of the fuel cells, the hydrogen replaces the air in the anodes and creates<br>
the hydrogen-air front that travels along a length of the anodes. In order to<br>
mitigate carbon corrosion during startup, a resistive load is typically placed<br>
across the stack to suppress cell voltage, thus reducing carbon corrosion. The<br>
lower the resistance, the lower the voltage during the hydrogen-air front.<br>
[0006] Unfortunately, non-uniform distribution of hydrogen to the fuel<br>
cells during the start-up operation and the use of a resistive load can lead to a<br>
severe performance degradation of fuel cell stack. The presence of air on the<br>
cathodes coupled with the hydrogen-air front on the anodes can cause an<br>
undesirable electric potential to form. In particular, the non-uniform distribution of<br>
hydrogen on the anodes of the fuel cell stack can lead to a high potential<br>
phenomenon known as "cell reversal." Cell reversal occurs when a load is<br>
applied to the fuel cell stack and when at least one fuel cell in the fuel cell stack<br>
lacks hydrogen while other fuel cells in the fuel cell stack are supplied with<br>
hydrogen. Cell reversal causes an oxidation of fuel cell components and may<br>
result in a rapid voltage degradation of the fuel cell stack. In particular, a<br>
corrosion of the carbon substrate of the electrodes, wherein surface oxides, CO,<br>
and CO2 are formed, occurs. The voltage degradation significantly reduces the<br>
useful life of the fuel cell stack.<br><br>
[0007] A number of fuel cell systems and methods are known in the art<br>
for optimizing the distribution of hydrogen to the anodes of the fuel cell stack.<br>
For example, it is known in the art to purge the anodes of the fuel cell stack with<br>
hydrogen at system start-up so as to minimize a time that the hydrogen-air front<br>
exists in the flow channels of the anodes. It is also known to cause hydrogen to<br>
flow from both the first end and the second end of the fuel cell stack to optimize a<br>
distribution of hydrogen to the anode cells along a length of a fuel cell stack.<br>
Such a method has been found to result in the non-uniform distribution of<br>
hydrogen at the fuel cells disposed at the center of the fuel cell stack, however.<br>
[0008] Geschwindt, et ai, in U.S. Pub. Pat. App. No. 2005/0129999<br>
reports an inlet fuel distributor having a permeable baffle disposed between a<br>
fuel supply pipe and a fuel inlet manifold, causing hydrogen to be uniformly<br>
distributed along the length of the fuel inlet manifold. During start-up, hydrogen or<br>
inert gas within the inlet fuel distributor and the fuel inlet manifold may be vented<br>
through a valve in response to a controller to present a uniform hydrogen front to<br>
the inlets of the fuel flow fields.<br>
[0009] An independent supply of hydrogen to the anode cells has also<br>
been employed to minimize voltage degradation. For example, in U.S. Pub. Pat.<br>
App. No. 2005/0118487 to Whiton, et al., a fuel cell stack having an inlet fuel<br>
distributor including a plurality of conduits of substantially equal length and equal<br>
flow cross section is described. The fuel cell stack is reported to uniformly<br>
distribute fuel cell inlet fuel from a fuel supply pipe to a fuel inlet manifold. The<br>
conduits may be either channels formed within a plate or tubes and may have<br>
single exits or double exits into the fuel inlet manifold.<br>
[0010] There is a continuing need for a fuel cell system and method<br>
that optimizes a distribution of hydrogen during a start-up operation and militates<br>
against a voltage degradation of the fuel cell stack. Desirably, the fuel cell stack<br>
and method also minimizes hydrogen exhaust emissions during the start-up<br>
operation.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] In concordance with the instant disclosure, a fuel cell system<br>
and method that optimizes a distribution of hydrogen, militates against voltage<br>
degradation, and minimizes hydrogen exhaust emissions during a fuel cell stack<br>
start-up operation is surprisingly discovered.<br>
[0012] In one embodiment, a fuel cell system is provided including a<br>
fuel cell stack with a plurality of fuel cells. Each of the plurality of fuel cells has<br>
an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte membrane disposed therebetween.<br>
The fuel cell system includes an anode supply manifold in communication with<br>
the anodes of the plurality of fuel cells, the anode supply manifold adapted to<br>
deliver a anode supply stream to the plurality of fuel cells, and an anode exhaust<br>
manifold in communication with the anodes of the plurality of fuel cells, the anode<br>
exhaust manifold adapted to receive an anode exhaust stream from the plurality<br>
of fuel cells. The fuel cell system further includes a first valve in communication<br>
with the anode supply manifold and a second valve in communication with the<br>
anode exhaust manifold. In operation, the fuel cell system militates against a<br>
non-uniform distribution of the anode supply stream to the anodes of the plurality<br>
of fuel cells.<br>
[0013] A method for starting a fuel cell system is also provided. The<br>
method includes providing the first valve in an open position, the first valve in<br>
communication with the anode supply manifold; providing the second valve in a<br>
closed position, the second valve in communication with the anode exhaust<br>
manifold; supplying an anode supply stream to the anode supply manifold;<br>
exhausting a first quantity of air from the anode supply manifold through the first<br>
valve; closing the first valve; opening the second valve; and exhausting a second<br>
quantity of air from the anodes of the plurality of fuel cells and the anode exhaust<br>
manifold through the second valve. The anode supply stream is thereby supplied<br>
substantially uniformly to the plurality of fuel cells of the fuel cell stack.<br>
[0014] In a further embodiment, a fuel cell system is provided having a<br>
first fuel cell stack including a first plurality of fuel cells, a first anode supply<br>
manifold and a first anode exhaust manifold in communication with the first<br><br>
plurality of fuel cells, and a first valve in communication with the anode supply<br>
manifold. The fuel cell system also has a second fuel cell stack including a<br>
second plurality of fuel cells, a second anode supply manifold and a second<br>
anode exhaust manifold in communication with the second plurality of fuel cells,<br>
and a second valve in communication with the anode supply manifold. The fuel<br>
cell system further includes a third valve in communication with the first anode<br>
exhaust manifold and the second anode exhaust manifold, wherein the fuel cell<br>
system militates against a non-uniform distribution of the anode supply stream to<br>
the plurality of fuel cells of each fuel cell stack.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0023] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should also<br>
be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. In respect of the methods<br>
disclosed, the steps presented are exemplary in nature, and thus, are not<br>
necessary or critical.<br>
[0024] For simplicity, only a two-cell stack (i.e. one bipolar plate) is<br>
illustrated and described in FIG. 1, it being understood that a typical fuel cell<br>
stack will have many more such cells and bipolar plates.<br>
[0025] FIG. 1 depicts an illustrative two-cell, bipolar PEM fuel cell stack<br>
2 having a pair of MEAs 4, 6 separated from each other by an electrically<br>
conductive bipolar plate 8. The MEAs 4, 6 and bipolar plate 8 are stacked<br>
together between a pair of clamping plates 10,12, and a pair of unipolar end<br>
plates 14, 16. The clamping plates 10, 12 are electrically insulated from the end<br>
plates 14, 16 by a gasket or a dielectric coating (not shown). The unipolar end<br>
plates 14, 16, as well as both working faces of the bipolar plate 8, include a<br>
plurality of grooves or channels 18, 20, 22, 24 defining a flowfield for distributing<br>
fuel and oxidant gases (i.e., H2 &amp; 02/air) over the faces of the MEAs 4, 6.<br>
Nonconductive gaskets 26, 28, 30, 32 provide seals and an electrical insulation<br>
between the several components of the fuel cell stack. Gas-permeable diffusion<br>
media 34, 36, 38, 40, e.g. carbon or graphite diffusion papers, abut an anode<br>
face and a cathode face of the MEAs 4, 6. The end plates 14, 16 are disposed<br>
adjacent to the diffusion media 34, 40 respectively, while the bipolar plate 8 is<br>
disposed adjacent to the diffusion media 36 on the anode face of MEA 4. The<br>
bipolar plate 8 is further disposed adjacent to the diffusion media 38 on the<br>
cathode face of MEA 6.<br><br>
[0026] The illustrative two-cell, bipolar PEM fuel cell stack 2 further<br>
includes a cathode supply manifold 72 and a cathode exhaust manifold 74, a<br>
coolant supply manifold 75 and a coolant exhaust manifold 77, and an anode<br>
supply manifold 76 and an anode exhaust manifold 78. The supply manifolds 72,<br>
75, 76 and the exhaust manifolds 74, 77, 78 are formed, for example, by a<br>
cooperation of apertures formed in the bipolar plate 8 with apertures formed in<br>
the gaskets 26, 28, 30, 32 and apertures formed in the end plates 14, 16. A<br>
hydrogen gas is supplied as an anode supply stream to the anode supply<br>
manifold 76 via an anode inlet conduit 80. An oxidant gas is supplied as a<br>
cathode supply stream to the cathode supply manifold 72 of the fuel cell stack 2<br>
via a cathode inlet conduit 82. An anode outlet conduit 84 and a cathode outlet<br>
conduit 86 are also provided for the anode exhaust manifold 78 and the cathode<br>
exhaust manifold 74, respectively. A coolant inlet conduit 88 and a coolant outlet<br>
conduit 90 are provided for supplying liquid coolant to, and removing coolant<br>
from, respectively, the coolant inlet manifold 75 and the coolant outlet manifold<br>
77. It should be understood that the configurations of the various inlets 80, 82,<br>
88 and outlets 84, 86, 90 in FIGS. 1 to 4 are for the purpose of illustration, and<br>
other configurations may be chosen as desired.<br>
[0027] FIG. 2 shows a fuel cell system 200 according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. The fuel cell system 200 includes the fuel cell<br>
stack 2 having a plurality of fuel cells 202. Each of the plurality of fuel cells 202<br>
have an anode (not shown) and a cathode (not shown) with an electrolyte<br>
membrane (not shown) disposed therebetween. The fuel cell stack 2 further has<br>
a first end 204 and a second end 206. In particular embodiments, the first end<br>
204 is known as the "dry end" and the second end 206 is known as the "wet<br>
end."<br>
[0028] The fuel cell system 200 includes the anode supply manifold 76<br>
in communication with the anodes of the plurality of fuel cells 202, the anode<br>
supply manifold 76 is adapted to deliver an anode supply stream 208, e.g.<br>
gaseous hydrogen, to the plurality of fuel cells 202. The fuel cell system 200<br>
further includes an anode exhaust manifold 78 in communication with the anodes<br><br>
of the plurality of fuel cells 202. The anode exhaust manifold 78 is adapted to<br>
receive an anode exhaust stream (shown in FIG. 3), e.g. residual gaseous<br>
hydrogen, air, and water, from the plurality of fuel cells 202.<br>
[0029] In a particular embodiment of the invention, the fuel cell system<br>
200 includes a first valve 210 in communication with the anode supply manifold<br>
76 and a second valve 212 in communication with the anode exhaust manifold<br>
78. In one embodiment, the first valve 210 is disposed at the first end 204 of<br>
the fuel cell stack 2. The first valve 210 is adapted to exhaust a first quantity of<br>
air 214 and the anode supply stream 208 from the anode supply manifold 76.<br>
The second valve 212 is disposed at the second end 206 of the fuel cell stack 2.<br>
The second valve 212 is adapted to exhaust a second quantity of air 216 and an<br>
anode exhaust stream (shown in FIG. 3) from the anode exhaust manifold 78. In<br>
a further embodiment, the second valve 212 is disposed at the first end 204<br>
instead of the second end 206. It should be understood that the fuel cell stack 2<br>
may be supplied hydrogen as desired, and as long as the first valve 210 is<br>
disposed opposite the location of the hydrogen supply, for example.<br>
[0030] It should be appreciated that when a sufficient period of time<br>
has elapsed between a shutdown operation of the fuel cell system 200 and a<br>
start-up operation, the first and second quantities of air 214, 216 will accumulate<br>
in the anode supply and exhaust manifolds 76, 78. Further, it should be<br>
appreciated that the first and second quantities of air 214, 216 will accumulate,<br>
during a sufficient period of stack inoperability, on the anodes of the plurality of<br>
fuel cells 202.<br>
[0031] The fuel cell system 200 of the present disclosure may further<br>
have at least one resistive device 218 in electrical communication with the fuel<br>
cell stack 2. In particular embodiments, the resistive device 218 is a resistor. In<br>
further embodiments, the resistive device 218 is adapted to place a resistive load<br>
on the fuel cell stack 2 during startup, thereby militating against fuel cell<br>
degradation induced by carbon corrosion. A skilled artisan should understand<br>
that suitable resistive devices 218 may be used as desired.<br><br>
[0032] In particular embodiments, the fuel cell system 200 includes at<br>
least one voltage sensor (not shown) adapted to measure a voltage of at least<br>
one of the plurality of fuel cells 202. Illustratively, the at least one voltage sensor<br>
is adapted to measure an average voltage of the plurality of fuel cells 202.<br>
Alternatively, the at least one voltage sensor is adapted to measure one or more<br>
individual fuel cells within the plurality of fuel cells 202.<br>
[0033] In an illustrative embodiment, the fuel cell system 200 includes<br>
a controller (not shown). The controller may be adapted to actuate the first valve<br>
210 and the second valve 212, thereby opening or closing the first valve 210 and<br>
the second valve 212 as desired. For example, the controller may receive a<br>
signal from the at least one voltage sensor indicating that anodes of the plurality<br>
of fuel cells 202 have a sufficient quantity of hydrogen present. In a further<br>
embodiment, the controller can include a control algorithm configured to process<br>
a number of variables such as, for example, a pressure of the anode supply<br>
stream 208, a volume of the anode supply manifold 76, and a size of the fuel cell<br>
stack 2, and can actuate the first and second valves 210, 212 as desired. It<br>
should be understood that alternative means can also be used to determine the<br>
presence of the anode supply stream 208 in the anodes or in the anode supply<br>
manifold 76, such as a time-based model of air permeation into the cathodes, for<br>
example.<br>
[0034] In one embodiment, the fuel cell system 200 includes a<br>
compressor (not shown) in communication with the cathode inlet manifold 78.<br>
The compressor is adapted to supply a cathode supply stream (not shown) to the<br>
cathode inlet manifold 72. The cathode inlet manifold 72 is in fluid<br>
communication with the cathodes of the plurality of fuel cells 202. In a particular<br>
embodiment of the disclosure the fuel cell system 200 further includes a bypass<br>
valve (not shown) and bypass conduit (not shown) in fluid communication with<br>
the compressor. The bypass valve and conduit are adapted, for example, to<br>
allow the cathode supply stream to bypass the fuel cell stack 2 as desired. For<br>
example, it should be appreciated that the bypass conduit may be in fluid<br><br>
communication with the first valve 210 and the second valve 212 for dilution of<br>
hydrogen exhausted via the valves 210, 212.<br>
[0035] As shown in FIG. 2, the present invention further includes a<br>
method for starting the fuel cell system 200. The method includes providing the<br>
first valve 210 in an open position and providing the second valve 212 in a closed<br>
position. The anode supply stream 208 is supplied to the anode supply manifold<br>
76. While the first valve 210 is in the open position, a first quantity of air 214 is<br>
exhausted from the anode supply manifold 76 through the first valve 210. It<br>
should be appreciated that the first quantity of air 214 is caused to be exhausted<br>
due to the flow of the anode supply stream 208 into the anode supply manifold<br>
76. The flow is also sufficiently low to minimize a distribution of the anode supply<br>
stream 208 into the anodes of the plurality of fuel cells 202 while the second<br>
valve 212 is in the closed position. It should be appreciated that the second<br>
valve 212 being in the closed position inhibits the distribution of the anode supply<br>
stream 208 into the anodes because the second valve 212 militates against an<br>
exhaust of the second quantity of air 216 while closed.<br>
[0036] The method further includes closing the first valve 210 and<br>
opening the second valve 212, for example, when the anode supply stream 208<br>
has substantially filled the anode supply manifold 76. It should be appreciated<br>
that closing the first valve 210 when the anode supply manifold 76 is substantially<br>
filled minimizes hydrogen emissions by militating against an exhaust of the<br>
anode supply stream 208, such as would occur with a hydrogen purge, for<br>
example. In further embodiments, the closing of the first valve 210 is<br>
simultaneous with the opening of the second valve 212.<br>
[0037] As shown in FIG. 3, when the first valve 210 is closed and the<br>
second valve 212 is opened, the second quantity of air 216 is exhausted from the<br>
anodes of the plurality of fuel cells 202 and the anode exhaust manifold 78<br>
through the second valve 212. It should be understood that the second quantity<br>
of air 216 is exhausted from the anode exhaust manifold 78 and the plurality of<br>
fuel cells 202 by the flow of the anode supply stream 208 being supplied to the<br><br>
plurality of fuel cells 202 and a flow of an anode exhaust stream 300 being<br>
exhausted from the plurality of fuel cells 202.<br>
[0038] In operation, the anode supply stream 208 is supplied<br>
substantially uniformly to the plurality of fuel cells 202. The filling of the anode<br>
supply header 76 with the anode supply stream 208, while inhibiting a movement<br>
of the second quantity of air 216 from the anodes of the plurality of fuel cells 202<br>
and the anode exhaust manifold 78, facilitates the substantially uniform supply<br>
and distribution of the anode supply stream 208. The substantially uniform<br>
supply and distribution occurs, for example, when the first valve 210 is closed<br>
and the second valve 212 is opened.<br>
[0039] In a further embodiment of the present disclosure, the method<br>
includes measuring a voltage of at least one of the plurality of fuel cells 202.<br>
Illustratively, the voltage is measured with the at least one voltage sensor. The<br>
measured voltage may be used as an indicator of whether residual hydrogen, the<br>
anode supply stream 208, or the first or second quantities of air 214, 216 are<br>
present in anodes of the fuel cell stack 2. The measured voltage may also be<br>
used to actuate the first valve 210 and the second valve 212. For example, if the<br>
fuel cell system 200 has only been shutdown for a minimal period of time and<br>
there is still a predetermined concentration of hydrogen in the anodes of the<br>
plurality of fuel cells 202, then the first valve 210 is not opened. Illustratively, the<br>
first valve 210 is closed when an average voltage of the plurality of fuel cells 202<br>
is greater than a predetermined maximum value, such as about 1.0 V. In<br>
particular embodiments, the first valve 210 is closed when the average voltage of<br>
the plurality of fuel cells 202 is greater than a maximum valve of about 0.6 V. In<br>
one embodiment, the first valve 210 is closed when the measured voltage of one<br>
of the plurality of fuel cells 202 is greater than about 0.1 V. It should be<br>
understood that other measured voltages may be used to actuate the first and<br>
second valves 210, 212 as desired. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that a<br>
different set of control diagnostics can be used as desired to determine a quantity<br>
of hydrogen present in the fuel cell stack 2.<br><br>
[0040] The method of the present disclosure may further include<br>
supplying a cathode supply stream (not shown) to a cathode inlet manifold (not<br>
shown). The cathode inlet manifold is in communication with the plurality of fuel<br>
cells 202. In an illustrative example, the step of supplying the cathode supply<br>
stream is performed after supplying the anode supply stream 208 to the anode<br>
supply manifold 76, for example after the hydrogen purge is completed. In<br>
particular embodiments, if the cathode supply stream is desired to dilute the<br>
anode exhaust stream 300, the cathode supply stream may be bypassed around<br>
the cathodes. As an example, the anode exhaust stream 300 may be<br>
temporarily stored and then diluted following the hydrogen purge. As a further<br>
alternative, the excess hydrogen in the anode exhaust stream 300 is eliminated<br>
with a catalytic combustor, for example.<br>
[0041] In a further embodiment, the cathode supply stream may be<br>
combined with the first or second quantities of air 214, 216 exhausted from the<br>
fuel cell stack 2. It should be appreciated that the step of combining the cathode<br>
supply stream with the first or second quantities of air 214, 216 is effective in<br>
diluting any quantity of hydrogen gas present in the first or second quantities of<br>
air 214, 216. In particular, the cathode supply stream can be allowed to bypass<br>
the fuel cell stack 2, for example with the bypass valve and conduit, where it can<br>
be used to dilute hydrogen gas present in the exhausted first and second<br>
quantities of air 214, 216. It should be appreciated that the concentration of<br>
hydrogen in the exhausted first and second quantities of air 214, 216 is less than<br>
a desired quantity, for example, about 4 percent.<br>
[0042] With reference to FIGS. 4 and 5, a further embodiment of the<br>
invention including a plurality of fuel cell stacks is described. For the purpose of<br>
clarity, like structures from FIGS. 2 and 3 have the same reference numerals and<br>
are denoted with a prime (') or double prime (") symbol.<br>
[0043] As depicted FIG. 4, a fuel cell system 200' includes a first fuel<br>
cell stack 2' including a first plurality of fuel cells 202', a first anode supply<br>
manifold 76' and a first anode exhaust manifold 78' in fluid communication with<br><br>
the first plurality of fuel cells 202'. The first fuel cell stack 2' includes a first valve<br>
210' in fluid communication with the anode supply manifold 76'. The first fuel cell<br>
stack 2' may have a first resistive device 218'.<br>
[0044] The fuel cell system 200' further includes a second fuel cell<br>
stack 2" having a second plurality of fuel cells 202", a second anode supply<br>
manifold 76" and a second anode exhaust manifold 78" in fluid communication<br>
with the second plurality of fuel cells 202". The second fuel cell stack 2"<br>
includes a second valve 210" in fluid communication with the anode supply<br>
manifold 76". The second fuel cell stack 2" may have a second resistive device<br>
218".<br>
[0045] The dual-stack fuel cell system 200' also includes a third valve<br>
212'. The third valve 212' is in fluid communication with the first anode exhaust<br>
manifold 78' and the second anode exhaust manifold 78" of the first and second<br>
fuel cell stacks 2', 2". As with the embodiment described in FIGS. 2 and 3, the<br>
fuel cell system 200' in operation militates against a non-uniform distribution of<br>
the anode supply stream to the plurality of fuel cells 202', 202" of each fuel cell<br>
stack 2', 2".<br>
[0046] One of ordinary skill in the art should understand that the start-<br>
up method described herein may be employed with the fuel cell system having a<br>
plurality of fuel cell stacks. For example, the method includes providing the first<br>
valve 210' and the second valve 210" in an open position and providing the third<br>
valve 212' in a closed position. The anode supply stream 208', 208" is supplied<br>
to the anode supply manifolds 76', 76". While the first and second valves 210',<br>
210" are in the open position, a first quantity of air 214', 214" is exhausted. The<br>
third valve 212', being in the closed position, inhibits the distribution of the anode<br>
supply stream 208', 208" into the anodes.<br>
[0047] As shown in FIG. 5, the method further includes closing the first<br>
and second valves 210', 210" and opening the third valve 212', for example,<br>
when the anode supply streams 208', 208" have substantially filled the anode<br><br>
supply manifolds 76', 76". The closing of the first and second valves 210', 210"<br>
may be simultaneous with the opening of the third valve 212'. The opening of the<br>
third valve 212' facilitates an exhausting of the second quantity of air 216', 216"<br>
from the anodes of the fuel cell stacks 2', 2" and the anode exhaust manifolds<br>
216', 216" during a start-up operation of the fuel cell system 200'.<br>
[0048] It should be understood that the fuel cell system and method of<br>
the present invention provide a substantially uniform distribution of hydrogen to<br>
the anodes of the fuel cell stacks. As depicted in FIG. 6, it is now shown that the<br>
present fuel cell systems and methods inhibit cell reversal, particularly during a<br>
start-up operation of the fuel cell system 200. The individual fuel cells of the fuel<br>
cell stack receive hydrogen substantially uniformly and simultaneously during<br>
start-up with the present fuel cell system and method. This results in a<br>
substantially uniform voltage between individual fuel cells of the fuel cell stack in<br>
comparison to a conventional hydrogen distribution.<br>
[0049] As shown by FIG. 7, a voltage degradation of the fuel cell<br>
system following repetitive start-up and shutdown operations is militated against<br>
with the fuel cell system 200 and method of the present invention. In particular, it<br>
is now surprisingly found that a rate of voltage degradation (uV/cycle) of the<br>
plurality of fuel cells 202 is optimized. In particular, a substantially uniform rate of<br>
voltage degradation between individual fuel cells employed in the fuel cell system<br>
200 and method of the invention is observed in comparison to individual fuel cells<br>
having a conventional hydrogen distribution.<br>
[0050] The present invention further optimizes hydrogen emissions on<br>
start-up by predicting when the stack anode has air or hydrogen upon a start-up<br>
operation, for example by measuring the voltage of the fuel cell stack 2. It should<br>
be appreciated that the hydrogen emissions are further minimized as the quantity<br>
of hydrogen present in the air exhausted from the second valve 212 is diluted, for<br>
example, with air from the compressor. The uniform distribution of hydrogen to<br>
the anodes reduces a mixing of hydrogen with air exiting the fuel cell stack 2<br><br>
through the second valve 212, thus contributing to a lower hydrogen emission<br>
upon start-up.<br>
[0051] While certain representative embodiments and details have<br>
been shown for purposes of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from the<br>
scope of the disclosure, which is further described in the following appended<br>
