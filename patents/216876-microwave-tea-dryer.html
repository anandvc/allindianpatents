				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a microwave tea dryer for use in drying<br>
of tea.<br>
Drying is one of the most important stage in manufacturing of black tea.<br>
During drying, the fermented tea is dried up and its moisture content is<br>
reduced to about 2-5%. The main purpose of drying operation is:<br>
a) to stop the process of fermentation ;<br>
b) to reduce the moisture content;<br>
c) to give a granular form to the fermented tea.<br>
Drying of tea is performed in drying machines commonly known as dryer.<br>
The presently available dryers are of three types —<br>
a) chain type dryer<br>
b) fluid bed dryer<br>
c) vibro fluid bed dryer<br>
In all the above three dryers, the process of drying is performed by heat<br>
and mass transfer mechanism. The inlet temperature of the dryer is<br>
generally held between 95-100°C.- The outlet temperature is maintained<br>
at 50-55°C. The quality of the final made tea during drying depends on<br>
the following parameters :<br>
a) inlet and outlet temperature of the hot air<br>
b) feed rate of the fermented leaf<br>
c) run through time of solid<br>
d) volume of air<br>
Conventionally, the inlet temperature of hot blast of air into the dryer is<br>
kept constant by regulating the temperature of the furnace and velocity<br>
of not air from the furnace. In the old chain type of dryers, the fermented<br>
tea is moved from inlet to outlet over a chain type of conveyor belt in<br>
several layers inside. The hot air is blown from down end so that it moves<br>
through the layers of fermented tea residing over the conveyor. The<br>
disadvantage of the dryer is that the heat transfer mechanism to the solid<br>
particles is not efficient eausing toss of heat.<br>
The fluid bed dryers (FBD) and the Vibro fluid bed dryers (VBFD) are<br>
much more efficient than the chain type dryers in heat transfer<br>
mechanism. The movement of the solid particles takes place due to<br>
fluidization and vibration. The major disadvantages of the above type of<br>
dryers are -<br>
i) loss of heat due to inefficient heat transfer<br>
ii) low efficiency of the heating system<br>
iii) highly noisy<br>
iv) pollution of air due to the heating air fired by coal, gas or oil<br>
v) contamination of the tea as it comes in direct contact with the hot<br>
air.<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a new type<br>
of tea dryer which would avoid problems of heat loss and would therefore<br>
be highly efficient for drying of tea.<br>
Another object is to provide a new type of tea dryer which would be<br>
environment friendly and will not be noisy during operation.<br>
Yet further object is to provide a new type of tea dryer which apart from<br>
being efficient for tea drying purposes would not contaminate the product<br>
to be dryed and avoid problems such as contamination of tea during<br>
drying when it comes in direct contact with hot air.<br>
Yet further object is to provide for a new tea dryer which would provide<br>
for fast, economic and efficient drying of tea as compared to conventional<br>
tea dryers presently available.<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a microwave<br>
tea dryer for drying of tea comprising:<br>
means for generating microwave radiation being a magnetron housed in a<br>
drying chamber (9) and allowing the thus generated radiation to fall on<br>
the tea to be dried and thereby effecting drying by vibration and<br>
consequential heating of the liquid volatile components in said tea to<br>
thereby dry said tea;<br>
means for regulated supply of the tea to the drying chamber such that<br>
the radiation generated vibrate and heat the liquid/volatile components<br>
of said tea comprising:<br>
(a) feeder/hopper (1) adapted to allow fall of tea on the top conveyor in<br>
said drying chamber and positioned adjacent to said means for<br>
generating microwave radiation;<br>
(b) means for controlling the thickness and speed of the material on<br>
the said conveyor comprising a separator means being a spreader<br>
(2); and<br>
(c) a plough means (8) adapted to provide an even distribution of<br>
heating to the tea and positioned just above the conveyors (3) so as<br>
to plough through the tea travelling on the conveyor; and<br>
means for collection of the thus dried tea,<br>
characterized in that said top conveyor is adapted such that initially the<br>
spread tea is first allowed to traverse through the said drying chamber for<br>
a first stage of primary drying and thereafter tea is allowed to fall on a<br>
further moving lower conveyor which runs in the reverse direction for<br>
further secondary drying of the tea such that a drop door (13) provided<br>
adjacent to the right end of said top conveyor allows the primary dried<br>
tea to fall on the further said moving lower conveyor, which runs in the<br>
reverse direction from said first conveyor as aforesaid and a second drop<br>
door (14) adjacent to the end of the said lower conveyor adapted to allow<br>
drop of said tea in a collecting bin (10) provided below.<br>
It is also possible by way of the above disclosed embodiment of the tea<br>
dryer having the plurality of drying chambers to provide for a tea drying<br>
system with variable power depending upon the end user requirements.<br>
The fermented tea will first enter the first drying chamber when the first<br>
drying step is initiated and thereafter the tea is required to traverse<br>
through plurality of said drying chambers until the tea is completely<br>
dried up upto the desired moisture content. Thus, depending upon the<br>
no. of such drying chambers required, the length of the dryer and the<br>
power of the dryer may be varied to meet end user requirements.<br>
The microwave radiation is generated by means of microwave heating<br>
device magnetron. The electrical and electronic circuitry for the<br>
magnetron are preferably housed at the roof of the drying chamber.<br>
The system, in particular, the drying chamber(s) is further provided with<br>
means for exiting the water vapours and/or other particles released from<br>
said material during drying from said chamber(s).<br>
Preferably, the material from the feeder/hopper is allowed to fall in the<br>
conveyor means which is first adapted to move from left to right in said<br>
drying chamber ;<br>
a drop door provided adjacent the right end of said conveyor allow the<br>
thus primary dried material to fall on a further moving lower conveyor<br>
which run from right to left for further secondary drying of the material;<br>
a second drop door adjacent the left end of said lower conveyor adapted<br>
to allow drop of said dried material in a collecting bin.<br>
The conveyor is driven by ac motor means which is coupled to the<br>
conveyor driver shaft through a variable gear box. The conveyor is<br>
adapted to first move from left to right in said drying chamber and then<br>
downwards at the rightmost end to effectuate a lower conveyor movement<br>
from right to left. Thus by way of the above conveyor means a two stage<br>
drying of the material is possible.<br>
The thickness of the tea on the conveyor is controlled by separator means<br>
and to provide an even distribution of heating to the material plough<br>
means are provided to plough through the material on the conveyor.<br>
The details of the invention its objects and advantages are explained<br>
hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary<br>
embodiments of the microwave heating device as per the accompanying<br>
figures wherein<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary embodiment of the<br>
microwave tea dryer of the invention for use in drying of tea.<br>
Fig. 2 is an illustration of another embodiment of the microwave tea dryer<br>
of the invention.<br>
As shown in figure 1, the fermented tea is allowed to fall in the feeder (1)<br>
either manually or through conveyor. At the bottom of the feeder, the tea<br>
fall on the conveyor (3) which moves from left to right direction into the<br>
drying chamber through two slits (16). The tea is carried into the drying<br>
chamber. The thickness of the tea on the conveyor is controlled by a<br>
spreader (2). To give an evenly distribution of heating to the tea the tea is<br>
ploughed by using two ploughs (8) resting slightly above the conveyor.<br>
The drying chamber is provided with microwave heating device i.e.<br>
magnetrons (9) at the roof. The electrical and electronic circuits for the<br>
magnetron is placed in a chamber (15). The conveyor is driven by an ac<br>
motor (6) which is coupled to the conveyor driver shaft through a variable<br>
gear box (7). The variable gear box makes the speed of the conveyor very<br>
slow (which can be varied). The conveyor moves downward at the<br>
rightmost end over two sprockets (4) for the tea to get dried fully, the<br>
conveyor speed is so adjusted that the tea falls through the 1st drop door<br>
(13) to the conveyor again. The bottom chamber also get heated to some<br>
extent due to the main chamber. Therefore the tea gets an extra time to<br>
be heated to some due to the chamber. Therefore, the tea gets an extra<br>
time to be heated if some water molecules are left, while travelling from<br>
right end to the left end. Finally the dried tea is collected in a collecting<br>
bin (10) through the 2nd drop door (14). Any extra tea spilling over is<br>
collected in a spill over bin (11).<br>
The water vapours and other particles gets released from the tea in the<br>
drying chamber must be ventilated out through the ventilating ducts (18)<br>
with the help of a fan (17). The feeder can be inspected by climbing<br>
through the steps (12).<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 2 which shows another<br>
embodiment of the microwave tea dryers of variable capacity and size<br>
depending upon the end user requirements. This is an optional design of<br>
the dryer when the microwave power required is very high. In case of<br>
higher microwave power requirement for large size of tea dryer, it may not<br>
be possible to install magnetrons of high power in a single cavity. In that<br>
case the power will have to splitted up into several parts.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 in such case the microwave tea dryer can be provided<br>
with plurality of drying chambers or cavities (D, F) operatively connected<br>
to one another through the cavity joining section B, in whereby the tea to<br>
be dried is allowed to enter the first of said drying chamber for an initial<br>
drying followed by subsequent drying chambers for stagewise drying of<br>
the tea upto the desired moisture content. Each of the cavities is<br>
separated from the earlier preceding cavities by a drive cavity (G and E),<br>
which is designed to drive the conveyor belt and thus effect the<br>
transportation of the tea from one cavity to the other. The drive cavities G<br>
and E further comprise a substantially rectangular housing comprising<br>
the inner magnetron C, which heats up the main cavities as well as the<br>
drive cavities. The whole system is furthered powered by an external<br>
magnetron A adapted to heat up the tea travelling through the drive<br>
cavities and the main cavities D and F.<br>
Each of the drying chambers is provided with means of microwave<br>
radiation of desired power preferably by use of magnetrons. Thus by way<br>
of such modified dryer it is possible to have high powered drying such as<br>
using microwave power of 120K W by using 7 drying chambers each<br>
accommodating about 3 nos. of 6K W magnetrons. The specific no. of<br>
drying chambers and the power in each can be determined based on end<br>
user requirements.<br>
The above disclosed microwave tea dryer of the invention would provide<br>
for drying of material such as tea and the like by allowing the radiation to<br>
fall on the material to be heated after scattered by a fan. When the<br>
radiation hits a liquid molecule, it is vibrated and heat is produced. This<br>
heat dries up the liquid and other volatile compounds. Since the process<br>
of heating is by vibration due to radiation and not due to heat transfer<br>
mechanism, the efficiency is much more higher. The vibration does not<br>
take place if the material does not contain liquid. Hence the material is<br>
not unnecessarily heated in the absence of liquid i.e. water. In this case<br>
there is no any chance of overheating. This characteristic is very<br>
important for tea drying because in other type of tea dryers, extra<br>
precaution has to be taken so that tea is not over dried or burnt.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the microwave tea dryers of the invention to<br>
favour drying of tea with the following advantageous features :<br>
1. Heat loss is less because the dry particles are never heated and only<br>
wet particles are heated.<br>
2. Since heat is produced through electricity the efficiency is high.<br>
Moreover the microwave radiation can be strictly prevented from<br>
leaking out.<br>
3. Since there is no fuel firing system, the drier will be free from noise.<br>
4. Radiation does not cause air pollution, so free from air pollution.<br>
5. The tea is free from being contaminated with fuel particles since<br>
heating is done by radiation, not by fuel.<br>
6. Total time of drying is less than conventional dryers.<br>
The drier of the invention can be scaled up or down in as per capacity<br>
requirement. The optimum result is obtained by properly selecting the<br>
a) size of the conveyor<br>
b) speed of the conveyor<br>
c) total power of the magnetron<br>
The microwave tea dryer of the invention is thus a complete solution to<br>
the problem faced in the presently used dryers based on fuel fired<br>
heating.<br>
