Process for Preparing Substituted Pentacenes<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing substituted pentacenes,<br>
and to novel pentacenes prepared by this process. The invention further<br>
relates to the use of the novel pentacenes as semiconductors or charge<br>
transport materials in optical, electrooptical or electronic devices including<br>
field effect transistors (FETs), electroluminescent, photovoltaic and sensor<br>
devices. The invention further relates to FETs and other semiconducting<br>
components or materials comprising the novel pentacenes.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
In recent years, there has been development of organic semiconducting<br>
materials in order to produce more versatile, lower cost electronic devices.<br>
Such materials find application in a wide range of devices or apparatus,<br>
including organic field effect transistors (OFETs), organic light emitting<br>
diodes (OLEDs), photodetectors, photovoltaic (PV) cells, sensors, memory<br>
elements and logic circuits to name just a few. The organic<br>
semiconducting materials are typically present in the electronic device in<br>
the form of a thin layer, for example less than 1 micron thick.<br>
Pentacene has shown promise as an organic semiconducting material.<br>
Pentacene has been described as requiring a highly crystalline structure in<br>
order to provide a molecular orientation which results in good charge<br>
mobility. Thus, in the prior art, thin films of pentacene have been vapour<br>
deposited, due in part to the fact that pentacene is rather insoluble in<br>
common solvents. However, vapour deposition requires expensive and<br>
sophisticated equipment. In view of the latter problem, one approach has<br>
been to apply a solution containing a precursor pentacene and then<br>
chemically converting, for example by heat, the precursor compound into<br>
pentacene. However, the latter method is also complex and it is difficult to<br>
control in order to obtain the necessary ordered structure for good charge<br>
mobility.<br><br>
Soluble pentacene compounds comprising silylethynyi groups, like 6,13-<br>
bis(triethylsilylethynyl)pentacene have recently been described in the prior<br>
art as organic semiconducting compounds [1,2]. This compound exhibits<br>
high performance as the semiconducting layer in an organic field-effect<br>
transistor (OFET), with mobility of 0.4 cm2/Vs and current on/off ratio of<br>
106 measured [3]. Meanwhile, significant work has been undertaken by<br>
various groups to design and prepare soluble pentacene materials that<br>
offer even higher performance in terms of semiconducting properties, and<br>
that also show enhanced processability and environmental stability.<br>
However, the properties of the bis(silylethynyl)pentacenes described in<br>
prior art still leave room for further improvement. For example, pentacene<br>
type molecules degrade in the presence of air and light due to a<br>
photooxidation process [21,22].<br>
One aim of the present invention was to provide further pentacene<br>
compounds that are useful as organic semiconducting materials.<br>
In prior art 6,13-bis(trialkylsilylethynyl)pentacenes with additional<br>
substituents in 1-, 2-, 3-, 8-, 9-, 10- and/or 11-position are disclosed [23].<br>
By adding substituents in these positions, which are prone to the above-<br>
described photo-oxidation process, it is possible to hinder the degradation.<br>
This leads to polyacenes that are useful as charge transport and<br>
semiconducting materials and have improved solubility and charge carrier<br>
mobility and improved stability especially against air, heat and light.<br>
Furthermore, when these substituted polyacenes are provided in a<br>
formulation together with an organic binder, improved semiconducting<br>
materials with good processibility are obtained which do still show a<br>
surprisingly high charge carrier mobility.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have now found that especially<br>
pentacenes with substituents in 1-, 4-, 8- and 11-position do unexpectedly<br>
show high charge carrier mobility, good solubility in standard organic<br>
solvents, and good processibility.<br>
However, it was also found that such substituted pentacenes are difficult<br><br>
to synthesize. Generally, pentacene ring-network precursors have<br>
previously been constructed using either the Aldol condensation [4] or the<br>
Cava reaction [5]. However, the inventors have found that for 1,4,8,11-<br>
tetrasubstituted 6,13-bis(triethylsilylethynyl) pentacene both the Aldol and<br>
Cava methodologies yield little success in constructing the pentacene<br>
ring-network precursors in high and reproducible yields. Therefore a more<br>
successful alternative method is high desirable.<br>
Thus, another aim of the present invention was to find an improved<br>
synthesis method for 1,4,8,11-substituted pentacenes. Other aims of the<br>
present invention are immediately evident to the expert from the following<br>
detailed description.<br>
It was now found that these aims can be achieved by providing methods<br>
and materials as claimed in the present invention. In particular, this<br>
invention relates to a new synthetic route to prepare 1,4,8,11-<br>
tetrasubstituted pentacene, which circumvents the key drawbacks of the<br>
previous routes based around the Aldol condensation or the Cava<br>
reaction. Furthermore, it provides novel 1,4,8,11-tetrasubstituted<br>
pentacenes with improved properties, especially high charge carrier<br>
mobility, high solubility and good processibility.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a new synthetic route to prepare 1,4,8,11-<br>
tetrasubstituted pentacene whereby the pentacene ring-network precursor<br>
is constructed using a Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction involving an<br>
isobenzofuran intermediate. The invention further relates to novel<br>
substituted pentacenes with improved properties.<br>
One preferred compound that exhibits improved semiconducting<br>
properties is 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-6,13-bis(triethylsilylethynyl)pentacene.<br>
When using this compound in the semiconducting layer of an OFET<br>
device, a mobility of 6 cm2/Vs is measured.<br>
Each of the synthetic routes for preparing substituted pentacenes<br>
according to prior art, which are based around the Aldol condensation or<br>
the Cava reaction, has certain drawbacks.<br><br>
For example, Figure 1 exemplarily shows the Aldol route known from prior<br>
art, which has here been adapted to the synthesis of 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-<br>
6,13-bis(triethylsilylethynyl) pentacene.<br>
The reagents used for the process steps of Figure 1 are as follows:<br>
i. Et2O; ii. cone. H2SO4; Hi. LiAIH4, THF; iv. DMSO, (COCI)2, Et3N, DCM; v.<br>
1,4-cyclohexadione, 5% KOH, IMS; vi. triethylsilyl-acetylene, n-BuLi, Et2O,<br>
THF;vii. SnCI2, 10%HCI.<br>
In this method, the problem is that isolation of the dicarboxyaldehyde<br>
intermediate, like e.g. 3,6-dimethylbenzene-1,2-bis(carboxyaldehyde), is<br>
not possible. A variety of oxidation methods to obtain the<br>
dicarboxyaldehyde intermediate from the diol, 3,6-dimethylbenzene-1,2-<br>
bis(methanol), have been tested. Some oxidation methods (using<br>
manganese(IV) oxide or pyridinium chlorochromate) result in the formation<br>
of the lactone product, 4,7-dimethyl-3H-isobenzofuran-1-one, which<br>
cannot be further reacted in the Aldol condensation step. Whereas the<br>
Swem oxidation (using dimethyl sulfoxide/oxalyl chloride) yields a complex<br>
product that cannot be clearly identified by proton NMR spectroscopy.<br>
This complex product when reacted in the Aldol condensation step does<br>
however yield the pentacenequinone product, and so the<br>
dicarboxyaldehyde must have been regenerated from this complex<br>
product under these conditions. However, the yield is low and the reaction<br>
suffers from poor reproducibility.<br>
Figure 2 exemplarily shows the Cava route known from prior art, which<br>
has here been adapted to the synthesis of 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-6,13-<br>
bis(triethylsilylethynyl)pentacene.<br>
The reagents used for the process steps of Figure 2 are as follows:<br>
i. Et2O; ii. cone. H2SO4; iii. LiAIH4, THF; iv. PBr3, Et2O ; v. p-benzoquinone,<br>
Kl, DMF; vi. triethylsilyl-acetylene, n-BuLi, Et2O, THF; vii. SnCI2, 10% HCI.<br>
Here, the problem is that reaction between the bis(bromomethyl)<br>
intermediate and p-benzoquinone to form the pentacenequinone product<br>
gives very low yields.<br><br>
The inventors of the present invention have found an alternative route to<br>
1,4,8,11-tetrasubstituted pentacene. In the literature there is an isolated<br>
report of the synthesis of pentacenequinone via a Diels-Alder reaction<br>
between isobenzofuran and p-benzoquinone under acidic conditions [6].<br>
Therefore, it was envisaged that by preparing the appropriate<br>
isobenzofuran derivative and reacting it with p-benzoquinone, the<br>
pentacenequinone product can be prepared. However, the required 4,7-<br>
disubstituted isobenzofuran derivatives (like 4,7-dimethyl-isobenzofuran)<br>
have not been previously prepared, nor has their reaction with p-<br>
benzoquinone been reported.<br>
A preferred process of the present invention is exemplarily illustrated in<br>
Figure 3 for the preparation of 1,4,8,1 l-tetramethyl-6,13-bis(trialkylsilyl-<br>
ethynyl) pentacene 9. The reagents used in the process steps shown in<br>
Figure 3 are as follows: a1) NaBH4, THF or Zn, HOAc; a2) MnO2, DCM; a3)<br>
2-iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX); b) DiBAL, toluene, Et2O; c) BF3.OEt2, MeOH; d)<br>
n-BuLi, i-Pr2NH, petroleum ether 40-60; e) p-benzoquinone, THF; f) NaOAc,<br>
MeOH; g) 1. trialkylsilyl-acetylene (e.g. wherein R is ethyl), n-BuLi, Et2O,<br>
THF; 2. SnCI2, 10% HCI.<br>
The process according to Figure 3 is explained in detail below. However,<br>
the educts and the reagents and exact reaction conditions for each step<br>
may be varied by the skilled person based on general knowledge.<br>
Preparation of the educts (2) and (3):<br>
The synthesis of the two starting materials, i.e. the 4,7-disubstituted<br>
isobenzofuran-1,3-dione (2) used in step a1) and the 1,2-bis(hydroxy-<br>
methyl)-3,6-disubstituted benzene (3) used in step a2) or a3), has already<br>
been reported in the literature 3.[7] The steps are a Diels-Alder<br>
reaction,[7,8] an acid-catalysed dehydration of the resultant cycloadduct<br>
1,[7,8] and a reduction of the anhydride 2 to the diol 3.[7,9].<br>
Thus, a preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to a<br>
process as described above and below, wherein the educt (2) of step a1)<br>
and the educt (3) of steps a2) and a3) are prepared by the following steps:<br><br>
x1) reacting 2,5-disubstituted furan with maleic anhydride by Diels-Alder<br>
cycloaddition to form a cycloadduct (1),<br>
x2) dehydrating the product (1) of step x1) in the presence of an acid to<br>
form a 4,7-disubstituted isobenzofuran-1,3-dione (2),<br>
and, in case of preparing (3),<br>
x3) reduction of the product (2) of step x2) in the presence of a hydride<br>
reagent to form 1,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-3,6-disubstituted benzene (3).<br>
Figure 4 shows a preferred method for preparing (2) and (3). The starting<br>
materials 2,5-dimethylfuran and maleic anhydride are both commercially<br>
available. The reagents used in the process steps shown in Figure 4 are as<br>
follows: x1) Et2O; x2) cone. H2SO4; x3) LiAIH4, THF.<br>
Step a1): Reduction to 4.7-Dimethyl-3H-sobenzofuran-1-one 4<br>
Anhydride 2 can be selectively reduced to the lactone 4 by two methods.<br>
Firstly, the reduction is effected by the use of a more selective reducing<br>
agent, which is preferably a hydride agent like for example sodium<br>
borohydride.[10] Alternatively, using a modified Yang-Zhu reduction[11]<br>
as described by Rainbolt er a/, [12] anhydride 2 is reduced using zinc in<br>
acetic acid at 100°C to yield the lactone 4.<br>
Preferred reducing reagents include for example NaBH4, Zn-HOAc, H2-Pt,<br>
or RuCl2(PPh3)2. Preferred solvents for this step include for example THF,<br>
dioxane, acetic acid, alcohol. The reaction temperature can be varied<br>
depending on the solvent and the reagents. Suitable temperatures are<br>
e.g. 23°C, 70°C 90°C, or 100°C.<br>
Step a2): Oxidation to prepare 4,7-Dimethvl-3H-isobenzofuran-1-one 4<br>
From the previously reported diol 3,[7,9] the next step is an oxidation<br>
using an oxidising agent, like e.g. manganese(IV) oxide, based upon the<br>
method of Hirano et al who prepared 3H-isobenzofuran-1-one with this<br>
method.[13] Preferably, a large excess of oxidizing agent is employed,<br>
typically 10 equivalents, in order for complete conversion to the desired<br>
lactone product 4. If lower quantities of oxidizing agent are used, a mixture<br>
of lactone and lactol products is obtained.<br><br>
Preferred oxidising agents include for example manganese(IV) oxide or<br>
pyridinium chlorochromate. Preferred solvents for this step include for<br>
example DCM or alcohols. The reaction temperature can be varied<br>
depending on the solvent and the reagents. Suitable temperatures are<br>
e.g. 23°C, 40°C or 70°C.<br>
Step a3): Oxidation to prepare 1-Hydroxy-4,7-dirnethyl-1,3-dihydro-<br>
isobenzofuran 5a<br>
Diol 3 can be selectively oxidized to the lactol 5a using the method<br>
described by Corey et al which employs 2-iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) as the<br>
oxidizing agent.[16] Typically for 1,4-diols like 3, further oxidation to the<br>
lactone does not occur to a significant degree.[16]<br>
Preferred oxidizing agents include for example 2-iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX).<br>
Preferred solvents for this step include for example DMSO. The reaction<br>
temperature can be varied depending on the solvent and the reagents. A<br>
suitable temperature is e.g. 23°C.<br>
Steps b). c): Reduction and methylation to prepare 1-Methoxy-4,7-<br>
dimethyl-1,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran 5b<br>
Lactone 4 is selectively reduced to the lactol 5a in the presence of a<br>
reducing agent, following the method described by Rainbolt et al which<br>
uses diisobutylaluminium hydride at -60°C,[12] also known as Rodrigo's<br>
conditions.[14] After isolation, the lactol 5a is reacted with a methylation<br>
agent, like e.g. methanol, in the presence of a a Lewis acid catalyst, like<br>
e.g. boron trifluoride diethyl etherate, to yield the methylated lactol 5b,<br>
following the method of Man et a/ who prepared 1-methoxy-1,3-dihydro-<br>
isobenzofuran in this manner.[15]<br>
Preferred reducing agents for step b) include for example<br>
diisobutylaluminium hydride. Preferred solvents for step b) include for<br>
example DCM, Et2O, toluene or mixtures thereof. The reaction<br>
temperature in step b) can be varied depending on the solvent and the<br>
reagents. Suitable temperatures are e.g. -78°C or -60°C.<br><br>
Preferred methylation reagents for step c) include for example BF3.OEt2-<br>
MeOH. Preferred solvents for step c) include for example methanol. The<br>
reaction temperature in step c) can be varied depending on the solvent<br>
and the reagents. Suitable temperatures are e.g. 0°C or 23°C.<br>
Steps d), e): Formation of 4,7-dimethyl-isobenzofuran 6 and Diels-Alder<br>
reaction to prepare 1,4,8,11-Tetramethyl-5,14,7,12-diepoxy-5,7,12,14-<br>
octahvdropentacene-6,13-dione 7<br>
From the methylated lactol 5b, the critical isobenzofuran intermediate, 4,7-<br>
dimethyl-isobenzofuran 6, is formed by treatment with lithium<br>
diisopropyiamide in an analogous manner to that reported by Naito and<br>
Rickborn for the preparation of isobenzofuran.[17] A method of forming<br>
isobenzofuran from 2-(dimethoxymethyl)benzyl alcohol under acidic<br>
conditions has also been reported by Smith and Dibble[6] Isobenzofuran 6<br>
is relatively stable and there are reports on the stability of similar<br>
derivatives,[18] nevertheless isobenzofuran 6 is kept in dilute solution<br>
rather than concentrated to dryness, and is used in the subsequent Diels-<br>
Alder reaction as rapidly as possible. In the Diels-Alder reaction,<br>
isobenzofuran 6 is reacted with p-benzoquinone to yield the bis-<br>
cycloadduct 7. Unlike the report of Dibble and Smith where acidic<br>
conditions are used,[6] in the present invention the product isolated still<br>
contains the epoxy bridges and has not undergone dehydration to yield<br>
the pentacenequinone product.<br>
Preferred reagents for step d) include for example lithium<br>
diisopropyiamide. Preferred solvents for step d) include for example<br>
petroleum distillates. The reaction temperature in step d) can be varied<br>
depending on the solvent and the reagents. Suitable temperatures are<br>
e.g. 0°C or 23°C.<br>
The preferred reactant for step e) is p-benzoquinone. Preferred solvents<br>
for step e) include for example petroleum distillates-THF. The reaction<br>
temperature in step e) can be varied depending on the solvent and the<br>
reagents. Suitable temperatures are e.g. 23°C or 70°C.<br><br>
Step f): Dehydration to prepare 1,4,8,11-Tetramethyl-6,13-<br>
pentacenequinone 8<br>
In order to remove the epoxy bridges to form the pentacenequinone 8, bis-<br>
cycloadduct 7 is dehydrated under mildly basic conditions using sodium<br>
acetate in methanol in an similar manner to that reported by Wong et<br>
al. [14] It has been found that, when the reaction is performed in a<br>
microwave-reactor, at temperatures above the boiling point of the solvent<br>
(160°C), high conversion to product can be obtained in short reactions<br>
time (5 mins), as opposed to prolonged reaction times at reflux<br>
temperature. Efforts to carry this dehydration out under acidic conditions<br>
using concentrated sulphuric acid at 0oC[8] and concentrated hydrochloric<br>
acid in refluxing methanol[20] were both unsuccessful.<br>
Preferred reagents for step f) include for example NaOAc. Preferred<br>
solvents for step f) include for example methanol. The reaction<br>
temperature in step f) can be varied depending on the solvent and the<br>
reagents. Suitable temperatures are e.g. 70°C or higher temperatures<br>
Step g) Alkynation and aromatisation to prepare 1,4,8,11-Tetramethyl-<br>
6,13-bis(trialkylsilylethynyl)pentacene 9<br>
Finally, the alkynation of pentacenequinone 8 is performed by reaction<br>
with lithium trialkylsilylacetylide (e.g. wherein alkyl is ethyl), formed in-situ<br>
from trialkylsilylacetylene and n-butyllithium, in an analogous manner to<br>
that described by Anthony and co-workers.[5] The intermediate species is<br>
then treated with an acidified saturated aqueous solution of tin(ll) chloride<br>
to afford the final product material, 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-6,13-<br>
bis(trialkylsilylethynyl) pentacene 9, in an analogous manner to that<br>
described by Anthony and co-workers.[4] Alternatively, arylacetylene<br>
moieties can be introduced into the pentacene species by reaction of<br>
pentacenequinone 8 with lithium arylacetylide, formed in-situ from<br>
arylacetylene and n-butyllithium, in an analogous manner to that<br>
described by Anthony and co-workers.[5]<br>
Preferred reagents for step g) include for example: n-BuLi-<br>
trialkylsilylacetylene (e.g. n-BuLi-triethylsilylacetylene, n-BuLi-<br>
triisopropylacetylene) and n-BuLi-arylacetylene (e.g. n-BuLi-4-alkyl- or<br><br>
alkoxyphenylacetylene , n-BuLi-2,5-dialkyl- or dialkoxyphenylacetylene, n-<br>
BuLi-2,4,5-trialkyl or trialkoxyphenylacetytene, n-BuLi-2,4,6-trialkyl- or<br>
trialkoxyphenylacetylene, n-BuLi-5-alkylthiophenylacetylene, n-BuLi-2,4,5- or<br>
2,4,6-trifluorophenylacetylene), followed by SnCI2-HCI. Preferred solvents for<br>
step g) include for example Et2O, THF, dioxane or mixtures thereof. The<br>
reaction temperature in step g) can be varied depending on the solvent and<br>
the reagents. Suitable temperatures are e.g. 0°C or 23°C.<br>

anhydride 2 to lactone 4 is carried out in one step (a1).<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the oxidation of<br>
diol 3 to lactol 5b is carried out in one step (a3), very preferably using 2-<br>
iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX).[17]<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the dehydration<br>
of bis-cycloadduct 7 (step f) is carried out in a sealed reactor vessel at<br>
elevated temperature and pressure, rather than in a microwave reactor.<br>
The process according to the present invention has been described above<br>
for the preparation of 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-6,13-bis(trialkylsilylethynyl)<br>
pentacene 9. However, it is also possible to prepare other 1,4,8,11-<br>
substituted bis(trialkylethynyl)pentacenes, like those of formula la shown<br>
below, or 1,4,8,11-substituted bis(arylethynyl)-pentacenes, like those of<br>

thin film between a gate dielectric and a drain and a source electrode, are<br>
generally known, and are described for example in US 5,892,244,<br>
WO 00/79617, US 5,998,804, and in the references cited in the<br>
background section. Due to the advantages, like low cost production using<br>
the solubility properties of the polymers according to the invention and<br>
thus the processibility of large surfaces, preferred applications of these<br>
FETs are such as integrated circuitry, TFT displays and security<br>
applications.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a formulation comprising one or<br>
more substituted pentacene compounds as described above and below<br>

The total solids content (i.e. substituted pentacene compound and binder)<br>
in the formulation is preferably from 0.1 to 15% by weight, more preferably<br>
from 0.5 to 10% by weight.<br>
After the appropriate mixing and ageing, solutions are evaluated as one of<br>
the following categories: complete solution, borderline solution or<br>
insoluble. The contour line is drawn to outline the solubility parameter-<br>
hydrogen bonding limits dividing solubility and insolubility. 'Complete'<br>
solvents falling within the solubility area can be chosen from literature<br>
values such as published in "Crowley, J.D., Teague, G.S. Jr and Lowe,<br>
J.W. Jr., Journal of Paint Technology, 38, No 496, 296 (1966)". Solvent<br><br>
blends may also be used and can be identified as described in "Solvents,<br>
W.H.Ellis, Federation of Societies for Coatings Technology, p9-10, 1986".<br>
Such a procedure may lead to a blend of 'non' solvents that will dissolve<br>
both the compounds of the present invention, although it is desirable to<br>
have at least one true solvent in a blend.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention can also be used in<br>
patterned OSC layers in the devices as described above and below. For<br>
applications in modern microelectronics it is generally desirable to<br>
generate small structures or patterns to reduce cost (more devices/unit<br>
area), and power consumption. Patterning of thin layers comprising a<br>
compound according to the present invention can be carried out for<br>
example by photolithography, electron beam lithography or laser<br>
patterning.<br>
For use as thin layers in electronic or electrooptical devices the<br>
compounds and formulations of the present invention may be deposited<br>
by any suitable method. Liquid coating of devices is more desirable than<br>
vacuum deposition techniques. Solution deposition methods are<br>
especially preferred. The formulations of the present invention enable the<br>
use of a number of liquid coating techniques. Preferred deposition<br>
techniques include, without limitation, dip coating, spin coating, ink jet<br>
printing, letter-press printing, screen printing, doctor blade coating, roller<br>
printing, reverse-roller printing, offset lithography printing, flexographic<br>
printing, web printing, spray coating, brush coating or pad printing. Ink-jet<br>
printing is particularly preferred as it allows high resolution layers and<br>
devices to be prepared.<br>
Selected formulations of the present invention may be applied to<br>
prefabricated device substrates by ink jet printing or microdispensing.<br>
Preferably industrial piezoelectric print heads such as but not limited to<br>
those supplied by Aprion, Hitachi-Koki, InkJet Technology, On Target<br>
Technology, Picojet, Spectra, Trident, Xaar may be used to apply the<br>
organic semiconductor layer to a substrate. Additionally semi-industrial<br>
heads such as those manufactured by Brother, Epson, Konica, Seiko<br>
Instruments Toshiba TEC or single nozzle microdispensers such as those<br><br>
produced by Microdrop and Microfab may be used.<br>
In order to be applied by ink jet printing or microdispensing, the<br>
compounds should be first dissolved in a suitable solvent. Solvents must<br>
fulfil the requirements stated above and must not have any detrimental<br>
effect on the chosen print head. Additionally, solvents should have boiling<br>
points &gt;100°C, preferably &gt;140°C and more preferably &gt;150°C in order to<br>
prevent operability problems caused by the solution drying out inside the<br>
print head. Apart from the solvents methoned above, suitable solvents<br>
include substituted and non-substituted xylene derivatives, di-C1-2-alkyl<br>
formamide, substituted and non-substituted anisoles and other phenol-<br>
ether derivatives, substituted heterocycles such as substituted pyridines,<br>
pyrazines, pyrimidines, pyrrolidinones, substituted and non-substituted<br>
N,N-di-C1-2-alkylanilines and other fluorinated or chlorinated aromatics.<br>
A preferred solvent for depositing a compound according to the present<br>
invention by ink jet printing comprises a benzene derivative which has a<br>
benzene ring substituted by one or more substituents wherein the total<br>
number of carbon atoms among the one or more substituents is at least<br>
three. For example, the benzene derivative may be substituted with a<br>
propyl group or three methyl groups, in either case there being at least<br>
three carbon atoms in total. Such a solvent enables an ink jet fluid to be<br>
formed comprising the solvent with the compound, which reduces or<br>
prevents clogging of the jets and separation of the components during<br>
spraying. The solvent(s) may include those selected from the following list<br>
of examples: dodecylbenzene, 1 -methyl-4-tert-butylbenzene, terpineol<br>
limonene, isodurene, terpinolene, cymene, diethylbenzene. The solvent<br>
may be a solvent mixture, that is a combination of two or more solvents,<br>

sequence, provided that the source and drain electrode are separated<br>
from the gate electrode by the insulating layer, the gate electrode and the<br>
semiconductor layer both contact the insulating layer, and the source<br>
electrode and the drain electrode both contact the semiconducting layer.<br>
The OFET device can be a top gate device or a bottom gate device.<br>
Suitable structures and manufacturing methods of an OFET device, and<br>
suitable methods for measuring the device performance are known to the<br>
skilled in the art and are described in the literature, for example in WO<br>
03/052841 A1 and WO 2005/055248 A2.<br>

OFET device according to the present invention, comprising a substrate<br>
(1), a gate electrode (2), a dielectric layer (3), source and drain electrodes<br>

applying a gate electrode (2) on a substrate (1), applying a dielectric layer<br>
(3) on top of the gate electrode (2) and the substrate (1), applying source<br>
and drain electrodes (4) on top of the dielectric layer (3), and applying an<br>

the present invention, comprising a substrate (1), source and drain<br>
electrodes (4), an OSC layer (5), a dielectric layer (3), and a gate<br>

An OPV device according to the present invention preferably comprises:<br>
-	a low work function electrode (for example Aluminum),<br>
-	a high work function electrode (for example ITO), one of which is<br>
transparent,<br>
-	a bilayer of consisting of a hole transporting and an electron<br>
transporting material; the bilayer can exist as two distinct layers, or a<br>
blended mixture (see for example Coakley, K. M. and McGehee, M. D.<br>
Chem. Mater. 2004, 16, 4533),<br>
-	an optional conducting polymer layer (such as for example<br>
PEDOT:PSS) to modify the work function of the high work function<br>
electrode to provide an ohmic contact for the hole,<br>
-	an optional coating on the high workfunction electrode (such as LiF) to<br>
provide an ohmic contact for electrons.<br>
The hole transporting material in the blend exists of one of the compounds<br>
of the present invention. The electron transporting material can be an<br>
inorganic material such as zinc oxide or cadmium selenide, or an organic<br>
material such as a fullerene derivate (for example PCBM, [(6,6)-phenyl<br>
C61-butyric acid methyl ester] or a polymer see for example Coakley, K.<br><br>
M. and McGehee, M. D. Chem. Mater. 2004, 16, 4533). If the bilayer is a<br>
blend an optional annealing step may be necessary to optimize device<br>
performance.<br>
In security applications, OFETs and other devices with semiconducting<br>
materials according to the present invention, like transistors or diodes, can<br>
be used for RFID tags or security markings to authenticate and prevent<br>
counterfeiting of documents of value like banknotes, credit cards or ID<br>
cards, national ID documents, licenses or any product with monetry value,<br>
like stamps, tickets, shares, cheques etc..<br>
Alternatively, the materials according to the invention can be used in<br>
organic light emitting devices or diodes (OLEDs), e.g., in display<br>
applications or as backlight of e.g. liquid crystal displays. Common OLEDs<br>
are realized using multilayer structures. An emission layer is generally<br>
sandwiched between one or more electron-transport and/ or hole-<br>
transport layers. By applying an electric voltage electrons and holes as<br>
charge carriers move towards the emission layer where their<br>
recombination leads to the excitation and hence luminescence of the<br>
lumophor units contained in the emission layer. The inventive compounds,<br>
materials and films may be employed in one or more of the charge<br>
transport layers and/ or in the emission layer, corresponding to their<br>
electrical and/ or optical properties. Furthermore their use within the<br>
emission layer is especially advantageous, if the compounds, materials<br>
and films according to the invention show electroluminescent properties<br>
themselves or comprise electroluminescent groups or compounds. The<br>
selection, characterization as well as the processing of suitable<br>
monomelic, oligomeric and polymeric compounds or materials for the use<br>
in OLEDs is generally known by a person skilled in the art, see, e.g.,<br>
Meerholz, Synthetic Materials, 111-112, 2000, 31-34, Alcala, J. Appl.<br>
Phys., 88, 2000, 7124-7128 and the literature cited therein.<br>
According to another use, the materials according to the present<br>
invention, especially those which show photoluminescent properties, may<br>
be employed as materials of light sources, e.g., of display devices such as<br><br>
described in EP 0 889 350 A1 or by C. Weder et al., Science, 279, 1998,<br>
835-837.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to both the oxidised and reduced<br>
form of the polymers according to this invention. Either loss or gain of<br>
electrons results in formation of a highly delocalised ionic form, which is of<br>
high conductivity. This can occur on exposure to common dopants.<br>
Suitable dopants and methods of doping are known to those skilled in the<br>
art, e.g. from EP 0 528 662, US 5,198,153 or WO 96/21659.<br>
The doping process typically implies treatment of the semiconductor<br>
material with an oxidating or reducing agent in a redox reaction to form<br>
delocalised ionic centres in the material, with the corresponding<br>
counterions derived from the applied dopants. Suitable doping methods<br>
comprise for example exposure to a doping vapor in the atmospheric<br>
pressure or at a reduced pressure, electrochemical doping in a solution<br>
containing a dopant, bringing a dopant into contact with the semiconductor<br>
material to be thermally diffused, and ion-implantantion of the dopant into<br>
the semiconductor material.<br>
When electrons are used as carriers, suitable dopants are for example<br>
halogens (e.g., I2, Cl2, Br2, ICI, ICI3, IBr and IF), Lewis acids (e.g., PF5,<br>
AsFs, SbF5, BF3, BCI3, SbCI, BBr3 and SO3), protonic acids, organic<br>
acids, or amino acids (e.g., HF, HCI, HNO3, H2SO4, HCIO4, FSO3H and<br>
CISO3H), transition metal compounds (e.g., FeCI3, FeOCI, Fe(CIO4)3,<br>
Fe(4-CH3C6H4SO3)3, TiCI4, ZrCI4, HfCI4, NbF5, NbCI5, TaCI5, MoF5, MoCI5,<br>
WF5, WCI6, UF6 and LnCI3 (wherein Ln is a lanthanoid), anions (e.g., Cl-,<br>
Br-, l-, l3-, HSO4-, SO42-, NO3-, CIO4-, BF4-, PF6-, AsF6-, SbF6-, FeCI4-,<br>
Fe(CN)63-, and anions of various sulfonic acids, such as aryl-SCO-). When<br>
holes are used as carriers, examples of dopants are cations (e.g., H+, Li+,<br>
Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+), alkali metals (e.g., Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), alkaline-<br>
earth metals (e.g., Ca, Sr, and Ba), O2, XeOF4, (NO2+) (SbF6), (NO2+)<br>
(SbCI6), (NO2+)(BF4), AgCIO4, H2lrCI6, La(NO3)3 6H2O, FSO2OOSO2F,<br>
Eu, acetylcholine, R4N+, (R is an alkyl group), R4P+ (R is an alkyl group),<br>
R6As+ (R is an alkyl group), and R3S+ (R is an alkyl group).<br><br>
The conducting form of the polymers of the present invention can be used<br>
as an organic "metal" in applications including, but not limited to, charge<br>
injection layers and ITO planarising layers in OLED applications, films for<br>
flat panel displays and touch screens, antistatic films, printed conductive<br>
substrates, patterns or tracts in electronic applications such as printed<br>
circuit boards and condensers.<br>
According to another use, the materials according to the present invention<br>
can be used alone or together with other materials in or as alignment<br>
layers in LCD or OLED devices, as described for example in US<br>
2003/0021913. The use of charge transport compounds according to the<br>
present invention can increase the electrical conductivity of the alignment<br>
layer. When used in an LCD, this increased electrical conductivity can<br>
reduce adverse residual dc effects in the switchable LCD cell and<br>
suppress image sticking or, for example in ferroelectric LCDs, reduce the<br>
residual charge produced by the switching of the spontaneous polarisation<br>
charge of the ferroelectric LCs. When used in an OLED device comprising<br>
a light emitting material provided onto the alignment layer, this increased<br>
electrical conductivity can enhance the electroluminescence of the light<br>
emitting material. The compounds or materials according to the present<br>
invention having mesogenic or liquid crystalline properties can form<br>
oriented anisotropic films as described above, which are especially useful<br>
as alignment layers to induce or enhance alignment in a liquid crystal<br>
medium provided onto said anisotropic film. The materials according to<br>
the present invention may also be combined with photoisomerisable<br>
compounds and/or chromophores for use in or as photoalignment layers,<br>
as described in US 2003/0021913.<br>
According to another use the materials according to the present invention,<br>
especially their water-soluble derivatives (for example with polar or ionic<br>
side groups) or ionically doped forms, can be employed as chemical<br>
sensors or materials for detecting and discriminating DNA sequences.<br>
Such uses are described for example in L. Chen, D. W. McBranch, H.<br>
