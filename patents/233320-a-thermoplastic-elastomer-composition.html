				<td>The present invention relates to a thermoplastic elastomer composition.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention provides an improved thermoplastic elastomer composition having excellent durability and flexibility.  In particular, the present invention relates to a thermoplastic elastomer composition, which is composed of a halogenated isobutylene elastomer dispersed in a polyamide matrix, having limited tensile modulus of the elastomer after vulcanization, that provides excellent low-temperature durability. Background Art<br>
EP722850B1 disclosed a low-permeability thermoplastic elastomer composition that is superior as a gas-barrier layer in pneumatic tires.  This thermoplastic composition comprises a low-permeability thermoplastic matrix, such as polyamides or blends of polyamides, in which a low-permeability rubber, such as brominated poly(isobutylene-co-paramethylstyrene) (i.e., BIMS) is dispersed.  Subsequently, in both EP857761A1 and EP969039A1, viscosity ratio between the thermoplastic matrix and the rubber dispersion was specified as a function of the volume fraction ratio and independently to be close to one in order to achieve phase continuity in thermoplastic and fine rubber dispersions, respectively.  Criticality of smaller rubber dispersions was recognized in EP969039A1 in these thermoplastic elastomers for delivering acceptable durability especially for their usage as innerliners in pneumatic tires.  Also, the BIMS's cure state is desirable between 50% and 95% in EP969039A1. Summary of Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a thermoplastic elastomer composition having excellent<br><br><br>
durability and flexibility.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a thermoplastic elastomer composition comprising a dynamically vulcanized blend of (A) a partially cured halogenated isobutylene elastomer and (B) a polyamide, wherein a tensile modulus at 100% elongation of the halogenated isobutylene elastomer dispersed in the polyamide matrix is less than 0.60 MPa. Disclosure of Invention<br>
In this specification and in the claims which follow, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.<br>
According to the present invention, the improvement in low temperature durability of the low-permeability thermoplastic elastomers is achieved by controlling the tensile modulus at 100% elongation of the dispersed elastomer after vulcanization.  Thus, the present invention relates to dynamically cured elastomer particles dispersed in the polyamide matrix of the thermoplastic elastomer film having excellent low temperature durability.  More particularly, the present invention relates to the partially cured thermoplastic elastomer composition for producing a thermoplastic elastomer film having the tensile modulus at 100% elongation of the dispersed elastomer after vulcanization suitable for use as an air permeation preventive barrier such as an air permeation preventive layer of a pneumatic tire.  The tensile modulus of the dispersed elastomer at 100% elongation is less than 0.60 MPa, preferably 0.59 MPa or less, preferably 0.58 MPa or less, 0.57 MPa or less, preferably 0.56 MPa or less. Tensile modulus at 100% elongation is determined measuring the force modulation AFM according to the test method described in "Maria D. Ellul, et al. ACS Rubber 2001, Cleveland (i.e., Ref-1) then calculating the tensile modulus at 100%.  Ellul, et al. reports the force<br>
modulation in millivolts and then the tensile modulus at 100% elongation must be calculated.<br>
The force modulation is used in conjunction with tapping AFM.  The topology of the sample is first mapped using the tappig mode.  During force modulation, the cantilever tip is lowered by a specified 50 nm from the surface defined by tapping.  The cantilever is then oscillated in its indentation mode at the bimorph resonant frequency of -10 kHz.  During scanning, a constant drive amplitude for the bimorph-driven force modulation is set at 500 mV and response RMS amplitudes of the cantilever are measured. Bimorph driven force modulation is a displacement modulation with reference to the tip holder.  However, without the knowledge of the input tip amplitude (only the drive amplitude for the bimorph is known), the mechanical modulus of the sample cannot be calculated from the response amplitude.  Instead, relative difference in response RMS amplitude between the rubber and Nylon in a given sample are measured for comparison in rubber hardness between samples.<br>
Determination of tensile modulus from force modulation AFM amplitude is as follows.  While the following example is directed to nylon and BIMS, one versed in the art will recognize that this procedure may be used with other thermoplastics and elastomers.  One blend of Nylon and BIMS (brominated copolymer of isobutylene and paramethylstyrene) with BIMS fully cured (through curative saturation and long cure time) are prepared along with one blend of Nylon and BIMS but without any curatives (0% cure).  By examining these two blends using force modulation AFM, a correlation is established between cure state and force modulation AFM amplitude (reported in mV) based on linear correlation assumption. Since tensile moduli of BIMS are known as a function of the cure state, the force modulation amplitude can thus<br>
be converted to 100% BIMS rubber tensile modulus. In the examples, serial and non-serial tensile moduli were averaged together to obtain the final tensile modulus at 100% elongation.<br>
Tensile properties and tensile tests described herein are based on JIS K6251 "Tensile Test Method of Vulcanized Rubber."<br>
The thermoplastic elastomer composition is a blend of a halogenated isobutylene elastomer and a polyamide, which is subjected to dynamic vulcanization, wherein the polyamide is present preferably at 5 to 75 parts by weight, more preferably 10 to 75 parts by weight and the elastomer is present preferably at 95 to 25 parts by weight, more preferably 90 to 25 parts by weight.<br>
The term "dynamic vulcanization" is used herein to connote a vulcanization process in which the engineering resin and a vulcanizable elastomer are vulcanized under conditions of high shear. As a result, the vulcanizable elastomer is simultaneously crosslinked and dispersed as fine particles of a "micro gel" within the engineering resin matrix.<br>
Dynamic vulcanization is effected by mixing the ingredients at a temperature which is at or above the curing temperature of the elastomer in equipment such as roll mills, BanburyÂ® mixers, continuous mixers, kneaders or mixing extruders, e.g., twin screw extruders. The unique characteristic of the dynamically cured compositions is that, notwithstanding the fact that the elastomer component may be fully cured, the compositions can be processed and reprocessed by conventional rubber processing techniques such as extrusion, injections molding , compression molding, etc. scrap or flashing can be salvaged and reprocessed.<br>

Technology, Vol. 10, pages 392-414.<br>
Commercially available thermoplastic polyamides may be advantageously<br>
used in the practice of this invention, with linear crystalline polyamides<br>

The amounts of these additives added may be amounts generally added in the past so long as they do not run counter to the object of the present invention. EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention will now be further illustrated by, but is by no means limited to, the following examples.<br>
The Tapping Phase and Force Modulation AFM procedure was as follows. All specimens were analyzed within 8 hours after cryofacing to prevent specimen relaxation. During cryofacing, the specimens were cooled to -150Â°C and cut with diamond knives in a Reichert cryogenic microtome. They were then stored in a dessicator under flowing dry nitrogen gas to warm up to ambient temperature without condensation being formed. Finally, the faced specimens were mounted in a miniature steel vise for AFM analysis. The AFM measurements were performed in air on a NanoScope Dimension 3000 scanning probe microscope (Digital Instrument) using a rectangular Si cantilever. While the set point ratio is maintained<br><br>
at a value equal to or lower than 0.5, the contact set point was adjusted routinely to ensure repulsive contacts with positive phase shifts.  The cantilever was running at or slightly below its resonance frequency.<br>
The following commercially available products were used for the components employed in the Examples<br>

2.	Elastomer Component<br>
BIMS: Brominated copolymer of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene sold under the trade name EXXPRO 89-4 by ExxonMobil Chemical Company having a mooney viscosity of about 45, approximately 5 weight% para-methylstyrene, and approximately 0.75 mol% bromine<br>

3.	Additives<br>
Plasticizer - N-butylbenzenesulfonamide Antioxidant - Irganox 1098, Tinuvin 622LD, and<br>
Cul<br>
Examples 1-2 and Comparative Example 1 Three blown films having the same composition shown in Table 1 were mixed by a twin screw extruder at a mixing temperature of 230Â°C.  Then, those three blown films having the same composition shown in Table 1 were produced at an extruding temperature of 250Â°C for example 1.2, and Comparative Example 1, using the same blown die.  The tires of Example 1 and 2 were manufactured at 180Â°C.  The tire of Comparative Example 1 was manufactured at 185Â°C.  The cure state of Exxpro 89-4 of the thermoplastic elastomer films are as listed in Table 2.  The films were subjected to a tire field test in Canada during winter season where temperature can reach -20Â°C and below.<br>
According to Ref.-l test method, the of cure state the dispersed elastomer in the thermoplastic elastomer composition was in proportion to the cantilever vibration amplitude length of the Force Modulation AFM measurements.  This means that higher tensile modulus at 100% elongation of the elastomer gives higher cantilever vibration amplitude.<br>
Effect of Invention<br>
Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Example 1 were tested in the same test field (i.e., Canada). As shown in Table 2, if the tensile modulus at 100% elongation is less than 0.60 MPa, there are no cracks occurred in tire. Therefore, the present invention demonstrates that the<br>
desired performance can be obtained by reducing the tensile modulus at 100% elongation to less than 0.60 MPa and, the durability of tire could be improved in a thermoplastic elastomer blown film for the improvement in low temperature durability.<br>
