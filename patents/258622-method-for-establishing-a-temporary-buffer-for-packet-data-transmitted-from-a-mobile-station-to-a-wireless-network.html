FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of mobile radio systems from 2.5<br>
generation, and more precisely to a method for the early establishment of uplink<br>
TBFs. To simplify the disclosure, used acronyms are given at the end of the<br>
description. For the sake of simplicity the only (E)GPRS embodiment of the<br>
invention will be described, but the same conclusions are valid for the other<br>
3GPP systems (UMTS).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig.1 shows the functional architecture of a GSM / EDGE network according to<br>
TS 44.060 V.6.2.0, including the following functional blocks: SGSN, GGSN, EIR,<br>
BSS, MSC/VLR, HLR, SMS-GMSC, SMS-IWMSC, SM-SC and MS. The latter<br>
includes a first functional block TE connected to a second functional block MT<br>
through a connection indicated by a Reference point R, typically supporting a<br>
standard serial interface. The MT block is connected to the Urn interface<br>
supplying packet data services on radio channels. The following interfaces are<br>
foreseen: Urn, Gi, Gp, Gb, Gn, Gp, Gf, Gs, Gr, Gd, D, E, C, whose connectivity<br>
between the relevant blocks are directly visible in the figure. In<br>
particular, the Gn interface connects two GSN nodes in the same PLMN system,<br>
while the Gp interface connects two GSN nodes belonging to different PLMN<br>
systems. The BSS block includes a plurality of BTS connected to a BSC through a<br>
respective Abis interface (fig.2).<br><br>
In operation, at the Um and Abis interfaces several protocols are stacked upon<br>
the physical layer, in particular MAC, RLC, and LLC. RLC gives a reliable radio link<br>
and maps the LLC frames within the physical GSM channel. Signalling procedures<br>
for accessing the radio channel are controlled by MAC, which also governs<br>
dynamic allocation of the resources (request and grant). Dynamic allocation<br>
means that a particular transmission resource, consisting for instance of a PDCH<br>
channel on a physical timeslot, is made time division shareable among more MS<br>
mobiles, each of them being engaged in an active session of data transfer, or<br>
signalling, through the same transmission resource jointly assigned.<br>
The sub-set of MAC procedures governing the dynamic allocation of resources,<br>
provides temporary connections on the physical layer, called TBFs, which include<br>
memory buffers to house the queues of RLC/MAC blocks. Each TBF connection<br>
enables the unidirectional transfer of data and user signalling within a cell<br>
between the network and a mobile station MS, or vice versa. Control messages<br>
for the establishment/abatement of a connection and the allocation/de-allocation<br>
of relevant supported physical resources, for instance of TBF buffers,<br>
contemplate different opportunities capable of covering the whole survey<br>
foreseen in the packet transfer mode of the RR sublayer. For simplicity, it is here<br>
described a very limited survey of establishment/abatement of TBF connections<br>
and of the relevant operation modes. We can start from the establishment of a<br>
TBF uplink connection following a Packet Transfer originated by the mobile. In<br>
this case the mobile requires the assignment of a GPRS channel sending a<br>
PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message including the resources requested for the<br>
transfer of packets to the network. In case of reception, the network replies with<br><br>
a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message on the control channel allocating to<br>
the mobile the resources requested for the uplink transfer of packets. The<br>
resources include one or more PDCH channels and a TFI value.<br>
The network does not assign any buffer in uplink direction (the buffer resides in<br>
the mobile). The network requires simply knowing the number of blocks that a<br>
MS mobile intends to transmit. We can now proceed examining the<br>
establishment of a TBF connection downlink following a Packet Transfer ended<br>
towards the mobile. In this case at the end of the paging procedure, the network<br>
sends the mobile a PACKET DOWNLINK ASSIGNMENT message in the Ready<br>
state on the control channel, with enclosed the list of PDCH channels allocated<br>
for the downlink transfer. A buffer, relevant to the downlink TBF, is purposely<br>
allocated to contain the RLC/MAC blocks to be sent.<br>
In the majority of the cases a TBF is kept alive only for the transfer of one or<br>
more LLC protocol units, to the right purpose of transferring the corresponding<br>
RLC/MAC blocks. The network assigns each TBF connection its own temporary<br>
identifier, called TFi (Temporary Flow Identity). The mobile shall assume that the<br>
TFI value is unique among TBF competitors in each direction, uplink or downlink.<br>
A RLC/MAC data block is identified to the TBF to which it is associated through<br>
its own field where the identifier TFI is written, and another field to indicate the<br>
uplink or downlink direction of the block. Should the RLC/MAC block be referred<br>
to a control message, a field is foreseen to indicate the message transmission<br>
direction and type. In the case of dynamic allocation, the header of<br>
each RLC/MAC block transmitted on a PDCH channel in "downlink" direction<br>
includes an additional field called USF, which is used by the network in the form<br>
of a flag to control the time division multiplexing of different mobile stations on a<br>
physical channel PDCH in uplink direction. We can now better qualify the already<br>
mentioned PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message, sent by the network towards<br>
the mobiles, stating that it includes:<br><br>
the identifier TFI of the downlink/TBF buffer containing the control block carrying<br>
this message, the list of the allocated PDCH channels (time slots), and a<br>
corresponding USF value for each allocated channel. Three bits are foreseen for<br>
the USF field that enable to unambiguously discriminate up to eight users sharing<br>
a time-slot, also in the borderline case in which the single TBF buffer are<br>
associated all the eight time slots of a TOMA frame.<br>
The setup time of a TBF in (E)GPRS system might be in the order of several<br>
hundreds of milliseconds. In the case of an uplink TBF this is due to the<br>
combined effects of the random access procedure, the bring-up time on the A-bis<br>
interface, the round-trip time between the mobile station and the PCU, etc.<br>
For delay sensitive real-time applications a setup time of hundreds of<br>
milliseconds would impair the performance greatly. For instance, this is the case<br>
for applications, or VoIP over cellular.<br>
In 3GPP, TSG GERAN is currently discussing possible enhancements to reduce<br>
latency in the PS domain, including solutions to reduce the initial setup time of a<br>
TBF.<br>
One idea, which has already been discussed in standardization, is the possibility<br>
to enable an "early TBF establishment", i.e. the possibility for a mobile station to<br>
request an uplink TBF even before some actual data is ready for transmission.<br>
If a mobile station is enabled to open an uplink TBF in advance (i.e. before some<br>
actual data is available for transmission), this means that no setup time will be<br>
needed as soon as there is a real need to transmit something in the uplink.<br><br>
Some specific proposals on how to realize this behaviour have already been<br>
presented for standardization: see for instance GP-052038 and GP-052039<br>
(respectively become G2-050396 and G2-050397) on "Phantom TBFs". But such<br>
proposals have some important drawbacks. For instance:<br>
-	they foresee the definition a special TBF type, only needed for this procedure,<br>
adding extra complexity in both the MS and the network;<br>
-	they are linked to the support of multiple TBFs in both the MS and in the<br>
network, thus limiting the general applicability of the solution;<br>
-	they are linked to the early detection of a SIP signalling indication by the MS.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the state of the art described, it is an object of the present invention<br>
to provide an alternative simpler solution that reuses some already available<br>
procedures in the standard and does not have the support of multiple TBFs, nor<br>
any other capability, as a pre-requisite.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention achieves said object by providing a method for establishing an<br>
uplink TBF, as disclosed in claim 1. Additional advantageous features are<br>
described in the dependent claims.<br><br>
The uplink TBF establishing method of the invention includes the following steps:<br>
a)	transmitting by the mobile station to the network a request for the<br>
establishment of an early uplink TBF even if the mobile station has not data to<br>
transmit;<br>
b)	establishing by the network an early uplink TBF to said mobile station;<br>
c)	scheduling by the network permissions, also called USF, to the mobile station<br>
to transmit packet data from said early uplink TBF;<br>
d)	transmitting dummy packets from said early uplink TBF by said mobile station<br>
as the proper USFs are detected and it has not data to transmit;<br>
e)	transmitting available actual packet data from said early uplink TBF by said<br>
mobile station as the proper USFs are detected.<br>
As alternative to send dummy uplink control blocks, the mobile does not transmit<br>
any message if the support of this capability is indicated by the network. Thanks<br>
to the method of the invention the uplink TBF is kept in a sort of stand-by state,<br>
so that when further data needs to be transmitted the MS can immediately<br>
resume the transmission with no need to re-open the TBF passing through the<br>
random access procedure.<br><br>
According to a first embodiment of the invention, the early uplink TBF<br>
establishment information is a relatively new "cause" foreseen in the (EGPRS)<br>
Packet Channel Request message for one-phase access procedure, clarifying the<br>
request the mobile is performing on the (P)RACH is for an "Early TBF<br>
establishment". The specific indication to the BSS that the request being<br>
performed by the mobile station is for an "early TBF establishment" could also be<br>
used by the network to understand that the initial message transmitted by the<br>
mobile station to open the TBF (i.e. the empty LLC frame) doesn't carry any<br>
actual information. In this case the BSS could optionally decide to discard it<br>
locally (i.e. not forward it to the SGSN) therefore avoiding any impact also on the<br>
Gb interface.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the invention, and considering that the<br>
number of combination of bits still available to signal the early uplink TBF<br>
assignment cause in an access burst is very reduced, the early establishment is<br>
now a specific request to start an "extended UL TBF" in the second message of a<br>
two-phase access procedure, i.e. the Packet Resource Request message. Since<br>
this message is conveyed in a proper radio block and not in a short access burst,<br>
adding additional information to it wouldn't be problem at all. It should be noted<br>
that, even though the two-phase access procedure is intrinsically slower than the<br>
one-phase access one, this wouldn't be a problem at all in this case. This<br>
procedure would be used well before the actual need to send data, so that no<br>
extra delays would be added.<br>
The scheduler design imposes the predetermination of such real cases an early<br>
TBF establishment information is requested, such as delay-sensitive scenarios, is<br>
requested.<br><br>
After that, the transmission of dummy control blocks instead of true data upon<br>
the USF scheduling is currently used in the art.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The proposed solution:<br>
•	Does not in introduce any delay at the very instant that incoming data to<br>
transmit become available.<br>
•	Does not introduce additional procedures in the mobile station and in the<br>
network nor new TBFs types.<br>
•	Does not require any capability indicator in the MS Radio Access Capability, nor<br>
to be linked to any other MS capability (e.g. mTBF or other).<br>
•	Does not require the indication of specific network support.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The features of the present invention which are considered to be novel are set<br>
forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention and its advantages<br>
may be understood with reference to the following detailed description of an<br>
embodiment thereof taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings given<br>
for purely non-limiting explanatory purposes and wherein:<br><br>
-	fig.1, already described, shows a GSM-EDGE system;<br>
-	fig.2 shows a BSS block of fig.1 connected to several MS, constituting the<br>
scenario the present invention is implemented within;<br>
-	figures 3 and 4 show two message sequence diagrams of two respective<br>
embodiments of the early uplink TBF establishment method according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The GSM/EGPRS TDMA signal is structured as cyclic multiframes of 52 basic<br>
frames divided into 12 radio blocks plus two T frames used for the<br>
synchronisation and two X idle frames. Each radio block including four basic<br>
frames. The multiframe is used to time multiplex the GPRS and GSM logical<br>
channels. The LLC layer frames are segmented within the radio blocks of the<br>
RLC/MAC layer. Each radio block is transported by four consecutive Normal<br>
bursts of the multiframe. The four Normal bursts have to be intended<br>
as interleaved on four consecutive TDMA 4.615 ms frames. The resources<br>
necessary to the GPRS service foresee an additional number of logical channels<br>
supporting the transfer of radio blocks through the physical Packet Data Channel<br>
(PDCH). GPRS logical channels have names and functional characteristics greatly<br>
faithfully following those of the channels of the traditional GSM, though referred<br>
to packets.<br><br>
Two basic RLC/MAC block structures are used either for data transfer or for<br>
control message transfer. TS 44.060, fig. 10.0a.2.1 shows a structure for EGPRS<br>
data transfer including a RLC/MAC header and a RLC data block 1, optionally<br>
followed by a RLC data block 2. TS 44.060, fig. 10.0a.3.1 shows a structure for<br>
control message transfer including a MAC header and a RLC/MAC control block.<br>
The different components of an RLC/MAC block carrying a GPRS RLC data block<br>
or an RLC/MAC control block shall be assembled sequentially. Each component<br>
consists of an integer number of octets. The assembling of components shall be<br>
performed progressively, starting in octet number 1 of the physical block.<br>
Fig.2 shows a BSS block connected to a plurality of MS blocks. The BSS block<br>
includes a BSC block and some BTS blocks. The BSC block includes in turn a<br>
block called LLC Layer, a Physical Layer block, a TBF MANAGER block, and a<br>
Scheduler block. The BSC is connected to the SGSN block of the Figure through a<br>
Gb interface. The LLC Layer has a bi-directional connection with the TBF<br>
MANAGER that, in turn has a bi-directional connection with the Scheduler block<br>
and with the Physical Layer. The BSC is charged with the majority of the<br>
operations dealing with TBFs, and the exchange of relevant RR messages on the<br>
Abis interface. The LLC Layer sends to the TBF MANAGER the LLC frames for<br>
downlink buffered connections, and receives from the TBF MANAGER<br>
the LLC frames for the uplink connections. The TBF MANAGER sends to the<br>
Physical Layer the RLC/MAC radio blocks with the associated USF multiplexed for<br>
TDMA on each time slot. The Physical Layer sends the TBF Manager the<br>
RLC/MAC radio blocks coming indication of number of radio blocks to transmit for<br>
each DL_TBF connection and UL_TBF connection. The Scheduler, in its turn,<br>
includes a Downlink and an Uplink Scheduler providing the TBF MANAGER with<br>
scheduling information.<br><br>
The purpose of the packet access procedure is to establish a TBF to support the<br>
transfer of upper-layer PDUs in the direction from the mobile station to the<br>
network. Packet access shall be done on PCCCH, as defined in this clause, if a<br>
PCCCH exists. Otherwise, packet access shall be done on CCCH, as defined in<br>
3GPP TS 44.018. The packet access can be done in either one phase (clause<br>
7.1.2) or in two phases (clauses 7.1.2 and 7.1.3).<br>
According to TS 44.060, paragraph 7.1.2, the mobile station shall initiate the one<br>
phase packet access procedure by scheduling the sending of PACKET CHANNEL<br>
REQUEST messages on the PRACH channel corresponding to its PCCCH_GROUP<br>
and simultaneously leaving the packet idle mode. The mobile station shall use<br>
the last access parameters received on PBCCH. The PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST<br>
messages are sent on PRACH and contain an indication (establishment cause) of<br>
the type of access and parameters required to indicate the mobile station's<br>
demand of radio resource (frequency, timeslot, code, etc.). On receipt of a<br>
PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message, the network may assign a radio resource<br>
on one or more PDCHs to be used by the mobile station for the TBF in GPRS TBF<br>
mode. On receipt of an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message, the<br>
network may assign a radio resource on one or more PDCHs to<br>
be used by the mobile station for the TBF in EGPRS TBF mode or GPRS TBF<br>
mode. If the dynamic allocation medium access mode is used, the network shall<br>
include the USF values allocated for PDCHs in the PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT<br>
message.<br><br>
In fig.3, the previous one phase access procedure is modified according to a first<br>
embodiment of the invention aimed to solve the problem of the early<br>
establishment of an uplink TBF. With reference to fig.3, the PACKET CHANNEL<br>
REQUEST message includes an additional establishment cause called "Early<br>
establishment cause" that is linked to those situations the cause is needed, for<br>
example the delay-sensitive real-time applications. The network, after having<br>
allocated the requested PDCH resources to the mobile station, predisposes it to<br>
receive dummy control block from the mobile, station In alternative the network<br>
predisposes it not to receive any messages if the support of this capability is<br>
indicated by the network. To this aim the network schedules the uplink<br>
transmission instants by conveying relevant USF flags in proper downlink<br>
messages, i.e. UPLINK ACK/NACK messages. The mobile station handshakes<br>
DUMMY control blocks to the USFs until an actual packet data is coming from the<br>
application. According to TS 44.060, paragraph 7.1.3, when the TBF is<br>
established using two phase access: in the first phase of a two phase access in a<br>
cell provided with a PCCCH, the same procedures<br>
as for one phase access are used until the network sends a<br>
PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message including a Single Block Allocation<br>
structure or Multi Block Allocation structure, denoting two phase access to the<br>
mobile station. The Multi Block Allocation structure may be used only if the<br>
mobile station has EGPRS capability (i.e. the network received an EGPRS PACKET<br>
CHANNEL REQUEST message from the mobile station). In the PACKET UPLINK<br>
ASSIGNMENT message, the network reserves a limited resource on one PDCH to<br>
the mobile station where the mobile station may transmit a PACKET RESOURCE<br>
REQUEST message and optionally an ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS<br>
CAPABILITIES message.<br><br>
In fig.4 the two phase access procedure is modified according to a second<br>
embodiment of the invention, also aimed to solve the problem of the early<br>
establishment of an uplink TBF. With reference to fig.4, the mobile sends a<br>
PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message to the network, and receives back a<br>
PACKET UPLINK mobile replies to the PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message<br>
with a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message including an Extended uplink TBF<br>
information. The network establishes an Uplink TBF indicating the requesting<br>
mobile station and handshakes USF flags as in the previous fig.3<br>
Although the invention has been described with particular reference to some<br>
preferred embodiments, it will be evident to those skilled in the art, that the<br>
present invention is not limited thereto, but further variations and modifications<br>
may be applied without departing from the scope thereof.<br>

station (MS).<br>
6.	The method as claimed in any of claim 1 to 3, wherein said step a) is<br>
preceded by the following steps of two phase packet access:<br><br>
-	transmitting, by the mobile station (MS), a PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST<br>
message to the network (BSS);<br>
-	transmitting, by the network (BSS), a PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT<br>
message to the mobile station (MS)<br><br>
7.	The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein said request for the establishment<br>
an early uplink TBF is included in a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message.<br>
8.	The method as claimed in any of claim 1 to 7, wherein said mobile station<br>
(MS) instead of transmitting said dummy packets does not transmit any<br>
packets if the support of this capability is indicated by the network.<br><br>
9.	The method as claimed in any of claim 1 to 8, wherein said early uplink TBF<br>
establishment is foreseen for delay-sensitive transmissions.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE "METHOD FOR ESTABLISHING A TEMPORARY BUFFER FOR<br>
PACKET DATA TRANSMITTED FROM A MOBILE STATION TO<br>
A WIRELESS NETWORK"<br>
The invention relates to a method for establishing a temporary buffer,<br>
called TBF, for packet data to be transmitted on a packet data channel<br>
from a mobile station (MS) uplink to a wireless network (BSS) it belongs<br>
to, characterized in that the method comprises the steps of : a)<br>
transmitting by the mobile station (MS) to the network (BSS) a request for<br>
the establishment of an early uplink TBF even if the mobile station has not<br>
data to transmit; b) establishing by the network an early uplink TBF to<br>
said mobile station (MS); c) scheduling by the network (BSS)<br>
permissions, also called USF, to the mobile station (MS) to transmit packet<br>
data from said early uplink TBF; d) transmitting dummy packets from said<br>
early uplink TBF by said mobile station (MS) as the proper USFs are<br>
detected and it has not data to transmit; e) transmitting available actual<br>
packet data from said early uplink TBF by said mobile station (MS) as the<br>
proper USFs are detected.</td>
