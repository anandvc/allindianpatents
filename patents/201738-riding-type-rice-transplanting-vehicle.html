TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
RIDING TYPE RICE TRANSPLANTING VEHICLE FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a riding type rice<br>
transplanting vehicle,  and more particularly to  a<br>
transplanting mechanism provided in a transplanting<br>
machine for performing the transplantation of young<br>
rice plants .<br>
BACKGROUND ART In a conventional riding type rice transplanting vehicle, a transplanting machine is arranged to be movable up and down through an elevating mechanism at a rear portion of a traveling vehicle, a young rice plant tray and a transplanting mechanism are arranged in the transplanting machine, and the young rice plants on the young rice plant tray are transplanted in a field.<br>
Then, in the transplanting mechanism, aluminum die-cast transmission chain cases extending in a back-and-forth direction are mounted at an interval on the right and left sides on a cylindrical pipe-like support frame extending in a widthwise direction on the right and left sides. A PTO shaft coupled to a prime mover of the traveling vehicle is cooperatively coupled to a cooperation shaft received rotatably within the<br>
1<br><br>
support frame. Under the condition that the cooperation shaft extends in the widthwise direction on the right and left sides within the transmission chain cases, the PTO shaft is cooperatively coupled through transmission chains to a transplanting arm shaft received movably. Transplanting arms having transplanting claws  are cooperatively coupled with the transplanting arm shaft. A unit clutch is interposed between the transmission chain and the transplanting arm shaft. The transmission chains and the transplanting arm shaft are switched over between  the  connected  condition  or  the  release condition by means of the unit clutch.<br>
However, in the transplanting mechanism of the above-described conventional riding type rice transplanting machine, since the aluminum die-cast transmission cases are mounted on the support frame and the power transmission is performed through the transmission chains arranged within the transmission chain cases, the structure of the power transmission path becomes complicated. In addition, since the transmission cases are die-cast of aluminum, the manufacturing cost is increased and the weight is increased.<br>
2<br><br>
Published Japanese Patent No.  11-332326 discloses that a transmitting mechanism is arranged in a rear portion of a traveling vehicle body and cooperation shaft are received to be rotatable in right and left extending pipe like frames.<br>
However, though JP 11-332326 has pipe like frames for the transmission casing comprising arranging a transmission pipe on right and left having the desired decreased weight and decreased manufacturing cost, but the assembling work of the unit clutch cannot be enhanced, the unit clutch cannot be downsized, the young rice plants are wasted, and the unit clutch cannot be operated smoothly.<br>
Further, published Japanese Patent No. 61-111615 discloses that a transmitting mechanism is received on the rear end portion of respective drive shaft rotatably within the rear end frame  and said unit  clutches are arranged at the rear end frame.<br>
However, JP 61-111615 has drawbacks wherein the weight .-of the transplanting mechanism cannot be reduced, the manufacturing cost cannot be reduced, the unit clutch cannot be downsized, the young rice plants are wasted, and the unit clutch cannot be operated smoothly.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art transplanting mechanism, simplify its structure  and to reduce its weight thereof.<br>
2A<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a riding type rice transplanting vehicle in which a transplanting machine is arranged in a rear portion of a traveling vehicle body and a transplanting means provided in the transplanting machine is cooperatively coupled with a prime mover provided in the traveling vehicle body, characterized in that:<br>
said transplanting means comprises a transmission casing formed into a pipe frame composed of a plurality of back and forth extending pipe like frames extending back and forth, a right and left extending pipe like frame extending in a widthwise direction on the right and left sides between front end portions of the back and for the extending frame and a pipe like rear end frame extending in the widthwise direction on the right and left sides and formed integrally with a rear end portion of each back and forth extending frame,<br>
front end portions of the drive shafts received rotatably within the respective back and forth extending frames are cooperatively coupled with a cooperation shaft received rotatably within the right and left extending frame transplanting arm shafts received rotatably within the rear end frame are cooperatively coupled with rear end portions of the respective drive shafts through unit clutches and transplanting arms having transplanting claws are cooperatively coupled to the transplanting arm shafts, and<br>
3<br><br>
said unit clutches are arranged at the rear end frame, wherein, in each unit clutch, a transmission gear cooperatively coupled with the drive shaft is loosely fitted with transplanting arm shaft, a clutch working member for performing a clutch operation by bringing the transmission gear and the transplanting arm shaft into a coupled condition or an interrupt condition is arranged slidably along the transplanting arm shaft and a stop member for stopping a drive of a transplanting arm by bringing the transmission gear and the transplanting arm shaft into the interrupt condition while allowing the sliding movement of the clutch working member only in a predetermined angular range of the clutch working member is arranged in the vicinity of the transplanting arm shaft.<br>
Also, the stop member allows the sliding movement of the clutch working member only when a rotational angle of the clutch working member is in an angular range between a rotational angle when the transplanting claw is above a float and a position where young rice plants are picked up by the transplanting claw.<br>
4<br><br>
Also, an engagement recess into which the stop member enters only within the predetermined rotational angle range of the clutch working member is formed in the clutch working member, and an end portion of the engagement recess is slanted.<br>
The transmission casing of the transplanting mechanism is formed into a pipe frame composed of a plurality of back-and-forth extending pipe-like frames extending back and forth, the right and left extending pipe-like frame extending in the widthwise direction on the right and left sides between the front end portions of the back-and-forth extending frame, and the pipe-like rear end frame extending in the widthwise direction on the right and left sides and formed integrally with the rear end portion of each back-and-forth extending frame.<br>
For this reason, it is possible to reduce the weight of the transplanting mechanism and to enhance the assembling work to reduce the manufacturing cost. Moreover, since the front endportions of the drive shafts received rotatably within the respective back-and-forth extending frames are cooperatively coupled with the cooperation shaft received rotatably within the right and left extending frame, at the same time, the transplanting arm shafts received rotatably<br>
5<br><br>
witthin the rear end frame are cooperatively coupled with the rear end portions of the respective drive shafts through unit clutches, and the transplanting arms having the transplanting claws are cooperatively coupled to the transplanting arm shafts , it is possible to simplify the power transmission structure of the transplanting mechanism. Also, thereby, it is possible to reduce the size and weight of the transplanting mechanism and to reduce the manufacturing cost.<br>
Furthermore, each unit clutch is arranged in the rear end frame to thereby enhance the assembling property of the unit clutch.<br>
In  each  unit  clutch,   a  transmission  gear cooperatively coupled with the drive shaft is loosely fitted with transplanting arm shaft, a clutch working member for performing a clutch operation by bringing the transmission gear and the transplanting arm shaft into a coupled condition or an interrupt condition is arranged slidably along the transplanting arm shaft, and  a  stop  member  for  stropping  a  drive  of  a transplanting arm by bringing the transmission gear and the  transplanting  arm  shaft  into  the  interrupt condition while allowing the sliding movement of the clutch working member only in a predetermined angular range of the clutch working member is arranged in the<br>
6<br><br>
vicinity of the transplanting arm shaft.<br>
For this reason, it is possible to miniaturize the unit clutch as much as possible.<br>
In addition, the stop member allows the sliding movement of the clutch working member only when a rotational angle of the clutch working member is in an angular range between a rotational angle when the transplanting claw is above a float and a position where young rice plants are picked up by the transplanting claw. Accordingly, in the case where the unit clutch works, there is no fear that the tip end portion of the transplanting claw is stopped in the position below the float,  and it is possible to avoid a fear that the transplanting claw would be brought into abutment with the field surface or road surface. Also, there is no fear that the transplanting claw is stopped while holding the young rice plants. The young rice plants are not wasted.<br>
Also, an engagement recess into which the stop member enters only within the predetermined rotational angle range of the clutch working member is formed in the clutch working member, and an end portion of the engagement recess is slanted. Accordingly, the stop member is smoothly inserted into the engagement recess of the clutch working member that is rotating. It is<br>
7<br><br>
possible to smoothly operate the unit clutch.<br><br>

13<br><br>
cylinder (not shown) to move the transplanting machine 3 up and down.<br>
In the transplanting mechanism 53, as shown in Fig 3 and 10 a pipe frame-like transmission casing 65 is composed<br>
of three back-and-forth extending frames 57, 58 and 59 provided at an interval in the widthwise direction on the right and left sides and extending in the back-and-forth direction, two pipe-like right and left extending frame 60 and 61 extending in the widthwise direction on the right and left sides between front end portions of the back-and-forth extending frames 57, 58 and 59, pipe-like rear end frames 62, 63 and 64 extending in the widthwise direction on the right and left sides and integrally formed at the rear end portions of the respective back-and-forth extending frames 57, 58 and 59. In the drawing, numeral 66 denotes hollow joint member interposed between the back-and-forth extending frames 57, 58 and 59 and the right and left extending frames 60 and 61.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, since the transmission casing 65 of the transplanting mechanism 53 is formed into a pipe frame, it is possible to reduce the weight and cost of the transplanting mechanism 53.<br>
Also, in the transplanting mechanism 53, drive shafts 57, 5 8 and 59 are received rotatably in the<br>
14<br><br>
back-and-forth extending frames 57, 58 and 59, respectively. Cooperation shafts 70 and 71 are received to be rotatable in right and left extending frames 60 and 61, respectively. Furthermore, transplanting arm<br>
shafts 72, 73 and 74 are received as shown in Fig 4 to be rotatable in the rear end frames 62, 63 and 64, respectively. The central drive shaft 68 is cooperatively coupled with the PTO output shaft 49. The front end portions of the drive shafts 67, 68 and 69 are cooperatively coupled with each other by means of the cooperation shafts 70 and 71. The transplanting shafts 72, 73 and 74 are cooperatively coupled through unit clutches 75, 76 and 77 to the rear end portions of the respective drive shafts 67, 68 and 69. In the drawing, numeral 78 denotes a lateral feeding mechanism for reciprocally moving the young rice tray 47 in the widthwise direction on the right and left sides.<br>
Thus, since the drive shafts 67, 68 and 69, the cooperation shafts 70 and 71 and the transplanting arm shafts 72, 73 and 74 are cooperatively connected within the pipe frame-like transmission casing 65, it is possible to simplify the power transmission structure of the transplanting mechanism 53 and it is possible to reduce the weight and size of the transplanting mechanism 53 and to reduce the manufacturing cost.<br>
15<br><br><br>
In particular, the unit clutches 75, 76 and 77 are arranged in the interior of the respective rear end frames 62, 63 and 64, it is possible to enhance the assembling workability of the unit clutches 75, 76 and 77 .<br>
The respective transplanting arm shafts 72, 73 and 74 are cooperatively coupled through front side cranks 81 to the intermediate portions of transplanting arms 80 having transplanting claws 79. The rear end portions of the transplanting arms 80 are coupled through rear cranks 83 to the rear end portions of support members 82 mounted on upper portions of the rear end frames 62, 63 and 64.<br>
Each unit clutch 75, 76, 77 has the same structure. The structure of the left side unit clutch 75 will now be described. As shown in Figs. 5 to 7, in the unit clutch 75, a transmission gear {bevel gear) 84 cooperatively coupled with the drive shaft 67 is loosely fitted in the transplanting arm 72. A clutch working member 85 for performing the clutch operation by the engagement or the disengagement of the transmission gear 84 and the transplanting arm shaft 72 is arranged to be slidable along the transplanting arm shaft 72. The clutch working member 85 and the transplanting arm shaft 72 are cooperatively coupled with each other through a spline<br>
16<br><br>
engagement. In the drawings, numeral 86 denotes a spline groove, numeral 87 denotes a biasing spring for biasing the clutch working member 85 toward the transmission gear 84, numeral 93 denotes bearings, numeral 94 denotes a bevel gear and numeral 95 denotes a shaft support member.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 8, in the transmission gear 84, a slanted toothed surface 89 is formed at an end portion of a gear body 88. Two engagement portions 90 formed by cutting parts of the gear surface 89 into recesses along the axis of the gear body 88 are formed at an interval in the circumferential direction.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 9, in the clutch working member 85, two clutch claws 92 projected along the axis of the operating member body 91 at the end portion of the cylindrical operating member body 91 are formed at an interval in the circumferential direction.<br>
Then, the clutch working member 85 is biased toward the transmission gear 8 4 by the biasing force of the biasing spring 87. In the case where the clutch claws 92 of the clutch working member 85 are engaged with the engagement portions 90 of the transmission gear 84, the transmission gear 84 and the transplanting arm shaft 72 are in engagement with each other. On the other hand, in the case where the clutch working member 85 is moved<br>
17<br><br>
against the biasing force of the biasing spring 87 in a direction away from the transmission gear 84 and the clutch claws 92 of the clutch working member 85 and the engagement portions 90 of the transmission gear 84 are disengaged from each other, the transmission gear 84 and the transplanting arm shaft 72 are out of engagement with each other.<br>
In this embodiment, thus, since the engagement portions 90 in which the clutch claws 92 of the clutch working member 85 are engaged with the parts of the toothed surface 89 of the transmission gear 84 are formed integrally with the transmission gear 84, it is unnecessary to separately form the members for engaging with the clutch claws 92 of the clutch working member 85 to thereby reduce the number of the mechanical parts and to reduce the weight and size of the unit clutches 75, 76 and 77.<br>
In addition, in this embodiment, since the engagement portions 90 are formed in recesses to the toothed surface 89 of the transmission gear 84, it is possible to make the transmission gear 8 4 by casting with high precision and at the same time to also mold the engagement portions 90 to thereby form the engagement portions 90 with ease and to thereby reduce the cost of the manufacturing cost.<br>
18<br><br>
Also, as shown in Figs.4 to 7, in the unit clutch 75, openings 96 and 97 are formed by bulging at the front end and the rear end of the rear end frame 62. The rear end portion of the back-and-forth extending frame 57 is fitted into and coupled with the front side opening 96. A disc-like cover member 98 covers the rear side opening 97. Furthermore, an opening 99 is formed by bulging also in the upper portion of the rear end frame 62. A clutch operating member support member 101 for supporting a clutch operating member 100 for engagement/disengagement of the unit clutch 75 is mounted in the opening 99.<br>
In the clutch operating member support member 101, a cylindrical fitting portion 102 is formed in the lower portion. The fitting portion 102 is fitted in the opening 99 of the upper portion of the rear end frame 62. The clutch operating member support member 101 is mounted on the upper portion of the rear end frame 62 by means of fastening bolts 104. The cylindrical clutch operating member 100 is mounted in a through hole. 105 passing from above to below to be rotatably. Numeral 112 denotes a packing.<br>
Thus, since the opening 99 is formed in the upper portion of the rear end frame 62, and the clutch operating member support member 101 for supporting the<br>
19<br><br>
clutch operating member 100 is mounted in the opening 99, it is possible to assemble the clutch operating support member 101 on which the clutch operating member 100 is mounted after the assembling to the rear end frame 62 the transplanting arm shaft 7 2 on which the transmission gear 84 and the clutch working member 85 are mounted.<br>
In addition, it is possible to effect the maintenance work for the parts constituting the unit clutch 75 such as transmission gear 84, clutch working member 85, transplanting arm shaft 72 or the like simply by removing the clutch operating member support member 101. Thus, it is possible to enhance the maintenance property of the unit clutch 75.<br>
In particular, since the fitting portion 102 of the clutch operating member support member 101 is fitted in the opening 99 formed by bulging so that the clutch operating member support member 101 is mounted in the opening 99 of the rear frame 62, it is possible to enhance the assembling precision. Also, the assembling wor.k is effected without using oil or the like, it is possible to enhance the maintenance property.<br>
In the clutch operating member 100, an operating claw 106 is formed in the lower end portion. The operating claw 106 is engaged with a flanged portion<br>
20<br><br>
107 of the clutch working member 85. A clutch operating lever 108 is mounted on the upper end portion. In the drawings, numeral 109 denotes a biasing spring, numeral<br>
110	denotes a biasing spring fastening screw and numeral<br>
111	denotes an adjust plate.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, each clutch operating member 100 is cooperatively coupled with an operating lever (not shown) arranged on the back side surface of the young rice plant tray 47 through a clutch operating wire 118, 119, 120. An outer receiver 121, 122, 123 of each clutch operating wire 118, 119, 120 is mounted on each back-and- forth extending frame 57, 58, 5 9 so that each operating wire 118,  119,  120 is mounted along each back-and-forth extending frame 57,  58,  59 and each clutch operating wire 118, 119, 120 is not brought into contact  with  the  transplanting  arm  80  and  the back-and-forth side cranks 81 and 83 that are rotating, the lateral feed mechanism 78 and the young rice plant tray 47 that are moving on the right and left side, or the like.<br>
Then, when the clutch operating member 100 is rotated by using the clutch operating lever 108, the operating claw 106 depresses the flanged portion 107 of the clutch working member 85 and the clutch working member 85 is moved against the biasing force of the<br>
21<br><br>
biasing spring 87 in the direction away from the transmission gear 84 . As a result, the engagement between the clutch claws 92 of the clutch working member 85 and the engagement portions 90 of the transmission gear 84 is released to bring the transmission gear 84 and the transplanting arm shaft 7 2 into the release condition.<br>
Also, in the clutch operating member support member 101, a stop member 113 by which the clutch working member 85 is allowed to slide along the transplanting arm shaft 7 only within a predetermined angular range of the clutch working member 85 to thereby bring the transmission gear 84 and the transplanting arm shaft 72 into the interrupt condition to stop the drive of the transplanting arm 80 is mounted close to the transplanting arm shaft 72.<br>
Namely, the stop member 113 is threadedly engaged toward the transplanting arm shaft 72 on the lower surface of the fitting portion 102 of the clutch operating member support member 101 and in a position just above the transplanting arm shaft 72. An engagement recess 114, into which the stop member 113 enters, is formed to extend in the circumferential direction in the end face of the clutch working member 85. Both ends 115 and 116 of the engagement recess 114 are formed<br>
22<br><br>
obliquely.<br>
Then, in the case where the stop member 113 may fit in the engagement recess 114 of the clutch working member 85, i.e., in the case where the clutch working member 85 is in the predetermined angular range, when the clutch operating member 100 is rotated by using the clutch operating lever 108, the stop member 113 is introduced into the engagement recess 114 of the clutch working member 85 and the clutch working member 85 is moved along the transplanting arm shaft 72. On the other hand, in the case where the stop member 113 could not fit in the engagement recess 114 of the clutch working member 85, i.e., in the case where the clutch working member 85 is out of the predetermined angular range, even when the clutch operating member 100 is rotated by using the clutch operating lever 108, the stop member 113 is in abutment with the end face 117 of the clutch working member 85 and the clutch working member 85 is prevented from being moved.<br>
As shown in Fig 4, 5 and 10, the predetermined angular range of the clutch working member 85 is set to a rotational angle range between a rotational angle when the tip end of the transplanting claw 79 is positioned above the float 48 and a rotational angle at a position where the transplanting claw 79 picks up young rice<br>
23<br><br>
plants from the young rice plant tray 47.<br>
Thus, in this embodiment, since the stop member 113 is provided in the unit clutch 75, and the clutch working member  85  is  allowed  to  slide  along  the transplanting arm shaft 72 only between the rotational angle when the tip end of the transplanting claw 79 is positioned above the float 48 and the rotational angle at the position where the transplanting claw 79 picks up young rice plants by the action of the stop member 113, in the case where the unit clutch 75 works, there is no fear that the tip end portion of the transplanting claw 79 is stopped in the position below the float 48, and it is possible to avoid a fear that the transplanting claw 79 would be brought into abutment with the field  surface or road surface. Also, there is no fear that the transplanting claw 79 is stopped while holding the young rice plants. The young rice plants are not wasted.<br>
In addition, since the stop member 113 is arranged in the vicinity of the transplanting arm shaft 72, it is possible to miniaturize the unit clutch 75 as much as possible.<br>
In particular, since the stop member 113 is mounted on the clutch operating member supporting member 101, the clutch operating member 100 and the stop member 113 are mounted on the same member (clutch operating member<br>
24<br><br>
support member 101) to thereby enhance the positional precision between both components and to make it possible to perform the smooth clutch operation by means of the clutch operating member 100.<br>
Also, in this embodiment/ since both end portions 115 and 116 of the engagement recess 114 provided in the clutch working member 85 are slanted, the stop member 113,13 smoothly inserted into the engagement recess 114 of the clutch working member 85 that is rotating. It is possible to smoothly operate the unit clutch 75.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION<br>

formed into a pipe frame composed of a plurality of<br>
back-and-forth extending pipe-like frames extending<br>
back and forth, the right and left extending pipe-like<br>
frame extending in the widthwise direction on the right<br>
and left sides-between the front end portions of the<br>
back-and-forth extending frame, and the pipe-like rear<br>
end frame extending in the widthwise direction on the<br>
right and left sides and formed integrally with the rear<br>
end portion of each back-and-forth extending frame, it<br>
is possible to reduce the weight of the transplanting<br>
25<br><br>
mechanism and to enhance the assembling work to reduce the manufacturing cost.<br>
Moreover, since the front end portions of the drive shafts  received  rotatably  within  the  respective back-and-forth  extending  frames  are  cooperatively coupled with the cooperation shaft received rotatably within the right and left extending frame, at the same time, the transplanting arm shafts received rotatably within the rear end frame are cooperatively coupled with the rear end portions of the respective drive shafts through unit clutches,  and the transplanting arms having  the  transplanting  claws  are  cooperatively coupled to the transplanting arm shafts , it is possible to simplify the power transmission structure of the transplanting mechanism. Also, thereby, it is possible to reduce the size and weight of the transplanting mechanism and to reduce the manufacturing cost.<br>
Furthermore, each unit clutch is arranged in the rear end frame to thereby enhance the assembling property of the unit clutch.<br>
In particular,  since  in each unit  clutch,  a transmission gear cooperatively coupled with the drive shaft is loosely fitted with transplanting arm shaft, a  clutch  working  member  for  performing  a  clutch operation by bringing the transmission gear and the<br>
26<br><br>
transplanting arm shaft into a coupled condition or an interrupt condition is arranged slidably along the transplanting arm shaft, and a stop member for stropping a drive of a transplanting arm by bringing the transmission gear and the transplanting arm shaft into the interrupt condition while allowing the sliding movement of the clutch working member only in a predetermined angular range of the clutch working member is arranged in the vicinity of the transplanting arm shaft, it is possible to miniaturize the unit clutch as much as possible.<br>
In addition, the stop member allows the sliding movement of the clutch working member only when a rotational angle of the clutch working member is in an angular range between a rotational angle when the transplanting claw is above a float and a position where young rice plants are picked up by the transplanting claw. Accordingly, in the case where the unit clutch works, there is no fear that the tip end portion of the transplanting claw is stopped in the position below the float, and it is possible to avoid a fear that the transplanting claw would be brought into abutment with the field surface or road surface. Also, there is no fear that the transplanting claw is stopped while holding the young rice plants. The young rice plants<br>
27<br><br>
are not wasted.<br>
Also, an engagement recess into which the stop member enters only within the predetermined rotational angle range of the clutch working member is formed in the clutch working member, and an end portion of the engagement recess is slanted. Accordingly, the stop member is smoothly inserted into the engagement recess of the clutch working member that is rotating. It is possible to smoothly operate the unit clutch.<br>
