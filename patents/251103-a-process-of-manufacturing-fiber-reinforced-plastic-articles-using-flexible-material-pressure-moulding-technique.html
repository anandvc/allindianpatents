				<td>"A METHOD OF PREPARING FIBER REINFORCED PLASTIC ARTICLES USING RUBBER PRESSURE MOULDING<br>
TECHNIQUE" Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) article, a method for their preparation and its evaluation for structural applications through the measurement of inter laminar fracture toughness, inter laminar shear strength, tension strength, % of voids, % of fibers, etc. This technique is based on the matching die set, where the die is made from mild steel and the punch from flexible rubber material to apply pressure on the various surfaces of a complex shaped product. The novelty of the this invention is to prepare complex shaped FRP articles without affecting the final FRP article.<br>
Prior Art<br>
FRP articles (sometimes referred as components) have attracted increased attention over the past several years in a variety of fields including space craft, aerospace, automobile, civil, daily life, etc due to their light weight and very good mechanical properties. Such FRP articles have been prepared by pressure bag moulding, vacuum bag moulding, hand lay-up, spray up, hot press moulding, cold press moulding, etc. In these FRP articles, the fiber or fabric is distributed throughout the host matrix. Generally the host matrix is polyester/epoxy resin. But controlling the uniform distribution of fiber/fabric is difficult. Moreover the other disadvantages like microcracking of matrix, breaking of fibers, delamination, debonding, voids, etc. observed in the conventional fabrication technique is not desirable to improve the mechanical properties of FRP articles. The rubber mould through the utilization of hydrostatic pressure (developed during the compression of rubber mould) helps to reduce the microcracking of matrix, breaking of fibers, delamination, debonding, voids, etc in the FRP articles.<br>
But in order to produce high quality, high precession moulding for the aerospace industries, for example, it is necessary to have strict control over fiber alignment and consolidation of fiber in the matrix. Recently, there has been considerably interest in developing new process for the fabrication of FRP articles to improve the mechanical properties of the composite materials. To achieve this an autoclave moulding technique<br><br>
is used using prepreg, porous release material, bleeder material, nonporous release material, breather material and vacuum bag as shown in Figure 1. This type of approach, unfortunately, has limited usefulness. Indeed, a more direct, simple and economic approach to prepare FRP articles is highly desirable. Again the knowledge about fabrication of fiber reinforced plastic articles exited since 1970. However, the curing reaction, the effect of substrates on curing reaction, right grade of resin, curatives, and substrates are not known. As a result it was difficult to fabricate fiber reinforced plastic articles with strict quality control without using porous release material, bleeder material, nonporous release material, and breather material.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Figure 1: Conventional process for fabrication of fiber reinforced plastic articles<br>
Development of new FRP articles having a minimum/free microcracking of matrix, breaking of fibers, delamination, debonding, voids, etc through out the matrix is desirable. Defects free FRP article provide a very good mechanical properties. In order to maintain its impact of composite materials and take the leadership in the world market of composite material, India has to break away from its traditional techniques to introduce new technology. Here a new technique is developed known as rubber pressure moulding. The potential benefits of such new technology are pervasive in technologies including space craft, automobile, aerospace, material and manufacturing, etc. However, past attempts to develop such process have been largely unsuccessful. Novelty<br>
The aerospace and automobile industries use costly bagging materials like porous release material, bleeder material, nonporous release material, breather material, flexible sheet and auto clave to fabricate fiber reinforced plastic articles. These bagging materials cannot be reused, which ultimately increases the cost of fiber reinforced plastic articles.<br>
Keeping this in mind, a new process has been developed, where we don't need to use porous release material, bleeder material, nonporous release material and breather material. Also the new technique does not require an autoclave, which is costly<br><br>
equipment. Even this new technology gives better mechanical properties than those of the conventional method. This new technology can also be used to produce a fiber reinforced plastic component (FRP) having complicated curved surface i.e., complex geometry.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to develop a process for manufacturing fiber reinforced plastic articles (FRP) which overcome the disadvantages like microcracking of matrix, breaking of fibers, delamination, debonding, etc associated with conventional processes.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for manufacturing FRP products having complicated geometry.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for manufacturing FRP products using a metal die and a flexible rubber punch to fabricate FRP articles, which enables the application of nearly hydrostatic pressure on the article during curing of perform.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to adapt a new technique, named as the rubber pressure molding to fabricate fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) products from glass fiber fabric and polyester /epoxy resin<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a process for manufacturing flexible rubber punch for the production of FRP products.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a technique, named as the rubber pressure molding, has been developed to fabricate fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) products from glass fiber fabric and polyester /epoxy resin. The technique is based on matching die set, where the die is made from mild steel and the punch from flexible rubber material to apply pressure on the various surfaces of a complex shaped product. This new technique is successfully tested to fabricate FRP articles having complex geometry generally used for aerospace and automobile industries. A rubber punch die set (RPDS) is designed and fabricated to cast a rubber punch.<br>
The various rubber materials are tested to select appropriate materials. Five varieties of rubber materials i.e., natural rubber, butyl rubber, silicone rubber, styrene butadiene rubber and polybutadiene rubber are used to prepare rubber punch. Polyester resin does not cure with any of the natural rubber, silicone rubber and polybutadiene<br><br>
rubber, but partially cures in presence of styrene butadiene and butyl rubber. Epoxy resin cures well with natural rubber, butyl rubber, silicone rubber and styrene butadiene rubber. And it partially cures in presence of polybutadiene rubber.<br>
The present invention uses various types of coating agent are applied on the rubber surface to cure the polyester resin. These are polytetrafluoro ethylene, polyvinyl alcohol, silicone emulsion and soap solution. Using this new technique a FRP product named as flanged cone, is made from glass fiber using various rubber punches.<br>
The invention also provides composition used for preparing rubber punch, said composition includes, natural rubber, butyl rubber, silicone rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, polybutadiene rubber, zinc oxide, stearic acid, carbon black (GPF), paraffinic process oil, sulfur, mercaptobenzthiazole, BLN (antioxidant), and TMQ (antioxidant).<br>
Inter laminar fracture test, tension test and inter laminar shear test have been conducted on appropriately designed specimens to characterize the products fabricated by the rubber pressure molding technique and conventional process.<br>
The present invention also discloses, a comparison between the conventional process and rubber pressure moulding technique to evaluate its performance in target application.<br>

Before making FRP articles it is necessary to check the curing properties of resins with the surface of the rubber mould for better surface finish and good quality of FRP products. Cured/uncured mixed rubber compound is a mixture of several rubber chemicals. To find out the behavior of the rubber chemicals with polyester/epoxy resin, all rubber chemicals like zinc oxide, stearic acid, carbon black (GPF), paraffinic process oil, sulfur, mercaptobenzthiazole, BLN (antioxidant), and TMQ (antioxidant) are poured separately into the mould cavity. The mould consists of 15 number of steel cylindrical tubes with an internal diameter of 35 mm, thickness of 3 mm and length of 15 mm. Polyester resin poured over the testing surface is mixed with the catalyst (benzole peroxide) and hardener (methyl ethyl ketone). The weight ratio of polyester resin, catalyst and hardener is 100:2:2. Similarly the epoxy resin is mixed with the hardener (PH 861) with a weight ratio of 100:10. The set up is kept at ambient temperature and pressure for 24 hours to check their curing behavior. The results are given in Tables 1 and 2. Both polyester and epoxy resin cures with zinc oxide, stearic acid, carbon black (GPF), paraffinic process oil, sulfur, mercaptobenzthiazole, BLN (antioxidant), and TMQ (antioxidant).<br>

Then the raw rubbers are evaluated to understand the compatibility between polyester/epoxy resin and raw rubbers. The green rubbers (without rubber chemicals) are cut in the shape of a square of size 50 X 50 mm and kept in the mould used in the previous section. On the top of the surface, catalyst mixed polyester (The weight ratio of polyester resin, catalyst and hardener is 100:2:2.) and epoxy resin (The epoxy resin is mixed with the hardener (PH 861) with a weight ratio of 100:10) are poured. Similarly the set up is kept at ambient temperature and pressure for 24 hours to check their curing behavior. The results are given in Table 3.

paraffinic process oil, 11.1 gm sulfur and 7.4 gm mercaptobenzthiazole are mixed in 370 gm butyl rubber at a temperature of 70°C, mixing time of 40 minutes and friction ratio of 1:1.1 in a two roll mixing mill. The split steel die is preheated before putting mixed rubber in it. The preheating is done in a hydraulic press at a temperature of 160°C. After<br><br>
temperature is reached close to 160°C, uncured rubber is filled in the die and the steel cone is placed over it. A nut and bolt system is placed inside the rubber punch for easy removal of the article from the rubber punch after curing of preform. The pressure is 5 MPa. The temperature and pressure is maintained for 30 minutes. The cured rubber punch is taken out by removing bolts on the metal plate of die. Now a hand lay-up technique is used to prepare the preform (uncured form of product). The glass fabric is cut in right shape using the template 1 from a woven glass fiber sheet. The template is designed in such way that the uncut portion covers cylindrical portion of the product and the cut portion covers the conical and base portion of the product. The conical and base of the product does not give continuous laying, so template 2 and template 3 are inserted in conical and base portion after every two layers of template 1. The matrix used to prepare the product is epoxy/polyester resin. The epoxy resin is mixed with 10% of hardener (PH861) to cure the resin. The weight ratio of polyester resin, catalyst (benzole peroxide) and hardener (methyl ethyl ketone) is 100:2:2 to make the FRP article using polyester resin. Total numbers of template 1, template 2 and template 3 used to prepare the preform are 4, 2, and 2 respectively. Coating agent like polytetrafluoro ethylene/ polyvinyl alcohol/ silicone emulsion/ soap solution is applied on the rubber punch. Using hand lay-up technique the glass fabric and the catalyst mixed epoxy/polyester resin are placed on the coated rubber punch, then the rubber punch with preform is placed inside the split steel die and four bolts of the die set is bolted till the two portion of the split die touches each other. Then, steel cone is placed over the rubber punch. The steel die and the rubber punch with preform are loaded in a hydraulic press. The pressure cycle used in the hydraulic press is 0.4 MPa and the preform is allowed to cure at room temperature for 16 hours. The steel die is separated in to two parts by removing the bolts after curing of preform. To take out the product from the rubber punch, a Ml2 bolt is placed on the Ml2 nut inside the rubber punch and screwed slowly to take out the product from the rubber punch. The purpose of placing the nut and a steel plate inside the rubber punch to take out the product easily with out hammering the rubber and the FRP product. Burn test, coin test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical tests like interlaminar fracture toughness, inter laminar shear test, tension test, etc are carried out to know the void content, presence of delamination, bonding between fiber and resin, microstructure and performance of the composite materials.<br><br>
Coin Test: This test gives an idea of delamination in the FRP products. The delamination is checked while tapping a coin on the FRP product. If the sound is like that of a metal i.e., high frequency, it ensures the good quality of product. Otherwise delamination or high void content may be present in the product. The coin test in the FRP product (pump cap) is found to be high frequency in all the three parts (cylindrical, conical, and flat surface).<br>
Burn Test: In burn test, volume fraction of the fiber, matrix and void contents are calculated. This test has been conducted for cylindrical, conical and flat part of the FRP pump cap. Procedure to conduct the burn test is as follows: (1) A specimen of size 10X10 mm is cut from the product. (2) The specimen is cleaned and dried to remove unwanted material from the specimen, and then the specimen is weighted in air and water to determine the specific gravity of the composite materials. (3) It is kept in a furnace and the furnace temperature is gradually increased to 1000°C to burn out resin completely. It is hold at 1000°C for 20 minutes and furnace is switched off. The residue is taken out, when it is cooled to room temperature and its weight is taken, which gives the weight of the fiber. The volume fractions of fiber, matrix and void content in the specimens are calculated from the specific gravity of the composite specimen, weight of the fiber, density of resin and density of fiber. The following equations are used to determine volume fraction of fiber and void content in the composite specimen.<br>
Density of the composite specimen, pc is given by<br>
where, pw, ma and mw are density of water, weight of specimen in air and weight of the specimen in water respectively. Weight of the fiber (mf) and the matrix (mm) are obtained after burning the specimen. Volume fraction of the fiber (Vf) and void content (Vv) are given by<br><br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where, Pf  pct and pce are density of the fiber, theoretical and experimental density of the specimen respectively.<br><br>
Theoretical density of composite is given by<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Five specimens are cut from each sections of pump cap, i.e. cylindrical, conical and flat surfaces and burn test is conducted to find out volume fraction of fiber and void contents.<br>
Scanning Electron Microscopy: Studies for wetting characteristics, delamination and fiber matrix interaction are done by JSM-840 Scanning Electron microscope, JEOL, JAPAN. The specimens of size 10X10 mm are cut from the product and the edges having fiber cross-section are smoothened by a waterproof emery paper. Then, the edge is polished by a powder, 0.3 micron alpha alumina.<br>
Inter laminar Fracture Toughness: The double cantilever beam (DCB) specimen is prepared by 12 layers of bi-directional glass fiber. The thickness of laminate is 4 mm. A precarck is introduced in the laminate by inserting a thin sheet of BOPP (biaxially oriented polypropylene) film at the mid plane of the laminate during the stacking of glass fiber fabric. The BOPP film is kept at one end in the mid plane during the fabrication of the specimen. The laminate is kept for 16 hours at a temperature of 25°C and pressure of 0.5 MPa to get cure. After the laminate is prepared, it is cut to the specified size of the specimen for testing. The dimensions of the specimen are given as, Length, L = 200 mm; Precrack length, ao = 40 mm; Width, b= 30 mm; and Thickness, 2h= 4 mm. The ends of the specimen are prepared in such a way that they can be fixed to the loading fixture. The loading fixture consists of top and bottom rectangular tabs, which are fitted to the specimen with the help of bolts. The tabs are tightened by the bolt from opposite side of the tabs such that the bolts only touches the respective tabs not other one. The specimen is painted with white color on the both side along thickness to mark the crack tip accurately during the experiment. A thin strip from a graph sheet is bonded on the top of the specimen to measure the crack length for the measurement of inter laminar facture toughness. The top and bottom rectangular tabs are hold by the jaw of the Instron machine and properly aligned. The specimen is tested in the tensile mode with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The load cell with maximum capacity of 100 kN is used and the load range is set to 0.2 kN. The chart speed set to 10 mm/min. A real time display of load vs. deflection is obtained. During loading, when a sudden change in the<br><br>
slope of the loading curve is observed. The machine is then stopped and waits for some time for the crack to self arrest. Then the exact crack tip portion is marked on the specimen on both side of the specimen. To locate exact point of crack tip, a magnifying lens is used. The specimen is unloaded and the machine is stopped at zero load. The machine is reloaded to get the similar plot for the next crack length. The experiment is<br>
repeated for 5-6 times. The critical load Pco, Pc1	Pen for corresponding crack length<br>
of ao, ai_	 a„   are measured. The first cycle is excluded from the calculation as<br>
cantilevers are partially bonded to the BOPP precarck and they are not free to move. Inter laminar fracture toughness is determined by using the following expression<br>
where A1 and A2 are constants for a given specimen and b is the width of specimen. A1 and A2 can be evaluated from experimental data obtained from DCB test and using an approximate data reduction technique.<br>
Inter laminar Shear Test: The specimens are made of 6 layers of glass fiber fabric/epoxy resin in order to get 2 mm thick sheet. After the lamina is prepared, it is cut with the help of diamond cutter to the dimension of 20 mm long, 10 mm wide and 2 mm thick. Five specimens are cut from single laminate. The test has been conducted on the specimens with 0° orientation of warp fibers along loading direction. The tests are carried out on MTS-810 machine. The specimen is placed on the base plate and aligned. The tests are conducted in the displacement control mode with a loading rate of 2 mm/min. The load is applied with the center load wedge. The inter laminar shear strength is calculated from the load vs. displacement graph with the help of the following equation<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where F, b and d are the applied load, width and the depth of the specimen section respectively.<br>
Tension Test: The width, length and the thickness of the specimen are 25, 175 and 2.5 mm respectively. The length, width and thickness of end tabs are 30, 25 and 2 mm respectively. To prepare specimen with 0° orientation along loading direction and 2.7 mm thickness 8 layers of bidirectional glass fiber are used. After the preparation of the laminate in conventional and rubber molding techniques, the laminates are cut to the<br><br>
specified dimension using diamond impregnated wheel cutter. The end tabs used in the specimen with thickness of 2 mm are prepared from 6 layers of bidirectional glass fiber fabric and epoxy resin. The end tabs are cut from these laminates to the required geometry. Then the end tabs are bonded to the specimen using epoxy resin. After bonding the end tabs, specimens are marked at the center of the specimen to place the extensometer. The specimen is clamped in the hydraulic wedge grip of the MTS-810 machine up to the depth of 30 mm from both ends. The proper alignment of the specimen in the jaw is assured as minor change in the direction of pull gives an incorrect value. The extensometer with 50 mm gauge length is placed at the center of the specimen. The tests are conducted in displacement control mode with loading rate of 1 mm/min. The applied load is measured with the help of load cell and strain is measured with the help of extensometer. A typical load vs strain graph is obtained from the plotter of the MTS machine. Tensile strength, modulus of elasticity in longitudinal direction and the percentage of elongation are calculated from this graph. The slope of the graph is linear initially but as load on the specimen increases the fiber starts breaking and the curve becomes non-linear. The slope of the linear curve is used to calculate the modulus of elasticity. The tests are conducted on 5 specimens prepared by each technique.<br>
Preparation of FRP composite material using silicone rubber punch<br>
2. 65 gm dicumyl peroxide is mixed in 650 gm silicone rubber at a temperature of 70°C, mixing time of 15 minutes and friction ratio of 1:1.1 in a two roll mixing mill. The uncured mixed silicone rubber is filled in the die and the steel cone is placed over it at a temperature of 160°C. The pressure is 5 MPa. The temperature and pressure is maintained for 30 minutes. The cured rubber punch is taken out by removing bolts on the metal plate of die. Now again hand lay-up technique is used to prepare the preform (uncured form of product). The glass fabric is cut in right shape using the templates 1, 2 and 3 from a woven glass fiber sheet. The matrix used to prepare the product is epoxy/polyester resin. The epoxy resin is mixed with 10% of hardener (PH861) to cure the resin. The weight ratio of polyester resin, catalyst (benzole peroxide) and hardener (methyl ethyl ketone) is 100:2:2 to make the FRP article using polyester resin. Total numbers of template 1, template 2 and template 3 used to prepare the preform are 6, 3, and 3 respectively. Polyvinyl alcohol coating agent is applied on the rubber punch to make a FRP article using polyester resin. Other wise polytetrafluoro ethylene /silicone emulsion is applied on the rubber punch to make a FRP article using epoxy resin. Using<br><br>
hand lay-up technique the glass fabric and the catalyst mixed epoxy/polyester resin are placed on the coated rubber punch, then the rubber punch with preform is placed inside the split steel die and four bolts of the die set is bolted till the two portion of the split die touches each other. Then, steel cone is placed over the rubber punch. The steel die and the rubber punch with preform are loaded in a hydraulic press and allowed to cure at room temperature for 16 hours. Now the FRP product made of rubber pressure moulding technique using silicone rubber is characterized by burn test, coin test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical tests like interlaminar fracture toughness, inter laminar shear test, tension test, etc (methods described above).<br>
Preparation of FRP composite material using natural rubber punch<br>
3. 21.25 gm zinc oxide, 12.75 gm stearic acid, 8.5 gm BLN (antioxidant), 8.5 gm TMQ (antioxidant), 212.5 gm carbon black (GPF), 21.25 gm paraffmic process oil, 12.75 gm sulfur and 8.5 gm mercaptobenzthiazole are mixed in 425 gm natural rubber at a temperature of 70°C, mixing time of 40 minutes and friction ratio of 1:1.1 in a two roll mixing mill. The uncured mixed natural rubber is filled in the die and the steel cone is placed over it at a temperature of 150°C and pressure of 5 MPa. The temperature and pressure is maintained for 30 minutes. The cured rubber punch is taken out by removing bolts on the metal plate of die. Now again hand lay-up technique is used to prepare the preform (uncured form of product). The glass fabric is cut in right shape using the templates 1, 2 and 3 from a woven glass fiber sheet. The matrix used to prepare the product is epoxy/polyester resin. The epoxy resin is mixed with 10% of hardener (PH861) to cure the resin. The weight ratio of polyester resin, catalyst (benzole peroxide) and hardener (methyl ethyl ketone) is 100:2:2 to make the FRP article using polyester resin. Total numbers of template 1, template 2 and template 3 used to prepare the preform are 6, 3, and 3 respectively. Polyvinyl alcohol coating agent is applied on the rubber punch to make a FRP article using polyester resin. Other wise polytetrafluoro ethylene/ polyvinyl alcohol/ silicone emulsion/ soap solution is applied on the rubber punch to make a FRP article using epoxy resin. Using hand lay-up technique the glass fabric and the catalyst mixed epoxy/polyester resin are placed on the coated rubber punch, then the rubber punch with preform is placed inside the split steel die and four bolts of the die set is bolted till the two portion of the split die touches each other. Then, steel cone is placed over the rubber punch. The steel die and the rubber punch with preform are loaded in a hydraulic press and allowed to cure at room temperature for 16<br><br>
hours. Now the FRP product made of rubber pressure moulding technique using natural rubber is characterized by burn test, coin test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical tests like interlaminar fracture toughness, inter laminar shear test, tension test, etc are carried out to know the void content, presence of delamination, bonding between fiber and resin, microstructure and performance of the composite materials (methods described above).<br>
Example: Preparation of complex shaped FRP composite material<br>
The complex shaped product, pump cap (Figure 5) has been chosen to make from FRP using rubber pressure molding technique. The pump cap selected in this study, which is a component of cooler pump, is usually made of steel sheet of thickness 1 mm. It usually gets rusted and it was felt that a component of composite pump might be a more appropriate material. This component has three important geometry elements (i) cylindrical, (ii) conical and (iii) flat surface (Figure 5). The cylindrical part has an outer diameter of 120 mm and thickness of 1.5 mm; the conical portion has a half cone angle of 45° and thickness of 1.5 mm; the flat portion has a diameter of 70 mm and thickness of 1.5 mm. The total height of the pump cap is 75 mm. Another complex shaped product (Figure 6) is also made using this rubber pressure moulding technique. To prepare the pump cap (Figure 5) from FRP a split steel die, steel cone and flexible rubber punch are used. A schematic diagram of the overall setup is shown in Figure 7. Split steel die has an interior conforming to an external shape of the component. The die is made in two parts for easy removal of component once it is cured. A perform of glass fiber fabrics wetted with epoxy/polyester resin is placed in between split die and rubber punch as shown in Figure 7. Then the rubber punch is pressed by a suitably designed steel cone. A force on the steel cone is applied by the hydraulic press. The product is cured in 16 hours at room temperature and pressure of 0.4 MPa. The material for the die chosen is mild steel as mild steel has high strength, good macinability, good thermal conductivity, high stiffness and good compressive strength. Thus the material is suitable to bear high compressive stresses developed during the curing of performs under pressure. The same die is also used to prepare rubber punch. Also it does not adhere to the cured rubber, therefore cured rubber punch could be easily taken out from the die. Moreover deformation of mild steel die is negligible. The mild steel die is made of two parts (split type). Its assembly drawing is shown in Figure 8. Two parts of the die are symmetric to each other. To make the die, a rectangular steel block is cut in to two pieces and their<br><br>
surfaces are polished to get smooth surface. Then two parts are tacked welded and machining is done on the welded assembly to obtain the exact internal dimension of die. The inner surface of die is polished to obtain very smooth surface as the shape of rubber punch and preform depends on the surface finish of die. Four steel plates (125X25X10 mm) with a dowel hole (Φ8) and two Ml2 holes on each plate (shown in Figure 8) are welded. To sustain high pressure, supporting webs are provided on the steel plates. Then the halves of the welded assembly are detached by breaking the welded points. As the component prepared is of only 1.5 mm thick, a single die set is used for preparing rubber punch as well as FRP components. However to prepare thicker component two die sets will be required, one for preparing the rubber punch and another one for preparing the component. In that case the internal dimension of the die to prepare rubber punch should be less and upset by thickness of component. The schematic of rubber punch is shown in Figure 9.<br>
Five types of rubber (natural, butyl, silicon, styrene butadiene and polybutadiene) are used to cast five different rubber punches. The rubber punch that is to cast have a same inner shape that of FRP component. The die used to cast the rubber punch is same that is used to prepare the component i.e. split steel die. This butyl rubber punch (as representative) is shown in Figure 10. The whole assembly with butyl rubber punch is shown in Figure 11. The fiber reinforced plastic product using this butyl rubber is shown in Figure 12.<br>
Burn test, coin test and microstructure study are performed to check the quality of products like volume fraction of fiber, void content, possibility of delamination, interaction between fiber and matrix, etc. The results are compared with those obtained using conventional method. This test has been conducted for cylindrical, conical and flat part of the FRP pump cap. Five specimens are cut from each sections of pump cap, i.e. cylindrical, conical and flat surfaces. Burn test data for the products are given in Table 31. It is clear from these results that the FRP composites produced by RPM technique have good quality and uniform distribution of fibers and matrix. The volume fraction of fiber is in between 45 to 53% using a pressure of 0.5 MPa. Void content in all cases is less than 3.0%. In coin test, a metallic sound is observed which indicates no delamination and good quality of laminate. Scanning electron microscopy studies show that there is uniform distribution of fibers and matrix in the composites prepared by RPM technique. The SEM photographs are shown in Figures 2,3 and 4.<br><br>
Table 31: The fiber volume fraction including % of void in the product made of rubber pressure moulding technique using natural rubber, butyl rubber, silicone rubber, polybutadiene rubber and styrene butadiene rubber<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The tension test is conducted on the specimen made of glass fiber and polyester/epoxy resin with 0° fiber orientation prepared by the conventional and rubber pressure molding using butyl rubber, natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, polybutadiene rubber and silicone rubber to find out the suitability of new process. The results of mechanical properties using both techniques are given in Tables 13 to 30. The specimens are failed at the center portion and the facture line makes 45° to the line of loading. The stress strain curve is linear at the low loading but non-linear at the higher loading due to the breaking of fiber.<br>
Advanced fiber composite materials are very attractive for application in structures where a high specific stiffness and specific strength are important. However, one limitation of their application is the low inter laminar fracture toughness. A major failure mode in laminated composites is a delamination between the laminated layers. These laminates are susceptible to delamination when subjected to an inter laminar stress concentration by impact loadings. Defects like microcracks, voids, inclusions, etc. tend to grow in an inter laminar mode. The existence of delamination which occurs due to the low inter laminar fracture toughness, will lead not only to a loss of stiffness but also to a considerable degradation in the strength and expected material life. Therefore, the inter<br><br>
laminar fracture toughness is an important factor that must be considered in the design and use of fiber composite structures. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made of polyester resin using conventional method with volume fraction of fiber 40% is 436 J/m2 (Table 13). The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by rubber pressure moulding technique using butyl rubber is 463 J/m2 (Table 13). Here the volume fraction of fiber is 40% and the matrix is polyester resin.<br>
Composite materials are made of several laminates bonded together by the matrix. As such, delamination failure is likely to occur under shear stress conditions. Inter laminar shear strength (ILSS) is an important material property for the design of laminated composite structures subjected to the transverse loads. Hence inter laminar shear test is carried out to determine the inter laminar shear strength of the composites. The inter laminar shear strength is determined by short beam test method. The specimens of size 20 mm x 10 mm x 2 mm are prepared using rubber pressure moulding and conventional methods. The test is conducted on specimens with 0° orientation of warp fibers along loading direction. The average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made of polyester resin using conventional method with volume fraction of fiber 40% is 30 MPa (Table 14). The average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by rubber pressure moulding technique using butyl rubber is 39 MPa (Table 14). Here the volume fraction of fiber is 40% and the matrix is polyester resin.<br>
The average value of tensile strength (Table 15) of the specimen made of polyester resin using conventional method is 342 MPa. But the average value of tensile strength of the specimens prepared by rubber pressure moulding technique using butyl rubber and polyester resin is 288 MPa. Similarly the average values of tensile elastic modulus and % of elongation of the specimens made by the conventional method are 20 GPa and 2% respectively, where as the average values of tensile elastic modulus and % of elongation of the specimens prepared by RPM technique using butyl rubber and polyester resin are 17.5 GPa and 2% respectively. It is clear from the above observation that the tensile strength of specimens made by RPM method is marginally lower than that of the specimens made by conventional method. The elastic modulus of the specimens prepared by RPM technique using natural rubber also gives marginally lower value than that of the specimens prepared by conventional method. The variations of<br><br>
percentages of elongation of the specimens made by both methods are negligible and the average values are with in experimental error bands.<br>
The average value of tensile strength (Table 16) of the specimen made of polyester resin using the conventional method is 300 MPa. But the average value of tensile strength of the specimens prepared by RPM technique using natural rubber and polyester resin is 316 MPa (Table 16). Similarly the average values of tensile elastic modulus and % of elongation (Table 16) of the specimens made of polyester resin using conventional method are 14 GPa and 4.2 respectively, where as the average values of tensile elastic modulus and % of elongation of (Table 16) the specimens prepared by RPM technique using natural rubber and polyester resin are 16 GPa and 4.3 respectively. It is clear from the above observation that the tensile strength of specimens made by RPM method is higher than that of the specimens made by conventional method. The elastic modulus of the specimens prepared by rubber pressure moulding technique using natural rubber also gives higher value than that of the specimens prepared by conventional method. The variations of percentages of elongation of the specimens made by both methods are negligible.<br>
The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness (Table 17) for the specimen made of polyester resin using conventional method with volume fraction of fiber 49% is 424 J/m2. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by rubber pressure moulding technique using natural rubber and polyester resin is 475 J/m2. Here the volume fraction of fiber is 52%. This shows that the specimens prepared by using natural rubber have inter laminar facture toughness higher by 11% compared to specimen prepared by conventional method.<br>
The average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made of polyester resin using conventional method with volume fraction of fiber 53% is 18 MPa (Table 18), whereas the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by rubber pressure moulding technique using natural rubber is 19.5 MPa (Table 18). Here the volume fraction of fiber is 52% and the matrix is polyester resin.<br>
Now the composite materials are made of glass fiber and epoxy resin. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness (Table 19) for the specimen made by rubber pressure moulding method using natural rubber is 166 J/m2, where as the average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by rubber pressure<br><br>
moulding technique using butyl rubber is 208 J/m2. This shows that the specimens prepared by butyl rubber have inter laminar facture toughness higher than the specimen prepared by natural rubber. Similarly the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made of epoxy resin using natural rubber is 25 MPa (Table 19), whereas the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by butyl rubber is 59 MPa (Table 19). The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and elongation at break of composite materials prepared by rubber pressure moulding technique using natural rubber and epoxy resin are 309 MPa, 20 GPa and 2% respectively, where as for butyl rubber these are 346 MPa, 21 GPa and 2.2% respectively. This clearly shows the composite materials made of epoxy resin and glass fiber using rubber pressure moulding technique is very good in the case of butyl rubber compared to natural rubber.<br>
Again the composite materials are made of glass fiber and polyester resin. The mechanical properties (Table 21) of these composite materials are compared with the conventional method and rubber pressure moulding technique using butyl rubber. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness (Table 21) for the specimen made by conventional method is 435 J/m , where as the average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by rubber pressure moulding technique using butyl rubber is 470 J/m . This shows that the specimens prepared by butyl rubber have higher inter laminar facture toughness than the specimen prepared by conventional method. Similarly the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by conventional method is 30 MPa (Table 21), whereas the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by butyl rubber is 40 MPa (Table 21). The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, elongation at break and Poisson's ratio of composite materials prepared by conventional method are 340 MPa, 20 GPa, 2% and 0.19% respectively, where as for butyl rubber these are 338 MPa, 20 GPa, 2% and 0.19 respectively.<br>
Now the composite materials are made of glass fiber and polyester resin using rubber pressure moulding technique. The mechanical behaviors are compared with respect to polybutadiene and butyl rubber. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness (Table 22) for the specimen made by polybutadiene rubber is 450 J/m2, where as the average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by butyl rubber is 470 J/m2. This shows that the specimens prepared by butyl rubber have higher<br><br>
inter laminar facture toughness than the specimen prepared by polybutadiene rubber. Similarly the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by polybutadiene rubber is 37 MPa (Table 22), whereas the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by butyl rubber is 40 MPa (Table 22). The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, elongation at break, and Poisson's ratio of composite materials prepared by rubber pressure moulding technique using polybutadiene rubber are 330 MPa, 18 GPa, 2% and 0.19 respectively, where as for butyl rubber these are 338 MPa, 20 GPa, 2% and 0.19 respectively. This clearly shows the composite materials made of polyester resin and glass fiber using rubber pressure moulding technique is good in the case of butyl rubber compared to polybutadiene rubber.<br>
The mechanical behaviors of composite materials prepared by rubber pressure moulding technique using epoxy resin are compared with respect to polybutadiene and butyl rubber. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness (Table 23) for the specimen made by polybutadiene rubber is 175 J/m2, where as the average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by butyl rubber is 208 J/m2. This shows that the specimens prepared by butyl rubber have higher inter laminar facture toughness than the specimen prepared by polybutadiene rubber. Similarly the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by polybutadiene rubber is 44 MPa (Table 23), whereas the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by butyl rubber is 59 MPa (Table 23). The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, elongation at break, and Poisson's ratio of composite materials prepared by rubber pressure moulding technique using polybutadiene rubber are 338 MPa, 19.5 GPa, 2.1% and 0.19 respectively, where as for butyl rubber these are 346 MPa, 21 GPa, 2.2% and 0.19 respectively. This clearly shows the composite materials made of epoxy resin and glass fiber using rubber pressure moulding technique is good in the case of butyl rubber compared to polybutadiene rubber.<br>
Now the composite materials are made of glass fiber and polyester resin using conventional method and rubber pressure moulding technique. The mechanical behaviors are compared with respect to these methods. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness (Table 24) for the specimen made by conventional method is 435 J/m2, where as the average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by polybutadiene rubber is 450 J/m2. This shows that the specimens prepared by polybutadiene rubber have higher inter laminar facture toughness than the<br><br>
specimen prepared by conventional method. Similarly the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by conventional method is 30 MPa (Table 24), whereas the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by polybutadiene rubber is 37 MPa (Table 24). The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, elongation at break, and Poisson's ratio of composite materials prepared by conventional method are 340 MPa, 20 GPa, 2% and 0.19 respectively, where as for butyl rubber these are 330 MPa, 18 GPa, 2% and 0.19 respectively. This clearly shows the composite materials made of polyester resin and glass fiber using rubber pressure moulding technique is good with respect to inter laminar fracture toughness and inter laminar shear strength.<br>
The mechanical behaviors of composite materials prepared by rubber pressure moulding technique using polyester resin are compared with respect to silicone and butyl rubber. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness (Table 25) for the specimen made by silicone rubber is 490 J/m , where as the average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by butyl rubber is 470 J/m2. This shows that the specimens prepared by silicone rubber have higher inter laminar facture toughness than the specimen prepared by butyl rubber. Similarly the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by silicone rubber is 60 MPa (Table 25), whereas the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by butyl rubber is 40 MPa (Table 25). The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, elongation at break, and Poisson's ratio of composite materials prepared by rubber pressure moulding technique using silicone rubber are 360 MPa, 22 GPa, 2% and 0.19 respectively, where as for butyl rubber these are 338 MPa, 20 GPa, 2% and 0.19 respectively. This clearly shows the composite materials made of polyester resin and glass fiber using rubber pressure moulding technique is good in the case of silicone rubber compared to butyl rubber.<br>
Again the mechanical behaviors of composite materials prepared by epoxy resin and glass fiber are compared with respect to silicone and butyl rubber. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness (Table 26) for the specimen made by silicone rubber is 205 J/m , where as the average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by butyl rubber is 208 J/m . Similarly the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by silicone rubber is 55 MPa (Table 26), whereas the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by butyl rubber<br><br>
is 59 MPa (Table 26). The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and elongation at break of composite materials prepared by rubber pressure moulding technique using silicone rubber are 342 MPa, 21 GPa, and 2.1% respectively, where as for butyl rubber these are 346 MPa, 21 GPa and 2.2% respectively. This clearly shows the composite materials made of epoxy resin and glass fiber using rubber pressure moulding technique have equivalent mechanical properties in the case of silicone and butyl rubber.<br>
Now the composite materials are made of glass fiber and polyester resin using conventional method and rubber pressure moulding technique using silicone rubber. The mechanical behaviors are compared with respect to these methods. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness (Table 27) for the specimen made by conventional method is 435 J/m2, where as the average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by silicone rubber is 490 J/m2. This shows that the specimens prepared by silicone rubber have higher inter laminar facture toughness than the specimen prepared by conventional method. Similarly the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by conventional method is 30 MPa (Table 27), whereas the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by polybutadiene rubber is 60 MPa (Table 27). The tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, elongation at break, and Poisson's ratio of composite materials prepared by conventional method are 340 MPa, 20 GPa, 2% and 0.19 respectively, where as for silicone rubber these are 360 MPa, 22 GPa, 2% and 0.19 respectively. This clearly shows the composite materials made of polyester resin and glass fiber using rubber pressure moulding technique is very good with respect to the conventional method.<br>
The tension test is conducted on the composite specimens with 0° fiber orientation prepared by the conventional and rubber pressure molding using natural rubber for various filler-rubber compositions. The composite materials are prepared from polyester resin and glass fiber. The results of tension test are given in Table 28. Figure 13 shows the variation of tensile strength of composite materials prepared by rubber pressure moulding technique using natural rubber having various loading of carbon black. The average value of tensile strength of the specimen made by the conventional method is 300 MPa. The average values of tensile strength of the specimens prepared by RPM technique using natural rubber are 294, 336, 352, 342, 330 and 353 MPa for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 phr (per hundred rubber) carbon black loading respectively. It is clear from these data that the variation in the average value of tensile strength due to varying<br><br>
carbon black content is within a range of 59 MPa. Similarly the average value of tensile elastic modulus of the specimens made by the conventional method is 14.2 GPa, where as the average values of tensile elastic modulus of the specimens prepared by RPM technique using natural rubber are 15.3,16.5,16.0,14.8,16.1 and 18.1 GPa for 0,15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 phr (per hundred rubber) carbon black loading respectively. The average value of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by conventional method with volume fraction of fiber 49% is 424 J/m2. The average values of inter laminar fracture toughness for the specimen made by RPM technique using natural rubber are 410, 398, 476, 446, 472 and 386 J/m2 for the carbon black loading of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 phr respectively (Table 29). A graph showing the variation of inter laminar fracture toughness of composite laminate made by RPM Technique with increase in the carbon black loading in the natural rubber is shown in Figure 14. Similarly the average value of inter laminar shear strength for the specimen made by conventional method is 18.5 MPa (Table 30), whereas the average values of inter laminar shear strength for the specimens made by natural rubber containing carbon black loading of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 phr are 11, 11, 17,13, 20, and 13 MPa (Table 30). A graph showing the variation of inter laminar fracture shear strength of composite laminates made by RPM Technique with increase in the carbon black loading in the natural rubber is shown in Figure 15.
