FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of rapid prototyping More<br>
specifically, the present invention relates to a material system for use in rapid<br>
prototyping<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Rapid prototyping is fast becoming a popular process for<br>
manufacturing three-dimensional objects including prototype parts and<br>
working tools such as structural ceramics and ceramic shell molds One<br>
form of rapid prototyping involves a process of sequentially forming layers<br>
In this process, a powdery material is used to form each individual<br>
layer of the desired product<br>
Such a printing process offers the advantages of speedy fabrication<br>
and low materials cost It is considered one of the fastest rapid prototyping<br>
methods, and can be performed using a variety of colors as well<br>
However there are several disadvantages in conventional powder<br>
based rapid prototyping processes including the fragility of the resulting<br>
product. Poor mechanrcal properties in the final product are characterized<br>
by a low modulus of elasticity and low fracture strength Weakness in<br>
compression and tensile failures at low stress may be due to low density<br>
poor adhesion between powder particles, low density of particles, and the<br>
presence of voids. In both the intralayer and interlayer levels the powder<br>
particles are only loosely glued together More particularly powders that are<br>
presently being used in the market are based on gypsum and/or water<br>
swellable polymers such as starches. PVA. etc Interaction of these powders<br>
with an aqueous binder results in poor mechanical strength as well as high<br>
porosity of the green object Also, parts made by powder based rapid<br>
prototyping as well as jetted direct build-up type rapid prototyping suffer<br>
from poor strength The latter is due to the fact that only lower molecular<br>
weight polymers (namely their solutions) can be jetted since high molecular<br>
weight polymers have viscosities that are too high<br>
Further, the poor mechanical properties in the esulting product lead<br>
to the fact that the base or "green' object, which is fabricated by printing<br>
layers in a powder bed, must be subjected to labor intensive post-<br>
processing This post-processing often involves reinforcing the printed<br>
object by soaking it tn binding or strengthening agents such as cyanoacrylate<br>
glue etc which penetrate the surface and fill the interconnected pores within<br>
the bulk Gypsum based powders and water sweliable polymers currently<br>
available have long swelling times, which can be thirty minutes or more<br>
Another disadvantage of this and similar processes is that the resulting<br>
products can have a poor resolution, represented by a grainy texture of the<br>
product<br>
While post-processing drying of the resulting article improves the<br>
mechanical properties slightly, the improvements are minima! and the drying<br>
process is very slow Other post-processing measures include reinforcing<br>
with polymenzable glues such as cyanoacrylate or surface finishing, but<br>
these measures are costly and labor intensive as well Ultimately the<br>
mechanical properties and surface finish depend on the properties of the<br>
system of matenals in concert with their ability to intermix uniformly and react<br>
sufficiently<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one of many possible embodiments, the present invention provides<br>
a rapid prototyping system that preferably includes a basic component<br>
selected from the group consisting of a metal oxide and one or more<br>
aluminosilicate glasses, an acidic component, and an aqueous binder<br>
capable of stimulating a crosslinking reaction between the basic component<br>
and the acidic component to form a three-dimensional printed object<br>
Additional advantages and novel features of the invention will be set<br>
forth in the descnption which follows or may be learned by those skilled in<br>
the art through reading these materials or practicing the invention The<br>
advantages of the invention may be achieved through the means recited in<br>
the attached claims<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In a wide variety of embodiments, the present invention provides a<br>
system for rapid prototyping, the compositions included in the system, and a<br>
rapid prototyping method incorporating the system The system for rapid<br>
prototyping is preferably leveraged from so-called acid-base cements The<br>
components included in the system preferably include a base such as a<br>
metal oxide or an aluminosilicate glass, a polymeric acid or other acid, and<br>
an aqueous binder The basic powder interacts With the acid in the presence<br>
of water, causing the formation of an ionically crosslsnked hydrogel salt<br>
Formation of the crosslinked hydrogel causes setting of the mixture.<br>
There are three general possibilities for implementation of the system<br>
and the materials included sn rapid prototyping systems according to the<br>
present invention First both reactive components i.e the acid component<br>
and the basic component can be present in a dry powder mixture The<br>
powder is then inkjet printed with an aqueous or polar solvent binder solution<br>
that does not contain any of the reactive components that form the cement<br>
Second, a dry powder mixture can contain only the basic component. An<br>
aqueous or polar solvent binder solution that includes the acid component is<br>
then jetted onto the powder bed during the printing process. Third a dry<br>
powder can contain the basic component as well as some of the acid<br>
component as a mixture An aqueous or polar solvent binder solution is then<br>
used that includes some of the acid component dissolved therein, so that<br>
both the powder mixture and the aqueous binder include some of the<br>
reactive acid component The aqueous or polar solvent binder solution and<br>
acid component mixture is then jetted onto the powder bed containing the<br>
mixture of the acid and basic components<br>
Apart from the chemical aspects of the present invention, the printing<br>
process is similar to the conventional mechanics associated with rapid<br>
prototyping that uses a printing process. Multiple planar layers are printed<br>
and adjoined together to form a three-dimensional object Printing is<br>
performed layer-by-layer, with each layer representing a cross section of a<br>
portion of the final desired product The powder material forms each<br>
individual layer, and is evenly distributed and compressed by compression<br>
means such as a roller When the printer used in the rapid prototyping<br>
method is an inkjet printer a printer head deposits the binder onto the<br>
powder in a two-dimensional pattern, and the powder is bonded in the areas<br>
where the adhesive is deposited, thereby forming a printed layer of the final<br>
object to be produced Predetermined portions of the adjacent printed layers<br>
are adhered one to another by the use of an aqueous binder resulting in the<br>
joining of the individual cross sections of the final product The binder is<br>
applied simultaneously with the printing of each individual layer The "un-<br>
printed" regions where no adhesive has been applled are then separated<br>
from the printed regions where adhesive binder has been applied, leaving a<br>
three-dimensional printed base or "green" product<br>
Next, the chemical aspects of the present invention will be described<br>
The acid component of the rapid prototyping system is water/solvent soluble<br>
and is acidic relative to water/solvent Consequently contact of the acidic<br>
component with the aqueous or polar solvent binder solution causes protons<br>
to dissociate from the acidic component The free protons are immediately<br>
attracted to the basic component of the rapid prototyping system, and the<br>
basic component releases multivalent cations (Me) as they are replaced by<br>
the protons<br>
The released cations from the basic component of the rapid<br>
prototyping system mediate the crosslinking of the compounds that make up<br>
the acid component Ionic crosslinking of the acidic compounds reduces the<br>
mobility of the acid component Eventually the crosslinking process results<br>
tn solidification of the acid in the solution because of formation salt hydro (or<br>
solvent) gel. followed by setting and further hardening of the cement product<br>
A representative (and the most simplified) example of this chemical<br>
process involves glass-ionomer chemistry, where the acid component in the<br>
rapid prototyping system is a polyacid such as polyacrylic actd The basic<br>
component in this example is aluminosilicate glass, for example. The<br>
protons from the polyacryiic acid release upon the dissolving of the<br>
polyacryiic acid in the aqueous binder, and the protons attack the glass.<br>
which releases multivalent cations. The cations then crosslink the polyacid<br>
through formation of ionic bonds and the bonding causes the polyacid<br>
components to compress and solidify until the cement ts completely solidified<br>
and extremely hard<br>
There are three basic chemical components of the rapid prototyping<br>
system, namely, an active acidic component, an active basic component.<br>
and an aqueous binder The basic component can be a metal oxide, and<br>
can also be an aluminosilicate glass The aqueous binder must be capable<br>
of stimulating a crosslmking reaction between the basic component and the<br>
acidic component to form a three-dimensional printed object The acidic<br>
component can be one or more acidic components such as an organic<br>
polyacid, a monomer actd, an oligomer acida monomer having anions<br>
capable of forming hydrogel (or solvent-gel) salts that are cross-linkable with<br>
metal ions from said basic metal oxide, and a hydrolyzable metal salt<br>
capable of forming an oxysalt polymer matrix with said baste metal oxide<br>
Examples of acid-base combinations that form a cement system for<br>
rapid prototyping include the following<br>
a Zinc oxide - polycarboxylic acid cements<br>
b Metal oxide (i e . oxides of Be, Zn Cu. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, or<br>
other metal oxides ) - orthophosphoric or poly (phosphoric acid) cements In<br>
this case metal cations crosslink phosphate anions resulting in the formation<br>
of a hydrogel matrix<br>
c A mixture of reactive aluminosilicate glasses (i.e ,<br>
xCaOyAI2O3zSiO2nCaF2, and i.e sometimes containing fluorine) with<br>
orthophosphoric or poly (phosphoric acid) In this case, setting of the<br>
cement involves the formation of a hydroge! matrix of siilca gel and lonically<br>
crosslinked phosphate ions. The average particle size for the glass is<br>
preferably approximately 30-50 mm or less, as glass particles with a smaller<br>
diameter can be difficult to spread<br>
d Oxysalt-bonded cements These are formed by acid-base<br>
reactions of metal oxide powder such as ZnO or MgO, although the metal<br>
oxide powder is not limited to these oxides and a concentrated solution of<br>
metal chloride or sulfate where the metal is for example. Zn or Mg<br>
e Glass-ionomer cements In this case the basic component<br>
of the system is reactive aiummostlicate glass (i.e xCaO*yAI2O3"zSiO2, and<br>
frequently containing fluonne, i. e . in the form of CaF2, and the acidic<br>
component of the system is organic polyacid containing functional groups<br>
such as -COOH, -SO3H. and -PO3H2 The glass lonomer mixture may also<br>
contain small amounts of low molecular weight complexing agent such as L-<br>
or D-tartanc acid for adjusting the kinetics of the cement setting process In<br>
some cases, the glass-lonomer cements should be pretreated to make the<br>
surface of the polyacsd powder less hydrophilic and therefore les susceptible<br>
to clumping due to moisture absorption A preferable pretreatment includes<br>
the addition of some anti-caking hydrophobic agent to the dry cement mix<br>
The agent could include some stearate salts (Mg, Ca 7n) or lecithin at a<br>
concentration of between 0 01 and 13 0 wt%<br>
The above types of cements provide superior compressive strength<br>
and significantly better mechanical properties relative to common systems<br>
typically used in rapid prototyping systems Using these cements, there is<br>
no need for any reinforcing post-treatment The cements have a very short<br>
setting/curing time No drying is necessary because water in the aqueous<br>
binder is consumed and becomes part of the solid phase durng the acid-<br>
base setting reaction, which generally proceeds to completion much faster<br>
than drying of the green object composed of the materials currently present<br>
on the market Further, the material produced by the cement has a<br>
continuous texture<br>
The cements of the present invention cure by means of ionic reactions<br>
like neutralization salt formation, chelation. crystallization or tonic and<br>
covalent cross-linking specifically in the presence of water or other polar<br>
solvent. As discussed above the components included in the system<br>
preferably include a base such as a metal oxide or an aluminosilicate glass<br>
an acidic component and an aqueous binder The acidic component is<br>
usually a polymeric acid (poiycarboxylic polysulfonic, polyphosphonic acids)<br>
or other acid (phosphoric acid derivatives of salicylic acid) or a hydrolysable<br>
metal salt. The binder is not limited to an aqueous one Any polar solvent<br>
capable of interacting acid and base components may De effective, so long<br>
as it can dissolve or solubilize the components and promote the cross-linking<br>
reaction<br>
In one of the embodiments of current invention, acid or polymeric acid<br>
component of the acid-base cement could be partially or fully substituted with<br>
unsaturated polymerizable acidic moieties of a monomeric or oligomeric<br>
nature, as well as their salts or other acid derivative groups In such a case<br>
a cross-linked hydrogel formed after the acid-base interaction of the cement<br>
components could be further fortified by polymerization and. hence covalent<br>
cross-linking of the unsaturated moieties Examples of polymerizable<br>
unsaturated monomers, oligomers or prepolymers with acid groups or<br>
reactive acid-derivative groups may include<br>
unsaturated organic esters of phosphoric and phosphonic acids.<br>
unsaturated organic esters of monofluorophosphoric acid.<br>
unsaturated organic esters of phosphoric acids that contain either<br>
chlorine or bromine bonded directly to the phosphorus,<br>
unsaturated organic esters of phosphoric acid in the form of<br>
pyrophosphates (anhydrides),<br>
unsaturated carboxylic acids,<br>
unsaturated sutfur-containing organic acid moieties with groups of -<br>
SO2H-SO3H -O-SO3H type,<br>
unsaturated organic derivatives of boric acid i.e the ones containing<br>
groups -B(OH)2. B(OH)(OR), -O-B(OH)2, -O-B(OH)(OR) wherein R is H or<br>
alkyl<br>
unsaturated organic moieties containing cationic acid radicals like<br>
NR2H* -RR2H* (wherein R ts H or alkyl). and/or<br>
unsaturated organic moieties containing different combinations of the<br>
acidic species listed in the a) - h).<br>
The reactive acsd derivatives can be substituted with acid halides. with<br>
acid anhydrides, and with acid amides, nitriles. and esters that readily<br>
hydrolyze into acid in the presence of water or other polar solvent, as such<br>
can enter into ion- exchange, neutralization, salt formation or chelation<br>
reactions with the base component of the acid-base cement. i. e metal<br>
oxides, ceramics, zeolrtes or teachable reactive glasses Especially preferred<br>
are acid groups or reactive acid derivatives in the form of carboxylate,<br>
phosphate, phosphonate, sulfonate. or borate acid radicals or of their<br>
reactive derivatives<br>
The polymerizable unsaturated monomers, oifgomers, or prepolymers<br>
in the polymerizable cement mixtures in accordance with the invention can<br>
carry alkenyl alkenoxy, cycloalkenyl, aralkenyl, or aikenaryl radicals, with<br>
acryl, methacryl, vinyl. or styryl radicals being preferable and, of these, the<br>
acryl and methacryl radicals which constitute the poiymenzable groups in<br>
many monomers are especially preferable Especially appropriate are<br>
compounds that contain at least two polymenzable groups or at least two<br>
acid groups or acid-derivative groups Examples are phosphorsc-acid esters<br>
of glycerine dimethacrylate or 1-methacryloxyethane-1 1 -diphosphonic acid<br>
The presence of polymerizable unsaturated acidic moieties in the<br>
acid-base cement systems is highly desirable, as well as the presence of a<br>
polymerization initiator in the mixture The role of the initiator is to enable<br>
triggering of polymerization of the unsaturated species after the initial setting<br>
caused by the interaction of the acid and base components of the cement<br>
The covalent polymerization of the unsaturated component of the cement<br>
could be initiated either by photoirradiation (light) or heat. An example of the<br>
initiator used for the light-triggered polymerization is mixture of a-diketones<br>
and tertiary amines Typical initiators used for the heat-triggered<br>
polymerization include but are not limited to organic or inorganic peroxides<br>
such as benzoyi peroxide or ammonium persulfate<br>
The major purpose for the aqueous or polar soivent-based binder is to<br>
deliver and/or enable interaction of the acidic component of the cement with<br>
the basic component Apart from water and/or solvent, the liquid binder may<br>
also contain<br>
a surfactants/wetting agent to facilitate quick wetting of the<br>
powder surface by the binder,<br>
b colorants such as dyes or pigments to provide color for the<br>
printed object,<br>
c co-solvents to improve dye solubility in the binder.<br>
d soluble polymers to modify rheoiogtcal behavior and improve<br>
jettability of the binder.<br>
e complexing agent, i.e tartanc acid or EDTA. to control the<br>
setting behavior and rate of the acid-base reactive system<br>
In the case where the acidic part of the system contains covalently<br>
polymenzable acidic moieties, the initial acid-base interaction of the<br>
components is still used to print and produce the so-called green object<br>
After the initial printing, the mechanical properties, the ease of handling, and<br>
the resistance to environmental factors (moisture and/or humidity) of the<br>
green object" is significantly enhanced by the post-treatment involving<br>
curing matenal of the object through exposure to light or heat Polymerization<br>
of the unsaturated moseties in the green object results in covatent cross-<br>
linking and further fortification of the hydrogel salt matrix formed by the initial<br>
acid-base interaction<br>
In another embodiment of the current invention, covalent cross-linking<br>
of the unsaturated poiymenzable moleties could be initiated immediately<br>
after the delivery of the aqueous or polar solvent-based binder into the<br>
powder. In this case covaient cross-linking happens in parallel with ionic<br>
cross-linking cased by acid-base interaction. The mechanical embodiment<br>
of this approach implies the presence of a source of light in the visible or UV<br>
range, or heat from, for example, IR radiation, above the printed powder<br>
surface. The "green object" in this case is cured at the same time as it is<br>
printed on the layer by layer basis<br>
An example reaction mixture involving reactive glass- ionomer<br>
chemistry in one embodiment of the invention includes between about 60%<br>
and about 90% by weight of a reactive aluminosilicate glass An acidic<br>
powder having an average molecular mass of between about 2,000 about<br>
1 000,000 is present at about 5 wt% to about 40 wt% It is preferred that in<br>
this case the acid component is a polyacrylic acid having an average<br>
molecular weight that is between about 10.000 and about 150,000 L- or D-<br>
tartaric acid is also included. Finally, an ink-jettable aqueous binder is<br>
present at between about 5 wt% and about 50 wt% of the dry mixture<br>
There are other cement systems that can be used in accordance with<br>
the principles of the present invention For example acid-base cements that<br>
have previously been used for dental and surgical applications may be used<br>
with the present rapid prototyping system and include poiycarboxylate<br>
cements such as zinc oxide and polyacrylic acid-based surgical cements<br>
such as those disclosed in U S. Patent No, 3,751 391 which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference, and giass-ionomer cements such as those<br>
disclosed in U S Patent No 3,814,717 which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference, and in British Patent No 1,316,129 which is also hereby<br>
incorporated by reference<br>
Several applications can be created and modified using the above-<br>
described materials in the present rapid prototyping system According to a<br>
first application, the acidic and the basic component are mixed together in a<br>
dry powder form prior to the addition of the aqueous binder Preferably in<br>
this application, the basic component is a metal oxide or a reactive glass as<br>
described above, and the acidic component is an organic polyacid or a metal<br>
salt The surface of the powder is printed with ink-jettable aqueous binder,<br>
which dissolves the acidic component and causes initiation of the setting<br>
reaction This approach is especially useful when the acidic component is a<br>
high molecular weight poiyacid<br>
According to this first application and other applications, the aqueous<br>
binder may be delivered by an inkjet and may contain compiexing agent(s)<br>
and coloring agent(s) as well In the case where the chemistry involves a<br>
glass-ionomer system, the poiyacid dissolves upon contact with the aqueous<br>
binder A viscous liquid phase is formed, binding together partially reacted<br>
glass particles When the poiyacid is a high molecular weight compound the<br>
mechanical properties of the final product are significantly improved The<br>
organic polyacid is preferably of an average molecular weight ranging from<br>
about 10,000 to about 150 000. although the range can be expanded to<br>
range from about 2,000 to about 1,000,000 Most preferably, the organic<br>
poiyacid is of a molecular weight that is less than 100 000<br>
According to a second application of the present rapid prototyping<br>
system, the acidic component is stored separately from the powder, in a<br>
liquid form. Preferably, the acidic component is mixed with the aqueous<br>
binder. While not so limited, this approach could be typical for cases where<br>
the acidic component is of a relatively low average molecular weight. In any<br>
respect, the acid component is dissolved in the liquid binder and<br>
consequently is delivered to the basic component-containing powder by an<br>
inkjet in the case where inkjet printing is applied. One advantage of this<br>
approach is a more efficient reaction as there is no need for the acidic<br>
component to dissolve in the aqueous binder during printing.<br>
According to a third application of the printing system of the present<br>
invention, the first two applications are combined, so that while some of the<br>
acidic component and all of the basic component are combined together in a<br>
dry powder form prior to the addition of the aqueous binder. Further, the<br>
aqueous binder is separately mixed with additional amounts of the acidic<br>
component prior to printing. Under this approach, it is preferred that the<br>
acidic component in the dry powder has a higher average molecular weight<br>
than that of the acidic component that is mixed with the aqueous binder.<br>
This approach combines the advantages of the first and second approaches.<br>
Further, the integrity of the finally produced object is improved because of<br>
the initial presence of the acidic polymer in the binder, and the ability for a<br>
relatively high average molecular weight acid polymer to mix with the<br>
powder. An additional benefit of this approach is improved solubility of the<br>
acidic component present in the powder The acidic component present in<br>
the liquid binder helps to solubitize the acidic binder In the powder, and<br>
results in better structural uniformity of the printed object.<br>
The colorless binder of the above formulation was jetted into<br>
the powder (giass-ionomer mixture) The binder/powder mass ratto during<br>
the printing was 1 5.10 The initial setting of the cement mixture was<br>
happening 2 min after the binder being jetted into the powder mix The<br>
printing produced white object. The object had enough mechanical strength<br>
to be handled and cleaned from the non-reacted powder immediately after<br>
the printing was finished<br>
The binders of the above formulation were jetted into the powder<br>
(glass-ionomer mixture) The Dinder/powder mass ratso during the printing<br>
was 17 10 The initial setting of the cement mixture was happening 4 mm<br>
