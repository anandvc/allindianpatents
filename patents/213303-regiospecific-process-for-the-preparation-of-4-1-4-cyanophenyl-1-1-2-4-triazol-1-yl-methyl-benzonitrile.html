COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See section 10)<br>
REGIOSPECIFIC PROCESS FOR THE PREPARE CYANOPHENYL)-l-(l,2,4-TRIAZOL-l-YL)METHYL.<br>
SUN  PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA, ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059.<br>
MAHARASHTRA, INDIA<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
REGIOSPECIFIC PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 4-[l- (4-CYANOPHENYL)-l-(l,2,4-TRIAZOL-l-YL)METHYL]BENZONITRILE<br>
The present invention relates to a regiospecific process for the preparation of 4-[l-(4-cyanophenyl)-l-(l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)methyl]benzonitrile, a compound of formula 1, free of isomeric and triaryl impurities. 4-[l-(4-cyanophenyl)-l-(1,2,4-triazol-l-yl)methyl]benzonitrile or"Letrozole (INN name) is an antineoplastic agent.<br><br>
Formula 1 PRIOR ART:<br>
United States Patent No. 4978672 (referred to herein as "672, Indian Reference not available) provides 4-[alpha- (4-cyanophenyl)-l-(l,2,4-triazolyl)-methyl]benzonitrile and the process of its preparation. The patent discloses reacting 4-bromomethylbenzonitrile with 1,2,4-triazole to yield 4-[l-(l,2,4-triazol-l-y!)merhyl]benzonitrile. 4-[l-(l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)methyl]benzonitrile is then reacted with 4-fluorobenzonitrile to give 4-[l-(4-cyanophenyI)-l-(l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)methyl]benzonitriie. This patent does not disclose the purity of 4-[l-(4-cyanophenyl)-l-(l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)methyl]benzonitrile, compound of formula 1. When we followed the patented process we also get the unwanted isomer 4-[l-(l,2,4-triazo!-4-yl)methyl]benzonitrile, a compound of formula 4 (20 to 40%) in step 1. When the reaction mixture of step 1 is treated with 4-fluorobenzonitrile it yields 4-[l-(4-cyanophenyl)-l-(l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-methyl]-benzonitrile, a compound of formula 1, and its isomer, a compound of formula 5. Thus the impurity of formula 4 has to be separated before treating it with 4-fluorobenzonitrile, which involves an additional<br><br>
step of column purification, which is reported in "672 and makes the process tedious and commercially unviable.<br><br><br><br><br>
Formula 4	Formula 5<br>
Further, if the intermediate contains an impurity like 4-toluonitrile or other related impurities, that are present in the raw material viz. 4-(bromomethyl)benzonitrile, in step 2, the impurities would participate in the reaction with 4- fluorobenzonitrile leading to the formation of 4-[l,l-Bis(4-cyanophenyl)methyl]benzonitrile (referred to herein as "tris impurity") compound of formula 6 and other side products.<br>
