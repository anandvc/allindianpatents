PARK-BY-WIRE SUBSYSTEM FOR A CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN<br>
ELECTRICALLY VARIABLE HYBRID TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS REEERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
No. 60/811,656, filed on June 7, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in<br>
its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to electro-hydraulic control systems for<br>
electrically variable hybrid transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Multi-speed power transmissions, particularly those using planetary<br>
gear arrangements, require a hydraulic system to provide controlled engagement and<br>
disengagement, on a desired schedule, of the clutches and brakes or torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms that operate to establish the ratios within the planetary gear<br>
arrangement.<br>
[0004]	These control systems have evolved from substantially pure hydraulic<br>
control systems, wherein hydraulic devices, produce all of the control signals to<br>
electro-hydraulic control systems, wherein an electronic control unit produces a<br>
number of the control signals. The electronic control unit emits electrical control<br>
signals to solenoid valves, which then issue controlled hydraulic signals to the<br>
various operating valves within the transmission control.<br>
[0005]	With many of the early pure hydraulic and first generation electro-<br>
hydraulic control systems, the power transmission utilized a number of freewheel or<br>
one-way devices which smooth the shifting or ratio interchange of the transmission<br>
during both upshifting and downshifting of the transmission. This relieves the<br>
hydraulic control system from providing for the control of overlap between the<br>
torque transmitting mechanism that was coming on and the torque transmitting<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
2<br>
mechanism that was going off. If this overlap is excessive, the driver feels a<br>
shudder in the drivctrain, and if the overlap is too little, the driver experiences<br>
engine flare or a sense of coasting. The freewheel device prevents this feeling by<br>
quickly engaging when the torque imposed thereon is reversed from a freewheeling<br>
state to a transmitting state.<br>
[0006]	The advent of electro-hydraulic devices gave rise to what is known as<br>
clutch-to-clutch shift arrangements to reduce the complexity of the transmission and<br>
the control.   These electro-hydraulic control mechanisms are generally perceived to<br>
reduce cost and reduce the space required for the control mechanism.<br>
[0007]	In   addition,    with   the    advent    of   more    sophisticated    control<br>
mechanisms, the power transmissions have advanced from two-speed or three-speed<br>
transmissions to five-speed and six-speed transmissions. The torque capacity of a<br>
torque transmitting mechanism (on-coming or off-going) involved in a shift may be<br>
conveniently controlled by the combination of an electrically activated solenoid<br>
valve and a pressure regulator valve or trim valve. In a typical system, the solenoid<br>
valve is activated by pulse-width-modulation (PWM) at a controlled duty cycle to<br>
develop a pilot pressure for the pressure regulator valve or trim valve, which in<br>
turn, supplies fluid pressure to the torque transmitting mechanisms in proportion to<br>
the solenoid duty cycle.<br>
[0008]	Additionally, an electrically variable hybrid transmission has been<br>
proposed to improve fuel economy and reduce exhaust emissions. The electrically<br>
variable hybrid transmission splits mechanical power between an input shall and an<br>
output shaft into a mechanical power path and an electrical power path by means of<br>
differential gearing. The mechanical power path may include clutches and<br>
additional gears. The electrical power path may employ two electrical power units,<br>
or motor/generator assemblies, each of which may operate as a motor or a<br>
generator. With an electrical storage system, such as a battery, the electrically<br>
variable hybrid transmission can be incorporated into a propulsion system for a<br>
hybrid electric vehicle.<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
[0009]	The hybrid propulsion system uses an electrical power source as well<br>
as an engine power source. The electrical power source is connected with the<br>
motor/generator units through an electronic control unit, which distributes the<br>
electrical power as required. The electronic control unit also has connections with<br>
the engine and vehicle to determine the operating characteristics, or operating<br>
demand, so that the motor/generator assemblies are operated properly as either a<br>
motor or a generator. When operating as a generator, the motor/generator assembly<br>
accepts power from either the vehicle or the engine and stores power in the battery,<br>
or provides that power to operate another electrical device or another<br>
motor/generator assembly.<br>
[0010]	There are two main hybrid vehicle architectures - the parallel hybrid<br>
and the series hybrid. The hybrid electric vehicle with a parallel configuration has a<br>
direct mechanical connection between the hybrid propulsion system and the drive<br>
wheels of the vehicle. In contrast, the hybrid electric vehicle with a series<br>
configuration uses an engine mounted, generator to produce electricity for the<br>
batteries and/or the electric motor. The series hybrid electric vehicle has no<br>
mechanical connection between the hybrid propulsion system and the drive wheels.<br>
Some hybrid propulsion systems may selectively operate in either a parallel or a<br>
series configuration by employing a clutching mechanism, such as a dog clutch.<br>
[0011]	Additionally, modern control systems allow "shift by wire" range<br>
shift capability. Another name for this technology is electronic transmission range<br>
selection, or ETRS. The ETRS systems dispense with much of the mechanical<br>
interconnections found in mechanically actuated transmissions, thereby simplifying<br>
the transmission architecture and internal mechanical shifter designs. The additional<br>
functionality provided by an electrically variable hybrid transmission requires<br>
creative methods of control architecture to reduce cost, complexity, and weight.<br>
while increasing reliability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
4<br>
[0012]	An internally mounted park-by-wire subsystem for an electrically<br>
variable hybrid transmission is provided. The park-by-wire subsystem includes a<br>
command source and an actuator responsive to control from the command source.<br>
A lever is operatively connected to the actuator, while a park pawl mechanism is<br>
operatively connected to the lever. The actuator is operable to engage the lever to<br>
selectively place the park pawl mechanism in one of a park and out-of-park<br>
condition. First and second control units are operable to communicate with each<br>
other. The first control unit is operable to control the command source. A switch is<br>
operable to monitor the command source and communicate with the first control<br>
unit. Additionally, a sensor is operable to monitor the actuator and communicate<br>
with the second control unit. First and second Hall effect switches are also<br>
provided. The first Hall effect switch is operable to signal the position of the lever<br>
to the first control unit and the second Hall effect switch is operable to signal the<br>
position of the lever to the second control unit. A latching solenoid is operable to<br>
maintain the park pawl mechanism in the out-of-park condition in ihe absence of<br>
control from the command source. An electrically variable hybrid transmission<br>
incorporating the disclosed park-by-wirc subsystem is also provided.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0022]	Referring to the drawings wherein like characters represent the same or<br>
corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is seen in Figure 1 a<br>
povvertrain 10 having an engine 12. an electrically variable hybrid transmission 14.<br>
and a conventional final drive 16.<br>
[0023]	The engine  12 is a conventional internal combustion engine.    The<br>
electrically variable hybrid transmission 14 includes a planetary gear arrangement<br>
having an input shaft 18, an output shaft 20, three planetary gcarscts 22, 24, and 26,<br>
four torque transmitting mechanisms Cl, C2, C3, and C4, and an electro-hydraulic<br>
control system 28. The torque transmitting mechanisms C2 and C4 are fluid-operated<br>
rotating clutch-type devices, while the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl and C3 are<br>
fluid-operated stationary clutch or brake devices.    The selective engagement and<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
6<br>
disengagement of the torque transmitting devices is controlled by an electro-hydraulic<br>
control system 28, which is shown in figures 2a and 2b.<br>
[0024]	Further incorporated into the electrically variable hybrid transmission<br>
14 is a pair of electrical power units or motor/generators 30 or (A) and 32 or (B) that<br>
are controlled by an electronic control unit 34. The electronic control unit 34 is<br>
connected with the electrical power unit 30 through three electrical conductors 36, 37.<br>
and 38, and is connected with the electrical power unit 32 through three electrical<br>
conductors 40, 41, and 42. The electronic control unit 34 is also in electrical<br>
communication with an electrical storage device 44, which is connected with the<br>
electronic control unit 34 through a pair of electrical conductors 46 and 48. The<br>
electrical storage device 44 is generally one or more electrical batteries.<br>
[0025]	The electrical power units 30 and 32 are preferably motor/generator<br>
units, which can operate as a power supplier or as a power generator. When operating<br>
as a motor or power supplier, the electrical power units 30 and 32 will supply power<br>
to the electrically variable hybrid transmission 14. When operating as generators, one<br>
of the electrical power units 30 and 32 will take electrical power from the<br>
transmission 14, and the electronic control unit 34 will either distribute the power to<br>
the electrical storage device 44 or distribute the power to the other one of the power<br>
units 30 and 32, which will be operating as a motor at that time.<br>
[0026]	The electronic control unit 34 receives a number of electrical signals<br>
from the vehicle and transmission 14. such as engine speed, throttle demand, vehicle<br>
speed, to name a few. These electrical signals are used as input signals for a<br>
programmable digital computer, which is incorporated within the electronic control<br>
unit 34. The computer is then effective to distribute the electrical power as required<br>
to permit the operation of the electrically variable hybrid transmission 14 in a<br>
controlled manner.<br>
[0027]	The planetary gear arrangement, as shown in figure 1, provides four<br>
forward speed ratios or ranges between the input shaft 18 and the output shaft 20. In<br>
the first forward range, the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl and C4 are engaged.<br>
In the second forward range, the torque transmitting mechanisms C1 and C2 are<br>
engaged.   In the third forward range, the torque transmitting mechanisms C2 and C4<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
7<br>
are engaged. In the fourth forward range, the torque transmitting mechanisms C2 and<br>
C3 arc engaged. The gearing also provides a neutral condition when the torque<br>
transmitting mechanisms Cl, C2, C3 and C4 arc disengaged. An electrically variable<br>
low mode of operation is provided wherein the torque transmitting mechanism Cl is<br>
engaged, and an electrically variable high mode of operation is provided wherein the<br>
torque transmitting mechanism C2 is engaged.<br>
[0028]	The powertrain 10 may also operate in a purely electric mode.   The<br>
engine off, electric low speed mode of operation is facilitated by engaging the Cl<br>
torque transmitting mechanism. The powertrain 10 has two speed ranges of drive-<br>
home capabilities within the electrically variable hybrid transmission 14 in the event<br>
that the electro-hydraulic control system 28 undergoes a malfunction or<br>
discontinuance of electrical power. In the electrical power off drive home modes, the<br>
electro-hydraulic control system 28 defaults to an electrically variable low mode of<br>
operation wherein the torque transmitting mechanism Cl is engaged, and an<br>
electrically variable high mode of operation wherein the torque transmitting<br>
mechanism C2 is engaged. The electrically variable hybrid transmission 14 is capable<br>
of operating in a parallel and series reverse mode of operation. In the parallel reverse<br>
mode, the electrically variable hybrid transmission 14 operates in an electrically<br>
variable low mode of operation wherein the torque transmitting mechanism Cl is<br>
engaged. Alternately, in the series reverse mode, the torque transmitting mechanisms<br>
Cl and C4 are engaged while a dog clutch is disengaged.<br>
[0029]	The electro-hydraulic control system 28 includes an electronic control<br>
unit (ECU) and a hydraulic control unit (HYD). The HCU incorporates a digital<br>
computer that is programmable to provide electrical signals to the hydraulic portion of<br>
the electro-hydraulic control system 28 to establish the engagement and<br>
disengagement of the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl, C2. C3. and C4. figures<br>
2a through 3b show the electro-hydraulic control system 28 in detail. As shown in<br>
Figures 2a through 3b, the hydraulic portion of the electro-hydraulic control system<br>
28 includes an engine driven hydraulic pump 50, such as a fixed displacement pump,<br>
that draws fluid from the reservoir 52 for delivery to a main passage 54.  Alternately,<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
8<br>
an electrically controlled hydraulic pump 56 is provided for operation in the electric<br>
mode. A check valve 58 operates to selectively distribute pressurized fluid to the<br>
main passage 54 depending upon which pump 50 or 56 is operating. A pressure relief<br>
valve 60 is provided in fluid communication with the outlet of the hydraulic pump 50<br>
to guard against over pressurization of the main passage 54. Likewise, a pressure<br>
relief valve 62 is provided in fluid communication with the outlet of the electrically<br>
controlled hydraulic pump 56 to guard against over pressurization of the main passage<br>
54. The pressure relief valves 60 and 62 will exhaust fluid though a passage 64<br>
should an over pressurized condition manifest itself within the main passage 54. The<br>
main passage 54 is in fluid communication with an electronic transmission range<br>
selection (ETRS) valve 66, a line regulator valve 65, a dog clutch relay valve 68. an<br>
actuator feed regulator valve 70, a damper lock-out clutch trim valve 72, a trim valve<br>
74, a trim valve 76, and a trim valve 78.<br>
[0030]	The ETRS valve 66 operates to selectively communicate pressurized<br>
fluid from the main passage 54 to an actuator 80 of a park-by-wire subsystem 81 via a<br>
passage 82. The park-by-wire subsystem 81 is internally contained within the<br>
transmission 14 of Figure 1. When the ETRS valve 66 is in the pressure set position.<br>
the pressurized fluid within the main passage 54 will be introduced to the actuator 80<br>
via the passage 82. When the fluid pressure within the actuator 80 is sufficient to<br>
overcome the bias of a spring 84, a piston 86. interconnected with a park pawl<br>
mechanism 88, will move within the actuator 80 thereby disengaging the park pawl<br>
mechanism 88, as shown in Figure 3a. When the ETRS valve 66 is in the spring set<br>
position, shown in Figure 2a, a land 92 will block the flow of pressurized fluid from<br>
the main passage 54, and the passage 82 will exhaust through passage 64. The spring<br>
84 operates to bias the piston 86 to effect engagement of the park pawl mechanism 88.<br>
A latching solenoid 93 is operable to maintain the park pawl mechanism 88 of the<br>
park-by-wire subsystem 81 in the out-of-park condition, as shown in Figure 3a. in the<br>
absence of hydraulic pressure to the actuator 80. The park-by-wire subsystem 81 will<br>
be discussed in greater detail hercinbelow with reference to Figures 4 through 8.<br>
[0031]	The line regulator valve 65 establishes the pressure within the main<br>
passage 54, and when that pressure is satisfied, fluid is delivered through a passage<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
9<br>
94, which subsequently splits to a passage 94A and a passage 94B. The passage 94A<br>
delivers pressurized fluid to a cooler regulator valve 96. Upon exiting the cooler<br>
regulator valve 96, the fluid passes into a cooler 98 and/or a cooler bypass valve 100.<br>
The cooler bypass valve 100 is operable to provide fluid How in the event that fluid<br>
passage through the cooler 98 is blocked. The fluid from the cooler 98 and/or cooler<br>
bypass valve 100 is then distributed to a lubrication system 102 of the electrically<br>
variable hybrid transmission 14. An orifice 104 and an orifice 106 may be provided<br>
for fluid flow control purposes.<br>
[0032]	The   dog   clutch   relay   valve   68   operates   to   selectively   provide<br>
pressurized fluid from the main passage 54 to a dog clutch 108. The dog clutch 108 is<br>
a spring engaged clutch and is disengaged with the application of fluid pressure. The<br>
electrically variable hybrid transmission 14 employs the dog clutch 108 to selectively<br>
switch between a parallel reverse mode, wherein the dog clutch 108 is engaged, and a<br>
series reverse mode, wherein the dog clutch 108 is disengaged. When the dog clutch<br>
relay valve 68 is in a spring set position, shown in Figure 2a, the pressurized fluid<br>
within the dog clutch 108 will exhaust allowing the dog clutch 108 to engage.<br>
Alternately, when the dog clutch relay valve 68 is in a pressure set position, as shown<br>
in Figure 3a, the dog clutch 108 will disengage in response to pressurized fluid within<br>
the main passage 54.<br>
[0033]	The actuator feed regulator valve 70 reduces the pressure within the<br>
main passage 54 to a control pressure in passage 1 10. The fluid within passage 1 10 is<br>
communicated to a plurality of solenoid valves 112. 114, 116, 118, 120. 122. 124, and<br>
126. The solenoid valves 124 and 126 arc on/off type solenoid valves, while the<br>
solenoid valves 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, and 122 are variable pressure type solenoid<br>
valves. The solenoid valves 116, 118, and 122 are normally high or normally open<br>
type solenoid valves, while the remaining solenoid valves 112. 114, 120. 124. and 126<br>
are normally low or normally closed type solenoid valves. A normally open solenoid<br>
valve will distribute pressurized fluid or an output pressure in the absence ol' an<br>
electrical signal to the solenoid.<br>
[0034]	The solenoid valve 112 is operable to provide an output pressure in<br>
passage 128 that controls the bias pressure or control pressure on the damper lock-out<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
10<br>
clutch trim valve 72. The damper lock-out clutch trim valve 72 is operable to<br>
selectively engage a damper lock-out clutch 130 when Lransitioning into and out oi<br>
the electric mode of operation.<br>
[0035]	The solenoid valve 114 is operable to provide an output pressure in<br>
passage 132 that controls the bias pressure on the trim valve 74. The solenoid valve<br>
116 is operable to provide an output pressure in passage 134 that controls the pressure<br>
bias on the trim valve 76. The solenoid valve 118 is operable to provide an output<br>
pressure in passage 136 that controls the pressure bias on the trim valve 78.<br>
Additionally, the output pressure in passage 136 controls the pressure bias on a boost<br>
or multiplex valve 138 and is further communicated to a logic valve 140. With the<br>
output passage 136 pressurized, the boost valve 138 is biased to a pressure set<br>
position, as shown in Figure 3b. Alternately, with the output passage 136 exhausted,<br>
the boost valve 138 will move to a spring set position, as shown in figure 2b. The<br>
trim valves 72, 74, 76. and 78 are selectively biased into a second position or a<br>
pressure set position by fluid pressure within their respective passages 128. 132, 134,<br>
and 136. When the passages 128, 132, 134, and 136 exhaust, the respective trim<br>
valves 72, 74, 76, and 78 move to a first position or a spring set position.<br>
Additionally, the trim valves 72, 74, 76, and 78 have a trim or pressure regulation<br>
position.<br>
[0036]	The solenoid valve  120 is operable to selectively provide an output<br>
pressure in passage 147 that communicates pressurized fluid to the boost valve 138.<br>
The solenoid valve 122 is operable to provide an output pressure in passage 148 that<br>
controls pressure bias to the line regulator valve 65. The solenoid valve 122. by<br>
modulating the fluid pressure within passage 148. is operable to vary the operating<br>
characteristics of the line regulator valve 65 thereby modulating the pressure value<br>
within the main passage 54 for torque based pressure control.<br>
[0037]	The solenoid valve 124 is operable to provide an output pressure in<br>
passage 142 that controls the pressure bias on the logic valve 140. Additionally, the<br>
output pressure in passage 142 communicates pressurized fluid to the E'l'RS valve 66<br>
and is operable to selectively bias the ETRS valve 66 into a pressure set position by<br>
engaging a land 141.  The logic valve 140 has a differential area 143 operable to latch<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
11<br>
the logic valve 140 in a pressure set position when the torque transmitting mechanism<br>
C2 is engaged and electrical power to the solenoid valve 124 is interrupted.<br>
Pressurized fluid within passage 136 provides the differential area 143 with the force<br>
necessary to bias the logic valve 140 in a pressure set position. The solenoid valve<br>
126 is operable to provide an output pressure in passage 144 that controls the pressure<br>
bias on a logic valve 146. The output pressure in passage 144 is also communicated<br>
to the trim valve 74 and the trim valve 76. The logic valves 140 and 146 each have a<br>
first position or a spring set position, and a second position or a pressure set position.<br>
[0038]	The logic valves 140 and 146 multiplex the trim valves 74, 76. and 78<br>
to provide control to the four torque transmitting mechanisms Cl, C2, C3. and C4.<br>
The logic valve 140 selectively communicates pressurized fluid to control the<br>
engagement of the torque transmitting mechanisms Cl and C2. While the logic valve<br>
146 selectively communicates pressurized fluid to control the engagement of the<br>
torque transmitting mechanisms C3 and C4. The multiplexed trim valve<br>
configuration also provides control of fluid flow to effect cooling of the<br>
motor/generator A 30 and motor/generator B 32.<br>
[0039]	The trim valve 74 selectively communicates pressurized fluid through<br>
an outlet passage 150 to the logic valve 146. The outlet passage 150 communicates<br>
pressurized fluid to a passage 151 through a flow control orifice 153. The passage<br>
151 is operable to provide pressurized fluid to bias the ETRS valve 66 into the<br>
pressure set position. The trim valve 76 selectively communicates pressurized fluid<br>
through an outlet passage 152 to both logic valves 140 and 146. A passage 155 is in<br>
selective fluid communication with the trim valves 74 and 76. The passage 155 is<br>
operable to exhaust the passage 150 when the trim valve 74 is in the spring set<br>
position. The passage 155 exhausts the passage 152 when the trim valve 76 is in the<br>
spring set position. An outlet passage 154 of the trim valve 78 selectively<br>
communicates pressurized fluid to the logic valve 140. Additionally, the trim valve<br>
78 selectively communicates pressurized fluid to the boost valve 138 through an<br>
outlet passage 156. The logic valves 140 and 146 arc in selective fluid<br>
communication with one another through passages 158, 160, and 162. A passage 164<br>
is provided internally within the logic valve 146 and is operable to exhaust fluid<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
12<br>
within passage 158 when the logic valve 146 is in the spring set position. Alternately,<br>
when the logic valve 146 is in the pressure set position, the passage 164 is operable to<br>
exhaust a passage 166. The passage 166 is in fluid communication with the logic<br>
valve 146 and the trim valves 74 and 76. In addition, the passage 166 communicates<br>
with passage 110 through a series of flow restricting orifices 168.<br>
[0040]	A backfill passage 170 is in fluid communication with the actuator<br>
feed regulator valve 70, the damper lock-out clutch trim valve 72, the trim valve 78,<br>
the logic valve 140, and the logic valve 146. The actuator (bed fluid pressure within<br>
passage 110 bleeds fluid to the backfill passage 170 through a series of flow<br>
restricting orifices 172. The fluid pressure within the backfill passage 170 is<br>
maintained at a value of approximately two pounds per square inch (psi) by an<br>
exhaust backfill pressure relief valve 173 to prevent air from entering the electro-<br>
hydraulic control system 28.<br>
[0041]	An exhaust passage 174 is in communication with the damper lock-out<br>
clutch trim valve 72 and the trim valves 74. 76, and 78. A feedback passage 176 is<br>
operable to provide a force balance when the damper lock-out trim valve is in a<br>
regulation or trim position. Likewise, a feedback passage 178 is operable lo provide a<br>
force balance when the trim valve 74 is in a trim position. A feedback passage 180 is<br>
operable to provide a force balance when the trim valve 76 is in a trim position. A<br>
feedback passage 182 is operable to provide a force balance when the trim valve 78 is<br>
in the trim position and the boost valve 138 is in the spring set position. Alternately,<br>
when the boost valve 138 is in the pressure set position, the feedback passage 182 is<br>
exhausted through the passage 205.<br>
[0042]	The passage 94B communicates fluid to a passage 184 though a series<br>
of flow restricting orifices 185. By pressurizing passage 184. the motor/generator A<br>
30 is provided with a measured amount of fluid for cooling. A one-way check valve<br>
188 is provided such that the pressurized fluid within the passage 184 is prevented<br>
from entering passage 190. A spring return check ball 187 is operable to provide<br>
additional fluid flow to the motor/generator A 30 when a passage 189 is pressurized.<br>
The passage 94A communicates fluid to a passage 192 though a series of flow<br>
restricting orifices 194.   By pressurizing passage 192, the motor/generator 13 32 is<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
13<br>
provided with a measured amount of cooling fluid.   A one-way check valve 198 is<br>
provided such that the pressurized fluid within the passage 192 is prevented l'rom<br>
entering passage 190. A spring return check ball 197 is operable to provide additional<br>
fluid flow to cool the motor/generator B 32 when a passage 199 is pressurized.<br>
[0043]	Four pressure sensitive switches or pressure switches PS1, PS2. PS3.<br>
and PS4 are provided for position detection of the trim valves 74, 76. and 78 and the<br>
logic valves 140 and 146. The ability to monitor the above mentioned valves and<br>
detect any change, or lack of change, in valve state is of importance in order to<br>
provide continuous and reliable operation of the electrically variable hybrid<br>
transmission 14.<br>
[0044]	The electro-hydraulic control system 28 is capable of detecting state<br>
changes of the trim valves 74, 76, and 78 and the logic valves 140 and 146 by<br>
multiplexing the four pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3. and PS4. The pressure<br>
switches PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4 are disposed in selective fluid communication with<br>
the logic valve 140 and the trim valves 76, 78, and 74, respectively. Traditionally,<br>
five pressure switches, one switch for each valve, would have been used to determine<br>
trim valve state changes.<br>
[0045]	Detection of a state change, or failure to change, of the logic valve 140<br>
is accomplished through stand-alone detection using the pressure switch PS1. With<br>
the logic valve 140 in the spring set position, the pressure switch PS1 will exhaust to<br>
the backfill passage 170. When the logic valve 140 moves to a pressure set position, a<br>
land 200 will block the pressure switch PS1 from exhausting to passage 170. Instead,<br>
the passage 110 will communicate pressurized fluid to the pressure switch PS1<br>
through orifices 172. Detection of a state change, or failure to change, of the trim<br>
valve 78 is accomplished through stand-alone detection using the pressure switch<br>
PS3. With the trim valve 78 in the spring set position, the passage 110 will<br>
communicate pressurized fluid to the pressure switch PS1. When the trim valve 78<br>
moves to a pressure set position, a land 202 will block the passage 110 thereby<br>
allowing the pressure switch PS3 to exhaust via passage 205.<br>
[0046]	Detection of a state change or failure to change, of the logic valve 146<br>
and the trim valves 76 and 74 is achieved by multiplexing the pressure switches PS2<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
14<br>
and PS4. To achieve this, passage 166 is disposed in fluid communication with the<br>
trim valves 74 and 76 and the logic valve 146. Additionally, the passage 144 is<br>
disposed in fluid communication with the trim valves 74 and 76 and the logic valve<br>
146. The passages 166 and 144 are selectively pressurized based on the position of<br>
the logic valve 146. When the logic valve 146 is in the spring set position, the<br>
passage 166 is pressurized with fluid from passage 110 through orifices 168.<br>
Alternately, when the logic valve 146 is in the pressure set position, the passage 164<br>
within the logic valve 146 will exhaust the fluid within the passage 166. When the<br>
solenoid valve 126 is energized, the logic valve 146 moves to a pressure set position<br>
and the passage 144 will pressurize. Alternately, when the solenoid valve 126 is de-<br>
energized, the logic valve 146 will move to a spring set position and the passage 144<br>
will exhaust.<br>
[0047]	The multiplexed pressure switch arrangement provides a reversal in<br>
states of pressurization between the passage 166 and 144. For example, if the logic<br>
valve 146 is in the pressure set position, the passage 144 will be pressurized and the<br>
passage 166 will exhaust. Alternately, if the logic valve 146 is in the spring set<br>
position, the passage 166 will be pressurized and the passage 144 will be exhausted.<br>
This event will be indicated through a change in logic state of both of the pressure<br>
switches PS2 and PS4 irrespective of the position of their respective trim valves 76<br>
and 74.<br>
[0048]	The boost valve  138 operates as a multiplex  valve in the present<br>
invention. The solenoid valve 120 selectively pressurizes passage 147. which is in<br>
fluid communication with the boost valve 138. The boost valve operates to<br>
selectively direct the pressurized fluid to one of a passage 204 and a passage 206.<br>
The passage 204 is operable to communicate pressurized fluid to a spring pocket 208<br>
of the ETRS valve 66. The passage 206 is operable to communicate pressurized fluid<br>
to bias the dog clutch relay valve 68 into a pressure set position. When in the spring<br>
set position, the boost valve 138 will direct pressurized fluid within passage 147 into<br>
passage 204 enabling control of the ETRS valve 66. When in the pressure set<br>
position, the boost valve 138 will direct pressurized fluid within the passage 147 into<br>
passage 206 enabling control of the dog clutch relay valve 68.<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
15<br>
[0049]	When a park condition, as shown in Figures 2a and 2b. is commanded<br>
the solenoid valve 120 will pressurize the passage 204, via the passage 147. thereby<br>
pressurizing the spring pocket 208 of the ETRS valve 66. The pressurized fluid<br>
within the spring pocket 208 will de-latch the ETRS valve and move it into the spring<br>
set position, as shown in Figure 2a. With the ETRS valve 66 in the spring set<br>
position, the flow of pressurized fluid within the main passage 54 to passage 82 is<br>
blocked by the land 92. The passage 82 will exhaust through passage 64 allowing the<br>
spring 84 to bias the piston 86 of the actuator 80. With the actuator 80 in the spring<br>
biased position, the park pawl mechanism 88 is engaged.<br>
[0050]	When disengagement of the park pawl mechanism 88 is desired, the<br>
fluid pressure within the passage 204 is exhausted via solenoid valve 120. The ETRS<br>
valve may then be placed in the pressure set position in one of two ways. The trim<br>
valve 74 may selectively bias the ETRS valve 66 into a pressure set position by<br>
pressurizing the passage 151 via passage 150. The trim valve 74 must be in the trim<br>
or pressure set position to control the ETRS valve 66. Additionally, the solenoid<br>
valve 124 may selectively pressurize the passage 142 causing fluid pressure to act on<br>
the differential area formed on the land 141. Once pressure within passage 151 and/or<br>
passage 142 is of a large enough magnitude to overcome the spring bias of the ETRS<br>
valve 66, the ETRS valve 66 will move to a pressure set position, as shown in Figure<br>
3a. The ETRS valve 66 will remain latched in the pressure set position by the<br>
pressurized fluid within the main passage 54, until de-latched by increasing the<br>
pressure within the spring pocket 208 via passage 204. The pressurized fluid within<br>
the main passage 54 will pressurize the passage 82. thereby biasing the piston 86 of<br>
the actuator 80 against the force of the spring 84. With the actuator 80 in the pressure<br>
set position, as shown in Figure 3a, the park pawl mechanism 88 will disengage.<br>
[0051]	The electro-hydraulic control system 28 shown in Figures 2a through<br>
3b enable two modes of reverse operation. The parallel reverse mode employs the<br>
torque transmitting mechanism C l and the electrical power units 30 and 32 to effect<br>
movement of the vehicle. A series reverse mode employs the torque transmitting<br>
mechanisms Cl and C4 to effect movement the vehicle. The scries reverse mode<br>
requires the dog clutch 108 to be disengaged.   The dog clutch 108 of the present<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
16<br>
invention is spring engaged; therefore, selectively pressurizing the dog clutch 108<br>
with fluid will effect disengagement. In all modes of operation, other than the series<br>
reverse mode, the dog clutch 108 will remain engaged.<br>
[0052]	Figures 3a and 3b illustrate the electro-hydraulic control system 28 in<br>
series reverse mode of operation. In this mode, the boost valve 138 is placed in the<br>
pressure set position enabling the solenoid valve 120 to selectively pressurize the<br>
passage 206. The fluid pressure within the passage 206 will operate to bias the dog<br>
clutch relay valve 68 into a pressure set position. With the dog clutch relay valve 68<br>
in a pressure set position, the pressurized fluid within the main passage 54 is<br>
communicated to the dog clutch 108 to effect disengagement. Additionally,<br>
pressurized fluid is communicated to the passage 190 to increase fluid flow to cool the<br>
motor/generator A 30 and the motor/generator B 32. When the dog clutch relay valve<br>
68 returns to a spring set position, by exhausting the passage 206. the pressurized<br>
fluid within the dog clutch 108 will exhaust and the dog clutch 108 will engage. The<br>
passage 206 may be exhausted by the solenoid valve 120 (if the boost valve 138<br>
remains in the pressure set position) or by placing the boost valve 138 in the spring set<br>
position.<br>
[0053]	The boost valve 138 is placed in the pressure set position for the<br>
electrically variable low mode of operation, first forward range, and second forward<br>
range transmission operating modes. Therefore, the solenoid valve is operable to<br>
control the dog clutch relay valve 68. For the third forward range, fourth forward<br>
range, and electrically variable high mode, the boost valve 138 is in the spring set<br>
position enabling the solenoid valve 120 to control the ETRS valve 66. However, in<br>
all of the aforementioned modes of operation the solenoid valve 120 will be<br>
commanded off.<br>
[0054]	Referring now to Figures 4 and 5, the park-by-wire subsystem 81  is<br>
schematically depicted in greater detail. The park-by-wire subsystem 81 includes a<br>
lever 210 rotatably mounted upon a shaft 212. The lever 210 includes a first end 214.<br>
having an actuator rod 216 mounted thereto, and a second end 218 mounted to a link<br>
220. The actuator rod 216 is operable to selectively engage the park pawl mechanism<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
17<br>
88. The park pawl mechanism 88 includes a park pawl arm 222 and a gear 224. The<br>
gear 224 is typically mounted to, or formed integrally with, the output shaft 20 of<br>
Figure 1. The park pawl mechanism 88 is in a park mode or condition when the park<br>
pawl arm 222 is in engagement with the gear 224, as shown in Figure 4, and in an out-<br>
of-park mode or condition when the park pawl arm 222 is out of engagement with the<br>
gear 224, as shown in Figure 5.<br>
[0055]	The actuator 80 is operable to bias the lever 210 via the link 220 in<br>
response to command signals from a command source 226, such as the FRTS valve<br>
66 of Figures 2a and 3a. The latching solenoid 93 is operable to maintain the position<br>
of the lever 210 such that the park pawl mechanism 88 is retained in the out-ol-park<br>
position in the absence of command signals from the command source 226. First and<br>
second Flail effect switches 228 and 230, respectively, cooperate with the lever 210 to<br>
signal the rotational position of the lever 210. Spring 84 is provided within the<br>
actuator 80 and is operable to bias the link 220 in the absence of a command signal<br>
from the command source 226. A switch 234 is provided to monitor command<br>
signals from the command source 226 to the actuator 80. while a sensor 236 is<br>
provided to monitor the performance of the actuator 80.<br>
[0056]	With the park-by-wire subsystem 81 in the park condition, as shown in<br>
Figure 4, no command signals are provided by the command source 226 such that the<br>
spring 84 biases the link 220 leftward, as viewed in Figure 4. such that the lever 210<br>
is biased in a clockwise direction. As a result, the lever 210 urges the actuator rod<br>
216 rightward to bias the park pawl arm 222 into engagement with the gear 224.<br>
thereby placing the park pawl mechanism 88 in the park condition. The first and<br>
second Hall effect switches 228 and 230 signal that the lever 210 is in the park<br>
position.<br>
[0057]	With the park-by-wire subsystem 81 in the out-ol-park condition, as<br>
shown in Figure 5, command signals are provided by the command source 226 such<br>
that the actuator 80 biases the link 220 rightward, as viewed in Figure 5, such that the<br>
lever 210 is biased in a clockwise direction. As a result, the lever 210 biases the<br>
actuator rod 216 leftward to allow the park pawl arm 222 to disengage the gear 224,<br>
thereby placing the park pawl mechanism 88 in the out-of-park condition.   The first<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
18<br>
and second Hall effect switches 228 and 230 signal that the lever 210 is in the out-of-<br>
park position. With the park-by-wire subsystem 81 in the out-of-park condition, the<br>
latching solenoid 93 may be engaged to maintain the park pawl mechanism 88 in the<br>
out-of-park condition. A torsion spring 238 may be provide in conjunction with, or in<br>
lieu of, the spring 84 such that the lever 210 is biased into the park position in the<br>
absence of a control signal from the command source 226.<br>
[0058]	Referring to Figures 6 and 7 there is shown an alternate embodiment of<br>
the park-by-wirc subsystem 81 of Figures 4 and 5 generally indicated at 81 A. The<br>
park-by-wire subsystem 81A is similar in operation and construction to that of park-<br>
by-wire subsystem 81. However, the park-by-wire subsystem 81A includes actuator<br>
80A which is operable to bias the link 220 leftward, as viewed in Figure 6. to effect<br>
clockwise rotation of the lever 210. In so doing, the actuator rod 216 is biased<br>
right ward into engagement with the park pawl arm 220 to place the park pawl<br>
mechanism 88 in the park condition. Alternately, in response to command signals<br>
provided by the command source 226, the actuator 80A biases the link 220 rightward,<br>
as viewed in Figure 7, such that the lever 210 is biased in a counter-clockwise<br>
direction. As a result, the lever 210 biases the actuator rod 216 leftward to allow the<br>
park pawl arm 222 to disengage the gear 224. thereby placing the park pawl<br>
mechanism 88 in the out-of-park condition. The lever 210 may be characterized as a<br>
'lost motion'1 lever in that the lever 210 may be manually rotated, through external<br>
force, into the out-of-park position, irrespective of the force exerted by the actuator 80<br>
or 80A, thereby allowing the link 220 to translate with respect to the lever 210.<br>
[0059]	Referring now to Figure 8 there is shown a schematic diagrammatic<br>
illustration of a control system 240 configured to control the park-by-wire subsystem<br>
81 of Figures 4 and 5 and the park-by-wire subsystem 81A of Figures 6 and 7. The<br>
control system 240 includes a first control unit 242 and a second control unit 244.<br>
Each of the first and second control units 242 and 244 may be incorporated within the<br>
control unit 34 of Figure 1, or may be separate. The first and second control units 242<br>
and 244 communicate with each other over line 246. The second control unit 244 is<br>
incorporated into the control system 240 for control, monitoring, and diagnostic<br>
redundancies.   The first and second control units 242 and 244 cooperate to provide<br><br>
GP-308921-PTH-CD<br>
19<br>
control, monitoring, and diagnostic functions for the park-by-wire subsystem 81 or<br>
81A. The first control unit 242 receives signals from the first Hall effect switch 228<br>
over line 248 to monitor the position of the lever 210. Additionally, the first control<br>
unit 242 receives signals from the switch 234 over line 250 to monitor the command<br>
signals provided to the actuator 80 or 80A, shown in Figures 4 through 5 and 6<br>
through 7, respectively, by the command source 226. The first control unit 242 is<br>
operable to control the command source 226 via line 252. As such the switch 234<br>
provides a feedback signal over line 250 to the first control unit 242.<br>
[0060]	The second control unit 244 receives signals from the second Hall<br>
effect switch 230 over line 254 to monitor the position of the lever 210. Additionally,<br>
the sensor 236 provides signals over line 256 to the second control unit 244. such that<br>
the operation of the actuator 80 or 80A may be monitored. The second control unit<br>
244 is operable to provide command signals over line 258 to control operation of the<br>
latching solenoid 93.<br>
[0061]	While the discussion hereinabove has focused on an actuator 80 and<br>
80A that is hydraulically actuated (i.e. a hydraulic servo), an electrically actuated<br>
actuator, such as a motor, may be employed while remaining within the scope of that<br>
which is claimed. In such a case, a current monitoring device would be employed as<br>
the switch 234 and a displacement monitoring device would be employed as the<br>
sensor 236. Furthermore the actuator 80 or 80A may be a two-way or dual acting<br>
actuator operable to bias the lever 210 both into and out of the park position thereby<br>
obviating the need for the spring 84 and/or torsion spring 238.<br>
[0062]	While   the   best  modes   for  carrying   out   the   invention   have   been<br>
described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will<br>
recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention<br>
