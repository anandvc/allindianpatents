				<td>LUMINOUS ELEMENT COMPRISING AT LEAST ONE SUBSTRATE AND<br>
ONE LIGHT-EMITTING COATING<br>
The invention relates to a flat luminous<br>
element comprising at least one substrate and one<br>
coating, applied onto the surface of the latter and<br>
emitting light, that comprises several luminous<br>
elements capable of being separately electrically<br>
connected next to one another, in different parts of<br>
the surface, so as to obtain different luminous<br>
effects.<br>
Document DE-C1 101 26 868 discloses a flat<br>
luminous element with these features that is<br>
essentially formed by a layered element composed of two<br>
substrates and of a layer of adhesive bonding these<br>
together, the luminous element itself being disposed in<br>
the plane of the adhesive layer. It is formed such that<br>
only partial (opaque) surfaces emit light, whereas<br>
light can pass through other partial surfaces. Several<br>
luminous elements can be provided that are capable of<br>
being separately connected next to one another in<br>
different parts of the surface, where the electrodes<br>
and connections conducting the current can be masked in<br>
a simple manner under the opaque coating. In such a<br>
case, the electrode through which the light passes can<br>
optionally be used as a common electrode (ground) for<br>
all the luminous elements. Different luminous effects<br>
can thus be obtained, or also the luminous intensity<br>
controlled in several stages (depending on the<br>
respective luminous surface area and possibly its<br>
color).<br>
A separate interior space lighting element in<br>
a motor vehicle can be replaced as automobile roofing<br>
substrate by a partially transparent window substrate<br>
used with the luminous element installed and for a<br>
sufficiently large surface area or high enough luminous<br>
intensity, a certain amount of light still being able<br>
to penetrate from above through the glass roof during<br>
daylight.<br><br>
Document DE-A1-101 08 302 describes another<br>
flat luminous element in which the light emitting<br>
surfaces can be disposed on a frame of a transparent<br>
cover, such as for example a sunroof of an automobile.<br>
Integration of luminous elements mounted on films in a<br>
layered element is not included here.<br>
Document EP-A2-1 053 910 also discloses an<br>
interior space lighting for vehicles based on<br>
electroluminescent flat luminous films. These can be<br>
disposed anywhere in a vehicle. A differentiated<br>
control of the various areas of the surface of a<br>
luminous element is not disclosed here.<br>
An object of the invention is to find another<br>
field of application for a flat luminous element of<br>
this nature.<br>
According to the invention, this problem is<br>
solved by the features of claim 1. The features of the<br>
dependent claims present advantageous embodiments of<br>
this invention.<br>
According to the invention, the flat luminous<br>
element is now augmented by at least one separate<br>
luminous element which, by comparison with a rather<br>
diffuse emission from the rest of the luminous field,<br>
emits a directed light beam. This element can be<br>
disposed preferably in the same plane as the flat<br>
luminous element, therefore either on the surface of a<br>
single substrate used as a support medium, or inside a<br>
composite of two substrates. The composition, just as<br>
the disposition, of the flat luminous element is of<br>
secondary importance in this case; it can, for example,<br>
be a full-area lighting element, or one in the form of<br>
a frame or structured in a grid pattern.<br>
The separate luminous element can, in<br>
principle, always be connected at the same time as the<br>
flat lighting unit. Preferably, however, it will be<br>
possible to connect or disconnect it separately, and<br>
the connection means could just as easily be disposed<br>
close to each separate luminous element (local control)<br>
as remotely from them. It can also be arranged, for<br><br>
example, that they be connected automatically when a<br>
vehicle stops.<br>
In the case of a local control, sensor or<br>
touch screen switches, known per se and which are<br>
sensitive to touch or proximity, could be used. By<br>
placing, for example, a finger on the control surface,<br>
the corresponding separate luminous element could be<br>
activated and then deactivated by repeating the<br>
operation. The current feed for these switches and the<br>
corresponding switching and control elements disposed<br>
inside or outside of the flat luminous element could,<br>
if required, even be attached to that for the luminous<br>
element itself. Where necessary, such switching<br>
elements could also even be integrated into a layered<br>
element and thus need not necessarily protrude above a<br>
smooth light-emitting surface.<br>
One especially preferred field of application<br>
of such a separate luminous element with concentrated<br>
lignt is a reading lamp integrated, in a particularly<br>
discrete form, into a smooth surface flat element such<br>
as, for example, a vehicle roofing substrate or a<br>
sunroof that allows an occupant to, for example, study<br>
or read a road map in the darkened interior space of a<br>
vehicle without thus substantially disturbing/dazzling<br>
other occupants of the vehicle. A separate reading<br>
lamp, such as is provided in addition to the normal<br>
vehicle interior space lighting in conventional<br>
vehicles, with the corresponding volume it occupies and<br>
its wiring, can thus be eliminated. With the<br>
configuration according to the invention, a<br>
particularly elegant and, moreover, also inexpensive<br>
solution is thus obtained. Other lighting or value-<br>
added applications may, of course, be fulfilled, for<br>
example the (automatic) targeted lighting of door-<br>
opening systems or of other functional elements in a<br>
vehicle.<br>
Clearly, such flat luminous elements are not<br>
only suitable for uses in vehicles, but they may<br>
equally well be used in buildings or, as the case may<br><br>
be, for room fittings in commercial premises or<br>
residences. For example, closet lighting may be<br>
mentioned, in which such a luminous element could be<br>
installed as a ceiling or even as an intermediate shelf<br>
and here it can provide, in addition to surface<br>
lighting of the interior space, locally accentuated<br>
lighting, for example of functional element, of special<br>
structure or design.<br>
The enhanced lighting power of the separate<br>
luminous element might, furthermore, be superimposed<br>
onto the surface lighting, in other words, in the<br>
"normal" state with the separate luminous element not<br>
connected, a lower luminous power might be emitted at<br>
this location when the flat luminous element as a whole<br>
is connected.<br>
This differentiated emission would, for<br>
example, be possible when, as in the state of the prior<br>
art cited in the introduction, the flat luminous<br>
emission is resolved into a grid or similar. The<br>
separate luminous element could then be incorporated<br>
into this same grid, or in other words its luminous<br>
flat elements could be inserted into parts of the grid<br>
surface heretofore unused as luminous surfaces.<br>
A higher density of light or a higher luminous<br>
power is naturally also obtained when the, or each,<br>
separate luminous element is disposed with the whole of<br>
its surface within a luminous surface that is,<br>
furthermore, patterned as a grid. In such a case, the<br>
same electroluminescent material as for the flat<br>
luminous element could be used.<br>
However, the possibility is, on the contrary,<br>
always open of using an especially powerful<br>
electroluminescent material for the, or each, separate<br>
luminous element.<br>
For orienting and concentrating the light<br>
emitted by the separate luminous element, according to<br>
a preferred embodiment, an optical device is provided<br>
in the region of the surface covered by the luminous<br>
element. This can be a simple lens, which is provided<br><br>
either directly on the luminous element or on or in a<br>
substrate covering the latter in the direction of the<br>
light emission. Such a lens could also be formed in a<br>
glass or plastic cover element or substrate (by<br>
grinding or pressing) or could also be placed in a<br>
cavity of the element as a separate part. This latter<br>
variant can be useful when the lensed face is placed on<br>
the inside within a layered element, such that the<br>
outside surface of the substrate can still be smooth.<br>
Preferably, however, a plane lens, which<br>
itself is very thin but which nevertheless provides a<br>
good concentration and orientation of the light, can be<br>
inserted in a particularly simple manner into a layered<br>
element. Such a plane lens, whether made of glass or<br>
plastic, could of course also be placed on the outside<br>
surface of the cover element or substrate.<br>
The required concentration and orientation of<br>
the light can also be obtained by means of a<br>
holographic element (spatial hologram) which is again<br>
disposed in said region of the surface of the separate<br>
luminous element and which is transparent to its light<br>
radiation. Such holographic elements can be fabricated<br>
in the form of films with microprisms that can provide<br>
a very precise orientation and concentration of the<br>
light for a negligible thickness. The latter can even<br>
provide particularly large deviation angles with<br>
respect to the normal emission direction perpendicular<br>
to the plane of the substrate (for this purpose, see<br>
for example DE-C1 195 12 864 or DE-C2 197 03 398) .<br>
A similar deviation and orientation behavior<br>
can be obtained with plane mirrors, which are also<br>
transparent to the light emitted by the luminous<br>
element, but which at the same time, depending on their<br>
design, become more or less transparent relative to the<br>
angle of incidence.<br>
The possibility of adjusting the oriented beam<br>
at will could be obtained at the expense of a given<br>
local elevation above the surface of the luminous<br>
element, but this could however provide a certain<br><br>
special effect. For this purpose, it would be necessary<br>
to place an optical device with mirrors, lenses or the<br>
like, which can be moved by hand or by means of a<br>
miniature remote control, on the outer surface of the<br>
luminous element at the point from which the separate<br>
luminous element emits.<br>
Other details and advantages of the object of<br>
the invention will become apparent in the drawings of<br>
an exemplary embodiment and in their detailed<br>
description that follows.<br>
In these drawings, which are simplified<br>
representations without any particular scale,<br>
Fig. 1 is a view of one embodiment in which<br>
a roofing element or substrate, with a lighting grid<br>
pattern over the whole surface in a manner known per<br>
se, comprises two separate luminous elements,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic cross-sectional<br>
view of Fig. 1 along the line II-II,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a variant in detail of a<br>
cross-sectional view as in Fig. 2, and<br>
Fig. 4 shows another variant in detail of a<br>
cross-sectional view as in Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a flat luminous element 1 of<br>
rectangular shape with an opaque frame 2 and luminous<br>
field 3. The latter is configured in a known manner in<br>
a grid pattern that is composed of surface sections<br>
that let the light through and opaque surface sections.<br>
This grid patterning is not however necessary for the<br>
operation. It can be replaced by a full surface<br>
configuration, if the partial transparence to light is<br>
not necessary or desired. The lighting function itself<br>
is obtained by electroluminescence in a manner also<br>
known per se. For a more precise description of the<br>
mode of operation of such elements, reference can be<br>
simply made to the state of the art mentioned in the<br>
introduction.<br>
Two separate luminous elements are provided on<br>
a longitudinal face of the luminous element 1. These<br>
elements can, as is shown here, partially or completely<br><br>
cover the opaque frame 2, or alternatively be situated<br>
entirely in the luminous field region 3 of the surface<br>
without covering or touching the frame 2. The separate<br>
luminous elements 4 are regions of enhanced luminous<br>
power or density.<br>
The luminous elements 4 can, of course, also<br>
be disposed asymmetrically.<br>
As can be better seen in Fig. 2, the flat<br>
luminous element 1 is fabricated in the form of a<br>
layered element with a first substrate 1.1, a second<br>
transparent substrate 1.2 and an adhesive layer 1.3<br>
that assembles the two substrates flat against each<br>
other. A flat electroluminescent element 3.1, which<br>
could be disposed on a separate support film and which<br>
forms the luminous field 3, is disposed in between the<br>
adhesive layer 1.3 and the substrate 1.2. The precise<br>
(multilayered) structure of this luminous element is<br>
here assumed to be known. It will only be pointed out<br>
that an upper surface electrode of this luminous<br>
element is indicated here by a horizontal dashed line,<br>
and that the luminous element is assembled<br>
horizontally, in a manner not shown in more detail<br>
here, also with the transparent substrate 1.2 (for<br>
example, by another thin adhesive layer).<br>
The separate luminous element 4 is located on<br>
the right-hand edge of the cross-sectional<br>
representation in the region of the opaque frame 2.<br>
This has a small cutout, as can also be seen in Fig. 1,<br>
in the region of its surface overlap (seen in vertical<br>
projection on the plane of the substrate 1.2) with the<br>
luminous element 4. Here, the latter is not grid<br>
patterned, as opposed to the luminous field 3, but has<br>
a full area such that it produces a higher density of<br>
light, even if the same electroluminescent coating is<br>
used as for the luminous field 3. In addition, an<br>
optical device 5 is provided in the form of a plane<br>
lens inserted within the layered element, which<br>
concentrates and orients the light emitted in a<br>
parallel direction by the separate luminous element 4,<br><br>
as is indicated schematically by a light cone 6. Here,<br>
the light is emitted practically perpendicular to the<br>
plane of the substrate.<br>
The situation in Fig. 3 is different, where an<br>
optical device 5' produces a light cone 6' that is<br>
greatly deviated with respect to the normal to the<br>
plane of the substrate. This optical device 5' is a<br>
hologram on a film that is bonded here to the outer<br>
surface of the substrate 1.2. This hologram could also<br>
be inserted into the layered element, like the plane<br>
lens 5. However, the refraction of the light at the<br>
transition between the substrate 1.2 and the outside<br>
air then needs to be compensated for or taken into<br>
account, if required.<br>
The structure shown in Fig. 4 represents an<br>
embodiment suited to this purpose, which can be seen as<br>
a combination of the embodiments in Figs. 2 and 3. In<br>
this case, the optical device 5' is situated on the<br>
inside. It is again used for the orientation and/or the<br>
concentration of the light emitted by the luminous<br>
element 4. In order to avoid total internal reflection<br>
at the layer interface (for example the glass-air<br>
interface) of the outer surface of the substrate 1.2<br>
(the emitted light would, in this case, be transmitted<br>
inside the substrate 1.2), this outside surface is<br>
coated with an appropriate antireflection layer 7. This<br>
can be provided either locally, hence only at the<br>
desired exit point of the light beam, or over the whole<br>
surface.<br>
With such a combination, a large-area or even complete<br>
coverage of the actual light source (luminous element<br>
4) could be provided with an opaque coating disposed on<br>
it and thus, if required, a protection against glare.<br>
By means of the optical element 5', the light is<br>
deviated within the transparent substrate 1.2 along the<br>
coating and only exits later at a different place on<br>
the substrate 1.2. With suitable optical devices, the<br>
light can be guided, in a manner known per se, firstly<br>
over a given distance within the glass or plastic of<br><br>
the substrate and then be led toward the outside at a<br>
predetermined place by means of an antireflection layer<br>
or other optical device.<br><br>
