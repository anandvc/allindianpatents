COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10; rule 13) SECTION 10<br>
TITLE<br>
"An improved ball valve for use in liquid transfer pipe lines".<br>
APPLICANT<br>
KWENG ALLOYS PVT. LTD., an Indian Company of J-9/66, G.I.D.C., Antalia, Biltmora-396 325, Gujarat, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
-2-<br><br>
In particular this invention relates to an improvement in or relating to a ball valve for use in the pipe lines used for conveying/transporting the liquid material.<br>
The use of ball valves is as such known in the prior art and the conventional ball valve comprises a plurality of pieces having a thorough hole therethrough and which are adapted to be secured with a middle piece having a ball disposed therein. These pieces are secured with each other by means of nuts and bolts. A stud is provided on the top surface of the ball for securing an operating handle at the top end thereof. A gland sealing is provided between the stud and the body of the middle piece to stop the leakage of the liquid material from the valve assembly during use and operation of the ball valve.<br>
There are certain disadvantages associated with the ball valve as such knwon in the prior art. One of the main disadvantage is that inspite of the gland sealing assembly, leakage takes place as the liquid move in the pipe line under heavy compression and also due to the frequent opening and closing of the valve.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Another disadvantage is that the polution is created due to the leakage of the liquid and also the adjoining area becomes accident prone.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the oxidation of the operating shaft near the gland sealing starts due to the leakage of the liquid and therefore the shaft becomes thick and the operation thereof become very difficult.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that due to the operation of the shaft even after the oxidation of the shaft the diameter of the shaft reduces due to itching action during the operation of the shaft and thus the rate of leakage  increases.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to provide an improved ball valve without having gland sealing so as to obviate the disadvantage associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an improved ball valve provided with the means which do not allow the leakage of the liquid material at all.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an improved ball valve having novel actuating means wherein the oxidation of the component thereof does not take place and thus the operation of the valve is very easy.<br><br>
4 According to this invention there is provided an improved ball valve for use in liquid transfer pipe lines comprising a pair of members (1, 2) provided with securing means (3, 3) provided at the end of said each member and the two members being adapted to be secured with a member (4) having a ball valve (5) disposed therein wherein the said ball valve has a through hole and a stud (6) being secured at the top surface of said ball valve (5) which extends outwardly from the body of the said member (4) characterized in that the bail waive is provided with a magnetic actuating means secured with top end of said stud (6) wherein magnetic actuating means comprises:<br>
a)	a driven magnet (7) adapted to be secured with a top end of said stud<br>
(6);<br>
b)	a shroud (8) in the form of an inverted 'U' provided over the driven magnet (7) and secured with a base plate (9) which itself is disposed on the main body (4) of the valve;<br>
c)	an '0' ring (10) provided between the driven magnet (7) and the base plate (9);<br>
d)	a drive magnet (11) provided over the shroud (8);<br>
e)	a handle (12) secured to an extension (13) of the drive magnet (11);<br>
0 a casing (14) to cover said drive magnet (11) and adapted to be secured with the base plate (9), the casing (14) having a central hole (15) for the extension (13) to protrude through it.<br>
In accordance with this invention the bail valve has a pair of pieces with securing<br>
means provided at one end thereof and a thorough hole from one end to the<br>
other end. These pieces are adapted to be secured with a middle part having a<br>
ball disposed therein. A stud is secured at the top surface of said ball. Specifically<br>
according to the present invention magnetic actuating means are secured at the<br>
top end of the stud for actuating the ball valve. The magnetic actuating means<br>
comprises a driven magnet adapted to be secured with the stud. A shroud / can<br>
in the form of an inverted U is secured with the base plate provided on the<br>
middle portion of said ball body. A drive magnet being	<br><br>
-5-<br>
provided over said shroud such that to actuate the ball by means of a handle secured therewith at the top surface thereof. An 0 ring is provided between the shroud and base plate so as to stop the leakage of liquid from the ball valve assembly.<br>
An improved ball valve assembly according to a preferred<br>
embodiment  of  this invention is herein described and<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:-<br>
Fig.1  shows the sectional plan view of the ball valve assembly of the present invention.<br>
Referring to the drawings the ball valve assembly has a pair of pieces 1 and 2 having securing means 3 provided therewith on one end thereof for securing the ball valve assembly in a pipeline. The securing means comprises flange, threads or welded end. These pieces 1 and 2 are adapted to be secured with a middle part 4 having a ball 5 disposed therein. A thorough hole not shown is provided in the said ball. A stud 6 is secured at the top surface of said ball 5 and is extending outwardly from the body of said middle part 4.[These features are as such known in the art and do not constitute inventive features<br><br>
-6-<br>
Specifically according to this invention magnetic actuating means is secured with the top end of the stud 6 for the actuation of the ball 5 so as to open and close the valve. The magnetic actuating means has a driven magnet 7 adapted to be secured at the top end of the stud 6. A shroud 8 in the form of an inverted U is provided over the driven magnet 7 and is secured with the base,plate 9 which is secured to the middle portion of the valve. An 0 ring 10 is provided between the driven magnet 7 and base plate 9 to stop the leakage of the liquid from the valve assembly. A drive magnet 11 is provided over the shroud 8 such that to actuate the driven magnet 7 and thus the ball 5 with the help of a handle 12 secured to the extension 13 of the drive magnet 11 and, as and when required. A casing 14 is provided to cover the drive magnet 11 and is adapted to be secured with the base plate 9. Casing 14 has a central hole 15 for allowing the extension 13 to come out from the casing 14.<br><br><br>
