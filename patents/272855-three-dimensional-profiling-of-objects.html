3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
The following specification describes the nature of the invention<br>
<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The subject matter described herein in general relates to three dimensional profiling of objects and in particular relates to three dimensional profiling of gemstones.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Precious gemstones, such as diamonds, in their natural condition posses a very irregular geometry. These gemstone need to be cut in a structured shape to produce a finished stone. Before cutting the gemstone, a through study of its geometry is carried out. An exact knowledge of the shape of the gemstone is essential in order to determine the best shape in which the gemstone should be cut to provide maximum value in terms of size as well brilliance. Numerous computer assisted systems capture the shape of the gemstone and provide to a user, the shape in which the gemstone should be cut to obtain a maximum value finished stone. Existing computer softwares facilitate the user to calculate the brilliance of the gemstone when cut in this shape.<br>
Various methods can be employed to determine the geometry of the gemstone by using three dimensional profiling techniques. One such method is to create a volumetric model of the gemstone from its silhouette. A silhouette is a view of an object or scene consisting of the outline and a featureless interior. To create a silhouette of the gemstone, the gemstone is placed between an illuminating light source and a camera wherein light source is positioned behind the gemstone and the camera is positioned in the front. Since the gemstone is not illuminated from the front, a silhouette of the gemstone is created in<br>
<br>
 <br>
front of gemstone. This silhouette is captured by the camera placed in front of the gemstone.<br>
Typically to create a volumetric model of the gemstone i.e. a 3D image from its silhouette, a number of silhouette images of the gemstone need to be captured. A number of silhouette images corresponding to different positions of the gemstone, are captured by the camera. These silhouette images are integrated together by appropriate means to generate a 3 D image of the gemstone.<br>
Projection of structured light is another example of techniques applied to determine the geometry of the gemstone. Structured light is a projection of a light pattern, usually in the form of a grid or a line, at a known angle onto the gemstone. When the light pattern falls onto the gemstone, a bright line of light appears on the surface of the gemstone. By viewing this line of light at an angle, the observed distortions in the line of light can be translated into details of the surface. Scanning the entire surface of the gemstone with the line if light constructs the 3D information about the shape of the gemstone. Structured light projection method employs triangulation to obtain curvature and depth of any recess on the surface of the gemstone. Triangulation is a process of finding coordinates and distance of a point by calculating the length of one side of a triangle, given measurement of angles and sides of the triangle formed by that point and two other known reference points, using laws of trigonometry.<br>
<br>
 <br>
SUMMARY<br>
The subject matter described herein is directed to a product and a process that apply 3D profiling method to determine the exact 3D geometry of a gemstone.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, the product/apparatus comprises a first means for mounting and rotating an object i.e. the gemstone. The gemstone has an irregular geometry and possesses a plurality of surfaces. A first light source is placed behind the object to create plurality of silhouette images of the object as the object rotates on the first means. A second light source is employed for illuminating a point, line or grid on surface of the object. The second light source is needed to perform structured light triangulation. A second means for scanning such as a camera or a scanner is disposed at a predefined angle with respect to the second light source. The second means for scanning captures a plurality of silhouette images of the object. Further, the second means for scanning also captures light from the second light source being reflected from the object. The signals captured by the second means for scanning is processed by a third means. The third means is provided for processing signals. The third means is a software implemented means, working in a computerizes environment.<br>
The third means receives as input a plurality of silhouette images and light from second light source being reflected from the object, captured by the second means. The third means generates a 3D image of the object by processing the signals received. This 3D image of the object corresponds to the position of the object in which it is mounted on the first means. Similarly, a plurality of 3D images is generated by the third means by processing a plurality of signal sets. Each set of signal corresponds to a distinct position<br>
<br>
 <br>
of the object, captured by the second means, by placing the object in different positions. The plurality of 3D images is further processed by a fourth means. The fourth means for digitizing and integrating the plurality of 3D images creates a true three dimensional profile of the object. The fourth means similar to the third means is a software implemented means, working in a computerizes environment After a true three dimensional profile of the object has been generated a fifth means for mapping the three dimensional profile is employed. The fifth means provides the optimal finished profile which can be cut from the object. The fifth means is again a software implemented means.<br>
The terms 'object' and 'gemstone' are interchangeably used in this description. Although the description of the product and process for three dimensional profiling is herein provided with respect to a gemstone, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the product or process can be employed for any object possessing similar dimensions and feature.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the subject matter described herein, a method for profiling an irregular object and in particular a gemstone is described. The method comprises the steps of mounting the object in a first distinct position on a turntable; capturing a silhouette image of the object in this position; rotating the turntable by a predetermined angle of rotation; and again capturing an silhouette image until the object has completed a rotation or a half rotation. Thus, a plurality of silhouette images of the object in the first position is captured for a plurality of angles. Further step of the method includes performing structured light projection on the object to obtain a line profile of the object in first position and superimposing the line profile on corresponding<br>
<br>
 <br>
silhouette image to obtain curvature and depth of any recess by performing structured light triangulation. Hereinafter, the turntable is rotated by a predetermined angle of rotation and the steps of structured light projection and triangulation are repeated until the object has completed one rotation. Thus, by superimposing the information about curvature and depth of recesses, obtained by performing structured light triangulation, on the silhouette image a 3D image of the object in the first position is generated.<br>
The method further includes the steps of demounting the object in the first position and mounting the object in a second position on the turntable. The entire process of capturing a plurality of silhouette images and superimposing the line profile on corresponding silhouette image to obtain a 3D image of the object in the second position is repeated. Proceeding in a similar manner, a plurality of 3D images, each corresponding to a distinct position of the object is obtained. The plurality of 3D images is integrated to form a true three dimensional profile of the object.<br>
Obtaining the 3d images of the object in various positions and integrating them to generate a true three dimensional profile of the object gives precise indication of recess on any surface of the object. Details of all the surfaces of the object get exposed to the scanning means by placing the object in various positions. Repeating steps of obtaining 3D images corresponding to various positions of the object enhances the accuracy of the final three dimensional profile. Precise and accurate information of a recess on any surface of a gemstone is very essential for proper planning and mapping of the gemstone.<br>

These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present subject matter will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims.

BRIEF DISCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and .accompanying drawings where:<br>

 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Determining the shape of an object from its silhouette includes constructing a 3D model of the object based on a multiplicity of images of the object taken from multiple views. Since the object's silhouette represents only the outline features concavities on the objects surface remain invisible in the 3D model generated using object's silhouette. This makes the silhouette method unusable for reconstruction of an image of the object representing recesses on the surface.<br>
Shape from structured light is a method that constructs a surface model of the object based on projecting a pattern of well defined light pattern onto the object. The pattern can be in the form of a ray or a plane of laser light. The 3D coordinated of the points on the object's surface is recovered using triangulation. Since the projection structured light and performing triangulation gives coordinates of the points on the surface of the object, it is used in conjunction with the silhouette image to give a 3D image of the object.<br>
In a typical apparatus used for three dimensional profiling of an object, the object is placed on a means for mounting and rotating, such as a turn table, in a fixed position. A plurality of images of the object is captured as the turntable rotates and exposes different views of the object to the accompanying scanning means, such as a camera. Next, structured light triangulation is performed to obtain a line profile of the object. The line profile is superimposed on the corresponding silhouette image to generate a 3D image of the object. However, the 3D image generated corresponds to the position of the object in which it has been fixed on the turntable. Various fine details, such as details of the<br>
 <br>
 <br>
surface on which the object is resting, or details of a surface hidden from the camera is not reproduced in the 3D image generated.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the method and apparatus described here, the object is placed in different positions, one position at a time, and a 3D image of the object is generated for each of these positions. The 3D image of the object in a particular position reveals maximum details of the object in that position. Integrating a number of such images, each corresponding to a particular position and revealing maximum details of that position gives a true three dimensional profile of the object.<br>
In case the object being dealt with is a gemstone or diamond, it becomes very important of obtain details of all the surfaces. Consider a case where a recess or an inclusion is present on the surface on which the gemstone rests. By using the typical method of three dimensional profiling one may not be able to reproduce the presence of this recess. If the plan mapped for the gemstone is such that it includes the recess or inclusion towards the tip of the gemstone, the brilliance of the gemstone is severely hampered. Loss of brilliance causes decrease in monetary value of the gemstone since gemstones are graded based not only on size but also brilliance.<br>
An Exemplarily Apparatus<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates a schematic representation of an apparatus 100 for three dimensional profiling of an object 105, in accordance with one embodiment of the apparatus.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The apparatus 100 comprises a first means 110 for mounting and rotating the object 105. The first means 105 may be any rotating surface and is typically a turntable. However, applicant intends to encompass within the language any structure presently existing or developed in future that performs the same function. The object 105 is a small irregular shaped object having a plurality of surfaces. A first light source 115 is used to illuminate the object 105 from behind to create a silhouette image of the object. The first light source 115 may be a collimated light source or alternatively an ordinary light source. A second light source 120 is used for illuminating a point, line or grid on the surface of the object to perform structured light triangulation. In one example of the apparatus described herein, the second light source 120 is a laser light source. A second means 125 for scanning the object is being disposed at a predefined angle from the second light source 120. Examples of the second means 125 for scanning the object includes, but is not restricted to, a camera, preferably a CCD camera, a scanner, or a digitizer and encompasses within the language any structure presently existing or developed in future that performs the same function. The second means 125 for scanning, captures a plurality of silhouette images and also light from the second light source being reflected from the object and provides as inputs, these captured signals to a third means 130 for processing signals. The third means 130 for processing, processes the input signals and generates a 3D image for the object.<br>
The 3D image generated by the third means 130 for processing corresponds to a particular position of the object. A plurality of such 3D images is generated for different positions of the object by placing the object on different surfaces. A fourth means for digitizing and integrating the plurality of 3D images generated by the third means 130<br>
 <br>
 <br>
creates a true three dimensional profile of the object. A fifth means for mapping the true three dimensional profile for a optimal finished profile which can be cut from said object is employed. The fourth and the fifth means are integrated into the third means 130 for processing as a part of the data processing module. It should be noted that the third means 130 for processing, fourth means for digitizing and integrating and the fifth means for mapping are software implemented, operatively coupled and work in a computerized image processing environment.<br>
In one embodiment of the subject matter described herein the apparatus 100 runs on a computerized image processing environment wherein the third means 130 for processing, fourth means for digitizing and integrating and the fifth means for mapping are included in a computing device such as a computer having an input device and a display device, a microprocessor or a microcontroller.<br>
An Exemplarily Process<br>
FIGURE 2A and 2B exemplarily illustrates a process of generating a three dimensional profile of an object.<br>
Fig 2A shows perspective view of an object 205 mounted on its bottom surface on the turntable 110 in according to one embodiment of the present invention. The object 205 is a cuboid wherein the top surface 210 and the bottom surface 215 are bounded by four rectangular surfaces 220, 225, 230 and 235 on each side. The bottom surface 215 and two side surfaces 230 and 235 are not visible in the figure. Operation of the exemplary apparatus depicted in Fig. l may be divided into four cycles for the purpose of better explanation of the process.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
I	Cycle: In first cycle, which is optional, object 205 is coated with a desired diffusing<br>
coating.<br>
If the object 205 is transparent, and not opaque, it is coated with a removable diffusing coating to permit the camera 125 to capture laser light reflected from the surface thereof. A diffusion coating provides diffusion of the light impinging thereon, and permit detection by the camera 125 for the purpose of triangulation. On the other hand, if the laser light has a wavelength to which the object 205 is not transparent or reflective, the coating is not required.<br>
II	Cycle: In second cycle object 205 is mounted on its bottom surface 215 and a 3D<br>
image corresponding to the object 205 in this position is generated.<br>
In the II Cycle a plurality of silhouette image of the object 205 is captured by rotating the turntable 110 by small angles and capturing a silhouette for different angular position of the object 205. After the image is generated, or substantially simultaneously with capturing of the silhouette or alternating with capturing the silhouette, the second light source 120 illuminates a point, line or grid on the object 205. Alternatively, the second light source 120 can simultaneously illuminate several lines, or several light sources can simultaneously illuminate the object 205. If the object 205 has a convex surface, the light will be reflected and coincide with a corresponding point on the silhouette. However, if the object 205 has a concavity at one point, light will be reflected to a different location on silhouette image. Utilizing principles of triangulation, the distance of the point on the surface containing the concavity, from a reference point can be calculated from a known distance and a known angle between the second means 125<br>
 <br>
 <br>
for scanning and the second light source 120. For each line scanned, there is a correspondence between the distance to the object, and the position of the object line in the camera view. This correspondence is defined by triangulation. A image processing software finds the position of this line as a set of data points. When these data points are superimposed on the silhouette of the object 205, the generated image includes an indication of the location, curvature, and depth of any recess on the surface of the object 205. When the object has rotated for 360 degrees on its axis and desired processing is done on object 205, II cycle gets completed. Alternatively, desired processing can be done at the end of III cycle.<br>
Thus, structured light triangulation is carried out to obtain a line profile of the object 205. The line profile of the object is superimposed on the corresponding silhouette image to generate a 3D image of the object 205. This 3D image corresponds to the current position of the object i.e. when the object is placed on the surface 215.<br>
Ill Cycle: In third cycle object 205 is mounted on one of its side surfaces and a 3 D image of the object 205 is generated following the similar steps as in the preceding cycle.<br>
In one embodiment, in the II and III cycle as shown in fig. 2A and 2B, object 205 is mounted on its bottom surface 215 to the rotating turntable 110. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the table may be stationary and the first light source 115, second light source 120 and camera 125 can rotate around the object 205.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
IV Cycle: In fourth cycle, the 3D images obtained from II and III cycle are integrated together to create a true three dimensional profile of the object 205. The images are digitized and integrated together to create a true three dimensional profile. A means for digitizing and integrating, working in a computerized imaging environment is coupled to the second means 125 for scanning for this purpose.<br>
In addition, the IV Cycle also includes computing different parameters like mapping and optimizing the true three dimensional profile for a optimal finished profile/model which can be cut from the object.<br>
In one embodiment, the 3D images obtained from II and III cycle are digitized and integrated together to create a true 3 dimensional profile or computer model, by using feature matching algorithm<br>
In another embodiment, the 3D images obtained from II and III cycle are<br>
digitized and integrated together to create a true 3 dimensional profile by locating the reference point automatically or by human interaction.<br>
Although the above exemplarily process has been explained taking into account the integration of images capture for two positions only it is possible to integrate a plurality of images captured for various different positions.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
An Exemplarily Process<br>
FIGURE 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D illustrate a series of images generated during image processing carried out to generate a true three dimensional profile of an object.<br>
FIGURE 3A illustrates an image of an object 205 as viewed by the camera without any image processing. As shown in the figure the object 205 is a cuboid and its isometric view image has been captured. The two surfaces 305 and 310 visible to the camera reveal the presence of recesses 315 and 320 on both surfaces respectively. The details of the bottom surface i.e. the surface on which the object rests is hidden from the camera.<br>
FIGURE 3B is silhouette image of the object 205. As seen from the figure, the silhouette image does not contain any information of the recesses on the surface of the object 205.<br>
FIGURE 3C shows a sectional view of the silhouette image as seen after being dissected along a sectional line 325.<br>
FIGURE 3D illustrates the three dimensional image of the object 205 after performing structured triangulation and superimposing the line profile information on the silhouette data. However, as seen from the figure, the 3D image corresponds to image of the object 205 placed at one particular position only and various fine details, such as details of the surface on which the object is resting, or details of a surface hidden from the camera is not reproduced in the 3D image.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
FIGURE 3E shows a sectional view of the three dimensional image as seen after being dissected along a sectional line 330. The sectional view shows the details of the recesses present on surface of the object 205. However, the presence of any recess on the bottom surface or top surface of the object is not revealed in the sectional view.<br>
FIGURE 3F is a true three dimensional profile of the object 205. The true three dimensional profile takes into account many three dimensional images as shown in Fig. 3D, captured by placing the object 205 in different positions. A plurality of three dimensional images each corresponding to a distinct position of the object 205 are integrated together to produce a true three dimensional profile of the object 205.<br>
An Exemplarily Method<br>
FIGURE 4 exemplarily illustrates a method 400 of generating a three dimensional profile of an object, by means of a flowchart.<br>
The method 400 is initiated at step 405 by mounting the object whose profile has to determined, on a turntable, at a fixed position. In case the object is transparent or reflective the object is coated with a coating in order to make it opaque. A coating, such as diffusion coating, is applied to the surface of the object to make the object opaque.<br>
In the next step 410 a silhouette image of the object is captured. In step 415 the turntable is rotated by a predetermined angle. In the following step 420 of the method 400 a decision is made whether the turntable has rotated one rotation. The steps 410 and 415 are repeated until the turntable has completed one rotation. Thus, a plurality of silhouette image captured at different angles for the image placed in this position is obtained.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
After a plurality of silhouette images have been captured a fine line or beam of light is projected onto the object in step 425. In step 430, structured light triangulation is carried out to obtain a line profile of the object. The line profile of the object obtained in step 430 is superimposed on the corresponding silhouette image in step 435. According to step 440 the preceding steps 425,430 and 435 are performed repeatedly until the line profiles for all the 360 degrees has been obtained and superimposed on the corresponding silhouette. In step 445 a 3D image of the object is generated. This 3D image corresponds to the current position of the object.<br>
Following step 445 the object is dismounted from the turntable and placed in a new distinct position on the turntable. The preceding steps 405 through 445 of method 400 are repeated in order to generate a new 3D image of the object in the new position. "N" such images are captured by dismounted the object each time, placing it in another distinct position and producing an image of the object in the present position. "N" is a predetermined value depending on the geometry of the object. Typically, "N" has a value in the preferable range of 2 to 4 However, the value largely varies depending upon the object geometry.<br>
The "N" different 3D images captured in different positions of the object are orientated to make all the images correspond to one common axis of reference in step 455. In step 460, the "N" 3D images are integrated to produce a true three dimensional profile of the object.<br>
Since, the "N" 3D images have been captured by placing the object in various positions, it becomes essential for the image processing software present in the apparatus<br>
 <br>
 <br>
to align these images to common axis before integrating the images together. Suppose the axis of reference for the object in the first position is Xi, Yi Z\. Similarly X2, Y2 Z2 in the second position. To integrate the image in the first position with the image in the second position, the two images have to be brought to a common reference axis. This can be achieved in the following ways. In a first approach, the image processing software recognizes some distinguishable features on the object and uses these features as reference to align the two images to a common axis. In a second method, the image processing software requires human intervention wherein a user puts very fine marks on the surface of the object. These marks are identified by the image processing software and used as reference. In a third method, the image processing software triggers the system to activate a laser marking system to put markings on the object and then treat these markings as reference.<br>
The order in which the method 400 is described is not intended to be construed as a limitation, and the steps described can be combined in other ways obvious to a person skilled in the art. Additionally, individual blocks may be added or deleted from the method without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject matter described.<br>
Although the subject matter has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, other embodiments are possible. As such, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred embodiment contained therein.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
Described herein is a method and apparatus for three dimensional profiling of an object. The apparatus comprises a means for scanning the object placed on a rotating means in a first position, by capturing light from a first and a second light source illuminating the object. A signal processing means coupled to the means for scanning processes signal captured by the means for scanning and generates a 3D image of the object in the first position. Hereafter, the object is dismounted and positioned in a second position and another 3D image corresponding to the second position is generated. Similarly a plurality of 3D images each corresponding to a distinct position of the object is captured. The plurality of 3D images, captured for various positions of the object, are integrated to generate a true three dimensional profile of the object.<br>
