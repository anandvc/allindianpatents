				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to extended keyboard editors, and more<br>
particularly, relates to integrating a platform-portable virtual machine with input<br>
method editors for creating composed characters, such as calligraphic ideograms<br>
in non-Latin languages including Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Global connectivity provided by the Internet will increase the demand for<br>
internationalized software products and place additional requirements on<br>
internationalized applications. For example, applications that are delivered and<br>
run over the Internet may need to adapt to the user's language at run time.<br>
Other applications will need to be multilingual and support a combination of<br>
different languages. A platform-portable programming language, JAVA, has been<br>
designed to support internationalization. The JAVA primitive character type is<br>
based on Unicode, which is an international standard for encoding written<br>
language elements.<br>
Although JAVA includes support for Unicode strings, many text editors use<br>
double-byte character set (DBCS) encoding, and many text files contain DBCS<br>
strings rather than Unicode strings. For text files that contain DBCS strings, the<br>
source files must be converted to Unicode when compiled. In addition, DBCS<br>
strings must be converted to Unicode during read and write operations. The<br>
MICROSOFT system development tools for JAVA enhance the internationalization<br>
features of JAVA with support for DBCS encoding and MICROSOFT WINDOWS<br>
resources.<br>
Specifically, the MICROSOFT JAVA compiler (JVC) translates DBCS literal strings<br>
in source code files to Unicode when compiling the source code into class files.<br>
When a browser with Unicode-enabled JAVA support (for example, the support in<br>
MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER, version 3.0) runs these class files, the literal<br>
strings will therefore appear correctly. In addition, the MICROSOFT virtual<br>
machine allows a system developer to write JAVA-based programs that convert<br>
text strings between DBCS and Unicode.<br>
An input method editor (IME) is a program that allows computer users to enter<br>
complex characters and symbols, such as Japanese Kanji characters, using a<br>
standard keyboard. Internationalized versions of MICROSOFT WINDOWS provide<br>
system IMEs for locales with languages using non-Latin alphabets, such as<br>
Japanese, Korean, traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese. IMEs may also be<br>
developed for other languages, such as Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, and so forth.<br>
At present, IME source code cannot be modified by system developers on an as-<br>
needed basis. Making IME source code alteration generally available is<br>
complicated by the fact that IMEs are implemented on many different types of<br>
platforms using different operating systems. The prospect of updating every<br>
possible operating system that might have to interact with an IME is not a<br>
practical solution.<br>
There is, therefore, a need for a platform-portable virtual machine that allows<br>
individual developers to modify IME source code on an as-needed basis. In<br>
particular, there is a need for a system that provides IME support for JAVA<br>
applications that host JAVA-based IMEs as well as existing system IMEs.<br>
EP-0 472444 discloses an electronic document editing system for allowing users<br>
to impart various types of button behaviour to ordinary human interpretive<br>
elements of electronic documents by associating hidden persistent character<br>
string button attributes to such elements. A centralized kernel reads the<br>
appropriate button attribute character strings and establishes communications<br>
between an editor, a button handler in a button class manger and an appropriate<br>
command handler so that the action described in the button is carried out.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the need for a platform-portable virtual machine<br>
that allows individual developers to modify input method editor (IME) source<br>
code on an as-needed basis by integrating a JAVA virtual machine with one or<br>
more IMEs. The JAVA programming environment can advantageously be<br>
implemented on a wide variety of platforms using different operating systems.<br>
Therefore, a system developer can use a JAVA virtual machine to modify IME<br>
source code on a wide variety of platforms using different operating systems. In<br>
addition, an IME modified on one platform may be ported to other platforms<br>
using other operating systems. The invention thus provides a platform-portable<br>
virtual machine that allows individual developers to modify IME source code on<br>
an as-needed basis.<br>
A JAVA-based virtual machine according to the present invention supports input<br>
method editor (IME) functionality in three contexts: (1) using JAVA-based IMEs<br>
with a JAVA virtual machine; (2) writing JAVA-based IMEs; and (3) integrating a<br>
JAVA virtual machine to system IMEs. The virtual machine includes a windows<br>
manager, an input method manager, one or more IMEs and/or keyboard drivers<br><br>
(KBDs), and one or more components. The virtual machine may also include a<br>
system IME bridge for integrating the virtual machine with existing system IMEs,<br>
and a system KBD bridge for integrating the virtual machine with existing system<br>
KBDs. The windows manager serves as a gateway between the operating system<br>
and the virtual machine. The input method manager (IMM) serves as a router<br>
between the windows manager and a plurality of IMEs and KBDs. The IME<br>
includes a look-up table of composed characters that are indexed by Unicode<br>
keyboard commands. The component typically renders a user interface that<br>
allows the user to manipulate the composed characters returned by the IME.<br>
To accommodate user-definable IMEs and components, the virtual machine<br>
implements a predefined set of interfaces that allow the IMEs and components to<br>
communicate with each other and with the other elements of the virtual<br>
machine, namely the windows manager and the IMM. These predefined<br>
interfaces allow system developers to modify the functionality of IMEs and<br>
components, and to integrate the modified IMEs and components with the virtual<br>
machine. Specifically, a compatible IME implements an interface known as the<br>
Interface Method Listener Interface. The IMM implements an interface known as<br>
the Input Manager Listener Interface. The windows manager implements an<br>
interface known as the Input Method Callback Interface. And the component<br>
implements an interface known as the Input Method Message Listener Interface.<br>
A compatible IME is created by writing an IME that implements the Input Method<br>
Listener Interface. That is, creating an IME that implements the Input Method<br>
Listener Interface is necessary and sufficient for creating an IME that is<br>
compatible with a virtual machine constructed according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Generally described, the invention is a platform-portable virtual machine that<br>
runs on a computer system including a keyboard, a display device, a processing<br>
unit, and an operating system running on the processing unit. The virtual<br>
machine, which also runs on the processing unit, includes a windows manager<br>
that receives keyboard commands from the operating system. The input method<br>
manager receives the keyboard commands from the windows manager. The<br>
input method editor receives the keyboard commands from the input method<br>
manager and translates the keyboard commands into a composed character,<br>
such as a calligraphic ideogram or an element of a calligraphic ideogram. The<br>
component receives the composed character from the input method editor and<br>
renders the composed character for display on the display device.<br>
More specifically, the windows manager receives a keyboard command from the<br>
keyboard and determines whether the input method manager is active. If the<br>
input method manager is not active, the windows manager passes the keyboard<br>
command to the component. If the input method manager is active, on the other<br>
hand, the windows manager passes the keyboard command to the input method<br>
manager and receives a return message from the input method manager. If the<br>
input method manager cannot handle the keyboard message, it returns a<br>
"FALSE" return message to the windows manager. The windows manager then<br>
passes the keyboard command to the component. Alternatively, the input<br>
method manager handles the keyboard command and returns "TRUE" to the<br>
windows manager.<br>
The input method manager receives the keyboard command from the windows<br>
manager and determines whether the keyboard command is directed to the<br>
input method manager. The input method manager responds to the keyboard<br>
command if the keyboard command is directed to the input method manager<br>
responding. For example, the keyboard command may cause the input method<br>
manager to inactivate the currently-active input method editor, and to activate<br>
an alternative input method editor. If the keyboard command is not directed to<br>
the input method manager, the input method manager passes the keyboard<br>
command to the currently-active input method editor.<br>
The input method editor receives the keyboard command from the input method<br>
manager and may combine the keyboard command with previously received<br>
keyboard commands to create a composite string. The input method editor then<br>
determines whether the composite string corresponds to a composed character.<br>
If the composite string corresponds to one or more composed characters, the<br>
input method editor translates the composite string into the composed<br>
character(s) and passes the composed character(s) to the windows manager.<br>
The windows manager receives the composed character(s) from the input<br>
method editor and passes the composed character(s) to the component.<br>
The component receives the composed character(s) from the windows manager,<br>
renders a user interface on the display device, and renders the composed<br>
character(s) on the display device in association with the user interface. The<br>
component may then receive user commands through the user interface, alter<br>
the composed character(s) in response to the user commands, and render the<br>
altered composed character(s) on the display device in association with the user<br>
interface.<br>
The computer system may also include one or more system input method editors<br>
running on the processing unit, and the virtual machine may also include an<br>
input method editor bridge for integrating the system input method editor(s)<br>
with the windows manager and the input method manager.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the input method editor defines an<br>
interface including a first interface method for receiving a message from the<br>
input method manager instructing the input method editor to handle a keyboard<br>
command. The input method editor interface may also include a second interface<br>
method for receiving a message from the input method manager instructing the<br>
input method editor to activate. The input method editor interface may also<br>
include a third interface method for receiving a message from the input method<br>
manager instructing the input method editor to deactivate. The input method<br>
editor interface may also include a fourth interface method for receiving a<br>
message from the windows manager instructing the input method editor to<br>
handle the message.<br>
The input method editor interface may also include a fifth interface method for<br>
receiving a message from the component instructing the input method editor to<br>
render a user interface for display on the display device. The input method editor<br>
interface may also include a sixth interface method for receiving a message from<br>
the component defining the size of the user interface rendered by the input<br>
method for display on the display device. The input method editor interface may<br>
also include a seventh interface method for receiving a message from the<br>
component defining the position of the user interface rendered by the input<br>
method for display on the display device.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the input method manager defines<br>
an interface including a first interface method for receiving a message from the<br>
windows manager instructing the input method manager to activate a first input<br>
method editor. The input method manager may also include a second interface<br>
method for receiving a message from the windows manager instructing the input<br>
method manager to remove a second input method editor from a registered list<br>
of input method editors. The input method manager may also include a third<br>
interface method for receiving a message from the windows manager instructing<br>
the input method manager to identify an active input method editor. The input<br>
method manager may also include a fourth interface method for receiving a<br>
message from the windows manager instructing the input method manager to<br>
enumerate the list of registered input method editors. The input method<br>
manager may also include a fifth interface method for receiving a message from<br>
the windows manager asking the input method manager to handle a keyboard<br>
command.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention, the windows manager defines<br>
an interface including an interface method for receiving messages from the input<br>
method editor. In addition, the component defines an interface including an<br>
interface method for receiving messages from the windows manager.<br>
That the present invention improves over the drawbacks of the prior art and<br>
accomplishes the objects of the invention will become apparent from the detailed<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention may be embodied in a virtual machine that supports IME<br>
functionality in three contexts: (1) using JAVA-based IMEs with a JAVA virtual<br>
machine; (2) writing JAVA-based IMEs; and (3) integrating a JAVA virtual<br>
machine to system IMEs. The virtual machine includes a windows manager, an<br>
IMM, one or more JAVA-based IMEs, one or more JAVA-based KBDs, and one or<br>
more component. The virtual machine may also include a system IME bridge for<br>
integrating the virtual machine with system IMEs, and a system KBD bridge for<br>
integrating the virtual machine with system KBDs.<br>
The windows manager serves as a gateway between the operating system and<br>
the virtual machine. As such, the windows manager receives keyboard<br>
commands from the operating system, including function commands and<br>
compound keyboard commands, such as "CTRL +" "ALT +" and "CTRL ALT +"<br>
that increase the number of characters that can be uniquely identified by a<br>
standard keyboard. The windows manager translates the keyboard commands<br>
into a standard Unicode format and routes the Unicode keyboard commands to<br>
the component or to the IMM, as appropriate. The windows manager also<br>
receives composed characters returned by an IME and routes the composed<br>
characters to the component for display and further manipulation by the user, as<br>
defined by the functionality of the component. The windows manager may also<br>
receive IME messages and route the IME messages to the component.<br>
The IMM serves as a router between the windows manager and a plurality of<br>
IMEs and KBDs. The IMM responds to certain IMM commands, such as toggle<br>
commands, that allow a user to activate a particular IME or KBD. The IMM<br>
typically responds to an IMM command by deactivating the previously-active IME<br>
or KBD and activating the indicated IME or KBD. The IMM then routes<br>
subsequent keyboard commands to the activated IME or KBD until another IMM<br>
command is received.<br>
The IME includes a look-up table of composed characters that are indexed by the<br>
various Unicode keyboard commands. The IME receives the Unicode messages<br>
from the windows manager and translates the Unicode messages into the<br>
corresponding composed characters. To further increase the number of<br>
characters that can be uniquely identified by a standard keyboard, the IME may<br>
be configured to index composed characters based on multiple keyboard<br>
commands. That is, the IME may combine a number of Unicode keyboard<br>
commands to build a Unicode composite string that corresponds to one or more<br>
predefined composed characters. The use of multiple-keyboard command<br>
composite strings allows the IME to index thousands of individual composed<br>
characters, which is very useful for generating calligraphic ideograms in non-<br>
Latin languages, such as Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. The IME then passes<br>
the composed character to the windows manager, which passes the composed<br>
character to the component for further manipulation by the user.<br>
The IME may also pass instructions, known as IME messages, to the windows<br>
manager. The windows manager typically passes the IME messages on to the<br>
component. IME messages typically include composition messages, such as<br>
"begin composed character" and "end composed character," that allow the IME<br>
to interact with the component. The component and the IME may be configured<br>
by system developers to handle many other IME messages on as as-needed<br>
bases. The JAVA virtual machine provides a mechanism by which the component<br>
and the IME may communicate, but the JAVA virtual machine does not dictate<br>
the functionality of the component or the IME. Nor does the JAVA virtual<br>
machine dictate the types or structure of the IME messages that may be<br>
communicated between the component and the IME. Thus, the specific IME<br>
messages are not determined by the virtual machine, but rather are left to be<br>
defined by individual system developers on an as-needed basis. The function of<br>
the virtual machine is to provide a standardized vehicle for integrating user-<br>
definable IMEs with user-definable components.<br>
Although the component or the IME may be configured to control the IME's<br>
drawing space, the component typically renders a user interface that allows the<br>
user to alter the composed character, such as a calligraphic ideogram or element<br>
of a calligraphic ideogram, returned by the IME. Of course, the functionality of<br>
particular user-definable IMEs and components may vary from platform to<br>
platform, and from user to user. To accommodate these user-definable IMEs and<br>
components, the virtual machine implements a predefined set of interfaces that<br>
allow the IMEs and components to communicate with each other and with the<br>
other elements of the virtual machine, namely the windows manager and the<br>
IMM. These predefined interfaces allow system developers to modify the<br>
functionality of IMEs and components, and to integrate the modified IMEs and<br>
components with the virtual machine.<br>
Central to the exemplary embodiments of invention, therefore, is the definition of<br>
a set of cooperating interfaces that allow the elements of the virtual machine to<br>
communicate with each other. A compatible IME implements an interface known<br>
as the Interface Method Listener Interface. The Interface Method Listener<br>
Interface preferably includes eight interface methods: Handle Key-instructs the<br>
IME to attempt to respond to an event (e.g., keyboard command); Handle IME<br>
message-instructs the IME to handle an IME message; Set Visible Component-<br>
tells the IME which module controls the IME's drawing space; Set Position-<br>
instructs the IME to begin drawing at a specific location; Get Size-gets the size<br>
of the graphic image that the IME will draw; Paint-instructs the IME to begin<br>
drawing a character; Activate--instructs the IME to respond to subsequent<br>
messages; and Deactivate--instructs the IME not to respond to subsequent<br>
messages (except activate).<br>
The IMM implements an interface known as the Input Manager Listener<br>
Interface. The Input Manager Listener Interface preferably includes five interface<br>
methods: Get Input Method-instructs the IMM to identify the active IME; Get<br>
Number Input Methods-instructs the IMM to enumerate the registered IMEs;<br>
Remove Input Method-instructs the IMM to remove an IMM from the registered<br>
list of IMEs; Set Input Method-instructs the IMM to activate a particular IME;<br>
and Handled Key-allows the windows manager to pass a keyboard command to<br>
the IMM and obtain a return message from the IMM indicating whether the IMM<br>
accepted or rejected the keyboard command.<br>
The windows manager implements an interface known as the Input Method<br>
Callback Interface. The Input Method Callback Interface preferably includes two<br>
interface methods: Handle IME Char-used by an IME to return a composed<br>
character, such as a calligraphic ideogram or an element of a calligraphic<br>
ideogram, to the windows manager; and Handle IME Message-used by an IME<br>
to pass an IME message to the windows manager.<br>
The component implements an interface known as the Input Method Message<br>
Listener Interface. The Input Method Message Listener Interface preferably<br>
includes one interface method: Handle IME Message-used the windows<br>
manager to pass IME messages to the component.<br>
A compatible IME is created by writing an IME that implements the Input Method<br>
Listener Interface. That is, creating a IME that implements the Input Method<br>
Listener Interface is necessary and sufficient for creating an IME that is<br>
compatible with a virtual machine constructed according to the present<br>
invention. The virtual machine may also include a system IME bridge that<br>
integrates the virtual machine with a system IME. The system IME bridge inserts<br>
flags or other command name identifiers into IME messages to prevent<br>
unwanted feedback from the system IME to the operating system. Similarly, the<br>
virtual machine may also include a system KBD bridge that integrates the virtual<br>
machine with a system KBD.<br>
JAVA-based IMEs provide more flexibility and control than system IMEs. For<br>
example, JAVA-based IMEs can be used with any version of WINDOWS. Thus,<br>
cross-platform JAVA-based IMEs may run on any system that has the virtual<br>
machine installed. Multiple JAVA-based IMEs, based on different languages, may<br>
therefore be activated concurrently by a single JAVA application. JAVA-based<br>
IMEs can be packaged and downloaded from the Internet with applets or<br>
downloaded at the discretion of the user. Applications can control Java IME<br>
interface elements such as composition, status, and candidate windows. Secure<br>
JAVA-based IMEs follow normal JAVA security rules and run in the "sandbox"<br>
with JAVA applications.<br>
The com.ms.util. package contains the Input Method package contains the Input<br>
Method Listener interface class, which is the base class for JAVA-based IMEs.<br>
IMEs based on this class will be recognized by the IMM. The virtual machine also<br>
supports existing system IMEs enclosed in a COM wrapper interchangeably with<br>
JAVA-based IMEs. However, there are some limitations associated with using<br>
system IMEs. A JAVA-based IME may be used on any system regardless of what<br>
language the system is localized for as long as the JAVA virtual machine is<br>
installed. System IMEs, on the other hand, are limited to IMEs supported by the<br>
IMM on the host system. For example, a Korean system IME cannot run in<br>
connection with a version of WINDOWS 95 that is localized for Greece.<br>
System IMEs are supported with the System IME class in the<br>
com.ms.util.InputMethod package. The System IME class implements the Input<br>
Method Listener interface by embedding a COM object to communicate directly<br>
with the system IMEs. The COM object receives keyboard command messages<br>
from the IME and routes the result of the composition to the windows manager<br>
and on to the component.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate like elements<br>
throughout the several figures, the exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention will be described below. Generally, FIG. 1 illustrates the operating<br>
environment of the disclosed embodiments of the invention.<br>
Exemplary Operating Environment<br>
FIG. 1 and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general<br>
description of a suitable computing environment in which the invention may be<br>
implemented. While the invention will be described in the general context of an<br>
application program that runs on an operating system in conjunction with a<br>
personal computer, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention also<br>
may be implemented in combination with other program modules. Generally,<br>
program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, etc.<br>
that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.<br>
Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be<br>
practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held<br>
devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable<br>
consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The<br>
invention may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where<br>
tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a<br>
communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program<br>
modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.<br>
With reference to FIG. 1, an exemplary system for implementing the invention<br>
includes a conventional personal computer 20, including a processing unit 21, a<br>
system memory 22, and a system bus 23 that couples the system memory to the<br>
processing unit 21. The system memory 22 includes read only memory (ROM) 24<br>
and random access memory (RAM) 25. A basic input/output system 26 (BIOS),<br>
containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements<br>
within the personal computer 20, such as during start-up, is stored in ROM 24.<br>
The personal computer 20 further includes a hard disk drive 27, a magnetic disk<br>
drive 28, e.g., to read from or write to a removable disk 29, and an optical disk<br>
drive 30, e.g., for reading a CD-ROM disk 31 or to read from or write to other<br>
optical media. The hard disk drive 27, magnetic disk drive 28, and optical disk<br>
drive 30 are connected to the system bus 23 by a hard disk drive interface 32, a<br>
magnetic disk drive interface 33, and an optical drive interface 34, respectively.<br>
The drives and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile<br>
storage for the personal computer 20. Although the description of computer-<br>
readable media above refers to a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk and a<br>
CD-ROM disk, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types<br>
of media that are readable by a computer, such as magnetic cassettes, flash<br>
memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartridges, and the like, may also be<br>
used in the exemplary operating environment.<br>
A number of program modules may be stored in the drives and RAM 25,<br>
including an operating system 35, one or more application programs 36, other<br>
program modules 37, and program data 38. In particular, one of the other<br>
program modules 37 is a JAVA virtual machine 100 that includes certain<br>
embodiments of the invention, which are described in detail below with reference<br>
to FIGS. 2-13. JAVA, a registered trademark of SUN MICROSYSTEMS, refers to a<br>
multi-platform programming language, as is known to those skilled in the art. A<br>
user of the JAVA virtual machine 100 may enter commands and information into<br>
the personal computer 20 through a keyboard 40 and pointing device, such as a<br>
mouse 42. Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick,<br>
game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are<br>
often connected to the processing unit 21 through a serial port interface 46 that<br>
is coupled to the system bus, but may be connected by other interfaces, such as<br>
a game port or a universal serial bus (USB). A monitor 47 or other type of display<br>
device is also connected to the system bus 23 via an interface, such as a video<br>
adapter 48. In addition to the monitor, personal computers typically include<br>
other peripheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers or printers.<br>
The personal computer 20 may operate in a networked environment using logical<br>
connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer 49.<br>
The remote computer 49 may be a server, a router, a peer device or other<br>
common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements<br>
described relative to the personal computer 20, although only a memory storage<br>
device 50 has been illustrated in FIG. 1. The logical connections depicted in FIG.<br>
1 include a local area network (LAN) 51 and a wide area network (WAN) 52.<br>
Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide<br>
computer networks, intranets and the Internet.<br>
When used in a LAN networking environment, the personal computer 20 is<br>
connected to the LAN 51 through a network interface 53. When used in a WAN<br>
networking environment, the personal computer 20 typically includes a modem<br>
54 or other means for establishing communications over the WAN 52, such as<br>
the Internet. The modem 54, which may be internal or external, is connected to<br>
the system bus 23 via the serial port interface 46. In a networked environment,<br>
program modules depicted relative to the personal computer 20, or portions<br>
thereof, may be stored in the remote memory storage device. It will be<br>
appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means<br>
of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.<br>
Operation of the Disclosed Embodiment<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram that illustrates an operating system 35 that<br>
cooperates with a JAVA virtual machine 100 including a plurality of JAVA-based<br>
input method editors represented by the IME/Js 112 and 114, and plurality of<br>
JAVA-based keyboard drivers represented by the KBD/Js 118 and 120. The<br>
author of a document written in calligraphic ideograms creates the calligraphic<br>
ideograms by entering predefined keyboard commands into the keyboard 40 or<br>
some other suitable type of input device. The operating system 35 receives these<br>
keyboard commands at a keyboard driver 102, which translates the keyboard<br>
commands into keyboard commands. Each keystroke is translated into three<br>
keyboard commands that may be handled and interpreted individually: WM_<br>
KEYDOWN - indicating that a key has been depressed, WM _ CHAR - typically an<br>
ASCII code or value associated with the depressed key, and WM_KEYUP -<br>
indicating that a key has been released. These keyboard commands are<br>
delivered to the JAVA virtual machine 100.<br>
The keyboard commands are initially received by a JAVA windows manager 108<br>
that translates the commands into Unicode keyboard commands that are<br>
understood by the other components of the JAVA virtual machine 100. The<br>
windows manager 108 typically consumes the WM-KEYDOWN and WM-KEYUP<br>
keyboard commands, which serve as delimiters for keyboard commands<br>
including multi-key complex keyboard commands. The windows manager 108<br>
typically then passes Unicode translations of the WM_KEYDOWN and WM-KEYUP<br>
keyboard commands to the IMM 110, which operates as a router between the<br>
windows component 108 and a plurality of IMEs and KBDs.<br>
IMEs are typically used to create composed characters in non-Latin languages,<br>
such as Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. IMEs are usually quite sophisticated and<br>
often use multiple keyboard commands to define an individual composed<br>
characters. IMEs also usually operate in connection with a component that allows<br>
the user to further manipulate the composed characters generated by the IME.<br>
KBDs are relatively simple translators that are used to create characters in Latin<br>
languages, such as French, German, and Spanish. Unlike IMEs, KBDs typically<br>
use single keyboard commands and compound keyboard commands (i.e.,<br>
multiple keys depressed simultaneously) to define an individual composed<br>
characters. KBDs typically do not require the functionality afforded by a<br>
component user interface. Nevertheless, KBDs could be developed with all of the<br>
sophistication and component user interface functionality usually associated with<br>
an IME.<br>
The IMM 110 is operative for maintaining a list of registered IMEs and KBDs, and<br>
activating and deactivating the IMEs and KBDs in the registered list. For<br>
example, a first JAVA-based IME, designated as IME/J 112, may be operative for<br>
generating calligraphic ideogram in Chinese. A second JAVA-based IME,<br>
designated as IME/J 114, may be operative for generating calligraphic ideogram<br>
in or Japanese. In addition, a first JAVA-based KBD, designated as KBD/J 118,<br>
may be operative for writing in French. A second JAVA-based KBD, designated as<br>
KBD/J 120, may be operative for writing in German or Spanish. For clarity, the<br>
following discussion will refer only to the IMEs. It should be understood,<br>
however, that similar operations may be implemented for the KBDs.<br>
The IMM 110 serves as a router between the windows manager 108 and a<br>
plurality of IMEs, represented by the IMEs 112, 114 and 116. The IME/Js 112<br>
and 114 represent JAVA-based IMEs and the IME/S 116 represents a system<br>
IME. To select among these IMEs 112, 114 and 116, the IMM 110 responds to<br>
certain predefined IMM commands (e.g., toggle commands) that allow a user to<br>
select a particular IME. The IMM 110 responds to an IMM command by<br>
deactivating the previously-active IME and activating the indicated IME. The IMM<br>
110 then routes subsequent events to the activated input method editor until<br>
another IMM command is received. For non-IMM commands, the IMM 110 routes<br>
the commands from the windows manager 108 to the active IME. The<br>
commands passed to the active IME from the IMM 108 typically include Unicode<br>
translations of WM--KEYDOWN and WM--KEYUP keyboard commands. The<br>
keyboard commands passed to the active IME from the IMM 110 may also<br>
include function commands for controlling the IME.<br>
The implementation of the Input Method Listener Interface by the JAVA-based<br>
IME/Js 112 and 114 is necessary and sufficient for allowing the JAVA windows<br>
manager 108 to interact properly with the IMEs. Thus, the IME/Js 112 and 114,<br>
which are to be created by JAVA developers according to the constructs of the<br>
JAVA Virtual Machine System Development Kit (SDK), are typically programmed<br>
to communicate with the operating system 35 through the virtual machine 100.<br>
But the operating-system-based IME/S 116, which may have been created<br>
before the virtual machine 100 or without regard to the virtual machine 100, may<br>
be programmed to communicate directly with the operating system 35 under<br>
certain circumstances. This feedback between the IME/S 116 and the operating<br>
system 35, which in turn supplies IME messages to windows manager 108, can<br>
result in commands entering a continual loop between the operating system 35<br>
and the JAVA virtual machine 100 or other unpredictable and undesirable results.<br>
To prevent this type of feedback, the JAVA virtual machine 100 typically includes<br>
an IME/S bridge 124 that links the windows manager 108 to the system IME/S<br>
116. The JAVA virtual machine 100 also typically includes a system KBD/S bridge<br>
126 that links the windows manager to a system KBD/S. The system IME/S<br>
bridge 124 and the system KBD/S bridge 126 insert flags or other command<br>
name identifiers into the commands generated by the IME/S 116 and the system<br>
KBD/S, respectively, to prevent unwanted feedback from the IME/S 116 to the<br>
operating system 35. Specifically, the system IME/S bridge 124 and the KBD/s<br>
bridge 126 change the WM_CHAR keyboard commands to WM_IME_CHAR<br>
keyboard commands to indicate that the message have already been processed<br>
by the system IME/S 116 or the system KBD/S, respectively.<br>
Composed characters created by an IME are returned to the windows manager<br>
108, which passes the composed characters to one or more components,<br>
represented by the component 122. The component 122 translates composed<br>
characters into operating system commands that are understood by the screen<br>
driver 104 of the operating system 35. Specifically, the JAVA component 122<br>
implements a sequence of commands including a "key event" command, a "post<br>
event" command, and a "key down" command to render images on the monitor<br>
47, as is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The component 122 typically renders a user interface that includes one or more<br>
tool bars including a number of editing tools. The user interface is displayed on<br>
the monitor 47 in association with a composed character returned by an IME.<br>
The user interface allows the component 122 to receive user commands to<br>
further manipulate the composed character. For example, the component 122<br>
may cause a composed character received from an IME to be displayed within<br>
the user interface. The component 122 may then accept user commands created<br>
with the editing tools of the user interface to alter or augment the composed<br>
character. The component 122 thus integrates an IME with a JAVA-based user<br>
interface for manipulating the composed characters returned by the IME.<br>
Alternatively, the virtual machine 100 allows the active IME to draw a composed<br>
character within a drawing space controlled by another program module, such as<br>
a word processor or editor.<br>
FIG. 3 is a logic flow diagram that illustrates a first routine 300 for operating the<br>
windows manager 108 within the virtual machine 100. In step 302, the windows<br>
manager 108 waits for an event. The windows manager 108 typically receives<br>
two types of events, keyboard commands from the operating system 35, and<br>
IME messages, including composed characters and other system IME messages,<br>
from an IME. In step 304, the windows manager 108 receives an event, in this<br>
case a keyboard command from the operating system.<br>
In step 306, the windows manager 108 determines whether the virtual machine<br>
100 includes an active IMM, represented by the IMM 110. If the virtual machine<br>
100 does not include an active IMM, the "NO" branch is followed to step 308, in<br>
which the windows manager 108 passes the Unicode translation of the keyboard<br>
command to the component 122. If the virtual machine 100 includes an active<br>
IMM, the "YES" branch is followed to step 310, in which the windows manager<br>
108 passes the Unicode translation of the keyboard command to the IMM 110.<br>
Depending on the type of command, the IMM 110 may accept the event, or the<br>
IMM 110 may refuse the event. In step 311, the windows manager 108 checks<br>
whether the IMM accepted the event. The windows manager 108 preferably<br>
performs this query by receiving a return message from the Handled Key method<br>
of the Input Manager Listener Interface, which was called to pass the keyboard<br>
command to the IMM 110. If the IMM 100 returns 'TRUE" indicating that the<br>
IMM accepted the event, the "YES" branch loops to step 302, in which the<br>
windows manager 108 waits for another event. If the IMM 100 returns "FALSE"<br>
indicating that the IMM refused the event, the "NO" branch loops to step 308, in<br>
which the windows manager 108 passes the event to the component 122.<br>
Following step 308, routine 300 loops to step 302, in which the windows<br>
manager 108 waits for another event. The query of step 311 allows certain<br>
events to be passed to the component 122 after the IMM 110 refuses to accept<br>
the events. Thus, the windows manager 108 processes each event by passing<br>
the event to the IMM 110, or by passing the event to the component 122 for<br>
further processing and eventual rendering on the monitor 47.<br>
FIG. 4 is a logic flow diagram that illustrates a second method 400 for operating<br>
a windows manager within the virtual machine 100. In step 402, the windows<br>
manager 108 waits for an event. In step 404, the windows manager 108 receives<br>
an event, in this case a composed character or other system IME messages from<br>
an IME. The IME preferably passes the event to the windows manager 108 by<br>
calling the Handle IME Message method of the Input Method Callback Interface.<br>
In step 406, the windows manager 108 determines whether the component 122<br>
implements the Input Method Message Listener Interface. If the component 122<br>
implements the Input Method Message Listener Interface, the "YES" branch is<br>
followed to step 408, in which the windows manager 108 passes the event to the<br>
component 122. The windows manager 108 preferably passes the event to the<br>
component 122 by calling the Handle IME Message method of the Input Method<br>
Message Listener Interface. If the component 122 does not implement the Input<br>
Method Message Listener Interface, the "NO" branch is followed to step 412, in<br>
which the windows manager 108 passes the event directly to the active IME.<br>
Referring again to step 408, the component 122 may accept the event, or the<br>
component 122 may reject the event. If the component 122 accepts the event,<br>
the component preferably returns "TRUE" to the Handle IME Message command.<br>
If the component 122 rejects the event, the component preferably returns<br>
"FALSE" to the Handle IME Message command. In step 410, the windows<br>
manager 108 determines whether the component 122 returns "TRUE." If the<br>
component 122 returns "TRUE," the "YES" branch loops to step 402, in which the<br>
windows manager waits for another event. If the component 122 returns<br>
"FALSE," the "NO" branch is followed to step 412, in which the windows<br>
manager 108 passes the event to the event to the active IME. Following step<br>
412, routine 400 loops to step 402, in which the windows manager 108 waits for<br>
another event.<br>
Routine 400 thus passes each IME message, including composed characters and<br>
other system IME commands, to the component 122 or to the active IME.<br>
Permitting the windows manager 108 to pass the IME either to the component<br>
122 or to the active IME allows a JAVA system developer to configure either the<br>
component 122 or the IME to accept a particular IME message. Therefore, JAVA<br>
system developers may select IME messages that they are interested in to be<br>
processed by the component, and leave other IME messages to the IME for<br>
default processing. The objective of this feature is to provide the JAVA system<br>
developers with flexibility in designing the components and the IME on a case-<br>
by-case basis.<br>
FIG. 5 is a logic flow diagram that illustrates a routine 500 for operating the IMM<br>
110 within the virtual machine 100. In step 502, the IMM 110 waits for an event,<br>
typically a Unicode translation of a WM.sub.-- KEYUP or WM.sub.-- KEYDOWN<br>
keyboard command received from the windows manager 108. In step 504, the<br>
IMM 110 receives an event from the windows manager 108. In step 506, the<br>
IMM 110 determines whether the event is an IMM command. If the event is an<br>
IMM command, the "YES" branch is followed from step 506 to step 508, in which<br>
the IMM 110 responds to the IMM command, for example by deactivating the<br>
previously-active IME and activating the indicated IME. The IMM preferably<br>
deactivates the previously-active IME by calling the Deactivate method of the<br>
Input Method Listener Interface, and activates the indicated IME by calling the<br>
Activate method of the Input Method Listener Interface. Step 508 is followed by<br>
step 510, in which the IMM 110 returns 'TRUE" to the windows manager 108<br>
indicating that the event has been accepted by the IMM. After step 510, routine<br>
500 loops to step 502, in which the IMM 110 waits for another event.<br>
Referring again to step 506, if the event is not an IMM command, the "NO"<br>
branch is followed from step 506 to step 512, in which the IMM 110 determines<br>
whether the virtual machine 100 includes an active IME. If the virtual machine<br>
100 includes an active IME, the "YES" branch is followed to step 412, in which<br>
the IMM 110 passes the event to the active IME. The IMM 110 preferably passes<br>
the event to the active IMM by calling the Handle Key method of the Input<br>
Method Listener Interface. Step 514 is followed by step 516, in which the IMM<br>
110 gets the return value from the active IME and passes the return value to the<br>
windows manager 108, indicating that the event has been accepted by the IMM.<br>
After step 516, routine 500 loops to step 502, in which the IMM 110 waits for<br>
another event.<br>
Referring again to step 512, if the virtual machine 100 does not include an<br>
active IME, the "NO" branch is followed from step 512 to step 518, in which the<br>
IMM 110 returns "FALSE" to the windows manager 108, indicating that the event<br>
has been refused by the IMM. After step 518, routine 500 loops to step 502, in<br>
which the IMM 110 waits for another event. Thus, the IMM 100 processes each<br>
event by deactivating a previously-activated IME and activating an indicated IME<br>
(and returning "TRUE" to the windows manager 108), passing the event to the<br>
active IME (and passing the return value from the IME to the windows manager<br>
108), or returning "FALSE" to the windows manager 108 indicating that the IMM<br>
refused the event.<br>
FIG. 6 is a schematic block diagram that illustrates the Input Method Listener<br>
Interface 600 implemented by an IME that is compatible with the virtual machine<br>
100. An IME or KBD, such as the representative IME/J 112, must implement the<br>
Input Method Listener Interface compatible with the virtual machine 100. The<br>
Input Method Listener Interface 600 preferably includes a first interface method<br>
HANDLE KEY 602. The HANDLE KEY interface method 602 is called by the IMM<br>
110 to pass a keyboard command to the IME/J 112. For example, the keyboard<br>
command passed to the IME/J 112 may be the Unicode translation of a WM--<br>
KEYUP or WM-KEYDOWN keyboard command that was passed to the IMM 110<br>
by the windows manager 108. The IME/J 112 returns "TRUE" if the IME accepts<br>
the keyboard command, and returns "FALSE" if the IME does not accept the<br>
command.<br>
The HANDLE KEY interface method 602 preferably includes five operands:<br>
"imeCallback"--identifies the callback object that implements the Input Method<br>
Callback Interface (the windows manager 108); "when"--the time that the<br>
HANDLE KEY method was called; "keyCode"--the virtual key code of the<br>
keyboard command; "keyChar"--the Unicode key character of the keyboard<br>
command; and "state"--the state of the keyboard 40 modifiers (indicating key up<br>
or key down and whether the ALT, CTRL, or SHIFT keys are depressed) when<br>
the HANDLE KEY method was called.<br>
The Input Method Listener Interface 600 preferably includes a second interface<br>
method ACTIVATE 604. The ACTIVATE interface method 604 is called by the<br>
IMM 110 to activate an indicated IME. The ACTIVATE interface method 604<br>
preferably includes an operand ("ime") that indicates an IME to be activated. The<br>
ACTIVATE interface method 604 does not involve a return message.<br>
The Input Method Listener Interface 600 preferably includes a third interface<br>
method DEACTIVATE 606. The DEACTIVATE interface method 606 is called by<br>
the IMM 110 to deactivate the currently active IME. The ACTIVATE interface<br>
method 606 does not require an operand and does not involve a return message.<br>
The Input Method Listener Interface 600 preferably includes a fourth interface<br>
method SET POSITION 608. The SET POSITION interface method 608 is called<br>
by the component 122 to set the position of the composed character on the<br>
display screen of the monitor 47. The SET POSITION interface method 608<br>
includes operands indicating a coordinate ("x,y") on the display screen of the<br>
monitor 47. The SET POSITION interface method 608 does not involve a return<br>
message.<br>
The Input Method Listener Interface 600 preferably includes a fifth interface<br>
method SET SIZE 610. The SET SIZE interface method 608 is called by the<br>
component 122 to set the size of the composed character on the display screen<br>
of the monitor 47. The SET SIZE interface method 608 includes an operand<br>
indicating a graphics object ("g") that determines the size of the composed<br>
character on the display screen of the monitor 47. The graphics object ("g") may<br>
also determine the font and color of the composed character as it appears on the<br>
display screen of the monitor 47. The SET SIZE interface method 610 returns a<br>
null value.<br>
The Input Method Listener Interface 600 preferably includes a sixth interface<br>
method PAINT 612. The PAINT interface method 612 is called by the component<br>
122 to cause the IME to paint composed character(s) and/or an associated user<br>
interface on a particular graphics object. The PAINT interface method 612<br>
includes an operand indicating the graphics object ("g"). The PAINT interface<br>
method 612 does not involve a return message.<br>
The Input Method Listener Interface 600 preferably includes a seventh interface<br>
method SET VISIBLE COMPONENT 614. The SET VISIBLE COMPONENT interface<br>
method 614 is called by the component 122 to set the component 122 as the<br>
object that will control the IME's drawing space. The SET VISIBLE COMPONENT<br>
interface method 614 includes an operand indicating the component ("c") that<br>
will control the IME's drawing space, in this example the component 122. The<br>
SET VISIBLE COMPONENT interface method 614 does not involve a return<br>
message. The SET VISIBLE COMPONENT interface method 614 allows the IME to<br>
draw composed characters within a drawing space controlled by the component<br>
122, typically a user interface displayed on the monitor 47 that includes one or<br>
more tool bars including a number of editing tools. If the SET VISIBLE<br>
COMPONENT interface method 614 is not called, the IME typically draws the<br>
composed character within a drawing space controlled by the IME. Alternatively,<br>
the IME may draw the composed character within a drawing space controlled by<br>
another program module, such as a word processor or editor.<br>
The Input Method Listener Interface 600 preferably includes an eighth interface<br>
method HANDLE IME MESSAGE 616. The HANDLE IME MESSAGE interface<br>
method 616 is called by the windows manager 108 to pass a particular IME<br>
message to the IME. The HANDLE IME MESSAGE interface method 616 includes<br>
the particular IME message, which derives from the abstract Input Method<br>
Message class, as an operand. The HANDLE IME MESSAGE interface method 616<br>
does not involve a return message. An IME message is typically generated by the<br>
IME and passed to the callback object, the windows manager 108. If the<br>
windows manager does not handle the IME message, the windows manager<br>
passes the IME message back to the IME by calling the HANDLE IME MESSAGE<br>
interface method 616. This gives the windows manager 108 an opportunity to<br>
handle the IME message. If the windows manager does not handle the IME<br>
message, the IME typically implements a default condition. In other words, the<br>
IME "listens" for windows manager 108 activity in responses to an IME message,<br>
and the IME implements a default condition if the windows manager 108 does<br>
not handle the IME message.<br>
FIG. 7 is a schematic block diagram that illustrates the Input Manager Listener<br>
Interface 700 for the IMM 100 of the virtual machine 100. The Input Manager<br>
Listener Interface 700 preferably includes a first interface method GET INPUT<br>
METHOD 702. The GET INPUT METHOD interface method 702 is called by the<br>
windows manager 108 to ask the IMM 110 which IME is active. The GET INPUT<br>
METHOD 702 involves a return message that includes an operand ("idx") that<br>
specifies an index associated with the currently active IME.<br>
The Input Manager Listener Interface 700 preferably includes a second interface<br>
method GET NUMBER INPUT METHODS 704. The GET NUMBER INPUT<br>
METHODS interface method 704 is called by the windows manager 108 to ask<br>
the IMM 110 how many IMEs are registered with the IMM. The GET NUMBER<br>
INPUT METHODS interface method 704 involves a return message that<br>
enumerates the IMEs that are registered with the IMM. For example, the IMM<br>
may return a message that includes an operand that specifies the number of<br>
IMEs registered with the IMM. Alternatively, the IMM may return a list of the<br>
IMEs that are registered with the IMM.<br>
The Input Manager Listener Interface 700 preferably includes a third interface<br>
method REMOVE INPUT METHOD 706. The REMOVE INPUT METHOD interface<br>
method 706 is called by the windows manager 108 to ask the IMM 110 remove a<br>
particular IME from the registered list of IMEs maintained by the IMM. The<br>
REMOVE INPUT METHOD interface method 706 includes an operand ("ime") that<br>
indicates the particular IME to be removed from the registered list. The REMOVE<br>
INPUT METHOD interface method 706 does not involve a return message.<br>
The Input Manager Listener Interface 700 preferably includes a fourth interface<br>
method SET INPUT METHOD 708. The SET INPUT METHOD interface method<br>
708 is called by the windows manager 108 to ask the IMM 110 to activate a<br>
particular IME on the registered list of IMEs maintained by the IMM. The SET<br>
INPUT METHOD interface method 708 includes an operand ("ime") that indicates<br>
the particular IME to be activated. The SET INPUT METHOD interface method<br>
708 does not involve a return message.<br>
The Input Manager Listener Interface 700 preferably includes a fifth interface<br>
method HANDLED KEY 710. The HANDLED KEY interface method 710 is called by<br>
the windows manager 108 to ask the IMM 110 to handle a keyboard command,<br>
typically a Unicode translation of a WM-CHAR keyboard command. The<br>
HANDLED KEY interface method 710 includes an operand ("ime") that indicates<br>
the particular IME to be activated. The SET input method interface method 708<br>
does not involve a return message.<br>
The HANDLED KEY interface method 710 preferably includes five operands:<br>
"imeCallback"--identifies the callback object that implements the Input Method<br>
Callback Interface (the windows manager 108); "when"--the time that the<br>
HANDLED KEY method was called; "keyCode"--the ASCII key code of the<br>
keyboard command; "keyChar"--the Unicode key character of the keyboard<br>
command; and "state"--the state of the keyboard 40 modifiers (indicating key up<br>
or key down and whether the ALT, CTRL, or SHIFT keys are depressed) when<br>
the HANDLE KEY method was called.<br>
FIG. 8 is a schematic block diagram that illustrates the Input Method Callback<br>
Interface 800 for the windows manager 108 of the virtual machine 100. The<br>
Input Method Callback Interface 800 preferably includes a first interface method<br>
HANDLE IME CHAR 802. The HANDLE IME CHAR interface method 802 is called<br>
by an IME to pass a particular composed character to the windows manager 108.<br>
The windows manager 108 adds the composed character, which may be based<br>
on a composite string including a number of keyboard commands, to the internal<br>
input queue as if it was a single character received from the keyboard 40. The<br>
HANDLE IME CHAR interface method 802 includes three operands: "when"--that<br>
time that the HANDLE IME CHAR interface method 802 was called; "keyChar"-<br>
the Unicode key character of the composed character; and "state"--the state of<br>
the keyboard 40 modifiers (indicating key up or key down and whether the ALT,<br>
CTRL, or SHIFT keys are depressed) when the HANDLE IME CHAR interface<br>
method 802 was called. The HANDLE IME CHAR interface method 802 does not<br>
involve a return message.<br>
The Input Method Callback Interface 800 preferably includes a second interface<br>
method HANDLE IME MESSAGE 804. The HANDLE IME MESSAGE interface<br>
method 804 is called by an IME to pass a particular IME message to the windows<br>
manager 108. The HANDLE IME MESSAGE interface method 804 includes the<br>
particular IME message as an operand. The HANDLE IME MESSAGE interface<br>
method 804 does not involve a return message. An IME message is typically<br>
generated by the IME and passed to the callback object, the windows manager<br>
108. If the windows manager does not handle the IME message, the windows<br>
manager passes the IME message back to the IME by calling the HANDLE IME<br>
MESSAGE interface method 616 of the Input Method Listener Interface. This<br>
gives the windows manager 108 an opportunity to handle the IME message.<br>
FIG. 9 is a schematic block diagram that illustrates the Input Method Message<br>
Listener Interface 900 for the component 122 of the virtual machine 100. Input<br>
Method Message Listener Interface 900 preferably includes an interface method<br>
HANDLE IME MESSAGE interface method 902 that is called by the windows<br>
manager 108. This method is called by the windows manager 108 to ask the<br>
component 122 whether the component will draw and control a user interface<br>
that the user may use to manipulate a composed character returned by an IME.<br>
The HANDLE IME MESSAGE interface method 902 may include an IME message,<br>
which derives from the abstract class Input Method Message, as an operand. The<br>
HANDLE IME MESSAGE interface method 902 involves a return message that<br>
indicates whether the component 122 will draw and control a user interface. The<br>
component 122 returns "TRUE" if the component will draw and control a user<br>
interface, and the component 122 returns "FALSE" if the component will not<br>
draw and control a user interface.<br>
FIG. 10A is a schematic block diagram that illustrates a prior art method for<br>
handling keyboard commands. The user depresses a key on the keyboard 40.<br>
The keyboard command is translated into keyboard commands by the keyboard<br>
driver 102, which is typically a module of the operating system 35. The keyboard<br>
driver 102 translates each keystroke into three keyboard commands that may be<br>
handled and interpreted individually: WM.sub.-- KEYDOWN--indicating that a key<br>
has been depressed, WM.sub.-- CHAR--typically an ASCII code or value<br>
associated with the depressed key, and WM.sub.-- KEYUP--indicating that a key<br>
has been released. These keyboard commands are delivered to an application<br>
program 36, such as a word processing program, an editor, or the like. The<br>
application program 36 interprets the keyboard commands in accordance with<br>
functionality defined by the application program. The application then passes a<br>
screen update to the screen driver 104, which drives the monitor 47.<br>
FIG. 10B is a schematic block diagram that illustrates a prior art for<br>
implementing a system IME 116. The user depresses a key on the keyboard 40.<br>
The keyboard command is translated into keyboard commands by the keyboard<br>
driver 102. The keyboard driver 102 translates each keystroke into the WM.<br>
KEYDOWN, WM.CHAR, and WM-KEYUP keyboard commands. These keyboard<br>
commands are delivered to the system IME 116, which translates the keyboard<br>
commands into a composed character.<br>
The system IME/S 116 is typically configured to accumulate several keyboard<br>
commands to construct a composite string for a composed character. The use of<br>
multiple-keyboard command composite strings allows the system IME/S 116 to<br>
index thousands of individual composed characters, which is very useful for<br>
generating calligraphic ideograms in non-Latin languages including Japanese,<br>
Korean, and Chinese. The system IME/S 116 then passes the composed<br>
character to the application program 36. The application program 36 interprets<br>
the keyboard commands in accordance with functionality defined by the<br>
application program. The application then passes a screen update to the screen<br>
driver 104, which drives the monitor 47.<br>
37<br>
FIG. 11 is a schematic block diagram that illustrates the virtual machine 100<br>
supporting the system IME/S 116 in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The user depresses a key on the keyboard 40. The keyboard<br>
command is translated into keyboard commands by the keyboard driver 102. The<br>
keyboard driver 102 translates each keyboard command into the WM-<br>
KEYDOWN, WM.CHAR, and WM-KEYUP keyboard commands. The keyboard<br>
commands are passed to the system IME/S 116, which generates a composed<br>
character based on the keyboard commands.<br>
The system IME/S 116 passes the composed character to the windows manager<br>
108, which includes a Unicode translator that translates the composed character<br>
into Unicode format. The windows manager 108 passes the composed character<br>
in Unicode format to the component 122, which typically renders a user interface<br>
that allows the user to manipulate the composed character. The component 122<br>
then passes a screen update to the screen driver 104, which drives the monitor<br>
47.<br>
FIG. 12 is a schematic block diagram that illustrates the virtual machine 100<br>
implementing the JAVA-based IME/J 112 in accordance with an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The user depresses a key on the keyboard 40. The<br>
keyboard command is translated into keyboard commands by the keyboard<br>
driver 102. The keyboard driver 102 translates each keyboard command into the<br>
WM-KEYDOWN, WM.CHAR, and WM-KEYUP keyboard commands. These<br>
keyboard commands are delivered to the windows manager 108 of the virtual<br>
machine 100.<br>
The windows manager 108 includes a Unicode translator that translates the<br>
keyboard commands into Unicode format. The windows manager 108 passes the<br>
Unicode keyboard commands to the IMM 110. The IMM 110 passes the Unicode<br>
keyboard commands to the JAVA-based IME/J 112, which translates the Unicode<br>
keyboard commands into a composed character. The JAVA-based IME/J 112<br>
passes the composed character back to the windows manager 108, which passes<br>
the composed character to the component 122. The component 122 typically<br>
renders a user interface that allows the user to manipulate the composed<br>
characters. The component 122 then passes a screen update to the screen driver<br>
104, which drives the monitor 47.<br>
FIG. 13 is a schematic block diagram that illustrates the virtual machine 100<br>
hosting the system IME/S 116 in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The user depresses a key on the keyboard 40. The keyboard<br>
command is translated into keyboard commands by the keyboard driver 102,<br>
which is typically a module of the operating system 35. The keyboard driver 102<br>
translates each keyboard command into the WM_KEYDOWN, WM_CHAR, and WM_<br>
KEYUP keyboard commands. These keyboard commands are delivered to the<br>
system IME/S 116, which may build multiple keyboard commands into a<br>
composite string including multiple WM_CHAR and WM_IME_CHAR keyboard<br>
commands.<br>
The system IME/S 116 passes the composite string and system IME messages to<br>
the windows manager 108 of the virtual machine 100. The windows manager<br>
108 includes a Unicode translator that translates the composite string from WM_<br>
IME-CHAR format into Unicode format. The windows manager 108 passes the<br>
Unicode composite string to the component 122. The system IME/S bridge 124<br>
may also exchange queries and other system IME messages with the system<br>
IME/S 116. That is, the system IME/S 116 passes system IME messages to the<br>
system IME/S bridge 124 The system IME/S bridge translates these system IME<br>
messages into Input Method Message-derived messages and passes these<br>
messages back to the windows manager 108 by calling the HANDLE IME<br>
MESSAGE method 804 of the INPUT METHOD CALLBACK interface 800. The<br>
system IME/S bridge 124 the passes the composite string back to the windows<br>
manager 108, which passes the composed character to the component 122. The<br>
component 122 typically renders a user interface that allows the user to<br>
manipulate the composed characters. The component 122 then passes a screen<br>
update to the screen driver 104, which drives the monitor 47.<br>
In view of the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the present invention<br>
provides a JAVA virtual machine that may be used to alter or augment the source<br>
code for IMEs on an as-needed basis. The present invention also defines a<br>
controlling interface for creating a JAVA-compatible IME. A JAVA-based virtual<br>
machine according to the present invention supports input method editor (IME)<br>
functionality in three contexts: (1) using JAVA-based IMEs with a JAVA virtual<br>
machine; (2) writing JAVA-based IMEs; and (3) integrating a JAVA virtual<br>
machine to system IMEs. The virtual machine includes a windows manager, an<br>
input method manager, one or more IMEs and/or KBDs, and a component. The<br>
component typically renders a user interface that allows the user to manipulate<br>
the composed characters returned by the IME. The virtual machine may also<br>
include an IME bridge for integrating the virtual machine with a system IME. The<br>
windows manager serves as a gateway between the operating system and the<br>
virtual machine. The input method manager (IMM) serves as a router between<br>
the windows manager and a plurality of IMEs and KBDs. The IME includes a<br>
look-up table of composed characters that are indexed by Unicode keyboard<br>
commands.<br>
