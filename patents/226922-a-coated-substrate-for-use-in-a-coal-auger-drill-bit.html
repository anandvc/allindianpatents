				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a coated substrate. By way of example, but without implying any<br>
limitation thereto, the coated substrate may advantageously be employed as a ceramic<br>
coated coal auger drill bit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Drilling in hand section coal mining increases, the production of coal, if uninterrupted<br>
drilling is accomplished. The capability of drilling depends on the cutting edge and the<br>
cutting surface of the drill. Thus, the drill bit attached to the drill rod plays an important<br>
role in the rate of penetration in the coal and its ability to remain in a cold condition and<br>
maintain a sharpness of the cutting edge, and assist easy flow of debris over the cutting<br>
surface and the flutes. Such a sharpness of the cutting edge is more critical in instances of<br>
hard coal and coal seam with stone bands or drilling in roof with stone or shale or in<br>
development section containing stone or coal seam with stone band.<br>
In the know art, drill bits are fabricated from strong and stable cutting edge of carbides,<br>
and particularly tungsten carbide with the substrate being the body of the drill bit.<br>
However, such drill bits are unable to maintain a sharp cutting edge, especially while<br>
drilling in coal seam with stone band or in stone or in roof drilling. It has been found that<br>
when the drill bit contacts hard coal or shale or coal seam during a drilling operation, the<br>
cutting edge gets blunt and immediately breaks and with the consequence that a<br>
penetration or drilling by the drill bit is adversely affected. In such an instance, debris are<br>
no longer formed. Simultaneously, the drill bit continues to drill at the same location<br>
resulting in a generation of heat at the cutting edge. Such a presence of heat, which often<br>
is higher than the brazing temperature of tungsten carbide results in a softening of the<br>
joint between tungsten carbide and seat of the body.<br><br>
In order to obviate such a disadvantage, the known art has employed a high content of<br>
tungsten carbide in the cutting edge and cutting surface. However, the tungsten carbide<br>
content increases the brittleness, which results in cracking or breaking of the tungsten<br>
carbide tips.<br>
In both of the aforesaid instances, the edges are subjected to the step of resharpening<br>
resulting in a loss of the tungsten carbide tip. Further, a drilling operation is discontinued<br>
for change of the blunt or broken tip or losing the tip itself which chips off into the<br>
debris, and thereby reducing coal production.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved coal auger drilling bit.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a coal auger drilling bit, which obviates the<br>
disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a coal auger drilling bit, which avoids<br>
the numerous breakages or cracks associated with the drilling bits of the known art.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a coal auger drilling bit which avoids<br>
subjecting the drill bit to frequent changes.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a coal auger drilling bit which avoids<br>
constant resharpening of the drill bit.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose a coal auger drilling bit having a<br>
higher hardness, sharpness and toughness in comparison to that of the prior art.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a coated substrate which may, for example,<br>
be advantageously employed in a coal auger drill bit comprising<br>
I.	a metallic body<br>
II.	at least one shaped support held to a support seat provided on said metallic body,<br>
and<br>
III.	a refractory metal based ceramic layer or coating on the working surface and<br>
working edge of said support.<br>
The present invention resides in the provision of a ceramic layer on the support. As<br>
described hereinabove, reference to a coated substrate is intended to include a coal auger<br>
drill bit. Thus, one of the advantageous applications of the coated substrate is that of a<br>
ceramic-coated coal drill auger bit.<br>
When the drill bit of the known art contacted hard coal or coal seam with stone bands, the<br>
cutting surface and cutting edge would crack or break, and the initiation of the crack<br>
propagated beyond the cutting edge and into the body of cutting surface of tungsten<br>
carbide. To obviate such a disadvantage, it is known to add 4 to 6%. by weight of cobalt<br>
powder to tungsten carbide powder, which is then compacted and formed into a shape<br>
and finally sintered to form cemented carbide. The presence of cobalt is to reduce the<br>
hardness of tungsten carbide. It is recognized that if tungsten carbide has a high value of<br>
hardness, it becomes brittle and which is one of the factors that contribute to the<br>
formation of cracks. The presence of cobalt, which is a comparatively soft material,<br>
firstly bonds tungsten carbide powder and, secondly, reduces the hardness value of<br>
tungsten carbide. Simultaneously, it was recognized in the prior art, that the addition of a<br>
greater amount of cobalt would considerably reduce the hardness value of tungsten<br>
carbide, which is not a desired feature as in the known art the tungsten carbide constituted<br>
the cutting surface and edge.<br><br>
In distinction, the present invention no longer has a cutting surface or cutting edge of<br>
tungsten carbide as known from the prior art. Instead, the tungsten carbide forms only a<br>
shaped support for the cutting surface or cutting edge.<br>
As the tungsten carbide forms now only a support for the cutting surface and cutting<br>
edge, it has now been found that upto 18% of a toughening agent may be added to<br>
tungsten carbide to form the support. Though the support does not by itself form the<br>
cutting surface and cutting edge, it must simultaneously have sufficient strength to<br>
withstand the tensile forces acting on it during a drilling operation and suitably act a<br>
support for the cutting surface and cutting edge. Accordingly, it has now been found that<br>
the hardness value of tungsten carbide need not be as high as when it was used as a<br>
cutting surface and cutting edge, and also not too low so as not to be capable of<br>
supporting the cutting surface and cutting edge during a drilling operation.<br>
In accordance with the present, 8 to 12% by weight of a toughening agent is preferably<br>
added to tungsten carbide. It has been found that the presence of 8 to 12% by weight of<br>
the toughening agent in tungsten carbide removes inherent brittleness of tungsten<br>
carbide, but has sufficient strength to act as a physical support for the cutting surface and<br>
cutting edge during a drilling operation. Yet another function of the support is to form a<br>
metallurgical bond between the ceramic cutting surface and cutting edge, and thereby<br>
metallurgically increasing its own hardness at the interface.<br>
The support comprises a shaped body formed by powdered metallurgy or casting.<br>
Further, the support comprises essentially of tungsten carbide, though other metals may<br>
alternatively be used. Such other metals are selected from nickel, chromium, vanadium,<br>
molybdenum, cobalt, titanium and their alloys or their carbides, or both the combination<br>
of alloys, carbides, nitrides, oxides and boxides. Further, if tungsten carbide is used as<br>
the primary metal, then the alloying element can be selected from any one or more of the<br>
aforesaid metals.<br><br>
The support should have a thickness of at least 2 mm. Preferably, the support can have<br>
a thickness of upto 8 mm, though higher thickness could be employed but which would<br>
then constitute a waste.<br>
The support is held to the seats of the bit by the step of silver alloy brazing. The alloy<br>
employed for the step of brazing comprises essentially of silver, for example 40 to 60%<br>
by weight of silver, and the balance being selected from cadmium, copper, manganese<br>
and nickel. The brazing alloy is employed in the form of shim, film or thin plate and<br>
having a thickness of 0.1 to 0.5 mm. The process consists in applying the brazing flux to<br>
the support or the seat of the drill bit or both, which is then heated in a high frequency<br>
induction heater so as to allow the alloy to melt and fuses the silver brazing alloy.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the cutting surface and cutting edge comprises a<br>
refractory metal ceramic coating or layer applied over the working surface of the support.<br>
Preferably, such a ceramic coating is applied over the entire exposed surface of the<br>
support. Such a refractory metal based ceramic layer functions to increase the hardness<br>
of the support. The ceramic layer or coating is selected from refractory metals<br>
comprising titanium, vanadium, chromium tungsten cobalt or molybdenum and present<br>
in the metallic form or as nitrate, carbide, oxide or boride presently singularly or in any<br>
combination.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the ceramic coating or film has a thickness of 5 to 10<br>
microns and may be deposited by any known method, such as physical vapour deposition<br>
or chemical vapour deposition.<br>
Such a ceramic layer substantially increases the hardness of the cutting surface and edges<br>
and improves the cutting properties and performance.<br><br>
Further, the ceramic coating has a smooth cutting surface and cutting edge and a low<br>
coefficient of friction and in comparison to the tungsten carbide of the known art. Such a<br>
low coefficient of friction assists free flow of debris formed during drilling without any<br>
flow restriction. This free flow of debris dissipates the heat generated during drilling and<br>
keeps the cutting edge cool and prevents build up of mug at the cutting edge.<br>
In the known art, tungsten carbide has high coefficient of friction in comparison to the<br>
present ceramic film. In the old art tungsten carbide formed the cutting edge and cutting<br>
surface and in direct contact with the coal, or coal seam with stone band or hard coal or<br>
shale. Hence, heat generated was not dissipated fast and the cutting edge was not cooled<br>
and there was more chance of a mug formation in the cutting edge which reduced the<br>
efficiency of cutting and ultimately contributed to the breaking/loosening the brazing<br>
joint and loss of tungsten carbide tips.<br>
