In addition the under bracket 39C is shaped such that the steering shaft 33 can be coupled thereto at an intermediate portion between the reinforcement shaft 34E and the reinforcement shaft 34F'.<br>
Also in this modified example, inverted front forks 41L and 41R are substituted for the upright front forks 40L and 40R. (Modified examples of straddle-type vehicle)<br>
Now, a modified example of the straddle-type vehicle according to this embodiment will be described with reference to FIGs. 13 to 15. FIGs. 13 to 15 show a motorcycle 10A which is a partly modified form of the motorcycle 10 (see FIGs. 1 to 3) as the straddle-type vehicle according to this embodiment.<br>
In the following description, different parts than the motorcycle 10 will be mainly focused and similar parts may not be mentioned appropriately.<br>
FIGs. 13 to 15 are a left side view, a plan view and a front view, respectively, of the motorcycle 10A.<br>
In the motorcycle 10, the shape and the position of the radiator 61 are characteristic, with the radiator 61 disposed in an area including a side of the steering shaft 33 (head pipe 20hp).<br>
In the motorcycle 10A, the radiator 61A has a typical shape and is disposed forwardly of the engine 60.<br>
19<br><br>
Specifically the radiator 61A is attached to the body frame 20.<br>
Meanwhile, in the motorcycle 10A, at least a part of reserve talks 625 and 62P. (coolant tanks) for storing coolant to be supplied to the radiator 61A is disposed at a side of the steering shaft 33 (head pipe 20hp). (Function ana errect)<br>
According to this embodiment, the reinforcement shaft (for example, the reinforcement shaft 34) is disposed at least forwardly or rearwardly of the steering shaft (for example, the steering shaft 33) . Thus, the rigidity of the wheel suspension device (for example, the front wheel suspension device FS1) can be enhanced, even in the case where the steering shaft 33 is disposed above the upper ends 40e of the front forks 40L and 40R, that is, the upper ends 40e of the front forks 40L and 40R does not extend to the top bridge (for example, the top bridge 32).<br>
Also, the reinforcement shaft 34 is disposed forwardly or rearwardly of the steering shaft 33, not at a side thereof Thus, spaces on the left and right sides of the steering shaft 33 (head pipe 20hp) are advantageously not occupied, unlike with a typical conventional pole of forks which extend from the left and right sides of the front wheel 50 to the top bridge 32.<br>
20<br><br>
Thus, variable parts can be disposed in the spaces on the left and right sides of the steering shaft 33 (head pipe 20hp) with increased flexibility. For example, as described above, relatively heavy or large parts such as the radiator 61 and the reserve tanks 62L and 62R may be disposed in these spaces. In addition, such parts may be collectively positioned around the longitudinal centerline of the motorcycle 10 (or the motorcycle 10A; the same applies below).<br>
Heavy palls disposed in these spaces increase the load to be carried by the front wheel 50. The increased load carried by the front wheel 50 improves the stability of the motorcycle 10, especially during high-speed running.<br>
Conventionally, it has been difficult to shorten the wheelbase to a specific length or less while balancing the respective loads to be carried by the front wheel 50 and the rear wheel 70. According to this embodiment, however, it is easy to shorten the wheelbase of the motorcycle 10 while balancing such loads, thereby improving the moving performance.<br>
In addition, since the reinforcement shaft 34 is disposed forwardly or rearwardly of the steering shaft 33, the frontal projected area of the motorcycle 10 can be reduced easily.<br>
21<br><br>
In the case where the reinforcement shafts are disposed both forwardly and rearwardly as in the front wheel suspension device FS6, much higher rigidity can be ensured with the spaces on the left and right sides of the steering shaft 33 (head pipe 20hp) unoccupied.<br>
In this embodiment, upright forks are used as the front fork" 40T. and 40R. Compared to inverted fork?, upright forks bend suitably, whereby suitable rigidity for a wheel suspension device can be obtained easily.<br>
In the embodiment, the radiator 61, the reserve tank 62L and so forth are disposed in the spaces on the left and right sides of the head pipe 20hp. Thus, the radiator 61 and the reserve tanks 62L and 62R can be used as a heater to provide heat to the operator of the motorcycle 10 in extremely cold weather. [Second Embodiment]<br>
Now, description will be made of a second embodiment of the present invention with reference to FIGs. 16 to 18. The motorcycle 10 described in the first embodiment is mid- to large-sized and places emphasis on high-speed running performance and cornering performance.<br>

24<br><br>
the front wheel 150 is steerable. The steering shaft 133 is disposed above the upper end 140e of the front fork 140R.<br>
That is, also in the motorcycle 100, the front fork 140R does not extend to the top bridge 132 and the upper end 140e thereof is coupled to the under bracket 139.<br>
The reinforcement shaft 134 (reinforcement column) is provided to ensure and improve the rigidity of the front wheel suspension device FS100. The reinforcement shaft 134 is disposed rearwardly of the steering shaft 133 as viewed from a side of the motorcycle 100. (Function and effect)<br>
In the motorcycle 100, since spaces can be secured on the left and right sides of the steering shaft 133, the front end 165e of the fuel tank 165 extends to a position forwardly of the steering shaft 133 (head pipe 120hp) as viewed from a side of the motorcycle 100, Thus, the capacity of the fuel tank 165 can be increased, thereby incremaning the travel distance of the motorcycle 100.<br>
A front end 180e of the seat 180 extends to a position above a cylinder load 160a of the engine 160 as viewed from a side of the motorcycle 100. Thus, the seat 180 can be made longitudinally longer, thereby allowing<br>
25<br><br>
the operator and passenger of the motorcycle 100 to more freely selectively to sit, [Third Embodiment]<br>

(Function and effect)<br>
In the motorcycle 100A, the front end 165e of the fuel tank 165A is positioned forwardly of the steering shaft 133A as viewed from a side of the straddle-type vehicle 100A. That is, the head pipe 120hp, which receives the steering shaft 133A therethrough to rotatably support the steering shaft 133A, is covered by the fuel tank 165A as viewed from a side of the motorcycle 100A.<br>
Thus. the vicinity of the head pipe 120hp cannot be seen easily. In conventional types of motorcycle such as the motorcycle 100A, the vicinity of the head pipe 120hp can be seen entirely (for example/ see JP-B-Hei 06-15356).<br>
In general, the vicinity of the head pipe 120hp is in a mess with various harnesses and so forth, which can deteriorate the appearance of the Motorcycle. Thus, in some cases, the vicinity of the head pipe 120hp is desired to be concealed so as not to be seen. However, it has not been easy to conceal the vicinity of the head pipe 120hp without: using a dedicated part for improving the appearance such as an exterior cover.<br>
31<br><br>
In the motorcycle 100A, as described above, the front end 165e of the fuel tank 165A extends to a position forwardly of the steering shaft 133A as viewed from a side of the motorcycle 100A. Thus, the vicinity of the head pipe 120hp can be concealed without using a dedicated part for improving the appearance.<br>
In this embodiment, the front cowl 200 is fixed to the front end 165e of the fuel tank 165A. Thus, the vicinity of the head pipe 120hp can be seen less easily. The motorcycle 100A may not necessarily be provided with a front cowl 200.<br>
In this embodiment, the battery 185 is disposed close to the steering shaft 133A. Thus, the load to be carried by the Front wheel 150 increases. The increased load carried by the front wheel 150 improves the stability and operability of the motorcycle 100A. In this embodiment the battery 185 may not necessarily be disposed at a side of the steering shaft 133A.<br>
In this embodiment, since the fuel tank 165A extends to a position forwardly of the steering shaft 133A, the necessary capacity of the fuel tank 165A can be ensured and the fuel tank 165A can be located more forwardly. That is, the air cleaner 162 upper cleaner chamber 162b) can be provided in the gap between the fuel tank 165A and<br>
32<br><br>
the seat 180A formed by locating the fuel tank 165A more forwardly.<br>
In this way the capacity of the air cleaner 162 can be increased easily. In addition, since the carburetor 161 and the upper cleaner chamber 162b can be disposed above the engine 160, the carburetor 161 can be made as a downdraft type easily. The air cleaner 162 (upper cleaner chamber 162b) may not necessarily extend to the gap between the fuel tank 165A and the seat 180A.<br>
In this embodiment, the fuel tank 165A is supported by the support stays 121L and 121R for coupling the down tube 120d and the fuel tank 165A to each other. Thus, utilizing the shape of the down tube 120d extending downward from the head pipe 120hp, the fuel tank 165A can be supported reliably using the support stays 121L and 121R with a simple structure. The fuel tank 165A may be supported usinq a part other than the support stays 121L and 121R. [Other embodiments]<br>
