				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of hydrogen peroxide from hydrazine compound. More particularly, this invention relates to a process for the production of hydrogen peroxide from compound by its oxidation by oxygen using a solid catalyst comprising palladium with or without a halide promoter in the catalyst.<br>
The process of this invention can be used in the chemical and petrochemical industries for the production of hydrogen peroxide by the oxidation of hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt by oxygen, using a solid catalyst comprising palladium with or without halogen promoter, in an environmentally clean manner. <br>
Background of the invention<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is an environmentally clean and versatile oxidizing agent used extensively in paper and pulp industries as a bleaching agent, for water purification and disinfection, for wastewater treatments and also in the preparation of fine/bulk chemicals by various oxidation processes. Currently most widely practiced commercial scale production of hydrogen peroxide is based on an auto oxidation process employing alkyl anthraquinone as the working material. This process involves reduction of alkyl anthraquinone dissolved in an organic working solution to alkyl anthraquinol. The alkyl anthraquinol is oxidized by air to produce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl anthraquinone, which is recycled in this process. This process comprises a number of operations involving reduction, oxidation, separation by aqueous extractions, refining and concentration, making the process complex. Apart from the requirements of high capital and operation costs, this process has following limitations and disadvantages:<br>
Non-selective in hydrogenation, hence loss of anthraquinone.<br>
Difficulties   in   separation   hydrogenation   catalyst   and   degradation<br>
products.<br>
Need for the regenaration of used hydrogenation catalyst.<br>
Need for the removal of organic matters from the extracted H2O2<br>
solution.<br>
Waste treatment and disposal of undesired side products of the cyclic<br>
process. Demand for hydrogen peroxide has been increasing day-by-day for oxidizing organic   compounds  to   value   added   products,   waste-water  treatment   and   water disinfection. Hence, there is a great practical need for replacing the anthraquinone<br><br>
process by an environmentally clean and more economic process. A number of processes based on the direct oxidation of hydrogen-to-hydrogen peroxide, using a solid catalyst comprising palladium, were disclosed in several patents, for example U. S. patents 4,681,751; 4,772,458; 4,832,938; 4,889,705; 5,135,731; 5,169,618; 5,399,334; 6,534,440; EP 504,741, Al; WO 9412428 Al; EP 621,235 Al; GE 4,172,918; JP 01133909 A2; EP 366419 Al; WO 9314025 Al. However, the direct oxidation of hydrogen-to-hydrogen peroxide is a highly hazardous process and hence inspite of the extensive invention, this process is not yet commercialized. Apart from its hazardous nature, the direct hydrogen-to-hydrogen peroxide oxidation processes have other limitations such as lower selectivity in the formation of hydrogen peroxide, use of highly corrosive liquid medium for the reaction and low concentration of hydrogen peroxide produced in the process.<br>
Because of the limitations of the prior art processes for the production of hydrogen peroxide, there is a great practical need for developing a novel environ-friendly process for the production of hydrogen peroxide. The present invention was made for this purpose. Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of this invention was to provide a novel non-hazardous process for the production of hydrogen peroxide from hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt by its oxidation by oxygen in an aqueous reaction medium, using an easily separable and reusable solid catalyst, in an environmentally clean manner.

li)        separating the H2O2 from the reaction mixture.<br>
The palladium catalyst may contain a palladium metal with or without one or more of other noble metals, such as platinum, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium and osmium and also with or without one or more promoter metals, such as tin, gold and other metal promoters, supported on porous catalyst carriers, such as carbon, alumina, silica-alumina, silica, zeolites, zirconia, thona, ceria and other metal oxides or mixed metal oxides in form of power, particles, pellets, extrudes or monolith or structured catalyst supports. Examples of the solid catalyst comprising palladium are Pd or PdO, with or without Au, Ag, or other transition metal or metal oxides, supported on porous solids, such as metal oxides, e.g. AI2O3, S1O2, Z1O2, CeO2, TiO2, Y2O3, ThO2, Ga2O3, B2O3, and like or crystalline micro- or meso-porous zeolites, zeolite-like materials, such as metalosilicates or phosphates, known in the prior art. These catalysts may be prepared by impregnating palladium salt on the support or co-precipitation of mixed metal compounds, which on thermal decomposition are converted into oxides, followed by calcination at elevated temperature. The calcined catalysts may or may not be reduced by hydrogen, ammoniacal hydrazine or other methods known in the pnor art. The concentration of palladium in the catalyst may be between 0.1 wt% and 10wt%. Incorporation of halogen promoter in the solid catalyst of this invention may be carried out before or after the deposition of palladium on porous support used in the catalyst of this invention, by depositing halogen containing compound(s) on the catalyst or on the support by impregnating the halo compound(s) on the catalyst or the support, followed by calcination or passing vapor of the halo compound(s) over the catalyst or catalyst support. A number of inorganic or organic halo compounds, such as, ammonium hahdes, halogen hahdes and halo organic compounds are known in the prior art. A number of mineral acids, such as sulfuric acid, phosphonc acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid and the like are known in the prior art.<br>
In the process of this invention, the preferred mineral acid in the reaction medium is orthophosphoric acid or sulfunc acid; the preferred concentration of mineral acid in the reaction medium is between zero mol/dm3 and 1.0 mol/dm3; the preferred concentration of hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt in the reaction medium is between 0.01 mol/dm3 and 5.0 mol/dm3; the preferred concentration of halide anions in the reaction medium is between zero mmol/dm3 and 10.0 mmol/dm3; the preferred concentration of the solid catalyst in the reaction medium is between 0.2 g/dm and l0g/dm ; the preferred space velocity of oxygen containing gas is between 500 cm /g catalyst/h and 10,000 cm /g catalyst/h; the preferred reaction temperature is between 5°C and 70°C; the preferred reaction contact time is between 0.1 h and 5h; the preferred X in the N2H4.11X is H2SO4, HCl or H2O; the preferred halogen promoter in the catalyst is bromine or chlorine; and the preferred halide anions m the reaction medium are bromide anions or chloride anions.<br>
Step (i) of the process of this invention may be earned out in a stined reactor, bubble column or packed bed reactor, all operated m a batch or continuous mode with respect to the liquid reaction medium. In the continuous operation, the reaction medium may or may not be recycled in the reactor. For a stirred or bubble column reactor, the catalyst is in finely powdered form, whereas for a packed bed reactor, the catalyst may be in the form of granules of pellets. Step (1) may also be carried out using a trickle bed reactor known in the pnor art, with or without recycle of the liquid reaction medium. In the tnckle bed reactor, the solid catalyst is packed in the reactor and the liquid reaction medium is trickled over the catalyst, while gaseous reactant(s) are passed cocunently or counter-currently with respect to the liquid flow.<br>
In step (1) of the process of this invention, hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt and oxygen are reactants, which are dissolved in the reaction medium and the dissolved reactants react between themselves over the solid catalyst to produce hydrogen peroxide, nitrogen and water as the products. Both the by-product, nitrogen gas, and the side product, water, are environmentally benign. When hydrazine salt, N2H4.nX (where X - H20, H2SO4, HNO3, HCl, HBr, HI or CH3COOH; n - 0.5, 1 or 2; N is nitrogen, H is hydrogen, S is sulfur, CI is chlorine, Br is bromine and I is iodine) is a reactant, the acid part of hydrazine salt, X, is released, at least partly, in the reaction medium. The role of the solid catalyst is to activate both the hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt and oxygen for selective oxidation of hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt by oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The role of aqueous reaction medium<br>
is to dissolve both the reactants for the reaction to occur between the reactants over the catalyst. The role of mineral acid in the reaction medium is to reduce the decomposition of H2O2, which is formed in the reaction, to oxygen and water and also to reduce a reaction between H2O2 and N2H4 to water and N2, and thereby increasing the H2O2 selectivity or yield in the process of this invention.<br>
In the process of this invention, hydrazine salt can be prepared by reacting hydrazine hydrate with required amount of acid, such as HC1, H2SO4, HBr, H3PO4, HNO3 or the like at room or lower temperature and using directly the resulting mixture for the reaction in step (1). In the process of this invention, the presence of halide promoter either in the catalyst or in the reaction medium is essential for the formation of hydrogen peroxide from hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt by its oxidation. However, when the adduct X in N2H4.nX is an acid then the reaction medium may or may not contain a mineral acid. But, when the adduct X in N2H4.11X is H2O, then the presence of mineral acid in the reaction medium is essential.<br>
Step (11) of the process of this invention may be earned out by separating the solid catalyst from the reaction mixture by filtration or centnfugation and then separating the H2O2 from the liquid reaction mixture by filtration by distillation methods in the prior art.<br>
In the process of this invention, hydrazine hydrate or hydrate salt, which is toxic in nature, can be converted completely and hence no wastewater treatment for the destruction of hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt is necessary. Moreover, the unconverted hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt present in the reaction mixture undergoes reaction with hydrogen peroxide, formed in the process of this invention, leading to the destruction of the unreacted hydrazine or hydrazine salt, present in the reaction mixture, by converting it into water and nitrogen, which are environmentally benign.<br>
The main finding of this invention is that hydrogen peroxide with high selectivity and yield is produced in the liquid phase oxidation of hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt over a solid catalyst comprising palladium with or without halogen promoter in an aqueous reaction medium with or without comprising a mineral acid and/or halide anions, even at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. Other important finding of this invention is that the conversion of hydrazine hydrate or hydrogen salt in the process of this invention can be complete, 100%, and the byproducts or side products formed in this process of this invention are water and<br>
nitrogen, which are environmentally benign, and hence the process occurs m an environmentally clean manner. Another important finding of this invention is that the catalyst of this invention can be easily separated, simply by filtration or centnfugation from the reaction mixture, and more over it can be reused repeatedly in this process of this invention. Yet another important finding of this invention is that, no explosive gas mixture is formed in this process of this invention and hence the process of this invention does not involve any explosion hazard.<br>
The present invention is described with respect to the following examples illustrating the process of this invention for the production of hydrogen peroxide from hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt. These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

These examples illustrate the process of this invention for the production of hydrogen peroxide from hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt by its oxidation by oxygen, using a solid catalyst comprising palladium, with or without a halogen promoter, in an aqueous reaction medium with or without comprising acid or halide anions.<br>
The process of this invention was earned out in a magnetically stirred jacketed glass reactor of capacity 100 cm3 or 250 cm3, containing 50 cm3 or 150 cm3 aqueous reaction medium with or without comprising mineral acid or halide anions, to which a known quantity of hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt and a solid catalyst comprising palladium with or without halide promoter (s) were added, under vigorous stirring, while bubbling pure oxygen or air through the reaction medium, at the reaction conditions given in Table 1. The temperature of the reaction was controlled by passing continuously water from thermostatic bath through the jacketed reactor. After the reaction, the solid catalyst from the reaction mixture was separated by filtration and the filtrate was analyzed for its hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt contents. The hydrogen peroxide was analyzed by iodometric titration and the unconverted hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt was analyzed by potassium lodate titration. Both the titration methods are well known in the prior art.<br>

Novel important features and major advantages of the process of this invention over the prior art processes for the production of hydrogen peroxide are as follows:<br>
1.	The process of this invention involves a liquid phase oxidation of hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt by oxygen in an aqueous reaction medium for the production of hydrogen peroxide with upto 100% conversion of hydrazine hydrate salt to H2O2, water and N2.<br>
2.	In the process of this invention, the by products and side products formed are nitrogen and water, and hence, the process is environmentally benign.<br>
3.	In the process of this invention, selective oxidation by oxygen of hydrazine hydrate or hydrazine salt in an aqueous reaction medium over solid catalyst comprising palladium occurs only if an hahde promoter is present either in the reaction medium or in the catalyst itself; but for the selective oxidation of hydrazine hydrate to hydrogen peroxide, in addition to the presence of hahde promoter in the reaction medium or in the solid catalyst, the presence of a mineral acid in the reaction medium is also essential.<br>
4.	Unlike the presently practiced anthraquinone process for the production of hydrogen peroxide, the process of this invention involves only a single reaction step and produces no side product(s), which needs wastewater treatment.<br>
5.	Unlike the poor art processes based on the direct oxidation of hydrogen by oxygen for the production of hydrogen peroxide, the process of this invention is non-hazardous.<br>
6.	In the process of this invention, hydrazine salt can be oxidized selectivity to hydrogen peroxide even using pure water, as the reaction medium.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
