				<td>A NEW METHOD FOR PREPARING 4, 4 ' - (1-methyl-l,2-ethandiyl)-bis-(2,6-piperazinedione)<br>
This invention relates to a new method for preparing 4,4'-(1-methyl-l,2-ethandiyl)-bis-(2,6-piperazinedione). More specifically this invention relates to a new method for preparing 4,4'-(1-methyl-l,2-ethandiyl)-bis-(2,6-piperazinedione) in improved quality and yield. Moreover this invention relates to new intermediate compounds employed in this method.<br>
4,4'-(1-methyl-l,2-ethandiyl)-bis-(2,6-piperazinedione) has the general formula (I)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The compound of the formula (I) may be present in the form<br>
of two enantiomers as (S)-(+)-4,4'-(1-methyl-l,2-ethandiyl)-<br>
bis-(2,6-piperazinedione), also referred to as Dexrazoxan, and<br>
as	(R)-{-)-4,4•-(1-methyl-l,2-ethandiyl)-bis-(2,6-<br>
piperazinedione), also referred to as Levorazoxan, as well as in the form of a racemate, (S,R)-4,4'-(1-methyl-l,2-ethandiyl)-bis(2,6-piperazinedione), also referred to as Ra-zoxan. In conjunction with this invention a compound of the formula (I)" or „4,4'-(1-methyl-l,2-ethandiyl)-bis-(2,6-p-piperazinedione)", respectively, refers to the S-enantiomer, the R-enantiomer as well as to the racemate.<br>
Regardless of its stereochemistry the compound of the formula (I) has an antitumor effect. In the past, the S-enantiomer of the compound of the formula (I), Dexrazoxan, which is known to be effective against tumors and other forms of cancer and which is also useful as a synergist in combination with other anticancer agents, has achieved special relevance. Particularly with regard to sarcoma, lymphosarcoma and<br>
leukaemia, it has been found that Dexrazoxan shows an activity and is particularly effective when used in a regime together with Adriamycin.<br>
In the prior art several preparation methods for the compound of the formula (I) have been known for a long time. For example, in the US-patents No. 3.941.790 and No. 4.275.063, to Creighton, three methods for preparing bisdiketopiperazines, wherein the compounds of the formula (I) are also included, are described. In the first method, (S)-1,2-diaminopropane is reacted with chloroacetic acid to form (S)-l,2-diaminopropane-tetraacetic acid. Subsequently tetraacetic acid is reacted with formamide under nitrogen at an elevated temperature to the corresponding compound of the formula (I) . In the second method tetraacetic acid is prepared as previously described, transferred to the corresponding tetraacetic acid amide by reacting with ammonia and the latter subsequently cylizised to polyphosphorous acid or phenol by heating. This method is said to be particularly beneficial, when the tetraacetic acid tends to decarboxylate during heating. As a third method, reacting of a tetranitrile with sodium amide in formamide and the subsequent treating of the resulting product with hydrogen chloride in methanol are mentioned. According to Creighton this alternative method has the benefit to be a low-temperature technique. All these methods are stereoselective methods, i.e. therefore the employed intermediate compounds in the form of tetraacetic acid, tetraamide or tetranitrile should already be available in the stereochemical configuration desired for the compound of the formula (I) .<br>
The intermediate compounds employed in the aforementioned methods, such as tetraacetic acid, may be prepared in different ways. Beside the already aforementioned preparation methods, for example, in British Patent No. 978.724, J.R., to Geigy AG, a method for forming tetraacetic acid is described, wherein diamines are reacted with formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide to form a tetranitrile, which is saponified. In US-<br>
Patent No. 2.461.519, Bersworth et al., they teach a method for preparing 1,2-diaminopropane-tetracarboxylic acid by reacting 1,2-diaminopropane with formaldehyde and sodium cyanide at an alkaline pH-value.<br>
A main problem with the preparation of the compound of the formula (I) is generally the purification of the intermediate compounds, which is costly and difficult to achieve on a commercial scale. With numerous methods, for example, intermediate compounds, such as tetraacetic acid, are obtained together with high amounts of alkali metal salts as a by-product, which prior to cyclization to the compound of the formula (I) have to be separated.<br>
These problems of the aforementioned preparation methods are particularly based on the fact that the employed tetraacetic acid like the tetraamides, the tetranitriles and the compound of the formula (I) themselves are very polar hydrophilic substances and form salts with the strong bases, as being required in the preparation method. Consequently, this always results in difficulties in the required separation of the non-reacted precursor compounds and the resulting by-products.<br>
The problems arising with and through the purification of the precursor compound in known preparation methods are described in detail in International Patent Application No. 93/08172, to P.L. MacDonald. Thus, to solve these problems, a method for preparing the compound of the formula (I), to be precisely, Deraxozan, is suggested, wherein the latter shall be obtained in high yields without, prior to cyclization to Dexrazoxan, performing a purification of the intermediate tetraacetic acid compound. However, by this method Dexrazoxan is obtained together with higher amounts of salt-by-products, which results in difficulties in the production of salt-free Dexrazoxan.<br>
Beside methods for preparing compounds of the formula (I) or analoguous compounds thereof, wherein tetraacetic acid, tetraamide or tetranitrile are employed as a intermediate<br>
product, a method for preparing cis- and trans-cyclopropyl-bis-2,6-(piperazinedione), two compounds which are analoguous to the compound of the formula (I), is also described in the literature, which method processes via the corresponding tetraacetic acid methyl ester as a precursor compound. D.T. Witiak et al, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Bd. 20, Nr. 5, pp 630-635 (1977), and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 21, No. 12, pp 1194-1197 (1978), describe the cyclization of the corresponding tetraacetic acid methyl ester in the form of the hydrochloride with an excess of ammonia and sodium methox-ide in methanol for preparing the trans-compound. The yield of the desired trans-compound is poor and amounts to only 27% prior to purification. According to the authors, the application of this method for preparing the corresponding cis-compound was not successful: For the preparation of the cis-compound, the tetraacetic acid methyl ester is cyclizised with sodium hydride and formamide in DME. The yield of the trans-compound is quoted with 36-5%.<br>
Witiak et al. suggest tetraacetic acid methyl ester exclusively for the preparation of the aforementioned compounds. There is no evidence in it to employ tetraacetic acid methyl ester compounds as precursor compounds for the preparation of analoguous compounds. Rather, the problems in preparating cis-and trans-isomers of the desired compound suggest that the employment of such compounds as a precursor compound is not readily possible.<br>
It is the goal of the present invention, to provide a method for preparing the compound of the formula (I), which enables the preparation of this compound in good yield, also on a commercial scale and overcomes the problems of the technique-known methods.<br>
This aim is achieved through the method according to the invention, which comprises the step of cyclizating a 1,2-diaminopropane-N,N,N',N' -tetraacetic acid alkyl ester (hereinafter referred to as "tetraacetic acid alkyl ester') with am-<br>
monia in formamide, wherein "alkyl" herein preferably stands for {C1-C3)-alkyl, and comprises both "C3-alkyl" n-propyl, isopropyl, as well as cyclopropyl.<br>
The method according to the invention is based on the observation of the surprising characteristics of the alkyl esters of te-raacetic acid, such as a reduced polarity and hy-drophility compared to the known intermediate compounds, which is used to provide an improved method for preparing the compound of the formula (I). Moreover, due to the higher reactivity of these esters, the ring closure to the compound of the formula (I) may be achieved under simpler conditions with regard to both the number of required reaction steps and measures as well as the reaction conditions required therefore.<br>
Further advantages of the methods according to the invention are the application of ammonia and formamide, two common chemicals, wherein, in the method according to the invention, formamide is also employed as a solvent. Methanol, resulting during cyclization can be removed from the reaction mixture by simple distillation. Further details with respect to the method according to the invention and its preferred embodiment may also be learned from the following examples.<br>
The invention also relates to the tetraacetic acid alkyl esters employed in the method according to the invention, having the formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R stands for alkyl. Preferably R is a (C1-C3)-alkyl such as methyl, ethyl or propyl.<br>
The compounds of the formula (II), which are valuable precursor compounds for the compounds of the formula (I), are novel compounds except for the tetraacetic acid methyl ester, which is described by E. H. Herman et al. in Research Communications in Chemical Pathology and Pharmacology, Vol. 48, No. 1, pp 39-55 (1985) . The tetraacetic acid alkyl ester may be<br>
prepared using technique-known methods, also as described in the following examples.<br>
A preferred method in conjunction with an embodiment of the present invention for preparing the tetraacetic acid alkyl ester of the present invention comprises reacting a diamine of the formula (III)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a suitable salt thereof with chloroacetic acid and the Subsequent treatment with alkyl alcohol to form the tetraacetic acid alkyl esters of the formula (II):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R stands for alkyl, preferably {C1-C3)-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, or propyl.<br>
The thus obtained tetraacetic acid alkyl esters are subjected to a further cyclization step in the presence of ammonia and formamide in order to obtain the compound of the formula (I) .<br>
Prior to cyclization to the compound of the formula (I), the tetraacetic acid alkyl esters of the formula (II) may be subjected to a purification, if desired, for example by subjecting them to a distribution between a water immiscible solvent and water to separate the formed alkali metal salts. Particularly ethyl acetate and isopropyl acetate are used as water immiscible solvents.<br>
However, the tetraacetic acid alkyl esters of the formula (II) may be cylizised to the compound of the formula (I) also without prior purification. This variant of the method represents a particularly preferred embodiment of the method for preparing the compound of the formula (I).<br>
In the particular embodiment of the method according to the invention, higher yields of the compound of the formula (I) as compared to known methods and a sufficient purification<br>
of the compound of the formula (I) may be achieved as well. Additionally, further purification and isolation of the tetraacetic acid alkyl esters, which are employed as a precursor compound, is not required.<br>
In the method according to the invention, like in the preferred embodiment thereof, a possible breakdown of the compound of the formula (I) by hydrolysis in the course of the method is minimized. The separation of ionic materials (like the alkali metal salts) may be completely and easily performed by distribution of the tetraacetic acid alkyl esters of the formula (II) between a water immiscible solvent, such as ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, and water.<br>
The method according to the invention as well as the preferred embodiment thereof are stereoselective methods, i.e. the precursor compound must be available in the configuration desired for the compound of the formula (I).<br>
Further aspects of the present invention can be learned from the following examples, which are given for illustration purposes and not to limit the invention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that the details of the method, which are described in the following examples, may be modified within the scope of the present invention. For example, according to the method of the example 5, which has been described for the S-enantiomer, Dexrazoxan, the R-enantiomer, Levorazoxan, and the racemate may be prepared as well. Unless otherwise noted or may be concluded from the context, the percentages relate to weight.<br>

Preparation  of  (S)- (+)-l,2-diaminopropane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic<br>
acid isopropyl ester<br>
50 g of (S)-(-)-diaminopropane dihydrochloride and 192.8 g of chloroacetic acid in 321 ml of water are treated with 190.4 g sodium hydroxide in 34 3 ml of water and treated for 114 h at 45 °C. The water is evaporated and the resulting thick suspension is refluxed with a mixture of 90 ml concentrated sulphuric acid in 1500 ml of 2-propanol for 41 h. The reaction mixture is cooled down to ambient temperature and the acid is neutralized by adding 240 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate. The precipitate is filtered off, rewashed with 150 ml of 2-propanol, the filtrate is evaporated and the oily residue is suspended in 250 ml of toluene. Subsequent to sufficient extraction with 2 N hydrochloric acid, the aqueous phase is neutralized with solid sodium carbonate (approx. 75 g) and extracted with about 375 ml of toluene. The complete evaporation of the solvents provides 41 g of the isopropyl ester as a slight yellow oil. An analytical sample was obtained by repeating the extractive preparation and subsequent column chromatographic purification over silica gel.<br>

Preparation of (S)-(+)-4,4'-(l-methyl-l,2-ethandiyl)-bis-(2,6-<br>
piperazinedione) (Dexrazoxan) {I)<br>
5.1.	Preparation    of    (S)-l,2-diaminopropane-N-N,N,N', N'-<br>
tetraacetic acid-tetramethyl ester (II)<br>
10 kg of (S)- (-)-diaminopropane dihydrochloride and 38.5 kg of chloroacetic acid in 65 1 water are treated with 38 kg of sodium hydroxide in 69 1 water and treated for 70 to 100 h at 450C. The water is evaporated and the resulting thick suspension is digested with 80 1 of methanol, filtrated and the cake is washed with methanol. The filtrate is completely evaporated and the residue is taken up in 180 1 methanol, treated with 18 1 of concentrated sulfuric acid and refluxed for 6 h. The reaction mixture is cooled down to ambient temperature and the acid is neutralized by adding 20 to 25 kg of sodium hydrogen carbonate. The precipitate is filtered off, the filtrate is evaporated and the oily residue is dissolved in 50 ml of ethyl acetate. Subsequent to sufficient extraction with 2 N hydrochloric acid the aqueous phase is neutralized with solid sodium carbonate and extracted with about 100 1 of ethyl acetate. The complete evaporation of the solvents provides about 13,5 kg to 17,3 kg of the desired methyl ester which may be used in the next step without further purification.<br>
5.2.	Cyclization to (S)-(+)-4,4'-(l-methyl-l,2-ethandiyl)-bis-<br>
(2,6-piperazinedione) (Dexrazoxan) (I)<br>
4.7 kg of gaseous ammonia are added to a solution of 10 kg (S)-'(+)-l,2-diaminopropane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid methyl ester from the aforementioned example in 34 1 formamide and the reaction mixture is maintained at 40 to 50°C under a pressure of max. 5 bar for about 12 h. Thereafter, the reaction mixture is slowly heated to 150°C, obtained methanol is distilled off during heating and the reaction mixture is maintained at 140 to 150°C for 10 to 12 h. Then the solvent is distilled off, the oily residue is crystallized from methanol to yield 2.9 to 3.7 kg Dexrazoxan, which may be further purified by recrystallization from 1,4-dioxan.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
