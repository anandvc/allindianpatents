3.PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.	<br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of formula (1), their solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable salts having antifungal activity. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of said compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of compound of formula (1) wherein R = substituted<br><br>
Formula (1)<br>
alkyl or alkenyl or aryl or heteroaryl or 2-thienyl or 3-thienyl or halothienyl or haloalkyl or halophenyl or pyrrolyl and Ri and R2 are same or different and each denotes hydrogen or halogen or alkoxy, or its solvates or salts of such compounds having at least one salt forming group.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
5-Aceloxymethyl-3-aryl-2/£ 5//-furan-2-one based antifungal agents are known to exhibit anti-fungal activity against various strains of fungi. However, the occurrence of fungal infections in larger number and emergence of pathogens resistant to some of the antifungal drugs already existing in the market, makes it necessary for the development of broad spectrum antifungal agents which are effective against certain mycoses (such as aspergillosis) for which no effective treatment is available till to date.<br>
In the past decades, the frequency and types of life-threatening fungal infections have increased dramatically in immuno-compromised patients. Several factors have contributed to this rise such as the expansion of severely ill and or immuno-compromised patient populations with HIV infection, with chemotherapy induced neutropenia, and receiving immunosuppressive therapy; more invasive medical procedures, such as<br>
2<br><br>
extensive surgery and the use of prosthetic devices and vascular catheters; treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics or glucocorticosteroids; and peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.<br>
This problem of increased fungal infections is accentuated by the emergence of fungal strains which are resistant to currently used antifungal agents. Major opportunistic fungal pathogens include Candida albicans, Aspergillus, Fusurian spp. Other species of Candida such as C, krusei, C tropicalis, C.glabrata are major causative agents of candidiasis. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a leading cause of mortality in bone marrow transplant recipients. HIV-infected patients are particularly susceptible to mucosal candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis.<br>
Fluconazole is the preferred broad spectrum anti-fungal agent used in treatment of fungal infections. In recent times resistance of Candida albicans the most common cause of mucosal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients, after long-term suppressive therapy, to azoles, particularly fluconazole, is a cause of increasing concern. Resistance to fluconazole in other Candida species and in Cryptococcus neoformans has also been reported. Also, fluconazole appears to be less active against the two emerging Candida species, C. glabratta and C. krusei. Infection with Aspergillus, although not common, is frequently life-threatening and fluconazole has only moderate activity against this fungus.<br>
This has necessitated the need for new antifungal agents with broad spectrum of antifungal activity, which this invention seeks to provide.<br>
Prior Art of the Invention:<br>
J. Med. Chem. 44, 2701-2706, 2001 describes antifungal agents which covers generically compounds of formula (1) of the present invention wherein R = p-C^lU or CH3 or (CH3)3C, R1=H or CI and R2=H or Br or CI or OCH3<br>

Antifungal Activity Testing:<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are antifungal agents effective to a greater or lesser extent, and useful in treating fungal infections in animals and humans, especially those caused by Calibicans, Aspergillus and Fusarium.<br>
In vitro evaluation of antifungal activity can be performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration.<br>
Anti-fungal susceptibility testing of these anti-fungal compounds was done by conventional method using soyabean casein digest broth. Known anti-fungal agents like Fluconazole and amphotericin-B were used as positive control. End points were determined after 48 hours visually and by using Spectrophotometer wherever necessary. Different dilutions were tried and the set of experiments.<br>
Antifungal activity of these compounds also extends to Aspergillus and Fusarium. The activity seen in compounds of Formula 1 as against these strains suggests that it exhibits broad spectrum antifungal activity.<br>
