3.PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed.	<br><br>
Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of formula (1), their solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable salts having antifungal activity. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of said compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of compound of formula (1) wherein R = substituted<br><br>
Formula (1)<br>
alkyl or alkenyl or aryl or heteroaryl or 2-thienyl or 3-thienyl or halothienyl or haloalkyl or halophenyl or pyrrolyl and Ri and R2 are same or different and each denotes hydrogen or halogen or alkoxy, or its solvates or salts of such compounds having at least one salt forming group.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
5-Aceloxymethyl-3-aryl-2/Â£ 5//-furan-2-one based antifungal agents are known to exhibit anti-fungal activity against various strains of fungi. However, the occurrence of fungal infections in larger number and emergence of pathogens resistant to some of the antifungal drugs already existing in the market, makes it necessary for the development of broad spectrum antifungal agents which are effective against certain mycoses (such as aspergillosis) for which no effective treatment is available till to date.<br>
In the past decades, the frequency and types of life-threatening fungal infections have increased dramatically in immuno-compromised patients. Several factors have contributed to this rise such as the expansion of severely ill and or immuno-compromised patient populations with HIV infection, with chemotherapy induced neutropenia, and receiving immunosuppressive therapy; more invasive medical procedures, such as<br>
2<br><br>
extensive surgery and the use of prosthetic devices and vascular catheters; treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics or glucocorticosteroids; and peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.<br>
This problem of increased fungal infections is accentuated by the emergence of fungal strains which are resistant to currently used antifungal agents. Major opportunistic fungal pathogens include Candida albicans, Aspergillus, Fusurian spp. Other species of Candida such as C, krusei, C tropicalis, C.glabrata are major causative agents of candidiasis. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a leading cause of mortality in bone marrow transplant recipients. HIV-infected patients are particularly susceptible to mucosal candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis.<br>
Fluconazole is the preferred broad spectrum anti-fungal agent used in treatment of fungal infections. In recent times resistance of Candida albicans the most common cause of mucosal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients, after long-term suppressive therapy, to azoles, particularly fluconazole, is a cause of increasing concern. Resistance to fluconazole in other Candida species and in Cryptococcus neoformans has also been reported. Also, fluconazole appears to be less active against the two emerging Candida species, C. glabratta and C. krusei. Infection with Aspergillus, although not common, is frequently life-threatening and fluconazole has only moderate activity against this fungus.<br>
This has necessitated the need for new antifungal agents with broad spectrum of antifungal activity, which this invention seeks to provide.<br>
Prior Art of the Invention:<br>
J. Med. Chem. 44, 2701-2706, 2001 describes antifungal agents which covers generically compounds of formula (1) of the present invention wherein R = p-C^lU or CH3 or (CH3)3C, R1=H or CI and R2=H or Br or CI or OCH3<br>

The tablets may be coated or uncoated or may be SR tablets. SR tablets can be also formulated by known technique to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and, thereby, provide a sustained action over a longer period. Gastric film-coated or enteric film-coated tablets can be made with sugar, gelatin, hydroxypropylcellulose, nor acrylic resins. Tablets with a sustained action may also be obtained using an excipient which provides regressive osmosis, such as the galacturonic acid polymers.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard capsules of absorbable material, such as gelatin, wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent and lubricating agents, or pasty materials, such as ethoxylated saturated glycerides. Soft gelatin capsules are also possible wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oily medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for the preparation of a suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent; a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpirrolidone, gum tragacanath, xanthan gum, gum acacia, and one or more preservatives, such as methyl or n-propyl p-<br>

When all of the components are sterile, the injectables will maintain the sterility if they are manufactured in sterile environment.<br>
Preparations for vaginal administration according to the present invention include tablets, capsules, softgels, moulded pessaries, creams, foams and vaginal douches. Vaginal tablets provide the active component in admixture with microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, lactose, polyvidone and magnesium stearate as typical excipients. Soft gelatin capsules (softgels) can be made dispersing the active ingredient in an oily medium, for example liquid paraffin, dimethylpolysiloxane 1000 or hydrogenated soybean oil. Moulded pessaries provide the active ingredient in admixture with a suitable synthetic or semi synthetic base (such as SuppocireÂ® or NovataÂ® types). Low viscosity saturated C&amp; to C\2 fatty acid glycerides and colloidal silica are also added to improve incorporation and to prevent sedimentation of the active ingredient.<br>
Vaginal creams can be prepared as emulsions, with sufficient viscosity to retain their integrity and adhere to the vaginal cavity. Neutral fats, fatty acids, waxes, mineral oils and fatty acid esters can be used as the oily phase. Water, glycerine, sorbitol solution and polyethylene glycol are suitable excipients for the aqueous phase. Non-ionic emulsifying agents like polyethylene glycol ethers may also be used, and such compositions may also contain preserving, buffering and stiffening agents. Foaming systems can be made using a foamer (dispenser) that is able to transform a solution into a foam. Such systems may include co solvents, buffers, preservatives, foam stabilizers and perfumes in an aqueous vehicle. Vaginal douches may contain co solvents, preservatives, buffers and perfuming agents in a surfactant rich aqueous solution.<br>

The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature followed by quenching with ammonium chloride solution. The reaction mixture was diluted with 100 mL of ethyl acetate, washed with water (2 x 100 mL), 1 N HC1 solution (2 x 50 mL), water (2 x 100 mL), dried over Na2SCÂ«4 and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography to afford the hydroxy ester of formula (4) as a pale yellow pasty mass. Yield 50-60 %.<br>
Step 2: Preparation of the alcohol 5<br>
A solution of the hydroxy ester of formula (4) (6.96 mmole) and catalyst PTSA (para-toluene sulphonic acid (50 mg) in 20 mL of distilled MeOH was stirred at 40Â°C for 3 days. The reaction mixture was concentrated and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography to give the alcohol of the formula (5) as a white solid. Yield 30-50 %. The following compounds were prepared by the procedure described above for the alcohol of the formula (5):<br>

Antifungal Activity Testing:<br>
The compounds of Formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are antifungal agents effective to a greater or lesser extent, and useful in treating fungal infections in animals and humans, especially those caused by Calibicans, Aspergillus and Fusarium.<br>
In vitro evaluation of antifungal activity can be performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration.<br>
Anti-fungal susceptibility testing of these anti-fungal compounds was done by conventional method using soyabean casein digest broth. Known anti-fungal agents like Fluconazole and amphotericin-B were used as positive control. End points were determined after 48 hours visually and by using Spectrophotometer wherever necessary. Different dilutions were tried and the set of experiments.<br>
Antifungal activity of these compounds also extends to Aspergillus and Fusarium. The activity seen in compounds of Formula 1 as against these strains suggests that it exhibits broad spectrum antifungal activity.<br>
