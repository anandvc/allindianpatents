According   to   the   aforesaid   primary   characteristics,   wherein   a ring-shaped protruding piece 13 having an aperture 131  is provided between the large and small turning wheels 10 and 20,   The inner cord 521 is passed through the aperture 131 for forming the outer cord 522 that Is further winded in the large storage groove 15, and a detent portion of the inner and outer cords 521 and 522 is formed at the aperture 131,<br>
According to the aforesaid primary characteristics, wherein a bottom of the guiding orifice 44 provided at one side of the base 40 is disposed with a stop portion 431.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 8 and 9, a cord storage device for mouse further comprises the characteristics of; a mouse body 50 having a guiding orifice 58 at an rear end thereof and<br>
-5-<br><br>
an accommodating room 42 at an interior thereof;<br>
a large turning wheel 10 having a larger diameter and a small turning wheel 20 having a smaller diameter, and center openings 12 of the two turning wheels being flexibly connected to a single axis portion 30 that is further fixed and connected to wail surfaces of the accommodating room 42 of the mouse body 50;<br>
large and small storage grooves 15 and 25 formed on breadths of the large and small turning wheels 10 and 20, respectively, so as to have the cord 52 winded and stored into the large and small storage grooves 15 and 25; wherein the cord 52 stored in the large and small turning wheels 10 and 20 are distinguished as an inner cord 521 and an outer cord 522, respectively; and<br>
a spring 80 having an inner end 81 thereof (not shown in the diagram) connected to the axis portion 30 and an outer end 82 thereof (not shown in the diagram) connected to a waii surface of an inner groove 11 provided at one side of the large turning wheel 10 so that the outer cord 522 is guided to the exterior via the guiding orifice 58; wherein a conductive terminal 57 of the inner cord 521 is connected to a circuit board 54 and an outer terminal of the outer cord 522 is connected to a plug 55,<br>
-6-<br><br>
According to the aforesaid primary characteristics, wherein the large and small turning wheels 10 and 20 may have same diameters so as to form storage grooves 15' and 25' having equal diameters as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
According to the aforesaid primary characteristics, wherein a side wall of the base 40 is disposed with a USB connector port 49 as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
According  to  the  aforesaid  primary and  secondary characteristics, excellences of the invention shall be described in the following examples. EXAMPLES<br>
1. Referring to FIG. 5 and 6, the large and small turning wheels are both flexibly connected to the same axis portion 30, and hence the small turning wheel 20 also rotates one revolution when the large turning wheel 10 turns one revolution. For one revolution made by the large turning wheel 10, the outer cord 522 being released from (or winded into) the large storage wheel 15 equals to n x D, where D is the diameter of the large turning wheel 10; similarly, for one revolution made by the small turning wheel 20, the inner cord 521 released from (or winded into) the small storage groove 25 equals to n x d, where d is the diameter of the small turning wheel 20.   As a result, when the large and small turning<br>
-7-<br><br>
wheels 10 and 20 rotate using a same axis, the ratio of lengths of cord refeased (or winded) equals to the ratio of diameters of the large and small turning wheels 10 and 20; that is, D: d. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the ratio of diameters of the large and small turning wheels 10 and 20 is 6: 1. Suppose the outer cord 522 is released when the mouse body 50 is pulled out by a user, the inner cord 521 having an attached plug 55 is released along as well. Provided that the outer cord 522 being released is 50cm for the usage of the mouse body 50, the inner cord 521 released from the small storage groove 25 via the guiding orifice 44 is 8.3cm, so that the plug 55 connected to the cuter end of the in'ner cord 521 may be plugged to a power connector port of an electric appliance 90 as shown in FIGS. 10 and 11. Therefore, when the mouse body 50 is pulled out and displaced, excessive displacement between the plug 55 and the base 40 is not incurred. During cord winding, the spring 80 imposes a contraction effect on the large and small turning wheels 10 and 20, and thus the inner and outer cords 521 and 522 are winded back into the large and small storage grooves 15 and 25, Wherein, a rear end of the plug 55 is stopped at the stop portion 431 that provides a positioning effect when the plug 55 is being restored back into the base 40 as shown in FIGS.5 and 7.<br><br>
2.	Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, inner sides of arched edges 45 are<br>
provided with slanting flanges 451 for the mouse body 50 to fasten to a<br>
surface 401 in a downward direction,   A periphery 51 of the mouse body<br>
50 is butted against the flanges 451 such that the arched edges 45 are<br>
deformed  outwardly with  elasticity,  thereby  effectively  mounting  and<br>
positioning the mouse body 50 onto the surface 401 and combining the<br>
mouse body 50 with the base 40 into one body for easy storage and<br>
carrying.   To use the structure, onfy the mouse body 50 needs to be<br>
pulled out from the base 40 in an upward direction, then forces imposed<br>
by the flanges 451  are disappeared and the arched edges 45 are<br>
elastically repositioned.<br>
3.	Referring to FIG. 8 showing another embodiment according to the<br>
invention, the large and small turning wheels 10 and 20 are disposed in<br>
the accommodating room 42 located at the interior of the mouse body 50,<br>
and thus the independent base 40 may be eliminated in this embodiment<br>
When the outer cord 522 is released, the large and srnali turning wheels<br>
10 and 20 rotate coaxially regarding the axis portion 30 as a rotation axis<br>
thereof.    At this point, the ratio of the diameters of the large and small<br>
turning wheels 10 and 20 may be increased (10: 1, for example); the<br>
larger the ratio is, the shorter the length of the inner cord 521 released<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
becomes, and therefore the length of the inner cord 521 is extremely short. Also, the conductive terminal 57 of the inner cord 521 may be a fixed connector port, and the inner cord 521 is in a fax state in the small storage groove   25   during   cord   releasing   without   making   a   mess   in   the accommodating room 42 (as shown in FIG. 9).<br>
4. Referring to FIG. 7 the large and small turning wheels 10 and 20 may also be designed as having same diameters (1:1) for adapting to various operating environments or special requirements, and hence the lengths of the inner and outer cords 521 and 522 are equal to each other when being released. FIG. 10 shows a planar view illustrating the inner cord 42 in the base 40 being connected to a power socket of the electric appliance 90, Referring to FIG. 11, when the mouse body 50 according to the invention is pulled out, the length of the outer cord 522 drawn from the base 40 is comparatively large and the inner cord 521 drawn is extremely small. Referring to FIG, 4, the invention may also provide at least one USB connector port 49 at one side of the base 40 for plugging a USB plug 491 when necessary.<br>
It is of course to be understood that the embodiment described herein is merely iilustrative of the principles of the invention and that a wide variety of modifications thereto may be effected by persons skilled in the art<br>
