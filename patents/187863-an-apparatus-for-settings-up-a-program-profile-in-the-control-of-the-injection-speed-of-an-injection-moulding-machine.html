				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
1)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for setting-up a program profile in the control of the injection speed of injection molding machines and an apparatus therefor.<br>
2)	Related Art<br>
In injection molding machines, the control of the moving speed of the injecting plunger (screw) in a forward direction is usually conducted in accordance with a program profile, which is preliminarily set up in a computer.<br>
The profile is generally set up in the computer in such a manner that a filling stroke of the injection plunger is divided into a plurality of phrases, and the moving speed of the plunger in a forward direction is directly designated at every phrase of the stroke to obtain a multi-step rectangular-shaped profile.<br>
Fig. 1 is a graph showing the thus obtained conventional program profile in the control of the moving speed of the injection plunger. As shown in Fig. 1, in the conventional profile, the filling stroke of the injection plunger is divided into five phases, and the moving speed of the plunger V1 to V5 is directly designated at every phase of the stroke to obtain the multi-step rectangular-shaped profile.<br>
In this manner, according to the conventional technique for setting up a program profile in the control of an injection<br>
1A<br><br>
speed of injection molding machines, it is necessary to designate the moving speed of the plunger directly for every divided phase of the stroke of the plunger. However, in actual mold cavities, the cross-section of the course of the melt resin is suddenly changed, so that the conventional rectangular-shaped profile does not correspond to the actual movement of the melt resin as it flows through the mold cavity.<br>
Therefore, according to the conventional technique, in order to obtain a profile which corresponds to the actual shape of the course of the melted resin in the cavity, it is necessary to increase the number of the steps of the rectangular portions of the profile; accordingly, the number of the phase to be divided of the moving speed of the plunger should be increased.<br>
Further, it is required to set up the program profile so as to complete to fill up the molding cavity with melt resin within a period as shortest as possible without disturbing the flowing condition of the melt resin in the mold cavity. Therefore, the program profile should be set up, by which the moving speed of the plunger is changed so as to comply with the actual shape of the course of the melt resin in the mold cavity.<br>
Furthermore, in order to set up such a profile, the know-how on the basis of a molding principle is necessary to control the moving speed of the plunger when the melt resin starts to be injected into a cavity or when the filling up phase of the resin is finished.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1 by broken lines, the actual moving speed of the injection plunger in a forward direction has some delays from the profile on the leading and trailing edges<br>
2<br><br>
thereof when the moving speed is changed. As apparent from Fig. 1, the actual moving speed of the injection plunger does not change according to the multi-step rectangular-shaped profile set up in the computer.<br>
Therefore, the actual profile of the moving speed of the injection plunger (hereinafter referred to as "a prosecuting profile" ) does not correctly correspond to the program profile in the control of the injection speed (hereinafter referred to as "a set-up profile"), so that the prosecuting profile and the set-up profile are not the same when superimposed on each other when a closed loop control is conducted. In order to solve this drawback, a delay control is applied in which time constants are generated on the leading and trailing edges of the moving speed of the plunger. However, such delayed leading and trailing edges are not involved in the profile.<br>
From these reasons, when a closed loop control is conducted, the prosecution profile is deviated from the set-up profile even if the control is conditioned normally; such a deviation causes a difficulty in the control of the moving speed of the plunger.<br>
On the other hand, the another method for setting a program profile is suggested where the profile corresponds to the variation of the shape of the course of the melted resin in the mold cavity. According to the method, the profile is formed by broken lines being connected, however, it is difficult to set parameters unless the shape of the course of the melted resin in the mold cavity is well known, and it is required to have many points to be set up in order to obtain the profile which corre-<br>
3<br><br>
sponds to the shape of the flowing path of the melted resin. Therefore, according to the method, it would be difficult to realize an idea that the required profile can be obtained with a small amount of inputting data. Further, the know-how for setting the parameters is much more difficult than that for setting a multiple rectangular-shaped profile.<br>

In the profile setting portion 1, the filling stroke of the plunger and the dwelling stage switching position of the plunger are directly set up so as to be the inputted values; the initial speed period is set up by automatically computing it using the inputted values of the filling stroke of the plunger and the initial speed period ratio as parameters; the profile maximum speed is set up by automatically computing it using the inputted value of the profile maximum speed ratio as a parameter; further, the profile initial speed is set up by automatically<br>
17<br><br>
computing it using the inputted value of the initial speed ratio as a parameter.<br>
The thus computed values, i.e. the initial speed period, the initial speed and the profile maximum speed, are indicated on the display by real numbers. It should be noted that these set-up values can be adjusted with the aid of the Up buttons 29, 31 and 14 and the Down buttons 33, 35 and 16.<br>
When the operator touches to a complete button 43, all of the setting of the profile is completed. While, when a cancel button 45 is touched, the image surface is turn to an initial image of the data inputting mode or to an initial menu image.<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph showing an example of a program profile set up by the apparatus for setting up a program profile in the control of an injecting speed of injection molding machines according to the present invention. In this example, when the filling stroke L of the plunger and the dwelling stage switching position Pc of the plunger are inputted, the injection starting position Ps of the plunger is determined by the formula of Pc + L. When the filling stroke L of the plunger, the dwelling stage switching position Pc and the initial speed period ratio Rps (%) are inputted, the position PSe, at which the initial speed period of the plunger ends, is determined by the formula of Pc + {L -((Rps/100) L)}. Further, the maximum speed ratio (%) Rvn and the initial speed ratio (%) Rvs are inputted, the profile maximum speed Vmax can be obtained from the formula of (Rvm/100) Vm, and the initial speed Vs is determined from the formula of (Rvs/100) Vm, wherein the reference Vm represents the machine maximum speed.<br>
18<br><br>
When the functions for determining the characteristic of the leading edge of the initial speed and the characteristic of the leading edge of the maximum speed are designated, inclinations are given to the responding characteristics of the leading edge A of the initial speed and the leading edge B of the maximum speed, respectively, so that the position PSa, at which the moving speed of the plunger becomes to the given initial speed, and the position Pmax, at which the moving speed of the plunger becomes to the maximum speed, are automatically determined. Thereby, the program profile, as shown in Fig. 3, for controlling an injecting speed of injection molding machines is completed.<br>
It should be noted that it is possible to determine that the functions for the characteristics of the leading edges of the initial speed and the leading edge of the maximum speed can be arbitrarily set up by the user.<br>
In Fig. 4, a basic program profile is shown which is composed of a low speed period (the initial speed period), and a high speed period. During the initial speed period, melted resin is filled up in the spool and runner of a mold die; and during the high speed period the melt resin is filled up in the shape of the article mold cavity of the die. The injection speed in the high speed period is generally higher than that in the initial speed period. Some types of products can be molded according to such a program profile without any problem. However, when the injecting phase is changed from the material filling phase to the dwelling phase, the moving speed of the injection plunger in a forward direction should be generally reduced.<br>
19<br><br>
The reduction of the moving speed should be conducted generally, taking the shape of an article to be molded and the position of the gate of the mold die into consideration. However, the main purpose of the speed reduction is to absorb the inertia of the injecting plunger, which is moving to fill-up the material in the cavity, so that the switching movement of the plunger from the material filling phase to the dwelling phase is conducted in a stable manner. In this case, therefore, on the assumption of the ending speed Vf of the plunger, the moving speed of the plunger should be reduced from the profile maximum speed Vmax to the ending speed Vf with a predetermined speed reduction characteristic, so that the moving speed of the plunger becomes the ending speed Vf at the dwelling phase switching position of the plunger. In this case, the position Pmax e, where the maximum speed duration ends, ("the speed reduction starting position") is automatically determined by the functions for setting up the dwelling phase switching position Pc of the plunger, the ending speed Vf and the speed reduction characteristic of the plunger.<br>
In case that the ending speed Vf of the plunger and the speed reduction characteristic are preliminarily set up in a fixed manner, or default values therefor are provided, the profile thereof can be obtained only by inputting data for the same items as shown in Fig. 2. It should be noted that the ending speed Vf of the plunger can be set up by designating it by a real number or a ratio.<br>
In case it is required to designate the ending speed Vf of the plunger because of the complex shape of the article to be<br>
20<br><br>
molded, a window for indicating the ending speed and push buttons for setting a value thereof should be added to the image surface of the display. Further, it may be possible to arrange such that the speed reduction characteristics is set up by selecting one of the preliminarily set up functions or by setting it arbitrarily by the user.<br>
The profiles shown in Figs. 4 and 5 can be applied to mold almost all types of products. The proper program profile in the control of the injection speed can be easily and automatically be set up only by inputting the filling stroke L of the plunger, the dwelling phase switching position Pc of the plunger, the profile maximum speed ratio Rvm, the initial speed period ratio Rs, the initial speed ratio Rvs, or by selecting one of the preliminarily set-up values thereof without requiring any know-how.<br>
When the functions for determining the characteristics of the leading edge of the initial speed and the leading edge of the maximum speed are designated, respectively, inclinations are given to the responding speed characteristics of the leading edge A of the initial speed and the leading edge B of the maximum speed, respectively, in accordance with the thus designated functions, respectively. Therefore, a profile corresponding to the actual movement of the melt resin in the mold cavity can be obtained, and thus a closed loop control can be conducted in a suitable manner.<br>
In case the shape of the article to be molded is complex, or the course of the resin in the mold die is complex, i.e. in a multiple cavity mold or in a the multiple gate mold, it is re-<br>
21<br><br>
quired to set up the profile in much more detailed manner so as to comply with the complex shape of the article to be molded or the complex-shaped course of the resin. In such a case, the initial speed duration and the maximum speed period should be<br>
divided into a plurality of sub-periods so that the initial speed<br>
or the profile maximum speed of the plunger can be set up at every sub-period.<br>
In the setting of such an initial speed or such a maximum speed of the plunger in a divided manner, it is arranged that once the first value (a set-up value for the first sub-period of the initial speed or the maximum speed) is set up, the subsequent values on and after the second one are provisionally set up so as to be the same as the first set-up initial value; the set-up values on and after the second sub-period can be arbitrarily increased or decreased as occasion demands. Thereby, in the case that a detail setting is not required or a detail setting is necessary because of the complex variation of the course of the melt resin, etc., the profile can easily or automatically be set up without increasing the user"s action in operations.<br>
In the profile shown in Fig. 6, the initial speed period is divided into two sub-periods. During the sub-period Psa-Psb, the initial speed Vs is kept constant; and during the sub-period Psb and Pse, the moving speed of the plunger is accelerated, so that obtain the moving speed of the plunger Vs+ a can be obtained at the end position Pse of the initial speed period. Further, the high speed period is divided into four sub-periods; during the sub-periods Pmax a to P max b and Pmax b to P max c, the profile maximum speed Vmax of the plunger is kept constant; while<br>
22<br><br>
the moving speed of the plunger is reduced during the period Pmax c to Pmax d, so that the moving speed becomes Vmax- ß at an intermediate position Pmax d. Furthermore, during the sub-period Pmax d to P max e, the moving speed is accelerated again so that the moving speed becomes (Vmax ß ) + ? at the position Pmax e, at which the maximum speed period ends.<br>
In this case, the data Vs+ a , Vmax- ß , (Vmax-ß ) + ? should be additionally inputted into the profile setting means by a speed ratio or a real number.<br>
It may be possible to determine the intermediate position Psb, and Pmax b to Pmax d with the same distances in a fixed manner, or to determine them in a variable manner by the user. Further, it is also possible to arrange such that a characteristic line of the profile is displayed and then the characteristic line can be arbitrarily designated on the display.<br>
As explained above, the method and the apparatus for setting a program profile in the control of an injection speed of injection molding machines according to the present invention, a proper program profile in the control of an injection speed can be easily and automatically set up by only inputting the filling stroke of the plunger or an injection starting position of the plunger, a dwelling phase switching position of the injection plunger, a profile maximum speed or the profile maximum speed ratio, an initial speed or an initial speed ratio, an initial speed period ratio, or by selecting one of the preset values thereof.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, since the profile is set-up in such a manner that the moving speed of the<br>
23<br><br>
plunger is reduced from the maximum speed to the terminal speed with a given speed reduction characteristic so that the moving speed of the plunger becomes the given ending speed at the dwelling phase switching position, and therefore "burrs" are removed from the molded articles. Since the speed reduction characteristic can be set up by the preliminarily given speed reduction functions, therefore, the required speed reduction characteristic can be easily obtained.<br>
Furthermore, according to the method of the present invention, the moving speed of the plunger at the dwelling phase switching position (the ending speed of the plunger) can be directly inputted into the profile setting means via the data inputting means, a suitable speed reduction control for each article to be molded can easily be set up.<br>
According to the present invention, the values for the items, i.e. the profile maximum speed ratio, the initial speed ratio, and the initial speed period ratio, can be set up by selecting ones from the preset values. Therefore, the setting can be effected very easily.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, one of the preset values is set up as a default value, so that the forgetting of setting up the values may be prevented.<br>
Furthermore, according to the present invention, the value set up by selecting one from the preset values for each item can be changed with the aid of the data inputting means, so that a user can arbitrarily set up a desired value using his own experience.<br>
Moreover, according to the present invention, at least<br>
24<br><br>
one of the initial speed period and the maximum speed period is divided into a plurality of sub-periods, and the initial speed or the maximum speed can be set up at every divided sub period. Therefore, even if the course of the melted resin in the mold cavity is complex, the article can be molded without any problem. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, once the first value (the value of the first sub-period) is set up, the values on and after the second one are provisionally set up to the same as the first value. Therefore, even in the case that detail setting is not necessary, the method and apparatus can be applied to the molding machine. While, in the other preferred embodiment, it is arranged such that the values on and after the second one can be arbitrarily increased or decreased as occasion demands, so that the method and apparatus can also be used to mold complex-shaped articles.<br>
According to the present invention, the responding characteristics at least one of the leading edge of the initial speed and the leading edge of the maximum speed is (are) determined by a pre-set function(s). Therefore, a profile, which actually correspond to the movement of the melted resin in the mold cavity, can be obtained, and a closed loop control can be effected in a suitable manner.<br>
According to the present invention, the function(s) to determine the responding characteristic(s) of at least one of the initial speed and the leading edge of the maximum speed can be set up by selecting one from the preset functions by using the data inputting means. Therefore, the functions can be automatically set up in an easy manner.<br>
