"ELECTRICALLY DRIVEN VEHICLE"<br><br><br><br>
 HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiapyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
„• , The following specification particularly describes the nature of the ,,£*inventioh and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to an electrically driven vehicle.<br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an electrically driven vehicle, and particularly to an electrically driven vehicle having a fitting structure of heat-generating component parts such as a charger which<br><br><br><br><br><br>
enables good cooling while maintaining good appearance.  <br>
[0002]	  <br>
"   [Prior Art]<br>
As a power source for a driving motor of an electrically driven vehicle, there is used a secondary cell (battery) capable of being repeatedly utilized through recharging by a chemical reaction.  One example of a motor scooter type electrically driven vehicle on which<br><br><br><br><br><br>
^<br><br><br><br><br><br>
2<br><br><br><br>
a charger for charging the battery is mounted is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 5-112270. In the electrically driven vehicle, the charger is contained in a space provided at a lower rear portion of a seat, and, at the time of charging, a lid is opened, a cord disposed in the inside of the space is drawn out and is connected to a commercial power source, whereby passage of electric current can be achieved. [0003]<br>
Among such batteries, one provided with a cooling device is known. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 5-69870 discloses a motor scooter type vehicle in which a cooling wind is fed by a cooling fan to a battery device disposed under a step floor. [0004]<br>
In the above vehicle, the cooling fan is disposed on the upper side of a rear portion of the battery device, namely, on the front side of a rear wheel and on the lower side of a seat, and a cooling wind is fed from the cooling fan to the batteries through a duct. [0005] [Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Since the charger is a heat-generating body, cooling thereof must be taken into consideration.  In the<br>
3<br><br>
above conventional vehicle disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 5-12270, however, the charger is contained in a space for difficult contact with the outside air, so that there is a demand for disposing the charger in a position for easy contact with the outside air, such as a side portion of the vehicle body, from the viewpoint of cooling performance. In that case, there is also a merit that a storage space under the seat can be secured.  In addition, in order to further enhance cooling performance, it may be contemplated to provide the charger with cooling fins, but such an appearance that the cooling fins are conspicuous is not favorable. Therefore, there is a request for a fitting structure excellent in mounting property and good in both        <br><br>
appearance and cooling performance. [0006]<br>
Furthermore, in addition to the charger, a down converter which is a heat-generating component is mounted on the electrically driven vehicle, and there is a demand for enhancing the cooling performance of the down converter. [0007]<br>
In consideration of the above problems, it is a first object of the present invention to provide an<br><br>
4<br><br>
electrically, driven vehicle which has a fitting structure for a charger good in both appearance and cooling performance and excellent in mounting property and which can enhance the cooling performance of a down converter.<br>
[0008]<br>
[Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the above battery device disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 5-69870, the entire part of the battery device is cooled by only one cooling fan. Therefore, a large type cooling fan is required, and, particularly in a motor cycle, there is a case where it is difficult to secure a space for mounting a comparatively large type cooling fan.  In addition, where only one cooling fan is used, there is need for a contrivance for cooling uniformly the entire part of the batteries large in volume, or the cooling structure may be complicated. Therefore, an improvement in these points is desired.<br>
[0009]<br>
In consideration of the above problems, it is a second object of the present invention to provide an electrically driven vehicle by which it is easy to secure a space for mounting the cooling fan and an effect of cooling uniformly the entire part of the batteries can be<br><br>
5<br><br><br>
expected.<br>

Therefore, the cooling fans can be made smaller in size, so that the degree of freedom in laying out the cooling fans is enhanced. Particularly according to the tenth characteristic feature, the space at a lower portion on the front side of the seat can be utilized effectively, and the cooling fans can be disposed by utilizing the space under the seat while securing the volume of the battery unit up to a length nearly equal to the front-rear length of the floor. [0021]<br>
In addition, the twelfth feature of the present invention is characterized in that the cooling fans on the front-rear side are of the same type. According to the twelfth characteristic feature, a reduction in cost and facility of parts management can be contrived through common use of the component parts. [0022]<br>
Besides, the thirteenth feature of the present invention is characterized in that the battery device includes a battery frame for holding the battery unit,<br><br>
11<br><br>
and the battery frame is provided with connecting means for connecting the battery frame to a vehicle body frame made of a light alloy. According to the thirteenth characteristic feature, the heat generated at the batteries is transmitted through the battery frame and the connecting means to the vehicle body frame which is high in thermal conductivity, so that efficiency of cooling the battery unit is further enhanced.<br>
[0023]<br>

Heat generated in the down converter 44 is dissipated through the fins 443; in this case, particularly because the vehicle body frame having good thermal conductivity is in contact with the fins 443, the dissipation of the heat is further promoted.<br>
[0041]<br>
A support member 52 made of a high-strength material such as steel is provided astride a front portion of the down converter 44, and is fitted to the vehicle body frame 11 by bolts 53, 54. A plate 461 constituting the above-mentioned seat catch 46 is fixed to the support surface member 52.<br>
[0042]<br>
Thus, since the space formed at a rear portion of the vehicle body can be made most of as a storage space for the down converter 44, the down converter 44 can be provided with the cooling fins 443 which are broad in area. As a result, synergistically with the high heat-<br><br>
25<br><br>
dissipating effect of the vehicle body frame 11 made of a light metal, the down converter 44 can be air-cooled effectively. [0043]<br>
Fig. 11 is a side view of the battery device 35, Fig. 12 is an enlarged view of a major part of a side surface of the battery device 35, and Fig. 13 is a sectional view taken at position A-A of Fig. 11.  In these figures, the battery device 35 contains 1.2 volt Ni-MH batteries 351.  The batteries 351 are cylindrical in shape, and are contained in a metallic frame (battery frame) 352 in four high piles disposed in two rows and 15 rows in the vehicle width direction and the vehicle longitudinal direction. Namely, a total of 120 batteries 351 are contained, to constitute a battery unit capable of producing an output of 7 0 volts. [0044]<br>
Passages 353 by which cooling winds led in from the outside into the battery device 35 by the cooling fans 38 and 39 are distributed throughout the battery device 35 are formed between the batteries 351. On the other hand, the frame 352 is provided with wind exhaust ports 354 through which the cooling wind having recovered the heat from the batteries 351 by flowing through the passages<br><br>
26<br><br>
353 is discharged to the outside of the frame 352. The wind exhaust ports 354 are provided respectively at extension positions of the passages 353 between the batteries 351, but only a part thereof is shown in the drawings in order to avoid complicatedness of the drawings. [0045]<br>
Stays 355, 356 for fitting the battery device 35 to the lower frame 11L are provided respectively at a front portion and an intermediate upper portion of the frame 352.  The stay 355 at the front portion is fixed to the frame 352 by bolts 355a, 355b.  On the other hand, the stay 357 at the intermediate upper portion is fixed by bolts 356a, 356b to a cross plate 357 fixed to an upper portion of the frame 352, and is fixed to a side portion of the frame 352 by a bolt 356c. [0046]<br>
A boss portion 358 for passing therethrough the support shaft 35a for supporting the battery device 35 on the vehicle body frame 11 at a rather rear side position is provided at the tip end of a bracket 359 extending rearwardly upwards from a rear portion of the frame 352. [0047]<br>
In the above constitution, the cooling fans 38 and<br>
27<br><br>
39 take in air from the front side of the vehicle as indicated by arrows W, and the cooling winds are fed into the inside of the frame 352 directly from the front portion cooling fan 3 8 and through a duct 41 (which turns the wind direction) from the rear portion cooling fan 39. The cooling winds thus led in pass through the passages 353 between the batteries 351 to be fed to side portions of the frame 352, and are discharged to the outside through the wind exhaust ports 354.<br>
[0048]<br>
Thus, the cooling winds are fed from the front and rear sides of the battery device 35, and are distributed uniformly throughout the passages 353, so that heat is recovered uniformly from each of the batteries 351, and the temperature of the batteries 351 is maintained to be not more than a predetermined temperature. With the arrangement in which air is taken in from the front side of the vehicle by the cooling fans 38 and 39, a running wind can be effectively taken in during running, so that fan efficiency is enhanced. The cooling fans 38, 39 are preferably of the same type, since common use of the component parts is advantageous in view of a reduction in cost and management of the parts.<br>
[0049]<br><br>
                        28<br><br>
Fig. 14 is a plan view showing the condition where the battery device 35 is mounted on the vehicle body frame 11, and Fig. 15 is a rear view (view from the rear side of the vehicle body) of the same.  In both figures, the battery device 35 is disposed between the lower frames 11L which are roughly U-shaped in cross section of the vehicle body.  The stay 355 is fixed to top surfaces of the lower frames 11L by bolts 355c, and the stay 356 is fixed to the lower frames 11L by bolts 356d.  The batteries 351 are connected to the lower frames 11L of the vehicle body made of a metal (light metal such as an aluminum alloy) through the stays 355, 356, whereby the heat generated is transmitted efficiently to the lower frames 11L, and the battery device 35 can be cooled efficiently.<br>
[0050]<br>
Incidentally, by utilizing the U-shape of the lower frames 11L, cables 48, 49 such as a control cable and a power source cable are laid in the inside of U-shaped grooves 11LU. As shown in Fig. 5, the top surfaces of the battery device 35 and the lower frames 11L are covered by the step floor 27, and both side surfaces of the lower frames 11L are covered by the floor side covers 28.<br>
