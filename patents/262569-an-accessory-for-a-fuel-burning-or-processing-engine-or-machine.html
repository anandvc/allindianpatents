In order that the invention may be more readily understood, and so that further<br>
features thereof may be appreciated, the invention will now be described, by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
FIGURE 1 is an exploded view of some components of an accessory in<br>
accordance with the invention,<br>
FIGURE 2 is an exploded view of further components of an embodiment of<br>
the invention which are combined with the components of Figure 1,<br><br>
FIGURE 3 is a view of some of the components shown in Figure 2,<br>
viewed from a different perspective, for the purposes of explanation,<br>
FIGURES 4A, 4B and 4C are views of part of one of the components of<br>
Figure 3 in different configurations,<br>
FIGURE 5 is a view showing the components of Figures 1 and 2 when<br>
assembled, and<br>
FIGURE 6 is a view showing the accessory connected to a high tension<br>
cable.<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings, an<br>
accessory in accordance with the invention is provided with a lower housing<br>
element 1. The lower housing element 1 is of elongate form, and defines a<br>
base 2 which supports an upstanding front wall 3 carrying an inwardly directed<br>
lip 4 which extends inwardly over the base 2. The inward edge of the lip 4<br>
carries two spaced apart upwardly directed lugs 5, 6. At each end of the lip 4<br>
there is provided an axially extending projection 7, 8 and an adjacent upwardly<br>
extending abutment 9, 10.<br>
The base 2 also supports an upwardly directed rear wall 11, the rear<br>
wall 11, carrying, adjacent the upper edge thereof and at each end thereof, a<br>
forwardly directed vertical lug 12, 13. The lugs extend inwardly over the<br>
base 2.<br>
The lug 12 defines an aperture 13 and, at a position above the<br>
aperture 13, a projecting pip 14. The pip projects in a direction away from the<br>
rest of the lower housing element 1. The forwardly directed lug 13 defines an<br><br>
aperture 15 and, above the aperture 15, an outwardly directed pip 16 which is<br>
directed outwardly away from the rest of the lower housing element 1. It is to<br>
be appreciated, therefore, that the lower housing element 2 is in the form of a<br>
substantially channel-shaped element.<br>
At a first end of the lower housing element 1 is a housing end plate 20.<br>
The outer periphery of the end plate has a configuration equivalent to the<br>
configuration of the cross-section of the channel defined by the lower housing<br>
element 1. The end plate 20 is cojifigured to be abutted against the end of the<br>
lower housing element 1, and has an aperture 21 adapted to be aligned with the<br>
aperture 13 formed in the forwardly directed lug 2 and, at a position above the<br>
aperture 21, a further aperture 22 dimensioned to accommodate part of the<br>
pip 14.<br>
The part of the end plate 20 which lies adjacent the projection 7 and the<br>
abutment 10 is provided with an aperture 23 dimensioned to receive the<br>
projection 7, and a locking tab 24 adapted lockingly to engage with the<br>
abutment 9.<br>
The end piece 20 is provided with a further aperture 25 located at a<br>
position spaced beneath the aperture 21.<br>
At the other end of the lower housing element, a corresponding end<br>
plate 30 is provided having apertures 31, 32 and 35 corresponding to the<br>
apertures 21, 22 and 25 described above, and also having an aperture 33 and<br>
locking tab 34 corresponding to the aperture 23 and locking tab 24 described<br>
above. As can be seen in Figure 1, the outer-most end plate 30 is provided with<br>
a snap-action projection 35. The projection has an upper inclined or ramped<br><br>
face and a lower horizontal face. The end plate 20 is provided with a<br>
corresponding projection, but this is not visible in Figure 1.<br>
The lower housing element 1 and the end plates 20 and 30 are formed of<br>
a non-ferrous metal such as aluminium or some other non-ferrous material such<br>
as high temperature silicone rubber. The end plates are mounted on the lower<br>
housing element 1 to form the lower part of a complete housing.<br>
At one end of the housing, a groupings setter 40 is provided. The<br>
grouping setter 40 is in the form of a plate adapted to be located adjacent the<br>
end plate 20. The setter 40 defines an aperture 41 to be aligned with the<br>
aperture 22, and defines a protruding boss 42 adapted to receive within the<br>
aperture 22 and a further protruding boss 43 adapted to be received within the<br>
aperture 25.<br>
The groupings setter 40 is provided with a plurality of further<br>
apertures 45, which in this embodiment is shown as being of generally<br>
rectangular form, the apertures being dimensioned to receive ferrite bits 46<br>
which are each dimensioned to be received as a friction fit within an<br>
aperture 45.<br>
At the other end of the housing a corresponding groupings setter 50 is<br>
provided having similar features which will not be re-described at this stage.<br>
A connecting axle 60 is provided adapted to be received through the co-<br>
aligned apertures 51, 31, 15, 13, 21 and 41 to secure the above described<br>
elements together. As will become clear from the following description,<br>
additional components are mounted on the part of the axle 60 located between<br>
the lugs 12 and 16.<br><br>
Received within the lower housing element 1 is a core 70 formed of a<br>
magnetic material, presenting ferri-magnetic properties such as, for example, a<br>
ferrite material, that is to say a material presenting high resistivity and low<br>
reluctance. Ferrite is a ceramic ionoxide compound having ferromagnetic<br>
properties which has the general formula MOFe203where M is generally a metal<br>
such a cobalt nickel or zinc. Thus the ferrite may incorporate a bivalent or<br>
polyvalent metal. The ferrite is sintered to have a predetermined shape. The<br>
core 70, of the described embodiment, has a semi-annular cross-section. The<br>
exterior 7] of the core is dimensioned so that the core can be received within<br>
the lower housing element 1. The core defines two planar upper faces 72, 73.<br>
One planar face is adapted to be received beneath the inwardly directed lip 4<br>
and the other face 73 is intended to be located beneath the lower-most edge of<br>
the inwardly directed lugs 12 and 13. The central part of the core defines an<br>
axially extending channel 73 of semi-circular form, and this channel is<br>
dimensioned snugly to receive a high tension cable, such as a high tension<br>
cable extending to a spark plug of an internal combustion engine.<br>
Turning now to Figure 2, further elements of an accessory in accordance<br>
with the invention will now be described.<br>
Two further groupings setters 80, 81 are shown, each having a<br>
configuration identical to that of the grouping setters 40 and 50 as described<br>
above. These groupings setters are also adapted to receive ferrite inserts and<br>
are positioned to be located adjacent the inner faces of the inwardly directed<br>
lugs 12 and 13. Mounted between the groupings setters 80, 81 is a pivotally<br>
mounted plate 90. The plate 90 is an elongate plate having, at each end thereof,<br>
an upstanding cranked arm.91, 92, each of which defines an aperture 93, 94 to<br>
receive part of the axle 60. One edge of the plate 90 is provided with snap-off<br><br>
elements 95 in the form of castellations. These elements may be snapped off<br>
selectively. The plate is formed of a non-ferrous material, such as copper,<br>
copper alloy, aluminium or aluminium alloy.<br>
 A clamping spring 100 is provided comprising two helical coils 101, 102<br>
inter-connected by a radially outwardly directed bridging piece 103. The ends<br>
of the coils are provided with inwardly and axially directed fingers 104, 105.<br>
The spring 100 is adapted to receive the axle 60 through the co-aligned helical<br>
coils 101, 102. The radially directed bridging piece extending extension 103 is<br>
adapted to abut against part of the rear wall 11 of the lower housing element<br>
and the inwardly directed fingers 104 and 105 are adapted to engage the<br>
cranked arms 91 and 92 to impart a rotational bias to the pivotally mounted<br>
plate 90. As will be described hereinafter, the pivotally mounted plate serves to<br>
clampingly engage a high tension cable and retain the high tension cable within<br>
the channel 73 defined by the core 70, thus securing the core to the high tension<br>
cable.<br>
A cover 120 is provided, the cover being illustrated in Figure 2 and also<br>
in Figure 3. The cover comprises an upper plate 121 which has, at each edge<br>
thereof, a depending wall 122, 123. The wall 122 defines an aperture 124 to<br>
accommodate the axle 60 and the depending wall 123 defines an equivalent<br>
aperture 125. When the cover is mounted on the axle 60 it is pivotable relative<br>
to the rest of the housing between open and closed positions.<br>
The forward edge of the top plate 121 carries an inclined plate 126, the<br>
inclined plate having a slightly greater width than the upper plate 122. At each<br>
end of the inclined plate 126 there is a downwardly extending, slightly resilient<br>
snap-acting lug 127, 128. The snap-acting lug 127 defines an aperture 129, and<br>
the snap-acting lug 128 defines an aperture 130.<br><br>
As will become clear, from the following description, the cover, 120,<br>
may be moved to a closed position, with the snap-acting lugs 127 and 128<br>
moving such that the apertures 129 and 130 are brought into engagement with<br>
the snap-action abutments 25 and 35 provided on the end plates 20 and 30<br>
associated with the lower housing element 1.<br>
The under-side of the top plate 12) is provided with a plurality of<br>
spaced apart pegs 131 forming a regular array of pegs. The under-side of the<br>
inclined peg 126 is also provided with a corresponding plurality of evenly<br>
spaced pegs 133. Figure 4 shows the array of pegs 131, but the array of<br>
pegs 133 is identical.<br>
A plurality of balancing elements 134, 135, 136 are provided. The<br>
balancing elements are of different designs. As can be seen more clearly from<br>
Figures 4A, 4B and 4C each balancing element 134, 135, 136 is of generally<br>
elongate form having an aperture at each end thereof, the apertures of each<br>
element being spaced apart by a distance equal to the spacing between the two<br>
pegs, and having a diameter substantially equal to the diameter of a peg, the<br>
intermediate part of each element being so configured that the element may be<br>
snapped into position by aligning the apertures at each end of the element with<br>
two pegs, and pressing the element into place. Some examples of balance<br>
elements have been illustrated, but other designs of balancing element may be<br>
used. The balancing elements are formed of a material having a high magnetic<br>
permeability at low field strength and preferably a low hysteresis loss. A<br>
typical material that may be used is pemaloy. The cover, on the other hand, is<br>
formed of a non-ferrous metal such as aluminium, or some other non-ferrous<br>
material such as high temperature silicone rubber.<br><br>
Figure 5 illustrates the various components of Figures 1, 2 and 3 when<br>
assembled together, and showing a high tension cable 140 in position within<br>
the channel 73. The plate 90 is shown in an elevated position and is retained in<br>
that position against the biasing force applied thereto by the spring 100. When<br>
the plate is released, the plate will serve to clamp the high tension cable 140 in<br>
position within the core 70. The cover may then be moved to the closed<br>
position. The accessory will then have the condition illustrated in Figure 5.<br>
It has been found that when an accessory as described above is mounted<br>
on a high tension cable such as a high tension cable leads to the spark plugs of<br>
an internal combustion engine, improved engine efficiency is obtained.<br>
Whilst not wishing to be bound by the following explanation, it is<br>
believed that the core 70, which is made of a material exhibiting ferri-magnetic<br>
properties, such as a ferrite material, is located within a high energy electric<br>
field created when the successive pulses of electricity flow through the high<br>
tension cable, as the spark plug sparks. Subsequently a high energy<br>
electromagnetic field radiates from the core. This high energy field acts on the<br>
fuel.<br>
It is believed that hydrocarbon fuel presents a basic "cage-like" structure<br>
when viewed at the molecular level. Each molecule of hydrocarbon comprises<br>
a central "spine" formed of carbon atoms, which is shrouded with the hydrogen<br>
atoms carried by the carbon spine. Consequently it is believed that oxidation of<br>
the carbon is hindered by the molecular structure of the hydrocarbon<br>
molecules. Furthermore it is believed that hydrocarbon molecules bind into<br>
larger groups of molecules in the form of "pseudo compounds". Such groups<br>
associate to form clusters. This further inhibits the access of oxygen in the<br><br>
right quantity, to the interior of such groups of molecules. It is believed that<br>
the magnetic field energises the hydrocarbons, breaking up such associations.<br>
If the fuel is hydrogen, it is to be understood that an atom of hydrogen<br>
consists of one proton, carrying a positive charge and one electron carrying a<br>
negative charge, and therefore possesses a dipole moment. The atom can be<br>
either diamagnetic or paramagnetic (weaker or stronger response to the<br>
magnetic flux) depending upon the relative orientation of its spins. Thus, even<br>
though it is the simplest of all elements, it is believed to occur in two distinct<br>
isomeric varieties, characterised by the different opposite nuclear spins and<br>
termed "para" and "ortho". Thus, in a para-hydrogen molecule, which has two<br>
hydrogen atoms, the spin state of one atom relative to another is in the opposite<br>
direction, rendering it diamagnetic. On the other hand, in the ortho molecule,<br>
the spins are parallel, with the same orientation for the two atoms. Such a<br>
molecule is paramagnetic. It is believed that para-hydrogen can be converted to<br>
the higher energy ortho-hydrogen by magnetic stimulation, and thus it is<br>
believed that the magnetic field generated by the accessory of the invention<br>
converts at least a portion of the hydrogen fuel to the more highly energised<br>
ortho-hydrogen state.<br>
A similar effect is found if a hydro-carbon gas, such as methane or<br>
propane is utilised, in that the magnetic field serves to energise the molecules<br>
of gas.<br>
In the described embodiment, it is possible to effect various adjustments<br>
or calibrations to the described accessory. The adjustments or calibrations may<br>
be made on a trial or error basis, or may be predetermined depending upon<br>
certain characteristics or parameters of the engine in connection with which the<br>
accessoiy is to be used.<br><br>
A first stage of adjusting or calibrating the accessory may be by<br>
adjusting the pivotally mounted plate 90 which can be considered to be a<br>
balancing plate. Some of the snap-off projections or castellations 95 provided<br>
on the plate 90 may be broken away to improve the harnessing effect. A<br>
further adjustment may be made by selectively introducing the inserts 134 into<br>
the top cover 120. The inserts are positioned to achieve optimum harnessing of<br>
the scattering effect.<br>
The final adjustment that may be made is achieved by selectively<br>
inserting ferrite elements into the apertures provided for that purpose in the<br>
groupings setters 40, 50, 80 and 90.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to the use of the<br>
described accessory on the high tension lead leading to the spark plugs of an<br>
internal combustion engine it is to be appreciated that the accessory may be<br>
used with other types of engine or machine which bum or process hydrogen-<br>
containing fuel, such as hydrogen or a hydrocarbon. For example the accessory<br>
may be used with a diesel engine. If the accessory is to be used with a diesel<br>
engine a high tension lead carrying a varying electric current needs to be<br>
provided on which the accessory is to be mounted. Also an accessory as<br>
described may be used with other engines or machines which bum or process<br>
hydrogen-containing fuel such as, for example, a turbine or any other fuel<br>
burning engine, such as an engine used in a power plant, or any other machine<br>
which bums or processes hydrogen compounds.<br>

ABSTRACT	<br><br><br>
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO AN ACCESSORY FOR A FUEL BURNING OR<br>
PROCESSING ENGINE OR MACHINE<br>
An accessory for a fuel burning or processing engine includes a<br>
housing having a lower housing element with a pivotally mounted cover,<br>
so that the housing may be snap-fitted to a high tension lead, such as<br>
the lead extending to a spark plug in an internal combustion engine. A<br>
core of semi-circular section; formed of a material having ferri-<br>
magnetic properties is present within the housing, the core defining a<br>
recess which receives the high tension lead. As the cover of the<br>
housing is closed, the high tension lead is clamped and retained in<br>
place in the recess. The ferri-magnetic core has high resistivity and<br>
low reluctance, and is preferably formed of ferrite.</td>
