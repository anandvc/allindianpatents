				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING QUINOLINECARBOXYALDEKYDE DERIVATIVE<br>
AND INTERMEDIATE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing a quinolinecarboxyaldehyde derivative<br>
particularly useful as an intermediate of cholesterol<br>
lowering agents (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors).<br>
Particularly, it relates to a process for producing 2-<br>
cyclopropyl-4-(4'-fluorophenyl)quincline-3-<br>
carboxylaldehyde.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a process for producing a<br>
quinolinecarboxyaldehyde derivative, JP-A-1-279866, EP-A-<br>
304063 and U.S.P. 5011930 disclose a process which<br>
comprises reacting 2-amino-4'-fiucrcbenzophenone with<br>
ethyl isobutyrylacetate to obtain a quinolinecarboxylate<br>
derivative, once reducing it with diisobutylaluminum<br>
hydride to obtain a quinolinemethancl derivative, and<br>
further oxidizing it with pyridiniuiT. chiorochrornate to<br>
obtain an aimed quinolinecarboxyaldehyde derivative.<br>
However, this production process comprises a large number<br>
of steps and is not advantageous as an industrial<br>
production process.<br>
The present invention is to provide a process which<br>
makes it possible to produce 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4'-<br>
fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carboxyaldehyde of the following<br><br>
formula by an industrially advantageous simple process<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention resides in a process for<br>
producing 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4'-fluorcphenyl)quinoline-3-<br>
carboxyaldehyde, which comprises reacting 3-cyclopropyl-<br>
3-oxopropanenitrile with 2-amino-4'-f luorobenzophenone to<br>
obtain 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4'-fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-<br>
carbonitrile, and reducing it, preferably in the presence<br>
of an acid. In the production process, it is preferred<br>
to employ an organic sulfonic acid as the acid.<br>
The present invention further resides in a process<br>
for producing 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4'-fluorophenyl)quinoline-<br>
3-carboxyaldehyde, which comprises reducing 2-<br>
cyclopropyl-4-(4'-fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carbonitrile.<br>
The above 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4'-<br>
fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carbonitrile is a novel<br>
substance, and it may be obtained, for example, by<br>
employing a process of reacting S-cyclopropyl-B-<br>
oxopropaneriitrile with 2-amino-4'-f luorobenzophenone,<br>
preferably in the presence of an acid.<br>
The process for producing 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4'-<br><br>
fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carboxyaldehyde of the present<br>
invention proceeds in accordance with the following<br>
reaction path.<br><br>
(X) : Cyclization, (Y) : Reduction<br>
Now, each reaction employed in the above reaction<br>
path will be explained below.<br>
(A) Cyclization reaction step<br>
The cyclization reaction step of the present<br>
invention is a step of reacting 3-cyclopropyl-3-<br>
oxopropanenitrile of the formula (1) with 2-amino-4'-<br>
fluoroberizophenone of the formula (2) preferably in the<br>
presence of an acid to obtain a quinolinecarbonitrile<br>
derivative [2-cyclopropyl-4-(4'-fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-<br>
carbonitrile] of the formula (3).<br>
Examples of the acid preferably employed in the<br>
above cyclization reaction step include organic sulfonic<br>
acids such as methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid,<br>
benzenesulfonic acid, p-bromobenzenesulfonic acid and p-<br>
toluenesulfonic acid; inorganic acids such as phosphoric<br>
acid, pyrophosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid, sulfuric<br>
acid and hydrochloric acid; and halogenated organic<br><br>
carboxylic acids such as monochloroacetic acid,<br>
dichloroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid. An organic<br>
sulfonic acid is particularly preferred.<br>
The amount of the acid used in the cyclization<br>
reaction step is preferably from 0.1 to 5.0 mol, more<br>
preferably frcm 0.5 to 4.0 mol, particularly preferably<br>
from 1.0 to 3.0 mol, per 1 mol of 2-amino-4'-<br>
fluorobenzophenone.<br>
The amount of 3-cyclopropyl-3-oxopropanenitrile used<br>
is preferably from 0.8 to 2.0 mol, more preferably from<br>
1.0 to 1.5 mol, per 1 mol of 2-amino-4'-<br>
fluorobenzophenone.<br>
The cyclization reaction step of the present<br>
invention is carried out in the presence or absence of a<br>
solvent. When a solvent is employed, the type of the<br>
solvent is not particularly limited so long as it does<br>
not inhibit the reaction. Examples of the solA^ent which<br>
may be used include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
pentane, hexane, heptane, 2-methylbutane, 2-methylpentane,<br>
2-methylhexane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane and<br>
cycloheptane; halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
methylene chloride, chloroform and dichloroethane;<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene<br>
and mesitylene; halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene; ethers such as<br>
diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, alcohols<br>
such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, 2-butyl<br><br>
alcohol and t-butyl alcohol; and organic carboxylic acids<br>
such as acetic acid and propionic acid.<br>
The amount of the solvent used is preferably from 2<br>
to 5 0 parts by mass, more preferably from 3 to 10 parts<br>
by mass, per 1 part by mass of 2-amino-4'-<br>
fluorobenzophenone. These solvents may be used alone or<br>
in combination as a mixture of at least two.<br>
The cyclization reaction step of the present-<br>
invention is preferably carried out by contacting 2-<br>
amino-4'-fluorobenzophenone with 3-cyclopropyl-3-<br>
oxopropanenitrile in a liquid phase preferably in the<br>
presence of an acid. For example, is is carried out by<br>
e.g. a method of mixing an acid, 3-cyciopropyl-3-<br>
oxopropanenitrile, 2-amino-4'-fluorobenzophenone and a<br>
solvent, followed by stirring under heating in an<br>
atmosphere of nitrogen, under normal pressure, under<br>
pressure or under reduced pressure. In such a case, the<br>
reaction temperature is preferably from 50 to 160°C, more<br>
preferably from 10 to 140°C. Further, the cyclization<br>
reaction may be carried out while removing water formed<br>
during the reaction, as the case requires. 2-Amino-4'-<br>
fluorobenzophenone may be introduced to the reaction<br>
system in such a state that it forms a salt with the<br>
above acid (for example, it may be introduced as 2-amino-<br>
4'-fluorobenzophenone methanesulfonate).<br>
The quinolinecarbonicrile derivative [2-cyclopropyl-<br>
4-(4'-fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carbonitrilel of the above<br><br>
formula (3) obtained by the above cyclization reaction<br>
step is a novel compound, and may be taken out by a<br>
common separation/purification method by e.g.<br>
distillation, recrystallization or column chromatography<br>
after completion of the reaction for example.<br>
(B) Reduction reaction step<br>
The reduction reaction step employed in the present<br>
invention is a step of reducing the quinolinecarbonitrile<br>
derivative of the formula (3) to obtain a<br>
quinolinecarboxyaldehyde derivative of the formula (4).<br>
The above reduction reaction step is carried out by<br>
employing a common reduction method which converts a<br>
cyano group into a forrnyl group. For example, reduction<br>
with an aluminum hydride compound (such as<br>
diisobutylaluminum hydride), reduction with hydrogen,<br>
formic acid or ammonium formate in the presence of Raney<br>
nickel, reduction with stannous chloride, or reduction<br>
with hydrogen in the presence of palladium, may be<br>
employed. Preferably, reduction with diisobutylaluminum<br>
hydride (hereinafter referred to as reduction reaction<br>
(a)), reduction with formic acid in the presence of Raney<br>
nickel (hereinafter referred to as reduction reaction<br>
(b)) or reduction with hydrogen in the presence of Raney<br>
nickel (hereinafter referred to as reduction reaction<br>
(c)) is employed.<br>
(1) Reduction reaction (a): Reduction with<br>
diisobutylaluminum hydride<br><br>
The amount of diisobutylaluminum hydride used in the<br>
reduction reaction (a) is preferably from 0.5 to 5.0 mol,<br>
more preferably from 0.9 to 1.5 moi, per 1 mol of the<br>
quinolinecarbonitrile derivative.<br>
The reduction reaction (a) is carried out in the<br>
presence or absence of a solvent. The solvent used is<br>
not particularly limited so long as it does not inhibit<br>
the reaction, and examples of which include aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene; and<br>
ethers such as diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and<br>
dioxane. Preferably an aromatic hydrocarbon, more<br>
preferably toluene is employed.<br>
The amount of the solvent used is preferably from 2<br>
to 50 parts by mass, more preferably from 3 to 20 parts<br>

combination as a mixture of at least two.<br>
The reduction reaction (a) is carried out preferably<br>
by contacting diisobutylaluminum hydride with the<br>
quinolinecarbonitrile derivative in a liquid phase. For<br>
example, it is carried out by e.g. a method of mixing<br>
diisobutylaluminum hydride, the quinolinecarbonitriie<br>
derivative and a solvent preferably under cooling and<br>
reacting them in an atmosphere of an inert gas, under<br>
normal pressure or under pressure. In such a case, the<br>
reaction temperature is preferably from -50 to 60°C, more<br>
preferably from -2 0 tc 40°C.<br><br>
(2) Reduction reaction (b): Reduction with formic acid<br>
in the presence of Raney nickel<br>
The Raney nickel employed in the reduction reaction<br>
(b) is an alloy containing nickel and aluminum as the<br>
main components, and one having a nickel content of<br>
preferably from 10 to 90 mass%, more preferably from 40<br>
to 8 0 mass%, is employed. Usually expanded Raney nickel<br>
is employed, but Raney nickel subjected to a pretreatment<br>
by various methods or stabilized Raney nickel may also be<br>
employed. Further, one containing a metal such as cobalt,<br>
iron, lead, chromium, titanium, molybdenum, vanadium,<br>
manganese, tin or tungsten in Raney nickel may also be<br>
employed.<br>
The amount of the Raney nickel used is preferably<br>
from 0.3 0 to 2 parts by mass, more preferably from 0.3 0<br>
to 1.2 parts by mass, as calculated as nickel atoms, per<br>
1 part by mass of the quinolinecarbonitrile derivative.<br>
The formic acid employed in the reduction reaction<br>
(b) may be used as formic acid alone, however, preferably<br>
the reaction is carried out in the presence of formic<br>
acid and water in an amount of from 0.25 to 1 part by<br>
volume per 1 part by volume of formic acid.<br>
The amount of formic acid used is preferably from<br>
0.2 5 to 5 0 parts by mass, more preferably from i to 4 0<br>
parts by mass, per 1 part by mass of the<br>
quinolinecarbonitrile derivative.<br>
The reduction reaction (b) may be carried out in the<br><br>
presence of a solvent other than formic acid and water.<br>
The solvent which may be employed is not particularly<br>
limited so long as it does not inhibit the reaction, and<br>
examples of which include amides such as N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol and t-butyl alcohol; aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as pentane and cyclohexane; aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene; and organic<br>
carboxylic acids such as acetic acid and propionic acid.<br>
The amount of the solvent used is preferably from 0<br>
to 60 parts by mass, more preferably from 0 to 10 parts<br>
by mass, per 1 part by mass of the quinolinecarbonitrile<br>
derivative. These solvents may be used alone or in<br>
combination as a mixture of at least two.<br>
The reduction reaction (b) is carried out preferably<br>
by contacting formic acid and water with the<br>
quinolinecarbonitrile derivative in a liquid phase in the<br>
presence of Raney nickel. For example?, it is carried out<br>
by e.g. a method of mixing Raney nickel, the<br>
quinolinecarbonitrile derivative, formic acid and water,<br>
followed by stirring under heating in an atmosphere of an<br>
inert gas, under normal pressure or under pressure. In<br>
such a case, the reaction temperature is preferably from<br>
2 0 to 110°C, more preferably from 3 0 to 8 0°C.<br>
Further, as the case requires, e.g. an inorganic<br>
base, an organic base, a platinum salt, a lead salt or a<br>
cadmium salt may be added to the reaction system to<br><br>
adjust the reactivity [Teruo Kubomatsu, Shinichiro<br>
Komatsu, "Raney catalyst" (published, by Kawaken Fine<br>
Chemicals Co., Ltd.), p. 123-147, HU 45958].<br>
The quinolinecarboxyaldehyde derivative as a final<br>
product is separated and purified by a common method such<br>
as distillation, recrystallization or column<br>
chromatography after completion of the reaction for<br>
example.<br>
(3) Reduction reaction (c): Reduction with hydrogen in<br>
the presence of Raney nickel<br>
The Raney nickel employed in the reduction reaction<br>
(c) is an alloy containing nickel and aluminum as the<br>
main components, and one having a nickel content of<br>
preferably from 10 to 90 mass%, more preferably from 40<br>
to 8 0 mass%, is employed. Usually expanded Raney nickel<br>
is employed, but Raney nickel subjected to a pretreatment<br>
by various methods or stabilized Raney nickel may also be<br>
employed. Further, one containing a metal such as cobalt,<br>
iron, lead, chromium, titanium, molybdenum, vanadium,<br>
manganese, tin or tungsten in Raney nickel may also be<br>
employed.<br>
The amount of the Raney nickel used is preferably<br>
from 0.001 to 2 parts by mass, more preferably from 0.01<br>
to 1.2 parts by mass, as calculated as nickel atoms, per<br>
1 part by mass of the quinolinecarbonitrile derivative.<br>
The reduction reaction (c) is carried out preferably<br>
in the presence of an acid, and sulfuric acid,<br><br>
methanesulfonic acid, acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid<br>
may, for example, be employed. The amount used is<br>
preferably from 1 to 10 mol, more preferably from 1.5 to<br>
5 mol, per 1 mol of the quinolinecarbonitrile derivative.<br>
The reduction reaction (c) is carried out in a<br>
solvent. The solvent used is not particularly limited so<br>
long as it does not inhibit the reaction, and examples of<br>
which include water; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol and t-butyl alcohol; amides such as<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
pentane and cyclohexane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
toluene and xylene; carboxylic acids such as formic acid,<br>
acetic acid and propionic acid; and ethers such as<br>
diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane.<br>
The amount of the above solvent used is preferably<br>
from 1 to 50 parts by mass, more preferably from 2 to 20<br>
parts by mass, per 1 part by mass of the<br>
quinolinecarbonitrile derivative. These solvents may be<br>
used alone or in combination as a mixture of at least two.<br>
The reduction reaction (c) is preferably carried out<br>
by contacting hydrogen with the quinolinecarbonitrile<br>
derivative in a liquid phase in the presence of Raney<br>
nickel. For example, it is carried out by e.g. a method<br>
of mixing Raney nickel, the quinolinecarbonitrile<br>
derivative; and a solvent, followed by stirring with<br>
heating, in an atmosphere of hydrogen (which may be<br>
diluted with an inert gas), under a pressure of from 0.1<br><br>
to 5 MPa, as closed or while circulating hydrogen. In<br>
such a case, the reaction temperature is preferably from<br>
10 to 100ºC, more preferably from 20 to 70°C.<br>
As the case requires, e.g. an inorganic base, an<br>
organic base, a platinum salt, a lead salt or a cadmium<br>
salt may be added to the reaction system to adjust the<br>
reactivity [Teruo Kubomatsu, Shinichiro Komatsu, "Raney<br>
catalyst" (published by Kawaken Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd.),<br>
p. 123-147, HU 45958] .<br>
The quinolinecarboxyaldehyde derivative as a final<br>
product is separated and purified by a common method such<br>
as distillation, recrystallization or column<br>
chromatography after completion of the reaction for<br>
example.<br>
Now, the present invention will be explained in<br>
further detail with reference to Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Into a glass flask having an internal volume of 200<br>
mL, equipped with a stirring apparatus, a thermometer, a<br>
reflux condenser and a Dean-Stark apparatus, 8 0 ml, of<br>
toluene and 2 0 mL of cyclohexane were put in an<br>
atmosphere of nitrogen, and 2.94 g (30.6 mmol) of<br>
methanesulfonic acid, 3.50 g (32.1 mmol) of 3-<br>
cyclopropyl-3-oxopropanenitrile and 6.59 g (30.6 mmol) of<br>
2-amino-4'-fluorobenzophenone were added thereto with<br>
stirring. Then, the temperature was raised, and reaction<br>
was carried out at a temperature of from 9 0 to 9 5°C for 4<br><br>
hours while distilling off the formed water. After<br>
completion of the reaction, the reaction liquid was<br>
cooled to room temperature, and 100 mL of water and 5.5<br>
mL (44.0 mmol) of 8 mol/L sodium hydroxide aqueous<br>
solution were added to make the reaction liquid basic.<br>
The obtained reaction liquid was extracted with 200 mL of<br>
ethyl acetate twice, then the organic layer was separated,<br>
and 2 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, 2 g of silica gel<br>
and 2 g of activated carbon were added, followed by<br>
stirring at room temperature for 1 hour. After<br>
filtration, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced<br>
pressure to obtain 8.45 g of 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4'-<br>
fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carbonitrile as a pale yellow<br>
solid with a purity of 99% (area percentage by high<br>
performance liquid chromatography) (yield: 95%).<br>
Physical properties of the obtained 2-cyclopropyl-4-<br>
(4'-fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carbonitrile were as<br>
follows:<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Into a glass flask having an internal volume of 10<br>
mL, equipped with a stirring apparatus, a thermometer, a<br>
reflux condenser and a Dean-Stark apparatus, 5 mL of<br>
diisopropyl ether was put in an atmosphere of nitrogen,<br>
and 0.82 g (4.6 mmol) of pyrophosphoric acid, 0.2 9 g (2.5<br>
mmol) of 3-cyclopropyl-3-oxopropanenitrile and 0.50 g<br>
(2.3 mmol) of 2-amino-4'-fluorobenzophenone were added<br>
thereto with stirring at room temperature. Then, the<br>
temperature was raised to 70ºC, and reaction was carried<br>
out for 3 hours. After completion of the reaction, the<br>
reaction liquid was cooled to room temperature, and<br>
analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography<br>
(absolute quantitative analysis), whereupon 0.60 g<br>
(yield: 91%) of 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4'-<br>
fluorophenyl)quinoline-3-carbonicrile was formed.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The reaction was carried out in the same manner as<br>
in Example 2 except that the solvent was changed to<br>
dichloroethane, and the reaction temperature and the<br>
