CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/985,227 filed on 11/3/2007, which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] This disclosure relates generally to control systems for electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0004] Known powertrain architectures include torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output member. One exemplary<br>
powertrain includes a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from<br>
a prime mover power source, preferably an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member. The output member can be operatively connected to a<br>
driveline for a motor vehicle for transmitting tractive torque thereto. Electric<br>
machines, operative as motors or generators, generate a torque input to the<br><br><br>
transmission, independently of a torque input from the internal combustion<br>
engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy that is storable in<br>
an electrical energy storage device. A control system monitors various inputs<br>
from the vehicle and the operator and provides operational control of the<br>
powertrain, including controlling transmission operating state and gear<br>
shifting, controlling the torque-generative devices, and regulating the electrical<br>
power interchange among the electrical energy storage device and the electric<br>
machines to manage outputs of the transmission, including torque and<br>
rotational speed.<br>

dimensional search engine selects points defined by numerical pairs for<br>
evaluation, the space including at least one two-dimensional first region, the<br>
first region having minimum and maximum abscissa and ordinate values<br>
associated with it, includes generating a plurality of contour plots, the contour<br>
plots having abscissa and ordinate axes, and including contours which are<br>
representative of a property associated with points within the first region<br>
bounded by the abscissa and ordinate axes, selecting a second region from<br>
each of the contour plots, the second regions each comprising minimum and<br>
maximum abscissa values and minimum and maximum ordinate values,<br>
providing four tables of data, the data in each table of the four tables including<br>
one of four variables selected from the group consisting of: the minimum<br>
abscissa value, the maximum abscissa value, the minimum ordinate value, and<br><br><br>
the maximum ordinate value, providing a two-dimensional input request,<br>
extracting a value for each of the minimum abscissa value, the maximum<br>
abscissa value, the minimum ordinate value, and the maximum ordinate value<br>
from the tables, to provide extracted values based upon the input request;, and<br>
defining a search space based on the extracted values.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0014] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, FIG. 1 shows an exemplary electro-mechanical<br>
hybrid powertrain. The exemplary electro-mechanical hybrid powertrain<br>
shown in FIG. 1 comprises a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
hybrid transmission 10 operatively connected to an engine 14, and first and<br>
second electric machines ('MG-A') 56 and ('MG-B') 72. The engine 14 and<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72 each generate power which can<br>
be transmitted to the transmission 10. The power generated by the engine 14<br>
and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 and transmitted to the<br>
transmission 10 is described in terms of input torques, referred to herein as Ti,<br>
TA, and TB respectively, and speed, referred to herein as Ni, NA, and NB,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0015] In one embodiment, the exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-<br>
cylinder internal combustion engine which is selectively operative in several<br>
states to transmit torque to the transmission 10 via an input shaft 12, and can<br>
be either a spark-ignition or a compression-ignition engine. The engine 14<br>
includes a crankshaft (not shown) operatively coupled to the input shaft 12 of<br>
the transmission 10. A rotational speed sensor 11 is preferably present to<br>
monitor rotational speed of the input shaft 12. Power output from the engine<br>
14, comprising rotational speed and output torque, can differ from the input<br><br><br>
speed, N1, and the input torque, T1, to the transmission 10 due to torque-<br>
consuming components being present on or in operative mechanical contact<br>
with the input shaft 12 between the engine 14 and the transmission 10, e.g., a<br>
hydraulic pump (not shown) and/or a torque management device (not shown).<br>
[0016] In one embodiment the exemplary transmission 10 comprises three<br>
planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28, and four selectively-engageable torque-<br>
transmitting devices, i.e., clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. As used<br>
herein, clutches refer to any type of friction torque transfer device including<br>
single or compound plate clutches or packs, band clutches, and brakes, for<br>
example. A hydraulic control circuit 42, preferably controlled by a<br>
transmission control module (hereafter TCM') 17, is operative to control<br>
clutch states. In one embodiment, clutches C2 62 and C4 75 preferably<br>
comprise hydraulically-applied rotating friction clutches. In one embodiment,<br>
clutches C1 70 and C3 73 preferably comprise hydraulically-controlled<br>
stationary devices that can be selectively grounded to a transmission case 68.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 is preferably hydraulically applied, selectively receiving pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid via the hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0017] In one embodiment, the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
preferably comprise three-phase AC machines, each including a stator (not<br>
shown) and a rotor (not shown), and respective resolvers 80 and 82. The<br>
motor stator for each machine is grounded to an outer portion of the<br>
transmission case 68, and includes a stator core with electrical windings<br>
extending therefrom. The rotor for the first electric machine 56 is supported<br>
on a hub plate gear that is operatively attached to shaft 60 via the second<br><br><br>
planetary gear set 26. The rotor for the second electric machine 72 is fixedly<br>
attached to a sleeve shaft hub 66.<br>
[0018] Each of the resolvers 80 and 82 preferably comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator (not shown) and a resolver rotor<br>
(not shown). The resolvers 80 and 82 are appropriately positioned and<br>
assembled on respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72. Stators of respective ones of the resolvers 80 and 82 are operatively<br>
connected to one of the stators for the first and second electric machines 56<br>
and 72. The resolver rotors are operatively connected to the rotor for the<br>
corresponding first and second electric machines 56 and 72. Each of the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 is signally and operatively connected to a transmission<br>
power inverter control module (hereafter 'TPIM') 19, and each senses and<br>
monitors rotational position of the resolver rotor relative to the resolver stator,<br>
thus monitoring rotational position of respective ones of first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. Additionally, the signals output from the<br>
resolvers 80 and 82 are interpreted to provide the rotational speeds for first<br>
and second electric machines 56 and 72, i.e., NA and NB, respectively.<br>
[0019] The transmission 10 includes an output member 64, e.g. a shaft,<br>
which is operably connected to a driveline 90 for a vehicle (not shown), to<br>
provide output power, e.g., to vehicle wheels 93, one of which is shown in<br>
FIG. 1. The output power is characterized in terms of an output rotational<br>
speed, NO and an output torque, TO. A transmission output speed sensor 84<br>
monitors rotational speed and rotational direction of the output member 64.<br>
Each of the vehicle wheels 93, is preferably equipped with a sensor 94 adapted<br>
to monitor wheel speed, the output of which is monitored by a control module<br><br><br>
of a distributed control module system described with respect to FIG. 2, to<br>
determine vehicle speed, and absolute and relative wheel speeds for braking<br>
control, traction control, and vehicle acceleration management.<br>
[0020] The input torques from the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 (T1, TA, and TB respectively) are generated as a result of<br>
energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an electrical<br>
energy storage device (hereafter 'ESD') 74. ESD 74 is high voltage DC-<br>
coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The transfer<br>
conductors 27 include a contactor switch 38. When the contactor switch 38 is<br>
closed, under normal operation, electric current can flow between the ESD 74<br>
and the TPIM 19. When the contactor switch 38 is opened electric current<br>
flow between the ESD 74 and the TPIM 19 is interrupted. The TPIM 19<br>
transmits electrical power to and from the first electric machine 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical power to and<br>
from the second electric machine 72 by transfer conductors 31, in response to<br>
torque commands for the first and second electric machines 56 and 72 to<br>
achieve the input torques TA and TB. Electrical current is transmitted to and<br>
from the ESD 74 in accordance with commands provided to the TPIM which<br>
derive from such factors as including operator torque requests, current<br>
operating conditions and states, and such commands determine whether the<br>
ESD 74 is being charged, discharged or is in stasis at any given instant.<br>
[0021] The TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters (not shown) and<br>
respective motor control modules (not shown) configured to receive the torque<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality to achieve the input torques TA and TB. The power<br><br><br>
inverters comprise known complementary three-phase power electronics<br>
devices, and each includes a plurality of insulated gate bipolar transistors (not<br>
shown) for converting DC power from the ESD 74 to AC power for powering<br>
respective ones of the first and second electric machines 56 and 72, by<br>
switching at high frequencies. The insulated gate bipolar transistors form a<br>
switch mode power supply configured to receive control commands. There is<br>
typically one pair of insulated gate bipolar transistors for each phase of each of<br>
the three-phase electric machines. States of the insulated gate bipolar<br>
transistors are controlled to provide motor drive mechanical power generation<br>
or electric power regeneration functionality. The three-phase inverters receive<br>
or supply DC electric power via DC transfer conductors 27 and transform it to<br>
or from three-phase AC power, which is conducted to or from the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72 for operation as motors or generators via<br>
transfer conductors 29 and 31, depending on commands received which are<br>
typically based on factors which include current operating state and operator<br>
torque demand.<br>
[0022] FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of the distributed control module<br>
system. The elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall<br>
vehicle control architecture, and provide coordinated system control of the<br>
exemplary hybrid powertrain described in FIG. 1. The distributed control<br>
module system synthesizes pertinent information and inputs, and executes<br>
algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control objectives, including<br>
objectives related to fuel economy, emissions, performance, drivability, and<br>
protection of hardware, including batteries of ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72. The distributed control module system includes<br><br><br>
an engine control module (hereafter 'ECM') 23, the TCM 17, a battery pack<br>
control module (hereafter 'BPCM') 21, and the TPIM 19. A hybrid control<br>
module (hereafter 'HCP') 5 provides supervisory control and coordination of<br>
the ECM 23, the TCM 17, the BPCM 21, and the TPIM 19. A user interface<br>
('UP) 13 is operatively connected to a plurality of devices through which a<br>
vehicle operator may selectively control or direct operation of the electro-<br>
mechanical hybrid powertrain. The devices present in UI 13 typically include<br>
an accelerator pedal 113 ('AP') from which an operator torque request is<br>
determined, an operator brake pedal 112 ('BP'), a transmission gear selector<br>
114 ('PRNDL'), and a vehicle speed cruise control (not shown). The<br>
transmission gear selector 114 may have a discrete number of operator-<br>
selectable positions, including the rotational direction of the output member 64<br>
to enable one of a forward and a reverse direction.<br>
[0023] The aforementioned control modules communicate with other control<br>
modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network (hereafter 'LAN') bus<br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of states of operating<br>
parameters and actuator command signals between the various control<br>
modules. The specific communication protocol utilized is application-specific.<br>
The LAN bus 6 and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging and<br>
multi-control module interfacing between the aforementioned control<br>
modules, and other control modules providing functionality such as antilock<br>
braking, traction control, and vehicle stability. Multiple communications<br>
buses may be used to improve communications speed and provide some level<br>
of signal redundancy and integrity. Communication between individual<br><br>
control modules can also be effected using a direct link, e.g., a serial<br>
peripheral interface ('SPF) bus (not shown).<br>
[0024] The HCP 5 provides supervisory control of the powertrain, serving to<br>
coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19, and BPCM 21.<br>
Based upon various input signals from the user interface 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the ESD 74, the HCP 5 generates various commands,<br>
including: the operator torque request (To REQ'), a commanded output torque<br>
('TCMD') to the driveline 90, an engine input torque command, clutch torques<br>
for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the torque commands for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively. The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42 and provides various functions including<br>
monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not shown) and generating and<br>
communicating control signals to various solenoids (not shown) thereby<br>
controlling pressure switches and control valves contained within the<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42.<br>
[0025] The ECM 23 is operatively connected to the engine 14, and functions<br>
to acquire data from sensors and control actuators of the engine 14 over a<br>
plurality of discrete lines, shown for simplicity as an aggregate bi-directional<br>
interface cable 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine input torque command<br>
from the HCP 5. The ECM 23 determines the actual engine input torque, T|,<br>
provided to the transmission 10 at that point in time based upon monitored<br>
engine speed and load, which is communicated to the HCP 5. The ECM 23<br>
monitors input from the rotational speed sensor 11 to determine the engine<br>
input speed to the input shaft 12, which translates to the transmission input<br><br><br>
speed, N1. The ECM 23 monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to<br>
determine states of other engine operating parameters which may include<br>
without limitation: a manifold pressure, engine coolant temperature, throttle<br>
position, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. The engine load can<br>
be determined, for example, from the manifold pressure, or alternatively, from<br>
monitoring operator input to the accelerator pedal 113. The ECM 23<br>
generates and communicates command signals to control engine actuators,<br>
which may include without limitation actuators such as: fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules, none of which are shown.<br>
[0026] The TCM 17 is operatively connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
monitors inputs from sensors (not shown) to determine states of transmission<br>
operating parameters. The TCM 17 generates and communicates command<br>
signals to control the transmission 10, including controlling the hydraulic<br>
circuit 42. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include estimated clutch<br>
torques for each of the clutches, i.e., C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, and<br>
rotational output speed, NO, of the output member 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM 17 to the<br>
HCP 5 for control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure<br>
switches (not shown) and selectively actuates pressure control solenoids (not<br>
shown) and shift solenoids (not shown) of the hydraulic circuit 42 to<br>
selectively actuate the various clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75 to<br>
achieve various transmission operating range states, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0027] The BPCM 21 is signally connected to sensors (not shown) to<br>
monitor the ESD 74, including states of electrical current and voltage<br>
parameters, to provide information indicative of parametric states of the<br><br><br>
batteries of the ESD 74 to the HCP 5. The parametric states of the batteries<br>
preferably include battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, battery temperature,<br>
and available battery power, referred to as a range PBAT_MIN to PBAT MAX.<br>
[0028] Each of the control modules ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19 and BPCM<br>
21 is preferably a general-purpose digital computer comprising a<br>
microprocessor or central processing unit, storage mediums comprising read<br>
only memory ('ROM'), random access memory ('RAM'), electrically<br>
programmable read only memory ('EPROM'), a high speed clock, analog to<br>
digital ('A/D') and digital to analog ('D/A') circuitry, and input/output<br>
circuitry and devices ('I/O') and appropriate signal conditioning and buffer<br>
circuitry. Each of the control modules has a set of control algorithms,<br>
comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in one of the<br>
storage mediums and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the control modules is preferably<br>
accomplished using the LAN bus 6 and serial peripheral interface buses. The<br>
control algorithms are executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the actuators, using preset<br>
calibrations. Loop cycles are preferably executed at regular intervals, for<br>
example at each 3.125, 6.25,12.5,25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing<br>
operation of the powertrain. However, any interval between about 2<br>
milliseconds and about 300 milliseconds may be selected. Alternatively,<br><br>
algorithms may be executed in response to the occurrence of any selected<br>
event.<br>
[0029] The exemplary powertrain shown in reference to FIG. 1 is capable of<br>
selectively operating in any of several operating range states that can be<br>
described in terms of an engine state comprising one of an engine on state<br>
('ON') and an engine off state ('OFF'), and a transmission state comprising a<br>
plurality of fixed gears and continuously variable operating modes, described<br>
with reference to Table 1, below.<br><br>
[0030] Each of the transmission operating range states is described in the<br>
table and indicates which of the specific clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4<br>
75 are applied for each of the operating range states. As an example, a first<br>
continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode 1, or Ml, is selected by applying<br>
clutch C1 70 only in order to "ground" the outer gear member of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of ON ('Ml_Eng_On') or<br>
OFF ('Ml_Eng_Off). A second continuously variable mode, i.e., EVT Mode<br><br>
2, or M2, is selected by applying clutch C2 62 only to connect the shaft 60 to<br>
the carrier of the third planetary gear set 28. The engine state can be one of<br>
ON ('M2_Eng_On') or OFF ('M2_Eng_Off). For purposes of this<br>
description, when the engine state is OFF, the engine input speed is equal to<br>
zero revolutions per minute ('RPM'), i.e., the engine crankshaft is not rotating.<br>
A fixed gear operation provides a fixed ratio operation of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission 10, i.e., N1/NO, is achieved. For example, a first<br>
fixed gear operation ('Gl') is selected by applying clutches C1 70 and C4 75.<br>
A second fixed gear operation ('G2') is selected by applying clutches C1 70<br>
and C2 62. A third fixed gear operation ('G3') is selected by applying<br>
clutches C2 62 and C4 75. A fourth fixed gear operation ('G4') is selected by<br>
applying clutches C2 62 and C3 73. The fixed ratio operation of input-to-<br>
output speed increases with increased fixed gear operation due to decreased<br>
gear ratios in the planetary gears 24,26, and 28. The rotational speeds of the<br>
first and second electric machines 56 and 72, NA and NB respectively, are<br>
dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism as defined by the clutching<br>
and are proportional to the input speed measured at the input shaft 12.<br>
[0031] In response to operator input via the accelerator pedal 113 and brake<br>
pedal 112 as captured by the user interface 13, the HCP 5 and one or more of<br>
the other control modules determine torque commands to control the torque<br>
generative devices comprising the engine 14 and the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 to meet the operator torque request at the output member<br>
64 and transferred to the driveline 90. Based upon input signals from the user<br>
interface 13 and the hybrid powertrain including the ESD 74, the HCP 5<br>
determines the operator torque request, a commanded output torque from the<br><br><br>
transmission 10 to the driveline 90, the input torque from the engine 14, clutch<br>
torques for the torque-transfer clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, C4 75 of the<br>
transmission 10; and the motor torques for the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, respectively, as is described hereinbelow.<br>
[0032] Final vehicle acceleration can be affected by other factors including,<br>
e.g., road load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The engine state and the<br>
transmission operating range state are determined based upon operating<br>
characteristics of the hybrid powertrain. This includes the operator torque<br>
request communicated through the accelerator pedal 113 and brake pedal 112<br>
to the user interface 13 as previously described. The transmission operating<br>
range state and the engine state may be predicated on a hybrid powertrain<br>
torque demand caused by a command to operate the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 in an electrical energy generating mode or in a torque<br>
generating mode. The transmission operating range state and the engine state<br>
can be determined by an optimization algorithm or routine which determines<br>
optimum system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, battery<br>
state of charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and the first and<br>
second electric machines 56 and 72. The control system manages torque<br>
inputs from the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine, and system<br>
efficiencies are optimized thereby, to manage fuel economy and battery<br>
charging. Furthermore, operation can be determined based upon a fault in a<br>
component or system. The HCP 5 monitors the torque-generative devices, and<br>
determines the power output from the transmission 10 at output member 64<br>
that is required to meet the operator torque request while meeting other<br><br><br>
powertrain operating demands, e.g., charging the ESD 74. As should be<br>
apparent from the description above, the ESD 74 and the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively coupled for power<br>
flow therebetween. Furthermore, the engine 14, the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, and the electro-mechanical transmission 10 are<br>
mechanically-operatively coupled to transfer power therebetween to generate a<br>
power flow to the output member 64.<br>
[0033] FIG. 3 shows a control system architecture for controlling and<br>
managing signal flow in a hybrid powertrain system having multiple torque<br>
generative devices, described hereinbelow with reference to the hybrid<br>
powertrain system of FIGS. 1 and 2, and residing in the aforementioned<br>
control modules in the form of executable algorithms and calibrations. The<br>
control system architecture is applicable to alternative hybrid powertrain<br>
systems having multiple torque generative devices, including, e.g., a hybrid<br>
powertrain system having an engine and a single electric machine, a hybrid<br>
powertrain system having an engine and multiple electric machines.<br>
Alternatively, the hybrid powertrain system can utilize non-electric torque-<br>
generative machines and energy storage systems, e.g., hydraulic-mechanical<br>
hybrid transmissions (not shown).<br>
[0034] In operation, the operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the<br>
brake pedal 112 are monitored to determine the operator torque request. The<br>
operator inputs to the accelerator pedal 113 and the brake pedal 112 comprise<br>
individually determinable operator torque request inputs including an<br>
immediate accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque Request Accel<br>
Immed'), a predicted accelerator output torque request ('Output Torque<br><br><br>
Request Accel Prdtd'), an immediate brake output torque request ('Output<br>
Torque Request Brake Immed'), a predicted brake output torque request<br>
('Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd') and an axle torque response type<br>
('Axle Torque Response Type'). As used herein, the term 'accelerator' refers<br>
to an operator request for forward propulsion preferably resulting in increasing<br>
vehicle speed over the present vehicle speed, when the operator selected<br>
position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the<br>
vehicle in the forward direction. The terms 'deceleration' and 'brake' refer to<br>
an operator request preferably resulting in decreasing vehicle speed from the<br>
present vehicle speed. The immediate accelerator output torque request, the<br>
predicted accelerator output torque request, the immediate brake output torque<br>
request, the predicted brake output torque request, and the axle torque<br>
response type are individual inputs to the control system. Additionally,<br>
operation of the engine 14 and the transmission 10 are monitored to determine<br>
the input speed ('Ni') and the output speed ('No'). The immediate accelerator<br>
output torque request is determined based upon a presently occurring operator<br>
input to the accelerator pedal 113, and comprises a request to generate an<br>
immediate output torque at the output member 64 preferably to accelerate the<br>
vehicle. The predicted accelerator output torque request is determined based<br>
upon the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 and comprises an<br>
optimum or preferred output torque at the output member 64. The predicted<br>
accelerator output torque request is preferably equal to the immediate<br>
accelerator output torque request during normal operating conditions, e.g.,<br>
when any one of antilock braking, traction control, or vehicle stability is not<br>
being commanded. When any one of antilock braking, traction control or<br><br><br>
vehicle stability is being commanded the predicted accelerator output torque<br>
request remains the preferred output torque with the immediate accelerator<br>
output torque request being decreased in response to output torque commands<br>
related to the antilock braking, traction control, or vehicle stability control.<br>
[0035] The immediate brake output torque request is determined based upon<br>
a presently occurring operator input to the brake pedal 112, and comprises a<br>
request to generate an immediate output torque at the output member 64 to<br>
effect a reactive torque with the driveline 90 which preferably decelerates the<br>
vehicle. The predicted brake output torque request comprises an optimum or<br>
preferred brake output torque at the output member 64 in response to an<br>
operator input to the brake pedal 112 subject to a maximum brake output<br>
torque generated at the output member 64 allowable regardless of the operator<br>
input to the brake pedal 112. In one embodiment the maximum brake output<br>
torque generated at the output member 64 is limited to -0.2g. The predicted<br>
brake output torque request can be phased out to zero when vehicle speed<br>
approaches zero regardless of the operator input to the brake pedal 112. When<br>
commanded by the operator, there can be operating conditions under which<br>
the predicted brake output torque request is set to zero, e.g., when the operator<br>
setting to the transmission gear selector 114 is set to a reverse gear, and when<br>
a transfer case (not shown) is set to a four-wheel drive low range.<br>
[0036] A strategic control scheme ('Strategic Control') 310 determines a<br>
preferred input speed ('Ni_Des') and a preferred engine state and transmission<br>
operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') based upon the output speed<br>
and the operator torque request and based upon other operating parameters of<br>
the hybrid powertrain, including battery power limits and response limits of<br><br><br>
the engine 14, the transmission 10, and the first and second electric machines<br>
56 and 72. The predicted accelerator output torque request and the predicted<br>
brake output torque request are input to the strategic control scheme 310. The<br>
strategic control scheme 310 is preferably executed by the HCP 5 during each<br>
100 ms loop cycle and each 25 ms loop cycle. The desired operating range<br>
state for the transmission 10 and the desired input speed from the engine 14 to<br>
the transmission 10 are inputs to the shift execution and engine start/stop<br>
control scheme 320.<br>
[0037] The shift execution and engine start/stop control scheme 320<br>
commands changes in the transmission operation ('Transmission Commands')<br>
including changing the operating range state based upon the inputs and<br>
operation of the powertrain system. This includes commanding execution of a<br>
change in the transmission operating range state if the preferred operating<br>
range state is different from the present operating range state by commanding<br>
changes in application of one or more of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73,<br>
and C4 75 and other transmission commands. The present operating range<br>
state ('Hybrid Range State Actual') and an input speed profile ('NiProf) can<br>
be determined. The input speed profile is an estimate of an upcoming input<br>
speed and preferably comprises a scalar parametric value that is a targeted<br>
input speed for the forthcoming loop cycle. The engine operating commands<br>
and the operator torque request are based upon the input speed profile during a<br>
transition in the operating range state of the transmission.<br>
[0038] A tactical control scheme ('Tactical Control and Operation') 330 is<br>
executed during one of the control loop cycles to determine engine commands<br>
('Engine Commands') for operating the engine 14, including a preferred input<br><br><br>
torque from the engine 14 to the transmission 10 based upon the output speed,<br>
the input speed, and the operator torque request comprising the immediate<br>
accelerator output torque request, the predicted accelerator output torque<br>
request, the immediate brake output torque request, the predicted brake output<br>
torque request, the axle torque response type, and the present operating range<br>
state for the transmission. The engine commands also include engine states<br>
including one of an all-cylinder operating state and a cylinder deactivation<br>
operating state wherein a portion of the engine cylinders are deactivated and<br>
unfueled, and engine states including one of a fueled state and a fuel cutoff<br>
state. An engine command comprising the preferred input torque of the<br>
engine 14 and the present input torque (Ti') reacting between the engine 14<br>
and the input member 12 are preferably determined in the ECM 23. Clutch<br>
torques ('Tel') for each of the clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75,<br>
including the presently applied clutches and the non-applied clutches are<br>
estimated, preferably in the TCM 17.<br>
[0039] An output and motor torque determination scheme ('Output and<br>
Motor Torque Determination') 340 is executed to determine the preferred<br>
output torque from the powertrain ('Tocmd'). This includes determining<br>
motor torque commands ('TA', 'TB') to transfer a net commanded output<br>
torque to the output member 64 of the transmission 10 that meets the operator<br>
torque request, by controlling the first and second electric machines 56 and 72<br>
in this embodiment. The immediate accelerator output torque request, the<br>
immediate brake output torque request, the present input torque from the<br>
engine 14 and the estimated applied clutch torque(s), the present operating<br>
range state of the transmission 10, the input speed, the input speed profile, and<br><br><br>
the axle torque response type are inputs. The output and motor torque<br>
determination scheme 340 executes to determine the motor torque commands<br>
during each iteration of one of the loop cycles. The output and motor torque<br>
determination scheme 340 includes algorithmic code which is regularly<br>
executed during the 6.25 ms and 12.5 ms loop cycles to determine the<br>
preferred motor torque commands.<br>
[0040] The hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer the output torque to<br>
the output member 64 to react with the driveline 90 to generate tractive torque<br>
at wheel(s) 93 to forwardly propel the vehicle in response to the operator input<br>
to the accelerator pedal 113 when the operator selected position of the<br>
transmission gear selector 114 commands operation of the vehicle in the<br>
forward direction. Similarly, the hybrid powertrain is controlled to transfer<br>
the output torque to the output member 64 to react with the driveline 90 to<br>
generate tractive torque at wheel(s) 93 to propel the vehicle in a reverse<br>
direction in response to the operator input to the accelerator pedal 113 when<br>
the operator selected position of the transmission gear selector 114 commands<br>
operation of the vehicle in the reverse direction. Preferably, propelling the<br>
vehicle results in vehicle acceleration so long as the output torque is sufficient<br>
to overcome external loads on the vehicle, e.g., due to road grade,<br>
aerodynamic loads, and other loads.<br>
[0041] Fig. 4 details signal flow in the strategic optimization control scheme<br>
310, which includes a strategic manager 220, an operating range state analyzer<br>
260, and a state stabilization and arbitration block 280 to determine the<br>
preferred input speed ('Ni_Des') and the preferred transmission operating<br>
range state ('Hybrid Range State Des'). The strategic manager ('Strategic<br><br><br>
Manager') 220 monitors the output speed N0, the predicted accelerator output<br>
torque request ('Output Torque Request Accel Prdtd'), the predicted brake<br>
output torque request ('Output Torque Request Brake Prdtd'), and available<br>
battery power PBAT_MIN to PBAT_MAX. The strategic manager 220 determines<br>
which of the transmission operating range states are allowable, and determines<br>
output torque requests comprising a strategic accelerator output torque request<br>
('Output Torque Request Accel Strategic') and a strategic net output torque<br>
request ('Output Torque Request Net Strategic'), all of which are input the<br>
operating range state analyzer 260 along with system inputs ('System Inputs'),<br>
power cost inputs ('Power Cost Inputs'), and any associated penalty costs<br>
('Penalty Costs') for operating outside of predetermined limits. The operating<br>
range state analyzer 260 generates a preferred power cost ('P*cost') and<br>
associated input speed ('NT) for each of the allowable operating range states<br>
based upon the operator torque requests, the system inputs, the available<br>
battery power and the power cost inputs. The preferred power costs and<br>
associated input speeds for the allowable operating range states are input to the<br>
state stabilization and arbitration block 280 which selects the preferred<br>
operating range state and preferred input speed based thereon.<br>
[0042] Fig. 5 shows the operating range state analyzer 260 that executes<br>
searches in each candidate operating range state comprising the allowable ones<br>
of the operating range states, including Ml (262), M2 (264), Gl (270), G2<br>
(272), G3 (274), and G4 (276) to determine preferred operation of the torque<br>
actuators, i.e., the engine 14 and the first and second electric machines 56 and<br>
72 in this embodiment. The preferred operation preferably comprises a<br>
minimum power cost for operating the hybrid powertrain system and an<br><br><br>
associated engine input for operating in the candidate operating range state in<br>
response to the operator torque request. The associated engine input<br>
comprises at least one of a preferred engine input speed ('NI'), a preferred<br>
engine input power ('PI'), and a preferred engine input torque (TI') that is<br>
responsive to and preferably meets the operator torque request. The operating<br>
range state analyzer 260 evaluates powertrain operation in Ml-Engine Off<br>
(264) and M2-Engine Off (266) states to determine a preferred cost ('P*cost')<br>
for operating the powertrain system responsive to and preferably meeting the<br>
operator torque request when the engine 14 is in the engine-off state.<br>
[0043] Fig. 6 schematically shows signal flow for a 1 -dimension search<br>
scheme 610, executed in each of Gl (270), G2 (272), G3 (274), and G4 (276).<br>
A range of one controllable input, in this embodiment comprising minimum<br>
and maximum input torques ('TiMin/Max'), is input to a 1-D search engine<br>
415. The 1-D search engine 415 iteratively generates candidate input torques<br>
('Ti(j)') which range between the minimum and maximum input torques, each<br>
which is input to an optimization function ('Opt To/Ta/Tb') 440, for n search<br>
iterations. Other inputs to the optimization function 440 include system inputs<br>
preferably comprise parametric states for battery power, clutch torques,<br>
electric motor operation, transmission and engine operation, the specific<br>
operating range state and the operator torque request. The optimization<br>
function 440 determines transmission operation comprising an output torque,<br>
motor torques, and associated battery and electrical powers ('To(j), Ta(j),<br>
Tb(j), Pbat(j), Pa(j), Pb(j)') associated with the candidate input torque based<br>
upon the system inputs in response to the operator torque request for the<br>
candidate operating range state. The output torque, motor torques, and<br><br><br>
associated battery powers, penalty costs, and power cost inputs are input to a<br>
cost function 450, which executes to determine a power cost ('Pcost(j)') for<br>
operating the powertrain in the candidate operating range state at the candidate<br>
input torque in response to the operator torque request. The 1 -D search engine<br>
415 iteratively generates candidate input torques over the range of input<br>
torques. The optimization function 440 determines the transmission operation<br>
for each candidate input torque. The cost function 450 determines the<br>
associated power costs. The The 1-D search engine 415 identifies a preferred<br>
input torque ('TI') and associated preferred cost ('P*cost'). The preferred<br>
input torque ('TI') comprises the candidate input torque within the range of<br>
input torques that results in a minimum power cost of the candidate operating<br>
range state, i.e., the preferred cost.<br>
[0044] The preferred operation in each of Ml and M2 can be determined by<br>
executing a 2-dimensional search scheme 620, shown with reference to Figs. 7<br>
and 8, in conjunction with executing a 1-dimensional search using the 1-<br>
dimensional search scheme 610 based upon a previously determined input<br>
speed which can be arbitrated ('Input Speed Stabilization and Arbitration')<br>
615 to determine preferred input speeds ('N*i') and associated preferred costs<br>
('P*cost') for the operating range states.<br>
[0045] Fig. 7 shows the preferred operation in each of continuously variable<br>
modes Ml and M2 executed in blocks 262 and 264 of the operating range state<br>
analyzer 260. This includes executing a 2-dimensional search scheme 620,<br>
shown with reference to Figs. 6 and 8, in conjunction with executing a 1 -<br>
dimensional search using the 1-dimensional search scheme 610 based upon a<br>
previously determined input speed which can be arbitrated ('Input Speed<br><br><br>
Stabilization and Arbitration') 615 to determine preferred costs ('P*cost') and<br>
associated preferred input speeds ('NT) for the operating range states. As<br>
described with reference to Fig. 8, the 2-dimensional search scheme 620<br>
determines a a first preferred cost ('2D P*cost') and an associated first<br>
preferred input speed ('2D NT). The first preferred input speed is input to<br>
the 2-dimensional search scheme 620 and to an adder 612. The adder 612<br>
sums the first preferred input speed and a time-rate change in the input speed<br>
('NI_DOT') multiplied by a predetermined time period ('dt'). The resultant is<br>
input to a switch 605 along with the first preferred input speed determined by<br>
the 2-dimensional search scheme 620. The switch 605 is controlled to input<br>
either the resultant from the adder 612 or the preferred input speed determined<br>
by the 2-dimensional search scheme 620 into the 1-dimensional search scheme<br>
610. The switch 605 is controlled to input the preferred input speed<br>
determined by the 2-dimensional search scheme 620 into the 1 -dimensional<br>
search scheme 610 (as shown) when the powertrain system is operating in a<br>
regenerative braking mode, e.g., when the operator torque request includes a<br>
request to generate an immediate output torque at the output member 64 to<br>
effect a reactive torque with the driveline 90 which preferably decelerates the<br>
vehicle. The switch 605 is controlled to a second position (not shown) to<br>
input the resultant from the adder 612 when the operator torque request does<br>
not include regenerative braking. The 1-dimensional search scheme 610 is<br>
executed to determine a second preferred cost (' 1D P*cost') using the 1 -<br>
dimensional search scheme 610, which is input to the input speed stabilization<br>
and arbitration block 615 to select a final preferred cost and associated<br>
preferred input speed.<br><br><br>
[0046] Fig. 8 schematically shows signal flow for the 2-dimension search<br>
scheme 620. Ranges of two controllable inputs, in this embodiment<br>
comprising minimum and maximum input speeds ('Ni Min/Max') and<br>
minimum and maximum input powers ('Pi Min/Max') are input to a 2-D<br>
search engine 410. In another embodiment, the two controllable inputs can<br>
comprise minimum and maximum input speeds and minimum and maximum<br>
input torques. The 2-D search engine 410 iteratively generates candidate<br>
input speeds ('Ni(j)') and candidate input powers ('Pi(j)') which range<br>
between the minimum and maximum input speeds and powers. The candidate<br>
input power is preferably converted to a candidate input torque ('Ti(j)') (412).<br>
Each candidate input speed ('Ni(j)') and candidate input torque ('Ti(j)') are<br>
input to the optimization function ('Opt To/Ta/Tb') 440, for n search<br>
iterations. Other inputs to the optimization function 440 include system inputs<br>
preferably comprising parametric states for battery power, clutch reactive<br>
torques, maximum and minimum torque outputs from the first and second<br>
electric machines 56 and 72, engine input torque, the specific operating range<br>
state and the operator torque request. The optimization function 440<br>
determines transmission operation comprising an output torque, motor torques,<br>
and associated battery and electrical powers ('To(j), Ta(j), Tb(j), Pbat(j), Pa(j),<br>
Pb(j)') associated with the candidate input power and candidate input speed<br>
based upon the system inputs and the operating torque request for the<br>
candidate operating range state. The output torque, motor torques, and<br>
associated battery powers, penalty costs and power cost inputs are input to a<br>
cost function 450, which executes to determine a power cost ('Pcost(j)') for<br>
operating the powertrain at the candidate input power and candidate input<br><br><br>
speed in response to the operator torque request in the candidate operating<br>
range state. The 2-D search engine 410 iteratively generates the candidate<br>
input speeds and candidate input powers over the range of input speeds and<br>
range of input powers. The optimization function 440 determines the<br>
transmission operation for each candidate input speed and candidate input<br>
power. The cost function 450 determines the associated power costs. The 2-D<br>
search engine 410 identifies a preferred input power ('PI') and preferred<br>
input speed ('NI') and associated preferred cost ('P*cost'). The preferred<br>
input power ('PI') and preferred input speed ('NI') comprises the candidate<br>
input power and candidate input speed that result in a minimum power cost for<br>
the candidate operating range state.<br>
[0047] Fig. 9 schematically shows power flow and power losses through<br>
hybrid powertrain system, in context of the exemplary powertrain system<br>
described above. There is a first power flow path from a fuel storage system 9<br>
which transfers fuel power ('PFUEL') to the engine 14 which transfers input<br>
power ('Pi') to the transmission 10. The power loss in the first flow path<br>
comprises engine power losses ('PLOSS ENG')- There is a second power flow<br>
path which transfers electric power ('PBAT') from the ESD 74 to the TPIM 19<br>
which transfers electric power ('PINVELEC') to the first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72 which transfer motor mechanical power ('PMOTOR MECH ')<br>
to the transmission 10. The power losses in the second power flow path<br>
include battery power losses ('PLOSS BATT') and electric motor power losses<br>
('PLOSS MOTOR')- The TPIM 19 has an electric power load ('PHV LOAD') that<br>
services electric loads in the system ('HV Loads'), which can include a low<br>
voltage battery storage system (not shown). The transmission 10 has a<br><br><br>
mechanical inertia power input ('PINERTIA') in the system ('Inertia Storage')<br>
that preferably include inertias from the engine 14 and the transmission 10.<br>
The transmission 10 has mechanical power losses ('PLOSS MECH') and power<br>
output ('POUT')- The brake system 94 has brake power losses ('PLOSS BRAKE')<br>
and the remaining power is transferred to the driveline as axle power<br>
('PAXLE').<br>
[0048] The power cost inputs to the cost function 450 are determined based<br>
upon factors related to vehicle driveability, fuel economy, emissions, and<br>
battery usage. Power costs are assigned and associated with fuel and<br>
electrical power consumption and are associated with a specific operating<br>
points of the hybrid powertrain. Lower operating costs can be associated with<br>
lower fuel consumption at high conversion efficiencies, lower battery power<br>
usage, and lower emissions for each engine speed/load operating point, and<br>
take into account the candidate operating state of the engine 14. As described<br>
hereinabove, the power costs may include the engine power losses ('PLOSS<br>
ENG'), electric motor power losses ('PLOSS MOTOR'), battery power losses ('PLOSS<br>
BATT'), brake power losses ('PLOSS BRAKE'), and mechanical power losses<br>
('PLOSS MECH') associated with operating the hybrid powertrain at a specific<br>
operating point which includes input speed, motor speeds, input torque, motor<br>
torques, a transmission operating range state and an engine state.<br>
[0049] The mechanical power loss in the transmission 10 includes power<br>
losses due to rotational spinning, torque transfer, and friction, and operation of<br>
parasitic loads, e.g., a hydraulic pump (not shown) for the transmission 10.<br>
The mechanical power loss can be determined for each operating range state<br><br>
for the transmission 14 and input speed. Mechanical power loss related to the<br>
input speed ('Ni') and the output speed ('No') can be represented by Eq. 1:<br>
PMECHLOSS=aN1+bN12+cN1N0+dN20	[1]<br>
wherein a, b, c, and d comprise calibrated scalar values determined for the<br>
specific powertrain system and each specific transmission operating range<br>
state.<br>
[0050] Thus, in fixed gear operation, i.e., in one of the fixed gear operating<br>
ranges states of Gl, G2, G3 and G4 for the embodiment described herein, the<br>
power cost input comprising the mechanical power loss to the cost function<br>
450 can be predetermined outside of the 1-dimension search scheme 610. In<br>
mode operation, i.e., in one of the mode operating ranges states of Ml and M2<br>
for the embodiment described herein, the power cost input comprising the<br>
mechanical power loss to the cost function 450 can be determined during each<br>
iteration of the search scheme 620.<br>
[0051] The state stabilization and arbitration block 280 selects a preferred<br>
transmission operating range state ('Hybrid Range State Des') which<br>
preferably is the transmission operating range state associated with the<br>
minimum preferred cost for the allowed operating range states output from the<br>
operating range state analyzer 260, taking into account factors related to<br>
arbitrating effects of changing the operating range state on the operation of the<br>
transmission to effect stable powertrain operation. The preferred input speed<br>
('Ni_Des') is the engine input speed associated with the preferred engine input<br>
comprising the preferred engine input speed ('NI'), the preferred engine input<br><br><br>
power ('PI'), and the preferred engine input torque ('TI') that is responsive<br>
to and preferably meets the operator torque request for the selected preferred<br>
transmission operating range state. Due to subjective constraints imposed on<br>
a system such as that herein described, the transmission operating range state<br>
selected may not in all cases be that which is truly optimal from the standpoint<br>
of energy usage and power losses.<br>
[0052] In one embodiment, such a system may provide a search method for<br>
determining a desirable input speed for a transmission in a combination that<br>
comprises at least one torque actuator mechanically coupled to the<br>
transmission, the torque actuator contributing to the input speed of said<br>
transmission. One search method includes first selecting a potential operating<br>
point for the at least one torque actuator from a search range, in which the<br>
potential operating point has associated with it a transmission input speed<br>
value and a transmission input power value. For purposes of the disclosure,<br>
the term 'candidate' can be used interchangeably with the term 'potential' in<br>
describing operating points and transmission operating range states. A<br>
plurality of power losses associated with operation of the combination at the<br>
potential operating point is determined, each which is combined to provide a<br>
total power loss for that point. The selection of a potential operating point,<br>
determination of power losses and their combination is repeated to provide a<br>
plurality of potential operating points, each of which have a total power loss<br>
associated with them. The potential operating points are evaluated for<br>
desirability, based on at least one criteria selected from the group consisting<br>
of: objective operating criteria and subjective operating criteria, and one<br>
operating point is selected from the plurality of potential operating points.<br><br><br>
Conducting such a search method under the constraint that the output power of<br>
said transmission is kept substantially-constant provides that the contours of<br>
the power losses (costs) are more prone to be linear when defined in an N1, P1<br>
plane, thus providing advantageous rapidity for a search engine that<br>
incorporates such methodology to convergence on an operating point of<br>
interest.<br>
[0053] A search engine such as 410 can be conceived of as operating on a<br>
defined two-dimensional space that contains points corresponding to candidate<br>
Ni and PI values for each potential transmission operating range state, such as<br>
space S as shown in FIG. 10 as the region on the coordinate axes bounded by<br>
Pi Min, PI Max, N1 Min, and N1 Max, wherein P1represents input power to the<br>
electro-mechanical hybrid transmission and N1 is the transmission input speed.<br>
The space S, which is the search range, is defined using hardware<br>
specifications, which typically include electric machine operating speed limits,<br>
engine operating speed limits, transmission output speed, and engine torque<br>
limits. However, in general, the space S is not disposed at a static location on<br>
the P1 , N1 coordinate axes, but rather changes its position over time in response<br>
to operating conditions, which may include changes in operator torque<br>
requests and changes in road grade. Changes in the location of the space S on<br>
the P1 , N1 coordinate axes can occur at every iteration of an operational loop in<br>
a microprocessor carrying out the iterations and can occur at intervals as short<br>
as 1 millisecond. Thus, over a few seconds time, the space S may effectively<br>
sweep out a very large space over potential values within the P1 , N1 coordinate<br>
axes. In accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure, a reduction the<br>
effective size of the space S is effected.<br><br><br>
[0054] In one embodiment a search engine such as search engine 410<br>
selects, either randomly or according to any desired algorithm, an N1 and P1<br>
pair present in the space S, and a maximum transmission output torque (To<br>
Max) and a minimum transmission output torque (To Min) associated with the<br>
N1 and P1pair chosen is calculated based on system constraints. Repetition of<br>
this method for a large number of different potential N1 and P1pairs provides a<br>
plurality of different To Min and To Max values for each potential<br>
transmission operating range state. The method is repeated for each potential<br>
transmission operating range state and a plurality of To Min and To Max pairs<br>
are generated for the space S of and for each potential transmission operating<br>
range state and NI and P[ pairs provided.<br>
[0055] From such plurality of different To Min and To Max values so<br>
generated by a search engine for a given potential transmission operating<br>
range state, the NI and PI pair having the highest To Max value associated with<br>
each potential transmission operating range state is generally selected as the<br>
preferred NI and PI pair when an operator torque request is greater than To<br>
Max. In some embodiments for cases in which an operator torque request is<br>
less than To Min, the potential NI and PI pair associated with the lowest To<br>
Min value is generally selected as the preferred NI and PI for the particular<br>
potential transmission operating range state under consideration. In any event,<br>
it is in generally desirable to be able to quickly locate, within a space S for<br>
each potential transmission operating range state, that NI and PI pair that has<br>
the least power losses associated with it. The effectiveness of such a task is<br>
inhibited by the fact that the location of the space S is moving essentially<br><br>
constantly, which over time makes the effective size of the search range of the<br>
space S very large.<br>
[0056] Towards reduction of the effective size of the space S, pre-<br>
calculations are undertaken in a computer simulation which in one<br>
embodiment is not operatively connected to a drivetrain as described herein.<br>
Such pre-calculations, or off-line simulations, are carried out using values for<br>
engine coolant temperature, engine torque curves, battery power limits,<br>
electric machine speed limits, electric machine torque limits, transmission oil<br>
temperature, and battery state-of-charge which are frequently encountered by a<br>
motorized vehicle during its operation, to determine maximum and minimum<br>
values for NI and PI which can be used to define a space S that is smaller in<br>
range than the space S that is encountered during use of a search engine and<br>
system useful therewith as herein described. Without use of a method as<br>
described herein, the search range embraced by the space S was based on Nj<br>
min and NI max values that were based on speed-based system constraints and<br>
Pi min and PI max values that were based on TI min and TI max values<br>
provided by the ECM 23; however a method as provided herein narrows down<br>
the search range embraced by the space S, based on off-line simulation results.<br>
[0057] In one embodiment of the disclosure the Ni, PI plane representing<br>
search range embraced by the space S is determined by first choosing one<br>
point in that plane and evaluating it for power losses. Other points are chosen,<br>
either arbitrarily or according to any desire algorithm and similarly evaluated<br>
for power loss if the system were operating at those points. By evaluating, via<br>
an off-line computer simulation, a large number of points (which may be on<br>
the order of 100,000 points), a contour plot such as that shown in FIG. 11 is<br><br><br>
obtained. The contour lines present in the plot of FIG. 11 represent points<br>
having equal power losses, or costs associated with operating at those points.<br>
The process of generating a plot such as that shown in FIG. 11 is repeated for<br>
points having different combinations of transmission output speeds and<br>
transmission output torques to provide one such plot as shown in FIG. 11 for<br>
each No, To point. By such a method, an off-line "library" of plots is<br>
generated, the number of which plots is determined by the desires of the<br>
programmer, for example, in one embodiment, a library containing about 2500<br>
of such plots is generated.<br>
[0058] Thus, according to the foregoing, the search range was determined by<br>
an off-line simulation that evaluates each point in the Ni, PI plane within the<br>
"large" search range space S set by system constraints. FIG. 11 shows the<br>
total power loss (Cost) at an operating point (No, To) in the Ni, PI domain.<br>
The steep contour changes represent the violation of system constraints, e.g.,<br>
To, Ta, Tb, Ti, and Peatt. The suggested search range space S excludes<br>
operating points that violate system constraints and points associated with<br>
large costs that are (subjectively) determined as non desirable. For To points<br>
that are beyond the deliverable To limits, a torque margin is included in the<br>
window search determination, so that the window does not shrink to a single<br>
point in the search plane.<br>
[0059] From FIG. 11 one can get an idea of locations within the plot where<br>
the energy losses (costs, as expressed in units of power therein) are relatively<br>
small, which is the area labeled B within the highlighted box in FIG. 11. The<br>
space labeled B in FIG. 11 may be determined using an algorithm, one<br>
example of which is shown below:<br><br><br>
If To &gt; To Max Max - To Margin<br>
Find Ni, PI Range where (To Max 
penalty Cost 
(PBatt Penalty cost <d></d>
Elself To &gt; To MinMin + To Margin<br>
Find Ni, PI Range where (To Min 
penalty Cost 
(PBatt Penalty cost <d></d>
Else<br>
Find Ni, PI Range where (To Min 
a) &amp; ( Tb Penalty Cost 
<d power loss cost e></d>
End<br>
in which a, b, c, and d are cost criteria that can reduce the search range to<br>
exclude operating points that reside outside of the system constraints. Setting<br>
these values to 0 will exclude all points not within the constraints. Setting the<br>
values to a small, non-zero positive value has the effect of providing a margin<br>
around each of the system constraints to minimize the effect of simulation<br>
errors that could otherwise erroneously exclude points that are within the<br>
constraints. The Ta/Tb/Ti/PBatt penalty costs refer to the costs that are<br>
imposed to the Ni, PI pair that is associated with Ta, Tb, Ti, PBatt points that<br>
are not within their achievable limits. In general, these penalty costs are<br>
provided to increase proportionally with the amount of how much each point<br>
exceeds each achievable limit. The cost criteria "e" can further reduce the<br>
search range to exclude points that are within the system constraints but have<br>
high objective power loss costs subjectively determined as being non-optimal.<br>
In the first If step, a ToMax(ToMin) is calculated for each Ni, PI point that is<br><br>
evaluated by including the Output Torque limiting inside the search loop.<br>
ToMaxMax (ToMinMin) is the maximum(minimum) of all ToMax(ToMin),<br>
which represents the maximum(minimum) output torque that can be produced<br>
within the evaluated Ni, PI range. In the Else step, the Objective Power Loss<br>
cost is the sum of battery power loss, machine power loss, engine power loss,<br>
and transmission power loss.<br>
[0060] A process as set forth above with respect to determining the area B on<br>
FIG. 11 may be repeated, for each plot that exists in the library that was<br>
generated during the off-line simulation, to arrive at an area for each plot that<br>
is analogous to area B of FIG. 11. In the hypothetical case, such as the one<br>
mentioned above in which a library containing 2500 of such plots is generated,<br>
an area analogous to area B of FIG. 11 is generated for each of the 2500 plots.<br>
However, the area B of FIG. 11 can be represented by the four points which<br>
define the rectangle of area B therein, and in a method according to one<br>
embodiment of the disclosure in which a library containing 2500 of the<br>
aforementioned plots were generated, one outcome is a set of four points for<br>
each of the 2500 plots generated.<br>
[0061] An alternate representation of the four points for each of the 2500<br>
plots so generated per the foregoing, is to provide four tables of data, each of<br>
which four tables of data comprise 2500 entries, and each of which four tables<br>
contain values of NI min, Nj max, PI min, and PI max, as shown in FIG. 12.<br>
Such a table containing NI min values is amplified in the bubble of FIG. 12<br>
and is seen to comprise fifty columns of No values and fifty rows of To<br>
values. It is well known in the art to convert power values to torque values<br>
when the rpm is known. The tables for the NI max, Pj min, and PI max are<br><br><br>
similarly structured. Thus, when a vehicle operator makes a power request<br>
having No and To values associated with it such as is shown at the top of FIG.<br>
12, determination of the NI min value associated with such a power request is<br>
readily found by reference to the Nj min table. For example, if the operator<br>
power request comprises an No value of 1000 rpm and a T0 value of 1500<br>
Newton* Meters, a microprocessor refers to the table for the Nj min values and<br>
simply finds the box having the location 1000, 1500 and extracts the value for<br>
Ni min(a). In like fashion, values for Nj max, PI min, and PI max for the<br>
operator torque request having an No value of 1000 rpm and a To value of<br>
1500 Newton*Meters are readily extracted from the other three tables. As one<br>
of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes, the number of plots generated<br>
being 2500 in this one example was chosen for illustrative purposes, and any<br>
desired number of plots may be generated. The values of the parameters No<br>
and To in the example of FIG. 12 are discrete numbers, and for determining<br>
numerical values of No and To which reside between the values of the rows<br>
and columns, simple mathematical interpolation is employed.<br>
[0062] Thus, a method for determining a set of values for NI min, Nj max, Pi<br>
min, and PI max for input to a 2-D search engine such as 410 has been<br>
provided, and these values of NI min, NI max, PI min, and PI max are<br>
sufficient to define search range space S having a substantially smaller size<br>
than what is otherwise provided by a system as described herein. This<br>
decreased size of the space S provided by a method according to this<br>
disclosure translates to decreased demand on computer resources and<br>
accordingly results in more efficient searching and faster pinpointing of exact<br>
operating points for potential transmission operating modes.<br><br><br>
[0063] It is understood that modifications are allowable within the scope of<br>
the disclosure. The disclosure has been described with specific reference to<br>
the preferred embodiments and modifications thereto. Further modifications<br>
and alterations may occur to others upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. It is intended to include all such modifications and alterations<br>
insofar as they come within the scope of the disclosure.<br><br>
