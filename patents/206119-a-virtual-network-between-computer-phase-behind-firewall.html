APPARATUS, METHOD, AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR BUILDING VIRTUAL NETWORKS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to communications over computer networks and more particularly, to systems and methods for building virtual networks on top of global area computer networks, such as, for example, the Internet.<br>
As an interdependency between businesses in the Internet economy increases, enterprises rely heavily on communication with business partners, suppliers, and customers to conduct business operations successfully and expeditiously.<br>
However, most enterprise networks today are protected by one or more security features, including firewalls. Firewalls help these enterprises increase control over the underlying data, which can increase their business privacy. The wide use of firewalls to partition off private networks from public networks contributes to solving a potential shortage of IPv4 addresses. As a side effect, firewalls split the whole Internet into many not-fully-bi-directionally-connected network islands. Connectivity between enterprises on these islands becomes problematic.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram of a network system 100 divided into a plurality of "network islands" 105i. Each island 105i includes a firewall 110i and a plurality of computing systems (e. g., a server 115i, a desktop 120i and a laptop 125i).<br>
While each firewall 110i is often configured differently from other firewalls 110i, they each limit full bi-directional data flow. As shown in Fig 1, each computing system that is behind firewall 1101 is not freely accessible from another computing system that is behind firewall 1102, although both of them have connections toward public Internet 130.<br>
Besides firewall 110 filtering/blocking features, a major reason for the connectivity problem between computing systems behind different firewalls 11 Oi is the different private address spaces they use. Firewall 1101 and firewall 1102 help to define different address spaces for the individual islands 1051 and 1052, respectively. In actuality, this isolates different private areas among the public Internet. By applying NAT (Network Address Translation), each computing system of each island 105i is able to access Internet<br><br>
130, but will lose any IP connectivity into computing systems within each island 105i, unless special administration is used in cooperation with firewalls 110i.<br>
What is needed is a way to solve this connectivity problem, and particularly to provide systems and methods to build virtual networks for TCP/IP networking to enable computing systems of different network islands to interconnect and cooperate.<br>
Additionally, to provide a system and method for existing TCP/IP based applications to be seamlessly extended onto different network islands, with that extension to be setup dynamically across network island boundaries.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

The present invention relates to providing systems and methods to build virtual networks for TCP/IP networking, thereby enabling computing systems of different network islands to interconnect and cooperate. Additionally, the present invention provides a system and method for existing TCP/IP based applications to be seamlessly extended onto different network islands, with that extension setup dynamically across network island boundaries.

Figure 2 is a schematic block diagram of a preferred embodiment for a virtual network system 200. System 200 includes a virtual network hosting server 205 providing a server environment for the present invention. Similarly, computing systems of each network island 105i (e. g.,computer system 120i) provide a client environment for the present invention. Each computing system 120i is connected to server 205 through a computer<br><br><br>
network 130 (e. g., internet). This connection from 120i to network 130, due to firewall 110i, is only be an outgoing connection like any HTTP connection created from HTTP client to HTTP server. In addition, the present invention presents a method for creating firewall tunnel via standard SSL Tunneling Protocol, known as HTTP CONNECT method for the connection.<br>
Server 205 can be any type of electronic device that is capable of accepting and estabhshing connections between other server computer systems and client computei; systems, and also be able to exchange data through the created connections. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, Virtual Network Hosting Server 205 includes processor (s), memory, storage disks, operating system software, application software and communication software.

In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, client computer systems (e.g., desktop 120i) includes processor (s), memory, storage disks, operating system software, application software and communication software.<br>
Processor (s) can be any suitable processor, such as a member of the Intel Pentium family of processors. Memory can be any type of memory, such as DRAM, SRAM. Storage disks can be any type of devices that are designed for storing digital data such as hard disks, floppy disks. Operating system software can be any type of suitable operating system<br><br><br>

Communication software can be any type of software that enables the data communication between the client computer system and server computer systems, the software includes the instructions that implement the client side functions for creating virtual networks specified in the present invention.<br>
Global area computer network 130 can be any type of computer network that includes numerous computers that can communicate with one another. In some embodiments of the-present invention, global area computer network is shown as Internet.<br>
Firewalls, such as firewall HOi, can be of any hardware device or software system that enforces an access control between two networks, particularly, in some embodiments of the present invention, the two networks refer to the enterprise private network and the Global area computer network such as Internet 130.<br>
System 200 also includes a virtual network 210 is a software implemented network object, which has the same characteristics as a physical network such as Ethernet. It appears at each client computer system as if it were another physical network interface, and at server computer systems, it appears as a software object managed by server communication software.<br>
As described in greater detail below, the present invention provides systems and methods for building virtual network 210 on top of global area computer network, such as Internet 130.<br>
To form virtual network 210, each participating client computer system (e. g., Desktop 120i) first establishes a connection with the server computer system (e. g., Virtual Network Hosting Server 205) that will host virtual network 210. Depending on which virtual network 210 any particular client computer system wants to participant in, server communication software associates the connection from the client computer system to its corresponding virtual network object, server communication will also manage the data<br><br><br>
exchange activities that happen on the virtual network, between each individual client computer system or broadcasting on the entire virtual network.<br>
Figure 3 is a schematic of a preferred embodiment for a server communication application 300. Application 300 includes a plurality of virtual network objects (e. g., 305, 310 and 315). in FIG. 3, one client computer system (e. g., desktop 1201) and another client computer system (e. g., desktop 1202) are participants to the virtual network 200 by communicating with Virtual Network Object 305 that was created by the communication software 300 on server computer system 205. Server 205, through object 305, manages virtual network 210.<br>
Figure 4 is a diagram illustrating a connection sequence between a client system and a host server system across a firewall permitting TCP CONNECT requests. In the case that the firewall (e. g., firewall HOi) allows a direct outgoing connection to created between the client computer system (e. g., desktop 120i) and the server computer system (e. G., Virtual Network Hosting Server 205), the connection is established as the sequences shown in FIG. 4.<br>
In FIG. 4, firewall 1101 passes the outgoing TCP CONNECT request. Therefore, desktop 1201 directly creates a connection with Virtual Network Hosting Server 205 in the sequences shown in the figure. For such a direct TCP connection, client computer system issues the TCP CONNECT request directly to the server computer system, the firewall between the client computer system and the server computer system performs NAT (Network Address Translation) for the request and lets the TCP CONNECT pass through, similarly, the response and further data exchange will be allowed by firewall accordingly.<br>
Figure 5 is a diagram illustrating a connection sequence between a client system and a host<br>
server system across a firewall not permitting TCP CONNECT requests. In the case that<br>
the firewall (e.g., firewall 1202) does not allow arbitrary client computer system (e. g.,<br>
desktop 1202) to connect to server computer system (e. g., virtual network hosting server<br>
205), system 200 uses the SSL Tunneling Protocol for passing through firewall 1102. In<br>
most cases, although firewall 1102 does not allow arbitrary outgoing connections to be<br>
made, firewall 1102 often allows some intermediate servers like SOCKS servers and HTTP<br>
proxy servers to make outgoing connections. FIG. 5 shows the sequences for connection<br>
using SSL Tunneling Protocol. In such a case, the client computer system (desktop 1202)<br>
does not create a direct TCP connection with the server computer system (Virtual Network<br><br>
Hosting Server 205), instead, the request will be forwarded by a HTTP proxy Server 5002 using SSL Tunneling Protocol as shown in the Figure 5. Unlike a direct connection case, the client computer system (desktop 1202) first establishes a direct TCP connection with HTTP Proxy Server 5002. After the TCP connection with HTTP Proxy Server 5002 has been created, desktop 1202 initiates the SSL tunneling request via the HTTP CONNECT method. The general syntax for tunneling requests follows:<br>
CONNECT <host address>: <port> HTTP/1. 0<br>
... HTTP request headers, followed by an empty line<br>
Once HTTP Proxy Server 5002 receives the tunneling requests, it will eventually establish a connection with the target server and will forward data between the request client and the server in between until any one of the three parties terminates the underlying TCP connection.<br>
Figure 6 is a flowchart diagram for detecting the applicable network environment of a client computing system. Due to the different connection procedures based upon the specific network environment differences of client computer systems, communication software on client computer systems detects the network environment before any attempt to-request a connection to the server computer system is made. FIG. 6 gives a flow-chat diagram for a preferred detection/selection process 600.<br>
Process 600 begins, step 605, with client communication on software (e. g., on desktop 120i) testing the applicable network environment. In the preferred embodiment, this test determines whether HTTP proxy server 500i is available. When the server is not available, process 600 advances to step 610 to implement the connection sequence shown in Figure 4. However, if the test at step 605 determines that the server is available, process 600 advances to step 615 instead to implement the connection sequence shown in Figure 5. Process 600 concludes after step 610 or step 615 has been performed.<br>
As shown both in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5, after a physical connection has been established, whether it is a direct TCP connection or an indirect TCP connection via a HTTP Proxy server, the client computer system and the server computer system may perform whatever negotiation that is necessary or desirable. This negotiation may include version check,<br><br><br>
security protocol negotiation and connection authentication. The negotiation may involve multiple rounds of data exchange for the handshaking of both parties.<br>
Figure 7 is a schematic diagram illustrating a software architecture 700 of the communication software on a client computer system (e. g., desktop 120i). architecture 700 contains two major software components, a Virtual Network Client Runtime component 705 and a Virtual Network Adapter component 710.<br>
Virtual Network Client Runtime component 705 uses Networking services provided by the host operating system running on the client computer system to establish the connection with the server computer system (e. G., Virtual Network Hosting Server 205) and participate into the data exchange session that belongs to virtual network 200 and managed by the communication software both in the client and server computer systems.<br>
Eventually, Virtual Network Adapter 710 will be loaded by Virtual Network Client Runtime 705, from which virtual network 200 will be presented at the client computer system. Any network applications 715 that are running on the client computer will be aware of adapter 710 and will use it just like any other physical networks that the client computer system may be attached to.<br>
Before virtual network 200 is used, Virtual Network Adapter 710 must be configured properly. Adapter 710 has dynamic attributes for both a physical address and a logical address, complicating the configuration. The present invention provides ways to address the issues related with these two kinds of addresses.<br>
Virtual network adapter 710 is able to simulate any physical media type, in the preferred embodiment IEEE 802.3 Ethernet is used. IEEE 802.3 Ethernet addresses are a 48-bit address, having 24 bits of vendor ID and 24 bits of serial number of the interface (assigned by the vendor), every Ethernet address is thus unique in the global context. The present invention creates virtual networks dynamically, therefore, each instantiated virtual network adapter 710 is dynamically assigned its own physical adapter addresses.<br>
Some systems do not allow dynamic changes to adapter physical addresses. To solve this, the present invention uses a pseudo physical address. Every virtual adapter 710 is statically configured with a pseudo physical address that in the preferred embodiment is<br><br>
the same for each adapter 710. In order to distinguish virtual adapters 710 at the physical address level, a modified Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) process is used.<br>
Figure 8 is a flowchart of a modified ARP process 800 used to distinguish virtual adapters 710 at the physical address level. Every virtual adapter 710 is configured with the same pseudo physical address, however this pseudo physical address is only visible to the adapter itself, every other adapter will be viewed with its dynamically assigned physical addresses.<br>
Process 800 begins at step 805 with the communication software in a client computer system checking packet details of each ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request. The communications software collects all the necessary information for further actions.<br>
Next, at step 810, process 800 checks if the ARP request is for the dynamically assigned physical address for the adapter instantiated at the client computer system.<br>
When the answer is YES, process 800 advances to step 815, Otherwise process 800 ignores<br>
this ARP request	<br>
In step 815, process 800 checks whether the ARP request was sent from the local computer system. When the ARP request was sent from the local computer system, process 800 responds with the fixed pseudo physical address, otherwise process 800 responds with the dynamically assigned physical address.<br>
The dynamic physical address is assigned by the communication software that runs at server computer system 205, generated by combining a vendor ID and a dynamically allocated serial number that is unique in the virtual network.<br>
Just like physical address assignments for TCP/IP networking, TCP/IP settings are configured for each virtual network adapter 710 as well. Communication software at client computer systems and server computer systems cooperate to prevent address conflict among virtual networks, and computer systems on those networks.<br>
Client computer systems of the virtual networks may span multiple enterprise networks. Arbitration facilities that exist on individual private networks are managed differently and are unlikely to be suitable for the virtual networks. Therefore, the IP address allocation for<br><br>
a virtual network may have conflict problems with some private networks. The present invention provides a subnet localization method to address the this possibility.<br>
IP addresses contain two parts, a network ID portion and a host ID portion, the subnet localization method works on the network ID portion. Upon the creation of the virtual network, a preferred network ID is picked. This preferred network ID is used whenever possible once the client communication software tries to configure the TCP/IP settings for the virtual adapter. FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating a network ID selection process 900 that the communication software on the client computer system uses to determine the network ID of a virtual network. Process 900 includes a test step 905 to determine whether the selected preferred network ID conflicts with the local system.<br>
When a conflict does not occur, the preferred network ID may be used. When a conflict exists, the local system selects another candidate network ID, and returns to step 905 to test the candidate network ID.<br>
When the preferred network ID is unable to be selected for a client computer system, this client computer system will have a localized view of the virtual network. A localized view means that, while other client computer systems see the virtual network with the network ID of a preferred ID, the client computer system will view the virtual network as having a network ID that is locally selected. In order to allow it to be able to communicate with others, a special process is implemented on the client communication software. For every IP packet that passes through the client systems, client communication software performs a connection-based address translation process<br>
FIG. 10 is the flowchart diagram for a connection-based address translation process 1000 for incoming TCP-packets passed through the virtual adapter. Process 1000 begins with step 1005 and tests whether an incoming packet is a TCP SYN packet. When it is a TCP SYN packet, process 1000 performs the steps beginning at 1010, otherwise process 1000 executes actions beginning at 1045.<br>
At step 1010, process 1000 tests whether the network ID in the source IP address matches the network ID of the virtual adapter. When they do not match an address translation is performed as shown in step 1015 (change source ID) and step 1020 (update checksums). In addition, at step 1025, process 1000 creates a mapping entry based on the source IP and<br><br>
source port for later use during address translation. After completing step 1015 through step 1025 when the test at step 1010 was negative, or after step 1010 when the test is affirmative, process 1000 performs another test at step 1030. This test determines whether the destination network ID matches the network ID of the virtual adapter. When it does, process 1000 ends. When it does not match, process 1000 executes step 1035 (changes destination network ID to match the network ID of the virtual adapter) and step 1040 (updates checksums) before ending.<br>
For TCP packets that are not SYN packets, process 1000 executes step 1045 from the test at step 1005. When a mapping entry exists for the source IP address/source port, process 1000 performs a test at step 1050, otherwise process 1000 ends.<br>
At step 1050, process 1000 tests whether the network ID in the source IP address matches the network ID of the virtual adapter. When they do not match an address translation is performed as shownin step 1055 (change source ID) and step 1060 (update checksums). After completing step 1055 through step 1060 when the test at step 1050 was negative, or after step 1050 when the test is affirmative, process 1000 performs the steps beginning at the test of step 1030 as described above.<br>
FIG. 11 is the flowchart diagram for an outgoing TCP packet process 1100 applicable to packets passed through the virtual adapter. Process 1100 tests at step 1105, for every outgoing TCP packet, whether a mapping entry exists with the information based on the destination address and the destination port in the packet. When a mapping entry is not found, process 1100 ends. When the mapping entry is found, process 1100 performs the actions starting at step 1110.<br>
Step 1110 is a test to determine whether a network ID of the source IP address matches the original network ID record in the mapping entry. When the network ID of the source IP address does not match the original network ID record in the mapping entry, process 1100 performs address translation as specified in step 1115 (change source ID to match the original ID as set forth in the entry) and step 1120 (update checksums).<br>
After step 1115 and step 1120, or after the test at step 1110 determines there is a match, process 1100 performs another test at step 1125 to determine whether the network ID of the destination IP address matches the original network ID record in the mapping entry.<br><br><br>
When the network ID of the destination IP address matches the original network ID record in the mapping entry, process 1100 ends.<br>
When the network ID of the destination IP address does not match the original network ID record in the mapping entry, process 1100 performs the address translation specified in step 1130 (change destination IP address in the packet to make it match the original source network ID record in the entry) and step 1135 (update checksums). For every change in the packet, IP checksum and TCP checksum are recalculated and updated, as shown in step 1120 and step 1135 accordingly.<br>
In addition to the assignment of IP addresses, the present invention also provides a method to implement a client-based DNS (Domain Name Service) service, so that every connected client computer system can have a DNS name that is associated with its dynamically assigned IP address. The mapping between the IP address and the associated DNS name will be performed by the communication software running at the client computer system.<br>
To resolve a DNS name in the "non-virtual" world, two major components in the DNS system are typically involved, a DNS server and a DNR (Domain Name Resolver).<br>
The preferred embodiment works in cooperation with the DNR component. For operating system software like Windows operation system, the DNR component is designed with an open architecture allowing insertion of name service providers. By providing such a name service provider, the client communication software hosts its own name service on top of the virtual network:<br>
FIG. 12 is the flowchart diagram for a DNS name request process 1200 for handling DNS name requests issued at a client computer system. Process 1200 performed by the communication software at client computer system provides the name service for the virtual network. Process 1200 begins with a test (step 1205) to determine whether a name at the name space is defined for the virtual network.<br>
When the name request matches the name space pattern defined for the virtual network, step 1210 will be performed and the dynamically assigned IP address is returned directly<br><br><br>
at client computer system, without contacting to any DNS servers. That is, the name resolution is completed totally at client machine.<br>
When the name request does not matches the name space pattern defined for the virtual network, step 1215 will be performed, and the request will be forward to the default DNR. Therefore, an additional name space is built to supplement the regular DNS name space in this way.<br>
One of the preferred implementations of the present invention is as a routine in an operating system made up of programming steps or instructions resident in the RAM of computer system, during computer operations. Until required by computer system, the program instructions may be stored in another readable medium, e.g. in the disk drive, or in a removable memory, such as an optical disk for use in a CD ROM computer input or in a floppy disk for use in a floppy disk drive computer input. Further, the program instructions may be stored in the memory of another computer prior to use in the system of the present invention and transmitted over a LAN or a WAN, such as the Internet, when required by the user of the present invention. One skilled in the art should appreciate that the processes controlling the present invention are capable of being distributed in the form of computer readable media in a variety of forms.<br>
