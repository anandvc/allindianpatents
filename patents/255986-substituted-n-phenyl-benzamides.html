SUBSTITUTED N-ARYL BENZAMIDES AND RELATED COMPOUNDS FOR TREATMENT OF AMYLOID DISEASES AND SYNUCLEINOPATHIES<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. provisional application Serial Nos. 60/570,669, entitled "  Substituted N-Aryl Benzamides and Related Compounds for Treatment of Amyloid Diseases and Synucleinopathies" to Snow et al., filed May 12, 2004 and 60/629,525, entitled " Substituted N-Aryl Benzamides and Related Compounds for Treatment of Amyloid Diseases and Synuoleinopathies" to Snow et al, filed November 18, 2004. The contents of the provisional applications are incorporated by reference herein. TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
Provided herein are substituted N-aryl benzamides and related compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treatment of amyloid diseases, including beta-amyloid protein (Aβ), such as observed in Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), such as observed in type 2 diabetes, and alpha-synuclein, such as observed in Parkinson's disease. BACKGROUND<br>
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of a 39-43 amino acid peptide termed the p-amyloid protein or Ap, in a fibrillar form, existing as extracellular amyloid plaques and as amyloid within the walls of cerebral blood vessels. Fibrillar Aβ amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease is believed to be detrimental to the patient and eventually leads to toxicity and neuronal cell death, characteristic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Accumulating evidence implicates amyloid, and more specifically, the formation, deposition, accumulation and/or persistence of Aβ fibrils, as a major causative factor of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. In addition, besides Alzheimer's disease, a number of other amyloid diseases involve formation, deposition, accumulation and persistence of Aβ fibrils, including Down's syndrome, disorders involving congophilic angiopathy, such as but not limited to, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage of the Dutch type, inclusion body myositosis, dementia pugilistica, cerebral p-amyloid angiopathy, dementia associated<br><br>
with progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia associated with cortical basal degeneration and mild cognitive impairment.<br>
Parkinson's disease is another human disorder characterized by the formation, deposition, accumulation and/or persistence of abnormal fibrillar protein deposits that demonstrate many of the characteristics of amyloid. In Parkinson's disease, an accumulation of cytoplasmic Lewy bodies consisting of filaments of a-synuclein/NAC (non-Ap component) are believed important in the pathogenesis and as therapeutic targets. New agents or compounds able to inhibit a-synuclein and/or NAC formation, deposition, accumulation and/or persistence, or disrupt pre-formed α-synuclein/NAC fibrils (or portions thereof) are regarded as potential therapeutics for the treatment of Parkinson's and related synucleinopathies. NAC is a 35 amino acid fragment of a-synuclein that has the ability to form amyloid-like fibrils either in vitro or as observed in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease. The NAC fragment of α-synuclein is a relative important therapeutic target as this portion of a-synuclein is believed crucial for formation of Lewy bodies as observed in all patients with Parkinson's disease, synucleinopathies and related disorders.<br>
A variety of other human diseases also demonstrate amyloid deposition and usually involve systemic organs (i.e. organs or tissues lying outside the central nervous system), with the amyloid accumulation leading to organ dysfunction or failure. These amyloid diseases (discussed below) leading to marked amyloid accumulation in a number of different organs and tissues, are known as systemic amyloidoses. In other amyloid diseases, single organs may be affected such as the pancreas in 90% of patients with type 2 diabetes. In this type of amyloid disease, the beta-cells in the islets of Langerhans in pancreas are believed to be destroyed by the accumulation of fibrillar amyloid deposits consisting primarily of a protein known as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), Inhibiting or reducing such LAPP amyloid fibril formation, deposition, accumulation and persistence is believed to lead to new effective treatments for type 2 diabetes. In Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and "systemic" amyloid diseases, there is currently no cure or effective treatment, and the patient usually dies within 3 to 10 years from disease onset.<br><br>
The amyloid diseases (amyloidoses) are classified according to the type of amyloid protein present as well as the underlying disease. Amyloid diseases have a number of common characteristics including each amyloid consisting of a unique type of amyloid protein. The amyloid diseases include, but are not limited to, the amyloid associated with Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis of the Dutch type, dementia pugilistica, inclusion body myositosis (Askanas et al,Ann. Neurol 43:521-560, 1993) and mild cognitive impairment (where the specific amyloid is referred to as beta-amyloid protein or Ap), the amyloid associated with chronic inflammation, various forms of malignancy and Familial Mediterranean Fever (where the specific amyloid is referred to as AA amyloid or inflammation-associated amyloidosis), the amyloid associated with multiple myeloma and other B-cell dyscrasias (where the specific amyloid is referred to as AL amyloid), the amyloid associated with type 2 diabetes (where the specific amyloid protein is referred to as amylin or islet amyloid polypeptide or IAPP), the amyloid associated with the prion diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome, kuru and animal scrapie (where the specific amyloid is referred to as PrP amyloid), the amyloid associated with long-term hemodialysis and carpal tunnel syndrome (where the specific amyloid is referred to as α2-microglobulin amyloid), the amyloid associated with senile cardiac amyloidosis and Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy (where the specific amyloid is referred to as transthyretin or prealbumin), and the amyloid associated with endocrine tumors such as medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (where the specific amyloid is referred to as variants of procalcitonin). In addition, the a-synuclein protein which forms amyloid-like fibrils, and is Congo red and Thioflavin S positive (specific stains used to detect amyloid fibrillar deposits), is found as part of Lewy bodies in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease (Lewy in Handbuch der Neurologie, M. Lewandowski, ed., Springer, Berlin pp. 920-933, 1912; Pollanen et al, J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol. 52:183-191, 1993; Spillantini et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA_95:6469-6473, 1998; Arai et al, Neuroscl Lett. 259:83-86, 1999), multiple system atrophy (Wakabayashi et al, Acta Neuropath. 96:445-452, 1998), dementia with Lewy bodies, and the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease. For purposes<br><br>
of this disclosure, Parkinson's disease, due to the fact that fibrils develop in the brains of patients with this disease (which are Congo red and Thioflavin S positive, and which contain predominant beta-pleated sheet secondary structure), is now regarded as a disease that also displays the characteristics of an amyloid-like disease.<br>
Systemic amyloidoses which include the amyloid associated with chronic inflammation, various fomrs of malignancy and familial Mediterranean fever (i.e. AA amyloid or inflammation-associated amyloidosis) (Benson and Cohen, Arth. Rheum. 22:36-42, 1979; Kamei et ah Ada Path. Jpn. 32:123-133, 1982; McAdam et al., Lancet 2:572-573,1975; Metaxas, Kidney Int. 20:676-685, 1981), and the amyloid associated with multiple myeloma and other B-cell dyscrasias (i.e. AL amyloid) (Harada et al., J. Histochem. Cytochem. 19:1-15,1971), as examples, are known to involve amyloid deposition in a variety of different organs and tissues generally lying outside the central nervous system. Amyloid deposition in these diseases may occur, foT example, in liver, heart, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, skin, and/or lungs (Johnson et al, N. Engl J. Med. 321:513-518,1989). For most of these amyloidoses, there is no apparent cure or effective treatment and the consequences of amyloid deposition can be detrimental to the patient. For example, amyloid deposition in the kidney may lead to renal failure, whereas amyloid deposition in the heart may lead to heart failure. For these patients, amyloid accumulation in systemic organs leads to eventual death generally within 3-5 years. Other amyloidoses may affect a single organ or tissue such as observed with the Aβ amyloid deposits found in the brains of . patients with Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome: the PrP amyloid deposits found in the brains of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstrnann-Straussler syndrome, and kuru; the islet amyloid (IAPP) deposits found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas of 90% of patients with type 2 diabetes (Johnson et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:513-518, 1989; Lab. Invest. 66:522 535, 1992); the a2-microglobulin amyloid deposits in the medial nerve leading to carpal tunnel syndrome as observed in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis (Geyjo et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 129:701-706, 1985; Kidney Int. 30:385-390, 1986); the prealbumin/transthyretin amyloid observed in the hearts of patients with senile cardiac amyloid; and the prealbumin/transthyretin amyloid observed in peripheral<br><br>
nerves of patients who have familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (Skinner and Cohen, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 99:1326-1332, 1981; Saraiva et al, J. Lab. Clin.Med. 102:590-603, 1983;J. Clin. Invest. 74:104-119, 1984; Tawara et al, 1 Lab. Clin. Med 98:811-822, 1989).<br>
Alzheimer's disease also puts a heavy economic burden on society. A recent study estimated that the cost of caring for one Alzheimer's disease patient with severe cognitive impairments at home or in a nursing home, is more than $47,000 per year (A Guide to Understanding Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders). For a disease that can span from 2 to 20 years, the overall cost of Alzheimer's disease to families and to society is staggering. The annual economic toll of Alzheimer's disease in the United States in terms of health care expenses and lost wages of both patients and their caregivers is estimated at $80 to $100 billion (2003 Progress Report on Alzheimer 's Disease).<br>
Amyloid as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease<br>
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition and accumulation of a  . 39-43 amino acid peptide termed the beta-amyloid protein, Ap or p/A4 (Glenner and Wong, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 120:885-890, 1984; Masters et al., Proa Natl Acad Set USA 82:4245-4249, 1985; Husby et al., Bull WHO 71:105-108, 1993). Ap is derived by protease cleavage from larger precursor proteins termed p-amyloid precursor proteins (APPs) of which there are several alternatively spliced variants. The most abundant forms of the APPs include proteins consisting of 695, 751 and 770 amino acids (Tanzi et al., Nature 31:528-530,1988).<br>
The small Aβ peptide is a major component that makes up the amyloid deposits of "plaques" in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In addition, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of numerous neurofibrillary "tangles", consisting of paired helical filaments which abnormally accumulate in the neuronal cytoplasm (Grundke-Iqbal et al., Proc. Natl Acad. ScL USA 83:4913-4917, 1986; Kosik et al., Proc. Natl Acad. ScL USA 83:4044-4048, 1986; Lee et al., Science 251:675-678, 1991). The pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is therefore the presence of "plaques" and "tangles", with amyloid being deposited in the central core of the plaques. The other major type of lesion found in the Alzheimer's disease<br><br>
brain is the accumulation of amyloid in the walls of blood vessels, both within the brain parenchyma and in the walls of meningeal vessels that lie outside the brain. The amyloid deposits localized to the walls of blood vessels are referred to as cerebrovascular amyloid or congophilic angiopathy (Mandybur, J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol 45:79-90, 1986; Pardridge etal.,y. Neurochem. 49:1394-1401, 1987)<br>
For many years there has been an ongoing scientific debate as to the importance of "amyloid" in Alzheimer's disease, and whether the "plaques" and "tangles" characteristic of this disease were a cause or merely a consequence of the disease. Within the last few years, studies now indicate that amyloid is indeed a causative factor for Alzheimer's disease and should not be regarded as merely an innocent bystander. The Alzheimer's Aβ protein in cell culture has been shown to cause degeneration of nerve cells within short periods of time (Pike et al., Br. Res. 563:311-314, 1991; J. Neurochem. 64:253-265, 1995). Studies suggest that it is the fibrillar structure (consisting of a predominant P-pIeated sheet secondary structure), characteristic of all amyloids, that is responsible for the neurotoxic effects. Aβ has also been found to be neurotoxic in slice cultures of hippocampus (Harrigan et al., Neurobiol Aging 16:779-789, 1995) and induces nerve cell death in transgenic mice (Games et ah, Nature 373:523-527, 1995; Hsiao et al., Science 274:99-102, 1996). Injection of the Alzheimer's Ap into rat brain also causes memory impairment and neuronal dysfunction (Flood et al., Proa Natl Acad ScL USA 88:3363-3366, 1991; Br,Res. 663:271-276,1994).<br>
Probably, the most convincing evidence that Aβ amyloid is directly involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease comes from genetic studies. It was discovered that the production of Ap can result from mutations in the gene encoding, its precursor, p-amyloid precursor protein (Van Broeckhoven et al., Science 248:1120-1122, 1990; Muirell et al., Science 254:97-99, 1991; Haass et al., Nature Med. 1:1291-1296, 1995). The identification of mutations in the beta-amyloid precursor protein gene that cause early onset familial Alzheimer's disease is the strongest argument that amyloid is central to the pathogenetic process underlying this disease. Four reported disease-causing mutations have been discovered which demonstrate the importance of Aβ in causing familial Alzheimer's disease (reviewed<br><br>
in Hardy, Nature Genet. 1:233-234, 1992). All of these studies suggest that providing<br>
a drug to reduce, eliminate or prevent fibrillar Ap formation, deposition, accumulation<br>
and/or persistence in the brains of human patients will serve as an effective<br>
therapeutic.<br>
Parkinson's Disease and Synucleinopathies<br>
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by the presence of intracytoplasmic Lewy bodies (Lewy in Handbuch der Neurologie, M. Lewandowski, ed.,  Springer, Berlin, pp. 920-933, 1912; Pollanen et al., J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol. 52:183-191, 1993), the major components of which are filaments consisting of a-synuclein (Spillantini et al., Proc. NatL Acad. Set USA 95:6469-6473, 1998; Arai et al., NeuroscL Lett. 259:83-86,1999), an 140-amino acid . protein (Ueda et al., Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA 90:11282-11286, 1993). Two dominant mutations in a-synuclein causing familial early onset Parkinson's disease have been described suggesting that Lewy bodies contribute mechanistically to the degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's disease and related disorders (Polymeropoulos et al., Science 276:2045-2047, 1997; Kruger et al., Nature Genet 18:106-108, 1998). Recently, in vitro studies have demonstrated that recombinant a-synuclein can indeed form Lewy body-like fibrils (Conway et al., Nature Med. 4:1318-1320, 1998; Hashimoto et al., Brain Res. 799:301-306,1998; Nahri et al., J. Biol Chem. 274:9843-9846, 1999). Most importantly, both Parkinson's disease-linked a-synuclein mutations accelerate this aggregation process, demonstrating that such in vitro studies may have relevance for Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Alpha-synuclein aggregation and fibril formation fulfills of the criteria of a nucleation-dependent polymerization process (Wood et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:19509-19512, 1999). In this regard a-synuclein fibril formation resembles that of Alzheimer's P-amyloid protein (Ap) fibrils. Alpha-synuclein recombinant protein, and non-Ap component (known as NAC), which is a 35-amino acid peptide fragment of a-synuclein, both have the ability to form fibrils when incubated at 37°C, and are positive with amyloid stains such as Congo red (demonstrating a red/green birefringence when viewed under polarized light) and Thioflavin S (demonstrating<br><br>
positive fluorescence) (Hashimoto et al., Brain Res. 799:301-306, 1998; Ueda et al., Proc. Nad. Acad. ScL USA 90:11282-11286, 1993).<br>
Synucleins are a family of small, presynaptic neuronal proteins composed of α-, β-, and  γ-synucleins, of which only a-synuclein aggregates have been associated with several neurological diseases (Ian et al., Clinical Neurosc. Res. 1:445-455, 2001; Trojanowski and Lee, Neurotoxicology 23:457-460, 2002). The role of synucleins (and in particular, alpha-synuclein) in the etiology of a number of neurodegenerative and/or amyloid diseases has developed from several observations. Pathologically, synuclein was identified as a major component of Lewy bodies, the hallmark inclusions of Parkinson's disease, and a fragment thereof was isolated from amyloid plaques of a different neurological disease, Alzheimer's disease. Biochemically, recombinant a-synuclein was shown to form amyloid-like fibrils that recapitulated the ultrastructural features of alpha-synuclein isolated from patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. Additionally, the identification of mutations within the synuclein gene, albeit in rare cases of familial Parkinson's disease, demonstrated an unequivocal link between synuclein pathology and neurodegenerative diseases. The common involvement of a-synuclein in a spectrum of diseases such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy and the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease has led to the classification of these diseases under the umbrella term of "synucleinopathies".<br>
Parkinson's disease a-synuclein fibrils, like the Ap fibrils of Alzheimer's disease, also consist of a predominantly P-pleated sheet structure. Therefore, compounds found to inhibit Alzheimer's disease Ap amyloid fibril formation are also anticipated to be effective in the inhibition of a-synuclein/NAC fibril formation, as shown from Examples provided herein. These compounds would therefore also serve as therapeutics for Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, in addition to having efficacy as a therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and other amyloid disorders.<br>
Discovery and identification of new compounds or agents as potential therapeutics to arrest amyloid formation, deposition, accumulation and/or persistence<br><br>
that occurs in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, type II diabetes, and other<br>
amyloidoses are desperately sought.<br>

As used herein, a prodrug is a compound that, upon in vivo administration, is metabolized by one or more steps or processes or otherwise converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, the pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated by metabolic processes. The prodrug may be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, those of skill in this art, once a<br><br>
pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of the compound (see, e.g., Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392).<br>
It is to be understood that the compounds provided herein may contain chiral centers. Such chiral centers may be of either the (R) or (S) configuration, or may be a mixture thereof. Thus, the compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, or be stereoisomeric or diastereomeric mixtures. In the case of amino acid residues, such residues may be of either the L- or D-form. The configuration for naturally occurring amino acid residues is generally L. When not specified the residue is the L form. As used herein, the term "amino acid" refers to a-amino acids which are racemic, or of either the D- or L-configuration. The designation "d" preceding an amino acid designation (e.g., dAla, dSer, dVal, etc.) refers to the D-isomer of the amino acid. The designation "dl" preceding an amino acid designation (e.g., dlPip) refers to a mixture of the L- and D-isomers of the amino acid. It is to be understood that the chiral centers of the compounds provided herein may undergo epimerization in vivo. As such, one of skill in the art will recognize that administration of a compound in its (R) form is equivalent, for compounds that undergo epimerization in vivo, to administration of the compound in its (S) form.<br>
As used herein, substantially pure means sufficiently homogeneous to appear free of readily detectable impurities as determined by standard methods of analysis, such as thin layer chromatography (TLC), gel electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS), used by those of skill in the art to assess such purity, or sufficiently pure such that further purification would not detectably alter the physical and chemical properties, such as enzymatic and biological activities, of the substance. Methods for purification of the compounds to produce substantially chemically pure compounds are known to those of skill in the art. A substantially chemically pure compound may, however, be a mixture of stereoisomers. In such instances, further purification might increase the specific activity of the compound.<br>

The compounds provided herein can be used as such, be administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from inorganic or organic acids, or used in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. The salts can be prepared either in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds provided herein or separately by reacting the acidic or basic drug substance with a suitable base or acid respectively. Typical salts derived from organic or inorganic acids salts include, but are not limited to hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, bisulfate, gluconate, fumarate, hydroiodide, lactate, maleate, oxalate, palmitoate, pectinate, succinate, tartrate, phosphate, glutamate, and bicarbonate. Typical salts derived from organic or inorganic bases include, but are not limited to lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, monoalkylammonium such as meglumine, dialkylammonium, trialkylammonium, and tetralkylammonium.<br>
In certain embodiments, the compositions contain a compound provided herein that is at least substantially pure. In general "pure" means better than 95% pure, and "substantially pure" means a compound synthesized such that the compound, as made as available for consideration into a therapeutic dosage, has only those impurities that can not readily nor reasonably be removed by conventional purification processes.<br>
The mode of administration of the pharmaceutical compositions can be oral, rectal, intravenous, intramuscular, intracisternal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, bucal,<br><br>
subcutaneous, intrasternal, nasal, or topical. The compositions can also be delivered at the target site through a catheter, an intracoronary stent (a tubular device composed of a fine wire mesh), a biodegradable polymer, or biological carriers including, but are not limited to antibodies, biotin-avidin complexes, and the like. Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound provided herein include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers or propellants. Opthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also provided herein.<br>
Actual dosage levels of active ingredients and the mode of administration of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be varied in order to achieve the effective therapeutic response for a particular patient. The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" of the compound provided herein means a sufficient amount of the compound to treat disorders, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the provided will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The total daily dose of the compounds provided herein may range from about 0.0001 to about 1000 mg/kg/day. For purposes of oral administration, doses can be in the range from about 0.001 to about 5 mg/kg/day. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration; consequently, single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; medical history of the patient, activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient, the time of administration, route of administration, the duration of the treatment, rate of excretion of the specific compound employed, drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and the like.<br>
The compounds provided can be formulated together with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, adjuvants, and antibacterial and<br><br>
antifungal agents such as parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to decrease the rate of absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by suspending crystalline or amorphous drug substance in a vehicle having poor water solubility such as oils. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Prolonged absorption of an injectable pharmaceutical form can be achieved by the use of absorption delaying agents such as aluminum monostearate or gelatin.<br>
The compound provided herein can be administered enterally or parenterally in solid or liquid forms. Compositions suitable for parenteral injection may comprise physiologically acceptable, isotonic sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions, or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, glycerol, and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, and suitable mixtures thereof. These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances.<br>
The compounds provided herein can also be administered by injection or infusion, either subcutaneously or intravenously, or intramuscularly, or intrasternally, or intranasally, or by infusion techniques in the form of sterile injectable or oleaginous suspension. The compound may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions. These suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing of wetting agents and suspending agents that have been described above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a<br><br>
sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oils may be conventionally employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Dosage regimens can be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided dosages may be administered daily or the dosage may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or (a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; (b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; (c) humectants such as glycerol; (d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; (e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; (f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay and (i)<br><br>
lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Tablets contain the compound in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, maize starch or alginic acid; binding agents, for example, maize starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate or stearic acid or tale. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol distearate may be employed. Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the compound is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>

The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, or one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the compound in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents, such as those set forth below, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent and<br><br>
one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already described above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and agents, may also be present.<br>
The compounds provided herein may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oils, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsion may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example, glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
In one embodiment, the compounds are formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each containing a therapeutically effective quantity of the compound and at least one pharmaceutical excipient. A drug product will comprise a dosage unit form within a container that is labeled or accompanied by a label indicating the intended method of treatment, such as the treatment of an amyloid disease, for example an amyloidosis such as Alzheimer's disease or a disease associated with α-synuclein/NAC fibril formation such as Parkinson's disease. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds provided herein with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
Compounds provided herein can also be administered in the form of liposomes. Methods to form liposomes are known in the art (Prescott, Ed., Methods in<br><br>
Cell Biology 1976, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y.) As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals which are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound provided herein, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients and the like. The preferred lipids are natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins).<br>
The compounds provided herein can also be administered in the form of a 'prodrug' wherein the active pharmaceutical ingredients, represented by Formulas 1-3, are released in vivo upon contact with hydrolytic enzymes such as esterases and phophatases in the body. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs" as used herein represents those prodrugs of the compounds provided herein, which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella (Higuchi, T. and Stella, V. Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, V. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; Edward B. Roche, Ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design 1987, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compounds provided herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, may also be formulated to be targeted to a particular tissue, receptor, or other area of the body of the subject to be treated. Many such targeting methods are well known to those of skill in the art. All such targeting methods are contemplated herein for use in the instant compositions. For non-limiting examples of targeting methods, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,316,652, 6,274,552,6,271,359, 6,253,872, 6,139,865, 6,131,570, 6,120,751, 6,071,495, 6,060,082, 6,048,736, 6,039,975, 6,004,534, 5,985,307, 5,972,366, 5,900,252, 5,840,674, 5,759,542 and 5,709,874.<br>
In one embodiment, liposomal suspensions, including tissue-targeted liposomes, such as tumor-targeted liposomes, may also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These may be prepared according to methods<br><br>
known to those skilled in the art. For example, liposome formulations may be prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811. Briefly, liposomes such as multilamellar vesicles (MLV's) may be formed by drying down egg phosphatidyl choline and brain phosphatidyl serine (7:3 molar ratio) on the inside of a flask. A solution of a compound provided herein in phosphate buffered saline lacking divalent cations (PBS) is added and the flask shaken until the lipid film is dispersed. The resulting vesicles are washed to remove unencapsulated compound, pelleted by centrifiigation, and then resuspended in PBS,<br>
Article of Manufacture<br>
The compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives may be packaged as articles of manufacture containing packaging material, a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof provided herein, which is effective for treatment, prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms of amyloidosis and synuclein diseases, within the packaging material, and a label that indicates that the compound or composition, or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, is used for treatment, prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms of amyloidosis and synuclein diseases.<br>
The articles of manufacture provided herein contain packaging materials. Packaging materials for use in packaging pharmaceutical products are well known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,323,907, 5,052,558 and 5,033,252, Examples of pharmaceutical packaging materials include, but are not limited to, blister packs, bottles, tubes, inhalers, pumps, bags, vials, containers, syringes, bottles, and any packaging material suitable for a selected formulation and intended mode of administration and treatment. A wide array of formulations of the compounds and compositions provided herein are contemplated as are a variety of treatments for amyloidosis and synuclein diseases.<br>
Sustained Release Formulations<br>
Also provided are sustained release formulations to deliver the compounds to the desired target (i.e. brain or systemic organs) at high circulating levels (between 10" 9 and 10-4 M). In a certain embodiment for the treatment of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, the circulating levels of the compounds is maintained up to 10-7 M. The levels<br><br>
are either circulating in the patient systemically, or in one embodiment, present in brain tissue, and in a another embodiments, localized to the amyloid or α-synuclein fibril deposits in brain or other tissues.<br>
It is understood that the compound levels are maintained over a certain period of time as is desired and can be easily determined by one skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the administration of a sustained release formulation is effected so that a constant level of therapeutic compound is maintained between 10-8   and 10-6  M between 48 to 96 hours in the sera.<br>
Such sustained and/or timed release formulations may be made by sustained release means of delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as those described in US Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,5365809; 3, 598,123; 4,008,719; 4,710,384; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556 and 5,733,566, the disclosures of which are each incorporated herein by reference. These pharmaceutical compositions can be used to provide slow or sustained release of one or more of the active compounds using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or the like. Suitable sustained release formulations known to those skilled in the art, including those described herein, may be readily selected for use with the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein. Thus, single unit dosage forms, suitable for oral administration, such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, powders and the like, that are adapted for sustained release are contemplated herein.<br>
In one embodiment, the sustained release formulation contains active compound such as, but not limited to, microcrystalline cellulose, maltodextrin, ethylcellulose, and magnesium stearate. As described above, all known methods for encapsulation which are compatible with properties of the disclosed compounds are contemplated herein. The sustained release formulation is encapsulated by coating particles or granules of the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein with varying thickness of slowly soluble polymers or by microencapsulation. In one embodiment, the sustained release formulation is encapsulated with a coating material of varying<br><br>
thickness (e.g. about 1 micron to 200 microns) that allow the dissolution of the pharmaceutical composition about 48 hours to about 72 hours after administration to a mammal. In another embodiment, the coating material is a food-approved additive.<br>
In another embodiment, the sustained release formulation is a matrix dissolution device that is prepared by compressing the drug with a slowly soluble polymer carrier into a tablet. In one embodiment, the coated particles have a size range between about 0.1 to about 300 microns, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,710,384 and 5,354,556, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Each of the particles is in the form of a micromatrix, with the active ingredient uniformly distributed throughout the polymer.<br>
Sustained release formulations such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,710,384, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, having a relatively high percentage of plasticizer in the coating in order to permit sufficient flexibility to prevent substantial breakage during compression are disclosed. The specific amount of plasticizer varies depending on the nature of the coating and the particular plasticizer used. The amount may be readily determined empirically by testing the release characteristics of the tablets formed. If the medicament is released too quickly, then more plasticizer is used. Release characteristics are also a function of the thickness of the coating. When substantial amounts of plasticizer are used, the sustained release capacity of the coating diminishes. Thus, the thickness of the coating may be increased slightly to make up for an increase in the amount of plasticizer. Generally, the plasticizer in such an embodiment will be present in an amount of about 15 to 30 % of the sustained release material in the coating, in one embodiment 20 to 25 %, and the amount of coating will be from 10 to 25% of the weight of the active material, and in another embodiment, 15 to 20 % of the weight of active material. Any conventional pharmaceutically acceptable plasticizer may be incorporated into the coating.<br>
The compounds provided herein can be formulated as a sustained and/or timed release formulation. All sustained release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-sustained counterparts. Ideally, the use of an optimally designed sustained release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or<br><br>
control the condition. Advantages of sustained release formulations may include: 1) extended activity of the composition, 2) reduced dosage frequency, and 3) increased patient compliance. In addition, sustained release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the composition, and thus can affect the occurrence of side effects.<br>
The sustained release formulations provided herein are designed to initially release an amount of the therapeutic composition that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of compositions to maintain this level of therapeutic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level in the body, the therapeutic composition must be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the composition being metabolized and excreted from the body.<br>
The sustained release of an active ingredient may be stimulated by various inducers, for example pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.<br>
Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound. In one embodiment, the compounds are formulated as controlled release powders of discrete microparticles that can be readily formulated in liquid form. The sustained release powder comprises particles containing an active ingredient and optionally, an excipient with at least one non-toxic polymer.<br>
The powder can be dispersed or suspended in a liquid vehicle and will maintain its sustained release characteristics for a useful period of time. These dispersions or suspensions have both chemical stability and stability in terms of dissolution rate. The powder may contain an excipient comprising a polymer, which may be soluble, insoluble, permeable, impermeable, or biodegradable. The polymers may be polymers or copolymers. The polymer may be a natural or synthetic polymer. Natural polymers include polypeptides (e.g., zein), polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose), and alginic acid. Representative synthetic polymers include those described, but not limited to, those described in column 3, lines 33-45 of U.S. Patent No. 5,354,556, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Particularly suitable polymers<br><br>
include those described, but not limited to those described in column 3, line 46-column 4, line 8 of U.S. Patent No. 5,354,556 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The sustained release compositions provided herein may be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by intramuscular injections or implants for subcutaneous tissues and various body cavities and transdermal devices. In one embodiment, intramuscular injections are formulated as aqueous or oil suspensions. In an aqueous suspension, the sustained release effect is due to, in part, a reduction in solubility of the active compound upon complexation or a decrease in dissolution rate. A similar approach is taken with oil suspensions and solutions, wherein the release rate of an active compound is determined by partitioning of the active compound out of the oil into the surrounding aqueous medium. Only active compounds which are oil soluble and have the desired partition characteristics are suitable. Oils that may be used for intramuscular injection include, but are not limited to, sesame, olive, arachis, maize, almond, soybean, cottonseed and castor oil.<br>
A highly developed form of drug delivery that imparts sustained release over periods of time ranging from days to years is to implant a drug-bearing polymeric device subcutaneously or in various body cavities. The polymer material used in an implant, which must be biocompatible and nontoxic, include but are not limited to hydrogels, silicones, polyethylenes, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolyrners, or biodegradable polymers. E.       Evaluation of the activity of the compounds<br>
The biological activity of the compounds provided herein as disruptors/inhibitors of Alzheimer's disease p-amyloid protein (Ap) fibrils, type 2 diabetes IAPP fibrils and Parkinson's disease NAC fibrils was assessed by determining the efficacy of the compounds to cause a disassembly/disruption of preformed amyloid fibrils of Alzheimer's disease (i.e. consisting of Ap 1-42 fibrils), IAPP fibrils and Parkinson's disease NAC fibrils. In one study, Thioflavin T fluorometry was used to determine the effects of the compounds, and of EDTA (as a negative control). In this assay Thioflavin T binds specifically to fibrillar amyloid, and this binding produces a fluorescence enhancement at 485 nm that is directly<br><br>
proportional to the amount of fibrils present. The higher the fluorescence, the greater the amount of fibrils present (Naki et al, Lab. Invest. 65:104-110,1991; Levine III, Protein Sci 2:404-410, 1993; Amyloid: Int. J Exp. Clin. Invest 2:1-6, 1995). The disruption of Ap 1-42, even in its monomeric form, was confirmed by a study involving the use of SDS-PAGE and Western blotting methods.<br>
In the Congo red binding assay the ability of a given test compound to alter amyloid (Ap 1-42 fibrils, LAPP fibrils or NAC fibrils) binding to Congo red was quantified. In this assay, Ap 1 -42 fibrils, LAPP fibril or NAC fibrils and test compounds were incubated for 3 days and then vacuum filtered through a 0.2μm filter. The amount of Ap 1-42 fibrils, IAPP fibrils or NAC fibrils retained in the filter was then quantitated following staining of the filter with Congo red. After appropriate washing of the filter, any lowering of the Congo red color on the filter in the presence of the test compound (compared to the Congo red staining of the amyloid protein in the absence of the test compound) was indicative of the test compound's ability to diminish/alter the amount of aggregated and congophilic Ap 1-42 fibrils, IAPP fibrils or NAC fibrils. F.        Combination therapy<br>
In another embodiment, the compounds may be administered in combination, or sequentially, with another therapeutic agent. Such other therapeutic agents include those known for treatment, prevention, or amelioration of one or more symptoms of amyloidosis and synuclein diseases .

Example 15 Compounds provided herein are potent disrupters of Alzheimer's AB 1-42 Fibrils<br>
The compounds prepared in the preceding Examples were found to be potent disrupters/inhibitors of Alzheimer!s disease AB fibrils. In a set of studies, the efficacy of certain compounds provided herein to cause a disassembly/disruption of pre-formed amyloid fibrils of Alzheimer's disease (i.e. consisting of AB 1-42 fibrils) was analyzed.<br><br>
Part A- Thioflavin T Fluorometry Data<br>
In one study, Thioflavin T fluorometry was used to determine the effects of the compounds, and of EDTA (as a negative control). In this assay Thioflavin T binds specifically to fibrillar amyloid, and this binding produces a fluorescence enhancement at 485nm that is directly proportional to the amount of amyloid fibrils formed. The higher the fluorescence, the greater the amount of amyloid fibrils formed (Naki et al., Lab. Invest 65:104-110,1991; Levinem, Protein Sci. 2:404-410,1993;Amyloid:Int. J.Exp.Clin. Invest 2:1-6,1995).<br>
In this study, 25μM of pre-fibrillized AB 1-42 (Bachem Inc) was incubated at 37°C for 3 days, either alone, or in the presence of one of the compounds or EDTA (at Afi:test compound weight ratios of 1:1,1:0.1,1:0.01 or 1:0.001). Following 3 days of co-incubation, 50μl of each incubation mixture was transferred into a 96-well microtiter plate containing 150p,l of distilled water and 50μl of a Thioflavin T solution (i.e. 500mM Thioflavin T in 250mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8). The fluorescence was read at 485nm (444nm excitation wavelength) using an ELISA plate fluorometer after subtraction with buffer alone or compound alone, as blank).<br>
The results of the 3-day incubations are presented below. For example, whereas EDTA caused no significant inhibition/disruption of AB 1-42 fibrils at all concentrations tested, the compounds (DC-0051, DC-0051-S1, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8 and S9) all caused a dose-dependent disruption/disassembly of preformed AB 1-42 fibrils to some extent (Table 1). For example, compound DC-0051-S8 caused a significant (p

(% inhibition of AB; for AB:test compound at given wt/wt ratio)<br><br>
Part B: SDS-PAGE/Western blot data<br>
The disruption of AB 1 -42, even in its monomeric form, was confirmed by a study involving the use of SDS-PAGE and Western blotting methods (not shown). In this latter study, triplicate samples of pre-fibrillized Aβ 1 -42 (25^iM) was incubated at 37°C for 3 days, alone or in the presence of the compounds or EDTA. Five micrograms of each sample<br><br>
was then filtered through a 0.2 μm filter. Protein recovered from the filtrate was then loaded, and ran on a 10-20% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose and detected using an AB-antibody (clone 6E10; Senetek). In this study, Aβ 1-42 was detected as a -4 kilodalton band (i.e. monomeric AB) following incubation alone, or in the presence of EDTA, at 3 days. For example, AB 1-42 monmers were not detected following incubation of AB 1-42 with compounds DC-0051, DC-0051-S1, DC-0051-S5, DC-0051-S8 and DC-0051-S9, correlating nicely with the Thioflavin T fluorometry data (described above) and suggesting that these compounds were capable of causing a disappearance of monomeric AB 1-42. This study confirms that these compounds are also capable of causing a disruption/removal of monomeric AB 1-42. Part C: Congo Red Binding Data<br>
In the Congo red binding assay the ability of a test compound to alter amyloid (in this case, AB) binding to Congo rede is quantified. In this assay, AB 1-42 and test compounds were incubated for 3 days and then vacuum filtered through a 0.2μm filter. The amount of AB 1 -42 retained in the filter was then quantified following staining of the filter with Congo red. After appropriate washing of the filter, any lowering of the Congo red color on the filter in the presence of the test compound (compared to the Congo red staining of the amyloid protein in the absence of the test compound) was indicative of the test compound's ability to diminish/alter the amount of aggregated and congophilic AB. This particular assay appears to be more stringent in character than Thioflavin T fluorometry, and it is more difficult to remove Congo red binding to AB 42 fibrils than assessed by other assays, so the % inhibitions observed even with potent compounds is usually lower than that observed as determined by other assays such as Thioflavin T fluometry.<br>
In one study, the ability of AB fibrils to bind Congo red in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of the compounds or EDTA (at AB:test compound weight ratios of 1:0.001,1:0.01,1:0.1 and 1:1) was determined. The results of the 3-day incubations are presented in Table 2 below. Wheras EDTA caused no significant inhibition of AB 1-42 fibril binding to Congo red, the compounds (DC-0051, DC-0051-S1, S3, S4,S5,S6,S7, S8 and S9) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of AB binding to Congo red (Table 2). For example, compound DC-0051 -S5 caused a significant 82.3+/-0.59% inhibition of Congo red binding to Afl 1-42 fibrils when used at an AB:test compound wt/wt ratio of 1:1, and a<br><br>
40.3+/- 5.81% inhibition when used an an A6:test compound wt/wt ratio of 1:0.1 (Table 2). Other good inhibitors as compared to the Aβ:test compound wt/wt ratio (of 1:0.1 appeared to be DC-0051-S1 (19.747-2.97% inhibition), DC-0051 (40.3+/-5.81% inhibition), DC-0051-S6 (17.1+/- 4.94% inhibition), DC-0051-S8 (19.8+/-2.43% inhibition) and DC-0051-S9 (17.4+/-6.11% inhibition).<br>

In this study, 25μM of pre-fibrillized Aβ 1-42 (Bachem Inc) was incubated at 37°C for 3 days, either alone, or in the presence of one of the compounds (DC-0051-B2, DC-0051-B3 or DC-0051-B4). Following 3 days of co-incubation, 50 μl of each incubation mixture was transferred into a 96-well microtiter plate containing 150μl of distilled water and 50μl of a Thioflavin T solution (i.e. 500mM Thioflavin T in 250mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8).

In this study, 25μM of IAPP (Bachem Inc) was incubated at 37°C for 3 days, either alone, or in the presence of one of the compounds or EDTA (at A6:test compound weight ratios of 1:1,1:0.1,1:0.01 or 1:0.001). Following 3 days of co-incubation, 50μl of each<br><br>

The results of the 3-day incubations are presented in Table 5 below. Wheras EDTA caused no significant inhibition of IAPP fibril binding to Congo red, the compounds pC-0051, DC-0051-S1, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8 and S9) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of IAPP binding to Congo red (Table 5). For example, compound DC-0051-S8 caused a significant 41.0+7-4.15% inhibition of Congo red binding to IAPP fibrils when used at an IAPP:test compound wt/wt ratio of 1:1, and a 26.7+/-0.82% inhibition when used an an IAPP:test compound wt/wt ratio of 1:0.1 (Table 5). Other good inhibitors as compared to the IAPP:test compound wt/wt ratio of 1:0.1 appeared to be DC-0051 (51.+/-0.63% inhibition), DC-0051 -SI (24.1+7-1.99% inhibition), DC-0051-S4 (22.(H-/-0.26% inhibition), and DC-0051-S9 (21.2+/-2.70% inhibition)<br>
