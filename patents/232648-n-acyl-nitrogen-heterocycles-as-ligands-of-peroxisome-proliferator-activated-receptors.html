The starting compounds and intermediates which are converted to the compounds of the invention in a manner described herein, functional groups present, such as amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxy groups, are optionally protected by conventional protecting groups that are common in preparative organic chemistry. Protected amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxy groups are those that can be converted under mild conditions into free amino, thiol, carboxyl and hydroxy groups without the molecular framework being destroyed or other undesired side reactions taking place.<br>
The purpose of introducing protecting groups is to protect the functional groups from undesired reactions with reaction components under the conditions used for carrying out a desired chemical transformation. The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxy! group, amino group, etc.), the structure and stability of the molecule of which the substituent is a part and the reaction conditions.<br>
Well-known protecting groups that meet these conditions and their introduction and removal are described, e.g., in McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London, NY (1973); and Greene and Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., NY (1999).<br>
The above-mentioned reactions are earned out according to standard methods, in the presence or absence of diluent, preferably such as are inert to the reagents and are solvents thereof, of catalysts, condensing or said other agents respectively and/or inert atmospheres, at tow temperatures, RT or elevated temperatures (preferably at or near the boiling point of the solvents used), and at atmospheric or super-atmospheric pressure.

The invention further includes any variant of the present processes, in which an intermediate product obtainable at any stage thereof is used as starting material and the remaining steps are carried out, or in which the starting materials are formed in situ under the reaction conditions, or in which the reaction components are used in the form of their salts or optically pure antipodes.<br>
Compounds of the invention and intermediates can also be converted into each other according to methods generally known per $e.<br><br>
The invention also relates to any novel starting materials and processes for their manufacture.<br>
Depending on the choice of starting materials and methods, the compounds may be in the form of one of the possible isomers or mixtures thereof, for example, as substantially pure geometric (cis or trans) isomers, optical isomers (antipodes), racemates or mixtures thereof. The aforesaid possible isomers or mixtures thereof are within the purview of this invention.<br>
Any resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated on the basis of the physico-chemical differences of the constituents, into the pure geometric or optical isomers, diastereoisomers, racemates, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.<br>
Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, e.g., by separation of the diastereoisomeric salts thereof, obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. The carboxylic acid intermediates can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallization of D- or L-(alpha-methy!benzylamine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, quinine, quinidine, ephedrine, dehydroabietylamine, brucine or strychnine)-salts. Racemic products can also be resolved by chiral chromatography, e.g., high pressure liquid chromatography using a chiral adsorbent.<br>

From the solutions of the latter, the salts may be precipitated with ethers, e.g., diethyl ether. Resulting salts may be converted into the free compounds by treatment with acids. These or other salts can also be used for purification of the compounds obtained.<br>
Compounds of the invention having basic groups can be converted into acid addition salts, especially pharmaceutically acceptable salts. These are formed, for example, with inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, for example, sulfuric acid, a phosphoric or hydrohalic acid; or with organic carboxylic acids, such as (C1-C4)-alkanecarboxylic acids which, for example, are unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, for example, acetic acid, such as saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example, oxalic, succinic, maleic or fumaric acid, such as<br><br>
hydroxy-carboxyfic acids, for example, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, such as amino adds, for example, aspartic or glutamic add; or with organic sulfonic adds, such as (C1-C4)-alkyl-sulfonic adds, for example, methanesulfonic acid; or arylsulfonic adds which are unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by halogen. Preferred are salts formed with hydrochloric add, methanesulfonic acid and maleic acid.<br>

The above-cited properties are demonstrable in vitro and in vivo tests, using advantageously mammals, e.g., mice, rats, dogs, monkeys or isolated organs, tissues and preparations thereof. Said compounds can be applied in vitro in the form of solutions, e.g., preferably aqueous solutions, and in vivo either enteralty, parenterally, advantageously intravenously, e.g., as a suspension or in aqueous solution. The dosage in vitro may range between about<br>
-5	-10<br>
10   molar and 10    molar concentrations. A therapeutically effective amount in vivo may range depending on the route of administration, between about 1 and 500 mg/kg, preferably between about 5 and 100 mg/kg.<br>
The activity of a compound according to the invention can be assessed by the following methods or methods well-described in the art:<br>
The in vitro functional binding to the PPARÎ±, PPARÎ´   and PPARÎ³ receptors is determined as follows:<br>
The functional binding assays for the PPARÎ±, PPARÎ´ and PPARÎ³ receptors are a variation of the coactivator-dependent receptor ligand assay (CARLA) (see Krey et al., "Fatty Acids, Eicosanoids, and Hypolipidemic Agents Identified as Ligands of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors by Coactivator-Dependent Receptor Ligand Assay", Molecular<br><br>
Endocrinology, Vol. 11, pp. 779-791 (1997)). The present CARLA assays use a TR-FRET detection method previously reviewed (see Hemmiia, "LANCE: Homogeneous Assay Platform for HTS"\ J. 8/omo/. Screening, Vol. 4, pp. 303-307 (1999); Mathis, "HTRF Technology", J. Bhmol. Screening, Vol. 4, pp. 309-313 (1999)). All assays included 3 nM of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of either the hPPARa ligand binding domain (LBD) (amino acids 167-468) (GST-hPPARa LBD), GST-hPPAR5 LBD (amino acids 139-442) or GST-hPPARy LBD (amino acids 175-476); 3 nM Eu-labeled anti-GST antibody (Wallac); 30 nM biotinylated steroid receptor coacttvator-1 (SRC-1) peptide (an N-terminal biotinylated peptide, CPSSHSSLTERHKILHRLLQEGSPS, derived from amino acids 676-700 of SRC-1); and 10 nM streptavidin-labelled altophycocyanin (APC; Prozyrne). The binding of a ligand to a PPAR LBD alters the conformation of the LBD and permits the biotinylated SRC-1 peptide to bind. This brings the Eu-labeled anti-GST antibody and the strepavidin-labeled APC in dose proximity, thereby facilitating fluorescence energy transfer. The biotinylated SRC-1 peptide is prepared by standard solid-phase peptide synthetic methods. The GST-PPAR LBDs are expressed in pGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia) in the E. colt strain BL21(DE3) using standard expression conditions at 18Â°C. In some cases the GST-PPAR LBDs are co-expressed with groESL. The GST fusion proteins are purified on glutathione sepharose affinity columns (Amersham Pharmacia) using the method described by the manufacturer. The assay buffer contained 50 rnM Tris pH 7.4, 50 mM KCI, 0.1% BSA and 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol). The assay is earned out in black half area 96-well plates in a final volume of 25 pL. After mixing all components, the reaction mixture stands for 3 hours at RT before reading the TR-FRET (Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) signal on a Wallac Victor 2 plate reader (measuring the ratio of signals at 665 nM and 620 nM). EC50 values are estimated with the Excel add-in program XLFit (ID Business Solutions, Guildford, Surrey, UK) utilizing a 4-parameter logistic equation.<br>
The glucose and insulin lowering activity in vivo can be evaluated as follows:<br>
Adult male C57BL ob/ob mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) at the age of 11 weeks are housed six per cage in a reversed light cycle room (light on from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) and given access to Purina rodent chow and water ad libitum. On day 1, tail blood samples are taken at 8:00 am and plasma glucose levels are determined. The animals are randomLy assigned to the control and compound groups. The means of plasma glucose values of the groups were matched. Animals are then orally dosed with vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl-cellulose with 0.2% Tween-80) or compounds (at 30 mg/kg) in vehicle. The mice are dosed<br><br>
daily for a total of 3 days. On day 4, basal blood samples are taken. The plasma samples are analyzed for glucose concentrations using a YSI2700 Dual Channel Biochemistry Analyzer (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH) and insulin concentrations using an ELISA assay.<br>
illustrative of the invention, the compound of Example 9 demonstrates an EC50 of about 3 nM in the PPARa receptor binding assay and an EC50 of about 1800 nM in the PPARy receptor binding assay.<br>
The following Examples are intended to illustrate the invention and are not to be construed as being limitations thereon. Temperatures are given in degrees Centrigrade. If not mentioned otherwise, all evaporations are performed under reduced pressure, preferably between about 10 and 100 mmHg.
