				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention basically relates to the field of use of improved/modified version of Ball Mill for production of coconuf^eH powder bringing out the unique machinery involved and the process of manufacture of the same from the broken coconut shell Tim invention is a breakthrough after ettensive and successful test/trial runs and being cost effective m the form of threefold increase in the qualitjr and quantity of coa&gt;nut shell powder. The fine fixiished product is used in manufacture of mosquito coils ensuring longer periods of utility.<br>
BACKCatOUHD OP mVBNTION WITH REGARD TO THE DRAWBACKS OP KHOWH ART:<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION:<br>
At present, coconut shell powder is manufactured through Pulverizer or Hammer Mill wherein the quantity and quality of the coconut shell powder is in the order of around 3 tons per day with a wastage of around 30%, for a given set of machinery and inputs.<br>
DRAWBACKS OF EXISTING METTHODS:<br>
The currently available methods of production of coconut shell powder consist of using the broken coconut shell of various sizes and usin^ Pulverizer or Hammer Mill to cany out the grinding to produce coa&gt;nut shell ix&gt;wder. The foUowing are the draw backs in the available method:-<br>
a.	The broken coconut shell (raw material) is not of uniform size and<br>
shape.<br>
b.	When this raw material is put through Pulverizer or Hammer Mill,<br>
uniformity of the finished product is not ensured since the impact<br>
on the raw mat^ial is not adequate to ensure required quantity<br>
and quality of the end product.<br>
c.	Thgre is no reprocess method available while using the Hammer<br>
Mill resulting in loss of production due to excess wastage.<br>
d.	The speed of operation and uniformity of the output are not<br>
correlated resulting in low production per day.<br><br>
e. The coconut shell powder is required to have a fine blending as per the specification of the end user without which the end user/manufecturer will not be in a position to make use of coconut shell powder for manufacture of quality mosquito coils. If a fine blending is not ensured the mosquito coils made there from would not be uniform and the mosquito coil carmot be used for longer hours. This fine blending could not be achieved with this existing method.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingfer it is a primaiy object of the inventron to invent an improved/modified Ball Mill and a novel process for manufacture of high quality imiform coconut shell powder therefix&gt;m.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a cost saving and value added product viz., coconut shell powder using a superior process of manufacture.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a process where the speed of operation is enhanced.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a process where a reprocess is possible.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a process to reduce the wastage in the manufacture of coa&gt;nut shell powder.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a process to increase the output by three times over the existing process.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a procet^ to ensure dust free atmosphere and reduction of the operating temperature.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a process to obtain better yield of coconut ^ell powder.<br>
It is another object of the invention to invent a process, which results in Uniform and fine particles of coconut shell powder.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The novel invention of the improved/modified Ball Mill and unique process of manufacture of coconut shell powder is a result of extensive research, investigation, constant study, meticulous labour and unstinted effort.<br>
It is a unique process which ensures better uniformity in blending and a fine finish to the end product. Vast and extensive trials establish the usefulness of our invention of the improved machinery and process of manufacture in no uncertain terms.<br>
The novel invention consists of manufacture of coconut shell powder using an improved/modified version of Ball Mill instead of a Pulverizer or Hammer MilL<br>
DETAILS OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
The coconut shell, raw materials, are initially taken into a beator box/disintegrator to form broken coconut shell 0 to 4 mm size. This broken coconut shell is sent throu^ the improvised Ball Mill. The inside layer of the improvised Ball Mill is devised in such a way that the chromium iron l^dls in the chamber will have proper impact on the raw material to crush the same into a fine powder. The rotation of the ball mill is caused through bearing/Belt drive. Since the rotation is horisxintal using high speed motor the crushed powder will blend uniformly. An oil circulation system ensures removal of the heat from the improvised Ball MiU supported by white metal bearings on either side. That part of the finished product, which is found not to the requnred standard, is reprocessed ^ain through the improvised Ball MiU. The finished product is passed throu^ a btower motor device, which sucks the fine particles and then blended through a screw conveyer. The end product is screened by using a rotary screen device to produce the required mesh size.<br>
The improved/modified version of the ball mill is described in detail with reference to the enclosed drawings:-<br>
The said ball miH tube (Tube MiU/Horizontal Roller Mill) having 2 or more chambers dependir^ upon the length, is basically cylindrical in shape. TTie said ball mill labeled 1 in the drawing has center diaphragm/chambers labeled 2. The improvised ball mill is provided with inner    lining    plates    marked    3    for    providing    the    impetus    to<br><br>
grind the raw material. The chromium coated iron tells of different sizes are the grinding milium for effective grinding of coconut shell. There is a center open gate in the machinery marked 4. The inner layout of the machinery marked 3 are designed so that iron balls have proper impact on the grinding material. Cono^ete beds marked 5 on either »des ensures resting of the input mouth labeled 6 and the outward mouth labeled 7 m the diagram, A view of the center diaphragm is s^jaratefy depicted as diagram no. 8.<br>
As always, the ball mfll accessories include a girth gear, pinion Wheel and reduction gearbox apart from the blower motor device, screw conveyor and hopper with mesh.<br>
The process by which refined coconut shefl powder <rf e quality is produced with the aid of aforesam improved ball mib enumera.ted herein:-></rf>
Coconut shell, beaten to 0 to 4 mm siae with the help of Beat^-Box/disintegrator is fed in the input device labeled 6 in the diagram. The kmer layer of the improvised Ball Mill labeled 3 are deviced so as to allow the iron balls in the chamber to have proper impact on the coconut sdiell to crush into powder form. The improvised ball mill rotates horizontally to end in fine blended powder of cocxjnut shell. The end product conmut shell powder comes out at outward mouth labeled 7. Some of the fine particles are sucked by a blower and both materials btended and screened using Rotor screen device resulting in mesh of quality required for manufacture of high quahly mosquito coil.<br><br><br>
The invention is described/illustrated in the enclosed flow chart marked Exhibit A,<br>
The drawing 1 describes/ illustrates the effectiveness of the improved/modified Ball Mitt in ensuring better uniformity in blendic^.<br>
Obvious equivalents known to persons skilled in the art are included in the scope of the above description and appended claims.<br>
The illustration/trials mentioned hereinabove are furnished only with a view to understanding the invention elaborately, which is not to be construed to limit the invention to the citations herein.<br><br><br><br>
