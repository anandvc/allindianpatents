Switch disconnector and switchgear assembly with a<br>
switch disconnector<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a switch disconnector as<br>
claimed in the precharacterizing clause of claim 1, and<br>
to a switchgear assembly with the switch disconnector.<br>
A switch disconnector of the type mentioned initially<br>
is known per se and has two enclosure sections, one of<br>
which holds the drive. This drive comprises a pivoting<br>
lever which is driven by means of a driveshaft and on<br>
whose free end a rod-like contact mount is articulated,<br>
with the interposition of a connecting lever. The<br>
moving contact piece, which forms a contact point for<br>
the stationary contact piece, is fitted to the free end<br>
of this rod-like contact mount.<br>
The contact mount is guided within a cylindrical<br>
container, which is extended longitudinally, and the<br>
moving contact piece is separated from the stationary<br>
contact piece during a disconnection operation, with an<br>
arc being struck, which is blown and quenched within<br>
the container. An isolating gap, whose length is<br>
governed by a Standard, is formed between the two<br>
contact pieces in the disconnected position.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide suitable<br>
field control within the isolating gap.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
the features of claim 1.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, the second enclosure<br>
section is fitted with field control rings which<br>
surround it, the first of which is arranged in the area<br>
of the stationary contact piece and the second of which<br><br>
WO 2006/111338	PCT/EP2006/003499<br>
- 2 -<br>
is arranged in the area of the disconnected position of<br>
the moving contact piece. The first field control ring<br>
is connected to the potential of the stationary contact<br>
piece, and the second is connected to the potential of<br>
the moving contact piece in its disconnected position,<br>
in each case via a connecting conductor.<br>
This refinement unifies the electrical field between<br>
the two contact pieces in the disconnected position,<br>
because the electrical potential on the stationary<br>
contact piece is high voltage, and the electrical<br>
potential on the moving contact piece in it is ground.<br>
According to one advantageous refinement, the second<br>
field control ring can be arranged within the isolating<br>
gap located between the two contact pieces, such that<br>
the moving contact piece is located immediately outside<br>
the area between the two field control rings.<br>
In this case, the field control ring can be firmly<br>
adhesively bonded on the outside of the second<br>
enclosure section; however, in this case, it is also<br>
possible for the first field control ring to be<br>
integrally formed at the free end of the outside of a<br>
pot which is placed over the free end of the first<br>
enclosure section. The stationary contact piece is<br>
attached to the base of the pot and the outgoer<br>
conductor from the switch disconnector can be connected<br>
on the outside of the base.<br>
The invention also relates to an electrical switchgear<br>
assembly in which the switch disconnector is installed,<br>
with this switchgear assembly being characterized in<br>
that the second enclosure section is fitted with field<br>
control rings which surround it, the first of which is<br>
arranged in the area of the stationary contact piece<br>
and the second of which is arranged in the area of the<br>
disconnected position of the moving contact piece, and<br><br>
WO 2006/111338	PCT/EP2006/003499<br>
- 3 -<br>
in that the first field control ring is connected to<br>
the potential of the stationary contact piece, and the<br>
second is connected to the potential of the moving<br>
contact piece in its disconnected position, in each<br>
case via a connecting conductor.<br>
Further advantageous refinements and improvements of<br>
the invention can be found in the other dependent<br>
claims.<br>
Further embodiments, improvements and further<br>
advantages will be explained and described in more<br>
detail with reference to the drawing, which illustrates<br>
one exemplary embodiment of the invention, and in<br>
which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section view of a switch<br>
disconnector according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective view of the switch, and<br>
Figure 3 shows a perspective view of a detail of the<br>
enclosure.<br>
A switch disconnector 10 comprises an enclosure 11,<br>
which has two enclosure sections 12, 13, the first of<br>
which contains a drive 14 and the second of which<br>
contains a contact point 15. The drive 14 has a drive<br>
lever 16 which can pivot and interacts in an<br>
interlocking manner with a driveshaft 18 provided with<br>
a profile 17. The profile 17 is a groove profile; it<br>
could also be a polygonal profile or the like. The free<br>
end of the drive lever 16 is connected via a connecting<br>
lever 19 in an articulated manner to a rod-like contact<br>
mount 20, to whose free end a moving contact piece 21<br>
is attached. The moving contact piece 21 interacts with<br>
a stationary contact piece 22. The design and method of<br>
operation are known per se, so that they will not be<br><br>
WO 2006/111338	PCT/EP2006/003499<br>
- 4 -<br>
described in any more detail here other than to say<br>
that the contact point has a main contact point with<br>
contact tulips, via which the current flows in the<br>
connected position, and an arc-resistant additional<br>
contact point, at which an arc is struck during<br>
disconnection or connection, such that the main contact<br>
point is not loaded with arc phenomena.<br>
The second enclosure section is in the form of an<br>
elongated, cylindrical container 23, which' is provided<br>
at one of its ends 24 with a container base 26, which<br>
has an aperture hole 25. The other, free end of the<br>
container 23 has an internal thread 27 on its inner<br>
surface. The first enclosure section 12 is formed from<br>
two enclosure halves, only the enclosure half 28 of<br>
which is illustrated, because the second enclosure half<br>
has been removed in order to make it possible to see<br>
into the first enclosure section. Figure 2 shows the<br>
two enclosure halves 28, 28a.<br>
The center axis of the container 23 runs at right<br>
angles to the longitudinal axis of the driveshaft 18<br>
and a semi-cylindrical collar projection 29 is<br>
integrally formed on each enclosure half 28, which<br>
together form a cylindrical collar, when the two<br>
enclosure halves are joined together, on whose outer<br>
surface an external thread 30 is integrally formed,<br>
onto which the internal thread 27 in the container is<br>
screwed in order to hold the enclosure of the switch<br>
disconnector together.<br>
The container 23 is provided on its outer surface with<br>
field control rings 31, 32, of which the first field<br>
control ring 31 is associated with the stationary<br>
contact piece 22. This first field control ring 31 is<br>
integrally formed from electrically conductive material<br>
at the free end of a pot 33, in that the free end is<br>
axially shaped and is radially extended. The base 34 of<br><br>
WO 2006/111338	PCT/EP2006/003499<br>
- 5 -<br>
the pot 33 is drawn axially outwards and forms a<br>
collar-like axial projection 35 which, being<br>
electrically conductive, comprises a projection 36 on<br>
the stationary contact piece 22, such that the pot 33<br>
is of the same potential as the stationary contact<br>
piece 22.<br>
The second field control ring 32 is a toroidally curved<br>
ring which is open on the inside so as to form two<br>
edges 32a and 32b, which rest on the oute'r surface of<br>
the container 23. The field control ring 32 is located<br>
at the same level as the moving contact piece 21 in the<br>
disconnected state. To be more precise, the moving<br>
contact piece 21 is located outside the area between<br>
the planes which are located distally opposite, touch<br>
the field control rings on the outside, and run at<br>
right angles to the longitudinal axis of the container<br>
23. The field control ring 32 is connected via a<br>
connecting conductor, which cannot be seen, to the same<br>
potential as that on the moving contact piece in the<br>
disconnected state. The field control rings are<br>
therefore at the same potential in the connected state;<br>
in the disconnected state, the field control ring 31 is<br>
at high-voltage potential and the field control ring 32<br>
is at ground potential, so that an electrical field is<br>
produced between the field control rings, which unifies<br>
the electrical load and may prevent discharges.<br>
The switch disconnector is illustrated in its connected<br>
position. When disconnection occurs, the driveshaft 18<br>
is rotated and pivots the drive lever 16 in the<br>
clockwise direction, so that the contact mount 20, and<br>
therefore the moving contact piece 21, are moved away<br>
from the stationary contact piece. Once the arc has<br>
been quenched, the field control rings act in the<br>
manner described above.<br><br>

In order to allow the switch disconnector 10 to be<br>
inserted into a mount in a switchgear assembly, see<br>
also German Patent Application DE 10 2005 009 207.1,<br>
the enclosure has grooves 40, 41, which run on the<br>
outer surfaces of its enclosure halves 28, 28a parallel<br>
to the longitudinal axis of the container 23 and are<br>
inserted into cutouts (not shown) in the mount; in this<br>
context as well see the abovementioned patent<br>
application. In the installed state, that is to say<br>
when the switch disconnector 10 has been installed in a<br>
switchgear assembly, the two enclosure halves are held<br>
together on the one hand by the cutouts and on the<br>
other hand by the first enclosure section.<br>
Figure 3 shows a greatly enlarged illustration of a<br>
detail of the enclosure 10 in the direction of the<br>
arrow III. Two projections 50, 51 are integrally formed<br>
at the free end of the container 23, with one<br>
projection 51 being integrally formed approximately<br>
radially on the container 23 while, in contrast, the<br>
other projection 50 is L-shaped, with a limb 52 which<br>
projects approximately tangentially toward the<br>
projection 51 at a short distance from the container<br>
outer surface, on a plane which runs at right angles to<br>
the longitudinal axis of the container. A distance A<br>
then remains free between the free end of the<br>
projection 50 and the projection 51.<br>
A third projection 53 is integrally formed on the first<br>
enclosure section 12, on the separating plane between<br>
the two enclosure halves 28, 28a, and its width B,<br>
measured at right angles to the separating plane<br>
between the enclosure halves, is greater than the<br>
distance A. The projection 53 projects in the direction<br>
of the container longitudinal axis from the two<br>
enclosure halves, and engages in the area between the<br>
projections 50, 51 when the container is fixed to the<br>
enclosure halves. A recess 54 is provided on the<br><br>
WO 2006/111338	PCT/EP2006/003499<br>
— 7 —<br>
projection 53, behind which the projection 50 engages<br>
"in the installed state, as shown.<br>
The installation process is as follows:<br>
When the container is being screwed on, it is rotated<br>
about its axis in the direction of the arrow U. Shortly<br>
before reaching the final position, an inclined surface<br>
55 on a projection 50 slides on the end surface 56,<br>
which points toward the container outer surface. During<br>
this process, the projection 50 is deformed until the<br>
projection 53 rests against the projection 51. At this<br>
instant, the projection 50 snaps into the recess, so<br>
that the container is latched to the first enclosure<br>
section.<br><br>
