				<td>NEW SYNTHESIS OF SUBSTITUTED HYDROXYMETHYL PHENOLS<br>
Description<br>
Field<br>
Presently described is a process for the preparation of 2-{3-<br>
diisopropylamino-1-phenylpropyl)-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol<br>
which is known as the active metabolite of tolterodine<br>
(hereafter referred to as the "Active Metabolite") and its<br>
phenolic monoesters by a shortened synthetic route via a<br>
Grignard reaction. The target compounds have the following<br>
formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen, a straight or branched C1-C6<br>
alkylcarbonyl group or a phenylcarbonyl group. If R in<br>
formula (I) is hydrogen, the formula represents the Active<br>
Metabolite.<br>
A particular preferred example of the phenolic monoesters of<br>
formula (I) is Fesoterodine which can be chemically defined<br>
as R-(+)-Isobutyric acid 2-{3-diisopropylamino-1-<br>
phenylpropyl)-4-(hydroxymethyl)phenol ester. Fesoterodine is<br>
represented by formula (1a) depicted below.<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula (I), including Che Active Metabolite and<br>
its phenolic monoesters of formula (I) are known from WO<br>
99/058478.<br>
Also described herein is a process for the preparation of<br>
salts of the compounds of formula (I), specifically including<br>
the preparation of salts, of Fesoterodine, and more<br>
particularly the preparation of the hydrogen fumarate salt of<br>
Fesoterodine.<br>
Further disclosed is the preparation of pharmaceutical<br>
formulations containing compounds of formula (I), such as<br>
Fesoterodine, and the preparation of pharmaceutical<br>
formulations containing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of<br>
any of the compounds of formula (I), including, for example,<br>
the hydrogen fumarate or hydrochloride hydrate salts of<br>
Fesoterodine.<br>
Background<br>
In man, normal urinary bladder contractions are mediated, in<br>
part, through cholinergic muscarinic receptor stimulation.<br>
Muscarinic receptors not only mediate, in part, normal<br>
bladder contractions, but also may mediate the main part of<br>
the contractions in the overactive bladder resulting in<br>
symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency and urge urinary<br>
incontinence.<br><br>
After administration of Fesoterodine and other phenolic<br>
monoesters of formula (I) to mammals, such as humans, these<br>
compounds are cleaved by esterases to form the Active<br>
Metabolite within the body. The Active Metabolite is known to<br>
be a potent and competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist<br>
(WO 94/11337). Fesoterodine and other phenolic esters of the<br>
formula (I) thus represent potential prodrugs for the Active<br>
Metabolite. Fesoterodine, in particular, has been shown to be<br>
an effective drug for the treatment of overactive bladder<br>
with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and<br>
urinary frequency, as well as detrusor hyperactivity (as<br>
described in US 6,713,464 and EP-B-1,077,912).<br>
A synthetic approach for the production of the Active<br>
Metabolite and monoesters of the phenolic hydroxy group of<br>
the Active Metabolite such as Fesoterodine has been described<br>
in US 6,713,464 as follows:<br>
In a first step, an ethereal solution is prepared from R-(-)-<br>
[3-(2-benzyloxy-5-bromophenyl)-3-phenylpropyl] -<br>
diisopropylamine, ethyl bromide and magnesium; this solution<br>
is diluted with dry THF and is cooled to -60Â°C.<br>
In a second step, powdered solid carbon dioxide is added in<br>
small portions and the reaction mixture is warmed to room<br>
temperature.<br>
In a third step, the reaction is quenched with an aqueous<br>
solution of ammonium chloride.<br>
In a fourth step, the aqueous phase of the quenched reaction<br>
mixture is adjusted to pH 0.95.<br><br>
In a fifth step, the pH adjusted phase is filtered and R-(-)-<br>
4-benzyloxy-3- (3-diisopropylainino-1-phenylpropyl) -benzoic<br>
acid hydrochloride can be recovered from the solid.<br>
In a sixth step, the resulting purified benzoic acid is<br>
esterified to its corresponding methyl ester. A diagram<br>
summarizing this multi-step synthesis is shown below.<br><br>
US 6,713,464 further describes converting the methyl ester to<br>
the Active Metabolite, and then esterifying the Active<br>
Metabolite to a phenolic monoester, such as Fesoterodine.<br>
WO 94/11337 also describes a multi-stage process to<br>
synthesize the precursor to the Active Metabolite.<br>
These previously described methods for producing the Active<br>
Metabolite require numerous steps that result in complex<br>
purification procedures, time-delay, and enhanced possibility<br>
of human error, thereby prohibiting optimal efficiency and<br><br>
cost-effectiveness. Also, the solid carbon dioxide used in<br>
the art is difficult to handle on large scale due to the need<br>
to work at very low temperatures and to add the crushed dry<br>
ice portion-wise, and due to the difficulties to control the<br>
very exothermic nature of the reaction.<br>
The present disclosure aims to overcome these problems and<br>
disadvantages. It has been found that the use of a di(C1-C6<br>
alkyl)carbonate, preferably dimethylcarbonate, or the use of<br>
a cyclic C1-C6 alkylene carbonate, in the Grignard reaction<br>
results in a highly pure product, while at the same time<br>
eliminating the production of the benzoic acid and the<br>
purification thereof.<br>
The methods disclosed herein are unexpected and are<br>
surprising since current and well-known textbooks teach that<br>
the addition of Grignard reagents to carbonates and other<br>
esters produces tertiary alcohols as a predominant product.<br>
For example, in F.A.Carey, R.J. Sundberg, "Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry", Springer Media, 2001, it is taught that the<br>
addition of Grignard reagents to esters (including<br>
carbonates) is commonly used to produce tertiary alcohols<br>
(pages 447-448) . Likewise, the well-known compendium "March's<br>
Advanced Organic Chemistry", Wilex-Interscience Publication,<br>
John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 5th edition, 2001, page 1214, teaches<br>
that in Grignard reactions "carbonates give tertiary alcohol<br>
in which all three R groups are the same" (page 1214) .<br>
Surprisingly, however, in the presently described method the<br>
reaction of a carbonate with a Grignard reagent, which is<br>
formed after the addition of magnesium and a Grignard<br>
initiator to a compound of formula (II), leads to an alkyl<br>
ester of formula (III) as the predominate product, while the<br>
tertiary alcohol is only formed as a by-product. Typically,<br>
between about 60% and about 7 0% of the direct reaction<br>
products of the presently described Grignard reaction is a<br>
compound of formula (III).<br><br>
Also, it turned out, surprisingly, that the tertiary alcohol<br>
and other impurities formed during the presently described<br>
methods can be easily and very effectively removed during the<br>
crystallisation of the ester of formula (III) in isopropanol.<br>
This was not predictable from the state of the art.<br>
Accordingly, the use of carbonates, such as dimethylcarbonate<br>
or a higher homologue thereof, in the Grignard reaction<br>
allows for a shortened and more cost-effective synthetic<br>
approach to compounds of formula (I) by eliminating the<br>
production of the benzoic acid intermediate and the<br>
purification thereof. Moreover, the current methods are<br>
better suited for a process on large scale than the reaction<br>
requiring solid carbon dioxide that is known from the art.<br>
Moreover, it has been unexpectedly found that the use of<br>
methyl magnesium chloride as the Grignard initiator is<br>
particularly advantageous. The purity of formula (III) after<br>
isopropanol crystallization is typically between about 9 6.1<br>
and 97.4% when methyl magnesium chloride is used to start the<br>
Grignard reaction, whereas the purity of the compound of<br>
formula (III) did not exceed about 94% in three batches<br>
produced with isopropyl magnesium bromide as the Grignard<br>
initiator.<br><br>
Summary<br>
Described herein, is a shortened process for the preparation<br>
of compounds of formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen, a straight or branched C1-C6<br>
alkylcarbonyl group or a phenylcarbonyl group, including the<br>
Active Metabolite and its phenolic monoesters, such as<br>
Fesoterodine and its salts, and more particularly the<br>
hydrogen fumarate salt of Fesoterodine.<br>
The shortened synthesis of compounds of formula (I) can be<br>
characterized by the following steps:<br>
a)	reacting a compound of formula (II)<br><br>
with a mixture of Mg and a Grignard initiator,<br>
preferably in a solvent, to form a Grignard reagent,<br>
b)	optionally, reducing the temperature of the Grignard<br>
reagent to a lower temperature than in step a) and<br><br>
c) reacting the Grignard reagent with a carbonate such<br>
as a di(C1-C6 alkyl)carbonate or a cyclic C1-C6<br>
alkylene carbonate, and preferably with<br>
dimethylcarbonate, to obtain a compound of formula<br>
(III):<br><br>
wherein A is a C1-C6 alkyl, and preferably a methyl<br>
group.<br>
In.the above disclosed method preferably MeMgCl is being used<br>
as the Grignard initiator.<br>
As used in this application, the term "carbonate" includes<br>
di(C1-C6 alkyl) carbonates, such as for example<br>
dimethylcarbonate and diethylcarbonate, as well as cyclic<br>
C1-C6 alkylene carbonates such as ethylene carbonate or<br>
propylene carbonate.<br>
As used in this application, the term "C1-C6 alkyl" refers to<br>
any saturated straight, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon chain<br>
having between one and six carbon atoms.<br>
As used in this application, the term "Grignard initiator"<br>
refers to a compound of the general formula R1MgX, wherein R1<br>
represents C1-C12 alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl,<br>
substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or phenyl(C1-C6)alkyl,<br>
wherein said phenyl may be substituted, e.g. with<br>
(C1-C6)alkyl, (C1-C6)alkoxy or CF3, and wherein X is selected<br>
from bromide, chloride and iodide, R1 is preferably selected<br><br>
from C1-C6 alkyl, vinyl, allyl, propenyl, ethynyl, phenyl or<br>
benzyl, and is more preferably C1-C4 alkyl. Specific examples<br>
of Grignard initiators are isopropyl magnesium bromide,<br>
tertiary butyl magnesium chloride or, particularly<br>
preferably, methyl magnesium chloride.<br>
Also described herein is a shortened process for the<br>
preparation of compounds of formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen, a straight or branched C1-C6<br>
alkylcarbonyl group or a phenylcarbonyl group, including the<br>
Active Metabolite and its phenolic monoesters, such as<br>
Fesoterodine and its salts, and more particularly the<br>
hydrogen fumarate and hydrochloride hydrate salts of<br>
Fesoterodine, wherein said shortened process for the<br>
preparation of compounds of formula (I) can be characterized<br>
by the following steps:<br>
a) combining a compound of formula (II):<br><br>
with Mg and a Grignard initiator, preferably a mixture of Mg<br>
and MeMgCl in a solvent, to form a reaction mixture,<br><br>
b)	optionally, reducing the temperature of the reaction<br>
mixture of step (a) to a lower temperature than in step (a)<br>
and<br>
c)	combining the reaction mixture of step (a) with a<br>
carbonate, preferably a di(C1-C6 alkyl) carbonate or a cyclic<br>
C1-C6 alkylene carbonate, and even more preferably with<br>
dimethylcarbonate, to obtain a compound of formula (III):<br><br>
wherein A is a C1-C6 alkyl, and preferably a methyl group.<br>
Following production, the compound of formula (III) may then<br>
be purified, preferably by crystallization in a suitable<br>
solvent, preferably in isopropanol.<br>
The resultant compound of formula (III) preferably has a<br>
purity of at least about 93%. For example, if isopropyl<br>
magnesium bromide is used as the Grignard initiator, a<br>
typical purity of the compound of formula (III) after<br>
crystallization is between about 93% and about 96%.<br>
More preferably, after the crystallization the compound of<br>
formula (III) has a purity of between about 96% and about<br>
99.5%, for example between about 96.1 and about 97.4%. A<br>
particular preferred Grignard initiator for a Grignard<br>
reaction leading to such a preferred purity is methyl<br>
magnesium chloride.<br><br>
Upon crystallization, the compound of formula (III) may be<br>
further reacted in a known manner to obtain a compound of<br>
formula (I) or a salt thereof. Most of the remaining<br>
impurities, if any, resulting from the Grignard reaction<br>
described herein can be further removed during a work-up<br>
according to the state of the art (e.g. according to US<br>
6,858,650) to yield the Active Metabolite with a purity of<br>
over 99%.<br>
Further described herein are compounds of formula (I) or<br>
formula (III), which are made by any of the processes<br>
disclosed herein. Even further described are pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing compounds of formula (I) or formula<br>
(III), which are made by any of the processes disclosed<br>
herein.<br>
Also described herein is a method of producing compounds of<br>
formula (III) of at least about 93% purity, and more<br>
preferably of at least about 96% to about 99.5% purity, and<br>
more specifically of at least about 96.1% to about 97.4%<br>
purity, by combining a compound of formula (II):<br><br>
with Mg and a Grignard initiator, preferably a mixture of Mg<br>
and MeMgCl in a solvent, and then preferably reacting the<br>
resultant compound with a carbonate as defined further above.<br><br>
Detailed description<br>
The shortened synthesis via a Grignard reaction with a<br>
Grignard initiator (preferably MeMgCl), Mg and a carbonate,<br>
preferably dimethylcarbonate which can be used in the<br>
preparation of the Active Metabolite and its phenolic<br>
monoesters of the type disclosed by formula (I) , such as<br>
Fesoterodine, and more particularly Fesoterodine hydrogen<br>
fumarate, is now described in greater detail with reference<br>
to preferred embodiments.<br>
In step a) of the process according to the present<br>
disclosure, a compound of formula (II)<br><br>
is reacted with a mixture of Mg and a Grignard initiator in a<br>
solvent to form a Grignard reagent.<br>
The molar ratio of the Grignard initiator (e.g. of MeMgCl) to<br>
Mg is preferably between about 1:2 and about 2:1, most<br>
preferably about 1:1, and the molar ratio of each of the<br>
Grignard initiator, and Mg to the compound of formula (II) is<br>
preferably between about 1:1 and about 2:1, most preferably<br>
about 1:1 to about 1.5:1.<br>
In a particular embodiment, all or part of the Mg may be<br>
freshly prepared, for example, by reaction of magnesium<br>
chloride with an alkali metal naphthalide, preferably lithium<br>
naphthalide (so-called Rieke-Mg).<br>
Preferably, step a) can be carried out by:<br><br>
a1) dissolving a compound of formula (II) in a suitable<br>
solvent to form a solution, and<br>
a2) adding said solution to a mixture of MeMgCl and Mg in a<br>
suitable solvent to form a Grignard reagent,<br>
A preferred solvent for dissolving compound (II) in reaction<br>
step al) is toluene although other suitable solvents may be<br>
used, Preferably the water content in the solution containing<br>
compound (II) is not more than about 0.05%.<br>
A preferred solvent for dissolving the Grignard initiator,<br>
preferably MeMgCl, in reaction step a2) is preferably THF,<br>
however other suitable ethers known to those skilled in the<br>
art may be used, including diethylether and tertiary<br>
butylmethylether.<br>
The formation of the Grignard reagent as described in step a)<br>
is preferably carried out in a temperature range of about 40-<br>
55Â°C and most preferably in a temperature range of about 40<br>
to about 50Â°C. The reaction can be conducted under agitation<br>
(e.g. stirring) up to completion.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the Grignard then can be cooled<br>
down to ambient temperature, e.g. to about 20-25Â°C and held,<br>
preferably with agitation, for the next steps of the process.<br>
In step c) the resulting Grignard reagent is reacted with a<br>
suitable carbonate, such as a di(C1-C6 alkyl)carbonate, and<br>
preferably with dimethylcarbonate to obtain the compound of<br>
formula (III) depicted below wherein A is a C1-C6 alkyl, and<br>
preferably a methyl group. An excess of a carbonate,<br>
preferably dimethylcarbonate as compared to a compound of<br>
formula (II) is preferred, with about 1.1-fold to about 50-<br>
fold excess of a carbonate being more preferred, and an about<br>
5 fold to about 50-fold excess being particularly preferable.<br><br><br>
Dimethylcarbonate is the most preferred carbonate.<br>
Other suitable carbonates include di(C1-C6 alkyl) carbonates,<br>
such as for example diethylcarbonate, and cyclic C1-C6<br>
alkylene carbonates, such as ethylene carbonate or propylene<br>
carbonate.<br>
The carbonate may be dissolved in a solvent in step c). A<br>
preferred solvent for use in dissolving the carbonate is<br>
hexane, however, any inert, solvent with a boiling point below<br>
the boiling point of the used carbonate, e.g. the preferred<br>
dimethylcarbonate, and which is capable of forming an<br>
azeotrop with water, including heptane, hexane-isomers and<br>
suitable mixtures thereof, can be used,<br>
A part of the hexane used to dissolve the carbonate,<br>
preferably dimethylcarbonate, may be removed by distillation,<br>
such as azeotropic distillation, before the Grignard reagent<br>
is added. This distillation can remove up to about. 9 0 to<br>
about 95% of the hexane. The solvent distillation also<br>
removes water from the carbonate solvent mixture, which can<br>
minimize the formation of a des-bromo amine impurity when<br>
combined with the Grignard reagent. Preferably, the water<br>
content of the distilled carbonate solvent mixture should be<br>
no more than about 0.1 wt%, and more preferably no more than<br>
about 0.05 wt%, even more preferably no more than about 0,01<br>
wt%.<br><br>
In the most preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the reaction of the Grignard reagent with carbonate,<br>
preferably with dimethylcarbonate, is carried out at a<br>
temperature below about 10Â°C, under agitated conditions.<br>
One preferred option is to add the Grignard reagent (e.g. the<br>
MeMgCl) slowly to the stirring carbonate solvent mixture to<br>
allow for a rapid and homogenous dilution of the formed ester<br>
of formula (III) in the reaction solution. The agitation<br>
speed during the addition and subsequent reaction of the<br>
Grignard reagent with the carbonate is preferably as high as<br>
possible, e.g. at least about 7 5 rpm and preferably at least<br>
about 90 rpm.<br>
Another option is to add the carbonate solvent mixture to the<br>
Grignard reagent, preferably under stirring. The preferred<br>
stirring time is about 2-3 hrs.<br>
Step c) is completed by quenching the reaction mixture with a<br>
suitable reagent, A preferred quenching reagent is aqueous<br>
ammonium chloride, although other quenching agents known to<br>
those skilled in the art may be used, including aqueous<br>
ethylacetate, aqueous sodium chloride or aqueous hydrochloric<br>
acid solution.<br>
Subsequently a solvent exchange from the Grignard solvent<br>
(e.g. toluene and/or THF) to a solvent suitable for the<br>
crystallisation (e.g. isopropanol) is performed.<br>
Isopropanol has been found to be a very effective solvent for<br>
the purification of R-(-)-4-Benzyloxy-3-(3-diisopropylamino-<br>
1-phenylpropyl)-benzoic methylester.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the present invention is<br>
therefore the crystallisation of a compound of formula (III),<br>
and preferably of R-(-)-4-Benzyloxy-3-(3-diisopropylamino-1-<br>
phenylpropyl)-benzoic methylester in isopropanol.<br><br>
Another preferred embodiment is a process for the preparation<br>
of a compound of formula (I) as described further above, or a<br>
salt thereof, characterized in that said process comprises<br>
the step of crystallising a compound of formula (III), and<br>
preferably of R-(-)-4-Benzyloxy-3-(3-diisopropylamino-1-<br>
phenylpropyl)-benzoic methylester, in isopropanol.<br>
Suitable workup steps after the addition of the quenching<br>
reagent are e.g.<br>
-	washing with water;<br>
-	removal of water from organic phase e.g. by azebtropic<br>
drying;<br>
-	removal of organic phase by distillation;<br>
-	crystallisation in isopropanol; and<br>
-	optionally washing in a suitable solvent such as isopropyl<br>
alcohol and drying.<br>
Thereafter a compound of formula (III) can be isolated in<br>
good purity (usually between about 96% and about 99,5%) and<br>
yield.<br>
The process described above is disclosed in more detail in<br>
Example 1 of the experimental part of this application.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention is a<br>
method for the preparation of a compound of formula (I)<br><br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen, a straight or branched C1-C6<br>
alkylcarbonyl group or a phenylcarbonyl group, or a salt<br>
thereof, or a precursor to a compound of formula (I),<br>
comprising the step of crystallising a compound of formula<br>
(III) as defined further above, and preferably of R-(-)-4-<br>

methylester in isopropanol.<br>
The compound of formula (III) can then be further reacted to<br>
obtain a compound of formula (I).<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
is a process for the preparation of the Active Metabolite,<br>
and, if desired, its phenolic monoesters including<br>
particularly Fesoterodine or a salt thereof, preferably a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Fesoterodine, and most<br>
preferably the hydrogen fumarate salt of Fesoterodine, which<br>
process includes the steps of:<br>
a1) dissolving the compound of formula (II) in a solvent,<br>
such as toluene, to form a reaction mixture,<br>
a2) adding said reaction mixture to a mixture of the<br>
Grignard initiator, preferably MeMgCl, Mg and THF to form a<br>
Grignard reagent, wherein the reaction can be performed at a<br>
reaction temperature of about 40Â°C to about 50Â°C,<br><br>
b)	optionally reducing the temperature of the Grignard<br>
reagent to a temperature below the temperature of step a2),<br>
and more preferably in the range of about 20 to about 25Â°C<br>
and maintaining the Grignard reagent at the lower<br>
temperature, optionally under agitation, and<br>
c)	reacting the resulting Grignard reagent with an excess<br>
of carbonate, preferably dimethylcarbonate, in hexane, at a<br>
reaction temperature of below about 10Â°C and at an agitation<br>
speed of at least about 90 rpm, followed by quenching the<br>
thus obtained mixture with an aqueous ammonium chloride<br>
solution to obtain a compound of formula (III). This compound<br>
can then be isolated and purified as described above.<br>
After formation of the compound of formula (III), one option<br>
is to further react the compound of formula (III) to obtain a<br>
compound of formula (I). This can be accomplished, for<br>
example, as follows:<br>
d)	reducing the rnethylester to the corresponding<br>
methylalcohol, and<br><br>
e)	debenzylating the protected alcohol to form the Active<br>
Metabolite mentioned above.<br><br>
Another option is to convert the Active Metabolite to an<br>
ester thereof such as Fesoterodine or a salt of Fesoterodine,<br>
preferably the hydrogen fumarate salt of Fesoterodine, by:<br><br>
Examples of steps d) to g) are disclosed e.g. in US<br>
6,858,650, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The formation of other phenolic monoesters of the Active<br>
Metabolite is possible by using other organic acid halides in<br>
step f) of the above scheme.<br>
The final compound (I) or (Ia) (phenolic monoesters of the<br>
Active Metabolite including Fesoterodine or pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof) can then be formulated in a known<br>
manner to obtain an oral, parenteral, or transdermal<br>
medicament.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a process for the<br>
preparation of a precursor to the compounds of formula (I)<br><br>
including the Active Metabolite or Fesoterodine, comprising<br>
the step of reacting carbonates, such as dimethylcarbonate,<br>
with a Grignard reagent to obtain a compound of formula (III)<br><br>
wherein A is a C1-C6 alkyl group, and<br>
wherein the Grignard reagent is formed by reacting a compound<br>
of formula (II)<br><br>
with a mixture of the Grignard initiator, preferably MeMgCl,<br>
and Mg in a solvent. In this method the compound of formula<br>
(III) can be suitably worked up by the crystallisation in<br>
isopropanol, as described further above.<br>
The present disclosure is further illustrated by the<br>
following non-exhaustive examples. The examples do not intend<br>
to limit the scope of this disclosure as defined in the<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of R-(-)-4-Benzyloxy-3-(3-diisopropylamino-1-<br>
phenylpropyl)-benzoic itiethylester of formula (III)<br>
(a) Stoichiometry MeMgCl:Mg: R-(-)-[3-(2-Benzyloxy-5-<br>
bromophenyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-diisopropylamine = 1.51.5:1.0<br>
A mixture of magnesium (18 kg, 741 mol) and THF (1066 kg) was<br>
charged in a suitable vessel, followed by the addition of<br>
methylmagnesium chloride (3M in THF, 246 kg, 743 mol). The<br>
solution of R-(-)-[3-(2-Benzyloxy-5-bromophenyl)-3-<br>
phenylpropyl]-diisopropylamine (formula (II)), prepared from<br>
486 mol R-(-)-3-(2-Benzyloxy-5-bromophenyl)-3-phenylpropionic<br>
acid by the procedure described in US-B-6,713,464), was then<br>
added, while maintaining a reaction temperature of about 40Â°C<br>
to about 50Â°C. Upon reaction completion the Grignard reagent<br>
of R-(-)-[3-(2-Benzyloxy-5-bromophenyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-<br>
diisopropylamine (formula (II)) was maintained at temperature<br>
of about 20Â°C to about 25Â°C. In a glass lined vessel, an<br>
excess of dimethylcarbonate (1312 kg, 14 kmol) in hexane<br>
(1846 kg) was distilled at atmospheric pressure to a set<br>
volume range of 1200-1260 L and analysed for water content<br>
until a water content of equal to or less than 0.01% (by<br>
weight) was reached. The Grignard reagent was then charged to<br>
the dimethyl carbonate solution, via a filter in order to<br>
remove any residual magnesium, while maintaining the<br>
temperature below 10Â°C. The agitation speed during this<br>
addition and subsequent reaction was &gt;90 rpm.<br>
The mixture of the Grignard reagent and carbonate-solvent was<br>
quenched with aqueous ammonium chloride (660 kg) in a<br>
stainless steel vessel. After agitation the biphasic mixture<br>
was allowed to settle and the layers were separated.<br>
Optionally, an excess of water can be added prior to the<br><br>
phase separation to dissolve Mg salts that can precipitate<br>
during the ammonium hydrogen chloride quench. After the<br>
additional charge of water the layers can be separated, the<br>
aqueous layer extracted with toluene and the organic phases<br>
combined. The organic layer was washed twice with water (2x<br>
600 kg).<br>
The organic phase was distilled to a volume range between<br>
about 1400-1750 L in a stainless steel vessel, and was then<br>
transferred to a glass lined vessel before a solvent exchange<br>
was performed with a charge of isopropanol and distillation<br>
repeated. If required, an additional isopropanol solvent<br>
exchange can be performed. Upon removal of excess<br>
dimethylcarbonate and toluene, the organic solution was<br>
reduced to a volume range of 400 to 800 L.<br>
The mixture was then aged at about 20Â°C to about 25Â°C until<br>
precipitation had occurred, then cooled and aged further at<br>
about 0Â°C to about 5Â°C for a minimum of about 2 hours. The<br>
mixture was then centrifuged to separate the precipitate,<br>
which was then washed with chilled isopropanol (63 kg). The<br>
resulting R-(-)-4-Benzyloxy-3-(3-diisopropylamino-1-<br>
phenylpropyl)-benzoic methylester (formula (III)) was dried<br>
at about 40Â°C to about 50Â°C and was obtained in crystalline<br>
form.<br>
Six batches of R-(-)-4-Benzyloxy-3-(3-diisopropylamino-1-<br>
phenylpropyl)-benzoic methylester prepared with the following<br>
representative purities were:<br>
Batch 1:	96.5%<br>
Batch 2:	97.4%<br>
Batch 3:	96.9%<br>
Batch 4:	96.4%<br>
Batch 5:	96.4%<br>
Batch 5:	96.9%<br>
Batch 6:	96.1%<br><br>
(b) Stoichiometry MeMgCl:Mg: R-(-)-[3-(2-Benzyloxy-5-<br>
brornophenyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-diisopropylamine = 1:1:1<br>
The Grignard was performed as described in (a) , with the only<br>
difference that the stoichiometry changed as indicated above.<br>
As the result R-(-)-4-Benzyloxy-3-(3-diisopropylamino-1-<br>
phenylpropyl)-benzoic methylester was obtained in. a purity of<br>
99,4%.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of R-(+)-[4-Benzyloxy-3-(3-diisopropylamino-1-<br>
phenylpropyl)-phenyl]-methanol (Reduction).<br>
A solution of R-(-)-4-Benzyloxy~3-(3-diisopropylamino-1-<br>
phenylpropyl) -benzoic methylester (28 g) was dissolved in dry<br>
diethyl ether (230 mL). This solution was slowly (about 2 h)<br>
dropped under a nitrogen atmosphere to a suspension of<br>
lithium aluminium hydride (1.8 g) in ether (140 mL) at a<br>
temperature below about 20Â°C. After stirring for about<br>
18 hrs, the reaction was quenched by the addition of water<br>
(4.7 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium<br>
sulphate, filtered and evaporated to dryness to provide<br>
R-(+)-[4-Benzyloxy-3-(3-diisopropylamino-1-phenylpropyl)-<br>
phenyl]-methanol (26 g, 98.9% yield) as an oil which<br>
gradually crystallized.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of R-(+)-2-(3-Diisopropylamino-1-phenylpropyl)-4-<br>
hydroxymethylphenol (Debenzylation)<br>
A solution of R-(+)-[4-Benzyloxy-3-(3-diisopropylamino-1-<br>
phenylpropyl)-phenyl]-methanol (9.1 g) in methanol (100 mL)<br>
was hydrogenated over Raneynickel (4.5 g) under ajnbierit<br>
conditions. After complete hydrogenolysis, as determined by<br>
thin layer chromatography taken at about 4-5 hours, the<br>
catalyst was filtered off and the solution was evaporated to<br>
dryness to leave an oil (6.95 g, 96.5% yield) which was then<br>
dissolved in ethyl acetate. This solution was then washed<br>
with an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (5 wt%).<br>
The organic phase was separated and dried by azeotropic<br>
distillation in ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate solution was<br>
then further distilled to a volume in which 1 part: (by<br>
weight) of R-( + )-2- (3-diisopropylamino-1-phenylpropyl)-4-<br>
hydroxymethylphenol was dissolved in 1.5 part (by volume) of<br>
ethylacetate. This solution was then cooled down to about<br>
-10Â°C and was stirred for about 30-60 min,. R-( + )-2-(3-<br>
diisopropylamino-1-phenylpropyl)-4~hydroxymethylphenol can<br>
then be isolated as the precipitate and can be further washed<br>
with a small volume of cold ethyl actetate.<br><br>
