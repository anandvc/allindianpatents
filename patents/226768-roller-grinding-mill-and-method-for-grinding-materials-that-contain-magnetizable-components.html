				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a roller mill, particularly an air-swept roller mill, and a<br>
method for grinding materials with magnetizable, particularly iron-containing<br>
constituents according to the features of the invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Granulated blast furnace slag is obtained during the production of iron during the<br>
blast furnace process and contains iron particles, which in the milling or grinding<br>
process lead to relatively high wear to the components participating in said<br>
process.<br>
In order to minimize wear, prior to crushing the feedback is supplied to a<br>
magnetic separator, particularly an overbelt magnetic separator. However, this<br>
only removes constituents which are freely exposed and which are not enclosed<br>
by slag. Said constituents pass with the feedstock into the mill.<br>
During the grinding process the iron particles are decomposed and concentrated<br>
as a result of their high specific gravity and poor millability on the grinding pan.<br>
A removal only takes place if said concentrated ircn particles, as a result of<br>
centrifugal force, pass over the grinding pan edge and vane ring into the ring<br>
duct and from their into the external cycle for the so-called "external coarse<br>
particles", where they are separated from the coarse particles by magnetic<br>
separating means.<br>
Swiss patent 103 265 discloses a method for comminuting, crushing or squeezing<br>
out random materials, in which the elements, between the milling material<br>
undergoes the treatment, are pressed against one another with magnetic force.<br>
A description is given of roller mills in which the pressure magnetically produced<br>
between the grinding rollers is intended to reduce bearing pressures and<br>
movable masses. In the presence of magnetic components in the milling<br>
material, the wear phenomena on the grinding rollers are to be eliminated<br>
automatically after they have arisen in that the magnetic components are<br>
attracted to the elevations and comminuted, so that a greater wear occurs there<br>
compared with that in the depressions. For the separation of magnetizable<br>
substances in the milling material, additionally at least one magnetizable<br>
separating roller is located upstream or downstream of the milling or grinding<br>
clearance and cooperates with one of the two grinding rollers.<br>
To reduce the bearing pressures in roller mills, the construction of an annular<br>
magnetic field in the milling pan is proposed. A magnetic field is to be formed by<br>
two concentric ring poles and a field coil. The grinding rollers roll on the upper<br>
ring faces. A separation of magnetizable constituents from the grinding bed and<br>
a removal of said removal of said constituents from the grinding area separate<br>
from the finished material is not intended. The disadvantages of the presence of<br>
iron particles and similar magnetizable substances in the grinding bed and in the<br>
grinding and classifying area can consequently not be avoided.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a roller mill, particularly an air-swept<br>
roller mill, and a method which in an extremely simple and efficient manner and<br>
without interrupting the grinding operation and whilst maintaining the product<br>
quality, ensure a removal of the iron constituents and further metal fractions<br>
from the milling material in the grinding area.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
A fundamental idea of the invention is that magnetizable particles, particularly<br>
iron particles decomposed during comminution and present on the grinding pan<br>
in the grinding area, particularly in the grinding bed, are to be removed with the<br>
aid of at least one electromagnetic device located in the grinding area and a<br>
concentration of such particles on the milling bed is avoided by extracting the<br>
particles, which can in particular take place in a continuous manner.<br>
According to the invention, the electromagnetic device is a roller-like device<br>
rolling on the grinding bed and which is constructed in such a way that the<br>
magnetizable, particularly iron particles of the grinding bed adhere to the<br>
surface. With the aid of a discharge mechanism, which is connected to the rollerlike,<br>
 electromagnetic device and cooperates therewith, the separated,<br>
magnetizable constituents are removed from the roller-like device and<br>
discharged from the sgrinding area. The use of at least one roller-like,<br>
electromagnetic device rolling on the grinding bed is advantageous for a<br>
troublefree, efficient grinding process due to the low frictional resistance and the<br>
simultaneously smoothing and compacting action.<br>
In principle, the electromagnetic device can also be positioned above the<br>
grinding bed and provided with an adjustable gap between the jacket of the<br>
roller-like device and the grinding pan.<br>
In roller mills, which are example used as overflow mills and have no integrated<br>
classifier, a grinding roller, can also be constructed for electromagnetic<br>
separation. Through the removal of the iron particles, which hereinafter is also<br>
understood to cover other magnetizable particles, wear to grinding rollers and<br>
grinding pans in reduced and the service life increased.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to install at least one electromagnetic device in<br>
air-swept roller mills having at least one pair of rollers and in general two or<br>
three pairs of rollers. A pair of rollers comprises a grinding roller, also known as<br>
the master roller, as well as an auxiliary roller, also known as the slave roller and<br>
which is located upstream of the master roller and which prepares the grinding<br>
bec, particularly compacting and rendering the same uniform and which<br>
particularly with hard and brittle materials ensures an optimized, vibration-free<br>
milling.<br>
It is appropriate to construct at least one slave roller for the electromagnetic<br>
separation of magnetizable constituents, particularly iron particles, from the<br>
grinding bed and to connect it to a discharge mechanism with which said<br>
disturbing constituents can be removed from the grinding area.<br>
In an advantageous development the slave roller has a non-magnetic roller<br>
jacket and in the interior regulatable electromagnet, preferably with an iron core<br>
and electrical coils, whose shaping and arrangements are adapted to the roller<br>
shape over a predetermined area of the roller jacket in order to build up an<br>
effective magnetic field. If, considered in circular cross-section, the iron core<br>
extends roughly over an angle between 240 and 270°, the necessary extraction<br>
and adhesion of the particles and the subsequent detachment and removal are<br>
ensured.<br>
The current supply for the electrical coils appropriately takes place in the vicinity<br>
of the rollers axis. In addition, for regulating the electromagnet a thyristor circuit<br>
is advantageously provided.<br>
The discharge mechanism for removing the metal particles separated on the<br>
electromagnetic device and in particular the iron particles is appropriately<br>
constructed in such a way that the separated particles are continuously conveyed<br>
out of the milling area and can example be fed by means of the vane ring into an<br>
area located below the same.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to use a discharge mechanism having a stripper, a<br>
conveyor trough and a downcomer. The stripper can have a ledge-like<br>
construction and appropriately extends at least over the width of the rolling face<br>
of the electromagnetic device, example the jacket of a slave roller. For a<br>
troublefree acceptance of the particles, it is also appropriate for the stripper to<br>
be to be arranged in parallel and at an adjustable distance from the roller jacket<br>
of the electromagnetically constructed slave roller.<br>
Appropriately the stripper is fixed in detachable and/or vertically adjustable<br>
manner to the conveyor trough. In an alternative construction the stripper and<br>
conveyor trough form a unit. The conveyor trough with stripper arranged in the<br>
defined manner are then advantageously fixed in such a way that a height<br>
adjustment and a variation to the gap between the stripper and electromagnetic<br>
roller is possible.<br>
In principle, the stripper and/or conveyor trough can be fixed to the mill casing.<br>
However, for particularly efficient iron separation it is advantageous to fix to the<br>
slave roller with an electromagnet, example in the vicinity of the rocking lever or<br>
roller axis. The stripper and/or conveyor trough then follow the movement of the<br>
slave toller and are moved up and down therewith on the grinding bed.<br>
The conveyor trough appropriately has a gradient in the direction of the opening<br>
in the vane ring, so that the stripped particles are conveyed as a result of gravity<br>
action and, example by means of a downcomer located in an opening in the vane<br>
ring, pass into the ring duct or an area below the vane ring.<br>
To prevent a gas flow from the ring duct in the downcomer, it is appropriate to<br>
close the latter with a regulatable shutoff means. It is example possible to install<br>
a weighted pendulum flap, which in the case of a predetermineable loading is<br>
swung up in the ring duct direction through dropped particles.<br>
The inventive method for milling materials with magnetizable, particularly iron-<br>
containing constituents, example slag, comprises in addition to an<br>
electromagnetic separation prior to the grinding process, a further<br>
electromagnetic: separation takes place in the grinding area of a roller mill,<br>
particularly an air-swept roller mill, in order to extract the particles decomposed<br>
and left free during the grinding process and prevent concentration of said<br>
particles on the grinding pan.<br>
According to the invention electromagnetic separation is carried out in the<br>
grinding area with the aid of a roller-like device, particularly a slave roller. In<br>
addition to the grinding bed preparation, it is possible with at least one-like<br>
electromagnetic device rolling on the grinding bed and example a slave roller<br>
provided with a regulatable electromagnet to bring about an extraction of the<br>
magnetizable particles, particularly iron particles from the grinding bed and<br>
grinding area. A continuous separation on the electromagnetically slave roller can<br>
be performed in a particularly advantageous manner.<br>
The particles separated on the electromagnetically constructed slave roller are<br>
then advantageously stripped with the aid of a corresponding discharge<br>
mechanism, supplied by means of the vane ring to the ring duct of the air-swept<br>
roller mill and discharged from the latter together with the coarse particles<br>
hurled over the grinding pan edge and entering the annular space and are<br>
mechanically conveyed, particularly with a revolving bucket conveyor to the fed<br>
mechanism, example to a weighting belt for the feedstock. In order to separate<br>
the metal particles from the coarse particles, a further metal separation and in<br>
particular an electromagnetic separation takes place. The coarse particles are<br>
then generally returned together with the new feedback to the air-swept roller<br>
mill.<br>
Appropriately the electromagnetic device in the slave roller is regulated by means<br>
of a thyristor circuit and the mill is started up initially in a normal manner, that is<br>
without switching on the electromagnet, and only following the putting into<br>
operation of the control loop for the slave roller speed is the electromagnet<br>
switched on. In principle, the electromagnet can be regulated by means of the<br>
slave roller speed signal.<br>
The advantages of the roller mill or air-swept roller mill according to the<br>
invention and the method according to the invention are that a continuous and a<br>
reguiatable separation of the magnetizable constituents, particularly the iron<br>
particles, can be carried out during the grinding process and removal from the<br>
grinding area can take place without interrupting milling operation.<br>
When using an auxiliary or slave roller the advantage is that essentially existing<br>
component means can be used. As a result of the continuous separation and<br>
discharge from the grinding area and the area below the milling or grinding pan,<br>
there is overall a reduced external cycle and it is possible to make smaller the<br>
plant for the coarse particles to be returned, also known as the reject plant. In<br>
addition, the separated, discharged iron particles are suitable for use as a sand<br>
blasting material. Another important advantage is the avoidance of wear<br>
phenomena on the master rollers, slave rollers and on the grinding path,<br>
together with the repair costs, idle times, etc. associated therewith.<br>
The invention is preferably intended for slag mills and for grinding granulated<br>
blast furnace slag and for use in cement milling plants, where air-swept roller<br>
mills are used for grinding cement clinker, gypsum and granulated blast furnace<br>
slag.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a LOESCHE air-swept roller mill 2, which is more particularly<br>
intended for the grinding of cement and granulated blast furnace slag and which<br>
is equipped with two roller pairs 3,15. In order not to overcomplicate<br>
representation, figure 1 shows two grinding rollers 3, but only one auxiliary roller<br>
15. However, figure 2 shows the two roller pairs, which in each case comprise<br>
one grinding roller or master roller 3 and one auxiliary roller or slave roller 15.<br>
The master rollers 3 and slave rollers 15 roll on a grinding bed, which is formed<br>
by the feedstock on a grinding path of a rotating grinding pan 4. The grinding<br>
pan 4 is rotated by means of a drive 8 and is surrounded by a vane ring 6 by<br>
means of which a gas flow, particularly an air flow flows from a ring duct 7 into<br>
the milling area 5. The feedstock, example blast furnace slag or a mixture of<br>
cement clinker, gypsum and slag, is fed by means of dosing or proportioning<br>
mechanisms, a magnetic separator and a not shown feed mechanism to the air-<br>
swept roller mill, then passes onto the grinding pan 4 and is comminuted<br>
between the resiliency pressed master rollers 3 and grinding pan 4. The air<br>
flowing into the milling area 5 through the vane ring 6 by means of a supply duct<br>
17 and the ring duct 7 conveys the mixture of the fine and coarse material into a<br>
classifying area 13 and into the vicinity of a classifier 9. Coarse material is<br>
rejected and drops back onto the grinding pan 4, whilst fine material is<br>
discharged by means of a fine material discharge 14. Figure 1 also shows the mill<br>
casing 12, the rocking levers 10 of the two master rollers 3 and a hydraulic<br>
cylinder mechanism 11 in the case of the left-hand master roller 3, which brings<br>
about the resilient pressing action of said master rollers 3.<br>
In the embodiment according to figures 1 and 2, the slave rollers 15 have a<br>
smaller diameter than the master rollers 3 and unlike the latter are not subject to<br>
a force and instead rest under their own weight on the milling bed leading to a<br>
purely rolling movement or a rolling movement superimposed by a planned<br>
sliding action. Each slave roller 15 prepares the milling bed for the master roller<br>
3 located behind the slave roller 15 considered in the rotation direction of the<br>
milling pan 4 and this leads to the communication of the milling material.<br>
Reference is made to German patent 39 21 986 regarding the construction,<br>
arrangement and action of the slave rollers.<br>
Figure; 2 shows that the slave roller 15, like the master rollers 3, has a conical<br>
construction and the width roughly corresponds to the grinding path width.<br>
At least one slave roller 15 is constructed for the electromagnetic separation of<br>
magnetizable fractions, particularly iron fractions, from the grinding material to<br>
be comminuted, in order to prevent concentration of said constituents on the<br>
grinding pan 4 and the associated wear to the milling means.<br>
Figure 3 shows in cross-section a slave 15 constructed for electromagnetic<br>
separation. Arrow A indicates the rotation direction of slave roller 15 and arrow B<br>
the direction of the rotating grinding pan 4. The grinding material to be<br>
comminuted or the grinding bed is not shown. The slave roller 15 has a roller<br>
jacket 23 made from nonmagnetic material and is internally provided with an<br>
iror core 21 and electrical coils 22. The iron core 21 is adapted to the conically<br>
constructed roller jacket 23 of the slave roller 15 and, considered in cross-<br>
section, roughly extends over two thirds of the shell surface, so that the metal,<br>
particularly iron particles to be removed, are received from the grinding bed on<br>
the grinding pan 4 and adhering mechanism 30. The discharge mechanism 30<br>
can be seen in figure 4. Figure 3 shows a stripper 31 and a conveyor trough 32<br>
highly diagrammatic form.<br>
The electromagnetic device 2 in the interior of the slave roller 15 has three<br>
electrical coils 22 arranged radially with an angular distance of approximately<br>
120° and together with the iron core 21 form the stationary electromagnet<br>
through which the iron particles on the milling pans are attracted and, adhering<br>
to the rotary roller jacket 23, are passed to a magnet-free area and the<br>
discharge mechanism 30 positioned there.<br>
It s also possible to construct the electromagnetic device 20 and roller jacket 23<br>
as a rotary unit and as a function of the magnetic field strength to so construct<br>
srd position the stripper that a release of particles is ensured.<br>
Figure 4 shows the conically shaped iron core 21 closes to the roller jacket 23 of<br>
the slave roller 15 and the arrangement of the stripper 31 on the conveyor<br>
trough 30. The stripper 31 has a ledge-shaped construction and is fixed to the<br>
conveyor trough 32 in parallel and with a limited spacing from the roller jacket<br>
2:3.<br>
The conveyor trough 32 has a slight gradient in the direction of the mill casing<br>
12 or vane ring 6 and issues into a downcomer 33. The downcomer is located in<br>
an opening 35 of the vane ring 6 and extends up to the ring duct 7. Fixing of the<br>
downcomer 33 can take place by means of fixing elements in the vicinity of<br>
neighbouring vanes of the vane ring 6 or to the mill casing 12. At the lower end<br>
the downcomer 33 is provided with a closing flap 34 constructed as a weighted<br>
pendulum flap.<br>
The magnetized particles and in particular iron particles separated on slave roller<br>
15 are only retained in the vicinity of the iron core 21 and subsequently pass via<br>
stripper 31 into the conveyor through 32, then into the downcomer 33 and ring<br>
duct 7. The coarse material particles not picked up by the master rollers 3 for<br>
comminuting purposes and which have not passed in the air flow to the classifier<br>
9 collect in the ring duct 7 or a space below the milling area.<br>
Together with said coarse particles, the separated iron particles are discharged<br>
from the air-swept roller mill 2 and are generally separated from the coarse<br>
particles on a weighing belt with metal separator, which is supplied again to the<br>
air-swept roller mill together with the new feedstock (not shown).<br>

containing constituents, example slag, in which the feedstock, following<br>
the separation of the magnetizable constituents, particularly iron<br>
constituents, are supplied to an air-swept roller mill and is comminuted<br>
therein.<br>
characterized in that<br>
in the milling area a further electromagnetically separation is carried out,<br>
the magnetizable particles, particularly the iron particles, decomposed<br>
during comminution is separated on a roller-shaped, electromagnetic<br>
device which device continuously rolling on the grinding bed, after which<br>
stripping takes place from the roller-shaped, electromagnetic device,<br>
followed by a discharge from the air-swept roller mill via a vane ring and<br>
an annular space.<br>
15.Method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the magnetizable particles,<br>
particularly the iron particles adhering to the roller-shaped,<br>
electromagnetic device are mechanically stripped and, utilizing the gravity<br>
action, in a conveyor trough are supplied to the annular space.<br>
16. Method as claimed in claim 14 or 15, wherein the magnetizable particles,<br>
particularly iron particles, and the coarse particles passing over the<br>
grinding pan edge into the annular space below the vane ring, are<br>
mechanically discharged from the annular space and conveyed in a<br>
conveyor to the feedstock, before which in an electromagnetic separation<br>
operation the magnetizable particles, particularly are separated and the<br>
remaining coarse particles are supplied for regrinding to the feedstock.<br>
17. Method as claimed in one of the claims 14 to 16, wherein when the roller-<br>
shaped, electromagnetic device is used, a grinding/master roller or an<br>
auxiliary slave roller and the electrical lines are guided in the vicinity of<br>
the roller axis.<br>
18. Method as claimed in one of the claims 14 to 17, wherein the<br>
electromagnetic device is controlled by means of a thyristor circuit.<br>
19. Method as claimed in claim 17 or 18, wherein when a slave roller is used,<br>
the roller mill is initially started and the electromagnetic device is switched<br>
on as a function of the control loop for the slave roller speed.<br>
20. Method as claimed in claim in claim 19, wherein the electromagnetic<br>
device is controlled by means of the slave roller speed signal.<br>
This information relates to a Roller grinding mill, comprising a milling area (5) in<br>
which at least one grinding roller (3) rolls on a grinding path of a grinding pan<br>
(4); and an electromagnetic device (20) for separating magnetizable<br>
constituents, particularly iron particles from the grinding material. The<br>
electromagnetic device (20) has a roller-like construction and rolls on the<br>
grinding bed and in that the electromagnetic device (20) is connected to a<br>
discharge means (30) for removing the separated, magnetizable constituents,<br>
particularly the iron particles from the milling area (5). The invention further<br>
relates to a method for grinding materials that contain magnetizable<br>
components.</td>
