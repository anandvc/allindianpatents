1. -Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a slide fastener slider with an automatic lock mechanism, wherein the slider comprises a body, a pawl member, a spring and a pull tab. The pawl member has a locking pawl at an end thereof, The spring has an intermediate portion to be fixed in a recessed portion inscribed on an upper face of the body, and has one end thereof to be brought into resilient contact with a front end portion of the pawl member, A rear end portion of the pawl member is formed so as to be pivotally movable along a guide lug standing on the body-2. Description of the Related Art.<br>
A conventional slider having an automatic lock mechanism of this type, which comprises a body, a pawl member, a spring, and a pull tab, is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3919745. In the known slider, as shown in FIG. 15, a recessed groove 21' for accommodating a plate spring 3' is inscribed in a guide post 7' of a body 1' of the slider, so that the plate spring 3' can be accommodated in the recessed groove 21' and is fixed by caulking a fixing member 40' thereof mounted in an inner portion of the recessed groove 21' , A tip end of the plate spring 3 ' is brought into resilient<br><br>
contact with an end of a pawl member 2'. The pawl member 2' has at one end portion thereof a locking pawl 26' to be retractably fitted and inserted into a pawl hole 14'. The pawl member 2' further has a support shaft 27' projecting at opposite sides on the other end side portion thereof, which is axially supported on a support lug 10' standing on the body 1'. A pintle 35' of a pull tab 4' is disposed between a projection 11' and the support lug 10' standing on the body 1' so as to make the pawl member 2' move pivotally.<br>
In the above-described slide fastener slider with the automatic lock mechanism shown in FIG. 15, it is the plate spring 3' that activates the pawl member 2 ' having the locking pawl 26' in the automatic lock mechanism. Because the plate spring 3' is mounted to the body 1' by only caulking the fixing member 40' projecting on an upper face of the body 1' , a fixed portion of the spring 3' may be loosened and the spring 3' may fall off if the slider is used for a long time. Or, the spring 3' may not be activated appropriately because of its displacement.<br>
Furthermore, such a slider is not suitable particularly for a slider having the automatic lock mechanism and equipped with a wire spring made of spring steel, because a mounting operation of the spring 3' and an assembling operation of the slider are difficult. Moreover, because a portion for guiding the pivotal movement of the pawl member 2' is the projection<br><br>
11' disposed inside the locking pawl 26', activation of the locking pawl 26' may go wrong.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Embodiments of a slide fastener slider with an automatic lock mechanism according to the present invention will be described in detail below by reference to the drawings . The slide fastener slider with an automatic lock mechanism comprises four members , i ,e. , a body 1, a pawl member 2, a spring 3, and a pull tab 4. The body 1 and the solid pawl member 2 are die-cast molded by using aluminum alloy, zinc alloy, or the like. When the pawl member 2 has a cover body, it is molded by press using metal plate. The pull tab 4 is die-cast molded by using metal or molded by metal plate pressing. For the spring 3, a wire spring or a plate spring made of spring steel is used.<br>
In a slider with an automatic lock mechanism according to a first embodiment of this invention as shown in FIGS, 1 to 5, an upper wing plate 5 and a lower wing plate 6 of the body 1 are connected by a guide post 7 at a front opening side thereof. Side edges of the upper wing plate 5 and the lower wing plate 6 are provided with guide flanges 8 in a bent state for guiding fastener elements. Between the side edges of the upper wing plate 5 and the lower wing plate 6, guide grooves<br><br>
9 into which the fastener elements can be inserted are formed. The body 1 has a pair of plate-shaped support lugs 10 formed to stand on the front opening side of the body 1, i.e. on the guide post 7. The support lugs 10 are disposed with such a distance therebetween that the pawl member 2 can be fitted therein. Each the support lug 10 has at its upper portion a U-shaped bearing portion 12 for axially supporting a support shaft 27 of the pawl member 2.<br>
The body 1 further has a guide lug 11 formed to stand on a rear opening side thereof and comprising opposed side walls 16 and a bridge portion 17 for connecting upper portions of the side walls 16. At a position toward one side wall 16 inside the guide lug 11, a pawl hole 14 is defined such that a locking pawl 26 of the pawl member 2 is retractably fitted and inserted through into the pawl hole 14 and down to the element guide groove 9 of the body 1. The guide lug 11 has an accommodating groove 18 formed at a lower face of the bridge portion 17 and at a position toward an opposite side to the pawl hole 14 for accommodating an end portion of the spring 3 and having substantially the same width as a diameter of the spring 3 as shown in FIG. 6. The accommodating groove 18 is formed by forming a protuberance 19 projecting from the lower face of the bridge portion 17.<br>
A long and narrow recessed portion 13 for accommodating a bent portion 32 of the spring 3 is defined at an intermediate<br><br>
portion between the support lugs 10 and the guide lug 11 of the body 1 on a side which does not face the pawl hole 14, i,e., on a side which faces the accommodating groove 18, A pair of projections 12 are formed to project from opposite sides of the recessed portion 13 and to face each other such that the spring 3 can be fixed by caulking the projections 12.<br>
The pawl member 2 has a substantially inverted V-shaped<br>
o<br>
solid body which can be mounted inside the support lugs 10 and the guide lug 11 respectively disposed on the body 1, The pawl member 2 has at its end a pressing portion 25 for abutting on and pressing the spring 3, and at its the other end the locking pawl 26 which can be inserted between the fastener elements and which project at a deviating position so as to face the pawl hole 14 of the body 1, A curved recess 28 is defined at an inside base portion of the locking pawl 26 such that a pintle 35 of the pull tab 4 is held in the recess 28 • A support shaft 27 to be fitted into the bearing portions 15 projects from side faces of the pawl member 2 at an intermediate position thereof between the recess 28 and the urging portion 25.<br>
The pawl member 2 has a pair of tongue portions 31 each having substantially the same width as the support lugs 10 and the guide lug 11, projecting from opposite sides of a top face above the recess 28 thereof such that the tongue portions<br><br>
31 are interposed between the support lugs 10 and the guide lug 11, thereby maintaining the pawl member 2 in a stable state, and preventing the pull tab 4 from falling sideways, and enabling the pull tab 4 to pivot smoothly. A recessed streak groove 29 for accommodating the spring 3 is inscribed on a lower face of the pawl member 2 below the support shaft 27. The recessed streak groove 29 gives a space for allowing the spring 3 to be resiliently deformed relative to the pawl member 2, as shown in FIG. 4*<br>
The spring 3 is a wire spring made of spring steel bent in a V-shape at a substantially center portion thereof to form a bent portion 32. The bent portion 32 can be fitted into the recessed portion 13 defined on the body 1. The spring 3 is not necessarily a wire spring, but may be a plate spring. The pull tab 4 is in a rectangular shape and has at its end a pintle 35 to be fitted into the recess 28 of the pawl member<br>
The slider having the automatic lock device is assembled by mounting the spring 3 to the body 1 by fitting the bent portion 32 of the spring 3 which is bent into a V shape into the recessed portion 13 inscribed on the upper wing plate 5 of the body 1, and simultaneously caulking the projections 12 formed on opposite sides of the recessed portion 13 in such a manner that an end of the spring 3 is accommodated in the accommodating groove 18 defined in the<br><br>
guide lug 11. In this state, the pintle 35 of the pull tab<br>
4 is disposed between<br>
the support lugs 10 and the guide lug 11, The pawl member<br>
2	is placed over and fitted between the support lugs 10 and in the guide lug 11, At the same time, the locking pawl 26 is retractably fitted and inserted into the pawl hole 14, and the support shaft 27 is fitted into the bearing portions 15 of the support lugs 10. After an end portion of the spring<br>
3	abuts on the pressing portion 25 of the pawl member 2, the support lugs 10 are caulked to fix the pawl member 2 to the body 1, thereby assembling the slider.<br>
When the spring 3 is mounted, it is also possible to dispose a spring 3 in a shape of a straight line on the upper wing plate 5 and then to mold the spring 3 into the V shape by punching in the recessed portion 13, The slider is assembled by an automatic assembling machine.<br>
A operation of the assembled slider with the automatic lock device is as follows. If the pull tab 4 is pulled forward or rearward, the pawl member 2 moves pivotally about the support shaft 27 as a center until the pressing portion 25 abuts on the upper wing plate 5. As an end of the pawl member 2 is guided by the guide lug 11, the locking pawl 26 is pulled up from between the fastener elements, so that the slider can be allowed to freely slide. If the pull tab 4 is released, the pressing portion 25 is pushed up by a resilient force of<br><br>
the spring 3, and the locking pawl 26 projects automatically to be inserted between the fastener elements, thereby locking the slider.<br>
In a slider with an automatic lock mechanism according to a second embodiment of this invention as shown in FIGS. 7 to 11, an angular concave portion 20 is defined on an upper wing plate 5 of the body 1, i.e. , at a center of an upper face of the guide post 7, and a recessed groove 21 in an angular U shape or a U-shape is inscribed extending from the concave portion 20 to a side portion of the pawl hole 14 defined inside the guide lug 11 at a rear opening side. As shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, a depth of the recessed groove 21 gradually decreases from the concave portion 20 to a center of the body 1. A pair of projections 12 are formed to project at opposite sides of a shallowest portion of the recessed groove 21. A recessed portion 13 is defined at an end portion of the recessed groove 21 adjacent to the projections 12* Further, a projecting streak portion 22 is defined at a tip end of the recessed portion 13. Furthermore, a recessed face 23 which is lower than the projecting streak portion 22 is formed inside the guide lug 11 extending from the projecting streak portion 22 to the rear opening of the slider.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the recessed groove 21 is inscribed slightly diagonally in a plan view. In other words, the recessed groove 21 is formed diagonally from a center of the<br><br>
concave portion 20 toward a side portion of the pawl hole 14. Alternatively, the recessed groove 21 may be inscribed in a crank shape to extend longitudinally from the center of the concave portion 20 toward the rear opening of the body 1, and then the recessed groove 21 may be bent at its intermediate portion in a hook shape while forming a right angle so as to avoid the pawl hole 14. If the recessed groove 21 is formed in such a crank shape, a pair of projections 12 are formed to project at the intermediate bent portion on a longitudinal line of the body 1, and the recessed portion 13 is formed between the projections 12.<br>
The upper wing plate 5 has a pair of support lugs 10 standing on opposite sides of the recessed groove 21 on an upper face of the guide post 7. Each the support lugs 10 has at an upper portion thereof a U-shaped bearing portion 15. Further, a guide lug 11 stands to extend from the rear opening side of the upper wing plate 5, i.e., from the recessed portion<br>
13	to the rear opening of the body 1. The guide lug 11<br>
comprises a pair of side walls 16 and a bridge portion 17 for<br>
connecting upper portions of the side walls 16, A pawl hole<br>
14	is defined at a position toward one inner side of the guide<br>
lug 11. The guide lug 11 further has a hooked portion 24 formed<br>
at the bridge portion 17 above the pawl hole 14. Further,<br>
an accommodating groove 18 for preventing rotation or falling<br>
of the spring 3 is defined in the bridge portion 17 above<br><br>
extension of the recessed groove 21. The accommodating groove 18 is formed by forming a protuberance 19 projecting from a lower face of the bridge portion 17 and having substantially the same distance as a diameter of the spring 3 such that an end of the spring 3 can be accommodated in resilient contact with the accommodating groove 18.<br>
