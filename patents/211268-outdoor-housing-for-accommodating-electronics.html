				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to an outdoor housing for<br>
accommodating electronics, in particular components for<br>
telecommunications and data technology, the electronics<br>
being enclosed in a hermetically sealed manner by a first<br>
housing structure, and a second, outer housing structure<br>
being arranged on the first, inner housing structure in<br>
such a manner that a cavity is formed between the housing<br>
structures.<br>
The known outdoor housings for accommodating<br>
electronics can be designed in a hermetically sealed<br>
manner in order to protect the electronics located in the<br>
interior against interfering electromagnetic radiation<br>
and other environmental influences, such as rain.<br>
However, the electronics arranged in the interior of the<br>
outdoor housing produce an electrical power loss, which<br>
is emitted in the form of heat. This heat in turn has<br>
negative effects on the operation of the electronics and<br>
therefore has to be dissipated in some way, despite the<br>
hermetically sealed housing structure. Two alternative<br>
solutions are known for this purpose from the prior art.<br>
On the one hand, double-walled housings are used and, on<br>
the other hand, a second, outer housing is arranged<br>
around the inner housing in such a manner that a cavity<br>
is formed between the housing structures. The principle<br>
of heat dissipation is common to both solutions. The air<br>
flowing through the cavity absorbs part of the heat and<br>
rises upward (chimney effect) . The heated air can be<br>
carried out there via air shafts or gaps. In the event of<br>
external heating, for example by direct solar radiation,<br>
the layer of air furthermore acts as a heat insulator. A<br>
disadvantageous feature of the known outdoor housings is<br>
their lack of flexibility with regard to different<br>
external boundary conditions. For example, if the outer<br>
housing structure is damaged or destroyed, it is<br>
necessary to replace it, entirely or partially. In<br>
addition, because of the continuous increases in<br>
transmission capacities, it is necessary to install new<br>
outdoor housings or to upgrade existing housings.<br>
Repairs, conversion or reinstallation mean that the<br>
previously used inner and outer housing structures, or<br>
the double-walled housings used, cannot be reused because<br>
of damage to them or because of their geometric<br>
dimensions. On the other hand, attention is now being<br>
paid to achieving a harmonious overall aesthetic<br>
appearance in town areas. Outdoor housings, some of whose<br>
colors are completely inappropriate, remain a disturbing<br>
factor. However, if, for example when building a new<br>
estate, the color of the outdoor housings is matched to<br>
the facade color used, the problem is just delayed at the<br>
latest until the next facade renovation.<br>
The invention is thus based on the technical<br>
problem of providing an outdoor housing which is simple<br>
to repair while having the same technical characteristics<br>
and which can be matched to different or changing external <br>
boundary conditions.<br>
The technical problem is solved by the features<br>
of the invention. <br>
of patent claim 1., By designing the outer housing structure <br>
as hollow-section rails, which are detachably<br>
attached to the first, inner housing structure, a cavity,<br>
through which the heat losses that occur can be<br>
dissipated, is formed between the housing structures in<br>
the same way as in the prior art. At the same time, once<br>
built, the outdoor housing can easily be repaired and can<br>
be matched in a flexible manner to changing boundary<br>
conditions. In the event of conversion or upgrading of an<br>
already existing outdoor housing, the hollow-section<br>
rails used can be reused, and additional hollow-section<br>
rails are just arranged on the new, inner housing. Any<br>
required color configurations can be produced very easily<br>
by using colored hollow-section rails. In addition,<br>
assembly of the outdoor housing is simplified since the<br>
hollow-section rails can be handled relatively easily, in<br>
contrast to the previously used, cumbersome housing<br>
structures. Further advantageous refinements of the<br>
preferred features of the invention,<br>
invention result from thepreferred features of the invention<br>
By using the attachment means for the hollow-<br>
section rails in such a manner that they are not accessible <br>
from the outside in the installed state, this avoids<br>
manipulations and vandalism. Any known type of attachment <br>
may be used as the attachment means, the hollow-section<br>
rails preferably being hooked onto the inner housing<br>
structure so that the outer surfaces of the hollow-<br>
section rails do not offer any indication of the attachment. <br>
In a preferred embodiment, the hollow-section rails<br>
are designed as twin rectangular hollow sections, which<br>
have particularly high strength in comparison with<br>
conventional hollow-section rails. Furthermore, the<br>
hollow-section rails can be designed with a holder for<br>
information media, such as advertizing, public transport<br>
schedules or public notices, or else may themselves be<br>
designed as information media. For example, the housing<br>
may be used as a billboard. For design or engineering<br>
reasons, the hollow-section rails may have any required<br>
shape.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail in the<br>
following text with reference to a preferred exemplary<br>
embodiment. In the figures:<br>
Fig.1 shows a perspective illustration of a modular<br>
outdoor housing,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a view of a detail from Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a plan view of the outdoor housing,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a view of a detail from Fig. 3, and<br>
Fig. 5 shows a plan view of a hollow-section rail.<br>
An outdoor housing 1 is illustrated in perspective <br>
in Fig. 1. The outdoor housing 1 comprises three<br>
modules, each of which has its own inner housing 2. The<br>
area which contains the electrical components is arranged<br>
above a base 3, each module preferably being assigned its<br>
own base 3 and an integral base connection being arranged<br>
around the bases. The individual modules are separately<br>
accessible from the outside via doors 5 composed of<br>
hollow-section rails 4,. For clarity, the outdoor housing <br>
1 is illustrated without a roof. As can be seen in<br>
particular from Fig. 2, the hollow-section rails 4 are<br>
arranged abutting the inner housings 2 and are attached<br>
to them, the doors 5 being hinged on adjacent hollow-<br>
section rails 4 or on the inner housing 2 by means of<br>
hinges 6. A cavity is formed between the inner housings <br>
2, which are all hermetically sealed, and the<br>
hollow-section rails 4 which form the outer housing<br>
structure. The heat losses produced in the inner<br>
housings 2 by the electrical components are transmitted<br>
via the outer walls of the inner housing 2 to the air in<br>
the cavity. The heated air rises upward and can leave the<br>
cavity via air shafts or air gaps between the walls and<br>
the roof, so that the heat losses that are produced are<br>
dissipated.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a plan view of the outdoor<br>
housing 1 without a roof, and Fig. 4 illustrates a view<br>
of a detail from Fig. 3. The hinge 6 is attached to the<br>
respective inner housing 2 and passes through a hollow-<br>
section rail 4.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a plan view of a preferred embodiment <br>
of a hollow-section rail 4 as a twin rectangular<br>
hollow section, which gives the outer housing structure<br>
particular strength, and in which case the rectangles 7<br>
may have different geometric dimensions.<br>
