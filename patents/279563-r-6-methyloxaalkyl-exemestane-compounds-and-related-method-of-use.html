				<td>This application claims priority benefit from application serial no. 60/722,204 filed September 30, 2005, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. Background of the Invention,<br>
Abnormal cell proliferation is usually characterized by an increased rate of division and in some cases uncontrolled growth. One example of a proliferative cell disorder is a tumor. In addition to posing a serious health risk in and of themselves, primary malignant tumors are particularly problematic given their tendency to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs in the body. To date, the most frequently used methods for treating neoplasia, especially solid tumor forms of neoplasia, include surgical procedures, radiation therapy, drug therapies, and combinations of the foregoing.<br>
Drug therapy for breast cancer may include the administration of exemestane to a patient. Product information available on-line from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration describes exemestane as an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator. Exemestane (which is sold as Aromasin ®, is chemically described as 6-methylenandrosta-l,4-diene-3,17 -dione. Its molecular formula is C2oH2402 and its structural formula is as follows:<br>
 <br>
Among other things, exemestane lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women thereby providing a treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,808,616, and 4,904,650 describe 6-alkylidenandrosta-1,4-diene-3,l7-dione derivatives, such as exemestane, and methods of making them.  U.S.<br>
 <br>
Patent No. 4,876,045 teaches a method of preparing 6-methylene derivatives of androsta-l,4-diene-3,l7-diones by reacting a 17-hydroxy precursor with formaldehyde and an amine, and then oxidizing the resulting compound. U.S. Patent No. 4,990,635 teaches a process for making 6-methylene derivatives of androsta-l,4-diene-3,17-diones by reacting androsta-3,5-diene-17-one with formaldehyde and an amine, and then dehydrogenating the resulting compound.<br>
The preparation of intermediates that may be useful in preparing exemestane is also described in the literature. In U.S. Patent No. 3,274,176, there is described a process for making 1,3-dipyrrolidyl-A3,5-androstadiene-17-one in which Al,4-androstadiene-3,l7-dione is refluxed with pyrrolidine and the residue is crystallized in methanol to obtain 1,3-dipyrrolidyl-A3,5-androstadiene-17-one. In German patent DD 258820, 6-hydroxymethyl-androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione is prepared from androsta-l,4-diene-3,l7-dione via 1,3-dipyrrolidinoandrosta-3,5-dien-17-one. A solution of 1,3-dipyrrolidinoandrosta-3,5-dien-17-one in benzene-ethanol is stirred with aqueous formaldehyde (HCHO) until the reaction is complete. Co-pending international application no. PCT/US2005/001248 filed January 14, 2005 (PCT Publication Number WO 2005/070951) also describes the preparation of intermediates that are useful in preparing exemestane, such application as is incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety.<br>
The clinical pharmacology in this exemestane product information states that the mechanism of action for breast cancer cell growth may be estrogen-dependent. Aromatase is described as the principal enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens both in pre- and postmenopausal women. It is reported that the principal source of circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the aromatese enzyme. Estrogen deprivation through aromatase inhibition is described as an effective and selective treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Exemestane as an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator is believed to act as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme, and processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme causing its inactivation.    Exemestane lowers circulating<br>
 <br>
estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women thereby providing a treatment for some postmenopausal patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer.<br>
However, a need still exists to identify new and effective agents for treating cancer. Summary of the Invention.<br>

Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments.<br>
In one aspect, this invention provides a method for inhibiting growth of cells of a cancer or a tumor. In such a method, the cells are exposed to or contacted with a compound of Formula (A) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates thereof:<br>
 <br>
wherein each of Ri, R2, R3, and R4, independently, is hydrogen, halogen or alkyl, and R5 is alkyl.<br>
One specific non-limiting example compound of Formula (A) has the Formula (B) below:<br>
 <br>
More specifically, showing various stereochemical relationships, such a compound B can be represented as<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The compound of Formula (B) can be referred to as "6S" or "Exemestane 6S".<br>
Looking at Figure 1, the compound of formula (B) can be prepared by first preparing 1,3-dipyrrolidinoandrosta-3,5-diene-17-one (EX-1) from (+)-androsta-l, 4-diene-3, 17-dione (ADD). One set of conditions utilizes (+)-androsta-l,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD), 12.2 equivalents pyrrolidine, catalytic acetic acid, denatured ethanol (95/5 ethanol/methanol) and 6-7% tetrahydrofuran (volume basis of total volume of ethanol and pyrrolidine) with heating to 3O-4O°C for a minimum of 16 hours. Once the ADD content is less than 3% by HPLC area, becomes static or EX-1 begins to revert to ADD, the reaction mixture is cooled to 5 ± 5°C, collected and washed with cold denatured ethanol. Yields are typically 70 - 80% on a dry basis with purities typically 90 - 95% by HPLC area percent.<br>
Next, 6-hydroxymethyl-androsta-l,4-diene-3,17-dione (EX-2) is prepared from 1,3-dipyrrolidinoandrosta-3,5-diene-17-one (EX-1). One set of conditions for the preparation employ 1 equivalent 1,3-dipyrrolidinoandrosta-3,5-diene-17-one (EX-1) and 2.6 equivalents formalin (formaldehyde) in 10 mL dichloromethane/g of EX-1 at room temperature. Workup consists of acidification of the reaction mixture to a pH of about 2, dilution with 2% sulfuric acid (aqueous, volume/volume basis) and removal of the organic layer which is then washed with 2% sulfuric acid (vol/vol) and 1:1 water/brine. Solvent exchange into toluene (approximately 10 mL/g theory EX-2) is then carried out and the product crystallizes as toluene exchange transpires. The product is collected, washed and dried to provide 6-hydroxymethyl-androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (EX-2) in yields of typically 75 - 80%.   Purity is usually 96% or<br>
 <br>
greater by HPLC area percent. Next, the 6-hydroxymethyl-androsta-l,4-diene-3,17-dione (EX-2) may be treated as shown in Figure 1 to prepare the 6S compound, which is Formula (B) above.<br>
In another aspect of such a method the cells are exposed to a compound of Formula (C) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates thereof:<br>
wherein each of Rls R2, R3, R4, independently, is hydrogen, halogen or alkyl, and R5 is alkyl.<br>
One specific non-limiting example compound of Formula (C) has the Formula (D) below:<br>
 <br>
More specifically showing various stereochemical relationships, such a compound D can be represented as<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The compound of Formula (D) can be referred to as "6R" or "Exemestane 6R". Looking at Figure 2, the compound of formula (D) can be prepared by reacting 6-hydroxymethyl-androsta-l,4-diene-3,l7-dione (EX-2) as shown in Figure 2 to produce exemestane and then reacting the exemestane as shown in Figure 2 to produce the 6R compound, which is Formula (D) above.<br>
To treat an individual/subject, an effective amount of one or more of the present compounds, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, is administered so as to be exposed to or contact cancer cells or a tumor. Effective dosage forms, modes of administration and dosage amounts may be determined empirically, and making such determinations is within the skill of the art. It is understood by those skilled in the art that the dosage amount will vary with the activity of the particular compound employed, course and/or progression of the disease state, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of the treatment, the identity of any other drugs being administered to the subject, age, size and like factors well known in the medical arts. In general, a suitable daily dose will be that amount which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. The total daily dosage will be determined by an attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. If desired, the effective daily dose of such a compound, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable variation or salt thereof, maybe administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses, administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Treatment includes mitigation, as well as elimination, of the disease state.<br>
 <br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered to patient for therapy by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or drops, including buccally and sublingually. The preferred routes of administration are orally and parenterally.<br>
While it is possible for the active ingredient(s) (one or more compounds of this invention and/or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, alone or in combination with another therapeutic agent) to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the active ingredient(s) as a pharmaceutical formulation (composition). The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise the active ingredient(s) in admixture with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and, optionally, with one or more other compounds, drugs or other materials. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. Regardless of the route of administration selected, the active ingredient(s) are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The amount of the active ingredient(s) which will be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration and all of the other factors described above. The amount of the active ingredient(s) which will be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the active ingredient(s) which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect.<br>
Methods of preparing pharmaceutical formulations or compositions include the step of bringing the active ingredient(s) into association with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient(s) into association with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.<br>
 <br>
Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient(s). The active ingredient(s) may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like), the active ingredient(s) is/are mixed with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethyl-cellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and (10) coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent.   Molded tablets<br>
 <br>
may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient(s) moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient(s) therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter. These compositions may also optionally contain opacitying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient(s) can also be in microencapsulated form.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the active ingredient(s) include pharmaceutically-acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient(s), the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents. Suspensions, in addition to the active ingredient(s), may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof<br>
 <br>
Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient(s) with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or salicylate and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active ingredient(s). Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br>
Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of the active ingredient(s) include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active ingredient(s) may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any buffers, or propellants which may be required.<br>
The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to the active ingredient(s), excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the active ingredient(s), excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.<br>
Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of the active ingredient(s) to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving, dispersing or otherwise incorporating the active ingredient(s) in a proper medium, such as an elastomeric matrix material. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the active ingredient(s) across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate-controlling membrane or dispersing the active ingredient(s) in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
 <br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise the active ingredient(s) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, Suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.<br>
Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like in the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the active ingredient(s), it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the active ingredient(s) then depends upon its/their rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of parenterally-administered active ingredient(s) is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the active ingredient(s) in an oil vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the active ingredient(s) in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of the active ingredient(s) to polymer, and the nature of the<br>
 <br>
particular polymer employed, the rate of release of the active ingredient(s) can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the active ingredient(s) in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue. The injectable materials can be sterilized for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter.<br>
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions maybe prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the type described above.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be used in the form of veterinary formulations, including those adapted for the following: (l)oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or nonaqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets, boluses, powders, granules or pellets for admixture with feed stuffs, pastes for application to the tongue; (2) parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension or, when appropriate, by intramammary injection where a suspension or solution is introduced into the udder of the animal via its teat; (3) topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment or spray applied to the skin; or (4) intravaginally, for example, as a pessary, cream or foam. Examples of the Invention.<br>
The following non-limiting examples and data illustrate various aspects and features relating to the compounds, compositions and/or methods of the present invention, including the use of a range of methyloxaaklyl derivatives of exemestane, as are available through the synthetic methodologies described herein. In comparison with the prior art, the present compounds, compositions and/or methods provide results and data which are surprising, unexpected and contrary thereto. While the utility of this invention is illustrated through the use of several compounds and moieties incorporated therein,  it will understood be those skilled in the art that<br>
 <br>
comparable results are obtainable with various other compounds, compositions and related methods, as are commensurate with the scope of this invention. Example 1<br>
Activity Of 6-Methyloxamethyl Exemestane Compounds Against Cancer Cell Lines. Cancer-derived cell lines were used for the following growth inhibition assay. The ability of the compound of Formula (B) above and the compound of Formula (D) above to inhibit cancer-derived cell growth was compared to exemestane as a control. Cell viability is determined using the MTS assay. This colorimetric procedure measures conversion of the MTS reagent (a tetrazoleum salt) to formazan by living cells. Formazan production is quantified by spectrophotometric measurement at 490 nm and is proportional to viable cell number. Cells are cultured and treated. Following treatment, 100 µl of growth medium is removed and cells incubated with 2Oµl CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Reagent (l.9mg/ml in PBS, pH 6.0) for 1-3 hours at 37°C. Absorbance (OD) values are measured using a µQuant microplate reader at a single wavelength of 490 nm. The data were measured as the 50% inhibitory dose (IC50) and are reported in Table 1 below.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
v..<br>
Additional assays were performed to evaluate the growth-inhibiting activity of the compound of Formula (B) above and the compound of Formula (D) compared to exemestane as a control. The percent of cell growth inhibited at a dose of 200 µM is reported in Table 2 below.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
The compound of Formula (B) (6S) demonstrates excellent activity against a variety of cancer cell lines (95-98% inhibition - see Table 2). By comparison, the exemestane (control) shows marginal activity against the same cell lines. In addition, under the conditions and protocols employed, the data consistently shows that Formula (B) (exemestane 6S) works best against cell lines that are estrogen(-) and/or aromatase (+), as compared to cell lines that are estrogen (+) and aromatase (-).<br>
Thus, the 6-methylene substituted exemestane coumpounds described herein have been discovered to be able to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. This indicates that the exemestane derivatives described herein are useful for cancer treatments and therapies when provided to a patient either individually or in various combinations with each other or with other compounds which have anticancer or antitumor activity. In light of the ability of the exemestane derivatives described herein to inhibit various types of cancer cells, exemestane derivatives described herein are useful as antitumor or antiproliferative agents for cancer chemotherapeutic applications.<br>
