				<td>Construction kit and method for creating an electrical<br>
cabinet for outdoor use<br>
I. Field of application<br>
The invention relates to an electrical cabinet which is generally set up outdoors<br>
and receives the distribution equipment for low-current systems, for example<br>
telephone systems, with associated power supply devices and cable<br>
terminating/connecting devices for a specific spatial area.<br>
II. Technical background<br>
Electrical cabinets of this type must satisfy various conditions, since they must<br>
help to meet the operating conditions, in particular the temperature, of the<br>
electrical components, in particular the electronic components, accommodated in<br>
them, since they are used in different states/regions, and various technical<br>
specifications or standards from the respective operators exist and have to be<br>
complied with, or because certain special climatic conditions exist in the intended<br>
region and have to be taken into account.<br>
In addition, general requirements, such as adequate structural stability and<br>
resistance to vandalism etc., must be satisfied.<br>
Electrical cabinets of this type are, in principle, produced either from metal or from<br>
plastic or from both materials, plastic combining the advantage of allowing cheaper<br>
production with the advantage of lower weight and an electrically nonconducting<br>
material.<br>
In addition, there is the problem that electrical cabinets of this type are not<br>
installed on the bare ground, but on or against what are known as base boxes,<br>
which are buried entirely or partly in the ground and serve for leading out the<br>
buried cables from the underlying ground.<br>
Apart from the different dimensioning of these base boxes and the different<br>
heights to which they rise up (upper edge level with the surface of the ground or<br>
projecting above it), there are also different requirements with regard to the<br>
interaction with base boxes of this type: in one case, the electrical cabinet is<br>
intended to rest on the base box, in the other case the base box is not to be<br>
visible, that is to say the electrical cabinet is intended to encase the base box on<br>
the sides and at the top.<br>
This is intended in particular to help to avoid underground engineering work, to the<br>
extent that base boxes of an earlier, obsolete type of construction do not have to<br>
be exchanged for new bases made to match the electrical boxes [sic].<br>
To avoid a separate electrical cabinet having to be designed and constructed<br>
according to prevailing boundary conditions, the object of the invention is to<br>
provide such a construction kit and a method for creating electrical cabinets which<br>
permits adaptation to the various boundary conditions with only a few individual<br>
parts.<br>
The various construction and installation variants which are to be achieved are as<br>
follows:<br>
- Mounting the electrical cabinet on the upper side of a base box ending level<br>
with the ground,<br>
Receiving a base box rising up from the surface in the lower region of the<br>
electrical cabinet, it being received at least in the outer body of the electrical<br>
cabinet, better in the interior of the installation frame,<br>
- Partitioning off the receiving space, that is to say the space within the<br>
installation frame, from the intermediate space, that is to say the distance<br>
between the installation frame and the outwardly surrounding outer body; in<br>
this case, a distinction must be made between the partitioning off to the sides<br>
and the partitioning off at the top,<br>
- Arrangement of the predetermined breaking elements between the base box<br>
and the electrical cabinet or within the multi-part base box,<br>
Fitting out the outer body with or without an upper intermediate part between<br>
the cover and the parts of the body lying thereunder,<br>
- Fitting out the electrical cabinet with or without EMC shielding.<br>
Furthermore, it is also known from DE 73 19 283 U, as the closest prior art, to<br>
fasten the installation frame of an electrical cabinet in such a way that it can be<br>
adjusted in height with respect to the underlying ground. However, this does not<br>
take place by fastening at different positions of the installation frame, and nor is it<br>
the case that differently dimensioned base boxes and base boxes rising up to<br>
different heights are provided there.<br>
On the other hand, FR 2 785 100 shows different installation heights of the base<br>
on the electrical cabinet, the electrical cabinet not having an installation frame in<br>
this case.<br>
DE 296 23 678 U1 also shows the use of different base boxes, even though, when<br>
a plurality of base boxes are used there, altogether the same overall dimensions of<br>
the bases, seen in plan view, are always achieved.<br>
In addition, DE 295 19 260 U shows a double-walled switch cabinet with a<br>
distance between the outer skin and the inner skin of the switch cabinet and air<br>
circulation taking place in between.<br>
DD 39 240 A shows an electrical cabinet with an inner installation frame<br>
comprising profiles, with venting openings between its outer paneling and its<br>
cover.<br>
In addition, DE 32 05 934 shows a bottom panel, which can be made up from a<br>
plurality of elements, for an electrical cabinet.<br>
III. Summary of the invention<br>
a) Technical object<br>
It is therefore the object according to the invention to provide a construction kit for<br>
creating an electrical cabinet which can optionally satisfy different specifications<br>
with regard to base area and projection of the base above the surface of the<br>
ground and also with regard to EMC shielding and ventilation and venting.<br>
b) Solution achieving the object<br>
This object is achieved by the defining features of claims 1 and 24. Advantageous<br>
embodiments emerge from the subclaims.<br>
To be able to fasten the electrical cabinet on base boxes rising up to different<br>
heights above the surface of the ground, in particular also on base boxes ending<br>
level with the surface of the ground, that is to say not rising up above it, the<br>
mounting plates, which establish the connection between the installation frame<br>
and the base box, can be arranged at different fastening positions of the<br>
installation frame. These fastening positions differ firstly with regard to the height<br>
on the installation frame, since they can be arranged either on the lower cross<br>
struts of the installation frame [lacuna]. In this case, the electrical cabinet later<br>
rests on the upper side of the base box. In the case of a base box ending level<br>
with the ground, that is to say more or less on the surface of the ground, in the<br>
case of a base box rising up above the surface of the ground the electrical cabinet<br>
would extend upward from the upper edge of the base box.<br>
Furthermore, the different base boxes differ in their width, that is to say in the<br>
transverse direction, the large base area dimensioning, considered also in depth,<br>
the smaller base area dimensioning.<br>
Since specifically the dimensioning of the depth varies greatly, the clear, inner<br>
width of the installation frame, within which the base box is to be accommodated,<br>
does not have to be dimensioned according to the greatest depth of the base<br>
boxes, but instead the installation frame may be designed to be somewhat less<br>
deep in comparison, in that one of the lower cross struts of the installation frame is<br>
removable, that is to say in the case of very deep base boxes the thickness of the<br>
cross strut is also included in order for the base box then still to be accommodated<br>
within the outer body of the electrical cabinet but no longer completely within the<br>
installation frame. Although the stability of the installation frame is reduced as a<br>
result, it still lies within the acceptable limits, in particular also on account of the<br>
fact that, between the upper and lower cross struts, there are, for stiffening<br>
purposes, middle cross struts in the transverse direction between the vertical<br>
edges and the vertical struts present there of the installation frame. It is preferred,<br>
however, for the installation frame, considered in plan view, to run around the base<br>
box, that is to say both cross struts are also present.<br>
These cross struts are arranged at a height of the remaining installation frame that<br>
corresponds to the height of the upper edge of the base box - in the case of base<br>
boxes rising up above the surface of the ground.<br>
The mounting plates are then fastened to these cross struts by screwing, and,<br>
after the installation frame has been mounted on the base box, these mounting<br>
plates, which extend from the front cross strut to the rear cross strut, are fastened<br>
on the upper side of the base box.<br>
The spacing of the mounting plates depends on the width of the base box, so that<br>
the mounting plates are fastened near the outer ends of the upper side of the base<br>
box, in order to achieve a good supporting effect.<br>
If a base box which does not rise up above the surface of the ground, or only<br>
slightly, is concerned, or if the electrical cabinet is to rest on the upper side of the<br>
base box, these mounting plates are fastened to the lower cross struts.<br>
Furthermore, a distinction has to be made according to whether the receiving<br>
space in the interior of the installation frame is to be thermally separated from the<br>
surrounding intermediate space between the installation frame and the outer body,<br>
that is to say with regard to air circulation and/or with regard to electromagnetic<br>
radiation. For a thermal separation, the inner installation frame 6 [sic] is paneled<br>
with sheet-like, closed panels, preferably on the outer side of the installation frame<br>
or on the inner side of the latter. This takes place on the rear side and the side<br>
walls. The front wall, in which the outer body generally has one or more doors for<br>
opening the electrical cabinet, must also be fitted out with analogous elements to<br>
be opened, that is to say doors or flaps etc., with regard to such paneling on the<br>
inner installation frame.<br>
Furthermore, a distinction has to be made according to whether or not this inner<br>
receiving space is also to be thermally separated at the upper side, that is to say<br>
at the upper end of the installation frame, by a closed panel from the cover space<br>
lying thereabove of the surrounding body. In this case, paneling of the upper side<br>
of the inner installation frame is also necessary. This may take place by means of<br>
a separate paneling part or else by mounting an intermediate part between the<br>
cover of the outer body and the rest of the body, provided that this intermediate<br>
part has a continuous lower panel and, in spite of the fastening to the remaining<br>
parts of the outer body, can be mounted snugly on the upper side of the inner<br>
installation frame.<br>
This must be ensured by the connecting elements used for the purpose of<br>
fastening the outer body to the inner installation frame allowing this intermediate<br>
part to be mounted on the upper side of the installation frame.<br>
The outer body generally comprises panel-shaped individual parts for the<br>
individual walls and additionally, on the front side, one or more doors which can be<br>
moved with respect to the front panel, and also a separate upper cover.<br>
The outer body, in particular its panel-shaped individual parts, generally consist of<br>
plastic, in particular, to improve the insulation, of foamed plastic, in particular<br>
foamed polycarbonate.<br>
In addition, the construction kit may also comprise an outer body and, in particular,<br>
panel-shaped individual parts of such an outer body made of metal, in particular<br>
sheet steel or sheet aluminum.<br>
In this case, the outer body has inlet openings in the lower region for letting the<br>
ambient air into the intermediate space. Outflow openings are present between<br>
the cover and the rest of the outer body or in the upper intermediate part, it being<br>
necessary for flowing of the air rising up in the intermediate space - on account of<br>
heating up caused by solar radiation on the outer side of the parts of the body -<br>
from the intermediate space into the upper intermediate part to be made possible<br>
by lead-through openings.<br>
The lower inlet openings may also be realized by a distance which serves for<br>
allowing the air to enter the intermediate space existing between the lower end of<br>
the walls of the outer body and the ground.<br>
Consequently, a number of thermal circulation models can be realized: if the inner<br>
receiving space is separated laterally and at the top from the surrounding<br>
intermediate space, an air circulation taking place exclusively in this inner<br>
installation space is established - initiated by the waste heat of the active electrical<br>
elements arranged in the inner receiving space, such as lost heat of the control<br>
electronics etc. Heat is extracted from this circulation, in that the circulation heats<br>
up the paneling of the installation frame, and this paneling is cooled in that, on the<br>
outside, in the intermediate space between the paneling of the installation frame<br>
and the outer body, air from the ambience flows in at the bottom and flows out<br>
again at the top, possibly via the upper intermediate part and possibly by means of<br>
active cooling by the intermediate part (a fan which accelerates the circulation<br>
between the outer body and the inner, paneled installation frame partitioned off<br>
from the intermediate space with respect to the outer body, or a heat exchanger or<br>
cooling element in the paneling of the inner installation frame, in particular the<br>
upper termination of the latter, although the partitioning off between the inner<br>
installation space and the outer intermediate space between the paneled<br>
installation frame and the body is to be retained).<br>
If the inner receiving space is only partitioned off at the sides from the intermediate<br>
space by means of paneling, this inner circulation also includes the cover space,<br>
that is to say the space between the cover of the outer body and the remaining<br>
parts of the body. In general, however, the installation frame is also paneled at the<br>
top and is consequently partitioned off both at the top and at the sides, and<br>
consequently completely, from the outer intermediate space, that is to say the<br>
space between the paneling of the installation frame and the surrounding body.<br>
The procedure during the installation of the electrical cabinet on the base box may<br>
also vary:<br>
If the electrical cabinet is not intended to enclose the base box, but merely to rise<br>
up from the upper side of the latter, simple mounting - firstly of the installation<br>
frame - is self-evident, it generally been the case that the outer body and/or the<br>
interior fitting out of the installation frame, including the subrack, only takes place<br>
subsequently.<br>
If, on the other hand, the electrical cabinet is intended to enclose the base box<br>
projecting above the surface of the ground, different procedures are possible:<br>
If the buried cables, which can only be bent with difficulty, protrude out above the<br>
upper side of the base box, it is preferred for the electrical cabinet, that is to say<br>
firstly its installation frame, to be slipped over the base box from above.<br>
If, however - which is not generally the case - the base box is larger in terms of<br>
base area than the clear interior space of the installation frame, this is not<br>
possible.<br>
It is then appropriate for the installation frame to be pushed horizontally over the<br>
upwardly projecting part of the base box, it being necessary for this purpose for<br>
one of the lower cross struts of the installation frame first to be detached from the<br>
latter and also to remain removed if the base area of the base box is greater than<br>
the clear interior space between the fitted lower cross struts of the installation<br>
frame.<br>
If an existing base box, projecting above the surface of the ground, still does not<br>
comprise predetermined breaking elements between the part of the base box<br>
projecting out of the ground and the part located in the ground, such<br>
predetermined breaking elements must be provided when the electrical cabinet is<br>
fastened to the base box, for example between the mounting plates and the base<br>
box.<br>
c) Exemplary embodiments<br>
Embodiments according to the invention are described in more detail below by<br>
way of example and with reference to the figures, in which:<br>
figure 1 shows basic representations of the installation versions in section,<br>
figure 2 shows thermal circulations in the electrical cabinet in section,<br>
figures 3 show individual views of the installation state without an outer body,<br>
figures 4 show individual views according to figures 3 with an outer body,<br>
figure 5 shows a perspective view of the state of figure 3,<br>
figure 6 shows the perspective view in a further-advanced installation state,<br>
figure 7 shows a perspective view of the partly installed switch cabinet on a<br>
base according to figure 1 b and<br>
figure 8 shows a perspective view of the switch cabinet according to figure 7<br>
after complete installation.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show electrical cabinets 1, considered with a viewing direction into<br>
the depth 40 of these electrical cabinets, in each case cut open along the<br>
transverse direction 20, the direction of greatest horizontal extent of these<br>
electrical cabinets.<br>
Figure 1a shows the installation diagram of a base box 2a with a superstructure.<br>
This base box 2a rises up partly upward above the surface of the ground 22. The<br>
projecting part 2a1 is usually connected by means of predetermined breaking<br>
elements 21 with respect to the part 2a" embedded in the ground, in order that the<br>
tearing off of the upper part 2a' when it is driven into by a car does not also<br>
damage or displace the part 2a" lying in the ground.<br>
The base box 2a is usually open at the top and bottom and serves for leading out<br>
the buried cables 8, which are laid underground, with their free end upward in the<br>
direction of the electrical cabinet to be provided there, and also as a stable<br>
foundation for the electrical cabinet to be provided on it.<br>
Furthermore, additional elements, for example batteries 16, which are intended to<br>
ensure a power supply to the control components of the electrical cabinet over a<br>
certain time even in the event of a power failure, may be accommodated in the<br>
interior of the base box, in particular within its upper part 2a'.<br>
The electrical cabinet 1 in this case encloses the upper part 2a of the base box 2a,<br>
protecting upward above the surface of the ground 22. The inner installation<br>
frame 6 of the electrical cabinet 1 is generally made up of individual struts, which<br>
run along the outer edges of the cubic form of this installation frame 6 and usually<br>
comprise metal profiled struts, for instance made of aluminum. The interior space<br>
of this installation frame 6 serves for receiving subassemblies such as fuses and<br>
controllers in at least part of this receiving space. In the case of base boxes 2a<br>
projecting above the surface of the ground 22, the upper part 2a' of the base box<br>
2a is received in the lower receiving space 42 of the installation frame 6, which is<br>
partitioned off for this purpose, for example by means of cross struts 34a,b running<br>
in the transverse direction, from the upper receiving space 41, which serves for<br>
receiving the subassemblies of the electrical cabinet.<br>
As figure 1a shows, the installation frame 6 with its middle cross struts 34a,b,<br>
running between the upper and lower ends, and the mounting plates 45 running<br>
therein in the direction of the depth 40, are mounted on the upper side of the upper<br>
part 2a' of the base box 2a, so that the vertical corner struts of the installation<br>
frame extend alongside the upper part 2a' of the base box 2a further downward to<br>
just above the surface of the ground. The mounting plates 45 are fastened to the<br>
cross struts 34, set back inward from the free ends of the latter to such an extent<br>
that they still lie in the region of the transverse extent of the base box 2a.<br>
In the region of the height of the upper receiving space 41, subracks 9 in the form<br>
of vertically running struts are screwed between the upper cross struts 35c,d and<br>
the middle cross struts 34a,b, on which subracks there can be arranged carrier<br>
plates 11, which carry the individual electronic or electromechanical<br>
subassemblies. Slipped over this installation frame 6 - possibly paneled as<br>
described later - is the outer body 3, which represents the outer protection, in<br>
particular weather protection, of the electrical cabinet and also serves for its<br>
climatic control, as described below. The outer body 3 often consists of plastic<br>
and is in this case - as figures 4 and 6 show in particular - made up of individual<br>
panels for the rear wall, side walls, doors and cover.<br>
At the height of the middle cross struts 34, the upper receiving space 41 may be<br>
additionally separated from the lower receiving space 42 by a bottom sheet 18,<br>
which however must have the appropriate clearances for the buried cables 8.<br>
The installation diagram of figure 1b is based in comparison on a base box 2b<br>
which on the one hand ends with its upper side at the height of the surface of the<br>
ground 22, that is to say it is completely within the ground, and has in addition a<br>
different, generally larger, base area extent, at least in the transverse direction 20.<br>
In this case, the electrical cabinet 1 is fastened with its lowermost horizontal struts<br>
on the upper side of the base box 2b sunken completely in the ground, the<br>
mounting plates 45 in turn being fastened in the direction of the depth 40 between<br>
the front and rear, lower cross struts 35a,b, to be precise set outward in the<br>
transverse direction 20 to such an extent that they rest on the ends of the upper<br>
side of the base box 2b.<br>
In the middle region, the installation frame 6 is in this case preferably stiffened as<br>
before by means of middle cross struts 34a,b, but now the receiving space 42<br>
located below these middle cross struts can optionally likewise be used for<br>
receiving electrical subassemblies, including for receiving batteries 16. In this<br>
lower receiving space there may also be an element fastened horizontally to the<br>
installation frame 6, for fixing the position of the buried cables, for example a cable<br>
fastening rail 26.<br>
The arrangement of the remaining elements in relation to the surface of the ground<br>
22 is the same as in the case of figure 1a. What is different is the arrangement of<br>
the predetermined breaking elements 21, which are now arranged between the<br>
mounting plates 45 and the base box 2b.<br>
Figure 2 shows the form of installation according to figure 1b in the same sectional<br>
representation but with regard to the air circulation now taking place within the<br>
electrical cabinet 1, caused by uneven heating up:<br>
On the one hand, the outer body 3 is in this case exposed to solar radiation. On<br>
the other hand, arranged at least in the upper receiving space 41 are electrical<br>
subassemblies 12, which are energy consumers and produce waste heat, and<br>
consequently heat up the receiving space 41.<br>
If the upper receiving space 41 is open with respect to the lower receiving space<br>
42, that is to say in between there are only the cross struts 34a,b on the sides, a<br>
vertical circulation in which the heated air rises, cools on the upper frame cover 26<br>
and falls downward, is produced in the interior of the installation frame 6,<br>
extending over both receiving spaces 41, 42.<br>
Separately from this there exists an air flow in the surrounding intermediate space<br>
19 between the installation frame 6 and the outer body 3, if the installation frame 6<br>
is paneled for this purpose on the outside with plastic panels or other continuous<br>
panels. If this paneling is additionally intended to offer EMC shielding, a metallic<br>
covering, or at least fitting out with metal foil, is necessary for this.<br>
For the interior space of the installation frame 6 to be accessible, the paneling of<br>
this installation frame 6 must likewise have inner doors or flaps.<br>
The air flow in the intermediate space 19 is not a closed circulation, but instead the<br>
air penetrates here through inlet openings 27 in the lower region of the body 3 into<br>
the intermediate space 18, for example - as represented on the right-hand side of<br>
figure 2 - in that the outer walls of the body 3 do not quite reach down to the<br>
ground.<br>
In the upper region of the body, there are air outlet openings 13, either between<br>
the cover 5 and the side walls of the body 3 or in an upper intermediate part 7,<br>
which is set between the cover 5 and the rest of the body 3, and may have<br>
additional active or passive cooling or heating components.<br>
Figures 3 show the installation situation of figure 1a, that is to say with the base<br>
box 2a rising up partly above the surface of the ground 22, with not yet completed<br>
fastening of the installation frame 6 to the base box 2a, in rear view (figure 3a),<br>
side view (figure 3b), front view (figure 3c) and plan view (figure 3d).<br>
As figures 3a-c show in particular, middle cross struts 34a,b are in this case fitted<br>
between the vertical struts of the installation frame 6, such that they run in the<br>
transverse direction 20. Fastened to the installation frame, in particular to these<br>
cross struts 34a,b, are mounting plates 45, which run from the front cross strut 34a<br>
to the rear cross strut 34b, that is to say in the direction of the depth 40 of the<br>
electrical cabinet 1. The height of the cross struts 34a,b is chosen such that, when<br>
the mounting plates 45 are mounted on the upper side of the upper part 2a1 of the<br>
base box 2a, the installation frame 6 ends just above the surface of the ground 22.<br>
To achieve this positioning, one of the lower cross struts according to figures 3<br>
and also the analogous, three-dimensional representation of figure 5, for example<br>
the front lower cross strut 35a, is removed from the installation frame 6 and the<br>
installation frame 6 is then pushed horizontally along the ground or, raised just<br>
slightly, over the upper part 2a' of the base box 2a in such a way that, as<br>
described, the mounting plates 45 rest on the upper side of the base box 2a.<br>
While this pushing-over has only partly taken place in figures 3 and 5, figure 6<br>
shows a later installation state, in which the pushing-over has been completed and<br>
the previously removed lower cross strut 35a has also been fastened again to the<br>
installation frame 6, and side walls and the rear wall of the body 3 and also the<br>
cover 5 have already been mounted on the outer side of the installation frame 6, at<br>
a distance, with an upper intermediate part 7 being arranged between the cover 5<br>
and the remaining body 3, permitting air outlet openings 13 for the air to leave<br>
from the intermediate space 19 between the outer body 3 and the inner installation<br>
frame 6.<br><br>
The representations of figures 4, the individual views of which correspond with<br>
regard to the viewing direction to those of figures 3, show yet a further installation<br>
state in comparison with the latter, in which the outer body 3 has also already<br>
been completed by adding a door 4 and a front panel 14.<br>
Figure 7 shows the partly completed electrical cabinet 1, mounted on a base box<br>
2b. The main difference in comparison with the representations of figures 5 and 6<br>
is that, in the case of figure 7, the electrical cabinet 1 is mounted with its lower<br>
edge on the upper side of a base box 2b, and consequently overall in accordance<br>
with the basic representation of figure 1b, since this base box 2b is fitted<br>
essentially completely in the ground, so that the upper edge of the base box 2b is<br>
at the same time the surface of the ground 22. As can be seen, the base box 2b<br>
comprises a grid as a base, on which the base structure rises up, and has an outer<br>
surrounding of its own in the upper region, near the surface of the ground 22.<br>
On the - open - upper side of this base box 2b there is fastened, according to<br>
figure 7, the installation frame 6 of the electrical cabinet 1, in which - as a<br>
difference from figures 5 and 6 - the mounting plates 45, which in the side regions<br>
extend through from the front cross strut to the rear cross strut, are not fastened to<br>
the cross struts 34a,b, fastened in the middle region of the installation frame 6, but<br>
to the lower cross struts 35a,b.<br>
This produces a height of the installation frame 6, and consequently also of the<br>
later electrical cabinet 1, above the surface of the ground 22 which corresponds to<br>
the other solution according to figures 5 and 6, but, according to figure 7, the lower<br>
receiving space 42 is also available for receiving electrical components.<br>
It is nevertheless also the case with the solution according to figure 7 that the<br>
subracks 9 extend only from the middle cross struts 34 to the upper cross struts.<br>
In figure 7, the upper sides and the side faces and also the rear side are provided<br>
with a paneling 46 of continuous panels, preferably made of an EMC-shielding<br>
material such as aluminum for instance, which are fastened between the struts of<br>
the installation frame 6.<br>
Figure 8 shows the structure of the electrical cabinet at a more advanced stage of<br>
completion in comparison with figure 7, that is to say with a complete body 3,<br>
surrounding the installation frame . 6, including an upper intermediate part 7<br>
mounted thereupon, with already described air outlet openings 13 at the periphery<br>
and a cover 5 closing off the upper intermediate part 13 [sic] at the top.<br>
The front side of the electrical cabinet is in this case closed over the height of the<br>
upper receiving space 41, that is to say from the front middle cross strut 34a to the<br>
front upper cross strut, by a door 4 hinged on the right, while the lower front<br>
region, that is to say the height of the lower receiving space 42, is closed by<br>
means of a front panel 14, which may preferably be swung open forward by<br>
means of hinges in the lower region, along the lower edge.<br>
If an EMC shielding of the electrical cabinet 1 is desired, the front panel 14 and<br>
door 4 must likewise provide EMC shielding and, if produced from plastic,<br>
preferably have an inner covering of EMC-shielding material, such as aluminum<br>
for instance.<br>
