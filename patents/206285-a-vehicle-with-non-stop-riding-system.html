Background of Invention:-<br>
To devise an Invention replacing effectively the fuel based running vehicle. As of now, only one Electric Vehicle is in use, but it is with much limitation. For example, can run only for short distance and needs to be charged constantly and charging is also not possible as frequent as fuel filling. More over, the electric Vehicle is charged only through Ac power Supply.<br>
The Inspiration is to remove all these limitation and to invent a Vehicle for frequent and non-stop long- distance usages.<br>
Sphere of Invention:-<br>
This invention is intended to replace the manual pedaling in existing two wheeler riding system with air driven cycle generating the required Power system for motion.<br>
This invention is unique and original as the cycle runs on the energy propelled by Air drive blades, but this invention is limited to two wheeler riding cycles. This invention is practically workable and can be taken to trial at any time.<br>
(a)	Requirement for running my invention:<br>
t&gt;    1. Air Drive blade with 15 inches in total diameter accompanying four or five fixed blades with less space between blades connected to in build direct alternator,<br>
&gt;	2. Battery - 12 or 24 volts: lOOAH Amps.<br>
&gt;	3. DC Motor - 1 HP 3000 Rotation per minute (RPM)<br>
&gt;	4. An alternator producing 12 or 24 volts DC current with 40 Amps with automatic cut- off switch system to maintain battery charge level.<br>
(b)	Brief working of the Invention:-<br><br>
A mechanism inventing a new process to charge the Battery by using a Air Drive blade consisting of four or five distinct overlapping blades, once the Vehicle starts by using the backup power battery, reaching the speed of 25 KM, the Air Drive blades cuts sharply the Air and pumps the Air forcing the drive to rotate, that in turn rotate the alternator fixed directly to it. Altimeter rotate producing 12 or 24 volt D.C current and recharging the battery. This D.C. line is connected to the input is connected to a 12 or 24 volt, 3000 RPM DC motor and that is connected to three speed gear box assembled to the rear wheel and the Air Driven Vehicle thus continues to runs.<br>

From Mosfet Output, two terminals (22) +ve &amp; (15) -ve connects the DC motor =1 HP 3000 RPM (10). Mosfet Signal Output (21) &amp;(23) connecting toR.W.3, 5Kii Control (6) , assembled in handle bar (5).<br><br>
DC Motor(lO) Drive corrected through chain (9) and Sprockets (8) to Gear Box (11). From Gear Box ( 11) thorough chain (9) and Sprockets (8) , the rear wheel is connected (7). Manual charging of the battery is done through Dc rectifiers (16) and a plug (17) with 220 AC volt from external source<br>
07.Description of the invention:<br>
This Patent application is filed for the mechanism involved in using Air drive blades for generating the current, which is innovative and novel one.<br>
The Air Drive blade (marked as 1 in Fig 2&amp;3 ) consist of 4 or 6 or 8 blades all distinct, overlapping but not touching each other, cormected centrally by a sphere vetch an overall diameter of 15 inches. The blades can range from 4 or 6 or 8 ranging from heavy weight vehicle to light weight one. The Air Drive blade is facing front side and it is attached between front wheel and Headlight. An open safety garb on both sides covers the Air drive blade and thereby the drive is open. The Air Blade Drive is connected to 12 or 24 volt 40Amps DC Altemators (Marked as 2 in Fig 2 &amp; 3 ).<br>
In this system, the Vehicle on reaching a particulars speed, say,25Km per hour the altemator start producing DC Supply to recharge the Battery (Marked as 13 in Fig 2 &amp; 3). This Altemator does a distinct fiction to maintain the charge level in the battery and thus regulates the Charge level in the Battery. Irrespective of the Speed and rotation of the Blade, the Altemator maintains the charging level by using a built -in cut-off switch.<br>
When the vehicle is started, to move it initial torque will be 30 to 40 Amps discharges from the Battery ( marked as 13 in Fig. 2 &amp; 3). During running the discharge will be 8 to 15 Amps including lighting system. During running of any vehicle shell having its fly -wheel movement, according to speed varies in this ratio: 1: l/a ,1:2, 1:3. In the same maimed, even here, the discharging current is not  regular, but while the<br><br>
charging is regular at the rate of 40 Amps after 25 Km speed and thereby the proportion for changing is higher than the discharge (40 amps : 15 Amps)<br>
The battery output B (+) &amp; B (-) connecting the Input of the Mosfet Drive (marked as 12 &amp; in fig. 2 &amp; 3). There are five terminals (marked as 14,15, 21,22 &amp; 23 in Fig.2) in Mosfet Drive. B (+) is connecting terminals (marked as 14in Fig 2).The circuit output through terminals 23&amp;21 regulates the Speed connecting the Control value R.W.3, 5K,£i:(marked as 6 in fig.2) assembled along with right side handle Bar. (marked as 5 in fig.2 &amp; 3).<br>
Mosfet output terminals (marked as 15 and 22 in Fig 2) cormected to the 12 or 24 volt, 3000 RPM DC motor (marked as 15 and 22 in Fig 2). This motor engaged with Gear box (marked as 10 in Fig.2 &amp; 3). This motor engaged with Gear box (marked as 11 in Fig. 2 &amp; 3) 3000 RPM from the motor is reduced by Gear box by connecting 1:2 ratio sprocket (marked as 8 in fig 2 &amp; 3) by Chain (marked as 9 fig 2 &amp; 3). After this connection, 3000 RPM reduced to 1500 RPM in the Gear Box. From the Gear Box to the rear wheel, same 1:2 ratio sprockets connected (marked as above) reducing the wheel RPM to 750. In this ratio, the Vehicle will touch the full speed RPM 120 to 130 KM per hour. In the meantime, if any excess load is needed to climb any hills, then by using load gear. Wheel RPM shall reduced to 375 RPM. Brake assembly (marked as 25 in fig.3) is connected with the rear wheel.<br>
It is imminent to note that without using the alternators circuit, by reason of speed below 25 MS., the Battery can back - up upto 80 to 100 Km distance. Notwithstanding this, recharging the Battery manually can also be done through a D.C. Rectifier Battery Charging (marked as 16 in fig 2) connected to 220 AC - Plug (marked as 17 in fig.2) wherever required.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
