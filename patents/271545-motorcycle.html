[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a motorcycle,<br>
particularly, to the arrangement of an injector, a fuel<br>
pump, and a control unit for controlling the injector and<br>
the fuel pump, in the motorcycle.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
There is known a motorcycle in which a fuel pump and<br>
a throttle body having an injector are juxtaposed in the vehicle width direction across a main frame (see, for example. Patent Document 1) .<br>
[0003]<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2008-143317<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0004]<br>
In the motorcycle disclosed in Patent Document 1 mentioned above, since the throttle body and the fuel pump are juxtaposed in the vehicle width direction across the main frame, the injector of the throttle body and the fuel pump can be disposed in close proximity to each other, thus providing an advantage that fuel piping for connecting the injector and the fuel pump is shortened. Even though, however, the injector and the fuel pump are disposed in proximity to each other, if a control unit (ECU) for controlling these components is disposed away from them,<br><br>
wiring for connecting the control unit to the injector and the fuel pump is lengthened, thus increasing vehicle manufacturing cost and body weight. [0005]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned circumstances, and an object of the invention is to provide a motorcycle that enables reduction in vehicle manufacturing cost and body weight by shortening the fuel piping for connecting the injector and the fuel pump and by shortening the wiring for connecting the control unit to the injector and the fuel pump. [Means for solving the Problem] [0006]<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned object, in the invention according to Claim 1, there is provided a motorcycle including: a main frame extending rearward and downward from a head pipe; an engine supported on the main frame; a throttle body connected to a rear portion of the engine and having an injector for injecting fuel into an intake passage; a fuel pump provided outside a fuel tank; and a control unit for controlling the injector and the fuel pump, wherein the injector, the fuel pump and the control unit are disposed around the main frame in such a manner as to surround the main frame. [0007]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 2, in addition to the configuration in the invention according to Claim 1, an air cleaner is connected through a connecting tube to a<br><br>
rear portion of the throttle body; and the control unit is disposed opposite to the connecting tulDe across the main frame in a vehicle width direction. [0008]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 3, in addition to the configuration in the invention according to Claim 1 or 2, the fuel pump has a discharge portion for discharging fuel to the injector; and the control unit is disposed in a direction in which the discharge portion protrudes from the fuel pump and in a position lower than the discharge portion. [0009]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 4, there is provided a motorcycle including: a main frame extending rearward and downward from a head pipe; an engine supported on the main frame; a throttle body connected to a rear portion of the engine and having an injector for injecting fuel into an intake passage; a fuel pump provided outside a fuel tank; and a control unit for controlling the injector and the fuel pump, wherein the injector, the fuel pump, and the control unit are disposed distributedly to right and left across the main frame. [Effect of the Invention] [0010]<br>
In accordance with the motorcycle according to Claim 1, since the injector, the fuel pump, and the control unit are disposed around the main frame in such a manner as to surround the main frame, the fuel piping for connecting the<br><br>
injector and the fuel pump can be shortened, and the wiring for connecting the control unit to the injector and the fuel pump can be shortened, thus enabling reduction in vehicle manufacturing cost and body weight. [0011]<br>
In accordance with the motorcycle according to Claim<br>
2,	since the air cleaner is connected through the<br>
connecting tube to a rear portion of the throttle body and<br>
the control unit is disposed opposite to the connecting<br>
tube across the main frame in the vehicle width direction,<br>
the control unit and the connecting tube can be disposed<br>
compactly around the main frame. If the control unit is<br>
disposed on the same side as the connecting tube, the<br>
control unit or the connecting tube is then disposed far<br>
from the main frame in the vehicle width direction, thus<br>
increasing vehicle size in the vehicle width direction.<br>
[0012]<br>
In accordance with the motorcycle according to Claim<br>
3,	since the fuel pump has the discharge portion for<br>
discharging fuel to the injector and the control unit is<br>
disposed in the direction in which the discharge portion<br>
protrudes from the fuel pump and in a position lower than<br>
the discharge portion, the fuel pump and the control unit<br>
can be disposed in close proximity to each other while the<br>
control unit is provided in the direction in which the<br>
discharge portion protrudes.<br>
[0013]<br>
In accordance with the motorcycle according to Claim<br><br>
4,   since the injector, the fuel pump, and the control unit are disposed distributedly to right and left across the main frame, the fuel piping for connecting the injector and the fuel pump can be shortened, and the wiring for connecting the control unit to the injector and the fuel pump can be shortened, thus enabling reduction in vehicle manufacturing cost and body weight.
