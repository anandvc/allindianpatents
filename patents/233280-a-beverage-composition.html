				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to methods of treating dental erosion, preventing dental discoloration or both comprising orally administering a beverage composition to a mammal, preferably a human. The beverage composition is preferably not acidic, that is, the pH is above about 5.5. The present invention is further directed to kits comprising the beverage compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Beverage compositions, for example, soft drink beverages (e.g., cola beverages) and fruit juice beverages, have the potential when consumed to cause dental erosion and often dental discoloration. Such dental erosion and discoloration can result wherein the beverage composition is acidic in nature, i.e., exhibits a pH of about 5 or below. Additionally, since children are particularly susceptible to dental erosion relative to adults due to the smaller enamel surface to volume ratio, consumption of such beverages may be of particular concern for this group, Accordingly, since many consumers ingest acidic beverage compositions weekly, daily, or even more frequently, it would be advantageous to discover a beverage composition that protects against dental erosion and discoloration.<br>
The art suggests that such factors as pH, fluoride, calcium, and even phosphate concentration may have an effect on dental erosion and / or dental caries. For example, acidic pH, particularly about 5 or below, is typically considered to exacerbate dental erosion (which occurs by direct action of acid on the enamel surface). For example, Lussi et al., "Prediction of the Erosive Potential of Some Beverages", Caries Research, Vol. 29, pp. 349 - 354 (1995) examined the erosive potential of many beverage compositions, all having a pH of less than 5.<br>
Furthermore, Borggreven et al.. "The Influence of Various Amphiphilic Phosphates on in vitro Caries Lesion Formation in Human Dental Enamel", Caries Research, Vol. 26, pp. 84 - 88 (1992) suggests enamel softening in the presence of certain polyphosphates at levels below pH 5.5. See Borggreven et al.. p. 87.<br>
The art suggests that further factors are important in dental erosion and / or dental caries. Lussi et al. (citation herein above) suggests that fluoride concentration is a further factor contributing to dental erosion. For example, among beverage compositions tested by Lussi et al.. the compositions having the highest fluoride concentrations showed the smallest amount of surface softening of the enamel. However, highest phosphate concentrations did not necessarily correlate with decreased surface softening of the enamel. For example, apple juice, having a<br>
moderately high phosphate concentration relative to many other beverage compositions tested, was also the most erosive beverage composition tested, gee Lussi et al.. pp. 352 - 353.<br>
There has been further experimentation with certain phosphates, including pyrophosphates and polyphospates, with respect to dental health, particularly in the area of dental caries. For example, Stadtler et al.. "The Effect of Sodium Trimetaphosphate on Caries: A 3-Year Clinical Toothpaste Trial", Caries Research, Vol. 30, pp. 418 - 422 (1996), suggests that trimetaphosphate (a cyclic phosphate) may be effective against dental caries. However, Stadtler et al. utilized toothpaste formulations having near-neutral pH rather than a more acidic formulation. Other studies have suggested efficacy against dental caries using certain phosphates in a relatively neutral pH, calcium-containing solution, but the "polyphosphates" studied comprised 2, 3 or 6 phosphates (ortho, trimeta, tripoly, and hexameta phosphates). See e.g.. McGaughey et al.. "Effects of Polyphosphates on the Solubility and Mineralization of HA. Other studies of the effect of small polyphosphates (P 
Another study did suggest the efficacy of monocalcium phosphate in low pH powdered beverage compositions for preventing molar erosion. See Reussner et al.. "Effects of Phosphates in Acid-Containing Beverages on Tooth Erosion", Journal of Dental Research, pp. 365 - 370, March - April 1975. However, this same study further suggested that beverage compositions supplemented with other phosphates, including sodium hexametaphosphate, did not produce significant protective effects against molar erosion. See Reussner et al.. p. 367. These studies generally agree that the tripoly phosphate (P = 3) has some benefit for preventing caries. But these studies fail to identify larger polyphosphates that protect teeth from the harmful effects of acidic beverages.<br>
Finally, WO 01/72144 Al, filed by Smithkline Beecham PLC, and claiming priority to a Great Britain application filed on March 27, 2000, discloses the use of longer chain poly phosphates (n = 7 to 30) for use in acidic oral compositions (pH between 2.5 - 5.5) to alleviate tooth damage. This reference, however, does not discuss or contemplate the delivery of higher chain polyphosphates from a non-acidic beverage composition.<br>
Accordingly, there is a continuing need for beverage compositions having a relatively neutral pH, which are effective against dental erosion and discoloration. More specifically, there is a need for beverages that are not acidic enough to attack teeth, but provide protection from the<br>
harmful attack of acidic beverages. Moreover, there exists a need for beverages that protect teeth from both erosion and discoloration. These and other benefits are provided by the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a method of treating dental erosion, preventing dental discoloration or both comprising orally administering to a mammal (preferably, a human) a beverage composition having a pH of greater than about 5.5; wherein the beverage composition comprises a compound having the structure:<br><br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein n is an integer averaging from about 7 to about 100 and M, M', and M" are each, independently, selected from the group consisting of sodium and potassium.<br>
The present invention is further directed to kits comprising the foregoing beverage composition and information that use of the beverage composition provides treatment against dental erosion, dental discoloration or both.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that by introducing a relatively long chain poly phosphate to mammalian teeth via a non-acdic beverage that the teeth will be protected from a later attack by an acidic beverage. This protection can last up to four hours and normally exceeds three hours, This is very important because many acidic beverages do not contain ingredients to protect against the damage that such beverages inflict on tooth enamel. As such, it is desirable to provide the protective component through other beverages, for example tap or bottled water. Moreover, because poly phosphate components can bind with calcium and other minerals, it is often undesirable to add the poly phosphates to fortified drinks. Calcium fortified fruit drinks fall within this category, and most of them, orange juice and apple juice for example, are highly acidic. Thus, they will attack the teeth and the addition of poly phosphates to these compositions may be counter productive. That is, the poly phosphates will complex with the fortified minerals, reducing the efficacy of each component. Thus, the ability to introduce a protective composition via a non-acidic beverage, which protects the teeth from attack by an acidic beverage consumed hours later, is a substantial improvement over the art.<br>
The methods and kits of the present invention are described more particularly herein below.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>

All percentages and ratios are calculated by weight unless otherwise indicated. All percentages and ratios are calculated based on the total composition unless otherwise indicated.<br>
All component or composition levels are in reference to the active level of that component or composition, and are exclusive of impurities, for example, residual solvents or by¬products, which may be present in commercially available sources.<br>
Referred to herein are trade names for components including, but not limited to, certain carbohydrates, flavors, and other components. The inventor herein does not intend to be limited by materials under a certain trade name. Equivalent materials (e.g., those obtained from a different source under a different name or catalog (reference) number) to those referenced by trade name may be substituted and utilized in the compositions, kits, and methods herein.<br>
In the description of the invention various embodiments and/or individual features are disclosed. As will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled practitioner, all combinations of such embodiments and features are possible and can result in preferred executions of the present invention.<br>
The compositions, methods, and kits herein may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of any of the elements as described herein.<br>
Definitions<br>
As used herein, the term "dental erosion" is defined as loss, softening, and / or demineralization of mammalian tooth substance (i.e., demineralization of enamel of the tooth typically with dissolution of such enamel). Preferably, such loss of tooth substance occurs by direct action of acid on the tooth substance. Such acid may be, for example, present in the oral cavity either naturally, through chronic regurgitation (through conditions such as, for example, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and / or gastrointestinal disturbances) and / or through<br>
administration of acidic (i.e., having a pH of less than about 5) foods, beverages, pharmaceutical preparations (including over-the-counter and Rx), and / or nutraceutical preparations. See G_.R., Lussi et al.. "Prediction of the Erosive Potential of Some Beverages", Caries Research, Vol. 29, pp. 349 - 354 (1995). Preferably, such chemical processes are not directly related to the action of bacteria (i.e., caries), which more typically results in cavity formation. Dental erosion may result in the aforementioned loss or softening of enamel and demineralization.<br>
As used herein, the term "dental discoloration" is defined as the decrease in whiteness of the tooth enamel, or a darkening, or yellowing of the tooth enamel. Loss of sheen or luster of the tooth enamel is also associated with dental discoloration. Tooth enamel can be measured for discoloration using a standard shade guide, for example, VITA LUMINO® Vacuum Farbskala Shade Guides, a product of VITA Zahnfabrik, of BadSackingen, Germany. The discoloration of tooth enamel can be caused by everyday food and drinks such as coffee, tea, wine, and other beverages with tooth staining potential as well as other sources of potential tooth staining, such as tobacco use (smoked, chewed, etc.), antimicrobial agents, and other compounds known or demonstrated to effect or enhance staining of tooth surfaces, in particular those that deposit stain into the protein film (pellicle) that generally covers all exposed tooth surfaces.<br>
As used herein, the term "treating" with reference to the term "dental erosion" and "dental discoloration" is defined as inhibiting (either partially or completely), reversing, and / or protecting against dental erosion or discoloration with respect to the user of the present beverage composition. Most preferably, the term "treating" with reference to the term "dental erosion" is defined as inhibiting (either partially or completely) and / or protecting against dental erosion or discoloration with respect to the user of the present beverage composition. Wherein dental erosion or discoloration is "treated", conditions such as, for example, softening of enamel, demineralization, darkening, and / or cavity formation may be inhibited, reversed, and / or protected against.<br>
Methods of the Present Invention<br>
The present methods are directed to treating dental erosion, dental discoloration or both comprising orally administering to a mammal a beverage composition having a pH of greater than about 5.5, wherein the beverage composition comprises a polyphosphate compound having the defined structure set forth herein. Surprisingly, it has discovered that, despite the relatively neutral pH of the beverage compositions, the present beverage compositions provide treatment against dental erosion, dental discoloration or both. The inventors herein have further excitingly discovered that such treatment is provided even wherein the beverage composition is substantially<br>
free of components which are often associated with treatment of dental erosion, dental discoloration or both, i.e., fluoride and / or calcium. The present inventor has further discovered that such treatment is also provided even wherein the beverage composition is substantially free of phosphate derived from one or more compounds other than the polyphosphate compound defined herein.<br>
In accordance with the methods of the present invention, dental erosion, dental discoloration or both is treated through orally administering to a mammal, preferably a human, a beverage composition having a pH of greater than about 5.5 and comprising the polyphosphate compound as specifically defined herein. As used herein, the term "orally administering" with respect to the mammal (preferably, human) means that the mammal ingests or is directed to ingest (preferably, for the purpose of treatment against dental erosion, dental discoloration or both) one or more beverage compositions of the present invention. Wherein the mammal is directed to ingest one or more of the beverage compositions, such direction may be that which instructs and / or informs the user that use of the beverage composition may and / or will provide treatment against dental erosion, dental discoloration or both. For example, such direction may be oral direction (e.g., through oral instruction from, for example, a physician, dental professional, sales professional or organization, and / or radio or television media (i.e., advertisement) or written direction (e.g., through written direction from, for example, a physician or dental professional (e.g., scripts), sales professional or organization (e.g., through, for example, marketing brochures, pamphlets, or other instructive paraphernalia), written media (e.g., internet, electronic mail, or other computer-related media), and / or packaging associated with the beverage composition (e.g., a label present on a package containing the beverage composition). As used herein, "written" means through words, pictures, symbols, and / or other visible descriptors. Such descriptors need not utilize the actual words "dental", "discoloration" and / or "erosion", but rather use of words, pictures, symbols, and the like conveying the same or similar meaning are contemplated within the scope of this invention.<br>
According to the present invention, the mammal ingests or is directed to ingest one or more of the compositions as described herein. Such ingestion or direction is typically at least once monthly, more typically at least once weekly, and most preferably at least once daily. Preferably, such ingestion or direction is in place of erosive beverage compositions, for example, low pH beverage compositions or carbonated beverages which do not comprise a polyphosphate compound as described herein. Additionally, optimum treatment against dental health problems will typically further involve standard dental care, including using standard dentrifices according<br>
to standard methods, e.g., using toothpastes and / or oral rinses which are intended for prophylaxis of common dental problems such as dental caries and the like.<br>
As stated, the present method relates to treating dental erosion, dental discoloration or both comprising orally administering to a mammal (preferably, a human) a beverage composition having a pH of greater than about 5.5; wherein the beverage composition comprises a polyphosphate compound having the structure:<br><br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein n is an integer averaging from about 7 to about 100 and M, M', and M" are each, independently, selected from the group consisting of sodium and potassium.<br>
Preferably, the present beverage compositions comprise from about 0.001% to about 0.5%, more preferably from about 0.03% to about 0.3%, even more preferably from about 0.05% to about 0.2%, and most preferably from about 0.05% to about 0.1% of the compound, by weight of the beverage composition.<br>
Also preferably, n is an integer averaging from about 10 to about 30, more preferably averaging from about 13 to about 25, and most preferably averaging from about 19 to about 25. Most preferably, n is an integer averaging about 21.<br>
Also preferably, each of M, M', and M" are sodium.<br>
The present beverage compositions herein have a pH of greater than about 5.5, preferably from about 6.0 to about 9.5, and most preferably from about 6.5 to about 8,0. Beverage composition acidity can be adjusted to and maintained within the requisite range by known and conventional methods, e.g., the use of food grade buffers. The component utilized to adjust and maintain the appropriate pH is not critical to the present invention.<br>
The beverages used in the present methods provide protection against dental discoloration caused by coffee, tea, wine, and other beverages with tooth staining potential, tobacco use, antimicrobial agents, and mixtures thereof. Moreover, the treatment provides protection against dental erosion, dental discoloration or both for up to about four hours, preferably at least about 3.5 hours, and even more preferably at least about three hours. While not wanting to be bound by any one theory, it is believed that the polyphosphate compositions of the present invention adhere to<br>
the pellicle on the tooth enamel, strengthening it, and protecting the enamel from a later attack by an acidic beverage.<br>
It has been further excitingly discovered that treatment of dental erosion, dental discoloration or both is provided herein through use of the beverage composition even wherein the beverage composition is substantially free of components which are often associated with treatment of dental erosion, dental discoloration or both, i.e., fluoride and / or calcium. The present inventors have further discovered that such treatment is also provided even wherein the beverage composition is substantially free of phosphate derived from compounds other than the polyphosphate compound defined herein. Accordingly, a preferred but not requisite embodiment herein are beverage compositions which are substantially free of fluoride, calcium, and / or phosphate derived from one or more compounds other than the polyphosphate compound defined herein. As used herein, "substantially free of fluoride" or the like means that the composition comprises less than about 0.1% of fluoride (as an element, including in ionic form), preferably less than about 0,075% of fluoride, more preferably less than about 0.05% of fluoride, and most preferably less than about 0,025% of fluoride, all by weight of the beverage composition. As used herein, "substantially free of calcium" or the like means that the composition comprises less than about 0.1% of calcium (as an element, including in ionic form), preferably less than about 0.075% of calcium, more preferably less than about 0.05% of calcium, and most preferably less than about 0.025% of calcium, all by weight of the .beverage composition. As used herein, "substantially free of a phosphate derived from one or more compounds other than the polyphosphate compound defined herein" or the like means that the composition comprises less than about 0.1% of such other phosphate (as an element, including in ionic form), preferably less than about 0.075% of such other phosphate, more preferably less than about 0.05% of such other phosphate, and most preferably less than about 0.025% of such other phosphate, all by weight of the beverage composition.<br>
In accordance with the present method it is further surprising that one or more sweeteners may be included in the beverage compositions with maintenance of treatment of dental erosion, dental discoloration or both. Such sweeteners are described herein below as an optional component of the beverage composition.<br>
Kits of the Present Invention<br>
The present invention further relates to kits comprising a beverage composition as described herein and information that use of the beverage composition provides treatment against dental erosion, dental discoloration or both. For example, such information may be oral<br>
information disseminated as part of the kit, but is preferably written information, typically present on packaging associated with the beverage composition (e.g., a label present on a package containing the beverage composition or package insert included within the kit). As used herein, "written" means through words, pictures, symbols, and / or other visible information. Such information need not utilize the actual words "dental", "discoloration" and / or "erosion", but rather use of words, pictures, symbols, and the like conveying the same or similar meaning are contemplated within the scope of this invention. Such information may also include information about general dental health and reasons for which dental health, and particularly treatment against dental erosion, is important for the user.<br>
Optional Components of the Beverage Compositions Utilized in the Present Kits and Methods<br>
The compositions utilized in the kits and methods of the present invention may comprise additional optional components to enhance, for example, their stability, organoleptic properties and / or nutritional profile. For example, water, beverage emulsions, thickeners, sweeteners, coloring agents, nutrients, carbonation components, soluble fibers, preservatives, and the like may be included in the compositions herein. Such optional components may be dispersed, solubilized, or otherwise mixed into the present compositions. These components may be added to the compositions herein provided they do not substantially hinder the properties of the beverage composition. Non-limiting examples of optional components suitable for use herein are given below. Water<br>
Since the present compositions are beverage compositions, water is typically utilized in the methods and kits of the present invention. As used herein, the term "water" includes the total amount of water present in the composition. Accordingly, "water" includes water from flavor agents, sugar syrups, and other sources, e.g., gum solutions. Water of hydration of any solids present in the compositions is also included. Wherein water is included, water is included at levels from about 0.1% to about 99.999%, preferably from about 5% to about 99%, still preferably from about 50% to about 99%, more preferably from about 70% to about 95%, and most preferably from about 85% to about 93%, by weight of the product.<br>
One of ordinary skill will recognize that the compounds utilized herein may also have activity as a preservative when utilized in beverage compositions, it is often preferred to utilize compositions which are also optimized for preservative activity. Therefore, as one will further<br>
understand based on recent disclosures, the water hardness may be adjusted for optimum<br>
preservative activity of the compound used herein. The term "hardness" with respect to the water herein generally refers to the presence of certain cations in water. For purposes of the present invention, hardness of the added water component is calculated according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) standards set forth in Official .Methods,.of Analysis, published by the AOAC, Arlington, Virginia, pp. 627 - 628 (14th Ed., 1984). Under AOAC standards, hardness is the sum of CaCO3 equivalents (mg / L) in water, which sum is obtained by multiplying the concentrations (mg / L) found of the following cations in the water by the factors (see Table 1, below).<br>
TABLE 1<br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
Compounds which impart hardness to water are primarily magnesium and calcium carbonates, bicarbonates, sulfates, chlorides, and nitrates, although other compounds which can contribute polyvalent cations to water can also impart hardness. Water based on hardness is normally classified as soft (0 - 60 ppm water hardness), moderately hard (61 - 120 ppm water hardness), and very hard (over 180 ppm). It is preferred herein that the compositions have a water hardness of about 0 ppm to about 120 ppm, more preferably from about 0 ppm to about 60 ppm, and most preferably from about 0 ppm to about 30 ppm. As it is especially preferred, for example, that the compositions herein are substantially free of calcium, such preference for relatively low water hardness (moderately hard or soft) is consistent with the present invention.<br>
Excessively hard water may be treated or softened by known and conventional methods to reduce hardness to appropriate levels. Accordingly, wherein water is treated, this treated water can then be used as the added water component of the beverage product. Beverage Emulsions<br><br>
Beverage compositions utilized herein may optionally, but preferably, comprise from about 0.2% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 3%, and most preferably from about 0.8% to about 2%, of a beverage emulsion. This beverage emulsion can be either a cloud emulsion or a flavor emulsion.<br>
For cloud emulsions, the clouding agent can comprise one or more fats or oils stabilized as an oil-in-water emulsion using a suitable food grade emulsifier. Any of a variety of fats or oils may be employed as the clouding agent, provided that the fat or oil is suitable for use in foods and / or beverages. Preferred are those fats and oils that have been refined, bleached and deodorized to remove off-flavors. Especially suitable for use as clouding agents are those fats that are organoleptically neutral. These include fats from the following sources: vegetable fats such as soybean, corn, safflower, sunflower, cottonseed, canola, and rapeseed; nut fats such as coconut, palm, and palm kernel; and synthetic fats. See e.g., Kupper et al.. U.S. Patent No. 4,705,691, issued November 10, 1987, for suitable fat or oil clouding agents.<br>
Any suitable food grade emulsifier can be used that can stabilize the fat or oil clouding agent as an oil-in-water emulsion. Suitable emulsifiers include gum acacia, modified food starches (e.g., alkenylsuccinate modified food starches), anionic polymers derived from cellulose (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose), gum ghatti, modified gum ghatti, xanthan gum, tragacanth gum, guar gum, locust bean gum, pectin, and mixtures thereof. See e.g.. Kupper et al.. U.S. Patent No. 4,705,691, issued November 10, 1987. Modified starches treated to contain hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic groups, such as those described in Caldwell et al.. U.S. Patent 2,661,349, are preferred emulsifiers for use as herein. Octenyl succinate (OCS) modified starches such as those described in Marotta et al.. U.S. Patent 3,455,838 and Barndt et al.. U.S. Patent 4,460,617 are especially preferred emulsifiers.<br>
Flavor emulsions useful in beverage products of the present invention comprise one or more suitable flavor oils, extracts, oleoresins, essential oils and the like, known in the art for use as flavorants in beverages. This component can also comprise flavor concentrates such as those derived from concentration of natural products such as fruits. Terpeneless citrus oils and essences can also be used herein. Examples of suitable flavors include, for example, fruit flavors such as orange, lemon, lime and the like, cola flavors, tea flavors, coffee flavors, chocolate flavors, dairy flavors. These flavors can be derived from natural sources such as essential oils and extracts, or can be synthetically prepared. The flavor emulsion typically comprises a blend of various flavors and can be employed in the form of an emulsion, alcoholic extract, or spray dried. The flavor emulsion can also include clouding agents, with or without weighting agents, as previously described. See e.g.. Kupper et al.. U.S. Patent 4,705,691, issued November 10, 1987.<br>
Flavor emulsions are typically prepared by mixing one or more flavoring oils (from about 0.001% to about 20%) with an emulsifying agent (from about 1% to about 30%) and water, Emulsions of particles with diameters of from about 0.1 to about 3.0 microns are suitable. Preferably, the particles are about 2.0 microns or less in diameter. Most preferably, the particles are about 1.0 microns or less in diameter. The emulsifying agent coats the particularized flavor oil to aid in preventing coalescence and in maintaining an appropriate dispersion. The viscosity and specific gravity of the flavor emulsion are regulated to be compatible with the finished beverage. See e.g., Kupper et al.. U.S. Patent 4,705,691, issued November 10, 1987. Flavor Agents<br>
The beverage compositions utilized herein may comprise one or more flavor agents selected from fruit juice, tea solids, milk solids, fruit flavors, botanical flavors, and mixtures thereof. When fruit juice is included, the beverages of the present invention can comprise from about 0.1% to about 40%, preferably from about 1% to about 20%, more preferably from about ' 2% to about 10%, and most preferably from about 3% to about 6%, fruit juice. (As measured herein, the weight percentage of fruit juice is based on a single strength 2° to 16° Brix fruit juice). It is understood, however, that many fruit juices contribute to the acidity of the beverage. As such, certain fruit juices should be used in lower concentrations or neutralized so as to raise the pH of the resulting beverage. Those skilled in the art will understand the difference between the acidity resulting from different fruit juices and how to neutralize any excessive acidity. The fruit juice can be incorporated into the beverage as a puree, comminute, or as a single strength or concentrated juice. Especially preferred is incorporation of the fruit juice as a concentrate with a solids content (primarily as sugar solids) of from about 20° to about 80° Brix,<br>
The fruit juice can be any citrus juice, non-citrus juice, or mixture thereof, which are known for use in dilute juice beverages. The juice can be derived from, for example, apple, cranberry, pear, peach, plum, apricot, nectarine, grape, cherry, currant, raspberry, gooseberry, elderberry, blackberry, blueberry, strawberry, lemon, lime, mandarin, orange, grapefruit, cupuacu, potato, tomato, lettuce, celery, spinach, cabbage, watercress, dandelion, rhubarb, carrot, beet, cucumber, pineapple, coconut, pomegranate, kiwi, mango, papaya, banana, watermelon, passion fruit, tangerine, and cantaloupe.

Citrus juices, preferably grapefruit, orange, lemon, lime, and mandarin juices, as well as juices derived from mango, apple, passion fruit, and guava, as well as mixtures of these juices are most preferred.<br>
Fruit flavors may also be utilized. As described above with respect to flavor emulsions, fruit flavors may be derived from natural sources such as essential oil and extracts, or 'can be synthetically prepared. Fruit flavors may be derived from fruits through processing, particularly concentrating. Wherein fruit juices are concentrated or evaporated, the water which is removed or the condensate contains volatile substances which comprise the flavor of the fruit. Often, such flavor is added to a juice concentrate to enhance the flavor thereof. The condensate may also be used to flavor "near waters" (lightly flavored water).<br>
Botanical flavors may also be utilized. As used herein, the term "botanical flavor" refers to a flavor derived from parts of a plant other than the fruit; i.e., derived from nuts, bark, roots, and / or leaves.

Analytical Methods<br>
Beverage compositions, for example, soft drink beverages (e.g., cola beverages) and fruit juice beverages, may cause the consumer of the beverage to experience dental erosion, dental discoloration, or both. Such dental erosion and dental discoloration is caused when ingesting a beverage composition that is acidic in nature, i.e., exhibits a pH of about 5 or below. As such, it<br>
is important to measure the erosive properties (or lack thereof) of typical beverages and the beverage compositions defined herein, and this was done according to the following in vitro erosion cycling protocol.<br>
Tooth (dentin or enamel) specimens are prepared by cutting 3mm-4mm cores from extracted, human teeth using a diamond core drill. The teeth, collected by local surgeons, are stored until use in a 5% Thymol solution maintained at room temperature. Specimens are mounted on lucite rods with a dental acrylic (Dura Base, Reliance Mfg. Co.) covering all sides except the surface. Course polishing with 600-grit silicon carbide-water slurry is used to remove approximately 50 microns of the outer specimen surface to ensure homogeneity among specimens. Specimens are then polished with gamma alumina (Buehler No. 3, B Gamma Micropolish Alumina) to a mirror-like finish.<br>
Portions of the surface of each specimen are then covered with an acid resistant nail polish (placed in a mesial-distal fashion), leaving at least one uncovered strip of tooth surface exposed for treatment. Covered portions remain covered with the acid-resistant nail polish throughout the experiment, serving as the control (untreated) areas for later microradiographic analysis.<br>
After placing specimens in groups of four, each group of specimens is placed in 20 ml of fresh, pooled human saliva for at least one hour to form an initial layer of pellicle on the specimen surfaces prior to the first day of treatment. Typical test products (Treatment A) are listed in Table 2 A along with the acidic beverage (Coca Cola®) challenge (Treatment B), though both the treatments and challenge can be modified from study to study. Other acidic beverages used in similar studies include ginger ale, grapefruit juice, orange juice, etc. Treatment consisted of exposing test specimens to 20 grams of Treatment A (prepared fresh for each treatment) for 10 minutes. After exposure to the appropriate treatment (10 minute exposure followed by brief rinsing with deionized, distilled water), specimens are exposed to the saliva bath for five minutes before immersing into the acidic beverage challenge (Treatment B) for ten minutes. Fresh beverage is used for each treatment. This series of treatments (A followed by saliva followed by B) is repeated 7 times a day for a total of five treatment days. A general protocol is presented in Table 2 B. After each treatment, each group of specimens is rinsed with deionized, distilled water and placed in approximately 20 ml of fresh, pooled human saliva until the time of the next treatment. At any time specimens are not in treatment, they are placed in 20 ml of fresh, pooled human saliva (stirred). The specimens remain in the saliva bath overnight (stirred at room temperature).<br>
After 5 days of treatment, thin cross-sections (80 - 120p,m thick) of each specimen are removed for assessment using standardized transverse microradiography (TMR) techniques. The exposed, treated area of each specimen is assessed with respect to complete mineral loss (erosion). Results are presented in Table 2 C as depth (in microns) of total mineral loss from the original specimen surface using the covered (untreated) areas as anatomical reference points.<br>
The following example compositions were evaluated for their effect on protecting the teeth against the erosive challenge of commercially available carbonated soft drink, Coca Cola®.<br>

As evidenced by the data in Tables 2 A-C, the following observations are made: (a) An aqueous beverage with neutral pH and containing a polyphosphate compound as defined herein, and having a pH of greater than about 5.5, protects tooth enamel from acidic  attack  substantially  better than  distilled  water with  no  polyphosphate compound; and<br>
(b) The combination of a fruit juice composition not containing a polyphosphate compound as defined herein, and having a pH of less than about 5, followed by a second acidic beverage, Coke®, is more erosive than water followed by Coke®.<br>
,	Methods of Making the Beverage Compositions Utilized Herein<br>
The beverage compositions utilized herein are prepared according to methods which are standard in the art. For example, the beverage compositions used herein can be prepared by conventional methods for formulating dilute juice beverages. Such conventional methods may involve hot packing or aseptic packaging operations.<br>
Methods for making dilute juice beverages, for example, are described in Nakel et al.. U.S. Patent No. 4,737,375. Methods for making beverage compositions are also described by Woodroof and Phillips, Beverages: Carbonated &amp; Noncarbonated. AVI Publishing Co., revised ed. 1981; and by Thorner and Herzberg, Non-Alcoholic Food Service Beverage Handbook. AVI Publishing Co., 2nd Ed., 1978).<br>
One method for preparing the beverage compositions herein involves making a beverage concentrate, adding the concentrate to a sugar syrup containing the polyphosphate compound defined herein, and then trimming the mixture with water, sugar syrup, and beverage concentrate to obtain the requisite pH and material composition. All added water used in such preparation is adjusted to the desired hardness. In such a method, the beverage concentrate may be prepared by admixing to water, for example, an acidulant or acidic buffer, vitamins, flavorants, and preservative. An oil-in-water emulsion, which provides opacity and texture to the beverage compositions, can be added to the concentrate. The sugar syrup for. use in preparing the beverage compositions is separately prepared by adding sugar syrup (e.g., high fructose corn syrup) to water, then adding (for example) ascorbic acid, the polyphosphate compound, and thickening agents to the syrup. Additional preservative may be added to the resulting sugar syrup. The sugar syrup and concentrate are combined to form a beverage composition. The beverage composition can be trimmed with added water, sugar syrup, and beverage concentrate to achieve the requisite acidity and composition of the beverage composition of utilized in the present invention. It should be understood that the foregoing serves as a non-limiting example and that other methods may be utilized to prepare the beverage compositions herein. Other well known and conventional variations of the foregoing can, therefore, by utilized to prepare the beverage compositions herein.<br>
