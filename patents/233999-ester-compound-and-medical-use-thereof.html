ESTER COMPOUND AND MEDICAL USE THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel ester compound,<br>
and also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
novel ester compound which selectively inhibits microspmal<br>
triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in the small intestine or<br>
a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of<br>
either. Further, the present invention relates to an agent for<br>
the treatment or prophylaxis of hyperlipidemia,<br>
arteriosclerosis, coronary artery diseases, obesity, diabetes<br>
or hypertension comprising a novel ester compound which<br>
selectively inhibits MTP in the small intestine or a prodrug<br>
thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either as an<br>
active ingredient. In addition, the present invention relates<br>
to an agent for the treatment or prophylaxis of hyperlipidemia,<br>
arteriosclerosis, coronary artery diseases, obesity, diabetes<br>
or hypertension, which has a novel function that has never been<br>
known before.<br>
Background Art<br>
It has been said that hyperlipidemia, diabetes,<br>
hypertension or the like is one of the risk factors for<br>
arteriosclerosis. Hyperlipidemia is a condition where the<br>
concentration of lipid such as cholesterol is abnormally<br>
elevated in the blood. Types of hyperlipidemia, depending on<br>
the cause, include primary hyperlipidemia caused by genetic<br>
abnormality in enzyme, protein, lipoprotein and the like which<br>
participate in the metabolism of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) ,<br>
secondary hyperlipidemia due to various disease or drug<br>
administration, and acquired hyperlipidemia basically<br>
resulting from overnutrition.<br>
Meanwhile, lipid taken in from food is absorbed in the<br>
small intestine by the action of bile acid, and secreted as<br>
chylomicron in the blood via lymphatic vessels. The<br>
triglyceride moiety of the secreted chylomicrons is hydrolyzed<br>
to free fatty acids by the action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL)<br>
existing in capillary vessels to become chylomicron remnants<br>
having a high content of cholesteryl ester (CE), which is then<br>
absorbed in the liver by the mediation of chylomicron remnant<br>
receptor in the liver. Further, in the liver, the absorbed<br>
chylomicron remnant and free fatty acid are converted to CE and<br>
TG, respectively, which are then associated with apolipoprotein<br>
B synthesized on rough surfaced endoplasmic reticulum to form<br>
very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The VLDL is transferred<br>
to the Golgi apparatus, modified and secreted outside cells,<br>
and it becomes intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) by the<br>
action of LPL. The IDL is converted to LDL by the action of<br>
hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL), and lipids are distributed<br>
to peripheral tissues.<br>
It has long been indicated that, during the<br>
above-mentioned formation of chylomicron in the small intestine<br>
or VLDL in the liver, a protein having TG- or CE-transfer<br>
activity is existing in microsomal fractions of the small<br>
intestine or liver. Meanwhile, the protein, i.e. MTP<br>
(microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) was purified and<br>
separated from microsomal fractions of bovine liver by Wetterau<br>
et al. in 1985 (Wetterau J.R. et al: Chem.Phys .Lipids 38,<br>
205-222(1985)). MTP, however, began attracting a lot of<br>
attention in the field of clinical medicine only after it was<br>
reported in 1993 that the cause of abetalipoproteinemia lay in<br>
the deficit of MTP. In other word, the disease is characterized<br>
in that, while the genes related to apolipoprotein B are normal,<br>
apolipoprotein B is hardly detected in the serum, the level of<br>
serum cholesterol is 50mg/dL or lower, the level of serum<br>
triglyceride is extremely low and, moreover, lipoproteins<br>
including apolipoprotein B such as chylomicron, VLDL, LDL, etc.<br>
do not at all exist in the blood. By this finding, it has been<br>
shown that MTP is an integral protein involved in the<br>
association between apolipoprotein B and TG or CE, i.e. the<br>
formation of VLDL or chylomicron, and plays an essential role<br>
in secretion thereof.<br>
Since lipid is by nature insoluble in water, lipid in the<br>
blood is combined with a hydrophilic protein known as<br>
apolipoprotein and exists as so-called lipoprotein. All the<br>
VLDL, IDL, LDL or chylomicron, etc. related to hyperlipidemia<br>
are a lipoprotein.<br>
MTP exists in the microsome fractions of hepatocytes and<br>
intestinal epithelial cells, and catalyses the transfer of TG<br>
or CE in cells. In the liver and small intestine, along with<br>
the synthesis of apolipoprotein (apolipoprotein B100 in the<br>
liver and apolipoprotein B48 in the small intestine), TG and<br>
CE are combined with respective apolipoprotein B by the transfer<br>
activity of MTP, and thus VLDL or chylomicron is formed. As<br>
a result, those lipoproteins are secreted outside the cells as<br>
VLDL in the liver or as chylomicron in the small intestine. It<br>
should be said that MTP is indispensable for the construction<br>
of those lipoproteins. Namely, if the activity of MTP is<br>
blocked, the transfer of lipid such as TG and CE, etc. to<br>
apolipoprotein is inhibited, whereby formation of a lipoprotein<br>
can be inhibited.<br>
On the other hand, it has been elucidated that LDL in<br>
general is closely related to the progression of<br>
arteriosclerosis. That is, LDL permeating endothelium of<br>
blood vessels is deposited in intercellular matrix of vessel<br>
wall, where oxidative denaturation takes place and lipid<br>
peroxides or denaturated proteins induce a series of<br>
inflammation reactions. Consequently, macrophage invasion,<br>
leading to lipid deposit or foaming cells, migration or<br>
proliferation of smooth muscle cells and increase in<br>
intercellular matrix, etc. take place, which leads to the<br>
development of arteriosclerosis plaque. On the basis of the<br>
above, it is supposed to be possible to prevent or treat<br>
arteriosclerosis, coronary artery diseases or hypertension by<br>
reducing the level of LDL.<br>
As already mentioned, it is possible to inhibit the<br>
formation of lipoprotein such as chylomicron, VLDL, LDL, etc.<br>
by inhibiting the action of MTP. Accordingly, it has been<br>
expected that it should become possible to control lipoprotein<br>
such as TG, cholesterol and LDL, etc. in blood and to control<br>
lipid in cells by adjusting the activity of MTP, and therefore,<br>
a novel agent for the treatment or prophylaxis of hyperlipidemia,<br>
arteriosclerosis, coronary artery diseases, diabetes, obesity,<br>
or hypertension, and further, an agent for the treatment or<br>
prophylaxis of pancreatitis, hypercholesterolemia,<br>
hyperglyceridemia, etc. has been expected to be provided.<br>
However, with the development of MTP inhibitors, some<br>
cases of fatty liver were reported and concern over<br>
hepatotoxicity has been raised.<br>
For these reasons, a novel MTP inhibitor causing no side<br>
effect such as a fatty liver, etc. has been strongly desired.<br>
In the conventional manners, combined therapies of<br>
various combinations of different antihyperlipidemic drugs<br>
have been tried. However, when, for example, a statin-type drug<br>
and a resin-type drtfg are given together, undesirable side<br>
effects such as increased GTO and GPT, constipation, blocking<br>
of absorption of vitamin A, D, E and K and the like are observed.<br>
On the other hand, when a statin-type drug and a fibrate drug<br>
are given together, side effects such as rhabdomyolysis or<br>
increased CPK (creative phosphokinase) are observed. Thus,<br>
with regard to a combined therapy for hyperlipidemia, a<br>
medicament for a combined administration which can be<br>
administered in combination with a conventional<br>
antihyperlipidemic drug without causing any above-mentioned<br>
side effect has been desired.<br>
Meanwhile, examples of the known compound having MTP<br>
inhibitory activity with a similar structure of the compounds<br>
of the present invention are described below.<br>
The following compound is disclosed in WO97/26240.<br>

The following compound is disclosed in WO2002/4403.<br>
In the above literatures, however, there is no disclosure<br>
of a compound comprising ester as the essential structure as<br>
that disclosed in the present invention, much less the<br>
disclosure of the data indicating that when a compound has the<br>
structure disclosed in the present invention, the compound<br>
selectively inhibits MTP in the small intestine while rarely<br>
affects MTP in the liver.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Although the development of new antihyperlipidemic drugs<br>
working due to its MTP inhibitory activity has been advanced<br>
nowadays, those drugs are not satisfactory in terms of the level<br>
of action and the accompanying side effect such as a fatty liver,<br>
etc. Thus, the development of an antihyperlipidemic drug<br>
causing no side effect against the liver that is seen in the<br>
case of conventional MTP inhibitors and also having excellent<br>
MTP inhibitory activity has been strongly desired.<br>
The inventors and those involved in the present invention<br>
have carried out intensive studies to provide a novel MTP<br>
inhibitor causing no above-mentioned side effect such as a fatty<br>
liver. As a result, they have found that an MTP inhibitor, which<br>
selectively inhibits MTP in the small intestine but<br>
substantially does not inhibit MTP in the liver, significantly<br>
lowers the level of unnecessary TG or cholesterol without<br>
causing a side effect such as a fatty liver etc. Surprisingly,<br>
they have also found that the compound having ester structure<br>
represented by the below-mentioned formula (1) is immediately<br>
metabolized in the small intestine, blood or liver, which makes<br>
it possible for the compound to selectively affect MTP in the<br>
small intestine without substantially inhibiting MTP in the<br>
liver.<br>
To be more specific, according to the conventional drug<br>
design concept for the preparation of a prodrug, the carboxylic<br>
acid which is the active principle is esterif ied to improve the<br>
absorption rate in the small intestine and is immediately<br>
metabolized in blood to reproduce carboxylic acid which is the<br>
active principle . On the other hand, a drug design concept that<br>
is different from the above concept for the preparation of a<br>
prodrug is used in the present invention. Namely, by<br>
introducing at least one ester in a molecular body of a compound<br>
having MTP inhibitory activity, the compound is , after it exerts<br>
MTP inhibitory activity on mucous membranes of the small<br>
intestine, immediately metabolized by an esterase or a<br>
metabolic enzyme, etc. in the small intestine, portal (blood)<br>
and liver to be transformed to corresponding carboxylic acid<br>
and alcohol which do not have MTP inhibitory activity. This<br>
is completely a new concept, by means of which MTP in the liver<br>
is not substantially affected and MTP in the small intestine<br>
is selectively inhibited. Further, the compounds of the<br>
present invention show strong MTP inhibitory activity in vitro,<br>
thus potently inhibit MTP in the small intestine and<br>
significantly lower triglyceride and cholesterol in blood. In<br>
addition, the compounds of the present invention significantly<br>
lower non-HDL cholesterol and, surprisingly, increase plasma<br>
HDL cholesterol.<br>
Accordingly, the inventors of the present invention have<br>
found that when a compound comprises the ester structure<br>
represented by the below-mentioned formula (1), the compound<br>
is immediately metabolized in the small intestine, blood or<br>
liver after it strongly inhibits MTP in the small intestine and<br>
hence MTP in the liver is not substantially inhibited, whereby<br>
they have completed the present invention.<br>

"MTP in the small intestine" refers to the MTP existing<br>
in small intestinal epithelial cells.<br>
"MTP in the liver" refers to the MTP existing in hepatic<br>
cells.<br>
The expression "selectively inhibit MTP in the small<br>
intestine" means the level of inhibition is at least about 5<br>
times higher, preferably about 10 times higher, than MTP<br>
inhibition in other parts of body such as liver and heart,<br>
especially liver. To be more specific, on the basis of S9<br>
metabolic stability test, it means that in the test using human<br>
or hamster S9 the remaining rate of unaltered form 10 minutes<br>
after the treatment with small intestine S9 is about 10 times<br>
or more higher than that in the case of the treatment with liver<br>
S9 (see Test Example 7).<br>
The expression "it is metabolized to the amount at which<br>
the remaining MTP inhibitor in the liver does not substantially<br>
inhibit the MTP in the liver" means that almost all of the orally<br>
administered MTP inhibitors are metabolized to an inactive<br>
metabolite before arriving at the liver or at the moment of<br>
arriving at the liver and show substantially no MTP inhibitory<br>
activity in the liver, i.e. the MTP inhibitors are converted<br>
to those that do not substantially inhibit TG release from the<br>
liver. More specifically, it means the condition where<br>
TG-releasing activity of the liver is kept at the level of about<br>
80% or more, preferably about 90% or more, more preferably 100%<br>
of the normal level. In terms of metabolism, it means that the<br>
ratio of inactive metabolite to unaltered form in portal vein<br>
blood is approximately 8 or more to 1 one hour after the oral<br>
administration to hamsters, i.e. about 80% or more of the agent<br>
(compound) is metabolized before arriving at the liver (see Test<br>
Example 6), or on the basis of liver S9 metabolic stability test,<br>
it means that 10 minutes after the test using human or hamster<br>
S9 the remaining rate of unaltered form is about 20% or less,<br>
preferably about 10% or less, more preferably about 8% or less<br>
(see Test Example 7).<br>
The expression "MTP inhibitor does not substantially<br>
inhibit MTP in the liver" has essentially the same meaning with<br>
the above "it is metabolized to the amount at which the remaining<br>
MTP inhibitor in the liver does not substantially inhibit the<br>
MTP in the liver", and means the condition where TG-releasing<br>
activity of the liver is kept at the level of about 80% or more,<br>
preferably about 90% or more, more preferably 100% of the normal<br>
level.<br>

Inhibition of interliposomal triglyceride (TG) transfer<br>
activity by MTP<br>
Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) from<br>
bovine liver was partially purified in such a way described<br>
below. A buffer (50 mM Tris, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02%<br>
NaN3 (pH 7.4)) for making a homogenate preparation was added<br>
to bovine liver, and the mixture was homogenated under<br>
ice-cooling, then centrifuged at 10,000 x g (4°C, 30 minutes) .<br>
The supernatant was adjusted to pH 5.1 with hydrochloric acid,<br>
and stirred for 30 minutes. The solution was further<br>
centrifuged at 10 , 000 x g ( 4°C, 30 minutes ) , and 1 mM Tris buffer<br>
was added to the precipitated residue, and the mixture was<br>
adjusted to pH 8.6 with sodium hydroxide. After addition of<br>
2 . 7M ammonium sulfate solution, the mixture was stirred for 30<br>
minutes, then centrifuged at 10,000 x g (4°C, 40 minutes) . The<br>
resulting supernatant was served as a crude extraction fraction<br>
of MTP and stored at -80°C under freezing. In its practical<br>
use, the crude extraction fraction of MTP was purified by column<br>
chromatography on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) Sepharose using<br>
FPLC (Fast Performance Liquid Chromatography) system, and the<br>
purified MTP was used for the test.<br>
Small unilamellar-vesicle (SUV) liposome (donor, 0.25<br>
mol% triolein, 5 mol% cardiolipin) labeled with 14C-triolein<br>
and non-labeled SUV liposome (acceptor, 0.25 mol% triolein)<br>
were prepared. A fixed amount of donor and acceptor, and MTP<br>
were mixed with a sample dissolved in DMSO or with DMSO. The<br>
mixture was incubated in a 15 mM Tris hydrochloride buffer (pH<br>
7.4) containing 40 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA<br>
(ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 0.02% NaN3 and 0.5% bovine<br>
serum albumin at 37°C for one hour. After completion of the<br>
incubation, a suspension of DEAE cellulose (50% v/v) in 15 mM<br>
Tris hydrochloride buffer (pH 7.4) was added to the above<br>
solution, and the mixture was centrifuged to separate the donor<br>
and the acceptor. The radioactivity in the acceptor was<br>
measured by liquid scintillation counter. The value obtained<br>
by subtracting the radioactivity in the blank from the amount<br>
of radioactivity in the acceptor of a DMSO group was determined<br>
as MTP-mediated TG transfer activity, and it was compared with<br>
the value obtained by subtracting the radioactivity in the blank<br>
from the radioactivity in a sample group. The blank was<br>
prepared by adding 15 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) in place of<br>
MTP. Inhibition rate (%) was calculated from the values<br>
obtained according to the following equation.<br>
Inhibition rate (%) = 100 x (1 minus ((radioactivity of<br>
sample group minus radioactivity of blank group)/<br>
(radioactivity of DMSO group minus radioactivity of blank<br>
group))).<br>
50% Inhibition rate (IC50) was determined on the basis<br>
of the above equation. The results were shown in Table 6 6 to<br>
70.<br>
Test Example 2<br>
Inhibition of apolipoprotein B secretion from HepG2 cells<br>
HepG2 cells were suspended in Dulbecco' s Modified Eagle' s<br>
Medium (DMEM)(containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL<br>
penicillin and 100 ng/mL streptomycin) , and placed on a 96-well<br>
plate (4 x 104 cells/well), then incubated for 24 hours. After<br>
removal of the medium, DMEM was replaced by a medium containing<br>
a sample dissolved in DMSO or a medium containing DMSO<br>
(concentration of DMSO: 0.5%) and incubation was further<br>
performed for 24 hours, after which the supernatant was<br>
recovered, and concentration of apo B in the supernatant was<br>
assayed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)<br>
ELISA was carried out as follows. Anti-human apo B<br>
monoclonal antibody (0.5 mg/well) diluted with a solution of<br>
sodium carbonate in sodium bicarbonate buffer (50 mL, pH 9.6)<br>
was placed in a 96-well plate for ELISA, and allowed to stand<br>
at room temperature for 15 hours. After washing the plate, a<br>
blocking solution (250 mL/well) was placed in the well, and<br>
allowed to stand at room temperature for 1.5 hours. After<br>
washing the plate, a standard and a sample (100 mL/well) were<br>
placed in the well and allowed to stand at room temperature<br>
for one hour. The standard was prepared by adjusting the<br>
concentration of the purified human apo B with the DMEM to 0<br>
to 1000ng/mL. After washing the plate, an anti-human apo B<br>
polyclonal antibody labeled with a horse radish peroxidase<br>
which was diluted in 1:1000 with DEME (100 mL/well) , and allowed<br>
to stand at room temperature for one hour. After washing the<br>
plate, 2,2-azinobis(3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)<br>
solution (100 mL/well) was placed in the well, and allowed to<br><br>
stand at room temperature for one hour. The reaction was<br>
stopped by addition of 2% oxalic acid (100 mL / well), and<br>
absorbency at 405 nm was measured. Concentration of apo B in<br>
the sample was calculated on the basis of a standard curve of<br>
the standard. Inhibition rate (%) was calculated from the<br>
assayed values in accordance with the following equation.<br>
Inhibition rate (%) = 100 x (1 minus (concentration of<br>
apo B in sample group/concentration of apo B in DMSO group) .<br>
Based on the above equation, 50% inhibition concentration<br>
(IC50) was determined.<br>
The results were shown in Tables 66 to 70.<br><br>

orbital venous plexus 4 hours later. Plasma was recovered from<br>
the blood, and the amount of triglyceride (TG) in the plasma<br>
was determined by automatic analyzer (Hitachi Co.). The data<br>
was expressed in terms of ATG(mg/dL)=the value at 4th hr minus<br>
the value before administration. Inhibition rate (%) was<br>
calculated from the data obtained on the basis of the following<br>
equation.<br>
Inhibition rate ( % ) =100 x (1 minus ATG of sample group/ATG<br>
of control group). The results were shown in Table 71.<br><br>

a sample was forced to be administered orally to the hamsters<br>
at a dose of 30, 100 or 300 mg/2 mL/kg, and the same amount of<br>
vehicle was administered to the control group. Triton WR 1339<br>
(2 mL/kg) was intravenously administered to the hamsters 30<br>
minutes after the above administration. Two hours later, blood<br>
was collected from orbital venous plexus, and plasma was<br>
separated from the blood. The amount of TG in the plasma was<br>
determined by automatic analyzer (Hitachi Co.). The data was<br>
expressed in terms of TG release velocity (mg/dL/min)=(value<br>
at 2nd hour minus value before administration) /120 . Inhibition<br>
rate (%) was calculated from the data obtained on the basis of<br>
the following equation.<br>

100 mg/2 mL/kg. After a fixed period of time, blood was partly<br>
collected from orbital venous plexus, and the hamsters were<br>
subjected to laparotomy under ether anesthesia, and then blood<br>
was collected from portal vein. The blood was immediately<br>
cooled with ice to separate plasma. A portion of the plasma<br>
was extracted with an organic solvent and the supernatant was<br>
recovered. Concentration of the sample (unchanged form) and<br>
that of the metabolite in the supernatant were determined<br>
quantitatively by high performance liquid chromatography/mass<br>
spectrometry (LC/MS) comparing with chromatogram of synthetic<br>
standard.<br><br>

concentration: 2 mg protein/mL) were each suspended in 100 mM<br>
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, containing b-nicotinamide<br>
adenine dinucleotide phosphate: 1.3 mM, D-glucose-6-<br>
phosphate: 3.3 mM, magnesium chloride: 3.3 mM,<br>
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase :0.4 U/mL ) . The suspensions<br>
were mixed with a solution of a sample (Example 2-5) in DMSO.<br>
The solutions were incubated at 37°C for 0, 10 and 60 minutes,<br>
and an organic solvent was added thereto. The solutions were<br>
centrifuged, and the concentration of the sample (unchanged<br>
form) in the supernatant was determined by high performance<br>
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) . Based on the<br>
data obtained, remaining rate (%) was calculated according to<br>
the following equation.<br>
Remaining rate(%)=amount of sample 10 or 60 minutes after<br>
incubation/amount of sample at zero time after incubation x 100<br><br>
Test Example 8<br>
Inhibitory activity on MTP and apo B secretion inhibition by<br>
metabolites<br>
In a similar manner to Test Examples 1 and 2 , the activity<br>
of metabolites was assayed. The results were shown in Table<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
It is apparent from the above Test Examples 1 to 3 that<br>
novel compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
of the present invention possess excellent MTP inhibition<br>
activity and also strongly inhibit absorption of triglyceride.<br>
In addition, as is apparent from Test Example 4, even when<br>
compounds of the present invention are administered at high<br>
dose, inhibition rate of liver TG release is 18-19 % or lower,<br>
more effectively 9 % or lower, especially effectively 0 % or<br>
lower, and thus the compounds of the present invention inhibit<br>
little of liver TG release. Further, Test Example 6 reveals<br>
that active compounds after absorption in the small intestine<br>
are present in portal vein in a very small amount, and since<br>
most (8-fold to 80-fold amount) of such active compounds are<br>
metabolites, they do not reach the liver. Furthermore, it is<br>
deduced from Test Example 7 that a small amount of active<br>
compound which has reached the liver is metabolized rapidly<br>
to a metabolite. In addition. Test Example 8 proves that ester<br>
moiety of these metabolites is cleaved by hydrolysis and thus<br>
they have little or no MTP inhibitory activity. Further, Test<br>
Example 5 reveals that combination use of the compounds of the<br>
present invention with other agents for treating<br>
hyperlipidemia (statin type agents) can remarkably inhibit the<br>
increase of cholesterol and exhibit extremely excellent<br>
synergistic effect. These facts elucidate that the compounds<br>
of the present invention can be used in combination with other<br>
agents, particularly other agents for treating hyperlipidemia,<br>
arteriosclerosis, coronary artery diseases, obesity, diabetes<br>
or hypertension.<br>
From the fact as mentioned above, it is understood that<br>
novel compounds of the present invention and their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts can inhibit lipid<br>
absorption in the small intestine and further do not inhibit<br>
TG release in the liver. This means that the compounds of this<br>
invention do not inhibit MTP in the liver, but selectively<br>
inhibit MTP in the small intestine.<br>
Therefore, selective inhibition of MTP activity in the<br>
small intestine by the compounds of the present invention should<br>
lower lipid absorption, which makes it possible to control<br>
lipoproteins such as triglyceride, cholesterol and LDL, etc.<br>
in blood or to control lipid in cells. Further, since the<br>
 compounds of the present invention do not affect liver MTP,<br>
accumulation of triglyceride does not occur in the liver.<br>
Consequently, inhibition of fatty liver generation as an<br>
adverse effect might be expected. Therefore, the compounds of<br>
the present invention can be said novel MTP inhibitors having<br>
no side effects such as a fatty liver, etc. or, in other words,<br>
they are novel agents for the treatment or prophylaxis of<br>
hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis, coronary artery diseases,<br>
obesity, diabetes or hypertension, and further for the<br>
treatment or prophylaxis of pancreatitis,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, etc., which<br>
rarely act on MTP in the liver and do substantially inhibit only<br>
MTP in the small intestine.<br>
