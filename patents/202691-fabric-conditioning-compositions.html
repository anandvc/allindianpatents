PCT/EP02/.10107<br><br>
FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention <br>
The present invention relates to fabric conditioning compositions.  More specifically, the invention relates to stable fabric-softening compositions comprising an ester-linked quaternary ammonium compound, an emulsified silicone                    and a long chain fatty compound.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is well known to provide liquid fabric conditioning<br>
compositions, which soften in the rinse cycle.<br>
Such compositions comprise less than 7.5% by weight of softening active, in which case the composition is defined as "dilute", from 7.5% to about 3 0% by weight of active in which case the compositions are defined as "concentrated" or more than about 30% by weight of active, in which case the composition is defined as "super-concentrated". <br>
Concentrated and super-concentrated compositions are desirable since these require less packaging and are therefore environmentally more compatible than dilute or semi-dilute compositions. <br>
A problem frequently associated with concentrated and superconcentrated compositions, as defined above, is that the product is not stable upon storage, especially when<br><br>
WO 03/022969<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10.107<br><br>
stored at high temperatures.  Instability can manifest itself as a thickening of the product upon storage, even to the point that the product is no longer pourable.<br>
   The problem of thickening upon storage is particularly apparent in concentrated and superconcentrated fabric softening compositions comprising an ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening material having one or more fully saturated alkyl chains.<br><br>
However, it is desirable to use ester-linked compounds due to their inherent biodegradability and to use substantially fully saturated quaternary ammonium fabric softening compounds due to their excellent softening capabilities and<br>
     because they are more stable to oxidative degradation (which can lead to malodour generation) than partially saturated or fully unsaturated quaternary ammonium softening compounds.<br>
Of the types of ester-linked quaternary ammonium materials  known, it is desirable to use those based on triethanolamine which produce at least some mono-ester linked component and at least some tri-ester linked component since the raw material" has-a* low 'melting- temperature- which'- â€¢enables' 'the"  manufacturing process of the composition to occur at low                                                   temperatures.  This reduces difficulties associated with high temperature handling, transport and processing of the raw material and compositions produced therefrom.<br>
Frequently, it is desirable to add further ingredients into  fabric conditioning compositions in order to provide additional benefits.<br><br>
WO 03/022969<br><br>
PCT/EP02/.10107<br><br>
One such additional ingredient is an emulsified silicone. Emulsified silicones are desirable because they can provide fabric-conditioning compositions with anti-crease and ease                   of ironing benefits.<br>
WO-A1-00/71806 discloses a fabric softening composition comprising a cationic fabric softening agent; and an emulsified silicone; wherein the viscosity of the silicone<br>
     before emulsification is from 10,OOOcSt to 1,000,OOOcSt, preferably from 30,000cSt to 750,000cSt, more preferably from 40,OOOcSt to 300,000cSt and the emulsion is a macro-emulsion and the median droplet size of the emulsion particles is preferably from 0.39/im to 25/im.<br><br>
WO-A1-00/71807 discloses a method of stabilising fabric softener compositions during high temperature storage.  The examples show that by incorporating 3.5 to 15% by weight of a silicone emulsion into concentrated fabric conditioning<br>
    compositions comprising 1,2-dihardened tallowoyloxyethyl, 3 tri-methyl ammoniopropane chloride (a quaternary ammonium material) high temperature storage stability is improved.<br>
However, it has been found that a conditioning composition     comprising a quaternary ammonium material based on<br>
triethanolamine, especially when the quaternary ammonium material contains saturated hydrocarbyl groups, can suffer from instability upon storage especially at high temperature when an emulsified silicone is present therein.<br><br>
WO 03/022969<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10107<br><br>
It is believed that this is due mainly to depletion flocculation.<br>
"Depletion flocculation" was first recorded by Asakura and Oosawa in 1954 (J. Chem. Phys. 1354, 22, 1255) when they showed that the addition of a non-adsorbing polymer to a dispersion of colloidal particles led to an effective attractive interaction between them - flocculation.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that quaternary ammonium materials based on triethanolamine are prone to depletion flocculation due to the presence of mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium species present in the continuous phase of the composition (i.e. mixed micelles). The introduction of an emulsified silicone exacerbates depletion flocculation by, firstly, liberating greater quantities of the mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium species into the continuous phase and, secondly, by the significant size difference between the particles present in the composition (i.e. between the smaller particles of the silicone emulsion and the larger liposomes of the quaternary ammonium material based on triethanolamine).<br>
US 5336419 discloses a nonionic emulsified silicone gel for ease of ironing and better looking garments. The softener dispersions range from 5.3 to 24wt% of a mixed softener system with 1 to 2.4wt% of a silicone emulsion.<br>
WO 98/50502 discloses compositions comprising softening compounds based on triethanolamine and silicone emulsion mixtures.<br><br>
WO 03/022969<br><br>
PCT/EP02/.10107<br><br><br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The present invention seeks to address one or more of the above-mentioned problems, and, to give one or more of the above-mentioned benefits desired by consumers.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that by incorporating a fatty component which comprises a long alkyl chain, such as fatty<br>
    alcohols or fatty acids (hereinafter referred to as "fatty complexing agents") into softening compositions comprising a quaternary ammonium softening material having substantially fully saturated alkyl chains, at least some mono-ester component and at least some tri-ester component, and an<br>
     emulsified silicone which comprises a nonionic emulsifier, wherein the fatty complexing agent is present in an amount significantly greater than normally present in traditional fabric softening compositions, then the stability and initial viscosity of the composition can be dramatically<br>
    improved.  In particular, undesirable thickening of the<br>
composition upon storage at high temperature can be avoided.<br>
In, the-, con text of*- the ^ present- invention-;* "-high- temperature'<br>
storage" denotes storage at 37 C or above.<br><br>

The level of the mono-ester linked component of the quaternary ammonium material used in the compositions of the invention is preferably between 8 and 40% by weight, based                                on the total weight of the raw material in which the quaternary ammonium material is supplied.<br>
The level of the tri-ester-linked component is preferably between 20 and 50% based on the total weight of the raw                        material in which the quaternary ammonium material is supplied.<br>

PCT/EP02/10107<br><br>
Iodine Value., of . the parent Patty Acyl group or Acid<br>
The iodine value of the parent fatty acyl compound or acid from which the quaternary ammonium fabric softening materialis    formed is from 0 to 20, preferably from 0 to 5, more<br>
preferably from 0 to 2.  Most preferably the iodine value of the parent fatty acid or acyl group from which the quaternary ammonium fabric softening material is formed is from 0 to 1.  That is, it is preferred that the alkyl or                         alkenyl chains are substantially fully saturated.<br>
If there is any unsaturated quaternary ammonium fabric softening material present in the composition, the iodine value, referred to above, represents the mean iodine value                                    of the parent fatty acyl compounds or fatty acids of the unsaturated material together and the (substantially) saturated fabric softening material.<br>
In the context of the present invention, iodine value of the   parent fatty acyl compound or acid from which the fabric<br>
softening material formed, is defined as the number of grams of iodine which react with 100 grams of the compound.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the method for calculating the iodine value of a parent fatty acyl<br>
compound/acid comprises dissolving a prescribed amount (from 0.1-3g) into about 15ml chloroform.  The dissolved parent fatty acyl compound/fatty acid is then reacted with 25 ml of iodine monochloride in acetic acid solution (0.1M).  To                           this, 20ml of 10% potassium iodide solution and about 150-ml deionised water is added.  After addition of the halogen has<br><br>
WO 03/022969<br><br>
PCT/EP02/.10107<br><br>
taken-place,- the excesa. of., iodine monochloride is determined'" by titration with sodium thiosulphate solution (0.1M) in the presence of a blue starch indicator powder. At the same time a blank is determined with the same quantity of                     reagents and under the same conditions.  The difference<br>
between the volume of sodium thiosulphate used in the blank and that used in the reaction with the parent fatty acyl compound or fatty acid enables the iodine value to be calculated.<br><br>
The quaternary ammonium fabric softening material of formula (I) is present in an amount from about 7.5 to 80% by weight of quaternary ammonium material (active ingredient) based on the total weight of the composition, more preferably 10 to<br>
    50% by weight, most preferably 11 to 40% by weight, e.g. 12.5-25% by weight.<br>
Excluded quaternary ammonium compounds<br>
    Quaternary ammonium fabric softening materials which are<br>
free of ester linkages or, if ester-linked, do not comprise at least some monoester linked component and some tri-ester linked component are excluded from the"scope of the present--invention.  For instance, quaternary ammonium compounds<br>
    having the following formulae are excluded:<br><br><br>
WO 03/022969<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10107<br><br><br><br>
wherein R , R , T, n and X are as defined above; and<br>
R3<br>
I Ri â€” N+ â€” R2        X"<br>
I R4<br>
where R1 to R4 are not interrupted by ester-links, Ri and R2 are C8-28 alkyl or alkenyl groups; R3 and R4 are C1-4 alkyl or C2-4 alkenyl groups and X is as defined above.<br>
Fatty complexing agent<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise a fatty complexing agent.<br>
Suitable fatty complexing agents include fatty alcohols and fatty acids.  Of these,- fatty alcohols are most preferred.<br><br>
WO 03/022969<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10107<br><br>
Without wishing to be bound-by theory-, it is believed that the monoester quaternary ammonium species of the quaternary ammonium material complexes with the fatty complexing material. <br>
It is also believed that the higher monoester levels present in compositions comprising quaternary ammonium materials based on TEA may destabilise the composition through depletion flocculation.  By using the fatty complexing                         material to complex with the monoester component, depletion flocculation is significantly reduced.<br>
In other words, the fatty component at the increased levels, as required by the present invention, "neutralises" the              monoester component of the quaternary ammonium material.<br>
The applicants also believe that that the complexing of the monoester linked component (which does not contribute to softening) with the fatty complexing material thereby                 provides a material, which does contribute to softening.<br>
The applicants further believe that the presence of the fatty complexing agent \n  the compositions of the invention reduces the size of the liposomes (of the quaternary                          ammonium material) present.  The size disparity betweeri-the liposomes and the emulsified silicone particles is therefore smaller and, therefore, depletion flocculation is reduced.<br>
Preferred fatty acids include hardened tallow fatty acid   (available under the tradename Pristerene, ex Uniqema).<br><br>
WO 03/022969<br><br>
PCT/EP02/.10.107<br><br>
Preferred"fatty alcohols-include hardened tallow alcohol (available under the tradenames Stenol and Hydrenol, ex Cognis and Laurex CS, ex Albright and Wilson) and behenyl alcohol, a C22 chain alcohol, available as Lanette 22 (ex 5  Henkel).<br>
The fatty complexing agent is present in an amount within the range 0.9% to 15% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.  More preferably, the fatty component is D  present in an amount of from 1.2 to 10%, most preferably from 1.5 to 5%, e.g. 1.6 to 4% by weight.<br>
The weight ratio of the mono-ester component of the quaternary ammonium fabric softening material to the fatty 3  complexing agent is preferably from 5:1 to 1:5, more<br>
preferably 4:1 to 1:4, most preferably 3:1 to 1:3, e.g. 2:1 to 1:2.<br>
Calculation of Mono-ester Linked Component of the Quaternary   Ammonium Material<br>
The quantitative analysis of mono-ester linked component of the quaternary ammonrum material is carried out through the" use of Quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy with inverse gated i  XH decoupling scheme.<br>
The sample of known mass of the quaternary ammonium raw material is first dissolved in a known volume of CDC13 along with a known amount of an assay material such as   naphthalene. A 13C NMR spectrum of this solution is then<br>
recorded using both an inverse gated decoupling scheme and a<br><br>
WO 03/022969<br><br>
PCT/EP02/.10107<br><br>
relaxation agent.- The-inverse gated decoupling scheme is used to ensure that any Overhauser effects are suppressed whilst the relaxation agent is used to ensure that the negative consequences of the long tj relaxation times are                 overcome (i.e. adequate signal-to-noise can be achieved in a reasonable timescale) .<br>
The signal intensities of characteristic peaks of both the carbon atoms in the quaternary ammonium material and the<br>
    naphthalene are used to calculate the concentration of the monoester-linked component of the quaternary ammonium<br>
       m^t-p-H al	in the quaternary ammonium material, the signal<br>
represents the carbon of the nitrogen-methyl group on the quaternary ammonium head group.  The chemical shift of the<br>
    nitrogen-methyl group varies slightly due to the different degree of esterification; characteristic chemical shifts for the mono-, di- and tri-ester links are 48.28, 47.97 and 47.76 ppm respectively.  Any of the peaks due to the napthalene carbons that are free of interference from other<br>
  components can then be used to calculate the mass of mono-ester linked component present in the sample as follows:-<br><br>
    where MassMQ = mass mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium<br>
material in mg/ml, massNaph = mass naphthalene in mg/ml, I = peak intensity, N = number of contributing nuclei and M = relative molecular mass.  The relative molecular mass of naphthalene used is 128.17 and the relative molecular mass<br><br>
WO 03/022969<br><br>
PCT/EP02/10107<br><br>
Of the mono-ester-linked-component of the quaternary ammonium material is taken as 526.<br>
The weight percentage of mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in the raw material can thus be calculated:<br>
% of mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in the raw material =   <br>
where mass HT-TEA = mass of the quaternary ammonium material and both mass MQ and mass HT-TEA are expressed as mg/ml.<br>

Emulsified Silicone<br>

Although silicones emulsified with a cationic emulsifier can, when in the presence of a quaternary ammonium material having at least one mono-ester linked component and at least one tri-ester linked component, deliver anti-crease and ease of ironing benefits, they are found to be less stable than such compositions comprising nonionically emulsified silicones.  Therefore, for the purposes of the present invention, the emulsifier must not be a cationic emulsifier.<br>
