				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a punching machine With a<br>
mobile carriage.	<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a mobile <br>
carriage punching machine, i.e. of the type that moves along a<br>
beam of the machine to draw up different positions with respect<br>
to the underlying work top.	<br>
As is known, punching machines are used to cut plate-or sheet-like laminar materials and to obtain from them half-worked products having a specific shape. The typical use of this material is in the footwear and leather goods sector, wherein materials such as skin and leather constitute the base to obtain shoes, bags, belts and the like. Said materials, that may also be of a synthetic type, have the shape of sheets, slabs, having a regular or irregular configuration and are placed on the work top of the punching machine ; the worker places on the material the punches, constituted by shaped metal frames with a cutting edge, and then activates the machine to cause the descent of the striking or pressing unit on said punches. In this way, the material is cut according to the shape desired, corresponding to the profile of the punches.<br>
Different types of punching machines, utilized alternatively according to the specific working needs, are known. The more compact, lower power ones are the so-called<br>
-1A-<br><br>
ram punching machines that are hand-oriented with respect to the work top. Other so-called mobile bridge punching machines comprise a pressure plane that covers substantially the whole work top, of a remarkable width.<br>
There also exist the so-called mobile carriage-punching machines that, because of their characteristics of size, power and costs, position between ram machines and mobile bridge machines. The traditional structure of mobile carriage punching machines comprises a basement that integrates the work top and a longitudinally extended upper beam; along which the carriage is slidingly guided. The latter, because of it high weight, is moved along the beam by means of a motor, activated by the worker; the lowering of the ramming plate obtained in the carriage to compress the punches is realized hydraulically through a power unit integrated in both the carriage and the machine.<br>
The need of having a motor-driven carriage complicates remarkably the construction of the punching machine and also the same carriage, that has to support remarkable stresses; it must be realized taking into account the maximum efforts which it is submitted to Besides, the carriage tends to tilt under strain when it strikes the punches that are decentralized with respect to their gravity center; to limit this drawback, reinforced movement guides must be provided that further complicate the construction and increase the cost of the machine.<br>
The motorization of the carriage determines, among other things, constraints dictated by safety norms, such as for instance<br>
2.<br><br>
the provision of photocells or sensors suitable to automatically interrupt the work phase in progress.<br>
The object of this invention is to obviate the above drawbacks. <br>
More particularly, the object of this invention is to realize a mobile carriage punching machine wherein said carriage needs not being motorized for its movement along the supporting beam.<br>
A further object of this invention is to realize a punching machine provided with a mobile carriage of a very limited weight, and therefore hand-movable, and having high characteristics of resistance to variable loads.<br>
A further object of the invention it to realize a punching machine provided with means that determine constantly the precise alignment of the mobile carriage during the sliding on the bearing beam.<br>
Another object of the invention is to realize a punching machine suitable to prevent tilting effects of the mobile carriage or the bearing beam with which the carriage is associated.<br>
A<br>
A further object of the invention it to provide users with a mobile carriage punching machine, suitable to ensure a high level of resistance and reliability in the time and, also such as to be easily and economically realized.<br>
To achieve these objects, the present invention provides a punching machine with a mobile carriage especially suitable for cutting skin, leather and synthetic materials, said machine comprising a bearing basement having a frame extending upwardly therefrom, a work top<br>
-3-<br><br>
supported on said frame, a block or plate mounted on said work top and made of synthetic material for supporting the material to be punched, and a mobile bridge extending upwardly from said work top characterized in that -	<br>
said mobile bridge comprises a longitudinally extending beam connected at opposite sides thereof to the upper end of at least one side guide, said side guide being provided with at least one sliding bearing, roller or runner striking the sides of said beam, and said side guide being fixed at its lower end to said work top ; and said beam is connected at the lower front thereof to stems of opposite hydraulic pistons for the vertical movement of said beam, said hydraulic pistons being connected to an end of arms or levers, the opposite end of said arms or levers being engaged to each other by indentations.<br>
The construction and the structural and functional characteristics of the punching machine of the present invention will be better understood thanks to the following description, wherein reference is made to the accompanying drawings which represent a non limiting preferred embodiment, and wherein :<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically a front view of the punching machine of the present invention ;<br>
Figure 2 shows schematically a side view of the same machine ;<br>
Figure 3 shows schematically a front view of the mobile carriage of the punching machine of the invention ;<br>
Figure 4 shows schematically a plan view of the same mobile carriage ;<br>
Figure 5 shows schematically a plan view of the carriage of Figures 3 and 4 ;<br>
Figure 6 shows schematically a plan view of the guides of the mobile carriage.<br>
-4-<br><br>
With reference to said drawings, the punching machine of the present invention, indicated as a whole by 10 in Figures 1 and 2, comprises a bearing basement 12 extended into a frame 14 that supports the work top 16, surmounted by a block or slab bearing the material to be punched. From the level of the work top, machine 10 develops upwards in a mobile bridge formed by a longitudinally extended upper beam 20, whose opposite sides are connected to as many side guides 22. Said guides are fixed in the lower part to a work top 16 of frame 14, while in the upper part they have each one or more sliding bearings or rollers 24 which strike the ends or sides of beam 20. The lower edge of beam 20 has, on the opposite front or back sides, a profiled lip 26 that forms lines or tracks orthogonal to each other that serve as striking means for the sliding means 28, 30, connected to the upper part of a mobile carriage 32, of which we shall speak later on.<br>
The profiled lip 26 is constituted by a 90° step that defines, as shown by Figures 6 and 7, adjoining rectilinear surfaces 36, 38, oriented respectively along a parallel plane and along a plane orthogonal with respect to the front and back sides of said beam 20. Means 28, 30 allowing the above mentioned sliding, are constituted, by way of example, by ball or roller bearings, offset from each other and hinged to extensions 40 or the upper plate 42 of carriage 32.<br>
Stems 46 of two or more hydraulic pistons, activated by the power unit of the punching machine 10 starting from a<br>
5<br><br>
conventional motor 50 supported by basement 12 are connected, by means of bolts 44 or the like, to the sides of the lower front of beam 20, preferably in central position in the direction of the depth. Said pistons and the related stems are suitable to move vertically beam 20, to cause the mobile carriage 32 to strike and compress the punches placed on block 18 of the work top 16, above the material to be cut.<br>
Carriage 32 is advantageously obtained from low specific weight material, for instance aluminum or composite materials, and comprises a lower plate 52, parallel oriented to the work top 16 of machine 10, and suitable to strike the punches, as well as said upper plate 42 bearing extensions 40 to which bearings 28, 30 are connected. The body of carriage 32, that develops between plates 52, 54, of quadrangular shape, is constituted by a plurality of columns 54, preferably obtained by extrusion from aluminum or alloys thereof, said columns being provided, along the whole side surface or part thereof, with longitudinally extended integral stiffening flanges.<br>
Column 54, fastened to plates 42, 52 by means known per se, for instance, tie-rods or threaded bars or high resistance bolts, may be alternatively realized from composite materials such as carbon fibers or other materials having a low specific weight and a high mechanical resistance. The number of columns 54 provided with flanges located between said plates is variable according to the power of the punching machine and the load which carriage 32 as a whole is submitted to; the latter may be<br>
6<br><br>
therefore realized in, modular form, i.e. with a different and increasable number of columns, according to the needs of users.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of Figures 1 and 2, the punching<br>
machine 10 is provided, on the opposite front and back sides, with<br>
couples of arms or levers 58, engaged with each other by means of<br>
indentations 60 provided at their ends ; the opposite end of said arms,<br>
indicated by 62, is connected to the hydraulic pistons 48.	<br>
Each lever 58 located on the front or back side of machine 10 is connected to the corresponding lever of the opposite side through a hub 66 with a central key 64 or the like. Because of said levers connected to cylinders 48, the punching machine 10 is always balanced, both during the lowering of beam 20 and on the compression of the punches through carriage 32 and obviously on the reascending of said beam 20.<br>
A handwheel 68, located on beam 20 and mechanically connected through a flexible means to the conventional hydraulic distributor (not shown) incorporated in the bearing basement 12 of machine 10, allows to adjust by hand in a simple and rapid manner the gap desired between carriage 32 and the work top 16, according to the thickness of the material to be punched, the height of the punch to be utilized and the variation in the thickness of the block or plate 18.<br>
As can be inferred from the above, the advantages achieved by the invention are obvious.<br>
In the punching machine of the present invention, the carriage may be advantageously hand-moved, thanks to its<br>
.7.<br><br>
reduced weight and the presence of bearings 28, 30 striking Up 26 formed on the opposite sides of beam 20. Besides, the presence of the side guides 22, stricken by bearings or rollers 24, determines the correct handling of beam 20, protected against tilting effects during the effort of cutting the material to be punched&gt; also in an unbalanced manner, i.e. shifted from the gravity center of beam 20.<br>
However, the invention, as described hereabove and claimed hereafter, has been proposed only by way of non critical example, as the same is susceptible of many changes and variants, all of which fall anyhow within the scope of the invention concept.<br>
