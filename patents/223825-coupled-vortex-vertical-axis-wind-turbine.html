				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of wind turbine generators and specifically to wind turbines that<br>
rotate about a vertical axis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Vertical axis wind turbines have been known for many years. The most common design for a<br>
vertical axis turbine is the Darrius turbine that uses curved blades in a troposkien shape. Other<br>
vertical axis turbines use straight blades that are attached to a vertical shaft with one or more<br>
blades support arms.<br>
Modern vertical axis turbines use airfoils that provide lift rather than using aerodynamic drag to<br>
provide motive force to the rotor. The use of lift-producing airfoils increases the aerodynamic<br>
efficiency of the rotor greatly compared to a drag-type device. However, even with lift-producing<br>
airfoils, conventional vertical axis turbines suffer several disadvantages compared with horizontal<br>
axis turbines. The peak aerodynamic efficiency that most vertical axis wind turbines achieve is<br>
approximately 25-30%. Also, vertical axis wind turbines are not inherently self-starting and<br>
require the use of a starting motor to allow them to begin turning. Several improvements to the<br>
basic vertical axis wind turbine design have attempted to solve the inherent problems.<br>
U.S. Patent No.4,115,027, the Specification of which is incorporated herein by reference,<br>
discloses a vertical axis, lift type windmill. Vertical airfoils that provide aerodynamic lift are<br>
mounted with struts around a central shaft to form a rotor.<br>
U.S. Patents Npo.5,027,696 and 5,332,925, the Specifications of which are incorporated herein<br>
by reference, disclosed various improvements to the windmill of U.S. Patent No. 4,115,027. The<br>
improvements included a new baking system, the use of thick airfoils, a drive belt transmission,<br>
two speed operation, and rotatable stators that improve efficiency and limit structural loads<br>
during high winds.<br>
The disclosures of U.S. Patent Nos.4,156,580 and 5,495,128, are also incorporated herein by way<br>
of reference.<br>
The wind turbines in all of the above-referenced patents utilize stationary<br>
fairings on the outside of the rotor to direct wind flow through the rotor and<br>
increase efficiency. While this approach has been found to significantly improve<br>
the performance of the wind turbine (aerodynamic efficiency has been measured<br>
as high as 52%), it also results in additional structure that must be supported and<br>
it adds planform area which increases the wind loading on the structure during<br>
storm conditions. It would be desirable to achieve similar performance<br>
improvements without the need for structural elements such as stationary<br>
fairings.<br>
The wind turbines of the above referenced patents also utilize a<br>
mechanical braking system that has been found to be very reliable but which also<br>
requires a manual reset after activation. This can lead to high turbine downtime<br>
and low availability if an operator is not present on site full time. It would be<br>
desirable to incorporate a braking system that engages automatically when a<br>
fault occurs in the turbine system and that resets automatically and returns the<br>
turbine to service after a fault condition has been cleared.<br>
It would be desirable to provide a vertical axis wind turbine that achieves<br>
high aerodynamic efficiency while requiring minimal support structure. It would<br>
also be desirable to provide a vertical axis wind turbine that is suitable for use<br>
underneath an existing row of horizontal axis wind turbines in a "bush-tree"<br>
configuration in order to maximize energy production on a parcel of land. It<br>
would further be desirable to provide a vertical axis wind turbine that<br>
incorporates a robust and reliable automatic aerodynamic and mechanical<br>
braking system that self-resets after a fault is cleared. Further, it would be<br>
desirable to minimize maintenance frequency and difficulty by providing easy<br>
access to parts requiring more frequent attention such as the gearbox and<br>
generator. It would be desirable to structurally simplify the turbine even further<br>
by employing a guyed shaft structure or a combination of guyed and externally<br>
supported frame rather than employing an external support frame. An externally<br>
guyed structure would minimize the number of parts required. These structures<br>
can also provide a cleaner aerodynamic flow field to enhance the turbines'<br>
vortex effect. It would be further desirable to enhance the turbines' vortex effect<br>
and improve self-starting capabilities by employing a high solidity rotor.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a wind turbine with increased<br>
aerodynamic efficiency through vortex interaction between two adjacent wind<br>
turbines and by employing high solidity rotors. The vortex interaction is the<br>
result of close placement of adjacent turbines as well as their angular orientation<br>
relative to the direction of the prevailing energy winds. The adjacent turbines<br>
must also rotate in opposite directions in order to achieve the coupled vortex<br>
interaction.<br>
The guyed shaft structure can be placed in close proximity in a row<br>
configuration by employing either a three or four cable support point<br>
configuration in a staggered configuration that provides cable-to-cable and<br>
cable-to-rotor clearance. The wind turbines can be arranged in a long row of<br>
coupled wind turbines with aerodynamic enhancements occurring throughout the<br>
row of turbines. The row of turbines should be oriented perpendicular to the<br>
prevailing energy wind direction. This orientation of turbines is particularly well<br>
suited to geographical areas with a strong prevailing wind direction and little<br>
directional variability.<br>
The row of vortex coupled turbines can be located underneath a row of<br>
horizontal axis turbines. This "bush-tree" configuration maximizes the energy<br>
capture that can be derived from a parcel of land. It is also possible that the<br>
aerodynamic performance of the horizontal axis turbines could be improved<br>
because of the presence of the vertical axis turbines beneath them It is possible<br>
that the row of vertical axis turbines could provide a vertical mixing effect<br>
bringing higher energy flow into the horizontal axis wind turbines' flow field.<br>
The turbine uses a pneumatic braking system that automatically releases<br>
and allows the turbine to resume operation after a fault condition has been<br>
cleared. The pneumatic brake is biased with a weight so that it is normally<br>
applied via the weight and released when a pneumatic cylinder is pressurized to<br>
lift the. brake and the weight A solenoid valve that is normally closed controls<br>
the pressure to the pneumatic cylinder. The valve is electrically activated.<br>
When electrical power is off, the valve opens to release pressure to the cylinder.<br>
When power returns, the valve closes and a compressor pressurizes the cylinder<br>
to lift the weight and release the brake. This assures that the brake will be<br>
applied to stop the turbine in the event of a loss of electrical power and that it<br>
will be released when power is restored. A toggle switch is provided to open the<br>
solenoid valve if power is not lost but if, for some reason, the generator cannot<br>
function.<br>
A linkage couples the mechanical brake with a system to adjust the blade<br>
pitch. When the brakes are applied, the blades pitch 45 degrees to act as a drag<br>
brake. In this way, the turbine has redundant mechanical and aerodynamic<br>
braking for greater reliability.<br>
Turbine parts that experience high wear and that require maintenance are<br>
located at ground level. The guyed shaft of the turbine is supported by a pair of<br>
bearings located at bottom of the shaft. The two bearings are vertically<br>
separated by approximately three feet. The uppermost of the two bearings is<br>
held in a fixed position and supports the static weight of the main shaft only.<br>
The lowermost bearing is free to slide horizontally allowing the guyed shaft to<br>
teeter. The lower bearing supports the weight of the blades and the vertical<br>
forces from aerodynamic drag on the rotor. The load on the upper bearing is low<br>
enough so that the bearing lasts the life of the turbine. The lower bearing is<br>
located where it can be easily removed for cartridge replacement The lower<br>
bearing support is free to move horizontally by employing a simple frame of ball<br>
bearings. '<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the turbine<br>
includes three sets of blades in three stacked modules. Only the blades in the<br>
lowermost module are pitched during braking operations. The bottom set of<br>
blades can easily be reached from ground level for maintenance access. It is<br>
expected that the pitchable set of blades will require higher maintenance than the<br>
other two fixed-pitch sets of blades due to pitching movement during braking.<br>
The wear level on the blades is not expected to be high because braking should<br>
be a relatively infrequent occurrence. The two upper modules employ blades<br>
that are attached with a yoke type attachment with a durable pin connection that<br>
restrains the blades from pitching motion and minimizes wear.<br>
The bearing atop the guyed shaft is enclosed within a cable attachment<br>
housing and isolated from environmental exposure. This is expected to reduce<br>
greasing requirements and minimize wear.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the present invention consists of a wind turbine 1<br>
which has a main shaft 2 which rotates about a vertical axis. The main shaft 2 is<br>
preferably made from steel pipe of sufficient diameter and thickness to withstand<br>
compressive, torque and bending loads both during turbine operation and during<br>
high winds in which the turbine would be stopped. Attached to the main shaft 2<br>
are four blades 3. The number of blades could change as a design choice<br>
although the chord length or rotor diameter would need to change to maintain the<br>
desired solidity. Four blades is the preferred embodiment. Each blade 3 is<br>
attached to the main shaft 2 with a pair of blade arms 4. The preferred<br>
embodiment is to use two blade arms 4 for each blade 3, although it is<br>
conceivable to use a single blade arm 4 for each blade 3. It is also preferred that<br>
the blade arms 4 be freely attached to each blade 3 at the ends of the blade 3 in<br>
order to reduce aerodynamic tip effects on the blades and to avoid blade 3<br>
bending stress atthe blade arm 4 attachment point. It is preferred that the blade<br>
3 be attached to the arm 4 with a moment free connection, such as a pinned<br>
connection.<br>
The height of the rotor H is defined by the length of the blades 3. The<br>
diameter of the rotor D is defined by two times the distance from the shaft 2<br>
centerline to the blade 3 chord line. The total swept area of the rotor is defined<br>
as the rotor height H times the rotor diameter D. Each blade 3 has a planform<br>
area that is defined by the blade's chord width C times the length of the blade H.<br>
The total blade planform area is four times the planform area for an individual<br>
blade because there are four blades in the rotor. The total blade planform area<br>
divided by the rotor area is known as the rotor solidity. For the case of the<br>
present invention, the rotor solidity is preferably 33%. For drag type windmill<br>
rotors, the solidity would be much higher than 33% and is often 100%.<br>
Experimentation has shown that rotor solidity in the range of 30% to 40%<br>
provides optimum performance and a solidity of 33% is preferred.<br>
The main shaft 2 is supported at its lower end in a drive train housing 5<br>
and at its upper end by a bearing 6. The upper bearing is supported by a set of<br>
guy cables 7. The main shaft 2 extends above the top set of blade arms 4 by a<br>
distance that is greater than the length of a blade arm 4 so that the guy cables 7<br>
can be extended at a 45 degree angle to foundations 8 that are buried in the<br>
ground. Figure 1 shows a configuration with three guy cables, although it would<br>
be possible to use four or more guy cables if desired depending on site soil<br>
conditions, topography, and other factors.<br>
Figure 2 shows a second preferred embodiment of the invention in which<br>
the rotor includes three modules 9 stacked one above another. Each module<br>
includes four blades 3 attached to a main shaft 2 via blade arms 4. Each module<br>
9 in the second preferred embodiment is similar to the rotor of the first preferred,<br>
embodiment. The solidity of each rotor module 9 is between 30% to 40% and is<br>
preferably 33%. The three modules 9 shown in Figure 2 are all connected to a<br>
common main shaft 2 so that they rotate together. The blades 3 of the three<br>
modules 9 are staggered by 30 degrees between modules. By staggering the<br>
blades, the output of the wind turbine is smoothed. While three modules are<br>
shown in Figure 2, it would be possible to include two modules or it would be<br>
conceivable to include four or more modules.<br>
If two wind turbines 1 are placed in close proximity to each other, as<br>
shown in Figure 3, the combination of linear flow and vortex flow from the two<br>
rotors combines such that the efficiency of both rotors is increased. Figure 4<br>
shows the two wind turbines in plan view where it can be seen that the turbines<br>
with rotor diameter D have their centerlines spaced apart by a distance L. If L is<br>
slightly larger than D, then the rotors will be spaced apart from each other by a<br>
distance s which is equal to L minus D. The separation s between the two rotors<br>
should be kept as small as possible while allowing for appropriate machine and<br>
personnel safety. A separation of approximately three feet is preferred. This .<br>
close placement of adjacent rotors is referred to as the coupled vortex<br>
arrangement. In the coupled vortex arrangement, the two rotors should rotate in<br>
opposite directions in order to achieve the desired increase in aerodynamic<br>
efficiency. The directions of rotation for the two rotors is depicted by the arrows<br>
in Figure 4.<br>
The wind turbines in the coupled vortex arrangement should be oriented<br>
so that the line connecting the centerlines of the two wind turbines is<br>
perpendicular to the prevailing energy wind direction. Ideally the wind direction<br>
should not vary by more than 20 degrees relative to the direction shown in<br>
Figure 4. At sites with a strong prevailing wind direction, such as is found in<br>
mountain passes, this may be possible to achieve. However at sites without a<br>
dominant prevailing wind direction, the coupled vortex arrangement for the<br>
rotors may not work as well.<br>
As shown in Figure 5 a longer row of wind turbines can be arranged in<br>
the coupled vortex arrangement. When a long row of wind turbines is so<br>
arranged, the centerline of each rotor is separated from the centerline of the<br>
adjacent rotors by a distance L which is only slightly larger than the rotor<br>
diameter D so that there is a small separation s between each pair of rotors. As<br>
shown in Figure 6, each rotor should turn in the opposite direction to its<br>
neighboring turbines, In this way, every second turbine will turn clockwise as<br>
viewed from the top while the turbines in between will turn counter-clockwise as<br>
viewed from the top.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, the row of wind turbines could be locate<br>
underneath a row of horizontal axis wind turbines to form a "bush-tree"<br>
configuration. This allows greater energy extraction from a parcel of land. It<br>
may also increase the performance of the horizontal axis wind turbines by<br>
vertical mixing or replacing lower energy air at lower levels with higher energy<br>
air from above. Another possible synergy of the bush-tree arrangement is that<br>
the foundations for the horizontal axis turbines could be modified to serve as<br>
anchor points for the guy wires that support the vertical axis wind turbines in the<br>
coupled vortex row. This configuration is particularly well-suited to sites with<br>
unidirectional prevailing winds.<br>
The drive train for the wind turbine of the present invention is similar to<br>
that described in U.S. Patent 5,027,696 or 5,332,925, both of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. As shown schematically in Figure 8, the drive<br>
train consists of a shaft mounted gearbox 10 that increases the rotational speed of<br>
the main shaft 2 to a speed that is useful for driving a generator. A belt drive 11<br>
transfers power from the gearbox 10 to a generator 12. The belt drive 11 may<br>
provide additional speed increase and it also introduces some flexibility into the<br>
drive train to smooth out torque spikes. The gearbox 10 is a shaft mounted type<br>
that unless restrained will rotate in the direction of torque. In the preferred<br>
embodiment/the gearbox 10 is constrained to a small angular increment of<br>
rotation so that belt tension varies from loose (without falling off) to tight. This<br>
angular increment is adjustable. A shock absorber 13 constrains the rate of<br>
angular rotation of the gearbox 10 in the positive torque direction stabilizing the<br>
drive train during start up and damping torque spikes. A standard light truck<br>
shock absorber is employed in the preferred embodiment.<br>
It is possible that the belt drive 11 could be eliminated from the drive<br>
train, although the preferred embodiment includes the belt drive. The generator<br>
12 is a standard asynchronous induction generator in the preferred embodiment.<br>
Other types of generators or alternators could be used that operate at constant or<br>
at variable speeds.<br>
The braking system for the wind turbine, shown schematically in Figures<br>
9 and 10 is a critical component. The brake system is shown in Figure 9 in a<br>
released position in which the turbine can operate. Figure 10 shows the brake<br>
system in an engaged position for stopping the turbine. The wind turbine's<br>
braking system must ensure that the wind turbine does not run away to damaging<br>
speeds in the event that the electrical grid is lost or that the generator or its<br>
controls malfunction and the generator is no longer capable of limiting the speed<br>
of the wind turbine rotor. The braking system must also be capable of bringing<br>
the wind turbine to a stop in a short period of time in the event of a fault or other<br>
problem with the wind turbine.<br>
As shown in Figures 9 and 10, the brake system consists of a brake disc<br>
14 that us located above a bottom flange 15 of the main shaft 2. The inside<br>
diameter of the brake disc 14 is slightly larger than the outside diameter of the<br>
main shaft 2 allowing the disc 12 to both rotate and move up or down. The disc<br>
14 is restrained in rotational motion relative to the main shaft 2 by several pins<br>
16 that fit vertically through the bottom flange 15, the brake disc 14 and a flange<br>
17 identical to the bottom flange 15. Flanges 15 and 17 are welded to the main<br>
shaft 2 and their outside diameters (which are equal in size) are much smaller<br>
than the outside diameter of the brake disc 14. The brake disc 14 is free to move<br>
vertically between flanges 15 and 17. There are two sets of brake shoes, an<br>
upper fixed set of shoes 18 and a lower moveable set of shoes 19. The moveable<br>
shoes 19 are free to move vertically and to pivot in a vertical plane. The<br>
moveable shoes 19 are mounted on the short end of a brake arm 20 that pivots in<br>
the vertical plane on fulcrum pin shafts 21. A weight 22 is provided on the end<br>
of the brake arm 20 to provide braking force. The fulcrum pin 21 is placed such<br>
that the distance from it to the end of the brake arm 20 supporting the weight 22<br>
is ten times the distance from the pin 21 to the center of the moveable brake<br>
shoes 19. There are two parallel brake arms 20 mounted one on each side of the<br>
main shaft 2. When the long end of the brake arm 20 is lowered about the<br>
fulcrum 21 the short end rises displacing the moveable shoes 19 upward. The<br>
moveable shoes 19 are located below the brake disc 14 and contact the disc 14<br>
when the shoes 19 are raised. With further lowering of the long end of the brake<br>
arms 20 the brake disc 14 is raised until it comes in contact with the upper fixed<br>
brake shoes 18. The disc 14 is then sandwiched between the upper and lower<br>
brake shoes 18 and 19. This position is shown in Figure 10. The braking force<br>
is then the weight 22 times the mechanical advantage of the leverage or ten times<br>
the weight 22.<br>
In addition to the mechanical braking force of the brake shoes 18 and 19<br>
on the brake disk 14, the wind turbine also includes a system for pitching the<br>
blades 3 to provide aerodynamic braking. The aerodynamic braking system<br>
includes a blade activation disk 23 that is located on the main shaft 2 at a height<br>
near the bottom set of blade arms 4. The inner diameter of the blade activation<br>
disk 23 is slightly larger than outer diameter of the main shaft 2 so that the disk<br>
23 can rotate around the main shaft and move up and down along the shaft 2.<br>
Attached to the blade activation disk are a set of Wade pitch cables 24 and 25.<br>
The first set of cables 24 attach to the leading edge of a blade 3. The second set <br>
of cables 25 attach to the trailing edge of a blade 3. There are four of each type<br>
of cable 24 and 25 so that when the blade actuation disk 23 is rotated relative to<br>
the main shaft 2, the leading edges of the blades are moved away from the main<br>
shaft 2 and the trailing edges are moved toward the main shaft 2 to pitch the<br>
blades 3. The blades 3 are pivot mounted on the blade arms 4 at a position<br>
between the trailing edge of the blades and the blades' center of gravity.<br>
Because the center of gravity is forward of the pivot position, the blades tend to<br>
pitch unless they are restrained by cables 24.<br>
The blade activation disk 23 is rotated at the same time that the<br>
mechanical brake is applied. A set of push rods 26 rest on the top of brake disk<br>
14 and extend upward to the bottom side of blade activation disk 23. The push<br>
rods 26 are guided and restrained within holes in flange 17 and another flange 27<br>
that is located just below the blade activation disk 23. The holes in flanges 17<br>
and 27 are oversized to allow the push rods to move vertically through the holes.<br>
When the mechanical brake is applied, brake disk 14 is moved upward. The<br>
upward motion of brake disk 14 is transmitted through the push rods 26 to the<br>
blade activation disk 23 so that blade activation disk 23 is also moved upward.<br>
A first set of stops 28 restrains a detent 29 attached to the blade activation disk<br>
23 against rotational movement relative to main shaft 2. However, when the<br>
push rods 26 move the blade activation disk 23 upward, the detent 29 on the<br>
blade activation disk 23 moves clear of the stops 28. Centrifugal force from the<br>
blades then pulls the cables 24 and 25, and therefore the blade activation disk 23, ,<br>
to a new position in which the detent 29 engages a second set of stops 30. The<br>
first set of stops 28 correspond to a blade pitch position for turbine operation and<br>
the second set of stops 30 correspond to a blade pitch position for aerodynamic<br>
braking. Ideally, the blades should pitch approximately 45 degrees between<br>
stops 28 and stops 30. A set of springs 31 pulls the blade activation disk 23 back<br>
to the operating position in which the detent 29 is engaged with stops 28. When<br>
the rotor speed slows, the centrifugal force from the blades is not high enough to<br>
overcome the force of the springs 31 and the blades return to their operating<br>
position. When the mechanical brake is released, the push rods 26 move<br>
downward and allow the detents 29 to fall into a position where they are retained<br>
by stops 28. In this way, the blades are pitched during a braking operation to<br>
provide aerodynamic braking, but they automatically return to their operating<br>
position when the brake is released. The aerodynamic brakes are shown in<br>
Figure 9 in their operating position and in Figure 10 in their stopping position<br>
with the blades pitched.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 2 in which the wind turbine includes<br>
three stacked modules, the aerodynamic brake is preferably included on only the<br>
bottom module. The blades on the other two modules are fixed in pitch in order<br>
to minimize wear and maintenance on the upper modules.<br>
As shown in Figures 9 and 10, the brake system is actuated with a<br>
pneumatic cylinder 32 that raises and lowers the weight 22 and the end of the<br>
brake arms 20. When the lower end of the cylinder 32 is pressurized, the<br>
internal piston is forced upward lifting the weight 22 and the brake arms 20. The<br>
cylinder 30 must be pressurized to release the brake and the brake is applied<br>
when pressure in the cylinder is released. The pressurized air supply 33 to the<br>
cylinder 32 is controlled to control the brake system. An air compressor 34<br>
supplies pressurized air to the cylinder 32. In the preferred embodiment one<br>
compressor 34 supplies compressed air for the air cylinders 32 on several<br>
adjacent wind turbines. Flow into and out of the air cylinder is controlled by a<br>
solenoid valve 35. The valve 35 is electrically energized by a circuit 36 that also<br>
provides power to the generator 12 so that the brake is activated if power to the<br>
generator 12 is disrupted. The compressed air line 33 is open between the<br>
cylinder 32 and the compressor 34. When electrical energy to the valve 33 is<br>
interrupted the valve 33 closes between the compressor 34 and the cylinder 32<br>
and exhausts the pressurized air from the cylinder 32 causing the weight 22 and<br>
brake arms 20 to drop, engaging the brake system. This is a fail.-safe design<br>
because loss of power will de-energize the solenoid valve 35 and release<br>
pressure in the air line 33 supplying the pneumatic cylinder 32 thereby causing<br>
the brake to be applied. Electrical energy to the valve 33 can be interrupted by a<br>
fault in the turbine circuit or the utility supply. It can also be interrupted by a<br>
manually switching the solenoid 36 and compressor circuit 37 off with a brake<br>
switch 38. In addition to manual switching, a toggle switch 39 in the solenoid<br>
circuit 36 can be switched off by a trip arm 40 that moves into the path of the<br>
toggle switch 39 to turn it off. The trip arm 40 and toggle switch 39 are shown<br>
 in Figure 11. The manual switch 38 and toggle switch 39 must be manually<br>
reset or reset through control software. If there is a fault in the utility circuit, the<br>
brake will engage but will automatically disengage when electricity is restored.<br>
As shown in Figure 11, the toggle switch 39 is activated by a trip arm 40.<br>
The trip arm 40 is mounted on the main shaft flange 15. The trip arm 40 is free<br>
to rotate away from the main shaft 2 but is constrained by a spring 41. Spring 41<br>
tension can be set so that the trip arm 40 moves into a position to trip the toggle<br>
switch 39 when the rotor speed is above an acceptable speed i.e. slightly greater<br>
than generation speed. The trip arm 40 is preferably steel to provide sufficient<br>
mass and therefore sufficient centrifugal force. In alternative embodiments, the<br>
switch 39 could be activated by solid state speed sensors or by a PLC controller.<br>
Although the braking system includes redundant mechanical and<br>
aerodynamic-braking, and although the activation system is fail-safe, experience<br>
with wind turbines has shown that it is desirable to include another redundant<br>
brake trip system in order to prevent runaway wind turbines. A redundant rotor<br>
speed governor system is shown in Figures 9 and 10. A set of weighted arms 42<br>
are bearing mounted on the top blade arms 4 of the bottom rotor module. Two<br>
arms 42 are employed in the preferred embodiment. The arms 42 hang down<br>
when the rotor is at rest. When rotor speed increases the arms 42 fling up and<br>
out. A cable 43 is attached to each arm 42 at an appropriate distance from the<br>
. arm pivot point and connects to the top of blade activation disk 23. When the<br>
rotor speed exceeds a speed above the toggle switch 39 trip speed, sufficient<br>
tension in cable 43 tension is developed to lift the disc 23 off its first set of stops<br>
28. The blades 3 are then free to pitch to a 45 degree pitch angle. The<br>
aerodynamic braking effect keeps the rotor speed within a structurally safe<br>
range. This is a fail safe system of rotor protection.<br>
The lower end of the main shaft 2 is supported by two bottom bearings<br>
44 and 45 as shown in Figure 8. The main bearing or upper bearing 44 is<br>
mounted to the main support cross beam 46 above the gearbox 10 and the<br>
foundation. The shaft system includes the main shaft 2 and a drive shaft 47.<br>
This shaft system can pivot about the main bearing 44. Both bearings are self<br>
aligning. The shaft system, including main shaft 2 and drive shaft 47, teeters<br>
 because the guy cables 7 can stretch under load. The bottom bearing 45 must be<br>
able to move in the horizontal plane to relieve bending stresses in the drive shaft<br>
47. Bearing 45 is smaller than the main bearing 44. The drive shaft is stepped at<br>
the bottom to accommodate bearing 45 and so that bearing 45 can share thrust<br>
loads with the main bearing 44. The lower bearing rests on plate 48 which rests<br>
on a roller bearing surface 49 shown in Figure 12. The roller bearing surface 49<br>
allows the bearing support plate 48 to move freely in the horizontal plane to<br>
relieve bending on the drive shaft 47. All of these plates are supported by the<br>
foundation 50 through several plates that are held in place horizontally by<br>
anchor bolts protruding from the foundation 50. The lower bearing 45 is<br>
therefore supported by the foundation 50. The lower bearing 43 rests on plate 48<br>
by adjustable bearing bolts 51 that can be set to specific load sharing between<br>
the main bearing 44 and the lower bearing 45.<br>
Figure 10 shows that the roller bearing surface 49 is a surface formed by<br>
an array of ball bearings 52 held in place by a frame 53. All of the ball bearings<br>
52 are of equal diameter. Ball bearing 52 diameter is greater than the frame 53<br>
thickness so that the steel plates above the roller bearings 52 rest on the spherical<br>
bearings. The top bearing plate 48 can roll around on these bearings 52. The top<br>
48 and bottom 51 plates are greased on the surfaces adjacent to the spherical<br>
bearings 52. <br>
