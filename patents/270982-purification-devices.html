PURIFICATION DEVICES<br>
KULKARNI AVINASH DATTATRAYA<br>
an Indian National<br>
of 6, Prassanna Apartments, Ashok Path. 55/22, Erandawane, Pune 11 004,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to air purification devices.<br><br>
In particular, this invention relates to devices for disinfecting air which at the<br>
same time removes odour and stench.<br>
Still particularly, this invention relates to devices for air purification and<br>
odour removal from air, either generally or within a defined closed space.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
A large number of pollutants can be found in the air and water. Pollution of<br>
environments inhabited by human, animal or plant life is of grave and<br>
growing public concern. Indoor air contaminants cause major health<br>
problems, such as lung disease and allergies. The modern lifestyle and the<br>
need for energy saving dictates that closed spaces have an ever-increasing<br>
content of pollutants.<br>
The pollutants that are present in normal room air have a wide distribution of<br>
sizes. Polluted air may include macro-particles, such as dirt, dust particles,<br>
pollens, and smoke. Micro-particles, such as bacteria, viruses, harmful<br>
chemicals, and various odoriferous molecules, are also commonly present in<br>
polluted air. Pollutants can cause disease, including cancer, lupus, immune<br>
diseases, allergies, and asthma.<br>
2<br><br>
The environment is also often contaminated with a variety of noxious and<br>
toxic gases including carbon monoxide, methane, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen<br>
sulphide and a broad variety of organic vapours. Closed office buildings,<br>
homes provide a greater risk of these pollutants being trapped inside.<br>
Moreover, confined spaces such as toilets provide a greater threat to the<br>
levels of normal breathing air.<br>
Hence, apparatus and methods for removing air pollutants and for<br>
eliminating stench within an enclosed space have widespread economic and<br>
therapeutic use.<br>
Air purification processes are known in the prior art. Air borne infectious<br>
agents can be controlled in three ways:<br>
i)     Dilution: by injection of fresh air.<br>
ii)    Filtration: by capturing microbes through high efficiency particulate<br>
arresters commonly called HEPA filters.<br>
iii)   Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI)<br>
By dilution, fresh air is injected into the area being treated and a part of the<br>
spent air containing microbes is forced out into the outside environment.<br>
However, if the ventilation system itself harbours pathogens like molds,<br>
spores, bacteria, virus, fungi, yeast, protozoa, algae etc., this not only renders<br>
the whole system ineffective, but also elevates the risk of being infected<br>
through the said means.<br>
Filtration by HEPA filters captures the microbes and requires regular<br>
maintenance and cleaning. A rigorous protocol is to be observed during<br>
3<br><br>
cleaning and maintenance. The worker has to wear protective clothing, mask<br>
etc. to prevent him being infected with infectious agents. The filter is to be<br><br>
removed very gently, without any bumps or jerks and the filter to be put'in<br>
airtight bag and incinerated. If a fine filter is used, the pressure drop is<br>
higher and if a coarse is used, the microbes will not be captured.<br>
Ultraviolet Germicidal Radiation is a very effective way of killing<br>
microorganisms and preventing transmission of infectious agents. Proteins<br>
and nucleic acids are main constituents of all micro-organism such as<br>
bacteria, viruses, mold spores, algae, yeast, protozoa etc. They absorb<br>
certain wavelength of ultraviolet radiation energy which destroy and<br>
inactivate DNA preventing reproduction.<br>
Ozone is an allotrope of oxygen that can be formed when molecular oxygen,<br>
such as oxygen in the air, is irradiated by Ultraviolet light having a relatively<br>
short wavelength between 100 nm and 200 nm, particularly 185 nm. Ozone<br>
is a powerful oxidizer because it is not a stable molecule. It has a half-life<br>
measured in hours, and immediately after being formed, ozone molecules<br>
begin to return to the stable, molecular state by releasing the third oxygen<br>
atoms which then enter destructive reactions with contaminants in the<br>
vicinity. The use of ozone is hence, beneficial for sterilization purposes.<br>
Ozone is an effective agent for sterilizing/sanitizing, because of the fact that<br>
it is not selective in the reactions it initiates. It renders harmful hydrocarbons<br>
and pyrogens harmless by oxidizing them, and it destroys microbes<br>
including pathogens, either by reducing or destroying them or by cell lysing<br>
or oxidation. But the fact that ozone is not selective in its reactions, means<br>
4<br><br>
that it is equally reactive to humans and animals. Long exposure to ozone at<br>
relatively low levels, or short exposure to ozone at relatively high levels;<br>
both are dangerous in effect. Caution must hence be observed to limit the<br>
production of ozone and its use in air purification within a closed area.<br>
Typically, the level of ozone must be maintained below 50 ppb.<br>
A low pressure mercury discharge lamp in a quartz envelope produces only<br>
two radiations of wavelengths 185 nm and 253.7 nm in the range 100 nm to<br>
300 nm.<br>
Ultraviolet light at 253.7 nm wavelength provides germicidal action,<br>
whereas, at 185 nm produces ozone, which in turn provides sanitizing and<br>
deodorizing action.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,809,329 discloses an ultraviolet light system for<br>
treating air. It speaks of an UV tube lamp having two sections; one for<br>
Ultraviolet production with the production of ozone, and another for the<br>
production of Ultraviolet light without the production of ozone. The amount<br>
of ozone transmitted by the lamp is controlled by a movable annular sleeve.<br>
This invention however provides no synergy between the ultraviolet<br>
producing and the ozone producing lamps. This does not provide any<br>
limiting action on the production of ozone.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,528,02) discloses a system and method for treatment<br>
of hazardous biological materials being exhausted from sewer and grease<br>
5<br><br>
trap vents. The hazardous emissions are neutralized when exposed to a<br>
mixture of ozone and ultra-violet radiation. This invention basically refers to<br>
an exhaust-type device and not for recycling air within a closed space.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,503,458 illustrates a device for purifying air within a<br>
room. It discloses an ultraviolet ray generator to kill bacteria, germs and<br>
viruses in the air passing through the device. This device also generates<br>
ozone for neutralizing undesirable odours through the air passing within the<br>
housing. There is no mechanism to limit the amount of ozone generated<br>
within the device and to keep it in within the acceptable limits so that the air<br>
is suitable for human use.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,601,786 shows a system and method for purifying air<br>
by employing a lamp that produces two separate energy intensity maxima.<br>
One is the ozone producing radiation that falls within one wavelength<br>
interval, and other is for germicidal radiation that falls within another<br>
wavelength interval. This does not speak of a simultaneous multiple-<br>
wavelength radiating lamp that provides a multiple effect of sterilizing,<br>
sanitizing and purification. Nor does it provide in-built ozone-limiting<br>
apparatus.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 3,745,750 reveals an air purifier that is an air treatment<br>
means in the form of an ozone generator or ultraviolet lamp. It is not purely<br>
an Ultraviolet-lamp based purifier. It works with a combination of filters for<br>
effective use.<br>
6<br><br>
There is therefore need for a device that removes odour and stench and at the<br>
same time sanitizes the air, while maintaining the ozone levels within<br>
acceptable limits.<br>
The envisaged device in accordance with this invention overcomes the<br>
limitations of the prior art.<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
An object of the invention is to purify/sterilize/sanitize/deodorize air in a<br>
closed environment.<br>
Another object of this invention is to deodorize air in a closed environment.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide an Ultraviolet based air-<br>
purifying means.<br>
An additional object of this invention is to provide an Ozone based air-<br>
deodorizing means.<br>
A further object of this invention is to control the ozone released into the<br>
environment suitable for indoor applications.<br>
One more object of this invention is to provide an apparatus which provides<br>
the actions of purifying, sterilizing, sanitizing, stench removal, and the like<br>
and also limits the production of ozone for the said purposes concurrently.<br>
7<br><br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
A key to the present invention is to provide high ozone concentration in a<br>
restricted space to destroy microbes and odours and yet have low ozone in<br>
the exit air.<br>
A practical embodiment of the device in accordance with this invention is a<br>
wall mounted or a free standing device which combines with a device for<br>
circulating air and which draws air continuously or intermittently from the<br>
surroundings and passes the air over a Ultraviolet germicidal lamp to remove<br>
odour and stench and to kill the microbes.<br>
A typical embodiment of the device in accordance with this invention<br>
comprises a disinfecting device having a purification chamber, and at least<br>
one Ultraviolet Germicidal lamp to irradiate the air; Ballast for operating the<br>
lamp; a fan to draw air.<br>
The purification chamber is typically fabricated from UV reflecting material<br>
but is not limited thereto. The lamp envisaged in accordance with the<br>
invention is a UV producing lamp, one portion of which produces UV at 185<br>
nm which is capable of converting the normal Oxygen present in the<br>
environment to ozone and another portion of which produces UV radiation<br>
of 253.7 nm which on the one hand kills microbes present in the air and at<br>
the same time converts excess ozone to oxygen.<br>
The invention envisages an air disinfectant system by irradiation with<br>
ultraviolet radiation which eliminates odours by oxidation of volatile organic<br>
8<br><br>
compounds by ozone produced by the ultraviolet lamp and at the same time<br>
the excess ozone produced is rendered harmless.<br>
Microorganisms, like microbes are transmitted through air. Transmission of<br>
infectious disease is dependent upon concentration of infectious air borne<br>
particles that can be inhaled by a susceptible person. For instance, droplets<br>
of various sizes expelled into air when an infectious person coughs or<br>
sneezes form aerodynamic nuclei 1 µm to 5 µm in diameter.<br>
A low-pressure mercury discharge lamp produces ultraviolet radiation of<br>
185 nm, 253.7 nm and other wavelengths, of which 85% of the radiation is<br>
in 253.7 nm. Ultraviolet radiation of 185 nm produces ozone in air. The<br>
germicidal effect of ultraviolet radiation is most pronounced in the region of<br>
100-280 nm. The germicidal activity peaks at 265 nm, which is very close to<br>
253.7 nm radiation emitted by a low-pressure mercury discharge lamp.<br>
Some soft glasses of special configuration can transmit UV at 253.7 nm but<br>
none of the soft glasses can transmit 185 nm; and therefore a UV lamp made<br>
from soft glass cannot produce ozone.<br>
Normally, all soft glasses absorb UV. The quartz glass (or fused silica) used<br>
for UV lamps transmit ultraviolet radiation of 253.7 nm and 185 nm. A part<br>
of the quartz glass/fused silica tube used in the present invention is so<br>
formulated that it blocks the ozone forming 185 nm wavelength and<br>
transmits UV radiation of wavelength 253.7 nm only.<br>
9<br><br>
This invention, envisages the emission of ozone producing ultraviolet<br>
radiation in the air. The ozone so produced not only destroys air borne<br>
microbes but also acts as a powerful oxidizing agent and oxidizes stench<br>
producing organic moieties into non odorous compounds. However, what is<br>
also needed is a device which renders excess Ozone harmless.<br>
This is achieved in the present invention by providing a lamp having a glass<br>
envelope such as of quartz glass that permits emission of light of wavelength<br>
~ 185 nm in one region and fused silica glass, normally called quartz glass,<br>
having a high transmission in the 253.7 nm UV region.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a device for eliminating odour<br>
and killing microbes, said device comprising:<br>
(i) First means for emitting significant UV radiation having wavelength of<br>
185 nm;<br>
(ii) Second means for emitting UV radiation specifically having<br>
wavelength of 253.7 nm; and<br>
(iii) Third means for forcing ambient air sequentially in contact with the<br>
first and the second means.<br>
Typically, the first and the second means are two different UV lamps.<br>
Alternatively, the first and the second means are part of the same UV lamps<br>
having different glass envelopes; the operative lower portion of the lamp<br>
constituting the first means and the operative upper portion constituting the<br>
second means.<br>
10<br><br>
Typically, the first means is smaller than the second means.<br>
Typically, the first means to the second means is in the ratio of 1:3.<br>
Typically, the third means is in the form of a fan drawing air from the<br>
ambient and forming a current of air flowing in a controlled manner over the<br>
first means and then over the second means.<br>
Further, the first, second and third means are arranged in a chamber in a<br>
vertical configuration in which the third means is located either below the<br>
first means or above the second means and therefore air is either forced<br>
through the chamber or sucked through it.<br>
Typically, the first means consists of a UV lamp enclosed in quartz glass<br>
adapted to transmit UV radiation particularly having wave length of 185 nm<br>
and the second means consists of a UV lamp enclosed in quartz glass<br>
typically doped with titanium dioxide which is adapted to block UV<br>
radiation having wave length of 185 nm and transmits UV radiation having<br>
wave length of 253,7 nm.<br>
Typically, the device is adapted to provide UV radiation of wave length 185<br>
nm so as to form air deodorizing Ozone; and further adapted to provide<br>
microbe killing UV radiation having wave length of 253.7 nm adapted to<br>
eliminate the Ozone and said device still further adapted to pass odour and<br>
microbe containing air to selectively deodorize the air with the help of ozone<br>
and kill microbes and eliminate almost all the excess formed ozone to<br>
provide deodorized, microbe free and de-ozonised air to an environment,<br>
typically a closed environment.<br>
11<br><br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention, the lamp made<br>
is divided into 2 parts; the lower quarter for the production of UV radiation<br>
of 185 nm wavelength which gives rise to ozone, and the upper three<br>
quarters for the production of UV light of 253.7 nm wavelength. Thus lower<br>
part of the lamp is devised to emit UV light preferably of 185 nm<br>
wavelength for ozone production and its said causes. The upper part of the<br>
lamp is made up of doped quartz material, which blocks UV radiation below<br>
200 nm and controlled such that light emitted out of it is in the 253.7 nm<br>
range i.e. within the Ultraviolet range.<br>
Air is drawn either by blowing or by suction into the device. As the air<br>
passes through the housing within which the lamp is enclosed, it initially<br>
comes into contact with the lower portion of the lamp and enters this region.<br>
This region is rich in Ozone. Organic compounds, particularly the<br>
odoriferous are rendered odour free and some of the microbes are also killed.<br>
Thus in this region the air gets treated predominately for stench removal.<br>
The air is then forced into the upper region of the lamp. This region is<br>
bathed with UV radiation. This radiation not only kills any remaining<br>
microbes but also renders harmless any excess ozone by converting it to the<br>
stable Oxygen form. Finally clean odour-free air emanates from out of the<br>
top of the housing into the atmosphere.<br>
The ozone production is generally limited by the components against which<br>
it acts i.e. as long as the harmful components exist, the ozone gets utilized<br>
and does not exceed permissible limits. If in case, the air to be purified does<br>
not contain polluting elements, ozone is not utilized, and hence, ozone may<br>
12<br><br><br>
reach levels not suitable for human consumption. The device in accordance,<br>
with this invention is equipped with limiting the ozone production. The UV<br>
light at 185 nm produces ozone, but as it reaches 253.7 nm, the UV light<br>
results in the destruction of ozone molecules. This feature provides the<br>
control for Ozone produced by the device.<br>
In accordance with one variation of the device, the lamp adapted to produce<br>
ozone is also partially adapted to emit visible light.<br>
The lamp in accordance with this invention is typically operated with ballast<br>
for operating the lamp which may or may not be dimmable.<br>
The device may be stationary or moving and may be fitted to another device<br>
or within a conduit. Forced circulation of air over the device or bringing air<br>
in the vicinity of the device, typically within 3 to 4 inches causes the<br>
generation of ozone which is used for the purpose aforesaid.<br>
A particular embodiment of the device will require the use of an opaque<br>
protector that will prevent direct viewing- of the lamp fitted in the device to<br>
prevent direct contact of the ultraviolet radiation with the eyes of the viewer.<br>
In a closed space or in the open, the device so made could be used to<br>
disinfect and at the same time remove odour.<br>
The device in accordance with this invention could be modified for use in a<br>
refrigerator or other appliance not only to provide light but also to remove<br>
odours and disinfect the internal environment of the appliance.<br><br>
It could also be used to treat fruits and vegetables.<br>
Brief Description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 relates to the air purifier device in one configuration using one<br>
lamp.<br>
Figure 2 relates to the air purifier device in another configuration using two<br>
lamps.<br>
Detailed Description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the various embodiments which comprise the air<br>
purifying mechanism, which are merely illustrative and do not in anyway<br>
limit the scope of this invention. Fan (2) draws air into the unit. The housing<br>
(14) encloses a lamp (12) which has UV-producing ability of two<br>
wavelengths viz; 185 nm and 253.7 nm, and Ozone-producing capability.<br>
The lamp has a glass envelope of two types of quartz. The two parts are<br>
fused together to form the lower body (5) and upper body (7) in the ratio 1:3<br>
respectively. The lamp envelopes house the filaments (4). The light emitted<br>
through the lower envelope is between 185 nm and 253.7 nm. The upper<br>
three quarters of the lamp is made of quartz which is doped with titanium<br>
dioxide such that light directed out of the glass is of 253.7 nm wavelength<br>
which is normal UV light for germicidal action and ozone destruction.<br>
Housing (14) is lined on the inside by a UV radiating surface. Also, this<br>
housing (14) prevents the user from directly viewing the UV lamp.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the various embodiments of the air purifying mechanism<br>
with a different configuration of lamps. Fan (16) blows out air. The housing<br>
14<br><br>
(14) encloses two lamps (5, 7) of different glass envelopes. Each of these<br>
lamps houses filaments (4). The lower lamp (5) is made up of quartz such,<br>
that light emitted out of it is between 185 nm and 253.7 nm. The upper lamp<br>
is made up of quartz doped with titanium dioxide such that it blocks the UV<br>
light below 200 nm and light emitting out of it is of 253.7 nm wavelength,<br>
which is normal UV light for germicidal action and ozone destruction.<br>
Housing (14) is lined on the inside by a UV radiating surface. Also, this<br>
housing (14) prevents the user from directly viewing the UV lamp.<br>
Trial 1<br>
An experiment was conducted at DR GOLWILKAR LABORATORIES<br>
PVT. LTD to test the efficacy of the device in accordance with this<br>
invention having two QUARTZ UV lamps of 10W each; one ozone-<br>
producing UV lamp and another non-ozone producing UV lamp.<br>
A room with a work area of approximately 2000 cft volume was used for the<br>
experiment. The room was ventilated by a central air conditioning unit. The<br>
average number of persons occupying the room was about eight in the<br>
duration of the experiment. The laboratory door was opened and closed<br>
several times an hour for movement of laboratory personnel.<br>
The experiment was started at 3.00 PM, To check the initial bacterial count,<br>
one blood agar culture plate was opened and kept on the worktable exposed<br>
to the ambient air for 1/2 hour. The UVGI unit was switched on at 3:30pm<br>
and a new culture plate was opened and kept on the work table for 1/2 hr<br>
between 4:30 to 5:00pm. With the unit in accordance with this invention was<br>
15<br><br>
switched on continuously from 3:30pm, two more plates were opened and<br>
exposed subsequently for 1/2 hr each from 5:30 - 6:00 pm and 6:30 <br>
7:00pm. The unit was turned off at 7 pm. After 24 hr of incubation, colony<br>
counts of the four plates obtained were as follows:<br><br>

Other observation Although one of the two UV lamps were ozone<br>
producing UV lamp, ozone odour was never detected.<br>
CONCLUSION: The colony count showed significant fall after the unit<br>
was switched on indicating the bactericidal effect of UV radiation and ozone<br>
on the air being circulated in the room.<br>
Trial 2<br>
16<br><br>
To determine the effectiveness of ozone in stench elimination and<br>
sterilization, three sets of experiments were performed. It was also necessary<br>
to see whether the ozone content in the air is safe as per different standards."<br>
According to the California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS), the<br>
maximum ozone limit is 70 parts per billion (ppb) 8 hour average or 90<br>
ppbl hour average, where as according to Federal standards it is 80 ppb 8<br>
hour average. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)<br>
standard the limit is 50 ppb which applies to the medical devices.<br>
Thus, the experiments performed with different ozonators were designed in<br>
such a way that, these experiments would reveal consumption of ozone for<br>
stench elimination, will show that the total ozone content does not exceed<br>
the above mentioned limits, and will demonstrate the germicidal action of<br>
UV radiation and ozone.<br>
In the first set of experiment ozone levels were measured in an office of 33<br>
cubic meter volume (3.3 x 3.0 x 3.3 m3) using the device in accordance with<br>
this invention . The trials were also taken in the toilets, which were 60% and<br>
50% in the volume as compared to the office. The larger toilet was being<br>
used by around 70 workers for almost 16 hours a day where as the smaller<br>
toilet was being used by nearly 20 staff members for eight hours a day.<br>
Therefore, for the larger toilet a blower type unit in accordance with this<br>
invention was used with 20 W ozone forming UV lamp. In the smaller toilet<br>
unit in accordance with this invention with 10W ozone forming UV lamp<br>
but without fan or blower was used. The experiment was carried in the office<br>
and in a smaller toilet (about 50% in volume as compared to office) using<br>
17<br><br>
the unit. In this case, the ozone level in the office built up to 30 ppb while in<br>
the toilet it built up to 20 ppb. This clearly indicates that ozone was being-<br><br>
consumed in the toilet to eliminate volatile organic compounds (VOC). The<br>
stench in the toilet was reduced considerably and no stench could be<br>
detected at the door of the toilet. For the bigger system a bigger unit in<br>
accordance with this invention was used the ozone level built up in the office<br>
to 40 ppb but in the toilet ozone level stayed at 10 ppb well below the<br>
detection limit of human nose (20 ppb). This again clearly indicates that<br>
ozone being consumed in the toilet to eliminate volatile organic compounds<br>
(VOC) and hence the ozone level does not build up even to 20 ppb. At the<br>
same time the stench level in the toilet was negligibly low and no smell<br>
could be detected even at the door of the toilet.<br>
In the second set of experiment, trials were conducted in two toilets each of<br>
(2.5 x 1.2 x 2.5 mj). Two variations of unit in accordance with this invention<br>
were used. In the first trial, the unit without fan was used in a toilet which<br>
was used by almost 25 workwrs for 16 hours a day. After two hours of<br>
operation the ozone level 1 inch above the unit was 80 ppb while the ozone<br>
level at the sink and toilet seat was 20 ppb. Again there was no stench what<br>
so ever outside the toilet. In the second toilet used by 10 office staff<br>
members eight hours a day, the unit was used with a fan below the lamp.<br>
After two hours of operation the ozone level at 1 inch above the unit was<br>
140 ppb, while, the ozone level at the sink or seat of the toilet was at 20 ppb.<br>
From above two experiments it can be confirmed that the ozone is consumed<br>
for stench elimination and the ozone level does not exceed the limits<br>
mentioned in different standards.<br>

While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the. particular<br>
features of the preferred embodiment and the improvisation with regards to<br>
it, it will be appreciated that various modifications can be made in the<br>
preferred embodiment without departing from the principles of the<br>
invention. For instance, the first means may be provided with an adjustable<br>
jacket for selectively blocking the first means and thereby reducing or<br>
eliminating the production of Ozone. These and other modifications in the<br>
nature of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the<br>
disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing<br>
descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention<br>
and not as a limitation.<br>
