				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to Rotary kiln having an improved refractory lining for<br>
different zones preferably suited for lime calcinations adapted to favour higher hot<br>
strength and abrasion resistance and longer operating life before relining. The invention<br>
advantageously provides selective refractory for the different zones of the Rotary Kiln such<br>
that the charging and discharging end are abrasion resistant with superior thermo-<br>
mechanical properties which achieve better performance than conventional castables and<br>
also the basic bricks in the calcinations zone have superior thermo-mechanical properties<br>
favouring low erosion and corrosion of the bricks as compared to existing linings. The<br>
refractory lining arrangement in the rotary kiln of the invention is further adapted such thai-<br>
it is possible to achieve considerable reduction in the shell temperature therby favouring<br>
improved performance of the lining. Importantly, the selective refractory lining in the rotary<br>
kiln of the invention would fvaour overall improved performance as compared to<br>
conventional linings of rotary kilns. The lining configuration of the present invention would<br>
thus favour low down time, higher yield/productivity and improved fuel economy, making it<br>
worthy of wide industrial applications in Rotary Kilns especially for Lime calcinations in steel<br>
plants and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The Rotary kilns are conventionally used for pyro-processing of bulk solids in numerous<br>
industrial application and is basically a rotating cylinder with its axis at an selective<br>
inclination, within which such processing take place. The pyro-processing comprising steps<br>
of drying, calcining, heating and cooling wherein various endothermic and exothermic<br>
reactions takes place. Solid retention time is a critical parameter for rotary kiln operation<br>
and is determined by selection of appropriate diameter, length, speed of rotation, slope and<br>
internal configuration.<br>
While the conventional configuration include two variations of rotary kilns- Direct fired and<br>
Indirect fired, depending on whether the combustion of fuel for desired heating of the solid<br>
mass to be pyro-processed takes place inside the kiln or outside of it, respectively. The<br>
present problem primarily deals with the direct fired rotary kiln wherein the hot flue gases<br>
passes through the kiln. The products of combustion of fuel are in intimate contact with the<br>
bulk of material being processed. The radiation from the flames is the principal mode of<br>
heat transfer in such processes.<br>
2<br><br>
The typical construction of direct fired Rotary kilns are having about 3.6m diameter and 75<br>
m long, utilized in steel plants for calcinations of Limestone to produce calcined lime for use<br>
in BOF operations. Each such Kiln is provided with a cooler for cooling of the finished<br>
products. These rotary kilns are provided with duplex burners for heating by burning coke<br>
oven gas and alternatively by PCM. The temperature for calcinations goes as high as<br>
1200°C. These Rotary kilns are typically comprising of different zones such as the cooling<br>
zone, burning zone and preheating zone, starting from the discharge end and proceeding to<br>
the charging end. The constitution of the Refractory lining in the different zones are of<br>
different types. In existing lining pattern, the refractory used in different zones along the<br>
length starting from the discharge end basically comprise of:<br>
0-2.5m : Conventional high Alumina castables and 74% Al203 bricks;<br>
2.5-30m: Mag-Chrome bricks;<br>
31-72m: 45% Al203 bricks;<br>
72-54m: 74% Al203 bricks;<br>
In the above conventional configuration, the Mag-Chrome bricks used in the burning zone<br>
contain higher level of impurities like iron oxide and silica. As a result these bricks have<br>
lower hot strength and abrasion resistance. Thermal spalling or heat distribution through<br>
out the mass is also poor due to formation of higher amount of liquid phase. As a<br>
consequence of lower hot strength, the erosion in these bricks was very high and resulted in<br>
poor lining life of about 2-4 months. Moreover, other problems including hot spots and shell<br>
crack were also observed frequently in the conventional refractory configuration. As a result<br>
the kiln had to be shut down causing loss of production, failing to meet the needed quantity<br>
of Calcined lime for metallurgical purpose in subsequent process.<br>
The conventional castable used at the discharge end has also very poor strength at the<br>
prevailing temperature (750-900°C) leading to shorter operating life. The performance of<br>
45% Al203 bricks used in the preheating zone of conventional lining pattern is also not<br>
satisfactory. Hot spots are found to occur occasionally in this zone also. The preheating zone<br>
is subjected to high abrasion due to falling and movement of hard limestone and as such<br>
the refractory lining at this zone needs to be highly abrasion resistant.<br>
3<br><br>
There had been therefore, a persistent need to develop rotary kilns with an improved<br>
constitution and configuration/scheme of the refractory lining inside kiln for calcinations of<br>
limestone such as to eliminate the disadvantages in the conventional lining of different<br>
zones of the rotary kiln and thereby the lining life is increased without shutdown and the<br>
desired distribution is achieved to economize fuel consumption and to obtain desired quality<br>
characteristics of the calcined lime to be used as flux.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The basic object of the present invention is thus directed to developing a rotary kiln having<br>
an improved constitution and configuration of the refractory lining for its different zones of<br>
the direct fired kiln for calcinations of limestone with improved hot strength and abrasion<br>
resistance such as to reduce the erosion of lining in the burning zone to prevent hot spots<br>
and/or shell crack observed on lining in this zone, thus favoring increasing the operating life<br>
of the rotary kiln without shut down for repair/relining and thereby improving the kiln<br>
yield/productivity in lime calcinations.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to an improved refractory lining<br>
constitution and configuration favoring advantageous attainment of desired high abrasion<br>
resistance of the refractory lining at the charging and discharging end for preferred counter<br>
flow movement of charge; wherein said charge of limestone subjects the preheating zone to<br>
high abrasion due to falling and movement of hard limestone.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is directed to an improved refractory lining<br>
constitution and configuration for different zones of rotary kiln for calcinations of limestone,<br>
to reduce the number of joints in the lining and prevent falling of bricks from the lining.<br>

configuration for refractory lining of rotary kiln for calcination of lime to improve overall<br>
performance and life of the lining up to about 12 months from existing 3-4 months or<br>
alternatively a lining life to produce about one lakh ton of calcined lime with minimum<br>
repairs, at the most on two or three occasions only in one campaign.<br>
A still further object of the present invention directed to providing improved configuration<br>
and composition of the refractory lining of rotary kiln such as to favor controlled uniform<br>
4<br><br>
heating of charge to desired temperature in order to obtain calcined limestone with no<br>
residual core and at the same time avoid over heating of the stone surface and maintain<br>
desired optimum surface temperature and heatflux diffusion toward the reacting core, to<br>
avoid recrystallisation of CaO, to ensure desired reactivity and quality of calcined lime.<br>
A still further object of the present invention directed to providing improved configuration<br>
and composition of the refractory lining of rotary kiln to favor recovery of the sensible heat<br>
of lime is transferred to the cooling air in the preheating zone and that the sensible heat of<br>
hot flue gases leaving the calcination zone is transferred to the limestone in the preheating<br>
zone, thereby the sensible heat of the lime is completely returned to the process.<br>
A still further object of the present invention directed to providing improved configuration<br>
and composition at the different zones of the refractory lining of rotary kiln wherein ceramic<br>
paper is provided in between the shell and the working lining of calcination zone and<br>
thereby reducing considerably the shell temperature resulting in improved performance of<br>
the lining and less damage to shell wall.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE<br>
ACCOMPANYING FIGURE<br>
The present invention relates to Rotary kiln with an improved lining pattern for calcination<br>
of lime whereby it is possible to enhance the working life of the lining eliminating the<br>
problems such as the hot spots or shell cracking and the like, encountered in the<br>
conventional rotary kiln, more particularly, the direct fired type kilns operation for<br>
calcination of limestone.<br>
As already described that there exist different zones in the Rotary kiln depending upon the<br>
nature of process carried out at a particular location within the kiln. These are the cooling<br>
zone , burning zone and preheating zone, starting correspondingly from discharge to<br>
charging end of the kiln. The rotary kilns are typically about 75m in length and about 3-4m<br>
in diameter. Each kiln is essentially provided with a cooler for cooling of the finished<br>
calcined lime and thereby heat up the cooling air flown in the zone. The Rotary kilns usually<br>
rotates at a predetermined RPM about a longitudinal axis along the kiln which is maintained<br>
at a selective slope to ensure reaction/retention time for calcinations and complete<br>
conversion of limestone to CaO, at a selective temperature ranging 900-1200°C without any<br>
residual core and avoiding recrystallisation of soft burnt flux, to ensure reactivity and quality<br>
8<br><br>
of calcined lime thus produced. The kiln is provided with adequate number of duplex<br>
burners for heating by burning coke oven gas or alternatively by PCM. The calcination<br>
temperature is around 1200°C.<br>
To select the refractory quality for different zones of the rotary kiln, it is necessary to first<br>
understand the thermo-chemical processes occurring during calcination of limestone. In<br>
order to fully calcine the stone without any residual core left in finished lime, heat supplied<br>
to the limestone surface must penetrate via conductive heat transfer to the core. A<br>
temperature of 900°C has to be reached in the core at least for a short period of time. The<br>
thermo-chemical processes occurring in the rotary kilns for heat treatment of carbonate<br>
materials (limestone) are highly energy intensive and complex.<br>
It is an obvious requirement to first understand the details of the thermo-chemical process<br>
that occur during the calcinations of limestone in order to ascertain the requirement of<br>
composition and configuration/pattern of the Refractory lining at the different zones of the<br>
Rotary Kiln. The Thermo-chemical process involved in heat treating the Carbonate materials<br>
in Rotary kiln involves a process comprising a series of interdependent parameters such as<br>
fuel consumption, gas and material movement, heat and mass transfer and physico-<br>
chemical transformation of the burden materials. The temperature of the Calcination zone of<br>
rotary kiln is limited to the range 1200-1300°C, to ensure quick production of high quality<br>
metallurgical flux.<br>
The calcination or burning of limestone and dolomite is simple oxidation process involving<br>
uniting oxygen with any substance/element. In the flux kiln, the temperature of the<br>
limestone is increased to a point above its dissociation temperature. This is called<br>
calcination and the process to accomplish this requires a minimum temperature of<br>
1648°F(898°C). At that point, the carbon to oxygen bonds in the carbonate group becomes<br>
unstable. A carbon atom, and two of the three oxygen atoms, from the carbonate group,<br>
forms the carbon dioxide, which leaves the reaction environment. The remaining oxygen<br>
atom quickly forms a strong, high energy, ionic bond with the calcium atom. Thus the<br>
formation of calcium oxide, commonly known as quicklime, is obtained by decomposition of<br>
limestone on heating according to following equation:<br>
CaCO3 + 3180 KJ(760Kcal) approx. = CaO +	CO2<br>
Calcium Carbonate	Calcium Oxide Carbon Dioxide<br>
(Limestone)	(Quicklime)<br>
9<br><br>
In order to fully calcine the stone and to eliminate retention of unburnt residual core, heat<br>
supplied to the stone surface must penetrate via conductive heat transfer to the core. A<br>
temperature of 900°C has to be reached in the core at least for a short period of time. As<br>
there is created a pure CO2 atmosphere inside the kiln , the stone surface must be heated<br>
to a temperature greater than 900°C to maintain the required temperature gradient and<br>
overcome the insulating effect of the calcined material deposited on the stone surface.<br>
Moreover, care has to be taken when the soft burnt flux is produced by calcination of<br>
limestone, the surface temperature must not exceed 1100°C-1150°C as otherwise re-<br>
crystallization of the CaO will occur and result in lower reactivity and poorer quality.<br>
The rotary kiln for limestone calcination operate with counter flow of raw material<br>
charging/feeding direction and the combustion products/gas/flue flow direction inside the<br>
kiln. There are three technological zones : preheating, calcinations and cooling. Dissociation<br>
of CaC03 occurs in the calcinations zone at a temperature range between 870°C and<br>
1250°C. In the cooler zone towards the discharge end of kiln, the sensible heat of lime is<br>
completely transferred to the cooling airflow, which enters the calcinations zone at the<br>
temperature of about 300-500°C to react with the fuel. Therefore, the sensible heat of the<br>
lime is completely returned to the process. The sensible heat of the gases leaving the<br>
calcinations zone is transferred to the limestone in the preheating zone towards the<br>
discharge end of kiln. The temperature of limestone at the bottom of the preheating zone<br>
reaches the temperature of calcinations. The gas leaving the preheating zone has a<br>
temperature range of 150°C-300°C. It is not possible to utilize this off-gas heat content<br>
completely, since the heat capacity of the gases in the preheating zone is higher than the<br>
heat capacity of the charge material. The counter-current flow is optimized for preheating<br>
and cooling. The process of heat transfer in these zones is very efficient. The dissociation of<br>
CaC03 at the calcination zone begins at about 900°C with the pressure close to atmospheric<br>
pressure, undergoing an endothermic reaction. The speed of dissociation increases<br>
exponentially as the temperature increases. The speed of dissociation reaches about ten<br>
times higher at 1200°C than the speed at 900°C. The results of micro-kinetic study shows,<br>
that the speed of dissociation can be limited by the speed of heat flux diffusion towards the<br>
reacting core of the carbonate material lumps. Thus maintaining a temperature for<br>
calcinations above 1150°C is preferable for accleration of heat transfer inside the lump of<br>
material and to increase the kiln productivity.<br>
10<br><br>
In order to achieve longer lining life under the above control parameters for the entire<br>
calcinations process carried out in the rotary kiln, following refractory pattern was adopted<br>
according to the present invention, along the length starting from the discharge end:<br>
0-2.5m: 70% Al203 new generation monolithic lining &amp; 70% Al203 bricks;<br>
2.5-30m: Mag-chrome bricks having selectively low silica and low iron content;<br>
31-36m: 70% Al203 bricks;<br>
37-57m: 42% Al203 bricks;<br>
58-73m: 70% Al203 bricks;<br>
74-75m: 70% Al203 new generation monolithic refractory lining.<br>
As already discussed , the lining at the charging and the discharge end are subjected to<br>
high degree of abrasion due to either impact of falling and moving hard limestone lumps or<br>
due to thermal shocks. The present refractory lining pattern provide highly abrasion<br>
resistant and thermal shock resistant 70% Al203 new generation monolithic. The strength of<br>
this material increases right from the room temperature to service temperature.<br>
Advantageously, there is no decrease in strength of the monolithic lining at any<br>
intermediate temperature range e.g. 200-1000°C. The comparative characteristic properties<br>
of the conventional versus the new generation monolithic castables are presented in the<br>

In order to enhance the life of lining in the calcination zone avoiding erosion of refractories<br>
or damage due to formation of hot spot or cracked shell, the lining according to the present<br>
invention introduces mag-chrome bricks having low iron and low silica (Si02 as low as<br>
1.5%). Thermo-mechanical properties of these bricks are much better having higher hot<br>
strength and abrasion resistance as compared to existing conventional mag-chrome bricks.<br>
In calcinations zone, 5mm thick ceramic fibre paper was used in between the working Iming<br>
and the shell to prevent overheating of the shell and avoid shell cracking. The comparative<br>
characteristic properties of the two varieties of basic bricks used in the rotary kiin are given<br>
in the following Table 2.<br>

Reference is now invited to Figure 1 that illustrates the configuration pattern for the Rotary<br>
kiln for calcinations of lime wherein the above monolithic lining or the mag-chrome bricks<br>
have been utilized in a selective manner in order to achieve the desired longer lining life and<br>
thereby longer run time before relining/repair, by way of providing higher hot strength and<br>
abrasion/erosion resistance through a selective constitution and lining pattern for the<br>
different zones of the rotary kiln. It is seen from the figure that the new generation<br>
monolithic (NGM) lining has been provided at the charging and discharge end of the rotary<br>
kiln over preferred length of about up to 2.5m at the discharge end and up to about lm at<br>
the charging end, to save the lining from abrasion due to impact of fall and movements of<br>
hard lumps of limestone or thermal shock due to sharp temperature gradient at the<br>
respective cooling and preheating zones. In between the monolithic castables there are the<br>
refractory brick lining as follows and as indicated in the accompanying Figure 1, 0-2.5m long<br>
70% Al203 new generation monolithic lining and 70% Al203 bricks from discharge end, and<br>
then Mag-chrome bricks having selectively low silica and low iron content over a length after<br>
2.5m and up to 30m in the calcinations zone, then 70% Al203 bricks over a stretch of about<br>
next 6 meters, then 42% Al203 bricks over about next 20 meters length, then again a<br>
stretch of about 6 meters is laid with 70% Al203 bricks and lastly the monolithic lining<br>
(NGM) again for the last stretch of about 2 m at the charging end. The accompanying<br>
Figure 2 shows three different views of the typical selective shape configuration of the<br>
bricks according to the refractory lining of the present invention.<br>
13<br><br>
It is thus possible by way of this invention to achieve a lining pattern for Rotary kiln for<br>
calcinations of lime, providing longer lining life having higher hot strength and abrasion<br>
resistance achieved through a new generation monolithic castable refractory lining of<br>
selective composition and also bricks of selective composition. The 70% Al203 bricks/<br>
castables provided in the lining pattern, and the mag-chrome bricks selectively comprising<br>
low silica and low iron to achieve desired thermo-mechanical properties and the high<br>
alumina new generation monolithic castable lining at the charging and the discharge ends<br>
having low cement content of 1.5%(CaO) max, unlike the conventional 4-5%(CaO),<br>
resulting in superior thermo-physical properties. Advantageously, the lining pattern of the<br>
present invention wherein there is no decrease in strength in the intermediate temperature<br>
range (300-1000°C). the life of the lining is enhanced to the extent of up to 12 months as<br>
compared to 3-4 months obtained in the conventional lining design for rotary kiln for<br>
calcinations of limestone at desired temperature range without leaving any unburnt residual<br>
core and avoiding recrystallisation of the soft burnt flux. The lining so configured showed<br>
little erosion, abrasion or formation of hot spots or shell cracking even after six months of<br>
continuous operation for the rotary kiln to produce calcined lime, thus favoring wide<br>
industrial application in steel plants where the requirement of lime as flux is continuous in<br>
large volume.<br>
