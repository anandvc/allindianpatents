				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a hydrocarbon conversion process referred to in the art as hydrocracking. Hydrocracking is used in petroleum refineries to reduce the average molecular weight of heavy or middle fractions of crude oil. The invention more directly relates to an integrated hydrocracking and hydrotreating process which has a specific reactor effluent separation arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Large quantities of petroleum derived hydrocarbons are converted into higher value hydrocarbon fractions used as motor fuel by a refining process referred to as hydrocracking. The high economic value of petroleum fuels has led to extensive development of both hydrocracking catalysts and the process technology. In a hydrocracking process the heavy feed is contacted with a fixed bed of a solid catalyst in the presence of hydrogen at conditions of high temperature and pressure which result in a substantial portion of the molecules of the feed stream being broken down into molecules of smaller size and greater volatility.<br>
The raw feed contains significant amounts of organic sulfur and nitrogen. The sulfur and nitrogen must be removed to meet modern fuel specifications. Removal or reduction of the sulfur and nitrogen is also beneficial to the operation of a hydrocracking reactor. The sulfur and nitrogen is removed by a process referred to as hydrotreating. Due to the similarity of the process conditions employed in hydrotreating and hydrocracking the two processes are often integrated into a single overall process unit having separate sequential reactors dedicated to the two reactions and a common product recovery section.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
Hydrocracking processes are used commercially in a large number of petroleum refineries. They are used to process a variety of feeds ranging from<br>
naphtha to very heavy crude oil residual fractions. In general, the hydrocracking process splits the molecules of the feed into smaller (lighter) molecules having higher average volatility and economic value. At the same time a hydrocracking process normally improves the quality of the material being processed by increasing the hydrogen to carbon ratio of the materials, and by removing sulfur and nitrogen.<br>
A general review and classification of the different hydrocracking process flow schemes is provided in the book entitled, "Hydrocracking Science and Technology", authored by Julius Scherzer and A.J. Gruia, published in 1996 by Marcel Dekker, Inc. Specific reference may be made to the chapter beginning at page 174 which describes single stage, once-through and two-stage hydrocracking process flow schemes and basic product recovery flows employing vapor-liquid separation zones. This reference also shows that it is known that the feed stream can be passed first into a hydrotreating zone to remove organic nitrogen and sulfur before the feed stream enters the hydrocracking zone.<br>
The high pressures employed in hydrocracking has prompted efforts to conserve the pressure of any portion of the hydrocracking effluent which is to be recycled and to also limit reductions in pressure as a separation mechanism to the product recovery section of the process. The effluent of a high pressure reactor such as a hydrocracking reactor therefore typically flows into a vessel referred to as a high pressure separator (HPS), which operates at a pressure close to the outlet pressure of the reaction zone. High pressure separators are classified as "hot" or "cold" depending on whether the effluent stream is cooled significantly prior to passage into the HPS.<br>
US-A-3,260,663 illustrates the passage of the effluent of an initial hydrotreater 8 into a separator 14 which may be operated at close to the conditions employed in the hydrotreater. The separator contains trays 24, and hydrogen may be charged to the bottom of the separator via line 28. A vapor-phase comprising 343°C (650°F)-minus hydrocarbons and hydrogen and a liquid phase stream are removed from the separator and passed into separate hydrocracking zones. The effluent of both hydrocracking reactors shown in the reference is handled in a more conventional manner with the effluent first flowing<br>
into a HPS and then the liquid from the HPS flowing into a low pressure separator 66.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is a combined sequential hydrotreating and hydrocracking process. The subject invention relates to a novel separation and process flow arrangement between the hydrotreating and hydrocracking reaction zones of such a process. In the subject process only a controlled portion of the hydrotreating zone effluent flows into a the high severity hydrocracking reactor. This produces an unexpected improvement in the quality of distillate products, such as a jet fuel recovered from a hydrocracking zone despite an overall low to moderate conversion.   The flow scheme of the invention employs two high pressure separators in series to separate the effluent of a hydrotreating reactor in order to provide controlled division of heavy hydrocarbons between a high conversion hydrocracking zone and the product recovery zone of the process. A variable portion of the hydrotreater effluent is thereby bypassed around the hydrocracking zone allowing controlled overall conversion and production of an upgraded "unconverted" bottoms product stream.<br>
In one instance, the entire hydrocracking zone effluent may be passed into the hydrotreating zone. The separation method includes recovering distillate products from part of the effluent of the hydrotreating zone. The invention is further distinguished by the passage into the hydrocracking zone of only parts of two specific fractions recovered from the effluent of the hydrotreating zone in a unique separation sequence employing two high pressure separation zones.<br>
The process employs both a hydrocracking reactor and a hydrotreating reactor, which process comprises passing a feed stream comprising hydrocarbons having boiling points above 371 °C (700° F) and hydrogen into a hydrotreating reaction zone operated at hydrotreating conditions and producing a hydrotreating reaction zone effluent stream comprising hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, and unconverted feed components having boiling points above 371 °C<br><br>
(700°F). In one embodiment a separation zone separate the hydrotreating reaction zone effluent stream in a first high pressure separation zone into a vapor-phase light fraction comprising hydrocarbons having boiling points below 371 °C (700°F), and a liquid-phase heavy fraction comprising hydrocarbons having boiling points above 371 °C (700°F). A second high pressure separator separates the light fraction into a recycle gas stream and a liquid process stream passes. A first portion of the heavy fraction, the liquid process stream and hydrogen are passed into the hydrocracking reactor to produce a hydrocracking reaction zone effluent stream. The remaining portion of the heavy fraction and the hydrocracking reaction zone effluent stream are passed into a product recovery zone, to recover at least one distillate hydrocarbon product stream.<br>
In another embodiment the invention may be characterized as a method for recovering a product of a hydrocarbon conversion process which employs two reactors, which method comprises separating the effluent stream of a first reactor containing hydrotreating catalyst maintained at hydrotreating conditions in an augmented first high pressure separator of a high pressure separation zone and thereby producing a light process stream comprising hydrogen and normally vaporous hydrocarbons, an intermediate process stream, rich in hydrocarbons boiling between 149°C (300° F) and 371 °C (700°F), and a heavy process stream rich in hydrocarbons having boiling points above 371 °C (700°F); passing the light process stream, at least a first portion of the intermediate process stream and at least a first portion of the heavy process stream into a second high pressure separator of the high pressure separation zone operated at a pressure within 689 kPa (100 psi) of the first high pressure separator; separating the chemical compounds entering the second high pressure separator into a vapor phase stream which is passed into a second reactor and a liquid phase stream which is passed into a product recovery zone, and recovering a distillate product stream from the product recovery zone. The effluent from the hydrocracking zone may be passed directly into the hydrotreating zone or into the second high pressure separator. As used herein, the term "rich" is intended to mean a concentration of the indicated compound or type of compounds greater than 50 mole % and preferably greater than 70%. In<br>
specific cases such as hydrogen streams, the term "rich" will often indicate a much higher concentration exceeding 90 mol %.<br>
One objective of the process is, therefore, to provide a process which performs a high level of hydrotreatment without using a high operating pressure, e.g. above 2000 psig (13790 kPa). Another objective of the invention is to provide a flexible process which can vary the overall degree of feed stream hydrotreating. It is an objective of the subject process to provide a selective low conversion hydrocracking process for processing relatively light feeds which require only limited cracking for conversion to the desired products. It is a specific objective of the invention to provide a selective hydrocracking process for use with feed streams that contain a significant amount of hydrocarbons which already boil in the desired product boiling point range.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a simplified process flow diagram showing the effluent of a low conversion hydrocracking reactor flowing directly into a hydrotreating reactor. Figure 2 shows a modification to the flow scheme of Figure 1. Figure 3 shows a modification of the flow scheme of Figure 2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In a representative example of a conventional high conversion hydrocracking process, a heavy gas oil is charged to the process and admixed with any hydrocarbon recycle stream. The resultant admixture of these two liquid phase streams is heated in an indirect heat exchange means and then combined with a hydrogen-rich recycle gas stream. The admixture of charge hydrocarbons, recycle hydrocarbons and fresh hydrogen is heated as necessary in a fired heater and thereby brought up to the desired inlet temperature for the hydrocracking reaction zone. Within the reaction zone the mixture of hydrocarbons and hydrogen are brought into contact with one or more beds of a solid hydrocracking catalyst maintained at hydrocracking conditions. This contacting results in the conversion of a significant portion of the entering hydrocarbons into molecules of lower molecular weight and therefore of lower boiling point.<br>
There is thereby produced a reaction zone effluent stream which comprises an admixture of the remaining hydrogen which was not consumed in the reactions, light hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane formed by the cracking of the feed hydrocarbons and reaction by-products such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia formed by hydrodesulfurization and hydro-denitrification reactions which occur within the process. The reaction zone effluent will also contain the desired product hydrocarbons boiling in the gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene or fuel oil boiling point ranges and some unconverted feed hydrocarbons boiling above the boiling point ranges of the desired products. The effluent of the hydrocracking reaction zone will therefore comprise an extremely broad and varied mixture of individual compounds.<br>
The hydrocracking reaction zone effluent is typically removed from the reactor, heat exchanged with the feed to the reaction zone and then passed into a vapor-liquid separation zone normally referred to as a high pressure separator. Additional cooling can be done prior to this separation. In some instances a hot flash separator is used upstream of the high pressure separator. The use of "cold" separators to remove condensate from vapor removed from a hot separator is another option.<br>
In the general parlance of the hydrocracking art, a "high pressure separator" is a vapor-liquid separation vessel which is maintained at a pressure close to the outlet pressure of preceding reactor. Mixed-phase high pressure reactor effluents are often passed into such separation zones as this allows the separation of the bulk of the hydrogen which is to be recycled to the reactor. This reduces the need for recompression and the cost of recycling the hydrogen. A significant pressure reduction, as down to a pressure below 3450 kPa (500 psig), results in a "low pressure" separation. If only minor and/or incidental cooling of the reactor effluent has been performed, then the separation zone is considered as a "hot" separation. Some heat may be recovered by a traditional reactor feed vs. effluent heat exchange and still result in an effluent of high enough temperature to be considered "hot". A "cold separator" is considered one operating at a temperature of less than 121 °C (250°F) and is typically located downstream of heat exchangers producing steam or discharging heat to air or cooling water.<br>
The liquids recovered in these vapor-liquid separation zones are passed into a product recovery zone containing one or more fractionation columns. Product recovery methods for hydrocracking are well known and conventional methods may be employed in the subject invention. In many instances the conversion achieved in the hydrocracking reactor(s) is not complete and some heavy hydrocarbons are removed from the product recovery zone as a "drag stream" which is removed from the process and/or as a recycle stream. The recycle stream is preferably passed into the hydrotreating (first) reactor in a hydrotreating-hydrocracking sequence as this reduces the capital cost of the overall unit. It may, however, sometimes be passed directly into a hydrocracking reactor.<br>
While conventional hydrocracking processes can provide high rates of feed conversion to valuable products and long cycle times between regeneration or replacement of the catalysts, the processes often provide less than desired selectivity to desired products. Much of the feed stream is converted to less desired, lower value by-products. The operation of the unit and the composition of the catalyst and the feed and recycle streams of a hydrocracking unit can be adjusted to maximize the production of desired products. However, many areas for improvement in hydrocracking still remain. It is an objective of the subject invention to provide a hydrocracking process providing flexible operation which may be adjusted to a variety of feed compositions or to compensation for changes in feed composition. A significant percentage of the feed to the subject process may have boiling points within the distillate boiling point ranges of the process. It is not desired to convert these compounds to lower boiling compounds, yet it is normally necessary to hydrotreat the entire feed stream including the compounds in the distillate fuel boiling point ranges. It is therefore another objective of the process to provide a hydrocracking process which can accommodate a feed having distillate boiling point components without promoting overconversion of these components.<br>
The subject process achieves this objective through the use of a novel arrangement of sequential high pressure separators (HPS) in a separator zone. The separator sequence allows control and adjustment of the rate at which intermediate and heavy feed fractions are passed into the hydrocracking zone.<br>
These separators may be employed in a modified series flow arrangement unique to the process. In the subject process the vapor phase material separated out in the first HPS is fed into the second HPS. The liquid phase from the first HPS is passed downstream, with preferably at least 25 volume percent of the liquid fraction passed directly into the hydrocracking reaction zone and a separate portion diverted around this zone. The first or second HPS may provide the light fraction that is passed to the hydrocracking reactor.<br>
The HPS vessels may contain some limited aids for separation, such as one or two trays or structured packing, to promote better separation than provided by a simple one-stage flash separation. Such HPS are referred to herein as augmented HPS. The high pressure in these vessels requires thick vessel walls and conduits which greatly increases the cost of the equipment to a degree that a larger volume device such as a column is prohibitively expensive. Thus the augmentation is minimalized. There is preferably no external reflux or reboiling of the HPS. Thus the separation in the high pressure separators will typically be inexact and there will typically be overlap of boiling point ranges of the fractions removed from a HPS.<br>
Since a separator by definition performs a division of the entering material, two separators cannot be truly used in series to perform the same separation. However, in the subject process some of the material separated in the first HPS is recombined and fed into the second HPS. Preferably at least 25 volume percent of each of the intermediate and heavy fractions withdrawn from the augmented first high pressure separator is passed into the second high pressure separator. An additional quantity preferably equal to at least 25 volume percent of each of the heavy and intermediate fractions withdrawn from the augmented high pressure separator may be passed directly into the hydrocracking reaction zone.<br>
In the subject process the second HPS is preferably operated at a pressure within 1034 kPa (150 psi) and more preferably within 689 kPa (100 psi) of the hydrotreating reactor. This preference in not reducing the pressure in the HPS is in order to avoid the very significant costs of recompressing the hydrogen rich gas which is recycled to the reaction zones.<br>
It is necessary to cool the vapor phase stream removed from the first HPS in order to effect further separation in the second HPS. The second HPS will therefore be operated at a temperature which is at least 27°C (SOT) and preferably between 55°C to 277°C (100 to 500°F) lower than the temperature in the first HPS. This separation of additional hydrocarbons from the vapor removed from the first HPS can also beneficially reduce the amount of hydrocarbons in the gas stream sent to the recycle gas loop.<br>
The process feed stream should have a 5% boiling point above 177°C (350°F) and preferably above 204°C (400° F). Therefore substantially all (at least 90 vol.%) of the process feed stream will fall within the boiling point range between 49°C (300°F) and 566°C (1050°F) and preferably between 177°C (350°F) and 530°C (1000°F). A feed can be made up of a mixture of petroleum fractions from different sources such as atmospheric and vacuum gas oils (AGO and VGO). The feed may contain a substantial percentage, e.g. 20-40 vol%, of material boiling in the diesel boiling point range. Suitable feedstocks for the subject process include virtually any heavy hydrocarbonaceous mineral or synthetic oil or a mixture of one or more fractions thereof. Thus, such known feedstocks as straight run gas oils, vacuum gas oils, demetallized oils, deasphalted vacuum residue, coker distillates, cat cracker distillates, shale oil, tar sand oil, coal liquids and the like are contemplated. The preferred feedstock will have a boiling point range starting at a temperature above 260°C. (500°F) and does not contain an appreciable concentration of asphaltenes. The hydrocracking feedstock may contain nitrogen, usually present as organonitrogen compounds in amounts between 1 ppm and 1.0 wt. %. The feed will normally also contain sulfur-containing compounds sufficient to provide a sulfur content greater than 0.15 wt.%.<br>
Conversion conditions employed in the reaction zones of the subject process are within the broad ranges known in the art for hydrocracking and hydretreating. The conditions chosen should provide only relatively low conversion reaching 40-50 vol.% per pass conversions of the feedstream components entering the hydrocracking reactor. Hydrocracking and hydrotreating reaction temperatures are in the broad range of 204 - 649°C (400° to 1200°F), preferably between 316 - 510°C (600° and 950°F). Reaction<br>
pressures are preferably between 13,780 to 24,130 kPa (1000 and 3000 psi). A temperature above 316°C and a total pressure above 8270 kPa (1200 psi) are highly preferred. The preferred direct connection between the hydrotreating and hydrocracking catalyst beds means that the pressure and temperature in the two catalyst beds will be linked and differ basically only by changes inherent in the operation of the process, e.g. pressure drop through the reaction zone and heat release by the exothermic reactions. However, heating or cooling by indirect heat exchange can be performed between the two zones. Admixture with the primary feed stream may also change the temperature between the reactors. Contact times in a hydrocracking reactor usually correspond to liquid hourly space velocities (LHSV) in the range of 0.1 hr"1 to 15 hr"1, preferably between 0.5 and 3 hr"1. In the subject process it is greatly preferred to operate with a significant recycle rate. Hydrogen circulation rates are in the broad range of 178 - 8,888 std. m3/m3 (1,000 to 50,000 standard cubic feet (scf) per barrel) of charge, and preferably between 355 - 3,555 std. m3/m3 (2,000 and 20,000 scf per barrel) of charge. This hydrogen preferably first passes through the hydrotreating reactor(s).<br>
Suitable catalysts for use in all reaction zones of this process are available commercially from a number of vendors. The primary difference between the hydrocracking and hydrotreating catalysts is the presence of a cracking component in the hydrocracking catalyst. The catalysts will both otherwise comprise hydrogenation components (metals) and inorganic oxide support components. It is preferred that the hydrocracking catalyst comprises between 1 wt. % and 90 wt. % Y zeolite, preferably between 10 wt. % and 80 wt. % as a cracking component. In the case of a monolith catalyst, compositions are in terms of the active wash coat layer unless otherwise stated. Such a zeolitic catalyst will normally also comprise a porous refractory inorganic oxide support (matrix) which may form between 10 and 99 wt. %, and preferably between 20 and 90 wt. % of the finished catalyst composite. The matrix may comprise any known refractory inorganic oxide such as alumina, magnesia, silica, titania, zirconia, silica-alumina and the like and preferably comprises a combination thereof such as silica-alumina. It is preferred that the support comprises from 5 wt. % to 45 wt. % alumina. A highly preferred matrix for a particulate hydrocracking catalyst<br>
comprises a mixture of silica-alumina and alumina wherein the silica-alumina comprises between 15 and 85 wt. % of said matrix.<br>
A Y-type zeolite preferred for use in the present invention possesses a unit cell size between 24.20 Angstroms and 24.45 Angstroms. Preferably, the zeolite unit cell size will be in the range of 24.20 to 24.40 Angstroms and most preferably 24.30 to 24.38 Angstroms. The Y zeolite is preferably dealuminated and has a framework SiO2Al2O3 ratio greater than 6, most preferably between 6 and 25. It is contemplated that other zeolites, such as Beta, Omega, L or ZSM-5, could be employed as the zeolitic component of the hydrocracking catalyst in place of or in addition to the preferred Y zeolite.<br>
A silica-alumina component of the hydrocracking or hydrotreating catalyst may be produced by any of the numerous techniques which are well described in the prior art relating thereto. One preferred alumina is referred to as Ziegler alumina and has been characterized in US-A-3,852,190 and US-A-4,012,313 by-product from a Ziegler higher alcohol synthesis reaction as described in Ziegler's US-A-2,892,858. A second preferred alumina is presently available from the Conoco Chemical Division of Continental Oil Company under the trademark "Catapal" which, after calcination at a high temperature, has been shown to yield a high purity gamma-alumina.<br>
The finished catalysts for utilization in the subject process should have a surface area of 200 to 700 square meters per gram, a pore diameter range of 20 to 300 Angstroms, a pore volume of 0.10 to 0.80 milliliters per gram, and an apparent bulk density within the range of from 0.50 to 0.90 gram/cc. Surface areas above 350 m2/g are greatly preferred.<br>
The composition and physical characteristics of the catalysts such as shape and surface area are not considered to be limiting in the utilization of the present invention. The catalysts may, for example, exist in the form of pills, pellets, granules, broken fragments, spheres, or various special shapes such as trilobal extrudates, disposed as a fixed bed within a reaction zone. The catalyst particles may be prepared by any method known in the art including the well-known oil drop and extrusion methods. A multitude of different extrudate shapes are possible, including, but not limited to, cylinders, cloverleaf, dumbbell and symmetrical and asymmetrical polylobates. It is also within the scope of this<br>
invention that the uncalcined extrudates may be further shaped to any desired form by means known to the art.<br>
Hydrogenation components may be added to the catalysts before or during the forming of the catalyst particles, but the hydrogenation components of the hydrocracking catalyst are preferably composited with the formed support by impregnation after the zeolite and inorganic oxide support materials have been formed to the desired shape, dried and calcined.<br>
Hydrogenation components contemplated for use in the catalysts are those catalytically active components selected from the Group VIB and Group VIII metals and their compounds. References herein to Groups of the Periodic Table are to the traditionally American form as reproduced in the fourth edition of Chemical Engineer's Handbook. J.H. Perry editor, McGraw-Hill, 1963. Generally, the amount of hydrogenation component(s) present in the final catalyst composition is small compared to the quantity of the other support components. The Group VIII component generally comprises 0.1 to 30% by weight, preferably 1 to 20% by weight of the final catalytic composite calculated on an elemental basis. The Group VIB component of the hydrocracking catalyst comprises 0.05 to 30% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 20% by weight of the final catalytic composite calculated on an elemental basis. The total amount of Group VIII metal and Group VIB metal in the finished catalyst in the hydrocracking catalyst is preferably less than 21 wt. percent. Concentrations of any of the more active and also more costly noble metals will be lower than for base metals e.g. 0.5-2.5 wt.%. The hydrogenation components contemplated for inclusion in the catalysts include one or more metals chosen from the group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten, chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhodium, and ruthenium. The hydrogenation components will most likely be present in the oxide form after calcination in air and may be converted to the sulfide form if desired by contact at elevated temperatures with a reducing atmosphere comprising hydrogen sulfide, a mercaptan or other sulfur containing compound. When desired, a phosphorus component may also be incorporated into the hydrotreating catalyst. If used phosphorus is normally present in the catalyst in the range of 1 to 30 wt. % and preferably 3 to 15 wt.% calculated as P2O5.<br><br>
One method of operation for the subject process can be readily discerned by reference to Figure 1. Referring now to the drawing, the feed stream enters the process via line 1 and is admixed with a hydrogen-rich gas stream passing through line 18. Make-up hydrogen may be added via line 17. The admixture of hydrogen and the feed stream flowing through line 2 may be heated by a means not shown. It is passed into the a hydrotreating reaction zone represented by the reactor 3. The reactions which occur in this zone result in the formation of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia and some light hydrocarbons by undesired side reactions but no substantial cracking of the heavier hydrocarbons which enter the reactor. There is thereby formed a mixed phase hydrotreating reaction zone effluent stream which is passed through line 4 into a first or augmented high pressure separator (AHPS) 5. This effluent stream comprises gases such as hydrogen, reaction products and liquid phase feed hydrocarbons.<br>
The internals and operation of the AHPS 5 are chosen to promote the separation of the entering compounds into three different fractions of overlapping composition. The lightest fraction is the 149°C (300°F) minus vapor-phase fraction removed through line 8 and passed into a second high pressure separator 10 via line 9. This fraction will contain the great majority of the hydrogen, volatile compounds, and light hydrocarbons having boiling points less than 149°C (300°F) which enter the first HPS. An intermediate second fraction intended to predominate in hydrocarbons boiling between 149°C 371 °C (300 and 700°F) is removed through line 7, and a liquid-phase heavy fraction rich in hydrocarbons boiling above 371 °C is removed through line 6. In the subject process both the intermediate fraction and the heavy fraction are then separated into at least two separate portions which are handled differently.<br>
A first portion equal to 25 to 80 vol. percent of the intermediate fraction of line 7 is passed into the second high pressure separator 10 via lines 19 and 21 by admixture with the light fraction of line 8 as shown. A second portion equal to at least 20 vol. percent of the intermediate fraction is diverted through line 20 for ultimate passage into the downstream hydrocracking reaction zone. In a similar manner a first portion equal to 40 to 85 vol. percent of the heavy fraction of line 6 is passed through line 21 to the second high pressure separator 10, and a second portion equal to at least 25 vol. percent of the heavy fraction is passed<br>
through line 22 into the line 23 for eventual passage into the hydrocracking reaction zone represented by reactor 25. The division of both the intermediate and heavy fractions is preferably controlled by flow control valves not shown to allow independent variation in the amount of each fraction which is passed into the HPS 10 and into the reactor 25. Thus the amount of material fed to the hydrocracking zone can be adjusted to compensate for changes in the feed stream composition or in the desired product slate. In any event the portion of the two streams passed into the HPS 10 bypasses the hydrocracking reactor and thus is only subjected to hydretreating.<br>
The gases and liquid-phase materials fed into the second high pressure separator 10 are separated into vapor and liquid phase fractions, with the entire liquid-phase fraction being passed into the low pressure flash drum (LPFD) 28 via line 27. The lower pressure in this separator causes vaporization of dissolved gases and light hydrocarbons which are removed in line 29 for passage into a gas processing zone. The remaining liquid phase fraction formed in this separation is passed via line 30 into a fractionation zone represented by the single column 31, although often comprising both a stripping column and at least one separation column. The liquid of line 30 is separated into distillate products such as a light naphtha of line 32, a kerosene of line 33 and a diesel boiling range product stream of line 34. The heaviest components are removed as a stream of unconverted oil carried by line 35. While characterized as unconverted oil, all of the hydrocarbons in this stream have been upgraded by hydrotreating and this material could also be referred to a stream of hydrotreated heavy hydrocarbons. Because of the hydrotreating this material will be very suitable as feedstock to a number of units including ethylene crackers, FCC units and lube oil plants.<br>
The vapor-phase fraction removed from the second high pressure separator via line 11 is preferably cooled to an intermediate temperature by a heat exchanger not shown and then passed into an optional scrubbing zone 12 where it is contacted with a liquid which adsorbs hydrogen sulfide. The cooling may cause condensation which would be handled via a separator not shown. The gas is removed from the scrubbing zone in line 13 and pressurized in the recycle gas compressor 14. The thus purified and hydrogen-rich recycle gas<br>
stream is then divided into the portion passed into the hydrotreating reactor 3 via line 16 and the portion passed into the hydrocracking zone reactor 25 via lines 15' and 24. The gas in line 15' is first admixed with the portions of the heavy and intermediate fractions removed from the first HPS 5 carried by line 23. This admixture is then passed into the hydrocracking reaction zone which may actually comprise two or more reactors in series or parallel flow. The contact of these hydrocarbons with the hydrocracking catalyst results in significant cracking of the entering hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules and the formation of additional products which eventually flow to the column 31. The mixed-phase effluent of the hydrocracking zone is passed via line 26 into the second high pressure separator 10.<br>
The amounts of the intermediate fraction of line 7 and of the heavy fraction of line 6 which are passed into the hydrocracking reactor are separately controlled. As the intermediate fraction already boils primarily in the distillate product boiling point ranges, the percentage of the intermediate fraction passed into the hydrocracking zone is expected to normally be less than that of the heavy fraction. While it is preferred that at least 25 vol. percent of each fraction is passed into the second HPS 10, the percentage can be much higher and reach 80 and 85 percent respectively. Thus, over three quarters of the feed stream may bypass the hydrocracking zone. Most of the heavy fraction will become part of the heavy hydrotreated product of line 35 with the result that this stream can have a flow rate equal to 20 to 60 vol. percent of the feed stream. The boiling point range of the feed and operational capability of the product fractionation columns will have a large impact on the amount of heavy bottoms produced by the process.<br>
Hydrocarbons removed from the bottom of the product recovery column as a bottoms stream are a high value product but are not considered to be either distillates or conversion products for purposes of the definition of conversion given above. The desired "distillate" products of a hydrocracking process are normally recovered as sidecuts of a product fractionation column and include the naphtha, kerosene and diesel fractions. The distillate product distribution of the subject process is set by the feed composition and the selectivity of the catalyst(s) at the conversion rate obtained in the reaction zones at the chosen operating<br><br>
conditions. It is, therefore, subject to considerable variation. The subject process is especially useful in the production of middle distillate fractions boiling in the range of 127-371 °C (260-700°F) as determined by the appropriate ASTM test procedure.<br>
The term "middle distillate" is intended to include the diesel, jet fuel and kerosene boiling range fractions. The terms "kerosene" and "jet fuel boiling point range" are intended to refer to 127-288°C (260-550°F) and diesel boiling range is intended to refer to hydrocarbon boiling points of 127-371 °C (260 -700°F). The gasoline or naphtha fraction is normally considered to be the C5 to 204°C (400°F) endpoint fraction of available hydrocarbons. The boiling point ranges of the various product fractions recovered in any particular refinery will vary with such factors as the characteristics of the crude oil source, the refinery's local markets, product prices, etc. Reference is made to ASTM standards D-975 and D-3699 for further details on kerosene and diesel fuel properties and to D-1655 for aviation turbine feed. These definitions provide for the inherent variation in feeds and desired products which exists between different refineries. Typically, product specifications will require the production of distillate hydrocarbons having boiling points below 371 °C (700°F).<br>
Figure 2 shows a variation in the process where the effluent from hydrocracking zone reactor 25 passes in admixture with primary feed stream 1 to the inlet of the hydrotreating reactor 3. The entire stream 4 is again passed into AHPS 5. The high pressure separator divides the streams into those described in conjunction with Figure 1. These reactions include the saturation of olefinic and aromatic hydrocarbons, and the denitrification and desulfurization of heterocompounds present in the stream entering the reactor. The denitrification and desulfurization reactions respectively form ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. The saturation of the aromatic compounds, which may be mono or multi-ring aromatic compounds, has a number of beneficial results. For instance, the smoke point of jet fuel boiling range hydrocarbons is increased by aromatics saturation, and the refractory nature of multi-ring aromatic hydrocarbons is reduced by hydrogenation.<br>
There is thereby produced a mixed phase, that is vapor and liquid phase, hydrotreating reaction zone effluent stream carried by line 3. This stream<br>
comprises a very broad admixture of compounds including hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, light hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane and butane, naphtha boiling range hydrocarbons, middle distillate boiling range product hydrocarbons and unconverted feed hydrocarbons. This entire stream is passed into an augmented high pressure separator (AHPS) 4. The augmentation consists of vessel internals which promote a better separation into three fractions of different but overlapping compositions. While this could be done much more precisely in a fractionation column, economic constraints render the use of such a large volume, high pressure device impractical. Economics demands a crude separation. Thus, there is no refluxing or reboiling of the AHPS.<br>
The AHPS 4 is designed and operated to separate the entering chemical compounds into at least 3 separate process streams. The lightest process stream comprises the hydrogen, H2S and lightest hydrocarbons. This process stream is referred to as a 300°F minus stream and is removed from the top of the AHPS 4 through line 5 as a vapor phase stream. The terminology 300° minus is intended to indicate it contains those hydrocarbons having boiling points below 300°F. An intermediate process stream comprising mostly hydrocarbons having boiling points between 300 to 700°F is withdrawn as a sidecut through line 6. The third process stream withdrawn from the AHPS 4 comprises the heaviest of the compounds which enter the separator and it should contain primarily compounds having boiling points above 371 °C (700°F). It will, however, contain some lighter material. That is the stream of line 8 is combined with a first portion of the intermediate process stream carried by line 7 and line 7' and passed through lines 8 and 9 into HPS 10. Lines 6 and 21 also pass a first portion of the liquid-phase heavy process stream removed from the AHPS 5 into HPS 10.<br>
High pressure separator 10 is again operated at conditions to separate of the entering compounds into a vapor-phase stream removed through line 11, plus the liquid phase stream removed through line 27 and comprising the remainder of the compounds which enter the high pressure separator 10. Line 27 passes this liquid phase material into a low pressure flash drum 24 with the liquid phase stream carried by line 25 into the product recovery zone to perform the separation previously described. Instead of splitting the recycle stream from<br>
line 15 it passes with the contents of line 22' that carries an admixture formed from portions of the intermediate process stream and the heavy process streams; that is, the 149 to 371 °C (300 to 700°F) hydrocarbons from the AHPS 5 plus a fraction of the 371 °C (700°F) plus material removed via line 6 from AHPS 5. Line 16 again carries the recycle hydrocarbon stream of the subject process. This stream is combined with the recycle hydrogen stream of line 17 and passed through line 18 and into the hydrocracking reactor 25. The reactor 25 is again maintained at low conversion hydrocracking conditions by heaters and/or heat exchangers not shown.<br>
Figure 3 shows another arrangement of high pressure separators for use in accordance with this invention. The feed stream enters the process via line 1 and is admixed with a hydrogen-rich gas stream as previously described and it is then passed into the hydrotreating reaction zone represented by the reactor 3.<br>
An HPS 5' operates to separate the entering compounds into vapor and liquid fractions, which will have somewhat overlapping composition. A 371 °C (700°F) minus vapor-phase fraction removed through line 8 and passes into second HPS 10. This fraction contains the great majority of the hydrogen and the light and intermediate hydrocarbons having boiling points less than 371 °C (700°F). A liquid-phase heavy fraction rich in hydrocarbons boiling above 371 °C (700°F) is removed through line 6. A first portion of the line 6 contents equal to 25 to 80 vol. percent of the heavy fraction of line 6 is separately passed into hydrocracking reactor 25 via lines 37, 36 and 24. The remaining second portion of the heavy fraction of line 6 is diverted through line 38 for passage into the third high pressure separator 39 via line 40. It is preferred that this second portion is also equal to at least 25 volume percent of the heavy fraction of line 6. This division of the heavy fraction is preferably controlled by flow control valves not shown to allow variation in the amount of the fraction which is passed into the HPS 39 and into the reactor 25. Thus the amount of material fed to the hydrocracking zone can be adjusted to compensate for changes in the feed stream composition or in the desired product slate or product quality. In any event the portion of the liquid fraction passed into the HPS 39 bypasses the hydrocracking reactor and thus is only subjected to hydrotreating.<br>
In this arrangement HPS 8 separates the entering materials into a second set of vapor and liquid phase fractions, with a process stream containing the entire intermediate liquid-phase fraction being passed into the hydrocracking zone 25 via lines 7', 36 and 24. The remaining vapor phase fraction passes optionally into the amine scrubbing zone 12 and then for recompression and recycling through lines 15,16 and 18 as previously described. The hydrocracking reaction zone 25 receives the remainder of the recycle stream via line 15' and 24. The mixed-phase effluent of the hydrocracking zone is passed via lines 26 and 40 into the third high pressure separator 39. This separator concentrates hydrogen from the effluent into a gas stream of line 20', leaving the liquid-phase process stream of line 41, which is sent to the product recovery zone and separated in the manner previously described.<br>
It is therefore apparent that the subject process is characterized by the use of two high pressure separators in series, with the first separator optionally forming three streams of relative light, intermediate and heavy materials. Only a portion of the heavy and intermediate fraction, but all of the light fraction enter the second high pressure separator. The division and separate handling of the light, heavy and, when present, intermediate process streams removed from the first high pressure separator distinguish the subject process from those of the art,<br><br><br><br>
