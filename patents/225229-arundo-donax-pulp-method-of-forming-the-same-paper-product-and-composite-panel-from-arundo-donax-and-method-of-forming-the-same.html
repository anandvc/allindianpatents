				<td>"ARUNDO DONAX PULP, METHOD OF FORMING THE<br>
,SAME, PAPER PRODUCT AND COMPOSITE PANEL FROM<br>
ARUNDO DONAX, AND METHOD OF FORMING THE SAME"<br>
The invention relates to arundo donax pulp, method of forming the same, paper<br>
product and composite panel from arundo donax, and method of forming the same.<br>
Arundo donax is a type of grass.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
There are several well-known technologies for producing particle board, using<br>
wood chips and other wood processing waste products. Indeed, these wood-based<br>
composite boards have found wide application particularly in building construction and<br>
the manufacture of furniture. More recently, the industry has produced oriented strand<br>
board (OSB) as a useful construction material. Both particle board and OSB fall into the<br>
category of "composites" because both contain a filler (wood fiber) embedded within a<br>
binder matrix. Another well-known wood composite is "MDF" (medium density fiber<br>
board). Other well known composite products are made with wood or other fibers using<br>
inorganic binders, such as cement, to make construction and decorative products.<br>
The popularity of wood-based composites is based in large part on the availability<br>
of relatively low cost wood byproducts (chips, sawdust, etc.) that can be used in the<br>
composites. Indeed, many of the industry standards for the physical performance of these<br>
composites are based on wood-based composites. Since the manufacturing parameters<br>
for wood-based composites are well-known, and can often be customized for certain<br>
applications, there has been little incentive to investigate other fillers.<br>
With the increasing demand for paper prepared from wood pulp, as well as<br>
worldwide demand for wood-based composites (which can substitute for lumber), there is<br>
now a perceived growing need for a substitute raw material for wood. While the supply<br>
of wood for use in these products is "renewable," it requires setting aside land for long<br>
periods of time for tree fanning. Moreover, when demand outstrips supply, because<br>
supply is based on forecasts of decades before when trees were planted, then a shortage<br>
inevitably develops. Since the wood required for these uses results in cutting millions of<br>
acres of forest each year, such shortages lead to serious worldwide concerns about large<br>
scale deforestation and its contribution to global warming.<br>
There is yet a need for a material that can be readily substituted for wood in<br>
wood-based composites, and that can also be used to produce paper pulp for the<br>
fabrication of paper products. Extensive research had been conducted and production<br>
trials have been made in an effort to find a suitable non-wood fiber for composites and<br>
pulp but, until now, this work has met with very little success due to inferior properties,<br>
excessive costs and many commercial production drawbacks.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one aspect of the invention, Arundo donax particles are provided. The<br>
particles, including chips and flakes, can be advantageously formed into pulp from which<br>
paper and paper products can be made. The particles can also be used in the production<br>
of particle boards.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides composites that include a binder matrix<br>
filled with Arundo donax particulates. In accordance with the invention, these composite<br>
boards use significantly less binder than wood-based composites, and exceed several of<br>
the physical properties of comparable wood-based composites, as measured by standards<br>
used in the industry.<br>
The composites of the invention are produced by selecting nalgrass (a common<br>
name for Arundo donax), which is widely distributed as a native wild grass in many parts<br>
of the world. The nalgrass is charged to a flaker which contains sharp internal knife<br>
edges to reduce the nalgrass to small shards (e.g., flakes), which can then be charged to a<br>
hammermill for further size reduction. The resulting material is called a "furnish." The<br>
hammermill furnish is sized, preferably into at least two fractions. Each of the two<br>
fractions of nalgrass particulates is separately combined with a proportion of a resin. A<br>
layered structure, having alternate layers of fine and coarse nalgrass-resin mixture is then<br>
produced. The layered structure is subjected to heat and pressure for consolidation into a<br>
composite product. Satisfactory products may be made with a single layer, two layers, or<br>
more. Many commercial operations blend a variety of wood sources, such as hardwoods,<br>
softwoods, and recycled wood waste, in the manufacture of composites. Those skilled in<br>
the field will seek the advantages of nalgrass by blending into their furnish a portion of<br>
nalgrass with their available wood sources.<br>
The invention also provides paper pulp, and paper products made from nalgrass.<br>
The raw pulp produced from the nalgrass is of lighter color than the pulp produced from<br>
woods that are typically used in paper production. Accordingly, a smaller amount of<br>
chemical bleach must be added to bleach the pulp to a desired whiteness. Nalgrass pulp<br>
is also stronger than most common hardwoods, such as aspen. The pulp of the present<br>
invention can also be utilized in other cellulose-based products including building<br>
products and modified cellulosic fibers such as viscose (e.g., rayon).<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The composites of the invention utilize a raw material that is abundant, but that<br>
has been regarded as a weed, unsuitable for any use other than stabilizing soil on slopes,<br>
windbreaks, and the manufacture of woodwind instruments. The raw material is of the<br>
genus Arundo of the family Gramineae, tribe Festuccae. It includes about six species, of<br>
which Arundo donax L. is the most widely distributed and the best known. Arundo<br>
donax, also known as "nalgrass," is native to the countries surrounding the Mediterranean<br>
Sea. The terms "nalgrass" and "Arundo donax" are used interchangeably herein.<br>
Nalgrass is a tall, erect, perennial grass and at maturity reaches 7-28 feet in<br>
height. In optimum climate, it grows at a rate of six inches per day during most of the<br>
year and can reach maturity in one to one and a half years. In infertile soils, yields are in<br>
the range of 8 tons dry nalgrass material per acre. Test cutting in southern California<br>
resulted in yields of more than 30 tons dry nalgrass material per acre. It is estimated that<br>
the sustainable yield of dry fiber from 50,000 acres of nalgrass is the equivalent of<br>
1,250,000 acres of tree wood fiber. It is one of the largest of the herbaceous grasses.<br>
Unlike bamboo, kenaf, and other grasses, the stalks are hollow, with walls 2 to 7 mm.<br>
thick and divided by partitions at the nodes. The nodes vary in length from<br>
approximately 12 to 30 cm. The outer tissue of the stem is of a siliceous nature, very<br>
hard and brittle with a smooth, glossy surface that turns pale golden yellow when fully<br>
mature.<br>
The vascular bundles of nalgrass are distributed freely throughout the cross-<br>
sectional area of its fundamental parenchyma. Those toward the periphery of the stem<br>
are smaller and more numerous than those toward the interior. These bundles are<br>
collateral and are surrounded by one or more rows of thick-walled, strongly lignified<br>
fibers. Toward the periphery of the stem, as the size of the bundles decreases, the<br>
number of rows of fibers associated with the bundles are small and comparatively close<br>
together, the fibers are sufficiently abundant to form a continuous ring of structural tissue<br>
within which are scattered the vascular elements. This structural ring is separated from a<br>
wax-covered single cell epidermal layer by a narrow band of parenchyma cells that in<br>
mature stems are comparatively small, thick-walled, and lignified. The vascular bundles,<br>
including the associated fibers interior to the structural fibrous ring, occupy<br>
approximately 24% of the stem. The vascular tissue and associated fibers that compose<br>
the structural ring make up approximately 33% of the total cross-sectional area. Thus,<br>
parenchymatous tissue occupies but 43% of the cross-sectional area of the stem.<br>
Both leaves and stems of nalgrass, particularly the former, contain numerous<br>
highly silicified cells. These cells, associated with the vascular bundles, are also located in<br>
the epidermal tissue. Their presence explains the elevated silica count that has been<br>
indicated by chemical analyses<br>
The equipment necessary for manufacturing the composites of the invention are<br>
commercially available, and may have to be modified to optimize production.<br>
Nevertheless, commercially available equipment can readily be used in the process.<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides an Arundo donax particle. The<br>
particle is either a chip or a flake and can be used either in the formation of pulp, paper<br>
products derived from the pulp, or incorporated into composite panels.<br>
The chip is formed from an Arundo donax stem by cutting the stem across its<br>
length to provide a ring having a substantially circular cross section in a length from<br>
about 1/8 inch to about 3 inches. Breaking the ring's circular cross section provides the<br>
chip. Typically, when the ring is broken two to five chips are formed. Referring to<br>
FIGURE 1, Arundo donax's stem 1 provides ring 2 from which chips 3 are formed. A<br>
representative device and method for forming Arundo donax's chips is described in<br>
Example 1. Preferably, the ring has a length from about ½ to about 1½ inches and is<br>
formed by cutting the stem either by a saw cut, a knife blade or a veneer cut.<br>
In addition to chips, suitable Arundo donax particles include flakes. The flakes<br>
are formed from flaking an Arundo donax stem in any one of a number of conventional<br>
flakers. Preferably, the flake (i.e., shard, sliver) has a length from about two inches to<br>
about four inches and preferably from about 2½ to about 3½ inches. Flake thickness can<br>
vary greatly from about 1/32 of an inch to about 1/8 of an inch. Referring to FIGURE 1,<br>
flaking stem 1 provides flake 4. Suitable flakes can be prepared from conventional<br>
equipment including ring, drum, and disc flakers and chippers. Preferably, flakes are<br>
formed using a drum flaker.<br>
As discussed below, Arundo donax particles (e.g., flakes and chips) can be<br>
advantageously used in the production of composite panels, pulp, and paper products.<br>
Chips can be advantageously used in the formation of pulp including continuous or batch<br>
pulping processes. Arundo donax flakes can also be pulped, preferably by batch digestion<br>
processes. In kraft pulping the flakes and/or chips are directly digested. In CTMP<br>
(alkaline peroxide) pulping, the flakes and/or chips can be reduced in size prior to<br>
digestion. For composite panel (e.g., particle board) formation, the flakes and/or chips<br>
are typically reduced in size by hammermilling to provide a furnish which is then mixed<br>
with a binder such as a resinous binder and then consolidated into a panel.<br>
A representative method for forming a composite panel is illustrated in FIGURE<br>
5. Referring to FIGURE 5, in a first step clean nalgrass is charged to a flaker or<br>
chipper 10 which contains internal sharp edges for cutting the nalgrass to a reduced size.<br>
Typically, a size distribution of nalgrass is obtained from the flaker. Preferably, nalgrass<br>
particulates having a length of about one inch, and up to about four inches, are produced<br>
by the flaker, if the resultant furnish is to be used to manufacture composites. If the<br>
particulates are to be used to manufacture paper pulp, then it is preferred that they be<br>
smaller, typically in the range one-half inch to about 1½ inches in length.<br>
The nalgrass particulates are then charged to a hammermill 20 for further<br>
comminution. It should be understood that other apparatus commonly used for<br>
comminution of cellulosic materials may also be used, and that the invention is not limited<br>
to the use of flakers, chippers, and hammermills. The hammermill further reduces the size<br>
of the nalgrass particulates and produces a size distribution of the furnish.<br>
The particulates from the hammermill are then preferably charged to a series of<br>
mesh sieves 30 for sizing. Preferably, the sieves are arranged to produce at least three<br>
cuts or size distributions of nalgrass particulates. Thus, it is preferred to use a first sieve<br>
of 48 mesh size to remove undersized nalgrass "dust." Thereafter, the oversized<br>
particulates are charged to a second sieve of mesh size 14. This sieve produces an<br>
undersize and an oversize. Material that does not pass through a 4 mesh (over one-<br>
quarter inch) is removed and reworked.<br>
The undersized material is finer and is used to make the "face" layers 100 of the<br>
composites shown in FIGURE 6. The oversize material, which is relatively coarser, is<br>
used for the core layer 120 or layers of the composite. Typically, a composite comprises<br>
three layers: a central core covered on each side by a face layer. However, additional<br>
layers can also be added, depending upon customer requirements, physical property<br>
requirements, and other factors.<br>
The undersize or "face nalgrass particulates" are mixed with a resin 40 to form a<br>
"face material mixture" of resin-coated particulates. Separately, the core material is also<br>
mixed with the resin to form a "core material mixture."<br>
While any of the organic resins and inorganic binders conventionally used in the<br>
manufacture of wood products may also be used to make nalgrass composites, the<br>
preferred resin is methyl diisocyanate ("MDI"). It has been found that MDI resin results<br>
in the production of composites having superior properties. Without being bound, it is<br>
theorized that the nalgrass-MDI resin combination may produce these enhanced physical<br>
properties due to a combination of any of the listed physical properties of nalgrass in<br>
combination with moieties of the MDI resin molecule: high melting point waxes present<br>
in the nalgrass, elevated silica content of the nalgrass, high-alpha cellulose content of the<br>
nalgrass, and low lignin content of the nalgrass.<br>
Regardless of theory, it has also been found that the manufacture of nalgrass<br>
composites requires a lower proportion of resin additive, than would be required with a<br>
wood-based composite of a similar physical dimensions and strength. Indeed, nalgrass<br>
composites of the invention may be prepared with as little as 1.5 weight percent MDI.<br>
Typically, the resin proportion may range from about 1.5 to about 5 weight percent MDI<br>
depending upon the composite physical properties required. More than 5 weight percent<br>
MDI may also be used but there appears to be of little commercial advantage to produce<br>
such composites. Generally, the higher the proportion of resin added, the stronger the<br>
composite. Preferably, the nalgrass-resin mixture contains from about 1.5 to about<br>
3.5 weight percent MDI, and most preferably from about 2.5 to about 3.0 weight percent<br>
MDI. Clearly, when a resin other than MDI is used, a different resin proportion may be<br>
found optimal, depending upon the physical properties required of the composite.<br>
After the nalgrass-resin mixtures have been prepared, they are conveyed to "mat<br>
forming" 60. In this process, the face material mixture is first laid down in a layer. This<br>
is followed by a layer of core material mixture, which is covered by a final layer of face<br>
mixture, to form a three-layer sandwich. More or less layers can also be used depending<br>
upon the desired properties of the resultant composite.<br>
The layered mat is prepressed 70 under ambient conditions to reduce its volume,<br>
by allowing limited movement of particulates to fill in interstitial and void spaces. The<br>
prepressed layered structure is then pressed, in a conventional press used for the<br>
production of wood-based composites, and subjected to sufficient heat and pressure to<br>
consolidate the panel 80. When MDI resin is used, the press is typically operated at a<br>
temperature in the range of 160-170°C (320-340°F), and under pressure of between 500-<br>
600 psi (maximum) during the closing cycle and about 100 psi during the curing cycle.<br>
During pressing, some of the mixture may spread outward, resulting in a relatively<br>
uneven edge to the consolidated composite. The panel edges are trimmed, and the board<br>
is cut to size to produce a composite board of standard size. The formation of<br>
representative nalgrass particle boards and their properties as well as wheatstraw-based<br>
particle boards and southern pine-based particle boards is described in Example 2.<br>
As noted above, the nalgrass furnish may be mixed with proportions of wood<br>
furnish to prepare composites in accordance with the invention. Preferably, the nalgrass<br>
forms the major proportion of the furnish due to its lower cost. The formation of<br>
representative nalgrass/southern pine particle boards and their properties are described in<br>
Example 3. The mechanical and physical properties of the nalgrass/southern pine blend<br>
particle boards are compared to particle boards formed from (1) nalgrass and<br>
(2) southern pine in that example.<br>
The Arundo donax composite panel includes a binder matrix and Arundo donax<br>
particles (e.g., chips, flakes, and chips and flakes having reduced size) distributed<br>
throughout the binder matrix. Referring to Tables 1 and 2, the composite panels of the<br>
present invention meet at least the M-3 standard for composite panels.<br>
The panels include from about 1% to about 10% by weight of a resin binder based<br>
on the total weight of the panel. However, to achieve the advantageous properties<br>
associated with wood panels, the presence of Arundo donax in the composite panels of<br>
the present invention permits a much lower amount of binder. Accordingly, the panels<br>
preferably include from about 1.5% to about 3.0% by weight of resin binder based on the<br>
total weight of the panel. Conventional binders known in the formation of composite<br>
panels can be used to provide the panels of the invention. Preferred binders include<br>
methyl diisocyanate, urea-formaldehyde, and phenolic binders.<br>
The panels of the present invention can further include other fibers including<br>
wood fibers. Preferably, the panels of the invention that include a blend of fibers have<br>
from about 10% to about 90% by weight Arundo donax particles based on the total<br>
weight of the panel.<br>
Generally, the bending strength and moisture resistance of the panels of the<br>
invention are increased proportionally relative to the amount of Arundo donax present in<br>
the panel compared to conventional wood-based panels. Generally, the bending strength<br>
of the panel is about 55% greater than a similar constituted wood-based panel, and about<br>
5% greater than a similarly constituted wheatstraw-based panel. The moisture resistance<br>
of the panel is about 2.6 times greater than a similarly constituted wood-based panel and<br>
about 15% greater than a similarly constituted wheatstraw-based panel.<br>
A representative method for manufacturing an Arundo donax composite panel<br>
includes the steps of (1) comminuting Arundo donax into particles of a size distribution<br>
suitable for use as a furnish in a composite panel; (2) mixing those particles with a binder<br>
(e.g., resin) to provide a binder-particle mixture; and (3) consolidating the binder-particle<br>
mixture into a composite panel. In the process, the Arundo donax particles are bonded<br>
into a contiguous material with the resin. As noted above, the particle-binder mixture can<br>
further include other materials such as, for example, wood particles and fibers.<br>
As described above, Arundo donax can be advantageously incorporated into<br>
particle board. Similar advantages can be obtained through the incorporation of Arundo<br>
donax in oriented strand board (OSB) and medium density fiberboard (MDF). Arundo<br>
donax can be incorporated as the sole particular component or as a component in a<br>
particle blend.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, nalgrass is utilized as a raw material for the<br>
preparation of pulp and paper products produced from this pulp. Arundo donax pulp<br>
comprises fibers obtained from the treatment of Arundo donax particles (e.g., chips and<br>
flakes). Depending upon the pulp, in addition to treatment, the particles can also be<br>
subject to comminution. Comminution can be performed by a number of devices<br>
including, for example, a hammermill or a rotary disc refiner.<br>
As discussed below, the pulp can be formed from a number of different treatments<br>
including, for example, kraft pulping, soda pulping, alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping<br>
(CTMP), sulfite, and other pulping processes known in theart. The pulping process can<br>
also include bleaching. In a preferred process, the bleaching step includes Elemental<br>
Chlorine-Free bleaching.<br>
The Arundo donax pulp of the present invention has a freeness in a range from<br>
about 150-750 CSF and has a brightness of at least about 55% ISO, and preferably at<br>
t about 75% ISO.<br>
The pulp forming methods of the invention provide a pulp yield of about 50%.<br>
The yield is comparable to that of hardwood yields and significantly greater than that<br>
obtained from kenaf. The yields obtained from Arundo donax, hardwood, and kenaf are<br>
illustrated in FIGURE 7. Referring to FIGURE 7, the initial yields of usable kenaf,<br>
hardwood, and Arundo donax are about 50 pounds/100 pounds, about 88 pounds/100<br>
pounds, and about 99 pounds/100 pounds, respectively. For kenaf, separation of the pith<br>
greatly reduces the usable amount of fiber. For hardwood, debarking provides a<br>
relatively high amount of fiber for further processing. Arundo donax initial processing<br>
removes only the leaves from the stem, which are unusable, leaving the majority of the<br>
Arundo donax (i.e., about 99%) usable for further processing. Following initial<br>
processing, the kenaf, hardwood and Arundo fibers are then digested with a typical yield<br>
being about 50%. As illustrated in FIGURE 7, the power (steam requirement, BTU/ton)<br>
and chemical requirements (lbs/ton) for pulping Arundo donax is significantly less than<br>
for pulping of either kenaf or hardwood fibers. The power requirement for Arundo<br>
donax pulping is approximately 88% that of kenaf and about 73% of hardwood digestion.<br>
Furthermore, Arundo donax pulping requires about 83% of the amount of the chemicals<br>
needed to convert the raw fibers to usable pulp. The overall pulp yields for kenaf,<br>
hardwood, and Arundo donax are about 28%, 44%, and 50%, respectively. Thus, the<br>
use of Arundo donax in the formation of pulp and subsequent paper products, offers<br>
significant economic advantages through lower energy and chemical requirements<br>
compared to hardwood and other non-wood materials. As illustrated in the examples, the<br>
characteristics of Arundo donax pulp, paper products, and particle boards is generally<br>
comparable or superior to wood-based and nonwood-based counterparts.<br>
The pulp has a better tear and tensile, strength than aspen pulp. This is an<br>
important property affecting paper production efficiency. Also, the nalgrass furnish uses<br>
less chemical and energy to produce pulp.<br>
The bulk density of nalgrass chips is somewhat higher than that of typical wood<br>
chins. Accordingly, digester loading would be proportionately higher for nalgrass chips<br>
than for wood chips. This is an important consideration for those paper and pulp<br>
manufacturers that are limited in capacity due to digester through-put limitations.<br>
In contrast to wood chips, which require a moisture content of about 50 percent<br>
for efficient pulping, nalgrass particles having significantly lower moisture content, less<br>
than about 10 percent, can be directly and readily digested.<br>
The nalgrass chips or particulates are readily susceptible to digestion, and cook<br>
very readily as compared to wood under kraft conditions for wood. The yield of<br>
unbleached pulp is of the order of 48.5%, which at the upper end of the range for<br>
bleachable kraft pulps, with the possible exception of aspen (which produces yields in the<br>
range 55 to 58%). Importantly, the pulp of nalgrass has a lighter color than typically<br>
obtained from hardwood. Accordingly, a lower amount of bleaching chemicals is added<br>
to produce the same resultant treated brightness. The brown stock produced from<br>
nalgrass is very easily bleached with a DEDED sequence to 89.9% ISO brightness at a<br>
93.9% yield. The brown stock can also be readily bleached by the Elemental Chlorine<br>
Free (ECF) method, a three-stage method, as described in Example 4 and FIGURE 8. In<br>
a representative ECF process, pulp brightness of about 85% ISO was obtained.<br>
The weighted average fiber length of nalgrass pulp is about 0.97 millimeter, and<br>
the coarseness is of the order of 0.13 milligram per meter. Both of these values are<br>
somewhat higher than obtained from aspen pulp.<br>
Nalgrass pulp may be used to prepare paper, such as wood-free uncoated papers,<br>
and may also be blended with wood pulps to produce other products. Nalgrass wood<br>
pulp is also suitable for the production of corrugating medium. Nalgrass furnish may be<br>
blended with wood furnish to produce a mixed pulp product suitable for many uses.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, methods for forming Arundo donax<br>
pulp are provided. In these methods, Arundo donax particles such as chips and flakes are<br>
pulped.<br>
In one method, Arundo donax pulp is formed by selecting a furnish that includes<br>
Arundo donax particles and subjecting the furnish to a pulping process to produce a<br>
brown stock of pulp having a yield of about 48% by weight based on the furnish.<br>
Generally, the pulping time for the method, which achieves a 48% yield and a kappa<br>
value of about 15, is about 25% less than required for pulping hardwood to achieve the<br>
same yield and kappa value.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for forming an<br>
Arundo donax pulp that includes the steps of: (1) selecting a furnish that includes<br>
Arundo donax particles; (2) subjecting the furnish to a pulping process to produce a<br>
brown stock of pulp having a yield of about 48% by weight based on the furnish; and<br>
(3) bleaching the brown stock to a brightness of from about 55% to about 90% ISO. In<br>
the method, bleaching the brown stock to a brightness of about 90% ISO requires about<br>
25% less bleach than required for bleaching hardwood to about the same brightness.<br>
In another embodiment of the method of the invention, Arundo donax pulp is<br>
formed by: (1) subjecting Arundo donax particles to a bleaching chemical to provide a<br>
bleached furnish; and (2) mechanically refining the bleach pulp furnish to provide a pulp<br>
stock having a brightness of from about 55% to 90% ISO. The bleaching chemicals can<br>
be any one of a variety of bleaching chemicals known to those in the pulping art.<br>
Preferred bleaching chemicals include a mixture of hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide,<br>
and sodium silicate (alkaline peroxide pulping). Alternatively, the bleaching chemical can<br>
include chlorine dioxide.<br>
A flow chart illustrating two representative pulping processes is shown in<br>
FIGURE 8. Referring to FIGURE 8, kraft pulping and bleaching and chemimechanical<br>
pulping (alkaline peroxide) processes are illustrated. Briefly, in these processes nalgrass<br>
stems are processed to form nalgrass particles (e.g., chips and/or flakes). For kraft<br>
pulping and bleaching, the nalgrass particles are digested in a cooking liquor. The<br>
digested material is then washed and the waste liquor recycled into the cooking liquor for<br>
continuous processing. The result of digestion is a pulp product that is then bleached.<br>
As illustrated in FIGURE 8, bleaching can include the steps of a first chlorine dioxide<br>
bleaching step followed by an extraction step which is then followed by a second chlorine<br>
dioxide bleaching step. Following bleaching, the pulp is then washed and either directed<br>
to a paper machine for paper formation or pressed and dried for shipping to market. The<br>
pressed and dried pulp is referred to as market pulp.<br>
For chemimechanical pulping, the nalgrass particles are impregnated with<br>
chemical (an alkaline peroxide mixture of hydrogen peroxide, sodium hydroxide, and<br>
sodium silicate). Following chemical impregnation, the resulting treated pulp is<br>
mechanically refined and then washed. After washing the pulp can either be directed to a<br>
paper machine or dried and baled and shipped to market.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, Arundo donax paper products are<br>
provided. The paper products include Arundo donax pulp. The incorporation of Arundo<br>
donax pulp into the paper products provides advantageous brightness as well as strength<br>
(i.e., burst, tear, and tensile). The utilizing of Arundo donax in the production of paper,<br>
its pulping behavior and pulping properties are described in Example 4. In Example 4,<br>
data from kraft pulping, soda pulping, and alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping is<br>
presented. The results for Arundo donax are compared to those obtained for wheatstraw<br>
and wood.<br>
The Arundo donax paper products are generally formed by a method that includes<br>
the steps of: (1) forming an Arundo donax furnish that includes fibers and an aqueous<br>
dispersion medium (e.g., water); (2) depositing the furnish onto a foraminous support<br>
(e.g., a forming wire); (3) dewatering the deposited furnish to provide a fibrous web; and<br>
(4) drying the web to provide a paper product.<br>
The Arundo donax paper products of the present invention can further include<br>
other materials and can include a pulp blend, such as a blend of Arundo donax and<br>
softwood and/or hardwood pulp. Accordingly, in the method described above, the<br>
Arundo donax furnish can further include wood fibers.<br>
The advantageous properties of Arundo donax can be obtained by incorporating<br>
from about 5% to about 85% by weight Arundo donax pulp in the paper product.<br>
Generally, the paper product of the present invention has a brightness of at least about<br>
82% ISO, a burst index of at least about 3.0, a tear index of at least about 8.5, and a<br>
tensile index of at least about 50. Depending upon the characteristics of the pulp, the<br>
paper products of the present invention include high brightness printing and writing grade<br>
paper, news print and publication printing grade, and unbleached liner and corrugation<br>
boards.<br>
The following examples are provided for the purposes of illustration and not<br>
limitation.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Equipment. Processes, and Methods for Nalgrass Size Reduction<br>
In this example, cutting or macerating nalgrass, more specifically cutting nalgrass<br>
into particles that are suitable for processing into digested pulp or for efficient processing<br>
into composite panels and/or engineered wood products, is described.<br>
Fairly sophisticated processing equipment has been developed over many years,<br>
by the forest and wood products industries, for size reduction of logs, sawmill shavings,<br>
waste lumber, etc. The equipment and handling methods have been designed to produce<br>
particles of specific geometry for use in modern digesters for the manufacture of pulp and<br>
in milling equipment for wood composites, namely, particleboard, oriented strand board<br>
(OSB), and medium density fiberboard (MDF). During the development work, several<br>
types and models of wood chippers and flakers were tested. The resulting particles were<br>
satisfactory for laboratory and pilot scale work but it quickly became evident that such<br>
particle geometry was less satisfactory for commercial application.<br>
Generally, the conventional equipment, ring, drum, and disc flakers and chippers,<br>
and various tub and agricultural and "roadside/yard" grinders, produced many long flakes,<br>
shards, and slivers. The action of these machines tend to pull the hollow nalgrass stems<br>
into the blades and shred the long fibers as if peeling layers. Long shards and slivers tend<br>
to blind screens and conveyors generally used in pulp digesters and handling equipment<br>
used in composite panel plants.<br>
Enough material was screened and recovered during the trials to conduct the<br>
scientific work, but it was clear that more work was needed to efficiently reduce nalgrass<br>
size for commercial processes. Further investigation has shown that conventional<br>
equipment used for wood may not produce satisfactory particle geometry for modern<br>
continuous pulp digesters nor for many composite panel processing plants. The desired<br>
particle geometry is a chip of ¾ to 1 inch long by ¼ to ¾ inch wide by approximately<br>
3/16 inch thick. (Note: these dimensions apply broadly to most commercial operating<br>
mills but could vary somewhat for certain operations.) Further, certain pulping<br>
equipment and processes, used principally outside the United States, can utilize a wider<br>
range of particle geometry.<br>
One representative device and method for preparing desired particle geometry for<br>
nalgrass is shown in FIGURES 2-4. This same concept may be applied to upgrading<br>
agricultural straws and prunings, roadside and yard clean-up, etc.<br>
The usable stem portion of nalgrass grows from 15 to 20 feet to maturity in 12 to<br>
18 months depending on weather and soil conditions. The stems are harvested by cutting<br>
with a blade just above the ground line and the top section, containing leaves and small<br>
stems, is removed by a blade cutter in the field. The resulting stems, which are essentially<br>
hollow, range from about ½ inch to ¼ inches diameter with wail thickness ranging from<br>
just over 1/16 inch to roughly ¼ inch. The concept is based on sawing the stems into<br>
"rings" of ¾ to 1 inch length then, "chopping" the rings into three to five pieces. Simple<br>
calculations show that the resulting pieces would meet the optimum size specifications for<br>
commercial pulping and composite panel processes.<br>
FIGURE 2 is a plane view and FIGURE 3 an elevation of a saw blade bed 5½ feet<br>
wide with saw blades mounted on a shaft and spaced 1 inch apart. This width was<br>
selected for illustration purposes because automatic saws used in composite panel and<br>
wood products plants range from 4 to 8 feet in width to cut panels into sections for<br>
various products. However, it would be possible to have a much more narrow or wide<br>
saw bed depending on economic factors of construction cost and capacity requirements.<br>
FIGURE 4 is a detail section of the blade and finger arrangement. This illustration shows<br>
a circular saw configuration however, a band saw principle can be employed.<br>
Blade spacing of 1 inch is also used for illustration since spacing of ¾ to<br>
1½ inches more or less is possible depending on the desired application. Nalgrass stems<br>
are pre-cut to approximately 4 to 5 feet lengths and aligned and fed into the hopper which<br>
is mounted above the apron that feeds the saw blade arrangement. Fingers mounted on a<br>
chain, belt; or other carrier mechanism are driven through a slot in the belt that feeds into<br>
the saw blades. These fingers pull the nalgrass stems that feed by gravity or by a positive<br>
teed mechanism, (the stems are not completely straight and a positive feed to clear the<br>
hopper discharge into the fingers can be used) from the hopper onto the apion into and<br>
through the saw blades resulting in rings of nalgrass discharging to a chute that then<br>
flows into the chopping mechanism. The width of the fingers for a 1 inch saw blade can<br>
be ½ to ¾ inch in order to supply the positive force to gently pull the stems through the<br>
blades.<br>
The "chopper" may be one of several possible designs. The representative design<br>
shown is of a type with blades mounted on a shaft that can rotate at a single or variable<br>
speed. As rings fail into the housing around the blades, they are chopped by the action of<br>
the blade impinging on or near the wall. An alternate design uses hammers instead of<br>
blades or even a drum with blades and an annular space whereby chunks are pulled from<br>
the nalgrass rings. The optimal design produces the fewest small slivers or shards.<br>
After the chopper, a screen removes the oversize (intact or nearly intact rings) for<br>
return to the chopper and the undersize slivers and shards are removed by screening. The<br>
main stream is conveyed to a holding bin to be loaded into trucks or railcars.<br>
Variations of this basic process are possible. The saw blades may be oscillating if<br>
a more positive cutting action is needed. The saw blades may have many or very few or<br>
no teeth. Another design, as noted earlier, may use a band saw principle rather than a<br>
circular one. The bands would have an up and down motion as the stems are pulled<br>
through. Nonetheless, the method involving cutting rings to optimum length then<br>
reducing the rings to desired particles is the same in all versions.<br>
A key to many of the design features is the capacity of the system. For general<br>
efficiency and adequate customer service to large processing plants, a system in the field<br>
would need to produce a minimum of 10 tons/hour up to 30 or more tons/hour and<br>
operate effectively 16 hours/day and 6 or 7 days per week, 50 to 52 weeks per year.<br>
Tons in this reference are short tons, 2000 lbs., and as "green" tons. In the industry,<br>
tonnage frequently means "bone dry tons". Based on the bulk density of the stems, some<br>
rough estimated calculations and sketches show that each if each finger "pulled" a small<br>
bundle about 10 inches in diameter, roughly 6 to 7 pounds, the fingers would need to<br>
pass the blades (about 30 inches in diameter) at a rate of just over one per second to<br>
process 10 to 12 tons per hour. Relating that speed to similar types of processes<br>
conceptually seems that a speed of 2 to 3 seconds would be needed to accomplish the<br>
sawing of a bundle that size. Band saw blades of 30 to 40 inch length could possibly saw<br>
bundles up to 15 inches in diameter and that design could process 10 to 12 tons per hour.<br>
Larger bundles being pulled through may begin to crush the stems before they can be cut<br>
into the desired ring shape.<br>
Example 2<br>
The Formation of Representative Nalgrass Particle Boards<br>
The protocol for manufacturing particle board of nalgrass, and of comparison<br>
materials, is described in this example.<br>
Preparing the Furnish (Particles). Arundo donax stalks were chipped into pieces<br>
of approximately 2 to 3 in. long x 1/4 to 3/8 in. wide x 0.03 in. thick in a Pallmann Drum<br>
Flaker, dried to 8% moisture, and then processed in a Prater Blue Streak hammermill<br>
with a 1/8 in. screen. Material from the mill was screened resulting in 32% through the<br>
screen to be used for face material and 68% on the screen to be used for core material.<br>
For wood (southern pine) composite preparation, commercially obtained face and<br>
core material was used. The commercial face material was coarser than that used for<br>
nalgrass and wheatstraw so a portion of the wood face material was screened, using the<br>
same mesh screen as used for nalgrass.<br>
For wheatstraw, the straw was processed through the Prater Blue Streak<br>
hammermill with a 1/8 in. screen. Material from the mill was screened in the same<br>
manner as nalgrass with 24% through the screen to be used for face material and 76% on<br>
the screen to be used for core material.<br>
All prepared test materials were processed as follows. Each test had three<br>
replications at low (2%), medium (4%), and high (6%) resin content; and low and high<br>
density. A total of 18 test panels was used for each material. See Table 1.<br>
Resin/Binder addition. Core material and face material portions were weighed<br>
out and individually put into a laboratory blender designed to duplicate production<br>
conditions. For each portion, the methyl diisocyanate resin, generally referred to as MDI,<br>
was weighed to achieve the target percentage and put into a reservoir that feeds into<br>
nozzled spray apparatus. The nozzles were positioned in the blending chamber and<br>
sprayed for 60 to 180 seconds while the blender was operating. The blender was stopped<br>
and the resin-coated material removed. In all tests, resin content of the face and core<br>
materials was the same.<br>
Mat Forming. Two small portions of face material and one of core material were<br>
weighed out for each mat to be pressed into a 3-layer test panel. A Teflon® sheet, to<br>
ease test panel release after pressing, was placed on a steel sheet, and a rectangular<br>
wooden frame placed on the Teflon® sheet. The frame measured 16 in. x 20 in., (the<br>
target size of the finished test panel) and was 6 in. high. Face material was distributed<br>
uniformly inside the frame to form the lower face, then the core material was distributed<br>
uniformly over the face layer. Finally, the remaining portion of face material was<br>
distributed uniformly as a top layer. The mat formed by the layers was tamped down, the<br>
frame removed, and a Teflon® release sheet placed on top of the mat.<br>
Panel Forming. The mat was placed on the lower platen of a Siempelkamp pilot<br>
model press. The platen dimensions of the press were 23 in. x 31 in. and it was driven by<br>
a 200 ton servohydraulic system. A three-stage press schedule was preset on a computer<br>
to compress to 0.75 in. in 60 seconds, to remain at that thickness for an additional<br>
400 seconds, and then to vent for 20 seconds for a total press time of 480 seconds<br>
Platen temperature was 330°F. At the end of the press time, the top platen withdrew to<br>
its starting distance and the panel was removed and allowed to cool at ambient<br>
conditions.<br>
Composite panels were manufactured from nalgrass, wheatstraw, and southern<br>
pine. From each panel two specimens were cut and tested in static bending of modulus of<br>
rupture, and modulus of elasticity; four for internal bond strength; and one for screw<br>
withdrawal. One specimen from six of the 18 panels of each furnish was used to measure<br>
water absorption and thickness swell.<br>
Mechanical tests were conducted on ambient-conditioned specimens using a<br>
screw-driven universal test machine according to ASTM D1037, with a few exceptions<br>
noted below.<br>
Static bending specimens were roughly 2 in. x 19 in. x 3/4 in. instead of<br>
3 in. x 20 in. x 3/4 in. as specified for specimens with thickness greater than 1/4 in. The<br>
test speed was 0.36 inVmin. and the span was 18 in.<br>
Internal bond strength specimens were 2 in. x 2 in. x 3/4 in. and tested at a speed<br>
of 0.06 in/min. Centerline and surface breaks were recorded for each internal bond test.<br>
Screw withdrawal specimens were 3 in. x 6 in. x 3/4 in. instead of 3 in. x 6 in.<br>
x 1 in. as specified for face screw withdrawal and 2 1/2 in. x 4 1/2 in. x 3/4 in. for edge<br>
screw withdrawal. The test speed was 0.06 in./min. Two edge and two face screw pull<br>
tests were conducted on the same specimen.<br>
Water absorption and thickness swell were measured on 6 in. x 6 in. specimens<br>
after they soaked in distilled water for 2 and 24 hours. Thickness was measured at four<br>
locations and averaged for each specimen. Water absorption and thickness swell were<br>
determined as a percentage of the unsoaked weight and averaged thickness for each<br>
specimen.<br>
All mechanical and physical properties were averaged over the three specimens<br>
for each type of panel. The mean values in the graphs in Table 1 (below) represent the<br>
averages for the respective panel type.<br>
All tests were conducted according to "Standard Methods of Evaluating the<br>
Properties of Wood-Base Fiber and Particle Panel Materials," ASTM D1037. All panels<br>
were first cut into 14 inch x 19 inch sections. Specimens were cut from these for testing.<br>
Static Bending—Modulus of Rupture (MOR) and Modulus of Elasticity (MOE).<br>
Two specimens of 2 in. x 19 in. were cut from each panel providing a total of six<br>
specimens for each combination of density and resin level. Specimens were placed on a<br>
United Model No. SFM-10 screw-driven test machine set for a span of 18 in. A<br>
computer assisted program set the test speed at 0.36 in./min. and recorded the elasticity<br>
and rupture curves. The six results for each combination were averaged and recorded in<br>
Table 1.<br>
Tensile Strength Perpendicular to Surface—Internal Bond (IB). Four<br>
2 in. x 2 in. specimens were cut from each test panel. Metal loading blocks were<br>
cemented to both faces of the specimen and allowed to cure completely. The blocks<br>
were engaged on a Model SFM-10, and tested at a speed of 0.06 in./min. Internal bond<br>
breaks were automatically recorded. Test results were averaged for the specimens for<br>
each density and resin combination, and recorded in Table 1.<br>
Direct Screw Withdrawal; Perpendicular and Edge One specimen of each test<br>
panel was prepared with two face and two edge pulls per specimen. Face withdrawal<br>
specimens were 3 in. x 6 in. x 3/4 in. for face pulls and 2 1/2 in. x 4 1/2 in. x 3/4 in. for<br>
edge pulls (ASTMD1037 recommends 3 in. x 6 in. x 1 in.). Standard pilot holes were<br>
drilled and standard screws inserted. Specimens were anchored to a platen, screw heads<br>
gripped with a loading fixture, then withdrawn by separating the platens at the standard<br>
rate of 0.6 in./min. Force required to withdraw the screws was recorded. Test results for<br>
specimens with the same combination of density and resin level were averaged, and<br>
recorded in Table 1.<br>
Water Absorption and Thickness Swelling. One specimen of 6 in x 6 in. of each<br>
combination was immersed in distilled water at ambient temperature for 2 and 24 hours.<br>
Thickness was measured at four locations on the specimen using a thickness gauge, and<br>
averaged. Weights at each period were recorded. Water absorption and thickness swell<br>
were calculated as percent gains over the unsoaked weights, and recorded in Table 1.<br>
The results show that at a 2 weight percent resin level and low density trial, the<br>
nalgrass composite exceeds the maximum for the highest industry grade standard for<br>
medium density particleboard (ANSI; M-3) whereas neither the wood composite nor the<br>
wheatstraw composite meets even the minimum grade standard (ANSI; M-l). See<br>
Tables 1 and 2. The 2 weight percent nalgrass composite shows significantly less water<br>
absorption and thickness swell than the wood-based composites. Moreover, the internal<br>
bond strength of nalgrass is significantly higher than that of the wheatstraw composite<br>
which fails to meet minimum standards. These superior physical properties are also<br>
apparent at the 4 and 6 weight percent resin levels.<br>
With regard to the screw pull test, the nalgrass composites perform at least as<br>
well as the wood-based composites, and exceeds significantly the performance of<br>
wheatstraw composites. The modulus of elasticity (MOE) of nalgrass exceeds that of<br>
wheatstraw and wood-based composites, for almost every level of resin addition, except<br>
at the 6 weight percent level. At this level of resin addition, wheatstraw composite<br>
appears to have a slightly higher modulus of elasticity.<br>
With regard to modulus of rupture (MOR), nalgrass composite again exhibits<br>
superior performance as compared to wood-based composite. The wood composite fails<br>
to make the minimum (M-l) industry grade standard. When compared to wheatstraw<br>
composite, nalgrass composite is superior when the resin level is low, such as 2 weight<br>
percent. As the resin level increases, wheatstraw composite MOR exceeds that of the<br>
nalgrass composites. This demonstrates one of the advantages of nalgrass composite,<br>
namely, that good physical properties are achievable at low resin levels.<br>
Example 3<br>
The Formation of Representative Nalgrass/Southern Pine Particleboards<br>
In this example, the formation of particle boards containing nalgrass/southern pine<br>
blends is described. The mechanical and physical properties of the particle boards<br>
compared to particle boards formed from (1) nalgrass and (2) southern pine.<br>
Tests were conducted to compare the mechanical and physical properties of<br>
nalgrass, southern pine, and nalgrass/southern pine particleboard. For each furnish type,<br>
panels were manufactured with target densities of 42 lb/ft3 and 47 lb/ft3 and resin levels<br>
of 2% and 4%. All specimens were tested in static bending, internal bond strength, face<br>
and edge screwholding, water sorption, and thickness swell. Mechanical properties were<br>
compared with product specifications for medium density particleboard (ANSI<br>
A208.1-1993). See Table 2.<br>
Table 2. Grade Specifications of Medium Density Particleboard<br>
(National Partideboard Association ANSI A208.1-1993)<br>
Grade	MOR (psi)	MOE (ksi)	IB (psi)	FSP (lb)	ESP (lb)<br>
M-1	1595	250	58	NS	NS<br>
M-S	1813	276	58	202	180<br>
M-2	2103	326	65	225	202<br>
M-3	2393	399	80	247	225<br>
An electrically heated, computer automated hot-press was used to manufacture all<br>
panels. The press was equipped with nominal 23 x 31 inch platens, which were driven by<br>
a 200 ton servo-hydraulic system. The press was controlled using platen position with a<br>
three-stage press schedule that included: (1) press closing for 60 seconds; (2) panel<br>
pressing for 400 seconds; and (3) venting for 20 seconds. The platen temperature was<br>
330°F. All panels were formed to dimensions of 16x20x¾ inch, but trimmed to<br>
14 x 19 x ¾ inch.<br>
Panels were manufactured from nalgrass, southern pine, and nalgrass/southern<br>
pine at target densities of 42 lb/ft3 and 47 lb/ft3 and diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI)<br>
resin levels of 2% and 4%. Twelve panels of each furnish were manufactured at the<br>
different combinations of density and resin loading (i.e., three panel replicates per<br>
combination). From each panel two specimens were cut and tested in static bending for<br>
modulus of rupture and elasticity, four for internal bond strength, and one for water<br>
sorption/thickness swell. One specimen from four of the twelve panels of each furnish<br>
was used to measure face and edge screw holding capacity. Each specimen had a<br>
different density and resin level.<br>
Mechanical tests were conducted on ambient-conditioned specimens using a<br>
screw driven universal test machine in general accordance to ASTMD 1037. Static<br>
bending specimens were nominally 2 x 19 x ¾ inch (ASTM specifies dimensions of<br>
3 x 20 x ¾ inch for specimens with thickness greater than ¼ inch). The test speed was<br>
0.36 in/min and the span was 18 inches. Internal bond strength specimens were 2 x 2 x ¾<br>
inch and the test speed was 0.06 in/min. Screwholding specimens were 3 x 6 x ¾ inch for<br>
face screwholding (ASTM specifies dimensions of 3 x 6 x 1 inch) and 2½ x 4½x¾ for<br>
edge screwholding. The test speed was 0.06 in/min. The two edge and two face<br>
screwholding tests were conducted on the same specimen. Water sorption and thickness<br>
swell were measured on 6 x 6 inch specimens after they soaked in distilled water for<br>
24 hours. Thickness was measured at five locations, and averaged for each specimen.<br>
A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on all mechanical and<br>
physical properties using density, resin level, and furnish as the three factors.<br>
In general, for each density and resin level combination, the modulus of rupture<br>
(MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) significantly increased as the proportion of<br>
nalgrass particles within them increased (Table 3). In contrast, the internal bond<br>
strength (IB) of panels consisting predominantly of nalgrass particles were significantly<br>
lower than similar panels made predominantly of southern pine particles. For face (FSP)<br>
and edge (ESP) screwholding, there were few significant differences between any of the<br>
panels. For the most part, all panels exceeded the highest grade specifications as<br>
stipulated by ANSI A208.1-1993 (Table 2).<br>

For all furnishes, mechanical properties generally increased as density level<br>
increased from 42 lb/ft3 to 47 lb/ft3 and as resin level increased from 2% to 4%.<br>
The three-way ANOVA indicated that resin level, density, and furnish statistically<br>
influenced all mechanical properties. The effect of panel density in relation to material IB<br>
strength was dependent on resin loading, while the effect of resin loading in relation to<br>
material MOE was dependent on furnish type.<br>
After soaking in distilled water for 24 hours the water sorption and thickness<br>
swell of the panels containing a higher proportion of nalgrass particles were in general<br>
lower than panels incorporating a higher proportion of southern pine particles (Table 4).<br>

Water sorption and thickness swell after 24 hours generally decreased as density<br>
level increased from 42 lb/ft3 to 47 lb/ft3 and as resin level increased from 2% to 4%.<br>
The three-way ANOVA indicated that the effect of panel density in relation to thickness<br>
swell was dependent on furnish type, while the effect of resin loading in relation to both<br>
thickness swell and water sorption was dependent on furnish type.<br>
Generally, the use of nalgrass particles would be best to obtain panels of superior<br>
strength and stifiness. The addition of southern pine particles to a furnish, by an amount<br>
as low as 20%, although slightly affecting panel strength and stiffness, significantly<br>
increases internal bond strength.<br>
As panel density and resin loading increased mechanical properties increased. In a<br>
commercial market, however, panels of the lower density and lower resin loading would<br>
be economically preferable while still attaining wide grade acceptance.<br>
Panels made predominantly from nalgrass particles exhibited preferable water<br>
sorption and thickness swell characteristics to panels made predominantly from southern<br>
pine particles. Water sorption and thickness swell, after 24 hours water submersion,<br>
were generally reduced by an increase in panel density and resin loading.<br>
Example 4<br>
Utilization of Arundo Donax in Paper Production:<br>
Kraft and Alkaline Peroxide Mechanical Pulping<br>
In this example, the utilization of Arundo donax (nalgrass) in the production of<br>
paper is described. The pulping behavior and pulp properties of nalgrass is also<br>
described. Data from kraft pulping, soda pulping, and alkaline peroxide mechanical<br>
pulping of nalgrass is presented.<br>
The tests were to be performed on laboratory and small pilot plant scale. The<br>
Pulp and Paper Science Department of the University of Washington was selected for<br>
kraft and soda pulping tests and the Department of Wood and Paper Science at North<br>
Carolina State University for the alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping tests. All testing<br>
of handsheet paper samples was made by the Pulp and Paper Science Department of the<br>
University of Washington.<br>
Kraft pulping was found to proceed rapidly and resulted in relatively high yields<br>
of easily bleached pulp. Average fiber length was high compared to other nonwood<br>
materials and, in fact, slightly higher than that from aspen hardwood. Strength properties<br>
were better than aspen hardwood kraft in tear and tensile.<br>
Raw Material. Material for the present study was cut fresh from growths in<br>
Orange County, California and shipped without drying to the University of Washington.<br>
The nalgrass stem has a dense ring of tissue surrounding a hollow core. Stem<br>
diameters are typically ¾ to 1¾ inches in diameter. It can be cut or milled into lengths<br>
similar to wood chips and once crushed to break the circular cross section has bulk<br>
density similar to that of wood chips (Table 5).<br>
Table 5. Bulk Density<br>
	Nalgrass	Wheatstraw	N.W. Softwood<br>
Uncompacted, green			<br>
BD lb/ft3	10.8	2-6	12-14<br>
Compacted, green			<br>
BD lb/ft3	12.5	3-7	12-15<br>
In earlier tests, nalgrass chips were used. Material for the present trials was cut<br>
into precise lengths using a band saw then crushed. For the kraft pulping trials tests were<br>
made at four different cut lengths, 1/2, 3/4, 7/8 and 1 1/4 inches.<br>
The character of chipped material is important to processing into conventional<br>
pulping equipment. The bulk density of the chipped material is important in terms of<br>
packing into digesters and sizing of conveyors and other process equipment. The high<br>
bulk density of chipped nalgrass will allow it to be processed in conventional, existing<br>
chip handling and pulping equipment. Cooking liquor to raw material ratios can be low,<br>
similar to those used for wood chips resulting in high waste liquor concentrations.<br>
The other important chip characteristics is the ability of the cooking chemicals to<br>
penetrate into the center of the chip during pulping. Earlier tests were done with<br>
hammermill prepared chips and were screened to remove fines and oversized material. It<br>
was noted that there were some long pieces (2 inch) that might hinder material flow if<br>
they were not removed early in the processing sequence. The material gave pulp with<br>
low uncooked rejects, indicating that the penetration of cooking liquor was quite<br>
uniform.<br>
A sample of dried material was also included. This was cut to 7/8 inch length and<br>
was included to evaluate whether liquor penetration was hindered by drying as is the case<br>
with wood chips.<br>
Kraft Pulping and Beaching<br>
Kraft Pulping. Kraft cooking of the nalgrass material was made at the University<br>
of Washington using a pilot digester system. Cooks were made with each of the chip<br>
samples under conditions aimed at producing delignification to the 20 kappa level suitable<br>
for bleaching. Pulping conditions are given in Table 6.<br>

Rejects (%)	1.1	0.9	3.6	3.2	0.2	3.3<br>
All samples cooked with similar results. The cooking time is short as indicated by<br>
the low H Factor (a chemical reaction value combining temperature and reaction time).<br>
Cooking times would be up to half those of softwoods. The high bulk density of the<br>
nalgrass chips also allowed use of a low liquid to chip ratio similar to that used for wood<br>
chips. This indicates that nalgrass pulping could be made in the same equipment as wood<br>
chips and with the same heat economy. Typical low density straw and other nonwood<br>
plant material require high liquor to wood ratios although cooking is rapid as found with<br>
this nalgrass material.<br>
The four various lengths of chips show only small, probably insignificant,<br>
differences in pulping response. Although the ¾ inch chip had slightly lower kappa, 14.0<br>
vs. 17.6-18.2 for the longer chips, the ½ inch chip gave 17.4 kappa. The uncooked<br>
rejects were lower in the short cut chips, 0.9-1.1%, compared to the longer chips, 3.2-<br>
3.6%, but these levels are low, indicating that uniform penetration of cooking liquors into<br>
the material occurred and also showing that the nodes cooked well. The nodes of<br>
grasses, of which nalgrass is a member, are sometimes resistant to pulping.<br>
The veneer cut chips cooked similarly to the saw cut chips, giving low kappa,<br>
14.6, and low rejects, 0.2%. This type of chip preparation would be satisfactory for<br>
commercial operations.<br>
The dried material showed pulping response similar to the fresh material,<br>
kappa 14.9, rejects 3.3%, indicating that there are no problems with the penetration of<br>
liquor into dry nalgrass chips. This means that chips could be used from fresh or dry<br>
material without significant changes in process conditions.<br>
The pulping of the 7/8 inch cut nalgrass is compared to typical hardwood and<br>
softwood kraft pulping in Table 7. The nalgrass cooks more rapidly than both types of<br>
wood, requires less chemical and produces only slightly higher rejects (a not significant<br>
difference).<br>

Bleaching. Most published work on the bleaching of nonwood material is made<br>
using the now outdated Chlorine (C), Extraction (E), Hypochlorite (H) bleach sequence.<br>
Worldwide this sequence is typically used but it is not now acceptable environmentally in<br>
the U.S. to meet present environmental standards bleaching of kraft pulp has to be with<br>
an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) method. Bleaching tests were made on pulp from a<br>
larger scale cook on the 7/8 inch cut material using an ECF bleach consisting of Chlorine<br>
dioxide (Do). Extraction with oxygen and peroxide (Eop). Chlorine dioxide (D1). The<br>
results are shown in Table 8.<br>

Initially, a chlorine dioxide charge in the first stage of 0.20 kappa factor<br>
(percentage equivalent chlorine/kappa number) was applied, followed by 1.5% chlorine<br>
dioxide in the third stage. This resulted in a brightness of 83.8%. Modification to a<br>
0.25 kappa factor application in the first stage resulted in brightness of 85.6 and 86.4<br>
with 1.25% and 1.5% chlorine dioxide in the third stage, respectively.<br>
A total chlorine dioxide charge of 3.18% was required for the 86.4. In earlier<br>
tests, a brightness of 90.0 was reached in a five stage bleach using 4.34% chlorine<br>
dioxide. Softwood kraft pulps typically require 5.8 to 6.2% chlorine dioxide to reach a<br>
brightness level of 90.0%.<br>
Handsheet Properties. Standard testing of pulp properties was made using<br>
TAPPI procedures. Pulp from the 7/8 inch chip sample was beaten in a PFI mill to<br>
various freeness levels. The PFI mill is a standard laboratory pulp beating apparatus used<br>
to simulate refining in commercial papermaking operations. Typically the initial pulp<br>
freeness of 600 to 750 ml CSF is reduced to about 400 to 500 ml before papermaking to<br>
develop strength properties, tensile strength is increased with some small loss of tear<br>
strength.<br>
Handsheets were made from 7/8 inch of cut nalgrass pulp beaten to several<br>
freeness levels and tested for strength properties, (Table 9). Pulps from the other chip<br>
cut lengths were beaten to the 400 ml CSF level for comparison.<br>

	3.2	393	5.25	9.04	81.21<br>
The initial pulp freeness before beating was 700 ml CSF which is a very high and<br>
desirable level compared with typical nonwood material. In earlier tests a similar high<br>
initial freeness of 630 ml CSF was found. These compare to &gt;700 ml for softwood pulps<br>
and 600-650 for hardwood pulps and are favorably high, allowing the papermaker to<br>
modify the pulp properties without restriction and to allow high drainage in the<br>
papermaking operation.<br>
The handsheet strength measurement, burst, tensile and tear, are all at favorable<br>
levels and higher than those obtained in earlier tests. Comparison of the two sets of<br>
results from nalgrass and from typical wheatstraw, kenaf, hardwood and softwood are<br>
shown in Table 10. The nalgrass has remarkably high strength in all categories. The<br>
sheet bulk is high compared to other nonwoods which indicates the material has<br>
significantly different characteristics than the straws.<br>

the group consisting of unbleached liner and corrugation boards.<br>
29. A method for forming an Arundo donax paper product, comprising:<br>
(a) subjecting a furnish of Arundo donax particles to a pulping process comprising<br>
cooking the furnish using an H-factor of about 850.<br>
(b) depositing the furnish onto a foraminous support;<br>
(c) dewatering the deposited furnish to provide a fibrous web; and<br>
(d) drying the web to provide a paper product. "<br>
30. The method as claimed in claim 29, wherein the Arundo donax furnish contains<br>
wood fibers.<br>
31. An Arundo donax composite panel, the composite comprising:<br>
(a) a binder resin; and<br>
(b) Arundo donax particles bonded into a contiguous material with resin;<br>
wherein the composite meets at least the M-3 standard for composite panels.<br>
32. The panel as claimed in claim 31, which comprises from about 1 to about 10<br>
percent by weight of a resin binder based on the total weight of the panel.<br>
33. The panel as claimed in claim 31, which comprises from 1.5 to 3.0 percent by<br>
weight of a resin binder based on the total weight of the panel.<br>
34. The panel as claimed in claim 31, wherein the binder is selected from the group<br>
consisting of methyl diisocyanate, urea-formaldehyde, phenolic, and inorganic binders.<br>
35. The panel as claimed in claim 31, wherein the Arundo donax furnish contains<br>
wood fibers.<br>
36. The panel as claimed in claim 35, having from about 10% to about 90% by weight<br>
Arundo donax based on the total weight of the panel.<br>
37. The panel as claimed in claim 35, wherein the bending strength of the panel is<br>
caused to be increased proportionally relative to the amount of Arundo donax in the panel<br>
compared to a wood-based panel.<br>
38. The panel as claimed in claim 35, wherein the moisture resistance of the panel is<br>
caused to be increased proportionally relative to the amount of Arundo donax in the panel<br>
compared to a wood-based panel.<br>
39. The panel as claimed in claim 35, the bending strength whereof is at least about<br>
55% greater than a similarly constituted wood-based panel.<br>
40. The panel as claimed in claim 35, wherein the moisture resistance of the panel is<br>
about 2.6 times greater than a similarly constituted wood-based panel.<br>
41. The panel as claimed in claim 35, wherein the bending strength of the panel is<br>
about 5% greater than a similarly constituted wheatstraw-based panel.<br>
42. The panel as claimed in claim 35, wherein the moisture resistance of the panel is<br>
15% greater than a similarly constituted wheatstraw-based panel.<br>
43. A method of manufacturing an Arundo donax composite panel, the method<br>
comprising:<br>
(a) comminuting Arundo donax into particles of a size distribution suitable for<br>
use as furnish in a composite panel;<br>
(b) mixing the particles with a binder to provide a binder-particle mixture; and<br>
(c) consolidating the binder-particle mixture into a composite panel.<br>
44. The method as claimed in claim 43, wherein the particle-binder mixture contains<br>
wood particles.<br>
Composite panels and pulp, and paper products of the pulp, are<br>
produced from Arundo donax. In the fabrication of the composite<br>
panels, Arundo donax is comminuted (20) to a suitable size, combined<br>
with a binder (40, 50), and consolidated (80) into panels that meet<br>
standards for construction and/or furniture grade panels. The Arundo<br>
donax particulates may be combined with wood particulates to produce<br>
a mixed furnish that can be used in the preparation of composite<br>
panels. Comminuted Arundo donax is treated, in conventional pulping<br>
processes, to produce a high tensile strength pulp that can be used in the<br>
production of paper. The pulp has a lighter color than wood pulp, and<br>
thereby uses less bleaching chemicals to achieve a desired whiteness.<br>
The pulp can be combined with wood pulp to produce a variety of<br>
products.</td>
