Brief Description of the Figure<br>
Figure 1. Shows pharmacokinetics and distribution of compound No. 1 identified below<br>
in serum, faeces and urine. Average values are presented for free and total concentrations<br>
of the compound (Â±SEM) as a semi-log plot in part A and as a standard linear plot in part<br>
B.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present inventors have found that compounds of the general formula (I) show<br>
surprising and unexpected biological and pharmaceutical properties.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) of the invention are believed to have favourable toxicity<br>
profiles with normal cells and good bioavailability. Surprisingly the compounds of the<br>
invention exhibit anti-cancer activity, significantly better than or at least comparable to<br>
known cancer treatments.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) are cytostatic and cytotoxic against a broad range of cancer<br>
cells of human and animal origin. By cancer cells, it is meant cells that display malignant<br>
characteristics and which are distinguished from non-cancer cells by unregulated growth<br>
and behaviour which usually ultimately is life-threatening unless successfully treated.<br>
The cancer cells that have been found to be responsive to compounds of formula (I) are of<br>
epithelial origin (for example, prostate, ovarian, cervical, breast, gall-bladder, pancreatic,<br>
colorectal, renal, and non-small lung cancer cells), of mesenchymal origin (for example,<br>
melanoma, mesothelioma and sarcoma cancer cells), and of neural origin (for example<br>
glioma cancer cells).<br>
It is highly unusual and surprising to find a related group of compounds that display such<br>
potent cytotoxicity against cancer cells. Furthermore it is thought that the compounds<br>
according to the invention also have low toxicity against non-cancer cells such as<br>
keratinocytes derived from human foreskin. Such cancer cell selectivity is highly unusual<br>
and unexpected.<br>
Advantageously the compounds of formula (I) show cytotoxicity against cancer cells that<br>
are well recognised for being poorly sensitive to standard anti-cancer drugs. It is highly<br>
unusual and unexpected to find such potent activity against cancers, for example,<br>
cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and melanoma, that are highly resistant to<br>
known anti-cancer drugs.<br>
Advantageously the compounds of formula (I) also seem to display an ability to radio-<br>
sensitise cancer cells, by which it is meant that these compounds either lower the amount<br>
of gamma-irradiation that is required to kill the cells, or they convert cancer cells from a<br>
state of radio-resistance to radio-sensitivity.<br>
Additionally the compounds of formula (I) are thought to possess chemo-sensitising<br>
activity, that is they increase the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents, especially to<br>
cancer cells, and/or convert cancerous cells from a state of chemo-resistance to a chemo-<br>
sensitive state.<br><br>
Compounds of the invention may also provide chemo and/or radio-protective properties for<br>
non-cancerous ceils. This has significant therapeutic implications because the traumatic<br>
side-effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy are caused by the toxicity of the traditional<br>
treatments to non-cancerous cells.<br>
The properties described above offer significant clinical advantages.<br>
The radio and/or chemo-protective properties of the compounds of the invention may be<br>
employed to protect healthly individuals from the effects of radiation and/or chemical<br>
toxins, or lessen the effects of the same.<br>
The properties described above offer significant clinical advantages.<br>
The invention also provides the use of compounds of formula (I) to treat patients with<br>
cancer by either reducing the rate of growth of such tumours or by reducing the size of<br>
such tumours through therapy with such compounds alone, and/or in combination with<br>
each other, and/or in combination with other anti-cancer agents, and/or in combination<br>
with radiotherapy.<br>

phosphate, sulfate, sulfonate, and preferably are mono-, di- and per-acyl oxy-substituted<br>
compounds, where one or more of the pendant hydroxy groups are protected by an acyl<br>
group, preferably an acetyl group. Typically acyloxy substituted compounds of the<br>
invention are readily cleavable to the corresponding hydroxy substituted compounds.<br><br>
Chemical functional group protection, deprotection, synthons and other techniques known<br>
to those skilled in the art may be used where appropriate to aid in the synthesis of the<br>
compounds of the present invention, and their starting materials.<br>
The protection of functional groups on the compounds and derivatives of the present<br>
invention can be carried out by well established methods in the art, for example as<br>

reduction, for example, hydrogenation. Silyl ethers may require hydrogen fluoride or<br>
tetrabutylammonium fluoride to be cleaved.<br>
It will be clear to persons skilled in the art of medicinal chemistry that compounds of<br>
formula (I) may be converted into other compounds of formula (I), for example, where a<br>
compound of formula (I) bears one or more hydroxyl substituents then one or more of<br>
these substituents can be converted in to a halogen such as bromo, chloro or iodo by<br>
treating the alcohol with a halogenating agent, with use of protecting groups as required to<br>
protect other functionality in the molecule. Halogenating agents include compounds like<br>
NBS, hydrobromic acid and chlorine gas.<br>
Phenolic type hydroxyls may not be readily convertible to the corresponding halogen<br>
compound by treatment with a halogenating agent. However, the desired halogen<br>
compound may be prepared by, for example, treating an appropriate aryl amine starting<br>
material with NaNO2 in the presence of HC1 under reduced temperature conditions such as<br><br>
0Â°C, to form the corresponding azide salt. Subsequent treatment with CuCl, CuBr, KI or<br>
HBF4 may be used to convert the azide into the required halo-compound.<br>
A general process for preparing compounds of formula (I) comprises the steps of:<br>
i)	treating a compound of formula (II):<br><br>
or a protected derivative thereof wherein:<br>
R1, is hydrogen, hydroxy, NR10R11, C3-6 cycloalkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, C2-6 alkenyl, C1-6<br>
fluoroalkyl, C1-6 alkyl optionally substituted by one or more hydroxy or NR10R11<br>
groups;<br>
R6, R7, R8 and R9 independently represent hydrogen, hydroxy, NR10R11 C3-6<br>
cycloalkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, C1-6 fluoroalkyl, COOR12, COR13 or C1-6 alkyl optionally<br>
substituted by one or more hydroxy or NR10R11 groups with a of formula (III):<br><br>
or a protected derivative thereof wherein:<br>
R3 represents represents hydrogen, hydroxy, NR10R11 C3-6 cycloalkyl, C1-6 alkoxy,<br>
C1-6 fluoroalkyl, C2-6 alkenyl, COOR12, COR13, (O)nC1-4 alkyleneNR14R15, or<br>
C1-6 alkyl optionally substituted by one or more hydroxy or NR10R11 groups;<br>
R4 and R5 independently represent hydrogen, hydroxy, NR10R11, C3-6 cycloalkyl, C1-<br>
6 alkoxy, C1-6 fluoroalkyl, C2-6 alkenyl, COOR12, COR13 or C1-6 alkyl optionally<br><br>
substituted by one or more hydroxy or NR10R11 groups; and<br>
X represents a metallohalo moiety; and<br>
ii) optionally followed by converting the tertiary alcohol group on the heterocyclic<br>
ring in the product formed to another substituent, and<br>
iii) optionally followed by deprotection.<br>
In step i) described above the compound of formula (III) is preferably an organo metallic<br>
reagent which is reacted with the ketone compound of formula (II) under anhydrous<br>
conditions in an inert atmosphere such as under nitrogen or argon, in an inert solvent such<br>
as THF (tetrahydrofuran), at a non-extreme temperature such as room temperature, or<br>
reduced temperature, for example, 0Â°C.<br>
Suitable organometallic reagents include organolithium reagents, organomagnesium<br>
reagents and organocopper reagents. More preferably the arylating agent employed is an<br>
organomagnesium reagent such as a Gringnard reagent, which may be prepared by reacting<br>
a compound of formula (III), wherein X represents halo such as bromo with magnesium<br>
metal under anhydrous conditions in an inert atmosphere.<br>
In step ii) described above the tertiary alcohol substituent on the heterocyclic ring in the<br>
product formed from the nucleophilic addition reaction may be converted into other R2<br>
substituents by known methods. For example, treatment with para-toluenesulfonic acid<br>
can be used to convert the tertiary alcohol into a good leaving group. This intermediate<br>
tosylate may then be treated with a nucleophile such as a hydride source, an alcohol or an<br>
amine to provide the required substitution for the R2 moiety.<br>
Alternatively the tertiary hydroxyl may be converted to a halogen by use of a halogenating<br>
agent.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is the dehydration of the product of said<br>
nucleophilic addition reaction to form a compound of the general formula (I-d):<br><br><br>
or a protected derivative thereof wherein R1, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8 and R9 are as defined<br>
above for compounds of formula (I-b).<br>
Dehydration can, for example, be catalysed by acid, by base or facilitated by conversion of<br>
the tertiary alcohol into a better leaving group. Preferably compounds of formula (III) are<br>
dehydrated, for example, by treatment with para-toluene sulphonic acid.<br>
Preference expressed above for compounds of formula (I-b) apply equally to compound of<br>
formula (I-d).<br>
Specific compounds of formula (I-d) are shown below:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
If required the double bond in the heterocycle in compounds of formula (I-d) can be<br>
removed by treatment with a reducing agent to provide other compounds of formula (I).<br>
Reducing agents are well known to persons skilled in the art and can include hydride<br>
sources like borohydrides and alkali metal borohydrides, but would include hydrogen in<br>
catalytic hydrogenation where a suitable catalyst such as palladium on carbon may be<br>
used. Other suitable hydride sources include sodium triacetoxyborohydride tetrabutyl<br>
ammonium triacetoxyborohydride and sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
Preferably the double bond is reduced by hydrogenation.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (II) may be prepared by reducing the double bond, preferably by<br>
hydrogenation, in the heterocyclic ring in compounds of formula (IV):<br><br>
or a protected derivative thereof wherein:<br>
R1, R6, R7, R8 and R9 are as defined above for compound of formula (II)<br>
Access to compounds of general formula (IV) is available by general synthetic methods as<br>
set out in Scheme 1 below and as described in published International application No.<br>
WO01/17986, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The general<br>
synthetic method is set out in Scheme 1.<br><br>
Compounds for use in the preferred synthetic methods of the present invention may be<br>
derived from any number of sources readily identifiable to a person skilled in the art. For<br><br>
example, daidzein is readily available or can be synthesised by standard methods known in<br>
the art. Suitable methods may be found in, for example, published International Patent<br>
Applications WO 98/08503 and WO 00/49009, and references cited therein, which are<br>
incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.<br>
Clearly one or more of the above strategies may require the use of a one or more protecting<br>
groups in order to protect functionality in other parts of the molecule, when preforming a<br>
particular treatment or step.<br>
Preferably any free alcohols, esters or other such reactive groups will be protected, for<br>
example, as t-butyldimethylsilyl ethers during nucleophilic addition reactions.<br>
Chemical modifications and manipulations may be performed on the compounds of the<br>
invention as would be known to one skilled in the art. For example, reaction of compound<br>
No. 1 with alkylating agents gives ether derivatives at the free phenolic groups.<br>
Halogenation of the aromatic rings is also possible and, for example, reaction with N-<br>
bromosuccinimide affords the 8-bromo derivative (compound 42) as the main component,<br>
with smaller amounts of the 6-bromo isomer. Further reactions can include demethylation<br>
of alkoxy groups by employing, for example, hydrogen bromide in acetic acid to afford the<br>
trihydroxy compound 43.<br><br>
Additional compounds synthesised by the inventors include:<br><br><br>
As used herein, the terms "treatment", "prophylaxis" or "prevention", "amelioration" and<br>
the like are to be considered in their broadest context. In particular, the term "treatment"<br>
does not necessarily imply that an animal is treated until total recovery, Accordingly,<br>
"treatment" includes amelioration of the symptoms or severity of a particular condition or<br>
preventing or otherwise reducing the risk of developing a particular condition.<br>
The amount of one or more compounds according to the invention which is required in a<br>
therapeutic treatment will depend upon a number of factors, which include the specific<br>
application, the nature of the particular compound used, the condition being treated, the<br>
mode of administration and the condition of the patient.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be administered in a manner and amount as is<br>
conventionally practised. See, for example, Goodman and Gilman, "The pharmacological<br>
basis of therapeutics", 7th Edition, (1985). The specific dosage utilised will depend upon<br>
the condition being treated, the state of the subject, the route of administration and other<br>
well known factors as indicated above. In general, a daily dose per patient may be in the<br>
range of 0.1 mg to 5 g; typically from 0.5 mg to 1 g; preferably from 50 mg to 200 mg.<br>
The length of dosing may range from a single dose given once every day or two, to twice<br>
or thrice daily doses given over the course of from a week to many months to many years<br>
as required, depending on the severity of the condition to be treated or alleviated.<br>
It will be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens<br>
should be adjust over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment<br>
of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions.<br><br>
Relatively short-term treatments with the active compounds can be used to cause<br>
stabilisation or shrinkage or remission of cancers. Longer-term treatments can be<br>
employed to prevent the development of cancers in high-risk patients.<br>
The production of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of the therapeutic<br>
indications herein described are typically prepared by admixture of the compounds of the<br>
invention (for convenience hereafter referred to as the "active compounds") with one or<br>
more pharmaceutically or veterinary acceptable carriers and/or excipients as are well<br>
known in the art.<br>
The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other<br>
ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the subject. The carrier or<br>
excipient may be a solid or a liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the<br>
compound as a unit-dose, for example, a tablet, which may contain up to 100% by weight<br>
of the active compound, preferably from 0.5% to 59% by weight of the active compound.<br>
The preferred concentration of active compound in the drug composition will depend on<br>
absorption, distribution, inactivation, and excretion rates of the drug as well as other<br>
factors known to those of skill in the art. One or more active compounds may be<br>
incorporated in the formulations of the invention.<br>
The formulations of the invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, ocular, buccal (for<br>
example, sublingual), parenteral (for example, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal,<br>
or intravenous), transdermal administration including mucosal administration via the nose,<br>
mouth, vagina or rectum, and as inhalants, although the most suitable route in any given<br>
case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature<br>
of the particular active compound which is being used.<br>
Formulation suitable for oral administration may be presented in discrete units, such as<br>
capsules, sachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the<br><br>
active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. Such formulations may<br>
be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into<br>
association the active compound and a suitable carrier (which may contain one or more<br>
accessory ingredients as noted above).<br>
In general, the formulations of the invention are prepared by uniformly and intimately<br>
admixing the active compound with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and<br>
then, if necessary, shaping the resulting mixture such as to form a unit dosage. For<br>
example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or moulding a powder or granules<br>
containing the active compound, optionally with one or more other ingredients.<br>
Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the compound<br>
of the free-flowing, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant,<br>
inert diluent, and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s). Moulded tablets may be made by<br>
moulding, in a suitable machine, the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid<br>
binder.<br>
Formulations suitable for buccal (sublingual) administration include lozenges comprising<br>
the active compound in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; and<br>
pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose<br>
and acacia.<br>
Formulations suitable for ocular administration include liquids, gels and creams<br>
comprising the active compound in an ocularly acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
Compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration conveniently<br>
comprise sterile aqueous preparations of the active compounds, which preparations are<br>
preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations are<br>
preferably administered intravenously, although administration may also be effected by<br>
means of subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal injection. Such preparations may<br><br>
conveniently be prepared by admixing the compound with water or a glycine buffer and<br>
rendering the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with the blood. Injectable formulations<br>
according to the invention generally contain from 0.1% to 60% w/v of active compound<br>
and can be administered at a rate of 0.1 ml/minute/kg.<br>
Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit dose<br>
suppositories. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration are preferably presented as<br>
unit dose pessaries. These may be prepared by admixing the active compound with one or<br>
more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping the resulting<br>
mixture.<br>
Formulations or compositions suitable for topical administration to the skin preferably take<br>
the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers which<br>
may be used include Vaseline, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols, and combination of<br>
two or more thereof. The active compound is generally present at a concentration of from<br>
0.1% to 5% w/w, more particularly from 0.5%o to 2% w/w. Examples of such<br>
compositions include cosmetic skin creams.<br>
Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches<br>
adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged<br>
period of time. Such patches suitably contain the active compound as an optionally<br>
buffered aqueous solution of, for example, 0.1 M to 0.2 M concentration with respect to<br>
the said active compound. See for example Brown, L., et al. (1998).<br>
Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may also be delivered by<br>
iontophoresis (see, for example, Panchagnula R, et al, 2000) and typically take the form of<br>
an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the active compound. Suitable formulations<br>
comprise citrate or Bis/Tris buffer (pH 6) or ethanol/water and contain from 0.1 M to 0.2<br>
M active ingredient.<br><br>
Formulations suitable for inhalation may be delivered as a spray composition in the form<br>
of a solution, suspension or emulsion. The inhalation spray composition may further<br>
comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable propellant such as a hydrogen containing<br>
fluorocarbon such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafiuoro-n-propane.<br>
The active compounds may be provided in the form of food stuffs, such as being added to,<br>
admixed into, coated, combined or otherwise added to a food stuff. The term food stuff is<br>
used in its widest possible sense and includes liquid formulations such as drinks including<br>
dairy products and other foods, such as health bars, desserts, etc. Food formulations<br>
containing compounds of the invention can be readily prepared according to standard<br>
practices.<br>
In a preferred aspect the invention provides a method of treating humans by administering<br>
an effective amount of one or more compounds according to the invention or a<br>
composition containing the same.<br>
The active compound or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives prodrugs or salts thereof<br>
can also be co-administered with other active materials that do not impair the desired<br>
action, or with materials that supplement the desired action, such as antibiotics,<br>
antifungals, antiinflammatories, or antiviral compounds. The active agent can comprise<br>
two or more isoflavones or derivatives thereof in combination or synergistic mixture. The<br>
active compounds can also be administered with lipid lowering agents such as probucpl<br>
and nicotinic acid; platelet aggregation inhibitors such as aspirin; antithrombotic agents<br>
such as Coumadin; calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine;<br>
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril, and 0-<br>
blockers such as propanolol, terbutalol, and labetalol. The compounds can also be<br>
administered in combination with nonsteriodal antiinflammatories such as ibuprofen,<br>
indomethacin, aspirin, fenoprofen, mefenamic acid, flufenamic acid and sulindac or an<br>
antiemetic such as zofranÂ®. The compounds can also be administered with corticosteroids.<br><br>
Compounds of formula (I) seem to be particularly suitable for co-administration with other<br>
anti-cancer drugs such as cisplatin and/or dehydroequol and/or taxol. This may result in<br>
improved effects in the treatment in comparison to when only one of the medicaments is<br>
employed.<br>
The co-administration may be simultaneous or sequential. Simultaneous administration<br>
may be effected by the compounds being in the same unit dose, or in individual and<br>
discrete unit doses administered at the same or similar time. Sequential administration<br>
may be in any order as required and typically will require an ongoing physiological effect<br>
of the first or initial active agent to be current when the second or later active agent is<br>
administered, especially where a cumulative or synergistic effect is desired.<br>
The invention also extends to novel intermediates employed in the preparation of<br>
compounds according to the invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention are useful in the treatment, prevention or amelioration of<br>
diseases associated with aberrant cell survival, aberrant cell proliferation, abnormal<br>
cellular migration, abnormal angiogenesis, abnormal estrogen/androgen balance,<br>
dysfunctional or abnormal steroid genesis, degeneration including degenerative changes<br>
within blood vessel walls, inflammation, and immunological imbalance.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples and<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1 3-(4-hvdroxvphenyl)-4-f4-methoxyphenyI)-8-methyl-3.4-dihydro-2H-<br>
chromen-7-oI<br>
Stepl l-(2,4-Dihydroxy-3-methyI-phenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-ethanone<br><br><br>
2-Methylresorcinol (4.00g, 1 equivalent) and 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid (5.00g, 1<br>
equivalent) were added to a round bottom flask. The round bottom flask was attached to a<br>
condenser and placed in an oil bath, the whole system was kept under nitrogen. Distilled<br>
BF3.OEt2 (20ml, 5 equiv.) was added to the mixture while stirring. The mixture was<br>
refluxed (110Â°C). A yellow solid formed at 20 minutes indicating that the reaction had<br>
gone to completion. The reaction was left on heat for a further 10 minutes and then cooled<br>
to room temperature. The yellow solid was collected by suction filtration and washed with<br>
distilled water (200ml) to remove any excess BF3.OEt2 present. 1H NMR in d-DMSO<br>
indicated the yellow solid was l-(2,4-Dihydroxy-3 -methyl-phenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-<br>
ethanone in &gt;95% purity. The solid was dried on a freeze dryer for 24hours (8.93g, 99%).<br>
Step 2 7-Hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-chromen-4-one<br><br>
l-(2,4-Dihydroxy-3-methyl-phenyl)-2-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-ethanone (3.99g) and N,N-<br>
DMF (115ml) were added to a 500ml 2-neck round bottom flask, the flask was attached to<br>
a condenser and placed in an oil bath. A dropping funnel was attached to the round bottom<br>
flask, and the whole system was kept under nitrogen. The flask was heated and maintained<br>
at 50Â°C. BF3,OEt2 (57ml, 29 equiv.) was added drop wise to the solution over a period of<br>
15 minutes, producing fumes. Methane sulfonyl chloride (MeSO2Cl) (14ml, 12 equiv.) was<br>
added to N,N-DMF (14ml) in the dropping funnel. This mixture was then added drop wise<br>
to the round bottom flask over a period of 10 minutes. Once addition was complete, the<br>
temperature was increased to reflux (110Â°C). The reaction was monitored by HPLC<br><br>
(NV06_R&amp;D.m) and was completed at 1 hr and 44 mins. The mixture was cooled to room<br>
temperature and poured into chilled stirred distilled water (4L). A bright yellow floccular<br>
precipitate was immediately produced and the mixture was left stirring in the cold room<br>
overnight. The mixture was then filtered through a buchner funnel, to give a yellow solid.<br>
'HNMR of the solid in d-DMSO indicated it was 7-Hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-8-<br>
methyl-chromen-4-one with &gt;95% purity. The solid was dried on a freeze dryer for 24<br>
hours. When dry, the solid was weighed (2.73g, 66%).<br>
Step 3 Acetic acid 3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-4-oxo-4H-chromen-7-yl ester<br><br>
Hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-chromen-4-one (35.18g) were combined into a<br>
round bottom flask (1L). Pyridine (38ml, 2 equivalents) and acetic anhydride (576ml, 47<br>
equivalents) were added to the round bottom flask while stirring at room temperature. The<br>
reaction was monitored by HPLC and was completed instantaneously. There was a change<br>
in colour observed, the reaction mixture was dark brown initially and went bright orange<br>
with tan brown floccular particles upon stirring. The reaction mixture was poured into<br>
chilled, distilled H2O (4L) and was left stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes. An<br>
off-white solid was collected by suction filtration. 1HNMR of the solid in d-CDCl3<br>
indicated it was Acetic acid 3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-4-oxo-4H-chromen-7-yl ester<br>
with &gt;95% purity The solid was dried on a freeze dryer for 24 hours. When dry, the solid<br>
was weighed (31.80g, 69%).<br>
Step 4 Acetic acid 3-(4-hydroxy-phenyI)-8-methyl-4-oxo-chroman-7-yl ester<br><br><br>
Acetic acid 3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-4-oxo-4H-chromen-7-yl ester (26.32g), 10%<br>
Pd/Al2O3 (12.93g, 50%) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (1.5 L) were added to a hydrogenation<br>
round bottom flask (2L). The flask was placed on the hydrogenator, evacuated, purged<br>
with nitrogen gas (x5) and hydrogen gas (x5). The reaction was monitored by HPLC. 10%<br>
Pd/Al2O3(9g, 35%) was added to the round bottom flask at 40 hours, indicated there was<br>
no product peak present, only starting material was present. HPLC at 62 hours indicated<br>
that the major peak was product peak with starting material peak being half height of<br>
product peak. 10% Pd/Al2O3(5.69g, 20%) was added to the round bottom flask to speed up<br>
reaction rate. Reaction was completed at 64 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered<br>
through celite to remove the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst, the celite was rinsed with EtOAc (1L) to<br>
ensure majority of product was collected. The EtOAc was evaporated off on a rotary<br>
evaporator to give a yellow solid. The solid was re-crystallised in 95% EtOH (650ml) and<br>
left in the freezer overnight. Off-white crystals were collected by suction filtration.<br>
1HNMR in d-CDCI3 indicated the off-white crystals were 8Acetic acid 3-(4-hydroxy-<br>
phenyl)-8-<br>
methyl-4-oxo-chroman-7-yl ester with &gt;95% purity. The crystals were stored in a<br>
desiccator for 24 hours, and weighed (18.37g, 69%).<br>
Step 5 7-Hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-chroman-4-one<br><br>
Acetic acid 3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-4-oxo-chroman-7-yl ester (18.37g), imidazole<br>
(21.18g, 6 equivalents) and 100% EtOH (536ml) were added to a round bottom flask (2L).<br>
The reaction mixture was refluxed and monitored by HPLC. The reaction was completed<br><br>
at 8 hours. The reaction mixture was reduced (~130ml) on a rotary evaporator and poured<br>
into stirred, chilled distilled water (1.9L). The water crash out was left stirring in the cold<br>
room overnight. The pale pink solid was collected by suction filtration. 'H NMR of the<br>
solid indicated it was 7-Hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-chroman-4-one with &gt;<br>
95% purity. The solid was dried on the freeze dryer for 3 hours (8.3 lg, 59%).<br>
Step 6 7,4'-Bis te/^butyldimethylsilyloxy-8-methyl-dihydrodaidzein<br><br>
8-methyldihydrodaidzein 4.2g, imidazole 13g, tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride 12.7g (70<br>
mmoles), and N,N-DMF 50ml were combined in a 250mlL round bottom flask and stirred<br>
under nitrogen at room temperature for 16hours. The reaction was quenched with the<br>
addition of chilled water (100ml) with the reaction mix cooled in an ice bath. A white<br>
solid was filtered off, rinsed with water. Recrystallisation from ethanol afforded white<br>
fluffy crystals 3.2g.<br>
Step7 7-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-3-(4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)phenyl)-4-(4-<br>
methoxypenyl)-8-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-4-ol<br><br><br>
2.5g of the product of step 6 was weighed in a 2-neck round bottom flask, and flushed<br>
under nitrogen. Anhydrous THF 10ml was added to the reaction vessel to give a clear<br>
slightly yellow solution. A condenser was attached and the reaction vessel placed in an ice<br>
bath. Commercial 4-methoxyphenylmagnesium bromide (0.5M solution in THF) 22.5ml<br>
was added to the reaction mix dropwise over 10 minutes. The reaction was quenched by<br>
the dropwise with wet ether (50:50 H2O: diethyl ether) while still under nitrogen, with a<br>
white precipitate forming as increasing amounts of H2O added. A further amount of water<br>
was added to the reaction mix before extraction with diethyl ether.<br>
The organic layers were combined and washed with water, brine, dried over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulphate and solvent removed in vacuo to give clear yellow oil which<br>
solidified overnight to give an off-white solid. The oily nature of the material precluded an<br>
accurate yield being calculated. There was no further clean up of the product before use in<br>
the next reaction. The oily nature of the material precluded an accurate yield being<br>
calculated.<br><br>
4.2g of the product of step 7, pTsOH (para-toluene sulphoric acid) 4.5g boiling chips and<br>
200ml of ethanol were combined in a 2-neck 500ml round bottom flask with condenser<br>
attached. The reaction was heated at reflux for 3 hours. The solvent was concentrated in<br>
vacuo to ~20ml before being poured into chilled, stirred water( 100ml). The mixture was<br>
then extracted with ethyl acetate, the combined organic layers washed with water (3 x<br>
100ml), brine (1 x 100ml), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate and filtered and<br>
solvent removed in vacuo to give red/ brown oil. The oil was dissolved in methanol<br>
(~15ml) and put in freezer overnight.<br><br>
A white precipitate had formed overnight which was filtered off and rinsed with methanol.<br>
The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to give a brown oil.<br>
Step9 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-8-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-<br>
7-ol<br><br>
2.5g of the product of step 8,10% Pd/Al2O3 0.4g and 50ml of ethanol were combined in a<br>
2-neck 100ml round bottom flask. The reaction was hydrogenated at low pressure using<br>
standard conditions for 3 hours. The reaction was filtered through Celite to remove the<br>
catalyst, rinsed through with ethanol (100ml). The filtrate was concentrated to ~15ml<br>
before being poured into chilled, stirred water (300mL). A pale orange precipitate formed<br>
which then formed a brown oil. The mixture was then extracted with diethyl ether, the<br>
combined organic layers washed with water (3 x 100ml), brine (1 x 100ml), dried over<br>
anhydrous magnesium sulphate and filtered. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give<br>
red/ brown oil. The product was recrystallised from diethyl ether (~15ml), to give brown<br>
solid which was rinsed with chilled diethyl ether to give off-white crystals. 4 crops of<br>

Step 1.1 l-(2,4-dihydroxy-3-methyI-phenyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyI) ethanone<br><br>
2-Methylresorcinol (6.285g, lequivalent) and 3,4-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid (9.25lg, 1<br>
equivalent) were added to a round bottom flask. The round bottom flask was attached to a<br>
condenser and placed in an oil bath, the whole system was kept under nitrogen. Distilled<br>
boron trifluoride diethyl etherate, BF3.OEt2 (42ml, 5 equiv.) was added to the mixture<br>
while stirring. The mixture was refluxed (110Â° C). A yellow solid formed at 75 minutes<br>
indicating that the reaction had gone to completion. The reaction was heated for a further<br>
10 minutes and cooled to room temperature. The yellow solid was collected by suction<br>
filtration and washed with distilled water (200ml) to remove any excess BF3.OEt2 present.<br>
lH NMR in d-DMSO indicated the yellow solid was l-(2,4-dihydroxy-3-methyl-phenyl)-2-<br><br>
(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl) ethanone in &gt;95% purity. The solid was dried on a freeze dryer for<br>
24hours (6.303g, 43%).<br><br>
l-(2,4-dihydroxy-3-methyl-phenyl)-2-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl) ethanone (1078-1-49; 9.999<br>
g, 34.4 mmol) was dissolved in N.N-DMF (15 mL), dried with MgSO4- Under an N2<br>
atmosphere, distilled BF3-OEt2 (16.08.04) was added dropwise at r.t. Heat begun after 20<br>
min. After 1 h, methane sulfonyl chloride in DMF (8 mL in 20 mL) was slowly added at<br>
50Â°C. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 1.5 h. The dull yellow solution was<br>
added to 1.2 L of cold, vigorously stirred water which was left at 4Â°C overnight. The dull<br>
yellow solid was collected by filtration, then placed in water to remove residual BF3-OEt2.<br>
Solid was collected by filtration and dried using a freeze-dryer overnight. 1H NMR in d-<br>
DMSO indicated the yellow solid was 3-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-7-hydroxy-8-methyl-<br>
chromen-4-one in 90% purity (8.85 g, 82%).<br><br>
3-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-7-hydroxy-8-methyl-chromen-4-one (9.82g, 31mmol), acetic<br>
anhydride (62ml) and pyridine (6.2ml) were combined in a round bottom flask and heated<br>
to reflux. The reaction was cooled to room temperature after 3 hours of heating, and a<br>
crystalline solid formed. The solid was filtered and rinsed with H2O (1L). 1H NMR in d-<br>
CDCl3 indicated pale brown crystals was acetic acid 3-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-<br>
4-oxo-4H-chromen-7-yl ester in 90% purity (7.214g, 71%).<br><br><br>
3-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-4-oxo-4H-chromen-7-yl ester (1.12g, 3mmol), 10%<br>
Pd/Al2O3 (0.50 lg, 45% w/w) and dry EtOAc (100ml) were placed in a 2-neck round<br>
bottom flask and placed on the hydrogenator. After 4 hours, 1 major product was observed.<br>
The reaction was purged and the catalyst filtered off through celite. The filtrate was<br>
reduced to give a white solid. 1H NMR in d-CDCl3 indicated the solid was Acetic acid 3-<br>
(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-4-oxo-chroman-7-yl ester in 85% purity (l.lg).<br><br>
Acetic acid 3-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-8-methyl-4-oxo-chroman-7-yl ester (l.lg, 3.2mmol)<br>
and imidazole (3.2g, 47mmol) were refluxed in EtOH (100ml). The reaction was complete<br>
after 90 minutes and allowed to cool to room temperature before pouring into stirred H2O<br>
(800ml). A fine white precipitate was filtered off and 1H NMR in d-CDCl3 indicated the<br>
solid was 3-(3,4-Dimethoxy-phenyl)-7-hydroxy-8-methyl-chroman-4-one in &gt;95% purity<br>
(0.31g,30%).<br>
Step 6.1 7,4'-Bis tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy-3',4'-dimethoxy-8-methyl-dihydrodaidzein<br><br><br>
3,4'Dimethoxy-8-methyldihydrodaidzein 2g, imidazole 6.8g, tert Butyldimethylsilyl<br>
chloride 6.3g, and N,N-DMF 50ml were combined in a 250mlL round bottom flask and<br>
stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 16hours. The reaction was quenched with<br>
the addition of chilled water (100ml) with the reaction mix cooled in an ice bath. A white<br>
solid was filtered off, rinsed with water. Recrystallisation from ethanol afforded white<br>
fluffy crystals 2.2g<br>
Step 7.1 7-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-3-3-(4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)phenyl)-4-(4-<br>
methoxypenyl)-3',4'dimethoxy-8-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-4-ol<br><br>
The product of step 6.1 above 2g was weighed in a 2-neck round bottom flask, and flushed<br>
under nitrogen. Anhydrous THF 10ml was added to the reaction vessel to give a clear<br>
slightly yellow solution. A condenser was attached and the reaction vessel placed in an ice<br>
bath. Commercial 4-rnethoxyphenylmagnesium bromide (0.5M solution in THF) 22.5ml<br>
was added to the reaction mix dropwise over 10 minutes. The reaction was quenched by<br>
the dropwise with wet ether (50:50 H2O: diethyl ether) while still under nitrogen, with a<br>
white precipitate forming as increasing amounts of H2O added. A further amount of water<br>
was added to the reaction mix before extraction with diethyl ether.<br>
The organic layers were combined and washed with water, brine, dried over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulphate and solvent removed in vacuo to give clear yellow oil which<br><br>
solidified overnight to give an off-white solid. The oily nature of the material precluded an<br>
accurate yield being calculated. There was no further clean up of the product before use in<br>
the next reaction. The oily nature of the material precluded an accurate yield being<br>
calculated.<br>
Step 8.1 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3',4'-dimethoxy-8-methyl-2H-<br>
chromen-7-ol<br><br>
2g of the product of step 7.1 pTsOH 4.5g boiling chips and 100ml of ethanol were<br>
combined in a 2-neck 500ml round bottom flask with condenser attached. The reaction<br>
was heated at reflux for 3 hours. The solvent was concentrated in vacuo to ~10ml before<br>
being poured into chilled, stirred water (100ml). The mixture was then extracted with<br>
ethyl acetate, the combined organic layers washed with water (3 x 100ml), brine (1 x<br>
100ml), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate and filtered and solvent removed in<br>
vacuo to give red/ brown oil. The oil was dissolved in methanol (~15ml) and put in freezer<br>
overnight.<br>
A white precipitate had formed overnight which was filtered off and rinsed with methanol.<br>
The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to give a brown oil, which was crashed out into<br>
water to give a pale brown solid.<br>
Step 9.1 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3',4'-dimethoxy-8-methyl-3,4-<br>
dihydro-2H-chromen-7-ol<br><br><br>
lg of the product of step 8.1 10% Pd/Al2O3 0.2g and 25ml of ethanol were combined in a<br>
2-neck 100ml round bottom flask. The reaction was hydrogenated at low pressure using<br>
standard conditions for 3 hours. The reaction was filtered through Celite to remove the<br>
catalyst, rinsed through with ethanol (100ml). The filtrate was concentrated to ~5ml<br>
before being poured into chilled, stirred water (100mL). A pale orange precipitate formed<br>
which then formed a brown oil. The mixture was then extracted with diethyl ether, the<br>
combined organic layers washed with water (3 x 100ml), brine (1 x 100ml), dried over<br>
anhydrous magnesium sulphate and filtered. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give<br>
red/ brown oil. The product was recrystallised from diethyl ether (~5ml), to give brown<br>
solid which was rinsed with chilled diethyl ether to give off-white crystals. 4 crops of (IV),<br>

2.0.	Materials and Methods<br>
2.1.	Tissue culture<br>
The human pancreatic cancer cell line, HPAC (CRL-2119) was routinely cultured in 1:1<br>
mixture DMEM (Sigma) plus Ham's F12 (Sigma) medium containing HEPES (15 mM),<br>
insulin (0.002 mg/ml), transferrin (0.005 mg/ml), hydrocortisone, (40 ng/ml), epidermal<br>
growth factor (10 ng/ml). The ovarian cancer cell lines; CP70 was obtained as a gift from<br>
Dr. Gil Mor (Yale University) and cultured in a 1:1 mixture DMEM plus Ham's F12<br>
medium, and SKOV-3 was purchased from ATCC and cultured in McCoys 5a medium.<br>
The breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 were cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 medium. The<br>
melanoma cell line MM200 was obtained as a gift from Peter Hersey (University of<br>
Newcastle) and A2058 was obtained as a gift from Dr Peter Parsons (QIMR). Both were<br>
cultured in DMEM medium.<br>
All cultures were supplemented with 10% FCS (CSL, Australia), penicillin (l00U/ml),<br>
streptomycin (100mg/ml), L-glutamine (2mM) and sodium bicarbonate (1.2 g/L), and<br>
cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All cell lines were purchased<br>
from ATCC (Maryland, USA) except where noted.<br>
The normal cell line NFF (neonatal foreskin fibroblasts) was a gift from Dr. Peter Parsons<br>
(Queensland Institute of Medical Research). RK (rabbit kidney) cells were obtained from<br>
Miller Whalley (Macquarie University). Both cell lines were cultured in RPMI<br><br>
supplemented with 10% FCS (CSL, Australia), penicillin (100U/ml), streptomycin<br>
(100mg/ml), L-glutamine (2mM) and sodium bicarbonate (1.2 g/L), and cultured at 37Â°C<br>
in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2<br>
2.2.	Proliferation assays<br>
IC50 values were determined for each cell line. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at an<br>
appropriate cell density as determined from growth kinetics analysis and cultured for 5<br>
days in the absence and presence of the test compounds. Cell proliferation was assessed<br>
after the addition of 20 Âµl of 3-4,5 dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide<br>
(MTT, 2.5mg/ml in PBS, Sigma) for 3-4hrs at 37Â°C according to manufacturer's<br>
instructions. IC50 values were calculated from semi-log plots of % of control proliferation<br>
on the y-axis against log dose on the x-axis.<br>
2.3.	Compound No. 1 Pharmacokinetics - Oral<br>
Compound No. 1 labelled above was prepared as homogenous suspensions in 1%<br>
CMC(m:v, water). The formulation was delivered orally by gavage to female BALB/c<br>
mice at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. Three animals were allocated to each timepoint (15 min, 30<br>
min, lhr, 4 hr and 24 hr). At each respective timepoint, animals were euthanased by<br>
cervical dislocation and blood collected. The concentration of free compound was<br>
analysed by mass spectroscopy.<br>
3.0.	Results<br>
3.1.	Normal cell toxicity.<br>
Duplicate cutotoxicity assays against rabbit kidney cells demonstrated that compound No.<br>
1 has mild toxicity against these cells (Table 1). When compared to cisplatin and<br>
phenoxodiol another benchmark against which potential anti-cancer drugs can be tested the<br>
degree of toxicity exhibited by compound No. 1 was greater than both the comparator<br>
compounds (2 ÂµM compound No. 1 vs 9.9 ÂµM cisplatin).<br>
Table 1. Relative toxicity of compound No. 1 and cisplatin against rabbit kidney cells.<br><br><br>
3.2. In vitro efficacy against cancer cells.<br>
When compared the IC50 values of phenoxodiol and compound No, 1, were compared,<br>
compound No.l demonstrated superior activity (-2-10 fold greater) against the ovarian<br>
cancer cell line (CP70), the AR negative, p53 Mt prostate cancer cell line (PC3), ER<br>
negative (p53 mt) breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-468 respectively), p53 Mt Glioma<br>
(HTB-138), and p53 Mt small cell lung cancer (Table 2). Compound No. 1 exhibited anti-<br>
cancer activity comparable to that of phenoxodiol against all other cell lines tested (Table<br>
2) except HT-29 which is a colorectal cell line. Compound No. 1 was also equipotent<br>
against the melanoma cell line MM200 (Table 2.1).<br>
Thus, compound No. 1 shows good anticancer activity against a broad range of cancer cell<br>
types, including ovarian, prostate, breast, glioma, pancreatic lung, colorectal and<br>
melanoma.<br><br><br>
A number of cancer cell lines were tested against analogues of compound No. 1 and their<br>
IC50 values were compared. The results show that compound No.l is the best across a<br>
broad range of cell lines, whilst compound No. 20 also showed good results against<br>
ovarian, prostate breast leukaemia and melanoma cell lines. Compound Nos. 15 and 17<br>
also showed good results against ovarian and melanoma cell lines respectively (Table 2.2).<br><br><br><br>
3.3. Compound No. 1 Pharmacokinetics - oral<br>
Oral pharmacokinetics was determined in the female BALB/c mouse. A Cmax of 27.3 uM<br>
free compound No. 1 was observed in the sera 15 minutes post administrations.<br>
Compound No. 1 was rapidly eliminated from sera with a concentration of 8.2 )ÂµM<br>
observed after 30 min and 2.4 ÂµM after 1 hr making the half life of this agent around 30<br>
minutes (Fig 1 and Table 3). The majority of compound No. 1 in sera was present in its<br>
conjugated state with the concentration of total compound No. 1 (free plus conjugate)<br>
achieved being -100 uM 15 min post administration (1:4; free:total). The ratio of free :<br>
total decreased over time (1:12 after 30 min and 1:13 after 1 hr). Rapid appearance of<br>
compound No. 1 in urine at high concentrations (815 ÂµM) 15 min post administration<br>
provides evidence that compound No. 1 is absorbed from the gastro intestinal tract and<br>
excreted via the kidneys.<br>
Compound No. 1 concentrations in urine peaked at 30 min (2640 uM) with levels<br>
declining to -1500 ÂµM and 545 ÂµM at 1 and 4 hr respectively post administration. The<br>
majority of said compound was present in it's conjugated form with only 
entity was noted at any time-point. A large proportion of said compound was also excreted<br>
in faeces, which was observed at least 1 hr post administration. However, it is not possible<br>
to confirm whether hepatic excretion is a mode of removal for this compound due to the<br><br>
fact that no liver samples were assessed and because the observation of the compound in<br>
faeces may be due to residual compound powder not absorbed from the gastro intestinal<br>
tract. It is interesting to note that almost 100% of the compound recovered from faeces<br>
was present in it's free form.<br>
f <br>
 When compared to the oral pharmacokinetic data of phenoxodiol and compound No. 1<br>
would appear to have a similar half life, however 10-20 fold higher free concentrations of<br>
compound No. 1 were achieved after 15 and 30 min. Approximately 2-fold higer<br>
concentrations were observed after 1 hr.<br>
5 <br><br>
4.0. Effect on murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) stimulated with LPS<br>
The mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was cultured in DMEM supplemented with<br>
foetal calf serum (FCS), 2mM glutamine and 50U/ml penicillin/streptomycin.<br>
Subconfluent cells were detached from the flask by gentle scraping and 24-well plates<br>
seeded at 5 x 105 cells per well and allowed to adhere for lhr. Cells were then treated<br>
either test compound at a concentration of 10ÂµM (in 0.025% DMSO) or vehicle alone, and<br>
incubated for lhr. LPS 50ng/ml (LPS -Sigma-Aldrich) was then added. After incubation<br>
for 16hrs, culture media was collected and stored at -80Â°C for ecosanoid measurements<br>
using enzyme immunometric assays (PGE2 and TXB2 - Cayman Chemical).<br>
Table 5: Percentage change in eicosanoid synthesis after incubating test compound at<br>
10ÂµM compared with incubation with vehicle alone. Positive values indicate enhanced<br>
synthesis; negative values indicate inhibition of synthesis and consequently suggest anti-<br>
inflammatory activity.<br><br>
5.0 Conclusions<br><br>
Compound No. 1 exhibits marked toxicity toward primary explants of non-transformed<br>
neonatal foreskin fibroblasts at concentrations less than cisplatin (IC50 = 2 ÂµM compound<br>
No. 1 vs 9 ÂµM cisplatin respectively). However, relative mild toxicity was noted against<br>
rabbit kidney cells (Compound No. 1 IC50 &gt;60 ÂµM). Efficacy studies demonstrate that<br>
compound No. 1 is active against cell lines representative of melanoma (MM200) and<br>
glioma (HTB-128). However, compound seems particularly active against cell lines<br>
representative of prostate (PC3), breast (MDA-MB-468) and lung cancer (NCIHH-H23)<br>
which traditionally have been cancers which are bery difficult to treat.<br>
Compound No. 1 was moderately active against the colorectal cell line HT-29.<br>
Pharmacokinetic analysis of compound No. 1 revealed that oral administration of the drug<br>
yields markedly higher concentrations of the free form of the drug when compared to<br>
similarly administered phenoxidiol at 15 and 30 rnin post administration. Compound No. 1<br>
and phenoxodiol each exhibit similar tl/2 (-30 min).<br>
Preliminary formulation studies of compound No. 1 reveal that the molecule has moderate<br>
to low solublity in 20% HPBCD (11.2 mg/ml).<br>
