well and the water collection is directly made by the inlet openings 38, 38'.<br>
In other possibility, the pump receives in its nozzlc 4 of .accessories fining .a hose 5.0 (Figures 3 .and 4) to he used supported in the base as a suction pump. '1he base 50 is a tubular body comprised by a cou pling cylindrical upper section 5I in the nozzle 4 of me pump and by aconi cal-tubular trunk tower section 52, which is extended and widened as from that, of support in the bottom of the well and provided with a water intakes 53 lining up, placed close to the upper end of the mentioned conical-tubular<br>
trunk section 52.<br>
in another possibility of use, the pump receives a coupling 60 nozzle 4 (Figures 4 and 5), purposed to connect the pump inlet to Uic outlet of A second pump, in xtrdcr to .assemble various pumps in scries vertically placed, for reaching biggest depths or horizontally placed for prcs surization .of the pumping lines. The .coupling 60 is a tubular body .comprised by u coupling jcylindrfcal end .til in ihc pump nozzlc 4, intermediate conical section 62 and cylindrical extreme section oflowcr diameter 63 of receiving .and fastening .of Ihe .connection nipple (64) Jta .a pump outlet. In this way of use, at Jeasl .the pumps following .to .the last upstream pump, .receive external belts made of rubber-type matcrial 70, purposed to fasten the main electrical feeding cable 13', from which are derived the cables 13 mat reach the pumps. In this way, the pump, object of the present pioneer patent, can be properly applied in tubular well, by taking into account that has dimensioning proper to such purpose, without however have its cfilcicn cy reduced.<br>
The cooling device of the present pump, as hereinbefore conceived and described, solves in proper way the solcnoid-<br>
heatiiig problem, by improving both the pump output and useful life.<br>
And, yet, the possibility of connecting the pump to different accessories will make possible a wide flexibility of its use, by more<br>
completely fulfilling the requirements of the consumer market.<br>
Within the basic conception hereinbefore described, it is being pled the possibility of presenting the pump, object of this pioneer patent, changes relating to materials, dimensions and constructive details without leaving the sphere of the requested protection. for mis purpose, the pump might have its frame made of stainless steel or aluminum (Figures 1 to 5) or of engineering plastic (Figure 6), solutions which are substantially<br><br>
preserving the same characteristics, yet incorporating only some constructive differences, however related to the possibilities of arrangements resulting from the materials utilized in its construction. Thus, (he pump with plastic frame has substantially the same construction of that one made of steel or aluminum, except that foresees a second lower closing 40'", which corresponds to the second closing 40" of the other version, comprised by a cup that is coupled to nozzle 4, whose bottom has grate shape and supports the valve 37, admission chamber 36* and is able to receive accessory tor connection to the second pump inlet.<br>
The pump, object of the present pioneer patent, is to be used in the field of the hydraulic installations, particularly those purposed to water pumping, preferably water pumping from tubular well and is yet used for pressurization of pumping lines.<br><br><br><br><br>
