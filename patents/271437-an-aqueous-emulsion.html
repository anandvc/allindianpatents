DESCRIPTION<br>
AQUEOUS EMULSION AND PRODUCTION METHOD THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br><br>
This invention relates to an aqueous emulsion which comprises, as the dispersoid,<br>
a polymer comprising a structural unit derived from an ethylenically unsaturated monomer,<br>
and a production method thereof, more illustratively, it relates to an aqueous emulsion<br>
obtained by carrying out emulsion polymerization of an ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer in the presence of a polyvinyl alcohol-based resin as the dispersant, which is an<br>
aqueous emulsion that shows excellent adhesiveness for wood and the like and from which<br>
a film having excellent film-forming property, chemical stability and freezing stability and<br>
having excellent transparency can be obtained, and a production method thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Up to now, a polyvinyl alcohol-based resin (polyvinyl alcohol is referred to as<br>
PVA hereinafter) has been used suitably as a dispersant in the emulsion polymerization of<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomers.<br>
Among such ethylenically unsaturated monomers, vinyl acetate has high affinity<br>
for PVA-based resins and can produce an aqueous emulsion having excellent stability, but<br>
since the thus obtained vinyl acetate resin emulsion has high minimum film-forming<br>
temperature, there is a problem in that film-forming property and adhesiveness become<br>
insufficient under a low temperature environment.<br>
On the other hand, since an acrylic-based emulsion has sufficient film-forming<br>
property even under a low temperature environment, there is increasing a case in which<br>
such an acrylic-based resin emulsion is applied to applications wherein a vinyl acetate<br>
resin emulsion has been conventionally used.<br>
However, in the case of the acrylic-based resin emulsion, emulsification<br>
dispersion property is insufficient by a general unmodified PVA-based resin and, what is<br>
more, acrylic-based monomers have smaller radical reactivity in comparison with vinyl<br>
acetate, so that there is a case in which initial reaction is difficult to be generated in the<br><br><br>
presence of a PVA-based resin or stability at the time of polymerization becomes<br>
insufficient.<br>
In order to solve such problems in the production of acrylic-based resin emulsions,<br>
examinations are broadly carried out on the use of various modified PVA resins having<br>
further high dispersion stability, as the PVA-based resin.<br>
For example, as a dispersant which can provide an acrylic-based resin emulsion<br>
having excellent stability at the time of emulsion polymerization and having excellent<br>
long-term standing stability, dilute stability and mechanical stability, a PVA-based resin<br>
comprising a polyoxy alkylene group in its side chain has been proposed (e.g., see Patent<br>
Reference 1).<br>
In addition, a dispersant consisting of such a polyoxy alkylene group-containing<br>
PVA-based resin is suitably used in a polymerization method by a pre-emulsion method in<br>
which an acrylic-based monomer is emulsified and dispersed in water in the presence of a<br>
dispersant and the thus prepared pre-emulsion is polymerized by adding it dropwise to a<br>
polymerization reaction system.<br>
In this connection, the polyoxy alkylene group-containing PVA-based resin used<br>
in the Patent Reference 1 has a degree of saponification of from 30 to 80% by mol, and<br>
those having a degree of saponification of from 35 to 73% by mol, namely those having a<br>
region of lower degree of saponification as a PVA-based resin, are used in the Examples.<br><br>
In addition, as a dispersant which can provide an acrylic-based resin emulsion<br>
having excellent mechanical stability and freezing stability and also in long-term standing<br>
stability at high temperature, a PVA-based resin comprising a 1,2-diol structure in its side<br>
chain has been proposed (e.g., see Patent Reference 2).<br>
In this connection, there is described in this Patent Reference 2 that those which<br>
have a residual ester group quantity of 15% by mol or less (those having a degree of<br>
saponification of exceeding 85% by mol) are desirable as the PVA-based resin comprising<br>
a 1,2-diol structural unit, and in the Examples, those having a residual ester group quantity<br>
of from 2.2 to 6.0% by mol (from 94.0 to 97.8% by mol as the degree of saponification),<br>
namely those having a high range of the degree of saponification, are used as the PVA-<br>
based resin.<br><br><br>

Patent Reference 2: JP-A-2006-124682<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems that the Invention is to Solve<br><br>
However, when the present inventors have examined in detail on the techniques<br>
described in these patent references, it was found that the acrylic-based resin emulsion<br>
obtained in accordance with the Patent reference 1 by the pre-emulsion method using a<br>
PVA-based resin which contains a polyoxy alkylene group having low degree of<br>
saponification as the emulsification dispersant was excellent regarding its polymerization<br>
stability but insufficient in terms of its chemical stability and freezing stability and there is<br>
a room for improvement regarding the film-forming property.<br>
In addition, the acrylic-based resin emulsion obtained in accordance with the<br>
Patent reference 2 by the dropping polymerization using a PVA-based resin which contains<br>
a 1,2-diol structure having high degree of saponification as the dispersant was excellent<br>
regarding its mechanical stability, chemical stability, freezing stability and preservation<br>
stability, but coarse particles were formed depending on the emulsion polymerization<br>
conditions and kinds of the monomer to be used in the emulsion polymerization, and its<br>
film-forming property was insufficient and it was also insufficient in terms of the<br>
transparency of the film obtained from this.<br>
That is, the invention aims at providing an aqueous emulsion which shows<br>
excellent adhesiveness for wood and the like and from which a film having excellent film-<br>
forming property, chemical stability and freezing stability and having excellent<br>
transparency can be obtained, and a production method thereof.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br><br>
Taking the above-mentioned actual circumstances into consideration, the present<br>

invention can be achieved by the following constitution and thereby accomplished the<br>
invention.<br>

based resin and a polymer comprising, as the dispersoid, a structural unit derived from an<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer, wherein an average particle size of the dispersoid is<br><br><br>
from 100 to 450 nm and an apparent grafting efficiency of the polyvinyl alcohol-based<br>
resin based on the dispersoid is from 65 to 75%.<br>
(2)	The aqueous emulsion according to the above-mentioned (1), wherein the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer is an acrylic-based monomer.<br>
That is, the invention relates to an aqueous emulsion obtained by emulsion-<br>
polymerizing an ethylenically unsaturated monomer, in which its film-forming property<br>
and transparency of the film obtained therefrom are improved by reducing particle size of<br>
the dispersoid, and, while various stabilities generally have a tendency to lower when<br>
particle size becomes small due to increase of the surface area, the lowering is controlled<br>
by the value of the apparent grafting efficiency of the PVA-based resin based on the<br>
dispersoid, namely strength of the protective colloidal ability.<br><br>
(3)	The aqueous emulsion of the invention can be obtained, for example, by<br>
adding a pre-emulsion dropwise to an aqueous medium to carry out emulsion<br>
polymerization, wherein the pre-emulsion is obtained by emulsifying and dispersing the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer in water in the presence of the PVA-based resin which<br>
comprises a 1,2-diol structural unit represented by the following general formula (1) and<br>
has a degree of saponification of from 80 to 93% by mol.<br><br><br>
[In the formula, R1, R2 and R3 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or an organic<br>
group, X represents a single bond or a bonding chain, and R4, R5 and R6 each<br>
independently represent a hydrogen atom or an organic group.]<br><br>
That is, a pre-emulsion in which a monomer is finely dispersed in water is able to<br>
be obtained by the use of a PVA-based resin having excellent affinity for both of the<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer and its polymer as the dispersant, and an aqueous<br>
emulsion of a polymer as the dispersoid having an extremely small particle size is obtained<br>
by adding this dropwise to a polymerization reaction system and thereby carrying out<br>
emulsion polymerization.<br>
(4)	The aqueous emulsion according to the above-mentioned (3), wherein a<br>

polyvinyl alcohol-based resin is from 2 to 15% by mol.<br>
(5)	The aqueous emulsion according to the above-mentioned (3) or (4), wherein an<br>

(6)	The aqueous emulsion according to any one of the above-mentioned (3) to (5),<br>

(12)	A method for producing an aqueous emulsion, which comprises: obtaining a<br>
pre-emulsion by emulsifying and dispersing an ethylenically unsaturated monomer in<br>
water in the presence of a polyvinyl alcohol-based resin comprising a 1,2-diol structural<br>
unit represented by the general formula (1) and having a degree of saponification of from<br>
80 to 93% by mol; and adding the obtained pre-emulsion dropwise to an aqueous medium<br>
to carry out emulsion polymerization.<br>
Advantage of the Invention<br><br>
Since the aqueous emulsion of the invention is excellent in film-forming property,<br>
chemical stability and freezing stability, can produce a film having excellent transparency<br>
and shows excellent adhesiveness for wood and the like, it is markedly suitable for<br>
applications such as coating agent, adhesive and sensitive adhesive to various backing<br>
materials.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The explanation of composing elements described in the following is an example<br>
(typical example) of the embodiment of the invention and is not specified to these contents.<br>
The following describe the invention in detail.<br>
The aqueous emulsion of the invention comprises a PVA-based resin as the<br>
dispersant and a polymer comprising a structural unit derived from an ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer (to be referred simply to as "polymer of an ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer" hereinafter in some cases) as the dispersoid.<br>
The dispersoid of the aqueous emulsion of the invention is a polymer of an<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and for example, there may be mentioned a polymer<br>
comprising, as the main, a structural unit derived from a vinyl ester-based monomer, a<br>
diene-based monomer, an olefin-based monomer, an acrylamide-based monomer, an<br>
acrylonitrile-based monomer, a styrene-based monomer, a vinyl ether-based monomer or<br><br><br>
an allyl-based monomer. Particularly, it is desirable to use a polymer comprising a<br>
structural unit derived from an acrylic-based monomer from the viewpoint that the effect<br>
of then invention can be obtained to the maximum.<br>
As such an acrylic-based monomer, methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
n-propyl (meth)acrylate, i-propyl (meth)acrylate, n-butyl (meth)acrylate, i-butyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, t-butyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, dodecyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, octadecyl (meth)acrylate, (meth)acrylic acid and the like can be mentioned.<br><br>
In addition, though it is possible to use the above-mentioned acrylic-based<br>
monomers each independently, it is also a desirable embodiment to use two or more<br>
species by mixing them, or to use further jointly with other monomer such as a styrene-<br>
based monomer, with the aim of controlling glass transition and other characteristics of the<br>
obtained polymer.<br><br>
According to the emulsion of the invention, an average particle size of the<br>
dispersoid (namely, the above-mentioned polymer) is from 100 to 450 nm, which is<br>
markedly small in comparison with general emulsions, and that of particularly from 100 to<br>
350 nm, further from 100 to 200 nm, is preferably used. When this average particle size<br>
is too small, the viscosity becomes high in case that concentration of the emulsion is high,<br>
thus posing a tendency of lowering handling property. When too large on the contrary,<br>
there is a tendency that film-forming property of the emulsion is lowered or transparency<br>
of the obtained coating film is lowered.<br>
In this connection, the average particle size of dispersoid of this emulsion is<br>
obtained by adding 0.1 g of the emulsion dropwise to 50 g of water and applying a<br>
supersonic wave thereto for 5 minutes to prepare highly diluted and highly dispersed<br>
samples for evaluation use, and calculating average particle size at 23 Â°C using "NICOMP<br>
380" manufactured by Particle Sizing Systems by Volume-Wt NICOMP DISTRIBUTION<br>
mode.<br><br>
In addition, the aqueous emulsion of the invention is not only small in average<br>
particle size but also less in coarse particles, and its amount is generally from 0 to 0.5%,<br>
7<br><br>
particularly from 0 to 0.3% and further from 0 to 0.1 %. When amount of such coarse<br>
particles is too large, it is not desirable because there is a case in which film-forming<br>
property is reduced or coating property at the time use is spoiled.<br>
In this connection, such coarse particles mean solid matter remained on a nylon<br>
cloth when the aqueous emulsion is filtered using a 120 mesh nylon, and its amount is<br>
based on the weight of aqueous emulsion.<br><br>
The aqueous emulsion of the invention has another property in which an apparent<br>
grafting efficiency of the PVA-based resin is within the range of from 65 to 75%,<br>
particularly preferably from 68 to 75%, based on the dispersoid. According to the<br>
invention, while various stabilities generally have a tendency to lower when particle size of<br>
emulsion becomes small due to increase of the surface area, it is able to lower the lowering<br>
by the size of the apparent grafting efficiency of the dispersant, PVA-based resin, based on<br>
the dispersoid, namely strength of the protective colloidal ability.<br><br>
In this connection, such an apparent grafting efficiency is measured by the method<br>
described in the following.<br>
The aqueous emulsion is coated on a PET film using an applicator for 100 Âµm use<br>
and dried while allowing it to stand still for 24 hours under an atmosphere of 23 Â°C and<br>
50% RH, thereby preparing a film. About 1 g of this (a) is precisely weighed and soaked<br>
in methyl acetate of 50Â°C, hot water of 98Â°C, toluene of 98Â°C, hot water of 98Â°C and<br>
methyl ethyl ketone of 50Â°C, respectively, each for 6 hours, and its dry weight b (g) is<br>
calculated. In addition, the volatile matter content c (%) of the film before the test is<br>
separately measured, and using these values, the apparent grafting efficiency is calculated<br>
by the following formula.<br>
Apparent grafting efficiency (%) = [b/{a x (100 - c)/100}] x 100<br>
When this apparent grafting efficiency is too small, there is a tendency that<br>
various stabilities of the aqueous emulsion become insufficient because the protective<br>
colloidal ability by the PVA-based resin becomes insufficient. In addition, it is difficult<br>
that the apparent grafting efficiency exceeds 75%, and when such a value becomes too<br>
large, the polymerization stability is lowered depending on the kind of the acrylic-based<br><br><br>
monomer, so that there is a tendency that a stable aqueous emulsion becomes unable to<br>
obtain.<br><br>
In addition, solid matter concentration of the aqueous emulsion of the invention is<br>
generally from 10 to 60%, and particularly those having solid matter concentration of from<br>
38 to 52% is suitably used. When the solid content is too low, the emulsion particles are<br>
apt to precipitate so that there is a tendency that the preservation stability becomes low or<br>
the freezing stability becomes low, when it is too high on the contrary, there is a tendency<br>
that the workability is inhibited.<br>
In this connection, this solid matter concentration of the aqueous emulsion means<br>
the residue when the aqueous emulsion is dried at 105Â°C for 3 hours.<br>
The emulsion of the invention is excellent in film-forming property, and this is<br>
evident from the fact that the difference between glass transition point (Tg) of the polymer<br>
of ethylenically unsaturated monomer in the aqueous emulsion and minimum film-forming<br>
temperature (MFT) of the aqueous emulsion, (Tg - MFT), is large. The value of Tg -<br>
MFT in the aqueous emulsion of the invention is generally 4Â°C or more, and particularly<br>
those having The value of Tg - MFT of from 6 to 10Â°C is suitably used.<br>
In this connection, this minimum film-forming temperature (MFT) of the aqueous<br>
emulsion represents a minimum temperature at which emulsion particles are fused to form<br>
a continued film when the emulsion is coated on a base material or the like, and greatly<br>
undergoes influence of the polymer composition in the emulsion, namely Tg of the<br>
polymer and affinity with the dispersion medium, but is generally 40Â°C or less, and<br>
particularly those having the MFT of from -20 to 40Â°C, especially those having the MFT<br>
of from 0 to 30Â°C are suitably used.<br>
Glass transition point (Tg) of the polymer of ethylenically unsaturated monomer is<br>
generally 110Â°C or less, and those having the Tg of from 0 to 40Â°C are suitably used.<br>
According to the invention, it is considered that the minimum film-forming<br>
temperature is lowered because of the crowding of particles due to increase of capillary<br>
pressure among particles caused by the small particle size of emulsion and because the<br>
PVA-based resin comprising a specified structure to be used in the invention acts as a film-<br>
forming supplementary agent, and its difference in temperature from the TG becomes large<br>
as a result.<br><br><br>
Next, method for producing the emulsion of the invention is described.<br>
The method for producing the emulsion of the invention is not particularly limited,<br>
but there may be mentioned a method in which a monomer is subjected to emulsion<br>
polymerization in an aqueous medium, a method in which a polymer is emulsified and<br>
dispersed in water, and the like, preferred of which is an emulsion polymerization by a pre-<br>
emulsion method in which a pre-emulsion obtained by emulsifying and dispersing a<br>
monomer in water in the presence of a PVA-based resin, a surfactant or the like is<br>
polymerized while adding it dropwise to a polymerization reaction system, and a pre-<br>
emulsion method which uses, as such a dispersant, a PVA-based resin comprising a 1,2-<br>
diol structural unit represented by the following general formula (1) and having a degree of<br>
saponification of from 80 to 93% by mol is particularly preferably used.<br>
Such a PVA-based resin is excellent in its affinity for both of the ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomer and its polymer and firstly acts as a dispersant in preparing a pre-<br>
emulsion by minutely dispersing such a monomer in water, and an emulsion which<br>
comprises a polymer comprising extremely small particle size as the dispersoid can be<br>
obtained by adding such a pre-emulsion dropwise to a reaction system that contains a<br>
polymerization initiator and is set to a reaction temperature, and thereby carrying out<br>
emulsion polymerization.<br>
In addition, generally in an emulsion obtained by the pre-emulsion method,<br>
grafting efficiency of the PVA-based resin used as the dispersant is apt to lower due to<br>
reduced particle size, but since the PVA-based resin to be used in the invention has high<br>
grafting capacity, a high grafting efficiency can be obtained and an emulsion having high<br>
stabilities can be obtained.<br><br>
The following illustratively describes on the production method by the pre-<br>
emulsion method which uses, as the dispersant, such a PVA resin comprising a 1,2-diol<br>
structural unit represented by the general formula (1).<br>
The PVA-based resin to be used in such a pre-emulsion method has a structural<br>
unit represented by the following formula (1), and in the general formula (1), R1, R2 and R3<br>
each independently represent a hydrogen atom or an organic group, X represents a single<br>
bond or a bonding chain, and R4, R5 and R6 each independently represent a hydrogen atom<br>
or an organic group.<br><br><br><br>
It is desirable that all of the R1 to R3 and R4 to R6 in the 1,2-diol structural unit<br>
represented by the general formula (1) are hydrogen atoms, and a PVA-based resin<br>
comprising a structural unit represented by the following general formula (1') is suitably<br>
used.<br>
Â£0032?<br><br>
In this connection, the R1 to R3 and R4 to R6 in the structural unit represented by<br>
the general formula (1) may be an organic group with the proviso that it is in such an<br>
amount that it does not sharply spoil characteristics of the resin, and the organic group is<br>
not particularly limited, but for example, alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms<br>
such as methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, isopropyl group, n-butyl group,<br>
isobutyl group and tert-butyl group are desirable, and, as occasion demands, the organic<br><br>
group may have a substituent group such as a halogen group, a hydroxyl group, an ester<br>
group, a carbonate group, a sulfonate group and the like.<br>
In addition, X in the 1,2-diol structural unit represented by the general formula (1)<br>
is typically a single bond, and single bond is most desirable from the viewpoint of thermal<br>
stability and of structural stability under high temperature/under acidic condition, but it<br>
may be a bonding chain with the proviso that it is within such a range that it does not spoil<br>
the effect of the invention, and such a bonding chain is not particularly limited and there<br>
may be mentioned hydrocarbons such as alkylene, alkenylene, alkynylene, phenylene and<br>
naphthylene (these hydrocarbons may be substituted with halogens such as fluorine,<br>
chlorine or bromine, and the like), as well as -O-, -(CH2O)m-, -(OCH2)m-, -<br>
(CH2O)mCH2-, -CO-, -COCO-, -CO(CH2)mCO-, -CO(C6H4)CO-, -S-, -CS-, -SO-, -<br>
SO2- -NR-, -CONR-, -NRCO-, -CSNR-, -NRCS-, -NRNR-, -HPO4-, -Si(OR)2- -<br>
OSi(OR)2- -OSi(OR)2O-, -Ti(OR)2- -OTi(OR)2- -OTi(OR)2O-, -Al(OR)-, -<br>
OAl(OR)-, -OAl(OR)O- and the like (R is each independently an optional substituent<br>
group of which a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group is desirable, and m is a natural number).<br>
Particularly, an alkylene group having 6 or less carbon atoms, particularly methylene<br>
group, or -CH2OCH2- is desirable from the viewpoint of stability at the time of production<br>
or at the time of application.<br>
Though the production method of the PVA-based resin to be used in the invention<br>
is not particularly limited, (i) a method in which a copolymer of a vinyl ester-based<br>
monomer and a compound represented by the following general formula (2) is subjected to<br>
saponification, (ii) a method in which a copolymer of a vinyl ester-based monomer and a<br>
compound represented by the following general formula (3) is subjected to saponification<br>
and decarboxylation and (iii) a method in which a copolymer of a vinyl ester-based<br>
monomer and a compound represented by the following general formula (4) is subjected to<br>
saponification and deketalization are suitably used.<br>
[Chem. 5]<br>
12<br><br><br><br>
In the above-mentioned general formulae (2), (3) and (4), all of R1, R2, R3, X, R4,<br>
R5 and R6 are the same as the case of the general formula (1). Each of R7 and R8 is<br>
independently a hydrogen atom or R9-CO- (in the formula, R9 is an alkyl group). Each of<br>
R10 and R11 is independently a hydrogen atom or an organic group.<br>
Regarding the methods of (i), (ii) and (iii), for example, the methods described in<br>
JP-A-2006-95825 can be employed.<br>
Particularly, from the viewpoint of being excellent in copolymerization reactivity<br>
and industrial handling ability, it is desirable to use, as the compound represented by the<br>
general formula (2) in the method of (i), a 3,4-diacyloxy-l-butene wherein R1 to R are<br>
hydrogen, X is a single bond, R7 and R8 are R9-CO- and R9 is an alkyl group, and further<br>
among them, 3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene wherein R9 is methyl group is particularly suitably<br>
used.<br>
In this connection, the reactivity ratio of each monomer when vinyl acetate is used<br>
as the vinyl ester-based monomer and this is copolymerized with 3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene is<br>
r (vinyl acetate) = 0.710 and r (3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene) = 0.701, and this shows that 3,4-<br>
diacetoxy-l-butene is excellent in its copolymerization reactivity with vinyl acetate, in<br>
comparison with the case of vinyl ethylene carbonate as the compound represented by the<br>
general formula (3) used in the method of (ii), namely r (vinyl acetate) = 0.85 and r (vinyl<br>
ethylene carbonate) = 5.4.<br>
[0040]<br>
In addition, chain transfer constant of 3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene is C x (3,4-<br>
diacetoxy-l-butene) = 0.003 (65Â°C), and this shows that it does not cause a difficulty in<br>
increasing degree of polymerization and a lowering of rate of polymerization, in<br>
comparison with the C x (vinyl ethylene carbonate) = 0.005 (65Â°C) in the case of vinyl<br>
ethylene carbonate and the C x (2,2-dimethyl-4-vinyl-1,3-dioxolan) = 0.023 (65Â°C) in the<br>
case of 2,2-dimethyl-4-vinyl-1,3-dioxolan which is the compound represented by the<br>
general formula (4) to be used in the method of (iii).<br><br>
In addition, since the by-product which is generated when a copolymer of this 3,4-<br>
diacetoxy-l-butene is saponified is the same compound by-produced at the time of<br>
saponification from a structural unit derived from vinyl acetate frequently used as a vinyl<br>
ester-based monomer, it is not necessary to arrange a special device or process to its after<br><br><br>
treatment and solvent recovery system, so that a point that the existing facilities can be<br>
used is also an industrially considerable advantage.<br><br>
In this connection, regarding the above-mentioned 3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene, it is<br>
able to obtain a product produced, for example, by the synthesis route described in WO<br>
00/24702 which uses 1,3-butadiene as the starting substance and a product produced using<br>
an epoxybutene derivative as an intermediate, by the techniques described in US Patent<br>
5623086 and US Patent 6072079, and the products of Acros at the reagent level can be<br>
obtained respectively from the market. Also, the 3,4-diacetoxy-1 -butene obtained as a<br>
by-product during the 1,4-butanediol production process can also be used by purifying it.<br>
Also, the 1,4-diacetoxy-l-butene as an intermediate product during the 1,4-<br>
butanediol production process can also be used by converting it into 3,4-diacetoxy-l-<br>
butene by carrying out a conventionally known isomerization reaction using metallic<br>
catalyst such as palladium chloride. In addition, it is also possible to produce it in<br>
accordance with the organic diester production method described in republished WO<br>
00/24702.<br><br>
In this connection, in the case of the PVA-based resin obtained by the method of<br>
(ii) or (iii), carbonate ring or acetal ring sometimes remains on the side chain when the<br>
degree of saponification is low or decarboxylation or deacetalization is insufficient, and as<br>
a result, there is a tendency that amount of coarse particles in the aqueous emulsion<br>
prepared using such a PVA-based resin as the dispersant is increased, so that the PVA-<br>
based resin obtained by the method of (i) is most suitable for this application from these<br>
points of view.<br>
As the above-mentioned vinyl ester-based monomer, there may be mentioned<br>
vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl valerate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl<br>
isobutyrate, vinyl pivalate, vinyl caprate, vinyl laurate, vinyl stearate, vinyl benzoate, vinyl<br>
versatate and the like, of which vinyl acetate is preferably used from the economical point<br>
of view.<br>
Also, in addition to the above-mentioned monomers (compounds represented by<br>
the general formulae (2), (3) and (4)), as copolymerization components, compounds<br>
including: a-olefins such as ethylene and propylene; hydroxyl group-containing Î±-olefins<br><br><br>
such as 3-buten-l-ol, 4-penten-l-ol and 5-hexene-1,2-diol, and derivatives thereof such as<br>
acylation products; unsaturated acids such as itaconic acid, maleic acid and acrylic acid or<br>
alts or mono or dialkyl esters thereof; nitriles such as acrylonitrile, amides such as<br>
methacrylamide and diacetoneacrylamide, olefinsulfonic acid such as ethylenesulfonic<br>
acid, allylsulfonic acid, metharylsulfonic acid and AMPS and salts thereof and the like<br>
may be copolymerized within such a range that they do not exert sharp influences on the<br>
resin physical properties.<br><br>
Degree of saponification of the PVA-based resin to be used in the invention<br>
(measured in accordance with JIS K 6726) is preferably from 80 to 93% by mol,<br>
particularly preferably from 85 to 90% by mol. When such a degree of saponification is<br>
too low, there will be a case in which insoluble matter of the PVA-based resin is<br>
precipitated during the polymerization caused by a clouding point phenomenon and<br>
inhibits polymerization, and when it is too high on the contrary, there is a tendency that the<br>
pre-emulsion monomer liquid becomes unstable.<br><br>
In general, since emulsion polymerization is carried out at a temperature of from<br>
70 to 80Â°C, as the PVA-based resin to be used as the dispersant in this, a substance having<br>
a clouding point of 80Â°C or more is used, and a substance of 90Â°C or more is particularly<br>
preferably used. When such a clouding point is too low, here will be a case in which the<br>
PVA-based resin is precipitated during the polymerization in the same way as described in<br>
the above and the emulsion aggregates thereby.<br>
However, though it is not desirable from the productivity point of view, it is also<br>
possible to use a PVA-based resin having a clouding point of less than 80Â°C in case that<br>
the emulsion polymerization is carried out at a further low temperature with the aim of<br>
achieving high degree of polymerization.<br>
In this connection, regarding such a clouding point of the PVA-based resin, a<br>
PVA-based resin aqueous solution having a solid matter concentration of 0.1% is adjusted<br>
to a temperature of 23 Â°C, temperature rising of this is carried out at a rate of lÂ°C/min, and<br>
the temperature when its absorbance at 430 nm exceeded 0.1 is used as the clouding point.<br><br>
In addition, average degree of polymerization of the PVA-based resin (measured<br>
in accordance with JIS K 6726) to be used preferably is generally from 50 to 4000,<br><br><br>
particularly from 100 to 2000, further from 200 to 800. When such an average degree of<br>
polymerization is too low, the protective colloidal ability cannot be obtained, and when it<br>
is too high on the contrary, viscosity of the obtained emulsion becomes so high that it<br>
sometimes becomes difficult to carry out the polymerization because agitation cannot be<br>
carried out during the polymerization.<br><br>
A content of 1,2-diol structural unit contained in the PVA-based resin is generally<br>
from 2 to 15% by mol, particularly from 3 to 12% by mol, further preferably from 4 to<br>
10% by mol. When such a content is too small, there is a tendency that an emulsion<br>
having stable grafting performance of the PVA-based resin for acrylic resin cannot easily<br>
be obtained, and when it is too large on the contrary, hydrophilic property of PVA<br>
becomes too high or average chain length of the residual acetic acid ester group becomes<br>
short, so that there is a tendency in that the pre-emulsion becomes unstable due to lowering<br>
of the adsorption performance for the acrylic-based monomer.<br><br>
In this connection, the content of 1,2-diol structural unit in the PVA-based resin<br>
can be calculated from the 'H-NMR spectrum (solvent: DMSO-d6, internal standard:<br>
tetramethylsilane) of completely saponified PVA-based resin, and illustratively, it may be<br>
calculated from peak areas derived from hydroxyl group proton, methine proton and<br>
methylene proton in the 1,2-diol unit, methylene proton of the main chain, proton of<br>
hydroxyl group connecting to the main chain and the like.<br>
Next, a method is described on the production of a pre-emulsion in which an<br>
ethylenically unsaturated monomer is dispersed in water using, as the dispersant, a PVA-<br>
based resin comprising a 1,2-diol structural unit represented by the above-mentioned<br>
general formula (1).<br>
As the using amount of the PVA-based resin which is used as the dispersant in the<br>
pre-emulsion, it varies to some extent depending on its kinds, resin content of the emulsion<br>
and the like, within the range of generally from 0.1 to 100 parts by weight, particularly<br>
from 1 to 50 parts by weight, further from 3 to 10 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by<br>
weight of the dispersoid, is preferably used. When this using amount of the PVA-based<br>
resin is too large, there is a tendency of lowering water resistance of film obtained from the<br><br><br>
aqueous emulsion, and when it is too small, there is a tendency of being not able to obtain<br>
a proper pre-emulsion because of the lowering of dispersion stability of the monomer,<br>
which is not desirable.<br>
As the production method of such a pre-emulsion, for example, there may be<br>
mentioned a method in which an ethylenically unsaturated monomer is added dropwise to<br>
an aqueous solution of the above-described PVA-based resin while agitating the latter.<br>
As the agitator in that case, agitating and mixing by agitator blade, similar to the one which<br>
is used at the time of emulsion polymerization, and conventionally known dispersing<br>
machines such as static mixer, vibromixer and homogenizer can be used, of which the<br>
agitating and mixing by agitator blade is suitable.<br><br>
The thus obtained pre-emulsion comprising the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer is subjected to emulsion polymerization by adding it dropwise to a reaction<br>
liquid comprising a polymerization initiator and water, in a reaction container equipped<br>
with an agitator and a reflux condenser.<br><br>
As the polymerization initiator, in general, common potassium persulfate,<br>
ammonium persulfate, potassium bromate and the like are used each independently or<br>
concomitantly with acidic sodium sulfite, further, water-soluble redox system<br>
polymerization initiators such as hydrogen peroxide-tartaric acid, hydrogen peroxide-iron<br>
salt, hydrogen peroxide-ascorbic acid-iron salt, hydrogen peroxide-rongalit or hydrogen<br>
peroxide-rongalit-iron salt are used, and illustratively, catalyst consisting of an organic<br>
peroxide and a redox system such as "Kayabutyl B" manufactured by Kayaku Akuzo Co.,<br>
Ltd., or "Kayabutyl A-50C" manufactured by the same company can also be used.<br>
Particularly, ammonium persulfate is suitably used from the polymerization stability point<br>
of view.<br>
Adding method of the polymerization initiator is not particularly limited, and a<br>
method for adding it in one lot at an early stage, a method for adding it continuously with<br>
the progress of polymerization, and the like can be employed.<br>
Using amount of such a polymerization initiator cannot be said in a wholesale<br>
manner because it depends on the kind of the monomer to be used, polymerization<br><br><br>
conditions and the like, but it is suitably used within the range of generally from 0.01 to 1<br>
part by weight, particularly from 0.01 to 0.5 part by weight, based on 100 parts by weight<br>
of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer.<br>
In addition, the temperature to be suitably employed at the time of polymerization<br>
reaction is within the range of generally from 40 to 90Â°C, particularly from 60 to 80Â°C.<br><br>
Dropping rate of the pre-emulsion to the reaction liquid cannot be said in a<br>
wholesale manner because it depends on the reactivity of the ethylenically unsaturated<br>
monomer to be used, using amount of the polymerization initiator, reaction temperature<br>
and the like, so that it may be optionally decided by observing conditions of the<br>
temperature of reaction liquid by heat of polymerization, and the like.<br>
In this connection, it is possible that a part of the pre-emulsion, for example from<br>
5 to 20% of the total amount, is put into the reaction liquid in advance, and the remaining<br>
pre-emulsion is added dropwise thereto in response to the progress of polymerization. In<br>
addition, it is also a desirable embodiment to arrange an aging stage for a certain period of<br>
time after dropping entire volume of the pre-emulsion.<br><br>
It is desirable that the emulsion of the invention uses a PVA-based resin alone as<br>
the dispersant, but can further use another water-soluble polymer, a nonionic surfactant or<br>
an anionic surfactant jointly therewith.<br>
In this connection, when other dispersant is jointly used, it is desirable that the<br>
content of the PVA-based resin is generally 70% by weight or more, particularly 80% by<br>
weight or more, further 90% by weight or more.<br>
As the water-soluble polymer which can be jointly used other than the above-<br>
mentioned PVA-based resin, there may be mentioned unmodified PVA, carboxyl group-<br>
containing PVA, formalized, acetalized, butyralized or urethanated PVA, PVA of an<br>
esterificated product and the like with sulfonic acid, carboxylic acid or the like and<br>
acetoacetylated PVA, diacetoneacrylamide-modified PVA, PVA with Thiol end group,<br>
PVA in which amount of the main chain 1,2-glycol bond obtained by high temperature<br>
high pressure polymerization is 1.8% by mol or more, ethylene oxide-modified PVA, a<br>
saponification product of copolymer of a vinyl ester with a monomer copolymerizable<br>
therewith, and the like. As the monomer copolymerizable with a vinyl ester, there may be<br>
mentioned olefins such as ethylene, butylene, isobutylene, a-octene, a-dodecene and a-<br><br><br>
octadecene, unsaturated acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic<br>
acid, maleic anhydride or itaconic acid or salts or mono- or dialkyl esters thereof, nitriles<br>
such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, amides such as acrylamide,<br>
diacetoneacrylamide and methacrylamide, olefinsulfonic acids such as ethylenesulfonic<br>
acid, allylsulfonic acid and methacrylsulfonic or salts thereof, alkyl vinyl esters, vinyl<br>
ketone, N-vinylpyrrolidone, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride and the like. Particularly<br>
when ethylene is copolymerized, a range of from 0.1 to 19% by mol is desirable.<br>
In addition, as the above-mentioned water-soluble polymer other than PVA, there<br>
may be mentioned cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxybutylmethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aminomethylhydroxypropyl cellulose<br>
and aminoethylhydroxy-propyl cellulose, starch, tragacanth, pectin, glue, alginic acid or a<br>
salt thereof, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylic acid or a salt thereof,<br>
polymethacrylic acid or a salt thereof, polyacrylamide, polymethacrylamide, a copolymer<br>
of vinyl acetate with unsaturated acid such as maleic acid, maleic anhydride, acrylic acid,<br>
acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid or crotonic acid, a copolymer of<br>
styrene with the above-mentioned unsaturated acid, a copolymer of a vinyl ether with the<br>
above-mentioned unsaturated acid and salts or esters of the above-mentioned copolymers.<br>
As the nonionic surfactant, for example, a polyoxyethylene-alkyl ether type, a<br>
polyoxyethylene-alkylphenol type, a polyoxyethylene-polyhydric alcohol ester type, an<br>
ester of a polyhydric alcohol with a fatty acid, an oxyethyleneoxypropylene block polymer<br>
and the like can be mentioned.<br>
As the anionic surfactant, for example, a higher alcohol sulfate, a higher fatty acid<br>
alkali salt, a polyoxyethylene alkylphenol ether sulfate, an alkyl-benzene sulfonate,<br>
naphthalene sulfonate/formalin condensate, an alkyldiphenyl ether sulfonate, a dialkyl-<br>
sulfosuccinate, a higher alcohol phosphoric acid ester salt and the like can be mentioned.<br>
Further, plasticizers such as a phthalic acid ester and a phosphoric acid ester, pH<br>
adjusting agents such as sodium carbonate, sodium acetate and sodium phosphate, and the<br>
like can also be used concomitantly.<br><br><br>
In addition, chain transfer agents such as an iron compound and methanol may<br>
also be used concomitantly as an auxiliary for controlling polymerization reactivity.<br>
In response to its applications, using purposes and the like, the thus obtained<br>
aqueous emulsion of the invention can be mixed optionally with additive agents<br>
corresponding to respective applications such as a pigment, a dispersant, an antifoamer, an<br>
oil solution, a viscosity modifier, a tackifier, a thickener, a water-holding agent, a fiber-<br>
softening agent, a smoothing agent or an antistatic agent.<br>
In addition, it is possible to make the aqueous emulsion of the invention into a<br>
powder emulsion by spray-<br>
drying this, and in that case, it is desirable to post-add a PVA-based resin, particularly an<br>
ethylene-modified PVA, a partially saponified PVA or the like, with the aim of improving<br>
powdering and redispersibility.<br>
In addition, it is possible to sharply improve water whitening resistance of the film<br>
of the aqueous emulsion of the invention, by effecting crosslinking of the PVA-based resin<br>
in the dry film through the concomitant use of a crosslinking agent.<br>
It is considered that a continuous phase of PVA-based resin is present in the dry<br>
film of aqueous emulsion obtained using the PVA-based resin as the dispersant, and when<br>
such a film contacts with water, the PVA-based resin swells to a size of the range of visible<br>
ray or is eluted to generate voids, thereby generating a difference in refractive index from<br>
the phase consisting of dispersoid to cause the whitening.<br>
In the aqueous emulsion of the invention, such a whitening of dry film by water is<br>
improved by forming minute continuous phase of the PVA-based resin through reduction<br>
of particle size of the dispersoid, but further improvement may be achieved by carrying out<br>
crosslinking of the PVA-based resin and thereby inhibiting the swelling and elution caused<br>
by water.<br><br>
As the crosslinking agent to be used in the aqueous emulsion of the invention,<br>
those which are conventionally known as crosslinking agents of PVA-based resins can be<br>
used, and illustratively, there may be mentioned a methylol compound and a silicone<br>
compound, which undergo condensation reaction with the hydroxyl group in PVA-based<br>
resins, an aldehyde compound which undergoes acetalization reaction, an epoxy compound<br><br><br>
which forms ether bond, inorganic based compound which forms a chelate such as and<br>
zirconium, titanium, aluminum or boron.<br>
Particularly, a methylol compound and a zirconium compound which are excellent<br>
in crosslinking reactivity at low temperature are suitable.<br>
As such a methylol compound, methylolmelamine, methylolurea,<br>
methylolbisphenol S and the like can be mentioned, of which methylolmelamine is<br>
particularly suitably used.<br>
In addition, as the zirconium compound, zirconium chloride, zirconium acetate,<br>
zirconyl acetate, zirconium nitrate, zirconyl nitrate, zirconium sulfate, zirconyl sulfate,<br>
zirconium acetylacetonate, ammonium zirconium carbonate, potassium zirconium<br>
carbonate, zirconyl octylate, zirconium oxychloride, zirconium hydroxychloride, zirconyl<br>
hydroxychloride and the like can be mentioned.<br>
Also, when a methylol compound is used as a cross-linking agent, the crosslinking<br>
reaction progresses further effectively within an acidic area, particularly at pH 3 or less.<br>
In this connection, in the case of the aqueous emulsion obtained using potassium persulfate<br>
or ammonium persulfate as the polymerization initiator at the time of emulsion<br>
polymerization, the system becomes acidic after the polymerization so that it is not<br>
necessary to particularly carry out pH adjustment.<br><br>
In addition, in the case of zirconium carbonate and potassium zirconium<br>
carbonate, the crosslinking reaction is effectively generated in neutral to alkaline range, so<br>
that these can be suitably used as crosslinking agents for those which used a redox system<br>
polymerization initiator from which an aqueous emulsion of such a pH range can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Though blending amount of such a crosslinking agent cannot be said in a<br>
wholesale manner because it depends on its purpose, it is suitably used within the range of<br>
generally from 0.1 to 150 parts by weight, particularly from 1 to 100 parts by weight,<br>
further from 5 to 50 parts by weight, especially from 10 to 30 parts by weight, based on<br>
100 parts by weight of the PVA-based resin. When blending amount of such a<br>
crosslinking agent is too small, there may be a case in which sufficient water whitening<br><br><br>
resistance cannot be obtained, and when it is too large on the contrary, there may be a<br>
tendency in that stability of the aqueous emulsion is lowered and its viscosity is increased.<br>
Examples<br>
The following describes the invention with reference to examples, but the<br>
invention is not restricted by the descriptions of the examples without exceeding its gist.<br>
In this connection, the "part" and "%" in the examples mean weight basis unless<br>
otherwise noted.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
[Production of PVA-based resin]<br>
Firstly, 1500 parts of vinyl acetate, 174 parts (6% by mol, based on adding vinyl<br>
acetate) of 3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene, 300 parts of methanol and 0.2% by mol (based on<br>
adding vinyl acetate) of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) were prepared.<br>
Subsequently, whole amounts of the methanol and AIBN and 20% portions of the<br>
vinyl acetate and 3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene were added to a reaction container equipped with<br>
a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel and an agitator, and polymerization was started by<br>
increasing temperature under a stream of nitrogen while stirring. The remaining portions<br>
(80% for each) of vinyl acetate and 3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene were added dropwise thereto<br>
spending 7 hours, the polymerization was completed by adding a predetermined amount of<br>
m-dinitrobenzene when rate of polymerization of vinyl acetate reached 90%, and then a<br>
methanol solution of copolymer was obtained by removing unreacted vinyl acetate<br>
monomer from the system through distillation while blowing methanol steam through the<br>
system.<br>
Next, the above-mentioned solution was adjusted to a concentration of 40% and<br>
put into a kneader, and while keeping the solution temperature at 40Â°C, saponification was<br>
carried out by adding a 2% methanol solution of sodium hydroxide at a ratio of 3.8 mmol<br>
based on 1 mol in total amount of the vinyl acetate structural unit and 3,4-diacetoxy-l-<br>
butene structural unit in the copolymer. When the saponified product was precipitated<br>
and became particulate matter with the progress of saponification, acetic acid for<br>
neutralization use was added in an amount of 5 equivalents of sodium hydroxide, and the<br>
particulate was separated by filtration, thoroughly washed with methanol and then dried in<br><br><br>
a hot air drier to obtain a PVA-based resin comprising the 1,2-diol structural unit<br>
represented by the aforementioned formula (1').<br>
Degree of saponification of the thus obtained PVA-based resin was 89% by mol<br>
when analysis was carried out based on the amount of alkali consumption required for<br>
hydrolyzing the residual vinyl acetate and 3,4-diacetoxy-butene, and average degree of<br>
polymerization was 500 when analysis was carried out in accordance with JIS K 6726. In<br>
addition, the content of the 1,2-diol structural unit was 6% by mol when calculated by<br>
measuring it by JH-NMR (internal standard substance; tetramethylsilane). In this<br>
connection, clouding point of this PVA-based resin was 90Â°C or more.<br>
[Preparation of pre-emulsion]<br>
Using this PVA-based resin as the dispersant, 216 parts of methyl methacrylate<br>
and 177 parts of n-butyl acrylate were added dropwise to a reaction container charged with<br>
9.2 parts of this PVA-based resin and 317 parts of water spending 30 minutes while<br>
agitating at 300 rpm to effect their mixing and dispersion, and then the agitation was<br>
continued for 30 minutes to prepare a pre-emulsion.<br>
[Emulsion polymerization]<br>
A separable flask equipped with a puddle-type mixing blade, a reflux condenser, a<br>
dropping funnel and a thermometer was charged with 635 parts of water, 18.3 parts of the<br>
PVA-based resin and 71.9 parts, namely 1/10, of the pre-emulsion prepared in advance,<br>
and temperature in the flask was increased to 75Â°C while agitating at an agitation rate of<br>
230 rpm.<br>
After carrying out 1 hour of initial polymerization by adding 8.4 parts of a 5%<br>
aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate, 647.1 parts, as 9/10, of the pre-emulsion was<br>
added dropwise thereto spending 3.5 hours. Thereafter, this was subjected to 90 minutes<br>
of aging and then cooled to ordinary temperature to obtain an emulsion. In this<br>
connection, 2.4 parts for each of the 5% aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate was<br>
added 7 times in total at 30 minute intervals after commencement of the dropwise addition<br>
of pre-emulsion, and 1.4 parts for each of the 5% aqueous solution of ammonium<br>
persulfate was added 2 times in total at 45 minute intervals during the 90 minutes of aging<br>
step.<br><br><br><br>
Average particle size, apparent grafting efficiency, glass transition point (Tg) and<br>
minimum film-forming temperature (MFT) of the aqueous emulsion obtained in the above<br>
were measured in the following manner.<br>
(Average particle size)<br>
A highly diluted and highly dispersed sample for evaluation use was prepared by<br>
adding 0.1 g of the thus obtained aqueous emulsion dropwise to 50 g of water and applying<br>
a supersonic wave thereto for 5 minutes. Particle sizes of the emulsion in this sample at<br>
23Â°C were measured using "NICOMP 380" manufactured by Particle Sizing Systems, and<br>
average particle diameter by Volume-Wt NICOMP DISTRIBUTION mode was calculated.<br><br>
(Apparent grafting efficiency)<br>
The aqueous emulsion was coated on a PET film using an applicator for 100 Âµm<br>
use and dried while allowing it to stand still for 24 hours under an atmosphere of 23 Â°C and<br>
50% RH, thereby preparing a film. About 1 g of this (a) was precisely weighed and<br>
soaked in methyl acetate of 50Â°C, hot water of 98Â°C, toluene of 98Â°C, hot water of 98Â°C<br>
and methyl ethyl ketone of 50Â°C, respectively, each for 6 hours, and its dry weight b (g)<br>
was calculated. In addition, the volatile matter content c (%) of the film before the test<br>
was separately measured, and using these values, the apparent grafting efficiency was<br>
calculated by the following formula.<br>
Apparent grafting efficiency (%) = [b/{a X (100 - c)/100}] X 100<br>
(Glass transition point)<br>
A cast film prepared at ordinary temperature was subjected to vacuum drying, the<br>
thus obtained sample was treated by DSC (Thermal analysis mfd. by Perkin-Elmer) and<br>
glass transition point (Tg) of the second run obtained within a temperature range of<br>
from -20Â°C to 150Â°C and at a programming rate of 10Â°C/min was calculated.<br><br>
(Minimum film-forming temperature)<br>
Using a film forming temperature measuring device manufactured by Yoshimitsu<br>
Seiki, the aqueous emulsion was coated using a 100 Âµm coater on an evaluation plate<br>
having a temperature gradient within the range of from -5 to 40Â°C, and after allowing it to<br>
stand still for 12 hours, forming condition of the film was observed with the naked eye and<br><br><br>
the temperature of the boundary where a transparent film was formed was read and<br>
regarded as minimum film-forming temperature (MFT).<br><br>
Next, the following evaluations were carried out on the thus obtained aqueous<br>
emulsions. The results are shown in Tables 2 to 5.<br>
(Chemical stability)<br>
Each aqueous emulsion was diluted with water to a solid mater concentration of<br>
1%, a 10 g portion thereof was mixed with 0.5 g of magnesium sulfate and stirred with the<br>
hand and then the conditions were observed with the naked eye for 30 minutes and<br>
evaluated as follows.<br>
A â no change<br>
B â precipitation of aggregates<br><br>
(Freezing stability)<br>
A 50 g portion of each aqueous emulsion was put into a 100 ml capacity poly<br>
vessel and the emulsion was frozen by allowing it to stand for 16 hours in a refrigerator of<br>
-5Â°C. Thereafter, the emulsion was defrosted by allowing it to stand for 6 hours in a<br>
constant temperature bath of 20Â°C. By repeating this three times, its condition was<br>
observed and evaluated as follows.<br>
A â stable<br>
B â¢â¢â¢ aggregation<br>
(Adhesive strength)<br>
Tension shear type single lap shear strength test specimens were prepared using<br>
monarch birch (average specific gravity 0.7, moisture content 9%) as the wood sample,<br>
coating each aqueous emulsion on its surface to a thickness of 300 g/m2, uniting the coated<br>
faces and carrying out compression adhesion at 1 MPa for 24 hours. After humidification<br>
under a condition of 23Â°C and 50% RH for 1 week or more, a tensile test was carried out at<br>
a test speed of 10 mm/min using TENSILON STM-F1000P manufactured by TOYO<br>
BALDWIN Co., Ltd., and ratio of destruction of not the adhered side but the wood sample<br>
part among 8 test specimens (wood destruction ratio) was calculated.<br><br>
(Film transparency)<br>
26<br><br>
A film was prepared by coating each aqueous emulsion on a PET film to a film<br>
thickness of from 60 to 80 Âµm and allowed to stand under an environment of 23 Â°C and<br>
50% RH for 2 days. Transparency of this film was measured in accordance with JIS K<br>
7105 using a haze meter ("Haze Meter NDH 2000" mfd. by NIPPON DENSHOKU Co.,<br>
Ltd.), and the haze value based on a film thickness of 10 urn was calculated.<br><br>
(Water whitening resistance)<br>
After soaking the film used in the evaluation of film transparency in water of 23 Â°C<br>
for 3 hours, its transparency was measured in accordance with JIS K 7105 using a haze<br>
meter ("Haze Meter NDH 2000" mfd. by NIPPON DENSHOKU Co., Ltd.), and the haze<br>
value based on a film thickness of 10 urn was calculated.<br>
Further, 20 parts by weight of methylolmelamine was added to each aqueous<br>
emulsion, based on 100 parts by weight of the PVA-based resin in the emulsion, this was<br>
coated on a PET film to a film thickness of from 60 to 80 Âµm and allowed to stand under<br>
an environment of 23 Â°C and 50% RH for 3 days, and the crosslinked film obtained in this<br>
manner was also subjected to the same evaluation.<br><br>

parts of n-butyl acrylate dropwise to a reaction container charged with 23.3 parts of the<br>
same PVA-based resin of Example 1 and 317 parts of water spending 30 minutes while<br>
agitating at 300 rpm to effect their mixing and dispersion, and then continuing the agitation<br>
for 30 minutes.<br>
[Emulsion polymerization]<br>
A separable flask equipped with a puddle-type mixing blade, a reflux condenser, a<br>
dropping funnel and a thermometer was charged with 635 parts of water, 46.7 parts of the<br>
PVA-based resin and 69.1 parts, namely 1/10, of the pre-emulsion prepared in advance,<br>
and temperature in the flask was increased to 75 Â°C while agitating at an agitation rate of<br>

After carrying out 1 hour of initial polymerization by adding 8.4 parts of a 5%<br>
aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate, 621.1 parts, as 9/10, of the pre-emulsion was<br>
added dropwise thereto spending 3.5 hours. Thereafter, this was subjected to 90 minutes<br><br><br>
of aging and then cooled to ordinary temperature to obtain an emulsion. In this<br>
connection, 2.4 parts for each of the 5% aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate was<br>
added 7 times in total at 30 minute intervals after commencement of the dropwise addition<br>
of pre-emulsion, and 1.4 parts for each of the 5% aqueous solution of ammonium<br>
persulfate was added 2 times in total at 45 minute intervals during the 90 minutes of aging<br>
step.<br>
The thus obtained aqueous emulsion was evaluated in the same manner as in<br>
Example 1. The results are shown in Tables 2 to 5.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
An aqueous emulsion was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, except<br>
that monomers in the pre-emulsion in Example 1 were changed to 193 parts by weight of<br>
styrene and 157 parts by weight of n-butyl acrylate, and evaluated in the same manner.<br>

chain 1,2-diol structural unit of 6% by mol, a degree of polymerization of 500 and a degree<br>
of saponification of 92.6% by mol, was used as the PVA-based resin of Example 1, and<br>
evaluated in the same manner. The results are shown in Tables 2 to 5.<br><br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
[Production of PVA-based resin]<br>
Firstly, 1500 parts of vinyl acetate, 87 parts (3% by mol, based on adding vinyl<br>
acetate) of 3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene, 600 parts of methanol and 0.3% by mol (based on<br>
adding vinyl acetate) of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) were prepared.<br>
Subsequently, whole amounts of the methanol and AIBN and 10% portions of the<br>
vinyl acetate and 3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene were added to a reaction container equipped with<br>
a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel and an agitator, and polymerization was started by<br>
increasing temperature under a stream of nitrogen while stirring. Further, the remaining<br>
portions (90% for each) of vinyl acetate and 3,4-diacetoxy-l-butene were added dropwise<br>
thereto spending 9 hours, the polymerization was completed by adding a predetermined<br><br><br>
amount of m-dinitrobenzene when rate of polymerization of vinyl acetate reached 90%,<br>
and then a methanol solution of copolymer was obtained by removing unreacted vinyl<br>
acetate monomer from the system through distillation while blowing methanol steam<br>
through the system.<br><br>
Next, the above-mentioned solution was adjusted to a concentration of 45% and<br>
put into a kneader, and while keeping the solution temperature at 40Â°C, saponification was<br>
carried out by adding a 2% methanol solution of sodium hydroxide at a ratio of 5 mmol<br>
based on 1 mol in total amount of the vinyl acetate structural unit and 3,4-diacetoxy-1-<br>
butene structural unit in the copolymer. In addition, after 30 minutes of the starting of the<br>
increase of viscosity, the 2% methanol solution of sodium hydroxide was further added in<br>
the same manner at a ratio of 2 mmol. When the saponified product was precipitated and<br>
became particulate matter with the progress of saponification, acetic acid for neutralization<br>
use was added in an amount of 5 equivalents of sodium hydroxide, and the particulate was<br>
separated by filtration, thoroughly washed with methanol and then dried in a hot air drier to<br>
obtain a PVA-based resin comprising the 1,2-diol structural unit represented by the<br>
aforementioned formula (1').<br>
Degree of saponification of the thus obtained PVA-based resin was 98.6% by mol<br>
when analysis was carried out based on the amount of alkali consumption required for<br>
hydrolyzing the residual vinyl acetate and 3,4-diacetoxy-butene, and average degree of<br>
polymerization was 300 when analysis was carried out in accordance with JIS K 6726. In<br>
addition, the content of the 1,2-diol structural unit was 3% by mol when calculated by<br>
measuring it by 'H-NMR (internal standard; tetramethylsilane). In this connection,<br>
clouding point of this PVA-based resin was 90Â°C or more.<br>

dropping funnel and a thermometer was charged with 746 parts of a 6.14% aqueous<br>
solution the thus obtained PVA-based resin, and temperature was increased to 75 Â°C while<br>
agitating at an agitation rate of 230 rpm. After carrying out initial polymerization by<br>
adding thereto 36.0 parts of methyl methacrylate, 29.4 parts of n-butyl acrylate and 8.4<br>
parts of ammonium persulfate and agitating for 1 hour, a mixture of 324 parts of methyl<br>
methacrylate and 265 parts of n-butyl acrylate was added dropwise thereto spending 3.5<br><br><br>
hours, aging was further carried out for 90 minutes and then this was cooled to ordinary<br>
temperature to obtain an emulsion. In this connection, 2.4 parts for each of the 5%<br>
aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate was added 7 times in total at 30 minute intervals<br>
after commencement of the dropwise addition of pre-emulsion, and 1.4 parts for each of<br>
the 5% aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate was added 2 times in total at 45 minute<br>
intervals during the 90 minutes of aging step. The aqueous emulsion was evaluated in the<br>
same manner as in Example 1. The results are shown in Tables 2 to 5.<br><br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
An aqueous emulsion was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, except<br>
that a PVA-based resin comprising 4.3% by mol of side chain ethylene oxide group (chain<br>
length 15) and having a degree of polymerization of 170 and a degree of saponification of<br>
64% by mol was used as the PVA-based resin of Example 1, and evaluated in the same<br>
manner. The results are shown in Tables 2 to 5.<br><br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
An aqueous emulsion was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1, except<br>

chain 1,2-diol structural unit of 6% by mol, a degree of polymerization of 500, a degree of<br>
saponification of 77.6% by mol and a clouding point of 73 Â°C, was used as the PVA-based<br>
resin of Example 1, and evaluated in the same manner as in Example 1. The results are<br>
shown in Tables 2 to 5.<br><br>
