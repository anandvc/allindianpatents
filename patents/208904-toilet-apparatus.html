THE PATENTS ACT, 1970<br>
(39 of 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
TOILET APPARATUS<br>
MOORE, GARRY of 31 PERCY ROAD, ILFORD, ESSEX IG3 8SF, GREAT<br>
BRITAIN, BRITISH NATIONAL.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the<br>
nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be<br>
performed : -<br>
This invention relates to toilet apparatus, and in particular to such apparatus that<br>
uses little water in each flushing cycle. A conventional toilet or water closet disposes<br>
of waste matter by hydraulic means alone by relying on a large enough from the<br>
toilet pan. Many toilet systems exist which dispose of waste matter with a negative<br>
pneumatic pressure e.g. by drawing waste from the pan through an outlet pipe<br>
using various valves, pumps, vacuum chambers, transfer tanks and the like. Such<br>
systems do reduce water consumption but are generally difficult to manufacture,<br>
and are inconvenient to install, use and maintain.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate these difficulties by<br>
providing toilet apparatus which uses a positive pressure to discharge waste matter<br>
from the pan to an outlet pipe thus reducing water consumption. Such apparatus has<br>
the additional advantage that as the outlet pipe is unobstructed by valves or other<br>
equipment the toilet can also be used in a conventional way.<br>
The present invention is toilet apparatus comprising a toilet pan, an outlet, pipe for<br>
the contents of the pan. A closeable lid on the pan forming with the pan a waste<br>
receptacle chamber, a seal between the lid and the, means for introducing water into<br>
the chamber to wash the internal surface of the pan, and means for subsequently<br>
increasing the air pressure in the chamber to force the contents of the pan through<br>
the outlet pipe. Preferably, means are provided to pressurise the water Introduced<br>
to wash the internal surface or the pan.<br>
The lid may be provided with a locking mechanism for securing the lid in its closed<br>
position.<br>
A locking sensor may be associated with the locking mechanism to detect locking of<br>
the lid and initiate operation of the apparatus.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the outlet pipe is formed with an Sbend<br>
water trap.<br>
The means for increasing the air pressure in the chamber may include an air<br>
displacement unit connected to the chamber and, preferably also to the water cistern.<br>
The unit may comprise a piston movable in a cylinder. The piston moving in the<br>
cylinder in one stroke displaces a volume of air sufficient to provide the pressure in<br>
the chamber required to expel, the contents of the pan. The piston may be double<br>
acting, the other stroke of the piston providing the air to pressurise the cistern and<br>
thus the water washing the internal surface of the pan before the contents of the pan<br>
are expelled.<br>
The pan is provided with inlets for the water for washing its surface, these inlets<br>
being located at the top of the pan and being connected to the cistern by means<br>
which prevent the escape of air from the chamber.<br>
Preferably, a cistern is connected to the pan by two pipe each incorporating siphon.<br>
One pipe is normally closed but may be opened manually to actuate the siphon,<br>
while the other pipe is open and may act as an overflow outlet. The cistern is<br>
provided with an aperture sufficient to relay pneumatic pressure and is connected to<br>
the air displacement unit. When the air displacement unit is activated, the displaced<br>
air pressurises the cistern and, all vents and pipes to the exterior being closed,<br>
the water in the cistern is forced through the open siphon and into the pan. By<br>
venting the overflow pipe when the water level falls to a predetermined level, the<br>
pressure in the cistern can be released while allowing continued siphonic flow from<br>
the cistern to the pan.<br>
Operation of the air displacement unit may be triggered by the locking of the lid, the<br>
locking action being detected by a sensor.<br>
The toilet apparatus may be fitted with a tipping/holding/siphon tank which may<br>
be pneumatically actuated/ emptied.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:- Fig. 1 is a<br>
partially cut away perspective view of toilet apparatus according to the present<br>
invention ; Fig. 2 is a perspective view in cross-section of the chamber and air<br>
displacement unit of fig. 1; and Fig. 3 is a partially cut away perspective view of the<br>
cistern and pan used in Fig. 1. toilet apparatus generally indicated at 1. An air<br>
displacement unitA 2 is shown installed on runners 3 secured Lo chassis guides 4 by<br>
fasteners (not illustrated) thus enablinq thus enabling supply 5 enters a control box 6<br>
which contains a proximity sensor 7 and control apparatus (not illustrated), and is<br>
connected to a second proximity sensor 8 by a cable 9. The cable 9 passes into a<br>
guide tube 10 which positions the sensor 8 inside the pan 11 of the toilet close to a<br>
locking bolt 34 as will be later described.<br>
A cistern 12 has a lid 13 secured on a seal 14 by bolts passing through holes 15. An<br>
air hose 16 connects the air displacement unit 2 to the cistern 12 through a connector<br>
17, thus enabling the cistern to be pressurised. A float valve inlet 18 is connected to a<br>
suitable water supply, and an overflow/vent pipe is shown at 71.<br>
The pan 11 has a seat 20, a lid 21 and a removable lid seal/locking assembly 22. The<br>
lid 21 is provided with hinge brackets 23 and is raised and lowered around chassis<br>
Outriggers 24 (Fig. 2) as will be explained later. Hinge brackets a rebate at guide<br>
points 26. The seal/locking assembly 22 is further provided with a hook 27 thus<br>
enabling it to be slid under the lid 21 and secured by a peq 28 in holes 29, while<br>
simultaneously engaging the lip guide points 26 in the hinge 10 bracket rebates 25.<br>
The lip seal 30 is fixed to the locking assembly 22 and makes an air tight seal with<br>
the rim 31 of the pan 11 when the lid is closed. A locking assembly handle actuates<br>
the locking mechanism with a pull/push action through internal cams (not<br>
illustrated) which turn a shaft 33 thus relaying the movement to a locking bolt 34<br>
(Fig. 2).<br>
It wd be appreciated that with such an arrangement a conventional toilet lid can be<br>
converted to a sealable, locking lid. The locking bolt 34 is provided with a magnetic<br>
tip 35 which enables the bolt to activate the sensor 8 when in the locking position.<br>
The locking action of the lid also initiates a flushing cycle by actuating the air<br>
displacement unit 2.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the air displacement unit 2 and its connection to the pan 11 through<br>
connectors 36 and 37 which are a male and female tapered fit and have between<br>
them a seal to form an air tight connection. It will be appreciated that, with such an<br>
arrangement, as the unit 2 is slid into position on the chassis guides 4, the connectors<br>
are automatically aligned to form an air tight connection capable of relaying air<br>
under pressure from the unit 2 to the pan. The air displacement unit 2 consists of an<br>
end plate 39 fastened to a cylindrical housing 40 in which is located a fixed<br>
electromagnet 41 around a central guide tube 42. A second electromagnet 43 is fixed<br>
to a piston 44 and has a central guide rod 45 forming an air tight fit in the guide tube<br>
42. The piston is provided with a pneumatic seal 47 and is free to travel along the<br>
cylinder bore 40. In Fig. 2, the unit 2 is shown in its rest position.<br>
It will be appreciated that when the polarities of the electromagnets 41 and 43 are<br>
such that they are mutually attracted,, the piston 44 is drawn along the cylinder bore<br>
40 in the direction of the arrow A, thus displacing air in the cylinder 40 and forcing it<br>
through an aperture 48 and through the hose 16 into the cistern 12. Once the piston<br>
has reached the end of its travel, the proximity sensor 7 detects this and changes the<br>
polarity of one of the electromagnets 41 and 43 so that they now repel each other.<br>
The piston 44 is then driven back along the cylinder bore 40 in the direction of the<br>
arrow B thus again displacing the air in the cylinder 40. This displaced air is forced<br>
through connectors 36 and 37 and into 25 the sealed pan chamber. Once the piston<br>
44 has reached the end of its travel a proximity sensor 50 detects this and causes the<br>
electromagnets 41 and 43 to be deenergised. The air displacement unit 2 is reset once<br>
the sensor 8 senses that the lid 21 has been opened. Air vents 51 are of the flap-valve<br>
type and allow an inward flow of air to the cylindrical chamber 40 sufficient to<br>
prevent a vacuum developing behind the piston 44. The piston 44 may be driven<br>
manually by a handle 52 (Fig.1) which is connected to the guide rod 45. The seat<br>
hinge brackets 53 and lid hinge brackets 23 are connected to the chassis outriggers 24<br>
by hinge pins and are free to pivot around them.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the cistern 12. A primary siphon 55 connects to the water pipe 56 which<br>
in turn connects to the pan 11 at the connector 57. The connector 57 is provided with<br>
a flap valve 58 which allows the flow of air and water only in the direction of the<br>
arrow C. This allows the cistern to discharge into the pan while blocking the escape<br>
of air from the pan 11. The primary siphon 55 is provided with a flap valve 59 for<br>
preventing the flow of water from the cistern 12. Water flow through the siphon 55 is<br>
achieved by hfting the plunger 60 which is connected to a siphon actuator 61 and a<br>
flap-valve lever 62 which is pivoted on a fulcrum 63.<br>
It will be appreciated that with such an arrangement the siphon is normally blocked,<br>
but by lifting the plunger 60 the flap valve is opened by lever 62 and siphonic flow is<br>
started by the actuator 61 thus depositing the contents of the cistern into the pan 11<br>
in a sufficient quantity to flush the pan. Conveniently, means to lift the plunger 60 is<br>
provided by the handle 64, connecting rod 65 and lever 66.<br>
A secondary siphon 67 consists of an open tube provided with a bell mouth 68 to<br>
facilitate effective breaking of its siphon. The siphon 67 connects to a water pipe 69<br>
which enters the pan 11 and distributes water over the surface of the pan through<br>
nozzles 70 located under the rim of the pan 11, thus providing an efficient spray<br>
pattern for washing the pad. With such an arrangement an open overflow route to<br>
the pan 11 is always provided. The nozzles 70 and pipe 69 may be fitted with valves<br>
for inhibiting the escape of air from the pan 11.<br>
An overflow pipe 71 connects to the cistern 12 and is provided with an additional<br>
aperture around its circumference 72. A sleeve is connected to a float 75 by a rod 76<br>
and fits over the overflow pipe 71 where it is free to swivel upon it. Two apertures 74<br>
are provided such that as sleeve 73 turns aperture may be exposed or obscured by<br>
sleeve apertures 74. An end cap 77 is an air tight fit over pipe 71 and retains the<br>
sleeve 73 in place. Thus, as the water level in the cistern changes the float 75 rises<br>
and falls accordingly thus turning the sleeve 73 on the pipe 71 which opens and<br>
closes cistern vent through apertures 72 and 74.<br>
It will be appreciated that with such an arrangement waste is deposited into the pan<br>
11 and the lid is closed and locked. The locking action of the lid 22 triggers the<br>
sensor 8 to activate the air displacement unit 2 causing the piston to be driven<br>
forward to force air into cistern through the hose 16. As, the cistern water level is<br>
high, the pipe aperture 72 is obscured and there is no vent for displaced air.<br>
Consequently, water is forced through the open secondary siphon 67 and into the<br>
pan 11 where the nozzles 70 provide a spray pattern to wash the surface of the pan.<br>
As the cistern water level drops, the float 75 drop thus exposing the aperture 72<br>
whereupon pressurised air is vented via aperture 74. Air resistance to the piston 44<br>
drops and the piston quickly reaches the end of its travel. Water is still able to flow<br>
through the open siphon at a reduced rate due to gravity.<br>
The direction of piston 44 is now reversed and the air inside the sealed pan chamber<br>
is pressurised, whereupon waste is forced through the outlet pipe 78. The piston 44<br>
reaches the end of its travel and the flushing cycle ends. However the siphon 67 is<br>
still active and a quantity of water sufficient to replenish the water trap seal 78 is<br>
deposited into the pan 11 before the water level drops to the level of the bell mouth<br>
68 and the siphon is broken. The cistern water then replenished via the float valve<br>
and the float 75 rises thus closing the vent 72.<br>
In the event of inlet valve failure, the float 75 rises thus aligning the pipe aperture 72<br>
with the second aperture 74 of the sleeve, allowing water to drain away.<br>
Alternatively, rising water may drain away through the open siphon to the pan 11.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention may provide an overflow via the cistern hose 16<br>
and air displacement equipment.<br>
It will be apparent that the toilet apparatus may be used in a conventional manual<br>
hydraulic flush mode by using the handle 64.<br>
While the air displacement unit as described is operated electrically or manually, it<br>
could be modified to operate mechanically, hydraulically or pneumatically.<br>
In a further modification of the embodiment described, the cistern is not pressurised,<br>
and the piston may be either single acting, in which case the return stroke serves<br>
merely to reset the unit, or double acting in which case, the return stroke serves to<br>
pressurise the chamber in a second flushing cycle.<br>
The air displacement unit may take other forms including a diaphragm an air pump<br>
or a reservoir of compressed air.<br>
In a further modification or the embodiment, the air displacement unit takes the<br>
form of a compressor, diaphragm or pressurised gas container or reservoir.<br>
