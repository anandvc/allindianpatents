COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br><br>
1. TITLE OF INVENTION A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF <br>
CRYSTALLINE FORM OF AZITHROMYCIN<br><br><br>
2. ALEMBIC LIMITED, Alembic Road, Vadodara-390 003, Gujarat, India, an Indian Company.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
18-3-2005<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel crystalline form of azithromycin, namely azithromycin monohydrate acetonitrile solvate, which has improved properties over amorphous azithromycin, azithromycin monohydrate, azithromycin dihydrate and other solvates like azithromycin ethanolate and azithromycin isopropanol clathrate. The present invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of azithromycin monohydrate acetonitrile solvate. The invention further relates to a simple, safe and cost effective process for the manufacture of highly pure azithromycin monohydrate, azithromycin dihydrate and azithromycin monohydrate isopropanol clathrate from azithromycin monohydrate acetonitrile solvate of the present invention. The present invention also related to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the azithromycin monohydrate acetonitrile solvate.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Azithromycin, 9-Deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homo-erythromycin A, is a 15 member ring macrolide belonging to a new class of antibiotics termed "Azalides", due to the incorporation of a nitrogen atom in the macrocyclic ring.<br>
Azithromycin (Formula I) is derived from the 14-membered macrolide antibiotic erythromycin A and shows significant improvement in its activity against gram - Ve organisms compared to erythromycin A (C. J. Dunn and L. B. Barradell Azithromycin: A Review of its Pharmacological properties and use as a 3-day therapy in respiratory tract infections, Drug, 1996, March, 51(3)483-505).<br><br>
Formula I<br><br>
Azithromycin was first discovered by G. Kobrehel and S. Djokic (US Patent No. 4,517,359; S. Djokic et al.). U.S. Patent No. 4,517,359 describes methylation of 11-aza-10-deoxo-10-dihydro erythromycin A (presently called 9-Deoxo-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A) in an excess of formaldehyde and formic acid in a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g., chloroform or carbon tetrachloride. In the procedure described in U.S. Patent No. 4,517,359 the isolation of azithromycin comprises extraction of the aqueous layer with a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent followed by evaporation of the solvent. The disadvantages of this process are that (i) a halogenated hydrocarbon is used which is environmentally unsafe and (ii) the isolation of azithromycin involves several cumbersome and/or inefficient extraction and solvent evaporation steps. According to European Patent Application EP 298650, the azithromycin obtained by the process taught in US 4517359 is a hygroscopic monohydrate. Because of its hygroscopic nature, this monohydrate is difficult to prepare and maintain in a form having a constant, reproducible water-content, and is particularly difficult to handle during formulation.<br>
Two other synthesis routes, affording azithromycin as a form that should differ from the crystalline ones previously mentioned, have also been described in WO 94/26758 and US 4517359. According to such processes azithromycin is obtained by single evaporation to dryness. However, in these prior art documents there is no reference to the crystalline state of the azithromycin thus obtained.<br>
Different prior art teach methods of manufacture of the two crystalline forms of azithromycin. US 4474768 teaches methods of manufacturing hygroscopic monohydrate by recrystallization of azithromycin from ethanol/water. EP 0298650 also teaches preparation of non-hygroscopic azithromycin dihydrate by recrystallization from THF/petroleum ether/water. CN 1093371 teaches preparation of non-hygroscopic azithromycin dihydrate by recrystallization from acetone/water as well as using other solvents such as methanol, DMF, acetonitrile, dioxane and water. EP 0941999 teaches preparation of non-hygroscopic azithromycin dihydrate by precipitation from base neutralized acid solution of azithromycin in acetone/water. WO 00/32203 teaches preparation of ethanolate of azithromycin by granual crystallization of azithromycin from ethanol by addition of a minimum amount of water. US 6245903 teaches preparation of<br><br><br>
azithromycin monohydrate by dissolving azithromycin in isopropanol, followed by the slow addition of water.<br>
Various journals also teach methods of manufacturing crystalline forms of azithromycin similar to the above-mentioned prior art methods.<br>
From the teachings of aforesaid prior art it is clear that three forms of Azithromycin are known. Anhydrous azithromycin is reported as an amorphous crude product in US 4517359 (Example 1). It is obtained by evaporating the final solvent (e.g. chloroform) used in the process of preparation of azithromycin. It is not a crystalline in nature and therefore cannot be made in pure form per se in commercial scale.<br>
US 4474768 teaches the process of making azithromycin monohydrate but do not claim the resulting product. Furthermore, the prior art does not provide a description of the drying process (temperature or pressure). Azithromycin monohydrate is known to be hygroscopic. This is an undesirable property since it complicates formulation of azithromycin drug product and can adversely affect its stability on long term storage.<br>
US 6268489 teaches azithromycin dihydrate and, in contrast to azithromycin monohydrate, a full description of the drying process used for obtaining the product is provided. Low boiling solvents (tetrahydrofuran and hexane) are used with 3-4 equivalent moles of water to obtain the crystalline product, which is dried under vacuum at lower temperatures (20°C-40°C). The use of low boiling solvents for crystallisation and low temperature for vacuum drying of the product are prescribed presumably to control the desirable amount of water that must be evaporated to afford the azithromycin dihydrate.<br>
The processes taught in US 6268489 for the preparation of azithromycin dihydrate, while producing a non-hygroscopic form of azithromycin, have a number of disadvantages:<br>
1. Water immiscibility of the organic solvent mixture (tetrahydrofuran plus hexane) can cause problems in obtaining pure material since crystallization processes are known to afford pure material when the anti-solvent is miscible with the solvent used to dissolve the crude product.<br><br><br>
2.	The drying process must be very carefully controlled since an increase in temperature will cause the transformation of the non-hygroscopicdihydrate to the hygroscopic monohydrate.<br>
3.	The use of low boiling point solvents is complicated by their toxicity and possibility of formation of explosive peroxide during solvent recovery.<br>
Therefore, there is a need of a crystalline form of azithromycin having improved physical properties and which can be used for easy and improved methods of preparation of azithromycin crystalline forms.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a novel form of azithromycin which is crystalline and, in contrast to anhydrous azithromycin, is obtained in pure form.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a novel form of azithromycin which is not hygroscopic.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel form of azithromycin which in contrast to azithromycin dihydrate, is obtained conveniently and reproducibly having very low impurity profile specially Azithromycin B impurity.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel form of azithromycin from which azithromycin dihydrate, azithromycin monohydrate acetonitrile solvate may be obtained by very simple methods and in pure form.<br>
It has been found that methylation of 9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A (also known as azaerythromycin A) in acetonitrile in presence of methylating agent results in the formation of a new solvate of azithromycin, namely azithromycin monohydrate acetonitrile solvate.<br>
The physical properties of this product and the processes used for its preparation and that of other azithromycin crystalline forms from the product have a number of major advantages over the existing azithromycin product forms and the procedure used for their preparation.<br><br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Azithromycin monohydrate acetonitrile solvate according to the invention is useful for the preparation of medicines for treating various microbial infections.<br><br><br>
Azithromycin monohydrate acetonitrile solvate according to the invention contains 0.5 to 1.5 moles of acetonitrile for every molecule of azithromycin monohydrate.<br>
The process for manufacture of Azithromycin monohydrate acetonitrile solvate comprises n-methylation of azaerythromycin A in acetonitirle in presence of methylating agent and the reaction is terminated by adding aqueous base to the reaction mixture. The methylating agent is selected from formaldehyde, formic acid, paraformaldehyde and mixtures thereof. The aqueous base is an alkaline solution selected from sodium hydroxide solution, potassium hydroxide solution and the like. The organic layer is separated and cooled slowly, resulting in the precipitation of crystalline azithromycin monohydrate acetonitrile solvate.<br>
The volume of solvent used is such as to sufficiently suspend or dissolve azaerythromycin A. The suspension temperature is between ambient to reflux temperature of solvent. Preferably, the refluxing and heating is carried out for 20 to 30 hours at 40 to 90°C.
