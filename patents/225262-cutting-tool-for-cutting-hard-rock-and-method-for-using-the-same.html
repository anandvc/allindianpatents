				<td>CUTTING TOOL FOR CUTTING HARD ROCK AND METHOD FOR USING<br>
THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to improved cutting tools for the cutting, drilling or sawing<br>
of hard materials, such as rock, stone, concrete and the like. The invention particularly<br>
relates to a pick, a saw and a drill, each including a diamond composite tip, and methods<br>
of using same.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Machinery employed in the excavation, mining, cutting, working, or drilling of<br>
rock, stone, concrete and similar hard materials employ a variety of tools, hereinafter<br>
collectively referred to as "cutting tools". Three commonly used types of cutting tools are<br>
picks, saws and drills.<br>
Picks<br>
Picks are used as cutting tools in machinery used in such applications as the<br>
mining of coal and the tunnelling through of rock. The term "pick" (also called "drag-<br>
tool") typically means a pointed or chisel shaped rock cutting tool which cuts rock by<br>
penetrating and scraping along the surface of the rock. Picks typically consist of a steel<br>
shank with a tungsten carbide-cobalt material forming the cutting tip. This process<br>
produces relatively large rock fragments (or "cuttings") as compared with the finer<br>
cuttings formed using tools having tips made from diamond or polyctystalline diamond<br>
composite (PDC).<br>
Currently, the cutting head of a piece of mining or tunneling machinery is fitted<br>
with a number of tool holders for orienting the cutting tools at a desired angle for striking<br>
the rock (the "angle of attack"). The cutting tools are "laced", i.e. arranged in a pattern<br>
designed to effect relieved cutting, wherein as the cutting head rotates, each cutting tool<br>
has its work facilitated by the action of tools that it follows and, similarly, facilitates the<br>
work of each tool that follows it. This process allows rock fragments to be broken free<br>
with less energy than would be required if each tool had to excavate undamaged rock by<br>
unrelieved cutting.<br>
Conventional picks, as previously stated, typically have a cutting tip formed from<br>
a tungsten-carbide-cobalt composite. These picks have a number of advantages.<br>
Principally, tungsten carbide wears quickly when used to cut abrasive rock.<br>
Pointed tungsten carbide tips are designed to rotate in their holders<br>
during use so as to evenly distribute the wear. In practice, most tips do not<br>
rotate, resulting in the formation of wear flat. Even tips which do rotate as<br>
intended wear to a cone which contacts the rock surface along a line rather than<br>
at a point, thereby requiring much larger forces to fracture the rock compared to<br>
when the tip was new. Because of this wear, tungsten carbide tips can only<br>
effectively be used for cutting coal or soft rock. Accordingly, the average life<br>
span of a tungsten carbide tip is short and it must be replaced frequently.<br>
There is clearly a need for a pick'which has an increased life span,<br>
maintains a pointed shape throughout its use and which is strong and wear<br>
resistant enough to cut hard rock, such as granite.<br>
Saws<br>
Existing equipment for the cutting by sawing of rock, stone or concrete<br>
largely comprises impregnated diamond saw wheels and rock wheels.<br>
Rock wheels are large wheels having pointed tungsten carbide tipped<br>
cutting elements, called "drag bits", which remove rock in a chipping action.<br>
Due to the wear characteristics of the tungsten carbide tips, rock wheels are<br>
limited to use on rocks having a strength limit of about 100 to 120 MPa, such as<br>
sandstones. Accordingly, while they can be quite successfully used on soft<br>
rocks, rock wheels cannot be used on harder rock, such as granite.<br>
Impregnated diamond saw wheels include as cutting elements peripheral<br>
segments of metal matrix composite material containing diamond grit. The<br>
sawing action is achieved by the scraping against the rock of the tiny protruding<br>
diamond particles which causes microfracturing. With each pass of the saw,<br>
only a very small amount of rock, e.g. a few microns, is removed as very small<br>
fragments. While such saws can be used to cut hard rock, the sawing process<br>
is very energy intensive and very slow.<br>
There is clearly a need for a saw which can be used to cut hard rock, but<br>
wears at a slower rate than prior art tungsten carbide rock wheels, but saws at a<br>
faster and more energy efficient rate than prior art impregnated diamond saw<br>
wheels.<br>
Drills<br>
The drilling of soft rocks (e.g. coal, sandstone) is conventionally<br>
performed using drill bits incorporating largely pointed or chisel shaped tungsten<br>
carbide cutting elements. Cutting elements of such shape are termed "drag<br>
bits" in the art. These drag bits operate using a "chipping" action, removing a<br>
relatively large amount of rock as fragments at each pass, and so drill rapidly.<br>
However, due to the rapid wear of the tungsten carbide, these drill bits are not<br>
practical for use in drilling hard rock, such as granite.<br>
Attempts have been made to produce tungsten carbide tool tips in which<br>
a very thin layer of diamond is grown over the tungsten carbide. However, such<br>
attempts have been unsuccessful due to distortion of tungsten carbide or<br>
decomposition of diamond at high temperatures.<br>
Much of the drilling done in strong (hard) rock is currently effected using<br>
drill bits incorporating the relatively harder materials, diamond or polycrystalline<br>
diamond compact (PDC).<br>
Diamond impregnated bits comprise diamond fragments embedded in a<br>
metal matrix composite (MMC) material. Diamond set bits comprise relatively<br>
larger natural diamonds mounted in MMC.<br>
Alternatively, some drilling of hard rock is done using drill bits<br>
incorporating polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) or thermally stable PDC.<br>
These drill bits comprise discs of the PDC mounted on a tungsten carbide-<br>
cobalt composite such that the edges of the discs scrape against the rock.<br>
In all prior art drill bits which incorporate diamond or PDC as cutting<br>
elements, the cutting of the rock is effected by scraping the cutting element<br>
across the surface of the rock. Each pass causes microfracturing and removes<br>
a very small amount of rock, typically less than 1/10 mm per pass. The rock is<br>
removed as tiny fragments, a process which is very energy intensive. The<br>
drilling process is accordingly slow, given the small amount of rock removed at<br>
each pass, and results in a drilling rate of only a metre or so per hour.<br>
There is clearly a need for a drill bit for drilling hard rock which is strong<br>
and wears at a slower rate than prior art tungsten carbide bits, but operates<br>
more rapidly and efficiently than prior art diamond or PDC containing bits.<br>
There have been numerous attempts to manufacture cutting tools having<br>
tips made from diamond or polycrystalline diamond composite (PDC) materials,<br>
with little success.<br>
The present inventors have recognised that the inefficiency of prior art<br>
diamond or PDC containing cutting tools resides at least partially in the failure to<br>
provide such materials in the form of pointed or chisel shaped cutting bodies<br>
termed in the art as "drag bits". Pointed bodies are able to press into the rock<br>
surface and remove rock as relatively large fragments which requires less<br>
specific energy with each pass than that required by prior art drag bits which<br>
scrape against the rock surface producing much smaller fragments.<br>
Furthermore, pointed bodies remove more rock with each pass, which results in<br>
a more rapid cutting process.<br>
Diamond containing materials have typically been available in only a very<br>
limited range of shapes due to limitations of the moulding and machining<br>
processes used. Those shapes are triangles, squares, rectangles and half<br>
cylinders as cut from discs and cylinders by either laser cutting or electric<br>
discharge machining (EDM). It has not been possible to produce by direct<br>
synthesis pointed bodies, such as cones.<br>
New generation diamond composite materials have been developed with<br>
properties superior to prior art composite materials. Such materials are termed<br>
"advanced diamond composites" ("ADC") and are described, for example, in<br>
WO88/07409 and WO90/01986, the disclosures of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
The ADC are typically formed by mixtures of diamond crystals and silicon<br>
to high pressures and temperatures to cause melting of the silicon which<br>
infiltrates between diamond particles and reacts with carbon of the diamonds to<br>
form silicon carbide. The silicon carbide forms a strong bond between the<br>
diamond crystals.<br>
The diamond-silicon mixture may be placed adjacent silicon bodies<br>
during the reaction in order to enhance the infiltration of silicon into the mixture.<br>
This modification, which is the subject of WO88/07409, minimises detrimental<br>
porosity and microcracking and increases density, and thereby enhances the<br>
mechanical properties of the ADC.<br>
In another modification, which is described in WO90/01986, a nitrogen<br>
and/or phosphorous containing material is introduced into the diamond-silicon<br>
mixture and/or the silicon bodies (if used) prior to reaction, such that the<br>
resulting silicon carbide bond in the ADC contains greater than a threshold<br>
amount of nitrogen and/or phosphorus. This threshold amount is typically 500<br>
parts per million. The ADC product has low electrical resistiyity - typically less<br>
than 0.2 ohm cm. A low electrical resistivity is advantageous in that it enables<br>
the shaping, working and machining of the ADC bodies by Electrical Discharge<br>
Machining ("EDM") - also termed "wire-cutting" or "spark erosion". EDM is far more<br>
versatile than conventional shaping techniques, such as laser cutting, both in terms of the<br>
size of bodies worked and the ranges of shapes able to be produced.<br>
It has been found possible to mould and/or machine these ADC materials into a<br>
variety of shapes, including pointed bodies such as cones and bullet or ogival shaped<br>
bodies.<br>
Although it is now possible to produce an effective shape using ADC materials, a<br>
further problem has been encountered, namely a means of effectively attaching the ADC<br>
bodies to tool bodies. Tool bodies are typically manufactured from steel, although they<br>
may include tungsten carbide components. The inventors have found that conventional<br>
methods of attaching the cutting tips to the tool body, such as by vacuum brazing, do not<br>
always provide a strong enough bond and the tips can accordingly break off during use.<br>
The inventors have surprisingly discovered that using a metal matrix composite to bond<br>
the cutting tip to the tool body produces a very strong and effective bond.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a cutting tool for cutting hard<br>
rock, said cutting tool comprising a tool body, and<br>
one or more cutting elements each having a pointed body formed from a diamond<br>
composite material including diamond crystals, bonded together by a silicon carbide<br>
matrix, the or each cutting element being bonded in or on the tool body using a metal<br>
matrix composite material as a bonding medium to bond to both the cutting element and<br>
the tool body, such that the point of the or each element protrudes from said tool body<br>
The present invention also provides a pick for cutting hard rock, said pick<br>
comprising<br>
a pick body including a shank at one end thereof for attachment to a tool holder<br>
and a cutting element provided at the other end of the pick body, said<br>

diamond crystals bonded together by a silicon carbide matrix, said cutting element having<br>
a tapered, elongate body forming a mounting portion, which tapers inwardly toward a<br>
bullet or ogival shaped head forming a cutting portion, said mounting portion of said<br>
cutting element being at least partially received in a recess provided in said pick body and<br>
said mounting portion being bonded in place by a layer of a metal matrix composite<br>
material as a bonding medium to bond to both the mounting portion and the pick body,<br>
such that said cutting portion protrudes from said recess.<br>
The present invention further provides a saw for cutting hard rock, said<br>

crystals bonded together by a silicon carbide matrix, and each cutting element<br>
is mounted in the metal composite material such that the point or chisel edge of<br>
each element protrudes from the matrix.<br>
According to the present invention there is also provided a drill bit for<br>
cutting hard rock, said drill bit including a plurality of cutting elements mounted<br>
in a supporting matrix of a metal composite material, wherein each cutting<br>
element comprises a pointed or chisel shaped body including a diamond<br>
composite material including diamond crystals bonded together by a silicon<br>
carbide matrix, and each cutting element is mounted in the metal composite<br>
material such that the point or chisel edge of each element protrudes from the<br>
matrix.<br>
Preferably the cutting element is a pointed body.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present inventors have developed a cutting tool which<br>
incorporates a cutting element comprising a suitably shaped body made from<br>
ADC material. The cutting element includes a mounting portion for mounting on<br>
or in the pick body and a cutting portion protruding from the pick body and<br>
carrying thereon the cutting surface. The shape of the cutting portion may be a<br>
cone, a truncated cone, a wedge, a chisel, a bullet shape, a rounded point, a<br>
flat plate, a pyramid, a triangle, a corner of a cube, a tetrahedron, a parrot's<br>
beak or a snow plough shape.<br>
As previously noted, while the cutting tips of prior art tools have usually<br>
been attached to the tool body by a brazing process, the inventors have found<br>
that brazing of an ADC tip to either a WC or steel base does not provide a<br>
strong enough bond. Instead, the inventors have surprisingly found that<br>
bonding the ADC tip to a WC or steel substrate using a metal matrix composite<br>
provides a very strong and durable bond. Further, metal matrix composite<br>
provides a highly suitable matrix for embedding ADC elements therein.<br>
The composition of the metal matrix composite material can vary but<br>
typically contains as major components copper, zinc, silver and tin. The<br>
composite can also contain tungsten carbide grains. Such metal matrix<br>
composite can suitably be formed using metallic powders, such as those sold<br>
as "Matrix Powders" by Kennametal. One such suitable powder is type P-75S<br>
Matrix Powder. The metallic powders are turned into a solid metal composite<br>
by sintering under pressure. In one form of the invention, the composite is<br>
formed by a fusion process, in which the metal powders partially melt and are<br>
squeezed together and densified. Alternatively the composite may be formed<br>
by a process of infiltration in which a molten metal is added to the powder under<br>
pressure and the molten metal fills the interstices between powder particles.<br>
Preferably at least the cutting portion of the cutting element is conical,<br>
bullet or ogival shaped, with the apex forming the cutting tip. Preferably the<br>
cutting element comprises a tapered, elongate body and an ogival head. The<br>
overall shape of the cutting element may be similar to a 22 calibre rifle<br>
projectile. A bullet shaped cutting tip is preferred to a cone shaped tip as it is<br>
inherently stronger and less likely to break.<br>
The mounting portion of the cutting element is preferably not straight<br>
sided but is instead tapered towards the cutting tip. That is, it is preferred that<br>
the mounting portion be frustoconical, instead of cylindrical because a<br>
frustoconical shape has inherently greater strength than a cylindrical shape.<br>
Another preferred shape of the cutting element is a "double cone", based<br>
upon the shape of two cones joined together at their bases. One of the cones<br>
forms a mounting portion and is received in a recess provided in the tool body<br>
and/or the metal matrix composite, while the other cone forms the cutting<br>
portion and protrudes from the tool body for contact with the rock being<br>
excavated. The cones may be of differing height, with the more elongate cone<br>
being received in the recess and/or MMC and the squat cone forming the<br>
cutting tip. The double cone shape is advantageous in that it requires only a<br>
minimum amount of diamond composite material and therefore is relatively<br>
inexpensive to manufacture. The cone forming the cutting portion may have<br>
advantageously a bullet shaped or ogival profile, which as previously stated,<br>
provides a stronger cutting tip than a conical profile.<br>
Pick<br>
The pick preferably includes a steel shank at one end thereof, for<br>
attachment to a tool holder, with the cutting element provided at the other end.<br>
The mounting portion of the cutting element is preferably at least partly<br>
received in a recess provided in the pick body and therefore needs to be<br>
sufficiently elongated to ensure that a sufficient length of the cutting portion<br>
protrudes to enable cutting to be effected. There is preferably a gap between<br>
the mounting portion and the inner surface of the recess to accommodate<br>
enough metal matrix composite material to bond the cutting element in place.<br>
By mounting the cutting element in a recess, the subsequent bond is<br>
considerably stronger.<br>
The recess into which is received the mounting portion of the cutting<br>
element is shaped so as to complement the shape of the mounting portion.<br>
Accordingly, where the mounting portion is frustoconical, the recess is<br>
preferably also frustoconical and where the mounting portion is conical, the<br>
recess is also preferably conical.<br>
The gap between the mounting portion and the recess wall is filled with a<br>
metal matrix composite material, which bonds the cutting element to the pick<br>
body.<br>
The pick body may further include a tungsten carbide component in<br>
addition to the steel component. In such an embodiment, the steel component<br>
preferably forms at least part of the shank with the tungsten carbide component<br>
brazed thereto and housing the recess for receiving the cutting element. Again,<br>
MMC is used to bond the cutting tip to the pick body.<br>
The addition of tungsten carbide having an intermediate flexibility<br>
between the steel and ADC components enhances the overall strength of the<br>
pick. Moreover, MMC also has modulus of elasticity intermediate those of steel<br>
and ADC and similarly enhances the overall strength, even where there is no<br>
intervening tungsten carbide present.<br>
The present inventors have also discovered that superior cutting results<br>
are achieved by using the pick of the invention, at an angle of attack different<br>
from the angle conventionally used for prior art picks.<br>
Conventionally, picks are orientated in their tool holders such that in use<br>
the "angle of attack", i.e. the angle between the surface of the rock being cut<br>
and the axis of the pick, is about 40° to 60°. Such an angle has previously been<br>
necessary due to the particular wear characteristics of the dominantly WC-Co<br>
cutting tips.<br>
However, the present inventors have found that in using the pick of the<br>
present invention, far superior results are obtained at a higher angle of attack<br>
that is above 60°. Preferably the angle of attack is in the range of 60° to 80°<br>
more preferably, 65° to 75° most preferably about 70°. This steeper angle of<br>
attack is made possible due to the cutting element being considerably harder<br>
than those of the prior art, resulting in a different wearing pattern. Also, it has<br>
been found that using some embodiments of the pick of the invention at the<br>
conventional lower angles of attack can, under some circumstances, result in<br>
detachment of the cutting element from the pick body. However, by increasing<br>
the angle of attack to above 60°, the force applied to the cutting tip runs as<br>
close as possible to the axis of rotation of the pick, so that there is a minimum<br>
bending movement applied to the cutting tip which could cause the cutting<br>
element to detach.<br>
Saw<br>
As previously noted, the inventors have surprisingly found that metal<br>
matrix composite materials provide a highly suitable matrix for embedding the<br>
ADC cutting elements therein. The saw of the invention preferably comprises a<br>
substantially circular saw body having the cutting elements mounted about its<br>
periphery to thereby form a cutting face.<br>
In one embodiment the saw body includes a plurality of arcuate cutting<br>
segments receivable on and spaced about the periphery of the saw body. Each<br>
cutting segment typically comprises a plurality of cutting elements mounted in<br>
MMC such that the cutting segments jointly make up the cutting face.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the saw was manufactured by mounting the<br>
cutting elements directly into holes or apertures provided about the periphery of<br>
the saw body. The cutting elements were set into place using MMC provided in<br>
each hole.<br>
Preferably, the cutting elements arranged on the saw are laced. That is,<br>
the cutting elements are arranged in a pattern designed to effect relieved<br>
cutting: as the saw rotates, each cutting element has its work facilitated by the<br>
action of cutting elements it follows and, similarly, facilitates the work of each<br>
cutting element that follows it This process allows rock fragments to be broken<br>
free with less energy that would be required if each tool had to excavate<br>
undamaged rock by unrelieved cutting. It is to be noted that it has not been<br>
possible to lace prior art tungsten carbide cutting elements as they have to be<br>
comparatively larger and to follow one another in the same groove. Using the<br>
saw of the present invention, it has been possible to remove rock at the<br>
astonishing rate of 1 mm each pass.<br>
Conventional WC-Co drag bits are orientated in use such that the "angle<br>
of attack", i.e. the angle between the surface of the rock being cut and the axis<br>
of the drag bit is about 40° to 60°. Such an angle has previously been<br>
necessary due to the particular wear characteristics of the WC-Co cutting tips.<br>
However, the present inventors have found that in using the saw of the<br>
present invention, far superior results are obtained where the cutting elements<br>
are mounted in the saw body and/or supporting matrix such that the angle of<br>
attack of each cutting element is in the range of 60° to 80°. More preferably, the<br>
angle of attack is in the range of 65° to 75°, most preferably about 70°. This<br>
steeper angle of attack is made possible due to the cutting elements being<br>
considerably harder than those of the prior art resulting in different wear<br>
characteristics.<br>
A saw incorporating the ADC cutting elements supported in a metal<br>
matrix composite material provides highly superior cutting performance over<br>
any of the saws of the prior art. The saw of the invention can cut through hard<br>
rock very rapidly, advancing by a millimetre at each pass, corresponding to 1<br>
metre a minute for a speed of 1000 rpm. This cutting rate is many times faster<br>
than a diamond impregnated saw, and can be largely attributable to the process<br>
of indentation by the pointed cutting elements and formation of crack<br>
propagation. Such a process is considerably different to the cutting action of<br>
any existing saw. Moreover, the saw of the invention is able to cut a slot in rock<br>
having a width which is considerably smaller than that produced by prior art<br>
rock wheels, meaning that there is less rock wastage.<br>
The advantages of the saw of the invention are summarised below:<br>
(i) The saws are able to cut strong rock such as granite, which has not<br>
previously been possible with prior art drag bit saws.<br>
(ii) Cutting is more rapid due to a process of crack propagation and chip<br>
formation, producing macroscopic fragments, unlike the slower, microfracture<br>
process of rock cutting used by conventional impregnated<br>
diamond saw wheels.<br>
(iii) It is possible to exploit the advantages of lacing the drag bits, which has<br>
not been possible with conventional tools utilising tungsten carbide drag<br>
bits due to the latter's larger size and their need to follow each other in<br>
the same groove during cutting.<br>
(iv) Smaller forces are required for a given excavation rate compared with<br>
prior art saws having tungsten carbide drag bits,<br>
(v) Similarly, excavation rates are higher for a given applied force than for<br>
prior art saws having tungsten carbide drag bits,<br>
(vi) The saws of the invention can excavate with a superior specific energy of<br>
excavation due to the production of macroscopic chips, as compared<br>
with conventional diamond saws.<br>
Drill Bit<br>
A drill bit in accordance with the present invention incorporates a plurality<br>
of cutting elements, each comprising a "drag bit", i.e. a pointed body made from<br>
ADC material. Each cutting element includes a mounting portion for mounting<br>
in the metal matrix composite material, and a cutting portion protruding from the<br>
supporting matrix and carrying thereon the cutting surface.<br>
The drill bit of the present invention may comprise a simple drill bit for<br>
drilling holes or a core drill bit. A core drill bit is annular in shape and drills an<br>
annular hole with the core thereby produced being able to be retrieved and<br>
examined for information about the geology of the rock through which the hole<br>
has passed.<br>
There are different methods available for bringing the rock core or<br>
cuttings from the hole to the surface. A flow of drilling fluid comprising air, water<br>
or mud is typically circulated during drilling to cool the drill bit, and can also be<br>
used to bring rock cuttings to the surface. In conventional circulation, the<br>
drilling fluid travels to the bottom of the hole down the inside of the pipe string<br>
joined to the drill bit. In reverse circulation, the drilling fluid flows down the<br>
outside of the pipe string and up the inside of the pipe string where the pipe<br>
string is a dual wall tube, having one pipe within another, the drilling fluid flows<br>
down the annular space between the pipes, then up the central pipe.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the drill bit of the invention<br>
is used in a dual pipe reverse circulation core drilling. The drill bit includes a<br>
core breaker for breaking the core into short lengths as the core drilling<br>
proceeds. The lengths of core are then lifted to the surface up the central pipe<br>
by the drilling fluid.<br>
The drill bit preferably comprises an annular or cylindrical drill bit body<br>
having a plurality of cutting elements mounted in MMC at one end of the body to<br>
form a cutting face. The annular or cylindrical drill bit body has an inner wall<br>
and an outer wall which preferably contain drilling fluid channels formed therein<br>
through which drilling fluid can pass during use.<br>
As was the case with the saw of the invention, it is preferred that the<br>
cutting elements of the drill are laced. That is, the cutting elements are<br>
arranged in a pattern designed to effect relieved cutting : as the drill bit rotates,<br>
each cutting element has its work facilitated by the action of cutting elements it<br>
follows and, similarly, facilitates the work of each cutting element that follows it.<br>
This process allows rock fragments to be broken free with less energy than<br>
would be required if each tool had to excavate undamaged rock by unrelieved<br>
cutting. It is to be noted that it has not been possible to lace prior art tungsten<br>
carbide bits as they have to be comparatively larger and to follow one another in<br>
the same groove.<br>
Using the drill bit of the present invention, it has been possible to remove<br>
rock at the astonishing rate of 1 mm each pass.<br>
Conventional WC-Co drag bits are orientated in use such that the "angle<br>
of attack", i.e. the angle between the surface of the rock being cut and the axis<br>
of the drag bit is about 40° to 60°. Such an angle has previously been<br>
necessary due to the particular wear characteristics of the WC-Co cutting tips.<br>
However, the present inventors have found that in using the drill bit of the<br>
present invention, far superior results are obtained where the cutting elements<br>
are mounted in the supporting matrix such that the angle of attack of each<br>
cutting element is in the range of 60° to 80°. More preferably, the angle of<br>
attack is in the range of 65° to 75°, most preferably about 70°. This steeper<br>
angle of attack is made possible due to the cutting elements being considerably<br>
harder than those of the prior art resulting in different wear characteristics.<br>
The advantages of the drill bit of the invention are summarised below:<br>
(i) The drill bits are able to cut strong rock such as granite, which has not<br>
previously been possible with prior art drag bit drill bits.<br>
(ii) Cutting is more rapid due to a process of crack propagation and chip<br>
formation, producing macroscopic fragments, unlike the slower, microfracture<br>
process of rock cutting used by conventional diamond and PDC<br>
drill bits,<br>
(iii) It is possible to exploit the advantages of lacing the drag bits, which has<br>
not been possible with conventional tools utilising tungsten carbide drag<br>
bits due to the latter's larger size and their need to follow each other in<br>
the same groove during cutting,<br>
(iv) Smaller forces are required for a given excavation rate compared with<br>
prior art drill bits having tungsten carbide drag bits.<br>
(v) Similarly, excavation rates are higher for a given applied force than for<br>
prior art drill bits having tungsten carbide drag bits.<br>
(vi) The drill bits of the invention can excavate with a superior specific energy<br>
of excavation due to the production of macroscopic chips, as compared<br>
with conventional diamond and PDC drill bits.<br>
In order that the invention can be more readily understood, non-limiting<br>
embodiments thereof are now described with reference to the accompanying<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments as<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings, like reference numerals refer to like<br>
parts<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross section of a cutting element 10 comprising a<br>
pointed body 12 formed from ADC. The cutting element 10 comprises a base<br>
13, an elongate mounting portion 16, which is adapted to be received in the<br>
supporting matrix of a tool body (not shown) and a cutting portion 18 on which is<br>
provided the cutting surface or point 20. The cutting point 18 is ogival, or bullet<br>
shaped whereas the sides 24a, 24b of the mounting portion 16 taper inwardly<br>
from the base 13 to the cutting portion 18.<br>
In Figure 2, a pick 110 is illustrated which includes a cutting element 10<br>
comprising a pointed body 12 formed from ADC mounted in a pick body 14<br>
made from steel. The cutting element 12 includes the features as illustrated in<br>
Figure 1 which will not be repeated here. The elongate mounting portion 16 is<br>
mounted in a recess 17 in the pick body 14, and the cutting portion 18 protrudes<br>
from the recess 17 and carries thereon the cutting surface, or point 20.<br>
Bonding the cutting element 12 to the pick body 14 is a layer of metal<br>
matrix composite (MMC) material 22.<br>
The inner surface 19 of recess 17 is shaped so as to complement the<br>
shape of the mounting portion 16, with a sufficient gap therebetween to receive<br>
therein the MMC material. Given the large difference in the modulus of<br>
elasticity between steel and ADC, there is preferably no direct contact between<br>
the cutting element 12 and the pick body 14, but instead complete separation of<br>
the two by the intervening layer of MMC 22.<br>
The pick body 14 further includes a shank 26 for attachment to a tool<br>
holder.<br>
With reference to Figure 3, a saw 210 comprises a circular saw body 230<br>
having a plurality of cutting segments 232 spaced about its periphery thereby<br>
forming a cutting face 234. The saw body 230 has a central aperture 236 for<br>
mounting on a motor driven spindle (not shown) to thereby effect rotation about<br>
the axis X-X.<br>
Figure 3a shows the detail of a cutting segment 232. The cutting<br>
segment 232 includes an inner, circumferential channel 233 which is received<br>
on the peripheral edge of the saw body 230. The cutting segment 232<br>
comprises a plurality of cutting elements 10 (as illustrated in Figure 1) which are<br>
set in a supporting matrix 238 to thereby give the cutting face 234. The<br>
supporting matrix 238 is comprised of metal matrix composite material. The<br>
metal matrix composite material is suitably formed by using metallic powder<br>
sold as "Matrix Powders" by Kennametal. One such suitable powder is type P-<br>
75S Matrix Powder.<br>
The cutting elements 10 are "laced", that is they are arranged on the<br>
cutting face 240 such that as the saw 210 rotates, each cutting element 10<br>
exploits relieved cutting from other cutting elements 10 that it follows and it in<br>
turn provides relieved cutting opportunity for each of the following cutting<br>
elements 10. Moreover, each cutting element 10 is orientated such that in use,<br>
the angle between the surface of the rock being cut and the axis of the cutting<br>
element 18 is in the range of 60° to 80°.<br>
Figures 4 and 4a illustrate a variation on the saw embodiment of Figures<br>
3 and 3a. The principal difference between the respective saw embodiments of<br>
Figures 4 and 3 is that in Figure 4, the cutting face 234' is integral with, and<br>
circumferentially continuous about the periphery of, the saw body 230'. The<br>
saw 210' of Figure 4 is constructed by drilling apertures 231' directly into the<br>
saw body 210'. Figure 4a illustrates an aperture 231' in a partial cut-away view<br>
of the saw body 210'. The cutting elements 10 are placed into the apertures<br>
231' and arranged into the desired orientation using MMC to bond the cutting<br>
elements into place.<br>
Turning now to Figure 5, a coring drill bit 310 includes an annular drill bit<br>
body 350, having an inner wall 352 and an outer wall 354, and a plurality of<br>
cutting elements, or drag bits 10 mounted therein. The cutting elements 10 are<br>
illustrated in Figure 1. The drill bit body 350 includes a cutting face 356 at the<br>
leading end 358 and means for attachment to a drill string (not shown) at the<br>
trailing end 360. The cutting elements 10 are set in a supporting matrix 361<br>
provided at the cutting face 356. The matrix is comprised of a metal matrix<br>
composite material. The metal matrix composite material is suitably formed by<br>
using metallic powder sold as "Matrix Powder" by Kennametal. One such<br>
suitable powder is type P-75S Matrix Powder.<br>
The drill bit body 350 is also provided with drilling fluid channels 362 in<br>
the inner 352 and outer 354 walls of the drill bit body 350, for the passage of<br>
drilling fluid during use.<br>
Again, the cutting elements 10 are "laced", that is they are arranged on<br>
the cutting face 356 such that as the drill bit 310 rotates, each cutting element<br>
10 exploits relieved cutting from other cutting elements 10 that it follows and in<br>
turn provides relieved cutting opportunity for each of the following cutting<br>
elements 10. It is to be noted that despite the different orientations of the<br>
cutting elements, the axis A passing through the point of each cutting element<br>
10 is at an angle of approximately 70° to the axis of rotation X-X of the drill bit<br>
310.<br>
Finally, it is to be understood that various alterations, modifications<br>
and/or additions may be introduced into the constructions and arrangements of<br>
parts previously described without departing from the spirit or ambit of the<br>
invention.<br>
