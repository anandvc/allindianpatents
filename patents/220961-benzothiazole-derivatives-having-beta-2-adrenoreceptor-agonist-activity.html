The compounds represented by formulae I, II or III are capable of forming acid addition salts, particularly pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts. Pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I include those of inorganic acids, for example, hydrohalic acids such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or hydroiodic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid; and organic acids, for example aliphatic monocarboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid, aliphatic hydroxy acids such as lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or malic acid, dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid or succinic acid, aromatic carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid, p-chlorobenzoic acid, diphenylacetic acid or triphenylacetic acid, aromatic hydroxy acids such as o-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 1-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid or 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, and sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic acid or benzenesulfonic acid. These salts may be prepared from compounds of formula I by known salt-forming procedures.<br>
In formulae I, II and III, the carbon atom alpha to the phenolic ring carries a hydroxy group and so is asymmetric, so the compounds exist in individual optically active isomeric forms or as mixtures thereof, e.g. as racemic or diastereomeric mixtures. The invention embraces both<br><br>
individual optically active R and S isomers as well as mixtures, e.g. racemic or diastereomeric<br>
mixtures, thereof.<br>
Specific especially preferred compounds of formulae I, II or HI are those described hereinafter in the Examples.<br><br><br>

Where reference is made herein to protected functional groups or to protecting groups, the protecting groups may be chosen in accordance with the nature of the functional group, for example as described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, Second Edition, 1991, which reference also describes procedures suitable for replacement of the protecting groups by hydrogen.<br>
The protecting group R7 may be, for example, a group chosen from known amine-protecting groups. Preferred protecting groups R7 include araliphatic groups such as benzyl. Protecting groups R8 and R9 may be chosen from known phenolic hydroxy - and alcoholic hydroxy-<br><br>
protecting groups respectively. Preferred groups R8 and R9 include C1-C4-alkyl groups, particularly branched groups such as isopropyl and tert-butyl.<br>
Process variant (A) may be effected, for example, using known procedures for conversion of amine-protecting groups to hydrogen or analogous procedures. For example, where R7 is a benzyl group it may be converted to hydrogen by hydrogenolysis of the compound of formula II, e.g. with a carboxylic acid such as formic acid, preferably in the presence of a palladium catalyst. This de-protection reaction may be carried out using procedures as described hereinafter in the Examples or analogous procedures.<br>
Process variant (B) may be effected using known procedures for conversion of hydroxy-protecting groups to hydrogen or analogous procedures. For example, where, R8 and R9 are alkyl groups, R8 and R9 may be converted to hydrogen by hydrogenolysis of the compounds of formula IV, e.g. with a carboxylic acid such as formic acid preferably in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for example as hereinbefore described for conversion of R7 to hydrogen, or by treatment with an acid alone such as formic acid, hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid, in either case the resulting 2-hydroxybenzothiazole compound being in tautomeric equilibrium with the benzothiazol-2-one form.<br><br>
where X and R7 are as hereinbefore defined. The reduction may be effected using known methods for reduction of ketones to alcohols, or analogous methods, including asymmetric reductions. For example, the compounds of formula VI may be reacted with NaBHU in an inert solvent such as an aliphatic alcohol. Suitable reaction temperatures are from -80° C to 100° C, conveniently from -5° C to 5° C. The reduction may be effected using known procedures or analogously as described hereinafter in the Examples.<br>
Compounds of formula V may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VII<br><br><br>
where X and R7 are as hereinbefore defined. The reaction of compounds of formulae VII and VIII may be effected using known procedures for epoxide-amine reactions or analogous procedures. The reaction is optionally effected in an inert organic solvent, conveniently an alcohol such a n-butanol. Suitable reaction temperatures are, for example, from 0° C to solvent reflux temperature. The reaction may be effected conveniently using a procedure as described hereinafter in the Examples, or analogously.<br><br>
where X, R7 , R8 and R9 are as hereinbefore described, with concentrated hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent such as an aliphatic alcohol.<br>
Compounds of formula VII and VIII may be prepared by known methods or analogously such as hereinafter described in the Examples.<br>
Compounds of formula IX may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula X<br><br><br>
where Q is fluorine or chlorine and R8 and R9 are as hereinbefore defined, with a strong base, such as an alkyllithium, NaNH2 or potassium tert-butoxide or a mixture of two or more<br><br>
where X and R7 are as hereinbefore defined. The reaction is preferably effected in an inert organic solvent, for example an ether such as tetrahydrofuran (THF). Suitable reaction temperatures may be, for example, from -80° C to 80° C. The reaction may be effected using a procedure as described hereinafter in the Examples or analogous procedures.<br>
Compounds of formulae X and XI may be prepared using known procedures or analogously, such as described hereinafter in the Examples.<br>
Compounds of formula I in free form may be converted into salt form, and vice versa, in a conventional manner. The compounds in free or salt form can be obtained in the form of hydrates or solvates containing a solvent used for crystallisation. Compounds of formula I can be recovered from reaction mixtures and purified in a conventional manner. Isomers, such as enantiomers, may be obtained in a conventional manner, e.g. by fractional crystallisation or asymmetric synthesis from correspondingly asymmetrically substituted, e.g. optically active, starting materials.<br>
Compounds of formula I in free or salt or solvate form are useful as pharmaceuticals.<br>
Accordingly the invention also provides a compound of formula I in free or salt form for use as a pharmaceutical. The compounds of formula I in free or salt form, hereinafter referred to alternatively as "agents of the invention", have good P2-adrenoreceptor agonist activity. The P2 agonist activity, onset of action and duration of action of the agents of the invention may be tested using the guinea pig tracheal strip in vitro assay according to the procedure of R.A.<br><br>
Coleman and A. T. Nials, J. Pharmacol. Methods (1989), 21(1), 71-86. The binding potency can be measured by a classical filtration binding assay according to the procedure of Current Protocols in Pharmacology (S. J. Enna et al, John Wiley 8t Son, Inc, 1998), or by cAMP determination in cells expressing ^-adrenoceptor, according to the procedure of B. January et al, British J. Pharmacol. 123: 701-711 (1998). For example, the compounds of Examples 1, 3, 4, 5 and 79 hereinbelow have Ki (p2) values of 0.3 nM, 1.6 nM, 18.8 nM, 14.8 nM and 2.5 nM respectively.<br>
The agents of the invention commonly have a rapid onset of action and have a prolonged stimulating action on the P2-adrenoceptor, compounds of the Examples herein below having durations of action of the order of up to 24 hours. The compounds of Examples 4 and 5 have T(50%) times (in minutes) of 403 and 326 respectively at 10 nM concentration in the guinea pig tracheal strip assay, where T(50%) is the time for inhibition of contraction to decay to 50% of its maximum value.<br>
Having regard to their P2 agonist activity, the agents of the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of any condition which is prevented or alleviated by activation of the P2-adreno-receptor. In view of their long acting P2 agonist activity, the agents of the invention are useful in the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and the relief of bronchoconstriction. Relief of bronchoconstriction can be measured in models such as the in vivo plethysmography models of Chong et al, J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods 1998, 39, 163-168, Hammelmann et al, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 1997, 156, 766-775 and analogous models. The agents of the invention are therefore useful in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases.<br>
In view of their long duration of action, it is possible to administer the agents of the invention once-a-day in the treatment of such diseases. In another aspect, agents of the invention commonly exhibit characteristics indicating a low incidence of side effects commonly encountered with P2 agonists such as tachycardia, tremor and restlessness, such agents accordingly being suitable for use in on demand (rescue) treatment as well as prophylactic treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases. The incidence of side effects may be determined, for example, as described by J. R. Fozard et ah, Pulmonary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics (2000) 14, 289-295.<br><br>
Treatment of a disease in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic treatment. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti-inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping". "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include acute lung injury (ALI), adult/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary, airways or lung disease (COPD, COAD or COLD), including chronic bronchitis, or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croupus, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br><br>
Having regard to their P2 agonist activity, the agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of a condition requiring relaxation of smooth muscle of the uterus or vascular system. They are thus useful for the prevention or alleviation of premature labour pains in pregnancy. They are also useful in the treatment of chronic and acute urticaria, psoriasis, rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, actinitis, hay fever, and mastocytosis. The agents of the invention are also useful as co-therapeutic agents for use in combination with other drug substances such as anti-inflammatory, bronchodilatory or antihistamine drug substances, particularly in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases such as those mentioned hereinbefore, for example as potentiators of therapeutic activity of such drugs or as a means of reducing required dosaging or potential side effects of such drugs. An agent of the invention may be mixed with the other drug substance in a fixed pharmaceutical composition or it may be administered separately, before, simultaneously with or after the other drug substance. Such anti-inflammatory drugs include steroids, in particular glucocorticosteroids such as budesonide, beclamethasone, fluticasone, ciclesonide or mometasone or steroids described in WO 0200679 especially those of Examples 3,11, 14,17, 19, 26, 34, 37, 39, 51, 60, 67, 72, 73, 90, 99 and 101, LTB4 antagonists such as those described in US 5451700, LTD4 antagonists such as montelukast and zafirlukast, and PDE4 inhibitors such as Ariflo®(GlaxoSmith Kline), Roflumilast (Byk Gulden),V-11294A (Napp), BAY19-8004 (Bayer), SCH-351591 (Schering-Plough), Arofylline (Almirall Prodesfarma), PD189659 (Parke-Davis), AWD-12-281 (Asta Medica), CDC-801 (Celgene) and KW-4490 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo) and A2a agonists such as those described in EP 1052264, EP 1241176, WO 0023457, WO0077018, WO 0123399, WO 0160835, WO 0194368, WO 0200676, WO 0222630, WO 0296462, WO 0127130, WO 0127131, WO 9602543, WO 9602553, WO 9828319, WO 9924449, WO 9924450, WO 9924451, WO 9938877, WO 9941267, WO 9967263, WO 9967264, WO 9967265, WO 9967266, WO 9417090, EP 409595A2 and WO 0078774 and A2b antagonists such as those described in WO 02/42298. Such bronchodilatory drugs include anticholinergic or antimuscarinic agents, in particular ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and tiotropium bromide, but also those described in EP 424021, US 5171744 (Pfizer) and WO 01/04118 (Almirall Prodesfarma).<br>
The agents of the invention are also useful as co-therapeutic agents for use in combination other beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists, for example as a rescue medication. Suitable beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists include salbutamol, terbutaline, salmeterol and, especially, formoterol and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and compounds (in free or salt or solvate form) of formula I of PCT International patent publication No. WO 00/75114, which document is<br><br><br>
Co-therapeutic antihistamine drug substances include cetirizine hydrochloride, acetaminophen, clemastine fumarate, promethazine, loratidine, desloratidine, diphenhydramine and fexofenadine hydrochloride.<br>
Combinations of agents of the invention and steroids, beta-2 agonists, PDE4 inhibitors or LTD4 antagonists may be used, for example, in the treatment of COPD or, particularly, asthma. Combinations of agents of the invention and anticholinergic or antimuscarinic agents, PDE4 inhibitors, dopamine receptor agonists or LTB4 antagonists may be used, for example, in the treatment of asthma or, particularly, COPD.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention also provides a method for the treatment of an obstructive or inflammatory airways disease which comprises administering to a subject, particularly a human subject, in need thereof an effective amount a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as hereinbefore described. In another aspect, the invention provides a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as hereinbefore described for use in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of an obstructive or inflammatory airways disease.<br>
The agents of the invention may be administered by any appropriate route, e.g. orally, for example in the form of a tablet or capsule; parenterally, for example intravenously; topically to the skin, for example in the treatment of psoriasis; intranasally, for example in the treatment of hay fever; or, preferably, by inhalation, particularly in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising as active ingredient a compound of formula I in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically<br><br>
acceptable salt or solvate thereof, optionally together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor. Such compositions may be prepared using conventional diluents or excipients and techniques known in the galenic art. Thus oral dosage forms may include tablets and capsules. Formulations for topical administration may take the form of creams, ointments, gels or transdermal delivery systems, e.g. patches. Compositions for inhalation may comprise aerosol or other atomizable formulations.<br>
When the composition comprises an aerosol formulation, it preferably contains, for example, a hydro-fluoro-alkane (HFA) propellant such as HFA134a or HFA227 or a mixture of these, and may contain one or more co-solvents known in the art such as ethanol (up to 20% by weight), and/or one or more surfactants such as oleic acid or sorbitan trioleate, and/or one or more bulking agents such as lactose. When the composition comprises a dry powder formulation, it preferably contains, for example, the compound of formula I having a particle diameter up to 10 microns, optionally together with a diluent or carrier, such as lactose, of the desired particle size distribution and a compound that helps to protect against product performance deterioration due to moisture. When the composition comprises a nebulised formulation, it preferably contains, for example, the compound of formula I either dissolved, or suspended, in a vehicle containing water, a co-solvent such as ethanol or propylene glycol and a stabiliser, which may be a surfactant.<br>
The invention also includes (A) a compound of formula I as hereinbefore described in free form, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, in inhalable form; (B) an inhalable medicament comprising such a compound in inhalable form together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in inhalable form; (C) a pharmaceutical product comprising such a compound in inhalable form in association with an inhalation device; and (D) an inhalation device containing such a compound in inhalable form.<br>
Dosages employed in practising the invention will of course vary depending, for example, on the particular condition to be treated, the effect desired and the mode of administration. In general, suitable daily dosages for administration by inhalation are of the order of from 0.1 to 5000 μg<br>
