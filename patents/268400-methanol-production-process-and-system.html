CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to United States Provisional Application No.<br>
60/809,260 filed May 30,2006, which is hereby incorporated in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] This invention relates to a process and system for production of methanol. More<br>
specifically, the invention includes a process and a system for producing methanol from<br>
combining a synthesis gas containing inerts, notably, nitrogen with a hydrogen-rich gas stream,<br>
and subsequently converting the hydrogen-rich synthesis gas stream to methanol, or other<br>
hydrocarbon chemicals. Even more specifically, the invention relates to such processes and<br>
systems capable of being mounted and operated on seagoing vessels, as well as on land.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003] The evolution of methanol synthesis started at the beginning of the 20th century and<br>
reached commercialization in the mid 1920s. The reactants for methanol synthesis were H2, CO,<br>
and CO2, and this mixture was named "synthesis gas" or "syn gas." A stoichiometric mixture<br>
when passed through a catalyst bed, only reacted 12% of these reactants because the reaction was<br>
stopped by reaching equilibrium with the methanol generated by the reaction. The industry<br>
adopted the use of a recycle system, known as a "methanol loop," as a solution. The reacted<br>
gases from the catalyst bed were cooled, methanol condensed out, and the remaining gases re-<br>
circulated through the inlet to the catalyst bed. This system had the advantage of absorbing the<br>
exothermic heat generated at the catalyst site and carrying the heat to external heat exchangers.<br>
Up to 95% of the reactants were converted to methanol by this technique. This has been used in<br>
virtually all development of methanol synthesis during the last 80 years.<br><br>
[0004] There are disadvantages of this system. The methanol loop placed a restriction on the<br>
purity of the syn gas. Consequently, inerts fed into the methanol loop with the syn gas had to be<br>
purged from die loop just after the methanol was condensed out. The purged inerts were<br>
intimately mixed with the valuable reactants, which were lost when purged along with the inerts.<br>
The prior art solution to this problem was to reduce the amount of inerts to as little as possible<br>
during syn gas preparation.<br>
[0005] Modern practice in high capacity plants is to use an autothermal reformer ("ATR") to<br>
prepare the syn gas. The device mixes an oxygen containing gas stream with a natural gas stream<br>
to partially oxidize the natural gas in the top of the reformer vessel. The lower portion of the<br>
reformer vessel contains a catalyst, which brings the oxidized gases into chemical equilibrium.<br>
The major ingredient in natural gas is methane, which is converted to syn gas and H2O.<br>
[0006] Use of an ATR is also problematic because inerts are introduced into the natural gas<br>
stream along with the oxygen. To combat this problem, a cryogenic air separation ("C-ASU")<br>
was utilized to produce oxygen with the lowest possible inerts, generally between about 1% to<br>
5%. The majority of the inerts were N2 and AÎ“. Currently, there are no viable alternative<br>
processes for producing oxygen at large capacity and purity in this range. Cryogenic air<br>
separation is a difficult process to operate, has high maintenance and has a history of catastrophic<br>
explosions. Additionally, the CH4 in the reformer vessel outlet acts as an inert in the methanol<br>
loop. Therefore, furnaces and reformers were operated at temperatures on the extreme upper<br>
limits of metal and ceramic materials to minimize the CH4 remaining in the syn gas. For these<br>
reasons, the designs were expensive and consumed up to 80% of the overall plant energy.<br>
[0007] Over the last 80 years, this approach has taken its toll in capital costs of the synthesis<br>
gas production portion of methanol plants.<br><br>

[0008] Prior art methanol production processes include those manufactured and sold by<br>
Lurgi AG of Frankfort, Germany. Such prior art Lurgi systems have been disclosed, for<br>
example, in European Patent 0790226 Bl, US Patent 5,631,302 and US Patent 5,827,901, which<br>
are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Similar systems utilizing a methanol<br>
loop include those used by ICI and Holder-Topsoe, including those systems described in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos.: 6,387,963 6,881,759, 6,730,285, 6,191,175, 5,937,631 and 5,262,443, and<br>
United Kingdom Patent Nos.: 1,159,035 and 1,272,798, which are all hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in their entireties.<br>
[0009] Synthesis gas has also been manufactured from oxidant streams high in nitrogen, such<br>
as air. Such processes have used separation processes, such as semi-permeable membrane<br>
technology, to separate air streams into high oxygen content streams and high nitrogen content<br>
streams. The high oxygen content streams were then reacted with natural gas to create synthesis<br>
gas, which was then converted to methanol.<br>
[0010] Special reaction systems had to be developed because the high nitrogen content in the<br>
synthesis gas stream created problems in conventional methanol production processes by<br>
limiting the yield and the effectiveness of the methanol reactors. Such processes are disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent Numbers 5,472,986 and 7,019,039, which are hereby incorporated by reference in<br>
their entireties. These patents are assigned to Starchem Technologies, Inc. and the methanol<br>
production processes described therein are generally referred to herein as the "Starchem system."<br>
In the Starchem system, a reactor recycle stream (methanol loop) was not used because of<br>
problems associated with the high nitrogen content As such, a series of single pass reactors<br>
were required.<br><br>
[0011] Similarly, European Patent Application 0 261 771 proposed the use of air for<br>
production of a high nitrogen content synthesis gas which, thereafter, would be processed<br>
through a series of plug flow methanol reactors with interstage removal of methanol and water.<br>
As such, a series of single pass reactors were required, just as in the Starchem system.<br>
[0012] The ATR and the methanol loop are not compatible without modifications. This can<br>
be explained in terms of the stoichiometric number ("Ns") defined as Ns = (H2 - CO2)/ (CO +<br>
CO2).<br>
[0013] Ns is commonly used as a measure of how syn gas will perform in the methanol loop.<br>
A number greater than 2 indicates an excess of hydrogen over that required for conversion of all<br>
the carbon to methanol. A number less than 2 indicates a hydrogen deficiency. The methanol loop<br>
may become in-operable when deficient in hydrogen. Make up gas ("MUG") is the name of the<br>
gas injected into the methanol loop. Experience has shown that a MUG with Ns =2.05 produces<br>
the most efficient and lowest capital cost methanol loop design.<br>
[0014] A characteristic of an ATR is the reformed syngas has an Ns of about 1.75. The<br>
traditional approach has been to add hydrogen to the effluent of the ATR to increase the Ne of the<br>
MUG stream to about 2.05. The source of hydrogen has been from fired steam methane<br>
reforming or from refineries. More recently, the Ns has been increased by rejecting CO2 from the<br>
gas mixture as in Starchem's U.S. Pat. 7,019,039 for a series of single pass reactors.<br>
[0015] It would be desirable to utilize prior art methanol production systems that include a<br>
methanol loop, with a synthesis gas produced through partial oxidation of natural gas using an air<br>
stream, such as the Starchem system. U.K. Patent Application 2,237,287A and Australian Patent<br>
AU-B-6459390 ("the AUS Process") describe the use of a synthesis gas formed from an oxygen<br>
enriched gas stream for the partial oxidation of natural gas and the use of a methanol loop reactor<br>
system for methanol production. In the AUS Process, a portion of the synthesis gas is not subject<br>
to the methanol synthesis loop. Rather, the synthesis gas is split into two distinct streams, stream<br>
"A" and stream "B," upon leaving the ATR. The "A" stream is diverted to a water gas shift<br>
reactor, converting CO to H2, and then through a pressure swing absorber ('TSA") to extract the<br><br>
H2. The H2 that has been extracted joins the "B" stream and the combined flow is a hydrogen<br>
enhanced syn gas. This method is less than desirable because of the need for additional<br>
equipment for the extraction of the H2 and the diversion of some of the synthesis gas, which<br>
results in a reduction in potential methanol production.<br>

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020] The present invention is a process and a system for creating methanol from synthesis<br>
gas. The synthesis gas is a stream containing H2, CO, N2 and CO=, generated from a N2<br>
containing oxygen stream, such as air. The synthesis gas stream is reacted through a methanol<br>
loop system to create methanol. A specific embodiment of the present invention combines the<br>
Starchem system for creating synthesis gas, utilizing an air stream with the conventional<br>
methanol loop system for reacting synthesis gas to create a methanol stream, while avoiding<br>
prior art concerns of efficiency and methanol yield resulting from the presence of nitrogen in the<br>
system. Another specific embodiment of the present invention is a methanol production process<br>
such as described herein, which can be mounted and operated on a seagoing vessel, as well as on<br>
land.<br><br>
[0021] In one aspect, the invention provides a process for producing methanol, comprising the<br>
steps of providing a synthesis gas stream comprising H2, CO, and CO2, and N2, wherein the<br>
synthesis gas stream comprises at least about 6 mole% N2 and wherein the synthesis gas stream<br>
comprises H2, CO, and CO2 in a ratio of (H2-CO2)/ (CO2 +CO), which is less than about 1.80.<br>
The synthesis gas stream is then combined with a hydrogen-rich gas stream to form a makeup<br>
gas stream, which is then combined with a recycle gas stream to produce a reactor feed stream.<br>
The reactor feed stream is introduced into a reactor system containing a methanol conversion<br>
catalyst, wherein a portion of the reactor feed stream is converted to methanol. A reacted gas<br>
stream is withdrawn from the reactor system and the reacted gas stream is separated into a crude<br>
methanol product stream and a gas stream. The gas stream is split into a recycle gas stream and<br>
a purge gas stream. The recycle gas stream is mixed with the makeup gas stream to form the<br>
reactor feed stream. The purge gas stream is then separated into a fuel gas stream comprising<br>
CH4 and N2 and a hydrogen-rich stream comprising H2, and the hydrogen-rich stream is mixed<br>
into the synthesis gas stream.<br>
[0022] In another aspect of the invention, a similar process for converting a natural gas to<br>
methanol is provided. The process includes providing an air stream having an oxygen content<br>
less than about 22% and enhancing the oxygen content of the air stream to between about 28%<br>
and 94% oxygen, thereby creating an enhanced oxygen stream. A natural gas stream comprising<br>
methane is then provided and the natural gas stream is partially oxidized in an autothermal<br>
reformer using the enhanced oxygen stream to create a synthesis gas stream comprising H2, CO,<br>
and CO2 and N2. The synthesis gas stream is then combined with a hydrogen-rich gas stream to<br>
form a makeup gas stream, wherein the synthesis gas stream composition remains substantially<br>
unchanged after exiting the autothermal reformer until combined with the hydrogen-rich gas<br>
stream. The makeup gas stream is combined with a recycle gas stream to produce a reactor feed<br>
stream, which is introduced into a reactor system containing a methanol conversion catalyst;<br>
wherein a portion of the reactor feed stream is converted to methanol. A reacted gas stream is<br>
then withdrawn from the reactor system and separated into a crude methanol product stream and<br>
a gas stream. The gas stream is split into a recycle gas stream and a purge gas stream. The<br>
recycle gas stream is combined with the makeup gas stream to form the reactor teed stream. The<br><br>
purge gas stream is separated into a fuel gas stream comprising CH4 and N2 and a hydrogen-rich<br>
stream comprising H2, and the hydrogen-rich stream is mixed into the synthesis gas stream.<br>
[0023] In yet another aspect of the invention, a process is provided for producing methanol that<br>
comprises the steps of providing an air stream having an oxygen content less than about 22% and<br>
enhancing the oxygen content of the air stream to between about 28% and 94% oxygen, thereby<br>
creating an enhanced oxygen stream. A natural gas stream is provided that comprises methane.<br>
The natural gas is partially oxidized in an autotheimal reformer using the enhanced oxygen<br>
stream to create a synthesis gas stream comprising H2, CO, and CO2, and N2. At least about 90%<br>
of the synthesis gas stream is men combined with a hydrogen-rich gas stream to form a makeup<br>
gas stream, which is combined with a recycle gas stream to produce a reactor feed stream. The<br>
reactor feed stream is introduced into a reactor system containing a methanol conversion catalyst,<br>
wherein a portion of the reactor feed stream is converted to methanol. A reacted gas stream is<br>
withdrawn from the reactor system, which is separated into a crude methanol product stream and<br>
a gas stream. The gas stream is split into a recycle gas. stream and a purge gas stream. The<br>
recycle gas stream is men mixed with the makeup gas stream to form the reactor feed stream.<br>
The purge gas stream is separated into a fuel gas stream comprising CH4 and N2 and a hydrogen-<br>
rich stream comprising H2, and the hydrogen-rich stream is mixed into the synthesis gas stream.<br>

comprises the steps of providing a synthesis gas stream comprising H2, CO, and CO2 and N2.<br>
wherein the synthesis gas stream comprises at least about 16 mole% N2 and wherein the<br>

rich stream comprising H2. and the hydrogen-rich stream is mixed into the synthesis gas stream.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0025] In me present invention, the Starchem system for creating synthesis gas from the<br>
oxidation of natural gas using an air or other oxygen-containing stream is combined with a<br>
traditional methanol loop system. The present invention overcomes prior art concerns of using<br>
nitrogen containing synthesis gas in the traditional methanol loop system.<br>
[00261 Starchem systems such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,472,986 and U.S. Patent<br>
7,019,039 Bl ("Starchem Patents") include processes for creating synthesis gas using an air<br>
stream, or other oxygen and nitrogen containing stream, separating the air stream into high<br>
oxygen and low oxygen content streams, and utilizing the high oxygen content stream in a partial<br>
oxidation reaction with natural gas to create a synthesis gas containing H2, CO and CO2. The<br>
Starchem Patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.<br>
[0027] FIG 1 discloses the present invention in a simple form. Synthesis gas stream 212,<br>
which contains at least about 6 mole% nitrogen, is combined with a hydrogen-rich gas stream<br>
214 to form a make up gas ("MUG") stream 216, which has a stoichiometric number greater than<br>
2.0s. Ns is used as a measure of how the syn gas will perform in the methanol loop. As such, it is<br>
commonly treated as a property of the syn gas. A number greater than 2 indicates excess<br>
hydrogen and a number less than 2 indicates a hydrogen deficiency. Excess hydrogen in the<br>
methanol loop increases the reaction rate and concurrently reduces the rate of formation of<br>
byproducts. It should be noted, however, that the synthesis gas stream may be produced by any<br>
means in accordance with the invention.<br>
[0028] In a specific embodiment of the invention, the synthesis gas stream 212 contains at<br>
least about 8 mole% nitrogen. In another specific embodiment of the invention, the synthesis gas<br><br>
stream 212 contains at least about 20 mole% nitrogen. In a more specific embodiment of the<br>
invention, the synthesis gas stream 212 contains at least about 35 mole% nitrogen.<br>
[0029] The makeup gas stream 216 is further combined with a recycle gas stream 218 to<br>
produce a reactor feed stream 220. Feed stream 220 is introduced into reactor vessel 222, which<br>
contains a methanol conversion catalyst.<br>
[0030] A portion of the reactor feed stream 220 is then converted into methanol. The reacted<br>
gas stream containing methanol 224 is withdrawn from the reactor system and separated into a<br>
crude liquid methanol product stream 228 and gas stream 230. The gas stream 230 is then split<br>
into two streams, the first stream being the recycle gas stream 218, which is combined with the<br>
makeup gas stream 216 to form the reactor feed stream 220. The second portion is a purge gas<br>
stream 236. The purge gas stream 236 is separated into two streams, the fuel gas stream 234,<br>
which contains CH4, CO, and CO2 and N2, and a hydrogen-rich gas stream 214. The hydrogen-<br>
rich gas stream 214 is then mixed into the synthesis gas stream 212 to form the makeup gas<br>
stream 216.<br>
[0031] Fig. 2 discloses a specific embodiment of the invention. The process begins by providing<br>
an air stream 200. Air stream 200 is preferably a compressed air stream having an oxygen<br>
content of less than about 22%. Air stream 200 is introduced into a separation system, which<br>
yields an enriched oxygen stream 206 comprising at least about 28% oxygen. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the oxygen content of the air stream is enhanced to between about<br>
35% to about 50%, thereby creating an enhanced oxygen stream. In a specific embodiment,<br>
enriched oxygen stream 206 contains at least about 42% oxygen. In another specific<br>
embodiment, the enriched oxygen stream 206 has an oxygen content of approximately 70%. In a<br>
further embodiment of the invention, the oxygen content of the air stream is enhanced to between<br>
about 28% to about 70%, thereby creating an enhanced oxygen stream. The separation system<br>
may comprise a semi-permeable membrane, a PSA, or other similar system. Alternatively, the<br>
air stream may be enhanced by mixing in oxygen created from a C-ASU unit, or from other<br>
known oxygen purification systems, to produce enriched air 206. It should be noted, however,<br>
that the synthesis gas stream may be produced by any means in accordance with the invention.<br><br>
[0032] A natural gas stream containing methane 210 is partially oxidized in an ATR using an<br>
enhanced oxygen stream 206 to create synthesis gas stream 212. In one embodiment .of the<br>
invention, the partial oxidizing step creates a synthesis gas stream 212 containing H2, CO, and<br>
CO2 in a stoichiometric number of (H2-CO2)/ (CO2 +CO), which is less than about 1.80; i.e., it is<br>
deficient in hydrogen. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the synthesis gas stream 212 is<br>
created that has a stoichiometric number of about 1.77. In another specific embodiment of the<br>
invention, a synthesis gas 212 is created that has a stoichiometric number of about 1.73. In yet<br>
another specific embodiment of the invention, a synthesis gas stream is formed that has a number<br>
in the range of about 1.34 and about 1.80<br>
[0033] In a further embodiment of the invention, when hydrogen is extracted from the purge<br>
gas stream 236 to form a hydrogen rich stream 214 that is combined with hydrogen poor<br>
synthesis gas 212 and recycle gas 218, a reactor feed gas 220 is produced in the reactor 222 with<br>
a stoichiometric number between about 2.05 and about 10.<br>
[0034] A portion of the reactor feed stream is converted into methanol. The reacted gas 224,<br>
which contains methanol, is withdrawn from the reactor vessel 222 and separated into crude<br>
liquid methanol product stream 228 and gas stream 230. The gas stream 230 is then split into<br>
two streams, the first stream being recycle gas stream 218, which is combined with the makeup<br>
gas stream 216 to form the reactor feed gas stream 220. The second portion is a purge gas<br>
stream 236. The purge gas stream 236 is separated into two streams, the fuel gas stream 234,<br>
which contains CH4, CO, and CO2 and N2, and a hydrogen-rich gas stream 214. The hydrogen-<br>
rich stream 214 is then mixed into the synthesis gas stream.<br>
[0035] Using the synthesis gas production method disclosed in FIG 2, the synthesis gas<br>
stream will generally comprise approximately 19% nitrogen. In some embodiments, however,<br>
the nitrogen content will be in the range of about 6% to about 50%. The present invention<br>
permits extremely high levels of inerts to be carried into the methanol loop contrary to 80 years<br>
of industry practice. The large quantity of reactants in the significantly increased purge stream<br>
are separated from the inert portion of the purge stream and returned to be mixed with the<br><br>
incoming syn gas. This allows a large purge without the loss of valuable reactants. Among other<br>
processes, the separation can be done by membranes or PSA.<br>
[00361 As discussed above, a method has been previously disclosed wherein methanol is<br>
produced by contacting a synthesis gas formed from an oxygen-enriched gas stream for the<br>
partial oxidation of natural gas using a methanol loop reactor system. There are key distinctions,<br>
however, between this prior art system and the invention described and claimed herein. In the<br>
prior art system, a portion of the synthesis gas is not subjected to the methanol production<br>
synthesis loop. Rather, the synthesis gas is split into two distinct streams on leaving the ATR.<br>
The first, stream is diverted to a water gas shift reactor, converting CO to H2, and then through a<br>
pressure swing absorber to extract the H2. The H2 that has been distracted joins the second<br>
stream and the combined flow is a hydrogen enhanced syn gas with a Ng equal to about 1.85.<br>
Since the extraction of the H2 requires the use of additional equipment, one skilled in the art will<br>
recognize that the elimination of this extraction step results in a methanol production process that<br>
is more efficient and more economical. Additionally, the total methanol yield from the AUS<br>
process is lowered by the additional purge required as a result of the additional process<br>
equipment.<br>
[00371 In a specific embodiment of the present invention, the syn gas comprises about 19<br>
mole% nitrogen and the methanol loop is operated with a high level of H2. The reactor feed gas,<br>
therefore, has a stoichiometric number of about 3.3. The excess H2 reacts to maintain the CO at a<br>
very low level, i.e., about 3.8 mol%. Thus, there is very little CO in the purge gas. This enables<br>
the mols of CO in the fuel gas to be maintained at a value less than 10% of the CO entering the<br>
system in the synthesis gas. Similarly, the H2 is separated from the purge stream leaving behind<br>
in the fuel gas an amount of fife that is less than 3.5% of the H2 entering the system in the<br>
synthesis gas. The sum of the mols of reactants (H2 + CO) leaving the system in the fuel gas is<br>
about 5% of that entering the system as syn gas. The CO2 mat has not reacted with H2-in the<br>
methanol loop will leave the system in the fuel gas. This amounts to about 15% of the CO2<br>
entering the system in the synthesis gas. The retention of H2 in the methanol loop, reacting the<br><br>
CO to low values and rejecting carbon from the system as CO2, will always result in a MUG<br>
stoichiometric number greater than 2.05.<br>
[0038] A prime benefit of the use of air separation systems is that they allow an alternative to<br>
cryogenic oxygen, which significantly reduces the costs associated with the preparation of the<br>
synthesis gases. The presence of cryogenic oxygen along with large quantities of methanol<br>
creates an extremely hazardous and potentially explosive situation, particularly when there is<br>
limited space available, such as on a sea going vessel. The present invention avoids this hazard<br>
and allows marine application. All of the embodiments of the invention may be practiced on a<br>
seagoing vessel in accordance with the invention. The process can be implemented and<br>
completely contained on a ship, barge, or other seagoing vessel. As such, the invention can be<br>
brought to natural gas production areas, such as those at offshore production facilities, to convert<br>
the abundant natural gas into methanol. The methanol can then be periodically transferred from<br>
its seagoing vessel to tankers for transportation to the market. The nominal capacity of the<br>
methods of the present invention is approximately 5000 to 15000 metric tons per day ("MTPD")-<br>
[0039] The Ns the MUG stream can be controlled by the methanol loop design parameters.<br>
When the loop pressure is held constant by a back pressure controller in the fuel gas stream or<br>
varying the power to the MUG compressor, the inerts will leave the system in the fuel gas<br>
stream. In addition, there will be some H2 and CO and a major amount of CO2 leaving in the fuel<br>
gas.<br>
[0040] In one embodiment of the invention, the MUG comprises H2, CO and CO2 in a ratio<br>
of (H2-CO2)/ (CO2+CO), which is at least about 2.05. hi another embodiment of the invention,<br>
the MUG comprises H2, CO, and CO2 in a ratio of (H2-CO2)/ (CO2+CO), which is at least about<br>
2.4. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the MUG comprises H2, CO, and CO2 in a ratio<br>
of (H2-CO2)/ (CO2+CO), which is at least about 3.6.<br>
[0041] Although the invention has been described with reference to its various embodiments,<br>
from this description, those skilled in the art may appreciate changes and modifications thereto,<br>
which do not depart from the scope and spirit of the invention as described herein and claimed<br><br>
hereafter. The following Examples illustrate certain embodiments of the invention, in<br>
comparison to the AUS Process. The Examples illustrate specific embodiments of the invention,<br>
and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
[0042] The impact of the amount of nitrogen in the methanol loop in the methods of the<br>
invention on the amount of methanol produced per pound of natural gas was calculated. With<br>
reference to Table 1, below, the calculation was performed assuming a concentration of 42%<br>
oxygen, 21% oxygen and 70% oxygen in the air stream shown in FIG 2. The ATR temperature<br>
was maintained at 1820Â° F. The results are shown below in Table 1.<br><br><br>
[0043] The results show the level of oxygen enrichment has an insignificant effect on the<br>
stoichiometric number of the effluent from the ATR. It is less than 1.77. Table 1 demonstrates<br>
that the process shown in FIG 1 will produce a MUG with stoichiometric number greater than<br>
about 2.05 when supplied with syn gas containing nitrogen greater than about 7.6 mot %. When<br>
the nitrogen is discharged from the methanol loop, excess carbon in the form of CO2 is<br>
discharged along with it leaving the hydrogen in surplus in the methanol loop.<br>
[0044] The methanol made per pound of natural gas increased 15 % when the oxygen<br>
concentration increased from 21 % to 42 %. However, the increase in methanol was only 2.5 %<br>
when the oxygen increased from 42 % to 70 %.<br>
EXAMPLE II<br>
[0045] With reference to FIGS. 3 and 4 the methanol production process described in the<br>
AUS Process was used to produce methanol using an Aspen process simulator. Aspen standard<br>
data was used, including equilibrium constants out of the ATR and the methanol reactors (35Â° F<br>
approach), as well as membrane and PSA efficiencies.<br>
[0046] Parameters for the study were from the Starchem Plantship analysis performed by<br>
Lurgi. The parameters dictated the natural gas and air flow rates, steam/carbon, pressures,<br>
cooling water temperatures, etc. A water quench to 500Â°F out of the ATR was used when flow<br>
was into path A. Quench is necessary to avoid metal dusting and provide steam for the water gas<br>
shift. For calculations with zero flow into path A, also known as the H2 extraction stream, no<br>
quench was used.<br>
[0047] Two sessions were performed. The first involved varying the percentage of flow into<br>
path A in 10% increments. It was found that any amount of flow into path A resulted in a<br>
decreasing methanol yield as the flow increased. The second session involved increasing the<br>
efficiency of H2 separation in path A from 70% to 85%.<br><br>
[0048] The results from the second session are shown in FIG 4. The syn gas, after combining<br>
with stream A, had a stoichiometric number of 1.85 and the MUG stoichiometric number was<br>
2.8. The production of methanol decreased as flow was increased into path A. As illustrated, one<br>
embodiment of the processes of the invention, i.e. zero flow into path A, produced more<br>
methanol than the AUS Process.<br>
[0049] The total amount of inerts that must be purged from the process is the same in both<br>
the AUS Process and the methods of the invention describe herein. The purge from path A,<br>
however, always has a higher concentration of reactants (H2 + CO) than the purge from the<br>
methanol loop. Thus, more reactants that could be converted to methanol are lost when mere is<br>
flow into path A. When path A is utilized, methanol is produced at a rate of 997,948 1b/hr. As<br>
the amount of synthesis gas diverted to path A is increased, however, the amount of methanol<br>
produced decreases. When path A diverts 30% of the synthesis gas, methanol is produced at a<br>
rate of only 942,306 1b/hr., which is an at least 5% decrease.<br>
[0050] The method of control of the invention described and claimed herein renders the AUS<br>
Process split of synthesis gas into two streams totally unnecessary and, in fact, harmful to the<br>
methanol yield. One stream in AUS Process has the hydrogen content enhanced by water gas<br>
shift and rejects nitrogen and CO2. In the present methods of the invention, the water gas shift<br>
occurs in the methanol reactor and the N2 and CO2 rejection are performed at a much lower cost<br>
and at the same time, more of the reactants are preserved to make additional methanol.<br>
[0051] Although the invention has been described with reference to its various embodiments,<br>
from this description, those skilled in the art will understand that certain changes and<br>
modifications to the various embodiments of the invention, which do not depart from the scope<br>
and spirit of the invention, are nevertheless within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
