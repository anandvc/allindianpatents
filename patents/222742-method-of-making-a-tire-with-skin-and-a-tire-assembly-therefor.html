DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00014] The present invention relates to a base tire or tire 2 having an exo-belt<br>
skin or skin 1 which is applied to the external surface thereof, as described more fully<br>
herein below. In the present embodiment, a standard or specialty bicycle tire 2 is<br>
shown in Figs. 2, 4 and 5 to illustrate the invention. It should be understood,<br>
however, that the skin 1 could be applied to other types of tires including other types<br>
of bicycle tires, motorcycle tires, automobile tires or any other circumferential type of<br>
tire, if desired. It is the primary intention of the skin 1, to enhance the visual interest<br>
or appeal of the tire 2 and to improve wear and performance, however, other<br>
advantages of having the skin 1 on a tire 2 will hereinafter become apparent.<br>
[00015] As best shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the base (partially<br>
cured) tire or tire 2 (shown in radial cross-section) has a circumferential<br>
ply or base 4 with an outer circumferential surface 6, a pair of spaced<br>
apart annular side walls 8 at the distal ends of the base 6, a pair of rim engaging<br>
annular beads 9 on the distal ends of the side walls 8, and a tread pattern extending along the<br>
outer circumferential surface 6. The tread pattern of the present embodiment includes a plurality<br>
of spaced tread members 10, each of which extend radially outwardly from the outer<br>
circumferential surface 6 of the base 4. The specific tread pattern for a particular tire will vary<br>
depending upon the style and type of tire and some tires may not include a tread pattern at all.<br>
In addition, the number of plies of the tire 2 may vary to include multiple plies such as 3 ply, 4<br>
ply, 5 ply, 6 ply, etc., in some applications. Bicycle tires of the type illustrated by Fig. 5 are<br>
typically formed utilizing a rubber mixture containing about 75% by weight of natural rubber<br>
and about 25% by weight of synthetic rubber. However, the percentages of the natural rubber<br>
and synthetic rubber of the mixture may vary in particular applications. In addition, in the case<br>
of some bicycle tires, reinforcing fibers may be added to the rubber mixture to improve<br>
performance. Typically, when such reinforcing fibers are added to the mixture, the mixture is<br>
referred to as a "3D compound". The reinforcing fibers may comprise any suitable fiber,<br>
preferably monofilament fiber, such as Kevlar®, which may be crushed and mixed into the<br>
rubber mixture. Typically, such 3D compounds include approximately 3% by weight of the<br>
rubber mixture. However, the percentage of reinforcing fibers in the 3D compound may be less<br>
than or greater than 3% for particular applications.<br>
[00016] As shown in Figs. 1-3, 5 and 6, the present invention comprises a skin 1, which is<br>
adapted to be permanently installed upon or applied to at least a portion of the outer periphery of<br>
a base tire 2. In the preferred embodiment, as best shown in Fig. 3, the skin 1 is generally<br>
comprised of an elongated belt or strip which is substantially the same length as the<br>
circumferential dimension of the outer circumferential surface 6 of the tire 2. However, the skin<br>
1 could have a length which is greater than or less than the circumference of the outer<br>
circumferential surface 6 of the tire 2. The length will be determined by the aesthetic and<br>
performance characteristics one wishes to impart to the tire 2 through the use of the skin 1. For<br>
example, the skin 1 of the preferred embodiment, shown in Fig. 3, wherein the skin 1 is a belt or<br>
strip, enhances aesthetic and visual as well as the performance characteristics of the tire 2 around<br>
the entire circumference of the tire 2. In an alternative embodiment, best shown in Fig. 1, the<br>
skin 1 is a continuous loop which enhances both the aesthetic and performance characteristics of<br>
the entire tire 2. It is also contemplated that the skin 1 may be for covering only a segment of<br>
the tire 2 to achieve desired characteristics for the tire 2.<br>
[00017] The skin 1 of the preferred embodiment preferably has a width that encompasses the<br>
entire width of the tread pattern and each side wall 8 of the tire 2 extending from one bead 9 to<br>
the other bead 9. In other words, it is preferred that the entire exposed outer peripheral surface<br>
of the tire 2 be covered by the skin 1. It is contemplated., however, that the width of the skin 1<br>
may be less than that of the preferred embodiment. For example, the skin 1 could be configured<br>
to overlie and cover at least a portion of only one of the side walls 8 of the tire 2 or just the tread<br>
members 10 and outer circumferential surface 6 of the tire 2 (and not the side walls 8). Again,<br>
the width of the skin 1 will depend on the visual and performance characteristics one would like<br>
to impart to the tire 2. Since one of the functions of the skin 1 is decorative, the width of the<br>
skin 1 and the portions of the tire 2 on which the skin 1 is applied will be determined by the<br>
visual effect to be created. The decorative function of the skin 1 will be discussed more fully<br>
below.<br>
[00018] Additional factors to be considered in determining the length and width of the skin 1<br>
are the added weight and cost of the skin 1. Inasmuch as rotational weight, particularly at the<br>
outer circumference of a tire, dramatically increases the amount of work required to increase the<br>
rotational speed of the tire, minimizing the rotational weight is important to overall tire<br>
performance. Accordingly, the skin 1 must be carefully tailored to balance between the added<br>
tire weight and the aesthetic and performance purposes and visual effect sought to be achieved.<br>
Whereas in the preferred embodiment, the skin 1 is intended to enhance the aesthetic<br>
characteristics of the tire 2 around the entire outer periphery of the tire 2, one may desire that the<br>
visual aesthetic characteristics be more locally limited on the outer circumferential surface 6 and<br>
tread members 10 of the tire 2.<br>
[00019] As best shown in Figs. 1 and 3 the skin 1 preferably has visual characteristics that<br>
extend throughout at least some portion of the skin 1. More preferably, the visual characteristics<br>
could extend throughout the entire surface of the skin 1. Preferably, the skin 1 extends from the<br>
base 4 to embrace the entire outer periphery of the tire 2 including the outer circumferential<br>
surface 6 and the entire surface of each of the tread members 10. The skin 1 preferably extends<br>
the entire length of the tread members 10, including the end portion, so as to completely cover<br>
the entire periphery of each tread member 10 once the skin 1 has been applied to the tire 2.<br>
[00020] Preferably, the skin 1 which, before being applied to the base tire 2 is in a green or<br>
partially cured state, is made of a composite rubber mixture, preferably a blend of about 25%<br>
synthetic rubber, such as styrene-butadiene rubber and about 75% natural rubber. Preferably, the<br>
composition of the skin 1 is the same as or similar to the composition of the base tire 2 to which<br>
the skin 1 is applied. In this manner, bonding between the skin 1 and the base tire 2 is enhanced.<br>
Additionally, a combination of rubber and a polymeric material could be used. Other materials<br>
known to those skilled in the art could be used, if desired. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
reinforcing fibers are added to the skin 1 to enhance performance. Preferably, the reinforcing<br>
fibers are of the mono-filament type, such as Kevlar® and are crushed and mixed into the rubber<br>
mixture. The reinforcing fibers could comprise between 1-12% by weight of the rubber mixture<br>
but preferably comprise about 8% of the mixture. The material(s) elected must provide both<br>
durability and light weight to the skin I and be such that the skin 1 will bond to the tires during<br>
production. Preferably the skin 1 is limited in thickness to that which is sufficient to permit<br>
effective transfer and retention of the desired image onto the desired portion of the outer<br>
periphery of the tire 2 and provide the desired performance characteristics. However, it is also<br>
contemplated that the skin 1 be constructed of a substantial thickness so as to help protect the<br>
tire 2 from wear and abrasions.<br>
[00021] In some applications, at least the exposed outer surface of the skin 1 could be coated<br>
with a protective coating (not shown) to protect the skin 1 from the effects of wear and abrasion<br>
both following manufacture (in transport, etc.) and during use. Preferably the protective coating<br>
is urethane, but it is contemplated that the protective coating could be any transparent or<br>
translucent, durable, flexible material with sufficient bonding characteristics to adhere to the<br>
skin 1 under the conditions of anticipated use. Preferably, the protective coating selected also<br>
provides protection to the skin 1 from ultraviolet light and the like.<br>
[00022] As best shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the skin 1 preferably includes a decorative pattern 16<br>
which may be a pattern incorporating the trade dress of a particular manufacturer, retailer or the<br>
like (not shown) or some other pattern such as a snake skin pattern and/or other natural or non-<br>
natural patterns or the like (not shown), as examples. The decorative pattern 16 may comprise<br>
virtually any pattern or simply one or more solid colors. To enhance the safety and aesthetic<br>
characteristics of the tire 2, the decorative pattern 16 may include a phosphorescent material 17,<br>
as shown in Fig. 2, applied in a pattern such as stripes as shown in Fig. 2, or as a solid color as<br>
shown in Fig. 1. The decorative pattern 16 may also include reflective or retro-reflective<br>
particles or beads such as Seotchlite® from 3M to enhance the visual and safety aspects of the<br>
tire 2. It should be understood that the decorative pattern 16 can be incorporated on or into the<br>
skin 1 itself, or into the protective coating (not shown), or both. The retro-reflective material<br>
could be added to the rubber composition of the skin 1 and/or could be applied to the ink used to<br>
form the decorative pattern of the skin 1. The decorative pattern 16 could also include<br>
specifically directed advertising related or unrelated to the tire 2, bicycle (not shown) or the like.<br>
The decorative pattern 16 may be comprised of a plurality of discrete decorative patterns 16a,<br>
16b, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The decorative pattern 16 need not be distributed over the entire<br>
skin 1, but may be distributed over only a portion of the skin 1. For example, a portion of the<br>
decorative pattern 16 could be located only on the portion of the skin 1 that overlies the side<br>
walls 8 of the tire 2.<br>
[00023] The decorative pattern 16 is visible on at least a portion of the peripheral surface of<br>
the skin 1, i.e., it is applied to the surface of the skin 1. Preferably, the skin 1 is produced with<br>
the intended colored design printed thereon. Alternatively, it is to be understood that the<br>
decorative pattern could be embedded within a portion of the skin 1.<br>
[00024] The skin 1 may be made by any of several methods well known to those skilled in the<br>
art. Most preferably, the skin 1 is made by creating a thin sheet of rubber composition material<br>
(not shown) which is partially cured. Preferably, the skin 1 will have a thickness in the range of<br>
0.5 to 1 millimeter and more preferably is in the range of .5mm to .75mm. Preferably, a<br>
membrane (not shown) is applied to one side of the skin 1 to enable the skin 1 to be handled<br>
more easily. It should be understood that the use of a membrane for handling is not necessary.<br>
The decorative pattern 16 is printed on the skin 1 using any of a number of techniques known to<br>
those skilled in the art, but preferably is printed using offset and other known printing techniques<br>
which are well-known. Preferably the ink applied to the skin 1 is sufficiently rubberized or<br>
flexible to be able to withstand the rigors of tire use, including expansion during inflation and<br>
flexure during use based on the cycle of alternate tension/compressive stresses created on the tire<br>
during normal use.<br>
[00025] In an alternative embodiment, at least some of the three dimensional tread members<br>
10 will be positioned on the outer circumferential surface 6 in a pattern that will correspond in<br>
theme or design to the design printed two dimensionally to the skin 1. In a further alternative<br>
embodiment, at least some of the tread members 10 will be shaped to correspond in theme or<br>
design to the design printed on the skin 1. It is contemplated that the tread members 10 may be<br>
both shaped and positioned so to correspond in design or theme to the design printed on the skin<br>
1.<br>
[00026] The skin 1 is preferably applied to the base tire 2 during the tire manufacturing<br>
process. As stated above, the skin 1 is in a partially cured, green state at the time it is<br>
constructed. Preferably the skin 1 is applied to the tire 2 when the tire 2 is also in a green or<br>
partially cured state and the tire 2 and skin 1 are thereafter fully cured (vulcanized) together to<br>
form an assembled whole. The molding equipment used for curing the tire 2 and skin 1 is<br>
conventional equipment used during tire manufacture and well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Other equipment and/or methods may be employed to secure the skin 1 to the base tire 2.<br>
Preferably a BOM vertical mold is used but other molds such as a toroidal clam shell mold or<br>
the like could be used, if desired. Preferably, the partially cured skin 1 and the partially cured<br>
base tire 2 are placed in the mold and thereafter the expandable interior mold bladder is<br>
expanded using steam or other such pressure to cause the skin 1 and the base tire 2 to expand<br>
into the mold with the skin 1 facing the inner surface of the mold. Further expansion of the<br>
mold bladder causes the skin 1 and base tire 2 to conform to the inner surface of the mold<br>
thereby creating the desired tire shape, texture and tread pattern. The bladder is retained in place<br>
by the pressure for a predetermined time period during which the tire 1 and the skin 2 are fully<br>
cured or vulcanized by heat and pressure transmitted to the bladder via steam or other well<br>
known methods. Preferably, the outer surface of the mold is also heated in a manner known to<br>
those skilled in the art to enhance curing of the combined skin 1 and base tire 2 and to prevent<br>
undercuring or overcuring of the tire 2 or skin 1.<br>
[00027] Preferably, the skin 1 is initially positioned in the mold so that upon expansion of the<br>
mold bladder, the pattern of the skin 1 is in proper registry with the tread pattern imparted to the<br>
skin land base tire 2 by the inner surface of the mold. It will be recognized by those skilled in<br>
the art that the skin 1 will, through the curing process, become fused or bonded to the base tire 2<br>
due to the combination of both the skin 1 and tire 2 and the final curing process. Thus, when the<br>
partially cured tire 2 and partially cured skin 1 are subjected to the remainder of the curing<br>
process to which a tire 2 is normally subjected and which is well known to those skilled in the<br>
art the skin 1 becomes part of the tire 2. The bonding of the base tire 2 and the skin 1 is<br>
enhanced due to the composition of the skin 1 being the same as or similar to the composition of<br>
the base tire 2. It is also preferred that the skin 1 is applied prior to fully curing the tire 2 to help<br>
avoid a costly double cure process and to create a permanent bond between the skin 1 and the<br>
tire 2 so that the visual characteristics of the tire remain aligned with or in registry with the tire 2<br>
in both the circumferential and axial directions. It should be understood, however, that for some<br>
applications, the skin 1 may be applied to the tire 2 after the tire 2 is fully cured using an<br>
adhesive or some other direct or intermediate bonding agent or process.<br>
[00028] As shown in Fig. 3, the external surface 18 of the skin 1 may include a surface<br>
texture 20 for improving adhesion between the skin 1 and the trail and/or road surface(s) to<br>
which the skin 1 is exposed when on a tire 2. The surface texture could be imparted by the mold<br>
during the curing process or could be created by adding a textured material to the rubber<br>
composition of the skin 1. The primary effect of the surface texture 20, which will preferably<br>
cover portions of or the entire surface of the tread members 10 as well as lie within the<br>
interstitial region between the tread members 10 and the sides of the tread members 10, is to<br>
enhance the ability of the tire 2 to grip trail and/or road surfaces, to shed mud, and/or to channel<br>
water away from the tire 2. As shown b Fig. 3, fee surface texture 20 may include a plurality of<br>
different textures 20a, 20b, or the surface texture 20 may encompass only a single texture (not<br>
shown). The surface texture 20 may be made up of virtually any combination of bumps, knobs,<br>
depressions, ridges, etc. that will provide a gripping, mud shedding, or water channeling<br>
characteristic to the skin 1. As will be recognized by those skilled in the art the surface texture<br>
20 may also serve to enhance the aesthetic characteristics of the tire 2.<br>
[00029] Again, it should be noted that the skin 1 is intended to cover the tread members 10 in<br>
their entirety, as contrasted to prior techniques for decorating tires, such as that disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,904,794, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. This is<br>
advantageous not only for improving the aesthetics of the tire 2 of the present invention over the<br>
prior art by permitting the skin 1 to cover all or substantially visual surfaces of the tire 2, but<br>
also permits the design to incorporate the tread members 10 into, for example, a pattern<br>
matching the decorative pattern 16 or surface texture 20 into image specific treads. Additionally,<br>
covering the tread members 10 with the skin 1 can cause the skin 1 to serve as a reinforced exo<br>
belt which also improves the performance and wear resistance of the tire 2 over prior art designs<br>
particularly if the reinforcing fibers have been used to form the skin 1.<br>
[00030] It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the<br>
embodiment described above without departing from the broad inventive concepts thereof. It<br>
should also be understood that the above description was directed to a bicycle tire 2 for purposes<br>
of providing one example of the types of tires to which the present invention may be applied. It<br>
is clearly contemplated that the present invention may be applied to any type of tire, including,<br>
but not limited to, all types of bicycle tires including sew-ups, tubeless and clincher tires, in<br>
addition to motorcycle tires, automobile tires, heavy equipment tires, etc. It is understood,<br>
therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but is<br>
intended to cover all modifications within the scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
