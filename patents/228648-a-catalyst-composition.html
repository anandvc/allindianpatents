MORPHOLOGY CONTROLLED OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION PROCESS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE STATEMENT<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/456,373, filed March 21,2003.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a catalyst composition and methods for preparing the catalyst composition and for its use in a process for polymerizing olefins. In particular, the invention is directed to a catalyst composition and method of use, wherein the composition comprises a metal compound or complex that is activated to cause polymerization of addition polymerizable monomers by means of a cocatalyst or activating technique and a quantity of a hydroxycarboxylate metal salt sufficient to provide morphology control in the polymerization.<br>
Advances in polymerization and catalysis have resulted in the capability to produce many new polymers having improved physical and chemical properties useful in a wide variety of superior products and applications. With the development of new catalysts the choice of polymerization-type (solution, slurry, high pressure or gas phase) for producing a particular polymer has been greatly expanded. Also, advances in polymerization technology have provided more efficient, highly productive and economically enhanced processes. Regardless of these technological advances in the polyolefin industry, common problems, as well as new challenges associated with process operability still exist. For example, the tendency for a gas phase or slurry phase process to foul and/or sheet remains a challenge.<br>
For example, in a continuous slurry process fouling on the walls of the reactor, which act as a heat transfer surface, can result in many operability problems. Poor heat transfer during polymerization can result in polymer particles adhering to the walls of the reactor. These polymer articles can continue to polymerize on the walls and can result in a premature reactor shutdown. Also, depending on the reactor conditions, some of the polymer may dissolve in the reactor diluent and redeposit on for example the metal heat exchanger surfaces.<br>
In a typical continuous gas phase process, a recycle system is employed for many reasons including the removal of heat generated in the process by the polymerization. Fouling, sheeting and/or static generation in a continuous gas phase process can lead to the ineffective operation of various reactor systems. For example, the cooling mechanism of the recycle system, the temperature probes utilized for process control and the distributor plate, if affected, can lead to an early reactor shutdown.<br><br>
Evidence of, and solutions to, various process operability problems have been addressed by many in the art. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,792,592,4,803,251,4,855,370 and 5,391,657 all discuss techniques for reducing static generation in a polymerization process by introducing to the process for example, water, alcohols, ketones, and/or inorganic chemical additives; PCT publication WO 97/14721 published Apr. 24,1997 discusses the suppression of fines that can cause sheeting by adding an inert hydrocarbon to the reactor; U.S. Patent No. 5,627,243 discusses a new type of distributor plate for use in fluidized bed gas phase reactors; PCX publication WO 96/08520 discusses avoiding the introduction of a scavenger into the reactor; U.S. Patent No. 5,461,123 discusses using sound waves to reduce sheeting; U.S. Patent No. 5,066,736 andEP-Al 0 549 252 discuss the introduction of an activity retarder to the reactor to reduce agglomerates; U.S. Patent No. 5,610,244 relates to feeding make-up monomer directly into the reactor above the bed to avoid fouling and improve polymer quality; U.S. Patent No. 5,126,414 discusses including an oligomer removal system for reducing distributor plate fouling and providing for polymers free of gels; EP-A1 0 453 116 published Oct 23,1991 discusses the introduction of antistatic agents to the reactor for reducing the amount of sheets and agglomerates; U.S. Patent No. 4,012,574 discusses adding a surface-active compound, a perfluorocarbon group, to the reactor to reduce fouling; U.S. Patent No. 5,026,795 discusses the addition of an antistatic agent with a liquid carrier to the polymerization zone in the reactor, U.S. Patent No. 5,410,002 discusses using a conventional Ziegler- Natta titanium/magnesium supported catalyst composition where a selection of antistatic agents are added directly to the reactor to reduce fouling; U. S. Patent Nos. 5,034,480 and 5,034,481 discuss a reaction product of a conventional Ziegjer-Natta titanium catalyst with an antistat to produce ultrahigh molecular weight ethylene polymers; U.S. Patent No. 3,082,198 discusses introducing an amount of a carboxylic acid dependent on the quantity of water in a process for polymerizing ethylene using a titamum/aluminum organometallic catalysts in a hydrocarbon liquid medium; and U.S. Patent No. 3,919,185 describes a slurry process using a nonpolar hydrocarbon diluent using a conventional Ziegler-Natta-type or Phillips- type catalyst and a polyvalent metal salt of an organic acid having a molecular weight of at least 300.<br>
There are various other known methods for improving operability including coating the polymerization equipment, for example, treating the walls of a reactor using chromium compounds as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,532,311 and 4,876,320; injecting various agents into the process, for example PCT Publication WO 97/46599 published Dec. 11,1997 discusses feeding into a lean zone in a polymerization reactor an unsupported, soluble<br><br>
metallocene-type catalyst composition and injecting antifoulants or antistatic agents into the reactor, controlling the polymerization rate, particularly on start-up; and reconfiguring the<br>
reactor design.<br>
Others in the art to improve process operability have discussed modifying the catalyst composition by preparing the catalyst or components thereof in different ways. For example, methods in the art include combining the catalyst components in a particular order; manipulating the ratio of the various catalyst components; varying the contact time and/or temperature when combining the components; or simply adding various compounds to the catalyst composition. Especially illustrative in the art is the preparation procedures and methods for producing supported catalyst compositions with reduced tendencies for fouling and better operability. Examples of these include: WO 96/11961 published Apr. 26,1996 discusses as a component of a supported catalyst composition an antistatic agent for reducing fouling and sheeting in a gas, slurry or liquid pool polymerization process; U.S. Patent No. 5,283,278 is directed towards the prepolymerization of a metallocene catalyst or a conventional Ziegler- Natta catalyst in the presence of an antistatic agent; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,332,706 and 5,473,028 have resorted to a particular technique for forming a catalyst by incipient impregnation; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,427,991 and 5,643,847 describe the chemical bonding of non-coordinating anionic activators to supports; U.S. Patent No. 5,492,975 discusses polymer bound metallocene- type catalyst compositions; U.S. Patent No. 5,661,095 discusses supporting a metallocene-type catalyst on a copolymer of an olefin and an unsaturated silane; PCT publication WO 97/06186 published Feb. 20,1997 teaches removing inorganic and organic impurities after formation of the metallocene-type catalyst itself; PCT publication WO 97/15602 published May 1,1997 discusses readily supportable metal complexes; PCT publication WO 97/27224 published Jul. 31,1997 relates to forming a supported transition metal compound in the presence of an unsaturated organic compound having at least one terminal double bond; and EP-A2-811 63,8 discusses using a metallocene catalyst and an activating cocatalyst in a polymerization process in the presence of a nitrogen containing antistatic agent.<br>
While all these possible solutions might reduce the level of fouling or sheeting somewhat, some are expensive to employ and/or may not reduce fouling and sheeting to a level sufficient to successfully operate a continuous process, particularly a commercial or large-scale process.<br>
Thus, it would be advantageous to have a polymerization process capable of operating continuously with enhanced reactor operability and at the same time produce new and<br><br>
improved polymers. It would also be highly beneficial to have a continuously operating polymerization process having more stable catalyst productivities, reduced fouling/sheeting tendencies and increased duration of operation.<br>

Method of Preparing the Catalyst Composition<br>
The method for making the catalyst composition generally involves the combining, contacting, blending, and/or mixing of the remainder of the catalyst composition with one or more hydroxycarboxylate metal salts. In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst components or a mixture thereof are supported on a carrier.<br>
In another embodiment, the steps of the method of the invention include forming a polymerization catalyst, preferably forming a supported polymerization catalyst, and contacting the polymerization catalyst with at least one hydroxycarboxylate metal salt. In a preferred method, the polymerization catalyst comprises a catalyst compound, an activator or cocatalyst, and a carrier.<br>
The hydroxycarboxylate metal salt is desirably contacted with the catalyst composition or the individual components thereof under inert conditions at a temperature in the range of from 0 to 100°C, more preferably from 15 to 75°C, most preferably at about ambient temperature and pressure. The contacting is desirably performed under an inert gaseous atmosphere, such as nitrogen, however, it is also contemplated that the combination may be performed in the presence of olefin(s), solvents, and hydrogen.<br>
The hydroxycarboxylate metal salt may be added at any stage during the preparation of the polymerization catalyst. Desirably, the catalyst composition and the hydroxycarboxylate metal salt are combined in the presence of a liquid diluent such as<br><br>
mineral oil, toluene, hexane, isobutane or a mixture thereof. In a more preferred method the hydroxycarboxylate metal salt is combined with a catalyst composition that has been formed in a liquid, preferably in a slurry, or combined with a substantially dry or dried, polymerization catalyst composition that has been placed in a liquid and reslurried.<br>
The contact time for the hydroxycarboxylate metal salt and the polymerization catalyst may vary depending on one or more of the conditions, temperature and pressure, the type of mixing apparatus, the quantities of the components to be combined, and even the mechanism for introducing the polymerization catalyst/hydroxycarboxylate metal salt combination into the reactor.<br>
Preferably, the polymerization catalyst, preferably a catalyst compound and a carrier, is contacted with a hydroxycarboxylate metal salt for a period of time from about a second to about 24 hours, preferably from about 1 minute to about 12 hours, more preferably from about 10 minutes to about 10 hours, and most preferably from about 30 minutes to about 8 hours.<br>

It is believed that the more metal present in the cocatalyst or activator, for example the total aluminum content in trialkylaluminum, alumoxane, or other aluminum containing cocatalysts), the more hydroxycarboxylate metal salt is required for optimal operation.<br>
Mixing techniques and equipment contemplated for use in the method of the invention are well known. Mixing techniques may involve any mechanical mixing means, for example shaking, stirring, tumbling, and rolling. Another technique contemplated involves the use of fluidization, for example in a fluid bed reactor vessel where circulated gases provide the mixing. Non-limiting examples of mixing equipment for combining, in the most preferred embodiment a solid polymerization catalyst and a solid hydroxycarboxylate metal salt, include a ribbon blender, a static mixer, a double cone blender, a drum tumbler, a drum roller, a dehydrator, a fluidized bed, a helical mixer and a conical screw mixer.<br>
Desirably the catalyst composition or the components thereof are tumbled with the hydroxycarboxylate metal salt for a period of time such that a substantial portion of the catalyst or components are intimately mixed and/or substantially contacted with the hydroxycarboxylate metal salt.<br>
Desirably the catalyst composition of the invention is substantially dried and/or free flowing. In a preferred embodiment, the hydroxycarboxylate metal salt or mixture of salts is contacted with a supported catalyst composition in a rotary mixer, tumble mixer, or in a<br><br>
fluidized bed mixing process, under a nitrogen atmosphere, and any liquid diluent is subsequently removed. In another embodiment, the polymerization catalyst and optionally the hydroxycarboxylate metal salt may be contacted with a liquid, such as mineral oil to form a slurry, and introduced to a polymerization reactor as a separate or combined stream.<br>
In the operation of the present invention, it is desirably to employ inert supports having an average particle size (D50) from about 10 to 80 μm, preferably from 30 to 50 (Jm. Preferred supports are finely divided silica.<br>
Polymerization Process<br>
Suitable addition polymerization processes for use herein include solution, gas phase, slurry phase, high pressure, or combinations thereof. Particularly preferred is a gas phase or slurry phase polymerization of one or more olefins at least one of which is ethylene or propylene. The invention is particularly well suited to the polymerization of ethylene, optionally in combination with propylene, butene-1, pentene-1,4-methyl-pentene-l, hexene-1, octene-1, or decene-1.<br>
Other monomers useful in the process of the invention include ethylenically unsaturated monomers, diolefins having 4 to 18 carbon atoms, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, vinyl monomers and cyclic olefins. Non-limiting monomers useful in the invention may include norbornene, norbomadiene, isobutylene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, styrenes, alkyl substituted styrene, ethylidene norbornene, isoprene, dicyclopentadiene and cyclopentene.<br>
Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known 21s a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. Examples of such processes are disclosed in U.S. Patent's 4,543, 399, 4,588,790,5,028,670,5,317,036,5,352,749, 5,405,922,5,436,304,5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228.<br><br>
The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vaiy from about 100 psig (700 kPa) to about 500 psig (3500 kPa)9 preferably in the range of from about 200 psig (1400 fcPa) to about 400 psig (2800 kPa), more preferably in the range of from about 250 psig (1700 kPa) to about 350 psig (2400 kPa).<br>
The reactor temperature in the gas phase process may vary from 30 to 120°C, preferably from 60 to 115°C, more preferably from 70 to 110°C, and most preferably from about 70 to 95°C.<br>
A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from 100 fcPa to 5 MPa, and temperatures in the range of 0 to 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent to which monomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed should remain a liquid under the conditions of polymerization and be relatively inert. Preferred diluents are aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, preferably propane, n-butane, isobutane, pentane, isopentane, hexane, cyclohexane, or a mixture thereof is employed. Examples of suitable slurry polymerization processes for use herein are disclosed in U.S. Patent's 3,248,179 and 4,613,484.<br>
Examples of solution processes that are suitably employed with the catalyst compositions of the present invention are described in U.S. Patent's 4,271, 060,5,001,205, 5,236,998 and 5,589,555,<br>
In addition to the previously mentioned catalyst compositions, the present polymerization process may utilize small quantities of additives (scavengers) to react with poisons or impurities in the process. Examples of suitable scavengers include triethylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, diethyl aluminum chloride, and dibutyl zinc. Suitable scavengers and their use in polymerizations is disclosed in U.S. Patent's 5,712,352 and 5,763,543, and in WO 96/08520.<br>
When starting up a polymerization process, especially a gas phase process, there is a higher tendency for operability problems to occur. Thus, it is contemplated in the present invention that a polymerization catalyst and hydroxycarboxylate metal salt mixture is used on start-up to reduce or eliminate start-up problems. Furthermore, it also contemplated that once the reactor is operating in a stable state, a transition to a catalyst composition lacking in a hydroxycarboxylate metal salt can be made.<br><br>
In another embodiment, during a polymerization process that is or is about to be disrupted, the catalyst composition may be altered so as to include hydroxycarboxylate metal salt. This switching of polymerization catalysts is contemplated to occur when operability problems arise. Indications of operability problems are well known in the art. Some of which in a gas phase process include temperature excursions in the reactor, unexpected pressure changes, excessive static generation or unusually high static spikes, chunking, and sheeting. Thus, in one embodiment, the hydroxycarboxylate metal salt or a supported derivative thereof may be added directly to the reactor, particularly when operability problems arise.<br>
It has also been discovered that using the polymerization catalyst combined with a hydroxycarboxylate metal salt of the invention it is easier to produce fractional melt index and higher density polymers. In one embodiment, the invention provides for a process for polymerizing olefin(s), especially ethylene or a mixture of ethylene and 1-butene in a reactor in the presence of a the present polymerization catalyst composition to produce a polymer product having a melt index (MI) or (12) as measured by ASTM-D-1238-E of less than about 1 dg/min and a density greater than 0.920 g/cc, more preferably the polymer product has a melt index less than about 0.75 dg/min and a density greater than 0.925 g/cc.<br>
The polymers produced by the process of the invention can be used in a wide variety of products and end-use applications. The polymers produced by the process of the invention include linear low density polyethylene, elastomers, plastomers, high density polyethylenes, low density olyethylenes, polypropylene, and polypropylene copolymers.<br>
The polymers, typically ethylene based polymers, preferably have a density in the range of from 0.86 g/cc to 0.97 g/cc, preferably in the range of from 0. 88 g/cc to 0.965 g/cc, more preferably in the range of from 0.900 g/cc to 0.96 g/cc, even more preferably in the range of from 0.905 g/cc to 0.95 g/cc, yet even more preferably in the range from 0.910 g/cc to 0.940 g/cc, and most preferably greater than 0.915 g/cc, preferably greater than 0. 920 g/cc, and most preferably greater than 0.925 g/cc.<br>
The polymers produced by the process of the invention typically have a molecular weight distribution, a weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight (Mw/Mn ) of greater than 1.5 to about 15, particularly greater than 2 to about 10, more preferably greater than about 2.2 to less than about 8, and most preferably from 2.5 to 8.<br>
Also, the polymers of the invention typically have a narrow composition distribution as measured by Composition Distribution Breadth Index (CDBI). Desirably the polymers have CDBPs generally in the range of greater than 50 to 99 percent, preferably in the range of<br><br>
55 to 85 percent, and more preferably 60 to 80 percent. A suitable method for determining the CDBI of a copolymer is disclosed in WO 93/03093.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following Examples that should not be regarded as limiting of the present invention. Unless stated to the contrary or conventional in the art, all parts and percents are based on weight.<br>
Examples 1-4 and Comparative A and B<br>
A Support Preparation<br>
Support 1: Silica (Davison 948™, available from Grace Davison Company) which had been heated at 600°C for 3 hours under a nitrogen purge (949 g) was added to toluene (2400 g) containing methylalumoxane (MAO, Akzo Nobel, Inc. 1314 mL of a 13.7 percent toluene solution). The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, and the temperature of the mixture was increased to 70°C and the volatiles were removed in vacuo. The resulting dry powder was heated an additional 1 hour under vacuum. The resulting alumoxane modified silica, was a free flowing white solid having an aluminum content of 4.5 mmol/g.<br>
Support 2  Silica (Davison 948 ™) having D50 = 40 \xm and surface area = 400 m2/g, was heated for several hours under a N2 stream at 500 °C. After cooling under N2, the silica was transferred to a mix tank equipped with a helical stirrer and slurried in isopentane. The remaining surface hydroxyl groups were passivated by treatment with hexane solution of triethylaluminum (TEAL) in an amount to provide 1.65 mmol triethylaluminum/g silica (1.5:1 Al:OH). After washing and drying, a white free-flowing powder was obtained.<br>
B. Supported Catalyst Preparation<br>
1)	Dimethylsilyl fcis(2-methyl-4-phenylinden-l -yl)zirconium (II) 1,4-diphenylbutadiene, was added as a toluene solution to a slurry of Support 1 to provide 21 (Jtmol Zr/g silica. After washing with isopentane and drying, a red-purple free-flowing powder was obtained.<br>
2)	A toluene solution of di(Ci6.2oaU^l)niethylammonium &amp;is(pentafluorophenyl)(p-hydroxyphenyl)borate was treated with 1.0-1.5 molar equivalents of triethylaluminum. This solution was then added to previously dried Support 2 and agitated until free flowing. Isopentane was then added to precipitate the borate and the supernatant was removed. The silica was re-slurried in isopentane and treated with a toluene solution of the metallocene dimethylsilyl biX2-methyl-4-phenylinden-l-yl)zirconium (II) 1,4-diphenylbutadiene. The amounts of borate, metallocene, and silica added gave Zr:B = 1.0-1.5 and Zr:Si02 = 10<br><br>
mmol/g. After washing with isopentane and drying, a blue-green free-flowing powder was obtained.<br>
C Final Catalyst Preparation<br>
Example 1: A mixture of 500 mg of Supported Catalyst 1 (10.5 jimol Zr) was stirred in hexane and 14.5 mg (25.8 jimol) of zinc 3,5-di-ter/-butylsalicylate [Zn(02CC6H2(lBu)2(OH)]2; was added as a solid. After mixing, the slurry was collected, washed with hexane and dried.<br>
Example 2: A mixture of 500 mg of Supported Catalyst 1 (10.5 [imol Zr) was stirred in hexane and 3.2 mg (25.8 (Jmol) of Zinc di(2-hydroxypropionate) [D/L-lactic acid, hemizinc salt] was added as a solid. After mixing, the slurry was collected, washed with hexane and dried.<br>
Example 3: A mixture of 500 mg of Supported Catalyst 1 (10.5 pmol Zr) was stirred in hexane and 6.3 mg (51.5 jwmol) of Zinc di(2-hydroxypropionate) [D/L-lactic acid, hemizinc salt] was added as a solid. After mixing, the slurry was collected, washed with hexane and dried.<br>
Example 4: A mixture of 825 mg of Supported Catalyst 2 (8.3 pmol Zr) was stirred in hexane and 3.1 mg (25.4 nmol) of Zinc 3,5-di-ter^butylsalicylate [Zn(02CC6H2CBu)2(OH)]2] was added as a solid After mixing, the slurry was collected, washed with hexane and dried.<br>
Comparative Example (A): This material was prepared by subjecting Supported Catalyst 1 to the same stirring, washing, and isolation procedures as Examples 1-4, but without the addition of a zinc compound.<br>
Comparative Example (B): This material was prepared by subjecting Supported Catalyst 2 to the same stirring, washing, and isolation procedures as Examples 1-4, but without the addition of a zinc compound.<br>
Polymerization<br>
Polymerizations were conducted in a computer controlled, stirred, jacketed 1.8 L stainless steel autoclave batch reactor. The bottom of the reactor is fitted with a large orifice bottom dump valve, which empties the reactor contents into a 6-L SS dump pot. The dump pot is vented to a 30 gal. blowdown tank, with both the pot and the tank N2 purged. All chemicals used for polymerization or catalyst makeup are run through purification columns, to remove any impurities. Propylene, toluene, ethylene and mixed alkanes solvent (Isopar E ™ available from Exxon Mobil Chemicals Inc.) are passed through 2 columns, the first containing alumina, the second containing a purifying reactant (Q5™ available from<br><br>
Englehardt Corporation). The N2 and H2 are passed through a single column containing Q5™ reactant.<br>
The autoclave was cooled to 0.6 MPa above the reactor pressure, and the contents were quickly blown into the reactor. Both reaction exothenn and pressure drop were monitored throughout the reaction runtime.<br>
The agitator was stopped, the reactor was pressured up to about 3.4 MPa withN2, and the bottom dump valve opened to empty reactor contents to the dump pot Immediately after the run, a 140°C wash with 600 g of mixed alkanes was performed to remove remaining polymer which was adhered to the reactor walls. When loading for the wash, 1/2 the solvent was loaded through the catalyst shot tank, so it was completely flushed of residual catalyst, activator and silica. If a wash contained residual polymer, an additional 140°C wash was performed until the drained washings were clear. The dump pot contents (for the runs and washes) were poured into trays and placed in a lab hood where the solvent was evaporated overnight The trays were then transferred to a vacuum oven, where they were heated to 145°C under vacuum to remove any remaining solvent After the trays cooled to ambient temperature, the polymers were quantified and analyzed.<br>
Results are contained in Table 1.<br><br>
As may be seen by examination of the above polymerization results, use of the additives according to the invention generally resulted in less reactor fouling while maintaining or improving polymerization efficiency.<br><br><br>
