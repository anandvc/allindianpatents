further involves the manufacture of methylphenidate of the Formula II wherein R= COOCH3; X= H by the reduction of a compound of Formula I wherein R=CONR1R2, COOCH3, COOH; X= H where R1R2 are as defined above, which are important intermediates for the production of methylphenidate.<br>
In accordance with the above basic objective of the present invention, suitable procedure is that oc-phenyl-oc-pyridyl derivative of Formula 1 which is suspended in C1 -C4 straight or branched chain alcoholic solvents in the presence of equimolar amounts of organic and/or inorganic acids. Representative example of solvents used are methanol, ethanol, isopropanol etc. and the molar quantities of acids used to protonate the pyridine ring are sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid or in combination thereof. Although the selection of a particular acid is not critical to the success of the invention, acetic acid and perchloric acid are preferred. In a typical procedure, Palladium on carbon is added to the suspended reaction mass and the reaction proceeds at a temperature from room temperature to 70 °C under hydrogen pressure of 5 kg/cm to 15 kg/cm and completes in 15 to 30 hrs. The palladium on carbon of various capacity used in the present invention are 5% to 10%, although not critical but for economic reasons 5% palladium is preferred. The duration of completion of reaction depends on the parameters such as temperature, hydrogenation pressure etc. known to those skilled in the art. The reaction is advantageously carried out in methanol.<br>
After completion of the reaction the catalyst was removed by filtration and the filtrate was advantageously concentrated for recovery of solvent and the obtained residue, contains catalytic amount of acid used in the reaction, was diluted with water, basified with alkali solution to isolate the product of Formula II (wherein R=CONR1R2, COOCH3, COOH; X=H, CI, Br, OMe, NH2; R1R2= H or C1-C3 alkyl groups).<br>
The catalyst used in the hydrogenation reaction of oc-phenyl - α - pyridyl - 2 - acetic acid and their derivatives of Formula I are, more specifically, 5 % Palladium on carbon (50% wet). Catalyst quantity varies from 10 to 15 gm per 100 gm of the starting oc-phenyl-oc-pyridyl -2- acetic acid derivative.   The suitable volume of solvent for carrying out the<br><br>
