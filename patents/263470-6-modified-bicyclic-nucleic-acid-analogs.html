This application claims priority benefit to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/762,722, filed January 27, 2006 and entitled, "Subsituted Bicyclic Nucleic AC1d Analogs;" and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/805,660, filed June 23,2006 aad entitled, "6-Substituted Bicyclic Nucleic AC1d Analogs," the entirety of each of these disclosures are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides 6-modified bicyclic nucleosides and oligomeric compounds and compositions prepared therefirom. More particularly, the present invention provides nucleosides having a 2'-0-C(H)(R)-4' bridge and oligomers and compositions prepared therefi-om. In a preferred embodiment, R is in a particular configuration providing either the (R) or (S) isomer. In some embodiments, the oligomeric compounds and compositions of the present invention hybridize to a portion of a target RNA resulting in loss of normal fimction of the target RNA.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Antisense technology is an effective means for reduC1ng the expression of one or more speC1fic gene products and can therefore prove to be xmiquely usefiil in a number of therapeutic, diagnostic, and research applications. Chemically modified nucleosides are routinely used for incorporation into antisense sequences to enhanC6one or more properties such as for example nuclease resistance. One such group of chemical modifications includes bicyclic nucleosides wherein the fiaranose portion of the nucleoside includes a bridge connecting two atoms on the furanose ring thereby forming a bicyclic ring system. Such bicyclic nucleosides have various names including BNA's and LNA's for bicycKc nucleic aC1ds or locked nucleic aC1ds respectively.<br>
Various BNA's have been prepared and reported in the patent literature as well as in sC1entific literature, see for example: Singh et al., Chem. Commun., 1998,4,455-456; Koshkin et al., Tetrahedron, 1998, 54,3607-3630; Wahlestedt et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. SC1. U. S. A., 2000, 97, 5633-5638; Kumar et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1998, 8, 2219-2222; Wengel et al., PCT hitemational Application WO 98-DK393 19980914; Singh et al., J. Org. Chem., 1998, 63, 10035-10039, the text of each is incorporated by referenC6herein, in their entirety. Examples of issued US patents and published appplications include for example: U.S. Patents 7,053,207,<br><br>
6,770,748, 6,268,490 and 6,794,499 and published U.S. applications 20040219565, 20040014959, 20030207841, 20040192918, 20030224377, 20040143114 and 20030082807; the text of each is incorporated by referenC6herein, in their entirety.<br>
Many LNA's are toxic. See, e.g., Swayze, E. E.; Siwkowski, A. M.; Wancewicz, E. V.; Migawa, M. T.; Wyrzykiewicz, T. K.; Hung, G.; Monia, B. P.; Bennett, C. F., Antisense oligonucleotides containing locked nucleic aC1d improve potency but cause significant hepatotoxiC1ty in animals. Nucl. AC1ds Res., doi: 10.1093/nar/gkll071 (Dec. 2006, advanced online publication).<br>
Consequently, there remains a long-felt need for agents that speC1fically regulate gene expression via antisense mechanisms. Disclosed herein are 6-substituted BNA's and antisense compounds prepared therefi-om useful for modulating gene expression pathways, including those relying on mechanisms of action such as RNaseH, RNAi and dsRNA enzymes, as well as other antisense mechanisms based on target degradation or target occupancy. One having skill in the art, onC6armed with this disclosure will be able, without undue experimentation, to identify, prepare and exploit antisense compounds for these uses.<br><br>

)     pharmacokinetic, binding, absorption, cellular distribution, cellular uptake, charge and clearance. Conjugate groups are routinely used in the chemical arts and are linked directly or via an optional linking moiety or linking group to a parent compound such as an oligomeric compound. A preferred list of conjugate groups includes without limitation, intercalators, reporter molecules, polyamines, polyamides, polyethylene glycols, thioethers, polyethers, cholesterols,<br>

LinlC1ng groups or bifonctional Unking moieties such as those known in the art are amenable to the present invention. Linking groups are useful for attachment of chemical<br>
I     functional groups, conjugate groups, reporter groups and other groups to selective sites in a parent compound such as for example an oligomeric compound. In general a bifunctional linking moiety comprises a hydrocarbyl moiety having two functional groups. One of the functional groups is selected to bind to a parent molecule or compound of interest and the other is selected to bind essentially any selected group such as a chemical functional group or a conjugate group. In some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain structure or an oHgomer of repeating units such as ethylene glyol or amino aC1d units. Examples of functional groups that are routinely used in bifunctional linking moieties include, but are not limited to, electrophiles for reacting with nucleophilic groups and nucleophiles for reacting with electrophilic groups. In some embodiments, bifunctional linking moieties include amino, hydroxyl, carboxylic aC1d, thiol, unsaturations (e.g., double or triple bonds), and the like.

The term "protecting group," as used herein, refers to a labile chemical moiety which is known in the art to protect reactive groups including without limitation, hydroxyl, amino and<br>
&gt;     thiol groups, against undesired reactions during synthetic procedures. Protecting groups are typically used selectively and/or orthogonally to protect sites during reactions at other reactive sites and can then be removed to leave the unprotected group as is or available for further reactions. Protecting groups as known in the art are described generally in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1999).<br>
)	Groups can be selectively incoiporated into oligomeric compounds of the invention as<br>
precursors. For example an amino group can be placed into a compound of the invention as an azido group that can be chemically converted to the amino group at a desired point in the synthesis. Generally, groups are protected or present as precursors that will be inert to reactions that modify other areas of the parent molecule for conversion into their final groups at an<br>
i     appropriateT1me. Further representative protecting or precursor groups are discussed in Agrawal, et al.. Protocols for Oligonucleotide Conjugates, Eds, Humana Press; New Jersey, 1994; Vol. 26 pp. 1-72.<br>

As used herein, the term "orthogonally protected" refers to functional groups which are protected with different classes of protecting groups, wherein each class of protecting group can be removed in any order and in the presenC6of all other classes (see, Barany, G. and Merrifield, R.B., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1977,99, 7363; idem, 1980,102, 3084.) Orthogonal protection is widely used in for example automated oligonucleotide synthesis. A functional group is deblocked in the presenC6of one or more other protected functional groups which is not affected by the deblocking procedure. This deblocked functional group is reacted in some manner and at some point a further orthogonal protecting group is removed under a different set of reaction conditions. This allows for selective chemistry to arrive at a desired compound or oligomeric compound.<br>
The present invention provides compounds having reactive phosphorus groups useful for forming intemucleoside linkages including for example phosphodiester and phosphorothioate intemucleoside linkages. Such reactive phosphorus groups are known in the art and contain phosphoras atoms inP"'orP^ valenC6state including, but not limited to, phosphoramidite, H-phosphonate, phosphate triesters and phosphoms containing chiral auxiUaries. A preferred syn¬thetic soUd phase synthesis utilizes phosphoramidites (P'^' chemistry) as reactive phosphites. The intermediate phosphite compounds are subsequently oxidized to the P^ state using known methods to yield, in preferred embodiments, phosphodiester or phosphorothioate intemucleotide linkages. Additional reactive phosphates and phosphites are disclosed in Tetrahedron Report Number 309 (Beaucage and Iyer, Tetrahedron, 1992,48, 2223-2311).<br><br>
SpeC1fic examples of oligomeric compounds useful in this invention include oligonucleotides containing modified e.g. non-naturally occurring intemucleoside linkages. Two main classes of intemucleoside linkages are defined by the presense or absenC6of a phosphorus atom. Modified intemucleoside linkages having a phosphoms atom include, but are not limited to, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'-alkylene phosphonates, 5'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3'-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and boranophosphates having normal 3-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more interaucleotide linkages is a 3' to 3', 5' to 5' or 2' to 2' linkage. Oligonucleotides having inverted polarity can comprise a single 3' to 3' linkage at the 3'-most interaucleotide linkage i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleobase is missing or has a hydroxyl group in plaC6thereof). Various salts, mixed salts and fi-ee aC1d forms are also included.<br>

The compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-, a or 13, or as (D)- or (L)- such as for amino aC1ds. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optical isomers may be prepared from their respective optically active precursors by the procedures described above, or by resolving the racemic mixtures. The resolution can be carried out in the presenC6of a resolving agent, by chromatography or by repeated crystallization or by some combination of these techniques which are known to those skilled in the art. Further details regarding resolutions can be found in Jacques, et al., Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981). When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, other imsaturation, or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless speC1fied otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers or C1s- and trans-isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included. The configuration of any carbon-carbon double bond appearing herein is selected for convenienC6only and is not intended to designate a particular configuration unless the text so I     states; thus a carbon-carbon double bond or carbon-heteroatom double bond depicted arbitrarily herein as trans may be C1s, trans, or a mixture of the two in any proportion.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "oHgomeric compound" refers to a polymer having at least a region that is capable of hybridizing to a nucleic aC1d molecule. The term "oUgomeric compound" includes oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide analogs and oligonucleosides as well as nucleotide mimetiC6 and/or mixed polymers comprising nucleic aC1d and non-nucleic aC1d components. OUgomeric compounds are routinely prepared linearly but can be joined or otherwise prepared to be C1rcular and may also include branching. OUgomeric compounds can form double stranded constructs such as for example two strands hybridized to form double stranded compositions. The double stranded compositions can be linked or separate and can include overhangs on the ends. In general, an oUgomeric compound comprises a backbone of linked monomeric subunits where each linked monomeric subunit is directly or indirectly attached to a heterocyclic base moiety. OUgomeric compoxmds may also include monomeric subunits that are not linked to a heterocyclic base moiety thereby providing abasic sites. The linkages ioinine the monomeric subunits. the suear moieties or surrogates and the<br><br>
heterocyclic base moieties can be independently modified. The linkage-sugar unit, which may or may not include a heterocyclic base, may be substituted with a mimetic such as the monomers in peptide nucleic aC1ds. The ability to modify or substitute portions or entire monomers at each position of an oligomeric compound gives rise to a large nxunber of possible motifs.<br>
As is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. The base portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base moiety. The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are purines and pyrimidines. Nucleotides are nucleosides that fiirther include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2', 3' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound. The respective ends of this linear polymeric structure can be joined to form a C1rcular structure by hybridization or by formation of a covalent bond, however, open linear structures are generally desired. Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the intemucleoside linkages of the oligonucleotide. The normal intemucleoside linkage of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester linkage.<br>
In the context of this invention, the term "oligonucleotide" refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic aC1d (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic aC1d (DNA). This term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally-occurring nucleobases, sugars and covalent intemucleoside linkages. The term "oligonucleotide analog" refers to oligonucleotides that have one or more non-naturally occurring portions. Such non-naturally occurring oligonucleotides are often desired over naturally occurring forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic aC1d target and increased stabiUty in the presenC6of nucleases.<br>
In the context of this invention, the term "oHgonucleoside" refers to a sequenC6of nucleosides that are joined by intemucleoside linkages that do not have phosphoms atoms.

■&gt;     The term "sugar surrogate" overlaps with the slightly broader term "nucleoside mimetic" but is intended to indicate replacement of the sugar unit (furanose ring) only. The term "nucleotide mimetic" is intended to include those structures used to replaC6the nucleoside and the linkage at one or more positions of an oligomeric compound such as for example peptide nucleic aC1ds or morpholinos (morpholinos linked by -N(H)-C(=0)-0- or other non-phosphodiester linkage).<br>

Chimeric oligomeric compounds have differentially modified nucleosides at two or more positions and are generally defined as having a motif. Chimeric oligomeric compounds of the invention may be formed as composite structures of two or more oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide analogs, oligonucleosides and/or oligonucleotide mimetiC6 as described above. Representative U.S. patents that teach the preparation of such hybrid structures include, but are not limited to, U.S.: 5,013,830; 5,149,797; 5,220,007; 5,256,775; 5,366,878; 5,403,711; 5,491,133; 5,565,350; 5,623,065; 5,652,355; 5,652,356; and 5,700,922, certain of which are commonly owned with the instant application, and each of which is herein incorporated by referenC6in its entirety.<br>
Oligomerization of modified and unmodified nucleosides and mimetiC6 therof, in one aspect of the present invention, is performed according to literature procedures for DNA (Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs, Ed. Agrawal (1993), Humana Press) and/or RNA (Scaringe, Methods (2001), 23, 206-217; Gait et al., Applications of Chemically synthesized RNA in RNA:Protein Interactions, Ed. Smith (1998), 1-36; Gallo et al., Tetrahedron (2001), 57, 5707-5713) synthesis as appropriate. Additional methods for solid-phase synthesis may be found m Caruthers U.S. PatentsNos. 4,415,732; 4,458,066; 4,500,707; 4,668,777; 4,973,679; and 5,132,418; and Koster U.S. Patents Nos. 4,725,677 and Re. 34,069.<br>
CommerC1ally available equipment routinely used for the support medium based synthesis of oligomeric compounds and related compounds is sold by several vendors including, for example. Applied Biosystems (Foster C1ty, CA). Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. Suitable solid phase techniques, including automated synthesis techniques, are described in F. Eckstein (ed.), Oligonucleotides and Analogues, a Practical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York (1991).<br>
The synthesis of RNA and related analogs relative to the synthesis of DNA and related analogs has been increasing as efforts in RNAi increase. The primary RNA synthesis strategies that are presently being used commerC1ally include 5'-0-DMT-2'-0-t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), 5'-0-DMT-2'-0-[ 1 (2-fluorophenyl)-4-methoxypiperidin-4-yl] (FPMP), 2'-0-[(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl (2'-0-CH2-0-Si(iPr)3 (TOM), and the 5'-0-silyl ether-2'-AC6(5'-0-bis(trimethylsiloxy)cyclododecyloxysilyl ether (DOD)-2'-0-bis(2-acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE). A current list of some of the major companies currently offering RNA products include PierC6Nucleic AC1d Technologies, Dharmacon Research Inc., Ameri Biotechnologies Inc., and Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. One company, Princeton Separations, is marketing an RNA synthesis activator advertised to reduC6couplingT1mes espeC1ally with TOM and TBDMS chemistries. Such an activator would also be amenable to the present invention.<br><br>
The primary groups being used for commerC1al RNA synthesis are:<br>
TBDMS      = 5'-0-DMT-2'-0-t-butyldimethylsilyl;<br>
TOM	= 2'-0-[(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl;<br>
DOD/AC6 = (5'-0-bis(trimeihyIsiloxy)cyclododecyloxysilyl ether-2'-0-bis(2-acetoxyethoxy)methyl<br>
FPMP	=5'-0-DMT-2'-0-[l(2-fluorophenyl)-4-methoxypiperidin-4-yl].<br>
All of the aforementioned RNA synthesis strategies are amenable to the present invention. Strategies that would be a hybrid of the above e.g. using a 5'-protecting group from one strategy with a 2'-0-protecting from another strategy is also amenable to the present invention.<br>
hi the context of this invention, "hybridization" means the pairing of complementary sfrands of oligomeric compounds. In the present invention, one mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleobases) of the sfrands of '     oligomeric compounds. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hybridization can occur imder varying C1rcumstances.<br>
An oligomeric compound is speC1fically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target nucleic aC1d interferes with the normal ftinction of the target nucleic aC1d to cause a I     loss of activity, and there is a suffiC1ent degree of complementarity to avoid non-speC1fic binding of the oligomeric compound to non-target nucleic aC1d sequences under conditions in which speC1fic binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of m vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and under conditions in which assays are performed in the case of in vitro assays.<br>
"Complementary," as used herein, refers to the capaC1ty for preC1se pairing of two nucleobases regardless of where the two are located. For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of an oligomeric compound is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at a certain position of a target nucleic aC1d, the target nucleic aC1d being a DNA, RNA, or oUgonucleotide molecule, then the position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic aC1d is considered to be a complementary position. The oHgomeric compound and the further DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule are complementary to each other when a suffiC1ent number of complementary positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleobases which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, "speC1fically hybridizable" and "complementary" are terms which are used to indicate a suffiC1ent degree of preC1se pairing or<br><br>
complementarity over a suffiC1ent number of nucleobases such that stable and speC1fic binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and a target nucleic aC1d.<br>
It is understood in the art that the sequenC6of an oligomeric compound need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic aC1d to be speC1fically hybridizable. Moreover, an oligonucleotide may hybridize over one or more segments such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure or hairpin structure). The oligomeric compounds of the present invention can comprise at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% sequenC6complementarity to a target region within the target nucleic aC1d sequenC6to which they are targeted. For example, an oligomeric compound in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the oligomeric compound are complementary to a target region, and would therefore speC1fically hybridize, would represent 90 percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining noncomplementary nucleobases may be clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleobases and need not be contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleobases. As such, an oligomeric compound which is 18 nucleobases in length having 4 (four) noncomplementary nucleobases which are flanked by two regions of complete complementarity with the target nucleic aC1d would have 77.8% overall complementarity with the target nucleic aC1d and would thus fall within the scope of the present invention. Percent complementarity of an oUgomeric compound with a region of a target nucleic aC1d can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990,215,403-410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656).<br>
Further included in the present invention are oligomeric compounds such as antisense oligomeric compounds, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, external guide sequenC6(EGS) oligonucleotides, alternate splicers, primers, probes, and other oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic aC1d. As such, these oligomeric compounds may be introduced in the form of single-stranded, double-stranded, C1rcular or hairpin oligomeric compoxmds and may contain structural elements such as internal or terminal bulges or loops. OnC6introduced to a system, the oUgomeric compounds of the invention may eliC1t the action of one or more enzymes or structural proteins to effect modification of the target nucleic aC1d.<br>
One non-limiting example of such an enzyme is RNAse H, a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. It is known in the art that single-stranded oligomeric compounds which are "DNA-like" eliC1t RNAse H. Activation of RNase H, therefore, resuhs in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhanC1ng the effiC1ency of<br><br>
oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of gene expression. Similar roles have been postulated for other ribonucleases such as those in the RNase III and ribonuclease L family of enzymes.<br>
While one form of oligomeric compound is a single-stranded antisense oligonucleotide, in many speC1es the introduction of double-stranded structures, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, has been shown to induC6potent and speC1fic antisense-mediated reduction of the function of a gene or its assoC1ated gene products. This phenomenon occurs in both plants and animals and is believed to have an evolutionary connection to viral defense and transposon silenC1ng.<br>
In some embodiments, "suitable target segments" may be employed in a screen for additional oligomeric compoimds that modulate the expression of a selected protein. "Modulators" are those oHgomeric compounds that decrease or increase the expression of a nucleic aC1d molecule encoding a protein and which comprise at least an 8-nucleobase portion which is complementary to a suitable target segment. The screening method comprises the steps of contacting a suitable target segment of a nucleic aC1d molecule encoding a protein with one or more candidate modulators, and selecting for one or more candidate modulators which decrease or increase the expression of a nucleic aC1d molecule encoding a protein. OnC6it is shown that the candidate modulator or modulators are capable of modulating (e.g. either decreasing or increasing) the expression of a nucleic aC1d molecule encoding a peptide, the modulator may then be employed in further investigative studies of the function of the peptide, or for use as a research, diagnostic, or therapeutic agent in accordanC6with the present invention.<br>
The suitable target segments of the present invention may also be combined with their respective complementary antisense oligomeric compounds of the present invention to form stabiUzed double-stranded (duplexed) oHgonucleotides. Such double stranded oligonucleotide moieties have been shown in the art to modulate target expression and regulate translation as well as RNA processsing via an antisense mechanism. Moreover, the double-stranded moieties may be subject to chemical modifications (Fire et al.. Nature, 1998, 391, 806-811;T1mmons and Fire, Nature 1998, 395, 854;T1mmons et al.. Gene, 2001, 263, 103-112; Tabara et al., SC1ence, 1998, 282,430-431; Montgomery et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. SC1. USA, 1998, 95,15502-15507; Tuschl et al.. Genes Dev., 1999,13, 3191-3197; Elbashir et al., Nature, 2001, 411, 494-498; '     Elbashir et al., Genes Dev. 2001,15,188-200). For example, such double-stranded moieties have been shown to inhibit the target by the classical hybridization of antisense strand of the duplex to the target, thereby triggering enzymatic degradation of the target (Tijsterman et al., SC1ence, 2002, 295, 694-697).<br><br>
.    The oligomeric compounds of the present invention can also be applied in the areas of drug discovery and target vaHdation. The present invention comprehends the use of the ohgomeric compoimds and targets identified herein in drug discovery efforts to eluC1date relationships that exist between proteins and a disease state, phenotype, or condition. These methods include detecting or modulating a target peptide comprising contacting a sample,T1ssue, cell, or organism with the oligomeric compounds of the present invention, measuring the nucleic aC1d or protein level of the target and/or a related phenotypic or chemical endpoint at someT1me after treatment, and optionally comparing the measured value to a non-treated sample or sample treated with a further oligomeric compound of the invention. These methods can also be performed in parallel or in combination with other experiments to determine the function of unknown genes for the process of target validation or to determine the validity of a particular gene product as a target for treatment or prevention of a particular disease, condition, or phenotype.<br>
Effect of nucleoside modifications on RNAi activity is evaluated according to existing literature (Elbashir et al., Nature (2001), 411,494-498; Nishikura et al., Cell (2001), 107,415-416; and Bass et al.. Cell (2000), 101,235-238.)<br>
The ohgomeric compounds of the present invention can be utilized for diagnostiC6, therapeutiC6, prophylaxis and as research reagents and kits. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides, which are able to inhibit gene expression with exquisite speC1fiC1ty, are often used by those of ordinary skill to eluC1date the fiinction of particular genes or to distinguish between fimctions of various members of a biological pathway.<br>
For use in kits and diagnostiC6, the oligomeric compounds of the present invention, either alone or in combination with other oligomeric compounds or therapeutiC6, can be used as tools in differential and/or combinatorial analyses to eluC1date expression patterns of a portion or the entirecomplement of genes expressed within cells andT1ssues.<br>
As one nonlimiting example, expression patterns within cells orT1ssues treated with one or more oligomeric compounds are compared to control cells orT1ssues not treated with oligomeric compounds and the patterns produced are analyzed for differential levels of gene expression as they pertain, for example, to disease assoC1ation, signaling pathway, cellular localization, expression level, size, structure or function of the genes examined. These analyses can be performed on stimulated or unstimulated cells and in the presenC6or absenC6of other compounds and or oligomeric compounds which affect expression patterns.<br>
Examples of methods of gene expression analysis known in the art include DNA arrays or microarrays (Brazma and Vilo, FEBS Lett., 2000, 480,17-24; Cells, et al, FEES Lett., 2000,<br><br>

Cell Biochem. Suppl., 1998, 31,286-96), FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) techniques (Going and Gusterson, Eur. J. Cancer, 1999, 35,1895-904) and mass spectrometry methods (To, Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen, 2000, 3, 235-41).<br>
The oligomeric compounds of the invention are useful for research and diagnostics, because these oligomeric compounds hybridize to nucleic acids encoding proteins. For example, oligonucleotides that are shown to hybridize with such efficiency and under such conditions as disclosed herein as to be effective protein inhibitors will also be effective primers or probes under conditions favoring gene amplification or detection, respectively. These primers and probes are useful in methods requiring the specific detection of nucleic acid molecules encoding proteins and in the amplification of the nucleic acid molecules for detection or for use in further studies. Hybridization of the antisense oligonucleotides, particularly the primers and probes, of the invention with a nucleic acid can be detected by means known in the art. Such means may include conjugation of an enzyme to the oligonucleotide, radiolabelling of the oligonucleotide or any other suitable detection means.

Phosphodiester intemucleotide linkages are afforded by oxidation with aqueous iodine. Phosphorothioate intemucleotide linkages are generated by sulfurization utilizing 3,H-1,2 benzodithiole-3-one 1,1 dioxide (Beaucage Reagent) in anhydrous acetonitrile. Standard base-protected beta-cyanoethyl-diiso-propyl phosphoramidites are purchased from commerC1al vendors (e.g. PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster C1ty, CA, or PharmaC1a, Piscataway, NJ). Non¬standard nucleosides are synthesized as per standard or patented methods. They are utilized as base protected beta-cyanoethyldiisopropyl phosphoramidites.<br>
Oligonucleotides are cleaved frorn support and deprotected with concentrated NH4OH at elevated temperature (55-60°C) for 12-16 hours and the released product then dried in vacuo.<br><br>
The dried product is then re-suspended in sterile water to afford a master plate from which all analytical and test plate samples are then diluted utilizing robotic pipettors.<br>
Example 26<br>
Oligonucleotide Analysis using 96-Well Plate Format<br>
The concentration of oligonucleotide in each well is assessed by dilution of samples and UV absorption spectroscopy. The fiill-length integrity of the individual products is evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (CE) in either the 96-well format (Beckman P/ACE™ MDQ) or, for individually prepared samples, on a commerC1al C6apparatus (e.g., Beckman P/ACE™ 5000, ABI270). Base and backbone composition is confirmed by mass analysis of the oligomeric compounds utilizing electrospray-mass spectroscopy. All assay test plates are diluted from the master plate using single and multi-channel robotic pipettors. Plates are judged to be acceptable if at least 85% of the oligomeric compounds on the plate are at least 85% full length.<br>
Example 27<br>
Cell culture and oligonucleotide treatment<br>
The effect of oligomeric compounds on target nucleic aC1d expression can be tested in any of a variety of cell types provided that the target nucleic aC1d is present at measurable levels. This can be routinely determined using, for example, PCR or Northern blot analysis. Cell lines derived from multipleT1ssues and speC1es can be obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).<br>
The following cell type is provided for illustrative purposes, but other cell types can be routinely used, provided that the target is expressed in the cell type chosen. This can be readily determined by methods routine in the art, for example Northern blot analysis, ribonuclease protection assays or RT-PCR.<br>
b.END cells: The mouse brain endothelial cell Une b.END was obtained from Dr. Werner Risau at the Max Plank Institute (Bad Nauheim, Germany). b.END cells were routinely cultured in DMEM, high glucose (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were routinely passaged by trypsinization and dilution when they reached approximately 90% confluence. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Falcon-Primaria #353872, BD BiosC1ences, Bedford, MA) at a density of approximately 3000 cells/well for uses including but not limited to oligomeric compound transfection experiments.<br>
Experiments involving freatment of cells with oligomeric compounds:<br><br>
When cells reach appropriate confluency, they are treated with oligomeric compounds using a transfection method as described. LIPOFECTIN™<br>
When cells reached 65-75% confluency, they are treated with oligonucleotide. Oligonucleotide is mixed with LIPOFECTIN'"'^ Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in Opti-MEIvr'^-1 reduced serum medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to achieve the desired concentration of oligonucleotide and a LIPOFECTIN'^'^ concentration of 2.5 or 3 fig/mL per 100 nM oligonucleotide. This transfection mixture is incubated at room temperature for approximately 0.5 hours. For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells are washed onC6with 100 |iL OPTI-MEM™-! and then treated with 130 |iiL of the transfection mixture. Cells grown in 24-well plates or other standardT1ssue culture plates are treated similarly, using appropriate volumes of medium and oligonucleotide. Cells are treated and data are obtained in duplicate or triplicate. After approximately 4-7 hours of treatment at 37°C, the medium containing the transfection mixture is replaced with fresh culture medium. Cells are harvested 16-24 hours after oligonucleotide treatment.<br>
Other suitable transfection reagents known in the art include, but are not limited to, CYTOFECTIN™, LIPOFECTAMINE™, OLIGOFECTAMINE™, and FUGENE™. Other suitable transfection methods known in the art include, but are not limited to, electroporation.<br>
