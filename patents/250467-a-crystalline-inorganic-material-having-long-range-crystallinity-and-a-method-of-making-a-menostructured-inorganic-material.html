This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. patent application serial<br>
number 10/830,714, filed on April 23, 2004, and entitled "Mesostructured Zeolitic Materials,<br>
and Methods of Making and Using the Same."<br>
Government Funding<br>
This invention was made with support under Grant Number DAAD19-02-D0002,<br>
awarded by the Army Research Office; the government, therefore, has certain rights in the<br>
invention.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to crystalline inorganic materials having long-range crystallinity<br>
and comprising a plurality of mesopores and to methods of producing a hydrocarbon material<br>
product, processing a polymer and a method of water treatment.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Zeolites and related crystalline molecular sieves are widely used due to their regular<br>
microporous structure, strong acidity, and ion-exchange capability, van Bekkum, H.,<br>
Flanigen, E. M., Jacobs, P. A., Jansen, 1. C. (editors), Introduction to Zeolite Science and<br>
Practice, 2nd edition. Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, Vol. 137 (2001); Corma, A.,<br>
Chem. Rev., 1997, 97, 2373-2419; Davis, M. E., Nature, 2002, 417,813-821. However, their<br>
applications are limited by their small pore openings, which are typically narrower than 1<br>
nm. The discovery ofMCM-41, with tuneable mesopores of2-10 nra, overcomes some of the<br>
limitations associated with zeolites. Corma, A., Chem. Rev., 1997, 97,2373-2419; Kresge, C.<br>
T., et al., Nature, 1992,259, 710-712; Kosslick, H., et al., Appl. Catal. A: Gen., 1999,184,<br>
49-60; Linssen, T., Cassiers, K., Cool, P., Vansant, E. F., Adv. Coll. Interf. Sci., 2003,103,<br>
121-147. However, unlike zeolites, MCM-41-type materials are not crystalline, and do not<br>
possess strong acidity, high hydrothermal stability and high ion-exchange capability, which<br>
are important for certain catalytic applications. Corma, A., Chem. Rev., 1997,97,2373-2419.<br>
Over the past 10 years, a great deal of effort has been devoted to understanding and<br>
improving the structural characteristics ofMCM-41. It was found that the properties of Al-<br>
MCM-41 could be improved through (i) surface silylation, (ii) Al grafting on the pore walls<br>
to increase acidity, (iii) salt addition during synthesis to facilitate the condensation of<br>
aluminosilicate groups, (iv) use of organics typically employed in zeolite synthesis to<br>
transform partially the MCM-41 wall to zeolite-like structures, (v) preparation of<br>
zeolite/MCM~41 composites, (vi) substitution of cationic surfactants by tri-block copolymers<br>
and Gemini amine surfactants to thicken the walls, and (vii) assembly of zeolite nanocrystals<br>
into an ordered mesoporous structure. Liu, Y., Pinnavaia, T. 1., J Mater. Chem., 2002, 12,<br>
3179-3190. In the latter approach, Liu et al. were able to prepare the first steam-stable<br>
hexagonal aluminosilicate (named MSU-S) using zeolite Y nanoclusters as building blocks.<br>
Pentasil zeolite nanoclusters were also used to produce MSU-S(mfi) and MSU-S(bea)).<br>
United States Patent No. 5,849,258 to Lujano et al. aggregates the nuclei of<br>
crystalline microporous molecular sieve material (e.g., the nuclei of zeolites) to provide a<br>
narrowed size distribution of mesopore-sized pore volumes, forming a polycrystalline<br>
material. Figure 1A is a schematic illustration of a prior art amorphous mesoporous material<br>
100, which is described by, for example, Lujano and Pinnavaia. United States Patent No.<br>
5,849,258 to Lujano et al. and Liu, Y., Pinnavaia, T. J., J Mater. Chem., 2002, 12,31793190.<br>
As shown in Figure 1A, zeolite nucleii 105a, 105b, 105e were aggregated around surfactant<br>
micelles under controlled conditions to form a solid. Thereafter, the aggregated nuclei 105a,<br>
105b, 105c are washed in water and dried and the surfactant is extracted to provide a desired<br>
mesopore-sized pore volume 110, forming amorphous mesoporous zeolite nuclei material<br>
100. Each of the zeolite nuclei, for example, 105a, 105b, 105c, is a nanosized crystal. When<br>
they are aggregated the material 100 is polycrystalline because the nuclei material is lacking<br>
the long-range regular lattice structure of the crystalline state (i.e., the aggregated nuclei are<br>
not fully crystalline or truly crystalline).<br>
Some strategies have managed to improve appreciably the acidic properties of Al-<br>
MCM-41 materials. Liu, Y., Pinnavaia, T. J., J. Mater. Chem., 2002,12,3179-3190; van<br>
Donk, S., et al., Catal. Rev., 2003, 45, 297-319; KlOetstra, K. R., et al., Chem. Commun.,<br>
1997, 23, 2281-2282; Corma, A., Nature, 1998, 396, 353-356; Karlsson, A., et al.,<br>
Microporous Mesoporous Mater., 1999, 27, 181-192; Jacobsen, C. 1. H., et al., J. Am. Chem.<br>
Soc, 2000,122, 7116-7117; Huang L., et al., J. Phys. Chem. B., 2000, 104, 2817-2823; On,<br>
D. T., et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed, 2001, 17, 3248-3251; Liu, Y., et al., Angew. Chem. Int.<br>
Ed, 2001, 7, 1255-1258. However, due to the lack of long-range crystallinity in these<br>
materials, their acidity was not as strong as those exhibited by zeolites. Corma, A., Chem.<br>
Rev., 1997, 97, 2373-2419. For example, semicrystalline mesoporous materials, such as<br>
nanocrystalline aluminosilicate PNAs and A1-MSU-S(mFI), even being more active than<br>
conventional Al-MCM-41, showed significantly lower activity than H-ZSM-5 for cumene<br>
cracking; the catalyst activity for this reaction has usually been correlated to the Bronsted<br>
acid strength of the catalyst. Corma, A., Chem. Rev., 1997, 97, 2373-2419; Liu, Y.,<br>
Pinnavaia, T. J., J. Mater. Chem., 2002, 12, 3179-3190; Kloetstra, K. R., et al., Chem.<br>
Commun., 1997, 23, 2281-2282; Jacobsen, C. J. H., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2000, 122,<br>
7116-7117.<br>
Previous attempts to prepare mesostructured zeolitic materials have been ineffective,<br>
resulting in separate zeolitic and amorphous mesoporous phases. Karlsson, A., et al.,<br>
Microporous Mesoporous Mater., 1999, 27, 181-192; Huang L., et al., J. Phys. Chem. B.,<br>
2000, 104, 2817-2823.<br>
Moreover, some authors pointed out the difficulty of synthesizing thin-walled<br>
mesoporous materials, such as MCM-41, with zeolitic structure, due to the surface tension<br>
associated with the high curvature of the mesostructure. Liu, Y., Pinnavaia, T. J., J. Mater.<br>
Chem., 2002, 12, 3179-3190. Thus, the need exists for zeolite single crystals with ordered<br>
mesoporosity, and methods of making and using them.<br>

family of ordered mesoporous materials has been greatly expanded by the use of different<br>
surfactants and synthesis conditions. Corma, A., Chem. Rev., 1997, 97, 2373-2419; Davis, M.<br>
E., Nature, 2002, 417, 813 - 821; Galo, J. de A. A., et al., Chem. Rev., 2002, 102, 4093-4138;<br>
Ying, J.Y., et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed, 1999, 38, 56-77. The family of fully crystalline<br>
mesostructured zeolites disclosed herein is a one-phase hybrid material consisting of a<br>
zeolitic structure with controlled mesoporosity, which bridges the gap between crystalline<br>
microporous and amorphous mesoporous materials. In accordance with the instant invention,<br>
a surfactant is employed to penetrate a fully crystalline zeolite structure forming pores, more<br>
specifically, forming a plurality of mesopores throughout at least a portion of the volume of<br>
the fully crystalline zeolite structure. An mesopore surface surrounds each mesopore within<br>
the mesostructure. Full crystallinity includes all solids with one or more phases including<br>
having repeating structures, referred to as unit cells, that repeat in a space for at least 10 nm.<br>
A fully crystalline zeolite structure may have, for example, single crystallinity, mono<br>
crystallinity, or multi crystallinity. Multi crystallinity includes all solids having more than<br>
one phase having repeating structures, referred to as unit cells, that repeat in a space for at<br>
least 10 nm. A fully crystalline zeolite is exposed to the surfactant, for a time, under<br>
temperature, and pH conditions suitable to achieve a desired mesopore structure throughout<br>
all or a portion of the volume of the fully crystalline zeolite. It is expected that any fully<br>
crystalline inorganic material would have a similar structure, would similarly be produced,<br>
and/or would similarly be employed where, for example, a zeolite, a fully crystalline zeolite,<br>
or zeolites are described.<br>
In contrast with Figure 1A, Figure 1B is a schematic illustration of a fully crystalline<br>
mesostructured zeolite 200 of the instant invention, which features a fully crystalline zeolite<br>
structure 205 with mesopores 210 penetrating throughout the volume of the zeolite structure<br>
205. The mesostructure 215 that surrounds the mesopores 210 is fully crystalline. The pore<br>
wall or interior wall between adjacent mesopores has a wall thickness 230. As illustrated in<br>
Figure 1B, the mesostructure 215 and the mesopores 210 are viewed from a side 220 of the<br>
zeolite structure 205. Although not depicted in this schematic illustration, the mesostructure<br>
and the mesopores can be viewed from other sides of the mesostructured zeolite 200.<br>
Referring now to Figures 1A and 1B, unlike the fully crystalline mesostructure 215 of<br>
the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite 200 of the instant invention, in the aggregated<br>
crystalline mesoporous zeolite nuclei material 100, the pore walls that surround the<br>
mesopore-sized pore volume 110 are discontinuous, featuring multiple zeolite nuclei crystals<br>
e.g., 105a, 105b, 105c.<br>
The synthesis of fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites is applicable to a wide<br>
variety of materials. The first strategy is based on the short-range reorganization of a zeolite<br>
structure in the presence of a surfactant to accommodate mesoporosity without loss of<br>
zeolitic full crystallinity. A zeolite is added to a pH controlled solution containing a<br>
surfactant. Alternatively, a zeolite is added to a pH controlled solution and thereafter a<br>
surfactant is added. The pH controlled solution can be, for example, a basic solution with a<br>
pH ranging from about 8 to about 12, or from about 9 to about 11, or alternatively, the basic<br>
solution pH can be about 10. The strength of the base and the concentration of the basic<br>
solution are selected to provide a pH within the desired range. Any suitable base can be<br>
employed that falls within the desired pH range.<br>
Suitable surfactants that can be employed in accordance with the invention include<br>
cationic, ionic, neutral surfactants and/or combinations. The quantity of surfactant is varied<br>
according to, for example, the surfactant and the zeolite that are mixed. For example, in one<br>
embodiment, the weight of surfactant is about equal to the weight of zeolite added to the<br>
solution. Alternatively, the weight of surfactant can be about half of the weight of zeolite<br>
added to the solution.<br>
The mixture is hydrothermally treated for a period of time that is selected to allow the<br>
fully crystalline zeolite to achieve a desired mesostructure, for example, a H-Y[MCM-41] is<br>
a fully crystalline acidic form of faujasite having a fully crystalline mesostructure<br>
surrounding a hexagonal pore arrangement. Similarly, a H-Y[MCM-48] is a fully crystalline<br>
acidic form of faujasite having a fully crystalline mesostructure surrounding a cubic pore<br>
arrangement, and a H-Y[MCM-50] is a fully crystalline acidic form of faujasite having a<br>
having a fully crystalline mesostructure surrounding a lamellar pore arrangement, etc.<br>
Generally, the time and temperature are related such that a higher temperature requires a<br>
shorter period of time to achieve a desired mesoporosity and a certain mesostructure as<br>
compared to a lower temperature, which would require a relatively longer period of time to<br>
achieve the same mesoporosity. Because time and temperature are related, any suitable<br>
combination of time and temperature may be employed when hydrothermally treating the<br>
mixture. For example, the temperature ranges from about room temperature to about 60 °C,<br>
alternatively, the temperature ranges from 100 to about 200°C. Where the temperature is<br>
about 60 °C or greater, the controlled temperature conditions take place under hydrothermal<br>
conditions, for example, in a sealed reactor. The time ranges from about one hour to about<br>
two weeks.<br>
In two synthesis experiments, the parameters of time, temperature, zeolite type and<br>
quantity, and surfactant type and quantity are kept constant, however, the pH in the first<br>
synthesis is 9 and the pH in the second synthesis is 11. As a result of the different pH values<br>
in the two synthesis experiments, the two fully crystalline zeolite mesostructures differ from<br>
one another. Specifically, the fully crystalline zeolite mesostructure synthesized with the 9<br>
pH solution features fewer mesopore surfaces, because fewer mesopores were incorporated<br>
into the conventional fully crystalline zeolite, compared to the fully crystalline zeolite<br>
mesostructure synthesized with the 11 pH, which has more mesopore surfaces, because the<br>
higher base concentration resulted in increased mesoporosity.<br>
In an exemplary synthesis, a zeolite is added to a diluted NH40H solution containing<br>
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactants. The mixture is hydrothermally<br>
treated at about 100 to about 200 °C, about 120 to about 180 °C, about 140 to about 160 °C,<br>
or about 150 °C for about 20 hr or overnight during which the zeolite structure undergoes<br>
short-range rearrangements to accommodate the MCMA1 type of mesostructure. Higher<br>
surfactant concentrations and longer hydrothermal treatments would produce mesostructured<br>
zeolites with the MCM-48 type of mesostructure. After washing and drying, the surfactant is<br>
removed by, for example, calcination or surfactant extraction. In one embodiment, the<br>
resulting material is calcined in N2 at a maximum temperature from about 500 to 600°C, or at<br>
about 550°C; and then in air for surfactant removal. The surfactant removal technique is<br>
selected based, for example, on the time needed to remove all of the surfactant from the<br>
mesostructured zeolites. This synthetic scheme could be used to produce mesostructured<br>
zeolites with various zeolitic structures.<br>
Without being bound to anyone theory, it is believed that the controlled pH solution<br>
softens the conventional fully crystalline zeolite surface enabling the surfactant to penetrate<br>
the zeolite creating the mesostructured zeolite. More specifically, the pH conditions that are<br>
employed enable the surfactant to penetrate the structure of the zeolite however the pH<br>
conditions do not dissolve the zeolite. As the surfactant penetrates the zeolite, forming<br>
mesopores, the penetrated portion is exposed to the controlled pH solution and is softened,<br>
enabling further penetration by the surfactant. The penetration continues in this fashion<br>
throughout the volume of the zeolite. The penetration through the zeolite volume may be in<br>
any single direction or in a combination of directions, for example, the penetration may be<br>
through the x direction, the y direction, the z direction, or any combination thereof The<br>
penetration direction or rate is not necessarily linear. Penetration may be ordered or<br>
optionally the penetration and consequently the mesopores may be disordered or random.<br>
Optionally, one or more of the mesopores intersect, interconnect, converge, and/or align,<br>
which impacts the arrangement of the resulting mesoporous fully crystalline mesostructure.<br>
The surfactant enables penetration into the fully crystalline zeolite, creating mesopores. The<br>
type of surfactant determines, at least in part, the size of the mesopore including, for<br>
example, the size of the mesopore diameter and/or the size of the mesopore cross section.<br>
Penetration into the conventional fully crystalline zeolite is not observed where a controlled<br>
pH solution, for example, a base having a pH of 10, held at controlled time and temperature<br>
conditions is mixed with a zeolite without a surfactant.<br>
Certain conventional fully crystalline zeolites are very stable (e.g., ZSM-5, MOR,<br>
CHA etc.) and it is difficult to incorporate mesoporosity into these zeolites. In such cases,<br>
strong base having, for example, a pH ranging from about 11 to about 14, or from about 12 to<br>
about 13, or an acid, for example, HF having, for example, a pH ranging from about 2 to<br>
about 6, or from about 3 to about 5, or at about 4, is necessary to dissolve silica and soften<br>
the conventional fully crystalline zeolite surface to enable the surfactant to penetrate and<br>
create mesopores through the fully crystalline zeolite.<br>
Conventional fully crystalline zeolites with a dense structure (e.g. ZSM-5) are more<br>
resistant to acids and basis relative to fully crystalline zeolites with less dense structures.<br>
Zeolites with a low solubility (e.g. ZSM-5) and/or a dense structure are relatively stable with<br>
respect to penetration by acids and bases, accordingly, a diluted tetramethyl ammonium<br>
hydroxide (TMA-OH) having a pH ranging from about 10 to about 14 or a solution of acid,<br>
for example hydrofluoric acid, HF, having a pH ranging from about 2 to about 6 can be used<br>
instead of a dilute NH4OH solution, having a pH ranging from about 9 to about 10, in the<br>
synthesis scheme. More specifically, base treatment alone, even at very high pH, is not<br>
sufficient to soften some of the very stable zeolites. The acid HF dissolves silica and softens<br>
the structure of the densely structured conventional fully crystalline zeolite (e.g., ZSM-5).<br>
After softening the conventional fully crystalline zeolite by exposing it to HF, the pH is<br>
increased by including a base solution having a pH from about 9 to about 11 and a suitable<br>
surfactant is added in a quantity selected according to, for example, the quantity of zeolite<br>
and the desired mesosporosity volume. The mixture is exposed to appropriate time and<br>
temperature conditions to provide the desired mesoporosity and resulting mesostructure in a<br>
fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite.<br>
In another exemplary synthesis, a fully crystalline zeolite is added to an acid solution<br>
having a pH from about -2 to about 2, or from about -1 to about 1, or at about 0, containing a<br>
neutral surfactant, for example, PLURONIC(C) (available from BASF (Florham Park, NJ).<br>
The mixture is exposed to appropriate temperature conditions for a period oftime selected to<br>
achieve a desired mesostructure. The mixture can be held at room temperature and stirred for<br>
from about 1 day to about 1 week. Alternatively, the mixture is hydrothermally treated. In<br>
one embodiment, the mixture is hydrothermally treated at about 120°C for from about 4<br>
hours to about 1 week. The resulting mesopores having a pore diameter measuring from<br>
about 5 to 60 nm. An mesopore surface surrounds each mesopore of the mesostructure.<br>
The mesopore size and architecture may also be conveniently tuned by well-known<br>
techniques, such as the use of surfactants with different aliphatic chain lengths, non-ionic<br>
surfactants, triblock copolymers, swelling agents, etc. For example, use of a surfactant with<br>
longer chain length increases pore size and conversely, use of surfactant with a shorter chain<br>
length decreases pore size. For example, use of a swelling agent will expand the surfactant<br>
micelles. Any of these mesopore size and mesostructure architecture altering properties may<br>
be used either alone or in combination. Also, post-synthesis treatments (e.g., silanation,<br>
grafting, surface functionalization, ion-exchange, immobilization of homogeneous catalysts<br>
and deposition of metal nanoclusters) could be employed to further improve the textural<br>
properties of the materials and/or modify their surface chemistry.<br>
Another aspect of the invention features mesostructures, e.g., as illustrated in Figure<br>
1C. Such mesostructures can be achieved based on the dissolution of a zeolite in a pH<br>
controlled medium, either in an acidic or basic medium, followed by hydrothermal treatment<br>
in the presence of a surfactant. Suitable surfactants that may be employed include cationic,<br>
ionic, neutral surfactants, and/or combinations of the cationic, ionic, and neutral surfactants.<br>
The quantity of surfactant is varied according to, for example, the selected surfactant and the<br>
selected zeolite. For example, the weight of surfactant can be about equal to the weight of<br>
zeolite added to the solution, alternatively, the weight of surfactant can be about half of the<br>
weight of zeolite added to the solution. Where the pH controlled medium is basic, the pH that<br>
dissolves the zeolite ranges from about 10 to about 14. Where the pH controlled medium is<br>
acidic, the pH that dissolves the zeolite ranges from about -2 to about 2, when using HF, the<br>
pH range is from about 2 to about 6. Under these more extreme pH conditions, a mesoporous<br>
solid was obtained wherein the pore walls were initially amorphous. The pore walls can later<br>
be transformed to a zeolitic phase, with or without affecting the mesoporous structure. More<br>
specifically, after the zeolite is exposed to this aggressive pH treatment, the pH is adjusted to<br>
about 10 by adding, for example NH4OH, and surfactant (e.g., CTAB) to produce self-<br>
assembling partially dissolved zeolites. This synthesis mixture can be hydrothermally treated<br>
or stirred at room temperature over a period of time to obtain a highly stable mesoporous<br>
amorphous aluminosilicate. More specifically, if the synthesis mixture is hydrothermally<br>
treated at, for example, from about 100 to about 150°C, a highly stable mesoporous<br>
amorphous aluminosilicate is obtained. Alternatively, the synthesis mixture is stirred at room<br>
temperature for sufficient time (from about 4 hours to about 1 day) to obtain a highly stable<br>
mesoporous amorphous aluminosilicate. The mesoporous amorphous aluminosilicate<br>
maintains its mesoporosity after boiling for 48 hours under reflux conditions. The acidity of<br>
the material produced is higher than that of amorphous mesoporous materials obtained from<br>
non-zeolitic silica and alumina sources. Where the synthesis mixture is hydrothermally<br>
treated for a longer period of time (from about 12 hours to about 2 weeks) a zeolitic<br>
mesostructure is obtained. By adjusting the synthesis conditions (e.g., pH, time, temperature,<br>
zeolite type, surfactant concentration) different zeolite nanostructures, for example,<br>
nanotubes, nanorings, nanorods, nanowires, nanoslabs, nanofibers, nanodiscs, etc. can be<br>
produced. Referring again to Figure 1C, a nanostructure including, for example, nanorods is<br>
made from adjacent members (e.g., a first nanorod adjacent a second nanorod). Voids can be<br>
formed between adjacent members (e.g., adjacent nanorods). Each nanostructure member<br>
defines a plurality of pores (e.g., each nanorod has pores in its structure). Different members<br>
can join together within a single nanostructure, for example, a nanorod may be adjacent a<br>
nanoring.<br>
Zeolitic nanorods (ZNRs) have been prepared by this approach in three steps: (i)<br>
basic treatment of a zeolite in a pH controlled medium to partially dissolve the zeolite and<br>
produce a suspension of amorphous aluminosilicate, (ii) pH adjustment and surfactant<br>
addition to produce MCM-41, and (iii) hydrothermal treatment of the resulting solid at a<br>
temperature typically ranging from about 100 to about 200°C for from about 12 hours to<br>
about 2 weeks. During the last step, the MCM-41 (the hexagonal pore arrangement)<br>
mesostructure is first transformed to MCM-48 (the cubic pore arrangement) and is then<br>
transformed to MCM-50 (the lamellar pore arrangement), while the amorphous pore walls<br>
are transformed to a crystalline zeolitic phase. MCM-50 is a lamellar structure and is a<br>
precursor to zeolitic nanostructures including, for example, nanotubes, nanorings, nanorods,<br>
nanowires, nanoslabs, etc. The specific nanostructure formed by using steps (i)-(iii) is<br>
determined by the selected zeolite, surfactant, temperature, time, and pH. The zeolite and<br>
other conditions can be selected to achieve a single nanostructure shape (e.g., all nanorod) or,<br>
alternatively, multiple nanostructure shapes. Without being bound to any single theory, it<br>
appears that nanostructures are achieved, at least in part, because the zeolite dissolved by a<br>
pH controlled solution into a suspension of amorphous aluminosilicate retains some degree<br>
of the zeolitic connectivity that is characteristic of a zeolite starting material. It is expected<br>
that some of the 1R spectra bands characteristic of zeolites remain present in the dissolved<br>
solution, i.e., in the suspension of amorphous aluminosilicate. In contrast, if rather than<br>
dissolving a zeolite to produce a suspension of amorphous aluminosilicate an alumina, a<br>
slilica, or an amorphous aluminosilicate were exposed to steps (ii)-(iii), described above, the<br>
nanostructure fails to form. The building blocks of connectivity present in dissolved zeolite<br>
solution appear to playa part in forming nanostructures.<br>
Although the nanostructures are crystalline they are not fully crystalline. They have a<br>
few units in one direction and are semi crystalline or are polycrystalline. Semi crystalline and<br>
polycrystalline refers to, for example, nanosized crystals, crystal nuclei, or crystallites that,<br>
for example, aggregate to form a solid. Unit cells are the simplest repeating unit in a<br>
crystalline structure or crystalline material. Nanostructures have an open structure. They have<br>
a high surface area due to an extended structure in the space as well as due to spaces between<br>
multiple structures or voids within the structures themselves. Generally, these nanostructures<br>
also have a high external surface area. In one embodiment, one nanostructure is adjacent<br>
another nanostructure. Figure 1C depicts a TEM image of a nanosostructured zeolite of the<br>
present invention where the nanostructure shape includes nanorods. The nanorods have a<br>
thickness measuring about 5 run. As depicted, the nanorods sit adjacent one another and the<br>
nanorods curve. The background of the curved rods seen in the TEM image is noise and it<br>
should be ignored.<br>
Zeolite-like materials, which represent a growing family of inorganic and<br>
organic/inorganic molecular sieves, may also be used as precursors for the synthesis of<br>
mesostructured zeolites, since the synthetic approaches described above may be adapted for a<br>
wide variety of materials.<br>
The mesostructured zeolites and methods ofmaking the mesostructured zeolites of the<br>
instant invention utilize available, inexpensive, non-toxic, non-waste producing materials.<br>
Previous attempts an improved porosity in zeolites required more steps, exercised limited<br>
control on the final structure, and employed more expensive and toxic materials. The method<br>
improves on the material cost and production efficiency of prior art processes, requiring<br>
fewer steps to achieve improved porosity in zeolites. In addition, the methods of the<br>
invention produce fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites. The methods of the invention<br>
also produce nanostructured zeolites having a high surface area.<br>
Structure of Mesostructured Zeolites<br>
The hybrid structure of the mesostructured zeolites was studied via XRD. Figures 1D-<br>
3 show the XRD patterns of H-Y[MCM-41], H-MOR[MCM-41], and H-ZSM-5[MCM-41],<br>
respectively. As used herein, the naming convention for mesostructured zeolites, e.g., H-<br>
Y[MCM-41] first includes the starting zeolite structure, e.g., H-Y and then, placed adjacent,<br>
in brackets, is the name of the mesostructure, e.g., [MCM-41]. The mesostructured zeolite H-<br>
Y[MCM-41] retains the full crystallinity of the zeolite H-Y, and features hexagonal pores<br>
[MCM-41]. The fully crystalline mesostructure surrounds these hexagonal mesopores that<br>
have been formed by the invention. Thus, the resulting structure is a fully crystalline H-Y<br>
material that features an [MCM-41] type of mesostructure. For convenience, this is<br>
designated as H-Y[MCM-41].<br>
Figure ID depicts the X-ray diffraction pattern of the mesostructured zeolite H-<br>
Y[MCM-41] and both the ordered mesostructure MCM-41 (revealed by the XRD peaks at<br>
low angles) and the zeolitic fully crystalline structure H-Y are present. Figure 2 depicts the<br>
X-ray diffraction pattern of the mesostructured zeolite H-MOR[MCM-41] and both the<br>
ordered mesostructure MCM-41 (revealed by the XRD peaks at low angles) and the zeolitic<br>
crystalline structure H-MOR are present. Figure 3 depicts the X-ray diffraction pattern of the<br>
mesostructured zeolite H-ZSM-5 [MCM-41] and both the ordered mesostructure MCM-41<br>
(revealed by the XRD peaks at low angles) and the zeolitic crystalline structure H-ZSM-5 are<br>
present. Referring now to Figures 1D-3, very intense peaks, both at low and high 29° values<br>
reveal both the ordered mesostructure and the zeolitic crystallinity of this family of materials.<br>
In all cases, the peaks at low 20° values can be indexed to hexagonal symmetry indicating the<br>
presence ofMCM-41, whereas the well-defined XRD peaks at high 29° values correspond,<br>
respectively, to the zeolites Y, MOR and ZSM-5. This observation is remarkable since no<br>
long-range crystallinity has been previously observed in mesoporous metal oxides and only<br>
semicrystallinity (due to the presence of zeolite nanoclusters) has been achieved in thick-wall<br>
mesoporous materials prepared using triblock copolymers. Kloetstra, K. R., et al, Chem.<br>

The connectivity of the mesostructured zeolites was studied by infrared spectroscopy<br>
(FTIR) (See Figures 4-5). Figure 4 depicts FTIR characterization peaks for the fully<br>
crystalline mesostructured zeolite H-Y[MCM-41], labeled Meso-H-Y, and zeolite Y.<br>
Referring still to Figure 4, the FTIR spectra of the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite H-<br>
Y[MCM-41], labeled Meso-H-Y, is on the top and the FTIR spectra of the unmodified<br>
conventional fully crystalline zeolite H-Y is on the bottom. Figure 5 depicts FTIR spectra of<br>
H-Y[MCM-41] (upper top), H-MOR[MCM-41] (upper middle), H-ZSM-5 [MCM-41] (upper<br>
bottom) and FTIR spectra of their fully crystalline zeolitic versions in conventional,<br>
unmodified form, H-Y (lower top), H-MOR (lower middle), H-ZSM-5 (lower bottom). The<br>
spectra of the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite H-Y[MCM-41] is the upper top spectra<br>
and the spectra of the unmodified fully crystalline zeolite H-Y is the lower top spectra. The<br>
spectra of the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite H-MOR[MCM-41] is the upper middle<br>
spectra and the spectra of the unmodified fully crystalline zeolite H-MOR is the lower middle<br>
spectra. The spectra of the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite H-ZSM-5[MCM41] is the<br>
upper bottom spectra and the spectra of the unmodified fully crystalline zeolite H-ZSM-5 is<br>
the lower bottom spectra. In Figure 5 a match between each rally crystalline mesostructured<br>
zeolite and its corresponding unmodified fully crystalline zeolite is observed, indicating the<br>
zeolitic connectivity is present in fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites. Figure 5 shows a<br>
remarkable match between the IR spectra of the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites H-<br>
Y[MCM-41], H-MOR[MCM-41], and H-ZSM-5[MCM-41] and those of the their<br>
corresponding unmodified fully crystalline zeolitic versions, H-Y , H-MOR, H-ZSM-5,<br>
contrary to highly stable AI-MCM-41, which presents only one IR broad peak, due to<br>
imperfect zeolitic connectivity. Liu, Y., Pinnavaia, T.J., J. Mater. Chem., 2002, 12, 3179-<br>
3190; Kloetstra, K. R., et al., Chem. Commun, 1997, 23, 2281-2282; Liu, Y. et al., Angew.<br>
Chem. Int. Ed, 2001, 7, 1255-1258. The peak at 960 cm"1 in the H-Y[MCM-41]<br>
mesostructured zeolite sample, characteristic of silanol groups on the wall surfaces, is an<br>
additional evidence of the mesoporous/zeolitic hybrid nature of mesostructured zeolites.<br>
Geidel, E., et al., Microporous andMesoporous Materials, 2003, 65, 31-42.<br>
The presence of well-defined mesoporosity in mesostructured zeolites can be suitably<br>
studied by nitrogen physisorption at 77 K. Storck, S., et al., Applied Catalysis A: General,<br>
10 1998, 17, 137-146. Figures 6-8 show the nitrogen isotherms at 77 K of the fully<br>
crystalline mesostructured zeolites, H-Y[MCM-41], H-MOR[MCM-41], and H-ZSM-<br>
5[MCM-41], respectively, and their unmodified zeolitic versions, H-Y, H-MOR, and H-<br>
ZSM-5. The presence of well developed narrow pore size diameter distribution mesoporosity<br>
is evident in each mesostructured sample. The pore size of the mesoporosity is controlled<br>
such that a diameter and or a cross sectional area of each of the mesopores in a specific fully<br>
crystalline mesostructured zeolite fall within a narrow pore size diameter distribution. In<br>
accordance with the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites of the invention, in one<br>
embodiment, more than 95% of the mesopores has a pore size (e.g., a diameter and/or a cross<br>
sectional area) that falls within plus or minus 10% of the average pore size. In another<br>
embodiment, more than 95% of the mesopores has a pore size (e.g., a diameter and/or a cross<br>
sectional area) that falls within plus or minus 30% of the average pore size. In still another<br>
embodiment, more than 95% of the mesopores has a pore size (e.g., a diameter and/or a cross<br>
sectional area) that falls within plus or minus 75% of the average pore size. Each pore wall or<br>
mesopore surface that surrounds a diameter controlled mesopore is substantially similar in<br>
size. The fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites of the invention have controlled<br>
mesoporosity pore size cross sectional area. Where the mesopores are substantially<br>
cylindrical in shape in addition to having a pore size cross sectional area these pores have a<br>
pore size diameter. However, where the shape of the mesopores are not cylinder like and are,<br>
for example, slit shaped, worm-like, e.g., with a changing diameter throughout at least a<br>
portion of the depth of the mesopore surface that surrounds an exemplary mesopore, or non<br>
defined shapes then at least a portion of such a mesopore surface has a controlled mesopore<br>
cross sectional area. The size of the mesopores is controlled by, for example, the selected<br>
surfactant and/or quantity of surfactant used when making a fully crystalline mesostructured<br>
zeolite from a conventional unmodified fully crystalline zeolite. Prior attempts to incorporate<br>
mesostructures into zeolites have been unable to achieve such a controlled mesoporosity that<br>
result in substantially all mesopores in a zeolite having a substantially similar size (e.g.,<br>
diameter and/or cross sectional area) and a controlled pore arrangement (e.g., [MCM-41]<br>
having a hexagonal pore arrangement). Rather, prior attempts to form mesostructures in<br>
zeolites result in any or a combination of a broader pore size distribution ranging from small,<br>
medium, to large size pores, different shaped pores, and uncontrolled arrangements.<br>
A significant volume of mesoporosity can be introduced into the sample. For<br>
example, referring to Figure 6, the mesopore volume roughly doubles when the zeolite is<br>
mesostructured. In accordance with principles of the invention, in this example, the<br>
unmodified zeolite H-Y had a mesopore volume of 30 cc/g whereas the fully crystalline<br>
mesostructured zeolite labeled Meso-HY, which is HY[MCM-41], has a mesopore volume of<br>
0.65 cc/g. Conventional zeolites adsorb nitrogen only at low pressures, producing type I<br>
isotherms that are characteristic of microporous materials. Storck, S., et al., Applied<br>
Catalysis A: General, 1998, 17, 137-146. However, the fully crystalline mesostructured<br>
zeolites of the invention show sharp nitrogen uptakes at higher partial pressures (P/Po ~ 0.3),<br>
which is a characteristic feature of mesostructured materials with narrow pore-size<br>
distribution (pore diameter ~ 2.5 nm). Storck, S., et al., Applied Catalysis A: General, 1998,<br>
17, 137-146. Figures 6-8 show similar results for fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites H-<br>
Y[MCM-41], H-MOR[MCM-41], and H-ZSM-5 [MCM-41] and their unmodified<br>
conventional zeolitic versions H-Y, H-MOR, and H-ZSM-5. Figure 9 depicts mesostructured<br>
zeolite pore volumes (darker columns) of H-Y[MCM-41] (left), H-MOR[MCM-41] (center),<br>
and H-ZSM-5[MCM-41] (right) and their zeolitic versions (lighter columns) of H-Y (left),<br>
H-MOR (center), and H-ZSM-5 (right). Compared to conventional zeolites, the fully<br>
crystalline mesostructured zeolites of the invention have more than double the pore volume<br>
(see Figure 9) due to the incorporation of a well-developed, narrow distribution of pore-size<br>
diameter mesoporosity. Referring still to Figure 9, the volume of mesoporosity that is<br>
incorporated can be controlled. The fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite mesoporosity<br>
volume is controlled by, for example, the quantity of surfactant added as a percentage of the<br>
quantity of zeolite. Other factors that contribute to mesoporosity volume include the pH,<br>
time, and temperature conditions employed. In one embodiment, the volume of the controlled<br>
pH medium that is added is an amount suitable to achieve the desired surfactant<br>
concentration in view of the amount of zeolite. The pore volume is expressed in cc/g, the<br>
cubic centimeters of pores over the grams of the zeolite. The fully crystalline mesostructured<br>
zeolite pore volume may range from about 0.05 cc/g to about 2 cc/g, or from about 0.5 cc/g<br>
to about 1 cc/g. The mesopore size is controlled and the mesopore volume is controlled by<br>
the type and the quantity of surfactant used to create the zeolite mesostructure from the<br>
zeolite. The time and temperature conditions also contribute to the mesopore size and/or the<br>
mesopore volume.<br>
The mesostructured zeolites have sharper uptake at low partial pressures, which<br>
indicates the presence of microporosity, and slightly higher pore size. As well known in<br>
surfactant-templated mesoporous solids synthesis, the size of the mesopore in mesostructured<br>
zeolites can be easily tuned or controlled by changing the length of the aliphatic chain of the<br>
surfactant. Corma, A., Chem. Rev. 1997, 97, 2373-2419; Linssen, T., Cassiers, K., Cool, P.,<br>
Vansant, E. P., Advances in Colloid and Interface Science, 2003, 103, 121-147; Ying, J.Y., et<br>
al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 1999, 38, 56-77. Optionally, the mesopore pore size diameter can<br>
also be controlled by, for example, the choice of surfactant and/or the quantity of the<br>
surfactant.<br>
Previous attempts by others to prepare zeolitic mesostructured materials led to phase<br>
separation into zeolite and amorphous mesoporous solids. Karlsson, A., et al., Microporous<br>
and Mesoporous Materials, 1999, 27, 181-192; Huang L., et al., J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000,<br>
104, 2817-2823. Moreover, some authors pointed out the difficulty of making thin-walled<br>
mesoporous materials, such as MCM-41, with zeolitic walls, due to surface tension caused by<br>
the high curvature of the structure. Yang, P., et al., Nature, 1998, 396, 152-155.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite is produced,<br>
as described above, by exposing a conventional zeolite to a suitable pH controlled solution<br>
containing a suitable concentration of a selected surfactant under time and temperature<br>
conditions desired to obtain the a desired mesopore size and mesopore volume. The fully<br>
crystalline mesostructured zeolite retains substantially the same exterior surface contour<br>
(e.g., has substantially the same external size and external shape) and covers substantially the<br>
same perimeter as the unmodified conventional fully crystalline zeolite used to make the<br>
fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite. Suitable unmodified conventional zeolites may range<br>
in size from about 400 nm to about 5 microns. The conditions employed to form the<br>
mesopores do not substantially change the external size, external shape or the perimeter of<br>
the unmodified zeolite. The density of the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite is less than<br>
the density of the unmodified zeolite, however, the density difference is due to the zeolite<br>
removed when the mesopores were formed. In addition, where the fully crystalline<br>
mesostructured zeolite is produced from a fully crystalline conventional unmodified zeolite,<br>
the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite maintains the full crystallinity of the unmodified<br>
conventional zeolite.<br>
Where the unmodified conventional zeolite has a chemical composition in its<br>
framework, after mesopores are formed in the conventional zeolite, the chemical composition<br>
in the resulting fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite framework will remain substantially<br>
the same as the chemical composition in the unmodified conventional zeolite framework that<br>
was used as source material. The chemical composition of the unmodified conventional<br>
zeolite can vary from the external surface (e.g., about the zeolite perimeter) to the inner core.<br>
However, the chemical composition of unmodified conventional zeolite framework, whether<br>
consistent or variable from the perimeter to the inner core of the zeolite, is unchanged when<br>
the mesopores are formed in the zeolite. Thus, forming mesopores to create the fully<br>
crystalline mesostructured zeolite does not chemically alter the framework of the<br>
conventional zeolite. The zeolite stoichiometry is unchanged from the unmodified<br>
conventional fully crystalline zeolite to the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite.<br>
Previous attempts by others to form mesostructures in zeolites has resulted in a<br>
change in the chemical composition of the framework of the unmodified conventional<br>
zeolite. For example, in zeolites containing Si and Al, prior methods treat the zeolite with a<br>
base selected to remove more Al than Si from the zeolite. Where such dealumination<br>
methods are employed, at least a portion of the chemical composition in the framework of the<br>
zeolite changes, specifically, the tetracoordinated alumina ratio changes. Where the methods<br>
of the invention are employed with a zeolite containing Si and Al, in a mesostructured zeolite<br>
of the invention the alumina within the mesostructured zeolite framework remains<br>
tetracoordinated.<br>
Direct evidence for the hybrid single-phase nature of mesostructured zeolites was<br>
obtained via transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). Figures 10a and 10b show two<br>
details of the H-Y [MCM-41] mesostructured zeolite microstructure at different foci in which<br>
both the crystallinity and ordered mesoporosity can be observed in a single phase. Additional<br>
TEM images of mesostructured zeolites are depicted in Figures 11-12.<br>
Additional evidence of the hybrid nature of mesostructured zeolites comes from<br>
catalysis. The presence of mesopores, high surface area, and the thickness of the pore wall or<br>
the interior wall between adjacent mesopores is (~2 nm). This must allow access to bulkier<br>
molecules and reduce intracrystalline diffusion resistance in the fully crystalline<br>
mesostructured zeolites of the invention as compared to conventional unmodified zeolites.<br>
So, enhanced catalytic activity for bulky molecules must be observed in mesostructured<br>
zeolites compared to zeolites.<br>
For example, semicrystalline mesoporous materials, such as nanocrystalline<br>
aluminosilicates PNAs and AI-MSU-S(MFI)' shows significantly lower activity for cumene<br>
cracking (which is usually correlated to strong Bronsted acidity) than conventional H-ZSM-<br>
5. Mesostructured zeolites, however, show even greater activity than zeolites, most likely due<br>
to their fully zeolitic structure and the presence of mesopores. For example, H-ZSM-<br>
5[MCM-41] converts 98% of cumene at 300oC whereas commercial H-ZSM-5 converts 95%<br>
in similar conditions.<br>
The anchoring of chemical species on mesostructured zeolites was confirmed by<br>
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The pure chemical species to be anchored, the mesostructured<br>
zeolites, and the species modified mesostructured zeolites prepared according the method<br>
described herein were all ananlyzed by FTIR. The species modified mesostructured zeolites<br>
exhibited the FTIR bands of the chemical species which did not disappear after washing the<br>
samples.<br>
Some of the chemical species anchored on mesostructured zeolites were used as<br>
ligands for a homogeneous catalysts. This anchoring of a homogeneous catalyst was<br>
confirmed by Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and by catalytic testing of both the<br>
homogeneous catalysts and the homogeneous catalysts anchored on the mesostructured<br>
zeolite. These experiments were repeated after washing the samples and no major changes<br>
were observed, indicating that this method is suitable for anchoring both chemical species<br>
and homogeneous catalysts.<br>
Applications<br>
The unique structure of mesostructured zeolites will be useful to a variety of fields,<br>
and should address certain limitations associated with conventional zeolites. As catalysis is<br>
the most important field of application for zeolites, special emphasis is placed on the<br>
catalytic applications of mesostructured zeolites, van Bekkum, H., Flanigen, E. M., Jacobs, P.<br>
A., Jansen, J. C. (editors). Introduction to Zeolite Science and Practice, 2nd edition. Studies<br>
in Surface Science and Catalysis, 2001, Vol. 137; Corma, A., Chem. Rev. 1997, 97, 2373-<br>
2419; Davis, M. E., Nature 2002, 417, 813-821.<br>
The combination of a mesostructure, a high surface-area, and controlled pore or<br>
interior thickness (~ 2 ran) as measured between adjacent mesopores should provide for<br>
access to bulky molecules and reduce the intracrystalline diffusion barriers. Thus, enhanced<br>
catalytic activity for bulky molecules should be observed over mesostructured zeolites, as<br>
compared to conventional zeolites. See Figures 13-14. Figures 13-20 include reactions with<br>
1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene being catalytically cracked to form 1,3-diisopropyl benzene. The<br>
1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene is representative of molecules present in crude oil and<br>
l,3diisopropyl benzene is representative of a product within the gasoline range. These<br>
experiments are a surrogate for molecules present in crude oil that are cracked to form<br>
gasoline.<br>
Figure 13 depicts the process of catalytic cracking of 1,3,5-triisopropyl benzene by<br>
zeolite H-Y. Catalytic cracking is selectivity and/or efficiency limited, because diffusion is<br>
limited by the small pore size of the zeolite H-Y. Because the conventional unconverted<br>
zeolite crystal has limited diffusion, it is difficult for the reaction product, e.g., 1,3-<br>
diisopropyl benzene, to exit the zeolite. As a result, over cracking occurs and light<br>
compounds are formed resulting in excess formation of undesirable products cumene,<br>
benzene, and coke. Figure 14 depicts the process of catalytic cracking of 1,3,5-triisopropyl<br>
benzene by a mesostructured zeolite of the present invention. In contrast to catalytic cracking<br>
with the unmodified conventional zeolite H-Y, the larger pore size, the controlled mesopore<br>
volume, and the controlled interior or pore wall thickness present in the fully crystalline<br>
mesostructured zeolite, facilitates the exit of desired products, e.g., 1,3- diisopropyl benzene,<br>
from the mesostructure and over cracking that produces cumene, benzene and coke are<br>
avoided. As a result, there is a higher catalytic cracking conversion of the desired product,<br>
1,3-diisopropyl benzene.<br>
Acid catalysts with well-defined ultralarge pores are highly desirable for many<br>
applications, especially for catalytic cracking of the gas oil fraction of petroleum, whereby<br>
slight improvements in catalytic activity or selectivity would translate to significant<br>
economic benefits. Venuto, P. B., Habib, E. T., Jr. Fluid Catalytic Cracking with Zeolite<br>
Catalysts. Marcel Dekker, New York, 1979; Harding, R. H., et al., Appl. Catal. A: Gen.,<br>
2001, 221, 389-396; Degnan, T. F., et al., Microporous Mesoporous Mater., 2000, 35-36,<br>
245-252. As a test reaction, we have examined the catalytic cracking of<br>
l,3,5triisopropylbenzene (critical dimension ~ 0.95 nm) to produce 1,3-diisopropyl benzene.<br>
Figure 15 depicts catalytic activity for 1,3,5-triisopropyl benzene cracking shown as percent<br>
conversion to 1,3-diisopropyl benzene vs. time for the mesostructured zeolite H-Y[MCM-<br>
41], which is labelled Meso-H-Y, the zeolite H-Y, and a conventional AI-MCM-41. Catalytic<br>
cracking was performed when 50 mL/min of He saturated with 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene at<br>
120°C was flowed at 200 °C over 50 mg of each catalyst. The H-Y[ MCM-41]<br>
mesostructured zeolite demonstrated superior catalytic activity for this cracking reaction after<br>
400 min at 200°C (93% conversion) compared to the H-Y zeolite (71% conversion) and the<br>
mesoporous AI-MCM-41 (39% conversion) (see Figure 15). This result was attributed to its<br>
combination of strong acidity and mesostructured nature. The mesopores and the<br>
mesostructure surrounding the mesopores greatly facilitated the hydrocarbon diffusion within<br>
the H-Y[MCM-41] catalyst thereby improving conversion. The H-Y[MCM-41]<br>
mesostructured zeolite is stable and maintains mesostructure integrity even under harsh<br>
conditions. Figure 17 depicts the hydrothermal stability of H-Y[MCM-41], labelled Meso-H-<br>
Y compared to the non-mesolytic zeolite AI-MCM-41. For example, the boiled<br>
mesostructured zeolite H-Y[MCM-41], labelled Meso-H-Y, also maintained its<br>
physicochemical integrity even after being boiled for several days, exhibiting a high 1,3,5-<br>
triisopropylbenzene activity (87% conversion to 1,3-diisopropyl benzene after 400 min) even<br>
after such severe treatment. The term boiled is used for convenience, however, the specific<br>
treatment to the material includes suspending the solid in water and heating the water and<br>
solid material under reflux conditions. See Figure 17. This outcome illustrated the superior<br>
hydrothermal stability of H-Y[MCM-41] over the amorphous AI-MCM-41 catalyst, which<br>
lost its activity and ordered mesostructure after exposure to similar conditions. These results<br>
show that hydrothermally stable H-Y[MCM-41] is a crystalline material and its crystallinity<br>
contrasts the amorphous AI-MCM-41 catalyst that structurally collapsed after boiling,<br>
rendering it unable to convert appreciable quantities via catalytic cracking.<br>
Figure 19 depicts catalytic activity for 1,3,5-triisopropyl benzene cracking shown as<br>
percent conversion vs. time for H-ZSM-5[MCM-41], labeled Meso-H-ZSM-5, and its<br>
zeolitic version, H-ZSM-5. A 50 mL/min of He flow saturated with 1,3,5-<br>
triisopropylbenzene at 120°C was flowed at 200 °C over 50 mg of each catalyst, H-ZSM-<br>
5[MCM-41] and H-ZSM-5. H-ZSM-5 is used as an important additive in cracking catalysts<br>
to increase propylene production and improve octane number in gasoline. Degnan, T. F., et<br>
al., Microporous Mesoporous Mater., 2000, 35-36, 245-252. However, due to its small pores,<br>
H-ZSM-5 is inactive in 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene cracking at 200°C (
1,3-diisopropyl benzene after 400 min). The incorporation ofMCM-41 mesostructure in this<br>
zeolite (H-ZSM-5[MCM-41]) successfully achieved substantial activity, with 40%<br>
conversion of 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene to 1,3-diisopropyl benzene after 400 min (see Figure<br>
19). In this case, the activity was attributed to the mesopores and strong acidity of the<br>
mesostructured zeolite.<br>
More than 135 different zeolitic structures have been reported to date, but only about<br>
a dozen of them have commercial applications, mostly the zeolites with 3-D pore structures.<br>
Corma, A., Chem. Rev., 1997, 97, 2373-2419; Davis, M. E., Nature, 2002, 417, 813-821. The<br>
incorporation of 3-D mesopores would be especially beneficial for zeolites with 1-D and 2-D<br>
pore structures as it would greatly facilitate intracrystalline diffusion. Zeolites with 1-D and<br>
2-D pore structures are not widely used, because the pore structure is less then optimal. To<br>
illustrate the potential of mesostructure processing of zeolites with low pore<br>
interconnectivity, H-MOR with 1-D pores were prepared with a MCM-48 mesostructure by<br>
exposing the H-MOR zeolite with 1-D pores to a pH controlled solution in the presence of a<br>
surfactant under suitable time and temperature conditions, described above. The resulting H-<br>
MOR[MCM-48] with 3-D mesostructured structures was examined for die catalytic cracking<br>
of 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene at 200°C. Figure 18 depicts catalytic activity for<br>
l,3,5triisopropyl benzene cracking shown as conversion to 1,3-diisopropyl benzene vs. time<br>
for H-MOR[MCM-48] labeled Meso-HMOR, and its zeolitic version, H-MOR. A 50 mL/min<br>
of He flow saturated with 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene at 120°C was flowed at 200 °C over 50<br>
mg of each catalyst, H-MOR[MCM-48] and H-MOR. Catalytic cracking with H-<br>
MORfMCM-48] exhibited 50% conversion after 400 min, which was significantly higher<br>
compared to the 7% conversion achieved by H-MOR (see Figure 18). Zeolites with 1-D pore<br>
structures show a more dramatic improvement when exposed to the mesostructure process as<br>
compared to the zeolites with 2-D pore structures, but this is to be expected, because the 1-D<br>
pore structure zeolites begin with a more limited diffusion. When exposed to the<br>
mesostructure process, zeolites with 2-D pore structures result in 3-D mesostructures.<br>
Exposing 1-D and 2-D pore structure zeolites to the instant process for forming<br>
mesostructures in fully crystalline inorganic material, e.g., zeolites, may increase the<br>
usefulness of these otherwise underused zeolites.<br>
Mesostructured zeolites not only showed much higher catalytic activity, but also<br>
enhanced selectivity over zeolites. Referring now to Figure 16, a commercially available<br>
zeolite H-Y was employed to catalytically crack 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene. The resulting<br>
products were 1,3-diisopropyl benzene, benzene, and cumene and the fractional composition<br>
results were normalized to be 100%. The mesostructured zeolite labelled Meso-BY, which is<br>
H-Y[MCM-41], was employed to catalytically crack 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene under<br>
identical conditions employed with H-Y. Increased production of 1,3-diisopropyl benzene<br>
(about 110% of the 1,3-diisopropyl benzene produced with the zeolite H-Y) and decreased<br>
production of benzene and cumene (about 75% of the benzene and cumene produced with the<br>
zeolite H-Y) was observed. In this example, H-Y[MCM-41] mesostructured zeolite produced<br>
only 75% of the benzene generated by the H-Y zeolite. See Figure 16. Benzene is a toxic<br>
compound whose presence in gasoline is being increasingly restricted by legislation. Degnan,<br>
T. F., et al., Microporons Mesoporous Mater., 2000, 35-36, 245-252. The benzene<br>
production was even lower in the case of H-MOR[MCM-48], and was minimal in the case of<br>
H-ZSM-5[MCM-41]. The decrease in benzene production has been observed in small zeolite<br>
crystals, and was related to the intrinsic ability of crystals with higher surface areas to limit<br>
successive cracking reactions. Al-Khattaf, S., et al., Appl. Catal. A: Gen, 2002, 226, 139-153.<br>
It also reduced the formation of coke, which was the undesired end-product of the cracking<br>
process that was responsible for catalyst deactivation. Thus, the mesostructured zeolites not<br>
only provided for higher catalytic activity and selectivity, but also longer catalyst life time.<br>
Zeolitic nanorods (ZNRs), another form of mesostructured zeolite, also enhance<br>
catalytic activity by increasing active-site accessibility. The rod-shape ZNRs are only<br>
nanometer-sized in diameter, so internal diffusional resistance is minimal. These new<br>
mesostructured zeolites (also referred to as nanostructures) were tested as cracking catalysts<br>
for the gas oil fraction of petroleum to assess their potential. Figure 20A depicts, on the left<br>
hand side Y axis, the percent conversion of 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene to 1,3-diisopropyl<br>
benzene versus time for H-MOR[ZNR] and H-MOR. The ratio of benzene produced by<br>
HMOR/ benzene produced by H-MOR[ZNR] as a function of time is also shown on the<br>
secondary Y axis located on the right hand side of Figure 20A and an arrow is present on the<br>
line that connects this data. A helium flow of 50 mL/min saturated with<br>
l,3,5triisopropylbenzene at 120°C was introduced over 50 mg of each catalyst, H-<br>
MORfZNR] and H-MOR, at 200°C.<br>
In the cracking of 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene, the conventional H-MOR zeolite<br>
showed a low activity (7% conversion to 1,3-diisopropyl benzene after 400 min) due to its<br>
medium-sized (0.65 x 0.70 ran), 1-D pores. In contrast, H-MOR[ZNR] achieved a much<br>
higher catalytic activity under similar conditions (~ 52% conversion to 1,3-diisopropyl<br>
benzene) (see Figure 20A). This significant increase in catalytic activity was attributed to<br>
ZNRs' higher surface areas, readily accessible active sites, and improved intracrystalline<br>
diffusivity.<br>
Besides increased activity, ZNRs also showed improved selectivity due to their<br>
nanostructured rod-shape morphology. For example, H-MOR[ZNR] produced 3 times less<br>
benzene per mole of 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene converted as compared to the commercial<br>
zeolite H-MOR (see the secondary Y axis on the right hand side of Figure 20A). Benzene<br>
may include, for example, benzene derivatives such as, for example, toluene, xylene, and<br>
other related derivative compounds. This significant increase in selectivity also helped to<br>
reduce coke formation, which has been a major problem with conventional cracking<br>
catalysts, especially those containing I-D pores, such as mordenite.<br>
The simple, inexpensive and generalized synthesis strategy described here allows for<br>
the preparation of ZNR, a crystalline material with walls that are only several nanometers<br>
thick (3-20 nm), in which nanorings and junctions are common. The novel synthesis strategy<br>
was based on the "programmed" zeolitic transformation of mesoporous materials, which<br>
avoided the typical drawbacks of nanoscaled zeolite synthesis (e.g., low yield, difficulty in<br>
separation, and high pressure drops), and did not require the use of a layered precursor. The<br>
unique crystalline structure of ZNRs provided for improved catalytic conversion of bulky<br>
molecules by increasing the accessibility to its microporosity, while reducing interparticle<br>
and intraparticle diffusion barriers.<br>
Referring now to Figures 20B and 20C, mesostructured zeolites were tested for crude<br>
oil refining via Microactivity Test (ASTM D-3907). This is a well known and widely<br>
accepted technique to estimate the performance of FCC (Fluid Catalytic Cracking) catalysts.<br>
Vacuum gas-oil was used as feed in a fluid-bed stainless steel reactor. The experiments were<br>
conducted under identical conditions with mesostructured zeolites and their conventional<br>
zeolites counterparts.<br>
Figure 20B depicts microactivity test (MAT) results of a conventional fully<br>
crystalline zeolite H-Y (Si/AI=15) and its fully crystalline mesostructured version H-<br>
Y[MCM-41]. Microactivity test conditions included the reaction temperature of 500°C, the<br>
catalyst contact time was 60 seconds, the catalyst charge was 1 grams, the catalyst/vacuum<br>
gas oil ration was 2, the WHSV was 30 g/h/g. The conversion, specifically, how much of the<br>
vacuum gas oil feed was converted into product, with all yield normalized to 100% for<br>
comparison purposes, was for the unmodified fully crystalline zeolite H-Y: 61.22% and for<br>
the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite, H-Y[MCM-41]: 67.20%. Although not depicted<br>
in Figure 20B, the results of this test provide an LPG fraction of H-Y of 17.45 % and LPG<br>
fraction of H-Y[MCM-41] of 15.27 %.<br>
Figure 20C depicts the composition of the LPG fraction obtained by Microactivity<br>
test (MAT) of a conventional fully crystalline zeolite H-Y (Si/AI=15) and its fully crystalline<br>
mesostructured version H-Y[MCM-41], described above in conjunction with Figure 20B.<br>
The composition of the LPG fraction was analyzed to determine the components of the LPG<br>
fraction. Where the fully crystalline zeolite H-Y was used the LPG fraction was 17.45 %.<br>
Where the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite H-Y[MCM-41] was used the LPG fraction<br>
was 15.27 %. In addition, the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites produced more olefins,<br>
which are desired products. Referring now to the X-axis on Figure 20C the label C3 indicates<br>
propane, the label C3= indicates propene, the label i-C4 indicates isobutane, the label n-C4<br>
indicates normal butane, the label i-C4= indicates isobutene, and the label n-C4= indicates<br>
normal butene. Specifically, the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite produced increased<br>
propene, isobutene, and normal butene in the LPG fraction then the unmodified fully<br>
crystalline zeolite. Further, the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite produced a lesser<br>
fraction of LPG than with its counter part conventional unmodified fully crystalline zeolite.<br>
The internal wall thickness of the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite is less than the<br>
internal wall thickness of the unmodified fully crystalline zeolite. Thus the thinner internal<br>
walls in the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites reduce hydrogen transfer reactions,<br>
which are responsible for the undesired conversion of olefins to paraffins. Accordingly, an<br>
increased number of desired olefins are produced where fully crystalline mesostructured<br>
zeolites are used instead of conventional unmodified fully crystalline zeolites.<br>
In the MET, generally, the samples were displayed in a fluidized-bed stainless steel<br>
reactor. Reaction temperature was 500°C, the amount of catalyst was 3.0 g, the catalyst/oil<br>
ratio was 2.0, the WHSV was 30 g/h/g, and the contact time was 60 seconds. These tests<br>
showed that using H-Y[MCM-41] in place of conventional H-Y resulted in a 43% increase in<br>
gasoline production, a 75% increase in propylene and a 110% increase in butenes.<br>
Additionally, there is a 32% decrease in coke formation, a 23% decrease in Total Dry Gas,<br>
and a 12% decrease in LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gases). The presence of mesopores in the<br>
H-Y[MCM-41], which has at least double the surface area of H-Y, favours the cracking of<br>
the larger molecules present in the crude oil, which cannot be transformed within the<br>
micropores of conventional zeolites. Typically, conventional zeolites have pores measuring<br>
about 0.7 nm, which are too small to efficiently process desirable products, for example,<br>
alkyl benzene, contained in heavy crude oil fractions. Larger pore sizes are required to<br>
facilitate improved surface area contact (including within the pore walls or mesopore<br>
surfaces) with the hydrocarbon materials. For comparison, the diameter of each of the<br>
mesopores, which are surrounded by the mesopore surfaces of the fully crystalline<br>
mesostructure of the invention, can measure, e.g., about 2 nm. The increased production of<br>
light olefins was related to the reduction of hydrogen transfer reaction due to the presence of<br>
favorable interior or pore wall thickness in the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites (~2<br>
nm) as opposed to the thick crystals of conventional zeolites (-1000 nm). This interior or<br>
pore wall thickness also results in reduction of overcracking, significantly reduces coke<br>
formation, and reduces production of Total Dry Gas and LPG.<br>
Pyrolysis of plastics has gained renewed attention due to the possibility of converting<br>
these abundant waste products into valuable chemicals while also producing energy.<br>
Williams, P. T. Waste Treatment and Disposal; John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK, 1998.<br>
Acidic catalysts, such as zeolites, have been shown to be able to reduce significantly the<br>
decomposition temperature of plastics and to control the range of products generated.<br>
Williams, P. T. Waste Treatment and Disposal. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK, 1998;<br>
Park, D. W., et al, Polym. Degrad Stability 1999,65, 193-198; Bagri, R., et al., J. Anal.<br>
Pyrolysis, 2002, 63, 29-41. However, the accessibility of the bulky molecules produced<br>
during plastic degradation has been severely limited by the micropores of zeolites.<br>
The catalytic degradation of polyethylene (PE) by commercially available zeolites<br>
and their corresponding mesostructured zeolites was studied by thermal gravimetric analysis<br>
(TGA). Figure 21 depicts the percentage of polyethylene (PE) weight lost vs. temperature for<br>
the following mixtures of catalysts in weight ratio to PE. The curves labeled (A)-(G) depicts<br>
results of the following degradation curves: (A): no catalyst, (B): H-ZSM-5:PE 1:2, (C): H-<br>
ZSM-5[MCM-41]:PE 1:2, (D): H-ZSM-5:PE 1:1, (E) H-ZSM-5:PE 2:1, (F): H-ZSM-<br>
5[MCM-41]:PE 1:1, and (G) H-ZSM-5[MCM-41]:PE 2:1. In all cases, fully crystalline<br>
mesostructured zeolites allow for reduced decomposition temperatures compared to the<br>
unmodified commercial zeolites (by ~ 35°C in the case of (C) H-ZSM-5[MCM-41] vs. (B)<br>
H-ZSM-5), even at high catalyst:PE ratios (see Figure 21). In fact, referring to the curve<br>
labelled (F), with a H-ZSM-5[MCM-41]:PE weight ratio of 1:1, a lower decomposition<br>
temperature was achieved compared to that required by, referring to curve labeled (E), a<br>
ZSM-5:PE weight ratio of2:1.<br>
The large accessible surface area and ion-exchange properties of fully crystalline<br>
mesostructured zeolites will also facilitate the surface functionalization, the immobilization<br>
of homogeneous catalysts, and the deposition of metal clusters. Thus, fully crystalline<br>
mesostructured zeolites also serve as a very useful catalyst support for a variety of reactions.<br>
With their improved accessibility and diffusivity compared to conventional zeolites,<br>
fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites may also be employed in place of unmodified<br>
conventional zeolites in other applications, such as gas and liquid-phase adsorption,<br>
separation, catalysis, catalytic cracking, catalytic hydrocracking, catalytic isomerization,<br>
catalytic hydrogenation, catalytic hydroformilation, catalytic alkylation, catalytic acylation,<br>
ion-exchange, water treatment, pollution remediation, etc. Many ofthese applications suffer<br>
currently from limitations associated with the small pores of zeolites, especially when bulky<br>
molecules are involved, van Bekkum, H., Flanigen, E. M., Jacobs, P. A., Jansen, J. C.<br>
(editors), Introduction to Zeolite Science and Practice, 2nd edition. Studies in Surface<br>
Science and Catalysis, Vol. 137, 2001; Corma, A., Chem. Rev., 1997, 97, 2373-2419; Davis,<br>
M. E., Nature, 2002, 417, 813-821. Mesostructured zeolites present attractive benefits over<br>
zeolites in such applications.<br>
Organic dye and pollutant removal from water is of major environmental importance,<br>
and represents the third major use of zeolites (accounting for 80 tons of zeolites per year).<br>
Galo, J. de A. A., et al., Chem. Rev. 2002, 102, 4093-4138. However, most of the organic<br>
dyes are bulky, which make their removal slow or incomplete, requiring a huge excess of<br>
zeolites in the process. Fully crystalline mesostructured zeolites offer significant advantage<br>
over unmodified conventional zeolites in organic dye and pollutant removal with their larger<br>
surface area and pore size.<br>

Exemplification<br>
The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by<br>
reference to the following examples, which are included merely for purposes of illustration of<br>
certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the<br>
invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Synthesis of H-YrMCM-41] - 0.79 g of zeolite H-Y (Zeolyst CBV-720 Si/Al=15) were<br>
stirred in 50 mL of a 0.37 M NH4OH solution containing 0.55 g of CTAB, for 20 minutes,<br>
after which time the synthesis mixture was hydrothermally treated at 150°C for 10 hours. The<br>
solid was filtered, washed, and finally ramped in nitrogen at 5°C/min until 550°C, and then<br>
switched to air for 4 hours. Similar conditions were used to calcine all of the samples.<br>
Alternatively, 1 g of H-Y (Zeolyst CBV-720 Si/Al=15) was stirred for in 30 mL of a 0.09 M<br>
tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMA-OH) solution. Then 0.5 g of<br>
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was added. After 30 minutes of stirring the<br>
suspension was hydrothermally treated for 20 hours at 150°C. Structural parameters are<br>
presented in Table 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
Synthesis of H-MOR.[MCM-41] - 2.0 g of zeolite H-MOR (calcined Zeolyst CBV21A<br>
Si/Al=10) was stirred in 50 mL of 0.27 M TMA-OH solution. Afterwards, 1.0 g of CTAB<br>
was added. After other 30 minutes of stirring the synthesis solution was hydrothermally<br>
treated at 150°C for 20 hours. Structural parameters are presented in Table 1.<br>
Example 3<br>
Synthesis of H-ZSM-5[MCM-41] - 1.0 g ofNRt-ZSM-5 (Zeolyst CBV3024E Si/AI=15) was<br>
stirred in 50 mL of 0.8 M HF solution for 4 hours. This suspension was added to a solution<br>
containing 0.69 g of CTAB, and stirred for 30 minutes. The resulting synthesis mixture was<br>
basified by slowly adding 2.5 g of a 30% NH4OH solution. Finally, it was hydrothermally<br>
treated at 150°C for 20 hours. Stlllctural parameters are presented in Table 1. The wall<br>
thickness was determined by the standard method within the art by substracting the distance<br>
between two pore centers (a0, obtained via X-ray diffraction) and the pore size (determined<br>
by N2 adsorption).<br>
Table 1. Structural parameters for the mesostructured zeolites.<br><br>
Catalytic cracking of Cumene and 1.3.5-triisopropylbenzene - Catalytic tests were carried out<br>
in a lab-scale packed-bed catalytic reactor connected to a gas chromatograph (Hewlett<br>
Packard HP6890 Series) with a DB petrol (50 m x 0.2 mm x 0.5 microns) column. In all<br>
cases, 50 mL/min of He were flowed through 50 mg of catalyst. For cumene cracking the gas<br>
flow was saturated with cumene at room temperature and the reaction temperature was<br>
300°C. For 1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene cracking the gas flow was saturated at 120°C and the<br>
reaction temperatures were 300°C.<br>
Example 5<br>
Polyethylene (PE) degradation - An initial mass of~10 mg of catalyst:PE samples with ratios<br>
1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 were ramped in a thermogravimetric analyzer (Perkin Elmer TGA7) at 10°C/<br>
min in a 250 mL/min flow of He until 600°C. Results are depicted in Figure 21.<br>
Example 6<br>
Chemical species and homogeneous anchoring on mesostructured zeolites - The acid form of<br>
the fully crystalline mesostructured zeolite with faujasite structure and MCM-41 architecture,<br>
H-Y[MCM-41], (Si/Al~15), was ion exchanged in a 0.1 NFLOH solution for 24 h in order to<br>
produce Nt4-Y[MCM-41]. The resulting material was ion-exchanged again in a 7.0 mM<br>
NH2(CH2)2NMe3Cl solution for 24 h. After filtering and washing thoroughly, the sample was<br>
dried at 60°C overnight. Finally, this amine functionalized mesostructured zeolite was added<br>
to a 2.0 mM Rh(PPh3)3 solution (Wilkinson catalyst) for 24 h. After filtering and washing<br>
thoroughly, the sample was dried at 60°C overnight. All the products, as well as the<br>
quartenary amine and the Wilkinson catalyst, were analyzed by FTIR to confirm the presence<br>
of the different species on the mesostructured zeolite even after thorough washing (see<br>
Figure 22). Figure 22 depicts the FTIR spectra of a) H-Y[MCM-41], b) NH4-Y[MCM-41], c)<br>
NH2(CH2)2NMe3Cl, d) NH2(CH2)2NMe3-Y[MCM-41], d) Rh(PPh3)3Cl, and e)<br>
Rh(PPh3)3NH2(CH2)2NMe3-Y[MCM-41].<br>
Example 7<br>
Synthesis of Zeolitic NanoRods (ZNRs) - In a synthesis of nanostructured zeolites, 0.36 g of<br>
NaOH are dissolved in 30 ml of water to produce a basic solution with a pH measuring 13.5.<br>
Thereafter 1 g of H-Y (Zeolyst CBV 720) with an original Si/Al ratio of~15 is added to the<br>
basic solution. After a 12 hours of stirring at room temperature, the zeolite and base mixture<br>
had a pH measuring 11.5. Thereafter, 0.5 g ofCTAB (cetyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide)<br>
was added to the zeolite and base mixture to produce a cloudy suspension. The cloudy<br>
suspension was transferred into teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves and treated<br>
hydrothermally at 150°C under autogeneous pressure. The samples were collected at<br>
different times, washed, dried and analyzed by X-ray Difraction, IR Spectroscopy, TEM, N2<br>
adsorption at 17K, TGA and Elemental Analysis. In a similar synthesis procedure H-ZSM-<br>
5[ZNR] was produced using H-Y (Zeolyst Si/Al ~ 80).<br>
