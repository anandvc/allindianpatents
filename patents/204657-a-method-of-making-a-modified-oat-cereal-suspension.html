"A METHOD OF MAKING A MODIFIED OAT CEREAL SUSPENSION"<br>
CEREAL BASE CEBA AB, of Von Troils vag 1, S-205 03 Malmo, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br>
Field of the Invention The present invention relates to enzyme suspensions comprising enzyme preparations for<br>
enzymaric hydrolysis of cereal srarcin  In another aspect it relates to methods of producing<br>
homogeneous and stable cereal suspensions prepared by using the enzyme preparations.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The beneficial health, effects of dietary fibers are well-known. In this context there has been<br>
a. growing inrerestin food products made from grains, such as oats and barley.<br>
In many respects, oats are different than, other grains. They have higher protein and fat<br>
content than comparable cereals as -well as a high Î²-glucan content.<br>
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in food products made from oars.<br>
The main reason for this is that, oat fibers have been round to have a. wholesome effect by.<br>
lowering the serum cholesterol level of hypercho esterernic individuals. Anotherreason is that<br>
oats contain protein of high food value as well as a considerable proportion of mono and<br>
polyunsaturated fats. In. addition, oats contain many essential amino acids and minerals.<br>
A great advantage of oats is that the whoie grain can be used for making various<br>
products once the hull has been removed,   Inoats, the most nutritious substances are<br>
distributed fairly evenly in the whole grain.. In other grains, the nutritious substances are<br>
frequency concentrated in specific parts: of the grain.<br><br>
The nutritional aspects of oat components have prompted the introduction of oats or parts thereof into several different food products. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 4,996,063 (G.F. Ingiett) discloses the preparation of water-soluble dietary fibre compositions by treating ground oat products with a-amylases. The a-amylase serves to thin the oat starch, and any a-amylase may thus be used. The produced pulverulent dietary fibre compositions are used as additives in food products, such as fat substitutes. However, these products not only lack desirable aromatics of natural oats, but are also deprived of agreeable natural oat flavorings.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,686,123 (to L. Lindahl et al) discloses a homogeneous and stable cereal suspension having the taste and aroma of natural oats. The disclosed cereal suspension is prepared by treating a suspension of oatmeal with p-amylase, which has no giucanase and proteinase activity, in a. first enzyme treatment step which specifically generates maltose and maltodextrin units. Then the suspension is treated with a-amylase, which also has no giucanase and proteinase, activity, in a second enzyme treatment step which specifically generates maltose units. This oat suspension is a milky product which can be used as an alternative to milk, especially for lactose-intolerant people. It may also be used as the basis of or an additive in the manufacture of ice-cream, gruel, yogurt, milkshakes, health drinks and snacks. However, this process is time consuming because of the sequential treatments with different hydrolases, thereby increasing the cost of production. Moreover, sequential enzyme treatments eliminate any possible positive synergic effects that may occur when combining of enzymes. Furthermore, the overall viscosity and/or sugar content of the cereal suspension cannot be efficiently controlled or manipulated.<br><br><br>
In view of these shortcomings, there is a need for enzyme preparations that hydrolyze cereal starch in a more cost-efficient and timeiy manner while producing a cereal suspension product that retains the flavoring and aromatic qualities of natural cereal and. in which the viscosity, sugar content, and overall texture can be regulated or modified for a preferred end product:.<br>

According to the invention, there is provided an enzyme preparation for enzymatic hydrolysis  of constituents  in a. cereal substrate suspension, comprising at least one<br><br><br>
hydrolase enzyme having the abiiiry to hydrolyze a-glycosidic bonds. The hydrolases may be selected from the group consisting of p-amylase, a-amylase, amylogiucosidase puUuJanase and mixtures thereof. Preferably, when the enzyme preparation comprises P-amylase ora-amylase there is a mixture of ar least one other of the named a-glycosidic hydrolases, and more preferably, when there are two or more enzymes combined in the enzyme preparation, the enzymes are introduced simultaneously to the cereal substrate suspension. In addition to the above-identified hydrolases, the enzyme preparation may further comprise aa isomerase, such as elucose isomerase.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the enzyme preparations may comprise pulluanase solely; amyloglucosidase solely; or several different combinations of hydrolases including: a mixture combining p-amylase with pullulanase; amixture combining P-amylase, pullulanase and amylogiucosidase; a mixture combining p-amylase and a-amylase; and a mixture combining a-amylase, p-amylase and amylogiucosidase. Any of the above enzyme preparations comprising a hydrolase alone or in combination with another may further comprise an isomerase, such, as glucose isomerase.<br>
The enzyme preparations of the present invention convert cereal starch, which comprises both amyiose and amylopectin, to large molecular weight maltodextrins and low-molecular-weight compounds of various degrees of modification, such as maltotriose, maltose and glucose. For instance, Î²-amylase hydrolyzes a-l-4-glycosidic bonds sequentially from the non-reducing terminal end of amyiose and amylopectin with, a cleaved product of maltose; a-amylase hydrolyzes imemal Î±-1-4 glycoside bonds on both amyiose and amylopectin with<br><br>
a cleaved maltodextrin; and amyloglucosidase hydroiyzes a-1-4 and 1-6 glycosidic bonds on the non-reducing end of the starch releasing giucose molecules. Therefore, a combination of hydrolases having the ability to hydrolyze a-glycosidic bonds will provide various rados of maitodextrin/sugar in an enzyme treated cereal suspension.<br>
The choice of enzymes and die reaction time determine me degree of degradation and product spectra. Different species of di-and mono-saccharides are produced by using different enzyme preparations which include me combination of at least, one a-glycosidic hydrolase and/or an isomerase. The end products could include raedi-saccharide, maltose, and the mono-saccharides, fructose and giucose. For example, the debranching enzyme pullulanase together with (3-amylase will accumulate large amounts of maitose. Amyloglucosidase. and glucose isomerase may result, in the. production of fructose and glucose. When combining (3-amylase and a-amyiase, the a-amylase promotes the action of the 3-amylase thereby obtaining maltose and maitodextrin. units while using a smaller amount of enzymes men if enzymes are used, separately. A cereal starch may be convened entirely to low-molecular-weight compounds, such as glucose by combining, for example, (3-amylase, a-amylase and amyloglucosidase. Glucose isomerase, solely, will result in the production of fructose when added to a cereal substrate diat already contains glucose. In me alternative, the enzyme preparation wherein (3-amyiase, a-amylase and amyloglucosidase are combined with glucose isomerase may also produce a product with high, levels of fructose.<br>
The enzyme preparations, that being a single enzyme or a mixture of enzymes may treat a cereal substrate suspension of me present invention by introducing free enzymes<br><br><br>
directly into a cereal substrate suspension, or in the alternative introducing the cereal substrate suspension to a. vessel containing immobilized enzymes.<br>
Free enzymes as used herein means enzymes which are free to move in the suspension and are not restricred by containment or affixed to a substrate. Usually, free enzymes or cells are not re-used because they are too small to filter and recovery may become cost prohibitive. Hence, elimination of the biocataiytic activity of free enzymes in the presenr invention is usually accomplished by denaturing of the enzyme.<br>
Immobilized enzymes as used herein means free enzymes that are physically confined by different methods including, but not limited to, semi-permeable membranes, hollow bore fibers, or ultrafiltration membranes. Immobilized enzymes, whether soluble or insoluble, allow for the simultaneous immobilization of many enzymes, selectively controlling substrates and products through membrane selectivity. As used in the- present invention immobilized enzymes provide for ease of loading and treating the cereal meal suspension in a continuous mode reactor.<br>
The benefits of immobilized enzymes include complete recovery of the enzymes from the reaction mixture whether used in a batch or continuous mode operation Thus, the enzymes can be used repeatedly without any contamination of the final product and without the need to heat the product so as to denature the enzyme. Also, larger concentrations of immobilized enzyme can be utilized because the immobilized enzymes can be recovered, and re-used, resulting in a shortening of reaction time and/orthe size of the vessel needed to carry out the reaction. Another advantage is the virtual absence of enzyme in the final product so<br><br><br>
that the enzyme only has to be approved as a food processing aid and not as a food additive even when heating and subsequent enzyme inactivation is not included in the process.<br>
It is further contemplated by the inventors that the enzymes used to prepare the enzyme modified suspensions and/or, the homogeneous and stable improved cereal suspension may include enzymes derived from whole ceils, organelles, or even microorganisms used as biological catalysts in a fermentation process.<br>
In die present invention the overall conditions including, temperature, pH and the addition of other substrates, such as enzyme cefaclors or buffering agents will determine the enzyme activity, and. therefore, the yield and quality of the end product It is known that enzymes may be extracted from different sources but can catalyze the same reaction. For instance, a-amylase from the fungal organism Aspergillus oryzae has a optimum pH of 4-. 7 and an optimum temperature of 50o c, while a-amylase from the bacterium Bacillus lichenformis has a pH optimum of 7.5 and an optimum temperature of 90Â°C. Thus understood, the optimum conditions, including the amount of enzyme, the temperature of the slurry, the agitation time, and the pH value are optimized to obtain a final product of suitable viscosity. Techniques used for determining optimal parameters are well known and widely used in the art<br>
The enzyme preparations of the present invention may be used to provide a homogeneous and stable improved cereal suspension having the aroma and taste of natural cereals and containing intact P-glucans. The enzyme preparations are used to treat a cereal substrate which may include a. cereal meal suspension, a preprocessed cereal suspension or<br><br><br>
a mixture thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the cereal substrate suspension is a. cereal meal suspension. The cereal meal suspension is prepared by dry- or wet-grinding rolled cereals, or otherwise, hear- and water-treated cereals to-meal and suspending the cereal meal in water to form a cereal meal suspension. Optionally, the suspension may be centrifuged or decanted in order to remove coarse fibre particles before being treated with the enzyme preparation.<br>
Conveniently, the cereal meal suspension is prepared on the basis of commercially produced, pregelatmized rolled oats retaining the original, taste and aroma of the oats. The rolled oats are ground to oatmeal by total, dry or wet grinding. In dry grinding, the oatmeal is suspended in water, preferably at a temperamre of 50Â°-65Â°C. Also in wet grinding, water is used preferably at a temperature of 50Â°-65Â°C Especially good results are obtained if the water has been deionized.<br>
For a majority of starch contained within the cereal meal the heating of the suspension to a temperature between 50Â° to 65Â°C gelatinizes the cereal starch for easier hydrolyzation. However, some oats comain resistant starches that are not gelatinized, at these temperatures, and therefore, are not easily hydrolyzed by the enzyme preparations of the present invention. In this instance, it has been found, to be beneficial to initially hydrolyze the non-resistant starch in a first enzyme treating step with the enzyme preparations of the present invention and then subjecting the suspension to higher temperatures, preferably above 100Â°C to gelatinize the resistant starch. The suspension is subsequently cooled to a workable temperature and standard conditions.  The suspension is the retreated with the enzyme<br><br><br>
preparations of the present invendon. Accordingly, the non-resistant starch in the cereal meal suspension may be hydroiyzed with the enzyme preparations of the present invendon and then the suspension is heat treated to a higher temperature to solubilize the resistant starch. The suspension is cooled to a. temperature mat is suitable for enzymatic activity and men retreated with an enzyme preparation of the present invennon. This method will allowed for more complete aydrolyzatioa of substantially all the cereal starch including the resistant starch in. the cereal meal suspension.<br>
Suitably, the slurry or suspension has a weight ratio of meal to water in the range of about 1;6 to about 1:9, which corresponds to a dry solids content of about 10 to about 15 % w/v. The suspension is agitated until the meal has been dispersed. The slurry should have a pH of at least 5 to about 8. This pH range has been found, to be effective, when, adding the. enzyme preparations of the present, invention. Within this pH range the enzyme preparations have acceptable catalytic activity and can avoid the use of additives to alter the pH.<br>
In order to remove the coarse particles, the suspension can then be centrifuged or decanted at350-450 G for about 10-15 minutes.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, a preprocessed cereal suspension may be used. The preprocessed cereal suspension is defined as that which, is first prepared according to the methods disclosed, in US Patent No. 5,686,123. The cereal meal suspension is treated with Î²-amylase in a first enzyme treatment step which specifically generates maltose units and has no giucanase and proteinase activity, to a viscosity of 3 -0.1 Pas at the shear rate of 10-100 s'1. Then the suspension is treated with a-amyiase in a second enzyme, treatment<br><br><br>
step which specifically generates maltose units and has no giucanase and proteinase activity, to a viscosity of 
The cereai substrate suspension is treated with the enzyme preparations under carefully regulated operating temperatures. The temperature is chosen to favor the enzymatic performance allowing both fast hydrolytic rates and good, enzyme stability. A temperature from about 40Â°C to a temperature below that which would denature the enzyme or combination of. enzymes is generally employed, preferably from about 50Â° to about 90Â°C depending on the enzyme. At lower temperatures the enzyme activity may be low and at higher temperatures the enzyme stability may be low. Accordingly, the temperature of the catalytic reaction is chosen to optimize production of the end products while maintaining the stability of the enzyme preparation. The present invention is also applicable to thermostable starch degrading enzymes, in which case the operation conditions can be adapted to the characteristics of such enzymes.<br>
A hydrolase and/or combination of several hydrolases are introduced to a cereal substrate suspension in a sufficient amount to hydrolyze a-glycosidic bonds of constituents in the cereal substrate suspension to provide an end product with the desired viscosity. The combination of enzymes and amount of each specific enzyme results in suspensions that contain different sugars, but also in different amounts. High content of low molecular sugars, such as maltose and glucose will yield, an end product suspension with less viscosity. In<br><br><br>
contrast, a. higher content of maitodexmin, which is considered a higher molecular weight molecule yields a produa with greater viscosity that may be used in soups or yogurts because of thicker consistency. Accordingly, varying the kind and/or the amount of enzymes in the mixture will yield specially designed .products. Using a specific combination of enzymes helps to standardize the process so that the end produr is related to the enzyme combination whereby reaction tune and other process parameters do not greatly affect the end product. In carrying out the present invention, it is generally advantageous to employ between about 1 to about 100 ml of enzyme preparation per kilogram of oats or other grain material which make up the. cereal substrate suspension. The suspension may be treated with the enzyme preparation to produce a final produa which has the viscosity of about water or about 10 mPas to about, several hundreds of mPas at a sheer rate of about 500 to about 1000s'1.<br>
Generally, the grain that is incorporated into the cereal meal suspension may be any starting grain material including but not limited to oats, barley, rice, wheat, maize, rye, sorghum, triticale and pearl millet. Preferably, the grain is oats. As stated above, oats have properties that make them especially desirable from a consumer point of view because of the large amounts of high motecular weight Î²-giucans which are natural hydrocolloids. In. suspensions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis with the enzyme preparations of the present invention, the p-gtucans found in oats function as indigenous stabilizers. Therefore, the cereal suspensions of the present invention may be used in food for thickening, gelling or emulsion stabilizing effects.<br><br>
The sweetness of an enzyme modified suspension or a. homogeneous and stable improved cereal suspension can be regulated and/or manipulated using appropriate enzyme preparations. In fact, the enzyme preparations of the present invention may be introduced in several steps to tailor-make me end product. For instance, an enzyme preparation comprising a- and p- amylase may produce a high level of maltose. With a second treatment of an enzyme preparation comprising amylogiucosidase and/or glucose isomerase the maltose can be convened to giucose and fructose. The production of glucose, and, particularly, of fructose will result: in a sweeter suspension than one containing mainly maltose. A. suspension comprising fructose has the significant advantage that it can be consumed by diabetics without adverse affects.<br>
The specific type of sugar affects not only the properties of the suspension but also the organoleptic properties of products produced by using the suspensions. By altering the. sugar profile, it is possible to tailor-make suspensions that yield end products having functional properties, such as viscosity; nutritional properties and sugar ratio content to meet the needs of the final user.<br>
Enzymatic activity may be discontinued or terminated in the enzyme modified cereal suspension orthe enzyme treated cereal suspension by any method well known in the art, including denaturation, centrifuge, chromatography for free enzymes and/or removal of the suspension from contact with immobilized enzymes. Preferably, The enzyme reaction is terminated by heating the cereal suspension to at least 80Â°C, and preferably, between about 80" to 90Â°C.<br><br>
As an alternative the. enzyme activity may be discontinued terminated during the final process steps that improve the shelf-life of the product.

The invention will now be described in more detail by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Pregelatinized rolled oats were wet-milled at. a temperature of about 52Â° to about 63Â°C, The concentration of the. suspension was about 10 to about 15% w/v. An enzyme preparation according to the invention which comprised barley -amylase (Genencor Intl., Rochester, NY, USA; or Rhodk Ltd, Cheshire, UK) and puilulanase, a debranching enzyme, e.g. Promozyme. (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), was added to the cereal meal<br><br>
suspension at a concentration of approximately 2 mi per kg of oats and at a temperature of about 58Â° to about 61Â°C. The concentration of the enzymes in the enzyme preparation was about 500 to about 1000 DP0 and about 150 to about 300 PU (puiluianase units) per ml, respecaveiy. The enzyme preparation was ailowed to act for 1-2 hours, or until the viscosity of the suspension dropped to about 20 to about 40 mPas at a shear rate of around 700 s*1. The product contained large amounts of maltose. The majority of starch (approximately 60% of the oats) was converted to maitose.<br>
The suspension was.thea heated to about 85Â° to about90Â°C to inactivate the enzymes. The product was decanted to remove the excess of non-soluble fibre, and homogenized. Optionally the product could be UHT treated and aseptically packed, pasteurized and kept refrigerated until used, or it is evaporated and subsequently spray dried, to yield a stable powder<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Pregeiatinized roiled oats were, milled.as in Example 1. An enzyme preparation according to the invention which comprised bariey Î²-amyiase (Genencor Intl., Rochester, NY, USA; or Rhodia Ltd, Cheshire, UK), puiluianase, a debranching enzyme, e.g. Promozyme (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and amyloglucosidase, e.g., AMG (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) or Optidex (Genencor Intl., Rochester, NY, USA) was added to the oat meal suspension at a. concentration of about 3 to about 4- mi per kg oats and at a temperature of about 58Â° to about 61Â°C. The concentration of these enzymes in the enzyme preparation was about 400 to about 700 DP0, about 100 to about 200 PU (puiluianase units)<br><br><br>
and about 90 to about 110 AGU per ml, respectively. The enzyme preparation was allowed to act for about 1 to about 2 hours, or until the viscosity of the suspension dropped to about 20 to about 40 mPas at a shear rate of 700 s'1. The product contained large amounts of giucose. Finally, the suspension was heated and treated as in Example 1.<br>
EXAMPLES Pregelatinized rolled oats were milled as in Example 1. An enzyme preparation according to the invention which comprised a mixture of (3-amylase (Genencor Intl., Rochester, NY, USA; or Rhodia Ltd, Cheshire, UK) and endo-acting a-amylase, e.g. Fungamyl (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) or Mycoiase (Genencor Intl., Rochester, NY, USA), was added to the cereal meal suspension at a concentration of approximately 2 mi per kg of oats and at a. temperature of about 54Â° to about57Â°C. The concentration of these enzymes in the enzyme preparation was about 1400 to about. 1600 DPÂ° and about 30 to about 70 ALT (amylase units) per ml, respectively. The enzyme preparation was allowed to act for about 1 hour, or until the viscosity of the suspension dropped to about 20 to about 40 mPas at a shear rate of about 700 s "l. Most of the oat starch (60-70%) was converted to maltose and. the rest was present as maitodextrins (step 1) Then (in step 2), another exo-acting enzyme was added, e.g: amylogiucosidase AMG (Novo Nordislc, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) or Optidex (Genencor IntL, Rochester, NY, USA), at a. dosage of approximately 600 AGU (amylogiucosidase units) per kg of oats. The reaction was terminated, when die desired, amount of glucose had been produced. For example, 30 minutes after the addition, of amylogiucosidase (giucoamylase), the suspension contained equal amounts .of maltose and<br><br><br>
glucose while the maltose content was 50% of the suspension in step 1. The maltose content was high in step 1, and amyioglucosidase rapidly hydrolyzed this substrate. As the maltose content decreased, maitodextrin became the preferred   substrate   and aiso became increasingly hydrolyzed. At full conversion all the starch was converted, to glucose. Finally, the suspension was heated and treated as in Example 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 Pregelatinized rolled, oats were milled as in Example 1. An enzyme preparation according to the invention which comprised a mixture of barley Î²-amylase (Genencor Inti., Rochester, NY, USA; or Rhodia Ltd, Cheshire, UK), cc-amylase, e.g. Fungamyl (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) or Mycoiase (Genencor Intl., Rochester, NY, USA) and amyioglucosidase, e.g., AMG (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) or Optidex (Genencor IhtL, Rochester, NY, USA) was added to the suspension at a dosage of about 3 to about 4 ml per kg oats and at a temperature of about 54Â° to about 57Â°C. The concentration of these enzymes in the enzyme preparation was about 700 to about 900 DP0, about 1 to about 35 AU (a-amylase units) and about 200 to about 350 AGU per ml, respectively. The. enzyme preparation, was allowed to actfor about 1-2 hours, or until the viscosity of the suspension dropped, to about 20 to about 40 mPas at a shear rate of about 700 s"1. Finally, the suspension was heated and treated as in Example 1.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
A suspension of oats was prepared as in U.S. Patent No. 5,686,123 is treated with an enzyme preparation according to the invention and which comprised barley j3-amylase (Genencor IhtL, Rochester, NY, USA; or Rhodia Ltd Cheshire, UK) and pullulanase, a debranching enzyme, e.g. Promozyme (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), at a concentration of approximately 2 ml per kg of oats. Altemaliveiy, the suspension was treated with, a debranching enzyme, such as pullulanase, e.g. Promozyme (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), at a concentration of approximately 800 PU per kg of oats. Otherwise the conditions were the same as in Example 1. The product was high in maltose and contained essentially no maltodextrins.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
A suspension of oats was prepared as in U.S. Patent No. 5,686,123 and was treated with the same enzyme preparation as in Example 2, orwith amyloglucosidase as in Example 3 (as in step 2). The product contained a. decreasing amount, of maltodextrins and an increasing amount of glucose as the hydrolytic reaction proceeded.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
To any of the products of Examples 2,3,4 and 6, i.e., which contained glucose, there was added an enzyme preparation according to the invention which comprised amyloglucosidase of about 50 to about 60 AGU per mi, e.g., AMG (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) or Optidex (Genencor IntL, Rochester, NY, USA) and glucose isomerase (about3000 GlUper ml), at a concentration of about 18 to about 70 ml per kg<br><br><br>
of oats, or only giucose isomerase, e.g. Spezyme GI (Genencor Intl., Rochester, NY, USA) or Sweetzyme (Nova Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), at a concentration of about 50,000-to about 200,000 GU (glucose isomerase units). Within two (2) hours, 25% of the giucose was converted to fructose.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 Pregelanmzed. rolled oats were milled as in Example 1. An enzyme preparation according to the invention which comprised a mixture of Î²-amylase (Genencor Intl., Rochester, NY, USA;, or Rhodia Ltd, Cheshire, UK), and endo-acting Î±-amylase, e.g. Fungamyl (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) or Mycoiase (Genencor Intl., Rochester, NY, USA) was added to the cereal meal suspension at a. concentration of approximately 2 ml per kg oats and at. a. temperature of about 54Â° to about 57Â°C. The concentration of these enzymes in the enzyme preparation was about 1400 to about: 1600 DP0 and. about 1 to about 8 AU (a-amyiase units) per mi, respectively. The enzyme preparation was allowed, to act for approximately 2 hours, or until the viscosity of the suspension dropped to about 45 to abour 65 mPas ar a shear rate of about 700 s'\ One third of the starch was converted to maltose while the rest was present as maltodextrin. The product was quite thick, because of the high content of maltodextrin. Finally the suspension was treated as in Example 1.<br><br><br>
