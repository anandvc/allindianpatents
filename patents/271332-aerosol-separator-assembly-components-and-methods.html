				<td>This application is being filed on 19 March 2008 as a PCT International<br>
Patent application in the name of Donaldson Company, Inc., a U.S. national corporation,<br>
applicant for the designation of all countries except the US, and Thomas John Lundgren,<br>
Bradley Allen Hemish, Daniel Eric Adamek, and Wade Mosset, all citizens of the U.S.,<br>
applicants for the designation of the US only, and claims priority to U.S. Provisional<br>
Patent Application Serial No. 60/919,254, filed March 20, 2007.<br>
Field of the Disclosure<br>
This disclosure relates to systems and methods for separating hydrophobic<br>
fluids (such as oils) which are entrained as aerosols, from gas streams (for example air<br>
streams). Further, the arrangements also provide for filtration of other contaminants, such<br>
as carbon material, from the gas streams. The arrangements are typically used to filter<br>
crankcase ventilation gases, from engine systems. Methods for conducting the separations<br>
are also provided.<br>
Background<br>
Certain gas streams, such as engine blow-by gases (i.e., crankcase<br>
ventilation gases, from the crankcases of the diesel engines) carry substantial amounts of<br>
entrained oils (liquid) therein, as aerosol. The majority of the oil (liquid) droplets within<br>
the aerosol are often within the size of 0.1-5.0 microns.<br>
In addition, such gas streams also carry substantial amounts of fine<br>
particulate contaminant, such as carbon contaminants. Such contaminants often have an<br>
average particle size within the range of about 0.5-3.0 microns.<br>
In some systems, it is desirable to vent such gases to the atmosphere. In<br>
general it is preferred that before the gases are vented to the atmosphere, they be cleaned<br>
of a substantial portion of aerosol and/or organic particulate contaminate therein.<br>
In other instances, it is desirable to direct the air or gas stream into<br>
equipment. When such is the case, it may be desirable to separate aerosolized liquids<br>
and/or particulates from the stream during circulation, in order to provide such benefits as:<br>
reduced negative effects in the downstream equipment; improved efficiencies; recapture of<br>
otherwise lost oil; and/or, to address environmental concerns.<br>
Improvements in crank cases ventilation filter systems (i.e., blow-by gas<br>
filtration systems) constructed for application with a variety of engine or equipment<br>
systems, are generally sought.<br>
Summary of the Disclosure<br>
Herein, assemblies, components, and techniques and features usable for<br>
crankcase ventilation systems are described and shown. There is no specific requirement<br>
that a system component or applied technique include all of the specific features described<br>
herein, to obtain some advantage or benefit according to the present disclosure.<br>
In general, a crankcase ventilation filter assembly is described, including<br>
the housing defining a gas flow inlet, gas flow outlet and a liquid drain arrangement; and,<br>
a serviceable filter cartridge removably positioned within an interior of the housing. The<br>
term "serviceable" in this context, when used herein to reference a filter cartridge, is meant<br>
to refer to a filter cartridge that can be removed from the housing, to be serviced or<br>
replaced in a housing. Herein the term "serviceable" in this context is meant to be<br>
synonymous with "removable" or "removable and replaceable".<br>
The housing generally includes: a housing base; and, an access cover<br>
which was removably mounted on the housing base to provide service access to an interior<br>
of the assembly. For an example described, the cover is threadably mounted on the<br>
housing base; and, the housing base includes the gas flow inlet, a gas flow outlet and<br>
liquid drain arrangement therein.<br>
Herein a cartridge-to-housing base (or housing base-to-cartridge) rotational<br>
alignment indexing arrangement is described, assuring that the cartridge can only be<br>
positioned in the base in the single, selected, rotational orientation. Also, a cartridge-to-<br>
access cover portion (or access cover portion-to-cartridge) rotational alignment indexing<br>
arrangement is described, ensuring that a portion of the housing access cover can only be<br>
oriented a single, selected, rotational orientation relative to the cartridge, in the assembly.<br>
Also described is a unique cartridge arrangement, including, among other<br>
things, an end piece with a flow aperture arrangement therethrough, and a non-circular<br>
projection addition around the flow aperture arrangement. An example of a circular<br>
projection having a "D" shape is described. A specific example is depicted, in which a<br>
straight side portion of the "D" projection, opposite a curved section, includes liquid flow<br>
aperture or gap arrangement therethrough.<br>
Other advantageous features in the housing, the access cover and the filter<br>
cartridge are described herein below.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
I. Crankcase ventilation (CCV) filter assembly features<br>
A. General features of a CCV filter assembly; Figs. 1-4<br>
The reference numeral 1, Fig. 1, generally represents a crankcase<br>
ventilation filter assembly according to the present disclosure. The assembly 1 depicted in<br>
Fig. 1 includes a housing 2 defining a housing interior and including a housing base 3, a<br>
top, or access (or service) cover or cover assembly 4, and an internally received<br>
serviceable, i.e., removable and replaceable filter cartridge or service component, not<br>
depicted in Fig. 1, but shown in Fig. 7 at reference numeral 5.<br>
In general, the housing 2 includes gas flow inlet 10, liquid drain outlet 11<br>
and gas flow outlet 12. For the example assembly 1 depicted in Fig. 1, the gas flow inlet<br>
10, the gas flow outlet 12 and the liquid drain outlet 11 are each positioned in the housing<br>
base 3.<br>
In use, blow-by gases (crankcase ventilation gases) are directed into the<br>
assembly 1 through inlet 10. Within the assembly 1, at least a portion of liquid particles<br>
(droplets) carried within the crankcase ventilation gases are coalesced, and drain<br>
outwardly from the assembly through drain outlet 11, typically at least under gravity<br>
influence. The gases are filtered, and the outlet gases leave the assembly I through gas<br>
outlet 12.<br>
The access or service cover or cover assembly 4 is removable from base 3.<br>
After a period of use. an internally received cartridge 5 will typically need to be serviced,<br>
for example by refurbishment or replacement. When such is the case, the access cover 4 is<br>
removed; the cartridge 5 is removed from the assembly 1; and, a new or refurbished<br>
cartridge 5 is installed. Herein the cartridge 5 which is removable and replaceable within<br>
the housing 2, is generally referenced as a "serviceable" cartridge.<br>
In Fig. 1A, assembly 1 is depicted in a top perspective view, directed<br>
generally toward an outlet side, i.e. toward outlet 12. In Fig. 1A, flexible locking tab or<br>
locking flange 13 is viewable mounted on the base 3 at a location to align with and engage<br>
one of recesses 14a in cover rim 14, when cover assembly 4 in threaded engagement with<br>
base 3. Recesses 14a are provided with sharp sides 14b. As a result, the locking flange 13<br>
and rim 14 form a ratchet system which inhibits rim 14 from rotation, in a<br>
counterclockwise manner (when viewed in the direction of Fig. 1A), when cover assembly<br>
4 is in position on base 3. This inhibits the cover or cover assembly 4 of undesirably<br>
rotating, or loosening, when in use.<br>
In Fig. 2, the assembly 1 is viewed in a top plan view. For convenience,<br>
cover or cover assembly 4 is marked with a designator "IN" at lOx in alignment with gas<br>
flow inlet 10, and the cover or cover assembly 4 is marked with a designator "OUT" at 12x<br>
in alignment with the gas flow outlet 12, when the cover or cover assembly 4 is properly<br>
secured to base 3, Fig. 1.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, at reference numeral 15, a mounting arrangement<br>
is shown positioned around the housing base 3 of the assembly 1. The mounting<br>
arrangement 15 generally comprises a mounting band 15a separable from housing 2 and<br>
usable to secure the housing 2 to equipment, in use.<br>
Attention is now directed to Fig. 3, a cross-sectional view taken generally<br>
along line 3-3, of Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 3, crankcase ventilation gas entry into the<br>
housing 2, again, occurs through inlet 10 and, the filtered gas flow outlet is indicated at 12,<br>
with a liquid drain outlet indicated at 11. Filter cartridge 5 is viewable, operably<br>
positioned within interior 3i of base 3 (i.e., within interior 2i of housing 2).<br>
Referring still to Fig. 3, in operation, after crankcase ventilation gases are<br>
directed through inlet 10, the gases pass regulator valve assembly 20, and are directed into<br>
cartridge 5, in particular into open interior 30 (of cartridge 5), which is surrounded by<br>
media 31. The gases are then directed into, and through, the media 31. Within the media<br>
31, at least a portion of liquid entrained within the gas flow stream will coalesce and drain<br>
from the media 31. Also, media 31 will capture selected particulate materials carried by<br>
the gas stream. The filtered gas stream then exits cartridge 5 at outer side or edge 5x, (i.e.,<br>
outer surface or edge 31o of media 31) and enters annul us 33, a filtered gas flow annulus<br>
which surrounds cartridge 5. From the annulus 33, the filtered gases are directed<br>
outwardly from base 3 by passage through outlet 12. The filtered gases can be vented to<br>
the atmosphere, or be directed to other equipment, depending on whether an open or<br>
closed system is involved. Typically the system will be closed, for example as<br>
characterized in connection with Fig. 21.<br>
In general, the regulator valve assembly 20 comprises a diaphragm 21<br>
supported by a biasing arrangement 22. The diaphragm 21 is flexible, and is mounted to<br>
regulate flow of gases through flow aperture arrangement 35 into cartridge open interior<br>
30. The biasing arrangement 22 typically comprises a coiled spring 23.<br>
In Fig. 3 A, an enlarged fragmentary view of portion of Fig. 3 is shown. It<br>
can be seen that diaphragm 21 comprises a rolling diaphragm 21x with an outer bead 21a<br>
secured between portions 4a, 4b of cover assembly 4.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 3, within open cartridge interior 30, the gas flow is<br>
directed through the media 31, from upstream surface or edge 31u to downstream surface<br>
or edge 3 Id, in part because end 36 of open cartridge interior 30 opposite from flow<br>
aperture arrangement 35, is closed by end piece 37. In the example shown, the upstream<br>
surface or edge 31u is within, and defines, interior 30; and, downstream surface or edge<br>
3 Id is an outer circumferential surface 31o, of media 31. Thus, for the assembly depicted<br>
in the figures, filtering flow "in-to-out," with reference to the media 31.<br>
Liquid drained from the media 31 can flow out from outer surface 3 lo of<br>
media 31. Liquid flow can also occur directly downwardly through a bottom end 39 of<br>
media 31, when the cartridge 5 includes a bottom liquid drain arrangement as depicted,<br>
and as discussed below. By "directly downwardly" in this context, it is meant that the<br>
liquid drainage referenced can be out of the media 31 through end 39, without necessarily<br>
needing to exit through surface 3 Id.<br>
It is noted that open interior 30 of media 31 (and cartridge 5) includes an<br>
inner support structure 40, in the form of a tubular grid with an openings therein.<br>
Cartridge 5 can be provided with a outer, porous, liner, not depicted,<br>
around outer surface 31o media 31, if desired.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3A, at 45 a housing seal arrangement is depicted,<br>
providing a seal between cartridge 5 and the housing base 3. The housing seal<br>
arrangement 45 separates upstream (unfiltered) and downstream (filtered) regions within<br>
assembly 1. For the particular example shown, the housing seal arrangement 45 comprises<br>
an o-ring 46, which engages an upper end seal flange or seal surface 48 in housing base 3.<br>
In particular, for the example depicted, seal surface 48 surrounds seal member 45 and<br>
surface 48 is positioned for sealing engagement by seal member45. Thus, the housing seal<br>
arrangement 45, for the example shown, is a peripheral, perimeter, arrangement on an end<br>
of cartridge 5, and which is radially outwardly directed therefrom. For the particular<br>
example assembly 1 shown in the figures, an upper open end 48u of surface 48, defines a<br>
generally circular definition. Surface 48 comprises a portion of an upper portion, region,<br>
projection or flange 48f in base 3.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 3A, for the example shown it is noted that engagement<br>
between the seal 45 and the surface 48 is at a portion of surface 48 which is above a lower<br>
most portion 10L of inlet 10, i.e., location of seal 45 is above the bottom of entry lOi,<br>
located at 10L.<br>
For the system shown, the inlet 10, the regular valve assembly 20, and<br>
interior 30 of cartridge 5, are located on the upstream side of the seal 45 and media 31.<br>
The clean gas annulus 33, drain 11, and the outlet 12 are on the downstream side of the<br>
housing seal arrangement 45.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 3 A, interior 3i of base 3 is in part defined by a lower<br>
inner wall 50 having surface 48 on an upper portion thereof. This lower inner wall 50<br>
generally has a cylindrical shape, with a circular cross-section. A center axis for wall 50<br>
and cartridge 5 is shown at Z.<br>
Aerosolized liquid contained within the inlet gas stream at inlet 10, can<br>
begin to coalesce along housing surfaces upstream of, and in some instances below,<br>
diaphragm 21. It is noted that a lower portion 10L of the inlet 10, at which such<br>
coalescing may occur, is located lower than a top 48u of flange 48f, and also lower than<br>
How aperture arrangement 35 of cartridge 5. For coalesced liquid within inlet 10 and<br>
around region 48f to reach interior 30, the coalesced liquid must be directed to a location<br>
above top end 48u of region 48f.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, to accommodate this, inlet 10 is directed into a gutter or<br>
trough arrangement 55 (herein a "gas/liquid flow gutter arrangement'") extending at least<br>
partially around cartridge 5. For the example shown, half of trough or gutter arrangement<br>
55 is depicted in Fig. 10 at 55x. A mirror image to section 55x is positioned on an<br>
opposite side of base 3. The trough half 55x extends partially around cartridge 3, and<br>
flange 48f, from inlet 10, and includes a defined an interior trough or flow channel with an<br>
upwardly directed ramp or ramp section at 55z. Airflow can push collected, coalesced,<br>
liquid along an inside of ramp section 55z until a location above seal surface 48 and<br>
aperture arrangement 35 of cartridge 5 is reached. From there, the liquid can drain onto<br>
the cartridge 5, and into aperture arrangement 35.<br>
In general, the trough or gutter arrangement 55 is in part defined between a<br>
portion of upper flange 48f (Fig. 3 A) and a portion of an outer perimeter of an upper<br>
section 3u, of housing base 3.<br>
Attention is now directed to Fig. 4, a top exploded, outlet end perspective<br>
view of assembly 1. Referring to Fig. 4, upper portion 3u of housing base 3 defines upper,<br>
open, access opening 57 having an (exterior) threaded mount 58 by which access cover<br>
assembly 4 can be secured to upper region 3u, by threaded engagement.<br>
For the example shown, upper portion 3u in access opening 57 defines a<br>
generally circular shape. It is noted that the circular shape of flange 48f, Fig. 3 A and seal<br>
surface 48 is not aligned coaxially or concentrically, with the circular shape of portion 3u<br>
of flange 57. That is, two portions of 3u, 48f of housing base 3 each define a circular<br>
definition, but they are not coaxial or concentric; i.e., they are eccentrically positioned.<br>
The first is flange 48f or seal surface 48 (which forms a top portion 48u of a bottom<br>
section 3b of housing base 3) and the second is flange 57, which is part of upper section 3u<br>
of housing base 3.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4 at 55y, a side of the trough arrangement 55 opposite side<br>
55x, Fig. 1, is viewable. It can be seen to include an internal upwardly directed ramp<br>
section 55r directed toward apex region 55a. The opposite side 55x, via ramp 55z, Fig. 1,<br>
would also direct liquid up to apex region 55a. In general terms, then, the trough<br>
arrangement 55, which extends at least partially around housing base 3 and cartridge 5,<br>
includes a ramp arrangement (in the example formed by ramp sections 55z, 55r ) directing<br>
liquid to apex or upper region 55a of trough arrangement 55.<br>
From the discussions with respect to Fig. 1 and also Fig. 4, it can be<br>
understood that crankcase ventilation gases entering housing base 1 via inlet 10, (i.e.<br>
entering interior 2i at inlet end lOi) enters a trough arrangement 55 which directs some air<br>
and coalesced liquid upwardly, due to the ramp arrangement 55r, 55z around to upper or<br>
apex portion 55a of base 3, via the two sides 55x, 55y. In particular, each side 55x, 55y<br>
includes an upwardly directed ramp section or ramp 55z, 55r respectively, which will help<br>
direct any liquid droplets coalesced within region 55 under airflow toward apex area 55a,<br>
interiorly of the region 57. Liquid can flow from apex 55a over end 48u of region 48, onto<br>
cartridge 5 and into aperture arrangement 35.<br>
In Fig. 4A, an enlarged, fragmentary view of a portion of Fig. 4 is shown.<br>
In a portion viewable in Fig. 4A, selected features characterized in the previous two<br>
paragraphs are readily viewed.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 4, some additional features related to the assembly 1<br>
can be viewed. Mounting arrangement 15 can be seen to have mounting flange portions<br>
15b, and center band portion 15a which surrounds base 3. The mounting flange portions<br>
15b include apertures 15c therethrough, through which bolts or other connectors can<br>
extend, to secure the mounting band 15, and thus assembly 1 to equipment, for use.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 4, radially interior edge 15x of center band 15a, which<br>
engages housing base 3, can be seen to have a serrated, or ridged, inner surface.<br>
Projections 3p on base 3, Fig. 3, underneath mounting arrangement 15, are sized to be<br>
engaged by ridges 15x, to inhibit rotational slippage of the mounting arrangement 15,<br>
relative to the housing base 3. Thus the mounting arrangement 15 can be positioned on<br>
the housing base 3 at an appropriate, selected, rotational location, for mounting to<br>
equipment to which the assembly 1 is eventually to be mounted. This rotational<br>
positioning of mounting engagement 15 on base 3 can be conducted as a prestep,<br>
facilitating mounting. Clip 15z is shown securing the band 15 closed.<br>
As an example, during manufacture of assembly 1, mounting arrangement<br>
15 can be appropriately rotationally positioned in housing base 3, for a particular<br>
installation. The part can then be shipped with mounting arrangement 15 appropriately<br>
positioned, and thus will be received by an installer assembly as facilitated.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3 A, it is noted that interior surface region 59 of rim 57 is a<br>
seal surface, for seal arrangement 60, in the example shown comprising an o-ring 61,<br>
positioned on cover assembly 4. Thus when cover assembly 4 is threaded in place on<br>
threads 58, o-ring seal 61 engages, and seals against, surface portion 59 on an opposite<br>
side of rim 57 from the threads 58.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 3 A, it is noted that axis Z indicates an approximate<br>
center line for cartridge 5 and interior surface 3x of a lower portion 3d of housing base 3.<br>
Axis Z, however, is not center line for threaded region 58, flange 57, seal surface 59 and a<br>
perimeter of cover or cover assembly 4. Again, this reflects, as discussed previously, that<br>
flange 57, i.e., upper portion 3u of housing base 3, is not concentric or coaxially aligned<br>
with lower portion 3d of housing base 3. In general terms, the housing base 3 includes an<br>
upper portion 3u and a lower portion 3d. The two portions 3u, 3d generally each define a<br>
circular definition, both for interior and an exterior. However the circular portions of<br>
regions 3u, 3d, are not concentrically aligned. Rather, they are eccentrically positioned,<br>
within housing base 3.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4A, attention is directed to selected features of cartridge 5.<br>
In particular, media 31 includes first upper end 3lu. Upper end 3lu terminates adjacent<br>
end piece 70, which form a first, upper in use, end piece on cartridge 5. By "upper" in this<br>
context, it is meant that the end piece 70 is typically directed upwardly, when the cartridge<br>
5 is installed for use.<br>
End piece 70 includes central aperture arrangement 35, extending<br>
therethrough, in flow communication with open interior 30, Fig. 3 A, of cartridge 5.<br>
End piece 70 includes a first outer surface 70s on a side of end piece 70<br>
opposite the media 31.<br>
The upper end piece 70 includes a plurality of additional features including:<br>
outer circumferential rim 71 with a trough 71a supporting perimeter housing seal<br>
arrangement 45 (in the example shown comprising o-ring 46). As described in connection<br>
with Fig. 3, the o-ring 46 is positioned so that when cartridge 5 is fully installed in base 3,<br>
seal arrangement 45 engages seal surface 48 along an interior of (lower portion 3d) of base<br>
3, at a position above a lower most portion 10L of inlet 10.<br>
End piece 70 of cartridge 5, Fig. 4A, further includes a central projection<br>
38 thereon. The central projection 38 generally projects away from the media pack 31,<br>
and toward cover assembly 4, when cartridge 5 is installed. There is no specific<br>
requirement that projection 38 extend parallel to a central axis (Z, Fig. 3 A) of the cartridge<br>
5. However, typically the direction of extension will be parallel or nearly parallel (but for<br>
example for a draft angle) to axis Z. In some instances, the projection 38 may be<br>
characterized as an "axial projection", such a term being meant to refer to a projection<br>
generally in a direction of axis Z. The term "axial projection" is not meant to require,<br>
specifically, that the direction of projection be precisely parallel with access z.<br>
The projection 38 is positioned around aperture arrangement 35, Fig. 3, and<br>
spaced inwardly from an outer perimeter (for example rim 71) of end piece 70. By the<br>
characterization that the projection 38 extends "around" the aperture arrangement 35, it is<br>
not meant that the projection 38 necessarily extends continuously and completely around<br>
the aperture arrangement 35. However, typically projection arrangement 38 will be<br>
continuous in extension around at least the majority, typically at least 80% of, and<br>
sometimes at least 90% of, the aperture arrangement 35. The flange 38 includes a gap 75<br>
therein. The gap 75 extends completely through flange 38. Gap 75 is a flow gap<br>
arrangement, for liquid that reaches surface 70s of end piece 70. Such liquid, as a result of<br>
gap 75, can flow through flange 38 into aperture arrangement 35 and thus into cartridge<br>
interior 30 and media 31. Liquid can reach surface 70s, as for example, after having<br>
coalesced with an upper portion 3u of housing base 3d, and then traveling up through<br>
ramp arrangement 55r, 55z under gas flow pressure, until apex 55a is reached. The liquid<br>
can then drain downwardly from apex region 55a onto surface 70s, and then through gap<br>
arrangement through 75 aperture arrangement 35 and into interior 30 of cartridge 5.<br>
It is noted that flange 38, for the example shown, defines a non-circular<br>
perimeter definition. The non-circular perimeter definition is discussed further below, in<br>
connection with other figures. In general, the non-circular perimeter facilitates rotational<br>
alignment with other features in the assembly 1.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 4A, base 3 includes two, rotationally spaced,<br>
upwardly projecting cartridge locator projections, flanges or ears 80. The locator<br>
projections 80 can generally be identical to one another. The locator projections 80 are<br>
spaced radially around a portion of cartridge 5. Generally, the degree of spacing of the<br>
locator projections 80, on center, is greater in one radial direction around cartridge 5 (in<br>
this instance the direction crossing over inlet 10i), than it is in a second radial direction<br>
around base 3 (in this instance a direction that crosses above outlet 12). This can also be<br>
seen by reference to Fig. 5. (By "on center" in this context, reference is meant to a<br>
radially spacing beginning from a radial center from one projection extending to a radial<br>
center of the other projection.)<br>
Still referring to Fig. 4A, cartridge locator projections 80 serve to help<br>
properly, rotationally position the cartridge 5, within cartridge 3. In particular, end piece<br>
70 of cartridge 5, Fig. 4A, includes spaced, outwardly projecting, radial projections 85, 86;<br>
and, spaced locator shoulders 88, 89. Projection 85 and locator shoulder 88 are spaced to<br>
define a first gap or receiver 90 therebetween; and projection 86 and locator shoulder 89<br>
are spaced to define a second gap or receiver 91 therebetween.<br>
When cartridge 5 is fully inserted in base 3, one of the cartridge locator<br>
projections 80, i.e., projection 80a will extend into the receiver 90, between projection 85<br>
and shoulder 88; and the other projection 80b will extend into the receiver 91 between<br>
projection 86 and shoulder 89. Receivers or gaps 90, 91, are spaced on center, in at least<br>
one radial direction, a distance corresponding to an angle of less than 180°. The receivers<br>
or gaps 90, 91 will typically be sized to just fit, with a little clearance, the projections 80a,<br>
80b. The non-symmetrical (rotational) positioning of the ears 80a, 80b, around rim 57,<br>
will ensure that there is only one rotational position allowing cartridge 5 to be fully nested<br>
inside of base 3. That rotational orientation is shown in Fig. 5.<br>
In general terms, referring to Fig. 4, assembly 1 includes a cartridge-to-<br>
housing base (or housing base-to-cartridge) rotational alignment indexing arrangement 93,<br>
which is constructed and arranged to insure that the cartridge 5 can only be operationally<br>
positioned in the housing base 3 (or housing 2) in a single, selected, rotational orientation.<br>
For the particular assembly 1 depicted, the cartridge-to-housing base rotational alignment<br>
indexing arrangement 93 comprises a projection/receiver arrangement including a<br>
projection arrangement (projections 80a, 80b for example) on housing base 3, engageable<br>
by receiver arrangement (the example shown, receivers 90, 91) on cartridge 5. The<br>
location of the projection(s) 80 and receiver(s) 90, 91, is such that the cartridge 5 can only<br>
be installed in the housing base 3 in one selected rotational orientation around axis Z, Fig.<br>
3.<br>
Fig. 10, base 3 is viewable with cartridge 5 removed. Locator projections<br>
of 80a, 80b are viewable. Also viewable is trough sections 55x, 55y with upwardly<br>
directed ramps 55z, 55r extending toward apex region 55a.<br>
In Figs. 5 and 6, the assembly 1 is depicted with the cover assembly 4<br>
removed, but with the cartridge 5 fully inserted in the housing base 3. In these Figs., it can<br>
be seen that the cartridge 5 has only one rotational orientation (around axis Z, Fig. 3)<br>
relative to the housing base 3, in which the cartridge 5 can be fully (operationally)<br>
inserted.<br>
Referring still to Fig. 5, end piece 70 further includes, projecting therefrom,<br>
handle arrangement 95. The handle arrangement 95 depicted is a perimeter handle<br>
arrangement 95b positioned at an outer circumferential (perimeter) portion of end piece<br>
70, in particular on a portion of rim 71. The handle 95 includes a handle bridge 95 a and<br>
further defines a central handle aperture 96 projecting through the handle 95 and under<br>
bridge 95a, between bridge 95 and a remainder of end piece 70. For the example shown,<br>
the cartridge 5 is rotationally indexed by engagement with the locator projections 80, such<br>
that aperture 96 is radially aligned with, and projects above, inlet 10 and aperture lOi.<br>
Further, aperture 96 is aligned with, and faces, a straight side portion of projection 38,<br>
discussed below. The example bridge 95a depicted is arcuate in extension partially around<br>
central aperture arrangement 35. The angle AR, Fig. 8, of arcuate extension is typically at<br>
least 30°, usually 40° or more.<br>
The handle arrangement 95 is often referred to herein as a "perimeter" or<br>
"peripheral" arrangement, or by similar terms, since the handle arrangement 95 is secured<br>
to cartridge 5 at the perimeter region of end caps 70.<br>
For the example shown, the handle arrangement 95 is "non-collapsible."<br>
By this, it is meant that the handle 95 remains upright, i.e., does not fold over otherwise<br>
collapse during installation of the cartridge 5 in the housing base 3. The term "non-<br>
collapsible" in its context, is not meant to indicate that the handle 95 cannot be collapsed<br>
by being broken if sufficient pressure is applied. Rather it is meant that in normal use of<br>
the handle arrangement 95 maintains a single orientation, and is not collapsed or folded<br>
during its normal use or handling.<br>
Handle aperture 96 is depicted located in radial alignment with aperture<br>
10i. This facilitates flow of air from inlet 10 across end piece 70 to aperture 35 for flow<br>
into cartridge interior 30. The handle aperture 96 also provides a convenient arrangement<br>
with handle bridge 95a, for grasping during installation and servicing. Thus, bridge 95a<br>
and handle aperture 96 are typically sized to accommodate a portion of service operator's<br>
hand projecting through aperture 96, to facilitate grasping of cartridge 5.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 5, projection of rim 71 axially out from (upwardly<br>
from in use) surface 70s (i.e. in a direction away from media 31, Fig. 3) provides for rim<br>
containment of liquid that reaches surface 70s, facilitating liquid flow through gap 75 into<br>
aperture arrangement 35 and cartridge interior 30.<br>
In Fig. 6, another view of the partial assembly depicted in Fig. 5 is shown,<br>
rotated from the view of Fig. 5, to facilitate observation of the identified features.<br>
B. Further regarding features of cartridge 5, Figs. 7-9 and 17<br>
In Fig. 7, a top perspective view of cartridge 5 is provided. In Fig. 8 a top<br>
plan view is provided and in Fig. 9 a cross-sectional view. In Fig. 17 a component of the<br>
cartridge 5 is depicted, as discussed below.<br>
Referring first to Fig. 7, cartridge 5 is depicted in perspective view, with<br>
end piece 70 viewable, the depiction being toward surface 70s. Surface 70s will<br>
sometimes be referred to as "recessed surface portion" of end piece 70, between perimeter<br>
rim 71 and projection 38.<br>
It can be seen from Fig. 7, that opposite end piece 70, at opposite end 31d<br>
of media pack 31 (from end 3 lu) cartridge 5 includes a second end piece 100. Second end<br>
piece 100 is a lower or bottom end piece, when cartridge 5 as installed for use. End piece<br>
100 for the example shown, includes a plurality of spaced outer peripheral projections 101.<br>
Attention is now directed to Fig. 17, which depicts cartridge support piece<br>
110. Cartridge support piece 110 generally comprises end piece 70, interior support 40<br>
and piece 100, for the example shown formed integral with one another. Cartridge support<br>
piece 110, for typical applications, comprises a single, integral, plastic molded piece. To<br>
form cartridge 5, media 31, Fig. 7, is generally mounted around support 40 in extension<br>
between end pieces 100, 70, to form media pack 31. As an example, media 115 (Fig. 7)<br>
can be wrapped around support 40. As mentioned previously, an outer liner can be<br>
provided around the media 115.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 17, it can be seen that end piece 100 comprises:<br>
central region 37 which encloses a lower end of open interior 30, in the resulting cartridge<br>
5 of Fig. 7; perimeter, spaced, projections 101 and intermediate, closed, region 118. The<br>
projections 101 define spaced drain openings lOlo therebetween. The drain openings<br>
lOlo in the cartridge 5, Fig. 7, align with portions of bottom end 3 Id, of the media pack<br>
31. This allows drain of liquid from media pack 31, in part, directly downwardly from end<br>
3 Id, through drain openings lOlo, adjacent an outer peripheral portion 310 of the media<br>
pack 31, i.e., adjacent outer surface 5x, Fig. 3. This creates a bottom drain arrangement<br>
for the cartridge 7.<br>
In general terms, cartridge 17 includes a bottom end piece 100, in use,<br>
which includes bottom drain arrangement therein. The bottom drain arrangement<br>
comprises apertures, notches, or other features allowing for drainage of liquid for the<br>
media pack 31 direction downwardly, from the media pack 31, without the liquid needing<br>
to flow out of surface 31o of media 31 (i.e., from outer surface 5x of the cartridge 5). It is<br>
expected in a typical applications there will be liquid drainage both through outer edge 5x<br>
and also directly downwardly through the liquid drain arrangement, in this instance<br>
represented by drain openings 10lo.<br>
The cartridge 17, then, can be characterized as having an aperture<br>
arrangement in "direct drain overlap" with a bottom end of the media 31. By "direct drain<br>
overlap" in this context, it is meant that the drain aperture opening or drain apertures lOlo,<br>
are aligned with a bottom end 39 of the media 31, so the liquid can drain directly from the<br>
media 31 through the drain openings lOlo, without needing to necessarily pass through an<br>
outer surface 31 o of the media 31. In typical operation, the liquid will flow both directly<br>
downwardly through the liquid drain arrangement, and outwardly from outer surface 3 lo<br>
of the media pack 31, to provide for a good liquid drainage flow from the media 31.<br>
A good liquid drainage flow from the media 31 facilitates operation of the<br>
assembly 1, since drainage of liquid is important to overall operation of the cartridge 5.<br>
Incorporation of a bottom drain arrangement allowing for liquid flow both from the<br>
bottom of the media pack 31 and from the outer surface 3 lo, facilitates good drainage.<br>
Bottom drain arrangements in general, for crankcase ventilation filters, are<br>
described in US provisional application 60/731,287 filed October 28, 2005 and PCT<br>
application US 06/41738 filed October 27, 2006, each of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 17, it is noted that region 37 of end piece 100<br>
projects upwardly within tube 40 and within cartridge open interior 30 in use, relative to a<br>
remainder of end piece 100.<br>
Attention is now directed to Fig. 8, a top plan view of cartridge 5.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, it can be seen that projection 38 is non-circular and generally has a<br>
curved side section 125 and an opposite straight side section 126. The projection 38<br>
further includes opposite straight transition regions or sections 127, 128 extending<br>
between side sections 125, 126. Thus, again, projection 38 preferably is not circular, but<br>
rather is non-circular and has a shape rotationally asymmetric around axis Z. By<br>
'"rotationally asymmetric" in this contexts, and in related context, it is meant that when<br>
rotated around central axis Z, projection 38 only fully aligns with itself in one rotational<br>
orientation, i.e., after 360° rotation.<br>
For the example shown, gap 75 is through a portion of straight side section<br>
126.<br>
The particular flange 38 shown, has a D-shape; i.e., a D-shaped inner<br>
definition and outer perimeter. In the particular example shown, straight side 126 is<br>
directed toward handle 95 and handle aperture 96, and includes gap 75 therethrough.<br>
In general terms, the perimeter shape of projection 38 can be provided in a<br>
variety forms, preferably none of which is radially symmetric. By this, again, it is meant<br>
that to overlap itself and define the same perimeter, the projection 38 would need to be<br>
rotated a full 360° around central axis Z (Fig. 3). The "D" shape selected, is one of a<br>
variety of potential shapes. The "D" shape also provides for an ornamental appearance, as<br>
well as a distinctive designator indicating the company "Donaldson," the assignee of the<br>
present application.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 8, within interior 30 of cartridge 5, adjacent aperture<br>
arrangement 35 and projecting downwardly therefrom, are spaced rib projections 130,<br>
each of which is directed generally radially inwardly, from the remainder of inner support<br>
40. It can be seen, referring to Fig. 9, that these rib projections 130 generally project<br>
inwardly, in uninterrupted extension, between end piece 70 and opposite end piece 100,<br>
although alternatives (for example discontinuous extension) is possible in some instances.<br>
Still referring to Figs. 8 and 9, in addition, cartridge 5, in particular support<br>
piece 110, further includes a double rib arrangement 140 comprising a pair of spaced ribs<br>
141, 142, positioned depending from end piece 70 in extension to end piece 100, from<br>
locations on opposite sides of gap 75.<br>
Ribs 130, of double rib arrangement 140, and ribs 130 will strengthen<br>
central support region 140 and will facilitate rotational indexing of a portion of access<br>
cover assembly 4 with cartridge 5 and housing base 3.<br>
C. The access cover assembly 4 of Figs. 11-16.<br>
Referring to Fig. 11, a top plan view of access cover assembly 4 is<br>
provided. Referring to Fig. 13, an exploded, top, perspective view of cover assembly 4 is<br>
shown, indicating that the cover assembly 4 includes a top or cover member 150, regulator<br>
valve assembly diaphragm 21, coiled spring 23, and lower basket arrangement 151. O-<br>
ring 61 is also viewable.<br>
Referring to Fig. 16, cover or cover assembly 4 is depicted in cross-section.<br>
Cover or cover assembly 4 depicted, includes cover member 150 secured to lower basket<br>
151, with diaphragm 21 positioned therebetween. Specifically, diaphragm 21 includes an<br>
outer peripheral bead 21a secured between portion of cover member 150 and a portion of<br>
lower basket 151. In particular, bead 21 a is positioned in bead trough 1511 of lower basket<br>
151.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 16, o-ring 61 is shown positioned around a portion of<br>
lower basket member 151, for sealing against surface 59, Fig. 3A, when threads 58x of<br>
cover or cover assembly 4 is threaded on to threads 58 of base 3.<br>
In Fig. 18, it can be seen that cover member 150 comprises an assembly<br>
including rim 150a and cap member or cap 150b. For the assembly of cover assembly 4,<br>
cap member 150b is pressed against rim 150a with snap-fit projections or hooks 150c<br>
projecting through aperture 150d.<br>
Referring to Fig. 19, a cross-sectional view taken along line 19-19, Fig. 11,<br>
snap-fit hooks 150c, during assembly, will project through aperture 150d to engage a<br>
portion of lower basket assembly 151, in particular a portion of upper rim 151a. As a<br>
result of this engagement, there is no interfering connection between cap 150b and rim<br>
150a. Further there is no interfering connection between rim 150a and basket arrangement<br>
151. Thus rim 150a can rotate independently of cap 150b and lower basket member 151.<br>
In general terms, the access cover assembly 4 includes a snap-fit projection<br>
arrangement, for securing cap member 150b to basket member 151. The snap-fit<br>
projection arrangement, in the example shown, comprises a plurality of snap-fit projection<br>
150c on the cap member 150b.<br>
Referring to Fig. 18, hooks 150c are generally positioned to engage rim<br>
portion 151r in such a matter that the hooks 150c become positioned on opposite sides of<br>
various ones of flanges 15 If. Flanges 15 If will inhibit rotation of the cap member 150b<br>
relative to lower basket member 151.<br>
Referring to Fig. 19, outer bead 21a of diaphragm 21 is secured in place<br>
between projection 150e on member 150b, and receiving groove 151t on lower basket<br>
member 151. The positioning of diaphragm 21 in this manner, is conducted with biasing<br>
member 22, i.e., coiled spring 23, secured from a location around a downward projection<br>
2 Id in the center of diaphragm 21, and spring receiver shelf 160 in center piece 161 of<br>
lower basket member 151.<br>
In general, referring to Fig. 18, a cap member-to-basket member (or basket<br>
member-to-cap member) rotational alignment indexing arrangement is provided, to<br>
provide selected, indexed, rotational engagement between cap 150b and lower basket 151.<br>
As described above, the cap member-to-basket member rotational alignment indexing<br>
arrangement, for example in assembly 1 depicted, in part comprises snap-fit hooks 150c<br>
engaging a portion of rim 15 lr such that the flanges 15 If are positioned between selected<br>
hooks 151c, to inhibit rotation of cap 150b relative to lower basket member 151.<br>
In addition, in Fig. 18, lower basket 151 can be seen as including upwardly<br>
projecting receivers 162, 163. The receivers 162, 163 are rotationally spaced, but are<br>
spaced apart, on center in a shorter radial direction by an amount less than 180°. That is,<br>
they are rotationally, asymmetrically, positioned on member 151.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 14, an exploded, bottom, perspective view of cover<br>
assembly 4, can be seen that cap member 150b includes projecting therefrom, in a<br>
direction toward basket member 151, a pair of spaced projections 164, 165. The<br>
projections 164, 165 are radially spaced on center by, in a shorter direction, a spacing of<br>
less than 180°; i.e., projections 164, 165 are non-radially symmetrically spaced on cap<br>
150b. On center radial spacing between projections 164, 165 is the same as the spacing<br>
between receivers 162, 163, Fig. 18. When the cover assembly 4 is fully assembled,<br>
projections 164, 165 project into, and are received by, receivers 162, 163, respectively.<br>
The engagement between the projections 164, 165 and the receivers 162, 163, helps<br>
provide for a maintained rotational alignment between base 150b and basket arrangement<br>
162, 163. In addition, the projection/receiver arrangement represented by projections 164,<br>
165 and receivers 162, 163, provides for convenient alignment, during an assembly<br>
process, to ensure the cap 150b is appropriately aligned with respect to the lower basket<br>
151.<br>
In more general terms, the cover assembly 4 includes a cap member-to-<br>
basket member (or basket member-to-cap member) rotational alignment indexing<br>
arrangement including a projection/receiver arrangement. The projection/receiver<br>
arrangement includes a first projection member on one of the cap 150b and basket 151;<br>
and a second receiver member on a second one of the cap 150b and basket 151. For the<br>
example described, the projection member is on the cap 150b, and comprises snap-fit<br>
hooks 150c and first and second projection members 164, 165; and, the receiver member<br>
is positioned on the basket 151 comprises a space under rim 151r, flanges 15 If and first<br>
and second receivers 162, 163. The projection/receiver arrangement operates to provide a<br>
cap member-to-basket member rotation alignment indexing arrangement, which ensures<br>
that the cap member 150b can only be positioned in engagement with the basket member<br>
151 in a single, selected, rotational orientation, in which it will remain.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 14, basket member 151 includes an outer ring section<br>
170. The outer rim section 170 includes rim 15 lr (Fig. 13) and receivers 162, 163 therein.<br>
In Fig. 14A, an enlarged view of basket member 151 is depicted, directed toward a side<br>
that is directed downwardly, in use. In Fig. 14B, an enlarged fragmentary view of a<br>
portion of Fig. 14A is depicted.<br>
The outer ring section 170 (Fig. 14A) includes therein slot receivers 175,<br>
176 and 177. Slot receiver 175 is positioned radially between slot receivers 176, 177. Slot<br>
receiver 175 is sized and oriented to receive handle 95 projecting upwardly therein, when<br>
cover 4 is appropriately positioned on housing base 3, with a cartridge 5 in place.<br>
Receivers 176, 177, are positioned to receive one each of the ear projections 80, therein,<br>
during positioning of cover assembly 4 on base 5, with cartridge 5 in place.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 14A, lower basket member 151 includes outer ring<br>
170 and center member 161. The outer ring 170 defines central aperture 170a. The center<br>
member 161 is secured to the rim 170 (depending downwardly in use from aperture 170a),<br>
by spaced legs 181. Each leg 181 is a generally u-shaped, with a central vertex 181 v<br>
which is directed downwardly when cover assembly 4 is installed on housing base 3. The<br>
number of legs 181 is a matter of choice, for a selected assembly. Typically there will be<br>
at least three legs 181, not more than nine legs 181. For the example shown there are<br>
seven, evenly spaced, legs 181.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3 A, the central vertex 181 v of the legs 181 is directed<br>
downwardly to engage surface portion 70s of end cap 70, of assembly 1. Spacing between<br>
the legs 181 facilitates air and liquid flow to interior 30 of cartridge 5.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 14A, the center member 161 includes an outer rim<br>
projection 190 and a central depending tubular member 191. The outer rim projection 190<br>
is spaced from the central, depending, tubular member 191, to define a slot 192<br>
therebetween.<br>
Attention is now directed to Fig. 14B (an enlarged, fragmentary, view of a<br>
portion of Figs. 14 and 14A) and in particular to the outer rim projection 190. The<br>
projection 190 has a non-circular shape. The shape of projection 190 should match (but<br>
for size) the shape of projection 38, Figs. 7 and 8. Thus for the example shown, projection<br>
190 has a D-shape with a straight side 195 and an opposite curved side 196. For the<br>
example shown, projection 190 also has a pair of opposite straight sections 197, 198<br>
extending between sides 195, 196.<br>
In more general terms, projection 190 preferably defines a perimeter shape<br>
which must be rotated 360° (one complete time) around central axis Z, Fig. 3A, to realign<br>
(overlap) with itself. The "D" shape selected, is to match the projection 38. Typically one<br>
of projections 38, 190 will be larger than the other one of projections 190, 38, so that one<br>
can nest within the other.<br>
For the example shown, Fig. 3 A, with cover assembly 4 positioned on base<br>
3, and with the cartridge 5 installed, projection 38 on piece 70 receives projecting therein,<br>
and also surrounds, projection 190. This is shown in Fig. 3A. Preferably there is a<br>
surface-to-surface engagement between inner surface 38i, Fig. 7, of projection 38 and<br>
outer surface 190o, Fig. 14, of projection 190. Such a snug fit will inhibit gas flow<br>
between the two parts (38, 190). Preferably gas flow into interior 30 of cartridge 5 enters<br>
by air passing over flange 38 and projection 190. This facilitates operation of the<br>
regulator valve arrangement 20.<br>
Clearance along a bottom end 138b (Fig. 3 A) of projection 38 and tip 190t<br>
of projection 190 should be sufficient, to allow some liquid flow through gap 75, into<br>
interior 30 of an installed cartridge. Such a flow gap for liquid would generally be<br>
insufficiently large with respect to allowing gas flow, to disable operation of the regulator<br>
valve assembly 20.<br>
Typically, a gap or clearance of at least 0.3 mm in this region is sufficient.<br>
Typically the gap or clearance will typically be about 1 mm - 5 mm, for example 2-5<br>
mm. In Fig. 3A, this gap, which is located at 30g, is shown on the shorter or smaller side,<br>
but will typically be larger.<br>
Alternately stated, typically projection 190 is sufficiently shorter than<br>
projection 30a, such that projection 190 projects into projection 30a a short distance,<br>
leaving a gap of at least 0.3 mm, typically at least 1 mm and often on the order of 2-5 mm,<br>
for example 4 mm, between an end projection 190 and a bottom end of projection 30a,<br>
adjacent aperture arrangement 35.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 14B, center member 191 is generally tubular, with a<br>
circular outer periphery. Member 191 includes gap 200 therein. The gap 200 is sized to<br>
receive double rib 140, comprising ribs 141, 142, Fig. 8, therein, when cover assembly 4 is<br>
installed on housing base 3, with cartridge 5 received therein. As a result of this<br>
engagement, gap 200 will align with gap 75, allowing liquid flow from surface 70s into<br>
aperture 35 and interior 30 of cartridge 5 (Fig. 3).<br>
In addition to gap 200, Fig. 14B member 191 includes spaced receivers or<br>
slots 201. The receivers 201 are positioned to align with, and receive, ribs 130, Fig. 8.<br>
when cover assembly 4 is positioned on housing base 3, with cartridge 5 installed.<br>
Still referring to Fig. 14B, apertures 205 in member 191 provide gas flow<br>
passage into media 31. Along an interior of piece 191, support shelf 210 is provided, to<br>
contain coiled spring 23.<br>
From the above, it will be understood the assembly 1 is configured for a<br>
single, defined, rotational alignment of base 3, cartridge 5, basket member 151 and cap<br>
150b. When properly assembled, cap 150b will be oriented with designator lOx, i.e., "IN"<br>
aligned with inlet 10, Fig. 2, and with designator 12x, i.e., "OUT" Fig. 2, aligned with<br>
outlet 12. As a result of indexing provided by projections 164, 165, receivers, 162, 163,<br>
snap-in projection 150c and flanges 15It, there will be simultaneous rotational orientation<br>
of basket member 151 within assembly 1. The orientation will be with receiver 175<br>
receiving handle 95, receivers 177, 176 receiving the ears 80, and with D-shaped flange<br>
190 received inside of and preferably in side surface (gas flow inhibition) engagement<br>
with, projection 38 of cartridge 5. (The cartridge 5 is rotationally fixed as a result of<br>
engagement between receivers 90, 91 and ears 80).<br>
In general, the cover member 4 will not be able to press downwardly into a<br>
secure engagement, unless receiver 200 in center projection member 191, is aligned with<br>
gap 75 and double rib arrangement 140.<br>
Attention is directed to Fig. 12, a cross-sectional view taken along line 12-<br>
12, Fig. 11. In Fig. 12, assembly 4 can be seen in cross-sectional view, with center<br>
member 191 spaced from D-shaped projection 190 and with spaced legs 181 oriented with<br>
vertices 181 v directed downwardly, as would be typical during assembly.<br>
In Fig. 15, an enlarged fragmentary view of a portion of Fig. 4 is shown.<br>
Here, snap-fit projection 150c extending through aperture 150d to engage a portion of<br>
basket member 151 can be seen. Rim 150a will be understood to be rotatable, relative to<br>
cap 150b and basket member 151.<br>
In Fig. 13, cover assembly 4 is shown in a partially exploded view,<br>
depicting cover member 150 (assembled), basket member 151, and diaphragm 121<br>
between cover member 150 and basket member 121.<br>
Fig. 20 is an enlarged fragmentary view of a portion of Fig. 19. Features of<br>
cover assembly 4 are viewable.<br>
D. Example dimensions; materials.<br>
In the examples depicted in Figs. 1-20, example dimensions are provided<br>
for a further understanding of the disclosure. In the figures, the indicated dimensions are<br>
as follows: In Fig. 1, AA = 122.3 mm; AB = 15.5 mm; AC = 19.0 mm; AD = 19.0 mm;<br>
AE = 42 mm; AF = 164.7 mm; AG = 12.3 mm; AH = 93.6 mm; and, AI = 142 mm. In<br>
Fig. 2, BA = 168 mm; BB = 64 mm; BC = 126.4 mm; and, BD = 171 mm. In Fig. 3, CA =<br>
164.7 mm; CB = 120 mm; and, CC = 135.5 mm. In Fig. 8, DA = 86.1 mm diameter. In<br>
Fig. 9, EA = 42.1 mm; EB = 15.2 mm; EC = 124.5 mm; and, ED = 73.7 mm. Other<br>
dimensions can be taken from scale, except, as characterized above, in Fig. 3A, projection<br>
190 depicted extending further into projection 30a than would be typical and preferred,<br>
usually a gap of at least 1 mm, typically at least 2 mm, and, for example, on the order of<br>
about 4 mm will be left between the tip of projection 190 and the base of projection 38.<br>
Of course alternative dimensions can be used with the current principles.<br>
A variety of materials can be used for the structural materials, and typically<br>
are a matter of a choice.<br>
Typically for the housing base 3, a plastic will be chosen, for example a<br>
glass-filled (33%) nylon 66 or similar material. For the cover assembly 4, the cap member<br>
150a and basket member 151, would typically comprise a molded plastic, for example<br>
nylon 66, glass-filled (33%). The rim member 150b will typically comprise an Acetal.<br>
Within the cartridge 5, the support member 110 will typically comprise a<br>
molded plastic, for example a glass-filled (33%) nylon 66 or similar material can be used.<br>
The mounting arrangement 15 would typically comprise glass-filled (33%) nylon 66.<br>
The media or media 31 is described in Section III below.<br>
II. Example System, Fig. 21<br>
Attention is directed to Fig. 21, which shows an example system including<br>
a filter arrangement 1 according to the present disclosure. Referring to Fig. 21, the system<br>
250 includes an engine 251. The filter assembly 1 is depicted, schematically, oriented to<br>
receive crankcase ventilation flow from the engine 251. At 252 off gases from the filter<br>
assembly 1, are shown directed ultimately to inlet 253 of turbo 254. In Fig. 21, an air<br>
cleaner arrangement 260 is shown, which provides for filtered ambient air flow to the<br>
turbo 254 in the engine 251.<br>
Of course the off gases 252 can be directed elsewhere, for example into air<br>
cleaner 260, if desired.<br>
In general, the system 250 depicted is "closed" in that filtered off gases<br>
from the filter arrangement 1 are not vented directly to the atmosphere, but rather are<br>
cycled back into the engine intake indicated generally at 270.<br>
Although not shown, a typical system 250 would include pressure relief<br>
valve assembly ensuring that crankcase ventilation flow from the engine 251 is vented to<br>
the atmosphere, if the filter arrangement 1 or equipment downstream from filter<br>
arrangement, is sufficiently occluded to build up pressure to an otherwise (if not vented)<br>
undesirable level.<br>
III. Useable Media<br>
A. General Characteristics<br>
The appropriate media, for the media pack, is selected for the conditions of<br>
use. Generally the media is selected to have appropriate properties with respect to:<br>
coalescing and drainage of liquid; and, filtering of gases passing therethrough with respect<br>
to particulates. Layers of media can be utilized for the media of the media pack. Example<br>
usable media described in US Provisional Application Serial No. 60/731,287, filed<br>
October 28, 2005, PCT Application PCT/US2006/041738, filed October 27, 2006, US<br>
Provisional Application 60/656,806, filed February 22, 2006; and, PCT Publication<br>
WO06/91594, published August 31, 2006, and PCT Publication WO 2006/084282,<br>
published October 19, 2006, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Typically the media will comprise a continuous, non-woven, fibrous media.<br>
An example useable media as described in U.S. provisional application<br>
60/656,806 filed February 22, 2005, incorporated herein by reference. Another example<br>
media is described in PCT Publication WO 05/083,240, published September 9, 2005, and<br>
incorporated herein by reference. A third example media is described in U.S. provisional<br>
application 60/650,051 filed February 4, 2005, incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
following description is of example media from U.S. provisional application 60/650,051,<br>
filed February 4, 2005.<br>
The media is typically a wet laid media is formed in a sheet form using wet<br>
laid processing, and is then positioned on/in the filter cartridge. Typically the wet laid<br>
media sheet is at least used as a media stage stacked in multiple layers.<br>
As indicated, multiple layers, forming a gradient can be provided in a<br>
media stage, by first applying one or more layers of wet laid media of first type and then<br>
applying one or more layers of a media (typically a wet laid media) of a different, second,<br>
type. Typically when a gradient is provided, the gradient involves use of two or more<br>
media types which are selected for at least differences in efficiency.<br>
Herein, it is important to distinguish between the definition of the media<br>
sheet used to form the media stage, and the definitions of the overall media stage itself.<br>
Herein the term "wet laid sheet," "media sheet" or variants thereof, is used to refer to the<br>
sheet material that is used to form the media extension of a filter, as opposed to the overall<br>
definition of the total media extension in the filter. This will be apparent from certain of<br>
the following descriptions.<br>
Media extensions of the type of primary concern herein, are at least used<br>
for coalescing/drainage, although they typically also have particulate removal function and<br>
thus comprise a portion of an overall media stage that provides for both<br>
coalescing/drainage and desired removal efficiency of solid particulate removal.<br>
Although alternatives are possible, an example media composition used to<br>
form a media extension in a CCV (crankcase ventilation) filter for coalescing/drainage is<br>
typically as follows:<br>
1. Although alternatives are possible for different applications, it is<br>
typically provided in a form having a calculated pore size (X-Y direction) of at<br>
least 10 micron, usually at least 12 micron. The pore size is typically no greater<br>
than 60 micron, for example within the range of 12-50 micron, typically 15-45<br>
micron.<br>
2. It is typically formulated to have a DOPE % efficiency (at 10.5 fpm<br>
for 0.3 micron particles), within the range of 3-18%, typically 5-15%.<br>
3. It typically comprises at least 30% by weight, typically at least 40%<br>
by weight, often at least 45% by weight and usually within the range of 45-70% by<br>
weight, based on total weight of filter material within the sheet, bi-component<br>
(binder) fiber material in accord with the general description provided herein.<br>
4. It typically comprises 30 to 70% (typically 30-55%), by weight,<br>
based on total weight of fiber material within the sheet, of secondary fiber material<br>
having average largest cross-sectional dimensions (average diameter if round) of at<br>
least 1 micron, for example within the range of 1 to 20 micron. In some instances<br>
it will be 8-15 micron. The average lengths are typically 1 to 20 mm, often 1-10<br>
mm. This secondary fiber material can be a mix of fibers. Typically polyester<br>
and/or glass fibers are used, although alternatives are possible.<br>
5. Typically and preferably the fiber sheet (and resulting media<br>
extension) includes no added binder other than the binder material contained<br>
within the bi-component fibers. If an added resin or binder is present, preferably it<br>
is present at no more than about 7% by weight of the total fiber weight, and more<br>
preferably no more than 3% by weight of the total fiber weight.<br>
Media in accord with the general definitions provided herein, including a<br>
mix of bi-component (binder) fiber and other fiber, can be used as any (and in some<br>
instances all) layer(s) of a media stage in a crankcase ventilation filter as generally<br>
described above. When used in this manner, it will typically be placed in multiple layers,<br>
although alternatives are possible. The overall efficiency can be calculated based upon the<br>
number of layers and the efficiency of each layer. For example the efficiency at 10.5 feet<br>
per minute (3.2 m/min) for 0.3 micron DOPE particles for media stage comprising two<br>
layers of wet laid media each having an efficiency of 12% would be 22.6%, i.e., 12% + .12<br>
x88.<br>
Typically enough media sheets would be used in the final media stage to<br>
provide the media stage with overall efficiency of at least 85%, typically 90% or greater.<br>
In some instances it would be preferred to have the efficiency at 95% or more. In the<br>
context the term "final media stage" refers to a stage resulting from wraps or coils of the<br>
sheet(s) of the media.<br>
13. The Preferred Calculated Pore Size.<br>
The media extension performs two important functions:<br>
1. It provides for some coalescing and drainage of oil particles carried<br>
in the crankcase ventilation gases being filtered; and<br>
2. It provides for selected filtration of other particulates in the gas<br>
stream.<br>
In general, if the pore size is too low:<br>
a. Drainage of coalesced oil particles by gravity, downwardly through<br>
(and from) the media, can be difficult or slowed, which leads to an increase of re-<br>
entrainment of the oil into the gas stream; and<br>
b. Unacceptable levels of restriction are provided to the crankcase gas<br>
flow through the media.<br>
In general, if the porosity is too high:<br>
a. Oil particles are less likely to collect and coalesce; and<br>
b. A large number of layers, and thus media thickness, will be<br>
necessary to achieve an acceptable overall level of efficiency for the media pack.<br>
It has been found that for crankcase ventilation filters, a calculated pore<br>
size for media used to form media extension within the range of 12 to 50 micron is<br>
generally useful. Typically the pore size is within the range of 15 to 45 micron.<br>
The term X-Y pore size and variants thereof when used herein, is meant to<br>
refer to the theoretical distance between fibers in a filtration media. X-Y refers to the<br>
surface direction versus the Z direction which is the media thickness. The calculation<br>
assumes that all the fibers in the media are lined parallel to the surface of the media,<br>
equally spaced, and ordered as a square when viewed in cross-section perpendicular to the<br>
length of the fibers. The X-Y pore size is a distance between the fiber surfaces on the<br>
opposite corners of the square. If the media is composed of fibers of various diameters,<br>
the d mean of the fiber is used as the diameter. The d mean is the square root of the<br>
average of the diameters squared.<br>
It has been found, in some instances, that it is useful to have calculated pore<br>
sizes on the higher end of the preferred range, typically 30 to 50 micron, when the media<br>
stage at issue has a total vertical height, in the crankcase ventilation filter of less than 7<br>
inches (178 mm); and, pore sizes on the smaller end, about 15 to 30 micron, are sometimes<br>
useful when the filter cartridge has a height on the larger end, typically 7-12 inches (178 -<br>
305 mm). A reason for this is that taller filter stages provide for a higher liquid head,<br>
during coalescing, which can force coalesced liquid flow, under gravity, downwardly<br>
through smaller pores, during drainage. The smaller pores, of course, allow for higher<br>
efficiency and fewer layers.<br>
Of course in a typical operation in which the same media stage is being<br>
constructed for use in a variety of filter sizes, typically for at least a portion of the wet laid<br>
media used for the coalescing/drainage in initial separation, an average pore size of about<br>
30-50 microns will be useful.<br>
C. Solidity<br>
Solidity is the volume fraction of media occupied by the fibers. It is the<br>
ratio of the fibers volume per unit mass divided by the media's volume per unit mass.<br>
Typical materials preferred for use in media extension according to the<br>
present disclosure, have a percent solidity at 0.125 psi (8.6 milliards) of fewer than 10%,<br>
and typically fewer than 8%, for example 6-7%.<br>
D. Preferred DOPE Efficiency at 10.5 ft/minute for 0.3 micron particles.<br>
The preferred efficiency stated, is desirable for layers or sheets of media to<br>
be used to generate crankcase ventilation filters. This requirement indicates that a number<br>
of layers of the wet laid media will typically be required, in order to generate an overall<br>
desirable efficiency for the media stage of typically at least 85% or often 90% or greater,<br>
in some instances 95% or greater.<br>
The reason a relatively low efficiency is provided in any given layer, is that<br>
it facilitates coalescing and drainage and overall function.<br>
In general, DOPE efficiency is a fractional efficiency of a 0.3 micron<br>
DOPE particle (dactyl phthalate) challenging the media at 10 fpm. A TSAR model 3160<br>
Bench (TSAR Incorporated, St. Paul, Minnesota) can be used to evaluate this property.<br>
Model dispersed particles of DOPE are sized and neutralized prior to challenging the<br>
media.<br>
E. The Media Composition.<br>
1. The Bi-Component Fiber Constituent.<br>
As indicated above, it is preferred that the fiber composition of the media<br>
include 30 to 70%), by weight, of bi-component (binder) fiber material. A major advantage<br>
of using bi-component fibers in the media, is effective utilization of fiber size while<br>
maintaining a relatively low solidity. With the bi-component fibers, this can be achieved<br>
while still accomplishing a sufficiently high strength media for handling installation in<br>
crankcase ventilation filters. Also, the bi-component fibers are binder fibers.<br>
The bi-component fibers generally comprise two polymeric components<br>
formed together, as the fiber. Various combinations of polymers for the bi-component<br>
fiber may be useful, but it is important that the first polymer component melt at a<br>
temperature lower than the melting temperature of the second polymer component and<br>
typically below 205°C. Further, the bi-component fibers are integrally mixed and evenly<br>
dispersed with the other fibers, in forming the wet laid media. Melting of the first polymer<br>
component of the bi-component fiber is necessary to allow the bi-component fibers to<br>
form a tacky skeletal structure, which upon cooling, captures and binds many of the other<br>
fibers, as well as other bi-component fibers.<br>
Although alternatives are possible, typically the bi-component fibers will<br>
be formed in a sheath core form, with a sheath comprising the lower melting point<br>
polymer and the core forming the higher melting point.<br>
In the sheath-core structure, the low melting point (e.g., about 80 to 205°C)<br>
thermoplastic is typically extruded around a fiber of the higher melting point material<br>
(e.g., about 120 to 260°C). In use, the bi-component fibers typically have a average largest<br>
cross-sectional dimension (average fiber diameter if round) of about 5 to 50 micrometer<br>
often about 10 to 20 micrometer and typically in a fiber form generally have an average<br>
length of at least 1 mm, and not greater than 30 mm, usually no more than 20 mm,<br>
typically 1-10 mm. By "largest" in this context, reference is meant to the thickest cross-<br>
section dimension of the fibers.<br>
Such fibers can be made from a variety of thermoplastic materials including<br>
polyolefin's (such as polyethylene's, polypropylenes), polyesters (such as polyethylene<br>
terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, PCT), nylons including nylon 6, nylon 6, 6,<br>
nylon 6, 12, etc. Any thermoplastic that can have an appropriate melting point can be used<br>
in the low melting component of the bi-component fiber while higher melting polymers<br>
can be used in the higher melting "core" portion of the fiber. The cross-sectional structure<br>
of such fibers can be a "side-by-side" or "sheath-core" structure or other structures that<br>
provide the same thermal bonding function. One could also use lobed fibers where the<br>
tips have lower melting point polymer. The value of the bi-component fiber is that the<br>
relatively low molecular weight resin can melt under sheet, media, or filter forming<br>
conditions to act to bind the bi-component fiber, and other fibers present in the sheet,<br>
media, or filter making material into a mechanically stable sheet, media, or filter.<br>
Typically, the polymers of the bi-component (core/shell or sheath and side-<br>
by- side) fibers are made up of different thermoplastic materials, such as for example,<br>
polyolefin/polyester (sheath/core) bi-component fibers whereby the polyolefin, e.g.<br>
polyethylene sheath, melts at a temperature lower than the core, e.g. polyester. Typical<br>
thermoplastic polymers include polyolefins, e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
polybutylene, and copolymers thereof, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyesters, e.g.<br>
polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride acetate, polyvinyl<br>
butyral, acrylic resins, e.g. polyacrylate, and polymethylacrylate, polymethylmethacrylate,<br>
polyamides, namely nylon, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polystyrene,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, polyurethanes, cellulosic resins, namely cellulosic nitrate, cellulosic<br>
acetate, cellulosic acetate butyrate, ethyl cellulose, etc., copolymers of any of the above<br>
materials, e.g. ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers,<br>
styrene-butadiene block copolymers, Kraton rubbers and the like. Particularly preferred in<br>
the present invention is a bi-component fiber known as 27IP available from DuPont.<br>
Others fibers include FIT 201, Kuraray N720 and the Nichimen 4080 and similar<br>
materials. All of these demonstrate the characteristics of cross-linking the sheath polymer<br>
upon completion of first melt. This is important for liquid applications where the<br>
application temperature is typically above the sheath melt temperature. If the sheath does<br>
not fully crystallize then the sheath polymer will remelt in application and coat or damage<br>
downstream equipment and components.<br>
An example of a useable bi-component (binder) fiber for forming wet laid<br>
media sheets for use in CCV media is Dupont polyester bi-component 271P, typically cut<br>
to a length of about 6 mm.<br>
2. The Secondary Fiber Materials.<br>
The bi-component fibers provide a matrix for the crankcase ventilation<br>
filter media. The additional fibers or secondary fibers, sufficiently fill the matrix to<br>
provide the desirable properties for coalescing and efficiency.<br>
The secondary fibers can be polymeric fibers, glass fibers, metal fibers,<br>
ceramic fibers or a mixture of any of these. Typically glass fibers, polymeric fibers or a<br>
mixture are used.<br>
Glass fibers useable in filter media of the present invention include glass<br>
types known by the designations: A, C, D, E, Zero Boron E, ECR, AR, R, S, S-2, N, and<br>
the like, and generally, any glass that can be made into fibers either by drawing processes<br>
used for making reinforcement fibers or spinning processes used for making thermal<br>
insulation fibers.<br>
Non-woven media of the invention can contain secondary fibers made from<br>
a number of both hydrophilic, hydrophobic, oleophilic, and oleophobic fibers. These<br>
fibers cooperate with the glass fiber and the bi-component fiber to form a mechanically<br>
stable, but strong, permeable filtration media that can withstand the mechanical stress of<br>
the passage of fluid materials and can maintain the loading of particulate during use.<br>
Secondary fibers are typically monocomponent fibers with average largest cross-sectional<br>
dimension (diameters if round) that can range from about 0.1 on up, typically 1 micron or<br>
greater, often 8-15 microns and can be made from a variety of materials including<br>
naturally occurring cotton, linen, wool, various cellulosic and proteinaceous natural fibers,<br>
synthetic fibers including rayon, acrylic, aramide, nylon, polyolefin, polyester fibers. One<br>
type of secondary fiber is a binder fiber that cooperates with other components to bind the<br>
materials into a sheet. Another type of secondary fiber is a structural fiber that cooperates<br>
with other components to increase the tensile and burst strength the materials in dry and<br>
wet conditions. Additionally, the binder fiber can include fibers made from such polymers<br>
as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol. Secondary fibers can also include inorganic<br>
fibers such as carbon/graphite fiber, metal fiber, ceramic fiber and combinations thereof.<br>
The secondary thermoplastic fibers include, but are not limited to, polyester<br>
fibers, polyamide fibers, polypropylene fibers, copolyetherester fibers, polyethylene<br>
terephthalate fibers, polybutylene terephthalate fibers, polyetherketoneketone (PEKK)<br>
fibers, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) fibers, liquid crystalline polymer (LCP) fibers, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Polyamide fibers include, but are not limited to, nylon 6, 66, 11, 12, 612,<br>
and high temperature "nylons" (such as nylon 46) including cellulosic fibers, polyvinyl<br>
acetate, polyvinyl alcohol fibers (including various hydrolysis of polyvinyl alcohol such as<br>
88% hydrolyzed, 95% hydrolyzed, 98% hydrolyzed and 99.5% hydrolyzed polymers),<br>
cotton, viscose rayon, thermoplastic such as polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, etc.,<br>
polyvinyl acetate, polylactic acid, and other common fiber types.<br>
Mixtures of the fibers can be used, to obtain certain desired efficiencies and<br>
other parameters.<br>
The sheet media of the invention are typically made using papermaking<br>
processes. Such wet laid processes are particularly useful and many of the fiber<br>
components are designed for aqueous dispersion processing. However, the media of the<br>
invention can be made by air laid processes that use similar components adapted for air<br>
laid processing. The machines used in wet laid sheet making include hand laid sheet<br>
equipment, Fourdrinier papermaking machines, cylindrical papermaking machines,<br>
inclined papermaking machines, combination papermaking machines and other machines<br>
that can take a properly mixed paper, form a layer or layers of the furnish components,<br>
remove the fluid aqueous components to form a wet sheet. A fiber slurry containing the<br>
materials are typically mixed to form a relatively uniform fiber slurry. The fiber slurry is<br>
then subjected to a wet laid papermaking process. Once the slurry is formed into a wet<br>
laid sheet, the wet laid sheet can then be dried, cured or otherwise processed to form a dry<br>
permeable, but real sheet, media, or filter. For a commercial scale process, the bi-<br>
component mats of the invention are generally processed through the use of papermaking-<br>
type machines such as commercially available Fourdrinier, wire cylinder, Stevens Former,<br>
Roto Former, Inver Former, Venti Former, and inclined Delta Former machines.<br>
Preferably, an inclined Delta Former machine is utilized. A bi-component mat of the<br>
invention can be prepared by forming pulp and glass fiber slurries and combining the<br>
slurries in mixing tanks, for example. The amount of water used in the process may vary<br>
depending upon the size of the equipment used. The furnish may be passed into a<br>
conventional head box where it is dewatered and deposited onto a moving wire screen<br>
where it is dewatered by suction or vacuum to form a non-woven bi-component web.<br>
The binder in the bi-component fibers is activated by passing the matt<br>
through a heating step. The resulting material can then be collected in a large roll if<br>
desired.<br>
3. Surface Treatments of the Fibers.<br>
Modification of the surface characters of the fibers, increase in the contact<br>
angle, can enhance drainage capability of filtration media and thus the formed elements of<br>
the filter (with respect to pressure drop and mass efficiency). A method of modifying the<br>
surface of the fibers is to apply a surface treatment such as a flourochemical or silicone<br>
containing material, typically up to 5% by weight of the media.<br>
The surface treatment agent can be applied during manufacture of the<br>
fibers, during manufacture of the media or after manufacture of the media post-treatment,<br>
or after provision of the media pack. Numerous treatment materials are available such as<br>
flourochemicals or silicone containing chemicals that increase contact angle. An example<br>
is the DuPont ZonylTM flourochemicals, such as #7040 or #8195.<br>
IV. General Comments and Observations<br>
Herein, a variety of techniques, features and components, useable for<br>
crankcase ventilation filtration, are described. There is no specific requirement that an<br>
apparatus or technique involved use all of the features and techniques specifics<br>
characterized, in order to obtain some benefit of the teachings of the present disclosure.<br>
In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to a provision of a filter<br>
cartridge for use in separating hydrophobic aerosol phase from the gas stream, and to filter<br>
the gas stream. The filter cartridge generally comprises a media pack and a first end piece<br>
adjacent the media pack. The media pack includes filtration media surrounding an open<br>
interior and including first and second opposite ends. The first end piece is positioned<br>
adjacent the first end of the media pack, and has a first, outer, surface on an opposite side<br>
of the first end piece from the media pack. The first end piece includes a perimeter<br>
housing seal arrangement thereon, for example an o-ring seal. The first end piece includes<br>
a central flow aperture arrangement projecting therethrough, into flow communication<br>
with the open interior of the media pack. The first end piece also includes a non-circular<br>
projection surrounding the central flow aperture arrangement. The non-circular projection<br>
is positioned to project from an opposite side of the first end piece from the media pack.<br>
The direction of extension is thus generally in a direction axially opposite the media pack.<br>
By "axially opposite" in this context, it is meant in a direction generally in the same<br>
direction as a central axis of the media pack extending through the open interior, but in a<br>
direction away from the media pack. When it is said that the piece extends in a direction<br>
"'axially opposite the media pack," it is not meant that the non-circular projection extends<br>
necessarily precisely parallel to the central axis of the media pack.<br>
The non-circular projection is spaced inward from an outer perimeter or<br>
perimeter rim of the end piece.<br>
In general, the "non-circular projection" generally has a radially<br>
asymmetric shape. By the term "radially asymmetric" and variants thereof, in this context,<br>
it is meant if rotated around a central axis, the projection shape is such that it will only<br>
align with itself after a complete (i.e., 360°) rotation.<br>
Typically the non-circular projection includes an outer perimeter with first<br>
straight side portion and an opposite curved side portion. An example is shown in which<br>
the non-circular projection comprises a D-shaped outer perimeter.<br>
Typically, the non-circular projection is non-continuous and includes a<br>
liquid drain gap arrangement extending through a sidewall thereof. In an example shown,<br>
the drain gap arrangement comprises a gap in the first straight side portion of the non-<br>
circular projection, opposite the curved side portion.<br>
In accord with principles described herein, the cartridge may include a<br>
handle member positioned on the first end piece and projecting in a direction away from<br>
the media pack. The handle member is typically non-collapsible, i.e., does not fold or<br>
collapse in use, but rather remains projecting from the first end piece. The direction of<br>
projection is generally axially away from the media pack, although extension precisely<br>
parallel to a central axis is not intended to be meant by this.<br>
The handle member includes a bridge section forming a handle opening<br>
thereunder, allowing a portion of a person's hand to pass through the handle member<br>
under the bridge section, between the bridge section and adjacent portion the first end<br>
piece (i.e., between the bridge section and media pack). The handle member is typically a<br>
perimeter handle member positioned adjacent an outer perimeter of the first end piece.<br>
Typically, the handle member is oriented with a handle opening aligned<br>
with, and directed toward, a first straight side portion of the non-circular projection, when<br>
a D-shaped or other non-circular projection with a straight side portion is present.<br>
In a typical arrangement, the first end piece includes a peripheral rim<br>
projection extending in a direction away from the media pack. The peripheral rim<br>
projection surrounds a recessed surface portion of the first end piece; the recessed surface<br>
portion extending between the peripheral rim projection and the non-circular portion<br>
surrounding the central flow aperture arrangement.<br>
The peripheral rim projection typically includes an outer surface with an o-<br>
ring retaining groove therein; and, the cartridge includes an o-ring mounted in the<br>
retaining groove, as a housing seal arrangement.<br>
Typically, the first end piece includes a portion of a cartridge-to-housing<br>
base (or housing base-to-cartridge) rotational alignment indexing arrangement thereon.<br>
This portion includes a first radial projection spaced from a locator shoulder to define a<br>
first locator gap or receiver space therebetween.<br>
A typical cartridge-to-housing base (or housing base-to-cartridge) rotational<br>
alignment indexing arrangement includes a pair of locator gaps or receiver spaces<br>
(receivers), each defined by radial projection and a locator shoulder. The locator gaps or<br>
receivers are typically spaced, radially, on center, by a radial amount of less than 180°.<br>
Also typically radial projections used to define the locator gaps (receiver(s)) include a pair<br>
of projections spaced by a smallest radial amount on center, of less than 180°.<br>
The cartridge typically includes a second end piece positioned spaced from<br>
the first end piece with the media pack positioned therebetween. The second end piece<br>
and the first end piece are typically positioned on opposite ends of a central, tubular,<br>
media support that extends through the open interior of the media pack. The first end<br>
piece, the second end piece and the tubular support may comprise portions of an integral<br>
molded support piece, such as a plastic piece.<br>
The second end piece can include the closed central aperture overlapping<br>
and closing the end of the open interior of the media pack; and, an outer perimeter section<br>
comprising a plurality of spaced projections and a plurality of drain regions between the<br>
spaced projections. The drain regions would be positioned at least in part in direct drain<br>
overlap with an end in the media pack, at a location adjacent the second end piece. This<br>
provides for a bottom drain arrangement for the cartridge, in use.<br>
Also according to the present disclosure, a crankcase ventilation filter<br>
assembly is provided. This assembly may include a cartridge, as previously characterized.<br>
In general terms, the crankcase ventilation filter assembly includes a<br>
housing defining an interior including a housing base and a removable access cover. The<br>
housing generally includes a gas flow inlet arrangement, a gas flow outlet arrangement<br>
and a drain arrangement. Each of the inlet arrangement, outlet arrangement and drain<br>
arrangement can be positioned in the housing base.<br>
The housing further includes a first rotational indexing alignment<br>
arrangement. The first rotational alignment indexing arrangement generally comprises a<br>
cartridge-to-housing base (or housing base-to-cartridge) rotational alignment indexing<br>
arrangement.<br>
When the cartridge-to-housing base rotational alignment indexing<br>
arrangement is present, the housing base includes a first member of the rotational indexing<br>
alignment arrangement and the serviceable filter cartridge includes a second member of<br>
the rotational indexing alignment arrangement. The two members are oriented to engage<br>
one another, only when the cartridge in a single, selected, rotational orientation within and<br>
relative to the housing base, allowing the cartridge to be installed in only the selected<br>
rotation orientation.<br>
As an example, the cartridge can include a media pack and a first end piece<br>
adjacent a first end of the media pack. The first end piece can include a perimeter housing<br>
seal arrangement sealed to a portion of the housing base, and a member of a cartridge-to-<br>
housing base rotational indexing arrangement for engagement with a second member of<br>
the cartridge-to-housing base rotational indexing arrangement on the housing base. Again<br>
the arrangement should be such as to require the cartridge to be at a single selected<br>
rotational orientation relative to the housing base, when installed.<br>
An example cartridge-to-housing base rotational alignment indexing<br>
arrangement is described which includes at least a first projecting tab, and typically a pair<br>
of tabs, on the housing base; and, at least a receiver space, and typically two receiver<br>
spacers, formed on the first end piece of the filter cartridge, each receiver space being<br>
positioned to receive, therein, a single projection on the housing base only when the<br>
cartridge is in the selected, single, rotational orientation relative to the housing base.<br>
Typically, the configuration of the projecting tab(s) and the receiver<br>
space(s) is such that the cartridge cannot be fully nested within the housing base, unless<br>
the single, selected, rotational orientation between the two is obtained.<br>
In general terms, a crankcase ventilation filter assembly as described<br>
includes an access cover which includes a first member of a second (access cover portion-<br>
to-cartridge or cartridge-to-access cover portion) rotational alignment indexing alignment<br>
arrangement. When the cartridge-to-access cover portion rotational alignment indexing<br>
alignment arrangement is present, the access cover includes a first member and the<br>
cartridge includes a second member, the first and second members only being engageable<br>
when a single, selected, rotational orientation is obtained for the access cover portion to<br>
the filter cartridge. In an example, the first member comprises a non-circular projection<br>
on the access cover, and the second member comprises a non-circular projection on the<br>
first end piece of the cartridge; the two non-circular projections only being engageable in a<br>
single, rotational, orientation. In an example described, each non-circular projection has a<br>
"D" shaped perimeter definition, comprising a first straight side and a second, opposite,<br>
curved side. In a typical arrangement, a non-circular projection on the cartridge is sized to<br>
receive, projecting therein, a non-circular projection on the access cover.<br>
Typically the non-circular projection on a cartridge includes a liquid flow<br>
gap arrangement therethrough, and is oriented surrounding an open aperture in the first<br>
end piece.<br>
In an example shown, surface-to-surface contact between the non-circular<br>
projection on the cartridge and the non-circular projection on the access cover is provided,<br>
to inhibit air flow therebetween. In general terms, the surface-to-surface contact, provides<br>
for a gas flow inhibiting arrangement, which inhibits gas flow between the projection on<br>
the cartridge and the projection on the access cover portion, in operation.<br>
In the example arrangement described, the access cover comprises a cover<br>
assembly with a regulator valve assembly therein, oriented to regulate gas flow into a<br>
central flow aperture of the first end piece. The access cover assembly shown, comprises<br>
a cover member and a lower basket member. The regulation valve assembly includes a<br>
rolling diaphragm as a valve member positioned between the lower basket member and the<br>
cover member.<br>
For an example described, the cover member of the access cover assembly<br>
includes a rim member and a cap member, the rim member having a central aperture<br>
therethrough and the cap member including a snap-fit projection arrangement projecting<br>
through the central aperture of the rim member and into snap-fit engagement with the<br>
lower basket member, when the access cover assembly is assembled. When assembled,<br>
the rim member, for the example shown, is typically rotatable relative to the gap member<br>
and the lower basket member.<br>
In an example arrangement described herein, the access cover assembly<br>
includes a third (cap member-to-basket member or basket member-to-cap member)<br>
rotational alignment indexing arrangement thereon. This arrangement provides for only a<br>
single, selected, rotational alignment between the cap member and the lower basket<br>
member, when the access cover assembly is assembled. This cartridge rotational<br>
alignment indexing arrangement is shown as comprising for example a projection/receiver<br>
arrangement including at least one, and typically more than one, projection in the cap<br>
member engageable with a receiver (typically multiple receivers) on the lower basket<br>
member only when the cap member and lower basket member are rotationally aligned<br>
correctly in a single, selected, rotational orientation, during assembly.<br>
For the example shown, the cap member-to-basket member rotational<br>
alignment indexing arrangement includes: snap-fit projections on the cap member<br>
engageable with a rim end portion of the basket member having flanges thereon oriented<br>
between selected snap-fit projections; and, a pair of projections on the cap member<br>
received within a pair of cylindrical receivers on the lower basket member. Alternatives<br>
are possible.<br>
It is also characterized herein that a crankcase ventilation filter assembly is<br>
provided includes a housing defining an interior having a housing base and a removable<br>
access cover, the housing base including a gas flow inlet, a gas flow outlet and a liquid<br>
drain outlet; the access cover including a first member of a rotational indexing<br>
arrangement therein, which arrangement comprises a cartridge-to-access cover portion (or<br>
access cover portion-to-cartridge) rotational alignment indexing arrangement.<br>
The assembly would typically include a serviceable filter cartridge therein,<br>
with a media pack and a first end piece. The first end piece would include a second<br>
member of the cartridge-to-access cover portion rotational alignment indexing<br>
arrangement, requiring the selected portion of the access cover to be in a single selected<br>
rotational orientation relative to the cartridge, of the overall assembly configured for use.<br>
As an example, a D-shaped projection on the access cover is portion provided in<br>
engagement with a D-shaped projection on the cartridge, to provide for a single rotational<br>
orientation.<br>
In an example, a D-shaped projection on the access cover portion engages<br>
the D-shaped projection on the cartridge in a manner providing for gas flow inhibition<br>
therebetween, typically by surface-to-surface contact.<br>
In another aspect of the present disclosure, a crankcase ventilation filter<br>
assembly is provided comprising a housing defining an interior and including a housing<br>
base and a removable access cover. The housing base includes a gas flow inlet, a gas flow<br>
outlet and a liquid flow outlet. The housing base further includes a lower cylindrical<br>
portion having a first circular interior cross-section and an upper cylindrical portion of a<br>
second circular interior cross-section. The first circular interior cross-section is<br>
eccentrically aligned with the second interior cross-section. Typically the lower<br>
cylindrical portion includes an upper projection with the first seal surface and the upper<br>
cylindrical portion includes a threaded outer surface and an opposite, second, inner seal<br>
surface. The access cover is removably threaded onto the upper cylindrical portion with a<br>
seal member positioned between a portion of the access cover and the second, opposite,<br>
inner seal surface. The housing defines a gas/liquid flow gutter arrangement extending<br>
from a location adjacent the inlet at least partially around the housing base, the gas/liquid<br>
flow gutter arrangement being positioned between an upper flange of the lower cylindrical<br>
portion and the upper cylindrical portion. The gas/liquid flow gutter arrangement includes<br>
an upwardly directed ramp section.<br>
In this assembly, a serviceable filter cartridge for use in separating a<br>
hydrophobic liquid aerosol phase from a gas stream is perfectly positioned within the<br>
housing interior. The cartridge includes a media pack comprising filter media surrounding<br>
an open filter interior and including first and second opposite media ends and a first end<br>
piece adjacent the first end of the media pack, including a perimeter seal arrangement<br>
thereon and a central flow aperture arrangement therethrough. The perimeter housing seal<br>
arrangement is sealed to the first seal surface of the housing.<br>
In a typical embodiment, the filter cartridge includes a second end piece<br>
positioned spaced from the first end piece with the media pack positioned therebetween.<br>
The second end piece includes an outer perimeter section comprising a plurality of drain<br>
regions, each drain region being, at least in part, in direct drain overlap with the end of the<br>
media and the media pack at a location adjacent the second end piece.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present disclosure, a crankcase<br>
ventilation filter assembly is provided comprising a housing defining an interior and<br>
including a housing base and a removable access cover. The housing base includes a gas<br>
flow inlet, a gas flow outlet and a liquid drain outlet. The housing base includes an upper<br>
threaded end. The access cover comprises a cover assembly with a regulator valve<br>
assembly therein oriented to regulate gas flow valve into a central flow aperture of a first<br>
end piece of an installed cartridge. The access cover assembly includes a cover member<br>
and a lower basket member. Regulator valve assembly includes a diaphragm positioned<br>
between the cover member and the lower basket, when the cover member is secured to the<br>
lower basket.<br>
In an example described, the cover member comprises a rim member and a<br>
cap member. The rim member includes a central aperture therethrough and the cap<br>
member includes a snap-fit projection arrangement projecting through the central aperture<br>
and the rim member and into snap-fit engagement with a lower basket member. In this<br>
arrangement, the rim member is typically rotatable relative to the cap member and the<br>
lower basket member.<br>
Typically, a serviceable filter cartridge for use in separating a hydrophobic<br>
liquid aerosol phase from a gas stream is operably positioned in the housing interior. The<br>
cartridge includes a media pack comprising filter media surrounding an open filter interior<br>
including first and second opposite media ends and a first end piece adjacent the first end<br>
of the media pack including a perimeter housing seal arrangement thereon and a central<br>
flow aperture arrangement therethrough. The central flow aperture arrangement is in flow<br>
communication with the open filter interior. The perimeter housing seal arrangement is<br>
sealed to a portion of the housing base.<br>
