				<td>The present invention relates to an internal mixer for mixing petrochemical materials and other ingredients.<br>
Technical field<br>
This invention relates to high intensity mixing machines for elastomeric materials. A batch of ingredients including carbon black is fed into a hopper which has a ram weight connected to a piston rod for controlling movement of the materials into the mixer. The hopper is closed except when the ingredients are being located.<br>
Background Art<br>
Internal mixers of a 8.26 cubic feet (237 liter) size such as a that shown in US Patent 5,492,403 have been made and operated in rubber plants for many years. The mixer body has had a rectangular throat opening of 11.5 inches (29.21 cm) by 32 inches (81.28 cm), a piston cylinder with an 11 inch diameter (27.94 cm) for operation on 100 psi, (7.03 kg/sq cm), factory supplied air pressure providing an effective stock pressure of 27.2 psi (1.91 kg/sq cm). Mixing time, that is the time required to raise the temperature of the rubber mixture from ambient (room temperature ) of 80°F-90°F (27°C-32°C) to a discharge temperature of 350°F, (662°C) has been 3.5 to four minutes. Loading time has taken from one to several minutes.<br>
The mixer body has been replaced approximately every seven years because of wear in the throat area and inside the mixer body. Complete replacement of these 237 liter mixers with new larger mixers has not been feasible in older rubber plants because of the increased weight of the new mixers which would require extensive changes to the rubber plant. Also the cost of new mixers and other equipment for the larger size mixer is substantial. [$2,200,000 for a new 8.36 cubic foot (270 liter) mixer assembly].<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a modification of the present 8.36 cubic feet (237 liter) size internal mixer which does not require enlarging the size of the mixer body. By increasing the size of the throat of the mixer body, adding a new size ram weight and hopper and a new size piston-cylinder apparatus, substantial improvements in production and quality have been achieved. Also, by adding wear plates at the throat area, the time between replacements of the mixer body has been increased.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an internal mixer for mixing petrochemical materials and other ingredients comprising a mixer body, a mixing chamber in said body, a throat opening for charging said mixer, a discharge opening for discharging said mixer, a ram weight, a hopper and a piston-cylinder assembly for urging said ram<br><br>
weight into said throat opening and applying pressure to said petrochemical materials and said other ingredients in said mixing chamber, said mixing chamber having a volume not over 8.36 cubic feet (237 liters), characterized by said throat opening having an area of at least 576 square inches (3.715 sq. cm), said hopper having a cross sectional area of at least 576 square inches (3.715 sq. cm), and said ram weight having an area of at least 576 square inches (3.715 sq. cm).<br>
Accordingly, there is also provided a method of mixing a batch of petrochemical materials and other ingredients in an internal mixer having a mixing chamber with a volume of 8.36 cubic ft (237 liters), and a mixer body throat opening, a discharge opening, a feed hopper mounted on said mixer over said throat opening, a ram weight in said hopper connected to a piston rod of a piston-cylinder assembly mounted on said hopper comprising:<br>
a.	feeding said batch of petrochemical materials in the form of<br>
bales and said other ingredients into said hopper and through said<br>
throat opening ; characterized by:<br>
b.	moving said ram weight    into said throat opening with said<br>
throat opening having a width of 18 inches (45.72 cm) and a length of<br>
32 inches (81.28 cm) to provide an effective stock pressure of about 54<br>
psi (3.94 kg/sq cm) with a pressure in said piston cylinder assembly<br>
of about 79 psi (5.55 kg/sq cm);<br>
c.	mixing said batch at said effective stock pressure until the<br>
temperature is raised to a predetermined discharge temperature; and<br>
d.	discharging said batch from said mixing chamber through said<br>
discharge opening.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention there is provided: an internal mixer for mixing petrochemical materials and other ingredients to be vulcanized comprising a mixer body, a mixing chamber in the body, a throat opening for charging the mixer, a discharge opening for discharging the mixer, a ram weight, a hopper and a piston-cylinder assembly for urging the ram weight into the throat opening and applying pressure to the petrochemical materials and other ingredients in the mixing chamber characterized by the mixing chamber having a volume not over 8.36 cubic feet (237 liters), the throat opening having an area of at least 576 square inches (3,715 cm2), the hopper having a cross sectional area of at least 576 square inches and the ram having an area of at least 576 square inches (3,715cm2).<br>

Referring to Fig. 1, a prior art internal mixer assembly 10 is shown having a mixer body 12 with a mixing chamber 14 having a capacity of 8.36 cubic feet (237 liters). A door 16 (shown in the closed condition) is provided to close a discharge opening 18 in the mixer body 12. A throat 20 is provided in an upper wall 22 of the mixer body for receiving the ingredients to be mixed from a hopper 24 mounted on the upper wall 22 of the mixer body 12. A piston-cylinder assembly 26 is mounted on the hopper 24 with a piston 28 fastened to a piston rod 30 connected to a ram weight 32 located in the hopper 24.<br>
In this prior art internal mixer assembly 10 the throat 20 in the mixer body 12 has an opening having a width of 11 1/2 inches (29.21 cm) and a length of 32 inches (81.28 cm) or a total area of 368 square inches (2,373.65 sq cm). The ram weight 32 and the hopper 24 are of substantially the same size for movement of the ram weight into the throat 20 during operation of this internal mixer assembly 10.<br>
The piston-cylinder assembly 26 has an air inlet pipe 34 in communication with a supply of air pressure from the factory which may be 100 psi (7.03 kg/sq cm). The diameter of the piston 28 is 11 inches (27.94 cm) and is slidably mounted in a cylinder 36 of the piston-cylinder assembly 26. The cylinder 36 also has a diameter of 11 inches (27.94 cm).
