xne present invention relates to a process for preparing a subtilase variant.<br>
This invention relates to novel mutant enzymes or enzyme variants useful in formulating detergent compositions and ex¬hibiting improved storage stability while retaining or improving their wash performance; cleaning and detergent compositions containing said enzymes; mutated genes coding for the expression of said enzymes when inserted into a suitable host cell or organism; and such host cells transformed therewith and capable of expressing said enzyme variants.<br><br>
Cn the detergent industry enzymes have for more than 30 years seen implemented in washing formulations. Enzymes used in such formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, is well as other enzymes, or mixtures thereof. Commercially lost important are proteases.<br>
Though proteases have been used in the detergent industry for ore than 30 years, much remains unknown as to details of how hese enzymes interact with substrates and/other substances resent in e.g. detergent compositions. Some factors related to pecific residues and influencing certain properties, such as xidative and thermal stability in general have been lucidated, but much remains to be found out. Also, it is still ot exactly known which physical or chemical characteristics re responsible for a good washing performance or stability of protease in a specific detergent composition.<br>
 currently used proteases have for the most part been found  isolating proteases from nature and testing them in deter-int formulations.<br><br>
An increasing number of commercially used protease are protein engineered variants of the corresponding naturally occurring wildtype protease, e.g. DURAZYM" (Novo Nordisk A/.S), REIJVSE" (Novo Nordisk A/S) , MAXAPEM* (Gist-Brocades N. V. ) , PUI^AFECT' 5 (Genencor International, Inc.)-<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention, is to provide improved protein engineered protease variants, especially for use in the detergent industry.<br>
PROTEASES<br>
10 Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages i, ii protein substrates are classified as proteases, or (interch.uiqeably) peptidases (see Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. V/. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3) . fiacterj.a of the Ba.ci,lUis species secrete two extracellular species of protease,  a<br>
15 neutral, or metalloprotease, and an alkaline protease which is functionally a serine endopeptidase and visually referred to as subtilisin. Secretion of these proteases has been linked to the bacterial growth cycle, with greatest expression of protease during the stationary phase, when sporulation also occurs.<br>
0 Joliffe et al. (1980) J. Bacteriol 141 1199-1208, have suggested that Bacillus proteases function in cell wall turnover.<br>
SUBTILASES<br>
A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, and in which there is an essential serine residue at the active site (White, Handler and Smith, 1973 "Principles of Biochemistry," Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp. 271-272).<br>
The bacterial serine proteases have molecular weights in the 20,000 to 45,000 Daltons range. They are inhibited by diisoiaro-pylfluorophosphate. They hydrolyze simple terminal esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease. A more narrow term, alkcjl.ine pr-otease, covering a sub-group, reflects the high pH optimum of some! of<br><br>
the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11. o (for review, see Priest (1977) Bacteriological  Rev. 41 711-753).<br><br><br>
In the context of this application substrate should be interpreted in its broadest form as comprising a compound containing at least one peptide bond susceptible to hydrolysis by a subtilisin protease.<br>
Also the expression "product" should in the context ot: this invention be interpreted to include tho products of a hydrolysis reaction involving a subtilisin protease. A product may be the substrate in a subsequent hydrolysis reaction.<br>
One subgroup of the subtilases, I-Sl, comprise::-, the "classical" subtilisins, such as subtilisin 168, subtilisin EJPN' , subtilisin Carlsberg (ALCALASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/53) , and subtilisin DY.<br>
A further subgroup of the subtilases I-S2, is recognised by Siezen et al. (supra) . Sub-group I--S2 protea;-.es are described as highly alkaline subtilisins and comprise enzymes such as subtilisin PB92 (MAXACAL®, Gist-Eirocades NV) , subtilisin 309 (SAVINASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S), sul:)t i 1 is in 117 (ESPERASK*, NOVO NORDISK A/S), and alkaline elastase YaB.<br>
In the context of this invention, a subtilase variant or mutated subtilase means a subtilase that has been produced by an organism which is expressing a mutant gene derived from, a parent microorganism which possessed an original or parent gene and which produced a corresponding parent enzyme, the parent gene having been mutated in order to produce the mutant gene i from which said mutated subtilisin protease is produced when expressed in a suitable host.<br>
Random and site-directed mutations of the subtilase gene have both arisen from knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of the enzyme and contrUnited inlCrmation relating to  subtilase's  catalytic  activity,  substrate  specificity,<br><br><br>
Soc- Lond.A. 317 415-423; Hwang and Warshel (1987) Biochem. 26 2669-2673; Rao et al.. (1987) Nature 328 551-554.<br>
More recent publications covering this area are Carler et a1. (1989) Proteins 6 240-248 relating to design of variants that cleave a specific target sequence in a substrate (positions 24<br><br>
Especially site-directed mutagenesis of the subtilisin genes has attracted much attention, and various mutations are described in the following patent applications and patents:<br>
EP publ. no. 130756 (GENENTECH)(corresponding to US Reissue Patent No, 34,606 (GENENCOR)) relating to site specific or randomly generated mutations  in "carbonyl hydrolases"  and<br><br>
the filing of the application, and therefore evident to select, this application does not contribute much to solving the problem of deciding where to introduce mutations in order to obtain enzymes with desired properties.<br>
EP publ. no. 214435 (HENKEL) relating to cloning and expression<br><br><br>
In International patent publication No. WO 8 7/04 4 61 (AMGEN) it is proposed to reduce the number of Asn-Gly sequences present in the parent enzyme in order to obtain mutated enzymes exhibiting improved pH and heat stabilities, in the application emphasis is put on removing, mutating, or modifying the ^^'Asn and the ^^^Asn residues in subtilisin BPN' . Mo examples are provided for any deletions or for modifying the Gly-residues.<br>
International patent publication No. WO fr7/05050 (GENEX) discloses random mutation and subsequent screening of a Lai'ge number of mutants of subtilisin BPM' for impir)ved properties.<br><br>
In EP Publication no. 251 446 (GENENCOR) it .:i_s described how lomology considerations at both primary and tertiary structural levels may be applied to identify equivalent • amino acid residues whether conserved or not. This information together with the inventors knowledge of the tertiary structure of subtilisin BPN' lead the inventors to select a number of positions susceptible to mutation with an expectation of<br><br>
mutations are exemplified to support these suggestions, in addition to single mutations in these positions the inventors also performed a number of multiple mutations. Further the inventors identify  and amino acid<br>
residues within the segments 97-103, 126-129, 213-215, and 152-L72 as having interest, but mutations in any of these positions ire not exemplified.<br>
Ispecially of interest for the purpose of the present invention ;he inventors of EP 2 51 44 6 suggest to <br><br>
subtilisin BPN', type I-Sl), specifically they suggest to introduce Glu or Arg for the original Lys. It appears that the Glu variant was produced and it was found that it was highly susceptible to autolytic degradation (cf. pages 48, 121, 123 (Table XXI includes an obvious error, but indicates a reduction in autolysis halftime from 86 to 13 minutes) and Fig. 32).<br>
EP publ. no. 260105 (GENENCOR) describes modification of certain properties in enzymes containing a catalytic triad by selecting an amino acid residue within about 15 A from the catalytic triad and replace the sele,cted ammo acid residue ith another residue. Enzymes of the subtilase type desci-ibed Ln the present specification are specificaJ i.y mentioned as belonging to the class of enzymes cont:;sining a -'atalytic triad. In subtilisins positions 222 and 217 are indicated as preferred ositions for replacement.<br>
SO, it has been shown by Thomas, Russell, and Fersht (1985) ature 318 375-376 that exchange of '^Asp into '^Ser in ubtilisin BPN' changes the pH dependency of the enzyme.<br>
n a subsequent article (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 193 803-813, the ame authors also discuss the substitution of ^'"^Ser in place of Glu.<br>
oth these mutations are within a distance at about 15A from e active ^His.<br>
 Nature 328 496-500 (1987) Russel and Fersht discuss the sults of their experiments and present rules for changing pH-tivity profiles by mutating an enzyme to obtain changes in rface charge.<br>
 88/08028 (Genex) and WO 88/08033 (Amgen) both relate to edifications of amino acid residues in the calcium binding<br>
tes of subtilisin BPN'. The enzyme is said to be stabilized substituting more negatively charged residues for the<br>
iginal ones.<br><br>
In WO 89/06279 (NOVO NORDISK A/S) position 170 is indicated as interesting and it is suggested to replace the existing residue with Tyr. However, no data are given in respect of such a variant. In WO 91/00345 (NOVO NORDISK A/S) the same suggestion is made, and it is shown that the Tyr variant of position 170 in subtilisin 309 (type I-S2) exhibits an improved wash performance in detergents at a pH of about 8 (variant SCi03 in Tables III, IV, V, VI, VIII, X) ., The same substitution in combination with other substitutions in otlier positions also indicates an improved wash performance(S004, S011-S014, S022-S024, 8019, S020, S203, S225, S227 in the same Table and Table VII) all in accordance with the generic concept of said application.<br>
[n EP 525 610 Al (SOLVAY) it is suggested to improve the stability of the enzyme (a type I-S2 subtilase closely related o subtilisin PB92) towards ionic tensides by decreasing the ydrophobicity in certain surface regions thereof. It is onsequently suggested to substitute Gin for the Arg in osition 164 (170 if using BPN' numbering). No variants omprising this substitution are dlscloBed in the application.<br>
n WO 94/02618 (GIST-BROCADES N.V.) a numbc^r of position 164 170 if using BPN' numbering) variants oi: the I~S2 type ubtilisin PB92 are described. Examples are provided showing ubstitution of Met, Val, Tyr, lie, for the original Arg. Wash erformance testing in powder detergents of the variants ndicates a slight improvement. Especially for the lie variant ash performance tests on cacao an improvement of about 20-30%  indicated. No stability data are provided.<br>
 WO 95/30011, WO 95/30010, and WO 95/29979 (PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE MPANY) describe 6 regions, especially position 199-220 (BPN' mbering), in both Subtilisin BPN' and subtilisin 309, which e designed to change (i.e. decrease) the adsorbtion of the zyme to surface-bound soils. It ir. suggested that decreased sorbtion by an enzyme to a subst.rate results in better<br><br>
detergent cleaning performance. No specific detergent wash performance data are provided for the suggesjted variants.<br>
* WO 95/27049 (SOLVAY S.A.) descriebe a subtilisin 309 type protease with  following mutations:  N43R+N116R+N117R  (BPN^ 5 numbering. Data indicate the corresponding variant is having improved stability, compared to wildtype.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS OF SUBTILASES Proteases such as subtilisins have found much utility in industry, particularly in detergent formulations, as th«?y are 10 useful for removing proteinaceous stains.<br>
At present at least the following proteases are knoi^/n to be commercially available and many of them are marketed in large quantities in many countries of the v/orld.<br>
Subtilisin BPN' or Novo, available from e.g. CIGI'IA, St. Louis, 15 U.S.A.<br>
Subtilisin Carlsberg, marketed by NOVO NORDISK A/S (Denmark) as ALCALASE* and by Gist-Brocades N.V. (Holland) as MAXATASE';<br>
Both of these belong to subtilase subgroup I-fil<br>
Among the subtilase sub-group I-S2 the following are known to 0 be marketed.<br>
A Bacillus lentus subtilisin, subtilisin J09, marketed by NOVO NORDISK A/S (Denmark) as SAVINASE*. A protein engineered variant of this enzyme is marketed as DURAZYM*.<br>
Enzymes closely resembling SAVINASE", such as subtilisin PB92, MAXACAL* marketed by Gist-Brocades N.V. (a protein engineered variant of this enzyme is marketed as MAXAPEM") , OPTICLEAN" marketed by SOLVAY et Cie. and PURAFECT* marketed by GENENCOR International.<br><br>
A Bacillus lentus subtilisin, subtilisin 14 7, marketed by NOVO NORDISK A/S (Denmark) as ESPERASE*;<br>
To be effective, however, such enzymes must not only exhibit activity under washing conditions, but must also be compatible 5 with other detergent components during detergent production and storage.<br>
For example, subtilisins may be used in combination with other enzymes active against other substrates, and the selected subtilisin should possess stability towards such enzymes, and<br>
10 also the selected subtilisin preferably should not catalyze degradation of the other enzymes. Also, the c:hosen subtilisin should be resistant to the action from other components in the detergent formulation, such as bleaching agents, oxidizing agents, etc., in particular an enzyme to be ut;ed in a detergent<br>
15 formulation should be stable with respect to the oxirlizing power, calcium binding properties, and pH conditions rendered by the non-enzymatic components in the detergent during storage and in the wash liquor during wash.<br>
The ability of an enzyme to catalyze the degradation of various 20 naturally occurring substrates present on the objects to be cleaned during e.g. wash is often referred to as its washing ability, washability, detergency, or wash perfox-mance. Throughout this application the term wash performance will be used to encompass this property.<br>
25 The ability of an enzyme to remain active in the presence of other components of a detergent composition prior to being put to use (normally by adding water in tlie washing process) is usually referred to as storage stability or shelf life. It is often measured as half-life, t1/2. We will u,se the expression<br>
30 storage stability for this property tlirougliout: this application to encompass this property.<br>
Naturally occurring subtilisins have been found to possess properties which are highly variable in relation to their<br><br>
  variations in parameters such as pH. Several of the above marketed detergent proteases, indeed, have a better performance than those marketed about 2 0 years ago, but for optimal performance each enzyme has its own 5 specific conditions regarding formulation and wash conditions, e.g. pH, temperature, ionic strength ( = 1),, active system (tensides, surfactants, bleaching agent, etc.), builders, etc.<br>
As a consequence it is found that an enzyme possessing desirable properties at low pH and low I may be less attractive 10 at more alkaline conditions and high I, or an enzyme exhibiting fine properties at high pH and high I may be less attractive at low pH, low I conditions.<br>
Also, it has been found that the storage stability differs between the enzymes, but it has further been found that a<br>
15 specific enzyme exhibits large variations in storage stability in respect of different detergent formulations, dependent upon a number of parameters, such as pH, pi, bleach system, tensides, etc., and upon the physical state of the detergent compositions, which may be in powder, dust, or liquid Corm.<br>
20 Furthermore it may be concentrated or dilute.<br>
The advent and development of recombinant DHA techniques has had a profound influence in the field of protein chemistry.<br>
Through the application of this technology it is possible now to construct enzymes having desired amino acid sequences, and 25 as indicated above a fair amount of research has been devoted to designing subtilisins with altered properties.<br>
Among the proposals the technique of producing and screening a large number of mutated enzymes as described in EP publ. no. 130756 (GENENTECH) (US Reissue Patent No. 34,606 (GENENCOR)) 30 and International patent publ. no. WO B7/05050 (GENEX) correspond to a large extend to the classical method of isola¬ting native enzymes, submit them to classical mutagenesis programs (using radiation or chemical mutagen;;) and screen them<br><br><br>
for their properties. The difference lies in that these methods are more efficient through the knowledge of the presence of a large number of variant enzymes substituted in a specific position.<br>
5 A subtilisin enzyme typically comprises about: 275 amino acid residues. Each residue is capable of being 1 out of 2 0 possible naturally occurring amino acids.<br>
Therefore one very serious draw-back, in that procedure is the very large number of mutations generated that have to be 10 submitted to a number of preliminary screenings to determine their properties.<br>
A procedure as outlined in these patent applications will consequently only be slightly better than the traditional random mutation procedures which have been known for years.<br>
15 The other known techniques relate to changing specific properties, such as oxidation stability, thermal stability, Ca-stability, transesterification and hydrolysis rate (EP publ. no. 260105 (GENENCOR)), pH-activity profile (Thomas, Russell, and Fersht, supra), and substrate specificity (International<br>
20 patent publ. no. WO 88/07578 (GENENTECH) ) . None of these publications relates to changing either the wash performance of enzymes or their storage stability.<br>
In International Patent Application no. PCT/DK 88/00002 (NOVO NORDISK A/S) it is proposed to use the concept of homology 25 comparison to determine which amino acid positions should be selected for mutation and which amino acids should be substituted in these positions in order to obtain a desired change in wash performance.<br>
By using such a procedure the task, of screening is reduced<br>
30 drastically, since the nuraber of mutants generated is much<br>
smaller, but with that procedure it is only foreseen that<br><br>
enzymes exhibiting the combined useful properties of the parent enzyme and the enzyme used in the comparison may be obtained.<br>
Thus,  as  indicated  above  no  relationship  has  yet been identified between well defined properties ol: an enzyme such as 5 those mentioned above and the wasli performance and storage stability of an enzyme in various detergent: ('ompositions.<br>
The problem seems to be that although much research has been directed at revealing the mechanism of enzymsi activity, still only little is known about the factors in structure and amino 10 acid residue combination that determine the properties, such as storage stability in detergents, of enzymes in relation to most of their characteristics, especially when the enzymes are present in complex mixtures.<br>
Consequently there still exists a need for further improvement 15 and tailoring of enzymes to detergent systems, as well as a better understanding of the mechaniism of protease action and degradation in the practical use of cleaning or detergent compositions. Such an understanding c;ould result in rules which may be applied for selecting mutations that with a reasonable 20 degree of certainty will result in an enzyme exhibiting improved storage stability under specified conditions in a detergent composition.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that a subtilase variant 25 having improved storage stability and/or improved performance in detergents, can be obtained by substituting one or more amino acid residues situated in, or in the vicinity of a hydrophobic domain of the parent subtilase for an amino acid residue more hydrophobic than the original residue, said 30 hydrophobic domain comprising the residues corresponding to residues P129, P131, 1165, Y167, Y171 of BtS309 (in BASBPN numbering), and said residues in the vicinity thereof comprises residues corresponding to the residues E13 6, G159, S164, R170,<br><br><br>
A194,  and G195 of BLS309  (in BASBPN numbering), with the exception of the R170M, R170I and R170V variants of BABP92.<br>
The present invention relates consequently in its first aspect to  enzyrae  variants  exhibiting  improved  stability  and/or 5 improved wash performance in detergent.<br>
In its second aspect the invention relates to DNA constructs capable of expressing the enzymes of the first aspect, when inserted in a suitable manner into a host cell that subsequently is brought to express tfie subti. I. isin enzyme (s) of 10 the first aspect.<br>
In a third aspect the invention relates to tiie production of the subtilisin enzymes of the invention by inserting a DNA construct according to the second aspect into a suitable host, cultivating the host to express the desired subtilase enzyrae, 15 and recovering the enzyme product.<br>
The invention relates, in part, but is not limited to, mutants of the genes expressing the subtilase sub-group I-S2 enzymes and the ensuing enzyme variants, as indicated above. Other subtilase gene variants encompassed by the invention are 20 such as those of the subtilase subgroup I-Si, e.g. Subtilisin BPN', and Subtilisin Carlsberg genes and ensuing variant Subtilisin BPN', Proteinase K, and Subtilisin Carlsberg enzymes, which exhibit improved stability in concentrated liquid detergents.<br>
25 Still further subtilase gene variants encompassed by the invention are such as Proteinase K and other genes and ensuing variant Proteinase K, and other subtilase enzymes, which exhibit improved stability in concentrated liquid detergents.<br>
Other examples of parent subtilase enzymes thai; can be modified 30 in accordance with the invention are listed in Table I,<br><br>
Further the invention relates to the use of the mutant enzymes in cleaning compositions and cleaning compositions comprising the mutant enzymes, especially detergent compositions comprising the mutant subtilisin enzymes. Specifically the 5 invention relates to concentrated liquid detergent compositions comprising such enzyme variants.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
15 In the drawings, Fig. 1 shows an alignment of a number of the subtilases mentioned in Table T;<br>
Fig. 2 is a 3-dimensional representation of subtilisin 309 showing the location of the hydrophobic domain and some of the amino acid residues in the vicinity thereof to be substituted 20 according to the invention.<br>
DETMLED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the storage stability and/or improved performance in detergents of subtilases generally is improved when amino acid residues situated in, or 25 in the vicinity of a hydrophobic domain comprising the residues P129, P131, 1165, Y167, Y171 of subtilisin 309 are substituted for a more hydrophobic residue. The residue:;^ in question are especially E136, G159, S164, R170, A:i94, and i:;i95.<br><br>
Further, said variant exhibits a particulary high improved stability in liquid detergents and in detergents in a shaped solid form.<br>
Fig, 2 shows the hydrophobic domain in subtilisin 309 and 5 residues in the vicinity thereof a number of which are to be substituted in order to increase the hydropliobicity of the domain. This may be achieved by substituting hydrophobic residues for non-hydrophobic residues and/or by substituting residues to become even more hydrophobic than in the parent 10 enzyme.<br>
The same principle applies to the corresponding domain in other subtilases, the identification of v/hich is witliin the skills of the average person working in this technical field. Graphic representations like the one in Fig. 2 can be. produced for 15 other subtilases to determine the target residues to be substituted according to the invention.<br>
A number hereof is indicated in Table II below:<br><br><br>
20 Consequently the invention relates to subtilase variants in which the amino acid sequence has been changed through mutating the gene of the subtilisin enzyme, which it is desired to modify (the parent enzyme or gene), in the codon responsible for the expression of the amino acid residue in positions 129,<br>
25 131, 165, 167, 171, 136, 159, 164, 170, 194, and 195, which residues are more hydrophobic than the residue(s) in the parent enzyme, especially such hydrophobic residu(:;::; that comprise a relatively long hydrophobic side chain, siicli as lie, Leu, and<br><br>
Val, whereby, when the mutated gene is expressed, the amino acid residue is substituted by a more hydrophobic residue, which increases the hydrophobicity of the domain as such.<br>
Hydrophobic amino acid residues are generally the following: 5 Val (V), He (I),  Leu (L) , Met (M) , Phe (F) , Pro (P) and Trp(W). Among these Val, He and Leu are preferred.<br>
By looking at Table II and applying the principle of the invention a number of candidates for substitution becomes clear.<br>
For both BASBPN and BLSCAR it seems appropriate to make substitutions in positions 129, 131, 136, 159, 164, 167, 170, 171 and 195. In BLS309 positions 136, 164, 167, and 170, 171 would be the first choices, and positions 159 and 195 also would be a second choice. In BLS147 positions 129, 131,, 136, 167, 170, 171 and 195 are the first choice, while positions 159 and 164 are second. Finally, in TVTHER positions 129, 131, 136, 167, 171 and 194 are the first choices, with 164 as a second one.<br>
According to the invention it would entail an advantage to substitute the Gly residues in the hydrophobic domain to bulkier and more hydrophobic residues.<br>
Such considerations apply for any hydrophilic or hydrophobic residue that may occupy any of the above mentioned position, meaning that any increase in hydrophobicity seems to be advantageous. This means that e.g, a very hydrophilic residue such as the charged residues Arg (R) , Ar.p (D) , Glu (E) or Lys (K) may be substituted by any residue that is less hydrophilic. Such less hydrophilic residues comprises the residues Gly (G), Cys (C), Ser (S), Ala (A), Thr (T), Tyr (Y), Gin (Q), His (H) or Asn (N). It also means that a Tyr(y) may be substituted by a more hydrophobic residue such as Phe(F), Lou(L), or He (I)..<br><br>
Similar considerations can be applied to other sulstilases having a hydrophobic domain in this part of (he surface of the enzyme.<br>
In the context of this invention a subtilase is defined in accordance with Siezen et al. supra. In a more narrow sense, applicable to many embodiments of the invention, the subtilases of interest are those belonging to the subgroups I-Sl and I-S2. In a more specific sense, many of the embodiments of the invention relate to serine proteases of gram-posit:ive bacteria which can be brought into substantially unambiguous homology in their primary structure, with the subtilases listed in Table I above.<br>
The present invention also coniprLses any one or more substitutions in the above mentioned positions in combination with any other substitution, deletion or addition to the amino acid sequence of the parent enzyme. Especially combinations with other substitutions known to provide improved properties to the enzyme are envisaged.<br>
Such combinations comprise the positions: 222 (improve oxidation stability), 218 (improves thermal stability), substitutions in the Ca-binding sites stabilising the enzyme, e.g. position 76, and many other apparent from the prior art.<br>
Furthermore combinations with the variants mentioned in EP 4 05 901 are also contemplated specifically.<br>

Thus, the composition may contain in the aggregate for example from 1-50%, e.g. at least about 5% and often up to about 3 5-4 0% by weight, of one or more organic and/or inorganic builders. Typical examples o:l: builders include those already mentioned above, and more broadly include alkali metal ortho, pyro, and tripolyphosphates, alkali metal carbon¬ates, either alone or in admixture with calcite, alkali metal citrates, alkali metal nitrilotriacetates, carboxymethyloxysuc-cinates, zeolites, polyacetalcarboxylates, and so on.<br>

Optional cosurfactants for use with the above nonionic surfactants include amides of the formula<br><br>
wherein R^ is an alkyl,hydroxyalkyl or alkenyl radical containing from 8 to 20 carbon atoms, and R^ and R^ are selected 25 from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, 3-hydroxypropyl, and said radicals additionally containing up to 5 ethylene oxide units, provided at least one of R^ and R-^ contains a hydroxyl group.<br><br>

However, the amount of alkanolamine should be minimized for<br>
15 best chlorine bleach compatibility.<br>
In addition, the compositions contain sodium ions, and preferably potassium ions,at a level sufficient to neutralize the anionic species and provide the desired product pH.<br>
D.      Suds Suppressor<br>
20 Another optional component for use in the liquid detergents herein is from 0 to about 1.5%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 1.0%, by weight of silicone based suds suppressor agent. Silicones are widely known and taught for use as highly effective suds controlling agents. For example, U.S. Patent<br>
25 3,455,839 relates to compositions and processes for defoaming aqueous solutions by incorporating therein small amounts of polydimethylsiloxane fluids.<br>
Useful suds controlling silicones are mixtures of silicone and silanated silica as described, for instance, in German Patent 30 Application DOS 2,124,526.<br><br>
silicone defoamers and suds controlling agents have been successfully incorporated into granular detergent compositions by protecting them from detergent surfactants as in U.S. Patent 3,933,672, and in U.S. Patent 4,652,392.<br>
5 A preferred silicone based suds suppressor for use herein is a suds suppressing amount of a suds controlling agent consisting essentially of:<br>
(i) polydimethylsiloxane fluid having a viscosity of from about 20 cs. to about 1500 cs. at 25°C;<br>
10 (ii) from about 5 to about 50 parts per 100 parts by weight of (i) of siloxane resin composed of (CH^)^ ^^^1/2 units and SiOj units in a ratio of from (CHj).j SiO^^^ units and to SiOj units of from about 0.6:1 to about 1.2:1; and<br>
(iii)   from about 1 to about 20 parts per 100 parts by weight 15        of (i) of a solid silica gel.<br>
By "suds suppressing amount" is meant that t;he formulator of the composition can select an amount of this suds controlling agent that will control the suds to the extent desired. The amount of suds control will vary with the detergent surfactant 20 selected. For example, with high sudsing surfactants, relatively more of the suds controlling agent- is used to achieve the desired suds control than with low foaming surfactants.<br>

It was found that the subtilase variant.s of the present invention can also be usefully Incorporated in detergent composition in the form of bars, tablets, ;J1; Icks and the like for direct application to fabrics, Yiard sui:laces or any other surface. In particular, they can be Incorporated into soap or soap/synthetic compositions in bar form, wheirein they exhibit a remarkable enzyme stability. Detergent ccimposition in the form of bars, tablets, sticks and the like for direct application, are for example described in South African Patent 93/7274, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Accordingly,  the preferred  bars  in  accordance with this<br>
invention comprise, in addition to the subtilase variant:<br>
i)     25 to 80%, most preferably 25 to 70%, by weight of<br>

METHOD FOR PRODUCING MUTATIONS IN SU3TIIASE. GENES<br>
Many methods for introducing mutations into genes are well known in the art. After a brief discussion of cloning subtilase genes, methods for generating mutations in both random sites, and specific sites, within the subtilase gene will be discussed.<br><br>
CLONING A SUBTILASE GENE<br>
The gene encoding a subtilase may be cloned from any of the organisms indicated in Table I, especially gram-positive bacteria or fungus, by various methods, well known in the art.<br>
5 First a genomic, and/or cDNA library ot DNA miist be C9nr.tructed using chromosomal DNA or messenger RNA from the organism that produces the subtilase to be studied. Then, if the amino-acid sequence of the subtilase is known, homologouf?, labelled oligonucleotide probes may be syntliesized .iml used to identify<br>
3 subtilisin-encoding clones from a genomic library of bacterial DNA, or from a cDNA library. Alternatively, a labelled oligonucleotide probe containing sequences homologous to subtilase from another strain of bacteria or organism could be used as a probe to identify subtilase-encoding clones, using hybridization and washing conditions of lower stringency.<br>
Yet another method for identifying subtilase-producing clones would involve inserting fragments of genomic DNA into an expression vector, such as a plasmid, transforming protease-negative bacteria with the resulting genomic DNA library, and then plating the transformed bacteria onto agar containing a substrate for subtilase, such as skim milk. Those bacteria containing subtilase-bearing plasmid will produce colonies surrounded by a halo of clear agar, due to digestion of the skim milk by excreted subtilase.<br>
GENERATION OF RANDOM MUTATIONS IN THE SUBTII.A.SE GENE Once the subtilase gene has been cloned into a suitable vector, such as a plasmid, several methods can be used to introduce random mutations into the gene.<br>
One method would be to incorporate the clonecJ subtilase gene, as part of a retrievable vector, into a mutator strain of Eschericia coli.<br>
Another method would involve generating a sin<jle stranded form of the subtilase gene and then annealing fragment dna containing with another such></jle><br>
that a portion of the subtilase gene rernainod single stranded. This discrete, single stranded region could then be exposed to any of a number of mutagenizing agents, including, but not limited to, sodium bisulfite, hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, formic acid, or hydralazine. A specific example of this method for generating random mutations is described by Shortle and<br>
Nathans (1978, Proc. Natl. Acad.	Sci. U.S.A..75 217 0-2174).<br>
According to the shortle and Nathans method, the plasmid bearing the subtilase gene would be nicked by a restriction enzyme that cleaves within the gene. This nick would be widened into a gap using the exonuclease action of DNA polymerase I. The resulting single-stranded gap could then be mutagenized using any one of the above mentioned mutagenizing agents.<br>
Alternatively, the subtilisin gene from a 13acillus species including the natural promoter and other control sequences could be cloned into a plasmid vector containing replicons for both E. coli and B. subtilis, a selectable phenotypic marker and the M13 origin of replication for production of single-stranded plasmid DNA upon superinfection with helper phage IRl. Single-stranded plasmid DNA containing the cloned subtilisin gene is isolated and annealed with a DNA fragment containing vector sequences but not the coding region of subtilisin, resulting in a gapped duplex molecule. Mutations are introduced into the subtilisin gene either with sodium bisulfite, nitrous acid or formic acid or by replication in a mutator strain of E_^ coli as described above.. Since sodium bisulfite reacts exclusively with cytosine in a single-stranded DNA, the mutations created with this mutagen are restricted only to the coding regions. Reaction time and bisulfite concentration are varied in different experiments such that from one to five mutations are created per subtilisin gene on average. Incubation of 10 j^g of gapped duplex DNA in 4 M Na-bisulfite, pH. 6.0, for 9 minutes at 37 °C in a reaction volume of 4 00 ^.1,<br>
deaminates about 1% of cytosines in the single	stranded region.<br>
The coding region of mature subtilisin contains about 200 cytosines, depending on the DNA strand. Advantageously, the reaction time is varied from about 4 niiriutos (to produce a<br><br>
3<br>
mutation frequency of about one in 200) to about 20 minutes (about 5 in 200).<br>
After mutagenesis the gapped molecules are treated in vitro with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) to make fully double-stranded molecules and fix the mutations. Competent E. coli are then transformed with the mutagenized DNA to produce an amplified library of mutant subtilisins. Amplified mutant libraries can also be made by growing the plasraid DNA in a Mut D strain of E. coli which increases the range of mutations due to its error prone DNA polymerase.<br>
The mutagens nitrous acid and formic acid may also be used to<br>
jroduce mutant libraries. Because these chemicals are not as<br>
specific for single-stranded DNA as sodium bisulfite, the<br>
lutagenesis reactions are performed ivccordiiig to the following<br>
)rocedure. The coding portion of tiie subtil isin gene is cloned<br>
.n M13 phage by standard methods and single stranded phage DNA<br>
)repared. The single-stranded DNA is then reacted with 1 M<br>
litrous acid pH. 4.3 for 15-60 minutes at 23°C or 2.4 M formic<br>
cid for 1-5 minutes at 23°C. These ranges of reaction times<br>
reduce a mutation frequency of from 1 in 1000 to 5 in 1000.<br>
fter mutagenesis, a universal primer is annealed to the M13<br>
NA and duplex DNA is synthesized using the mutagenized single-<br>
tranded DNA as a template so that the coding portion of the<br>
ubtilisin gene becomes fully double-strancJed. At t-his point<br>
he coding region can be cut out of the M13 vector with<br>

SNERATION OF SITE DIRECTED MUTATIONS IN THE SUBTILASE GENE ice the subtilase gene has been cloned, and desirable sites 3r mutation identified and the residue to L.ubstitute for the riginal ones have been decided, these mutations can be itroduced using synthetic oligonucleotides. These oligonucleo-.des  contain  nucleotide  sequences  flanking  the  desired<br><br>
mutation sites; mutant nucleotides are inserted during oligo¬nucleotide synthesis. In a preferred method, a single stranded gap of DNA, bridging the subtilase gene, is created in a vector bearing the subtilase gene. Then the synthetic nucleotide, bearing the desired mutation, is annealed to a homologous portion of the single-stranded DNA. The remaining gap is then filled in by DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) and the construct is ligated using T4 ligase, A specific example of this method is described in Morinaqa eL..al..,., (1984, Biotech-nology 2 646-639). According to Moiinaga .et: .a.L^, a fragment within the gene is removed using restriction ondonuclease. The vector/gene, now containing a gaj:), is then denatured and hybridized to a vector/gene which, instead of: c'ontaininc) a gap, has been cleaved with another restriction endonuclease at a site outside the area involved in tlie gap. A single-stranded region of the gene is then available for hybridization with mutated oligonucleotides, the remaining gap is filled in by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, the insertions are ligated with T4 DNA ligase, and, after one cycle of replication, a double-stranded plasmid bearing the desired mutation is produced. The Morinaga method obviates the additional manipulation of constructing new restriction sites, and therefore facilitates the generation of mutations at multiple sites. U.S. Reissue Patent number Ji4,606 by Estell et al. , issued May 10, 1994, is able to int,reduce oligonucleotides bearing multiple mutations by performing minor alterations of the cassette, however, an even greater variety of mutations can be introduced at any one time by the Morinaga method, because a multitude of oligonucleotides, of various lengths, can be introduced.<br>
EXPRESSION OF SUBTILASE MUTANTS<br>
According to the invention, a mutated subtilase gene prodviced by methods described above, or any alternativG methods knoun in the art, can be expressed, in enzyme form, using an expr-esiision vector. An expression vector genei.-ally falJ.s under the Jefinition of a cloning vector, since an expression vector usually includes the components of a typical cloning vector,<br><br>
namely, an element that permits autonomous replication of the vector in a microorganism independent of the genome of the microorganism, and one or more phenotypic markers for selection purposes. An expression vector includes control sequences 5 encoding a promoter, operator, ribosome binding site, trans¬lation initiation signal, and, optionally, a repressor gene or various activator genes. To permit the secretion of the ex¬pressed protein, nucleotides encoding a "signal sequence" may be inserted prior to the coding sequence ol; the gene. For ex-<br>
10 pression under the direction of ccmtrol. secjuences, a target gene to be treated according to the i.nvi.Mitian i^ operably linked to the control sequences in the proper reading frame. Promoter sequences that can be incorporated into plasmid vec¬tors, and which can support the transcription of the mutant<br>
15 subtilase gene, include but are not limited to the prokaryotlc B-lactamase promoter (Villa-Kamarof i;, e,t:_iy,. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75 3727-3731) and the tac promoter (DeBoer, et al. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80 21-25). Further references can also be found in "Useful proteins from recombi-<br>
20 nant bacteria" in Scientific American (1980) 242 74-94.<br>
According to one embodiment B. subtil is is transformed by an expression vector carrying the mutated DNA. If expression is to take place in a secreting microorganism such as B. subtj.lis a signal sequence may follow the tranfilat Lou initiation signal 25 and precede the DNA sequence of interest. The signal sequence acts to transport the expression product to the cell wall where it is cleaved from the product upon secretion. The term "control sequences" as defined above is intended to include a signal sequence, when it is present.<br>
30 Other host systems known to the skilled person are also contemplated for the expression and production of the protease variants of the invention. Such host system'-; comprise fungi, including filamentous fungi, plant, avian and mammalian i;:ells, as well as others.<br><br><br>
strains;<br>
B. subtilis 309 and 147 are variants of Bacillus	lentus^<br>
deposited with the NCIB and accorded the accession numbers NCIB 5 10309 and 10147,  and described in US Patent No.  3,723,250 incorporated by reference herein.<br>
E. coli MC 1000 (M.J. Casadaban and S.N. Cohen (1980); J. Mol. Biol. 138 179-207), was made r',iii* by conventional methods and is also described in US Patent Application Serial No. 039,298.<br>
10 Proteolytic Activity<br>
In the context of this invention proteolytic activity is expressed in Kilo NOVO Protease Units (KNPii) . The activity is determined relatively to an enzyme standard (SAVINASE'") , and the determination is based on the digestion of a dimethyl<br>
15 casein (DMC) solution by the proteolytic enzyme at standard conditions, i.e. 50 °C, pH 8.3, 9 min. reaction time, 3 min. measuring time. A folder AF 220/1 is available upon request to Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference.<br>
20 A GU is a Glycine Unit, defined as the proteolytic enzyme activity which, under standard conditions, during a 15-minutes' incubation at 40 deg C, with N-acetyl casein as substrate, produces an amount of NH2-group equivalent to 1 /umole of glycine.<br>
25 Enzyme activity can also be measured using the PNA assay, according to reaction with the soluble substrate succinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-phenyl-alanine-para-nitrophenol, which is described in the Journal of American Oil Chemists Society, Rothgeb, T.M., Goodlander, B.D., Garrison, P.H., and Smith,<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Construction and Expression of <br>
15 A vector suited to a synthetic gene coding i.ar subtilase 309 and its mutants was constructed. It is essentially a pUC19 plasmid [Yanish-Perron and Messing (1985) Gene; 33 103-119], in which the multiple cloning site has been replaced by a linker containing the restriction sites used to seprirate five sub--<br>
20 fragments constituting the.gene. The new linker was inserted into EcoRI - Hindlll cut pUC19 thereby destroying these sites. The details of this construction are described in WO 92/19729 on pages 25-26 and in figure 1 (sheets 1/7-7/7) thereof, the content of which is hereby included by reference.<br>
25 Each subfragment was made from 6 to 12 oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were synthesiaed on an automatic DNA synthesizer using phosphoramidite chemistry on a controlled glass support [Beaucage and Carruthers (1901); Tetrahedron Letters 22 1859-1869].<br>
30 The five subfragments were isolated on a 2% agarose gel and inserted into pSX191. The seguence was verified by dideoxynu-cleotide sequencing. Fragments A-E were isolated and ligated<br><br>
together with Kpnl-BamHI cut pSX191. The ligation mixtures were used to transform competent E coli MCIOOCJ r",m* selecting for ampicillin resistance. The 850 bp Kpnl-Eiamlfl fragment that constitutes the part of the subtilisin 309 gene coding for the 1 mature part of the enzyme was then used to replace the wild type gene on pSX212 giving rise to pSX222, which was then transformed into a competent B. subtil is strain. After fermentation of the transformed strain and purification of the enzyme it was shown that the product v/as indistinguishable from the wild type product.<br>
Protease variants derived from the synthetic gene are made by using oligonucleotides with altered sequenct? at the place (s) where mutation is wanted (e.g. with sequences as given below) and mixing them with the rest of the oligonuclo-otides appropri¬ate to the synthetic gene. Assembly of the variant gene is carried out with the variant materials in a manner otherwise analogous to that described above. Further information on syn¬thetic genes generally is available in Agarval et al (1970); Nature; 227 27-34.<br>
A Kpnl site was introduced into the beginning of the subtilase 309 synthetic gene encoding the mature part of the enzyme. The method used is called oligonucleotide directed double-strand break repair mutagenesis and is describcMi by Mandecki (1986) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 83 7177-7101. pSXl72 is opened with Ncol at the beginning of the mature part of the subtilase 3 09 gene and is mixed with the oligonucleotide NOR 789 (see WO 92/19729) , heated to 100°C, cooled to 0"C, and transfor-med into E. coli. After retransformation, the recombinants can be screened by colony hybridisation using 32-P-labelled NOR 789. The recombinants that turned out to be positive during the screening had the Kpnl site introduced right in front of Ncol oy changing two bases without changing the amino acid sequence. ;)SX172 is described in EP Patent Publication Ho. 405 901. The <pnl site so created is inserted into psx on a fragment giving rise to psx212. psx120 also iescribed in ep patent publication no.></pnl><br>
The synthetic gene is inserted between Kpnl and BamHI on pSX212, giving rise to pSX222.<br>
Examples of mutations and corresponding sequences of oligonu¬cleotides are as follows:<br><br><br>
The filtrates were concentrated to approximately 400 ml using an Amicon CH2A UF unit equipped with an Amicon SIYIO UF cartridge. The UF concentrate was centrifuged and filtered prior to absorption at room temperature on a Bacitracin af-5 finity column at pH 7. The protease was eluted from the Bacitracin column at room temperature using 2 5% 2-propanol and 1 M sodium chloride in a buffer solution with 0.01 dimethyl-glutaric acid, 0.1 M boric acid and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 7.<br>
10 The fractions with protease activity from the Bacitracin purification step were combined and applied to a 7 50 ml Sephadex G25 column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid and 0.002 m calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
15 Fractions with proteolytic activity from the Sephadex G2 5 column were combined and applied to a 150 ml CM Sepharose CL 6B cation exchange column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated v/ith a buffer containing 0.01 M dimethylglutaric acid, 0.? M boric acid, and 0,002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
20 The protease was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-0.1 M sodium chloride in 2 litres of the same buffer (0-0.2 M sodium chloride in case of Subtilisin 147).<br>
In a final purification step protease containing fractions from the CM Sepharose column were combined and concentrated in an 25 Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with a GR81PP membrane (from the Danish Sugar Factories Inc.).<br>
By using the techniques of Example 1 for the construction and the above isolation procedure the following subtilisin 309 variants were produced and isolated;<br><br><br><br><br>
