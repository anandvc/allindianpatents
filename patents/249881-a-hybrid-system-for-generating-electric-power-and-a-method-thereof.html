				<td> [0001]	The need to power electronics equipment, communications<br>
gear, medical devices and other equipment in remote field service has been on the rise in recent years, increasing the demand for highly efficient, mobile power systems. These applications require power sources that provide both high power and energy density, while also requiring minimal size and weight, low emissions and cost.<br>
[0002]	To   date,   batteries   have   been   the   principal   means   for<br>
supplying portable sources of power. However, due to the time required for recharging, batteries have proven inconvenient for continuous use applications. Moreover, portable batteries are generally limited to power production in the range of several milliwatts to a few watts and thus cannot address the need for significant levels of mobile, lightweight power production.<br>
[0003]	Small generators powered by internal combustion engines,<br>
whether gasoline- or diesel-fueled have also been used. However, the noise and emission characteristics of such generators have made them wholly unsuitable for a wide range of mobile power systems and unsafe for indoor use. While conventional heat engines powered by high energy density liquid fuels offer advantages with respect to size, thermodynamic scaling and cost considerations have tended to favor their use in larger power plants.<br>
[0004]	Photovoltaic  and  thermoelectric  generators  are  the only<br>
commercially available energy conversion technologies below 2 kilowatts While the benefits of photovoltaic are clear, the drawbacks are obvious. With respect to thermoelectric generators, they tend to be large, expensive and relatively inefficient.<br>
[0005]	In view of these factors  a void exists with regard to power<br>
systems in the size range of approximately 5 1 to 204 kg-m/sec (50 to 2000 watts) Moreover, in order to take advantage of high energy density liquid fuels, improved fuel preparation and delivery systems capable of low fueling rates are needed Additionally, such systems must also enable highly efficient combustion with minimal emissions A quiet, clean power source below 204 kg-m/sec (2 kilowatts) could advantageously supplement current technologies, such as those based on photovoltaic arrays, and yield an advantageous hybrid system for generating electrical power<br>
[0006]	In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a hybrid<br>
system for generating electrical power comprising<br>
(a)	a photovoltaic array for collecting and converting solar radiation into electrical power<br>
(b)	an apparatus for producing power from a source of liquid fuel, the apparatus comprising (i) at least one capillary flow passage, said at least one capillary flow passage having an inlet end and an outlet end, said inlet end in fluid communication with the source of liquid fuel, (n) a heat source arranged along said at least one capillary flow passage, said heat source operable to heat the liquid fuel in said at least one capillary flow passage to a level sufficient to change at least a portion thereof from a liquid state to a vapor state and deliver a stream of substantially vaporized fuel from said outlet end of said at least one capillary flow passage, (in) a combustion chamber in communication with said outlet end of said at least one capillary flow passage, and (iv) a conversion device operable to convert heat released by combustion in said combustion chamber into electrical power, and<br>
(c)	a storage device electrically connected to said photovoltaic array and said conversion device for storing the electrical power produced by said photovoltaic array and said conversion device<br>
[0007]	In another aspect,  the present invention  is directed to a<br>
method of generating electrical power comprising,<br>
(a)	converting solar radiation into electrical power through the use of a photovoltaic array,<br>
(b)	supplying liquid fuel to at least one capillary flow passage,<br>
(c)	causing a stream of substantially vaporized fuel to pass through an outlet of the at least one capillary flow passage by heating the liquid fuel in the at least one capillary flow passage,<br>
(d)	combusting the vaporized fuel in a combustion chamber,<br>
(e)	converting heat produced by combustion of the vaporized fuel in the combustion chamber into electrical power using a conversion device, and<br>
(f)	storing electrical power generated in steps (a) and (e) in a storage device<br>
[0008]	According to one preferred form, the capillary flow passage<br>
can include a capillary tube and the heat source can include a resistance-heating element, a section of the tube heated by passing electrical current therethrough Further, in another preferred form the conversion device includes a micro-turbine with electrical generator a Stirling engine with electrical generator a thermoelectric device or a thermophotovoltaic device that outputs up to about 510 kg-m/sec (5,000 watts) of power An igniter can be provided to ignite the vaporized fuel upon start-up of the apparatus The fuel supply can be arranged to deliver pressurized liquid fuel to the flow passage at a pressure of preferably less than 7 0 kg-m/sec (100 psig), more preferably, less than 3 5 kg-m/sec (50 psig), even more preferably 0 7 kg-m/sec (10 psig) and most preferably less than 0 35 kg-m/sec (5 psig) The preferred form can be operated with low ignition energy upon start up of the apparatus since it can provide a stream of vaporized fuel which mixes with air and forms an aerosol in the combustion chamber having a mean droplet size of 25 µm or less preferably 10 µm or less<br>
[0009]	To   address   problems   associated   with   the  formation   of<br>
deposits during the heating of liquid fuel, one preferred form provides a method and means for cleaning deposits formed during the operation of the apparatus<br>

[0022]	Reference is now made to the embodiments illustrated in<br>

[0023]	The    present    invention    provides    a    power    producing<br>
apparatus which advantageously combusts a high energy density liquid fuel In a preferred embodiment, the apparatus includes at least one capillary sized flow passage connected to the fuel supply, a heat source arranged along the flow passage to heat liquid fuel in the flow passage sufficiently to deliver a stream of vaporized fuel from an outlet of the flow passage, a combustion chamber in which the vaporized fuel is combusted, and a conversion device which converts heat produced by combustion in the combustion chamber into mechanical and/or electrical power   The use<br>
of heated capillaries in connection with a combustion chamber and power conversion device is disclosed in U S Patent Application Serial No 10/143,463, filed by Pellizzan on May 10, 2002, entitled "Method and Apparatus for Generating Power By Combustion of Vaporized Fuel" having common inventorship with the present invention and assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference<br>
[0024]	The flow passage can  be a capillary tube heated  by a<br>
resistance heater, a section of the tube heated by passing electrical current therethrough The capillary flow passage also is characterized by having a low thermal inertia, so that the capillary passageway can be brought up to the desired temperature for vaporizing fuel very quickly, e g , within 2 0 seconds, preferably within 0 5 second and more preferably within 0 1 second The capillary sized fluid passage is preferably formed in a capillary body such as a single or multilayer metal, ceramic or glass body The passage has an enclosed volume opening to an inlet and an outlet either of which may be open to the exterior of the capillary body or may be connected to another passage within the same body or another body or to fittings The heater can be formed by a portion of the body such as a section of a stainless steel tube or the heater can be a discrete layer or wire of resistance heating material incorporated in or on the capillary body<br>
[0025]	The   fluid   passage   may   be   any   shape   comprising   an<br>
enclosed volume opening to an inlet and an outlet and through which a fluid may pass The fluid passage may have any desired cross-section with a preferred cross-section being a circle of uniform diameter Other capillary fluid passage cross-sections include non-circular shapes such as triangular, square, rectangular, oval or other shape and the cross section of the fluid passage need not be uniform The fluid passage can extend rectilinearly or non-rectilinearly and may be a single fluid passage or multi-path fluid passage<br>
[0026]	A  capillary-sized  flow  passage  can   be  provided  with  a<br>
hydraulic diameter that is preferably less than 2 mm, more preferably less than 1 mm, and most preferably less than 0 5 mm The "hydraulic diameter" is a parameter used in calculating fluid flow characteristics through a fluid carrying element and is defined as four times the flow area of the fluid-carrying element divided by the perimeter of the solid boundary in contact with the fluid (generally referred to as the "wetted" perimeter) For a tube having a circular flow passage the hydraulic diameter and the actual diameter are equivalent In the case where the capillary passage is defined by a metal capillary tube, the tube can have an inner diameter of 0 01 to 3 mm, preferably 0 1 to 1 mm, most preferably 0 15 to 0 5 mm Alternatively, the capillary passage can be defined by transverse cross sectional area of the passage that can be 8 x 10"5 to 7 mm2, preferably 8 x 10 3 to 8 x 10"1 mm2 and more preferably 2 x 10 3 to 2 x 10 1 mm2 Many combinations of a single or multiple capillaries, various pressures, various capillary lengths, amounts of heat applied to the capillary, and different shapes and/or cross-sectional areas will suit a given application<br>
[0027]	The conversion  device can  be  a  Stirling  engine,  micro-<br>
turbine or other suitable device for converting heat to mechanical or electrical power with an optional generator capable of producing up to about 510 kg-m/sec (5,000 watts) of power The liquid fuel can be any type of hydrocarbon fuel such as jet fuel, gasoline, kerosene or diesel oil, an oxygenate such as ethanol, methanol, methyl tertiary butyl ether, or blends of any of these and the fuel is preferably supplied to the flow passage at pressures of preferably less than 7 0 kg-m/sec (100 psig), more preferably less than 3 5 kg-m/sec (50 psig), even more preferably less than 0 7 kg-m/sec (10 psig), and most preferably less than 0 35 kg-m/sec (5 psig) The vaporized fuel can be mixed with air to form an aerosol having a mean droplet size of 25 pm or less, preferably 10 urn or less, thus allowing clean and efficient ignition capabilities<br>
[0028]	According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, liquid<br>
fuel is delivered via a heated capillary tube (e g , a small diameter glass, ceramic or metallic material such as stainless steel tube having an inner diameter of 3 mm or less) to a combustion chamber in which the vaporized fuel is mixed with preheated or unheated air The vaporized fuel can be mixed with air at ambient temperature, which is drawn into air supply passages leading into the combustion chamber Alternatively, the vaporized fuel can be mixed with air that has been preheated such as by a heat exchanger that preheats the air with heat of exhaust gases removed from the combustion chamber If desired, the air can be pressurized such as by a blower prior to mixing with the vaporized fuel<br>
[0029]	During   vaporization   of  liquid   fuel   in   a   heated   capillary<br>
passage, deposits of carbon and/or heavy hydrocarbons may accumulate on the capillary walls and flow of the fuel can be severely restricted which ultimately can lead to clogging of the capillary flow passage The rate at which these deposits accumulate is a function of capillary wall temperature, the fuel flow rate and the fuel type While it is thought that fuel additives may be useful in reducing such deposits, should clogging develop, the fuel vaporizing device of the present invention advantageously provides a means for cleaning deposits formed during operation<br>
[0030]	In accordance with the present invention, the air-fuel mixture<br>
is combusted in a combustion chamber to produce heat that is converted into mechanical or electrical power The power-producing device provides reliable liquid fuel delivery and atomization of vaporized fuel prior to combustion<br>
[0031]	The heated capillary flow passage has the ability to form an<br>
aerosol of small fuel droplets (eg    25 µm or less   preferably 10 urn or<br>
less) when the vaporized fuel mixes with air at ambient temperature, operating at liquid fuel pressures below 7 0 kg-m/sec (100 psig), preferably less than 3 5 kg-m/sec (50 psig), more preferably less than 0 7 kg-m/sec (10 psig), and even more preferably less than 0 35 kg-m/sec (5 psig) The present invention possesses the ability to combust fuel at low air supply pressure (e g , below 50 8 mm H20 (2 in H20)), starts rapidly, provides for control of fouling, clogging and gumming, operates at reduced levels of exhaust emissions and requires low ignition energy to ignite the fuel-air mixture<br>
[0032]	One advantage of the apparatus according to the invention<br>
is its ignition energy requirement characteristics Minimum ignition energy is a term used to describe the ease with which an atomized fuel/air mixture can be ignited, typically with an igniter such as a spark ignition source The device according to the invention can provide vaporized fuel and/or aerosol with droplets having a Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of less than 25 µm, preferably less than 10 µm and more preferably less than 5 urn such fine aerosols being useful to improve the start-up characteristics and flame stability in gas turbine applications Additionally, very significant reductions in minimum ignition energy can be achieved for fuels having values of SMD at or below 25 urn For example, as discussed in Lefebvre Gas Turbine Combustion (Hemisphere Publishing Corporation, 1983) at page 252, Emin, a term that correlates the ease with which an atomized fuel/air mixture may be ignited, is shown to sharply decrease as SMD decreases Minimum ignition energy is roughly proportional to the cube of the Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of the fuel droplets in the aerosol SMD is the diameter of a droplet whose surface-to-volume ratio is equal to that of the entire spray and relates to the mass transfer characteristics of the spray The relationship between Emin and SMD for various fuels is shown in Lefebvre to be roughly approximated by the following relationship<br>
log Emin - 4.5(log SMD) + k;	where Emin is measured in mJoules,<br>
SMD is measured in urn, and k is a constant related to fuel type.<br>
[0033]	According to Lefebvre, heavy fuel oil has a minimum ignition<br>
energy of about 800 mJ at a SMD of 115 µm and a minimum ignition energy of about 23 mJ at a SMD of 50 µm Isooctane has a minimum ignition energy of about 9 mJ at a SMD of 90 urn and a minimum ignition energy of about 0 4 mJ at a SMD of 40 µm For a diesel fuel, when SMD is equal to 100 µm, Emin is about 100 mJ A reduction in SMD to 30 µm would yield a reduction in Em,n to about 0 8 mJ. As may be appreciated, ignition system requirements are substantially reduced for SMD values below 25 µm<br>
[0034]	The power conversion apparatus according to the present<br>
invention has been found to exhibit highly desirable low ignition energy requirements. A low ignition energy requirement improves the power producing benefits of the present invention by reducing the weight of the overall system and maximizing the power output through the reduction of the parasitic power losses associated with the ignition system<br>
[0035]	In view of the benefits hereinabove described, low energy<br>
spark ignition devices are preferred for the igniter of the power producing apparatus Preferred are small piezo-electnc ignition devices capable of providing a spark energy in the range of about 5 to 7 millijoules (mJ) Such devices are known to be simple, compact and present no parasitic load issues. The ultra-fine fuel vaporization provided by the apparatus of the invention cooperates to provide excellent ignition characteristics with low energy piezo-electric ignition devices<br>
[0036]	The emissions characteristics of liquid-fueled combustion<br>
devices are known to be sensitive to the quality of the fuel droplet size<br>
distribution High quality, fine sprays promote fuel evaporation and enhance mixing, thereby reducing the need for fuel-rich combustion and the often-attendant generation of smoke and soot Small droplets follow flow streamlines and are less prone to impact against burner walls Conversely, large droplets can impact burner walls and cause CO and hydrocarbon emissions and carbon deposits This problem is more noticeable in devices where the flames are highly confined<br>
[0037]	The heat produced during combustion of the vaporized fuel<br>
can be converted to electrical or mechanical power For instance, the heat could be converted to any desired amount of electrical or mechanical power, eg, up to 510 kg-m/sec (5000 watts) of electrical power or mechanical power Compared to portable battery technology which can only provide approximately 2 0 kg-m/sec (20 W) for a few hours or a noisy, high emissions, internal combustion engine/generator producing above 102 kg-m/sec (1 kW), the apparatus according to one preferred embodiment of the invention offers a quiet, clean power source in the few hundred watt range<br>
[0038]	Various technologies exist for conversion of heat produced<br>
in the combustion chamber according to the invention into electrical or mechanical power For instance in the 2 0 to 510 kg-m/sec (20 to 5000 watt) range, at least the following technologies are contemplated Stirling engines for conversion of heat into mechanical power which can be used to drive a generator, micro-gas turbines which can be used to drive a generator, thermoelectric for direct conversion of heat into electricity, and thermophotovoltaics for direct conversion of radiant energy into electricity<br>
[0039]	The thermoelectric devices offer advantages  in terms of<br>
being quiet and durable, and coupled with external combustion systems, offer the potential for low emissions and flexibility as to fuel Various types of thermoelectric generators, which can be used as the conversion device<br>
include those disclosed in U S Patent Nos 5,563,368, 5,793,119, 5,917,144, and 6,172,427, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference<br>
[0040]	The thermophotovoltaic devices offer advantages in terms<br>
of being quiet, providing moderate power density, and coupled with external combustion systems offer the potential for low emissions and flexibility as to fuel Various types of thermophotovoltaic devices, which can be used as the conversion device, include those disclosed in U S Patent Nos 5,512,109, 5,753 050 6,092,912, and 6,204,442, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference As shown in U S Patent No 6,204,442, a heat radiating body can be used to absorb heat from combustion gases and heat radiated from the heat radiating body is directed to a photocell for conversion to electricity, thus protecting the photocell from direct exposure to the combustion gases<br>
[0041]	Micro-gas  turbines   could   be  desirable   in   terms  of  high<br>
specific power Microturbine devices, which can be used as the conversion device, include those disclosed in U S Patent Nos 5,836,150, 5,874,798, and 5,932,940, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference<br>
[0042]	Stirling engines offer advantages with respect to size, quiet<br>
operation, durability, and coupled with external combustion systems offer the potential for low emissions and flexibility as to fuel Stirling engines that can be used as the conversion device will be apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
[0043]	Referring now to FIG   1, a fuel-vaporizing device for use in<br>
the apparatus of the present invention is shown Fuel vaporizing device 10, for vaporizing a liquid fuel drawn from a source of liquid fuel, includes a capillary flow passage 12, having an inlet end 14 and an outlet end 16   A<br>
fluid control valve 18 is provided for placing inlet end 14 of capillary flow passage 12 in fluid communication with a liquid fuel source F and introducing the liquid fuel in a substantially liquid state into capillary flow passage 12 As is preferred, fluid control valve 18 may be operated by a solenoid A heat source 20 is arranged along capillary flow passage 12 As is most preferred, heat source 20 is provided by formtng capillary flow passage 12 from a tube of electrically resistive material, a portion of capillary flow passage 12 forming a heater element when a source of electrical current is connected to the tube at connections 22 and 24 for delivering current therethrough Heat source 20, as may be appreciated, is then operable to heat the liquid fuel in capillary flow passage 12 to a level sufficient to change at least a portion thereof from the liquid state to a vapor state and deliver a stream of substantially vaporized fuel from outlet end 16 of capillary flow passage 20 By substantially vaporized is meant that at least 50% of the liquid fuel is vaporized by the heat source, preferably at least 70%, and more preferably at least 80% of the liquid fuel is vaporized<br>
[0044]	Fuel vaporizing device 10 also includes means for cleaning<br>
deposits formed during the operation of the apparatus of the present invention The means for cleaning deposits shown in FIG 1 includes fluid control valve 18, heat source 20 and an oxidizer control valve 26 for placing capillary flow passage 12 in fluid communication with a source of oxidizer C As may be appreciated, the oxidizer control valve can be located at or near either end of capillary flow passage 12 or configured to be in fluid communication with either end of capillary flow passage 12 If the oxidizer control valve is located at or near the outlet end 16 of capillary flow passage 12, it then serves to place the source of oxidizer C in fluid communication with the outlet end 16 of capillary flow passage 12 In operation, heat source 20 is used to heat the oxidizer C in capillary flow passage 12 to a level sufficient to oxidize deposits formed during the heating of the liquid fuel F    In one embodiment, to switch from a fueling<br><br>
mode to a cleaning mode, the oxidizer control valve 26 is operable to alternate between the introduction of liquid fuel F and the introduction of oxidizer C into capillary flow passage 12 and enables the in-situ cleaning of capillary flow passage when the oxidizer is introduced into the at least one capillary flow passage<br>
[0045]	One technique for oxidizing deposits includes passing air or<br>
steam through the capillary flow passage As indicated, the capillary flow passage is preferably heated during the cleaning operation so that the oxidation process is initiated and nurtured until the deposits are consumed To enhance this cleaning operation, a catalytic substance may be employed, either as a coating on, or as a component of, the capillary wall to reduce the temperature and/or time required for accomplishing the cleaning For continuous operation of the fuel vaporizing device, more than one capillary flow passage can be used such that when a clogged condition is detected, such as by the use of a sensor, fuel flow can be diverted to another capillary flow passage and oxidant flow initiated through the clogged capillary flow passage to be cleaned As an example, a capillary body can include a plurality of capillary flow passages therein and a valving arrangement can be provided to selectively supply liquid fuel or air to each flow passage<br>
[0046]	Alternatively, fuel flow can be diverted from a capillary flow<br>
passage and oxidant flow initiated at preset intervals Fuel delivery to a capillary flow passage can be effected by a controller For example, the controller can activate fuel delivery for a preset time period and deactivate fuel delivery after the preset amount of time The controller may also effect adjustment of the pressure of the liquid fuel and/or the amount of heat supplied to the capillary flow passage based on one or more sensed conditions The sensed conditions may include inter alia the fuel pressure, the capillary temperature or the air-fuel ratio The controller may also control one or more capillary flow passages to clean deposits<br>
[0047]	The  cleaning  technique  may  be  applied   to   combustion<br>
devices having a single flow passage However, if the combustion device is intermittently shut down during the cleaning operation, the energy supplied to the flow passage during cleaning would preferably be electrical The time period between cleanings may either be fixed based upon experimentally determined clogging characteristics, or a sensing and control device may be employed to detect clogging and initiate the cleaning process as required For example, a control device could detect the degree of clogging by sensing the fuel supply pressure to the capillary flow passage<br>
[0048]	As indicated, the oxidation cleaning technique may also be<br>
applied to fuel vaporizing devices that are required to operate continuously In this case, multiple capillary flow passages are employed An exemplary multiple capillary flow passage fuel-vaporizing device for use in the present invention is illustrated in FIGS 2 and 3 FIG 2 presents a schematic view of a multiple capillary tube arrangement, integrated into a single assembly 94 FIG 3 presents an end view of the assembly 94 As shown, the assembly can include the three capillary tubes 82A, 82B, 82C and a positive electrode 92 which can include a solid stainless steel rod The tubes and the rod can be supported in a body 96 of electrically insulating material and power can be supplied to the rod and capillary tubes via fittings 98 For example, direct current can be supplied to upstream ends of one or more of the capillary tubes and a connection 95 at the downstream ends thereof can form a return path for the current through rod 92<br>
[0049]	Reference  is  made  now  to   FIG    4,   wherein  a  multiple<br>
capillary tube vaporizing system 80 for use in the practice of the present invention is shown    The system includes capillary tubes 82A through C fuel supply lines 84A through C, oxidizer supply lines 86A through C,<br>
oxidizer control valves 88A through C, power input lines 90A-C and common ground 91 The system 80 allows cleaning of one or more capillary tubes while fuel delivery continues with one or more other capillary tubes For example, combustion of fuel via capillary flow passages 82B and 82C can be carried out during cleaning of capillary flow passage 82A Cleaning of capillary flow passage 82A can be accomplished by shutting off the supply of fuel to capillary tube 82A supplying atr to capillary flow passage 82A with sufficient heating to oxidize deposits in the capillary flow passage Thus, the cleaning of one or several capillaries can be carried out while continuously delivering fuel The one or more capillary flow passages being cleaned are preferably heated during the cleaning process by an electrical resistance heater or thermal feedback from the application Again, the time period between cleanings for any given capillary flow passage may either be fixed based upon known clogging characteristics, determined experimentally, or a sensing and control system may be employed to detect deposit buildup and initiate the cleaning process as required<br>
[0050]	FIG  5 shows an exemplary schematic of a control system to<br>
operate an apparatus in accordance with the present invention, the apparatus incorporating an oxidizing gas supply for cleaning clogged capillary passages The control system includes a controller 100 operably connected to a fuel supply 102 that supplies fuel and optionally air to a flow passage such as a capillary flow passage 104 The controller is also operably connected to a power supply 106 that delivers power to a resistance heater or directly to a metal capillary flow passage 104 for heating the tube sufficiently to vaporize the fuel If desired, the combustion system can include multiple flow passages and heaters operably connected to the controller 100 The controller 100 can be operably connected to one or more signal sending devices such as an on-off switch, thermocouple, fuel flow rate sensor, air flow rate sensor, power output sensor, battery charge sensor, etc whereby the controller 100 can<br>
be programmed to automatically control operation of the combustion system in response to the signal(s) outputted to the controller by the signal sending devices 108<br>
[0051]	In operation, the fuel vaporizing device of the apparatus<br>
according to the present invention can be configured to feed back heat produced during combustion such that the liquid fuel is heated sufficiently to substantially vaporize the liquid fuel as it passes through the capillary reducing or eliminating or supplementing the need to electrically or otherwise heat the capillary flow passage For example, the capillary tube can be made longer to increase the surface area thereof for greater heat transfer, the capillary tube can be configured to pass through the combusting fuel or a heat exchanger can be arranged to use exhaust gas from the combustion reaction to preheat the fuel<br>
[0052]	FIG    6  shows,   in   simplified  form,   how   a   capillary  flow<br>
passage 64 can be arranged so that liquid fuel traveling therethrough can be heated to an elevated temperature to reduce the power requirements of the fuel-vaponzing heater As shown, a portion 66 of a tube comprising the capillary flow passage passes through the flame 68 of the combusted fuel For initial start up, a resistance heater comprising a section of the tube or separate resistance heater heated by electrical leads 70, 72 connected to a power source such as a battery 74 can be used to initially vaporize the liquid fuel After ignition of the vaporized fuel by a suitable ignition arrangement, the portion 66 of the tube can be preheated by the heat of combustion to reduce the power otherwise needed for continued vaporization of the fuel by the resistance heater Thus, by preheating the tube, the fuel in the tube can be vaporized without using the resistance heater whereby power can be conserved<br>
[0053]	As  will   be  appreciated,   the fuel  vaporizing  device  and<br>
attendant system depicted in FIGS   1  through 6 may also be used in<br>
connection with another embodiment of the present invention Referring again to FIG 1, the means for cleaning deposits includes fluid control valve 18, a solvent control valve 26 for placing capillary flow passage 12 in fluid communication with a solvent, solvent control valve 26 disposed at one end of capillary flow passage 12 In one embodiment of the apparatus employing solvent cleaning, the solvent control valve is operable to alternate between the introduction of liquid fuel and the introduction of solvent into capillary flow passage 12, enabling the in-situ cleaning of capillary flow passage 12 when the solvent is introduced into capillary flow passage 12 While a wide variety of solvents have utility, the solvent may comprise liquid fuel from the liquid fuel source When this is the case, no solvent control valve is required as there is no need to alternate between fuel and solvent, and the heat source should be phased-out or deactivated during the cleaning of capillary flow passage 12<br>
[0054]	FIG    7   presents   another  exemplary  embodiment  of the<br>
present invention A fuel-vaporizing device 200 for use in the apparatus of the present invention has a heated capillary flow passage 212 for delivering liquid fuel F Heat is provided by heat source 220, which is arranged along capillary flow passage 212 As is most preferred, heat source 220 is provided by forming capillary flow passage 212 from a tube of electrically resistive material, a portion of capillary flow passage 212 forming a heater element when a source of electrical current is connected to the tube at connections 222 and 224 for delivering current therethrough<br>
[0055]	In order to clean deposits formed during operation of fuel<br>
vaporizing device 200, an axially moveable rod 232 is positioned through opening 236 of end cap 234 of device body 230 so as to be in axial alignment with the opening of inlet end 214 of capillary flow passage 212 Packing material 238 is provided within the interior volume of end cap 234 for sealing Referring now to FIG 7A, axial moveable rod 232 is shown fully extended within capillary flow passage 212    As may be appreciated,<br>
selecting the diameter of axial moveable rod 232 for minimal wall clearance within the interior of capillary flow passage 212 produces a combination capable of removing substantially all of the deposits built up along the interior surface of capillary flow passage 212 during the operation of fuel vaporizing device 200<br>
[0056]	FIG   8 shows a schematic of an apparatus in accordance<br>
with the invention which includes a free-piston Stirling engine 30, a combustion chamber 34 wherein heat at 550-750°C is converted into mechanical power by a reciprocating piston which drives an alternator 32 to produce electrical power The assembly also includes a capillary flow passage/heater assembly 36, a controller 38, a rectifier/regulator 40, a battery 42, a fuel supply 44, a recuperator 46, a combustion blower 48, a cooler 50, and a cooler/blower 52 In operation, the controller 38 is operable to control delivery of fuel to the capillary 36 and to control combustion of the fuel in the chamber 34 such that the heat of combustion drives a piston in the Stirling engine such that the engine outputs electricity from the alternator 32 If desired, the Stirling engine/alternator can be replaced with a kinematic Stirling engine which outputs mechanical power Examples of combustion chambers and air preheating arrangements can be found in U S Patent Nos 4,277,942, 4,352,269, 4,384,457 and 4,392,350, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference<br>
[0057]	FIG 9 presents a partial cross-sectional schematic view of a<br>
power-producing device in accordance with another embodiment of the invention, which can form part of a heat conversion device such as a Stirling engine assembly As shown in FIG 9, air delivered to an air inlet by an air blower enters the combustion chamber 34 and mixes with vaporized fuel delivered to the chamber by the capillary/heater arrangement 36 Heat of combustion in the chamber 34 heats the end of the Stirling engine 30 and a sliding piston reciprocates within an alternator in a manner that generates electricity    The chamber 34 can be designed<br>
to allow the exhaust gases to preheat incoming air and thus lower the energy requirements for combusting the fuel For instance, the housing can include a multiwall arrangement, which allows the incoming air to circulate in a plenum, which is heated by exhaust gases circulating in an exhaust passage Inlet air (indicated by arrow 55) can be caused to swirl in the combustion chamber by passing the air through swirler vanes 56 around the combustion chamber 34 The combusted air-fuel mixture heats the heat conversion device (Stirling engine) 30 and exhaust gases (indicated by arrows 57) are removed from the combustion chamber<br>
[0058]	In general, the power conversion apparatus could include a<br>
liquid fuel source, at least one flow passage (e g , one or more heated capillary tubes) through which fuel from the fuel supply is vaporized and delivered to a combustion chamber wherein the vaporized fuel is combusted, and heat produced in the combustion chamber is used to drive a Stirling engine or other heat conversion device A heat exchanger can be used to preheat air as the air travels through air passages in the heat exchanger thereby maximizing efficiency of the device, i e , by preheating the air mixed with the vaporized fuel to support combustion in the chamber, less fuel is needed to maintain the Stirling engine at a desired operating temperature The exhaust gas can travel through exhaust ducts in the heat exchanger whereby heat from the exhaust gas can be transferred to the air being delivered to the combustion chamber<br>
[0059]	The   combustion   chamber   can   incorporate   any   suitable<br>
arrangement wherein air is mixed with the vaporized fuel and/or an air-fuel mixture is combusted For example, the fuel can be mixed with air in a venturi to provide an air-fuel mixture and the air-fuel mixture can be combusted in a heat-generating zone downstream from the venturi In order to initiate combustion, the air-fuel mixture can be confined in an ignition zone in which an igniter such as a spark generator ignites the mixture   The igniter can be any device capable of igniting the fuel such as<br>
a mechanical spark generator, an electrical spark generator, resistance heated ignition wire or the like The electrical spark generator can be powered by any suitable power source, such as a small battery However, the battery can be replaced with a manually operated piezoelectric transducer that generates an electric current when activated With such an arrangement, current can be generated electro-mechanically due to compression of the transducer For instance, a striker can be arranged so as to strike the transducer with a predetermined force when the trigger is depressed The electricity generated by the transducer can be supplied to a spark generating mechanism by suitable circuitry Such an arrangement could be used to ignite the fuel-air mixture<br>
[0060]	Some of the electrical power generated by the conversion<br>
device can be stored in a suitable storage device such as a battery or capacitor, which can be used to power the igniter For example, a manually operated switch can be used to deliver electrical current to a resistance-heating element or directly through a portion of a metal tube, which vaporizes fuel in the flow passage and/or the electrical current can be supplied to an igniter for initiating combustion of the fuel-air mixture delivered to the combustion chamber<br>
[0061]	If desired, the heat generated by combusting the fuel could<br>
be used to operate any types of devices that rely on mechanical or electrical power For instance, a heat conversion source could be used to generate electricity for portable electrical equipment such as telephone communication devices (e g , wireless phones), portable computers, power tools, appliances, camping equipment, military equipment, transportation equipment such as mopeds, powered wheelchairs and marine propulsion devices, electronic sensing devices, electronic monitoring equipment, battery chargers, lighting equipment, heating equipment, etc The heat conversion device could also be used to supply power to non-portable devices or to locations where access to an electrical<br>
power grid is not available, inconvenient or unreliable Such locations and/or non-portable devices include remote living quarters and military encampments, vending machines, marine equipment, etc<br>
[0062]	Contemplated   photovoltaic  arrays  for  use  in  the  hybrid<br>
power generating systems of the present invention include a wide variety of photovoltaic cells Examples of preferred types known to be available can provide 20-25% conversion efficiency and may include several conversion layers For example, a blue-responsive layer on an outermost surface, then a green-red responsive layer, and then an infrared layer Other types are made with gallium rather than silicon Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, it may be more economic to use a relatively inefficient (10-18%) cell, wherein the semi-conducting surface of a cell is preferably provided with an adequate amount (in terms of cross-sectional area) of conductive metallic strips so that the generated current, which may be several times greater than that envisaged by its manufacturers, does not cause overheating of the semiconductor or even melting of metal conductors<br>
[0063]	Alternatively, dedicated designs of solar cells may comprise<br>
an amorphous type comprising layered amorphous silicon constructed on a planar or non-planar surface, as those skilled in the art will understand Developments in the construction of these cells can allow cell material to be evaporated or sprayed onto any surface to form a conforming coating<br>
[0064]	A variety of methods for producing photovoltaic cells and<br>
photovoltaic   arrays   are   known,   as   evidenced   by   U S    Patent   Nos 4,152,824,    4,239,555,    4,451,969,    4,595,790,    4,851,308,    6,077,722, 6,111,189, 6,368,892, 6,423,565, and 6,465,724, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference<br>
[0065]	As   is   common   in   the   art   of   power   generation   using<br>
photovoltaic cells, means to balance out loading may be provided if, for example, a part of the array is in a relatively poorly illuminated position A useful operating voltage is at least 12 volts, with higher voltages providing enhanced utility from the standpoint of minimizing transmission losses and semiconductor losses, particularly when the sunlight is weak and the actual voltage drops A step-up converter may be provided as is known in the art, to maintain a constant output voltage though at varying currents Typically, an array used in combination with this invention may produce in the range of 51 to 204 kg-m/sec (500 watts to 2 kilowatts) or more of electricity<br>
[0066]	Referring now to FIG  10, a block diagram of a hybrid power<br>
system 300 in accordance with a preferred form is shown As shown, a power unit 310 is provided which includes a liquid fuel source, one or more heated capillary tubes through which fuel from a fuel supply is vaporized and delivered to a combustion chamber wherein the vaporized fuel is combusted, and heat produced during combustion chamber is used to drive a Stirling engine or other heat conversion device, as previously described The heat conversion device may be advantageously attached to an alternator, such as a linear alternator for the production of electrical power and sent to storage battery 340 that feeds power electronics module 350, which, in turn, is connected to a load<br>
[0067]	Photovoltaic array 320, which may be selected from the<br>
types previously described, is also electrically connected to storage battery 340 and may be sized to provide the total requirements of the load during periods of peak solar radiation or may be designed for supplementation by power unit 310 With respect to the sizing of the power unit 310, a unit having an engine with a 35 7 kg-m/sec (350-watt) capacity would provide a similar power output over 12 hours per day as a 102 kg-m/sec (1-kilowatt) photovoltaic array provides on a sunny day    As such, the capacity of the<br>
power unit can be considerably lower than that of the PV array and still provide dispatch capability and power reliability enhancement As may be appreciated multiple power units could be used simultaneously to address larger applications<br>
[0068]	As is particularly preferred, photovoltaic array 320 provides<br>
about 90% of delivered electricity, yielding a hybrid strategy that requires about 300 to 800 hours annually of engine operation The hybrid architecture of the present invention can reduce the need for photovoltaic panel and battery storage capacity by 25% to 50% and can reduce capital and ownership costs as compared to photovoltaic arrays Additionally, the hybrid architecture contemplated reduces stress on the battery subsystem (reduced levels of discharge, etc ) with resultant increases in replacement schedules of a factor of two or more<br>
[0069]	While   the   invention   has   been   described   in   detail   with<br>
reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes can be made, and equivalents employed, without departing from the scope of the invention<br><br><br><br><br><br>
