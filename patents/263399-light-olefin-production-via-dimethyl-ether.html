				<td>BACKGROUND OF TKE INVENTION<br>
(0001]      This invention relates generally to the production of olefins and, more particularly,<br>
to the production of light olefins via processing of dimethyl ether.<br>
(0002)      A major portion of the worldwide petrochemical industry is concerned with the<br>
production of light olefin materials and their subsequent use in the production of numerous<br>
important chemical products such as via polymerization, oligomerization, alkylation and the<br>
like well-known chemical reactions. Light olefins generally include ethylene, propylene and<br>
mixtures thereof. These light olefins are essential building blocks used in the modern<br>
petrochemical and chemical industries. A major source for light olefins in present day<br>
refining is the steam cracking of petroleum feeds. For various reasons including geographical,<br>
economic, political and diminished supply considerations, the art has long sought sources<br>
other than petroleum' for the massive quantities of raw materials that are needed to supply the<br>
demand for these light olefin materials.<br>
(0003]      The search for alternative materials for light olefin production has led to the use of<br>
oxygenates such as alcohols and, more particularly, to the use of methanol, ethanol, and<br>
higher alcohols or their derivatives such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, etc., for example.<br>
Molecular sieves such as microporous crystalline zeolite and non-zeolitic catalysts,<br>
particularly silicoaluminophosphates (SAPO), are known to promote the conversion of<br>
oxygenates to hydrocarbon mixtures, particularly hydrocarbon mixtures composed largely of<br>
light olefins.<br>
(0004]      Such processing, wherein the oxygenate-containing feed is primarily methanol or a<br>
methanol-water combination (including crude methanol), typically results in the release of<br>
significant quantities of water upon the sought conversion of such feeds to light olefins. For<br>
example, such processing normally involves the release of 2 mols of water per mol of<br>
ethylene formed and the release of 3 mols of water per mol of propylene formed. The<br>
presence of such increased relative amounts of water can significantly increase the potential<br>
for hydrothermal damage to the oxygenate conversion catalyst Moreover, the presence of<br>
such increased relative amounts of water significantly increases the volumetric flow rate of<br>
the reactor effluent, resulting in the need for larger sized vessels and associated processing<br>
and operating equipment including necessitating higher compression requirements.<br>
[0005]      US 5,714,662 to Vora et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety, discloses a process for the production of light olefins from a<br>
hydrocarbon gas stream by a combination of reforming, oxygenate production, and oxygenate<br>
conversion wherein a crude methanol stream (produced in the production of oxygenates and<br>
comprising methanol, light ends, and heavier alcohols) is passed directly to an oxygenate<br>
conversion zone for the production of light olefins.<br>
[0066]      While such processing has proven to be effective for light olefin production,<br>
further improvements have been desired and sought For example, there is an ongoing desire<br>
and need for reducing the size and consequently the cost of required reaction vessels. Further,<br>
there is an ongoing desire and need for processing schemes and arrangements that can more<br>
readily handle and manage the heat of reaction and byproduct water associated with such<br>
processing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]      A general object of the invention is to provide improved processing schemes and<br>
arrangements for the production of olefins, particularly light olefins.<br>
[0008]      A more specific-objective of the invention is to overcome one or more of the<br>
problems described above.<br>
[0009]      The general object of the invention can be attained, at least in part, through<br>
specified methods for producing light olefins. In accordance with one embodiment such a<br>
method involves contacting a synthesis gas-ontaining feedstock in a synthesis gas conversion<br>
reactor zone with a catalyst material and at reaction conditions effective to produce a<br>
synthesis gas conversion reactor zone effluent comprising product dimethyl ether, other<br>
synthesis gas conversion products (including methanol and water) and unreacted synthesis<br>
gas. Unreacted synthesis gas is separated from the product dimethyl ether and the other<br>
synthesis gas conversion products. The product dimethyl ether is separated from the other<br>
synthesis gas conversion product water and at least a portion of the other synthesis gas<br>
conversion product methanol. The method further involves contacting a feed comprising at<br>
least a portion of the separated product dimethyl ether in an oxygenate conversion reactor<br>
zone with an oxygenate conversion catalyst and at reaction conditions effective to convert the<br>
feed to an oxygenate conversion product stream comprising light olefins.<br>
[0010]      The prior art generally fails to provide processing schemes and arrangements for<br>
the production of olefins and, more particularly, to the production of light olefins from an<br>
oxygenate-containing feed and which processing schemes and arrangements are as simple,<br>
effective and/or efficient as may be desired.<br>
[0011]      A method for producing light olefins in accordance with another embodiment<br>
involves contacting a synthesis gas-containing feedstock in a synthesis gas conversion reactor<br>
zone with a catalyst material and at reaction conditions effective to convert a portion of the<br>
synthesis gas-containing feedstock to product dimethyl ether and to produce a synthesis gas<br>
conversion reactor zone effluent comprising unreacted synthesis gas, product dimethyl ether<br>
and other synthesis gas conversion products, including methanol and water. The unreacted<br>
synthesis gas and the product dimethyl ether are separated from the other synthesis gas<br>
conversion products to form a first process stream consisting essentially of the unreacted<br>
synthesis gas and the product dimethyl ether. The unreacted synthesis gas is subsequently<br>
separated from the product dimethyl ether. At least a portion of the subsequently separated<br>
unreacted synthesis gas is recycled to the synthesis gas conversion reactor zone wherein at<br>
least a portion of the recycled synthesis gas converts to product dimethyl ether. A feed<br>
comprising at least a portion of the subsequently separated product dimethyl ether is<br>
contacted in an oxygenate conversion reactor zone with an oxygenate conversion catalyst and<br>
at reaction conditions effective to convert the feed to an oxygenate conversion product stream<br>
comprising light olefins.<br>
[0012]      There is also provided a system for producing light olefins. In accordance with one<br>
preferred embodiment, such a system includes a synthesis gas conversion reactor zone for<br>
contacting a synthesis gas-containing feedstock with a catalyst material and at reaction<br>
conditions effective to convert the synthesis gas-containing feedstock to a synthesis gas<br>
conversion product stream comprising dimethyl ether, methanol unconverted synthesis gas<br>
and water. A first separator is provided for separating a vapor phase comprising unconverted<br>
synthesis gas and product dimethyl ether from a condensate phase comprising product liquid<br>
methanol and water. An absorber is provided for absorbing dimethyl ether from the vapor<br>
phase using methanol and to form a first absorber stream comprising unconverted synthesis<br>
gas and a second absorber stream comprising product dimethyl ether in methanol. A second<br>
separator is provided effective to separate product dimethyl ether from methanol in the<br>
second absorber stream. The system further includes an oxygenate conversion reactor zone<br>
for contacting a feed comprising at least a portion of the separated product dimethyl ether<br>
with an oxygenate conversion catalyst and at reaction conditions effective to convert the feed<br>
to an oxygenate conversion product stream comprising light olefins.<br>
[0013]      As used herein, references to "light olefins" are to be understood to generally refer<br>
to C2 and C3 olefins, i.e., ethylene andpropylene. The term "carbon oxide" refers to carbon<br>
dioxide and/or carbon monoxide. The term "synthesis gas", also sometimes referred to as<br>
"syn gas", generally refers to a combination of hydrogen and carbon oxides such as produced<br>
by or in a synthesis gas production facility from a hydrocarbon gas such as derived from<br>
natural gas or from the partial oxidation of a petroleum or coal residue. Normally, synthesis<br>
gas is identified as a combination of H2 and CO at various ratios, sometimes with minor<br>
amounts of CO2.<br>
[0014]      Other objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the<br>
following detailed description taken in conjunction with the appended claims and drawing.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0015]      The FIGURE is a simplified schematic diagram of a  process for the production of<br>
olefins via dimethyl ether in accordance with one embodiment<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016]      A hydrocarbon gas feedstream such as a natural or synthetic natural gas stream<br>
such as produced from a natural gas, coal, shale oil, residua or combination thereof and such<br>
as typically comprises methane and ethane can be processed in a synthesis gas production<br>
facility to remove impurities such as sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, particulate<br>
matter, and condensibles and to provide a synthesis gas stream reduced in contaminants and<br>
containing hydrogen and carbon oxide in a desired molar ratio. Such a synthesis gas stream<br>
can in turn be introduced into a synthesis gas conversion reactor zone for contact with a<br>
catalyst material and at reaction conditions effective to produce a synthesis gas conversion<br>
reactor zone effluent that includes dimethyl ether, other synthesis gas conversion products,<br>
such as methanol and water, and unreacted synthesis gas. The synthesis gas conversion<br>
reactor zone effluent can be appropriately separated to form a stream of dimethyl ether and a<br>
stream of methanol. A feed such as generally composed of at least a portion of the separated<br>
product dimethyl ether can men be contacted in an oxygenate conversion reactor zone with an<br>
oxygenate conversion catalyst and at reaction conditions effective to convert the feed to an<br>
oxygenate conversion product stream comprising light olefins.<br>
[©017]      Reference is now made to the FIGURE which is simplified schematic process<br>
flow diagram for a process scheme, generally designated by the reference numeral 10, for the<br>
production of olefins via dimethyl ether in accordance with one embodiment. It is to be<br>
understood that no unnecessary limitation to the scope of the claims which follow is intended<br>
by the following description. Those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein<br>
provided will recognize and appreciate that the illustrated process flow diagram has been<br>
simplified by the elimination of various usual or customary pieces of process equipment<br>
including some heat exchangers, process control systems, pumps, fractionation systems, and<br>
the like. It may also be discerned that the process flow depicted in the FIGURE may be<br>
modified in many aspects without departing from the basic overall concept of the invention.<br>
[0018]      A hydrocarbon gas feedstream, such as described above and designated by the<br>
reference numeral 12, is passed to a synthesis gas generation or production zone 14 to<br>
produce a synthesis gas-containing stream 16. The synthesis gas generation or production<br>
zone 14, or synthesis gas production facility, can operate at conventional operating conditions<br>
such as at a reaction temperature ranging from 800° to 950° C, a pressure ranging from 10 to<br>
30 bar, and a water to carbon molar ratio ranging from 2.0 to 3.5. In the synthesis gas<br>
generation zone 14, impurities such as sulfur compounds, nitrogen compounds, particulate<br>
matter, and condensibles are desirably removed such as in a conventional manner to provide<br>
the synthesis gas-containing stream 16 that is reduced in contaminants and containing a molar<br>
ratio of hydrogen to carbon oxide (carbon monoxide plus carbon dioxide) ranging from 2 to<br>
3, and more typically the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon oxide varies from 2.0 to 2.3.<br>
Optionally (not shown), the ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide may be varied according to<br>
the shift reaction (1), shown below, over a copper/zinc or chromium oxide catalyst such as in<br>
a conventional manner:<br>
CO + H20→C02 + H2      (1)<br>
[0019]       The synthesis gas-containing stream 16 is passed via a line 20 to a synthesis gas<br>
conversion reactor zone 22. In the synthesis gas conversion reactor zone 22, at least a portion<br>
of the synthesis gas will undergo conversion to form reduction products of carbon oxides,<br>
such as alcohols, at conditions including a reactor temperature in the range of 150°C (300°F)<br>
to 450°C (850°F) at a pressure typically in the range of 1 to 1000 atmospheres over a variety<br>
of catalysts. In accordance with certain embodiments, catalysts based on ZnO for the<br>
production of methanol and dimethyl ether are preferred.<br>
[0020]      The methanol synthesis reaction can "benefit from the coproduction of dimethyl<br>
ether. In particular, methanol synthesis from hydrogen gas (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) is<br>
generally equilibrium limited with typical per-pass conversion rates in the range of 25% to<br>
30% at a pressure of 50 to 100 bar and a temperature in the range of 250° to 300°C. However,<br>
if methanol is converted to dimethyl ether, either while the methanol is being produced or<br>
shortly thereafter, the equilibrium can desirably be shifted to more favorable, higher synthesis<br>
gas conversions. As a result of such increased synthesis gas conversion rates, the amount or<br>
extent of recycle of unreacted synthesis gas, as more fully described below, can be decreased<br>
or minimized.<br>
[0021]       For example, methanol can be produced by passing synthesis gas over a supported<br>
mixed metal oxide catalyst of CuO and ZnO. Methanol conversion to dimethyl ether can be<br>
accomplished by passing such methanol over an acidic catalyst such as comprising<br>
gamma-alumina or the like. Both of the methanol formation and the methanol conversion to<br>
dimethyl ether reactions are exothermic and typically best operate at a temperature in the<br>
rangeof 250° to 300°C.<br>
[0022]      In accordance with certain preferred embodiments, the conversion of methanol to<br>
dimethyl ether can be accomplished by using a mixed catalyst system in the reactor used for<br>
methanol synthesis. In accordance with certain alternative preferred embodiments, the<br>
conversion of methanol to dimethyl ether can be accomplished by employing a reactor with<br>
alternating beds of methanol synthesis catalyst and methanol-to-dimethyl ether conversion<br>
catalyst. In accordance with certain yet other alternative preferred embodiments, the<br>
conversion of methanol to dimethyl ether can be accomplished by employing consecutive<br>
reactors for the production of methanol and subsequent conversion of methanol to dimethyl<br>
ether. For example, a synthesis gas-containing feedstock can be contacted in a synthesis<br>
gas-to-methanol production reactor with a synthesis gas-to-methanol conversion catalyst and<br>
at reaction conditions effective to convert at least a portion of the synthesis gas-containing<br>
feedstock to a product stream comprising methanol. At least a portion of such product stream<br>
methanol can subsequently be contacted in a methanol conversion reactor with a methanol-to-<br>
dimethyl ether conversion catalyst and at reaction conditions effective to convert at least a<br>
first portion of the product stream methanol to dimethyl ether, forming the synthesis gas<br>
conversion reactor section effluent<br>
{0023]       As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art andguided by the teaching herein<br>
provided, the reactors employed in such processing can desirably be tubular reactors with a<br>
circulating coolant, such as water, on the shell side, or adiabatic reactors such as with internal<br>
quench, interstage cooling, cooling coils or the like.<br>
{0024]       A synthesis gas conversion reactor zone effluent stream 24 comprising methanol,<br>
dimethyl ether and water is withdrawn from the synthesis gas conversion reactor zone 22.<br>
{0025]       The synthesis gas conversion reactor zone effluent stream 24, such as after cooling<br>
such as via one or more heat exchangers (not shown) is passed to a separation zone, generally<br>
designated by the reference numeral 26. The separation zone 26 includes a first separation<br>
section 30, such as generally composed of a flash system, fractionator, or a stripper for the<br>
removal of unconverted synthesis gas, followed by similar means for the consecutive<br>
separation of dimethyl ether, methanol, and water fractions as may be required or desired by<br>
the downstream operation.<br>
{0026]      For example, in accordance with one preferred embodiment, the separation<br>
realized in such a first separation section can be in the form of a partial condensation<br>
separation with unreacted synthesis gas and a portion of the product dimethyl ether being<br>
separated from the other synthesis gas conversion products (e.g., methanol, water and some<br>
dimethyl ether) such as to form a first or overhead process stream 32 such as generally<br>
composed of unreacted synthesis gas and product dimethyl ether and, in accordance with<br>
certain preferred embodiments, consisting essentially of unreacted synthesis gas and product<br>
dimethyl ether, and a lower or bottoms stream 34 such as generally composed of methanol,<br>
water and some product dimethyl ether.<br>
[0027]       As described in greater detail below, the first or overhead process stream 32 can<br>
be forwarded to an appropriate dimethyl ether-synthesis gas separation section 36. The<br>
dimethyl ether-synthesis gas separation section 36 desirably results in or produces a stream 40<br>
such as generally containing unreacted synthesis gas and such as can desirably be introduced<br>
into, e.g., recycled to, the synthesis gas conversion reactor zone 22 via the above-identified<br>
line 20 for subsequent reaction.<br>
[0028]      The bottoms stream 34 of methanol, water and some product dimethyl ether can<br>
be sent via the line 42 to a second separation section 44, such as in the form of a dimethyl<br>
ether stripper, such as generally composed of a fractionator for the separation of lighter and<br>
heavier components, with dimethyl ether being relatively lighter than methanol and methanol<br>
being relatively lighter than water and other heavy impurities or byproducts (e.g., heavy<br>
alcohols).<br>
[0029]      In the second separation section 44, product dimethyl ether can be separated from<br>
other feed constituents such as to form a stream 46 comprising dimethyl ether. In addition, a<br>
side stream 50 such as generally composed of methanol can be formed. Further, a bottoms<br>
stream 52 such as composed of water and heavy impurities or byproducts (e.g., heavy<br>
alcohols). Such a bottom stream can be further treated for the removal of such heavy<br>
impurities and byproducts and the water can, if desired, be recycled to the synthesis gas<br>
generation unit or, alternatively utilized such as in irrigation or other agricultural uses.<br>
[0030]      As shown, at least a portion of the dimethyl ether from the stream 46 and, if<br>
desired, atl least a portion of the methanol from the stream 50, as signified by the line 54, can<br>
be introduced into an oxygenate conversion reactor zone 56 wherein such<br>
oxygenate-containing feedstock materials contact with an oxygenate conversion catalyst at<br>
reaction conditions effective to convert the oxygenate-containing feedstock to form an<br>
oxygenate conversion effluent stream comprising fuel gas hydrocarbons, light olefins, and C4+<br>
hydrocarbons, in a manner as is known in the art, such as, for example, utilizing a fluidized<br>
bed reactor.<br>
[0031]      In accordance with preferred embodiment, the feed to the oxygenate conversion<br>
reactor zone 56 desirably comprises 70 to 90 mol-% separated product dimethyl ether and 10<br>
to 30 mol-% methanol. Those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provided<br>
will understand and appreciate that the relative ratios of dimethyl ether, methanol, and water<br>
can generally vary dependent on factors such as the operating conditions used in the<br>
conversion of methanol to dimethyl ether and the separation steps used thereafter. For<br>
example, if starting with a stream that contains 100 mols of methanol and 30 mols of water<br>
(77 mol-% methanol) and men converting this stream to dimethyl ether at equilibrium over an<br>
acidic catalyst (e.g., gamma alumina) at 250°C, a product alternatively comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of, or consisting of approximately of 43.3 mols of dimethyl ether, 73.3 mols of<br>
water, and 13.5 mols of residual unconverted methanol is obtained. If only water is removed,<br>
the final product will contain 76.3 mol-% dimethyl ether in a mixture with 23.7 mol-%<br>
methanol. While no further separation of dimethyl ether and methanol is necessary, it may be<br>
desirable to farther separate the dimethyl ether from the methanol (to obtain up to close to<br>
100 mol-% dimethyl ether purity) in order to minimize hydrothermal effects on the<br>
oxygenate-to-olefin conversion catalyst; in such an event, the methanol thus separated can<br>
desirably be recycled to the methanol-to-dimethyl ether conversion stage.<br>
[0032]      Reaction conditions for the conversion of oxygenates to light olefins are known to<br>
those skilled in the art Preferably, in accordance with particular embodiments, reaction<br>
conditions comprise a temperature between 200° and 700°C, more preferably between 300°'<br>
and 600°C, and most preferably between 400° and 550°C. As will be appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provided, the reaction conditions are<br>
generally variable such as dependent on the desired products. For example, if increased<br>
ethylene production is desired, then operation at a reactor temperature between 475° and<br>
550°C and-more preferably between 500° and 520°C, may be preferred. If increased<br>
propylene production is desired, then operation at a reactor temperature between 350° and<br>
475°C and more preferably between 400° and 430°C may be preferred. The light olefins<br>
produced can have a ratio of ethylene to propylene of between 0.5 and 2.0 and preferably<br>
between 0.75 and 1.25. If a higher ratio of ethylene to propylene is desired, then the reaction<br>
temperature is generally desirably higher man if a lower ratio of ethylene to propylene is<br>
desired. In accordance with one preferred embodiment, a feed temperature range between<br>
120° and 210°C is preferred. In accordance with another preferred embodiment a feed<br>
temperature range of between 180° and 210°C is preferred. In accordance with one preferred<br>
embodiment, the temperature is desirably maintained below 210°C to avoid or minimize<br>
coking on associated processing equipment such as feed heaters and vaporizers.<br>
f0033]       The oxygenate conversion reactor zone 56 produces or results in an oxygenate<br>
conversion product or effluent stream 60 such as generally comprising fuel gas hydrocarbons,<br>
light olefins, and C4+ hydrocarbons. The oxygenate conversion effluent stream 60 can, if<br>
desired, be passed to an oxygenate conversion effluent stream treatment zone (not shown)<br>
such as known in the art for the appropriate desired product separation and recovery of and<br>
from such effluent stream.<br>
[0034]       The balance of the methanol from the stream 50, signified by the stream 62, is<br>
forwarded to the dimethyl ether-synthesis gas separation zone 36 such as described above and<br>
such as in the form of an absorber.<br>
[0035]      In such a dimethyl ether-synthesis gas separation-zone absorber, methanol is<br>
desirably employed as a solvent to absorb dimethyl ether from the unreacted synthesis gas<br>
such as to form the above-identified unreacted synthesis gas recycle stream 40 and also<br>
desirably results in or produces a stream 64 such as generally containing dimethyl ether and<br>
methanol. Moreover, such embodiment desirably employs internally generated methanol to<br>
effect such absorption of dimethyl ether. The dimethyl ether and methanol-containing stream<br>
64 can desirably subsequently be introduced into the second separation section 44 such as via<br>
the line 42.<br>
[0036]      As a result of such selective absorption of dimethyl ether using methanol, the<br>
unreacted synthesis gas recycle stream 40 will desirably be substantially free of dimethyl<br>
ether. More specifically, the unreacted synthesis gas recycle stream 40 will generally contain<br>
less than 1000 ppm of dimethyl ether and, in accordance with a preferred embodiment, less<br>
man 100 ppm of dimethyl ether. Thus, through such application of methanol absorption of<br>
dimethyl ether, the undesirable recycling of dimethyl ether through the synthesis gas<br>
conversion reactor zone 22 can be minimized or avoided, such as to increase or improve<br>
processing efficiency. Moreover, by avoiding or minimizing the amount of dimethyl ether<br>
recycled to the synthesis gas conversion reactor zone 22, the equilibrium reaction between<br>
methanol and dimethyl ether can desirably be driven, in accordance with a preferred<br>
embodiment, towards the production of additional, increased or further relative amounts of<br>
dimethyl ether.<br>
[0037]      As will be appreciated, with such recycle of unreacted synthesis gas, at least a<br>
portion of the synthesis gas unreacted on its initial pass through the synthesis gas conversion<br>
reactor zone 22 can react such as to form additional synthesis gas conversion reactor zone<br>
products including additional product dimethyl ether and such as can be appropriately<br>
processed through the subject process scheme, such as described above.<br>
[0038]       The present invention is described in further detail in connection with the<br>
following examples which illustrate or simulatevarious aspects involved in the practice of the<br>
invention. It is to be understood that all changes that come within the spirit of the invention<br>
are desired to be protected and thus the invention is not to be construed as limited by these<br>
examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0039]      Those skilled in the art and guided by the teachings herein provided will<br>
appreciate mat the use of dimethyl ether as a primary or principal oxygenate feedstock<br>
[0040]      to such an oxygenate conversion reactor section and, in accordance with certain<br>
preferred embodiments, and excluding residual amounts of other materials, as the primary or<br>
principal oxygenate feedstock and, in accordance with other certain preferred embodiments<br>
and excluding residual amounts of other materials, as the sole oxygenate feedstock, desirably<br>
produces or results in various processing advantages.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Reactor size<br>
[0041]      Methanol conversion to the light olefins ethylene and propylene at a 1:1 weight<br>
ratio necessitates the following processing reaction:<br>
24 CH3OH -+ 6C2H4 + 4 C3H6 + 24 H20<br>
In such processing, 24 mols of methanol feed becomes 34 mob of product effluent The use<br>
of dimethyl ether, in accordance with a preferred embodiment, for a similar conversion to the<br>
light olefins ethylene and propylene at a 1:1 weight ratio necessitates the following processing<br>
reaction:<br>
12 CH3-O-CH3 → 6 C2H4 + 4 C3H6 + 12 H20<br>
In such processing, 12 mols of dimethyl ether feed becomes 22 mols of product effluent<br>
[0042]      Thus, processing in accordance with the above reaction from dimethyl ether as<br>
opposed to reaction from methanol, both for the same number of mols of ethylene and<br>
propylene, results in a reduced number of mols of effluent (e.g., 22 mols versus 34 mols).<br>
Such reduction in the number of mols represents an equivalent reduction in the volumetric<br>
flow rate of effluent from the reactor, and thus a smaller reactor vessel, and also lower<br>
compression requirements of such effluent to downstream separation units. Moreover, as such<br>
a reduction in moles is accomplished by reducing the mols of water, the partial pressure of<br>
water is reduced from 70.6% (24/34) to 54.5% {12/22)in relative units. Such reduction in the<br>
relative amount of water can desirably result in improving the stability of the catalyst used in<br>
the conversion of oxygenates to light olefins<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Heat of Reaction<br>
[0043]      The heat of reaction, at 450°C, for the oxygenate conversion reaction of two mols<br>
of methanol to one mol of ethylene (plus water) is 5.5 kcal/mol. In contrast, for the<br>
conversion of one mol of dimethyl ether to one mol of ethylene (plus water) in accordance<br>
with one preferred embodiment, the heat of reaction is only 0.8 kcal/mol.<br>
[0044]      Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such a significant reduction in the heat<br>
of reaction can dramatically simplify and facilitate management of the adiabatic temperature<br>
rise realized within the oxygenate conversion reactor upon such reaction. Thus, in accordance<br>
with certain preferred embodiments, the oxygenate conversion reactor can desirably be free of<br>
cooling devices such as cooling coils an/or catalyst coolers, such as may typically be required<br>
in such oxygenate-to-olefin conversion reactors.<br>
[0045]      Embodiments, such-as described above, incorporating and utilizing synthesis gas<br>
conversion to form an effluent including product dimethyl ether, subsequent separation of<br>
such product dimethyl ether and conversion thereof to form light olefins desirably provides or<br>
results in improved processing such as by minimizing or at least reducing the size of required<br>
vessels.<br>
[0046]      The invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the<br>
absence of any element, part, step, component, or ingredient which is not specifically<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
[0047]       While in the foregoing detailed description this invention has been described in<br>
relation to certain preferred embodiments thereof, and many details have been set forth for<br>
purposes of illustration, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is<br>
susceptible to additional embodiments and that certain of the details described herein can be<br>
varied considerably without departing from the basic principles of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
