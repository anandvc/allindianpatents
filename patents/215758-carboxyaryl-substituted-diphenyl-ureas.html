"CARBOXYARYL SUBSTITUTED DIPHENYL UREAS"<br>
BAYER   CORPORATION,   100   Bayer   Road,   Pittsburgh,   Pennsylvania, 15205, U.S.A.,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
©"Carboxyarylf substituted diphenyl ureas as raf Joaasc inhibitors<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the use of a group of carboxvarvl substituted diphenyl ureas pryl ureas-in treating raf mediated diseases, and pharmaceutical compositions for use in such therapy.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The p21™ oncogene is a major contributor to the development and progression of human<br>
solid caitaers and is mutated in 30% of all human cancers (Bolton et al. Ann. Rep. Med<br>
Chem, 1994, 29, 165-74; Bos. Cancer Res. 1989, 49, 4682-9). In its normal, unmutated<br>
form, the ras protein is a key element of the signal transduction cascade directed by<br>
growth factor receptors in almost all tissues (Avrucbtit al. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994,19,<br>
.'&amp;*• 279-83). Biochemically, ras is a guanine nucleotide%nding protein, and cycling between<br>
a GTP-bound activated and a GDP-bound rcs0g form is strictly controlled by ras<br>
,	■          ^*'-W:"<br>
endogenous GTPase activity and other reguIatSry^proteins. In the ras mutants in cancer<br>
cells, the endogenous GTPase activity is alleviated and, therefore, the protein delivers<br>
constitutive growth signals to downstream effectors such as the enzyme raf kinase. This<br>
leads to the cancerous growth of the cells which carry these mutants (Magnuson et al,<br>
Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994, 5, 247-53).   It has been shown that inhibiting the effect of<br>
active rai- by inhibiting the raf kinase signa/mg pathway by administration of deactivating<br>
antibodies to raf kinase or by co-expression of dominant negative raf kinase or dominant<br><br>
negative MEK, the substrate of raf kinase, leads to the reversion of transformed cells to the normal growth phenotype (see: Daum et al. Trends Biochem. Set 1994, JP, 474-80; Fridman ut al. J. Biol. Chem, 1994, 269, 30105-S. Kolch et al, (Nature 1991,349, 426-28) have further indicated that inhibition of raf expression by antisense RNA blocks cell proliferation in membrane-associated oncogenes. Similarly, inhibition of raf kinase (by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides) has been correlated in vitro and in vivo with inhibition of the growth of a variety of human tumor types (Monia et al., Nat, Med. 1996, 2, 668-75).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides compounds which are inhibitors of the enzyme raf kinase. Since the enzyme is a downstream effector of p21fM, the inhibitors are useful in pharmaceutical compositions for human or veterinary use where inhibition of the raf kinase pathway is indicated, e.g., in the treatment of tumors and/or cancerous cell growth mediated by raf kinase.   In particular, the compounds are useful in the treatment of human or animal solid cancers, e.g., murine cancer, since the progression of these cancers is dependent upon the ras protein signal transduction cascade and therefore susceptible to treatment by interruption of the cascade, i.e., by inhibiting raf kinase. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention are useful in treating cancers, including solid cancers, such as, for example, carcinomas (e.g., of the lungs^pancreas, thyroid, bladder or colon), myeloid disorders (e.g., myeloid leukemia) or adenomas (e.g., villous colon adenoma).<br>
The presont invention therefore provides compounds generally described as aryl ureas, - including both aryl and heteroaryl analogues, which inhibit the raf kinase pathway. -3%* invention also provides a-method for trcating-ft-paf mediated disease state-in humans or mammals. Thus, the invention is directed to compounds which inhibit the enzyme raf kinase and also compounds and compositions ftnd methods for the treatment of cancerous cell growth mediated by raf kinase wherein a compound of the invention Formula I M-administcrcd or can be in the form of a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof.

General Preparative Methods<br>
The comjiounds of Formula I the invention may be prepared by the use of known chemical reactions and procedures, some from starting materials which are commercially available. Nevertheless, general preparative methods are provided below to aid one skilled in the art in synthesizing these compounds, with more detailed examples being provided in the Experimental section which follows.<br>
Substituted anilines may be generated using standard methods (March. Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed,; John Wiley: New York (1985). Larock. Comprehensive Organic rransformations; VCH Publishers: New Y$rk (1989)). As shown in Scheme I,<br>
aryl amines are commonly synthesized by reduc|im of nitroaiyls using a metal catalyst,<br>
such as INL, Pd, or Pt, and rfe or a hydride transf^sfgen^ such as formate, cyclohexadieue, or a borohydride (Rylander. Hydrogenation^Mjpthods; Academic Press: London, UK (1985)). Nitroaryls may also be directly reduced using a strong hydride source, such as UAIH4 (Seyden-Penne. Reductions by the Alumina- and BorohydHdes in Organic Synthesis; VCH Publishers: New York (1991)), or using a 2ero valent metal, such as fe, Sn or Cti, often in acidic media. Many methods exist for die synthesis of nitroaryls (March. Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed.; John Wiley: New York (1985). Larock. Comprehensive Organic Transformations; VCH Publishers: New York (1989)).<br>

Either nitroaryls or anilines may be converted Into the corresponding arenesulfonyl chloride (7) on treatment with chlorosalfonic acid, Reaction-ofthe sulfonyJ chloiide with :<br><br>
a fluoride source, such as KF then affords SUlfonyl fluoride (8). Reaction of sulfonyl fluoride 8 with triniethylsilyl trifluoromethane in the presence of a fluoride source, such as .tris(dimethylamino)sulfonium difluorotrimethylsiliconate (TASF) leads to tbe corresponding trifluoromethyisulfone (9). Alternatively, Sulfonyl chloride 7 may be reduced to the arenethiol (10), for example with zinc amalgum. Reaction of thiol 10 with CHCIF3 in the presence of base gives the difluororriethyl mercaptam (11), which may be oxidized to the sulfone (12) with any of a variety of oxidants, including Cr03-acetic anhydride (Sedovaetal, Zh.

As shown in Scheme IV, non-symmetrical V&gt;rea formation may involve reaction pfanaryl isocyanace (14) .with.an aryl amine.03), The heteroa^l isocyanate may be synthesized<br><br>
from a heteroaryl amine by treatment with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent, such as trichlorpmethyl chloroformate (diphosgene), bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate (triphosgene), or N,N ^arbonyldiimidazole (CD]). The isocyanate may also be derived from a heterocyclic carboxylic acid derivative, such as an ester, an acid halide or ant anhydride by a Curtius-type rearrangement. Thus, reaction of acid derivative 16 withan &amp;ride source, followed by rearrangement affords the isocyanate. The corresponding carboxylk: acid (17) may also be subjected to Curtius-type rearrangements using diphenylphosphory 1 azide pPPA) or a similar reagent.<br>
