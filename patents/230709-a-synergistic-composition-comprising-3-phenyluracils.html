Herbicidal mixtures based on 3-phenyluracils<br>
The present invention relates to herbicidally active compositions comprising 3-phenyluracils and at least one further herbicide and optionally at least one safener.<br>
In crop protection products, it is desirable in principle to increase the specificity and the reliability of the action of active compounds. In particular, it is desirable for the crop protection product to control the harmful plants effectively and, at the same time, to be tolerated by the useful plants in question.<br>
Various publications have described 3-phenyluracils as being highly effective herbicides. However, their compatibility with dicotyledonous crop plants such as cotton, oilseed rape and some graminaceous plants such as barley, millet, corn, rice, wheat and sugar cane is not always satisfactory, i.e. in addition to the harmful plants, the crop plants are also damaged to an extent which is not acceptable. It is possible to spare the useful plants by lowering the application rates; however the extent of the control of harmful plants is naturally also reduced.<br>
It is known that certain combinations of different herbicides with specific action result in an enhanced activity of a herbicide component by synergism. As a consequence, it is possible to reduce the application rates of herbicidally active compounds required for controlling the harmful plants.<br>
Furthermore, it is known that in some cases better crop plant compatibility can be achieved by joint application of specifically acting herbicides with organic active compounds, some of which are themselves herbicidally active. In these cases, the active compounds act as antidote or antagonist, and, owing to the fact that they can reduce or even prevent damage to the crop plants, they are also referred to as safeners.<br>
3-Phenyluracils of the formula I:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates in particular to compositions in the form of herbicidally active crop protection compositions comprising a herbicidally effective amount of at least one mixture of I with B and optionally C, as defined above, and at least one liquid and/or solid carrier and, if desired, one or more surfactants and, if desired, one or more further auxiliaries customary for crop protection compositions. The invention also relates to compositions in the form of a crop protection composition formulated as a 2-component composition comprising a first component which comprises the active compound A, a solid or liquid carrier and, if appropriate, one or more surfactants, and a second component which comprises at least one further herbicide B and optionally a safener C, a solid or liquid carrier and, if appropriate, one or more surfactants, where both components may additionally comprise further auxiliaries customary for crop protection compositions.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a method for controlling undesirable vegetation, in particular in crops of cereals, corn, soybeans, rice, oilseed rape, cotton, potatoes, groundnuts or in perennial crops, and also in crops which, by genetic engineering or by breeding, are resistant to one or more herbicides or to attack by insects. The invention also relates to a method for the desiccation or defoliation of plants. In the latter methods it is immaterial whether the herbicidally active compounds of components A) and B) and optionally C) are formulated and applied jointly or separately, and, in the case of separate application, in which order the application takes place.<br>
The organic moieties mentioned in the definition of the sub-stituents R2, R5, R6, R7 in formula I or as radicals on cyclo-alkyl, phenyl or heterocyclic rings are - like the term halogen -collective terms for individual enumerations of the individual group members. All hydrocarbon chains, i.e. all alkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkylamino, alkylthio, haloalkyl-thio, alkylsulfinyl, haloalkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, haloalkyl-sulfonyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups and corresponding moieties in larger groups such as alkylcarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, alkoxycarbonyl, etc., can be straight-chain or branched, the prefix Cn-Cm denoting in each case the possible number of carbon atoms in the group. Halogenated substituents preferably carry one, two, three, four or five identical or different halogen atoms. The term halogen denotes in each case flu-orine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
Examples of other meanings are:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
R6, R7 are in particular identical or different Ci-C6-alkyl radicals.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the compositions comprise at least one 3-phenyluracil I in which the variables R1 to R7 in formula I have the following meanings (hereinbelow also referred to as phenyluracils la):<br>

In the ready-to-use preparations, i.e. in the compositions according to the invention in the form of crop protection products, the components I and B and optionally C, in suspended, emulsified or dissolved form, can be present formulated jointly or separately. The use forms depend entirely on the intended use.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be applied, for example, in the form of directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The use forms depend on the intended use; in any case, they should ensure the finest possible distribution of the active compounds.<br>
Depending on the form in which the ready-to-use preparations are present in the compositions according to the invention, they comprise one or more liquid or solid carriers, if appropriate surfactants and if appropriate further auxiliaries which are customary for formulating crop protection products. The person skilled in the art is sufficiently familiar with the recipes for such formulations.<br>
The ready-to-use preparations comprise the components I and B and optionally C and auxiliaries which are customary for formulating crop protection products, which auxiliaries may also comprise a liquid carrier.<br>
Suitable inert additives with carrier function are essentially: mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point, such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. paraffins, tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, e.g. amines such as N-methylpyrrolidone, and water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the active compounds I, B or C, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alterna-<br><br>
tively, it is possible to prepare concentrates consisting of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emul-sifier and, if desired, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, of alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols and of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl-or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl polyglycol ethers, tributylphenyl polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether or polyoxypropylene alkyl ether, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitant grinding of the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders, or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the active compounds in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 95% by weight, of active ingredients. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
The compounds according to the invention can, for example, be formulated as follows:<br><br>
20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are dissolved in a mixture composed of 80 parts by weight of alkylated benzene, 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 8 to 10 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of oleic acid N-monoethanolamide, 5 parts by weight of calcium dode-cylbenzenesulfonate and 5 parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are dissolved in a mixture composed of 40 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 30 parts by weight of iso-butanol, 20 parts by weight of the adduct of 7 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of isooctylphenol and 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
2	0 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound<br>
mixture in question are dissolved in a mixture composed of 25<br>
parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 65 parts by weight of a<br>
mineral oil fraction of boiling point 210 to 280°C and 10<br>
parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to<br>
1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts<br>
by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives<br>
an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the<br>
active ingredient.<br>
20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are mixed thoroughly with 3 parts by weight of sodium diisobutylnaphthalenesulfonate, 17 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a lignosulfonic acid from a sulfite waste liquor and 60 parts by weight of pulverulent silica gel, and the mixture is ground in a hammer mill. Finely distributing the mixture in 20 000 parts by weight of water gives a spray mixture which comprises 0.1% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
3	parts by weight of the active compound or active compound<br>
mixture in question are mixed with 97 parts by weight of<br>
finely divided kaolin. This gives a dust which comprises 3%<br>
by weight of the active ingredient.<br><br>
VI	20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are mixed intimately with 2 parts by weight of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, 8 parts by weight of fatty alcohol polyglycol ether, 2 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a phenol-urea-formaldehyde condensate and 68 parts by weight of a paraffinic mineral oil. This gives a stable oily dispersion.<br>
VII	1 part by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question is dissolved in a mixture composed of 7 0 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 20 parts by weight of ethoxylated isooctylphenol and 10 parts by weight of ethoxy-lated castor oil. This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br>
Villi part by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question is dissolved in a mixture composed of 80 parts by weight of cyclohexanone and 20 parts by weight of Wettol® EM 31 (nonionic emulsifier based on ethoxylated castor oil). This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br>
The components I and B and optionally C can be formulated jointly or separately.<br>
The components I and B and optionally C can be applied jointly or separately, simultaneously or successively, before, during or after emergence of the plants.<br>
If the active compounds I and B and optionally C are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, it is possible to use application methods in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed with the aid of sprayers in such a way that the leaves of the sensitive crop plants are as far as possible unaffected, whereas the active compounds reach the leaves of the undesirable plants growing underneath or the uncovered soil surface (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
The required application rate of the composition of the pure active compounds, i.e. of I and B and optionally C without formulation auxiliary, depends on the density of the undesired vegetation, on the development stage of the plants, on the climatic conditions of the location where the composition is used and on the application method. In general, the application rate of I and B and optionally C is from 0.001 to 3 kg/ha, preferably from 0.005 to 2 kg/ha and in particular from 0.01 to 1 kg/ha of active substance.<br><br>
The required application rates of the 3-phenyluracils I are generally in the range from 0.1 g/ha to 1 kg/ha and preferably in the range from 1 g/ha to 500 g/ha or from 5 g/ha to 500 g/ha of active substance.<br>
The compositions are applied to the plants mainly by foliar spraying. Application can be carried out by customary spraying techniques using, for example, water as carrier and spray liquor rates of from about 100 to 1 000 1/ha (for example from 300 to 400 1/ha). Application of the herbicidal compositions by the low-volume and the ultra-low-volume method is possible, as is their application in the form of microgranules.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention are suitable for controlling common harmful plants in useful plants, in particular in crops such as wheat, barley, oats, corn, soybean, sorghum, rice, oilseed rape, cotton, potatoes, dry beans,  groundnuts or in perennial crops. In another embodiment of the invention, they are useful for controlling the whole vegetation, i. e. they act as a total weedkiller. Futhermore, in another emodiment of the present invention, the compositions are useful for controlling undesirable vegetation in forestry.<br>
Moreover, it may be useful to apply the compositions according to the invention jointly as a mixture with other crop protection products, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Non-phyto-toxic oils and oil concentrates may also be added.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can also be used in crop plants which are resistant to one or more herbicides owing to genetic engineering or breeding or which are resistant to attack by insects owing to genetic engineering or breeding. Suitable are for example crop plants preferably corn, wheat, barley, sunflower, rice, canola, soybeans which are resistant to herbicidal EPSP synthase inhibitors, such as, for example, glyphosate, to herbicidal glutamine synthase inhibitors, such as, for example, glufosinate, to herbicidal protoporphyrinogen-IX oxidase inhibitors, such as, for example, butafenacil, or to herbicidal ALS inhibitors, such as, for example, imazamethabenz, imazamox, imazapic, imazapyr, imazaquin, imazethapyr, or crop plants which, owing to introduction of the gene for Bt toxin by genetic modification, are resistant to attack by certain insects.<br><br>
Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention which comprise at least one phenyluracil of the formula I and at least one herbicide B have better herbicidal activity against harmful plants than would have been expected by the herbicidal activity of the individual compounds. In other words, the joint action of phenyluracil I and herbicide B results in an enhanced activity against harmful plants in the sense of a synergy effect (synergism) . For this reason, the mixtures can, based on the individual components, be used at lower application rates to achieve a herbicidal effect comparable to the individual components.<br>
Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention which, in addition to the phenyluracil I and the herbicide B comprise an active compound from group C are better tolerated by useful plants than the respective mixture of 3-phenyluracil I + herbicide B without active compound of group C.<br>
The 3-phenyluracils of the formula I can be prepared by the preparation processes disclosed by the earlier application WO 2001/83459. With respect to the preparation of individual compounds, reference is made to the examples of WO 2001/83459. Compounds which are not explicitly disclosed in this document can be prepared in an analogous manner.<br>
Use Examples<br>
The effect of the herbicidal mixtures according to the invention of components I and B and, if appropriate, C on the growth of undesirable plants compared to the herbicidally active compounds alone was demonstrated by the following greenhouse experiments<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were first grown to a height of 3 to 20 cm, depending on the plant habit, and only then treated. Here, the herbicidal compositions were suspended or emulsified in water as distribution medium and sprayed using finely distributing nozzles.<br>
The respective components I and B and/or C were formulated as 10% by weight strength emulsion concentrate and introduced to the spray liquor with the amount of solvent system used for applying the active compound. In the examples, the solvent used was water.<br>
The test period extended over 21 days. During this time, the plants were tended, and their response to the treatments with active compound was evaluated.<br><br>
The evaluation for the damage caused by the chemical compositions was carried out using a scale from 0 to 100%, compared to the untreated control plants. Here, 0 means no damage and 100 means complete destruction of the plants.<br>
In the examples below, the value E which is to be expected if the activity of the individual compounds is just additive was calculated using the method of S. R. Colby (1967) "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations". Weeds 15, p. 22 ff.<br>
E = X + Y - (X-Y/100)<br>
where<br>
X = effect in percent using active compound I at an application rate a;<br>
Y = effect in percent using active compound B at an application rate b;<br>
E = expected effect (in %) of I + B at application rates a + b.<br>
If the value calculated in this manner is higher than the value E calculated according to Colby, a synergistic effect is present.<br>
