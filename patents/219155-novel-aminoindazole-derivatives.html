The compounds for which R5 and R6 are, independently of one another, chosen from the following radicals: halogen, CN, N02, NH2, OH, COOH, C(0)OR8, -0-C(0)R8, NR8R9, NHC(0)R8, C(0)NR8R9, NHC(S)R8, C(S)NR8R9, SR8, S(0)R8, S02R8, NHS02R8, S02NR8R9, -O-SO2R8, -SO2-O-R8, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, (l-6C)alkyl, (l-6C)alkoxy, aryl, aiyl(l-6C)alkyl, heteroaryl, heteroaryl(l-6C)alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or adamantyl; these radicals optionally being substituted by 1 or more substituents chosen from halogen, CN, NO2, NH2, OH, OR 10, COOH, C(O)OR10, -O-C(O)R10, NR10R11, NHC(O)R10, C(O)NR10Rll, NHC(S)R10, C(S)NR10R11, SR10, S(O)R10, SO2R10, NHSO2R10, SO2NR10Rll, -O-SO2R10, -SO2-O-RIO, aryl, heteroaryl, formyl, oxo, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy or (1-6C)alkyl; can be obtained by reactions involving the chemistry of palladium: Suzuki (A. Suzuki, Pure Appl. Chem., 63, 419-22 (1991), Stille (J. Stille, Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 25, 508-24 (1986)), Heck (R. F. Heck, Org. React, 27, 345-90 (1982)), Sonogashira, (K. Sonogashira, Synthesis, 777 (1977)), Buckwald (S.L. Buckwald, Ace. Chem. Re., 3J_, 805 (1998)), from the corresponding halogenated derivatives.<br>
For this, it is necessary to protect the reactive functional groups. Thus, the OH, SH, COOH and NH2 functional groups must be protected before carrying out the coupling. The protective groups are introduced according to any method known to a person skilled in the art and in particular those described by T.W. Greene, Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, J. Wiley-Interscience Publication (1999). It is preferable to protect the nitrogen in the 1-position with groups such as tert-butoxycarbonyl or silicon derivatives. The choice will preferably be made of a terf-butyldimethylsilyl or triisopropylsilyl silyl group which can be removed by fluoride anions or with acetic<br><br><br><br>
When one of the R5 or R6 groups involved in the coupling using the chemistry of palladium itself comprises a reactive functional group, such as hydroxyl, amine, thiol or acid or generally includes a heteroatom, it is also necessary to protect the latter before carrying out the coupling with palladium. Thus, for example, a phenol functional group will be introduced in the protected form (O-benzyl, for example) from the chlorinated derivative, the nitrogen in the 1-position being protected as explained previously:<br><br>
The benzyl group will subsequently be removed, for example by treatment with trimethylsilyl iodide at reflux in acetonitrile. Protection can also be carried out by a trimethylsilylethoxymethyl group which can be cleaved by tetrabutylammonium fluoride at reflux in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane. (J. P. Whitten, J. Org. Chem., 51, 1891 (1986); B. H. Lipshutz, Tetrahedron Lett., 4095 (1986)) or by 2N hydrochloric acid in methanol or ethanol at reflux.<br>
When R5 and R6 are, independently of one another, an aryl and a halogen, the aryl functional group is introduced from coupling with palladium to a brominated position, the nitrogen in the 1- and 3-positions being appropriately protected. Preferably, Pr represents a trimethylsilylethoxymethyl and Pr' represents an n-butylcarbonyl group which forms, with the nitrogen, an n-butylamide. The stage of deprotecting the amide is carried out in the presence of ethanolamine at reflux for one week in DMF. This cleavage can also be carried out with stannous chloride in ethanol (R J Griffin, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 1992, 1811-1819) or else sodium methoxide in methanol (Y. Furukawa, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1968,16, 1076) or any other alkoxide in the corresponding alcohol.<br><br><br>
When R5 and R6 are, independently of one another, an aryl and a halogen, the aryl functional group is introduced from coupling withv palladium to a brominated position, the nitrogen in the 1- and 3-positions being appropriately protected. Preferably, Pr represents a trimethylsilylethoxymethyl and Pr' represents an n-butylcarboxy group which forms, with the nitrogen, an n-butylamide. The electrophilic substitution is carried out, for example, with nitronium tetrafluoroborate (NO2BF4). The coupling of the 5-position is performed using palladium chemistry (Suzuki, Heck or Sojiogashira coupling). The 7-position is functionalized, as a function of the desired substituents, by reductions, halogenations to introduce a bromine, or coupling by palladium chemistry (Suzuki, Heck or Sonogashira coupling) to introduce aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or acetylenic functions. The stage of deprotecting the amide is carried out in the presence of ethanolamine at reflux for one week in DMF. This cleavage can also be carried out with stannous chloride in ethanol (R J Griffin, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 1992, 1811-1819) or else sodium methoxide in methanol (Y. Furukawa, Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1968, 16, 1076) or any other alkoxide in the corresponding alcohol. The deprotection in the 3-position produces the NH2 functional group, which can react with the necessary groups to introduce the desired substitutions into the 3-position as described in the following pages.<br><br><br>

The activities were determined by measuring the inhibition of the phosphorylation of the tau protein in adult rat cortex sections.<br>
Cortex sections with a thickness of 300^im are prepared from male OFA rats (Iffa-Credo) aged 8-10 weeks, sacrificed by decapitation. They are incubated in 5 ml of DMEM medium comprising pyruvate and glucose 4.5 g/1 at 37°C for 40 min. The sections are subsequently washed twice with the medium, distributed in microtubes (50(il in 500jal of medium, with or without test compounds) and incubated at 37°C with stirring. Two hours later, the experiment is halted by centrifiiging. The sections are lyzed, sonicated and centrifuged at 18300g for 15 min at 4°C. The concentration of proteins in the supernatant is determined by a commercial assay (BCA Protein Assay, Pierce) based on the Lowry method.<br>
The samples, denatured beforehand at 70°C for 10 min, are separated on 4-12% Bis- _ tris vertical gel in the presence of MOPS-SDS buffer and are electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunolabeling is carried out with the monoclonal antibody AD2, which specifically recognizes the Ser396/404 phosphorylated epitopes of the tau protein. The immunoreactive proteins are visualized by addition of a second antibody directed against mouse IgGs and coupled to peroxidase and of a chemoluminescent substrate. The autoradiograms obtained are finally quantified using the 'GeneTools' software from Syngene (GeneGnome, Ozyme) to determine an IC50 value.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) exhibit a highly advantageous activity and in particular some compounds have an IC50 value of less than 100 jiM.<br>
