				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates  to bearing apparatus  More<br>
particularly, this invention is a new bearing assembly combination which includes an insert with a strap having a coefficient of thermal expansion higher than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the housing of the bearing assembly.<br>
Self-aligning housed bearing units are used where they are subjected to misalignment. Also, often the housing in which the self-aligning housed bearing units are placed is made of material having a higher coefficient of expansion than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the bearing material. When these conditions exist, special bearing mounting provisions are required to eliminate the detrimental, high stresses imposed by misalignment and the possible loss of bearing retention due to unequal thermal growth. Thus, a self-aligning bearing assembly which includes structure which compensates to offset the effects of unequal thermal growth between the bearing and the housing so that the bearing assembly remains firmly fixed within the housing under all expected thermal conditions is highly desirable.<br><br>
The foregoing illustrates limitations known to exist in present devices and methods. Thus, it is apparent that it would be advantageous to provide an alternative directed to overcoming one or more of the limitations set forth above. Accordingly, a suitable alternative is provided including features more fully disclosed hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect of the invention, this is accomplished by<br><br>
providing a bearing apparatus with a stationary housing made of a material having a predetermined coefficient of thermal expansion. Included in the housing is a bearing having a ring with a spherical outer surface. An insert is mounted between the outer surface of the bearing and the inner surface of the housing. The insert comprises an annular strap holder with an annular concave spherical inside surface adapted to slidably retain the spherical outer surface of the bearing ring. A strap having a coefficient of thermal expansion higher than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the housing is mounted on the annular strap holder.<br>
The foregoing and other aspects will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawing figures.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a bearing apparatus comprising a housing (10) with an annular inside surface (28) forming a bore and a bearing having a ring (16) with an annular outside surface (44) radially spaced from the annular inside surface (28) of the housing; characterized in that an annular strap holder (32) is located in the space separating the said inside surface (28) of the housing and said outside surface (44) of the bearing, the strap holder (32) having an annular inside surface (41) slidably retaining said bearing ring (16) and an annular outside surface (56) and there being a strap (34) mounted on said outside surface (56) of the strap holder and having a coefficient of thermal expansion higher than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the housing (10), the radially outside surface of the strap (34) being in contact with said inside surface (28) of the housing (10).<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE Accompanying DRAWING FIGURES<br>
Fig. 1 is a side elevation view, partly in section, of the bearing assembly;<br>
Fig. 2 is an exploded view.of the components of the insert; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the insert.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In the various drawing figures, like parts are referred to by 1ike numbers.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the bearing assembly includes a housing 10 which is made of material having a predetermined coefficient of thermal expansion and includes a base 14 having means (not shown) for attachment of the assembly to a supporting surface. A ball bearing is included in the bearing assembly. The ball bearing has an outer ring 16 and an inner ring 18. Balls 20, retained by a conventional ball cage 22, are in rolling contact with raceway 24 on the inner ring 18 and raceway 26 on outer ring 16.<br>
The stationary housing 10 has a bore 28 extending entirely through the stationary housing. The surface of the housing bore has a constant inside diameter throughout its length, hence, the housing can be manufactured much easier and much cheaper than the<br><br>
housing bores which have concave or spherically shaped inside surfaces.<br>
An insert 30 is fixedly retained in the housing 10. The insert may be press fit or have an interference fit in the housing 10. The insert 30 includes an annular strap holder 32 and an annular strap 34. The strap 34 is made of a material having a coefficient of thermal expansion higher than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the housing 10. The outside radially surfaces 36 and 38 of the annular strap holder and the radially outside surface 40 of the strap are in contact with the stationary housing 10 inner surface.<br>
The annular strap holder 32 has an annular concave spherical inside surface 41. The bearing ring 16 is slidably retained in the insert 30 and has a spherical outer surface 44 corresponding in shape to the annular strap holder concave spherical inside surface<br>
41,<br>
Seals 46 and 48 may be fit into grooves 50 and 52, respectively, adjacent each axial end of the ring 16.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, the strap holder 32 has an annular groove 54. The axially extending base surface 56 and the axially spaced radially extending end surfaces 58 and 59 of the annular groove are shaped to provide an annular groove of constant depth along its circumference and throughout its axial length.<br><br>
The dimensions of the radial thickness and axial length of the strap 34 are substantially the same as the dimensions of the two axially spaced radially extending surfaces and axially extending base surface, respectively, of the strap holder groove 54. The circumferential ends 60 and 62 of the strap 34 are circumfer-entially spaced apart to allow for thermal expansion.<br>
If desired, the annular strap holder may be made of two identical semi-circular halves 64 and 66. The strap holder may be made of material that can effectively be made into the configuration required and possesses the physical properties needed to meet the demands of bearing applications. Many polymers or powder metal alloys could be used to make the strap holder depending on specific application operating conditions.<br>
The strap 34 is made of a material which is capable of deforming and snapping into the strap holder groove 54 to assure the assembly remains together prior to installation and to provide an expansion compensator to offset the effects of unequal thermal growth between the insert 30 and the housing 10. The strap could be made of materials, such as nylon or aluminum, that have high coefficients of thermal expansion.<br>
A preassembled insert and bearing can be press fit into a standard bearing housing. At room temperature, the interference fit provides typical retention and the spherical interfaces allow for alignment. As operating temperatures rise and the housing<br><br>
expands, the insert will maintain installation interference due to the more rapid expansion of the strap 34. The strap material can be selected on a case by case basis depending on the housing material, and anticipated operating temperatures.<br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A bearing apparatus comprising a housing (10) with an annular inside surface (28) forming a bore and a bearing having a ring (16) with an annular outside surface (44) radially spaced from the annular inside surface (28) of the housing; characterized in that an annular strap holder (32) is located in the space separating the said inside surface (28) of the housing and said outside surface (44) of the bearing, the strap holder (32) having an annular inside surface (41) slidably retaining said bearing ring (16) and an annular outside surface (56) and there being a strap (34) mounted on said outside surface (56) of the strap holder and having a coefficient of thermal expansion higher than the coefficient of thermal expansion of the housing (10), the radially outside surface of the strap (34) being in contact with said inside surface (28) of the housing (10).<br>
