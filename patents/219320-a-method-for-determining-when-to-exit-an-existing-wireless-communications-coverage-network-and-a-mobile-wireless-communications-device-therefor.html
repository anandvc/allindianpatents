				<td>        Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to wireless communications devices and,<br>
more particularly, to a system and method for making a determination of whether to stay with<br>
an exiting wireless communications coverage network.<br>
10      2.         Background<br>
A key concern for wireless communications devices (referred to herein<br>
interchangeably as a mobile handset) is acquiring coverage with the highest probability of<br>
providing a good grade of service. Within a cellular network, often a mobile handset finds<br>
itself in a coverage zone on an edge of a cell site, often characterized by a low power limit on<br>
15      the forward link (i.e., transmission from the cell site or base station), and sometimes a non<br>
detected reverse link (i.e., transmission from the mobile handset). This coverage zone is<br>
sometimes referred to as the Grey Zone.<br>
To better understand the problems associated with the Grey Zone, FIG. 1A<br>
illustrates a mobile handset 100 operating in a cellular network with al least one base station<br>
20       105. Base station 105 transits a signal represented by signal strength 110 that diminishes<br>
log-normally as a function of distance. FIG. 1A shows "distance from base station" plotted<br>
along the horizontal axis. However it will be understood by those of skill in the art that other<br>
factors besides distance to the base station 105 effect the signal strength received by the<br>
handset. For example, an object such as a hill, or a car may effect the signal strength. As<br>
25       another example, variations in air density can effect the signal strength. Distance from the<br>
base station 105 is used herein as a shorthand for all of the cases that can effect the signal<br>
strength.<br>
At some position 115, the mobile handset 100 may be too far from the base<br>
station 105, such that the base station 105 cannot detect the mobile handset's 300<br>
30      transmission. The base station 105 is less limited in the power it can transmit than the mobile<br>
handset 100 and therefore can send a strong enough signal that the mobile handset 100 can<br>
detect, but at the same time the base station 105 may not detect a signal from the mobile<br>
handset 100.   In this situation where only the base station 105 is transmitting detectable<br>
signals, the mobile handset 100 cannot make a call. This area is called the Gray Zone.<br>
35                              To overcome this problem, current wireless standards implement a strict<br>
threshold, that if met, switches the mobile handset 100 from the current network (i.e., base<br>
station 105) in search of another network. For example, the Mobile Station-Base Station<br>
Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Spread Spectrum Systems (commonly know as<br>
1<br><br>
WO2004/037906 PCT/US2003/040650<br>
least two base stations 105 and 135. As discussed above, base station 105 transmits a signal<br>
represented by signal strength 110, and similarly, base station 135 transmits a signal<br>
represented by signal strength 140. Both signal strengths 110 and 140 diminish log-normally<br>
as a function of distance.<br>
5                              Most current methods use the SNR to select between base station 105 and<br>
base station 135. For example if the mobile handset 100 were located at distance 145 (i.e.,<br>
significantly, closer to base station 105 than base station 135), then the SNR would clearly<br>
favor base station 105 and the mobile handset 100 would select base station 105. Similarly, at<br>
distance 150, the mobile handset 100 would select base station 135.<br>
10                              As with the situation described above with reference to FIG. 1A, because the<br>
SNR is a function of position, among other factors, end a mobile handset 100 can change<br>
position rapidly, using strictly a comparison of SNR of competing base stations 105 and 135<br>
could result in changing base stations too rapidly, and potentially degrading the quality of<br>
seivice. To illustrate, consider a mobile handset 100 traveling on a windy road that at time<br>
15      one is at distance 135. At some short time later, the mobile handset 100 is at distance 160,<br>
As it continues its travel, the mobile handset 100 vacillates between distance 155 and distance<br>
160. The SNR for distance 155 may favor base station 105, while the SNR for distance 160<br>
may favor base station 135.   The mobile handset 100 would then constantly switch between<br>
the two base stations. The constant switching may result in occupying additional resources,<br>
20       increased standby time, and other problems, ultimately decreasing service quality. This<br>
possibility must be weighed against the benefit of the slightly more beneficial SNR._ When, as<br>
in distance 155 and distance l60, the SNR difference is likely very small, the possible costs of<br>
switching outweigh the benefits.<br>
To overcome this potential over-switching problem, it is known in the art to<br>
25      not simply compare the SNRs, but rather to compare the SNRs plus some Delta. For<br>
example, if the mobile handset 100 is at distance 160 and currently using base station 105, the<br>
mobile handset 100 would change to base station 135 if and only if:<br>
SNR (at base station 105) + Delta 
30<br>
Thus, the Delta makes it preferable to slay on the existing base station, unless<br>
and until the signal quality drops to a point where it is clearly less desirable than another<br>
received base station signal.   The Delta effectively sets up two thresholds 165 and 170, where<br>
the mobile handset 100 will always select base station 105 if the mobile handset 100 is<br>
35       located to the left of threshold 165 and base station 135 if located to the right of threshold<br>
170. If the mobile handset 100 is located between thresholds 165 and 170, the mobile handset<br>
100 will not switch.<br>

An example of this method would include adjusting the indicator through<br>
add men and subtraction. This example comprises: sampling received input power levels:<br>
assigning an adjustment factor based on a comparison of the received input power level<br>
samples and a predetermined baseline threshold value; beginning at a predetermined initial<br>
5      value, maintaining a running sum indicator of the value; and exiting the existing wireless<br>
communications coverage network based on the running sum indicator. Further refinements<br>
to the method include assigning a value of "-l "to the adjustment factor if the received input<br>
power level is greater than a predetermined minimum value or assigning a value of "+l" to<br>
the adjustment factor if the received input power level is less than a predetermined minimum<br>
10       value.   Thus the running sum indicator will decrement if most of the received input power<br>
level samples are greater than the predetermined minimum value. Likewise, the running sum<br>
indicator will increment if most of the received input power level samples are less than the<br>
predetermined minimum value. Ultimately, the running sum indicator is an indication of the<br>
history of the received input power level. Based on this history a decision is made whether to<br>
15       exit the existing coverage network. If for example, the running sum indicator reaches or<br>
exceeds a preset value then the mobile handset may exit the existing coverage network<br>
The method is not limited to simple addition and subtraction as a means for<br>
numerically indicating the history of the received input power level. For example, the method<br>
could adjust the indicator through a multiplication and division adjustment factor. In this<br>
20       example, the method may set an indicator value at an Initial value. The indicator value would<br>
be multiplied by an adjustment factor of the received input power level is less than a<br>
predetermined minimum value or divided by an adjustment factor if the received input power<br>
level is greater than a predetermined minimum value.   Thus the indicator will increase if<br>
most of the received input power level samples are less than the predetermined minimum<br>
25       value, or decrease if most of the received, input peer level samples are more than the<br>
predetermined minimum value. Ultimately, the indicator is an indication of the history of the<br>
received input power level. Based on this history a decision is made whether to exit the<br>
existing coverage network. If for example, the running sum reaches or exceeds a preset value,<br>
then the mobile handset may exit the existing coverage network.<br>
30                              In the examples discussed above, the method may increase its sensitivity by<br>
weighing the adjustment factors differently based on the distance from the threshold. For<br>
example instead of assigning a "+/- " to the adjustment factor, the method may assign a "+/-<br>
3" if the detected signal is a certain distance from the threshold. Thus, if the method<br>
experiences a series of very weak signals, the indicator would increase more rapidly (as<br>
35       compared to the "+/-" example) and reach or exceed a preset value, causing the system to<br>
exit the existing coverage network. Similarly, the multiplication and division, adjustment<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present method solves the problems associated with the Grey Zone (i.e.,<br>
maintaining the best service while avoiding premature or late exit) by compiling the received<br>
5       input power, comparing the compiled received input power to a threshold, adjusting an<br>
indicator depending on that comparison, and determining whether to exit the existing<br>
coverage network or not based on the indicator. While the invention is described below in the<br>
context of a mobile handset in a cellular network, it may also be used in any device that<br>
maintains a two-way communication via wireless signals. Examples of two-way<br>
10      communications via wireless signals include but are not limited to Global System for Mobile<br>
Communications (GSM) communications systems, Institute of Electrical Engineers, Inc.<br>
(IEEE) standard number 802.11 compliant communications systems, and Code Division<br>
Multiple Access (CDMA) communications systems.<br>
Before describing the various preferred embodiments, it is helpful to look at<br>
15      the signal strength received by a mobile handset. FIG. 2 is a graph showing received input<br>
power level signal strength for a mobile handset plotted against the distance of the device<br>
from a base station. The received input power level signal strength is equal to the theoretical<br>
received input level plus noise 220 and is the stem of the total mean received power and is<br>
normalized to a value of one, thus it has no actual units. FIG. 2 assumes the signal strength<br>
20      falls off log normally with distance from the base station. While this assumption is common<br>
to one of ordinary skill in the art, it is not necessary for the function or operation of the<br>
present invention.    A baseline threshold 235 is also shown in FIG. 2. The value of the<br>
baseline threshold 235 can be selected according to the desired performance of the system.<br>
One possible value is the approximate threshold for minimally satisfactory operation of the<br>
25      mobile handset in the Grey Zone. That is, sample values less than the threshold indicate a<br>
trend toward unsatisfactory operation in the Grey Zone, and values greater than the threshold<br>
indicate a trend toward satisfactory operation in the Gray Zone. The device should exit if it is<br>
consistently operating below the baseline threshold 235.<br>
Another possible way of setting the threshold is using the following open<br>
30       loop estimate of required power for an access channel transmission derived from TIA/EIA-<br>
95-B, Sec. 6.1.2.3.1:<br>
K-Mean Pwr Revd by Mobile(dBm) =Mean Pwr Tms by Mobile (dBm)<br>
where K=73 dBm for Cellular CDMA and the maximum power transmitted by the Mobile for<br>
Cellular CDMA is 24 dBm.<br>
35                              The above equation yields a threshold of-97 dBm for Cellular CDMA<br>
operating under the IS-95-B standard; thus the mobile handset can set an appropriate<br>
threshold level that would ensure an access channel transmission. Other communications<br>

power level sample values from the transceiver 302._ The first comparison circuit 310<br>
measures the difference between each received input power level sample value and the<br>
baseline threshold 235 value, and in response supplies decrement and increment control<br>
signals. The first comparison circuit 310 supplies a comparison signal responsive to the<br>
5      comparison of the input power levels signal to a threshold. The comparison signal is in the<br>
form of a first decrement control signal on line 312 and a first increment control signal or line<br>
314.   The first comparison circuit 310 supplies a first decrement control signal on line 312 if<br>
the received input power level sample value is greater than, or equal to the baseline threshold<br>
235 value. Alternately, the fist comparison circuit 310 supplies a first increment control<br>
10      signal on line 314 if the received input power level sample value is less than the baseline<br>
threshold 235 value.<br>
The calculator circuit 306 also includes an adjustment circuit in the form of a<br>
counting circuit 315 having inputs accepting the decrement and increment control signals on<br>
lines 312 and 314 respectively, maintaining a running total responsive to the decrement and<br>
15       increment control signals, comparing the naming total to a predetermined terminal value, and<br>
in response to the comparison, supplying the exit control signal 308.<br>
The counting circuit 315 includes a subtracting circuit 316, an adding circuit<br>
318_ and a totalize 320. The subtracting circuit 316 accepts the first decrement control signal<br>
and has an output supplying a first predetermined adjustment factor on line 322. The adding<br>
30       circuit 318 accepts the first increment control signal and has an output supplying a second<br>
predetermined adjustment on line 324.<br>
The totalize 320 accepts the first and second adjustment factors and uses<br>
them to maintain the running total starting at a predetermined initial value. A second<br>
comparing circuit is located within the totalize 320 in this embodiment The totalize 320<br>
25       compares the running total to the terminal value, and when the running total is greater than, or<br>
equal to the terminal value, the totalize 320 supplies the exit control signal 308. To maintain<br>
the running total, the totalize 320 decrements the running total for each first adjustment and<br>
increments the running total for each second adjustment factor. The terminal value can be<br>
selected according to the desired performance of the system 300. However, the terminal<br>
30      value should be coordinated with the adjustment factors. That is, the terminal value should be<br>
high enough that a series of second adjustment factors (from received input power level<br>
sample values below the baseline threshold 253 value), not indicative of consistent operation<br>
below the baseline threshold 235, does not cause the turning total to equal or exceed the<br>
terminal value. In a similar manner, the terminal value should be low enough that a longer<br>
35       series of second adjustment factors indicating consistent operation below the threshold value,<br>
does cause the running total to equal or exceed the terminal value.<br><br>
WO2004/037906 PCT/US2003/040650<br>
values associated with a higher certainty of operation in areas with significantly better or<br>
worse coverage.<br>
Therefore. returning to FIG. 3, the first comparison circuit 310 compares<br>
received input powered level samples to the supplemental threshold values, as well as the<br>
5      baseline threshold 235 value. The first comparison circuit 310 then supplies: the first<br>
decrement control signal 312 for each received input power level sample value greater than,<br>
or equal to the baseline threshold value find less than, or equal to the first supplemental<br>
threshold 245 value: a second decrement control signal, not shown, for each received input<br>
power level sample value greater than the first supplemental threshold 245 value; the first<br>
10      increment control signal 314 for each received input power level sample value less than the<br>
baseline threshold 215 value and greater than, or equal the second supplemental threshold 250<br>
value; and, a second increment control signal, not shown, for each received input power level<br>
sample value less than the second supplemental threshold 250 value.<br>
The subtracting circuit 316 accepts the first and second decrement control<br>
15      signals on line 312, supplies the first adjustment factor in response to the first decrement<br>
control signal, and supplies a third predetermined adjustment factor an response to the second<br>
determent control signal. Both adjustment factors are supplied on line 322.<br>
The adding circuit 318 accepts the first and second increment control signals,<br>
supplies the second adjustment factor in response to the first increment control signal, and<br>
20      supplies a fourth predetermined adjustment factor in response in the second increment control<br>
signal. Both adjustment factors are supplied on Line 524.<br>
The totalize 320 accepts the first, second, third and fourth adjustment<br>
factors, decrements the running total for each first and third adjustment factor, and increments<br>
the running total for each second and fourth adjustment factor. The totalize 320 decrements<br>
25      the running total for each first and third adjustment factor only if the running total is greater<br>
than the minimum total value.<br>
The third and fourth adjustment factors are larger than the first and second<br>
adjustment factors to reflect the greater certainty associated with the third arid fourth<br>
adjustment factors. Therefore, the running total moves more quickly toward or away from the<br>
30      terminal value in response to these adjustment factors.<br>
In one aspect of the system 300, the absolute value of the third adjustment<br>
factor equals the absolute value of the fourth adjustment factor. In FIG. 2, the adjustment<br>
factors are shown as being "3". Alternately, unequal weight can be assigned to the<br>
adjustment factor to bias the operation of system 300 toward exiting or staying in the<br>
35      existing coverage network. For example assigning more weight to values below the second<br>
supplemental threshold 250 would result in a quicker exit from the existing coverage network,<br>

5 are +/-3dB from the baseline threshold, it will be appreciate by one of skill in the art that<br>
other supplemental threshold values are possible.<br>
While the disclosure above referring to Figs. 3-5, describes an addition and<br>
subtraction method for recording the history of received signals, the method is not limited to<br>
5       addition and subtraction. The method generally adjusts an indicator based on received<br>
signals. By then examining the indicator, the system can determine whether to seek an<br>
alternate coverage network.<br>
For example, FIG. 6 is a schematic block diagram depicting the system 600<br>
for determining when to exit an existing coverage network.   The structure shown in FIG. 6 is<br>
10       similar to the structure shown in FIG. 3 and described above. FIG. 6 differs in that the<br>
adjustment circuit is in the form of a multiply and divide circuit. Instead of maintaining a<br>
running counter, the multiply and divide circuit 327 responds differently to signals 312 and<br>
314. For example, the multiply and divide circuit 3 27 may multiply an indicator by an<br>
adjustment factor if it receives a signal on line 312, or divide the indicator by an adjustment<br>
15       factor if it receives a signal on line 314. To illustrate, the multiply and divide circuit 327 may<br>
begin with an indicator value of 10. It is the indicator value that is adjusted in the multiply<br>
and divide circuit 327 to determine when, and if to send an exit control signal 308. If the<br>
transceiver 302 receives a signal sample that is below the threshold value, the first<br>
comparison circuit 310 would send a signal on line 312 to the multiply and divide circuit 327,<br>
20      causing the multiply and divide circuit 327 to multiply the Indicator (now 10) by an<br>
adjustment factor. For example, the adjustment factor may be 2. Thus, the indicator would<br>
now be 20. A second received signal sample is also below the threshold, causing, as just<br>
described, the indicator (now 20) to be multiplied by an adjustment factor of 2, resulting in a<br>
new indicator value of 40. If a third received signal sample is above, rather than below, the<br>
25       threshold, the first comparison circuit 310 would send a signal on line 314 causing the<br>
counting circuit to divide the indicator by the adjustment factor for example, 2. Thus the<br>
indicator would now be 20.   Later received signals would cause the indicator to increase or<br>
decrease. If the indicator reaches a preset value of for example, 100 or more, the multiply and<br>
divide circuit 327 would send an exit control signal 308. The multiply and divide circuit 327<br>
30       resets the running total to the initial value after supplying the exit control signal 308.<br>
To avoid bias associated with being in a good coverage area for many signal<br>
samples, the indicator may have preset a minimum value. Returning to FIG. 6, to avoid<br>
biasing, the calculator circuit 320 divides the indicator only if the indicator is greater than a<br>
predetermined minimum total value. Otherwise, the multiply and divide circuit 327 maintains<br>

baseline threshold value in Step 810 includes using the second adjustment factor to increment<br>
the running sum.<br>
In one aspect of the method, the absolute value of the first adjustment factor<br>
equals the absolute value of the second adjustment factor. In one aspect of the method, the<br>
5      absolute value of the first difference equals the absolute value of the second difference. In<br>
one aspect of the method, the first difference is +3dB and the second difference is —3dB with<br>
respect to the baseline threshold value.<br>
In one aspect of the method, measuring the difference between each sample<br>
point and a predetermined baseline threshold value in Step.804 includes measuring a third<br>
10       difference greater than the first difference and a fourth difference greater than the second<br>
difference. That is, the- value of the received input power level sample associated with the<br>
fourth difference is less than the value of the received input power level sample associated<br>
with the second difference. Assigning an adjustment factor to each measured difference in<br>
Step 806 includes assigning a third adjustment factor greater than the first accumulation<br>
15      amount to the third difference and a fourth adjustment factor greater than the second<br>
accumulation amount of the fourth difference. Then, decrementing the running sum for<br>
sample point values greater than the baseline threshold value in Step 810 includes using the<br>
third, adjustment factor to decrement the running sum and incrementing the running sum for<br>
sample point values less than the baseline threshold value in Step 810 includes using the<br>
20       fourth adjustment factor to increment the running sum.<br>
In one aspect of the method, the absolute value of the third adjustment factor<br>
equals the absolute value of the fourth adjustment  factor. In one aspect  of the method, exiting<br>
the easting coverage network when the running sum is greater then, or equal to the terminal<br>
value in Step 814 includes resetting the running sum to a predetermined initial value after<br>
25       exiting the existing coverage network.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart showing in further detail a method illustrated in FIG. 7,<br>
as applied to the block diagram of FIG. 6. The method starts at 900. Step 903 samples the<br>
received input power level. Step 904 measures the difference between-each sample point and<br>
a predetermined baseline threshold value. Step 906 assigns a division or multiplication<br>
30       adjustment factor to each measured difference. Step 908 maintains a current indicator value<br>
in response to the measured differences.  Step 910 multiplies the indicator by the division and<br>
multiplication adjustment factor for sample point value greater than the baseline threshold<br>
value and divides the indicator by the division and multiplication adjustment factor for sample<br>
point values less than the baseline threshold value. As described above, Step 910 may have<br>
35       different division and multiplication adjustment factors depending on the distance from the<br>
baseline threshold. Step 912 exits the existing coverage network when the indicator is greater<br>
than, or equal to a predetermined terminal value.<br>

signal strength a lower than PVT. Step 1306 compares the second received sample signal<br>
strength with the threshold. Step 1308 increase an adjustment factor if the second received<br>
sample signal strength is lower than the threshold. Step 1311 decreases an adjustment factor<br>
if the second receded sample signal strength is lower than the threshold. Step 1313<br>
5      determines a running sum. The running sum is equal to the previous running sum plus the<br>
adjustment factor.   Step 1316 exits if the running sum is greater than a terminal value. Step<br>
1318 repeals the process if the running sum is less than the terminal value.<br>
While the methods and systems already discussed are described as increasing<br>
a number (i.e., a running counter or indicator) through some adjustment factor (i.e., addition<br>
10       or multiplication) when a signal below a threshold is encountered, the method may also<br>
decrease a number through some adjustment factor for signals received below a threshold,<br>
For example, in the method described in FIG. 8, the running comer may be determined for<br>
signals received below a threshold at Step 810, and the system may exit when the running<br>
sum is less than or equal to a predetermined terminal value at Step 814. Similarly, in the<br>
15       method described in FIG. 9, the indicator may be divided for signals received below a<br>
threshold at step.9l0, and the system may exit then the indicator is less than or equal to a<br>
predetermined terminal value at Step 912.<br>
A system and method are presented for determining when to exit an exiting<br>
wireless communications coverage network. Examples of the invention have been enabled<br>
20       without supplemental threshold levels, and with a first set of supplemental threshold levels.<br>
however, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to any particular<br>
number of supplemental threshold levels. The system and method are applicable to a wide<br>
range of wireless communications device configurations including analog communication<br>
systems and digital communications systems. Analog communication systems transmit a<br>

COVERAGE NETWORK<br>
(S7) Abstract: A system and a method are presented<br>
for  determining   when   10   exit   an   existing  wireless<br>
communications coverage network. The system<br>
comprising a calculator circuit (300) for sampling<br>
received input power levels (702); comporting the the<br>
received input power level samples to a predetermined<br>
baseline threshold value (704); adjusting an indicator<br>
responsive to the received input power level samples<br>
compared to the predetermined baseline threshold value<br>
(107), setting a terminate condition indicating which the<br>
wireless communications device should exit the existing<br>
wireless communications coverage network (709);<br>
and exiting the existing coverage network based on a<br>
comparison of the indicator to the retinal condition<br>
(711, 714).<br><br><br>

TIA/EIA-95 -E) uses two thresholds: the Ec threshold and Bc/Io threshold, to determine when<br>
to seek an alternative network. The Ec threshold find Ec/In threshold stand for the pilot power<br>
threshold and the pilot Ec/Io threshold respectively. See TIA/EIA-95-B at Sec. 6.6.2.2.5. In<br>
practice, the mobile handset 100 determines the pilot signal strength and the signal-to-noise<br>
5      ratio of the pilot signal (the SNR) from the signal levels transmitted by the base station 105.<br>
The mobile handset 100 also receives a data message from the base station 105 that includes<br>
the Ec threshold and the Ec/Io threshold set by the network.<br>
The mobile handset 100 compares the pilot signal strength to the Ec threshold<br>
and the SNR to the Ec/Io threshold. In one implementation, if either exceeds the threshold,<br>
10      the mobile handset 100 will seek an alternate network.   In another implementation, if both<br>
thresholds are exceeded, the mobile handset 100 will seek an alternate network. The strict<br>
threshold comparison effectively creates a threshold 120, such that when the mobile handset<br>
100 crosses to the right of the threshold 120, the mobile handset 100 switches from the<br>
existing network and seeks alternate coverage.<br>
15                               The problem with this strict threshold comparison method is that it may result<br>
in switching from a base station 105 prematurely. Because the pilot signal and the SNR are<br>
both functions of position, among other factors, and a mobile handset 100 can change position<br>
rapidly, using a strict comparison to thresholds could result in changing base stations too<br>
rapidly, and potentially degrading the quality of service. To illustrate; considers mobile<br>
20      handset 100 traveling on a windy road that at time one is at distance 125. At some short time<br>
later, the mobile handset 100 is at distance 130. As it continues is travel, the mobile handset<br>
100 vacillates between distance 125 and distance 130. Both the pilot signal and the SNR for<br>
distance 125 may favor base station 105, while the both pilot signal and SNR for distance 130<br>
exceed the relevant thresholds (i.e., threshold 120). The mobile handset 100 using a strict<br>
25      threshold comparison would switch from the base station 105 upon determining that the<br>
thresholds were exceeded, and the mobile handset 100 would seek alternative service. This<br>
switch may result in diminished service, if for example, alternate service is not available to<br>
the mobile handset 100.<br>
Additionally, as mentioned above, the RF level is dynamic and can often<br>
30      oscillate by several dB even when the mobile handset 100 is in a stationary position. The<br>
oscillations in the RF level are caused by environmental effects in the area. As a result, even<br>
if the mobile handset 100 is positioned on the left side of point 120 in FIG. 1A the received<br>
signal strength may cross below the Ec threshold or the Ee/Io threshold at a short distance<br>
from the point 120 on FIG. 1A. The hard decision threshold will cause me mobile handset<br>
35      100 to switch current networks prematurely and results in diminished service.<br>
A similar problem exists when a mobile handset 100 is caught between two<br>
competing base stations. FIG, IB illustrates mobile handset 100 in a network that includes at<br>
2<br><br>
WO2004/037906 PCT/US2003/040650<br>
At least two significant problems exist with the SNR comparison method<br>
described above and illustrated in FIG. 1B. The first problem is that the SNR comparison,<br>
even with the Delta, may result in switching base stations (either 105 or 135) too often. As<br>
illustrated above, the mobile handset 100 may be on a winding road that may take to a<br>
5      distance 150, for a very short time, whose SNR (plus the Delta) favors switching the base<br>
station, from say base station 105 to base station 135. But the mobile station 100 winds back<br>
to a distance 175 where the SNR favors the base station 105, again causing a switch. Despite<br>
die fact that the mobile handset 100 only went to distance 150 briefly, the mobile handset 100<br>
still made the switch. This is similar to the premature switching problem described with<br>
10      reference to FIG. 1A.<br>
A second problem is that the mobile handset 100 may not switch to the most<br>
favorable base station (either 105 or 135) when in the area between the thresholds 165 and<br>
170. For example, as described above a mobile handset 100 currently using base station 105<br>
may move to distance 160 and come closer and closer to threshold 170, but never crossing<br>
15      threshold 170. At a position approaching threshold 170, it would be advantageous to switch<br>
to base station 135. The method described above, however would not switch to base station<br>
135, but would remain with base station 105 because the SNR of base station 135 would not<br>
overcome the SNR including the Delta, of base station 105. Thus, the mobile handset 100<br>
would not operate with the most favorable base station that yields the best service.<br>
20                              Given the problems detailed with reference to Figs. 1A and IB, it would be<br>
advantageous if a mobile handset 100 could accurately determine when to exit the existing<br>
coverage network so as ensure best possible service and to avoid premature or late exits.<br>
SDEVDVEARY OF THEE INVENTION<br>
25                             The present invention solves the problem of determining when a mobile<br>
handset operating in a Grey Zone should exit the existing coverage network. The present<br>
invention recognizes that a mobile handset should analyze the received input power to<br>
determine when it is necessary to exit. The invention performs this analysis by compiling the<br>
received input power, comparing the received input power to a threshold, adjusting an<br>
30      indicator depending on that comparison, and determining whether to exit the existing<br>
coverage network or not based on the state of the indicator with respect to a terminal<br>
In the examples that follow the terminal condition will be a terminal value.<br>
The stats of the indicator will be less than, greater than, or equal to the terminal value. The<br>
35      method determines whether to exit the existing coverage network or not based on the state of<br>
the indicator with respect to the terminal value.<br>

factor in the second example could be larger for weak received signals causing the system to<br>
exit the existing coverage network more quickly.<br>
The use of the present invention method enables a mobile handset operating<br>
in Grey Zone coverage to more accurately determine when to exit an existing coverage<br>
5      network to avoid the problems associated with premature or late exit from the coverage<br>
network. Additional details of the above-described method and a system for determining<br>
when to exit an existing coverage network are presented below.<br>

The graph of FIG. 2 shows theoretical received input power level 230 for a<br>
handset plotted against distance of the device. The graph also includes theoretical received<br>
5      input power plus noise 220. It is common to one of skill in the art to model noise as a<br>
Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The theoretical received input power level plus noise<br>
220 can also be modeled as a Gaussian distribution. Other, non-Gaussian models can be used<br>
to model input power levels.<br>
In another method of selecting the baseline threshold 235, the baseline<br>
10      threshold 235 is assigned a value that is the mean of the Gaussian distribution of the<br>
theoretical received input power level plus noise 220 at some distance from the base station.<br>
The baseline threshold 235 supplemental thresholds may be used. The first supplemental<br>
threshold 245 is set equal to the baseline threshold 235 plus one standard deviation of the<br>
Gaussian distribution representing the noise. The second supplemental threshold 250 is set<br>
15      equal t0 the baseline threshold 235 minus one standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution<br>
representing the noise. It should be noted that one standard deviation of the Gaussian<br>
distribution representing the noise is equal to one stand and deviation of  the Gaussian<br>
distribution of the theoretical received input power level plus noise 220.<br>
It Will be dear to one of skill in the art that additional supplemental<br>
20      thresholds are possible. For example, a supplemental threshold can be placed at two or more<br>
standard deviations above and below the baseline threshold 235 of the Gaussian distribution<br>
representing the noise. It will also be clear to one of skill in the art that the supplemental<br>
thresholds do not have to be placed an integral number of standard deviations above and<br>
below the baseline threshold 225 of the Gaussian distribution representing the noise. The<br>
25      supplemental threshold does not have to be based on a standard deviation. Additional<br>
methods of picking the supplemental thresholds will be discussed below.<br>
By compiling historical received input power level sample values, a mobile<br>
handset can identify the longer-term trends associated with received input power levels, such<br>
as steadily decreasing or increasing values, which are more accurate indicators of the quality<br>
30      of the coverage for the mobile handset.<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic block diagram depicting a system 300 for determining<br>
when to exit an existing coverage network In accordance with the present invention.<br>
Transceiver 302 has a transceiver output 304 supplying received input power level sample<br>
values to a calculator circuit 306. The calculator circuit 306 compiles historical data on the<br>
35      received input power level sample values and supplies an exit control signal 308 in response<br>
to the historical data and a predetermined baseline threshold 235 value. The calculator circuit<br>
506 includes a first comparison circuit 310 with an input 304 accepting the received input<br>
8<br><br>
WO2004/037906 PCT/US2003/040650<br>
One issue associated with compiling historical data on the received input<br>
power level sample values is the biasing of the running total with received input power<br>
sample values above the baseline threshold 235. Potential biasing of the running total is an<br>
issue because the running total must be able to respond (approach the terminal value) If the<br>
5      mobile handset operates for a sufficient period of time in an area with poor coverage. This<br>
may not be possible if the mobile handset has previously been operating for a period of time<br>
in good coverage with the result that a largo number of first adjustment cause the running total<br>
to move too far below the terminal value.<br>
Returning to FIG. 3, to avoid biasing, the totalize 320 decrements the<br>
10      running total for each first adjustment factor only if the running total is greater than a<br>
predetermined minimum total value. Otherwise, the running count is maintained at the<br>
minimum total value until a second adjustment factor is encountered. As with the baseline<br>
threshold 235 value and the terminal value the minimum total value can be selected<br>
according to the desired performance of the system 300 and is coordinated with these other<br>
15      values. The totalize 320 resets the running total to the initial value after supplying the exit<br>
control signal.<br>
The assignment of values for the first and second adjustment factors can be<br>
selected according to the desired performance of the system 300. The adjustment factors also<br>
are coordinated with the threshold value, the terminal value, and the minimum total value. In<br>
20      one aspect of the system 300,the absolute value of the first adjustment factor equals the<br>
absolute value of the second adjustment factor. That is, operation of the device above and<br>
below the baseline threshold 235 value is given equal weight in the analysis of when to exit<br>
the existing coverage area. In FIG. 2, the absolute values of the adjustment factors are shown<br>
as being "I". Alternately, unequal weight can be assigned to the adjustment factors to bias<br>
25      the operation of system 300 toward exiting or staying in the existing coverage network. For<br>
example, assigning more weight to values below the baseline threshold 235 would result in a<br>
quicker exit from the existing coverage network, since the larger second adjustment factors<br>
would more rapidly increment the running total to the terminal value.<br>
The simplicity of the above-mentioned system 300 is off set by limitations.<br>
30      Since the received input power level tends to fluctuate rapidly during operation, particularly<br>
in Gray Zones, the mobile handset may oscillate between coverage networks. Therefore, in<br>
one aspect of the system 300, predetermined supplemental threshold values are included to<br>
increase the accuracy and responsiveness of the system 300. The first supplemental threshold<br>
245 is above the baseline threshold 235 as shown in FIG. 2. The second supplemental<br>
35      threshold 250 is below the baseline threshold 235 value as shown in FIG. 2. The<br>
supplemental thresholds allow the system 300 to identify received input power level sample<br>
10<br><br>
WO2004/037906 PCT/US2003/040650<br>
since the larger second adjustment factors would more rapidly increment the running total to<br>
the terminal value.<br>
The selection of the supplemental threshold values can have a significant<br>
impact on the determination of when to exit the existing coverage area. For example, if the<br>
5      first supplemental threshold 245 is further from the baseline threshold 235 than the second<br>
supplemental threshold 250, less weight will be given to received input power level samples<br>
in areas of better coverage. In one aspect of the system 300, the absolute value of the first<br>
supplemental threshold 245 value equals the absolute value of the second supplemental<br>
threshold 250 value as shown in FIG. 2. This results in an equal weighting of received input<br>
10      power level values above and below the baseline threshold 235 value. In one aspect of the<br>
system 300, the first supplemental threshold 245 value is ÷3dB with respect to the baseline<br>
threshold 253 value and the second supplemental threshold 250 value is -3dB with respect to<br>
the baseline threshold 235 value.<br>
While FIG. 2 illustrates three thresholds, and four adjustment factors assigned<br>
15      to each of the four areas divided by the three thresholds, the method can be expanded to<br>
include more thresholds. Increasing the thresholds, and thus increasing the number of<br>
adjustment factors assigned to areas divided by the thresholds, may increase the sensitivity of<br>
the method. The increased sensitivity, however, may be offset by the probable increase in<br>
processing. Thus, the method must be tailored to maximize sensitivity, while not over<br>
20      burdening the system's 300 processing capability.<br>
FIG. 4 is a chart illustrating an example of the operation of the present<br>
invention system with a baseline threshold 435. In FIG. 4, the first and second adjustment<br>
factors are "-1" and "+1" respectively. FIG. 4 shows: the received input power level sample<br>
values compared to the threshold value, adjustment factors assigned to the sample values<br>
25      responsive to the comparison, the running total decremented and incremented using the<br>
adjustment factors, the exit control signal activated when the running total equals the terminal<br>
value, and the running total reset to the initial value after the exit control signal is activated.<br>
FIG. 5 is a chart illustrating an example of the operation of the present<br>
invention system with a baseline threshold 535 and two supplemental thresholds. In FIG. 5,<br>
30      the first and second adjustment factors are "-1" and "+1" respectively and the third and fourth<br>
adjustment, factors are '-3" and "+3" respectively. FIG. 5 shows the received input power<br>
level sample values compared to the baseline threshold 535 and the first add second<br>
supplemental threshold values. Additionally, FIG. 5 shows adjustment factors assigned to the<br>
sample values responsive to the comparison and the running total decremented and<br>
35      incremented using the adjustment factors. The exit control signal activated when the running<br>
total equals the terminal value, and the running total reset to the initial value after the exit<br>
control signal is activated are also shown. While the supplemental thresholds shown in FIG.<br>

WO2004/037906 PCT/US2003/040650<br>
Also, as with the addition and subtraction method described in Figs. 3 -5, the<br>
system depicted in FIG. 6, may vary the multiplication and division adjustment factor<br>
depending on the distance from the baseline threshold. Again, this would, for example, cause<br>
very poor received signals to affect the indicator more quickly, potentially accelerating the<br>
5      exit control signal 308.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating the method for determining when to exit an<br>
existing coverage network. Although the method of FIG. 7 (and Figs. 8,9, 10, 12 and 13<br>
below) is depicted as a sequence of numbered steps for clarity, no order should be inferred<br>
from the numbering unless explicitly stated. The method starts at Step 700. Step 702<br>
10      receives an input power level from the wireless communications coverage network. Step 704<br>
compares the input power level to a threshold. Step 707 adjusts am indicator responsive to the<br>
comparison step 704. Step 709 sets a terminal condition indicating when the wireless<br>
communications device should exit the existing wireless communications coverage network.<br>
Step 711 compares the indicator to the terminal condition. Step 714 exits the coverage<br>
15      network responsive to the comparison stop.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart showing in further detail the method illustrated in FIG.<br>
7, as applied to the block diagram of FIG. 3. The method starts at 800. Step 802 samples the<br>
received input power level. Stop 804 measures the difference between each sample point and<br>
a predetermined baseline threshold value. Step 806 assigns an adjustment factor to each<br>
20      treasured difference. Step 808 maintains a running sum in response to the measured<br>
differences. Step 810 decrements the running sum for sample point values greater than the<br>
baseline threshold value and increments the running sum for sample point values less than the<br>
baseline threshold value. Step 812 uses the adjustment factor to change the running sum.<br>
Step 814 exits the existing coverage network when the running sum is greater than, or equal<br>
25       to a predetermined terminal value.<br>
In one aspect of the method decrementing the running sum for sample point<br>
values greater than the baseline threshold value in Step 810 includes decrementing the<br>
running sum only if the running sum is greater than a predetermined minimum value.<br>
In one aspect of the method, measuring the difference between each sample<br>
30      point and a predetermined baseline threshold value in Step 804 includes measuring a first<br>
difference for a first sample point value greater than the baseline threshold value and a second<br>
difference for a second sample point value less than the baseline threshold value. Assigning<br>
an adjustment factor to each measured difference in Step 806 includes assigning a first<br>
adjustment factor to the first difference and a second adjustment factor to the second<br>
35      difference. Then, decrementing the running sum for sample point values greater than the<br>
baseline threshold value in Step 810 includes using the first adjustment factor to decrement<br>
the running sum and incrementing the running sum for sample point values less than the<br>

FIG. 10 is a flowchart showing a method of one embodiment illustrate in the<br>
block diagram of FIG. 3. The method starts at 1000. Step 1003 samples the received input<br>
power level Step 1004 measures the difference between each sample point and a<br>
predetermined baseline threshold value. Step 1006 assigns an addition or subtraction<br>
5      adjustment factor to each measured difference. In this example step 1006 assigns art addition<br>
or subtraction of one. Step 1008 exits the existing coverage network when the indicator is<br>
greater than, or equal to a predetermined terminal value.<br>
FIG. 11 is a diagram 1100 showing a baseline threshold 1135, a first<br>
supplemental threshold 1145, and a second supplemental threshold 1150. The line 1120 on<br>
10      the diagram 1100 indicates improving signal strength as we move from right to left.<br>
Additionally, the diagram shows the addition or subtraction adjustment factor 1115, also<br>
indicated as "w" for different signal strengths. The accumulation value w = 3, 1117; w = 1,<br>
1119;w =-l,l122; and w=-3,1124. In one embodiment of the invention the supplemental<br>
thresholds 1150, 1145 are 3dB from the baseline threshold.<br>
15                               It should be noted that FIG. 11 is only an example of one embodiment of the<br>
invention, different accumulation values are possible. Additionally, the number of<br>
supplemental threshold and accumulation values can be increased. While accumulation<br>
values 1115 are assigned for specific signal strength ranges in this embodiment accumulations<br>
values can also be assigned based on the measured difference between signal strength and a<br>
20      predetermined threshold. An example of this was shown in FIG. S wherein the received input<br>
power table is indicative of the signal strength.<br>
FIG. 12 is a flowchart showing a method of another embodiment illustrated<br>
in the block diagram of FIG. 3. Specifically, FIG. 12 shows one way that addition or<br>
subtraction adjustment factors can be assigned. The method starts at 1200. Step 1202<br>
25      measures the received input power table. Step 1204 compares signal strength to the threshold<br>
values. Steps 1206, 1208,1210, 1212 assigns an addition or subtraction adjustment factor to<br>
each measured difference. Step 1206 increments the counter by three when the input power is<br>
worse than the second supplemental threshold. Step 1203 increments the counter by one if<br>
the input power is between the second supplemental threshold and the baseline threshold.<br>
30      Step 1210 decrements the counter by one if the input power is between the baseline threshold<br>
and the first supplemental threshold 1145. Step 1212 decrements the counter by three when<br>
the input power level is better than the first supplemental threshold 1145.   Step 1214K exits the<br>
existing coverage network when the indicator is greater than, or equal to a predetermined<br>
terminal value.<br>
35                             FIG. 13 is a flow chart showing the method of another embodiment. The<br>
method starts at 1300. Step 1302 compares the first received sample signal strength with a<br>
predetermined threshold value (PTV). Step 1304 enters a process if the first received sample<br>
