SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR NOTIFYING COMPLETION OF<br>
NETWORK RE-ENTRY PROCEDURE IN A COMMUNICATION<br>
SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a communication system, and in<br>
particular, to a system and method for notifying completion of a network re-entry<br>
procedure in a communication system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In the next generation communication system, active research is being<br>
conducted to provide service capable of transmitting/receiving high-speed, high-<br>
capacity data to/from mobile stations (MSs). A typical example of the next<br>
generation communication system is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics<br>
Engineers (IEEE) 802.16e communication system .<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, herein is a description of an MS performing a process<br>
of a network re-entry procedure with a target base station (BS) after performing<br>
connection switching, e.g., handover, from a serving BS to the target BS in a<br>
general IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
FIG. 1 is a signaling diagram illustrating a process of performing a network<br>
re-entry procedure in a general IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, following handover from a serving BS to a target BS<br>
150, an MS 100 obtains downlink synchronization with the target BS 150, and<br>
receives parameters to be used in an uplink and a downlink, in step 111.<br>
Thereafter, the MS 100 should obtain uplink synchronization by performing a<br>
ranging operation with the target BS 150, and perform an operation of adjusting<br>
transmission power. Therefore, the MS 100 transmits a Ranging Request (RNG-<br>
REQ) message to the target BS 150 in step 113, and the target BS 150 transmits a<br>
Ranging Response (RNG-RSP) message to the MS 100 in response to the RNG-<br>
REQ message in step 115.<br><br>
-2-<br>
Upon performing the ranging operation as described above, the MS 100<br>
transmits a Subscriber Station Basic Capability Request (SBC-REQ) message to<br>
the target BS 150 to request the basic capabilities of the target BS 150 and the MS<br>
100 in step 117. The SBC-REQ message, which is a Medium Access Control<br>
(MAC) message that the MS 100 transmits to the target BS 150 to request the<br>
basic capabilities, includes therein information on a Modulation and Coding<br>
Scheme (MCS) level supportable by the MS 100. Upon receipt of the SBC-REQ<br>
message from the MS 100, the target BS 150 detects an MCS level supportable by<br>
the MS 100, included in the received SBC-REQ message, and transmits a<br>
Subscriber Station Basic Capability Response (SBC-RSP) message to the MS 100<br>
in reply to the SBC-REQ message in step 119.<br>
Upon receipt of the SBC-RSP message, the MS 100 transmits a Privacy<br>
Key Management Request (PKM-REQ) message to the target BS 150 for MS<br>
authentication and key exchange in step 121. The PKM-REQ message, a MAC<br>
message for MS authentication, includes a certificate (unique information) of the<br>
MS 100. Upon receipt of the PKM-REQ message, the target BS 150 performs<br>
authentication with an Authentication Server (AS) (not shown) using the<br>
certificate of the MS 100, included in the received PKM-REQ message. If the MS<br>
100 is an authenticated MS as a result of the authentication, the target BS 150<br>
transmits a Privacy Key Management Response (PKM-RSP) message to the MS<br>
100 in response to the PKM-REQ message in step 123. The PKM-RSP message<br>
includes an Authentication Key (AK) and a Traffic Encryption Key (TEK)<br>
allocated to the MS 100.<br>
Upon receipt of the PKM-RSP message, the MS 100 transmits a<br>
Registration Request (REG-REQ) message to the target BS 150 in step 125. The<br>
REG-REQ message includes MS registration information for the MS 100. Upon<br>
receipt of the REG-REQ message, the target BS 150 detects MS registration<br>
information included in the received REG-REQ message, registers the MS 100<br>
therein using the MS registration information, and transmits a Registration<br>
Response (REG-RSP) message to the MS 100 in response to the REG-REQ<br>
message in step 127. The REG-RSP message includes the registered MS<br>
registration information. The MS 100 receives the REG-RSP message,<br>
completing its network re-entry procedure to the target BS 150 in step 129. As the<br><br>
-3-<br>
MS 100 receives the REG-RSP message, a normal operation is performed<br>
between the MS 100 and the target BS 150, completing the network re-entry<br>
procedure. The process of performing the network re-entry procedure in the<br>
general IEEE 802.16e communication system has been described above with<br>
reference to FIG. 1. Next, with reference to FIG. 2, a description will be made of a<br>
process of performing a network re-entry procedure based on Handover Process<br>
Optimization Type/Length/Value (TLV) in a general IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system.<br>
FIG. 2 is a signaling diagram illustrating a process of performing a network<br>
re-entry procedure based on Handover Process Optimization TLV in a general<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, following handover from a serving BS to a target BS<br>
250, an MS 200 obtains downlink synchronization with the target BS 250, and<br>
receives parameters to be used in an uplink and a downlink, in step 211. The MS<br>
200 transmits an RNG-REQ message to the target BS 250 in step 213, and the<br>
target BS 250 transmits an RNG-RSP message to the MS 200 in response to the<br>
RNG-REQ message in step 215. The RNG-RSP message includes HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV, and the HO Process Optimization TLV, an Information<br>
Element (IE) included using a TLV encoding scheme, is an IE of a connection<br>
switched MS, for example, a handover-processed MS, used for supporting a fast<br>
network re-entry procedure with the target BS. That is, the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV is an IE written to make it possible to omit some or all of the<br>
message transmission/reception processes that should necessarily be performed in<br>
the general network re-entry procedure for the fast network re-entry procedure of<br>
the MS 200.<br>
When the MS 200 performs general handover or idle mode handover, the<br>
target BS 250 can acquire information on the MS 200 via a backbone network<br>
from the system having the information on the MS 200, like the serving BS or a<br>
paging controller, before the MS 200 performs the general handover or idle mode<br>
handover. The information on the MS 200 can be equal to the information<br>
acquired in the process of performing by the MS 200 the network re-entry<br>
procedure after its handover from the serving BS to the target BS 250. In this case,<br><br>
-4-<br>
by acquiring the information on the MS 200 via the backbone network, the target<br>
BS 250 can omit a particular message transmission/reception process in the<br>
network re-entry procedure due to the handover of the MS 200, and can not only<br>
save the air link resources necessary for the particular message<br>
transmission/reception process but also advance a normal communication restart<br>
time with the MS 200. Therefore, the target BS 250 includes the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV in order to transmit to the MS 200 a notification indicating the<br>
message transmission/reception process omittable in the process of performing<br>
the network re-entry procedure. A format of the HO Process Optimization TLV is<br>
shown in Table 1 below.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
HO Process<br>
Optimization	For each Bit location, a value of '0' indicates the<br><br>
	associated re-entry management message shall be<br><br>
	required, a value of '1' indicates the re-entry<br><br>
	management messages may be omitted.<br><br>
	Bit #0: Omit SBC-REQ management message during<br><br>
	current re-entry processing<br><br>
	Bit #1: Omit PKM Authentication phase except TEK<br><br>
	phase during current re-entry processing<br><br>
	Bit #2: Omit PKM TEK creation phase during current<br><br>
	re-entry processing<br><br>
	Bit #3: BS shall transmit an unsolicited SBC-RSP<br><br>
	management message with updated capabilities<br><br>

	different from the ones of Serving BS<br><br>
	Bit #4: Omit REG-REQ management message during<br><br>
	current re-entry processing<br><br>
	Bit #5: BS shall transmit an unsolicited REG-RSP<br><br>
	management message with updated capabilities<br><br>
	information<br><br>
	Bit #6: BS supports virtual SDU SN. If Bit#6=l and<br><br>
	MS supports SDU SN, it shall issue SN Report header<br><br>
	upon completion of HO to this BS.<br><br>
-5-<br>
In Table 1, the HO Process Optimization TLV is a type of bitmap<br>
information indicating whether it is possible to omit transmission/reception of a<br>
message in the current network re-entry procedure. That is, the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV IE is expressed in the form of; for example, a 7-bit bitmap.<br>
Below is a description of each bit of the HO Process Optimization TLV bitmap .<br>
(1)	Whether it is possible to omit transmission of an SBC-REQ message is<br>
indicated by a first bit Bit#0. Bit#0 = 0 indicates that the MS 200 should<br>
necessarily transmit the SBC-REQ message, and Bit#0 = 1 indicates that the MS<br>
200 can omit transmission of the SBC-REQ message.<br>
(2)	Whether it is possible to omit a PKM authentication process is<br>
indicated by a second bit Bit#l. Bit#l = 0 indicates that the MS 200 should<br>
perform the PKM authentication process including a TEK process, and Bit#l = 1<br>
indicates that the MS 200 can omit the PKM authentication process except for the<br>
TEK process.<br>
(3)	Whether it is possible to omit the TEK process is indicated by a third<br>
bit Bit#2. Bit#2 = 0 indicates that the MS 200 should necessarily perform the<br>
TEK process, and Bit#2 = 1 indicates that the MS 200 can omit the TEK process.<br>
(4)	Whether it is possible to omit transmission of an SBC-RSP message is<br>
indicated by a fourth bit Bit#3. Bit#3 = 0 indicates that the target BS 250 should<br>
necessarily transmit an unsolicited SBC-RSP, and Bit#3 = 1 indicates that the<br>
target BS 250 can omit transmission of the SBC-RSP message by transmitting the<br>
information included in the SBC-RSP message along with the RNG-RSP message<br>
using the TLV encoding scheme.<br>
(5)	Whether it is possible to omit transmission of a REG-REQ message is<br>
indicated by a fifth bit Bit#4. Bit#4 = 0 indicates that the MS 200 should<br>
necessarily transmit the REG-REQ message, and Bit#4 = 1 indicates that the MS<br>
200 can omit transmission of the REG-REQ message.<br>
(6)	Whether it is possible to omit transmission of a REG-RSP message is<br>
indicated by a sixth bit Bit#5. Bit#5 = 0 indicates that the target BS 250 should<br><br>
-6-<br>
target BS 250 can omit transmission ofthe REG-RSP messaged transmitting the<br>
information included in the REG-RSP message along with the RNG-RSP<br>
message using the TLV encoding scheme.<br>
(7) Whether the target BS 250 supports a virtual Service Data Unit (SDU)<br>
Sequence Number (SN) is indicated by a seventh bit Bit#6. if the Bit#6 is set to<br>
T and the MS 200 also supports the virtual SDU SN, the MS 200 should<br>
transmit an SN Report header to the target BS 250 after completing the network<br>
re-entry procedure with the target BS 250.<br>
When Bit#3 and Bit#5 of the HO Processor Optimization TLV included in<br>
the RNG-RSP message are both set to '1', the TLV included in the RNG-RSP<br>
message is shown in Table 2 below.<br>
Table 2<br>
If (HO Process<br>
Optimization [bit#3]==l)	<br>
SBC-RSP encoding	SBC-RSP TLV items for HO optimization<br><br>
If (HO Process<br>
Optimization [bit#5]=l)	<br>
REG-RSP encoding	REG-RSP TLV items for HO optimization<br><br>
In Table 2, if Bit#3 of the HO Process Optimization TLV is set to '1', it<br>
indicates SBC-RSP encoding information included in the RNG-RSP message. If<br>
Bit#5 of the HO Process Optimization TLV is set to '1', it indicates REG-RSP<br>
encoding information included in the RNG-RSP message.<br>
Thereafter, the MS 200 and the target BS 250 perform the network re-entry<br>
procedure according to the HO Process Optimization TLV. For example, if the<br>
HO Process Optimization TLV bitmap is set to '1110100', the MS 200 omits<br>
transmission of an SBC-REQ message in step 217, the target BS 250 transmits an<br><br>
-7-<br>
unsolicited SBC-RSP message to the MS 200 in step 219, the MS 200 omits<br>
transmission of a PKM-REQ message in step 221, the target BS 250 omits<br>
transmission of a PKM-RSP message in step 223, the MS 200 omits transmission<br>
of an REG-REQ message in step 225, and finally, the target BS 250 transmits an<br>
unsolicited REG-RSP message to the MS 200 in step 227.<br>
As another example, if the HO Process Optimization TLV bitmap is set to<br>
'1111110', the target BS 250 should transmit the information included in both the<br>
SBC-RSP message and the REG-RSP message along with the TLV of the RNG-<br>
RSP message. In this case, the MS 200 and the target BS 250 can normally<br>
complete the network re-entry procedure in step 229, even though they omit all<br>
the message transmission/reception processes shown in steps 217 to 227.<br>
As described above, in the course of performing the network re-entry<br>
procedure, the MS and the target BS can omit some or all of the message<br>
transmission/reception processes in the network re-entry procedure according to<br>
the HO Process Optimization TLV.<br>
Although the MS fails to normally receive the RNG-RSP message from<br>
the target BS, it is impossible for the target BS to recognize the MS's failure to<br>
normally receive the RNG-RSP message. In this case, though the target BS<br>
performs the network re-entry procedure according to the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV, the MS may perform the general network re-entry procedure,<br>
causing mis-synchronization of the message transmission/reception process<br>
between the MS and the target BS.<br>
In addition, if the target BS transmits an unsolicited SBC-RSP message or<br>
an unsolicited REG-RSP message without a request of the MS, i.e., if the target<br>
BS unilaterally transmits the message to the MS without performing the general<br>
message transmission/reception process, it is impossible for the target BS to<br>
recognize whether the MS has normally received the unsolicited SBC-RSP<br>
message or the unsolicited REG-RSP message.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a scheme in which the target BS can<br>
recognize whether the MS has normally received an unsolicited message that the<br><br>
-8-<br>
target BS transmitted without the request of the MS, or a message included in the<br>
HO Process Optimization TLV, while the MS and the target BS are performing<br>
the network re-entry procedure according to the HO Process Optimization TLV.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a<br>
detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
has been omitted for clarity and conciseness.<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for notifying<br>
completion of a network re-entry procedure in a communication system, for<br>
example, an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16e<br>
communication system. In addition, the present invention provides a system and<br>
method for notifying whether a mobile station (MS) has normally received an<br>
unsolicited message transmitted by a target base station (BS) in the course of<br>
performing a network re-entry procedure according to Handover Process<br>
Optimization Type/Length/Value (TLV) in an IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system. Although the present invention will be described with reference to the<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system for convenience, the scheme provided in<br>
the present invention is applicable to other communication systems.<br><br>
-10-<br>
FIG. 3 is a signaling diagram illustrating a process of performing a<br>
network re-entry procedure based on HO Process Optimization TLV in an IEEE<br>
802.16e communication system according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, after handover from a serving BS to a target BS 350,<br>
an MS 300 acquires downlink (DL) synchronization with the target BS 350, and<br>
receives parameters to be used in an uplink (UL) and a downlink, in step 311. The<br>
MS 300 transmits a Ranging Request (RNG-REQ) message to the target BS 350<br>
in step 313, and the target BS 350 transmits a Ranging Response (RNG-RSP)<br>
message to the MS 300 in response to the RNG-REQ message, in step 315. The<br>
RNG-RSP message includes HO Process Optimization TLV, and the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV, an Information Element (IE) included using a TLV encoding<br>
scheme, is an IE of a handover-processed MS 300, used for supporting a fast<br>
network re-entry procedure with the target BS 350. That is, the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV is an IE written to make it possible to omit some or all of the<br>
message transmission/reception processes that should necessarily be performed in<br>
the general network re-entry procedure for the fast network re-entry procedure of<br>
the MS 300. A detailed description of the HO Process Optimization TLV is set<br>
forth in Table 1 herein.<br>
Upon reception of the RNG-RSP message including the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV from the target BS 350, the MS 300 transmits an RNG-RSP<br>
Acknowledge (ACK) message indicating normal receipt of the RNG-RSP<br>
message to the target BS 350, in step 317. The target BS 350, as it receives the<br>
RNG-RSP ACK message from the MS 300, recognizes that the MS 300 has<br>
normally received the RNG-RSP message.<br>
The target BS 350 transmits an unsolicited Subscriber Station Basic<br>
Capability Response (SBC-RSP) message to the MS 300 in step 319, regardless<br>
of receipt from the MS 300 a Subscriber Station's Basic Capability Negotiation<br>
Request (SBC-REQ) message for negotiation of the basic capability of the MS<br>
300.<br>
Upon reception of the unsolicited SBC-RSP message from the target BS<br>
350, the MS 300 transmits an SBC-RSP ACK message indicating normal receipt<br><br>
-11-<br>
of the unsolicited SBC-RSP message, to the target BS 350 in step 321. The target<br>
BS 350, as it receives the SBC-RSP ACK message from the MS 300, recognizes<br>
that the MS 300 has normally received the SBC-RSP message.<br>
The target BS 350 transmits an unsolicited Registration Response (REG-<br>
RSP) message to the MS 300 in step 323, regardless of receipt from the MS 300 a<br>
Registration Request (REG-REQ) message. Upon reception of the unsolicited<br>
REG-RSP message from the target BS 350, the MS 300 transmits a REG-RSP<br>
ACK message indicating normal receipt of the unsolicited REG-RSP message to<br>
the target BS 350 in step 325.<br>
The target BS 350, as it receives the REG-RSP ACK message from<br>
the MS 300, recognizes that the MS 300 has normally received the unsolicited<br>
REG-RSP message, thereby completing the network re-entry procedure in step<br>
327. As a result, as the MS 300 receives the unsolicited REG-RSP message, a<br>
normal operation is performed between the MS 300 and the target BS 350,<br>
thereby completing the network re-entry procedure.<br>
Although FIG. 3 illustrates a preferred case in which the target BS 350<br>
transmits the unsolicited SBC-RSP message and unsolicited REG-RSP message<br>
according to the HO Process Optimization TLV, if the information included in the<br>
unsolicited SBC-RSP message and the unsolicited REG-RSP message as<br>
described with reference to Table 2 is already included in the RNG-RSP message,<br>
the processes in steps 319 to 325 are not performed. In addition, although FIG. 3<br>
illustrates a preferred case in which the target BS 350 transmits both the<br>
unsolicited SBC-RSP message and the unsolicited REG-RSP message according<br>
to the HO Process Optimization TLV, the process may also include other message<br>
transmission/reception processes included in the network re-entry procedure, like<br>
the message transmission/reception process for Privacy Key Management (PKM)<br>
authentication according to the HO Process Optimization TLV.<br>
The RNG-RSP ACK message, SBC-RSP ACK message, and REG-RSP<br>
ACK message can be implemented in the same format, i.e. can be implemented<br>
using a Network re-entry confirm extended sub-header including a Network re-<br>
entry confirm field, shown in Table 3 below.<br><br>
-12-<br>
Table 3<br>
Name	Size (bits)	Description<br>
Network re-entry<br>
confirm	3	Bit #0: set to 1 to indicate an<br>
acknowledgement for RNG-RSP<br>
message<br>
Bit #1: set to 1 to indicate an<br>
acknowledgement for unsolicited SBC-<br>
RSP message<br>
Bit #2: set to 1 to indicate an<br>
acknowledgement for unsolicited REG-<br>
RSP message<br>
Reserved	5	Shall be set to zero<br>
As shown in Table 3, the Network re-entry confirm field of the Network<br>
re-entry confirm extended sub-header includes bitmap information indicating the<br>
message, upon reception, the MS transmits the current ACK message. That is, in<br>
the Network re-entry confirm field, Bit#0 = 1 indicates that the MS transmits the<br>
current ACK message in response to the RNG-RSP message, Bit#l = 1 indicates<br>
that the MS transmits the current ACK message in response to the unsolicited<br>
SBC-RSP message, and Bit#2 = 1 indicates that the MS transmits the current<br>
ACK message in response to the unsolicited REG-RSP message.<br>
In addition, a Reserved field of the Network re-entry confirm extended<br>
sub-header maintains the number of bits of the Network reentry confirm extended<br>
sub-header at eight (8), and is a field reserved for future use. For example, this<br>
field is set to '0'.<br>
In transmitting ACK messages in response to the RNG-RSP message,<br>
unsolicited SBC-RSP message and unsolicited REG-RSP message, the MS sets<br>
bitmap information indicating the ACK messages for all of the RNG-RSP<br>
message, unsolicited SBC-RSP message and unsolicited REG-RSP message to<br>
transmit the ACK messages through one Network re-entry confirm extended sub-<br>
header, or separately sets bitmap information indicating an ACK message for<br>
each of the RNG-RSP message, unsolicited SBC-RSP message and unsolicited<br>
REG-RSP message to transmit the ACK messages through three Network re-<br><br>
-13-<br>
entry confirm extended sub-headers.<br>
In addition, the RNG-RSP ACK message, SBC-RSP ACK message and<br>
REG-RSP ACK message can be implemented using Reserved bits of a Channel<br>
Quality Information Channel (CQICH) Allocation Request (CQICH Allocation<br>
Request) message header, shown in Table 4 below.<br>
Table 4<br>

As shown in Table 4, the header of the CQICH Allocation Request<br>
message includes a Type field indicating a type of the currently transmitted<br>
header, a Fast BS Switching Indicator (FBSSI) field indicating that the MS<br>
transmits the header to request CQICH allocation when performing a Fast BS<br>
Switching (FBSS) operation, a Feedback Type field indicating a type for<br>
distinguishing the information for feeding back the CQICH, a Preferred-Period<br>
field indicating a CQICH allocation period preferred by the MS, a CID field<br>
indicating a Basic Connection Identifier (CID) of the MS that transmits the<br>
header, an HCS field indicating a Header Check Sequence (HCS) used for<br>
checking integrity of the header, a Network re-entry confirm indicator field<br>
indicating whether a Network re-entry confirm field indicating transmission/non-<br>
transmission of an ACK for the RNG-RSP ACK message, SBC-RSP ACK<br>
message and REG-RSP ACK message during the network re-entry procedure is<br>
included in the header of the CQICH Allocation Request message, i.e. indicating<br>
that the header of the CQICH Allocation Request message is used for transmitting<br>
an ACK for the RNG-RSP ACK message, SBC-RSP ACK message and REG-<br>
RSP ACK message, and the Network reentry confirm field. In Table 4, if a value<br>
of the FBSSI field is set to '1', the Feedback Type field value and the Preferred-<br>
Period field value are ignored. A description will now be made of the bitmap<br><br>
-14-<br>
information of the Network reentry confirm field.<br>
Below is a description of each bit of the Network re-entry confirm field .<br>
Bit#0 = 1 indicates an ACK message for the RNG-RSP message, Bit#l = 1<br>
indicates an ACK message for the unsolicited SBC-RSP message, and Bit#2 = 1<br>
indicates an ACK message for the unsolicited REG-RSP message.<br>
If the Network re-entry confirm indicator field in the header of the CQICH<br>
Allocation Request message is set to T, then the FBSSI field, Feedback Type<br>
field and Preferred-Period field in the header of the CQICH Allocation Request<br>
message are neglected.<br>
In transmitting an ACK message in reply to the RNG-RSP message,<br>
unsolicited SBC-RSP message and unsolicited REG-RSP message, the MS can<br>
set bitmap information indicating ACK messages for all of the RNG-RSP<br>
message, unsolicited SBC-RSP message and unsolicited REG-RSP message to<br>
transmit the ACK messages through one CQICH Allocation Request message<br>
header, or separately sets bitmap information indicating an ACK message for<br>
each of the RNG-RSP message, unsolicited SBC-RSP message and unsolicited<br>
REG-RSP message to transmit the ACK messages through three CQICH<br>
Allocation Request message headers.<br>
The RNG-RSP ACK message, SBC-RSP ACK message and REG-RSP<br>
ACK message can be implemented using a header of a Bandwidth Request<br>
message, as shown in Table 5 below.<br>
Table 5<br>
HT=<br>
1(1)	EC=0<br>
(1)	Type(3) =<br>
ObOOO/ObO<br>
01	BR MSB (11)<br>
BR LSB (8)	CID MSB (8)<br>
CID LSB (8)	HCS (8)<br>
As shown in Table 5, the header of the Bandwidth Request message<br>
includes a Type field indicating a type of the currently transmitted header, a CID<br><br>
-15-<br>
field indicating a Basic CID of the MS that transmits the header of the Bandwidth<br>
Request message, an HCS field indicating an HCS used for checking integrity of<br>
the header of the Bandwidth Request message, and a BR field.<br>
A value of the Type field set to '000' indicates whether a bandwidth<br>
allocation request of the MS is incremental, i.e. a value set later in the BR field<br>
indicates the bandwidth that the MS requests to be additionally allocated later.<br>
That is, the values of the Type field set to '000' and the BR field set to '200'<br>
indicate that the MS requests additional allocation of a bandwidth of 200.<br>
If the value of the Type field is set to '001', it indicates whether the<br>
bandwidth allocation request is aggregate, i.e. a value set later in the BR field<br>
indicates the required full bandwidth that the MS should be allocated. That is, if<br>
the value of the Type field is set to '001' and the value of the BR field is set to<br>
'800', it indicates that a bandwidth of 800, determined by summing up the MS's<br>
presently allocated bandwidth and the bandwidth the MS will be allocated<br>
through the bandwidth allocation request, is allocated to the MS.<br>
When transmitting the header of the Bandwidth Request message as an<br>
ACK message for the RNG-RSP message, unsolicited SBC-RSP message and<br>
unsolicited REG-RSP message in the network re-entry procedure, the MS sets a<br>
value of the BR field to '0'. Upon reception of the header of the Bandwidth<br>
Request message with the BR field = 0, the target BS that performs the network<br>
re-entry procedure with the MS recognizes the ACK message for the RNG-RSP<br>
message, unsolicited SBC-RSP message or unsolicited REG-RSP message.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 4A and 4B, a description will be made of an operation<br>
process of an MS in the network re-entry procedure based on the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV in the IEEE 802.16e communication system according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIGs. 4A and 4B are flowcharts illustrating an operation process of an MS<br>
in a network re-entry procedure based on HO Process Optimization TLV in an<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 4A and 4B, in step 411, an MS, after handover from a<br><br>
-16-<br>
serving BS to a target BS, acquires downlink synchronization with the target BS,<br>
and receives parameters to be used in a downlink and an uplink. In step 413, the<br>
MS transmits an RNG-REQ message to the target BS. In step 415, the MS<br>
receives an RNG-RSP message including HO Process Optimization TLV from<br>
the target BS in response to the RNG-REQ message. In step 417, the MS<br>
transmits an RNG-RSP ACK message indicating normal reception of the RNG-<br>
RSP message from the target BS. The RNG-RSP ACK message, as described<br>
with reference to Table 3 to Table 5, can be implemented using the Network re-<br>
entry confirm extended sub-header, the CQICH Allocation Request message<br>
header, or the Bandwidth Request message header, and a detailed description<br>
thereof is given above.<br>
In step 419, the MS analyzes the HO Process Optimization TLV received<br>
through the RNG-RSP message and determines whether there is a need to receive<br>
an unsolicited SBC-RSP message and an unsolicited REG-RSP message from the<br>
target BS. Upon determining that there is a need to receive the unsolicited SBC-<br>
RSP message and the unsolicited REG-RSP message from the target BS, the MS<br>
receives the unsolicited SBC-RSP message from the target BS in step 421.<br>
Thereafter, in step 423, the MS transmits an SBC-RSP ACK message indicating<br>
normal reception of the unsolicited SBC-RSP message to the target BS. The SBC-<br>
RSP ACK message, as described with reference to Table 3 to Table 5, can be<br>
implemented using the Network reentry confirm extended sub-header, the<br>
CQICH Allocation Request message header or the Bandwidth Request message<br>
header, and a detailed description thereof is given above.<br>
In step 425, the MS receives the unsolicited REG-RSP message from the<br>
target BS. In step 427, the MS transmits an REG-RSP ACK message indicating<br>
normal reception of the unsolicited REG-RSP message to the target BS. The<br>
REG-RSP ACK message, as described with reference to Table 3 through Table 5,<br>
can be complemented using the Network re-entry confirm extended sub-header,<br>
the CQICH Allocation Request message header or the Bandwidth Request<br>
message header, and a detailed description thereof is given above. In step 429, the<br>
MS completes the network re-entry procedure with the target BS, and then ends<br>
the operation process.<br><br>
-17-<br>
However, upon determining in step 419 that there is no need to receive<br>
both the unsolicited SBC-RSP message and the unsolicited REG-RSP message<br>
from the target BS, the MS determines in step 431 whether there is a need to<br>
receive only the unsolicited SBC-RSP message from the target BS. If there is a<br>
need to receive only the unsolicited SBC-RSP message from the target BS, the<br>
MS receives the unsolicited SBC-RSP message from the target BS in step 433.<br>
Thereafter, in step 435, the MS transmits an SBC-RSP ACK message indicating<br>
normal reception of the unsolicited SBC-RSP message to the target BS, and then<br>
proceeds to step 429.<br>
However, upon determining in step 431 that there is no need to receive the<br>
unsolicited SBC-RSP message from the target BS, the MS determines in step 437<br>
whether there is a need to receive only the unsolicited REG-RSP message from<br>
the target BS. Upon determining that there is a need to receive only the<br>
unsolicited REG-RSP message from the target BS, the MS receives the<br>
unsolicited REG-RSP message from the target BS in step 439. Thereafter, in step<br>
441, the MS transmits a REG-RSP ACK message indicating normal reception of<br>
the unsolicited REG-RSP message to the target BS, and then proceeds to step 429.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 437 that there is no need to receive the<br>
unsolicited REG-RSP message from the target BS, i.e. if there is no more network<br>
re-entry procedure to perform other than the RNG-RSP message reception<br>
process according to the HO Process Optimization TLV, the target BS and the<br>
MS support a virtual SDU SN, and a value of Bit#6 of the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV bitmap is set to T, then the target BS allocates an uplink<br>
resource with which the MS can transmit an SN Report header, and the MS<br>
transmits the SN Report header to the target BS using the uplink resource<br>
allocated from the target BS. In this case, the MS transmits the SN Report header<br>
without transmitting the ACK message having the format described with<br>
reference to Table 3 to Table 5, replacing the transmission of the ACK message<br>
for the RNG-RSP message. Given that a format of the SN Report header is not<br>
directly related to the gist of the present invention, a detailed description thereof<br>
is omitted herein.<br>
The operation process of the MS in the network re-entry procedure based<br><br>
-18-<br>
on the HO Process Optimization TLV in the IEEE 802.16e communication<br>
system according to the present invention has been described herein with<br>
reference to FIGs. 4A and 4B. Next, with reference to FIGs. 5A and 5B, a<br>
description will be made of an operation process of a target BS in a network re-<br>
entry procedure based on HO Process Optimization TLV in an IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system according to the present invention.<br>
FIGs. 5 A and 5B are flowcharts illustrating an operation process of a target<br>
BS in a network re-entry procedure based on HO Process Optimization TLV in an<br>
IEEE 802.16e communication system according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 5A and 5B, in step 511, the target BS receives an RNG-<br>
REQ message from an MS. In step 513, the target BS transmits an RNG-RSP<br>
message including HO Process Optimization TLV to the MS in response to the<br>
RNG-REQ message. In step 515, the target BS receives an RNG-RSP ACK<br>
message indicating normal reception of the RNG-RSP message from the MS. The<br>
RNG-RSP ACK message, as described herein with reference to Table 3 to Table<br>
5, can be implemented using the Network re-entry confirm extended sub-header,<br>
the CQICH Allocation Request message header or the Bandwidth Request<br>
message header, for which a detailed description thereof is set forth above.<br>
In step 517, the target BS determines whether there is a need to transmit<br>
both of an unsolicited SBC-RSP message and an unsolicited REG-RSP message<br>
to the MS. If it is determined that there is a need to transmit both of the<br>
unsolicited SBC-RSP message and the unsolicited REG-RSP message to the MS,<br>
the target BS transmits the unsolicited SBC-RSP message to the MS in step 519.<br>
In step 521, the target BS receives an SBC-RSP ACK message indicating<br>
normal reception of the unsolicited SBC-RSP message from the MS. The SBC-<br>
RSP ACK message, as described with reference to Table 3 to Table 5, can be<br>
implemented using the Network re-entry confirm extended sub-header, the<br>
CQICH Allocation Request message header or the Bandwidth Request message<br>
header, and a detailed description thereof is given above.<br>
In step 523, the target BS transmits an unsolicited REG-RSP message to<br><br>
-19-<br>
the MS. In step 525, the target BS receives an REG-RSP ACK message indicating<br>
normal reception of the unsolicited REG-RSP message from the MS. The REG-<br>
RSP ACK message, as described with reference to Table 3 to Table 5, can be<br>
implemented using the Network re-entry confirm extended sub-header, the<br>
CQICH Allocation Request message header or the Bandwidth Request message<br>
header, and a detailed description thereof is given above. In step 527, the target<br>
BS completes the network re-entry procedure with the MS, and then ends the<br>
operation process.<br>
However, upon determining in step 517 that there is no need to transmit<br>
both of the unsolicited SBC-RSP message and the unsolicited REG-RSP message<br>
to the MS, the target BS determines in step 529 whether there is a need to<br>
transmit only the unsolicited SBC-RSP message to the MS. Upon determining<br>
that there is a need to transmit only the unsolicited SBC-RSP message to the MS,<br>
the target BS transmits the unsolicited SBC-RSP message to the MS in step 531.<br>
Thereafter, in step 533, the target BS receives an SBC-RSP ACK message<br>
indicating normal reception of the unsolicited SBC-RSP message from the MS,<br>
and then proceeds to step 527.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 529 that there is not need to transmit<br>
only the unsolicited SBC-RSP message to the MS, the target BS determines in<br>
step 535 whether there is a need to transmit only the unsolicited REG-RSP<br>
message to the MS. If it is determined that there is a need to transmit only the<br>
unsolicited REG-RSP message to the MS, the target BS transmits the unsolicited<br>
REG-RSP message to the MS in step 537. Thereafter, in step 539, the target BS<br>
receives a REG-RSP ACK message indicating normal reception of the unsolicited<br>
REG-RSP message from the MS, and then proceeds to step 527.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 535 that there is no need to transmit<br>
only the unsolicited REG-RSP message to the MS, i.e. if there is no more network<br>
re-entry procedure to perform other than the RNG-RSP message transmission<br>
process according to the HO Process Optimization TLV, the target BS and the<br>
MS support a virtual SDU SN, and a value of Bit#6 of the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV bitmap is set to '1', then the target BS allocates an uplink<br>
resource with which the MS can transmit an SN Report header. Thereafter, the<br><br>
-20-<br>
target BS receives the SN Report header that the MS transmits using the uplink<br>
resource allocated thereto. In this case, the target BS receives the SN Report<br>
header without receiving the ACK message having the format described with<br>
reference to Table 3 to Table 5, replacing the reception of the ACK message for<br>
the RNG-RSP message.<br>
As can be understood from the foregoing description, in the<br>
communication system, when an MS performs a network re-entry procedure with<br>
a target BS after its connection switching to the target BS, the MS can transmit a<br>
notification indicating completion of the network re-entry procedure to the target<br>
BS, thereby preventing a possible delay from occurring between the MS and the<br>
target BS and improving the entire system performance.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
