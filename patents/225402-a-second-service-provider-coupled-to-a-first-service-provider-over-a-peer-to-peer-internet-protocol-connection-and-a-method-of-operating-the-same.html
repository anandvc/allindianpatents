BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is related to the field of communications, and in particular, to the use of<br>
peer-to-peer IP connections to extend the service reach of packet telephony networks.<br>
2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Communication Service Provider Environment in the Prior Art<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a service provider environment in the prior art. End-user systems 130,<br>
140, 150 are coupled to first service provider 110 over respective connections 131, 141,<br>
151. End-user systems 160, 170, 180 are coupled to second service provider 120 over<br>
respective connections 161, 171, 181. First service provider 110 is coupled to public<br>
telephone network 100 and Internet 101 by respective connections 112 and 113.<br>
Second service provider 120 is coupled to public telephone network 100 and Internet<br>
101 by respective connections 121, 122-123. First service provider 110 is coupled to<br>
second service provider 120 over peer-to-peer Internet Protocol (IP) connection 111.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates first service provider 110 in the prior art. First service provider 110<br>
includes mux system 211, router 212, services network 213, telephony gateway 214,<br>
and internet gateway 215. Mux system 211 is coupled to router 212 and to connections<br>
131, 141, 151 from end-user systems 130, 140, 150. Router 212 is coupled to services<br>
network 213, telephony gateway 214, and Internet gateway 215. Router 212 is also<br>
coupled to peer-<br>
to-peer IP connection 111 to second service provider 120. Telephony gateway 214 is<br>
coupled to connection 113 to public telephone network 100. Internet gateway 215 is<br>
coupled to connection 112 to Internet 101.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates second service provider 120 in the prior art. Second service<br>
provider 120 includes router 312 and packet telephony network 313. Router 312 is coupled<br>
to peer-to-peer IP connection 111 to first service provider 110 and connection 123 to<br>
Internet 101. Packet telephony network 313 is coupled to connections 161, 171, 181 to end-<br>
user systems 160, 170, 180. Packet telephony network 313 is also coupled to connection<br>
122 to Internet 101 and to connection 121 to public telephone network 100.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1-3, end-user systems 130, 140, 150 use first service provider 110<br>
to access public telephone network 100 and Internet 101. First service provider 110<br>
provides telephony service through telephony gateway 214 and provides Internet access<br>
through Internet gateway 215. First service provider 110 may also provide other services<br>
through services network 213.<br>
End-user systems 160, 170, 180 use second service provider 120 to access packet<br>
telephony network 313. Packet telephony network 313 provides telephone services and<br>
Internet access over a packet network. End-user systems 160, 170, 180 include interface<br>
devices for use between their computers or telephones and packet telephony network 313.<br>
Using end-user systems 160, 170, 180 and packet telephony network 313, available<br>
telephony features include: 3-way calling, call forwarding, message waiting notification,<br>
ring-again, caller ID, voice-activated dialing, unified messaging, and unified<br>
communications.<br>
Unfortunately, end-users of first service provider 110 do not have effective access to<br>
packet telephony network 313. To access packet-based telephony, end-user systems 130,<br>
140,150 typically employ computer telephony over Internet 101. Computer telephony<br>
requires two fairly sophisticated end-users who configure their computers to operate like<br>
telephones — including microphone, speaker, telephone circuitry, and user interface — and<br>
then operate their computers to exchange voice IP packets with one another over Internet<br>
101. For example, end-user systems 130,140 would exchange voice IP packets over first<br>
service provider 110 and Internet 101. Computer telephony is much more complex than<br>
simply plugging-in a telephone and dialing a familiar number.<br>
In contrast, end-users of second service provider 120 may plug standard telephones<br>
into their interface devices, and with relative ease, enjoy packet-based telephony service<br>
using a standard telephone. One example of a packet telephony network and associated end-<br>
user systems are the Integrated On-demand Network (ION) provided by Sprint Corporation.<br>
Peer-to-Peer IP Connections in the Prior Art<br>
Peer-to-peer DP connections are established between two different service providers<br>
to exchange IP traffic destined for the other service provider. It is important for a service<br>
provider to transfer this IP traffic as soon as possible to relieve other systems in that service<br>
provider from handling the traffic. For example, router 212 can transfer IP traffic to second<br>
service provider 120 over two different routes: 1) peer-to-peer IP connection 111, or 2)<br>
Internet gateway 215 and Internet 101. First service provider 110 wants to use peer-to-peer<br>
IP connection 111 whenever possible to reserve capacity through Internet gateway 215 for<br>
other IP traffic.<br>
A brief discussion of IP addressing follows to further illustrate peer-to-peer IP<br>
connections. An Internet address is currently a 32-bit number that is comprised of four 8-bit<br>
blocks that are separated by decimals. It is expected that this addressing scheme will be<br>
expanded to a 128-bit number that is separated into four 32-bit blocks. An Internet address<br>
is also separated into a network part and a host part. The network part identifies the<br>
destination network, and the host part identifies the destination host on the destination<br>
network. Internet addresses are separated into classes based on how many bits are used for<br>
the network part, and how many bits are used for the host part. Class "A" addresses use the<br>
first block for the network part and the final three blocks for the host part. Class "B"<br>
addresses use the first two blocks for the network part and the final two blocks for the host<br>
part. Class "C" addresses use the first three blocks for the network part and the final block<br>
for the host part.<br>
Class A addresses are typically not used because the first block In an Internet address<br>
typically carries "www" for the world wide web, and the subnet on the web must be<br>
identified in the second and/or third blocks. Class B addresses are rare because if the first<br>
block identifies "www", then only eight bits remain to provide a mere 256 Class B<br>
addresses on the web.<br>
Internet backbone providers cany large amounts of Internet traffic and typically host<br>
the largest and most popular websites. The rare Class B addresses are often used by Internet<br>
backbone providers to collect IP traffic for their portion of the backbone, and consequently,<br>
these Class B addresses are used by other service providers to quickly identify and dump IP<br>
traffic over peer-to-peer connections to the Internet backbone provider. In the above<br>
example, second service provider 120 could be an Internet backbone provider with Class B<br>
addresses. Thus, when router 212 receives Internet traffic with these class B addresses from<br>
end-user systems 130, 140, 150, router 212 transfers this IP traffic over peer-to-peer<br>
connection 111 to second service provider 120. This routing is far more efficient than<br>
transferring the IP traffic through Internet Gateway 215 and over Internet 101 to second<br>
service provider 120.<br>
Problems in the Prior Art<br>
The above networking arrangement creates a serious problem for end-users. The<br>
service provider who owns the connection to the end-user has a near monopoly over local<br>
services for that end-user. Exorbitant costs prevent other service providers from deploying<br>
their own end-user connections in competition with existing service providers. The<br>
deregulation that was supposed to usher in local competition has yet to deliver a meaningful<br>
level of competition in some areas.<br>
Most service providers do not offer any packet-based telephony services that have a<br>
legitithate Quality of Service (QoS). End-users are left with a few undesirable choices:<br>
order multiple phone lines, order an expensive T1 connection, or employ computer<br>
telephony over the Internet. End-users in remote areas may not even have all of these<br>
choices.<br>
Unfortunately, computer telephony requires a computer as opposed to a telephone.<br>
The computer must be configured with a telephony user interface, including microphone,<br>
speaker, and computer telephony software. Computer telephony still requires a relatively<br>
sophisticated end-user.<br>
The use of the Internet for computer telephony compounds the problem. The<br>
Internet offers only best effort delivery without any guaranteed QoS. The Internet may<br>
require 15 hops to reach a destination adding unacceptable delay to voice communications.<br>
The Internet offers little security and allows hackers to listen to unsophisticated users.<br>
Computer telephony over the Internet does not offer the robust features that some end-users<br>
desire, such as voice mail, operator assistance, and call forwarding.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention helps solve the above problems with technology that allows an end-<br>
user who is connected to a first service provider to obtain packet-based telephony services<br>
from a second service provider, even though the end-user is not directly connected to the<br>
second service provider. To access the packet-based telephony services of the second<br>
service provider, the end-user system uses an IP tunnel through both the first service<br>
provider and a peer-to-peer IP connection between the first and second service providers.<br>
Advantageously, the end-user may choose packet-based services from many service<br>
providers with peer-to-peer IP connections to the first service provider. This drathatically<br>
expands end-user choice and stimulates meaningful competition at the service level. The<br>
technology offers numerous other advantages.<br>
The second service provider may implement the technology with few or no changes<br>
to their packet telephony network, so the system may be quickly and cheaply deployed. For<br>
a service provider with many existing peer-to-peer IP connections, the technology greatly<br>
expands potential service coverage areas - even to end-users in remote areas. The end-user<br>
obtains true QoS on packet-based telephony, and they may obtain many of the features that<br>
currently enjoy with conventional telephone services, such as voice mail and call<br>
forwarding. Because the technology restricts or eliminates use of the Internet, issues like<br>
communication delay and security are drathatically improved.<br>
Some examples of the invention include a second service provider that is coupled to<br>
a first service provider over a peer-to-peer Internet Protocol (EP) connection. The first<br>
service provider is coupled to end-user systems over IP connections. The second service<br>
provider comprises a router, service portal, and packet telephony network. The router routes<br>
a first set of IP packets between the peer-to-peer IP connection and a service connection<br>
based on a first set of IP addresses in the first set of the IP packets. The router routes a<br>
second set of the IP packets between the peer-to-peer IP connection and an Internet<br>
backbone IP connection based on a second set of the IP addresses in the second set of the IP<br>
packets. The service portal exchanges the first set of the IP packets with the service<br>
connection. The service portal provides protocol conversion between the first set of the IP<br>
packets and a first set of the service packets. The service portal exchanges the first set<br>
of the service packets with the packet telephony network. The packet telephony<br>
network routes the service packets to provide telephony service.<br>
In some examples of the invention, the end-user systems exchange the first set<br>
of the IP packets including the first set of the IP addresses with the first service provider<br>
over the IP connections, and the first service provider routes the first set of the IP<br>
packets to the second service provider over the peer-to-peer IP connection based on<br>
the first set of the IP addresses.<br>
In some examples of the invention, the first set of the IP packets from the end-<br>
user systems include packet telephony network addresses and the service portal<br>
replaces the first set of the IP addresses in the first set of the IP packets from the end-<br>
user systems with the packet telephony network addresses.<br>
In some examples of the invention, the service packets comprise ATM cells and<br>
the packet telephony network is configured to route the ATM cells to provide the<br>
telephony service.<br>
In some examples of the invention, the first set of the IP packets encapsulate<br>
the ATM cells.<br>
In some examples of the invention, the first set of the IP packets is not routed<br>
over a public Internet.<br>
In some examples of the invention, the first set of the IP packets carries<br>
telephony voice and signaling.<br>
In some examples of the invention, the first set of the IP addresses and the<br>
second set of the IP addresses comprise Class B addresses for the second service<br>
provider.<br>
In some examples of the invention, the first set of the IP addresses comprise<br>
Class B addresses for the packet telephony network in the second sen/ice provider.<br>
In some examples of the invention, the service portal uses dynamically-<br>
assigned end-user IP addresses.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIGS. 4-9 and the following description depict specific examples to teach those<br>
skilled in the art how to make and use the best mode of the invention. For the purpose of<br>
teaching inventive principles, some conventional aspects have been simplified or omitted.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate variations from these examples that fall within the<br>
scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the features described<br>
below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a<br>
result, the invention is not limited to the specific examples described below, but only by the<br>
claims and their equivalents.<br>
Communication Service Provider Environment — FIGS. 4-6<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a service provider environment in the prior art. End-user systems<br>
430,440, 450 are coupled to first service provider 410 over respective connections 431,<br>
441,451. End-user systems 460, 470,480 are coupled to second service provider 420 over<br>
respective connections 461, 471,481. First service provider 410 is coupled to public<br>
telephone network 400 and Internet 401 by respective connections 412 and 413. Second<br>
service provider 420 is coupled to public telephone network 400 and Internet 401 by<br>
respective connections 421, 422-423. First service provider 410 is coupled to second<br>
service provider 420 over peer-to-peer IP connection 411.<br>
In the context of the invention, a "service provider" means a corporate entity that<br>
offers communication services to end-users. Different corporate entities that do not exert<br>
majority-ownership over one another comprise "different service providers". For example,<br>
AT&amp;T, WorldCom, Sprint, British Telecom, NT&amp;T, Verizon, SBC, Qwest, and Bell South<br>
are current examples of different service providers. In the context of the invention, a "peer-<br>
to-peer IP connection" means an IP connection between different service providers that is<br>
established by mutual agreement for the exchange of IP traffic.<br>
If desired, the following elements could be the same as in the prior art - although<br>
modifications may still be made without deviating from the invention: first service provider<br>
410, public telephone network 400, Internet 401, end-user systems 460, 470,480, and<br>
connections 411-413, 421-423, 431,441,451, 461, 471, 481.<br>
End-user systems 430, 440, 450 could be stand-alone enclosures with internal<br>
circuitry, software, and interfaces; computers having network and telephony interfaces and<br>
running specialized software; communications devices, such as telephones and personal<br>
digital assistants, with embedded functionality; or some other properly configured device or<br>
system. Connections 431,441, 451 could be twisted pair wires, coaxial cable, optical fiber,<br>
wireless link, or some other type of communication connection. Connections 431, 441, 451<br>
may utilize Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), spread spectrum, Ethernet, Internet Protocol (IP).<br>
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), or some other protocol. It should be understood that<br>
interface components, such as modems and transceivers, could either be a part of end-user<br>
systems 430, 440, 450, or a part of connections 431, 441, 451.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates second service provider 420 in the prior art. Second service<br>
provider 420 includes router 512, packet telephony network 513. and service portal 514.<br>
Router 512 is coupled to peer-to-peer IP connection 411 to first service provider 410.<br>
Router 512 is coupled to IP backbone connection 423 to Internet 401. Router is coupled to,<br>
service connection 515 to service portal 514. Packet telephony network 513 is coupled to<br>
connections 461, 471,481 to end-user systems 460, 470,480. Packet telephony network<br>
513 is coupled to IP connection 422 to Internet 401. Packet telephony network 513 is<br>
coupled to telephony connection 421 to public telephone network 400. Packet telephony<br>
network 513 is coupled to service connection 516 to service portal 514.<br>
If desired, all elements in second service provider 420, except for service portal 514<br>
and service connections 515-516, could be the same as in the prior art - although<br>
modifications may still be made without deviating from the invention. In some examples of<br>
the invention, service connection 515 is an IP connection, and service connection 516 is an<br>
ATM connection, but service connections 515-516 could use other protocols.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 4-5, end-user systems 430,440, 450 and service portal 514<br>
exchange a first set of IP packets that carry telephony voice and signaling by placing a first<br>
set of IP addresses in these IP packets. First service provider 410 routes the first set of IP<br>
packets between end-user connections 431, 441, 451 and peer-to-peer IP connection 411<br>
based on the first set of IP addresses. Router 512 routes the first set of IF' packets between<br>
peer-to-peer IP connection 411 and service connection 515 based on the first set of IP<br>
addresses. For packet transfers from end-user systems 430, 440, 450 to service portal 514,<br>
these IP addresses could be Class B IP addresses for second service provider 420 that<br>
identify packet telephony network 513. For packet transfers from service portal 514 to end-<br>
user systems 530, 540, 550, these IP addresses could be end-user IP addresses.<br>
Thus, Point-to-Point Protocol Internet over Ethernet (PPPOE) tunnels may be established<br>
between end-user devices 430,440, 450 and service portal 514 using proper IP addressing,<br>
such as a class B address for second service provider 420 and the IP addresses for the end-<br>
users. Advantageously, the first set of IP packets is not routed over Internet 401, and as a<br>
result, security and service control is drathatically improved. Using end-user systems 430,<br>
440, 450 and packet telephony network 313, available telephony features include: 3-way<br>
calling, call forwarding, message waiting notification, ring-again, caller ID, voice-activated<br>
dialing, unified messaging, and unified communications.<br>
End-user systems 430,440, 450 and Internet 401 may exchange a second set of IP<br>
packets by placing a second set of IP addresses in these IP packets. First service provider<br>
410 routes the second set of IP packets between end-user connections 431, 441, 451 and<br>
peer-to-peer IP connection 411 based on the second set of IP addresses. Router 512 routes<br>
the second set of IP packets between peer-to-peer IP connection 411 and Internet backbone<br>
IP connection 423 based on the second set of IP addresses. For packet transfers from end-<br>
user systems 430,440,450 to Internet 401, these IP addresses could be Class B IP addresses<br>
for second service provider 420 that identify Internet 401. For packet transfers from Internet<br>
401 to end-user systems 530, 540, 550, the second set of IP addresses could be the same<br>
end-user IP addresses as in the first set.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates service portal 514 in an example of the invention. Service portal<br>
514 includes IP interface 650, interworking unit 651, and service interface 652. IP interface<br>
650 is coupled to service connection 515 and interworking unit 651. service interface 652<br>
is coupled to interworking unit 651 and service connection 516.<br>
IP interface 650 exchanges the first set of IP packets between service connection 515<br>
and interworking unit 651. Interworking unit 651 provides protocol conversion between the<br>
first set of IP packets and a first set of service packets. Protocol conversion may comprise<br>
replacing the IP address with an address suitable for packet telephony network 513. Service<br>
interface 652 exchanges the first set of service packets between interworking unit 651 and<br>
service connection 516.<br>
Packet telephony network 513 is configured to route service packets between<br>
network ports to provide telephony service through the network ports. Service connection<br>
516 is coupled to a first set of these network ports. Thus, packet telephony network 513<br>
provides telephony service to end-user systems 530, 540, 550 through the first set of<br>
network ports.<br>
Advantageously, service portal 514 is designed to minimize or eliminate changes to<br>
first service provider 410 and second service provider 420. First service provider 410<br>
exchanges IP packets between connections 411, 431, 441,451 as in the prior art. Router<br>
512 exchanges IP packets with service portal 514 as it does with Internet 401. Packet<br>
telephony network 513 exchanges service packets with service portal 514 as it would with<br>
network ports for connections 461,471, 481. Based on this disclosure, those skilled in the<br>
art will appreciate how to modify existing products, such as Redback equipment, to make<br>
and use service portal 514.<br>
End-user systems 430,440,450 place addresses for packet telephony network 513 in<br>
the body of the first set of IP packets transferred to service portal 514. To perform protocol<br>
conversion on these IP packets, service portal 514 replaces the first set of IP addresses with<br>
the packet telephony network addresses in the body of the IP packets. For IP packets<br>
transferred to end-user systems 430,440, 450, interworking unit 513 may maintain and use a<br>
list of dynamically-assigned end-user IP addresses.<br>
In some examples of the invention, the service packets comprise ATM cells and<br>
packet telephony network 513 is configured to route the ATM cells between the network<br>
ports to provide telephony service with a guaranteed Quality-of-Service. In these examples<br>
of the invention, the first set of IP packets may encapsulate the ATM cells, so service portal<br>
may strip off the IP wrapper and transfer the de-encapsulated ATM cells to service<br>
connection 516. Service portal 514 may use various technologies such as Media Gateway<br>
Control Protocol (MGCP), Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP), Simple Internet<br>
Protocol (SIP), IP, ATM, IPSEC, and IEEE 802.1P and 1Q.<br>
Consider an example where end-user system 430 makes a packet telephony call to<br>
end-user system 480. To establish the call connection, end-user system 430 will send<br>
signaling to packet telephony network 513. End-user system 430 addresses the signaling to<br>
a service node in packet telephony network 513 and encapsulates the signaling in an IP<br>
wrapper with a first set IP address. Based on the first set IP address, first and second service<br>
providers 410, 420 route the signaling to service portal 514. Service portal 514 replaces the<br>
first set IP address with the service node address and forwards the signaling to packet<br>
telephony network 513. Packet telephony network 513 routes the signaling to the service<br>
node. The service node notifies end-user system 480 of the incoming call and establishes<br>
call connections through packet telephony network 513.<br>
For voice packets from end-user system 430 to end-user system 480, end-user<br>
system 430 addresses the voice packets to end-user system 480 and encapsulates the voice<br>
packets in an IP wrapper with a first set IP address. Based on the first set IP address, first<br>
and second service providers 410, 420 route the voice packets to service portal 514. Service<br>
portal 514 replaces the first set IP address with the end-user 480 address and forwards the<br>
voice packets to packet telephony network 513. Packet telephony network 513 routes the<br>
voice packets to end-user 480.<br>
For voice packets from end-user system 480 to end-user system 430, end-user<br>
system 480 addresses the voice packets to end-user system 430. Based on the end-user<br>
system 430 address, packet telephony network 513 routes the voice packets to service portal<br>
514. Service portal 514 and first service provider 410 route these voice packets to end-user<br>
430 based on the end-user 430 address. In some cases, service portal 514 may encapsulate<br>
ATM voice cells addressed to end-user 430 in an IP wrapper with and end-user 430 IP<br>
address.<br>
End-User Systems - FIGS. 7-8<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates end-user system 430 in an example of the invention. End-user<br>
system 430 includes telephony interface 731, control circuitry 732, and network interface<br>
733. Control circuitry includes bearer circuitry 734 and signaling circuitry 735. Telephony<br>
interface 731 and network interface 733 are both coupled to bearer circuitry 734 and<br>
signaling circuitry 735.<br>
Telephony interface 731 exchanges telephony signals with a telephone connection to<br>
telephones. For conventional analog telephones, these signals include: power, dial tone,<br>
digit tones, ring current, ringback, slow and fast busy, caller ID, and message waiting. In<br>
some cases, end-user system 430 may be integrated into a telephone. In these cases the<br>
telephony signals from telephony interface 731 would drive the telephone to process or<br>
generate the telephony signals described above.<br>
Network interface 733 exchanges IP packets with a network IP interface for<br>
connection 431, and the special addressing required for these packets is discussed below. A<br>
modem may be included within network interface 733 or as a part of connection 430.<br>
Typically, the end-user may have an existing modem that can be used, so network interface<br>
733 could be configured to link in to the existing modem, or it could be configured with a<br>
modem of its own.<br>
Control circuitry 732 provides the interface between telephony interface 731 and<br>
network interface 733. Bearer circuitry 734 processes voice signals, and signaling circuitry<br>
735 processes the telephony signaling required to set-up and tear down telephone calls.<br>
Control circuitry 732 manages services including voice telephony, video/audio file transfer,<br>
subnet bandwidth management, packet admission control, packet prioritization, packet QoS,<br>
and packet security. Control circuitry 732 may use various technologies such as MGCP,<br>
SGCP, SIP, IP, ATM, IPSEC, Resource Reservation Set-up Protocol (RSVP), Diffserv<br>
Protocol, Subnetwork Bandwidth Management (SBM), and IEEE 802.1P and 1Q. Through<br>
packet telephony network 513 and end-user system 430, available telephony features<br>
include: 3-way calling, call forwarding, message waiting notification, ring-again, caller ID,<br>
voice-activated dialing, unified messaging, and unified communications. Based on this<br>
disclosure, those skilled in the art will appreciate how to modify existing end-user<br>
equipment, such as end-user systems 160, 170, 180, to make and use end-user system 430.<br>
End-user system 430 must be configured to properly address IP packets to ensure<br>
delivery to service portal 514 over peer-to-peer IP connection 411. Consider a first set of IP<br>
packets directed to packet telephony network 513 from end-user system 430. Control<br>
circuitry 732 places both a first IP address and packet telephony network addresses in the<br>
first set of the IP packets. Using the first IP address, first service provider 410 routes the<br>
first set of IP packets over peer-to-peer IP connection 411 to second service provider 420,<br>
and second service provider 420 routes the first set of the IP packets to service portal 514.<br>
Service portal 514 replaces the first IP address with the packet telephony network addresses<br>
and forwards these packets to packet telephony network 513. Packet telephony network 513<br>
provides telephony services to the first set of packets based on the network addresses.<br>
In some examples, control circuitry 732 generates ATM cells with network<br>
addresses that are suitable for packet telephony network 513. These ATM cells may<br>
themselves encapsulate IP packets that use MGCP and IPSEC. The ATM cells are then<br>
encapsulated in IP packets that have the Class B IP address for service portal 514. Service<br>
portal 514 merely strips off the external IP wrapper and provides the ATM cells to packet<br>
telephony network 513. Thus, service portal 514 appears to packet telephony network 514<br>
as a group of end-users (i.e. 460,470, 480).<br>
For packet transfers from service portal 514 to end-user systems 430, 440, 450,<br>
service portal 514 uses end-user IP addresses that maybe dynamically assigned and tracked.<br>
End-user system 430 may handle these packets in the normal fashion or may strip off the IP<br>
wrapper to process an encapsulated ATM cell.<br>
End-user system 430 could comprise a single stand-alone enclosure. End-user<br>
system 430 could be integrated into a telephone. End-user system 430 could use a<br>
microprocessor in a personal computer for control circuitry 732 with telephony interface<br>
731 and network interface 733 located on a computer card.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates end-user system 440 in an example of the invention. End-user<br>
system 440 includes user interface 841, network interface 842, processing system 843, and<br>
storage system 844. Storage system 844 stores control software 845. Processing system<br>
843 is linked to user interface 841, network interface 842, and storage system 843.<br>
End-user system 440 could be comprised of a programmed general-purpose<br>
computer, although those skilled in the art will appreciate that programmable or special<br>
purpose circuitry and equipment may be used. End-user system 440 may use a client server<br>
architecture where operations are distributed among a server system and client devices that<br>
together comprises elements 841-845.<br>
User interface 841 could comprise a microphone, speaker, keyboard, mouse, voice<br>
recognition interface, graphical display, touchscreen, or some other type of user device.<br>
Network interface 842 could comprise a network interface card or some other<br>
communication device. Network interface 842 may be distributed among multiple<br>
communication devices. Network interface 842 may have a modem and telephone jacks to<br>
respectively interface with connection 441 and analog telephones.<br>
Processing system 843 could comprise a computer microprocessor, logic circuit, or<br>
some other processing device. Processing system 843 may be distributed among multiple<br>
processing devices. Storage system 844 could comprise a disk, tape, integrated circuit,<br>
server, or some other memory device. Storage system 844 may be distributed among<br>
multiple memory devices.<br>
Processing system 843 retrieves and executes control software 845 from storage<br>
system 844. Control software 845 could comprise an application program, firmware, or<br>
some other form of machine-readable processing instructions. When executed by<br>
processing system 843, control software 845 directs processing system 843 to operate in<br>
accord with the invention.<br>
Processing system 843 controls the telephone jacks to exchange telephony signals<br>
with a telephone connection to the telephones. For conventional analog telephones, these<br>
signals include: power, dial tone, digit tones, ring current, ringback, slow and fast busy,<br>
caller ID, and message waiting. Processing system 843 may also control user interface<br>
components, such as display, microphone, and speaker, to provide telephony service through<br>
user interface 841. Processing system 843 controls the modem to exchange IP packets with<br>
connection 441.<br>
Processing system 843 processes voice signals and telephony signaling. Processing<br>
system 843 manages services including voice telephony, video and audio file transfer,<br>
subnet bandwidth management, packet admission control, packet prioritization, packet QoS,<br>
and packet security. Processing system 843 may use various technologies such as MGCP,<br>
SGCP, SIP, IP, ATM, IPSEC, Resource Reservation Set-up Protocol (RSVP), Diffserv<br>
Protocol, Subnetwork Bandwidth Management (SBM), and IEEE 802. IP and 1Q. Through<br>
packet telephony network 513 and end-user system 440, available telephony features<br>
include: 3-way calling, call forwarding, message waiting notification, ring-again, caller ID,<br>
voice-activated dialing, unified messaging, and unified communications. Based on this<br>
disclosure, those skilled in the art will appreciate how to configure existing computers to<br>
make and use end-user system 440.<br>
Processing system 843 must be configured to properly address IP packets to ensure<br>
delivery to service portal 514 over peer-to-peer IP connection 411. For a first set of IP<br>
packets directed to packet telephony network 513 from end-user system 440, processing<br>
system 843 places both a first IP address and packet telephony network addresses in the first<br>
set of the IP packets. Using the first IP address, first service provider 410 routes the first set<br>
of IP packets over peer-to-peer IP connection 411 to second service provider 420, and<br>
second service provider 420 routes the first set of the IP packets to service portal 514.<br>
Service portal 514 replaces the first IP address with the packet telephony network addresses<br>
and forwards these packets to packet telephony network 513. Packet telephony network 513<br>
provides telephony services to the first set of packets based on the network addresses.<br>
In some examples, processing system 843 generates ATM cells with network<br>
addresses that are suitable for packet telephony network 513. These ATM cells may<br>
themselves encapsulate IP packets that use MGCP and EPSEC. The ATM cells are then<br>
encapsulated in IP packets that have the Class B IP address for service portal 514. Service<br>
portal 514 merely strips off the external IP wrapper and provides the ATM cells to packet<br>
telephony network 513. Thus, service portal 514 appears to packet telephony network 514<br>
as a group of end-users (i.e. 460, 470, 480).<br>
For packet transfers from service portal 514 to end-user systems 430, 440, 450,<br>
service portal 514 uses end-user IP addresses that may be dynamically assigned and tracked.<br>
Processing system 843 may handle these packets in the normal fashion or may strip off the<br>
IP wrapper to process an encapsulated ATM cell.<br>
Telephony Service Ordering — FIG. 9<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a method for establishing telephony service for an end-user. The<br>
end-user is provided with software and a telephone number. The software and telephone<br>
number may be provided to the end-user user through a world wide web site. The web site<br>
may also be used to receive from the end-user an end-user software registration, a grade-of-<br>
service selection, and a telephony service payment plan selection. For example, the user<br>
may register their software to receive technical support. The end-user may select a grade-of-<br>
service suitable for a home-office. The end-user may select a monthly flat rate payment<br>
plan that is billed to an office address.<br>
The end-user loads the software onto to a computer and connects the computer to a<br>
telephone and to an Internet Protocol (IP) interface to a first service provider. If the<br>
soft-ware is downloaded from the web, loading in essentially autothatic. This software is<br>
configured to direct the computer to operate as described above with respect to FIG. 8.<br>
The second service provider is configured to provide packet-based telephony service<br>
to the end-user. The packet telephony system is configured to route packets directed toward<br>
the end-user to the service portal. For IP packets from the end-user, the service portal is<br>
configured to replace the first set IP address with the packet telephony network addresses.<br>
For IP packets to the end-user, the service portal is configured to track and use dynamically-<br>
assigned end-user IP addresses. For telephone calls to the telephone number, the packet<br>
telephony network is configured to establish call connections to the service portal for packet<br>
delivery to the end-user over the peer-to-peer IP connection.<br>
In a variation to the above method, the end-user obtains a communication device<br>
from a retail establishment. The end-user accesses a web site to receive their telephone<br>
number, register their device, select a grade-of-service, and select a telephony service<br>
payment plan. The end-user connects the communication device to a telephone and to an IP<br>
interface to a first service provider. The communication device is configured to operate as<br>
described above with respect to FIG. 7. The second service provider is configured to<br>
provide packet-based telephony service to the end-user as described above.<br>
Communication Service Examples - FIGS. 10-11<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates a service example for a remote employee. Consider a situation<br>
where an employee has a home office that is distant from their corporate headquarters. The<br>
invention is readily applicable to this situation. FIG. 10 shows remote employee user<br>
system 1010, remote employee service provider 1020, IP communication system 1030, and<br>
corporate network 1040. IP communication system 1030 includes control system 1031 and<br>
IP Wide Area Network (WAN) 1032. Corporate network 1040 includes Ethernet/IP Local<br>
Area Network (LAN) 1041, IP PBX 1042, and HQ employee user system 1043. Remote<br>
employee end-user system 1010 could be similar to one of the end-user systems described<br>
above. Control system 1031 could be similar to the service portal described above.<br>
Remote employee user system 1010 and remote service provider 1020 exchange<br>
Ethernet/IP packets over Ethernet/IP connection 1051. Remote service provider 1020 and<br>
control system 1031 exchange Ethernet/IP packets over peer-to-peer Ethernet/IP connection<br>
1052. Thus, a first Ethernet/IP system is comprised of end-user system 1010, connections<br>
1051-1052, and control system 1031. IP WAN 1032 exchanges DP packets with both control<br>
system 1031 and Ethernet/IP LAN 1041. Ethernet/IP LAN 1041 exchanges Ethernet/IP<br>
packets with both Ethernet/IP PBX 1042 and HQ employee user system 1043. Thus, a<br>
second Ethernet/IP system is comprised of end-user system 1043, Ethernet/IP PBX 1042,<br>
and Ethernet/IP LAN 1041.<br>
Remote employee user system 1010 and control system 1031 use proxy addressing<br>
to communicate with one another over an IP tunnel through IP connections 1051-1052 and<br>
service provider 1020. User system 1010 and control system 1031 use Subnetwork<br>
Bandwidth Manager (SBM) to provide admission control in the first Ethernet/IP system.<br>
User system 1010 and control system 1031 use IEEE 802.1P/1Q to provide packet<br>
prioritization and queuing in the first Ethernet/IP system. Virtual Local Area Networks (V-<br>
LANs) may be established in the first Ethernet/IP system to provide service differentiation<br>
for services, such as voice over IP, multimedia collaboration, video streaming, and file<br>
transfers. In the second Ethernet/IP system, user system 1043 and LAN 1041 use SBM to<br>
provide admission control and use IEEE 802.1P/1Q to provide packet prioritization and<br>
queuing. V-LANs may be established to provide service differentiation. One example of a<br>
product that could be used to implement at least some of these technologies is XP from<br>
Microsoft.<br>
Systems 1010, 1030, and 1040 use Resource Reservation Set-up Protocol (RSVP)<br>
and Diffserv to manage end-to-end quality-of-service. RSVP is implemented in the first and<br>
second Ethernet/EP systems, and Diffserv is implemented in IP WAN 1032, so<br>
RSVP/Diffserv interfaces are utilized at WAN 1032 boundaries. IP WAN 1032 also<br>
implements admission control at its borders.<br>
To implement communication service, the remote employee obtains IP service from<br>
service provider 1020. The end user also receives an end-user system 1010 IP address that<br>
remote service provider 1020 associates with end-user system 1010.<br>
End-user systems 1010 and 1043 use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to set-up<br>
connections with one another through Ethernet/IP PBX 1042. On a voice call from the<br>
remote employee to the corporate HQ employee, end-user system 1010 generates a SIP<br>
message that is addressed to PBX 1042 and that includes the end-user system 1043 SIP<br>
address as the call destination. Once the SIP message is generated, end-user system 1010<br>
embeds the PBX 1042 address in the body of the message and places the proxy address for<br>
control system 1031 in the header of the SIP message. User system 1010 transfers the SIP<br>
message to connection 1051. Based on the proxy IP address in the header, remote service<br>
provider 1020 routes the SIP message to peer-to-peer IP connection 1052.<br>
Control system 1031 receives the SIP message with the proxy address in the header.<br>
Control system 1031 replaces the proxy address with the PBX 1042 SIP address embedded<br>
in the message. Control system 131 transfers this SIP message to IP WAN 1032. IP WAN<br>
1032 transfers the SIP message to Ethernet/IP LAN 1041 for delivery to Ethemet/IP PBX<br>
1042 based on the SIP address that is now in the header. PBX 1042 processes the SIP<br>
message to establish a voice session between user systems 1010 and 1043.<br>
On a voice call from the corporate HQ employee to the remote employee, end-user<br>
system 1043 generates a SIP message that is addressed to Ethernet/IP PBX 1042 and that<br>
includes the end-user system 1010 SIP address as the call destination. Ethernet/IP LAN<br>
1041 transfers the SIP message to Ethemet/IP PBX 1042. Ethernet/IP PBX 1042 processes<br>
the SIP message to establish a voice session between user systems 1010 and 1043.<br>
To transfer a SIP message to end-user system 1010, Ethernet/IP PBX 1042 places<br>
the SIP address of end user system 1010 in the header. Ethemet/IP LAN 1041 and IP WAN<br>
1032 transfer the SIP message to control system 1031 based on the end-user system 1010<br>
SIP address. Control system 1031 replaces the SIP address with the end-user system 1010<br>
IP address used by service provider 1020 and embeds the SIP address in the message.<br>
Control system 131 transfers the SIP message to peer-to-peer IP connection 1052. Remote<br>
service provider 1020 receives and routes the SIP message to end-user system 1010 over<br>
connection 1051 based on the end-user system 1010 IP address. End-user system 1010<br>
replaces the end-user system 1010 IP address used by service provider 1020 with the SIP<br>
address and processes the SIP message in the normal manner.<br>
For the transfer of voice packets from end-user system 1010 to end-user system<br>
1043, end-user system 1010 embeds the end-user 1043 SIP address in the voice packets and<br>
places the proxy address of control system 1031 in the header. Control system 1031<br>
replaces the proxy address with the end-user system 1043 SIP address. Control system 131<br>
transfers the voice packets to IP WAN 1032. IP WAN 1032 transfers the voice packets to<br>
Ethemet/IP LAN 1041 for delivery to end-user system 1043 based on the SIP address now<br>
in the header.<br>
For the transfer of voice packets from end-user system 1043 to end-user system<br>
1010, end-user system 1043 places the SIP address of end user 1010 in the header.<br>
Ethernet/IP LAN 1041 and IP WAN 1032 transfer the voice packets to control system 1031<br>
based on the SIP address. Control system 1031 replaces the SIP address with the end-user<br>
system 1010 IP address and embeds the SIP address in the voice packets. Control system<br>
131 transfers the voice packets to peer-to-peer IP connection 1052. Remote service provider<br>
1020 routes the voice packets to end-user system 1010 over connection 1051 based on the<br>
end-user 1010 IP address. End-user system 1010 replaces the end-user system 1010 IP<br>
address with the SIP address and processes the voice packets in the normal manner.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates another service example. The elements of FIG. 11 could be<br>
similar to like elements described above. End-user system 1110 is coupled to service<br>
provider 1120. Service provider is coupled to control system 1130 over peer-to-peer IP<br>
connection 1150. Control system 1130 is coupled to IP network 1135. IP network 1135 is<br>
coupled to system 1140. Service provider 1120 associates end-user system with a first end-<br>
user IP address and associates control system 1130 with a proxy IP address. Destination<br>
system 1140 associates end-user system 1110 with a second end-user IP address.<br>
End-user system 1110 transfers a first set of IP packets to service provider 1120.<br>
These first IP packets are addressed to the proxy IP address for control system 1130 and<br>
include an embedded destination IP address for destination system 1140. Service provider<br>
1120 transfers the first IP packets to peer-to-peer IP connection 1150 based on the proxy IP<br>
address. Control system 1130 receives the first IP packets from peer-to-peer IP connection<br>
1150, replaces the proxy IP address with the destination IP address, and transfers the first IP<br>
packets to IP network 1135. IP network 1135 receives the first IP packets from control<br>
system 1130 and transfers the first IP packets to destination system 1140 based on the<br>
destination IP address.<br>
Destination system 1140 transfers a second set of IP packets to IP network 1135.<br>
The second IP packets are addressed to end-user system 1110 using the second end-user IP<br>
address. IP network 1135 transfers the second IP packets to control system 1130 based on<br>
