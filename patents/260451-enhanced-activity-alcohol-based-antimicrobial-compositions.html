				<td>ENHANCED ACTIVITY ALCOHOL-BASED ANTIMICROBIAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to antimicrobial compositions which can<br>
be used wherever disinfecting compositions are needed, such as in a hospital,<br>
healthcare industry, workplace, recreational facility, home or similar environment.<br>
The antimicrobial compositions are particularly useful as a topical application for <br>
substrate, such as skin and can be used as a hand sanitizer or pre-surgical scrub.<br>
The compositions comprise a synergistic combination of a simple aliphatic alcohol<br>
and an activity enhancing substance, wherein the composition provides,<br>
heretofore unexpected, persistent activity against a broad range of<br>
microorganisms, including gram-negative organisms, while moisturizing the skin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Various forms of antimicrobial compositions containing alcohols are<br>
known in the art and have been used in the healthcare industry for some time.<br>
The antimicrobial compositions are typically utilized to cleanse the skin and<br>
destroy bacteria and other microorganisms present thereon, especially on the<br>
hands, arms, and face of the user.<br>
[0003] An important use of the antimicrobial composition is to disinfect the<br>
hands and fingers of a person. The composition is generally applied to, and<br>
rubbed into the hands and fingers, and subsequently allowed to evaporate from<br>
the skin. Wiping of the composition from the skin is typically not necessary<br>
because of the alcohol content of the compositions which leads to fast and<br>
essentially complete evaporation of the composition from the skin.<br>
[0004] Antimicrobial compositions in general have been used in the healthcare<br>
industry, food service industry, meat processing industry, and in the private sector<br>
by individual consumers to control and prevent the spread of potentially harmful<br>
microorganisms. The widespread use of antibacterial compositions indicates the<br>
importance of controlling bacteria and other microorganism populations on the<br>
skin or other substrates. It is important, that the antimicrobial compositions<br>
reduce microorganism populations rapidly, without irritating or damaging skin or<br>
having a detrimental toxicity. The prior art antimicrobial compositions generally<br>
contain a high percentage of alcohol, wherein the alcohol acts as a disinfectant<br>
which rapidly evaporates preventing the need to wipe or rinse the composition<br>
from the treated surface. However, it has been found that high amounts of alcohol<br>
generally greater than about 60% dry and/or irritate skin.<br>
[0005] U. S. Patent No. 5,288,486 relates to a process for enhancing the<br>
efficacy of alcohol-based skin antiseptics comprising adding at least one alcoholsoluble<br>
viscosifying agent to an alcohol-based disinfectant, thereby lowering its<br>
alcohol evaporation rate and markedly increasing the exposure time that<br>
disinfecting concentrations of alcohol are present on skin.<br>
[0006] U. S. Patent No. 5,635,462 relates to a reportedly cleansing<br>
composition including a substituted phenol such as para-chloro-meta-xylenol, and<br>
at least one primary surfactant selected from the group consisting of amine<br>
oxides, phospholipids, partially neutralized carboxylic acids and diacids, betaines,<br>
ethoxylated methyglucosides, and mixtures thereof. Other additives such as<br>
viscosifiers or thickeners, emollients, fragrances, perfumes, coloring agents, and<br>
the like may also be added.<br>
[0007] U. S. Patent No. 5,997,893 relates to reportedly antimicrobial<br>
compositions containing high levels of alcohol, carbomer polymers and<br>
antimicrobial agents which provide formulations possessing cosmetic<br>
characteristics.<br>
[0008] U. S. Patent No. 6,022,551 relates to reportedly antimicrobial alcoholcontaining<br>
composition and method of using the composition to reportedly<br>
disinfect surfaces, such as the hands is disclosed.<br>
[0009] U. S. Patent No. 6,136,771 relates to reportedly antibacterial<br>
compositions having a reduced amount of disinfecting alcohol. The antibacterial<br>
compositions contain a phenolic antibacterial agent, a disinfecting alcohol, a<br>
gelling agent, and water, wherein a percent saturation of the antibacterial agent in<br>
a continuous aqueous phase of the composition is at least 25%.<br>
 [0010] U. S. Patent No. 6,228,385 relates to a liquid reportedly antimicrobial,<br>
skin moisturizing formulation including: 1) an aqueous alcoholic base; 2) a<br>
humectant; 3) a delivery material adapted to release an emollient when the<br>
formulation is applied to the skin; and 4) an emollient immiscible in the aqueous<br>
alcoholic base and contained by the delivery material. The delivery material<br>
reportedly encapsulates or entraps the emollient for subsequent release.<br>
Desirably, the humectant is glycerin and the emollient is an alkyl-substituted<br>
polysiloxane polymer.<br>
[0011] U. S. Patent No. 6,423,329 relates to compositions and methods of<br>
sanitizing and moisturizing skin surfaces.<br>
[0012] U. S. Patent No. 6,723,689 relates to a reportedly antimicrobial<br>
composition comprising an alcohol in an amount from about 60 to about 95 weight<br>
percent of the total composition, a preservative, a cationic cellulose polymer<br>
thickening agent, a moisturizer and/or a cationic emulsifier, and water in an<br>
amount from about 6 to about 30. weight percent.<br>
[0013] A need exists for antimicrobial compositions which are effective against<br>
a broad spectrum of microorganisms including gram positive and gram negative<br>
bacteria and provide enhanced antimicrobial activity and thus provide a longer<br>
period of protection for the user.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] Antimicrobial compositions are disclosed which provide enhanced or<br>
prolonged activity against various microorganisms. The aliphatic alcohol<br>
concentration of the compositions is kept at a moderate level in order to prevent<br>
irritation to skin. It has been unexpectedly found that activity enhancing<br>
substances synergistically combine with the aliphatic alcohol in the compositions<br>
of the present invention to provide residual activity on a substrate and prevent<br>
subsequent microorganism growth when compared to alcohol alone. It is believed<br>
that the compositions retard evaporation of the alcohol and/or other antimicrobial<br>
agent if present, and increasing the contact time with the substrate i.e., skin being<br>
treated; or bind with the skin and remain on the surface thereby maintaining<br>
effectiveness against subsequent contact with a microorganism; or combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
[0015] The antimicrobial compositions comprise an aliphatic alcohol, preferably<br>
in an amount of about 50 to about 58 parts by weight, one or more activity<br>
enhancing substances in a range from about 0.0125 to about 10 parts by weight,<br>
and water based on 100 parts by weight of the antimicrobial composition. The<br>
compositions can optionally include other components including, but not limited to,<br>
humectants, skin conditioners, emollients, viscosifying agents, preservatives, and<br>
fragrances.<br>

[0017] FIG. 2 is a graph plotting residual activity of further compositions<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018] The present invention is directed to enhanced activity alcohol-based<br>
antimicrobial compositions which are preferably utilized as skin disinfectants or<br>
antiseptics which provide the skin or other surface with prolonged antimicrobial<br>
properties. Methods for preparing antimicrobial compositions are also described.<br>
[0019] Alcohol-containing or alcohol-based antimicrobial compositions are<br>
typically drying and even irritating to the skin, especially when utilized repeatedly<br>
as required in the healthcare field. While searching for components which could<br>
increase the moisturizing capabilities of an alcohol-based composition, it was<br>
unexpectedly discovered that compositions could be formulated comprising an<br>
aliphatic alcohol and an activity enhancing substance, which exceeded the activity<br>
of a composition without the latter component. In most cases, the moisturizing<br>
ability of the compositions are improved in addition to providing increased activity<br>
of the composition against microorganisms.<br>
 [0020] The compositions of the present invention include an aliphatic alcohol<br>
which has inherent antiseptic properties. Such alcohols are known to kill various<br>
viruses, fungi, mold, and gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Suitable<br>
alcohols are short chain, linear or branched, aliphatic alcohols, and generally have<br>
from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms with 1 to about 4 carbon atoms being preferred.<br>
Examples include, but are not limited to, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropyl<br>
alcohol, 2-methyl-2 propanol and hexanol, or combinations thereof. Propanol,<br>
isopropyl alcohol and ethanol are preferred.<br>
[0021] The aliphatic alcohol is present in a range generally from 30 parts to<br>
about 90 parts, desirably from about 45 parts to less than about 60 parts, and<br>
preferably from about 50 parts to about 57 or 58 parts by weight per 100 parts by<br>
weight of the composition. It has been unexpectedly found that compositions<br>
having less than 60 parts aliphatic alcohol can be effective antimicrobials having<br>
enhanced activity.<br>
[0022] The alcohol is combined with an activity enhancing substance which<br>
increases the residual activity of the composition and beneficially the effectiveness<br>
of the antibacterial activity as indicated by a log reduction in microorganisms.<br>
TypicaJ prior art antibacterial compositions generally offer a low to moderate<br>
antibacterial activity. Antibacterial activity is assessed against a broad spectrum<br>
of microorganisms, including both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Log<br>
reduction or alternatively percent reduction, in bacterial populations provided by<br>
the composition correlates to antibacterial activity. Log reductions on skin of<br>
between one and three are desired, and log reductions greater than three are<br>
preferred for a particular contact time which generally ranges from 15 seconds to<br>
about 5 minutes.<br>
[0023] The activity enhancing substance can generally be classified as one of<br>
two types, an aromatic alcohol activity enhancing substance, or a cationic<br>
substrate binding activity enhancing substance. One or preferably both types of<br>
activity enhancing substances are utilized in the compositions of the present<br>
invention. Suitable cationic substrate binding activity enhancing substances<br>
include, but are not limited to, behentrimonium methosulfate, behenalkonium<br>
chloride, behenoyl PG-trimonium chloride, behenoyl PG-dimonium chloride,<br>
behenamidopropyl PG-dimonium chloride, or combinations thereof. The cationic<br>
substrate binding activity enhancing substances are utilized in the antimicrobial<br>
compositions in amounts which range generally from about 0.0125 to about 0.50<br>
parts, desirably from about 0.03 to about 0.10 parts, and preferably from about<br>
0.04 to about 0.075 parts based on 100 parts by weight of the composition. Some<br>
of the substrate binding activity enhancing substances are commercially available<br>
as blends at various concentrations. Often, the substrate binding activity<br>
enhancing substances are blended with one or more long chain aliphatic alcohols<br>
having greater than about 10 carbon atoms such as, but not limited to, cetyl<br>
alcohol, stearyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol or cetearyl alcohol which is generally a<br>
50/50 mixture by weight of cetyl and stearyl alcohol.<br>
[0024] The aromatic alcohol activity enhancing substances include at least one<br>
phenyl group and an alcohol functional group indirectly attached to the phenyl<br>
ring, such as through aliphatic linkage or ether linkage, for example. Suitable<br>
aromatic alcohol activity enhancing substances include, but are not limited to,<br>
phenoxyethanol, 1- phenoxy 2-propanol, and benzyl alcohol. The aromatic<br>
alcohol activity enhancing substances are utilized in the antimicrobial<br>
compositions in amounts which range generally from about 0.5 to about 5.0,<br>
desirably from about 0.75 to about 3.5, and preferably from about 1.0 to about 2.5<br>
parts based on 100 parts by weight of the composition.<br>
[0025] Polyols are optionally but preferably utilized in the antimicrobial<br>
compositions of the present invention. Polyols contain from 2 to about 6 and<br>
desirably 2 or 3 hydroxyl groups. Preferred polyols are water soluble. The polyols<br>
utilized in the present invention are typically skin conditioners such as humectants<br>
or moisturizers. Specific examples of polyols include, but are not limited to,<br>
ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>
dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, hexylene glycol, butylene .glycol, 1,2,6-<br>
hexanetriol, sorbitol, PEG-4 and similar polyhydroxy compounds, and 2-methyl-<br>
1,3-propanediol.<br>
 [0026] In addition to the polyols, the antimicrobial compositions of the present<br>
invention can include other skin conditioners such as humectants, emollients,<br>
moisturizers or the like. Emollients are generally thin liquids, oils of various<br>
viscosities, fatty solids or waxes. A function of the skin conditioner is to soften<br>
and soothe the 'skin and to prevent chapping of the same. Preferably the skin<br>
conditioner chosen does not leave a tacky feel on the skin. Examples of such<br>
compounds include, but are not limited to, cyclomethicone, cetyl myristate,<br>
glyceryl dioleate, isopropyl myristate, lanolin, methyl laurate, PPG-9 laurate, soy<br>
stearyl, octyl palmitate, Di-PPG-3 myristyl ether adipate, C12-C15 alkyl<br>
benzoates, PPG-5 lanoate, glucamine and pyridoxine glycol, for example.<br>
Occlusive skin conditioners, for example, cetyl lactate, aluminum lanolate, corn oil,<br>
dimethicone, coconut oil, stearyl stearate, phenyl trimethicone, trimyristin, olive oil,<br>
and synthetic wax, also can be used. Combinations of the classes of skin<br>
conditioners, in addition to miscellaneous skin conditioners known to persons<br>
skilled in the art, alone or in combination can be used. Nonlimiting examples of<br>
miscellaneous skin conditioners include aloe, cholesterol, cystine, keratin, lecithin,<br>
egg yolk, glycine, PPG-12, retinol, salicylic acid, orotic acid, vegetable oil, and<br>
soluble animal collagen. The skin conditioners can be used alone, or in<br>
combination with a skin protectant, like petroleum, cocoa butter, calamine, and<br>
kaolin, for example.<br>
[0027] Still other skin conditioners include alcohol soluble polyquaterniums,<br>
including but not limited to, Merquat 100, which is N,N-dimethyl-N-2-propen-1-<br>
aminium chloride, polyquaternium 22 (acrylic acid-diallyldimethylammonium<br>
chloride polymer) and polyquaternium 47 (1-propanaminium,N,N,N-trimethyl-3-((2-<br>
methyl-1-oxo-2-propenyl)amino)-chloride polymer with methyl 2-propenoate and<br>
2-propenoic acid), all commercially available from ONDEO Nalco of Naperville,<br>
Illinois.<br>
[0028] One or more skin conditioners, emollients, humectants, or the like can<br>
be utilized in the antimicrobial compositions of the present invention in total<br>
amounts which range generally from about 0.25 to about 10 parts, desirably from<br>
about 0.50 to about 5.0 parts, and preferably from about 1.0 to about 3.5 parts<br>
based on 100 parts by weight of the composition.<br>
 [0029] Thickening agents are optionally but preferably utilized in the<br>
antimicrobial compositions of the present invention in order to increase the<br>
viscosity thereof. Thickening compounds can be both organic and inorganic. The<br>
antimicrobial compositions of the present invention can be a liquid but typically<br>
contain a sufficient amount of a thickening agent such that the composition is a<br>
viscous liquid or flowable gel that can be easily applied to a substrate such as<br>
skin. The type and amount of thickeners utilized in the composition depend upon<br>
the desired viscosity thereof among other factors. That said, a thickener, when<br>
utilized in the present invention, is present in a range generally from about 0.1 to<br>
about 3.0 parts, desirably from about 0.15 to about 1.0 part, and preferably from<br>
about 0.2 to about 0.75 parts based on 100 parts by weight of the composition.<br>
[0030] The compositions of the present invention have viscosities which range<br>
generally from about 10 to 100,000 centipoise(cp), desirably from about 30 to<br>
about 5,000 centipoise(cp), and preferably from about 60 to about 120 centipoise<br>
(cp) as measured using a low shear viscosity determination method such as the<br>
helipath method using an inverted "t" spindle as known in the art (Brookfield<br>
Method).<br>
[0031] Various thickeners can be utilized to thicken the aqueous and/or nonaqueous<br>
portion of the antimicrobial composition. Examples of suitable thickeners<br>
include, but are not limited to, acacia, acrylates/steareth-20 methacrylate<br>

isopropanol amine, diisopropanol amine, tromethamine, tetrahydroxy propyl<br>
ethylene diamine, isopropyl amine, diethanol amine, triethyanol amine, citric acid,<br>
glycolic acid, lactic acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, salicylic<br>
acid, and sulfuric acid.<br>
[0038] In some embodiments, additional antimicrobial compounds can be<br>
utilized in the compositions of the present invention. Suitable antimicrobials<br>
include, but are not limited to, benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride,<br>
CHG or phenols, optionally substituted, such as triclosan, some of which as noted<br>

antimicrobials other than the aliphatic alcohol and activity enhancing substances.<br>
[0039] The present invention will be better understood by reference to the<br>
following examples which serve to describe, but not to limit, the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
[0040] Various compounds were tested in the aliphatic alcohol-based<br>
formulation set forth in Table I to determine if moisturization could be improved. It<br>
was unexpectedly discovered during experimentation that one of the components<br>
utilized, behentrimonium methosulfate enhanced activity of the alcohol<br>
composition against Serratia Marcescens ATCC 14756. Following this<br>
unexpected discovery, various other compounds, including quaternary ammonium<br>
compounds, were tested in the formulation of Table I to determine if any<br>
enhanced activity could also be observed. Testing showed that very few<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds offered substantial enhanced activity, whereas<br>
a majority of quaternary ammonium compounds show little or even a negative<br>
effect on antimicrobial activity.<br>

 [0042] The following procedure was utilized to prepare the example<br>
formulations. The appropriate amount of water was heated to a temperature<br>
sufficient to dissolve any solid components, such as from about 70°C to about<br>
80°C for behentrimonium methosuifate. The solid components such as<br>
behentrimonium methyosuifate were added to the water with mixing utilizing an<br>
impeller mixer. The solution was subsequently cooled to a temperature of about<br>
60° wherein hydroxypropyl cellulose was added with mixing. The solution was<br>
-13-<br>
further cooled to allow the polymer to hydrate. The cetyl lactate, polyquaternium-<br>
6, glycerin, methylpropanediol, phenoxyethanol (in the case of experiment A) or<br>
other noted additive in Table II, and fragrance were added, preferably sequentially<br>
with mixing appropriate to disperse the materials. If necessary, additional water<br>
was added to replace water lost during processing as determined by appropriate<br>
vessel gross and net weights. Next, the appropriate aliphatic alcohol, such as<br>
isopropanol, was added with mixing to complete the composition. It is to be<br>
understood that variations of the above-described process can be utilized. For<br>
example, multi-tank processes can be utilized, and/or various types of dispersing<br>
equipment can replace the higher temperature dispersion of some components,<br>
etc.<br>
[0043] Residual Activity Testing Procedure: Each formulation was tested on<br>
pigskin to evaluate the effect of the compositions on a gram negative organism,<br>
Serratia marcescens ATCC 14756. The gram negative organism was grown for<br>
approximately 24 hours at 30°C and then suspended in Butterfields Buffer to a<br>
count of 1 X 10s. The pigskins were prepared according to the following standard<br>
of procedure. Pigskin hides are collected on the date of slaughter and processed<br>
on the same day by removing adipose tissue and thoroughly cleaning the hide.<br>
Both of these processes are accomplished by spraying both sides of the pig hide<br>
with a high pressure washer. No soap or detergents are used at any time during<br>
the processing of pig hides for laboratory use. After cleaning and de-fatting,<br>
pigskins are placed in water and frozen at the farm from which they were<br>
harvested. When required for laboratory testing, a representative procures the<br>
hides and thaws them for laboratory manipulation. In the laboratory, these hides<br>
are cut into manageable pieces with a scalpel and coarse hair removed with<br>
animal grooming clippers. Disposable razors are further employed to create a<br>
smooth surface without negatively affecting the skin surface. These pieces are<br>
then sterilized by Gamma irradiation and kept frozen until use in a study. Testing<br>
circles were then punched out of the pigskins and glued to a phenolic cap. The<br>
testing samples were placed in a 30°C oven to equilibrate for at least 20 minutes.<br>
Each skin was treated with 150^1 of test product and rubbed for 30 seconds as a<br>
pair, skin to skin. The skins were allowed to dry for 30 seconds and then the test<br>
product was reapplied four times in the same manner. The skins were allowed to<br>
dry in a slightly opened hood for 15 minutes. After drying the skins were<br>
inoculated with 31^1 of the Serratia marcescens inoculum, as prepared above,<br>
rubbed for 15 seconds, and sampled after three minutes. To sample, a sterile 3.5<br>
cm diameter cylinder is placed, lip side down, over the pigskin on the cap. Enough<br>
pressure is applied to the cylinder to prevent any leakage upon the addition of an<br>
appropriate volume of liquid sampling solution to the cylinder. The skin is then<br>
debrided, using a sterile policeman, for 30 seconds by rubbing the surface of the<br>
skin with the flat edge of the policeman with enough pressure to remove any<br>
microorganisms that might be on the surface. Two mL of the sampling solution<br>
are removed using a sterile pipet and are utilized for preparing serial dilutions and<br>
aerobic plate counts to establish the number of Colony Forming Units remaining.<br>
[0044] FIG. 1 illustrates in average log reduction residual activity results of the<br>
testing procedure described above. The quaternary ammonium compound<br>
behentrimonium methosulfate and phenoxyethanol exhibited enhanced<br>
antimicrobial activity when compared to the remaining components listed in Table<br>
[0045] FIG. 1 was derived from the following data which was gathered utilizing<br>
the above described residual activity testing procedure.<br>
 [0046] After it was unexpectedly discovered that the quaternary ammonium<br>
compound behentrimonium methosulfate provided increased antimicrobial activity<br>
in the base formulation, additional quaternary ammonium compounds were<br>
screened to determine their effectiveness, if any. The same formulation utilized in<br>
Table I was utilized as the base formulation for testing purposes. The various<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds listed in Table V were added to the base<br>
formulation at a rate of 0.5 parts by weight per 100 parts total composition. The<br>
base formulation and formulations including each quaternary ammonium<br>
compound were tested utilizing the residual activity test procedure described<br>
hereinabove. The results of the experiments are also listed in FIG. 2 and in Table<br>
V.<br>
