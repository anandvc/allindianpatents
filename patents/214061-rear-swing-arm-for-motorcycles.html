COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10 ; rule 13]]<br>
"REAR SWING ARM FOR MOTORCYCLES"<br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA,  a corporation of Japan,   1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
1 9 OCT 2007<br><br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a rear swing arm for motorcycles.<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
In motorcycles, the weight balance of the vehicle body frame in the fore-and-aft direction varies delicately with the size or the position of the engine to be mounted on the vehicle body frame, which exerts an influence on maneuverability and ride quality. Therefore, the front fork and the rear swing arm for suspending the rear and the front portion of the engine, and the vehicle body frame are very important elements which affect maneuverability and ride qulity .forexample, the rear swing arm is desired to have rathe,high-rigid properties in some cases, and to have flexing properties in other cases in order to take a balance with respect to the engine or the vehicle body frame.<br>
Rigidity is a deformation resistance for a load, and it generally means torsional rigidity_and bending rigidity.<br>
Torsional rigidity is defined by a product of a shearing elastic coefficient (G) and a geometrical polar moment of inertia (Ip) in the case of a straight rod having a uniform section, which is regarded as an index in maintaining basic<br><br><br>
rigidity of the rear swing arm. Bending rigidity is defined by a product of an elastic coefficient in the vertical direction (E) and a geometrical moment of inertia (I) in the case of a straight rod having a uniform section, which is regarded as an index in providing flexing properties in the rear swing arm. Since torsional rigidity correlates with bending rigidity, when torsional rigidity is increased, bending rigidity is also increased.<br>
As a rear swing arm for motorcycles having torsional rigidity and bending rigidity under consideration, for example, (1) Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.314683/1992 entitled "Swing arm for motorcycles", or (2) Japanese Utility Model Registration No.2536050 entitled "Reinforcement structure in hollow structure for vehicles" are known.<br>
The aforementioned invention (1) is, according to Fig. 1 of the same publication, a rear swing arm comprising an arm pipe 5 having a surface of recessed curve 11 extending rearwardly from the body 4 formed with a pivot hole 3 and a shaft hole 1.<br>
The utility model in (2) is, according to Fig. 1 of the same publication, a rear swing arm formed into the shape of an inverted letter V in side view.<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br><br>
Though the rear swing arm stated in (1) above is required to have flexing properties, it is apt to be insufficient in rigidity.<br>
Though the rear swing arm stated in (2) above is required to be rather hard with high rigidity, it is apt to be lack of flexing properties as a consequence of the fact that rigidity is required.<br>
Therefore, a technique to provide flexing properties in the rear swing arm while maintaining sufficient rigidity is desired.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a rear swing arm having flexing properties while maintaining sufficient rigidity therein.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned object, the invention according to Claim 1 provides a rear swing arm for motorcycles comprising a pivot shaft attaching portion for rotatably attaching the rear swing arm on the vehicle body frame via the pivot shaft, a suspension attaching portion rearwardly of the pivot shaft attaching portion, and a rear wheel supporting portion for supporting the rear wheel at the rear end of the arm portion extending rearwardly from the suspension attaching portion, wherein the section from the pivot shaft<br><br>
attaching portion to the suspension attaching portion is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and in bending rigidity in the vertical direction, and the arm portion is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction.<br>
The section from the pivot shaft attaching portion to the suspension attaching portion is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and bending rigidity in the vertical direction to provide sufficient rigidity in the rear swing arm. As a consequent, maneuverability can be improved.<br>
The arm portion is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction for example to provide sufficient rigidity in the rear swing arm and to alleviate consecutive and quickly repetitive impacts that can hardly be absorbed by the suspension. As a consequent, ride quality is improved.<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that the rear wheel supporting portion is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and bending rigidity in the vertical direction.<br>
The rear wheel supporting portion is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and bending rigidity in the vertical<br><br>
direction so that the rear wheel can be supported firmly. As a consequent, maneuverability can be improved.<br>
The invention according to Claim 3 is characterized in that the arm portion is formed to be downwardly convex in side view.<br>
[-0012]"<br>
The section between the pivot shaft attaching portion to the suspension attaching portion is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and bending rigidity in the vertical direction, and the arm portion is formed to be downwardly convex in side view, for example, so that the arm portion acts as a cantilevered curved beam with the section from the pivot shaft attaching portion to the suspension attaching portion fixed. Generally, the cantilevered curved beam formed to be downwardly convex is easily bent by a load applied from below, and cannot be bent easily by a load applied from above.<br>
In other words, since the main component of the vertical load applied to the rear swing arm by the rear wheel is a load from below, the arm portion is formed so as to be downwardly convex in side view, so that it can be made to be low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction while maintaining torsional rigidity high. As a consequent, the rear swing arm can be provided with sufficient rigidity, and consecutive and quickly repetitive impacts that can hardly be absorbed by the<br><br>
suspension are alleviated.<br>
The arm portion is formed so as to be. downwardly convex in side view, so that interference with other components of the vehicle body when being swung is avoided and the swing angle of the rear swing arm may be increased.<br>
[Description of the Embodiments]<br>
Referring now to the attached drawings, an embodiment of the invention will be described below. The drawings are to be viewed in the direction in which the reference numerals are oriented in a right way.<br><br>

[.0-0*51<br>
Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the vehicle body frame having a rear swing arm for motorcycles according to the present invention mounted thereon.<br>
The vehicle body frame 11 comprises a pair of main frames 41, 41 extended from the head pipe 12 toward the rear on the left side and the right side, the main frames 41, 41 having end portions 42, 42 extending downward, a down tube 43 being extended downward from the head pipe 12, a pair of parallel<br><br>
tubes 44, 44 being extended from the mid section of the down tube 43 toward the rear on the left and right sides, the end portions of the parallel tubes 44, 44 and the end portions 42, 42 of the main frames 41, 41 being connected respectively to form two connecting portions 46, 46, and a cross tube 47 laid between the connecting portions 46, 46.

The rear swing arm 50 comprises a pair of left and right projecting portions 52, 52 forwardly of the base portion 51, pivot shaft attaching portions 53, 53 formed at the ends of the projecting portions 52, 52, a cross member 54 connecting the portions in the vicinity of the pivot shaft attaching portions 53, 53 with each other, a pair of left and right arm portions 55, 55 extending rearwardly from the base portion 51, heavy-walled rear wheel supporting portions 56, 56 attached at the ends of the arm portions 55, 55, an reinforcing member 57 being integrally mounted on the upper surface of the base portion 51, and suspension attaching portions 58, 58formed downwardly of the base portion 51.<br><br>
Fig. 4 is a side view of the rear swing arm for motorcycles<br>
according to the present invention, showing that the arm portion 55 is formed of a pipe being square in cross section so as to be downwardly convex in side view, and is tapered from the base portion 51 toward the rear wheel supporting portions 56. As will be described later, since the main component of the vertical load applied to the rear swing arm 50 by the rear wheel 24 (See Fig. 1) is a load from below, the arm portion 55 is formed so as to be downwardly convex in side view, so that it can be made to be low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction while maintaining torsional rigidity high. The arm portion 55 is formed into a tapered shape by forming the radius of curvature on the lower surface R2 smaller than the radius of curvature on the upper surface Rl.<br>
A rear swing arm for motorcycle 50 comprises pivot shaft attaching portions 53, 53 (53 on the far side is not shown) for rotatably attaching the rear swing arm on the vehicle body frame 11 (See Fig. 2) via the pivot shaft 33, suspension attaching portions 58, 58 (58 on the far side is not shown) rearwardly of the pivot shaft attaching portions 53, 53, rear wheel supporting portions 56, 56 (56 on the far side is not shown) for supporting the rear wheel 24 (See Fig. 1) at the rear end of the arm portions 55, 55 (55 on the far side is not<br><br>
shown) extending rearwardly from the suspension attaching portions 58, 58, wherein the portions in the vicinity of the pivot shaft attaching portions 53, 53 are connected with each other by a cross member 54, and a reinforcing member 57 is integrally mounted on the base portion 51, so that the section from the pivot shaft attaching portions 53 to the suspension attaching portion 58 is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and in bending rigidity in the vertical direction, and the arm portion 55 is formed of as pipe being square in cross section so as to be downwardly convex in side view, so that the arm portion 55 is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction.<br>
The section from the pivot shaft attaching portion 53 to the suspension attaching portion 58 is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and bending rigidity in the vertical direction to provide sufficient rigidity in the rear swing arm 50. As a consequent, maneuverability can be improved.<br>
The arm portion 55 is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction for example to provide sufficient rigidity in the rear swing arm 50 and to alleviate consecutive and quickly repetitive impacts that can hardly be absorbed by the suspension 28. As a consequent, ride quality is improved. In other words, a rear swing arm 5 0 having flexing properties while maintaining<br><br>
sufficient rigidity therein is realized.<br>
In order to construct the arm portion 55 to be high in torsional rigidity and low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction, the arm portion 55 is formed so as to be downwardly convex in side view. As will be described later, the rear swing arm 50 having the section from the pivot shaft attaching portion 53 to the suspension attaching portion 58 being high in torsional rigidity and bending rigidity in the vertical direction, and the arm portion 55 being downwardly convex in side view can act as a cantilevered curved beam with the section from the pivot shaft attaching portion 53 to the suspension attaching portion 58 fixed. Generally, the cantilevered curved beam formed to be downwardly convex is easily bent by a load applied from below, and cannot be bent easily by a load applied from above.<br><br>
Since the main component of the vertical load applied to the rear swing arm 50 by the rear wheel 24 (See Fig. 1) is a load from below, the arm portion 55 is formed so as to be downwardly convex in side view, so that it can be made to be low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction while maintaining torsional rigidity high. As a consequent, the rear swing arm 50 can be provided with sufficient rigidity, and consecutive and quickly repetitive impacts that can hardly<br><br>
be absorbed by the suspension 28 (See Fig. 1) are alleviated.<br>
In other words, the rear swing arm 50 comprises a heavy-walled rear wheel supporting portions 56 attached at the end of the arm portions 55 respectively, so that the rear wheel supporting portions 56 are constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and bending rigidity in the vertical direction.<br>
The rear wheel supporting portion 56 is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and bending rigidity in the vertical direction so that the rear wheel can be supported firmly. As a consequent, maneuverability can be improved.<br>
The operation of the rear swing arm 5 0 described above will now be described.<br>
Fig. 5 (a), (b) are comparative explanatory drawings of the rear swing arm for motorcycles according to the present invention, in which (a) shows a rear swing arm 100 of the comparative example, and (b) shows a rear swing arm 50 of the embodiment.<br>
Generally, since torsional rigidity correlates with bending rigidity, when torsional rigidity is increased, bending rigidity is also increased. Torsional rigidity is inevitable for stability of the vehicle body, and when torsional rigidity of the rear swing arm is improved, bending<br><br>
rigidity is also improved accordingly. However, when the rear swing arm (especially bending rigidity of the arm portion in the vertical direction) is high in rigidity, in the region where the rear swing arm moves faster (that is, on the repetitively bumpy road), followability of the rear swing arm may become duller under the influence of the damper of the suspension. Consequently, ride quality and maneuverability may be deteriorated.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable if only torsional rigidity can be improved while maintaining bending rigidity in the vertical direction as before.<br>
In (a), the rear swing arm 100 of the comparative example is a rear swing arm of a generic shape comprising a pair of left and right projections 102, 102 formed forwardly from the basic portion 101, pivot shaft attaching portions 103, 103 formed at the ends of the projections 102, 102, a pair of arms 105, 105 extending rearwardly from the base portion 101 on the left and right sides, and heavy-walled rear wheel supporting portions 106, 106 formed at the ends of the arm portions 105, 105.<br><br>
In (b), the rear swing arm 50 in the embodiment is an improved rear swing arm comprising a cross member 54 connecting the portions of the rear swing arm 100 shown in (a) in the<br><br>
vicinity of these pivot shaft attaching portions 53, 53 with each other, arm portions 55, 55 formed to be downwardly convex, rear wheel supporting portions 56, 56 formed to have heavy wall, and a reinforcing member 57 mounted integrally on the upper surface of the base portion 51, wherein only torsional rigidity is improved while maintaining bending rigidity in the vertical direction almost at the same value as that of the rear swing arm 100 in the comparative example.<br>
As will be described in conjunction with the next drawing, it is a rear swing arm that ensures a sufficient swing angle for the rear swing arm 50.<br>
Figs. 6(a) to (c) show the first explanatory drawings of the operation of the rear swing arm for motorcycles according to the present invention, in which (a) shows a rear swing arm 110 of the comparative example 1, (b) shows a rear swing arm 120 of the comparative example 2, and (c) shows a rear swing arm 50 of the embodiment.<br>
In (a), the rear swing arm 110 is a rear swing arm having an arm portion 115 formed to be straight in side view.<br>
In (b), the rear swing arm 12 0 is a rear swing arm having an arm portion 125 formed to be upwardly convex in side view, supposing that the member on the side of the vehicle body is positioned at the height H from the horizontal level passing<br><br>
through the center of the pivot shaft attaching portion 123, and a swing angle of the rear swing arm 120 when swung as indicated by the arrow b is 62.<br>
In (c), the rear swing arm 50 is a rear swing arm having an arm portion 55 formed to be downwardly convex in side view, supposing that the member on the side of the vehicle body is positioned at the same height H as (b) from the horizontal level passing through the center of the pivot shaft attaching portion 53, and the swing angle of the rear swing arm 50 when swung as indicated by the arrow b is 9.<br>
In (b) and (c), it is clear that the relation between the possible swing angle 62 of the rear swing arm 120 and the swing angle 6 of the swing arm 50 is 6&gt;62, and since the arm portion 55 of the rear swing arm 50 is formed to be downwardly convex in side view, interference with other components of the vehicle body when being swung is avoided and the swing angle of the rear swing arm 50 may be increased. In other words, the rear swing arm 50 is a suitable swing arm for the off road motorcycle in which the swing angle is set to a large value. Consequently, the possibility of design of the motorcycle 10 (See Fig. 1) may be expanded.<br>
It is assumed that the cross sections taken at the same<br><br>
distance from the respective base portions 111, 121, 51 are the same, and that there is no influence of the working on the arm portions 115, 125, 55, such as, work hardening, heat deformation, or the like.<br>
In (a) to (c), the rear swing arms 110, 120 include components equivalent to the reinforcing member 57 integrally mounted on the base portions 111, 121 respectively, and components equivalent to the cross member 54 laid at the pivot shaft attaching portions 113, 123, and components equivalent to the heavy walled rear wheel supporting portion 56 attached at the ends of the arm portions 115, 125.<br>
[003-2-T<br>
Since consideration is made in the region in which the followability of the rear swing arms 110, 120, 50 becomes dull due to the influence of the damper of the suspension, the rear swing arms 110, 120, 50 can be regarded approximately as cantilevers when a prescribed load W is applied on the ends of the arm portions 115, 125, 55 from below with the base portions 111, 121, 51 fixed shown in (a) to (c). A deformation resistance (bending rigidity in the vertical direction) of the rear swing arms 110, 120, 50 will be considered in conjunction with the next drawing.<br>
The sign L designates a distance from the pivot A to the position B on which a prescribed load W is applied in the case where the arm portions 115, 125, 55 are regarded as cantilevers.<br><br>
Figs. 7 (a) to (c) are second explanatory drawings showing the operation of the rear swing arms for motorcycles according to the present invention, in which (a) shows the rear swing arm 100 of the comparative example 1, (b) shows the rear swing arm 120 of the comparative example 2, and (c) shows the rear swing arm 50 of the embodiment.<br>
In (a), when the arm portion 115 is a generic simple beam (straight beam) and a prescribe load W is applied from below,<br>
an amount of deformation 61 is generated. For example, when a prescribed load W is applied from above, the same amount of<br>
deformation 81 is generated.<br>
In (b), when the arm portion 115 is an upward convex curved beam, an amount of deformation 52 generated by the prescribed load W applied from below is smaller than the amount of deformation 51 shown in (a).<br>
In (c), when the arm portion 55 is a downward convex curved<br>
beam, an amount of deformation 52 generated by the prescribed load w is larger than the amount of deformation 81 shown in (a).  In other words, the relation among the amounts of<br>
deformation shown in (a) to (c) is 52
In other words, as is described above, since bending rigidity is a deformation resistance, the smaller the amount of deformation, the smaller deformation resistance will be.<br><br>
A load applied to the rear swing arm is a load from below applied when the rear wheel comes into contact with the ground, and thus a load from above is unconcerned in this case.<br>
Therefore, as shown in (c), by forming the arm 55 to be a downwardly convex curved beam to provide directionality to bending rigidity in the vertical direction, bending rigidity with respect to a load from below can be reduced with torsional rigidity of the arm 55 increased. As a consequent, a rear swing arm 50 having flexing properties while maintaining sufficient rigidity therein is realized.<br>
[££3-5-]<br>
In the embodiment, as shown in Fig. 4, the arm portion is formed into a tapered shape by forming the radius of curvature on the lower surface R2 smaller than the radius of curvature on the upper surface Rl, but it is not limited thereto. When making the curvature on the lower surface coordinate with the curvature on the upper surface, it is also possible to form it into a tapered shape by shifting the center of the curvature on the lower surface with respect to the center of the curvature on the upper surface.<br>
In the embodiment, as shown in Fig. 4, the cross member 54, the reinforcing member 58, and the heavy-walled rear wheel supporting portions 56, 56 are employed to improve torsional rigidity, but means for improving torsional rigidity is not limited thereto. The combination of the cross member 54, the<br><br>
reinforcing member 58, and the heavy-walled rear wheel supporting portions 56, 56 is arbitrary, and it may be improved by increasing wall thickness of the rear swing arm, by changing material of the rear swing arm or the like.<br>
[Advantages]<br>
The present invention constructed as described above provides the following advantages.<br>
According to Claim 1, since the section from the pivot shaft attaching portion to the suspension attaching portion is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and bending rigidity in the vertical direction, the rear swing arm is provided with sufficient rigidity. As a result, maneuverability can be improved.<br>
In addition, since the arm portion is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction, for example, the rear swing arm is provided with sufficient rigidity, and consecutive and quickly repetitive impacts that can hardly be absorbed by the suspension is alleviated. As a consequent, ride quality can be improved. In other words, a rear swing arm having flexing properties while maintaining sufficient rigidity is realized.<br>
According to Claim 2, since the rear wheel supporting portion is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and<br><br>
bending rigidity in the vertical direction, the rear wheel can be supported firmly. As a consequent, maneuverability can be improved.<br>
According to Claim 3, since the arm portion is formed to be downwardly convex in side view, for example, the arm portion can act as a cantilevered curved beam with the section from the pivot shaft attaching portion to the suspension attaching portion fixed. Generally, the cantilevered curved beam formed to be downwardly convex is easily bent by a load applied from below, and cannot be bent easily by a load applied from above.<br>
In other words, since the main component of the vertical load applied to the rear swing arm by the rear wheel is a load from below, the arm portion is formed so as to be downwardly convex in side view, so that it can be made to be low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction while maintaining torsional rigidity high. As a consequent, the rear swing arm can be provided with sufficient rigidity, and consecutive and quickly repetitive impacts that can hardly be absorbed by the suspension are alleviated.<br>
Since the arm portion is formed so as to be downwardly convex in side view, for example, interference with other components of the vehicle body when being swung is avoided and the swing angle of the rear swing arm may be increased. As<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A rear swing arm (50) for motorcycles (10) comprising:<br>
a pivot shaft (33) attaching portion for rotatably attaching the rear swing arm (50) on the vehicle body frame (11) via the pivot shaft (33);<br>
a suspension attaching portion (58) rearwardly of the pivot shaft (33) attaching portion; and<br>
a rear wheel supporting portion (56) for supporting the rear wheel at the rear end of the arm portion (55) extending rearwardly from the suspension attaching portion (58),<br>
wherein the section from the pivot shaft (33) attaching portion to the suspension attaching portion (58) is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and in bending rigidity in the vertical direction, and the arm portion (55) is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and low in bending rigidity in the vertical direction.<br>
2.	A rear swing arm (50) for motorcycles (10) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the rear wheel supporting portion (56) is constructed to be high in torsional rigidity and bending rigidity in the vertical direction.<br>
3.	A rear swing arm (50) for motorcycles (10) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the arm portion (55) is formed to be downwardly convex in side view.<br>
4.	A rear swing arm (50) for motorcycles (10) substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
