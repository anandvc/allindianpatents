DESCRIPTION<br>
ELECTRONIC APPARATUS, CONTROL METHOD AND PROGRAM THEREOF, AND BATTERY FOR OPERATING ELECTRONIC<br>
APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an electronic apparatus capable of using a fuel cell as a power source, and its control method and program, and more particularly to an electronic apparatus mounting a fuel cell which recovers a power generation efficiency through purge, and its control method and program.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Presently, there are many apparatus which can operate by a power supply from a battery. Among these apparatus, an apparatus capable of being used outdoors has a big issue of a battery life of power supply.<br>
In the following, description will be made by referring to a digital camera as one example of electronic apparatus capable of being used outdoors.<br>
In a generally known digital camera, an object image taken through a photographing is photoelectrically converted by an image pickup device<br><br>
into an image signal, the image signal is A/D converted and recorded on a recording medium, and an image can be displayed on a built-in liquid crystal monitor.<br>
Particularly, a single-lens reflex digital camera capable of exchanging a photographing is required to have a high quality of a photographed image, a wide luminance range of an object capable of being photographed and the like, while a good manipulation performance and a high speed continuous photographing performance are also maintained similar to a silver salt film camera.  It is therefore essential that a high sensitivity image pickup device which has a large number of pixels is adopted.  In addition, as compared to a silver salt film camera, large scale electronic.circuits using a number of electric components are additionally used, including an image pickup circuit, an image processing circuit, an image display circuit and the like.  Therefore, a consumption power becomes large and it is required to have a battery capable of supplying a sufficient energy. While compactness and lightness of cameras advance, conventional primary and secondary batteries are becoming difficult to supply cameras with a sufficient drive energy.<br>
In order to solve these problems, a compact fuel cell has been paid attention.  In a fuel cell, fuel<br><br>
gas such as hydrogen as a reaction gas is electrochemically reacted with oxidant gas such as oxygen contained in an atmospheric air, to thereby convert chemical energy contained in the fuel, directly into electric energy.<br>
Next, description will be made on a power generation principle of a fuel cell.  In a fuel cell, fuel gas containing hydrogen is supplied to a fuel electrode and oxidant gas containing oxygen is supplied to an oxygen electrode to thereby obtain an electromotive force through electrochemical reactions occurring between both the electrodes.  Hydrogen supplied to the fuel electrode is separated by catalyst into protons and electrons. The separated electrons move to the oxygen electrode via an outer circuit, whereas the protons move to the oxygen electrode via a solid state polymer film. At the oxygen electrode, protons, electrons and oxygen are coupled to generate water and carbon dioxide.  In the following, the electrochemical reactions in the fuel cell are shown. A formula (1) indicates a reaction at the fuel electrode, a formula (2) indicates a reaction at the oxygen electrode, and a formula (3) indicates a reaction in the whole battery.<br><br><br>
Fuel batteries are classified into various types depending upon an electrolyte difference and the like One know type is a fuel cell which uses a solid state polymer film as electrolyte. A solid state polymer electrolyte type fuel cell can realize low cost, is easy to make compact and light, and has a high output density in view of a battery performance.  From these reasons, the fuel cell of this type is desired to be a drive electric power source not only for cameras, but also for portable electronic apparatus such as note type personal computers, mobile phones and PDAs. A stack cell type fuel cell has also been proposed, having a structure that a plurality of power generation cells and separators are alternately laminated.<br>
Fig. 11 is a diagram showing a change in an output voltage of a fuel cell in use.  Fig. 12 is a diagram showing a change in an output voltage of a fuel cell in use under purge. As a power is generated by a fuel cell for a long period of time, an output voltage lowers.  This is because water generated by a reaction between hydrogen and oxygen diffuses in a reverse direction to the fuel electrode and reduces a power generation area, and in addition, gas unnecessary for power generation remains at the fuel electrode and lowers a hydrogen partial pressure. Since a fuel cell is used as a current supply source<br><br>
of an electronic apparatus, it is not preferable that an output voltage lowers to an allowable voltage range of the electronic apparatus or more.<br>
In order to solve this, generally a flow rate of hydrogen to be supplied to the fuel electrode is increased instantly to discharge moisture and gas which are unnecessary for power generation and remain at the fuel electrode, to an external of stack cells, so that a power generation area is recovered and a hydrogen partial pressure is raised to thereby stabilize an output voltage (a purge method) . After purge, an output voltage of the fuel cell rises as shown in Fig. 12.<br>
Several techniques have been disclosed as methods of judging the timing when a fuel cell is purged. According to one method, voltages of all stack cells constituting a fuel cell are detected, and when any one layer of cells presents a predetermined voltage or lower, purge is effected (for example, refer to JP-A-2002-093438)   There are a method of forcibly effecting purge each time a predetermined time lapses (for example, refer to JP-A-2000-215905) and a method of performing both periodical purge and hydrogen purge upon voltage measurement of each cell (for example, refer to JP-A-2003-115314). Other methods include a method (for example, refer to JP-A-2002-164065) of measuring<br><br>
voltage and current output from a fuel cell for a predetermined period or by a predetermined number of samples, calculating an internal resistance from the measured value, comparing the internal resistance with a preset standard value, and estimating the state of electrolyte of the fuel cell to effect purge when necessary.<br>
However, although purge is effected to recover the power generation area, raise the hydrogen partial pressure and stabilize the output voltage, an output voltage of the fuel cell lowers momentarily during purge because of air mixture to the fuel electrode by reverse diffusion, drop of hydrogen pressure and temperature in the fuel electrode. A portable electronic apparatus such as a digital camera is required to have a severe precision of management of a power source system.  For example, if the timing when the fuel cell is purged is superposed upon the timing when the electronic apparatus requires a relatively large power, the power necessary for the electronic apparatus cannot be drawn from the fuel cell, and there arises a problem of an insufficient power of the electronic apparatus.<br>
If an electronic apparatus is remained unused for a long term, fuel gas leaks minutely from the fuel electrode of a fuel cell, so that a hydrogen concentration on the fuel electrode side falls.  When<br><br>
the fuel cell is thereafter activated, there arises a problem that it takes a long time to raise the output voltage to a necessary voltage.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

Reference numeral 90 denotes a fuel cell system control circuit for controlling the compressor 82 and the like to obtain a target electric power amount, in accordance with an input pressure and flow rate of the fuel gas (hydrogen) and an input pressure and flow rate of the oxidant gas (air). An output of the cell voltage detection circuit 8 9 is sent to the system control circuit 50 of the electronic camera main body 100, and when a purge instruction is received from the system control circuit 50, purge is effected by driving the purge valve 83 as purge control means.<br>
Next, description will be made on the control operation for the fuel cell 80 of the single-lens reflex digital camera shown in Figs. lA, IB and 2.<br>
Fig. 3 is a flow chart illustrating the control operation for the fuel cell 80 of the single-lens reflex digital camera shown in Figs. lA, IB and 2. As shown in Fig. 3, first, while the electronic camera main body 100 is driven by using the fuel cell 80 as electric power supply means, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 makes the cell voltage detection<br><br>
circuit 89 measure a cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81, and it is judged whether the cell voltage is lower than a first predetermined value necessary for purge (Step SlOl) .<br>
If it is judged that the cell voltage is higher than the first predetermined value (NO at Step SlOl), the flow returns to Step 101 whereat the fuel cell system control circuit 90 makes the cell voltage detection circuit 89 measures a cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81.  Step SlOl is repeated until the cell' voltage becomes lower than the first predetermined value.<br>
If it is judged that the cell voltage is lower than the first predetermined value (YES at Step SlOl), the fuel cell system control circuit 90 notifies the system control circuit 50 of that the cell voltage became lower than the first predetermined value and purge is necessary (Step S102) .  The system control circuit 50 judges from a detection result of the drive electric power detection circuit 76 whether a drive electric power of the electronic camera main body 100 is lower than a predetermined value (Step S103). This predetermined-value is set to a level at which the operation of the electronic camera main body 100 is not influenced even if a voltage drop occurs during purge.<br>
The predetermined value at Step S103 will be<br><br>
described with reference to Fig. 4.  Fig, 4 is a diagram showing an example of a consumption power amount during a drive sequence of the single-lens reflex digital camera. As shown in Fig. 4,   while the electric power switch 72 of the single-lens reflex digital camera is turned on, the consumption power of the camera circuit is always about 6.0 to 7.0 W. Depending upon the timing of the camera drive sequence, a power of about 1.5 W is consumed by a motor (not shown) for driving the shutter 12, mirrors 122 and 124, and a power of about 4.0 W is consumed for driving the iris 312 .<br>
For example, if purge is effected while a consumption power is relatively large (in Fig. 4, smaller than about 12.0 W) such as driving the motor (not shown) and iris 312 at the same time, a necessary electric power cannot be obtained because of an instantaneous voltage drop, and there is a possibility that driving the single-lens reflex digital camera is influenced.  In order to avoid this, it is sufficient if purge is effected while the electric power is consumed only by the camera circuit Step S103 shown in Fig. 3 judges whether the electric power consumed by the single-lens reflex digital camera is relatively small at the present time.  In the example shown in Fig. 4, the predetermined value at Step 3103 shown in Fig. 4 is most preferably about<br><br>
7.0 W indicated by a dotted line in Fig. 4.<br>
If the drive electric power detection circuit 76 judges that the drive electric power is smaller than the predetermined value (YES at Step S103), the system control circuit 50 outputs a purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90. The fuel cell system control circuit 90 drives the purge valve 83 to effect purge, and discharges excessive moisture and impurities in the fuel cell stack to the external of the electronic camera main body 100 via the exhaust port 96 (Step S104).<br>
If the drive electric power detection circuit 76 judges that the drive electric power is larger than the predetermined value (NO at Step S103), the system control circuit 50 outputs a purge standby signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90,  The fuel cell system control circuit 90 makes the cell voltage detection circuit 89 measure again the cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81 to judge whether the cell voltage is lower than a second predetermined value. The second predetermined value is lower than the first predetermined value, and is set to a value near to an inhibition voltage (a voltage at which the single-lens reflex digital camera cannot operate correctly) of the electronic camera main body 100.<br>
If it is judged that the cell voltage is higher than the second predetermined value (NO at Step S105),<br><br>
the fuel cell system control circuit 90 outputs a judgment result to the system control circuit 50 to return to Step S103 whereat the system control circuit 50 makes the drive electric power detection circuit 76 measure again the drive electric power of the electronic camera main body 100. Namely, a loop of Step SI03 and S105 is executed if the detection result by the drive electric power detection circuit 76 is larger than the predetermined value and the cell voltage is higher than the second predetermined value.<br>
If it is judged that the cell voltage is lower than the second predetermined value (YES at Step S105)r   the fuel cell system control circuit 90 outputs a judgment result to the system control circuit 50 to advance to Step S106 whereat the system control circuit 50 controls the electric power source change-over unit 97 to change the electric power source of the electronic camera main body 100 from the fuel cell 8 0 to the electric power source unit 116.<br>
Next, the system control circuit 50 outputs a purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90. The fuel cell system control circuit 90 drives the purge valve 83 to effect purge, and discharges excessive moisture and impurities in the fuel cell stack to the external of the electronic<br><br>
camera main body 100 via the exhaust port 96. During purge, in order to maintain the hydrogen pressure in the fuel cell stack 81 at a predetermined value, hydrogen is always exhausted from the hydrogen absorbing alloy 410 in the fuel tank 400 and sent to the fuel cell 80 via the connectors 93 and 412 (Step S107).<br>
After purge, the system control circuit 50 controls the electric power source change-over unit 97 to change the electric power source of the electronic camera main body 100 from the electric power source unit 116 to the fuel cell 80 (Step S108)<br>
A series of control operations of the fuel cell 80 has been described above.  The processes shown in Fig. 3 are repeated while the single-lens reflex digital camera uses the fuel cell 80 as its electric power source.<br>
As described above, according to the single-lens reflex digital camera of this embodiment, purge can be effected in the sequence of the single-lens reflex digital camera, if a necessary power is small.  It is therefore possible to prevent battery shortage of the single-lens reflex digital camera to be caused by a voltage drop during purge.  It is therefore possible to drive the single-lens reflex digital camera by the fuel cell 80, by repeating purge without influencing the operation of the single-lens reflex digital<br><br>
camera.<br>
Further, in the sequence of the single-lens reflex digital camera, the electric power source unit 116 is temporality used in place of the fuel cell 80 and purge is completed during this period, if a necessary electric power is large and if purge is required immediately in the state that driving the single-lens reflex digital camera is influenced if purge is effected. Accordingly, the fuel cell 80 can be purged without influencing the operation of the single-lens reflex digital camera, and driving the single-lens reflex digital camera can continue by using the fuel cell 80 as the main electric power source.<br>
Next, with reference to the accompanying drawings, description will be made on examples of the control operation for the fuel cell 80 in various use states (first to six use states) of the single-lens reflex digital camera of this embodiment. First Use State<br>
The electric power switch 72 of the single-lens reflex digital camera is turned on in the first use state that the fuel gas of the fuel electrode in the fuel cell 80 was reduced because the single-lens reflex digital camera was maintained unused for a long time and the fuel cell 8 0 was not driven.  Fig. 5 is a flow chart illustrating an example of the<br><br>
control operation for the fuel cell 80 of the single-lens reflex digital camera in the first use state.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, first the system control circuit 50 judges whether the electric power switch 72 of the electronic camera main body 100 is turned on (Step S201) .  If it is judged that the electric power switch 72 is off (NO at Step S201), the system control circuit 50 repeats the judgment process at Step S2 01 until the electric power switch 72 is turned on.<br>
In the state that the electric power switch 72 is OFF, an electric power is not supplied to the single-lens reflex digital camera, so that the judgment process is not performed.  When the electric power switch 72 changes from the OFF state to an ON state, an electric power is supplied to the system control circuit 50 to judge the state of the electric power switch. However, depending upon the control of the electric power source, a power saving mode such as a suspend (sleeve) state is executed.  In this case, the state of the electric power switch 72 is judged as the OFF state.  In this power saving mode, the judgment process (Step S201) can be executed at a predetermined time interval.  In this power saving mode, the ON state occurs upon a predetermined operation, e.g., in response to a photographing instruction. At this timing, the ON state of the<br><br>
electric power switch 72 may be judged.<br>
If it is judged that the electric power switch 72 is turned on (YES at Step S201), the system control circuit 50 starts driving the fuel cell 80 (Step S202).<br>
As the fuel cell 80 starts being driven at Step S202, the system control circuit 50 outputs a purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90.  The fuel cell system control circuit 90 drives the purge valve 83 to effect purge, and discharges excessive moisture and impurities in the fuel cell stack 81 to the external of the electronic camera main body 100 via the exhaust port 96-<br>
During purge, in order to maintain the hydrogen pressure in the fuel cell stack 81 at a predetermined value, hydrogen is always exhausted from the hydrogen absorbing alloy 410 in the fuel tank 400 and sent to the fuel cell 80 via the connectors 93 and 412 (Step S203) . At the same time, the system control circuit 50 starts an electric power supply from the fuel cell 80 to the electronic camera main body 100 to activate the camera (Step S204) .<br>
Whether the system control circuit 50 outputs the purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90 at Step S202, may be determined in the following manner. As described with Steps SlOl and S102 in Fig. 3, the cell voltage detection<br><br>
circuit 89 measures the cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81, and in accordance with this measurement, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 notifies the system control circuit of that purge is necessary.<br>
As described above, according to the single-lens reflex digital camera of this embodiment, even if the fuel gas of the fuel electrode in the fuel cell 80 is reduced because the single-lens reflex digital camera is maintained unused for a long time, purge is effected when the electric power switch 72 of the single-lens reflex digital camera is turned on.  It is therefore possible to fill the fuel electrode of the fuel cell 80 with fuel gas and improve a rise of the output voltage.  If purge is effected only when necessary, wasteful purge can be avoided in the case in which the electric power switch is turned on and off in a short time. Second Use State<br>
The fuel tank 400 (fuel gas supply means) of the single-lens reflex digital camera is loaded in the second use state that the fuel gas of the fuel electrode of the fuel cell 80 was reduced because the fuel tank 400 was not loaded.  Fig. 6 is a flow chart illustrating an example of the control operation for the fuel cell 80 of the single-lens reflex digital camera in the second use state.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, even if the fuel tank 400 is<br><br>
not loaded in the electronic camera main body 100, the system control circuit operates by the electric power supplied from the electric power source unit 116.  The system control circuit 50 controls the fuel tank attach and detach detection unit 74 to judge whether the fuel tank 400 is attached to the connector 93 (Step S301).<br>
If the fuel tank 400 is not mounted on the connector 93 (NO at Step S301), the fuel tank attach and detach detection unit 74 repeats this judgment until the fuel tank 400 is mounted on the connector 93.<br>
If it is judged that the fuel tank 4 00 is mounted on the connector 93 (YES at Step S301), the fuel tank attach and detach detection unit 74 outputs a signal to the system control circuit 50, the signal being denotative of that the fuel tank 4 00 is loaded. The system control circuit 50 instructs the electric power source change-over unit 97 to change the electric power source from the electric power source unit 116 to the fuel cell 80 (Step S302) .<br>
Next, the system control circuit 50 outputs a purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90. The fuel cell system control circuit 90 drives the purge valve 83 to effect purge, and discharges excessive moisture and impurities in the fuel cell stack 81 to the external of the electronic<br><br>
camera main body 100 via the exhaust port 96. During purge, in order to maintain the hydrogen pressure in the fuel cell stack 81 at a predetermined value, hydrogen is always exhausted from the hydrogen absorbing alloy 410 in the fuel tank 400 and sent to the fuel cell 8 0 via the connectors 93 and 412 (Step S303)•<br>
Although the change-over of the electric power source is executed at Step 3302 shown in Fig. 6, the change-over may be executed after purge is effected (Step S303) and an output of the fuel cell 80 is stabilized. Whether the system control circuit 50 outputs the purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90 at Step S303, may be determined based on the following fact. As described with Steps SlOl and S102 in Fig. 3, the cell voltage detection circuit 89 measures the cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81, and in accordance with this measurement, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 notifies the system control circuit of that purge is necessary, or not.<br>
As described above, according to the single-lens reflex digital camera of this embodiment, even if the fuel gas of the fuel electrode in the fuel cell 80 is reduced because the fuel tank 4 00 is not loaded in the single-lens reflex digital camera, purge is effected when the fuel tank 400 is loaded.  It is<br><br>
therefore possible to fill the fuel electrode of the fuel cell 80 with fuel gas and improve a rise of the output voltage.  If purge is effected only when necessary, wasteful purge can be avoided in the case in which the fuel tank 400 is exchanged instantly. Third Use State<br>
An auto power-off is effected in the third use state that the fuel gas of the fuel electrode in the fuel cell 80 was reduced because the single-lens reflex digital camera was maintained unused for a long time and the fuel cell 80 was not driven.  Fig. 7 is a flow chart illustrating an example of the control operation for the fuel cell 80 of the single-lens reflex digital camera in the third use state.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1,   first the system control circuit 50 judges whether the electric power switch 72 of the electronic camera main body 100 is turned<br>
KJTI     \ o L-cp   o,wj.;.        1J_     uHt::;    CLCWUJ-X',    ,uwer    awl uCn     i c    J-a<br>
turned on (YES at Step S401), the system control circuit 50 starts driving the fuel cell 8 0 to activate the single-lens reflex digital camera (Step S402) .  If the electric power switch 72 is in an OFF state (NO at Step S401), the system control circuit 50 repeats the judgment process until the electric power switch 72 is turned on.<br>
In the state that the electric power switch 72 is OFF, an electric power is not supplied to the<br><br>
single-lens reflex digital camera, so that the judgment process is not performed. When the electric power switch 72 changes from the OFF state to an ON state, an electric power is supplied to the system control circuit 50 to judge the state of the electric power switch. However, depending upon the control of the electric power source, a power saving mode such as a suspend (sleeve) state is executed.  In this case, the state of the electric power switch 72 is judged as the OFF state.  In this power saving mode, the judgment process (Step S401) can be executed at a predetermined time interval.  In this power saving mode, the ON state occurs upon a predetermined operation, e.g., in response to a photographing instruction. At this timing, the ON state of the electric power switch 72 may be judged.<br>
Next, after the single-lens reflex digital camera is activated, the system control circuit 50 controls the timing generator circuit 18 to measure the time from when various switches of the operation unit 70 and the like are lastly operated to the present time, to thereby judge whether the unoperated state (hereinafter called a camera unoperated state) of the single-lens reflex digital camera reaches a predetermined time (Step S403) .<br>
If it is judged at Step S403 that the camera unoperated time does not reach the predetermined time<br><br>
(NO at Step S403), the system control circuit 50 repetitively measures the time from when various switches of the operation unit 70 and the like are lastly operated to the present time, until it is judged that the camera unoperated state is longer than the predetermined time.  The single-lens reflex digital camera of this embodiment has an auto power-off function of stopping an electric power supply to the electronic camera main body 100 when the camera unoperated state continues longer than the predetermined time.<br>
If it is judged at Step S403 that the camera unoperated state reaches the predetermined time (YES at Step S403), the system control circuit 50 outputs a purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90.  The fuel cell system control circuit 90 drives the purge valve 83 to effect purge, and discharges excessive moisture and impurities in the fuel cell stack 81 to the external of the electronic camera main body 100 via the exhaust port 96.  During purge, in order to maintain the hydrogen pressure in the fuel cell stack 81 at a predetermined value, hydrogen is always exhausted from the hydrogen . absorbing alloy 410 in the fuel tank 4 00 and sent to the fuel cell 80 via the connectors 93 and 412 (Step S404). After purge, the system control circuit 50 stops driving the fuel cell 80 and stops an electric<br><br>
power supply to the electronic camera main body 100.<br>
If the single-lens reflex digital camera has the power saving mode, the power saving mode state may occur after the lapse of the predetermined time.  In this case, purge is effected in the power saving mode. Whether the system control circuit 50 outputs the purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90 in YES at Step S403, may be determined based on the following fact. As described with Steps Si01 and SI02 in Fig. 3, the cell voltage detection circuit 89 measures the cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81, and in accordance with this measurement, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 notifies the system control circuit of that purge is necessary, or not.<br>
As described above, according to the single-lens reflex digital camera of this embodiment, even if the fuel gas of the fuel electrode in the fuel cell 80 is reduced because the single-lens reflex digital camera is maintained unused for a long time, purge is effected before auto power-off.  It is therefore possible to fill the fuel electrode with fuel gas.  It is possible to improve a rise of the output voltage of the fuel cell 8 0 when the electronic camera main body 100 is activated next. Fourth Use State<br>
The single-lens reflex digital camera is<br><br>
activated again in the forth use state that the fuel gas of the fuel electrode in the fuel cell 80 was reduced because the single-lens reflex digital camera was maintained unused for a long time and the fuel cell 80 was not driven, and in the auto power-off state. Fig. 8 is a flow chart illustrating an example of the control operation for the fuel cell 80 of the single-lens reflex digital camera in the fourth use state.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, first the system control circuit 50 judges whether the electric power switch 72 is turned on (Step S501). If it is judged that the electric power switch 72 is turned on (YES at Step S501), the system control circuit 50 starts driving the fuel cell 80 to activate the single-lens reflex digital camera (Step S502) .  If it is judged that the electric power switch 72 is in an OFF state (NO at Step S501), the system control circuit 50 repeats the judgment process until the electric power switch 72 is turned on.  In the state that the electric power switch 72 is OFF, an electric power is not supplied to the single-lens reflex digital camera, so that the judgment process is not performed. When the electric power switch 72 changes from the OFF state to an ON state, an electric power is supplied to the system control circuit 50 to judge the state of the electric power switch.<br><br>
Next, after the single-lens reflex digital camera is activated, the system control circuit 50 controls the timing generator circuit 18 to measure the time from when various switches of the operation unit 70 and the like are lastly operated to the present time, to thereby judge whether the camera unoperated state reaches a predetermined time (Step S503).<br>
If it is judged at Step S503 that the camera unoperated time does not reach the predetermined time (NO at Step S503), the system control circuit 50 repetitively measures the time from when various switches of the operation unit 70 and the like are lastly operated to the present time, until it is judged that the camera unoperated state is longer than the predetermined time.<br>
If it is judged at Step S503 that the camera unoperated state reaches the predetermined time (YES at Step 3503), the system control circuit 50 stops a main electric power supply for driving the electronic camera main body 100 (Step S504).  In this case, even if the main electric power supply for driving the electronic camera main body 100 is stopped, an electric power supply to the system control circuit 50 continues, for example, from the electric power supply unit 116.  Next, the system control circuit 50 judges whether various operation switches of the<br><br>
operation unit 70 and the like are operated (whether the camera unoperated state terminates) (Step S505) .<br>
If it is judged that the camera unoperated state continues (NO at Step S505)r   the judgment process is repeated until various operation switches of the operation unit 70 and the like are operated again.  If it is judged at Step S505 that the operation of various operation switches of the operation unit 7 0 and the like is detected (YES at Step S505), the system control circuit 50 controls the electric power source control circuit 98 to stop driving the fuel cell 80, and controls the electric power source change-over unit 97 to change the electric power source of the electronic camera main body 100 from the fuel cell 8 0 to the power source unit 116 and start a power supply to the electronic camera main body 100 (Step S506).<br>
Next/ the system control circuit 50 outputs a purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90. The fuel cell system control circuit 90 drives the purge valve 83 to effect purge, and discharges excessive moisture and impurities in the fuel cell stack 81 to the external of the electronic camera main body 100 via the exhaust port 96.  During purge, in order to maintain the hydrogen pressure in the fuel cell stack 81 at a predetermined value, hydrogen is always exhausted from the hydrogen<br><br>
absorbing alloy 410 in the fuel tank 400 and sent to the fuel cell 8 0 via the connectors 93 and 412 (Step S507). After purge, the system control circuit 50 controls the electric power source change-over unit 97 to change the electric power source of the electronic camera main body 100 from the electric power source unit 116 to the fuel cell 80 (Step S508)<br>
In the sequence from Step 8506 to 8507, whether the system control circuit 50 outputs the purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90, may be determined based on the following fact. As described with Steps 8101 and 8102 in Fig. 3, the cell voltage detection circuit 89 measures the cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81, and in accordance with this measurement, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 notifies the system control circuit of that purge is necessary, or not.<br>
As described above, according to the single-lens reflex digital camera of this embodiment, purge of the fuel cell 80 can be effected when the single-lens reflex digital camera is activated again in the state that the fuel gas of the fuel electrode in the fuel cell 80 was reduced because the single-lens reflex digital camera was maintained unused for a long time and the fuel cell 80 was not driven, and in the auto power-off state.  Since the fuel electrode, of the fuel cell 80 is filled with fuel gas, it is possible to<br><br>
improve a rise of the output voltage of the fuel cell 80 when the electronic camera main body is reactivated.  Since the electric power source unit 116 is used in place of the'fuel cell 80 during purge, driving the electronic camera main body can be continued without influencing the operation thereof even if the output voltage of the fuel cell 80 lowers during purge. Fifth Use State<br>
Purge is effected in the fifth use state when a user of the single-lens reflex digital camera turns on the purge operation switch 78.  Fig. 9 is a flow chart illustrating an example of the control operation for the fuel cell 80 of the single-lens reflex digital camera in the fifth use state.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, first the system control circuit 50 judges whether the electric power switch 72 is turned on (Step S601).  If it is judged that the electric power switch 72 is turned on (YES at Step S601),   the system control circuit 50 starts driving the fuel cell 8 0 to activate the single-lens reflex digital camera (Step S602).  If it is judged that the electric power switch 72 is in an OFF state (NO at Step S601), the system control circuit 50 repeats the judgment process until the electric power switch 72 is turned on.  In the state that the electric power switch 72 is OFF, an electric power is not supplied<br><br>
to the single-lens reflex digital camera, so that the judgment process is not performed. When the electric power switch 72 changes from the OFF state to an ON state, an electric power is supplied to the system control circuit 50 to judge the state of the electric power switch.<br>
After the single-lens reflex digital camera is activated at Step S602, the system control circuit 50 controls the timing generator circuit 18 to measure the time from when the single-lens reflex digital camera is activated to the present time, to thereby judge whether a predetermined time reaches (Step S603) .  If it is judged at Step S603 that the time from when the single-lens reflex digital camera is activated to the present time does not reach the predetermined time (NO at Step 8603), the system control circuit 50 repetitively measures the time from when the single-lens reflex digital camera is activated to the present time, until the time exceeds the predetermined time.<br>
If it is judged at Step S603 that the time from when the single-lens reflex digital camera is activated to the present time, reaches the predetermined time (YES at Step S603), the system control circuit 50 controls the purge alarm unit 55 to issue an alarm to a user of the single-lens reflex digital camera and make the user turn on the purge<br><br>
operation switch 78.<br>
Next, the system control circuit 50 judges whether the user turns on the purge operation switch 78 (Step S605).  If it is judged that the purge operation switch 78 is not turned on (NO at Step S605) ; the system control circuit 50 instructs the purge alarm unit 55 to continuously issue the alarm, and repetitively judges whether the purge operation switch 78 is turned on.<br>
If it is judged at Step S605 that the user turns on the purge operation switch 7 8 in response to the alarm from the purge alarm unit 55 (YES at Step S605), the system control circuit 50 controls the electric power source change-over unit 97 to change the electric power source of the electronic camera main body 100 from the fuel cell 80 to the power source unit 116.<br>
Next, the system control circuit 50 outputs a purge start signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90.  The fuel cell system control circuit 90 drives the purge valve 83 to effect purge, and discharges excessive moisture and impurities in the fuel cell stack 81 to the external of the electronic camera main body 100 via the exhaust port 96.  During purge, in order to maintain the hydrogen pressure in the fuel cell stack 81 at a predetermined value, hydrogen is always exhausted from the hydrogen<br><br>
absorbing alloy 410 in the fuel tank 4 00 and sent to the fuel cell 80 via the connectors 93 and 412 (Step S607).<br>
After purge, the system control circuit 50 controls the electric power source change-over unit 97 to change the electric power source of the electronic camera main body 100 from the electric power source unit 116 to the fuel cell 80 (Step S608)<br>
Next, the system control circuit 50 controls the timing generator circuit 18 to measure the time from a purge completion to the present time and judge whether the time reaches a predetermined time (Step S609).<br>
If it is judged at Step S609 that the time from the purge completion to the present time does not reach the predetermined time (NO at Step S609), the system control circuit 50 repetitively measures the time from the purge completion to the present time, until the time excesses the predetermined time.  If it is judged at Step S609 that the time from the purge completion to the present time reaches the predetermined time (YES at Step S609), the flow returns to Step S604.<br>
When an alarm is issued at Step S604, whether the alarm is to be issued may be judged in the following manner.  The cell voltage detection circuit 89 measures the cell voltage of the fuel cell stack<br><br>
81, and in accordance with the measurement result, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 notifies the system control circuit of a necessity of purge. Namely, when it is judged that purge is not necessary, the alarm may not be issued.<br>
As described above, according to the single-lens reflex digital camera of this embodiment, purge is effected when a user of the single-lens reflex digital camera turns on the purge operation switch 7 8. It is therefore possible to continuously use the single-lens reflex digital camera, without being bothered with a voltage drop during purge or impact by purge (depending upon the position of a hand or a face of the user, there is a possibility that the user receives impact such as being surprised by discharge from the exhaust port 96 during purge) .<br>
A timing when purge is necessary is judged from a continuous drive time of the single-lens reflex digital camera.  It is therefore possible to notify a user of the single-lens reflex digital camera of a timing when the purge operation switch 78 is depressed. Since the electric power source unit is used in place of the fuel cell 80 during purge, shortage of the fuel cell of the single-lens reflex digital camera to be caused by a voltage drop during purge can be prevented, and driving the electronic camera main body can be continued without influencing<br><br>
the operation thereof.<br>
Another Operation in Fifth Use State<br>
Description will be made on an example of the operation different from the operation shown in Fig. 9 in the fifth use state.<br>
Fig. 10 is a flow chart illustrating another example of the control operation for the fuel cell 8 0 of the single-lens reflex digital camera in the fifth use state.  The processes at Steps S701 and S7 02 and the processes at Steps S704 to S707 shown in Fig. 10 are similar to the processes at Steps S601 and S602 and the processes at Steps S604 to S607 shown in Fig. 9,   and the description thereof is omitted.<br>
After the single-lens reflex digital camera is activated at Step S702, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 makes the cell voltage detection circuit 89 measure the cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81 to thereby judge whether the cell voltage is lower than a predetermined value (whether purge is necessary) (Step S703).<br>
If it is judged that the cell voltage is higher than the predetermined value (NO at Step S703),   the cell voltage detection circuit 89 measures again the cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81, and the process at Step S703 is repeated until the cell voltage becomes lower than the predetermined value. If it is judged that the cell voltage is lower than<br><br>
the predetermined value (YES at Step S703), the fuel cell system control circuit 90 notifies the system control circuit 50 of a necessity of purge. The system control circuit 50 controls the purge alarm unit 55 to issue an alarm to a user to make the user turn on the purge operation switch 78 (Step S704).<br>
After purge is completed at Step S707, the system control circuit 50 controls the electric power source change-over circuit 97 to change the electric power source of the electronic camera main body 100 from the electric power source unit 116 to the fuel cell 80 (Step S708) to thereafter return to Step S703.<br>
As described above, according to the single-lens reflex digital camera of this embodiment, purge is effected when a user of the single-lens reflex digital camera turns on the purge operation switch 78, and the single-lens reflex digital camera can be continuously used without being bothered with a voltage drop during purge or impact to be caused by purge.<br>
Further, a timing when a purge operation switch is depressed can be notified to a user of the single-lens reflex digital camera, by judging from- the output voltage of the fuel cell 80 the timing when purge becomes necessary and issuing an alarm when purge becomes necessary.  Furthermore, since the electric power source unit 116 is used in place of<br><br>
the fuel cell 80 during purge, shortage of the fuel cell of the single-lens reflex digital camera to be caused by a voltage drop during purge can be prevented, and driving the electronic camera main body by the fuel cell 80 can be continued without influencing the operation thereof.<br>
In the above-described embodiments, the fuel cell 80 is loaded in the electronic camera main body 100 and the fuel tank 400 is detachably loaded in the electronic camera main body 100.  This is an example of preferred embodiments of the present invention, and the present invention is not limited thereto.  For example, the fuel cell 80 together with the fuel tank 400 may be mounted in the external of the electronic camera main body 100, and connected to the electronic camera main body 100 via the connectors 93 and 412. In this case, electric power source lines for supplying an electric power source voltage are provided, and signal lines for transferring signals between the system control circuit 50 and fuel cell system control circuit 90 are provided.<br>
As described so far, according to the single-lens reflex digital camera of the embodiments, purge is effected in accordance with the camera state.  It is therefore possible to effect purge of the fuel cell 80 at the timing not influencing the camera operation, and driving the fuel cell 80 can be<br><br>
continued. According to the single-lens reflex digital camera of the embodiments, since purge is effected in the camera operation sequence at the timing when a consumption power is small, battery shortage or the like of the single-lens reflex digital camera to be caused by a voltage drop during purge can be presented.<br>
Further, according to the single-lens reflex digital camera of the embodiments, even in the state that the fuel gas of the fuel electrode in the fuel cell 80 was reduced because the single-lens reflex digital camera was maintained unused for a long time and the fuel cell 80 was not driven, since purge is effected when the electric power switch 72 of the single-lens reflex digital camera is turned on, and then the fuel electrode of the fuel cell 80 is filled with fuel gas, it is possible to improve a rise of the output voltage.<br>

Next, the electric power source unit 600 will be described.  The electric power source unit 600 is<br><br>
constituted of an electric power source 602 and a connector 604.  The electric power source 602 is constituted of a primary battery such as an alkali battery and a lithium battery, a secondary battery such as a,NiCd battery, an NiMH battery and a Li battery, and an AC adapter. The connector 604 interconnects the electric power source unit 600 and cellar phone main body 500.<br>
Next, the fuel cell unit 700 will be described. The fuel cell unit 700 is constituted of a fuel cell unit 80, a fuel remaining amount detection unit 702, a fuel tank attach and detach detection unit 704, connectors 706 and 708, a gas inlet port 710 and a gas outlet port 712.  In the cellar phone of the embodiment, the fuel cell unit 700 is detachably mounted on the cellar phone main body 500, and the fuel tank 400 is detachably mounted on the fuel cell unit 700.<br>
The fuel remaining amount detection unit 7 02 detects a fuel remaining amount in the fuel tank 4 00 connected to the fuel cell unit 700 via the connectors 706 and 412, i.e., detects a hydrogen remaining amount in the hydrogen absorbing alloys 410<br>
A fuel tank attach and detach detection unit 704 detects whether the fuel tank 400 is mounted on the connector 708 .<br>
The connector 7046 interconnects the cellar<br><br>
phone main body 500 and fuel cell unit 700, and the connector 7 08 interconnects the fuel cell unit 700 and fuel tank 400.  The gas inlet port 710 is used for supplying air to an oxygen electrode (not shown) of the fuel cell 80.  The gas outlet port 712 is used for exhausting hydrogen, impurities and air used by the fuel cell 80 during purge of the fuel cell 80 to an external of the cellar phone main body 500.<br>
Next, description will be made on a purge control operation of the cellar phone shown in Figs. 13A and 13B.<br>
-Fig. 14 is a flow chart illustrating a purge control operation of the cellar phone shown in Figs. 13A and 13B.  First, while the cellar phone main body 500 is driven by using the fuel cell 80 as an electric power source unit, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 makes the cell voltage detection circuit 89 measure a cell voltages of a fuel cell stack 81, and judges whether the cell voltage is lower than a first predetermined value at which purge is required (Step S801) .<br>
If it is judged that the cell voltage is higher than the first predetermined value (No at Step S801), the fuel cell system control circuit 90 returns to Step S801 to make the cell voltage detection circuit 8 9 measure a cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81 and repeat Step S8 01 until the cell voltage becomes<br><br>
lower than the first predetermined value.<br>
If it is judged that the cell voltage is lower than the first predetermined value (YES at Step S801), the fuel cell system control circuit 90 controls the fuel remaining amount detection unit 702 to detect a hydrogen remaining amount in the hydrogen absorbing alloys 410 and judge whether a sufficient amount of hydrogen for abrupt hydrogen emission by purge remains in the hydrogen absorbing alloys 410 (Step S802).<br>
If the hydrogen remaining amount in the hydrogen absorbing alloys 410 is insufficient for purge (NO at Step S802), the flow advances to Step S804. The operation at Step S804 and following Steps will be described later with reference to Fig. 15.<br>
If a hydrogen remaining amount in the hydrogen absorbing alloys 410 is insufficient for purge (YES at Step S802), the fuel cell system control circuit 90 transmits a purge permission signal to the cellar phone system control circuit 510 via the connectors 548 and 704 (Step S803).<br>
Next, the cellar phone system control circuit 510 judges whether impurity exhaust by purge of the fuel cell unit 700 does not influence use of the cellar phone main body 500 (Step S805) .  For example, if the cellar phone main body 500 is photographing with the image pickup element 552 and purge is<br><br>
performed, there arises a possibility of hand shaking to be caused by vibrations during impurity exhaust. If the cellar phone main body 500 is picking up external sounds and voices from the microphone 534, there is a possibility that sounds during impurity exhaust by purge are picked up by to the microphone.<br>
If it is judged at Step S805 that the operation state of the cellar phone main body 500 is not influenced by purge of the fuel cell unit 700 (YES at Step S805), the cellar phone system control circuit 510 controls the drive electric power detection unit 530 to judge whether a drive electric power of the cellar phone main body 500 has a level not influenced by a temporary voltage drop by purge (Step S806) .<br>
If it is judged at Step S805 that the operation state of the cellar phone main body 500 is influenced by purge of the fuel cell unit 700 (NO at Step S805), the fuel cell system control circuit 90 makes the cell voltage detection circuit 89 measure a cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81, and judges whether a cell voltage is lower than a second predetermined value necessary for driving the cellar phone main body 500 (Step S807).  If the cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81 is higher than the second predetermined value (NO at Step S807), the flow returns to Step S805.<br>
If the cell voltage of the fuel cell stack 81 is<br><br>
lower than the second predetermined value capable of driving the cellar phone main body 500 (YES at Step S807), the cellar phone system control circuit 510 controls the electric power change-over unit 542 to change the electric power source of the cellar phone main body 500 from the fuel cell unit 700 to the electric power source unit 600, to thereby supply an electric power to each component of the cellar phone main body 500 from the electric power source 602 via the connectors 546 and 604 (Step S808).<br>
Next, the cellar phone system control circuit 510 judges whether impurity exhaust by purge of the fuel cell unit 700 does not influence use of the cellar phone main body 500 (Step S809) .<br>
If it is judged at Step S809 that impurity exhaust by purge of the fuel cell unit 700 does not influence use of the cellar phone main body 500 (YES at Step S809), the flow advances to Step S813.<br>
If it is judged at Step S809 that impurity exhaust by purge of the fuel cell unit 700 influences use of the cellar phone main body 500 (NO at Step S809),   judgment is repeated until the operation state of the cellar phone main body 500 enters the state wherein purge can be performed.<br>
If it is judged at Step S806 that a drive electric power of the cellar phone main body 500 has a level not influenced by a temporary voltage drop by<br><br>
purge (YES at Step S806),   the cellar phone system control circuit 510 transmits a purge permission signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90 via the connectors 548 and 704 (Step S810).<br>
Upon reception of the purge permission signal from the cellar phone system control circuit 510, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 controls a purge valve 83 to exhaust excessive water and impurities in the fuel cell stack to the external of the fuel cell unit 700 via the gas outlet port 710 (Step S811) .<br>
If it is judged at Step S806 that a drive electric power of the cellar phone main body 500 has a level influenced by a voltage drop by purge (NO at Step S806), the cellar phone system control circuit 510 controls the electric power change-over unit 542 to change over the electric power source of the cellar phone main body 500 from the fuel cell unit 700 to the electric power source unit 600 to supply an electric power to each component of the cellar phone main body 500 from the electric power source 602 via the connectors 546 and 604 (Step S812) .<br>
Next, the cellar phone system control circuit 510 transmits a purge permission signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90 via the connectors 548 and 706 (Step S813) .  The fuel cell system control circuit 90 received the purge permission signal drives the purge valve 80 to effect purge and exhaust<br><br>
excessive water and impurities in the fuel cell stack to the external of the fuel cell unit 700 via the gas outlet port 710 (Step S814).<br>
After the purge is completed, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 transmits a purge completion notice signal to the cellar phone system control circuit 510 via the connectors 54 8 and 7 06 (Step S815) .<br>
Upon reception of the purge completion notice signal from the fuel cell system control circuit 90, the cellar phone system control circuit 510 controls the electric power change-over unit 542 to change over the electric power source of the cellar phone main body 500 from the electric power source unit 600 to the fuel cell unit 700 (Step S816).<br>
Fig. 15 is a flow chart illustrating the operation to be executed if it is judged at Step 8802 shown in Fig, 14 that a sufficient amount of hydrogen for abrupt hydrogen emission by purge does not exist in the hydrogen absorbing alloys 410 in the fuel tank 400.<br>
At Step S802 shown in Fig. 14, the fuel cell system control circuit 90 controls the fuel remaining amount detection unit 702 to detect a hydrogen remaining amount in the hydrogen absorbing alloys 410 and judge whether a sufficient amount of hydrogen for abrupt hydrogen emission by purge exists in the<br><br>
hydrogen absorbing alloys 410 in the fuel tank 400. If the hydrogen remaining amount in the hydrogen absorbing alloys 410 is insufficient for hydrogen emission by purge (NO at Step S802), the fuel cell system control circuit 90 transmits an electric power change-over request signal to the cellar phone system control circuit 510 via the connectors 548 and 706 to change over the electric power source of the cellar phone main body 500 from the fuel cell unit 700 to the electric power source unit 600 (Step S901).<br>
Upon reception of the electric power change-over signal from the fuel cell system control circuit 90, the cellar phone system control circuit 510 controls the electric power source change-over unit 542 to change over the electric power source of the cellar phone main body 500 from the fuel cell unit 700 to the electric power source unit 600 and supply an electric power to each component of the cellar phone main body 500 from the electric power source 602 via the connectors 546 and 604 (Step S902) ,<br>
Next, the cellar phone system control circuit 510 controls the fuel run-out warning unit 540 to warn the cellar phone user about the fact that hydrogen sufficient for driving the cellar phone does not exist in the hydrogen absorbing alloys 410 of the fuel tank 400 (Step S903) .<br>
As described, above, according to the cellar<br><br>
phone of the embodiment, when an output voltage of the fuel cell unit 700 lowers and it becomes necessary to perform purge, a purge permission signal is transmitted to the cellar phone system control circuit 510, When purge is completed, a purge completion notice signal is transmitted.  If the hydrogen remaining amount in the hydrogen absorbing alloys 410 is smaller than an amount necessary for purge, an electric power source change-over request signal is transmitted.  In this manner, the cellar phone system control circuit 510 can grasp the operation state of the fuel cell unit 700,<br>
Upon reception of the purge permission signal request signal from the fuel cell unit 700, the cellar phone system control circuit 510 transmits the purge permission signal to the fuel cell system control circuit 90 in accordance with the drive state of the cellar phone main body 500. Accordingly, the cellar phone can be used continuously, without being bothered about purge impacts (there is a possibility that a user receives impacts such as gas exhaust from the gas outlet port 710 by purge).<br>
Further, if the cellar phone main body 500 cannot bear a temporary voltage drop by purge, a supply electric power source of the cellar phone main body 500 is changed over from the fuel cell unit 700 to the electric power source unit 600.  It is<br><br>
therefore possible to prevent a battery run-out of the cellar phone main body 500 to be caused by a voltage drop during purge, and to continue driving by the fuel cell unit 700 without influencing the operation of the cellar phone.<br>
