Heddle with a widened strip width in the area of the end eyes<br>
The present invention relates to a heddle made of a stxip-shaped material and a process for manufacturing a heddle. The invention relates particularly to the shaping and manufacturing of the so-called end eyes. Thereby is meant the two openings at the end of the heddles, which make it possible to line up the heddles and hang them in heddle frames.<br>
Such heddles have been used for a long time in many weaving mills and it is not surprising that a certain limit in efficiency has been reached. Since the cross-sectional dimensions of the metal strip used in the manufacturing of the heddle have essentially not been changed, the cost for polishing is low by using a suitable strip. In addition, unhardened steel strip material has been used in most cases. Both of these factors are responsible for a low-cost but also a not very efficient heddle. Even with the great advancements in the weaving technology, such heddles are still used even in very modern facilities because the mechanical life-span of the heddles is more or less the same as the limited useful life of the thread eyelet. The thread eyelet may be damaged by modem synthetic fibers very  quickly to a degree that weaving is made impossible. Even more expensive materials like hardened steel do not produce in most cases better conditions in proportion to the higher expenses. Thus there is great interest in the textile industry for a more efficient design of the traditional type of heddle.<br>
Such heddleSj as they are currently used in great numbers, are described in detail in US 748 713. The therein described end eyes are manufactured whereby an elongated rectangular opening is punched out in the strip. Subsequently the narrow sides of the opening are squeeze-pressed, which has the result that the longitudinal sides are deformed and the opening is enlarged.  One disadvantage are the wedge-shaped pressed areas at the narrow sides (of the opening). These make contact with the heddle slide bar that runs through the openings whereby these two areas axe damaged very quickly, which makes the heddle unserviceable,<br><br>
A solution for this problem has been known for quite some time. As the German patent PS 1805 25 discloses, the same inventor proposed to deform at first the area of the end eye by squeeze-pressing it into the desired width and then punch out the weakened sections. On one hand it is apparent that a substantially strengthened end eye is produced by removal of the thin pressed sections. On the other hand it is also clear that the proposed solution may be realized with only a very soft original material. This in turn cancels a part of the desired advances.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a heddle which end-eye type corresponds to the idea of the German patent PS 180525, but which is made of a material that is substantially stronger and which thereby meets the requirements found in a modern weaving mill<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention by means of a heddle in compliance with the text specifically in claim 1 or by means of a procedure for the production of a heddle outlined specifically in claim 9.<br>
IS<br>
e<br>
The proposed heddle is unique according to the invention in that not only the immediate area of the future opening for the end eye is widened by squeeze-pressing before the creation of the end eye but that at least in the area of one end eye of the two eyes there an additional squeeze-pressed section at a distance apart from tins end, Preferably tlie; is an additional pressed section in the area of each of the two ends of both eyes.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the heddle according to the invention are characteri2ed in claims 1 through 8,<br>
In the production of the heddle according to the invention, there is provided at first a squeeze-pressed section oriented in a longitudinal direction in the area of the future end eye, respectively, and preferably in the middle of the strip that is used for the production of the heddle whereby the heddle stip is widened in the area of the future end eye, and wherein the end eye will be subsequently punched out.<br><br>
One additional squeeze-pressed section is preferably produced simultaneously at a distance apart together with one adjoining to the end section during manufacturing of the longitudinal oriented pressed section , whereby preferably more pressed sections are created adjoining and at a distance apart from each of the two ends of the longitudinal oriented pressed sections. Thus it is proposed to provide preferably three pressed sections each in the area of the future end eye. In case where three squeeze-pressed sections are produced simultaneously, each end eye is created subsequently by being punched out in the area of the middle longitudinal oriented pressed section.<br>
Preferred procedures for manufacturing the novel heddle are characterized in claims 9 through 14.<br>
Between the three pressed sections there remain two narrow "ridges" that are not deformed. The additional two other pressed sections or auxiliary pressed sections have the purpose to extend the area from the widest section of the deformed end eye to the non-deformed strip and thereby keep the developing stress in the material low, Additionally, the two auxiliary pressed sections axe shaped in such a manner that the ridges axe slightly pushed up so that their thickness,  even with the widening of the strip in this area, corresponds approximately with the thickness of the remaining strip. Subsequently the deformed part in the middle pressed section is removed by being punched out. This punching extends to the area of the sliglitly pushed-up ridges, thus a large bearing surface for the heddle slide bar is obtained. This relatively large bearing surface prevents premature material wear. In addition to the possibility of using strip material with increased stability, a heddle is produced that meets stress requirements found in modem weaving mills.<br>
The invention is now explained in more detail, for example, with reference to the accompanying drawings;<br>
Fig. 1 shows a heddle according to the invention in a perspective longitudinal view.<br><br>
Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view through the end eye taken along the axis A-A of Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a cross-sectional view through the end eye of Fig, 3 after the end eye opening has been punched out.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the completed punched-out end eye in a top view.<br>
Fig, 1 shows a perspective view of a heddle 1 according to the invention, as it is lined up on the heddle slide bars 4 and 4' together with one tliread eyelet 2 and two end eyes 3 and 3'. A warp thread 5 is guided through the thread eyelet 2,<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows now an end eye of the heddle 1 according to the invention, after squeee-pressing and prior to the end eye being punched out to create the end eye 3 as shown in Fig. 1, for example. In the area where the end eye is to be punched out tliere is a middle pressed section 6 provided and there are in the area of both ends of said middle pressed section adjoining and at a distance apart the auxiliary pressed sections 7 and 7' to form the two ridges 8 and 8*^ which ai'e not squeeze-pressed but slightly pushed up-<br>
As it can be clearly seen in Fig. 2, the strip material of the heddle 1 is widened by the middle pressed section 6 in the area of the future end eye opening. Even with the widening tliere is achieved by squeeze-pressing that the two leg areas oriented along the side of the middle pressed section 6 maintain an unreduced thickness relative to the thickness of the strip material of the heddle.<br>
Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view through the end eye taken along the axis A-A of Fig. 2. Clearly visible axe the squeeze-pressed sections 6 indented at both sides for the creation of future end eye openings as well as the auxiliary pressed sections 7 and 7',  which are also indented on both sides. In addition, it can also be seen that the auxiliary pressed<br><br>
I<br>
sections 7 and 7" are shaped in such a manner that the in the longitudinal direction displaced material of the ridge 8 and 8' are slightly pushed up relative to the non-deformed strip material.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a cross-sectional view through the end eye of Fig. 3, after the area of the end eye opening 9 has been punched out. It can be seen that the auxiliary pressed sections 7 and 7' are not punched out and that the ridges 8 and 8'  serve as a good bearing for the heddle slide bar since their thickness remains the same as the thickness of the non-deformed strip material. Respectively, it is even possible TO slightly increase (by pushing up) the thickness of the ridges 8 and 8' relative to the thickness of the non-deformed strip material.<br>
Fig. 5 fmally shows in a top view the completed punched-out end eye 9 with the two auxiliary pressed sections 7 and 7' and the ridses 8 and 8'.<br>
Especially in Fig. 5 it can be seen that by forming the two other pressed sections or auxiliary pressed sections 7 and 7', the transition area of the widened strip of the heddle in the area of the end eye to the non-deformed strip section of the heddle remains relatively flat and whereby said transition area is additionally strengthened by forming the two ridges 8 and 8'  In contrast to the state-of-the-art of known designs of end eyes with widened strips, the innovative design of tlie strip material leads to increased stability whereby a heddle is created that also meets the stress requirements found in modern weaving mills.<br>
The design of an end eye with corresponding squeeze-pressed sections illustrated in Fig. 1 through fig. 5 is of course only an example to allow better understanding of the present invention. Thus it is also possible, for instance, to provide yet another pressed section or auxiliary pressed section only in the area of one end of the middle pressed section, or it is possible to indent the strip only on one side to create a squeeze-pressed section. Also the manufacruring method of the squeeze-pressed sections is insignificant it itself but preferably it is performed by cold forming.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
