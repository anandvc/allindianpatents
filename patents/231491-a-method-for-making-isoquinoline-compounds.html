1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to Isoquinoline Derivatives; compositions comprising an effective amoimt of an Isoquinoline Derivative; and methods for treating or preventing an inflammatory disease or a repermsion disease comprising the adrninistration of au effective amount of an Isoquinoline Derivative.<br>
2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, colitis, and autoimmtme diabetes, typilly manifest themselves as disorders distinct from those associated with reperfusion diseases, e.g., stroke and heart attack, and can clinically manifest themselves as different entities. However, there can be common underlying mechanisms between these two types of disorders. In particular, inflarnrnatory disease and reperfusion disease can induce proimlaannatory cytokine and dxernokine synthesjs which can, in turn, result in production of cytotoxic free radicals such as nitric oxide and superoxide. NO and superoxide can react to formperoxynitrite (ONOO") (Szabo et al, Shock 6:79-88,1996).<br>
The ONOO"-induced cell necrosis observed in inflammatory disease and in reperfusion disease involves the activation of the nuclear enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS). Activation of PARS is thought to be an important step in the cell-mediated death observed in inflammation and repermsion disease (Szab6 ex al, Trends Pharmacol. Scl. 19:287-98,1998),<br>
A number of PARS inhibitors have been described in the art See, e.g., Banasik et al, J. BioL Chem., 267:1569-75,1992, and Banasik et al, Mol. Cell. Biochem.,<br>
99/11649; WO 99/11645; WO 99/1X644; WO 99/11628; WO 99/11623; WO 99/11311; WO 00/42040; Zhang et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 278:590-98,2000; White et al., J. Med. Chem., 43:4084-4097,2000; Griffin et al, J. Med Chem., 41:5247-5256, 1998; Shinkwin etal, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 7:297-308,1999; and Soriano et al, Nature Medicine, 7:108-113,2001. Adverse effects associated with administration of PARS inhibitors have been discussed in Milan et al, Science, 223:589-591,1984.<br>
Isoquinoline compounds have been previously discussed in the art. For example, cytotoxic non-camptothecin topoisomerase I inhibitors are reported in Cushrnan et al, J. Med. Chem., 43:3688-3698,2300 and Cushrnan et al., L Med, Chem. 42:446-57,1999;<br><br><br>
indeno[l,2-c]isoquinolines are reported as antineoplastic agents in Cushman et al, WO 00/21537; and as neoplasm inhibitors in Hrbata et al., WO 93/05023.<br>
Syntheses of isoquinoline compounds have been reported. For example, see Wawzonek et al, Org. Prep. Proc. Int., 14:163-8, 1982; Wawzonek et al., Can. J. Chem., 59:2833, 1981; Andoi et al, Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 47:1014-17, 1974; Dusemund etal, Arch. Pharm (Weinheim, Ger.), 3 17:381-2, 1984; and Lai et al, Indian J. Chem., Sect. B, 388:33-39, 1999.<br>
There remains, however, a need in the art for compounds useful for treating or preventing inflammatory diseases or reperfusion diseases.<br>
Citation of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not an admission that the reference is prior art.<br>

Illustrative examples of cells capable of expressing PARS include, but are not limited to, muscle, bone, gum, nerve, brain, liver, kidney, pancreas, lung, heart, bladder, stomach, colon, rectal, small intestine, skin, esophageal, eye, larynx, uterine, ovarian, prostate, tendon, bone marrow, blood, lymph, testicular, vaginal and neoplastic cells.<br>
Also provided in the invention is a method for inhibiting, preventing, or treating inflammation or an inflammatory disease in a subject. The inflammation can be associated with an inflammatory disease. Inflammatory diseases can arise where there is an inflammation of the body tissue. These include local inflammatory responses and systemic inflammation. Examples of such diseases include: organ transplant rejection; reoxygenation injury resulting from organ transplantation (see Grupp et al., J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 31:297-303 (1999)) including, but not limited to, transplantation of the following<br>
organs: heart, lung, liver and kidney; chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and bone diseases associated with increased bone resorption; inflammatory bowel diseases such as ileitis, ulcerative colitis, Barrett's syndrome, and Crohn's disease; inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic obstructive airway disease; inflammatory diseases of the eye including corneal dystrophy, trachoma, onchocerciasis, uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmitis and endophthalmitis; chronic inflammatory diseases of the gum, including gingivitis and periodontitis; tuberculosis; leprosy; inflammatory diseases of the kidney including uremic complications, glomerulonephritis and nephrosis; inflammatory diseases of the skin including sclerodermatitis, psoriasis and eczema; inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, including chronic demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, AIDS-related neurodegeneration and Alzheimer s disease, infectious meningitis, encephalomyelitis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and viral or autoinimune encephalitis; autoimmune diseases including Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus; diabetic complications, including, but not limited to, diabetic cataract, glaucoma, retinopathy, nephropathy, such as microaluminuria and progressive diabetic nephropathy, polyneuropathy, gangrene of the feet, atherosclerotic coronary arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, nonketotic hyperglycemichyperosmolar coma, mononeuropathies, autonomic neuropathy, foot ulcers, joint problems, and a skin or mucous membrane complication, such as an infection, a shin spot, a candidal infection or necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum; irnmune-complex vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); inflammatory diseases of the heart such as cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease hypercholesterolemia, and atherosclerosis; as well as various other diseases that can have significant inflammatory components, including preeclampsia; chronic liver failure, brain and spinal cord trauma, and cancer. The inflammatory disease can also be a systemic inflammation of the body, exemplified by gram-positive or gram negative shock, hemorrhagic or anaphylactic shock, or shock induced by cancer chemotherapy in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., shock associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such shock can be induced, e.g., by a chemotherapeutic agent that is adminstered as a treatment for cancer.<br>
In one embodiment, a reoxygenation injury resulting from organ transplantation occurs during the organ transplantation.<br>
The invention also includes methods for treating, preventing, or otherwise inhibiting reperfusion disease in a subject in need of treatment, prevention, or inhibition<br>
thereof. The method comprises administering an Isoquinoline Derivative in an amount sufficient to treat, prevent or inhibit reperfusion disease in the subject. Reperfusion refers to the process whereby blood flow in the blood vessels is resumed following ischemia, such as occurs following constriction or obstruction of the vessel. Reperfusion disease can result following a naturally occurring episode, such as a myocardial infarction, stroke, or during a surgical procedure where blood flow in vessels is intentionally or unintentionally blocked.<br>
In some embodiments, the subject is administered an effective amount of an Isoquinoline Derivative.<br>
The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions useful for treating or preventing an inflammatory disease or a reperfusion disease, or for inhibiting PARS activity, or more than one of these activities. The compositions can be suitable for internal use and comprise an effective amount of an Isoquinoline Derivative and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The Isoquinoline Derivatives are especially useful in that they demonstrate very low peripheral toxicity or, no peripheral toxicity.<br>
The Isoquinoline Derivatives can be administered in amounts that are sufficient to treat or prevent an inflammatory disease or a reperfusion disease and/or prevent the development thereof in subjects.<br>
Administration of the Isoquinoline Derivatives can be accomplished via any mode of administration for therapeutic agents. These modes include systemic or local administration such as oral, nasal, parenteral, transdermal, subcutaneous, vaginal, buccal, rectal or topical administration modes.<br>
Depending on the intended mode of administration, the compositions can be in solid, semi-solid or liquid dosage form, such as, for example, injectables, tablets, suppositories, pills, time-release capsules, elixirs, tinctures, emulsions, syrups, powders, liquids, suspensions, or the like, preferably in unit dosages and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. Likewise, they can also be administered in intravenous (both bolus and infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intramuscular form, all using forms well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts.<br>

The Isoquinoline Derivatives can be also formulated as a suppository that can be prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions; using polyalkylene glycols such as propylene glycol, as the carrier.<br>
The Isoquinoline Derivatives can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, containing cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines. In some embodiments, a film of lipid components is hydrated with an aqueous solution of drug to a form lipid layer encapsulating the drug, as described in United States Patent No. 5,262,564.<br>
Isoquinoline Derivatives can also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the Isoquinoline Derivative molecules are coupled. The Isoquinoline Derivatives can also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol,<br>
polyhydroxyethylaspanamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the Isoquinoline Derivatives can be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Parental injectable administration is generally used for subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular or intravenous injections and infusions. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions or solid forms suitable for * dissolving in liquid prior to injection.<br>
One embodiment, for parenteral administration employs the implantation of a slow-release or sustained-released system, according to U.S. Pat. No. 3,710,795, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compositions can be sterilized or contain non-toxic amounts of adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure pH buffering agents, and other substances, including, but not limited to, sodium acetate or triethanolamine oleate. In addition, they can also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
Compositions can be prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and the present pharmaceutical compositions can contain from about 0.1 % to about 99 %, preferably from about 1 % to about 70 % of the Isoquinoline Derivative by weight or volume.<br>
The dosage regimen utilizing the Isoquinoline Derivative is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal or hepatic function of the patient; and the particular Isoquinoline Derivative employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition.<br>
Effective dosage amounts of the present invention, when used for the indicated effects, range from about 0.05 to about 1000 mg of Isoquinoline Derivative per day. Compositions for in vivo or in vitro use can contain about 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0,15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100.0, 250.0, 500.0 or 1000.0 mg of Isoquinoline Derivative. In one embodiment, the compositions are in the form of a tablet that can be scored. Effective plasma levels of the Isoquinoline Derivatives can range from about 0.002 mg to about 50 mg per kg of body weight per day.<br>
Isoquinoline Derivatives can be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage can be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, Isoquinoline Derivatives can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art.

Example 2. Effect of Illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives on PARS activity in cultured macrophages, using a whole-cell based assay and a purified enzyme assay.<br>
Demonstration of illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives' ability to inhibit PARS and prevent peroxynitrite induced cytotoxicity was shown using methods described in<br><br>
Virag et al., Br. J. Pharmacol.  1999, 126(3):769-77; and Immunology 1998, 94(3):345-55. RAW mouse macrophages were cultured in DMEM medium with high glucose and ^Supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum. Cells were used at 80 % confluence in 12-well plates. Cells were pretreated with various concentrations (100 nM -1 gM) of an Isoquinoline Derivative for 10 min. Peroxynitrite, a prototypical oxidant which induces DNA single strand breakage, was used to induce PARS activation. Peroxynitrite was diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 11.0) and added to the cells in a bolus of 50 /il. Cells were then incubated for 20 min. Peroxynitrite was decomposed by incubation for 30 min at pH 7.0, used as a control, and failed to influence the parameter studied. After the 20 min incubation, the cells were spun, the medium was aspirated and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml assay buffer (56 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 28 mM KC1, 28 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01 % w/v digitonin and 0.125 (M NAD+ and 0.5 jiCi/ml 3H-NAD+). Following an incubation in assay buffer, (10 min at 37°C), PARS activity was measured as follows: 200 ul ice cold 50 % w/v TCA was added and the samples were incubated for 4 hours at 4°C. Samples were then spun (10 min @ 10,000 g) and pellets washed twice with ice cold 5 % w/v TCA and solubilized overnight in 250 ul 2 % w/v SDS/0.1 N NaOH at 37°C. The contents of the tubes were added to 6.5 ml ScintiSafe Plus scintillation liquid (Fisher Scientific) and radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). The results shown in Table 1 demonstrate that the illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives significantly and dose-dependently inhibit the activation of PARS in the macrophage assay.<br>
Table 1. Inhibitory effect of various novel substituted isoquinolines on PARS activation in cultured murine macrophages. (Table Removed)<br>
The potency of inhibition on purified PARS enzyme was subsequently determined for selected Isoquinoline Derivatives, and the potency was compared with that of 3-aminobenzamide, a prototypical benchmark PARS inhibitor. The assay was performed in 96 well ELISA plates according to instructions provided with a commercially available PARS inhibition assay kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, wells were coated with 1 mg/mL histone (50 ul/well) at 4°C overnight. Plates were then washed four times with PBS and then blocked by adding 50 ul Strep-Diluent (supplied with the kit). After incubation (Ih, room temperature), the plates were washed four times with PBS. Appropriate dilutions of<br>
PARS inhibitors were combined with 2x PARS cocktail (1.95 mM NAD+, 50 uM biotinylated NAD+ in 50 mM TRIS pH 8.0, 25 mM MgCl2) and high specific activity PARS enzyme (both were supplied with the kit) in a volume of 50 ul. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. After 4 washes in PBS, incorporated<br>
biotin was detected by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:500 dilution) and TAGS Sapphire substrate. The assay confirmed the results of the macrophage-based PARS assay. For example, the PARS inhibitor 81 exerted 50 % inhibition of PARS activity in this assay at 3 nM, and thus was approximately 50,000 times more potent than the reference compound 3-aminobenzamide.<br>
Example 3: Effects of illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives in various models of inflammatory disease and reperfusion disease<br>
a:        Effects of illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives on in vitro cell disease models<br>
In additional in vitro studies in isolated thymocytes, cells were exposed to peroxynitrite or hydrogen peroxide (toxic oxidant species) to induce cytotoxicity. In this system the toxicity is, at least in part, related to activation of the nuclear enzyme PARS. In this oxidant-stimulated thymocyte assay (described, in detail, in Virag et al., Immunology 94(3):345-55, 1998), the compounds tested prevented the oxidant-induced suppression of the viability of the cells and did so at the low nanomolar concentration range. An example of this response (Compound 81) is shown in Table 2. This assay represents an in vitro model of cells dying because of exposure to pro-oxidant species, as it occurs in during the reperfusion of ischemic organs.<br>

(Figure Removed)b:        Effect of illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives on in vivo models of inflammatory diseases<br>
In order to substantiate the efficacy of the compounds in inflammatory diseases, the effect of illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives was demonstrated in a systemic inflammatory model induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is reported to be responsible for causing reperfusion diseases and inflammatory diseases such as septic shock and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in animals (see Parrillo, N. Engl. J. Med., 328:1471-1478 (1993) and Lamping, J. Clin. Invest. 101:2065-2071 (1998). In a<br><br>
series of experiments, mice were pretreated with intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg of compounds 81, 8p and 8j, and LPS at 10 mg/kg was injected i.p., and &gt;TNF-alpha was measured in the plasma at 90 minutes. As shown in Table 3, all compounds substantially reduced TNF production, indicative of the compounds' anti-inflammatory activity.<br>
Table 3. Reduction of LPS induced TNF production by 0.1-1 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of the PARS inhibitor compounds 81, 8p and 8j in mice in vivo(Figure Removed)All compounds markedly suppressed LPS induced TNF production when compared to control.<br>
At high doses, LPS causes multiple organ dysfunction resembling of septic shock, and ultimately death (in part because of the early release of TNF-alpha). Similarly, in a model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), the live bacteria that derive from the intestinal flora induce systemic inflammation and shock. Agents that inhibit inflammatory mediator production, PARS activation, and cell death in this model prevent mortality induced by LPS or CLP. In experiments with Balb/c mice, injection of 100 mg/kg LPS intraperitoneally caused death in 50 % of the animals over 24 h, whereas treatment of the animals with 3 mg/kg/day of compound 81 reduced the endotoxin-induced mortality to 10 % under the same experimental conditions. In response to CLP induced shock, compound 81 (3 mg/kg/day) caused a reduction in the mortality from 100 % death to 60 % death over 24 h.<br>
The data demonstrating the reduction of TNF production by illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives in animals subjected to an inflammation model, coupled with the fact that TNF production is an important trigger of inflammation in various inflammatory diseases (such as, for example, colitis, arthritis and neuroinflammation and shock) indicate that the Isoquinoline Derivatives have therapeutic effects in various systemic and local inflammatory diseases, including the rejection of transplanted organs, which entails both an inflammatory disease component and a reperfusion disease component and, accordingly, are useful for treating or preventing an inflammatory disease or a reperfusion<br>
disease.<br>
p.        Effect of illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives on in vivo models of reperfusion disease<br>
In order to substantiate the efficacy of the Isoquinoline Derivatives in ischemia-reperfusion conditions, the effect of an illustrative Isoquinoline Derivative in a mouse model of ischemic and reperfused gut was tested. The superior mesenteric artery was occluded for 45 min, followed by a reperfusion for 1 h. Following the end of the reperfusion, gut permeability was measured with the FD4 method in evened gut sacks (Liaudet et al., Shock 2000, 14(2): 134-41). Ischemia-reperfusion increased the permeability of the gut from Il±4to216±27 ml/min/cm2, indicative of severe damage of the reperfused gut. Treatment with Compound 81 (3 mg/kg i.v., injected 10 min prior to initiation of reperfusion) reduced the increase in the permeability of the gut by approximately 73 %, indicating a marked maintenance of the gut function. The ischemia-reperfusion studies in the gut were associated with a 80 % mortality over 12 hours, whereas only 15 % mortality was noted in the animals treated with 81.<br>
In another set of experiments, the effect of Compound 81 in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion was assayed as described in Abdelkarim et al., Int J Mol Med. 2001, 7(3):255-60. Occlusion lasted for 2 hours, followed by reperfusion for 24 hours. Infarct size was quantified with tetrazolium staining. Compound 81 was administered at 3 mg/kg/day in 3 divided intraperitoneally injected doses, the first dose being administered 10 min prior to the initiation of reperfusion. There was an approximately 80 % reduction in the degree of cortical necrosis and neuronal death in the animals administered with 81, when compared to vehicle-treated controls. This protection also translated into functional benefit, such as neurological improvements in the PARS inhibitor treated group.<br>
These data indicate that the Isoquinoline Derivatives have therapeutic effects in various systemic and local conditions of reperfusion diseases, including the rejection of transplanted organs, which entails both an inflammatory disease component and a reperfusion disease component and, accordingly, are useful for treating or preventing an inflammatory disease or a reperfusion disease.<br>
d:        Effect of illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives in a diabetes model<br>
PARS inhibitors and PARS deficiency are known to reduce the development of<br>
diabetes and the incidence of diabetic complications (Mabley et al., Br J Pharmacol. 2001,133(6):909-9; and Soriano et al., Nat Med. 2001, 7(1):108-13). In order to fsubstantiate the efficacy of the Isoquinoline Derivatives in a diabetes model, a single high-dose streptozotocin model of diabetes was conducted as previously described. Briefly, 160 mg/kg streptozotocin was injected to mice treated with vehicle or with illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives intraperitoneally (3 mg/kg) and 3 days later blood sugar levels were determined using a blood glucose meter. The data shown in Table 4 demonstrate that the illustrative Isoquinoline Derivatives attenuate the streptozotocin-induced onset of diabetes as they reduce the hyperglycemia.<br>
Table 4. Reduction of streptozotocin (STZ) induced hyperglycemia by 3 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of the PARS inhibitor compounds 81, 8p and 8j in mice in vivo(Figure Removed)Accordingly, the Isoquinoline Derivatives are useful for treating or preventing diabetes or a diabetic complication.<br>
