				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a microlisa HIV (Ag &amp; Ab) device for analyzing the presence of HIV 1 and HIV 2 antibodies and HIV 1 p24 antigen to HIV 1 in human serum and plasma.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for making microlisa HIV (Ag &amp; Ab) device for analyzing the presence of HIV 1 and HIV 2 antibodies and p24 antigen to HIV 1 in human serum and plasma.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the analyzing the presence of HIV 1 and HIV 2 antibodies and p24 antigen to HIV 1 in human serum and plasma.<br>
The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) is recommended as the screening method for the detection of HIV 1 &amp; HIV 2 antibodies and p24 antigen to HIV-1.<br>
Microlisa HIV Ag &amp; Ab is developed to detect antibodies to HIV -1 and / HIV 2 with equal reactivity; for and also antigen to HIV-1. Antigen can generally be detected in acute phase and during symptomatic phase of AIDS and antibodies can be detected throughout the infection.<br>
It is an in-vitro qualitative enzyme immunoassay for the detection on antibodies to HIV -1 and or HIV -2 and HIV1 antigen in human serum or plasma. It is intended for clinical diagnostic testing and screening of blood donors or other individuals at the risk for HIV-1 / HIV-2infection and HIV-1 antigen .<br>
The serological events following the HIV infection are represented graphically in figure 1. In individuals infected with HIV, antigen appears first before antibody of HIV but due to the seroconversion, the antigen is lost and antibody develops within 3-6weeks after infection and thereby the level of the antibody increases.<br><br>
Microlisa HIV Ag &amp; Ab is a test device for the detection of both antigen and antibody to HIV. Antigen can generally only be detected during the acute and during the symptomatic phase of AIDS. Antibodies to HIV 1 and HIV2 can be detected throughout virtually the entire infection period. When the virus enters in to the body, the earlier detection of the disease is impossible because the virus enters in to a window phase and subsequently the immune system start producing antibodies. So the use of highly sensitive antibody assay is therefore an established approach in serodiagnosis of HIV infection. Progressive improvements in assay sensitivity have reduced that window phase. Further shortening of this period can be achieved by the incorporation of HIV antigen detection in such antibody tests enabling the detection of the infected individuals at the earliest possible moment. So the Microlisa HIV Ag &amp; Ab detects both HIV1, HIV2 and HIV-1 antigens preferably p24 antigen in human serum and plasma.<br>
Antigens used for HIV 1 in the microtiter wells are a complex of recombinent proteins/ peptides, representing immunodominant epitopes, gp41and C terminus of gp120 .Similarly antigens used for HIV2 are recombinent protein/ peptides of gp 36. For HIV -1 P24 antigen detection, antibodies used are HIV -1 p24 antibodies.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
An HIV ELISA, [also called an HIV Enzyme ImmunoAssay (EIA)] is the first and most basic test to determine if an individual is positive for HIV.<br>
The most commonly used format for ELISA is microplate ELISA commonly known as "microelisa". Today, microelisa is one of the most reliable method of choice for screening blood and blood bank products for viral infectious and some bacterial infections.<br>
US Patent No. 5169753 describes a novel retrovirus isolated from human lymphoma cells. The retrovirus is characterized by a C-type retroviral particle of<br><br>
approximately 100 nm diameter; and an approximately 27,000 molecular weight p24 core protein. Also disclosed are cell lines from which the virus can be obtained and screening methods for detecting the presence of the virus in human sera.<br>
US Patent No. 6,593,079 concerns a process for diagnosis of an HIV infection by means of an immunoassay using the specific detection of the p24 antigen of HIV1, HIV1-SubO and/or the p26 antigen of HIV2, at least one antibody against the env region of HIV1, HIV1-SubO and/or of HIV2 and at least one antibody against the pol and/or gag region of HIV1, HIV1-SubO and/or HIV2, reagent kits and test strips suitable for diagnostic procedure as well as monoclonal antibodies against p24 and their use.<br>
Us Patent No. 5641624 provides a method for determining the amount of HIV-1 p24 antigen or anti-HIV-1 p24 antibody present in a suitable bodily fluid sample from an HIV-1-infected subject. This invention also provides a kit for determining the amount of HIV-1 p24 antigen or anti-HIV-1 p24 antibody present in an HIV-1 -infected subject.<br>
US 5721095 discloses A method for producing an improved solid phase antigenic reagent useful in an immunoassay for detecting antibodies specific for a virus, such as the human immunodeficiency virus, which comprising the addition to a natural viral lysate a synthetic or recombinant viral protein or peptide. Also provided is an improved immunoassay utilizing the solid phase antigenic reagent.<br>
US 7115363 relates to a new class of retroviruses, designated by HIV-2, of which samples have been deposited to the ECACC under numbers 87.01.1001 and 87.01.1002 and to the NCIB under numbers 12.398 and 12.399.lt relates also to antigens capable to be obtained from this virus, particularly proteins p12, p16, p26 and gp140. These various antigens can be used for the diagnosis of the disease, especially by contacting these antigens with a serum of a patient<br><br>
Submitted to the diagnosis. It relates to immunogenic compositions containing more particularly the glycoprotein gp 140. Finally it concerns neucleotidic sequences, which can be used especially as hybridization probes, derived from the RNA of HIV 2.<br>
US 6265149 directed toward in vitro methods for the detection of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 ( HIV 2) antibodies employing polypeptide fragments of HIV 2 Gag.<br>
These methods have sub optimal sensitivity and specificity and abundance of false<br>
positive in low prevalence population. These patents suffer from disadvantages like not<br>
user-friendly, time consuming, laborious and costly.<br>
It doesn't provide a method of detection of HIV for a man of ordinary skill to perform.<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the above said disadvantages and<br>
hence the present invention came.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a diagnostic method for HIV  which<br>
requires minimal amounts of labour and equipment.<br>
The test procedure is quite simple and rapid, i.e. the test can be completed within 30<br>
minutes. It does not require any instrumentation and trained person. It is very economical.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an inexpensive, novel, simple, rapid<br>
diagnostic device, which detects and differentiates HIV antigen and antibodies present in<br>
human serum and plasma.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a test device to the man of<br>
ordinary prudence, which will take a short time to perform the test.<br>
Principle of the test<br>
The test is performed in a 8X12 wells which contains an 8x12 matrix of 96 wells , each<br>
of which are about 1 cm high and 0.7 cm in diameter.<br>
Microlisa HIV Ag &amp; Ab test is an enzyme immunoassay based on "Sandwich ELISA"<br>
Figure 2 shows the principle.<br>
Recombinant protein/ peptides gp41 and C terminus of gp 120 are for HIV-1 immunodominant epitopes of gp 36 are for HIV -2 and p24 antibodies for the detection of HIV -1 p24 antigen are coated on to microtiter wells. Specimens and controls are added to the microtiter wells followed by addition of enzyme conjugate. HIV 1 &amp; 2 antigen and HIV -1 p24 antibodies linked with HRPO. ( HRPO is an enzyme, Horse Radish Per Oxide). A sandwich complex is formed in the well where in HIV -1 or HIV 2 antibodies or HIV 1 p24 antigen ( from serum sample) is sandwiched between the antigens and antigens HRPO and antibody and antibody HRPO conjugate. ( antibodies in the sample are sandwiched between the antigens in the microwells and antigen HRPO conjugate and HIV-1 p24 antigens are sandwiched in between the antibodies of HIV-1 p24 in the micro wells and antibodies HRPO conjugate). The plate is then washed to remove unbound material. Finally substrate solution containing chromogen and<br><br><br>
hydrogen peroxide is added to the wells and incubated. A blue colour will develop in proportion to the amount of HIV-1and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen present in the specimen. The colour reaction is stopped by a stop solution. The enzyme substrate reaction is read by EIA reader for absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nm. If the sample does not contain HIV- 1 or HIV-2 antibodies or HIV-1 p24 antigen, then enzyme conjugate will not bind and the solution in the wells be either colourless or only a faint background colour develops.<br>
Interpretation of the result<br>
After adding the conjugate , if the sample is blue in colour then the patients' sample is reactive for HIV. If there is no colour to the solution, then the sample is not reactive to the HIV. Stop solution such as acids added to stop the reaction. After adding the stop solution, if the solution is yellow in colour, the sample is reactive for HIV and if there is no yellow colour, then the sample is not reactive for HIV.<br>
Samples<br>
Reagents and the samples should be at room temperature before beginning the assay<br>
Only human serum or plasma should be used for the test. Fresh serum or plasma samples are preferred. While preparing the samples, remove the serum from the clot as soon as possible to avoid heamolysis. Specimens should be free of microbial contamination and may be stored at 2 to 8°C for one week, or frozen at 20°Cor lower. Repeated freezing and thawing should be avoided.<br>
Frozen sample<br><br>
Microlisa HIV Ag&amp; Ab test is best used with fresh samples that have not been frozen and thawed. However the most frozen samples will perform well if the following procedure suggested is followed.<br>
Allow the frozen samples to thaw in a vertical position in the rack. Don't shake the sample. This allows the particles to settle in the bottom. The sample should be centrifuged.<br>
(Preparation of working chromoqeneic substrate solution( TMB) Dilute TMB concentrate in the ratio 1:100 in substrate, i.e. TMB diluent. The 100X solution may crystallize during storage. If crystals are present, resolubilize by warming at room temperature.<br>
