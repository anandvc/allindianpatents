REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of<br>
provisional application serial number 60/776,114 filed on February 23, 2006, which is<br>
hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to a method for treating a substrate with a<br>
polymer film-forming composition. More particularly, the disclosure relates to a<br>
paper or paperboard manufacturing method comprising the steps of applying a<br>
polymer film-forming coating to a substrate, and, bringing the polymer coating into<br>
contact with a heated surface while the polymer coating is still in a wet state. The<br>
resulting polymer layer has a smooth surface with voids (e.g., bubbles) just below the<br>
surface. In certain embodiments, the polymer coating may comprise a crosslinkable<br>
hydrogel, and a crosslinking solution may be applied to the polymer coating on the<br>
substrate surface thereby forming at least a partially crosslinked polymer coating then<br>
placed into contact with a heated surface. The present disclosure also relates to a<br>
treated substrate product.<br>
[0003] Paper is manufactured by an essentially continuous production process<br>
wherein a dilute aqueous slurry of cellulosic fiber flows into the wet end of a paper<br>
machine and a consolidated dried web of indefinite length emerges continuously from<br>
the paper machine dry end. The wet end of the paper machine comprises one or more<br>
headboxes, a drainage section and a press section. The dry end of a modern paper<br>
machine comprises a multiplicity of steam heated, rotating shell cylinders distributed<br>
along a serpentine web traveling route under a heat confining hood structure.<br>
Although there are numerous design variations for each of these paper machine<br>
sections, the commercially most important of the variants is the fourdrinier machine<br>
wherein the headbox discharges a wide jet of the slurry onto a moving screen of<br>
extremely fine mesh.<br>
[0004] The screen is constructed and driven as an endless belt carried over a<br>
plurality of support rolls or foils. A pressure differential across the screen from the<br>
side in contact with the slurry to the opposite side draws water from the slurry through<br>
the screen while that section of the screen travels along a table portion of the screen<br>
route circuit. As slurry dilution water is extracted, the fibrous constituency of the<br><br><br>
slurry accumulates on the screen surface as a wet but substantially consolidated mat.<br>
Upon arrival at the end of the screen circuit table length, the mat has accumulated<br>
sufficient mass and tensile strength to carry a short physical gap between the screen<br>
and the first press roll. This first press roll carries the mat into a first press nip<br>
wherein the major volume of water remaining in the mat is removed by roll nip<br>
squeezing. One or more additional press nips may follow.<br>
[0005] From the press section, the mat continuum, now generally characterized as a<br>
web, enters the dryer section of the paper machine to have the remaining water<br>
removed thermodynamically.<br>
[0006] Generally speaking, the most important fibers for the manufacture of paper<br>
are obtained from softwood and hardwood tree species. However, fibers obtained<br>
from straw or bagasse have been utilized in certain cases. Both chemical and<br>
mechanical defiberizing processes, well known to the prior art, are used to separate<br>
papermaking fiber from the composition of natural growth. Papermaking fiber<br>
obtained by chemical defiberizing processes and methods is generally called chemical<br>
pulp whereas papermaking fiber derived from mechanical defiberizing methods may<br>
be called groundwood pulp or mechanical pulp. There also are combined defiberizing<br>
processes such as semichemical, thermochemical or thermomechanical. Any of the<br>
tree species may be defiberized by either chemical or mechanical methods. However,<br>
some species and defiberizing processes are better economic or functional matches<br>
than others.<br>
[0007] An important difference between chemical and mechanical pulp is that<br>
mechanical pulp may be passed directly from the defiberizing stage to the paper<br>
machine. Chemical pulp on the other hand must be mechanically defiberized, washed<br>
and screened, at a minimum, after chemical digestion. Usually, chemical pulp is also<br>
mechanically refined after screening and prior to the paper machine. Additionally, the<br>
average fiber length of mechanical pulp is, as a rule, shorter than that of chemical<br>
pulp. However, fiber length is also highly dependent upon the wood species from<br>
which the fiber originates. Softwood fiber is generally about three times longer than<br>
hardwood fiber.<br>
[0008] The ultimate properties of a particular paper are determined in large part by<br>
the species of raw material used and the manner in which the paper machine and web<br><br><br>
forming process treat these raw materials. Important operative factors in the<br>
mechanism of forming the paper web are the headbox and screen.<br>
[0009] Coated paper or paperboard used for printing and for packaging is generally<br>
required to have high level of gloss, excellent smoothness, and excellent printability,<br>
as well as certain strength and stiffness characteristics.<br>
[0010] If the coated paper or paperboard has a high stiffness, it can pass smoothly<br>
through high-speed printing or packaging machines with less feeding jams. Higher<br>
stiffness paper can be advantageously used in books, magazines, and catalogues,<br>
because it provides a feel of hardness or heaviness similar to a hardcover book. For<br>
packaging, high stiffness is necessary for maintaining the structural integrity of the<br>
paperboard product during filling and in subsequent use.<br>
[0011] Stiffness has close relationship to the basis weight and density of paper.<br>
There is a general trend that stiffness increases as the basis weight increases, and<br>
decreases as the paper density increases. Stiffness and other properties can be<br>
improved by increasing basis weight. However, this would result in a product<br>
utilizing more fibers, which add cost and weight. Therefore, coated paper or<br>
paperboard with high stiffness but moderate basis weight is desirable. Paper with<br>
moderate basis weight is also more economical because less raw material (fiber) is<br>
utilized. In addition, shipping costs based on weight are less for low basis weight<br>
paper.<br>
[0012] In addition to high stiffness, coated paper or paperboard which must be<br>
printed is often required to have high gloss and smoothness. For coated paper or<br>
paperboard to have such quality characteristics, density typically must be increased to<br>
some extent to allow for a usable printing surface. Smoothness is normally achieved<br>
by calendering. However, calendering will cause a reduction in caliper, which<br>
typically results in a corresponding reduction in stiffness. The calendering process<br>
deteriorates the stiffness of paper by significantly reducing caliper and increasing the<br>
density. The base sheet for conventional coated board grades typically is heavily<br>
densified by calendering to provide a surface roughness low enough to produce final<br>
coated smoothness acceptable to the industry. These calendering processes, including<br>
wet stack treatment, may increase density by as much as 20% to 25%.<br><br><br>
[0013] Thus, the relationship between gloss and stiffness and between smoothness<br>
and stiffness are generally inversely proportional to each other, for a given amount of<br>
fiber per unit area. Packaging grades are sold based on caliper, so manufacturing<br>
processes that reduce the caliper (increasing the density of the board) decrease the<br>
selling price. Processes that cause less caliper reduction save material costs. Caliper<br>
is measured in "points", where a point = 0.001 inches. For example, the conventional<br>
method for making a 10-point board requires the use of a board having a thickness of<br>
greater than 12 points prior to calendering. It would be desirable to be able to<br>
produce a finished board having approximately the same thickness as the starting<br>
substrate.<br>
[0014] Improvements in the calendering process including moisture gradient<br>
calendering, hot calendering, soft calendering, and belt calendering slightly improved<br>
stiffness for a given caliper but did not change the fundamental ratio between caliper,<br>
stiffness, smoothness, and printing properties.<br>
[0015] Various proposals have been made to improve the stiffness of coated paper<br>
or paperboard without calendering for printing. For example, several proposals<br>
include high softwood content in the raw stock, addition of specially engineered fibers<br>
in the raw stock, addition of highly branched polymers within the raw stock, and high<br>
amounts of starch or copolymer latex with a high glass transition temperature<br>
(commonly referred to as "Tg") within the coating formulation.<br>
[0016] However, potential drawbacks to these methods of stiffness improvement are<br>
that although they are useful in improving paper stiffness, they could potentially<br>
degrade the smoothness, gloss, and/or printability of the coated paper obtained.<br>
[0017] For the reasons mentioned above, it has been very difficult to obtain<br>
satisfactory paper smoothness without increasing density. Other methods can be used<br>
for changing the density/smoothness relationship in paper and paperboard grades.<br>
Applying a paper coating is a very common way to enhance the surface properties of<br>
paper without causing the drastic increases in paper density typically associated with<br>
the levels of calendering required to obtain a certain level of smoothness. Preferably,<br>
the final coated surface should be uniform to provide acceptable appearance and<br>
printing properties.<br><br><br><br>
[0018] Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a paper or paperboard product<br>
having the desired properties while maintaining the initial density of the sheet or<br>
minimizing the increase in density. Furthermore, it would be desirable to provide a<br>
paper or paperboard exhibiting improved smoothness without the concomitant<br>
increase in density associated with conventional methods for creating smoothness.<br>
Cast coating methods exist for producing a very smooth surface, but these methods<br>
are typically run at production rates slower than the speed of many paper machines.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0036] In describing the preferred embodiments, certain terminology will be utilized<br>
for the sake of clarity. It is intended that such terminology include not only the<br>
recited embodiments but all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner, for<br>
a similar purpose, to achieve a similar result. The citation of any document is not to<br>
be construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention.<br><br><br>
Unless indicated otherwise or unless the context suggests otherwise, all weights,<br>
percentages, and ratios are by weight.<br>
[0037] The present disclosure relates to a method for treating a substrate with a<br>
polymer film-forming coating. More particularly, the disclosure relates to a paper or<br>
paperboard manufacturing method comprising the steps of applying a polymer coating<br>
to a substrate, and bringing the polymer coating into contact with a heated surface<br>
while the polymer coating is still in a wet state. Boiling of water in the polymer<br>
coating causes voids to form under the surface, but the surface of the film is smooth.<br>
The paper or paperboard produced in accordance with certain embodiments of the<br>
present invention exhibits desirable levels of surface flatness and smoothness without<br>
significant densification of the base paper. In certain embodiments, the polymer<br>
coating may include a crosslinkable material and a crosslinking solution may be<br>
applied to the polymer coating on the substrate surface thereby forming at least a<br>
partially crosslinked polymer film-forming composition. In such cases, the polymer<br>
coating may typically be applied to the web first and then the cross linking solution<br>
applied before the treated web contacts the heated surface. For weakly cross linking<br>
polymers, it may be possible to provide the cross linking solution in the coating itself.<br>
[0038] One advantage of treating a substrate with a polymer film-forming coating in<br>
accordance with the present invention relates to the improvement in smoothness<br>
and/or flatness that can be obtained without significantly increasing the density or<br>
decreasing the caliper of the sheet. The heavy calendering of the cellulose paper web<br>
associated with conventional techniques is not required to produce a paper having<br>
print properties comparable to conventional coated papers. Furthermore, even when<br>
the cellulose paper web is smoothed, much lower pressures can be applied to provide<br>
similar printing properties on papers with increased stiffness. In accordance with<br>
certain embodiments of the present invention, the cellulose paper web is smoothed<br>
such that the caliper decreases not more than about 7% and typically is decreased by<br>
between about 2% and 5%. By comparison, conventional coated papers are typically<br>
calendered before coating at much higher pressures, which cause an increase in<br>
density of from about 20 to 25%. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the<br>
cellulose paper web may be calendered to a Parker Print Surf smoothness of between<br>
about 2 and 6 microns prior to application of the polymer film. However, substrates<br>
with higher Parker Print Surf values may be used. For example, a substrate with a<br><br><br>
Parker Print Surf smoothness of about 9 microns may be used. Parker Print Surf<br>
smoothness is determined in accordance with TAPPI standard T 555 om-99.<br>
[0039] FIG. 1 illustrates an apparatus 10 useful in practicing certain embodiments of<br>
the invention. A substrate 12 is subjected to treatment on one surface thereof with<br>
crosslinkable polymer coating 14 to form a layer of polymer coating 16 on substrate<br>
12. While the polymer coating is still wet, an optional crosslinking solution 18 may<br>
be applied to the layer of polymer coating 16 thereby forming a cross linked polymer<br>
coating 20 on substrate 12. The polymer coating 20 is typically at least partially<br>
crosslinked. The polymer coating is still in a wet state before being brought into<br>
contact with hot polished drum 22 by pressing the web 12 against the drum surface<br>
with a press roll 24. Heat from the drum surface causes boiling within the wet<br>
polymer coating, so that voids form in the polymer under the surface. The<br>
crosslinking solution causes the polymer coating to crosslink and gel into a<br>
substantially continuous layer or film. Typically, the resulting film will exhibit<br>
improved strength over the base sheet. The polymer treated sheet may not be fully<br>
dried so it may be conveyed through a secondary heater 26. Any type of secondary<br>
heating device can be used that is capable of drying the treated sheet without<br>
adversely affecting the properties of the sheet. The treated sheet emerges from<br>
secondary heaters 26 as a polymer film treated substrate 28 characterized by improved<br>
flatness and smoothness. Optionally, additional coating processes 30 (and other<br>
processes such as coating, gloss calendering, etc) may be used to form a coated<br>
product 32.<br>
[0040] As shown in FIG. 1, the web wraps a substantial portion of hot polished<br>
drum 22. The amount of wrap may depend on operating conditions such as web<br>
speed, moisture content of the polymer film forming composition 20, temperature of<br>
the drum, and other process factors. It is possible that a small amount of contact time<br>
with hot polished drum 22 may be sufficient. Besides providing the substrate in web<br>
form, it may also be provided in sheet form.<br>
[0041] The crosslinkable polymer coating and the optional crosslinking solution<br>
may be applied by any number of techniques, such as dip-coating, rod coating, doctor<br>
blade coating, gravure roll coating, reverse roll coating, metered size press, smooth<br>
roll coating, extrusion coating, curtain coating, spray coating and the like. The<br><br><br>
crosslinkable polymer coating and crosslinking solutions may be applied by the same<br>
coating technique or different methods may be used for each.<br>
[0042] One embodiment in accordance with the present invention is based on the<br>
coagulation or gelling that occurs between polyvinyl alcohol and borax. In<br>
accordance with this type of system polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) is an example of a<br>
crosslinkable polymer and a borax solution is an example of a corresponding<br>
crosslinker. Once the PVOH solution 14 is applied, at approximately 25% solids and<br>
coverage of about 5 g/m2 dry, the crosslinker solution 16 is applied at a rate and<br>
solution solids to give a borax coverage of at least about 0.1 g/m2 dry. This wet,<br>
crosslinked polymer film 20 is then brought into contact with a hot polished drum 22<br>
by pressing the web 12 against the drum surface with a press roll 24. The drum<br>
surface temperature is at least about 150°C, or in accordance with certain<br>
embodiments, at least about 190°C so that the coating can be dried and release from<br>
the drum surface. The contact time of the polymer film to the drum may be in the<br>
range of up to about 3.0 seconds, more particularly between about 0.5 - 2.0 seconds.<br>
This is sufficient time for the polymer film to immobilize and solidify, giving the<br>
surface of the polymer film a flat smooth finish mirroring the surface of the drum.<br>
Immobilizing the polymer film includes at least partially drying the film. The coating<br>
is not necessarily completely dry when it leaves the drum, so additional drying 26<br>
may be needed. The web then continues on through the process and may receive<br>
additional coating layers, for example conventional coatings, prior to being wound up.<br>
The polymer coating may be applied as a single layer or as two or more layers.<br>
Limited experiments also suggest that a polymer film may be immobilized or<br>
solidified with just momentary contact with the heated drum, as may be achieved by<br>
using a press roll 24 to press the web 12 against the hot drum 22, without any<br>
additional wrap of web around the hot drum. However, it is contemplated that some<br>
wrap of the hot drum may be practiced, and that optionally a felt 23 may be used to<br>
help press the web into contact with the hot drum. If a felt 23 is used to help press the<br>
web into contact with the hot drum, then the felt 23 may be carried between the press<br>
roll 24 and the heated drum 22.<br>
[0043] The contact between the polymer film and the hot drum causes boiling to<br>
occur in the polymer film, creating voids or bubbles in the film. Nip conditions<br>
should be adjusted so that boiling may occur. Satisfactory lab results were obtained<br><br>
with a resilient press roll, a 9" wide web, and nip loads between about 2 to about 15<br>
pounds per linear inch. Depending on press roll hardness and the diameters of the hot<br>
drum and press roll, conditions may have to be adjusted.<br>
[0044] Specific examples of crosslinkable polymers useful in certain embodiments<br>
of the present invention include crosslinkable hydrogels. The following crosslinkable<br>
hydrogels are particularly useful: starch, waxy maize, protein, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
casein, gelatin, soybean protein, and alginates. One or more polymers selected from<br>
the above-recited ones can be used. The crosslinkable polymer typically is applied in<br>
solution form and usually as an aqueous solution. The concentration of the polymer<br>
in solution is not particularly limited but can be easily determined by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art. For example, a solution of about 20% starch may be used as described<br>
below. The crosslinkable polymer may be applied to provide a surface coverage (dry<br>
basis) of from about 3 to about 15 gsm (g/m2) more particularly from about 4 to about<br>
8 gsm. In accordance with particular embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
crosslinkable polymer may be used in an amount ranging from about 60% to about<br>
100% by weight of the dry materials.<br>
[0045] Specific examples of crosslinkers include borates, aldehydes, ammonium<br>
salts, calcium compounds and derivatives thereof. The crosslinker if used typically<br>
may be applied in solution form and usually as an aqueous solution. The<br>
concentration of the crosslinker in solution is not particularly limited but can be easily<br>
determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The crosslinker may be applied to<br>
provide a surface coverage (dry basis) of from about 0.1 to about 0.5 gsm more<br>
particularly from about 0.2 to about 0.3 gsm.<br>
[0046] The temperature of the heated surface is in excess of that typically used for<br>
cast coating. The higher temperature should allow for higher run speeds. It is<br>
anticipated that paper or paperboard produced in accordance with certain<br>
embodiments of the present invention may be produced at speeds in the range of<br>
about 750 to 3000 fpm, more particularly from about 1500 to 1800 fpm. Although not<br>
wishing to be bound by theory, the higher temperature and the dwell time are selected<br>
such that the coating composition is heated to its boiling temperature and it appears<br>
that when the coating boils there is an increase in contact area between the coating<br>
and the drum. The increased contact results in a polymer film heated surface that<br>
exhibits improved smoothness and gloss. Furthermore, the treated surface is ink<br><br><br>
receptive. Boiling of the coating as it is being smoothed on the polished drum surface<br>
appears to significantly improve gloss and smoothness of the finished polymer film<br>
treated substrate.<br>
[0047] The polymer coating on the substrate is typically pressed against the heated<br>
surface for a sufficient period of time to allow the coating to boil and then set to a<br>
smooth, glossy finish. In accordance with particular embodiments, the contact time of<br>
the forming polymer film to the drum is within the range of up to about 3.0 seconds,<br>
more particularly up to about 2.0 seconds, and most particularly up to about 0.5<br>
seconds.<br>
[0048] The polymer coating may also include one or more pigments. Examples of<br>
useful pigments include, but are not limited to, kaolin, talc, calcium carbonate,<br>
calcium acetate, titanium dioxide, clay, zinc oxide, alumina, aluminum hydroxide and<br>
synthetic silica such as noncrystalline silica, amorphous silica or finely divided silica<br>
are examples thereof. Organic pigments may also be used.<br>
[0049] The crosslinkable polymer coating and/or the crosslinking solution may<br>
further include one or more release agents. Specific examples of release agents useful<br>
herein include, without limitation, waxes, such as petroleum, vegetable, animal and<br>
synthetic waxes, fatty acid metal soaps, such as metal stearates, long chain alkyl<br>
derivatives, such as fatty esters, fatty amides, fatty amines, fatty acids, and fatty<br>
alcohols, polymers, such as polyolefins, silicone polymers, fluoropolymers, and<br>
natural polymers, fluorinated compounds, such as fluorinated fatty acids and<br>
combinations thereof. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the<br>
amount of release agent to use in a particular application. Typically, the coating may<br>
contain from about 0.3 to 10 percent release agent, more particularly from about 2 to<br>
5 percent by weight. Instead of or in addition to release agent in the coating, release<br>
agent may be sprayed onto the coating surface, or applied to the heated drum surface.<br>
If a non-sticking surface can be provided on the heated drum, whether by a release<br>
agent or other means, then application of a release agent in the coating or onto the<br>
coating surface may not be needed.<br>
[0050] The polymer coating employed in certain embodiments of the present<br>
invention, wherein at least the aforementioned polymer is contained, is generally<br>
prepared in the form of an aqueous composition. An appropriate ratio between those<br><br><br>
ingredients is different depending on the polymer composition, the application<br>
conditions and so on, but it has no particular limitation as far as the treated paper<br>
produced can satisfy the quality required for the intended use thereof. Further, the<br>
polymer coating according to certain embodiments of the present invention can<br>
optionally contain additives, such as a dispersant, a water retaining agent, a thickening<br>
agent, an anti-foaming agent, a preservative, a colorant, a waterproofing agent, a<br>
wetting agent, a drying agent, an initiator, a plasticizer, a fluorescent dye, an<br>
ultraviolet absorbent, a release agent, a lubricant and a cationic polyelectrolyte.<br>
[0051] In accordance with a particular embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
substrate is treated with the polymer coating near a central region of the paper<br>
machine, such as the size press position. Furthermore, the apparatus for applying the<br>
polymer coating to the substrate may be positioned relative to the paper machine so as<br>
to apply the polymer film to either surface of the forming paper web. More than one<br>
apparatus may be employed to apply a polymer film to each side of the forming paper<br>
web.<br>
[0052] These advantages allow the use of lightly calendered paper or paperboard,<br>
thus preserving stiffness while providing good printing properties.<br>
[0053] The base sheet is typically formed from fibers conventionally used for such<br>
purpose and, in accordance with the particular embodiments, includes unbleached or<br>
bleached kraft pulp. The pulp may consist of hardwood or softwoods or a<br>
combination thereof. The basis weight of the cellulose fiber layer may range from<br>
about 30 to about 500 gsm, and more particularly, from about 150 to about 350 gsm.<br>
The base sheet may also contain organic and inorganic fillers, sizing agents, retention<br>
agents, and other auxiliary agents as is known in the art. The final paper product can<br>
contain one or more cellulose-fiber layers, polymer film layers and, in accordance<br>
with certain embodiments, other functional layers.<br>
[0054] The present invention in accordance with certain embodiments, provides one<br>
or two-sided coated paper or paperboard for printing or packaging whose Parker Print<br>
Surf smoothness value after the coating and finishing processes, when measured<br>
according to TAPP1 paper and pulp test method No. 5A, is lower than about 2-3<br>
microns.<br><br><br>
[0055] The paper or paperboard described herein may further be provided with one<br>
or more additional coatings. A top coating containing conventional components may<br>
be provided to improve certain properties of the paper or paperboard. Examples of<br>
such conventional components include pigments, binders, fillers and other special<br>
additives. The top coating, when present, may be applied at much lower coat weights<br>
than conventional coatings and yet provide similar print properties. Accordingly, the<br>
top coating weight may be about 4 to 9 gsm as a single coating layer or about 8 to 18<br>
gsm as two coating layers. By contrast, conventional coated papers typically require<br>
about 10 to 20 gsm as a single coating layer or 18 to 30 gsm as two coating layers to<br>
provide comparable surface properties. The paper or paperboard may also be coated<br>
on the side of the sheet having the non-treated surface.<br>
[0056] Having given the teachings of the present disclosure, it will now be<br>
illustrated by means of specific examples which should not be considered as limiting<br>
the scope of the claims in any way.<br>
[0057] A base sheet having a caliper of about 10 points, a Parker Print Surf (PPS)<br>
value of about 9 microns (10kg pressure with a soft backing) and a Sheffield<br>
smoothness of about 310 can be treated in accordance with certain embodiments of<br>
the present invention to provide a treated sheet having improved smoothness with<br>
only a minimal decrease in caliper. The base sheet may be treated by applying a<br>
PVOH solution at approximately 25% solids to the base sheet to provide a coverage<br>
of about 5 g/m2 dry. Next, the crosslinker solution may be applied at a rate and<br>
solution solids to give a borax coverage of at least about 0.1 g/m2 dry. The wet,<br>
crosslinked polymer film can be brought into contact with a hot polished drum by<br>
pressing the sheet against the drum surface. The drum surface temperature may be at<br>
least about 190°C. The coating would be dried and released from the drum surface.<br>
The contact time of the pblymer film to the drum would typically be in the range of<br>
between about 0.5 - 2.0 seconds. The treated sheet would have a caliper of between<br>
about 9.6 and 10.0 points, a PPS value of about 2.4 to 3.0 and a Sheffield smoothness<br>
of about 140-170.<br>
[0058] In a preferred embodiment, a starch solution may be used as the polymeric<br>
material in the polymer coating.<br><br><br>
[0059] One aspect of the disclosure relates to a paper or paperboard manufacturing<br>
method. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the method includes<br>
applying a polymer coating comprising a crosslinkable hydrogel to a substrate,<br>
applying a crosslinking solution to the polymer coating on the substrate surface<br>
thereby forming at least a partially crosslinked polymer film-forming coating and<br>
bringing the polymer film-forming coating into contact with a heated surface while<br>
the polymer film-forming coating is still in a wet state. The heated surface may be a<br>
hot polished drum having a flat smooth finish. The temperature of the heated surface<br>
typically is within a range of from about 150°C to about 240°C. Higher temperatures<br>
may be used, for example up to about 300°C. The temperature of the heated surface<br>
in accordance with certain embodiments is within a range of from 180°C to about<br>
200°C, and in accordance with certain embodiments is at least about 190°C.<br>
[0060] In accordance with particular embodiments of the invention, the<br>
crosslinkable polymer may be selected from the group consisting of starch, waxy<br>
maize, protein, polyvinyl alcohol, casein, gelatin, soybean protein, and alginates. In<br>
accordance with certain aspects of the present invention, the crosslinkable polymer<br>
may be used in amounts ranging from about 60 to about 100% by weight of the dry<br>
materials.<br>
[0061] In some manifestations, the crosslinker may be a borate or borate derivative<br>
such as borax, sodium tetraborate, boric acid, phenyl boronic acid, or butyl boronic<br>
acid. The crosslinker may be used in amounts ranging from about 1 to about 12%<br>
based on the crosslinkable polymer.<br>
[0062] The present invention is also directed to treated papers produced in<br>
accordance with the method described herein. The treated papers are characterized by<br>
improved smoothness in conjunction with relatively minor increases in density<br>
compared to the original sheet.<br>
[0063] As it is desirable to have the coating in a wet state when it contacts the<br>
heated drum, the coating may be moistened for example by applying water. One<br>
method is to spray water onto the coating before it contacts the hot drum. However,<br>
in certain embodiments, it may also be possible to operate without any additional<br>
moistening.<br><br><br><br>
[0064] In certain embodiments, starch may be used as the soluble polymer. In<br>
certain embodiments, starch-based coatings can be run successfully without a<br>
crosslinker, and good results may be obtained without gelling (also called<br>
coagulating).<br>
[0065] A starch solution containing 2-5% of a release agent was brought into<br>
contact with a heated drum under conditions described above. In certain conditions, if<br>
moistening of the coating is desired, water alone may be used as the spray and yield a<br>
good reproduction of the polished surface. If the coating solids are low enough, the<br>
process works without a moistening water spray. A 20% solids starch coating was<br>
applied to the web and brought into contact with a heated drum, and gave good<br>
reproduction.<br>
[0066] Starch coatings were also tested having 25% and 30% solids. Both of these<br>
coatings released from the drum without any sticking, but without good surface<br>
reproduction. The 25% solids coating gave moderate reproduction, but the 30%<br>
solids coating was not very smooth. It appears that a certain amount of water present<br>
at the surface may help to propagate boiling throughout the entire coating. Below a<br>
certain amount of surface water, localized surface areas may still have sufficient<br>
boiling to give good reproduction of the drum surface, but other surface areas do not.<br>
Thus, without moistening of the surface with a water spray, as solids increase above<br>
20%, the percentage of the area that reproduces the smooth drum surface decreases<br>
with increasing coating solids, until at about 30% coating solids, little or no surface<br>
smoothness reproduction is achieved. If sufficient water is sprayed on the surface of<br>
the 30% solids coating before it contacts the heated drum, complete surface<br>
reproduction can be obtained. We would expect this relationship to also be affected<br>
by rawstock absorptivity, coat weight, coating viscosity and process speed. It should<br>
be possible to establish the effects of these parameters by further experiments.<br>
[0067] The examples described above were run with a chrome surface on the heated<br>
drum. The examples described below were run after the drum was resurfaced with a<br>
tungsten carbide coating.' In each of these examples, several "runs" were made to<br>
collect the data. A run consists of the drum being heated to approximately 190°C, the<br>
spray level being set, coating being applied to the web by a metered rod method,<br>
optionally followed by moistening spray (which optionally may contain a cross<br>
linking agent), and then by the web being brought into contact with the drum at 35<br><br><br>
fpm. The drum temperature during a run varied between 180°C and 190°C. During a<br>
run, the only variable that was changed was the coating weight applied by the<br>
metering rod. Changes in coating type, coating solids, or spray level were made in<br>
different experimental runs on the equipment. Coat weight was measured by<br>
differential weight and is reported as bone-dry. Some of experiments were run with<br>
cross linker in the coating itself, for example when a material such as starch was used,<br>
which does not strongly cross link.<br>
[0068] Example 1<br>
[0069] A minimally pressed base sheet with a basis weight of 111 lb/3000 ft2 was<br>
used as a substrate on which to apply and treat simple coating compositions. The first<br>
coating was 95% by dry weight CELVOL 203S polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) and 5%<br>
Emtal 50 VCS, a triglyceride used as a release agent. The coating solids were 20% by<br>
weight. The coating was applied by a metering rod. The Table is a list of samples and<br>
test conditions. Sample 1.1 was made by spraying the coating with a crosslinking<br>
solution containing 3% by weight borax and 1% by weight of a sulfonated castor oil<br>
as a release agent. The spraying rate was 48 milliliters per minute. The sample<br>
replicated the drum well and released from the drum without sticking. Significant<br>
improvements in smoothness were obtained with minimal loss of caliper. For sample<br>
1.2, the conditions were the same except that no borax was used in the spray solution.<br>
Without the borax to crosslink the polyvinyl alcohol, the coating did not release from<br>
the surface, and part of the film remained on the drum surface. This experiment<br>
clearly showed the benefit of crosslinking the polyvinyl alcohol.<br><br><br><br>
[0070] In another run, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was substituted for the<br>
polyvinyl alcohol to compare polymer performance. The carboxymethyl cellulose<br>
was FINFIXX 30, which could only be run at 7% solids due to coating viscosity. The<br>
coating was formulated with 95% polymer and 5% Emtal. Samples 1.3 and 1.4 are<br>
two different coat weights sprayed with 48 ml/min of borax spray. The coating<br>
replicated the drum surface well and released completely from the drum. Smoothness<br>
was improved with minimal loss of caliper, but smoothness was not as good as for<br>
polyvinyl alcohol. For the run that produced Sample 1.5, no borax was used in the<br>
spray. The coating replicated the drum surface well and released completely from the<br>
drum. Smoothness was improved by removing the borax. This showed that a non-<br>
crosslinked coating could replicate and release from the drum, which indicates that<br>
materials other than crosslinkable materials can be used in this process.<br>
[0071] Example 2<br>
[0072] A minimally pressed base sheet having a basis weight of 1111b/3000 ft2 was<br>
used as a substrate on which to apply and treat simple coating compositions. The first<br>
coating was 95% by dry weight CLEER-COTE 625 starch (a viscosity modified waxy<br>
corn starch) and 5% Emtal 50 VCS, a triglyceride used as a release agent. The<br>
coating solids were 20% by weight. The coating was applied by a metering rod.<br>
Sample 2.1 was made by spraying the coating with a crosslinking solution containing<br>
3% by weight borax and 1% by weight of a sulfonated castor oil as a release agent.<br>
The spraying rate was 46,milliliters per minute. The sample replicated the drum well<br>
and released from the drum without sticking. Significant improvements in<br>
smoothness were obtained with minimal loss of caliper. Samples 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5<br>
were made with different coat weights of the same coating, but the spray did not<br>
contain borax. All samples replicated the surface well and released completely from<br>
the drum. Samples 2.6 and 2.7 were run without any spray at all. The samples<br>
replicated the surface well and completely released. Smoothness values were not<br>
quite as good, but samples still had significantly improved smoothness with minimal<br>
reduction in caliper. This demonstrates that the process can work without any<br>
moistening spray.<br>
[0073] Example 3<br><br>
[0074] This experiment was a continuation of Example 2 exploring the effect of<br>
coating solids. Samples 3.1 and 3.2 were run at 23% coating solids without any<br>
moistening spray. Good replication and release were obtained. For samples 3.3 and<br>
3.4, coating solids were increased to 25.7%, again applied with no moistening spray.<br>
Complete release was obtained, but incomplete replication of the surface was<br>
achieved. Based on visual inspection, only about 90-95% of the surface replicated the<br>
drum. For samples 3.5 and 3.6, this same 25.7% solids coating was run and a<br>
moistening spray of 48ml/min was applied. The surface replication was complete and<br>
the smoothness values were greatly improved. For Samples 3.7 through 3.12. a 30%<br>
solids coating was used. When no moistening spray was used (3.7), complete release<br>
was achieved, but only a small percentage of the surface was replicated. When 48<br>
ml/min of moistening spray was used (3.8), the replication was greatly improved, but<br>
the surface was still mottled with areas of poor replication. When the moistening<br>
spray was increased to 98 ml/min (3.9, 3.10, 3.11 &amp; 3.12), the replication was<br>
complete and smoothness was greatly improved with minimal reduction in caliper.<br>
Next, the coating solids were lowered. At 17.5% coating solids (3.13, 3.14) with no<br>
moistening spray applied, good release and complete replication were obtained. At<br>
10% solids (3.15) with no moistening spray applied, the low coating viscosity led to<br>
reduced coat weight and increased coating absorption into the sheet, so poor<br>
replication occurred.<br>
[0075] Samples of the smooth products, produced using starch as the polymer<br>
coating, at 20% solids, were top coated with a conventional pigmented clay coating<br>
(about two-thirds clay and one third carbonate, with a latex binder, applied in a single<br>
coat of approximately 10 lb/ 3000ft2) applied over the smooth polymer layer. These<br>
samples then were cross sectioned to examine the morphology of the coating layer.<br>
Cross sectioning was done by freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen, then cracking<br>
the samples in two (freeze fracturing). The cracked edges of the samples (e.g., the<br>
cross sections) were then viewed under a microscope.<br>
[0076] Micrographs revealed that voids exist in the polymer coating layer, as shown<br>
in FIGs. 2 through 9, which include measurement bars to indicate their scale. For<br>
FIGs. 2-5, the microscope magnification was 1000, and the measurement bars are 20<br>
microns long. In FIG. 2 as an example, the structure as shown includes a paperboard<br>
substrate 110. The substrate thickness generally extends below the area of the<br><br><br>
micrograph. Because of the freeze fracturing process, the substrate 110 as shown in<br>
the micrographs is sometimes separated or partly separated from polymer layer 120.<br>
Therefore the upper boundary of substrate 110 may be only approximately shown by<br>
the bracketed distance denoting the substrate.<br>
[0077] In these samples, the polymer coating layer 120 had been applied onto<br>
substrate 110, and dried against a heated drum, as described previously. Then a top<br>
coating 130 was applied and dried. The term "polymer coating" is used here to<br>
describe that layer applied as described above, then contacted while wet against a<br>
heated drum. The term "top coating" is used to describe the outer layer, which was<br>
applied as one layer. Obviously the "top coating" could be applied in more than layer<br>
and could be of coating materials other than those used here.<br>
[0078] Voids 121 are evident in the polymer coating layer 120, as seen in FIGs. 2-9.<br>
FIG. 2 for example shows several voids 121 in polymer coating layer 120, with the<br>
voids appearing to be approximately 5 to 20 microns in lateral dimension. It is<br>
assumed that their size going "into" the fractured sample is in approximately the same<br>
range. The voids typically appear to be somewhat "flattened" in the "vertical"<br>
direction, that is, going into the sample thickness. The voids also appear to have<br>
"walls" that are relatively smooth, and generally thin. These thin walls are most<br>
apparent as seen between adjacent voids. Where a void wall is adjacent to the top<br>
coating 130, its thickness may be difficult to see but its presence may be deduced by<br>
the smooth lower contour of the top coating 130 adjacent to the void.<br>
[0079] FIG. 3 is an example micrograph showing several voids 121 in the polymer<br>
coating layer. The voids appear to extend over an area equivalent to more than half<br>
the coated surface area. The polymer coating layer is not well defined in this<br>
micrograph.<br>
[0080] FIG. 4 is an example micrograph showing several voids 121 in polymer<br>
coating layer 120. The walls of the voids appear to be relatively thin, as evidenced by<br>
a somewhat translucent appearance in the walls of two of the voids.<br>
[0081] For FIGs. 5-9, the microscope magnification was 500 and the measurement<br>
bars are 50 microns long. FIG. 5 shows several voids 121 in polymer layer 120, with<br>
individual measurement bars showing dimensions of the selected voids, for example,<br>
moving generally from left to right, measurements of 10.5 microns in vertical<br><br><br>
distance, 36 microns in lateral distance, 10.6 microns in vertical distance, and 36.3<br>
microns in lateral distance. Again the voids appear to extend over an area equivalent<br>
approximately half the coated surface area.<br>
[0082] FIG. 6 shows another sample with similar measurement bars, for example,<br>
moving generally from left to right, measurements of 8.66 microns in vertical<br>
distance, 32.1 microns in lateral distance, 11.8 microns in vertical distance, and 22.7<br>
microns in lateral distance. Measurements such as these in FIGs. 5 and 6 were<br>
collected for use in the graph discussed later in FIG. 17.<br>
[0083] FIG. 7 shows voids 121 in polymer layer 120, including several showing a<br>
generally flattened aspect. The voids appear to extend over an area equivalent to<br>
nearly all the coated surface area. FIG. 8 shows another sample with similar<br>
widespread voids 121. The wall areas of several voids are visible. FIG. 9 shows yet<br>
another sample where the voids 121appear to extend over an area equivalent to nearly<br>
all the coated surface area.<br>
[0084] Other samples of the smooth products, produced using starch as the polymer<br>
coating, at 20% solids, were not top-coated. These samples were cross sectioned to<br>
examine the morphology of the coating layer. Cross sectioning was done by freezing<br>
the samples in liquid nitrogen, then cracking the samples in two (freeze fracturing).<br>
The cracked edges of the samples (e.g., the cross sections) were then viewed under a<br>
microscope as shown in FIGs. 10 to 12, which include measurement bars to indicate<br>
their scale. The microscope magnification was 1000, and the measurement bars are<br>
20 microns long. FIG. 10 shows the polymer layer 120, which contains voids 121 and<br>
has a very smooth outer surface. The polymer layer is on paperboard substrate 110,<br>
and one of the cellulose fibers 112 is denoted. The substrate thickness generally<br>
extends below the area of the micrograph.<br>
[0085] FIGs. 11 and 12 show additional micrographs of samples that were polymer<br>
coated but not top-coated. Again the smoothness of the polymer layer 120 is evident,<br>
as are the underlying voids 121. The walls of the voids often coincide with the<br>
surface of the polymer coating.<br>
[0086] FIG. 13 (at 200x magnification) and FIG. 14 (at 500x magnification) show<br>
the surface of samples as seen under a scanning electron microscope. These samples<br>
were not given top coating 130. The larger string-like structures 112 are cellulose<br><br><br>
fibers of the substrate 110. The smaller cell-like structures 122 that appear as a fine<br>
network or mesh are individual voids in polymer layer 120. The polymer layer here<br>
appears essentially transparent, except for the walls of the voids.<br>
[0087] FIGs. 15 and 16 show the surface of samples as seen under a backscatter<br>
scanning electron microscope. These samples were not given top coating 130. The<br>
larger string-like structures 112 are cellulose fibers of the substrate 110. The smaller<br>
cell-like structures 122 that appear as a fine network or mesh are the walls of<br>
individual voids in polymer layer 120. The polymer layer here appears essentially<br>
transparent, except for the walls of the voids. The voids appear to be distributed over<br>
the entire surface.<br>
[0088] FIG. 17 is a graph showing the distribution of void sizes based on<br>
approximately 90 measurements each of void width (lateral dimension) and height<br>
(vertical dimension in the micrographs). The measurements show an average void<br>
width (measured in the direction parallel to the thickness of the sample) of about 19<br>
microns, with a standard deviation of about 9 microns. The measurements show an<br>
average void height (measured in the direction going "into" the sample thickness) of<br>
about 10 microns, with a standard deviation of about 4 microns.<br>
[0089] These void dimensions appear to be representative of the samples studied<br>
here. However, they are not meant to be limiting as changes in materials or<br>
processing conditions might give other dimensions.<br>
[0090] It is hypothesized that steam bubbles create these voids while the coating is<br>
in contact with the heated drum, and that the bubbles may provide a force to help keep<br>
the coating in contact with the drum. The resulting voids typically help bridge the gap<br>
between an otherwise rough substrate layer 110, and the smooth surface of the heated<br>
drum. Thus the dried polymer coating has a smooth replicated surface, which is<br>
smoother than the substrate layer 110. It appears that many or most of the voids<br>
remain intact when top coating 130 is applied. Therefore the top coating may end up<br>
smoother because of the relatively smooth underlying polymer layer 120. This is seen<br>
as an advantage achieved by the invention. Besides the hypothesized influence of the<br>
voids on help creating a smooth replicated surface, the voids may also contribute to a<br>
lower density in the product.<br><br><br>
[0091] The conditions in the nip between press roll 24 and hot drum 22 may<br>
influence whether voids form in the polymer coating. Depending on press roll<br>
hardness, and the diameters of the press roll and hot drum, it may be necessary to<br>
adjust the nip loading (for example, the PLI loading on the nip) in order to achieve<br>
boiling in the nip which creates the voids.<br>
[0092] The polymer-coated paper or paperboard created by this process may be<br>
used wherever a smooth substrate or finished product is desired. The polymer-coated<br>
paper or paperboard may be used as-is (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 10-16), or it may be<br>
used as a substrate for additional coatings or other treatments to be applied (for<br>
example the top coating 130 shown in FIGs. 2-9, or other coatings) thereon.<br>
Additional finishing materials or processes may be applied to the polymer-coated<br>
paper or paperboard, with or without additional coatings. For example, one or more<br>
additional coatings may be applied, as is typical with base coating, top coating, and<br>
triple coating of conventional paper or paperboard substrates. Calendering processes<br>
may be applied, before or after optional additional coating. For example one or more<br>
additional coatings may be applied, followed by a gloss calendering step.<br>
[0093] Methods of making and using polymer-coated material in accordance with<br>
the invention should be readily apparent from the mere description of the material and<br>
process as provided herein. No further discussion or illustration of such material or<br>
methods, therefore, is deemed necessary.<br>
[0094] While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described and<br>
illustrated, it should be apparent that many modifications to the embodiments and<br>
implementations of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the invention. Although the preferred embodiments illustrated herein have<br>
been described in connection with a paper or paperboard substrate, these<br>
embodiments may easily be implemented in accordance with the invention in other<br>
structures, including without limitation textiles, non-woven fabrics, fibrous materials,<br>
polylactic acid substrates, and porous films.<br>
[0095] It is to be understood therefore that the invention is not limited to the<br>
