Technical Field This invention relates to compounds having activity to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and to a medical method of treatment. More particularly, this invention concerns reverse hydroxamate-containing compounds which inhibit matrix metalloproteinases, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, and methods of inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases in a mammal.<br>
Background of the Invention The matrix metalloproteinases (MMP's) are a class of extracellular enzymes including collagenase, stromelysin, and gelatinase which are believed to be involved in the tissue destruction which accompanies a large number of disease states varying from arthritis to cancer.<br>
Typical connective tissue cells are embedded within an extracellular matrix of high molecular weight proteins and glycoproteins. In healthy tissue, there is a continual and delicately-balanced series of processes which include cell division, matrix synthesis and matrix degradation. In certain pathological conditions, an imbalance of these three processes can lead to improper tissue restructuring. In arthritis, for example, joint mobility can be lost when there is improper remodeling of load-bearing joint cartilage. With cancer, lack of coordination of cell division and the two processes of matrix synthesis and degradation may lead to conversion of transformed cells to invasive phenotypes in which increased matrix turnover permits tumor cells to penetrate basement membranes surrounding capillaries which, in turn, may lead to subsequent metastasis.<br>
There has been heightened interest in discovering therapeutic agents which bind to and inhibit MMP's. The discovery of new therapeutic agents possessing this activity will lead to new drugs having a novel mechanism of action for combating disease states involving tissue degenerative processes including, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteopenias such as osteoporosis, periodontitis, gingivitis, corneal, epidermal or gastric ulceration, and tumor growth and metastasis or invasion.<br>
This invention discloses a series of MMP inhibitors having a unique combination of potency, pharmacokinetics, and fewer side effects.<br>

Determination of Biological Activity The efficacy of the compounds of the invention as matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors was determined by measuring inhibition as outlined below for Gelatinase A, a member of this family of enzymes. Recombinant active gelatinase-A (MMP-2) is purchased from Oncogene Research. The enzyme is assayed by its cleavage of a fluorescent substrate in 15C volume in a microfluor plate as described in Science 1990, 247,954-958. Upon cleavage of the substrate, the fluorescence of the EDANS group is increased 30-fold, and this increase is monitored using a f-max (Molecular Devices) fluorescent plate reader (ex: 335 nm; em: 485 nm). The rates of cleavage of the substrate by gelatinase-A in the presence or absence of inhibitors are measured in a 40 min assay at ambient temperature. Stock solutions of the compounds in DMSO are prepared, and these solutions are diluted into the assay buffer (50 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4, with 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM CaCb), which is also used for dilution of the enzyme and substrate. The potencies of the compounds [IC50], shown below in Table 1, are calculated by plotting the logit function of the percent inhibition data relative to control vs. the logarithm of the inhibitor concentrations.<br><br>
