				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of signal processing and, more<br>
particularly to integrated direct broadcast satellite systems, NTSC signal<br>
reception and display systems, and internet set top boxes.<br>
2. Description of the related art<br>
Today, there are many choices and/or sources of audio/video<br>
programming available to consumers for display on a television. These<br>
various sources of programming can bring many channels of entertainment<br>
and information into the home such as movies, sitcoms, news, sporting<br>
events, pay-per-view events, and the like. Such sources of programming<br>
range from over-the-air or off-air television signals receivable on an antenna,<br>
to direct broadcast satellite, to the internet.<br>
However, at present, each programming source requires a different<br>
system or receiver to decode and process the incoming audio/video signals.<br>
In the case of a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) system wherein a digital data<br>
stream is transmitted from a satellite to a receiving dish, a DBS receiver is<br>
required to decode and process the incoming digital data stream. In the case<br>
of internet viewing, a separate computer system is required to receive and<br>
process the pages or content of the internet. Set-top internet receivers/boxes<br>
now integrate NTSC television processing capabilities receivable from several<br>
sources such as antennas and what is known as cable TV from a cable<br>
system.<br>
Also, program guide or channel guide features are provided by each<br>
program source, such as DBS systems and off-air (NTSC) broadcasting.<br>
Program or channel guide information is transmitted in the digital data stream<br>
in the case of a DBS system, while such program information is transmitted as<br>
part of the VBI (Vertical Blanking Interval) of an analog NTSC television signal.<br>
More specifically, in the case of the digital data stream of a DBS, program<br>
guide information is transmitted along with the digital video signals as part of<br>
the PSI (program specific information) table within a standard encoded<br>
transport stream, such as MPEG-2. Additionally, each system requires separate<br>
control, tuning, and program guide compiling for viewing.<br>
WO 98/56172 describes a system which has a program guide for providing<br>
television program information. The program guide incorporates an Internet icon for<br>
allowing a user to surf the internet by selecting the icon. In addition, D2 GB 2 323<br>
489 A provides an electronic program guide for providing program information for<br>
both television programs and internet programs. Neither of these documents,<br>
however, describes a system for providing, for example, an integrated program guide<br>
for television program information which combines program information sources from<br>
both an NTSC receiver and a DBS receiver. In addition, neither of the documents<br>
address how to integrate two stand-alone receivers into an integrated system, as in<br>
the case of a user having already purchased a DBS receiver or an internet receiver<br>
but lacking the other capability."<br>
What is needed is an integrated system for DBS, internet, and NTSC television<br>
programming.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed towards an integrated DBS and internet<br>
receiver system wherein a single program guide encompassing DBS program<br>
channels and network program channels are compiled.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a DBS system is<br>
controllable through a linked internet receiver wherein seamless tuning of all program<br>
channels is accomplished through the internet receiver. As well, any broad-band<br>
data, including user selectable internet links received through DBS channels, may be<br>
used to retrieve and view internet data.<br>
In one form, in a DBS/internet receiver system, the DBS system having a DBS<br>
receiver adapted to receive DBS program information including program guide<br>
information, the internet receiver having an internet receiver adapted to receive<br>
network program information and data including program guide information and<br>
internet data, there is provided a method for forming a combined DBS/network<br>
program guide. The method includes, providing the DBS receiver with a wide-band<br>
data/communications input/output port, providing the network receiver with a wide-<br>
band data/communications input/output port, linking the wide-band<br>
data/communications input/output port of the DBS receiver with the wide-band<br>
data/communications input/output port of the internet receiver, providing the internet<br>
receiver with the program guide information received by the DBS receiver through the<br>
wide-band data/communications ports, and integrating the DBS program guide<br>
information with the network program guide information on the internet receiver to<br>
obtain a combined DBS/network program guide for viewing on a display device.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is the ability to have an enhanced or<br>
super program guide that combines the program guide of a DBS system with the<br>
program guide of an NTSC system.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is the ability to remotely<br>
control a DBS receiver with an internet/NTSC signal receiver.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is the ability to have<br>
enhanced DBS digital broadcasting using supplemental information carried by<br>
the DBS digital data stream.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The above-mentioned other features and advantages of this invention,<br>
and the manner of attaining them, will become more apparent and the<br>
invention will be better understood by reference to the following description of<br>
an embodiment of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic view of a connection scheme between a DBS<br>
unit, an Internet receiver unit, and a display device in accordance with the<br>
present invention; and<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram of an interconnection scheme between the<br>
DBS unit and the Internet receiver unit of Fig. 1.<br>
The exemplification set out herein illustrates a preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, in one form, and such exemplification is not to be construed as<br>
limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings and, more particularly Fig. 1, there is<br>
shown audio/video system 8 comprising direct broadcast satellite (DBS) unit<br>
10, such as a DIRECTV® unit, internet unit 32, and display device 48 that are<br>
interconnected and function as described below.<br>
DBS unit 10 receives signals from DBS dish or antenna 12 via cable 14<br>
that plugs into input port 16. Input port 16 is coupled internally to appropriate<br>
circuitry as is known in the art in order to decode and/or process an incoming<br>
DBS data stream (an all digital data stream) typically transmitted from a<br>
satellite (not shown). DBS dish 12 includes feed hom 13 which receives the<br>
DBS data stream reflected by dish 12 as is known in the art. DBS unit 10 also<br>
includes telephone port 18 that is in communication with a telephone system<br>
via telephone line 20 connected to telephone jack 22 through which the DBS<br>
unit may communicate with a dial-up system. DBS unit 10 also includes a<br>
video output jack or port 24, a left audio output jack or port 26, and a right<br>
audio output jack or port 28 collectively marked "A/V OUT". Video output port<br>
24 may be an S-video port or a composite video port. As well, but not shown,<br>
there may be a second video output port. In this case, the first video output<br>
port could be the S-video output port while the second video output port could<br>
be the composite video output port, or vice versa. The A/V OUT ports are<br>
coupled internally to appropriate circuitry as is known in the art. Additionally,<br>
in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, DBS unit 10 also<br>
includes high-speed or wide-band input/output port 30 that may utilize a DB15<br>
type connector. Wide-band input/output port 30 is coupled internally to<br>
appropriate circuitry as is known in the art and is used to send and receive<br>
serial data for control information and for parallel digital output of data<br>
transmitted from the satellite. The wide-band data" link between DBS unit 10<br>
and internet unit 32 is used as a data bus. While not shown, it should be<br>
understood that DBS unit 10 also includes other typical features and/or<br>
components.<br>
Internet receiver unit 32 is an integrated set-top box/internet receiver<br>
otherwise known as an NTSC receiving internet receiver with integrated<br>
software, such as a WebTV® "Plus" unit. Internet unit 32 is adapted to<br>
receive, process and/or decode internet data via telephone lines, cable lines,<br>
or other sources, as well as receive, process and/or decode television (NTSC<br>
audio/video) signals from a cable system, airwaves Or other source. The<br>
television signals may include Extended Data Service (XDS) information such<br>
as closed captioning and V-chip (ratings) data for the various programs as well<br>
any other data or audio/video information. An NTSC audio/video signal is<br>
receivable from either antenna 38 or a cable system through cable jack 40 via<br>
cable 36 coupled to input port or jack 34. Input port 34 is coupled internally to<br>
appropriate circuitry that processes the incoming NTSC signal in a known<br>
manner for eventual displaying on display device 48. Internet unit 32 is<br>
coupled to a telephone phone system via telephone input/output port 42,<br>
telephone line 46 and telephone jack 44 which is then coupled in the usual<br>
manner with the telephone system. Internet unit 32 receives digital data from<br>
the Internet via the telephone system. Of course, other means of receiving<br>
Internet data may be used such as a cable TV system via an internal cable<br>
modem (not shown) or other source.<br>
Additionally, internet unit 32 includes video input jack or port 50, left<br>
audio input jack or port 52, and right audio input jack or port 54, collectively<br>
marked "SLR" (S-video, Left, Right). The SLR inputs are coupled internally to<br>
appropriate circuitry as is known in the art. Video input port 50 may be an S-<br>
video input port or composite video input port that is coupled to video output<br>
port 24 of DBS unit 10 via communication line or cable 60 in order to receive<br>
the video output from DBS unit 10. As well, but not shown, there may be a<br>
second video input port. In this case, the first video input port could be the S-<br>
video output port while the second video output port could be the composite<br>
video output port, or vice versa. Internet unit 32 also has left audio input port<br>
or jack 52 that is in communication with left audio output port 26 of DSS unit<br>
10 via line 62 in order to receive left channel audio from DSS unit 10, and right<br>
audio input port or jack 54 that is in communication with right audio output port<br>
28 of DSS unit 10 via line 64 in order to receive right channel audio from DSS<br>
unit 10. In addition to the above input ports, internet unit 32 has high-speed or<br>
wide-band input/output data port 56 which is in communication with high-<br>
speed input/output data port 30 of DSS unit 10 via data/communication cable<br>
66. Wide-band input/output data port 56 may utilize a DB-15 type connector.<br>
Such interface between DSS unit 10 and internet unit 32 provides a serial<br>
control bus between DSS unit 10 and internet unit 32 as well as a parallel<br>
digital output from DSS unit 10 to internet unit 32 for data transmitted from the<br>
satellite and received by DSS unit 10 through cable 14 (DSS data stream).<br>
High-speed input/output data port 56 is coupled internally to appropriate<br>
circuitry within internet unit 32 as is known in the art.<br>
Internet unit 32 also includes video output port or jack 70, left audio<br>
output port or jack 72, right audio output port or jack 74, and RF output port or<br>
jack 68 all for providing various audio and video signals to display unit 48 and<br>
collectively labeled "SLR". Again, video output port 70 may be an S-video<br>
output port or a composite video output port. As well, but not shown, internet<br>
unit 32 may include a second video output port. In this case, the first video<br>
output port would support S-video, while the second video output port would<br>
support composite video, or vice versa.<br>
Display unit 48, such as a television or monitor, is coupled to internet<br>
unit 32 in order to receive the various audio and video signals therefrom.<br>
Specifically, display unit 48 includes RF input port or jack 76 which is in<br>
communication with RF output port 68 of internet unit 32 via RF cable 78, such<br>
as coaxial cable. The RF connection between internet unit 32 and display<br>
device 48 allows the RF output from internet unit 32 to be received by display<br>
unit 48 on channel 3 or 4 via an RF modulator (not shown), providing an RF<br>
"pass-through" capability when internet unit 32 is in a standby mode. This<br>
functionality is similar to the functioning of a coupled VCR and television.<br>
Display unit 48 also includes video input port or jack 80, to receive S-video or<br>
composite video, which is in communication with video output port 70 of<br>
internet unit 32. While not shown, display device 48 may include a second<br>
video input. In the case of a second video input, one video input would be an<br>
S-video input while the other video input would be a composite video input.<br>
Further, display unit 48 includes left audio input port or jack 82 which is in<br>
communication with left audio output port 72 of internet unit 32 via line 88 in<br>
order to receive left channel audio, and right audio input port or jack 84 which<br>
is in communication with right audio output port 74 of internet unit 32 via line<br>
90 in order to receive right channel audio. S-video, composite video and left<br>
and right audio outputs of internet unit 32 and inputs of display device 48 may<br>
be used to provide a higher quality audio/video experience than the RF feed.<br>
While not shown, it should be understood that display device 48 may also<br>
include various audio and video outputs for connection to other audio/video<br>
devices.<br>
With reference now to Fig. 2, there is shown interconnect or interface<br>
diagram 92 for internet unit 32 that allows internet unit 32 to communicate with<br>
and/or receive data from DBS unit 10 over a wide-band data link. It should be<br>
understood that internet unit 32 may be any type of data processing box,<br>
wherein the data processing box accepts analog and digital data signals, such<br>
as NTSC television signals and MPEG-2 data over the internet. Wide-band<br>
port 56 (labeled as a DB15 connector) provides a communication interface for<br>
LOW SPEED data as well as HIGH SPEED data to and from DSS unit 10.<br>
Low speed serial control data from DSS unit 10 is received into port 56<br>
and is routed on line 120 into first inverter buffer 98 then second inverter<br>
buffer 100 before it is sent along RXD (receive data) line and into the RXD<br>
(receive data) serial data input of system interface IC 102. As shown, system<br>
interface IC 102 includes one UART (Universal Asynchronous<br>
Receive/Transmit). System interface IC may be a SOLO IC which is a<br>
graphics special ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) of a WebTV®<br>
type internet/set-top box unit and is in communication with the microprocessor<br>
(not shown) of internet unit 32. Other devices capable of receiving serial data<br>
may also be used. Inverter buffers 98 and 100 are preferably Schmitt Trigger<br>
buffers. Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) circuitry 96 is provided before inverter<br>
buffer 98 for electrostatic protection. Low speed serial control data from<br>
internet unit 32 is sent from TXD (transmit data) output of UART 102 into first<br>
inverter buffer 104 and then into second inverter buffer 106. Second inverter<br>
buffer 106 is coupled via line 122 with wide-band port 56 such that the low<br>
speed serial control data is sent to DSS unit 10. Electrostatic Discharge<br>
(ESD) circuitry 108 is preferably provided between inverter buffer 106 and<br>
wide-band port 56 for electrostatic protection. The low speed serial control<br>
functionality is provided with a full duplex serial capability operating at a<br>
maximum of 9600 baud, and provides a means of control between DBS unit<br>
10 and internet unit 32.<br>
The HIGH SPEED DATA path (labeled as such in Fig. 2) is an 8 bit<br>
wide data bus and includes Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection circuit<br>
112. High speed data is received from DSS unit 10 into FIFO (First In First<br>
Out) memory 114 via the HIGH SPEED DATA PATH while FIFO memory 114<br>
is strobed or clocked with a clock signal from DBS unit 10 via CLK path from<br>
port 56. The clock signal is conditioned with Schmitt Trigger inverter buffer<br>
118 and also includes Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection circuit 116. In<br>
operation, when FIFO memory 114 is half full, FIFO memory 114 provides an<br>
interrupt signal to system interface IC 102 via line HALF_FULLn (also the<br>
command label) that is coupled to INTERRUPT. The interrupt signal allows<br>
system interface IC 102 to receive 128 bytes of data (one half of FIFO<br>
memory 114"s 256 byte capacity) via DATA BUS line and into RIOD (Receive<br>
IO Data). The data word length is 8 bits with one control bit, hence the<br>
nomenclature "7:0". As well, system interface IC 102 includes chip select<br>
outputs OEn and CSn that are received by FIFO memory 114 via lines OEn<br>
and CSn respectively. In this manner, internet unit 32 and DSS unit 10 can<br>
provide each other with control data and transmit and receive high and low<br>
speed data.<br>
With the above connections described with respect to the various<br>
incoming digital (both the DBS data stream and the internet data stream) and<br>
NTSC signals, and the interconnections of DBS unit 10, internet unit 32, and<br>
display device 48, functionality in accordance with an aspect of the present<br>
invention will now be discussed.<br>
With DBS unit 10 coupled to internet unit 32, internet unit 32 is capable<br>
of controlling DBS unit 10. In this manner, DBS unit 10-becomes a slave<br>
peripheraUo internet unit 32. Channel tuning for both internet unit 32 and<br>
DBS unit 10 can be accomplished seamlessly through internet unit 32 only,<br>
such that both NTSC and DBS audio/video sources may be displayed on<br>
display device 48. As an example, a user may, via a remote control (not<br>
shown), select channel 13 (or any other "off air" channel which go to channel<br>
69, or a cable channel) for viewing on display unit 48 through internet unit 32,<br>
and internet unit 32 would tune its own internal tuner to the correct channel as<br>
received by either antenna 38 or cable 40, and then provide that output to<br>
display device 48. If the user selects channel 206 on the remote, internet unit<br>
32 would recognize channel 206 as a DBS channel (over and above the off-air<br>
and cable channels), and thus utilize the communication capability to cause<br>
DBS unit 10 to tune to channel 206 and provide the audio/video output to<br>
internet unit 32 that would in turn provide the audio/video output to display<br>
device 48. Utilizing various commands, internet unit 32 can query DBS unit 10<br>
and cause it to turn on an tune to a particular channel. Because of the<br>
interconnectivity between DBS unit 10 and internet unit 32 as described<br>
above, there is no need for IR "blaster" cabling and/or configuration routines.<br>
Another capability of system 8 due to its interconnectivity is the ability to<br>
provide Electronic Program Guide (EPG) integration of the DBS EPG from<br>
DBS unit 10 and the NTSC EPG from internet unit 32. Electronic Program<br>
Guide (EPG) information is part of the DBS digital data stream received by<br>
dish 12 and is for the various DBS channels receivable by DBS unit 10. EPG<br>
information for the various NTSC channels is also receivable in the VBI<br>
(Vertical Blanking Interval) of certain NTSC signals. Internet unit may request<br>
this information from DBS unit 10 and seamless integrate the DBS EPG<br>
information with the NTSC EPG information. Channel selection is then<br>
accomplished through internet unit 32 as described above. DBS information<br>
may also be contained in the NTSC VBI of a channel, or through a dial-up<br>
database via telephone line 46.<br>
DBS bandwidth may also be used to provide other information services<br>
such as news summaries, sports scores, stock quotes, and the like. This<br>
information may be overlaid on any DBS or NTSC program by internet unit 32.<br>
Additionally, DBS bandwidth (data stream) may be used as a<br>
replacement to dial-up internet access by providing a series of web (internet)<br>
pages thus freeing up the telephone line. A DBS "Web channel" either as a<br>
separate broadcast DBS channel or through the DBS EPG would be<br>
selectable by the user. Instead of the Web channel containing a video and/or<br>
audio transport, the Web channel would contain only a data transport which<br>
would be relayed directly to internet unit 32. The user would then have the<br>
option of viewing a received web page or store it in a cache for later viewing.<br>
The Web channel would utilize the DBS bandwidth by delivering such data on<br>
a single transponder. Large quantities of data may be transmitted on a single<br>
transponder making efficient use of available bandwidth or smaller quantities<br>
of data may be transmitted on all transponders for constant availability.<br>
Further, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, wide-<br>
band data may be integrated with the DBS data stream as data payload. The<br>
wide-band data payload would be associated with at least one and preferably<br>
each DBS program and could include internet or internet type/linked data.<br>
i<br>
When a DBS program is selected and viewed, the wide-band data payload<br>
that is received by DBS unit 10, is transmitted out of wide-band data port 30 of<br>
DBS unit 10 into wide band data port 56 for receipt by internet unit 32.<br>
Internet data is thus transmitted from the satellite, received on current DBS<br>
systems, and processed by the internet receiver. This allows the wide-band<br>
data payload content to be overlayed with the satellite"s video signal, as well<br>
as other video manipulations. In one form, by providing the wide-band data as<br>
a multicast internet protocol (such as Intercast or ATVEF), internet unit 32<br>
would interpret this information/data and use it in conjunction with the received<br>
audio/video signal. It should be understood that the ATVEF specification<br>
includes HTML extensions to size/scale a video window, position same on the<br>
screen, and overly supplemental text and graphics (also formatted in HTML)<br>
around or over the video signal. The DBS data stream can thus deliver<br>
supplemental interactive data, including internet data, as another transport for<br>
a given program (in addition to the audio, video, and closed-captioning<br>
transports that may already be available). Any interactive internet content is<br>
deliverable over and receivable by existing DBS systems. Since the DBS<br>
system is coupled to the internet receiver by the wide-band data link, the<br>
functionality of DBS system is expanded to include interactive content<br>
delivered by the broadcasting satellite without modification to the existing DBS<br>
unit.<br>
DBS unit 10 and internet unit 32 may also be combined into one unit<br>
able to receive a DBS data stream, an NTSC data stream, and be coupled to<br>
the various I/O devices/lines as described above. As well, display device 48<br>
may incorporate all of the above. Such a combined unit (containing all the<br>
features and functions of internet unit 32 and DBS unit 10) could utilize the<br>
same data stream and deliver the same functionality.<br>
The DBS data stream can also carry programs that may be executable<br>
on Internet unit 32. As an example, a binary image may be sent such as an<br>
operating system (OS) or application. The code is resident on internet unit 32<br>
or "native", meaning a binary image compiled to run on the hardware of<br>
internet unit 32. Additionally, Java applications may be sent in the DBS data<br>
stream and executed on internet unit 32, with internet unit 32 having a Java<br>
Virtual Machine (JVM). Java programs run on any hardware platform because<br>
they are interpreted by the JVM, rather than compiled for a specific hardware<br>
architecture.<br>
As well, URLs (Universal Resource Locators) may be received using Extended<br>
Data Services (XDS) as part of the EIA-746 specification which then may be used by<br>
the browser of internet unit 32 to display the web site according to the URL by<br>
delivering the URL through the DBS data stream or through a dial-up connection.<br>
Since DBS transmits closed captioning and XDS through a second data stream<br>
(there is no VBI or Vertical Blanking Interval in the digital domain) the URLs are<br>
processed directly, rather than waiting for the DBS box to re-encode them back into<br>
the VBI of the video output.<br>
While this invention has been described as having a preferred design, this<br>
application is intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention<br>
using its general principles. For example, the wide-band data link may be replaced<br>
with any data port having the capability of transmitting the defined information.<br>
Further, this invention may be utilized with any digital set-top box, such as a digital<br>
cable box or MMDS, which provides for the simultaneous delivery of data. Further,<br>
this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as<br>
come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains<br>
and which fall within the limits of the appended claims.<br>
