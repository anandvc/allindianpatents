				<td>CONTINUOUS CASTING OF MOLTEN STEEL FOR SHEET METAL<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to continuous casting of molten steel to be formed as a sheet<br>
metal, and more particularly to a refractory material for use in the continuous casting.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In late years, the need for strict quality control of steel products has become increasingly<br>
prominent. Under these circumstances, in the continuous casting of aluminum-deoxidized<br>
steel (hereinafter referred to as "aluminum-killed steel") to be formed as high-quality steel, such<br>
as sheet metal, a good deal of effort has been made to prevent alumina from being attached onto<br>
a casting nozzle for pouring molten steel from a tundish into a mold.<br>
The alumina attached onto the casting nozzle will be combinedly accumulated, and formed<br>
as a large-size impurity. Then, the alumina will be mixed in molten steel flow, and<br>
incorporated into slabs as a large-size inclusion to cause defect in slabs or deterioration in<br>
quality thereof.<br>
As one of measures against this problem, there has been known a method comprising<br>
injecting argon gas from the inner surface of a casting nozzle toward molten steel to physically<br>
prevent the attachment of alumina. However, if an excessive amount of argon gas is injected,<br>
resulting gas bubbles will be incorporated into slabs to cause the formation of pinholes or defect.<br>
Thus, this method is not exactly a sufficient measure due to the restriction in the allowable<br>
injection amount of argon gas.<br>
There has also been known a method intended to provide an anti-alumina-buildup function<br>
to a refractory material itself. This method is directed to prevent the buildup of alumina by<br>
preparing a refractory brick containing CaO and causing the reaction between CaO and alumina<br>
attached to the brick to form a low-melting-point compound. For example, Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-Open Publication No. 11-506393 discloses a casting nozzle using a refractory martial<br>
comprising in combination graphite, and dolomite clinker having a primary component<br>
consisting of CaO and MgO.<br>
In order to obtain the anti-alumina-buildup function, this material can be applied to the<br>
surface of an inner hole of a submerged nozzle for casting of aluminum-killed steel. In this<br>
case, while the amount of alumina to be attached on the surface of the inner hole of the<br>
submerged nozzle is actually reduced, a large-size inclusion is often detected from slabs to be<br>
formed as a sheet metal. The inclusion causes occurrence of flaws in a rolling process of the<br>
slabs. In particular, the inclusion has a serious impact on slabs to be formed as a thin sheet<br>
metal.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a refractory material for use in a<br>
continuous casting nozzle, which contains CaO • MgO-based clinker having CaO as a mineral<br>
phase having an anti-alumina-buildup effect, so as to allow the amount of a large-size inclusion<br>
in slabs during casting of aluminum-killed steel to be drastically reduced.<br>
Through various researches on inclusions detected from slabs in case of using a continuous<br>
casting nozzle made of a refractory material containing CaO • MgO-based clinker having an<br>
anti-alumina-buildup effect, the inventors found that large-size inclusions having a diameter of<br>
50 µm or more comprise magnesia as a primary component. The inventors assumed that the<br>
magnesia as the inclusions was originated from the refractory material containing CaO •<br>
MgO-based clinker.<br>
FIG. 1 shows the distribution state of MgO in CaO • MgO-based clinker by an electron<br>
micrograph. As seen in this electron micrograph, MgO grains are independently dispersed<br>
over the CaO • MgO-based clinker in the form of small grains, because no compound is formed<br>
between CaO and MgO.<br>
And FIG. 2 shows the relationship between the mean diameter of MgO paticles in the<br>
CaO • MgO-based clinker and the size of MgO inclusion in a cast aluminum-killed slab obtained<br>
by using CaO • MgO-based clinker as shown in the electron micrograph of FIG. 1. As seen in<br>
FIG. 2, it is proved that there is a positive correlation between the size of the MgO grain<br>
particles in the clinker and the size of the inclusions, and the size of the MgO grain particles is<br>
analogous to the size of the inclusions.<br>
When a refractory material containing CaO • MgO-based clinker is used in a refractory<br>
component of a continuous casting apparatus for casting aluminum^cilled steel, at the surface of<br>
the refractory to be in contact with molten steel, alumina dispersed over the steel reacts with<br>
CaO in the CaO • MgO-based clinker to form an Al2O3 • CaO-based low-melting-point compound,<br>
and the low-melting-point compound is then spilled off from the surface of the refractory<br>
component with the flow of the molten steel.<br>
The Al2O3 • CaO-based compound released from the surface of the refractory component is<br>
readily dispersed over the molten steel, and less apt to be formed as a large-size inclusion.<br>
Thus, an adverse affect on the quality of slabs can be minimized.<br>
Even if the Al2O3 • CaO-based compound has a large size, it will be relatively harmless<br>
because it is relatively soft, and can be thinly drawn out in a rolling process.<br>
In contrast, MgO in the clinker is apt to flow in the molten steel while maintaining its<br>
original grain size, due to its low reactivity as compared to CaO. Further, MgO has a high<br>
melting point and high hardness. If a large-size MgO grain is mixed in slabs, it will cause<br>
flaws in the rolling process or deterioration in quality of the slabs. In addition, it is often the<br>
case that the diameter of MgO crystal grains in the clinker is equal to that of MgO-based<br>
inclusions in the slabs as shown in FIG. 2, because MgO in the clinker is apt to flow in the<br>
molten steel while maintaining its original grain size. Thus, in view of reducing the amount of<br>
large-size inclusions in slabs, it is essential to miniaturize MgO crystal grains in the CaO •<br>
MgO-based clinker.<br>
Based on the above knowledge, in order to solve the problem of the MgO-based inclusions<br>
caused by the CaO • MgO-based clinker-containing refractory material for use in a continuous<br>
casting apparatus for molten steel to be formed as a sheet metal, the present invention provides a<br>
refractory material containing 20 mass% or more of CaO • MgO-based clinker. In the<br>
refractory material, 60% or more of MgO grains have a diameter of 50 µm or less. The<br>
refractory material is used at least at a portion of a continuous casting apparatus to be in contact<br>
with molten steel.<br>
Generally, in view of sheet metal products, it is desired to minimize inclusions having a<br>
diameter of 50 µm or more, and to reduce the diameter of MgO grains in CaO • MgO-based<br>
clinker as much as possible. In a practical sense, if 60% or more of MgO grains in the clinker<br>
have a diameter of 50 µm or less, the casting of aluminum-killed steel for sheet metal can be<br>
performed without any problem. Thus, the CaO • MgO-based clinker is prepared to allow 60%<br>
or more of MgO grains therein to have a diameter of 50 µm or less. In particular, steel for<br>
beverage tin cans is required to be free of inclusion having a diameter of 50 µm or more. Thus,<br>
in a casting process of molten steel to be formed as beverage tin cans, it is desired to use clinker<br>
containing MgO crystal grains having a smaller mean diameter, for example, of 20 µm or less.<br>
The diameter of MgO grain in the CaO • MgO-based clinker herein is determined by separating<br>
MgO crystal grains and CaO grains in an electron micrograph of the clinker from each other<br>
using an image analysis apparatus, converting the area of each of the MgO grains into a circular<br>
area, and measuring the diameter of the circular area.<br>
According to preparation methods, CaO • MgO-based clinker is classified into three types:<br>
synthetic dolomite clinker, natural dolomite clinker and electro-fused CaO • MgO-based clinker.<br>
The synthetic dolomite clinker is prepared by burning mixed particles of Ca (OH)2 and Mg<br>
(OH)2 at a high temperature. The natural dolomite clinker is prepared by burning dolomite as a<br>
natural product at a high temperature. The electro-fused CaO • MgO-based clinker is prepared<br>
by arc-melting a material containing CaO components and MgO components, and<br>
cooling/solidifying the arc-melted material. The diameter of MgO crystal grains in the<br>
synthetic CaO • MgO-based clinker can be changed by controlling the particle size of a starting<br>
material. Specifically, Mg (OH)2 particles in the starting material can be arranged to have a<br>
small particle size and enhanced dispersibility to reduce the diameter of MgO crystal grains in<br>
the clinker.<br>
The diameter of MgO grains in the natural dolomite clinker is varied depending on native<br>
dolomite minerals. Thus, the natural dolomite clinker can be prepared by using one native<br>
dolomite mineral providing a desired diameter of MgO grains. The diameter of MgO crystal<br>
grains in the electro-fused CaO • MgO-based clinker can be controlled by adjusting the cooling<br>
rate in the solidification process.<br>
In dolomite clinker prepared by using natural dolomite, the chemical components of CaO<br>
and MgO have an approximately constant mass ratio of about 60 : 40 (CaO : MgO). By<br>
contrast, in the synthetic dolomite clinker and the electro-fused CaO • MgO-based clinker, the<br>
mass ratio of CaO : MgO can be freely changed. In this case, if the MgO component is<br>
excessively increased, MgO crystal grains will be combined with each other to form an<br>
undesirably enlarged MgO crystal grain. Thus, the content of MgO is preferably set to be less<br>
than 50 mass %.<br>
The refractory material containing 20 mass% or more of CaO • MgO-based clinker may be<br>
prepared by adding an organic binder to CaO • MgO-based clinker, uniformly kneading the<br>
compound to form a green body, and burning the green body at about 1600°C, or by adding<br>
phenol resin and 10 to 40% of graphite to CaO • MgO-based clinker, uniformly kneading the<br>
compound to form a green body, and burning the green body at about 1000°C in a reduction<br>
atmosphere. Through this process, the refractory material can have an anti-alumina-buildup<br>
function.<br>
For example, the refractory material without containing graphite is suitable for use in a<br>
refractory component of a continuous casting apparatus which is applied with relatively low<br>
thermal shock in use, such as an upper nozzle, a sliding nozzle, a lower nozzle or a stopper head.<br>
The refractory material containing graphite is suitable for use in a refractory component of a<br>
continuous casting apparatus which is applied with relatively high thermal shock in use, such as<br>
a submerged nozzle, a long nozzle, or a long stopper. However, the use of such refractory<br>
materials is not limited to the above examples. What is important is to appropriately adjust the<br>
amount of graphite depending on use conditions.<br>
In view of the anti-alumina-buildup effect, in addition to 20 mass% or more of CaO •<br>
MgO-based clinker including CaO, the refractory material of the present invention may contain<br>
carbon or another clinker, such as CaO clinker, ZrO2 clinker, ZrO2 • CaO clinker and/or MgO<br>
clinker. When the refractory material is used in a portion of a continuous casting apparatus<br>
having a heavy fusion damage in use, the MgO grain size should be adequately adjusted to<br>
prevent deterioration in quality of slabs due to outflow of the clinker into molten steel. Further,<br>
while a slight amount of Fe2O3, SiO2, Al2O3 and/or ZrO2 may be added to the clinker, it is<br>
desired to limit the amount of the additive within 10 mass%, because an excessive amount of the<br>
additive is likely to cause deterioration in corrosion resistance and/or anti-alumina-buildup<br>
function.<br>
While the CaO • MgO-based refractory material can be applied to any refractory<br>
component for use in a continuous casting apparatus, such as a submerged nozzle, an upper<br>
nozzle, a lower nozzle, a sliding nozzle, a long nozzle, a stopper head, and a long stopper, it may<br>
be used in a given portion of such a refractory component to bring out an intended effect therein.<br>
In particular, the refractory material may be limitedly used in a portion of the refractory<br>
component to which a large amount of alumina is to be attached. For example, when the<br>
refractory material is used in one of the above nozzles, instead of making the entire nozzle of the<br>
refractory material, only the surface of the inner hole of the nozzle to be in contact with molten<br>
steel may be made of the refractory material to bring out an intended function sufficiently.<br>
In the case of using the refractory material only in the surface of the inner hole of the<br>
nozzle, a green body of the composition according to the present invention may be placed on the<br>
inner surface and simultaneously shaped with the nozzle body or the composition according to<br>
the present invention may be inserted into the innerhole after shaped and baked into a sleeve and<br>
a ring, alternatively.<br>
When the refractory material is used in the stopper head or long stopper, only the outer<br>
surface of the stopper head or long stopper to be in contact with molten steel may be made of<br>
the refractory material.<br>
While the refractory material of the present invention is suitable for continuous casting of<br>
aluminum-killed steel, particularly aluminum-killed steel to be formed as a sheet metal, it may<br>
also be effectively applied to continuous casting of Al-Si killed steel, Al-Ti killed steel or Ti<br>
killed steel.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is an electron micrograph showing the grain structure of CaO • MgO-based clinker.<br>
FIG. 2 is a graph showing the relationship between the mean diameter of MgO grains in<br>
the clinker and the mean diameter of MgO-based inclusions in slabs.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described in connection with<br>
examples.<br>
[EXAMPLE 1]<br>
A plurality of samples different in mean diameter of MgO crystal grains were prepared by<br>
changing the cooling rate of electro-fused CaO • MgO-based clinker having a chemical<br>
composition of 58 mass% of CaO and 41 mass% of MgO. Table 1 shows the respective mean<br>
diameters (µm) of the prepared clinkers.<br>
The samples A to E are clinkers for Inventive Examples. For example, in the sample E,<br>
60% or more of MgO crystal grains in the clinker have a diameter of 50 µm or less. The<br>
samples F to I are clinkers for Comparative Examples. In the samples F to I, 60% or more of<br>
MgO crystal grains in each of the clinkers have a diameter of greater than 50 µm.<br>
Table 2 shows the compounding rate of each of compounds prepared by adding graphite<br>
and phenol resin to the respective clinkers in Table 1, and the frequency index of the occurrence<br>
of flaws during a rolling process in each of the compounds.<br>
Each of submerged nozzles serving as test pieces was prepared by forming a green body<br>
which has a powder line portion using a zirconia/graphite material and a nozzle body with an<br>
inner hole using each of the compounds in Table 2, through CIP forming at a forming pressure<br>
of 1000 kg/cm2, and burning the green body at a maximum temperature of 1000 °C in a<br>
reduction atmosphere.<br>
Each of the submerged nozzles was used for continuous casting of aluminum-killed steel,<br>
and the quality of obtained slabs was checked. The casting was carried out under the<br>
conditions of a ladle volume: 250 ton, a TD volume: 45 ton, and a draw speed of slabs: 1.0 to<br>
1.3 m/min.<br>
The obtained slabs were milled to a sheet metal having a thickness of 2 mm, and the<br>
frequency of occurrence of flaws due to MgO-based inclusions was checked. The frequency of<br>
occurrence was indexed by defining the frequency of Inventive Example 1 as 100. The index<br>
having a smaller numeral indicates better quality of slabs. This test result shows that the<br>
quality of slabs is drastically improved in Inventive Examples where 60% or more of MgO<br>
crystal grains in the clinker have a diameter of 50 µm or less, as compared to Comparative<br>
Examples where the mean diameter is greater than 50 µm.<br>
[EXAMPLE 2]<br>
Table 3 shows the compounding rate of each of compounds prepared by uniformly<br>
kneading the respective CaO • MgO-based clinkers A to I in Table 1 and polypropylene added<br>
thereto, and the frequency index of the occurrence of flaws during a rolling process in each of<br>
the compounds. Each of upper nozzles serving as test pieces was prepared by forming a green<br>
body using each of the compounds in Table 3, through press forming at a forming pressure of<br>
1200 kg/cm2, and burning the green body at a temperature of 1600 °C. Each of the upper<br>
nozzles was used for continuous casting of aluminum-killed steel under the same conditions as<br>
those in EXAMPLE 1, and the quality of obtained slabs was checked. This test result shows<br>
that the quality of slabs is drastically improved in Inventive Examples where 60% or more of<br>
MgO crystal grains in the clinker have a diameter of 50 µm or less.<br>
As mentioned above, the refractory material and the method for use in continuous casting<br>
of molten steel for sheet metal can reduce the mean diameter of MgO grains as inclusions in<br>
slabs obtained through the continuous casting. Thus, the frequency of occurrence of flaws in<br>
the milled sheet metal can be reduced to achieve a higher quality level of sheet metal products<br>
and the reduction of production cost.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>

invention can be used in continuous casting of molten steel for sheet metal, particularly<br>
