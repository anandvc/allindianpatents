				<td>DUAL CURE COMPOSITIONS, METHODS OF CURING THEREOF AND<br>
ARTICLES THEREFROM<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The invention relates generally to dual cure compositions, methods of curing, and resulting articles.<br>
Formation of thick sections by curing of thermoset resins (sometimes referred to hereinafter as curable monomers) has been generally problematic. Most traditional thermally cured reactive formulations have short work-life and long cure time. On the other hand, photocured formulations have long work-life and are capable of rapid cure, but curing is limited by the penetration depth of UV light, especially in materials with high levels of fillers which absorb or block UV light, such as in thick section composites, composite sandwich structures, and carbon fiber composites, thus resulting in uncured or incompletely cured portions. Curing thick carbon fiber composites has been demonstrated with e-beam technology. However, e-beam uses a high energy source which requires high cost capital investment.<br>
The problems described have been addressed by the use of compositions comprising monomers that are cured by one or more energy sources. The cured compositions are typically derived from monomers having ethylenic units, isocyanate units, ester units, or the like, or combinations thereof. Curing of some of the compositions results in evolution of gases, which may become entrapped in the composition thus compromising some of the properties of the product. Also, the curing methods result in inefficient energy usage. Alternatively, thick sections have been formed by joining multiple procured panels or plies. But this results in bond lines. Thus, there is a need in the art to develop novel curable compositions and more efficient and cost-effective methods to fabricate thick sections, structures and articles.<br>

monoesters, phosphoric esters, polyacrylic acids or their copolymers, polyurethanes or acrylate copolymers, which are available commercially under the tradename MODAFLOWÂ® or DISPERLONÂ®; adhesion promoters such as tricyclodecane-dimethanol; leveling agents; film-forming auxiliaries such as cellulose derivatives; flame retardants; sag control agents such as ureas, modified ureas and/or silicas, rheology control additives, such as those known from the patents W094/22968, EP0276501A1, EP0249201A1, and WO97/12945; crosslinked polymeric microparticles, as disclosed for example in EP0008127A1; inorganic phyllosilicates such as aluminum magnesium silicates, sodium magnesium phyllosilicates or sodium magnesium fluorine lithium phyllosilicates of the montmorillonite type; silicas such as AEROSILSÂ® silicas; or synthetic polymers comprising ionic and/or associative groups such as polyvinyl alcohol, poly(meth)acrylamide, poly(meth)acrylic acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone, styrene-maleic anhydride or ethylene-maleic anhydride copolymers or their derivatives or hydrophobically modified ethoxylated urethanes or polyacrylates; flatting agents such as magnesium stearate; and/or precursors of organically modified ceramic materials such as hydrolyzable organometallic compounds, especially of silicon and aluminum. Mixtures of such additives are also suitable in particular embodiments.<br>
The method of preparing the composition of the invention may generally be carried out using conventional mixing of the above-described components in appropriate mixing equipment, such as, but not limited to, stirred tanks, dissolvers, homogenizers, pressure release homogenizers, inline dissolvers, toothed-wheel dispersers, microfluidizers, stirred mills, extruders, or like equipment. It will be appreciated that appropriate measures to minimize premature curing are typically employed. When compositions in embodiments of the invention are employed to prepare composite or laminate articles, the compositions may be combined with core material, layer materials, or the like using known methods. In a particular embodiment such articles are made using a resin infusion method.<br>
In a typical embodiment the composition is available as a viscous gel or a liquid. The composition may be at least partially cured by exposing to radiation having a<br>
wavelength in the range of from about 200 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers, for example. Suitable sources of such radiation may include, but are not limited to, mercury arcs, carbon arcs, low pressure mercury arcs, medium pressure mercury arcs, medium pressure mercury lamps, high pressure mercury lamps, swirling flow plasma arcs, ultraviolet light emitting diodes, ultraviolet light emitting lasers, and the like. In particular embodiments the composition may advantageously be at least partially cured or completely cured in the bulk state without the use of any external solvents or diluents.<br>
Upon exposure to radiation, the photoinitiator dissociates to give rise to free radicals or acid, which then initiate the curing of the photocurable monomer. The photocuring step is an exothermic reaction and involves evolution of heat, which results in an increase in temperature. Depending on the choice of the curable monomer or combinations of curable monomers, and other known factors, the extent of temperature rise may be controlled. The increase in the temperature (sometimes referred to as an exotherm) results in the dissociation of the thermal initiator to give rise to free radicals, or acid, or other species effecting curing. The free radicals or acid generated from the thermal initiator will further initiate curing of the thermally curable monomer, which will generate additional heat through exothermic reaction and continue to propagate the cure through the thickness of the composition. Thus, the composition is cured by thermal curing as well as photocuring methods. Unless the type of curing is specified, the terms "cured", "curing", and "curing step", as used herein, comprise both photocuring and thermal curing steps. This typically results in solidifying or at least partially solidifying of the curable composition. The composition may be partially cured or may be completely cured, to obtain a solid cured composition having sufficient strength for the application being targeted. Partial curing is said to have occurred when one or both of the photocuring or thermal curing steps are at least partially completed.<br>
The time of exposure of the composition to radiation and the intensity of the radiation may vary greatly. In various embodiments the time of exposure to radiation or the intensity of the radiation or both are sufficient to provide an exotherm sufficient to<br>
initiate thermal curing. In particular embodiments the time of exposure is generally in the range of from about 1 second to about 5 hours, more preferably in the range of from about 5 seconds to about 1 hour. These parameters may be readily determined by one skilled in the art. In one embodiment variations in the intensity of radiation and time of exposure of the composition may be employed to control the time taken to initiate thermal curing, giving rise to "cure on demand" compositions.<br>
In some embodiments the composition is exposed to the radiation for a time period just sufficient to provide an exotherm sufficient to initiate thermal curing, following which the radiation source is turned off, and complete curing is achieved by thermal curing. Subsequent to turning off the radiation source, only thermal curing occurs. No other outside energy source is employed to complete the curing of the composition after the radiation source is turned off. In particular embodiments the composition is exposed to the radiation for a time period sufficient to provide an exotherm sufficient to complete the curing of the composition by thermal curing. In other particular embodiments the radiation source is turned off either before or after or at the point at which the exotherm peak is achieved. In particular embodiments the radiation source is turned off before complete curing of the resin is achieved. This results hi significant reduction in energy usage, thus giving rise to a cost effective process.<br>
In other embodiments compositions of the invention can be blended with at least one additional resin formulation, which can be cured thermally such that the exotherm generated from the compositions of the invention upon partial photocuring can be used to initiate the onset of the thermal curing process which then goes to completion without the application of an external heat source and after the radiation source applied for photocuring has been turned off. Illustrative additional resin formulations comprise epoxy resins in the presence of a hardener.<br>
Embodiments of the method described herein have been used advantageously to cure compositions to form thick structures, without the use of any external heat source, such as an oven, an infrared heating lamp, a heating blanket or like heat source, by utilizing the exothermic nature of the photocuring system, and thus inducing thermal initiation and curing in sections where radiation of the photocuring step cannot<br>
penetrate. This method also results in efficient and uniform curing in all portions of the structure being formed. The described method typically results in significant time, energy and cost savings, among other advantages.<br>
In another embodiment the method described herein has been used advantageously to provide sandwich structures comprising a reinforcing filler core sandwiched between composite laminate (sometimes referred to as skin), wherein the skin comprises a dual cure composition of the invention. Typically the core itself is light weight, and the composite sandwich structure overall is a light weight structure with very high bending stiffness. The core material generally has a density less than 80% of the composite skin density and more preferably less than 50% of the composite skin density. Non-limiting examples of the core material comprise wood, honeycomb, foam, slitted foam, and the like. Foam core may be made from thermosets or thermoplastics. Typically the core material is UV opaque. In many embodiments the core material has resin pathways through the core to enable transfer of heat and free radicals to propagate the cure through the full thickness. A representative sandwich structure is shown in Figure 3 wherein resin filled spaces are depicted as vertical lines through the core of the sandwich structure, the vertical lines corresponding to the said resin pathways.<br>
The composition and the methods described may be advantageously used to make shaped components and articles. The method is especially useful to make components and articles having thicknesses greater than about 0.1 millimeters in some embodiments, greater than about 0.5 millimeters in other embodiments, and greater than about 1 centimeter in other embodiments. Illustrative shaped components and articles comprise automotive components such as body panels, truck beds, protective plates, fenders, spoilers, hoods, doors or lamp reflectors; sanitary articles and household implements; components for buildings, both inside and outside such as doors, windows, and furniture; industrial components, including coils, containers, and radiators; and electrical components, including wound articles, such as coils of electric motors; wind rotor blades for wind turbines; aerospace articles, bridge components, marine articles, sporting goods, pipes, missiles, and the like. Preferred<br>
shaped components and articles may also be made of SMC (sheet molded compound) or BMC (bulk molded compound) as the dual cure composition.<br>
The composition and the methods described may be advantageously used in composite repair in aerospace composites, marine composites, automotive composites, composite tanks, composite pipes, and the like. Dual cure resin compositions also provide benefits of rapid cure for in service repair of thick, highly filled composites or sandwich structures using EHS friendly energy sources such as UV. Dual cure resin compositions minimize issues with thermal management issues required with purely thermal cure resins since a separate, external heat source is not needed to initiate cure, and heat is generated within the resin itself.<br>
Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the description herein, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The following examples are included to provide additional guidance to those skilled in the art in practicing the claimed invention. The examples provided are merely representative of the work that contributes to the teaching of the present application. Accordingly, these examples are not intended to limit the invention, as defined in the appended claims, in any manner. In the following examples and comparative examples the curable monomer was DIONÂ® 9800-05 urethane-modified vinyl ester resin obtained from Reichhold Chemical Company, Durham, North Carolina. Bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphine oxide (also referred to hereinafter as "phosphine oxide") was IRGACUREÂ® 819 obtained from Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Tarrytown, New York, USA. 3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate, a cycloaliphatic diepoxide (also referred to hereinafter as UVACUREÂ® 1500), was obtained from Cytec Surface Specialties. Phenyl-p-octyloxyphenyl-iodonium hexafluoroantimonate, (also referred to hereinafter as UVACUREÂ® 1600), was obtained from Cytec Surface Specialties. The epoxy laminating resin was type L135i having an epoxy equivalent of 166-185 obtained from MGS Kunstharzprodukte Gmbh, Stuttgart, Germany. Amine hardener was H134i/H137i with an average amine equivalent of 52 obtained from MGS Kunstharzprodukte Gmbh, Stuttgart, Germany. Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, NOROXÂ® MEKP-9H was obtained from Norac,<br>
Azusa, CA, USA. Cobalt naphthenate, dimethyl aniline, and 2,4-pentanedione were obtained from Aldrich. The glass fiber fabric was obtained from Saertex, Moorsville, NC, USA. Carbon fiber fabric was obtained from Sigmatex, Benicia, CA, USA.<br>
Interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was determined by ASTM D2344. Samples were prepared from 30 centimeter (cm) x 30 cm panels with 24 plies of 1000 grams per square meter (gsm) +/-4S biax glass fabrics via a vacuum infusion process. Test specimen dimensions were length x width x thickness = 10 cm x 1.9 cm x 1.7 cm and the span length (S) was 6.6 cm with a span ratio (S/T) of 4.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A formulation comprising DIONÂ® 9800-05 vinyl ester resin, 1.2% MEKP, 0.2% cobalt naphthenate, 0.1% dimethyl aniline, and 1% IRGACUREÂ® 819 photoinitiator placed between glass plates was cured by exposure to 400W UV-A portable arc lamp for 5 minutes, after which the UV lamp was turned off. A glass laminate was obtained that was 3.2 millimeters (mm) thick.<br>
The resin formulations (abbreviated "Form.") used in additional examples are shown in Table 1. Component amounts are reported in parts by weight.<br>
TABLE 1.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Two glass jars (each 5 centimeters diameter x 4.4 centimeters height) were separately filled with 70 gm of formulation (I) in Table 1. A thermocouple was placed in the center of each glass jar to measure temperature rise with time. After 35 minutes, the radiation source UV-A 400W was turned on to illuminate one of the jars for 15 minutes, after which it was turned off. The temperature increased quickly and reached a peak value of 202Â°C. As a comparative example, the same formulation (I) was allowed to cure in the second jar without any UV radiation. The temperature in the second jar did not begin to increase until 300 minutes and the temperature finally reached 136.6Â°C peak temperature at 330 minutes. Figure 1 shows the temperature profile at the center of the formulation of each jar as determined by the thermocouples. This demonstrated that the formulation and method of the invention can achieve the cure on demand upon UV radiation exposure at any time between time zero and 300 minutes in this example .<br>
EXAMPLE 3 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
A glass laminate with 24 plies of 1000 gsm +/-4S biax fabrics was prepared from a composition comprising formulation (I) via a resin infusion process for 25 minutes<br>
followed by photocuring by exposure to 400W UV-A for 15 minutes, after which the UV lamp was turned off. Figure 2 shows the temperature profile at the center of the formulation as determined by an embedded thermocouple. The center temperature reached the maximum temperature of 67Â°C in 15 minutes after UV light was shut off. The resin fully solidified after debagging in 60 minutes from the start of 15 minute UV curing step to give rise to a 24 ply 15.9 mm thick glass composite panel. The glass composite laminates produced* in'this example had the same interlaminar strength properties as the glass fiber composite laminates produced using formulation (II) with a traditional cure schedule of room temperature cure for 4 hours and followed by thermally postcure at 70Â°C for 10 hours. Hence, the dual cure formulation (I) using an initial UV cure attained the same product properties with significantly reduced cure time and energy.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Carbon Fiber Composite Samples: A carbon fiber composite formed by using a 5 cm x 10 cm carbon fiber fabric (TORAYCAÂ® T700SC-12K-50C, 400 grams) comprising 3 plies formed by hand lay-up and wet laminated with formulation (I). The formulation was cured by exposure to UV radiation from a 400W UV-A lamp for 10 minutes, after which the UV lamp was turned off. The cured thickness was found to be 2.5 mm and was found to have solidified throughout the sample. This example demonstrates the dual cure composition overcomes the limitation of the UV light penetration through carbon fiber composites.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
A carbon fiber composite formed by using a 5 cm x 10 cm carbon fiber fabric (TORAYCAÂ® T700SC-12K-50C, 400 grams) comprising 3 plies formed by hand lay-up and wet laminated with formulation (III) exposure to UV radiation from a 400W UV-A lamp for 10 minutes, after which the UV lamp was turned off. Only the top surface of the composite was cured and tack-free, while the bottom remained a liquid and uncured. This comparative example illustrates the necessity of a thermal initiator<br>
in addition to a photoinitiator to attain thorough cure of carbon fiber composites upon UV exposure.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Foam core wrapped samples: Glass wet laminate (wet hand lay-up laminate of 1000 grams biax glass fabric) that was saturated with formulation (I) was wrapped around a foam core having the dimensions width x length x thickness = 2.5 cm x 11.4 cm x 0.64 cm. This laminate was then cured by exposure to UV-A radiation from a 400W UV-A lamp for 10 minutes, after which the UV lamp was turned off. Ten minutes after shutting off the lamp, the bottom layer of laminate was cured to solid. Cured laminated thickness was found to be 1 mm.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Thick glass laminate: A 5 cm x 7.5 cm wet laminate was prepared from a 1000 grams biax glass fabric saturated with formulation (I). The laminate was then built up to 3.2 cm thick by the hand lay-up method. The laminate was theij cured by exposure to UV-A radiation from a 400W UV-A lamp. After 15 minutes, the UV radiation was shut off. The temperature at the bottom of the laminate (as measured with an IR pyrometer) was found to have increased from 23Â°C to 100Â°C. The laminate block had completely solidified 5 minutes after the UV lamp was shut off.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
A carbon fiber composite formed by using a 5 cm x 10 cm carbon fiber fabric (TORAYCAÂ® T700SC-12K-50C, 400 grams) comprising 10 plies formed by hand lay-up and wet laminated with a resin formulation that was a 50/50 (w/w) blend of formulation (I) and formulation (IV). The composition was cured by exposure to UV radiation from a 400W UV-A lamp for 14 minutes after which time the UV lamp was turned off, and the temperature at the bottom of the laminate had reached 170.9Â°C from 23Â°C indicating significant heat exotherm had been generated due to the curing. The sample was examined 5 minutes after turning off the UV lamp. The composite of 6.35 mm thickness was found to have solidified throughout the sample indicating<br>
'complete curing.   This example demonstrates^ftffiTlfctn free radical and cationic<br>
â€¢â€¢Â»<br>
curing mechanisms are applicable in this invention and can be used in combination for dual cure formulations.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
A thick carbon fiber composite of 2.54 cm was formed by hand lay-up using a 5 cm x 10 cm carbon fiber fabric (TORAYCA* T700SC-12K-50C, 400 grams) and wet laminated with a resin formulation that was a 50/50 (w/w) blend of formulation (I) and formulation (IV). The formulation was cured by exposure to UV radiation from a 400W UV-A lamp for 43 minutes, after which the UV lamp was turned off. The temperature at the bottom of the laminate has reached 182Â°C from 23Â°C indicating significant heat exotherm had been generated due to the curing. The sample was examined 5 minutes after turning off the UV lamp. The thick cured carbon composite of 2.54 cm was found to have solidified throughout the sample. The example demonstrates that a thick carbon fiber composite can be cured via UV exposure using the formulations and method of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
A carbon fiber composite of 6.35 mm formed by hand lay-up using a 5 cm x 10 cm carbon fiber fabric (TORAYCAÂ® T700SC-12K-50C, 400 grams) and wet laminated with a resin formulation that was a 50/50 (w/w) blend of formulation (II) and formulation (IV). The formulation was cured by exposure to UV radiation from a 400W UV-A lamp for 20 minutes, after which time the UV lamp was turned off. The temperature at the bottom of the laminate had reached 192Â°C from 23Â°C indicating significant heat exotherm had been generated due to the curing. The sample was examined 5 minutes after turning off the UV lamp. The cured carbon composite was found to have solidified throughout the sample. This example demonstrates that a cationic UV curing from cycloaliphatic epoxy can provide heat exotherm to decompose the thermal initiator for free radical curing of the vinyl ester resins.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
A carbon fiber composite of 6.35 mm formed by hand lay-up using a 5 cm x 10 cm carbon fiber fabric (TORAYCAÂ® T700SC-12K-50C, 400 grams) and wet laminated with a resin formulation that is a 50/50 (w/w) blend of formulation (I) and formulation (V). The formulation was cured by exposure to UV radiation from a 400W UV-A lamp for 32 minutes, after which time the UV lamp was turned off. The temperature at the bottom of the laminate had reached 140Â°C from 23 Â°C indicating significant heat exotherm has been generated due to the curing. The sample was examined 5 minutes after turning off the UV lamp. The cured carbon composite was found to have solidified throughout the sample. This example demonstrates that the dual cure formulation upon UV exposure can provide heat exotherm to activate the thermal curing of an amine/epoxy resin system.<br>
The examples demonstrate that formulations comprising a combination of a photo initiator and a thermal initiator are capable of forming cured compositions such as, but not limited to, carbon fiber composites and composites with foam core and thick section composites, without separate external application of heat as compared to the comparative example, wherein complete curing could not be achieved in the absence of the thermal initiator and without the separate external application of heat. The examples also demonstrate that the method is applicable to a wide variety of formulations, irrespective of whether the fillers used are UV opaque or UV transparent.<br>
