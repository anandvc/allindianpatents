TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Assay Buffer, Compositions Containing the Same, and Methods of Using the Same<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/318,289, filed September 10, 2001, and U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/363,498, filed March 11,2002, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application relates to compositions for use in assays, particularly in<br>
eiectrochemiluminescent assays, and methods of using the same.<br>
2.  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
At this time, there are a number of commercially available instruments that utilize electrochemiluminescence (ECL) for analytical measurements including drug screening. Species that can be induced to emit ECL (ECL-active species) have been used as ECL labels. Examples of ECL labels include: i) organometallic compounds where the metal is from, for example, the noble metals of group VIII, including Ru-containing and Os-containing organometallic compounds such as the tris-bipyridy-ruthenium (RuBpy) moiety and ii) luminol and related compounds. Species that participate with the ECL label in the ECL process are referred to herein as ECL coreactants. Commonly used coreactants include tertiary amines (e.g., see U.S. Patent No. 5,846,485, herein incorporated by reference), oxalate, and persulfate for ECL from<br><br>
RuBpy and hydrogen peroxide for ECL from luminol (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,240,863). The light generated by ECL labels can be used as a reporter signal in diagnostic procedures (Bard et aL, U.S. Patent No. 5,238,808). For instance, an ECL label can be covalently coupled to a binding agent such as an antibody, nucleic acid probe, receptor or ligand; the participation of the binding reagent in a binding interaction can be monitored by measuring ECL emitted from the ECL label. Alternatively, the ECL signal from an ECL-active compound may be indicative of the chemical environment (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,641,623 which describes ECL assays that monitor the formation or destruction of ECL coreactants). For more background on ECL, EC! labels, ECL assays and instrumentation for conducting ECL assays see U.S. Patents Nos. 5,093,268; 5,147,806; 5,324,457; 5,591,581; 5,597,910; 5,641,623; 5,643,713; 5,679,519; 5,705,402; 5,846,485; 5,866,434; 5,786,141; 5,731,147; 6,066,448; 6,136,268; 5,776,672; 5,308,754; 5,240,863; 6,207,369 and 5,589,136 and Published PCTNos. W099/63347; WOOO/03233; W099/58962; W099/32662; W099/14599; W098/12539; W097/36931 and W098/57154.<br>
Commercially available ECL instruments have demonstrated exceptional performance They have become widely used for reasons including their excellent sensitivity, dynamic range precision, and tolerance of complex sample matrices. The commercially available instrumentation uses flow cell-based designs with permanent reusable flow cells. Recently, E( ! instrumentation has been disclosed that uses reagents immobilized on the electrode used to induce ECL (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,140,045; 6,066,448; 6,090,545; 6,207,369 and Published PCT Application No. W098/12539). Multi-well plates having integrated electrode suitable for such ECL measurements have also been recently disclosed (see, e.g., U.S.<br><br>
Application Nos. 10/185,274 and 10/185,363, entitled "Assay Plates, Reader Systems and Methods for Luminescence Test Measurements", each filed on June 28, 2002 and hereby<br>
incorporated by reference). See also, U.S. Application No.	, (Entitled:<br>
"Methods and Apparatus for Conducting Multiple Measurements on a Sample" by Glezer et al. [Attorney Reference No. 100405-06410]), filed on even date herewith-, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Currently, pH buffers containing inorganic phosphate are employed in many electrochemiluminescence assays. Applicants have discovered that such pH buffers can, in certain assays, interfere with the assay and decrease the performance of the assay.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to find alternative pH assay buffers, compositions containing the same and methods of using the same for use in those assays which are detrimentally effected by pH buffers containing inorganic phosphate. It would also be desirable to find alternative ECL Assay Buffers with improved performance in ECL assays.<br>
3.   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to improved compositions, reagents, kits, systems, system components, and methods for performing assays. More particularly, the invention relates to the use of novel combinations of reagents to provide improved assay performance.<br>
One aspect of the invention relates to improved ECL Assay Buffers that comprise an ECL coreactant and, preferably, a pH buffering agent. The ECL Assay Buffers provide a suitable envirorunent for efficiently inducing ECL labels to emit ECL and for sensitively measuring ECL labels via the measurement of ECL. The ECL Assay Buffers of the invention<br><br>
may optionally comprise additional components including detergents, preservatives, anti-foaming agents, ECL active species, salts, metal ions and/or metal chelating agents. The ECL Assay Buffers of the invention may also include components of a biological assay, which in some cases may be labeled with an ECL label, including binding reagents, enzymes, enzyme substrates, cofactors and/or enzyme inhibitors. The invention also includes assay reagents, compositions, kits, systems and system components that comprise the ECL Assay Buffers of the invention and, optionally, additional assay components. The invention also includes methods for conducting ECL assays using the ECL Assay Buffers of the invention.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of pH buffers which are substantially free of inorganic phosphates. Such buffers, in some applications, have been found to significantly improve the performance of ECL measurements. Such buffers have also been found to be advantageous in certain applications where phosphate has been found to interfere with a chemical, biochemical or biological reaction.<br>
Surprisingly, such reagents provide a number of surprising advantages including improving the performance of assays employing phospho-specific antibodies (i.e., antibodies thai specifically bind with a phospho-peptide, phospho-amino acid and/or phospho-protein). It is believed that these antibodies may have a low affinity for inorganic phosphate and that the elimination of the inorganic phosphate greatly reduces interference between the phosphate of the pH buffer and the phospho-specific antibodies. Accordingly, the invention includes method, reagents, kits and compositions for measuring phospho-peptides, phospho-amino acids or phospho-protein which use buffer compositions that are free or substantially free (e.g., below the levels that interfere with phospho-specific antibodies). Such methods, kits, compositions, and<br><br>
reagents are, preferably, applied to the measurement (most preferably using ECL detection) of protein kinase or phosphorylase activities through the specific measurement of reaction products or substrates.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to compositions and reagents with that give high signal to background ratios in electrochemiluminescence assays. Such improved performance has been achieved through the identification of advantageous combinations of ECL coreactants, pH buffers, detergent and pH and, in particular, through the use of ECL coreactants and/or pH buffers other than TPA and phosphate. These improved formulations are of particular value in non-wash assays and high sensitivity assays. In some embodiments of the invention, the performance of ECL assays is improved even further through optimal combinations of reagent compositions with electrode compositions.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the compositions and reagents of the invention improve the ratio of ECL signal from bound label to ECL signal from free label. This is particularly true in assays involving reagents immobilized on a solid surface such as an electrode. This is important, for example, in solid phase assays not having a wash step (especially in low affinity interaction assays) since the major component of the background signal comes from the labels present in solution.<br>
Yet another advantage of the invention relates to improved sensitivity of assays using the compositions of the invention. More specifically, the ECL Assay Buffers of the invention provide improved sensitivity at low detection levels by reducing the background electrochemiluminescence in the absence of ECL labels. Surprisingly, ECL Assay Buffers comprising pH buffering agents other than phosphate or which are substantially free of inorganic<br><br>
phosphate emit less background luminescence than conventional ECL Assay Buffers comprising inorganic phosphate based pH buffers. This is particularly advantages at low detection levels where increasing the signal to background ratio greatly improves the performance of the assay.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to improved reagent kits comprising the ECL assay buffers, where the reagents include non-phosphate based pH buffering agents, the ECL assay buffers are substantially free of inorganic phosphate and/or the ECL assay buffers employ tertiary amine coreactants other than TPA. In particular, kits containing, in one or more containers, the ECL assay buffer and, preferably also containing one or more other assay components.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to improved methods performed using the present invention, particularly assay methods employing phospho-specific antibodies, low detection limits, immobilized reagents and/or a non-wash formats.<br>
Yet another aspect of the invention relates to improved systems emd apparatus containing the compositions or reagents of the invention and/or improved systems and apparatus adapted to perform the improved methods of the invention.<br>

5.   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention, as well as additional objects, features and advantages thereof, will be understood more fully from the following detailed description of certain preferred embodiments.<br>
An ECL-active species may be referred to as an ECL moiety, ECL label, ECL label compound or ECL label substance, etc. It is within the scope of the invention for these ECL-active species — when utilized in certain of the composition, reagent, kit, method, or system embodiments in accordance with the invention ~ to be linked to other molecules and, in particular, to components of biochemical or biological assays, e.g., an analyte or an analog thereof, a binding partner of the analyte or an analog thereof, a further binding partner of such aforementioned binding partner, or a reactive component capable of binding with the analyte, an analog thereof or a binding partner as mentioned above. The above-mentioned species can also be linked to a combination of one or more binding partners and/or one or more reactive components. In certain enzymatic assays, an ECL-active species may be linked to an enzyme substrate.<br>
It is similarly within the scope of the invention for the aforementioned "composition", hereinafter sometimes an "ECL, composition", or a "system" to contain unstable, metastable and<br><br>
other intermediate species formed in the course of the ECL reaction, such as an ECL moiety in an excited state as aforesaid and the above-mentioned strong reducing agent. Additionally, although the emission of visible light is an advantageous feature of certain embodiments of the invention it is within the scope of the invention for the composition (hereinafter sometimes "ECL composition") or system to emit other types of electromagnetic radiation, such as infrared or ultraviolet light. X-rays, microwaves, etc. Use of the terms "electrochemiluminescence", "electrochemiluminescent", "electrochemiluminesce", "luminescence", "luminescent" and "luminesce" in connection with the present invention does not require that the emission be light, but admits of the emission's being such other forms of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
The present invention relates to ECL assay buffers, assay compositions containing the same, and methods of using the same. As stated above, several disadvantages were discovered when using the phosphate based ECL assay buffer of the prior art. More specifically, it was found during the development of a specific ECL assay for tyrosine kinase activity that the phosphate in a standard formulation of the ECL coreactant TPA (ORIGEN Assay Buffer, IGEN International: 200 mM Phosphate, ---100 mM TPA, pH -7.5) disrupted the binding between an phospho-specific antibody and a phosphorylated substrate. The assay involved i) the kinase-dependent phosphorylation of a peptide immobilized on a carbon electrode; ii) the specific binding of a labeled (with a derivative of Ru(bpy)3) phospho-specific antibody; iii) the addition of the ECL coreactant tripropylamine (TPA) and iv) the detection of ECL from the bound label (see, e.g., Example A below). Applicants discovered that when TPA was added by the addition of ORIGEN Assay Buffer that the measured ECL signal was sharply dependent on the time the binding complex was left exposed to the ORIGEN Assay Buffer (Figure I); the measured signal<br><br>
dropped sharply over time.   In fact, after a 1-hour incubation only a small fraction (-10%) of initial signal was detected. The affinity of the pY20 antibody (Zymed Lab) used in the assay toward the phospho-tyrosine sites that were formed at the surface of the plate during the enzymatic reaction was much greater than toward free phosphate in solution. However, the high concentration of free phosphate in ORIGEN assay buffer (200 mM) is now believed to have caused the dissociation of phospho-tyrosine/pY20 complex, resulting in the signal decaying sharply.<br>
One way around this problem was to have a fixed time between the dispensing of ECL assay buffer and the read step so that the signal decay is calibrated and subtracted. However, this approach is not desirable in high throughput screening applications, where robustness of the assay and flexibility of dispensing protocol are desired.<br>
Thus, a number of different organic pH buffers were tested as alternatives to the conventional phosphate based assay buffer. Many of the conventional biological buffers (including Tricine, HEPES, MOPS, BES - all from Sigma), however, interfered with the ECL generation from TPA and provided only 2-20 % of ECL signal observed with the ORIGEN assay buffer. Applicants, however, discovered a set of buffers that provided ECL signals that were comparable to the signal observed in TPA/phosphate.<br>
Accordingly, applicants have discovered that substitution of the phosphate buffer with a pH buffer which was substantially free of inorganic phosphate can ECL signal comparable to the signal observed in standard ORIGEN assay buffer, without the above-described disadvantages. Preferably, the pH buffer is free of inorganic buffer.<br><br>
Furthermore, applicants have discovered that the phosphate-free ECL assay buffers of the invention are not only beneficial when applied to phosphopeptide binding assays but have other beneficial properties (including lower background signals) that may improve a wide range of ECL assays.<br>
Furthermore, applicants have discovered ECL assay buffer background reducing agents that, when introduced into ECL assay buffers reduce ECL assay buffer background and improve assay performance. These agents are, preferably, also pH buffering agents, most preferably, GlyGly or Tris.<br>
Furthermore, applicants have discovered novel ECL assay buffers that employ ECL coreactants other than the traditional TPA. Surprisingly, a number of coreactants have been discovered to generate ECL signals that are comparable to those generated with TPA. In addition, the use of ECL coreactants other than TPA have been found to improve the performance of non-washed ECL assays through their improved ability, relative to TPA, to discriminate between ECL labels that are held in proximity to an electrode and labels that are free in solution. The use of coreactants other than TPA has additional benefits due to the higher water solubility and lower vapor pressure of some of the new coreactants that have been identified.<br>
Furthermore, applicants have discovered that the presence or absence of detergents can have profound impact on the performance of an ECL assay buffer. Surprisingly, the effect of detergents on ECL can be influenced by the choice of ECL coreactant and working electrode material.   Applicants have developed detergent-containing ECL assay buffers suitable for a variety of different applications and ECL systems.<br><br>
As noted above, one aspect of the invention relates to improved ECL Assay Buffers that comprise an ECL coreactant and, preferably, a pH buffering agent. The ECL Assay Buffers provide a suitable environment for efficiently inducing ECL labels to emit ECL and for sensitively measuring ECL labels via the measurement of ECL. The ECL Assay Buffers of the invention may optionally comprise additional components including detergents, preservatives, anti-foaming agents, ECL active species, salts, metal ions and/or metal chelating agents. The ECL Assay Buffers of the invention may also include components of a biological assay, which in some cases may be labeled with an ECL label, including binding reagents, enzymes, enzyme substrates, cofactors and/or enzyme inhibitors.<br>
Preferably, the ECL assay buffers of the invention are aqueous or substantially aqueous in nature, although it may be desirable in some applications to add organic cosolvents such as DMSO, DMF, methanol, ethanol or other alcohols. In one embodiment of the invention, an ECL assay buffer (or one or more components thereof) is provided in dry form and the user forms the ECL assay buffer solution by addition of the appropriate solvent or matrix (preferably a water or an aqueous medium).<br>
5.1       ECL Coreactants<br>
Most, if not all, current commercial applications of ECL technology involve the measurement of ECL labels (and, in particular, organometallic complexes of ruthenium) in the presence of an ECL assay buffer containing tri-n-propylamine (TPA) as a coreactant and phosphate as a pH buffering agent. These ECL assay buffers have been optimized for and have provided excellent performance in commercial ECL instrumentation that employ, as a solid<br><br>
phase for binding assays, magnetic particles that are collected on the surface of a metal (typically, platinum) electrode.<br>
Applicants have discovered that in some applications, certain fimctionalized tertiary alkylamines can provide performance that is comparable or better to TPA, These fimctionalized tertiary amines are especially usefiil in assays employing carbon-based electrodes (e.g., electrodes comprising carbon particle or carbon nanotubes including composite materials such as plastics and inks) and/or assay reagents (such as binding reagents) that are immobilized onto electrodes. The fimctionalized tertiary alkylamines of the invention, preferably, have one or more of the following properties: i) they are oxidized on carbon-based electrodes in a one electrode oxidation to give an amine radical cation which can subsequently lose a proton to form a radical reductant (Scheme 1); ii) they have an oxidation potential on carbon-based electrodes that is comparable (within 150 mV) or greater than that of Ru(II)(bpy)3; iii) they can be oxidized, most preferably at a pH between 6 and 9, at a potential less than that required to breakdown water at a carbon-based electrode; iv) the energy released by the reaction of the radical reductant with Ru(in)(bpy)3 to produce Ru(II)(bpy)3 is sufficient to produce Ru(II)(bpy)3 in a luminescent excited state and v) the lifetimes of the amine radical cation and/or radical reductant are less than the corresponding TPA-derived species.<br><br><br>
Applicants have discovered that, through the use of the functionalized tertiary alkylamines of the invention, it is possible to improve the selectivity of ECL excitation at an electrode for ECL labels bound to the electrode (as opposed to ECL labels that are free in solution). Without being bound by theory, it is believed that this increased selectivity is due to the lower lifetimes of the amine radical cation and/or radical reductant relative to the corresponding TPA-derived species (thus limiting the participation of the reactive species to ECL reactions that occur proximate to the electrode surface). Preferably, the diffusion distance of the amine radical cation and/or radical reductant (the distance that the species can diffuse during its lifetime) is less than 1μm, more preferably, 
The functionalized tertiary amine coreactants of the invention, preferably have the structure NR^R^R^, wherein R', R^ and R^ are alkyl groups comprising at least 2, preferably 3, carbons and wherein one or more of R', R^ and R^ are functionalized with a hydrophilic ftinctional group, more preferably a charged group, most preferably a negatively charge group. Preferred functional groups include hydroxyl, dialkylamino, sulfate, sulfonate, carboxylate and carboxylic acid ester.<br><br>
Especially preferred coreactants include compounds with the structure (n-Pr)2N(CH2)nR, wherein n is greater than or equal to 2 (more preferably 3), and R is a hydrophilic functional group as defined above, preferably, carboxylate, dialkylamino (more preferably dipropylamino) or most preferably sulfonate.<br><br>
Wherein i) X is -(CH2)- or a heteroatom, preferably -0-, -S-, or -N(R*)-; ii) R and R* are alkyl groups comprising 2 or more (preferably 3 or more) carbons; iii) n and m are each greater than or equal to 1 and are preferably two and iv) R (and, optionally R^) comprise a hydrophilic functional group as defined above. Most preferably, R is -(CH2)n-F\ wherein n is greater than or equal to 3 and F1 is a hydrophilic functional group, preferably, carboxylate or sulfonate. In the cases where X is -N(R )-, R is, most preferably, -(CH2)n-F , wherein n is greater than or equal to 3 and F1 is H, alkyl, or a hydrophilic functional group, most preferably, carboxylate or sulfonate.<br>
Many of the so-called "Good" buffers (Good et al.. Biochemistry, 5, 467 (1966); Good et al., Methods in Enzymol., 24, Part B, 53 (1972) and Ferguson et al., Anal. Biochem., 104, 300 (1980)) have tertiary amines and have been found to act as ECL coreactants on carbon electrodes. These "Good" buffers, generally have tertiary amines having piperazine or morpholine cores. Specific amines that act as ECL coreactants on carbon-based electrodes include: 3"(di-n-propylamino)-propanesulfonic acid; 4-(di-n-propylamino)-butanesulfonic acid;<br><br>

HEPES. POPSO, HEPPSO, EPPSO, PPA and PIPES are especially preferred for their high signals and high discrimination between bound and free labels. TES is also preferred for its high signal.<br>
Additional coreactants include proline, peptides having an N-terminal proline. Preferably, the proline is N-alkylated to form a tertiary amine.<br>
The use of coreactants having hydrophilic functional groups (and, in particular, coreactants that are zwitterionic at neutral pH) has a variety of advantages that are unrelated to their ability to act as ECL coreactants. These species tend to be highly water soluble and to have<br><br>
low vapor pressure. For these reasons it is possible to produce highly concentrated stock solutions that may be diluted as necessary for use. It is also possible prepare dried reagents comprising the coreactants without uncertainty due to loss of coreactant in the vapor phase. Furthermore, when present in dried reagents, these coreactants resolubilize quickly in a minimum of vo lume.<br>
5.2      pH Buffering Agents<br>
Conventional ECL assay buffers optimized for use with commercial ECL instruments have typically comprised TPA in a phosphate-based pH buffer. These formulations have been especially useful for conducting solid phase assays employing magnetic particles that are captured on an electrode. Applicants have discovered that in some applications, other pH buffering agents (including organic pH buffers) can provide performance that is comparable or better to phosphate. These non-phosphate pH buffers (and pH buffer solutions and ECL assay buffers comprising these buffers are especially useful in assays employing carbon-based electrodes (e.g., electrodes comprising carbon particle or carbon nanotubes including composite materials such as plastics and inks) and/or assay reagents (such as binding reagents) that are immobilized onto electrodes. They are also advantageous for use in assays where phosphate is an interferent. Preferably, ECL assay buffers employing the non-phosphate buffers of the invention have less than 15 mM inorganic phosphate, more preferably they have less than 5 mM inorganic phosphate, even more preferably they have less than 1 mM phosphate, even more preferably they are substantially free of inorganic phosphate, most preferably they are free of inorganic phosphate.<br><br>
The pH buffering agent, preferably, is not oxidized under the conditions used to generate ECL and do not interfere with the generation of ECL. Two pH buffers that have proved especially useful are tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) and oligo(glycines), preferably glycyl-glycine (Gly-Gly). Applicants have discovered that ECL assays on carbon-based electrodes using TPA/Tris or TPA/Gly-Gly ECL assay buffers have comparable signals from electrode-bound ECL labels as those observed with conventional TPA/phosphate buffers. The background signals in the absence of ECL labels, however, are considerably less with the Tris and Gly-Gly buffers. This reduction in the background signal leads to an increase in the ratio of signal to background (S/B) and an increase in the sensitivity of ECL assays using the new formulations. Preferably, the ECL assay buffers of the invention have S/B ratios that are 2-fold, more preferably 5-fold and, most preferably, 10-fold better than those obtained using phosphate-based systems.<br>
Without being bound by theory, applicants hypothesize that the improved performance of the Tris and Gly-gly based ECL assay buffers is related to an ability of the buffering agents to act as ECL assay buffer reducing agents by reacting with and destroying tertiary amine oxidation products and/or other reactive oxidized species (e.g., amine radical cations and radical reductants) that are responsible for the assay buffer background. This effect is most pronounced away from the electrode surface where the concentration of these species are lower, so the Tris and Gly-gly components do not affect signals from electrode-bound labels. The Tris and Gly-gly buffers may also improve the observed bound to free ratios, although this effect is less than that observed by switching to non-TPA buffers such as PIPES.<br><br>
Applicants have found that the Tris and Gly-gly buffering systems are also suitable for use with non-TPA coreactants such as PIPES. When using coreactants such as PIPES that may act as pH buffers, it may be possible to omit additional buffering agents.<br>
5.3      Detergents<br>
Applicants have discovered that the presence or absence of detergents can have a surprisingly large effect on ECL signals. The nature of this effect is, unexpectedly, dependent on the electrode. On oxidized electrodes (e.g., plasma-oxidized carbon inks or plasma oxidized polymer composites containing carbon particles or carbon nanotubes) exposed to TPA-containing ECL assay buffers, the effect appears to be relatively small except in the case of phenyl ether containing detergents such as the Triton and Nonidet series of detergents (e.g., Triton X-100). A common method for generating ECL is through the use of a ramp potential. In general a plot of ECL intensity vs. applied potential has the form of a peak. ECL increases as the oxidation potentials of the label and coreactant are approached. On scanning past this potential, the ECL intensity eventually begins to drop as the coreactant is consumed and v^ater oxidation begins to occur. Applicants have observed that the addition of phenyl ether containing detergents leads to the addition of a small ECL peak at higher potential than the main ECL peak. This peak occurs at a potential similar to the an oxidation wave observed with pure Triton X-100, thus leading applicants to speculate that the new peak is associated with the oxidation of the detergent (or an associated impurity) and the participation of the oxidation products in an ECL reaction.<br><br>
The behavior on non-oxidized carbon-based electrodes (and, in particular, untreated carbon ink electrodes) is very different. On these electrodes the ECL signal in the presence of TPA-containing buffers (as well as the S/B ratio) is drastically improved by the addition of detergent. This effect appears to be relatively independent of the nature of the detergent (although non-ionic detergents are preferred due to their relatively weak ability to denature biological systems), but requires the concentration of detergent to be roughly equal to or greater than the critical micellar concentration (cmc) of the detergent. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the addition of detergent to an ECL assay buffer leads to an improvement in assay signal or S/B (preferably induced with a carbon-based electrode, most preferably a carbon-ink electrode) of greater than a factor of 2, more preferably greater than a factor of 5 and most preferably greater than a factor of 10.<br>
The behavior of non-TPA containing ECL assay buffers and, in particular, non-TPA containing ECL assay buffers (especially, buffers comprising the non-TPA tertiary amine coreactants of the invention, preferably comprising N-substituted morpholines or piperazines, most preferably comprising PIPES) appears to be less dependent on the nature of a carbon electrode. For example, applicants have found that assays involving the use of PIPES as a coreactant, on both oxidized and non-oxidized electrodes, are unexpectedly and significantly improved by the addition of phenyl ether containing substances, and, in particular, phenyl ether containing detergents. Other detergents that did not possess the phenyl ether moiety did not produce this effect. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the addition of detergent to a non-TPA based ECL assay buffer (preferably, a PIPES-based ECL assay buffer) leads to an improvement in assay signal or S/B (nreferably induced with a carbon-based electrode, most<br><br>
preferably a carbon-ink electrode) of greater than a factor of 10, more preferably greater than a factor of 30 and most preferably greater than a factor of 100.<br>
In certain assays, e.g., assays involving detergent sensitive components such as biological membranes, it may be advantageous to reduce (e.g., to 
5.4      Preservatives<br>
It may be beneficial when storing ECL assay buffers to include a preservative that prevents microbial growth. Preferably, the preservative has little or no effect on ECL generated using the ECL assay buffer, especially when using the ECL assay buffer on a carbon based electrode. Azide has been found to be a suitable preservative. Isothiazolones (e.g., Kathon, 2-methyl-4-isothia2olin-3-one and 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one), oxazolidines (e.g., Oxaban A or 4,4 dimethyl oxazolidine) and related preservatives are especially preferred due their compatibility with ECL, their high activity and the low degree of problems associated with safety hazards or environmental concerns.<br><br>
5.5      Anti-Foam Agents<br>
It may be beneficial, especially in HTS applications, to avoid the production of bubbles or foam. For this reason it may be desirable to add anti-foaming agents to ECL assay buffers. Applicants have found that many commercial anti-foaming agents (including Antifoams o-30, Antifoam 204, Antifoam A, Antifoam SE-15, Antifoam SO-25 and Antifoam 289) may be added to ECL assay buffers v^thout significantly affecting the performance of the ECL assay buffers.<br>
5.6      ECL Labels<br>
The compositions of the invention may include ECL labels. The ECL labels may be conventional ECL labels. Examples of ECL labels include: i) organometallic compounds where the metal is selected from, for example, the noble metals of group VIII, including Ru-containing and Os-containing organometallic compounds such as the tris-bipyridyl-ruthenium (RuBpy) moiety and ii) luminol and related compounds. Preferably, the ECL labels are capable of repeatedly emitting electrochemiluminescence. Preferred ECL labels are ruthenium or osmium-containing organometallic species. More preferably, these ruthenium or osmium-containing organometallic comprise ruthenium or osmium chelated to polypyridyl ligands (most preferably, bipyridine, phenanthroline, and/or substituted derivatives thereof). Most preferably, the ECL labels comprise ruthenium-^r/^-bipyridine, the bipyridine ligands being, optionally substituted, e.g., with a linking group for attaching the label to an assay reagent.<br>
The ECL label may be linked to an assay reagent, optionally through a linking group. Examples of binding reagents that may be linked to an ECL label include: whole cells, cell surface antigens, subcellular particles {e.g., organelles or membrane fragments), viruses, prions,<br><br>
dust mites or fragments thereof, viroids, antibodies, antigens, haptens, fatty acids, nucleic acids (and synthetic analogs), proteins (and synthetic analogs), lipoproteins, polysaccharides, inhibitors, cofactors, haptens, cell receptors, receptor ligands, lipopolysaccharides, glycoproteins, peptides, polypeptides, enzymes, enzyme substrates, enzyme products, second messengers, cellular metabolites, hormones, pharmacological agents, synthetic organic molecules, organometallic molecules, tranquilizers, barbiturates, alkaloids, steroids, vitamins, amino acids, sugars, lectins, recombinant or derived proteins, biotin, avidin, streptavidin. The assay reagents are preferably useful as binding reagents or enzyme substrates in, e.g., binding assays or enzyme assays.<br>

Preferably, the ECL co-reactant used in these embodiments is suitable for use in an electrode induced luminescence reaction (e.g., electrochemiluminescence). Suitable ECL co-<br><br>
reactants include tripropylamine (TPA). Non-TPA coreactants (preferably, tertiary amines other than TPA as described in the coreactants section above) may be advantageous in some applications, in particular, in non-washed assay formats.<br>
Preferably, the composition comprises between 10 and 2000 mM pH buffer, more preferably 50 and 1200 mM, even more preferably between 100 and 600 mM, and most preferably between 300 and 500 mM.<br>

The optimal range of TPA concentrations in the pH buffers containing Tris and Gly-Gly is very similar to concentrations of ORIGEN® buffer (i.e., ranging from 50 - 200 mM). The tested range of concentirations of Tris and Gly-Gly buffers is 100 - 600 mM. Preferably, the concentration is 200 mM. ECL assay buffers comprising non-TPA coreactants of the invention (preferably, PIPES) may include similar ranges of coreactant concentrations, although in many applications the preferred range is 10-100 mM, most preferably 20-50 mM.<br>

Using Tris and Gly-Gly assay buffers significantly improved the stability of phosphopeptide-anti-phosphopeptide complexes in ECL-based Tyrosine Kinase assays. However, some dissociation of the complexes was observed in Tris buffer, although at much slower rates than in ORIGEN assay buffer. In the case of the Gly-Gly buffer, ECL signal slowly increased, because no stop reagent was introduced into assay solution to quench the enzymatic reaction.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment, the composition further comprises a stop reagent (i.e., a reagent added to stop a reaction or reduce interference with a reaction). Chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) are common stop reagents in Mg-dependent kinase assays. EDTA binds Mg   ions that are require for successful activation of ATP.   The addition of 5 mM EDTA into Gly-Gly assay buffer, for example, helps to stop residual tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity.  Dissociation of phosphopeptide-anti-phosphopeptide complexes in Gly-Gly/TPA buffer with 5 mM EDTA does not exceed 1% per 1 hour in a non-washed assay format. At concentrations higher than 10 mM, EDTA may have a negative effect on absolute value of ECL signal, but does not compromise stability of ECL signal upon incubation in assay buffer.

(i)       additional analyte of interest or an analog of the analyte of interest, (ii)      a binding partner of the analyte of interest or its said analog, and (iii)     a reactive component capable of binding with (i) or (ii),<br>
(c)	a metal-containing ECL moiety capable of being converted to an excited state from which electromagnetic radiation is emitted, said ECL moiety being capable of entering into a binding interaction with the analyte of interest or a substance defmed in (b)(i), (b)(ii), or (b)(iii);<br>

(3)	detecting emitted electromagnetic radiation,<br>
wherein the sample is not exposed to inorganic phosphate detrimental to the performance of the assay or wherein said composition further comprises an ECL assay buffer background reducing agent (preferably, a non-phosphate pH buffering agent). Preferably, the composition<br><br>
has less than 15 mM inorganic phosphate, more preferably it has less than 5 mM inorganic phosphate, even more preferably it has less than 1 mM phosphate, even more preferably it is substantially free of inorganic phosphate, most preferably it is free of inorganic phosphate.<br>
Solid phase assay formats (e.g., solid phase binding assays) often couple a biological activity or binding reaction to attachment or dissociation of a label from a surface. For example the binding interaction between a binding reagent that is attached and a labeled anaiyte results in the localization of the label on the solid phase supporting the immobilized binding reagent. The biological activity or binding reaction to be measured can be quantified through a measurement of the labels on the solid phase. Many solid phase assay formats involve a wash step to remove unbound labels prior to detecting labels on the solid phase (washed assays). Assays without this wash step can be achieved when the detection method can discriminate between free and bound labels. Non-wash assay formats are desired because washing steps, in many applications, can be difficult or cumbersome to carry out. In many cases, however, the performance of non-wash assays is limited by high background signals due to incomplete discrimination of free vs. bound labels.<br>
We have found, surprisingly, that the ECL assay buffers of the invention improve the discrimination of free vs. bound labels in ECL assays using assay reagents attached (e.g., by covalent interactions, specific binding interaction, non-specific adsorption, etc,) to the working electrode used to induce ECL (i.e., the ability to selectively detect labels that are bound to the electrode). More specifically, the compositions and reagents of the invention improve the ratio of ECL signal from bound label to ECL signal from free label. It is believed that the ECL assay buffers of the invention decrease the distance from the solid electrode surface from which an<br><br>
ECL label is induced to emit luminescence. This, in turn, increases the signal of bound label (which may be bound to the electrode surface) vs. free label (which is not bound to the electrode). Another way to characterize this is in terms of an "effective excitation length" - the maximum distance at which a free ECL label is able to be excited. The "effective excitation length" is impacted by i) the distance short-lived intermediates involved in the generation of ECL (e.g., oxidation product of TPA) can diffuse from the electrode before they are destroyed in a destructive side reaction (a function of the lifetimes and diffusion constants for these intermediates) and ii) the rate at which free labels or labeled reagents diffuse into the region close enough to the electrode to participate in a reaction with these reactive intermediates (a function of the diffusion constant for the unbound ECL labels or labeled reagents).<br>
Using the ECL assay buffers of the invention, the effective excitation length is reduced by &gt; 50 %, preferably by &gt; 75 %, even more preferably by &gt; 90 %. Thus, the ECL assay buffers of the invention are desirable since they maximize the ratio of bound/firee ECL signal which enhances the performance of the assay. These considerations are particularly important for measuring low affinity interactions, which require the presence of the labeled species in high concentration in the solution but would also be expected to suffer from significant signal loss due to binding complex dissociation during wash steps.<br>
Accordingly, another aspect of the invention relates to non-wash format assays using pH buffer substantially free of inorganic phosphate which maximizes the ratio of bound/firee ECL signal. Preferably, the assay involves the capture of an ECL label at a surface having or being adjacent to an electrode surface. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,066,448; 6,090,545; 6.140.045: 6.207.369. 6,214.369: and U.S. Aonlication Nos. 10/185,274 and 10/185,363, entitled<br><br>
"Assay Plates, Reader Systems and Methods for Luminescence Test Measurements", each filed on June 28, 2002, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Thus, another embodiment of the invention relates generally to electrochemiluminescence assays using reagents immobilized on a surface (preferably an electrode surface) and having advantageous effective excitation lengths. Preferably, the assay results in an effective excitation length less then 100 microns, more preferably less than 75 microns, even more preferably less than 50 microns, even more preferably less than 25 microns, even more preferably less than 10 microns, even more preferably less than 5 microns and most preferably less than 1 micron. According to a particularly preferred, embodiment, the effective excitation length is less than 0.5 micron, preferably less than 0.2 microns, even more preferably less than 0.1 micron.<br>

The electrodes were, optionally treated with an oxygen plasma prior to being coated with binding reagents (plasma treated and non-plasma treated plates, respectively, are designated hereafter as PT or NPT plates). Binding reagents were immobilized on the working electrodes of the plates using the methods described in the U.S. Appl Nos. 10/185,274 and 10/185,363 or adaptations thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, ECL measurements were carried out using multi-well plate readers adapted for use with these multi-well plates. The readers and their use are described in Example 6.3 of the U.S. Appl Nos. 10/185,274 and 10/185,363. U.S. Appl Nos. 10/185,274 and 10/185,363 and, in particular, the descriptions of plate types, immobilization methods, plate readers and ECL measurement methods, are hereby incorporated by reference. The reported ECL intensities are reported in relative terms and may depend on the instrument, gain settings and plates used in a particular experiment. For this reason, the absolute values reported in different experiments may not be directly comparable.<br>
EXAMPLE II:    TYROSINE KINASE ASSAY<br>
The format involved the phosphorylation of a kinase substrate immobilized on electrodes in multi-well plates adapted for ECL measurements (see Example I), complexation of the<br><br>
product to a labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and detection of the surface-bound label via an ECL measurement in the presence of an ECL Assay Buffer comprising an ECL coreactant. The electrodes were pretreated by etching in an oxygen plasma to increase the amount of exposed carbon. The kinase substrate — poly(Glu, Tyr) having a 4:1 ratio of Glu to Tyr and a molecular weight of 20,000-50,000 Daltons (PGT, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) — was immobilized by non-specific adsorption on the surface of the working electrodes in the wells of the plates. The working electrode in each well was treated with 1500 nL of a solution containing 1 mg/ml PGT in PBS buffer. The plate was then dried overnight and blocked in a 5% solution of bovine serum albumin at 4oC. The plate was washed to remove the blocking agent prior to use.<br>
The assay was carried out by adding, to each well, 50 μL of a buffered solution containing a soluble tyrosine kinase (c-src. Upstate Biotechnology), an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Abzyme, IGEN International) that was labeled with a sulfonated derivative of ruthenium-/r/5-bipyridine (Sulfo-TAG'^'^ label, Meso Scale Discovery), ATP and Mg+2. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 hour. The plate was washed and 100 ^iL of an ECL Assay Buffer containing tripropylamine was added. The plate was analyzed using electrochemiluminescence detection as described in Example I.<br>
When a conventional ECL Assay Buffer containing TPA in a phosphate buffer (ORIGEN Assay Buffer, IGEN International) was used in the protocol, the complex formed between the labeled antibody and the phosphorylated substrate dissociated over a period of 30 min. to an hour (the majority of the dissociation occurring within the first few minutes) due to the competitive binding of phosphate ions with the labeled antibodies. One approach to avoiding this problem is to control the time of exposure of the formed complex to the inorganic phosphate-containing<br><br>
solution. This approach, however, may be impractical in some assays such as high throughput assays involving large numbers of plates.<br>
Applicants discovered another solution to overcome the problem was the use of phosphate-free buffers. Surprisingly, it was discovered that the phosphate could be replaced with other buffers without compromising the ability of the ECL Assay Buffers to support the generation of ECL.<br>
Assays were carried out using the following two ECL Assay Buffer compositions:<br>
Gly-Gly Assay Buffer:<br>
0.4 M Glycylglycine (Gly-Gly)<br>
0.1 M Tripropylamine (TPA)<br>
12 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA)<br>
pH = 7.8 (adjusted by addition of 10% KOH)<br>
Tris Assay Buffer:<br>
0.4 M Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) 0.15 M Tripropylamine (TPA) 12 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA) pH = 7,8 (adjusted by addition of 10% KOH)<br>
EDTA was added into the new ECL Assay Buffers to stop the phosphorylation reaction by sequestering Mg+2, an ion required for kinase activity (EDTA was not required in phosphate-based ECL Assay Buffers due to the affinity of phosphate for magnesium ions). This composition allowed us to combine two steps (addition of stop-solution and actual assay buffer) into one step. Applicants found that EDTA interfered with ECL generation at concentrations higher that 10 mM, but that 5-12 mM EDTA was enough to stop the reaction while only causing a small decrease in ECL signal.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the decrease in ECL from the phosphopeptide-antibody complex as a function of the time between the addition of the Assay Buffer and the measurement of ECL. Surprisingly, while exposure of the complex to the phosphate-containing ORIGEN Assay Buffer led to almost complete dissociation of the complex (within the time it took to put the plate into the ECL reader for the 0 min. point), the complex showed excellent stability in the Gly-Gly (
The stability of the complex was improved further by eliminating the wash step prior to addition of the assay buffer.   Figure 2 shows the results of an experiment in which 200 |iL of Gly-Gly Assay Buffer (as described above except that the concentration of EDTA was 5 mM and 0.2% Triton X-100 was added) was added directly to the reaction mixture without an intervening wash step. Storage of the plates for 20 hours prior to measuring ECL resulted in only a 15% decrease in signal.<br>
One additional surprising advantage of the protocol was its robustness. Surprisingly, the time of the phosphorylation step was the only time that required tight control in order to get reproducible results. The results of the assay did not depend on the time between all other steps.<br>
EXAMPLE III: DETECTION OF PHOSPHORYLATED EGF RECEPTOR<br>
A sandwich immunoassay was used to detect autophosphorylated a-epidermai growth factor receptor (a-EGFR) in cell lysates prepared from EGF-activated A-431 cells (American Type Culture Collection). The assay employed a biotin labeled capture antibody directed against the a-EGFR extracellular domain and a Sulfo-TAG labeled detection antibody that is specific for phosphotyrosine (see Example II). The biotin-labeled antibody was immobilized on the<br><br>
working electrode of multi-well plates adapted for use in ECL assays (see Example I) through the interaction of the biotin label with avidin that was passively adsorbed on the electrode surface. Solubilized EGFR (in RIP A, a deoxycholate-containing buffer) was then added and allowed to bind to the anti-EGFR antibody. Subsequently, the Sulfo-TAG labeled a-phosphotyrosine antibody was added to detect autophosphorylated EGFR.<br>
In an end-product stability experiment, an assay was carried out as described above and, prior to the induction and measurement of ECL, the resulting sandwich complex was incubated for varying amounts of time in two different ECL Assay Buffers: 150mM TPA/150mM Phosphate, pH 7.48 and lOOmM TPA/400mM glycine-glycine, pH 7.8. Figure 3 shows that there was a significant time-dependent decay in signal in the presence of the phosphate-containing buffer; the signal decreased by roughly 80% after one hour. The glycine-glycine buffer reduced this decrease to roughly 20%. The great loss of signal that occurs in the phosphate buffer is believed to be due to the phosphate ion competing with the phosphorylated protein for the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Moreover, the signal to background ratio was increased 2.5 fold using the glycyl-glycine assay buffer.<br>
EXAMPLE IV: EFFECT OF ECL ASSAY BUFFER COMPOSITION ON THE<br>
ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN SPECIFIC SIGNAL AND ASSAY BUFFER BACKGROUND<br>
In many ECL assay formats, the sensitivity with which an ECL label can be measured is limited by the light signal (and the noise in the light signal) generated by the ECL Assay Buffer in the absence of the ECL label (ECL Assay Buffer background). This limitation is especially<br><br>
evident in washed assays, assays exhibiting low levels of non-specific binding and/or assays employing ECL readers having sensitive, low noise, light detectors. Applicants examined the relationship between ECL Assay Buffer composition and the ability to discriminate between the signal due to an ECL label and the ECL Assay Buffer background. In particular, applicants tested four ECL Assay Buffer formulations that varied in the identity of the ECL coreactant and/or the identity of the pH buffering agent: TPA/Phosphate, TPA/Tris, TPA/Gly-Gly and PIPES/Phosphate (where PIPES stands for l,4-piperazine-l,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid).<br>
The experiments were carried out on multi-well plates (as described in Example I) that had avidin immobilized on the working electrodes. The experiments were carried out on plates that were treated with an oxygen plasma (PT plates) as well as on untreated plates (NPT plates). Avidin was immobilized on PT plates by dispensing 2.5 uL of solution containing 0.5 mg/mL avidin and 0.0035% Triton X-100 on the working electrode of each well, allowing the solution to evaporate to dryness over a period of 1 hour and blocking the remaining surfaces of the well overnight at 4*'C with a 5% (w/v) solution of BSA. Avidin was immobilized on NPT plates by dispensing 2.5 uL of solution containing 0.5 mg/mL avidin and 0.0075% Triton X-100 on the working electrode of each well, allowing the solution to evaporate to dryness overnight and blocking the remaining surfaces of the well for 2 hours with a 5% (w/v) solution of BSA. Varying amounts of an ECL label could be brought into proximity with the electrode surface by treating the wells with a solution containing bovine IgG that was labeled with biotin and --1.9 Sulfo-TAG labels per protein (BT-IgG*). The binding of the BT-IgG* was accomplished by adding 50 uL of a solution containing 1 nM of BT-IgG* in PBS to the wells and incubating for a period of 60 minutes while shaking. The wells were washed with water, 100 uL of ECL Assay<br><br>
Buffer was added and ECL was measured. The signal due to ECL Assay Buffer Background was measured by repeating the experiment as described above except that the BT-IgG was omitted.<br>
The four combinations of coreactant and pH buffer to be tested were optimized to identify the concentration of coreactant, the concentration of pH buffer and the pH that gave the best ratio of signal from BT-IgG* to ECL Assay Buffer background (S/B ratio). The concentrations of coreactant were varied from 25 to 200 mM for TPA or 13 to 200 mM for PIPES. The concentrations of pH buffer were varied from 50 to 300 mM for phosphate, 100-600 mM for Tris or 50-800 mM for Gly-Gly. The pH was varied from 7 to 8. In all cases, the ECL Assay Buffers also contained 0.05% Triton X-100 KOH or HCl were added as necessary to achieve the desired pH. Within the ranges tested, all the formulations gave adequate performance for use in ECL assays, however, the following optimized formulations were identified on the basis of their S/B ratios: TP A/Phosphate (125 mM TPA, 200 mM phosphate, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.5); TPA/Tris (125 mM TPA, 200 mM Tris, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.8); TPA/Gly-Gly (100 mM TPA, 200 mM Gly-Gly, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.8) and PIPES/Phos (25 mM PIPES, 100 mM phosphate, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7,5).<br>
Figures 4 A and 4B compare the performance of the four optimized formulations for assays carried out on NPT plates and PT plates, respectively. We found that the TP A/Phosphate and TPA/Tris buffers gave roughly comparable signals for the BT-IgG*, however, the lower ECL Assay Buffer Background of the TPA/Tris system led to a significant improvement in the S/B ratio relative to the TP A/Phosphate buffer. Assuming the noise in the background to be roughly proportional to the background signal, the 4-6 fold improvement in S/B ratio transfers<br><br>
directly to a 4-6 fold improvement in detection limits. Despite having lower specific signals, the TPA/Gly-Gly buffer had an S/B ratio that was approximately the same as the TPA/Tris buffer and could, therefore, be expected to produce similar detection limits. The PIPES/Phosphate buffer performed slightly better (in terms of S/B ratio) than the TPA/Phosphate buffer on unetched plates and slightly worse on etched plates.<br>
EXAMPLE V: EFFECT OF THE ECL ASSAY BUFFER COMPOSITION ON THE<br>
ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN ECL LABELS THAT ARE BOUND TO AN ELECTRODE SURFACE AND ECL LABELS THAT ARE FREE IN SOLUTION<br>
In some ECL assay fomiats, the sensitivity with which an ECL label held in proximity to an electrode can be measured is limited by the light signal (and the noise in the light signal) generated by ECL labels in solution. This limitation is especially evident in assays in which labels in solution are not removed by washing prior to the addition of an ECL Assay Buffer and the measurement of ECL (Unwashed Assays). Applicants examined the relationship between ECL Assay Buffer composition and the ability to discriminate between the signal due to ECL labels bound to (or held in proximity to) an electrode and ECL labels that are free in solution.<br>
In these experiments, the specific signal from bound ECL labels was measured using BT-IgG* bound to avidin-coated electrodes as described in Example IV. The ECL Assay Buffer background was determined by omitting the BT-IgG*, also as described in Example IV. The ECL signal from free ECL labels in solution was determined similarly to the ECL Assay Buffer background except that the ECL Assay Buffer added to the wells included 10 nM bovine IgG having 3.9 labels per protein (IgG*). The ratio of the ECL signal from the bound BT-IgG* to the<br><br>
ECL signal from the free IgG* (B/F ratio) is indicative of the sensitivity with which bound ECL labels can be detected in the presence of free ECL labels in solution.<br>
The four optimized ECL Assay Buffers from Example IV were tested for their ability to discriminate between surface bound ECL labels. The results are presented in Tables lA and IB. The replacement of phosphate with Tris led to some improvement in the B/F ratio for TPA-containing buffers. The most drastic improvement, however, was achieved by substituting the coreactant component, i.e., by replacing TPA with PIPES. There was a 4-5 fold improvement in the B/F ratio by replacing TPA/Phos with PIPES/Phos.<br><br><br><br>
PIPES-containing ECL Assay Buffers were prepared with phosphate, Tris or Gly-Gly as the buffering agent. The B/F ratio of each of these mixtures was further optimized by varying the concentration of PIPES and the buffer component. The concentration of PIPES was varied from 12.5 to 200 mM in the phosphate-based buffer and 25 to 100 mM in the Tris and Gly-Gly buffers. The concentrations of the buffering agent were varied from 100 to 400 mM. In all cases, the ECL Assay Buffers also contained 0.05% Triton X-100. KOH or HCl were added as necessary to achieve the desired pH. Within the ranges tested, all the formulations gave adequate performance for use in ECL assays including compositions that had no added buffer component. It was also possible to omit the buffering agent and achieve adequate performance due the abiUty of PIPES to act as a pH buffer. PIPES concentrations of 20-100 mM were found to provide high B/F ratios while maintaining reasonable ECL intensities. The best performance was achieved when the phosphate concentrations was roughly 2-4 times the PIPES concentration. The following optimized formulations were identified on the basis of having both high S/B ratios and reasonable signal intensities: PIPES/PHOSPHATE (25 mM PIPES, 100 mM<br><br>
phosphate, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.5); PIPES/Tris (25 mM PIPES, 200 mM Tris, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.8) and PIPES/Gly-Gly (25 mM PIPES, 100 mM Gly-Gly, 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 7.8).<br>
Figures 5 A and 5B compare the performance of the three optimized formulations for nonwashed assays carried out on NPT plates and PT plates, respectively. The figures compare the performance to the conventional TPA/Phosphate buffer. We found that for all three buffering agents that were tested, the use of PIPES as a coreactant led to significant improvements (as much as factors of 4-5) in the B/F ratio relative to TP A/Phosphate.<br>
EXAMPLE VI: EFFECT OF DETERGENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF ECL<br>
ASSAY BUFFERS<br>
Figure 6 shows the effect of the presence of various non-ionic detergents on ECL signal from BT-IgG* bound to avidin-coated plasma treated electrodes. The detergents were added at 0.5 %(w/v) to one of two ECL Assay Buffers: Figure 6A shows the results obtained with 150 mM TPA, 250 mM phosphate, pH 7.5; Figure 6B shows the results obtained with 50 mM PIPES, 150 mM phosphate, pH 7.5. BT-IgG* (50 |iL of a 0.01 nM solution) was allowed to bind to the avidin surface. The plates were washed, ECL Assay Buffers were added and the plates were analyzed using ECL detection. The figure shows the Assay Buffer background, signal and S/B ratio (calculated as in Example 4) measured using each of the ECL Assay Buffers. Of the detergents tested, only Triton X-100 had a significant effect on performance. For the PIPES-based buffer, the effect was large; addition of Triton led to a &gt;2.5 fold increase in the S/B ratio. The effect of Triton X-100 on the TPA-based buffer was much smaller. Triton X-100 differs<br><br>
from the other detergents present in that it contains a phenol ether moiety. Applicants hypothesize that the beneficial effect of Triton X-100 may result from the oxidation of the phenol ether moiety at the electrode and the participation of the Triton oxidation product in the ECL reaction.<br>
Surprisingly, the effect of detergents on assays conducted on non-plasma treated plates was different and much greater in magnitude. Figure 7 shows the effect of five different non-ionic detergents on TPA/Phos, TPA/Tris, TPA/Gly-Gly and PIPES/Phos Assay Buffers (the optimized formulations of Example IV except for the composition and amount of detergent). Tween 20, Thesit, Triton X-100 and Triton X-114 were all present at a concentration of 0.05%(v/v). P-Octyl glucopyranoside was present at a concentration of 4 %(v/v). In this experiment, streptavidin-coated electrodes were treated with 0.018 pmol of BT-IgG* (6.3 labels per protein) in a volume of 50 uL. The figure shows that all the detergents significantly improved the ECL signal measured in the presence of TPA-containing Assay Buffers relative to the same Assay Buffer in the absence of detergent. In most cases, the improvement was greater than 2 fold. In additional experiments, it was observed that the maximal signals observed in each Assay Buffer tended to occur at the critical micellar concentration (cmc) of a detergent or higher. In contrast to the TPA-containing ECL Assay Buffers, the performance of PIPES was improved -30 fold by the addition of the phenol ether containing detergents (Triton X-lOO and Triton X-114) but very little improvement in signal was observed in the presence of the Tween and Thesit detergents-Applicants hypothesize that the effect of the Triton detergents on the PIPES/Phos buffer may be related to the participation of Triton oxidation products in the ECL process. By contrast.<br><br>
the effect of detergents on the ECL signal from TPA-containing Assay Buffers on NPT electrodes appears to be a more general phenomenon and may relate to the stabilization of TPA oxidation products in detergent micelles.<br>
A larger screen of detergents was conducted to identify other detergents that improved the ECL signal from BT-IgG* on streptavidin-coated NPT electrodes in the presence of TP A/Phosphate. The addition of all the non-ionic detergents (APO-14, Triton X-100, p-nonyl-glucoside, Tween 20, Genapol and pentaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether) and zwitterionic detergents (ASB-14 and Empigen) that were tested produced increases in the ECL signal.<br>
EXAMPLE VII: ECL ACTIVITY OF SELECTED TERTIARY AMINES<br>
A number of tertiary amines were screened for their ability act as coreactants. The measurements were conducted in a similar fashion as the methods described in Examples IV and V. ECL Assay Buffers were prepared that contained the selected tertiary amine (200 mM), phosphate buffer (200 niM), Triton X-100 (0.1 %) and that were adjusted to pH 7,5. The signal from label attached to an electrode was measured using the following procedure: i) a solution containing 0.3 nM Bt-lgG * (IgG labeled with Sulfo-TAG and biotin) in an ECL Assay Buffer was introduced into the wells of streptavidin-coated 96-well NPT or PT plates; ii) the plates were incubated for 2 h with shaking to allow the Bt-IgG* to bind the surface; iii) the plates were washed four times and 150 uL of the ECL Assay Buffer was added and iv) the ECL from the label was measured. The assay buffer background was measured by introducing 150 uL of an ECL Assay Buffer into a streptavidin-coated plate and measuring the ECL. The ECL signal<br><br>
from free ECL labels in solution was measured by introducing a solution containing 10 nM IgG* (IgG labeled with Sulfo-TAG but not biotin) into the wells of streptavidin-coated 96-well NPT or PT plates and measuring the ECL.<br>
Tables Ila and lib presents the results of the experiments on NPT and PT plates, respectively. The results show that a variety of tertiary amines were suitable for use as coreactants. In general, the introduction of functionalization appeared to improve the ratio of bound to free signals. Tertiary amines having N-substituted morpholine core or, even more advantageously, a di-N-substituted piperazine core (especially, PIPES, HEPES, POPSO, HEPPSO and EPPS) appeared to be especially well suited for distinguishing bound vs. free signals (especially on NPT surfaces). There was some difference in the relative performances on PT and NPT plates, e.g., MOPS was found to perform particularly well on PT plates while bis-Tris-Propane gave exceptionally high signals on NPT plates.<br>
ECL was also measured using coreactants in comparable buffers, except they did not include detergent or Tween 20 was used as the detergent. Two coreactants other than TPA stood out as having very low dependence on the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (N,N-bis-(hydroxyethyl)-N-4-aminobutanesulfonic acid and TPA dimer). These detergents have bound/free ratios than TPA and are especially suitable for unwashed assays having detergent sensitive components.<br>
Additional experiments showed that these coreactants could be used in ECL Assay buffers buffered with a variety of different pH buffers, e.g., GlyGly, Gly, Tris, Tricine and phosphate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
