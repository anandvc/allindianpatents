.ANTENNA FOR PORTABLE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION APPARATUSES BACKGROUND OP THE INVENTION<br>
5 Field of tha Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an antenna<br>
    for portable 'wireless communication apparatuses, and more<br>
    particularly to an improved antenna for the prevention of<br>
    harm to users  by electromagnetic waves  generated by<br>
10   portable wireless communication apparatuses.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Today, mobile phones and other wireless apparatuses  have been widely used due to the development of the<br>
15 communication service, and such communication apparatuses can. be used everywhere by means of wireless communication technology.<br>
In general,  communication can mainly be- classified into wire communication and wireless communication.  In the<br>
20 case of wireless communication, there are needed a transmitter for transmitting electromagnetic waves, an antenna for receiving the electromagnetic waves transmitted from the transmitter, and a receiver for receiving the electromagnetic waves from the antenna.<br>
25 The transmitter-receiver and the antenna are installed on the body of the communication apparatus. Since these devices, such as the transmitter-receiver and the antenna, have become . smaller and lighter, the communication apparatuses including these device have been miniaturized.<br>
30     The antenna  can be  classified  according  to  the<br><br>
WO 03/003511<br><br>
2<br><br>
PCT/KR02/0 m»<br><br>
operation method of a linear radiator/and a helical antenna J part  in  which  the  radiating  directions  of  the electromagnetic waves are non-directional.   That is, the antennas are mainly classified into three types, that is, a<br>
5 retractable type, a fixed type and a top mounted-helical type. In the retractable __type_ of_ antenna, the helical antenna part 100 is fixed to the housing and the linear radiator 200 can move up and down in the helical antenna part 100, as shown in Fig, 10a.  In the fixed type of<br>
10 antenna, both helical antenna part 100 and linear radiator 200 are fixed to the housing, as shown in Fig, 10b. In the top \mount-helical type of antenna, the helical antenna part 100 is installed on top of the linear radiator 200, as shown in Fig. 10c.<br>
15 As described above,, if the helical antenna part in which the radiating directions of electromagnetic waves art? non-directional is used, the antenna has direct harmful effects on the ' user of the wireless communication apparatuses..   The electromagnetic waves of the antenna<br>
20 include direct waves, reflected waves and diffracted waves. All these waves do harm to people, and above all the direct waves are the most harmful.<br>
A  conventional  electromagnetic  waves  intercepting system  encloses  a  circuit  substrate  mounted  in  the<br>
25 communication apparatus so as' to prevent the electromagnetic waves from leaking to the outside. This conventional electromagnetic waves intercepting system has a problem in that the electromagnetic waves leak to the outside through an antenna connecting hole which is formed<br>
30 in the electromagnetic waves intercepting system-<br><br>
WO 03/003511	PCT/KR02/01228<br>
3<br>
That  is,  this  conventional  electromagnetic waves intercepting system includes the hole in which the antennal<br>
connector is installed so as to ground the antenna exposed,<br>
to  the  outside  on  the  circuit  substrate  of  the 5 communication apparatuses. v When the antenna connector isi<br>
connected to the hole, the hole is not completely sealed<br>
due to the tolerance of the hole.<br>
According  to  another  conventional  method  for<br>
intercepting electromagnetic waves, a filter material for 10 intercepting the electromagnetic waves is coated onto the<br>
inside of the casing so as to intercept the electromagnetic<br>
waves.<br>
However, since, the conventional wireless antenna is<br>
positioned  on the  upper side  of the  casing of the 15 communication apparatuses and is  pulled from a guide<br>
protrusion to make. a phone call, the/electromagnetic waves<br>
radiated  when  using 'the communication  apparatuses  are<br>
directly transmitted to the head of the user.  Thus, the<br>
health-of the user becomes worse' because the direct waves, 20 the reflected waves and the diffracted waves have a direct<br>
negative influence upon the head of the user.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
25 . Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the above problems occurring' in tne prior art, and an object of the present invention is. to provide an antenna for portable wireless communication apparatuses, which i* comprised of an ■ antenna element for providing<br>
30 electromagnetic waves directions! properties. replacing the<br>

conventional helical antenna part for generating non-directional electromagnetic waves, and a linear radiator supplied with power and connected in parallel with the antenna element,  thereby preventing the electromagnetic<br>

DESCRIPTION OP THE  PREFERRED 'EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference-'now should be made to the drawings, in which the  same  reference numerals  are  used  throughout  the<br>
10 different drawings to designate the same or similar components.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, an antenna element 3 of the present invention is cylindrical-shaped and includes on its outer surface a conductor 32 in which a plurality of<br>
15 openings 32a are formed at desired intervals. The outer portion of the interior of the conductor 32 is filled with a dielectric material 31. A hollow portion 31a surrounded with the dielectric material 31 includes a stepped portion 31b on the bottom portion thereof, with the stepped portion<br>
20 31b being provided with a hole to supply a linear radiator 2 with power. The antenna element 3 is installed at the position where a helical antenna part is conventionally installed.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the linear radiator 2<br>
25 includes the first radiator part 20 and the second radiator<br>
part 22 linked together in a row in a capacitive connecting<br>
manner.  The first radiator part 20 is relatively short in<br>
length  and  inserted  into  the  antenna  element  3<br>
   longitudinally.  The first radiator' part 20 consists of a  <br>
30 dielectric cap 20b on its top portion,  a power supply<br>
7 <br>
WO 03/003511<br><br>
7<br><br>
PCT/KR02/01228<br><br>
terminal 20a on its bottom portion and a rod 21 connecting the dielectric cap 20b with the power supply terminal 20a, with the rod 21 being made of a conductive material. The second radiator part 22 is longer than the first radiator<br>
5 part 20. This second radiator part 22 consists of a rod 23 covered with a dielectric material 24 and the power supply terminal 22a. The rod 23 is a conductor as a rod 21 of the first radiator part 20, and is aligned with the rod 21.<br>
Although in this embodiment there is employed the<br>
10 linear radiator 2 consisting of a plurality of rods, there can be employed a linear radiator 2 in which a plurality of rods are integrated into a single body. In the meantime, the linear radiator 2 and the antenna element 3 are fixedly attached to the housing while the linear radiator 2 can be<br>
15 inserted into the antenna element 3, or the antenna element 3 can be fixedly attached to the upper portion of the linear radiator 2.<br>
In this present embodiment, the dielectric material 31 is surrounded with the conductor 32.   Preferably,  the<br>
20 dielectric material 31 can be plated with metal or coated with a printed circuit substrate in place of the conductor 32, thereby being capable of reducing the weight and size of the antenna, being convenient to manufacture and reducing the manufacturing cost of the antenna.<br>
25 The openings 32a may be rectangular-shaped, as shown in Fig. 1. However, the openings 32a having one of the elongated-shape and triangular-shape may be formed at desired intervals around the antenna element 3, as shown in Figs. 5a and 5b.  Also, each opening 32a may be divided<br>
30 into a plurality of parts each having one of elongated,<br>
8<br><br>
WO 03/003511	PCT/KR02/01228<br>
8<br>
rectangular or triangular-shape, with a plurality of openings 32a being formed around the antenna element 3 at desired intervals, as shown in Fig. 5c.<br>
. The openings 32a may be butterfly-shaped,- as shown in<br>
5 Fig.  5e,  and may have  two  or more different shapes<br>
regularly spaced apart from each other, as shown in Fig.<br>
5d,  In this way, the openings 32a can be varied in form so<br>
as to adjust the electrical characteristics of the antenna.<br>
The operation and effect of the antenna of the present<br>
10 invention  will  be  described  with  reference  to  the retractable-,type antenna shown in Figs. 4a and 4b.<br>
'The operation of the antenna of the present invention is described in the following when the linear radiator 2 moves up and down in the antenna element 3, a principal<br>
15 element of the present invention,<br>
When the linear radiator is retracted (refer to Fig. 4a)<br>
When the linear radiator 2 passing through the antenna <br>
20 element 3 fixed to the housing is retracted into the housing, the linear radiator 2 is inserted into the housing and is extended through the antenna element 3.<br>
At this time, the first radiator part 20 is supplied<br>
   with power and resonated- with the antenna element  3. <br>
i 25 Specifically,' the power supply terminal 20a formed on the<br>
bottom of the rod 21 of the first radiator part 20 is<br>
inserted into the hole of. the stepped portion 31b to be<br>
supplied with power through the supply power terminals 20a,<br>
22a of the linear radiator 2.  Thus the first radiator part<br>
30 20  is  electrified and  resonated.    In this  case,  the<br><br>
WO 03/003511<br><br>
9<br><br>
PCT/KR02/0I228<br><br>
radiated electromagnetic waves have directional properties by means of the openings 32a formed on/*the conductor 32, as shown in Fig, 6.<br>
5  -  When the linear radiator is extended (refer to Fig.<br><br>
When the linear radiator 2 is extended out of the housing, the first radiator part 20 is separated from the antenna element 3, and at the same time the rod 23 covered<br>
10 with the dielectric material 24 of the second radiator part 22, which is. connected with the first radiator part 20 In a capacitive coupling manner, is partially vertically extended from the antenna element 3 through the hollow portion 31a of the antenna element 3.<br>
15 At this time, the power supply terminal 22a formed on the bottom of the rod 23 of the second radiator part 22 is inserted into the hole of the stepped portion 31b to be supplied with power through the supply power terminals 20a, 22a of the linear radiator 2.  Thus the second radiator<br>
20 part 22 is electrified and resonated. In this caser the radiated electromagnetic waves have directional properties by means of the openings 32a formed on the conductor 32, as shown in Fig. 6.'<br>
Therefore, . the linear radiator 2 is always grounded<br>
25 with the stepped portion 31b of the dielectric material 31 through the power supply terminals 20a and 22a of the first and second radiator parts 20 and 22 passing through the stepped portion 31b of the dielectric material 31, when retracted and extended.  Though the stepped portion 31b of<br>
10 the dielectric material 31 is grounded with the power<br>
10<br><br>
WO 03/003511<br><br>
10<br><br>
PCT/KR02./0i228<br><br>
supply terminals 20a and 22a of the linear radiator 2r there is not a power supply point between the antenna element 3 and the linear radiator 2, that is, power is not supplied between the antenna element 3 and the linear<br>
5 radiator 2.<br>
When the radiated electromagnetic waves have directional properties as shown in Fig. 6, the width W of the beam can- be adjusted by the area, shape, position and number of the openings 32a.<br>
10 The relation between the adjustment of the width W of the beam and the gain due to its adjustment is described in the following. Ks shown in Figs. 7a and 7b, two openings 32a are' equal to each other in terms of the shape and position but different from each other in terms of area.<br>
15 That is, when the length of the opening 32a is represented by S and its width is represented by L, the lengths SI and. S2 of two openings 32a are equal to each other and the width LI of one opening 32a shown in Fig. 7a is longer than L2 of the other opening 32a shown in Fig. 7b, the width W<br>
20 of the beam gets smaller, as the area of the opening 32a gets larger, as shown in Figs. 7c and 7d, thereby allowing the electromagnetic waves to have directional properties.<br>
The case where the openings 32a ax-e equal to each other in terms of area and position but different from each<br>
25 other in terms of shape, will be described in the following with reference to Figs. Sa and 8b. When the height of the opening 32a is represented by H and its width is represented by P, the height HI of the opening 32a of Fig. 8a is equal to the. height H2 of the opening Fig. 8b and<br>
30 further the width PI of the opening of Fig. 8a is equal, to<br>
11<br><br>
WO 03/0035H	PCT/KR02/01228<br>
11<br>
the width P2 of the opening Fig. 8b, the shape of the beam of the rectangular opening of Fig. 8a is shown in Fig. 8c and the shape of the beam of the triangular opening of Fig, 8b is shown in Fig, 8d.<br>
5 As shown in Figs. 8c and 8d, the widths W of the beams are equal or similar to each other on the x-y line, whereas the shapes thereof are different from-to each other on the x-z line. In this manner, the shape of the beam can be varied.  The width of the band is narrow when the opening<br>
10 32a is rectangular in shape, as shown in Fig. 8e, whereas the width of the band is wide when the opening 32a is triangular in shape as shown in Fig. 8f. Accordingly the •width of the band can be adjusted, and thus problems due to polarized wave synchronization and the reflected waves of<br>
15 the antenna can be solved.<br>
By . changing the position of the opening 32a, the radiating direction of the beam can be adjusted in the desired direction. For example, in the case where the electromagnetic    waves    are   non-directional,    the<br>
.20 electromagnetic waves are transmitted to the user of the wireless communication apparatuses, even though the upper portion of the antenna is modified.   However, when the direction of the electromagnetic waves are changed by, moving the passive antenna or the openings 32a according to<br>
25 the present invention, the direction of the radiation of the electromagnetic waves transmitted to the user of the wireless communication apparatuses can be changed and/or adjusted.<br>
The shape of the beam according to the number of<br>
30 openings 32a is illustrated in Figs. 9a to 9d.  Taking the<br>
12<br><br>
WO 03/003511<br><br>
12<br><br>
PCT/KR02/0122S<br><br>
rectangular opening 32a as an example, when the length of the opening 32a is represented by S and the width thereof is represented by L, the S3 of Fig. 9a- is equal to the S4 of Fig. 9b, and L3 of Fig. 9a is longer than L4 of Fig. 9b. <br>
5  As shown in Fig. 9a, the adjustment of the width W of the beam with one wider opening 32a is restricted within a limited range.  On the contrary, when the width W of the beam is adjusted with divided openings 32a having the width-L4 respectively, as shown in Fig. 9b, the width W of the<br>
10 beam can be adjusted to be narrower than that when using one wider opening 32a.  The butterfly-shaped opening 32a of Fig. $e is an example to which this principle is applied,<br>
  Since the gain and the radiating characteristics of<br>
   the antenna are varied depending on the shape, area,<br>
15 position and number of the openings 32a, the radiating<br>
   direction and radiating amount of the electromagnetic waves<br>
   are adjusted by varying the shape, area, position and<br>
   number of the openings 32a.	:<br>
In the present embodiment, the antenna element 3 is<br>
20 fixed to the housing and the radiator 2 moves up and down<br>
, through the antenna element 3 to be resonated, thereby<br>
adjusting the radiating direction and radiating amount of<br>
the electromagnetic waves.  However, the present invention<br>
is not limited to this embodiment and can/be widely applied<br>
25      to  the  various  antennas  for  the// portable  wireless<br>
communication apparatuses.   For example, in the antenna<br>
structure where the helical antenna part is installed as<br>
shown in Figs. 10a to 10c, when the antenna element is used<br>
in place of the helical antenna part, the antenna has<br>
30  directional properties.<br>
13<br><br>
WO 03/003511	PCT/KR02/01228<br>
13<br>
Further/ for the antenna structure in which the antenna element 3 and the linear radiator 2 are fixedly attached to the housing in parallel and the structure in which the antenna element 3 is attached to the upper<br>
5 portion of the linear radiator 2 moving up and down and is connected in parallel with the linear/ radiator 2, the antenna element 3 is resonated as described above, so the gain and radiating characteristics of the antenna are varied depending on the shape, area,, position and number of<br>
10 the opening 32a, Therefore, the radiating direction and radiating amount of the electromagnetic waves can be adjusted by varying the shape, area, position and number of the openings 32a.<br>
As described above, the present invention is directed<br>
15 to provide an antenna for portable wireless communication apparatuses, which is comprised of an antenna element for providing electromagnetic waves with directional properties in place of the conventional helical antenna" part for generating non-directional electromagnetic waves,  and a<br>
20 linear radiator supplied with power and connected in parallel with the antenna element, thereby preventing the electromagnetic waves generated by portable wireless communication apparatuses from doing harm to users, and increasing the efficiency of the antenna.<br>
25 Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without  departing  from,  the  scope  and  spirit  of  the<br>
