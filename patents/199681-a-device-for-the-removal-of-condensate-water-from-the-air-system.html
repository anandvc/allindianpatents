				<td>This invention relates to a device for the removal of condensate water from the air systems.<br>
In  the  prior  art, auto drain  valveÂ©  are  known  for<br>
removing the condense water from the air systems. These valves  are adapted to be fitted below the air tank  and<br>
to a chamber provided for collection of condensate . The valve  is actuated by an external signal preferably  air<br>
signal. A signal air lift the valve which leads to draining out of the condensate from the water collection<br>
chamber. Means are provided with some devices to cut off the  air  connection  between  the  air  tank  and   the<br>
condensate collection chamber during the blow off operation  to minimise wastage of compressed air.  These<br>
systems have the following disadvantages:-<br>
1.	Discharge occurs irrespective of whether there is<br>
condensate or not, this results in considerable air<br>
wastage in dry seasons.<br>
2.	The discharge duration is fixed and in very wet seasons, condensate levels build up inside the tanks due to inadequate length of discharge.<br>
3.	The systems has to be fitted out side the tank which makes it vulnerable to damages in moving systems.<br>
The other devices /valves are also known in  the  prior<br>
art  for the removal of the water from the  air systems. Such  type of devices /valves work on the  principal  of<br>
floats.  These  devices  act only when  there  is  water inside the tank. These devices consist of a condensate<br>
collection  chamber connected to the tank on one side  and the other side is opened to the atmosphere through the<br>
said  float actuated valve/device. The condensate  keeps collecting in the chamber and the float remains  raising<br>
till  the  level of the water reaches  a  predeterminate level at which the float causes the removal of the water<br>
to  the  atemosphere. When the water is  blown  off  the float returns to a lower level and thus closes the valve<br>
again.<br>
The main disadvantage associated with such devices is  that these devices are bulky and fitted outside  the<br>
air tanks. Also the floats are mechanically moving systems and are suceptible the damages and snags.<br>
Dribblers are also as such known in the prior art for the removal of the water from the air systems. These dribblers work on the basis on the internal signals generated by the pressure fluctuations inside the air tanks. The disadvantage associated with these devices is<br>
that the dribblers are  fitted outside the tank and  have limited  use  due to inadequate  discharge  which  takes place irrespective of presence of condensate.<br>
Therefore the main object of this invention is to provide  a  novel  device which  is  self-actuated  and<br>
floatless device and adapted to work on the basis of the signals generated internally when there is water in  the<br>
tank.<br>
Another	object of this invention is to provide a  novel<br>
device	for  use for the removal of water from  the  air<br>
systems	and which is adapted to be fitted inside the<br>
tank-<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a device which is light in weight and handy and easily install by the operator.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel device which is cheap in cost and the maintenance thereof is negligible. Further the device work efficiently.<br>

In  accordance  with  this invention the device  has  a<br>
housing having a plurality of chambers provided therein. An inner tube disposed in a outer tube is disposed  into<br>
the housing. A spring loaded piston secured with the outer  tube is provided in the second chamber to divide<br>
it into a third chamber, A seal is provided at the bottom of upper/first chamber to make it airtight. Seals<br>
are provided at the upper end of the second chamber and at  the preferry of the spring loaded piston.  Seal are<br>
provided at the inner side of the space provided between third and  bottom/fourth chamber to make the outer  tube<br>
and the bottom end of the outer tube as leak proof/airtide.  A  blow off passage is provided  at  the<br>
bottom end of the house for facilitating the exit of the condensate  water  to  the   atmosphere.  An  equalising<br>
passage is provided in one side of the housing for inter-connecting the first and second chamber with  each<br>
other. A pressure passage is provided on the other side of  the  housing  to connect the third  chamber  of  the<br>
device with the air tank of the air systems. A drain port  is  provided  at the bottom  of  the  housing  for<br>
facilitating the exit of condensate water to the environment poppet valve is provided at the bottom<br>
surface of the outer tube to close the drain port of the housing. The micro filter is provided on the top end  of<br>
inner tube having micro pore at the top surface. A device  for  removal  of  water  from  the  air  systems<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of this invention is here  in described and illustrated in  the  accompanying<br>
drawings whereins-<br>
Fig.l shows the sectional view of the device.<br>
Referring to the drawings the device of this invention has a housing H for accommodating an inner tube 4 having an outer tube 5 provided towards the bottom end of the inner tube 4. A plurality of chambers for example a first/top chamber A is provided towards the top end of the housing H. Another chamber is provided in the housing H towards the bottom end of the first chamber A. In spring loaded piston 10 is disposed within the other chamber to divide the same into a second chamber 8 and a third chamber C. A seals 6 is provided towards the top end of outer tube to make it leak proof/airtide with the bottom end of the chamber A. A seal 15 is provided at the top end of the chamber 8 to make the outer tube as leak proof/airtide with the top end of the chamber B. A seal/o ring 17 is provided at the priphery of the spring<br>
loaded  piston 10 disposed between the chamber B and  C.<br>
Another seal/O ring 18 is provided at the inner side of the space provided between a third chamber C and  fourth<br>
chamber D. A plurality of blow off pores 8 are provided towards  the top end of the outer tube for  facilitating<br>
the exit of condensate water stored in the bottom of the chamber  A. A blow off passage is provided in the  outer<br>
tube 5 for facilitating the exit of the condensate water of the drain port 19 provided centrally in the flange 13<br>
provided at the bottom end of the housing H. A NPT threads  12 are  provided at the collar of the flange  13<br>
for securing the device with an air tank of the air systems. A condensate filling passage 16 is provided  at<br>
one side of the housing H for connecting the chamber A with the air tank of the air systems. A pressure passage<br>
14 is provided at one side of the housing H to connect the  third chamber C of the device with the  air  inside<br>
the air tank. An equalising passage 3 is provided on the other  side of the housing H for connecting the top  end<br>
of the chamber A of chamber B of the housing. A micro filter 2 is provided at the top end of the inner tube  4<br>
for covering the micro pore 1 provided in the top end of  the inner tube 4. A poppet valve 20 is  provided  at<br>
the bottom surface of the outer tube 5 to close the drain port 19. Normally, when there is no condensate  or<br><br>
the condensate level is below the level of the condensate passage 16, chamber A and B are at tank pressure and also chamber C is at tank pressure, a valve 20 remains closed due to the pressure of the spring 9 and unbalanced air pressure on the valve poppet. The condensate keeps collecting in this position. When water level reaches the capillary 16 orifice, the orifice becomes choked for the passage of air. The pressure inside the chamber A and B drops due to leakage from the micro choke but the pressure in the chamber C reamins same as the tank pressure. The pressure differential so generated overcomes the spring and unbalanced force of the poppet and the valve opens and discharges the condensate into the atmosphere. When water is bown off, the air pressure of the tank blows the capillary clear and restores the air pressure inside the chamber A and B to the same level as the tank. This causes the valve to return to the closed position due to spring 9 force and unbalanced air pressure on the poppet. In both opening and closing operations, the condensate collected inside chamber A gets cleared through the step orifice 11 in the poppet. The above operations are repeated whenever the condensate level builds up inside the tank. The level may be chosen on the basis of the tolerable limit for condensate collection.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
