				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TRIAZOLONE DERIVATIVE Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to novel triazolone derivatives which are useful as medicaments, to their pharmacologically acceptable salts, or hydrates thereof, and to therapeutic or prophylactic agents for diseases associated with thrombus formation comprising the same as active ingredients. Background Art<br>
[0002] Living organisms with damaged blood vessels avoid hemorrhage death by rapid production of thrombin. However, excess production of thrombin due to inflammatory reaction in damaged blood vessels causes thrombosis, which impairs the function of essential organs. Thrombin inhibitors such as heparin and warfarin, which inhibit thrombin production or directly block thrombin activity, have long been used as anticoagulants to treat or prevent thrombosis. Still, it cannot be said that such medicaments are very satisfactory from a medical standpoint, and efforts continue throughout the world toward research and development of new orally administrable anticoagulants with excellent dose response and low risk of bleeding.<br>
[0003] The blood clotting mechanism has been classified into two pathways, the "intrinsic clotting pathway" which begins with activation of factor XII (FXII) upon contact with negative charged substances, and the "extrinsic clotting pathway" which is activated by tissue factor (TF) and factor VII (FVII). Since the pathology of thrombosis onset is associated with specific expression of TF, it has been suggested that extrinsic clotting is of major importance. Compounds that inhibit clotting factor Vila, which is furthest upstream in the extrinsic clotting pathway of the clotting cascade, are thought to have potential use as therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for diseases associated with thrombus formation, such as thrombosis, in which the extrinsic clotting mechanism plays a part. [0004] As compounds that inhibit clotting factor Vila there are known<br><br>
in the prior art amidinonaphthol derivatives (see Non-patent document 1),<br>
amidino  derivatives   (see   Patent  document   1),   N-sulfonyl   dipeptide<br>
derivatives	(see	Patent	document	2),<br>
6-[[(allyI)oxy]methyl]naphthalene-2-carboxyimidamide  derivatives  (see<br>
Patent document 3) and phenylglycine derivatives (Patent documents 4<br>
and 5).<br>
[0005]  However,  these  known  compounds  are  inadequate  from  the<br>
standpoint  of inhibition  activity against clotting  factor  Vila,  blood<br>
clotting effects and thrombosis-treating effects.<br>

[Patent document 5] WO 00/41531 Disclosure of the Invention<br>
[0007] It is an object of the present invention, which has been accomplished in light of the aforementioned problems of the prior art, to provide novel triazolone derivatives having serine protease inhibitory activity, and particularly excellent inhibitory activity against clotting factor Vila, as well as their pharmacologically acceptable salts and hydrates thereof, and therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for diseases associated with thrombus formation, that employ the foregoing.

[0016] The compounds of the invention have excellent inhibiting effects against clotting factor Vila and excellent anticoagulant effects, and are therefore useful as therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for diseases associated with thrombus formation (for example, thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, vascular restenosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome) (Johannes Ruef &amp; Hugo A Katus, New antithrombotic drugs on the horizon, Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs (2003) 12 (5): 781-797).<br>
[0017] Substances with inhibiting effects against clotting factor Vila have also been reported to exhibit malignant tumor metastasis suppression and reduction. Thus, the compounds of the present invention that have excellent inhibiting effects against clotting factor<br><br>
Vila are also useful as therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for malignant tumors and the like (Mattias Belting et al., Regulation of angiogenesis by tissue factor cytoplasmic domain signaling, Nature Medicine (2004) 10 (5): 502-509; X Jiang et al., Formation of tissue factor-factor Vila-factor Xa complex promotes cellular signaling and migration of human breast cancer cells, J Thromb Haemost, (2004) 2: 93-101; Hembrough TA. Swartz GM. Papathanassiu A. Vlasuk GP. Rote WE. Green SJ. Pribluda VS., Tissue factor/factor Vila inhibitors block angiogenesis and tumor growth through a nonhemostatic mechanism. Cancer Research (2003) 63 (11): 2997-3000).<br>
[0018] Since the compounds of the invention have excellent suppressing effects against blood clotting, and are safer with suitable physicochemical stability, they are useful as medicaments, and especially as therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for diseases associated with thrombus formation.<br>

[0142]   [Step El]<br>
This is a step of converting compound (le) (compound (13a) wherein T<br>
is the formula:<br>
[0143]  [Chemical Formula 31]<br><br>
(wherein R4 is as defined above)) to compound (2e) of the invention in a solvent, in the presence of a suitable metal reagent.<br><br>
As compound (le) there may be used, instead of compound (13a) obtained by [Production Process A] described above, a publicly known compound, a commercially available compound or a compound that can be produced from a commercially available compound by a process ordinarily carried out by those skilled in the art or by the processes described in the examples below.<br>
The step may also be carried out under a stream or under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon.<br>
The metal reagent used for the reaction may be iron powder, zinc, Raney nickel or the like, with iron powder being preferred.<br>
The solvent used for the reaction is not particularly restricted so long as it dissolves the starting materials to some degree and does not interfere with the reaction, and for example, there may be used alcohol-based solvents such as methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol, organic acids such as acetic acid and formic acid, water, or mixtures thereof, among which methanol, acetic acid and water mixed solvent is preferred.<br>

[0144] Upon completion of the reaction in each step of the processes described above, the target compound of each step may be recovered from the reaction mixture by an ordinary method.<br>
[0145] For example, when the entire reaction mixture is a solution, the reaction mixture may be returned to room temperature or cooled on ice as<br><br>
desired, and neutralized with an appropriate acid, alkali, oxidizing agent or reducing agent, prior to addition of water and an organic solvent that is immiscible therewith and does not react with the target compound, such as ethyl acetate, and separation of the layer containing the target compound. Next, a solvent that is immiscible with the recovered layer and does not react with the target compound may be added, and then the layer containing the target compound washed and separated. When the layer is an organic layer, it may be dried using a desiccating agent such as anhydrous magnesium sulfate or anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent distilled off to recover the target compound. When the layer is an aqueous layer, it may be electrically desalted and then lyophilized to recover the target compound.<br>
[0146] When the entire reaction mixture is a solution, it may be possible to recover the target compound simply by distilling off the components other than the target compound (for example, solvent, reagents, etc.) at ordinary pressure or under reduced pressure.<br>
[0147] When the target compound precipitates alone as a solid, or when the entire reaction mixture is a solution and the target compound precipitates alone as a solid during the recovery process, the target compound may be first filtered by a filtration method, the filtered target compound washed with a suitable organic or inorganic solvent and drying performed for treatment of the mother liquor in the same manner as if the entire reaction mixture were a solution, in order to obtain the target compound.<br>
[0148] On the other hand, when the reagents or catalyst are the only solids present, or when the entire reaction mixture is a solution and the reagents or catalyst alone precipitate in solid form during the recovery process, with the target compound remaining dissolved in solution, the reagents or catalyst may be first filtered by a filtration method, the filtered reagents or catalyst washed with a suitable organic or inorganic solvent, and the obtained wash combined with the mother liquor to obtain a liquid mixture, which may then be treated in the same manner as if the entire reaction mixture were a solution, in order to obtain the target<br><br>
compound.<br>
[0149] The reaction mixture may be used directly for subsequent steps without isolation of the target compound in cases where components other than the target compound in the reaction mixture will not inhibit reaction in the subsequent steps.<br>
[0150] Purity of the target compound recovered by such methods can be increased by appropriately carrying out recrystallization, various chromatography methods or distillation.<br>
[0151] When the recovered target compound is a solid, purity of the target compound can usually be improved by recrystallization. For recrystallization there may be used a simple solvent or a multiple solvent mixture that does not react with the target compound. Specifically, the target compound may first be dissolved at room temperature or with heating in the simple solvent or solvent mixture that does not react with the target compound. The obtained mixture may then be cooled with ice water or the like or allowed to stand at room temperature to cause precipitation of the target compound from the mixture. [0152] When the recovered target compound is a liquid, purity of the target compound can be improved by various chromatography methods. In most cases a weakly acidic silica gel such as silica gel 60 (70-230 mesh or 340-400 mesh) by Merck, Ltd. or BW-300 (300 mesh) by Fuji Silysia Chemical, Ltd. may be used. If the target compound is basic and adsorption onto the aforementioned silica gel types is too strong, there may be used propylamine-coated silica gel (200-350 mesh) by Fuji Silysia Chemical, Ltd.. If the target compound is dipolar or requires elution with a highly polar solvent such as methanol, there may be used NAM-200H or NAM-300H by Nagara Science Co., Ltd. Using these silica gels, the target compound may be eluted in a simple solvent or solvent mixture that does not react with the target compound and the solvent distilled off to obtain the target compound with enhanced purity. [0153] When the recovered target compound is a liquid, purity of the target compound can also be improved by distillation. For distillation, the target compound may be placed under reduced pressure at room<br><br>
temperature or with heating to achieve distillation of the target compound.<br>
[0154] Representative examples of production processes for compounds according to the invention were described above, but the starting compounds and reagents for production of the invention compounds may form salts, hydrates or solvates, will differ depending on the starting materials and solvents used, and are not particularly restricted so long as they do not inhibit the reaction. The solvent used will also differ depending on the starting materials and reagents, and of course is not particularly restricted so long as it can dissolve the starting materials to some degree and does not inhibit the reaction. When a compound of the invention is obtained in free form, it may be converted to an acceptable salt or a hydrate of the compound by an ordinary method. [0155] Conversely, when a compound of the invention is obtained as a salt or hydrate, it may be converted to the free form of the compound by an ordinary method.<br>

13 and a half hours under a nitrogen atmosphere and then concentrated.<br>
The residue obtained was dissolved in 3 ml of methanol, 1 ml of THF,<br>
and 0.3 ml of acetic acid, and then 200 mg of sodium<br>
cyanotrihydroborate was added thereto. The mixture was stirred at<br>
room temperature for 2 hours and 20 minutes, and then 100 mg of<br>
sodium cyanotrihydroborate was further added thereto. The mixture<br>
was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Water and<br>
ethyl acetate were added to the reaction mixture. The resulting mixture<br>
was extracted with ethyl acetate twice. The organic layers were<br>
combined, washed with saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate. The desiccating agent was removed by filtration,<br>
and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
To 5 ml of a methanol solution containing the residue obtained, 3 ml of a<br>
5 N sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added. The mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 11 hours. The pH of the reaction<br>
mixture was adjusted to approximately 3 with 5 N hydrochloric acid.<br>
The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was<br>

[Inhibitory activity against clotting factor Vila]<br>
[1892]  (1) Method<br>
Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solutions were prepared with compounds of<br>
the invention at    concentration of 10 mmol/L (10 mmol/L compound<br>
solutions).<br>
One   packet   of   tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane-preset   (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "Tris preset")  (Product of Sigma Corp.,  Catalog No.<br>
T8293), 8.8 g of sodium chloride (NaCl) and  1  g of bovine serum<br>
albumin (hereinafter abbreviated as "BSA") were dissolved in 1 L of<br>
water to prepare a Tris-BSA buffer (100 mmol/L Tris, 0.15 mol/L NaCl,<br>
0.1% BSA, pH 7.4).<br><br>
This Tris-BSA buffer (180 uL) was added to the aforementioned 10 mmol/L compound solution (20 uL). A 10-fold dilution series was prepared for this mixture using the aforementioned Tris-BSA buffer, and solutions with the compound at concentrations of 1.0 mmol/L, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 umol/L were prepared (1.0 mmol-0.001 umol/L compound solutions).<br>
As a control, a solution was prepared by 10-fold dilution of DMSO with the Tris-BSA buffer (hereinafter referred to as "control 10% solution"). After dissolving one packet of Tris preset, NaCl (8.8 g) and BSA (1 g) in water (about 900 mL), there were added 1 mol/L aqueous calcium chloride (CaCh) (15 mL) and 1 mg/mL aqueous cephalin (30 mL), and the total volume was brought to 1 L by adding water. To this solution there was added a human tissue factor (hereinafter, "TF") sample (product of Calbiochem, Catalog No. 612151) (450 u,g) to a TF sample concentration of 10 nmol/L, and then a human clotting factor Vila (hereinafter, "Factor Vila") purified sample (product of Enzyme Research Laboratories, Catalog No. HFVIIa) (250 fxg) was added to a Factor Vila purified sample concentration of 5 nmol/L, to prepare an enzyme solution (100 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 0.15 mol/L NaCl, 15 mmol/L CaCb, 30 n.g/mL cephalin, 1 mg/mL BSA, 10 nmol/L TF, 5 nmol/L Factor Vila).<br>
To 110 uL of this enzyme solution there was added 15 uL of each of the 1.0 mmol-0.001 umol/L compound solutions, and then 25 uL of a 1.0 mmol/L synthetic chromogenic substrate solution (Spectrozyme FVIIa, product of American Diagnostica, Catalog No. 217L) was added and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 40 minutes. Next, the amount of 4-nitroanilide released into the solution was quantitated by spectrophotometry (405 nm).<br>
A control measurement was conducted in the same manner, using the control 10% solution instead of the compound solution. This measurement yielded the enzyme reaction inhibition in the presence of 100 nmol/L to 0.1 nmol/L of each compound of the invention. The enzyme reaction inhibition at each compound concentration was<br><br>
subjected to non-linear regression  analysis,  and the  IC50 value for<br>
inhibitory activity of each compound against clotting factor Vila was<br>
calculated.<br>
[1893]  (2) Results<br>
Tables 1 to 4 show the IC50 values (IC50 FVIIa (uM)) for inhibitory<br>
activity of each compound against clotting factor Vila.<br><br><br><br>
as therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents for diseases associated with thrombus formation.<br><br><br><br><br>
