Vacuum vessel for treatment of oils<br>
The present invention relates to a vacuum vessel for continuous or semi-<br>
continuous treatment of oils in connection with deodorization, which<br>
vessel comprises spaces through which the oil to be treated is brought to<br>
pass, means to heat or cool the oil in the form of U-tubes, perforated<br>
pipes arranged at the bottom of said spaces to lead stripping gas into<br>
said oil, which vessel has a connection to a vacuum source and which<br>
spaces in the vessel are arranged such that the oil passes through the<br>
vessel by gravity and a heating or cooling medium passing said U-tubes<br>
is arranged to be pumped therethrough.<br>
Such a vacuum vessel for treatment of fatty oils is described for example<br>
in EP 0 763 082 B1. When producing consumer products as edible oils<br>
out of different vegetable or animal oils deodorization is a part of the<br>
refining process. During the deodorization the oil is heated to a high<br>
temperature 180 - 275 Â°C in order to remove contaminants and<br>
unwanted substances from the oil. These substances have a lower<br>
boiling point than the different triglycerides, which constitute the edible oil.<br>
The deodorization is carried through under vacuum 1-20 mbar and the<br>
removal of the volatiles is facilitated by adding stripping gas to the oil. The<br>
stripping gas may consist of an inert gas or steam. The stripping gas<br>
ensures agitation of the oil and promotes heat transfer and makes the<br>
removal of the unwanted substances easier.<br>
Vacuum vessels may be used for treatment of many kinds of oils and fats<br>
including mineral oil.<br>
For many types of oils it is useful to heat the oil under vacuum with<br>
addition of stripping gas during a pretreatment step prior to the<br><br>
deodorization in order to remove the dissolved air and that hinder an<br>
oxidation of the oil.<br>
The deodorized oil is also in many cases subjected to a further treatment<br>
with injection of stripping gas during a simultaneous cooling after the<br>
deodorization step.<br>
The vessel is specially adapted for exchanging heat between incoming<br>
and outgoing edible oils in deodorizing and physical refining plants. The<br>
incoming oil to the deodorizing column is heated by outgoing oil under<br>
vacuum and sparging conditions<br>
The aim of the invention is to increase the efficiency of the heat exchange<br>
between the oil and the heating or cooling medium while limiting the size<br>
of the vacuum vessel. This is achieved in that the U-tubes for heating or<br>
cooling medium are arranged in such a way in said spaces that the flow<br>
of oil is counter-current to the flow of heating or cooling medium all<br>
through the vessel and that a number of U-tubes are arranged in groups,<br>
parallel and in rows above each other.<br>
The vacuum vessel according to the invention may with advantage<br>
comprise at least one layer of spaces for the oil to be treated in the<br>
vessel. According to a preferred embodiment of the vacuum vessel<br>
according to the invention there are two layers of spaces for oil. There is<br>
an inlet for the oil to an upper part of the upper layer and an outlet for the<br>
oil in a lower part of the lower layer. There is also a channel connecting a<br>
lower part of the upper layer to a higher part of the lower layer. This<br>
channel may advantageously be situated on the outside of the. vacuum<br>
vessel. If so is suitable the vessel may contain three or more layers of<br>
spaces.<br><br>
The lower part of the vessel has preferably a square-shaped or<br>
rectangular form while the upper side is curved (bended).<br>
In the vessel there are with advantage channel plates separating the<br>
spaces for oil from each other in order to create a long path for the oil<br>
through the vessel. The channel plates are firmly connected to two sides<br>
of the vessel facing each other and are provided with an opening in one<br>
end to provide a connection to another space for the oil. The opening is<br>
provided in an end firmly connected to a first side of the vessel. It is<br>
possible to let the channel plates end at a distance from one of the sides<br>
but when the channel plates are firmly connected to both sides the<br>
stability of the vessel increases.<br>
Between the channel plates there are walls firmly connected to said first<br>
side of the vessel and ending at a distance from the a second side. These<br>
walls are situated between the legs of the U-tubes. This arrangement of<br>
the walls in relation to the channel plates make it possible to obtain a<br>
counter-current flow of the oil in relation to the heating or cooling medium.<br>
Of course it is possible to obtain the desirable counter-current flow in<br>
some other ways within the scope of the invention.<br>
On the outside of the first side of vacuum vessel there are headers, which<br>
define inlets to distribute the heating or cooling medium into the U-tubes<br>
and outlets to collect the heating or cooling medium after passage of the<br>
U-tubes. By arranging different headers for the inlet and outlet to each<br>
group of U-tubes it is easier to seal each header due to the smaller<br>
covers. The smaller covers mean that there is less critical machining for<br>
the gasket surface, lower risk of warp and a better choice of gasket<br>
material. This is important for preventing leakage of oil during operation,<br>
but also for preventing entry of air during stock-change.<br><br>
The second and third headers are connected as well as the fourth and fifth header<br>
and so on, counted from the inlet for the heating or cooling medium. In this way the<br>
heating or cooling medium is made to flow through the U-tubes in all spaces in the<br>
vessel.<br>
The number of U-tubes in each space for oil depends on the desired capacity of the<br>
vacuum vessel.<br>
The walls between the channel plates in the upper layer of spaces are suitably<br>
hollow in order to create a connection between a volume above the oil in the lower<br>
layer and a volume above the oil in the upper layer of spaces, which upper volume<br>
is connected to the vacuum source.<br>
The vacuum vessel according to the invention is preferable made up by thin<br>
elements, baffles and channel plates, which are arranged in such relation to each<br>
other that the structure of the vessel is self-supporting.<br>
The vacuum vessel according to the invention may be used for preheating fatty oils<br>
to be deodorized by already deodorized oil and subjecting said deodorized oil to a<br>
further treatment with stripping gas.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
A preferred embodiment of a vacuum vessel according to the invention is described<br>
in more detail with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a perspective drawing of the vacuum vessel,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective drawing of the vacuum vessel as seem from a point of<br>
view, where the front side has been removed,<br>
Fig. 3 shows another perspective of the drawing of fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a horizontal cross-section of the vacuum vessel<br>
and Fig. 5 shows the front side of the vacuum vessel and the groups of U-tubes.<br><br>
The embodiment of the vacuum vessel 1 shown in fig. 1 has an elongated<br>
form with a first side 2. There is an inlet 3 for the oil, which is to be treated<br>
in the vessel in an upper corner of the side 2 and an outlet 4 for the<br>
treated oil in a lower corner. There are also an inlet 5 and an outlet 6<br>
for a heating or cooling medium. At the top of the vessel 1 there is a<br>
connection 7 to a vacuum source. There are also three sight-glasses 8.<br>
As may be seen in the drawing there is a leg 9 in the left end of side 2<br>
which is higher than the teg 10 at the right end. This arrangement results<br>
in that the bottom of the vessel is inclined in relation to the foundation.<br>
There are also headers 11 for distributing the heating or cooling medium<br>
over the group of U-tubes.<br>
At the other end of the vessel (not shown in the drawing) there are<br>
sparging pipes for stripping steam and further sight-glasses for a lower<br>
layer or deck.<br>
In fig. 2 there is shown the spaces 12,121 through which the oil to be<br>
treated flows as well as the inlet 3 for the oil. The oil enters the vessel by<br>
way of the inlet 3, flows along the long-side of the vessel and returns<br>
through space 121 to the first side 2 of the vessel. The oil is then directed<br>
to the next space 122 through the opening visible in the channel plate<br>
between 12 and 121 and flows again to the other side of the vessel. In<br>
each space for the oil there are legs of a group of U-tubes 13 for heating .<br>
or cooling the oil to be treated. The spaces for oil are arranged in two<br>
layers or decks 14 and 15.<br>
The spaces for the oil 12,121, 122 are shown more clearly in fig. 3. There<br>
are longitudinal channel plates 16,161 separating spaces 12 and 121 from<br>
spaces 122 and the next space and so on. These channel plates extend<br><br>
from the first 2 to the second side of the vessel and are firmly connected<br>
to these sides. As may be seen in the drawing there are openings 17 for<br>
the oil in the channel plates 10,161 at the ends connected to the first<br>
side. In this drawing only the ends and parts of the group of U-tubes is to<br>
be seen. The arrangement and bends of the U-tubes are shown in fig.4.<br>
Between the legs of the U-tubes there are walls 18,181 firmly connected<br>
to the first side. As may be seen in fig. 4 these walls end at a distance<br>
from the second side. The walls have such a height that the level of oil is<br>
well below the upper edge of the walls. The walls 18 in the lower layer 15<br>
are single, while the walls 19 in the upper layer 14 are double forming a<br>
duct 20. The bottom 21 of the upper layer is provided with openings,<br>
which cooperate with the ducts 20 between the walls 19 to provide a<br>
connection between the volume 22 above the oil in the lower layer 15 and<br>
a volume 23 above the oil in the upper layer 14. The volume 23 is<br>
connected to the vacuum source. The grey arrows show the connection<br>
between the lowermost volume 22 and the vacuum connection 7.<br>
As described earlier the oil to be treated enters through the inlet 3 and<br>
flows forwards and backwards until it reaches the last space in the upper<br>
layer, where there is an opening in the bottom 21 cooperating with an<br>
internal outlet 24. The way for transporting the oil to the lower layer of<br>
spaces will be explained later. The oil is transported to the uppermost<br>
space of the lower layer (to the left in the drawing) and flows forwards<br>
and backwards through the spaces until it reaches the outlet 4 for treated<br>
oil.<br>
Fig. 4 shows how the groups of U-tubes are arranged in the spaces 12,<br>
121 and 122. The spaces 12 and 122 are separated by the channel plate<br>
16, which channel plate is firmly connected to the first side 2 and the<br>
second side 25. Between the legs of the group of U-tubes in the lower<br><br>
deck there are walls 18 forcing the oil to flow to the second side 25 of the<br>
vessel before returning to the first side again.<br>
In the drawing there are also shown the sparging pipes 26,261 and so on,<br>
for introducing stripping gas into the oil. Outside the vessel there are<br>
means to distribute the stripping gas to the sparging pipes. As may be<br>
seen on the drawing there are also sight-glasses 27 through which the<br>
sparging conditions may be supervised. The heating or cooling medium<br>
enters through the groups of U-tubes at the upper end of the drawing and<br>
flows In counter-current to the oil to be treated all through the spaces in<br>
the shown layer. The arrows show how the oil and the heating or cooling<br>
medium flow in counter-current The arrows showing the oil flow is<br>
somewhat darker than the arrows showing the flow of heating or cooling<br>
medium.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the first side 2 of the vessel, the inlet 3 for the oil to be<br>
treated and the outlet 4 for the treated oil. There is also shown the inlet 5<br>
for heating or cooling medium and the outlet 6 for the same. In the shown<br>
embodiment of the invention there are six groups of U-tubes in each<br>
layer. The heating or cooling medium enters one leg of an U-tube and<br>
returns through the other leg. In the shown embodiment there are five U-<br>
tubes in nine rows above each other, The heating or cooling medium<br>
enters the first header 28 and is distributed over and into the first leg of<br>
the forty-five tubes. When the heating or cooling medium has flown<br>
through the U-tubes it is collected in the second header 281. There is a<br>
connection between the second header 281 and a third header 282 and<br>
the heating or cooling medium flows into the third header and is<br>
distributed into the second group of U-tubes. Also the heating or cooling<br>
medium flows forwards and backwards in the U-tubes until it reaches the<br>
last header 29 in the lower layer. Between this header 29 and another<br><br>
header 30 in the upper layer there is a channel 31 through which the<br>
heating or cooling medium may flow (be pumped) to the upper layer.<br>
The heating or cooling medium flows forwards and backwards within the<br>
U-tubes until it reaches the last header 32 in the upper layer. The heating<br>
or cooling medium leaves the vessel through the outlet 6.<br>
As was mentioned earlier the oil to be treated is transported from the<br>
upper layer of spaces to the lower layer of spaces. This transport takes<br>
place by way of channel 33 situated inside of the channel 31.<br>
The vacuum vessel may be self-supporting in that the channel plates 16,<br>
161 and the baffles 34 (fig.4) cooperate.<br><br>
